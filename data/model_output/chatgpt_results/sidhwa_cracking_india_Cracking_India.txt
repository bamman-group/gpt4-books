<name>he</name> (There is no proper name given in this sentence, and the pronoun "he" is used to refer to one of the men in the scene.)	he (There is no proper name given in this sentence, and the pronoun "he" is used to refer to one of the men in the scene.)	Masseur	He is wearing a long creamy silk shirt over his heavy linen lungi and his moustache is oiled and gleaming. The men appraise each other with cautious suspicion as [MASK], hitching up his lungi, hunkers down on the floor.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Mumtaz	“Not now,” says [MASK]. “But I cannot forget what happened.” “That was fated, daughter. It can’t be undone. But it can be forgiven.. . Worse things are forgiven. Life goes on and the business of living buries the debris of our pasts.
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Godmother	“Have you soaked the rice yet?” [MASK] enquires. “After you’ve soaked it I want you to knead the chapatti dough. And I told you to tighten the cot strings yesterday... Did you? Well then, you may have the pleasure of sleeping on it tonight!
<name>Lenny</name>	Lenny	Ayah	Colder than the ice that lurks behind the hazel in Ice-candy-man’s beguiling eyes. At last [MASK] casts her lids down: and bowing her head, extends her hennaed hands to me. I move awkwardly into the voluminous skirt of her brocade garara.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Ayah	A lion roaring behind bars is bad enough. But a lion straining on a stout leash held by this thin, stuttering Sikh is unthinkable. I burst into tears. “Now look what you’ve done,” says [MASK] in her usual good-natured manner.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Ayah	“What are you doing in this crowd?” he asks. “You could get hurt.” We spot [MASK]. She appears panicked. And when she sees us she rushes up to me and picks me up and fusses over me as if I’ve been lost and found.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Cousin	“Lick me, here, and see what happens." I lick the tip gingerly. Nothing. No honey. “You’ve got to suck out the honey.” [MASK] arches his back and maneuvers his penis to my mouth. “Suck it yourself!”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Cousin	But having only the two hands to do all this with he can’t pull them down because galvanized to action I grab them up and jab him with my elbows and knees, and turning and twisting, with my toes and heels. Becoming red in the face, [MASK] lets me be.
<name>Dr. Kennicott</name>	Dr. Kennicott	Godmother	“Is that what it is?” asks [MASK], all intelligent and alert and concerned. “Is she constipated, do you think? Could you prescribe her a strong purgative?” "I can give her a horse’s dose, if you wish.”
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Rosy	It is heavy-looking, about a foot high, long and no narrow. Like a coffin for a very thin man. [MASK], turning pale, whispers, “Someone is dead.” We are agreed it is a coffin. It looks sinister enough.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Adi	I am at peace—there is honor even among thieves—and the fear of reprisal. I casually place my left hand above the plate and maneuver it to shield the giblet. 1 don’t wish to put undue strain on [MASK]’s honor.
<name>Hitler</name>	Hitler	Hari	From the distance, drawing stridently nearer, clamors the “tee-too, tee-too” of the dread siren. The sound shrivels time—the way [MASK]’s genitals shriveled. 1 am back in the factory filled with children lying on their backs on beds.
<name>Amrita</name>	Amrita	Peter	His are crossed at the ankles, smell frankly of cow dung and are prone to shake in and out at the knees. Hers are planted solidly side by side beneath her sari. [MASK]’s father is a turbaned and bearded Sikh.
<name>Hindus</name>	Hindus	Parsees	It is so apt to the occasion that my anger vanishes. I have heard this couplet before. A glimpse of four Sikhs, Muslims or [MASK] is supposed to send a mob of Banyas scurrying. Chapter 12 A strange black box makes its appearance in my parents’ bathroom.
<name>Titus</name>	Titus	Ayah	In such a way as to shield our rears: and in front our dangling dingdongs!” Taking my cue from [MASK], I too wear a faintly scandalized, faintly amused expression. “We exposed ourselves so that only they could see us.
<name>Munshi</name>	Munshi	Hari	He is small, dark, shriveled, old. He looks just like [MASK], our gardener, except he has a disgruntled, disgusted and irritable look, and no one’d dare pull off his dhoti! He wears only the loincloth and his black and thin torso is naked.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Ranna	“Send him here,” someone shouted. [MASK] ran up to the men. “Don’t you know? Your mother married me yesterday,” said a fat-faced, fat-bellied Hindu, his hairy legs bulging beneath the shorts of his uniform.
<name>Mahatma</name>	Mahatma	Hari	Again they’re after [MASK]’s dhoti. But instead of the light, quick patter of bare feet there is the harsh scrape and drag of leather on frozen earth. It doesn’t seem quite right to toy with a man’s dhoti when it is so cold.
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Ranna	[MASK] fell just inside the door on a tangled pile of unrecognizable bodies. Someone fell on him, drenching him in blood. Every time his eyes open the world appears to them to be floating in blood. From the direction of the mosque come the intolerable shrieks and wails of women.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Ayah	“How long’ve you been back?” asks [MASK], undoing the knots in the bundle with her teeth and examining the conte nts with her fingers. “Two days,” he says, his voice honeyed wit|h adoration.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Cousin	Her one leg was shorter. She didn’t even have a pretty face. But her limp was so sexy, everybody wanted to marry her!” I don’t care for [MASK]’s secondhand consolations. In any case, I don’t want him harping on my limp.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Ranna	Someone was banging on the door, shouting: “Open up! Open up! [MASK] awoke with a start. Why was he on the floor? Why were there so many people about in the dark? He felt the stir of men getting to their feet.
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Mumtaz	Life goes on and the business of living buries the debris of our pasts. Hurt, happiness... all fade impartially... to make way for fresh joy and new sorrow. That’s the way of life.” “I am past that,” says [MASK].
<name>I</name>	I	Ayah	He slips his palm beneath his armpit and, flapping his other arm like a chicken wing, generates a succession of fart-like sounds. I think he’s so funny I laugh until my tummy hurts. But [MASK] is not laughing.
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Chidda	“Of course not!” I say. I don’t care who hears me. “It’s the city fashion.” I glare at her. “Even my mother’s hair is short.” [MASK], squatting by the hearth, summons her daughter.
<name>Lenny</name>	Lenny	Godmother	“But now she has everything to live for.” [MASK]’s eyes on the poet’s exposed face are dispassionate. Cold. And gliding forward on his haunches Ice-candy-man clasps her hands in both his and places them on his bowed, penitent’s head.
<name>Luna</name>	Luna	Godmother	She maintains a strategic silence, suppressing even her mumbles. [MASK] makes a magically triumphant face. She holds her pointy fingers in a “V” for victory, winks at me and leans back on her concrete pillows. I go into the kitchen to finish my curry
<name>Mullah</name>	Mullah	Masseur	exclaim the men in half-awed, half-mocking welcome, making room for Ice-candy-man between the Government House gardener and [MASK]. Laying his trident aside, lighting a cigarette and assuming his customary, slouching pose on the grass, the holyman becomes Ice-candy-man.
<name>Quixote</name>	Quixote	Adi	[MASK] is perched on a tall pony. I am on a donkey. My donkey trots alongside and I perceive just how short it is. My legs stick out beneath the safety ring on the saddle. I grip the ring resentfully. The donkey-man holds the reins.
<name>Dr. Treves</name>	Dr. Treves	Ayah	"Come on. Up, up!” he says, crooking a beckoning finger. “She not walk much... she get tired,” drawls [MASK]. And simultaneously I raise my trouser cuff to reveal the leather straps and wicked steel calipers harnessing my right boot.
<name>Marilyn</name>	Marilyn	Ayah	This occurs so frequently that she’d have to be a real nitwit not to catch on. [MASK], aware she is the star attraction, rolls and slides her thickly fringed eyes to glamorous effect as she passes the tea. She goes in and fetches a plate of almond fudge and sweet lentil ladoos.
<name>Ayah</name>	Ayah	Godmother	Ice-candy-man appears to have sensed the content of the exchange between [MASK] and his bride. Maintaining a nervous stream of chatter, quoting snatches of poetry, pressing us to eat and drink, he attempts to conceal his misgiving.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Godmother	“You might regret your decision... You should think it over.” “I have thought it over... I want to go to my folk.” “Let’s see what I can do,” [MASK] says gently. "I’ll try my best.”
<name>Zaroff</name>	Zaroff	Ramzana	Don’t be silly,” she tells me. “The lion is never let out of his cage. The cage is so strong a hundred lions couldn’t break it.” “And," says [MASK] the butcher, “I give him a juicy goat every day.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Adi	By now [MASK] is fully awake. I watch helplessly as mercurial preoccupation veils his eyes. He becomes remote. His vulnerability vanishes. He kicks out, pushing back our hands with the tissues. He is in control.
<name>Uncle Axel</name>	Uncle Axel	Oldhusband	[MASK] emerges from his habitually sour-faced stupor and kisses my forehead. Like a somnambulist I receive from him a small packet wrapped in tissue paper. I open the packet. It is an autograph book with colored pages, and it falls open on a yellow page with writing on it.
<name>June</name>	June	Hamida	I pray that their husbands and families will take them back. [MASK] seldom mentions her children. All I’ve been able to get out of her is that she has two teenage sons and two daughters, one as old as me and one younger.
<name>Joffrey</name>	Joffrey	Adi	As it happens, the precaution is unnecessary. 1 raise a glass of water to my lips and [MASK]’s swift hand strikes. The giblet is jammed into his mouth and swallowed whole. His throat works like a boa constrictor’s and his face turns red.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Slavesister	“What’s the matter with you? The Demon of Laziness finally get you?” “I’m going, I’m going.” [MASK]’s string-bed creaks as she stands up in her crumpled nightie. "
<name>Uncle Jack</name>	Uncle Jack	Godmother	"Why? It isn’t her fault she was kidnapped!” “Some folk feel that way—they can’t stand their women being touched by other men.” It’s monstrously unfair: but [MASK]’s tone is accepting.
<name>Ayah</name>	Ayah	Ayah	[MASK]’s eyes flash a warning and Ice-candy-man’s serpentine arm floats away. He shifts his eyes from us and stares ingenuously into the fading day. “The padre, poor fellow, still doesn’t know what happened,” he says dreamily.
<name>Munna</name>	Munna	Yousaf	“I can’t believe it... She drew blood!” “It was only a fly-swat, yaar" says [MASK] taking hold of his arm. He shouts at the gawkers: "What’s there to see? Go on, push off!”
<name>Mrs. Dubose</name>	Mrs. Dubose	Godmother	Neighbors of all faiths drop in to talk and to pay their respects. But [MASK] seldom ventures out. She only visits if someone is very sick or in extreme need of her. Or if she feels the call to donate blood. The call nags her this stifling July morning.
<name>the interrogator</name>	the interrogator	Godmother	No one has touched her since our Hikah." “When did the marriage take place?” asks [MASK], unmoved. “In May.” “She was lifted in February and you married her in May? What were you doing all that time?”
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Ayah	His departure brings to mind the Chinaman. It occurs to me that I haven’t seen him for a long time. “Where is he? Tell me. Tell me,” I shout into [MASK]’s ears, and holding her by them, force her to turn to me.
<name>Flashman</name>	Flashman	Papoo	[MASK] can let fly a string of invective, compared to which the tongawallah’s invective sounds like a lullaby, and manages to appear stunningly roguish. And I cannot even say a damned “damn fool” without being told it does not suit me!
<name>Mrs. L. N. Aggarwal</name>	Mrs. L. N. Aggarwal	Godmother	[MASK] is busy in the kitchen. She moves to and fro, looking like an upended whale in her white sari with her sloping shoulders and broadening torso and the sari narrowing round her ankles. She has the same noble bearing and alert, accommodating air of that intelligent mammal.
<name>she</name>	she	Hamida	It is the perfect day for a story. The sun is warm on our skins, casting a quiet, lazy spell on the afternoon. It is the first story [MASK] tells me. Later I discover she has a fund of unusual and depressing little tales.
<name>her</name>	her	Ayah	“Oh-ho,” she says, all singsongy. “I have no munneeey—how I buy?” “You sit,” coaxes the Chinaman, pulling [MASK] to squat beside him and, retaining his hold, engages her in a staccato and desultory conversation.
<name>Eragon</name>	Eragon	Ranna	“There’s no telling who’s about these days... and not all of them are your friends.” The sun has set, but it is still light enough to see. [MASK] was leaning against his father when the grauthi spoke.
<name>he</name>	he	Ranna	He didn’t stop until deep inside a thicket of sugarcane he stumbled on a slightly elevated slab of drier ground. The clay felt soft and caressing against his exhausted body. It was a safe place to rest. The moment [MASK] felt secure his head hurt and he fainted.
<name>Prim</name>	Prim	Ayah	The next morning [MASK] wakes me up when it is still night. She helps me to dress quietly: wrestling my arms into last year’s coat and my ears into a horrible pink peaked cap Electric-aunt knitted me two years ago.
<name>Kambili</name>	Kambili	Ranna	[MASK] hurtled down the lanes, weaving through the burdened and distraught villagers and straying cattle, into his aunt’s hut. He saw her right away, heaping her pots and pans on a cot. A fat roll of winter bedding tied with a string lay to one side.
<name>Offred</name>	Offred	Hamida	“Did you cry?” I ask [MASK]. “Who doesn’t? We’re all fate-smitten...” “I mean, when you were there?” Her hand on my leg goes still. "I saw you before you came to us, you know.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Cousin	We arrive at a compromise, a finely delineated covenant: I will keep an open mind and let bygones be bygones, and [MASK] will stop wooing me and wait a couple of years before touching my breasts again. We shall see how I feel about it then.
<name>Posy</name>	Posy	Peter	I ignore him. “What about your Rosy-[MASK]’s American mother? How is she?” the doctor suddenly asks. It’s hard to keep track of his abrupt shifts in conversation. “They left long ago,” I say. Caught off guard.
<name>Heer</name>	Heer	Sohni	The wide Chenab flows between their villages, separating the lovers. But late one night, slipping furtively from her village, risking treacherous currents and fierce reprisal, [MASK] floats across on an inflated buffalo hide to her lover.
<name>Rumi</name>	Rumi	Iqbal	Sometimes favor our rivals then sometimes with us You are free, I am sorry to say it so boldly. You are no less fickle than we. —[MASK]: “Complaint to God” My world is compressed.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Cousin	I try to fathom my emotions. “Maybe I don’t need to attract you. You’re already attracted,” I say. It is like that with [MASK]. He even shows me ME! I’ve admitted it before: I have a wayward heart.
<name>Ravi</name>	Ravi	Ayah	He gives me a turn round the backyard, grazing past the buffalo, the servants’ quarters and the Shankars’ veranda. He smells of tobacco, burnt whetstone and sweat. He brings me back and offers [MASK] a ride. “Sit in front: it’s safer,” he says.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Hamida	“Then why don’t you go to see them?” “Their father won’t like it.” “They must miss you. You could see them secretly, couldn’t you?" “No,” says [MASK], turning her face away.
<name>Ice-candy-man</name>	Ice-candy-man	Godmother	Her eyes are lowered and her head draped in a gold-fringed and gauzy red ghoongat. A jeweled tika nestles on her forehead and bunches of pearls and gold dangle from her ears. Ice-candy-man guides his rouged and lipsticked bride to sit beside [MASK].
<name>Blanche</name>	Blanche	Godmother	At last, shaking her head, [MASK] rotates her thumb against her temple; “A screw loose somewhere,” she says, looking dazed. "What’s to become of her, I don’t know... In heaven or in hell!”
<name>Mrs. Moore</name>	Mrs. Moore	Ayah	In the evenings he visits [MASK] and squatting like an ungainly bird in his cotton shawl astounds her with his knowledge of our wanderings. And when his driven toes are too weary to perform their amazing seduction, his glib tongue takes over.
<name>Gran</name>	Gran	Godmother	You’ve turned into a puppy have you?” says [MASK] pushing my face away. And when my teeth are pried away from her bloodied blouse and I at last look into Her shrewd, ancient eyes, I can tell her tongue is once again in her cheek.
<name>The Englishman</name>	The Englishman	Ranna	[MASK] stayed his ground. He could not bear to look at the Sikh. His stomach muscles felt like choked drains. But he stayed his ground: “I ms trembling from head to toe," he says. "O me-kiya! 1 say!”
<name>Lenny</name>	Lenny	Godmother	“How long has she been like this?” “Like how?” “Emptied of life? Despairing?" In a slow, coiling movement Ice-candy-man squats directly in front of [MASK]. “The past is behind her,” he says.
<name>Herbert</name>	Herbert	Cousin	“Kindly go about your business,” she tells her sister. “And stop messing with those papers! As it is, I can’t find anything when I want it.” “What is the matter with you?” [MASK] asks. “Nothing.”
<name>Humbert</name>	Humbert	Cousin	[MASK] turns in order to accommodate the rest of his body to his twisted neck and, focusing his eyes on my chest, carefully places his hands on my breasts. I draw back, slapping his hands till my palms sting, feeling sick and all shriveled up.
<name>Kim</name>	Kim	Ayah	The tongaman picks himself off the horse cursing: and the Birdwood Barracks’ sepoy abandons his post and runs forward to render help. [MASK]’s presence galvanizes men to mad sprints in the noon heat. It is a pity she has no such effect on animals though.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jack	Won’t you see them for just five minutes?” Since 1 can’t hear his response, and I’m determined to see him, I throw him a line: "All work and no play makes [MASK] a dull boy!” I know he’ll bite.
<name>Quaid-e-Azam</name>	Quaid-e-Azam	Jinnah	I blow out the candles and cut the squashed cake. And then we sit around the radio listening to the celebrations of the new Nation. [MASK]’s voice, inaugurating the Constituent Assembly sessions on August 11, says: “You are free.
<name>Amir</name>	Amir	Cousin	“It’s my kismet that’s no good... we are khut-putli, puppets, in the hands of fate.” “I don’t believe that,” I say. "[MASK] says we can change our kismet if we want to.
<name>Baby Suggs</name>	Baby Suggs	Ayah	“In the village, with her mother.” “What if she runs away?” “She won’t. They have no tailors in the village. No masseurs either.. . with their cunning fingers taking liberties!” [MASK] looks startled. So do I.
<name>Lenny</name>	Lenny	Adi	It is what he playfully calls only a little "masti”—a bit of naughtiness. And he tells me, “Lenny baby, don’t swear—swearwords don’t become you” I know. [MASK] can swear and it’s a big joke.
<name>Edgar</name>	Edgar	Adi	It is as sinister as ever. I take [MASK]’s word for it that it is open but I dare not lift the lid. I have no wish to be scared out of my wits: What if it’s a grinning, skeletal corpse?
<name>Ayah</name>	Ayah	Ayah	I dig my face in her sari and stretch up my hands. [MASK] tries to lift me but her fluid strength is gone. Her grip is weak. I hug her fiercely. Her heart beneath her springy breasts is fluttering like Ice-candy-man’s nervous sparrows.
<name>Jugdip</name>	Jugdip	Oye	A Sikh sepoy, his hair tied neatly in a khaki turban, ambled up to the other side of the wire. “[MASK]! What’re you making such a racket for? Scram!” he said, raising his hand in a threatening gesture.
<name>Ramses</name>	Ramses	Rodabai	Carry on... you must have everything your way, [MASK]. .. filling the child’s mind with such notions... mumble, mumble.” “Don’t you all right, all right me! I’ll have your carcass flown straight to the vultures!”
<name>Shanta</name>	Shanta	Adi	“I’ll teach you to be- have, you badmash!” She grins and holds [MASK] struggling in the powerful vise of her thighs. Raising her arms she calmly plaits her hair. We stir and stretch, preparing to break up for the evening.
<name>missing</name>	missing	Akalis	.. ?” The gramhi's genial face becomes uncommonly solemn. He rubs the puffy skin around his eyes and I notice how old and tired he looks. “I don’t know what to say,” he says, bowing his head. “They are [MASK]...
<name>June</name>	June	Ayah	[MASK] must be at the Recovered Women’s Camp! “Where is she—in the camp?” I ask, voicing my assumption. And feeling weak-kneed, I sit on the bed. “I saw her in a taxi.
<name>someone's</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone's (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Adi	I place it on a side plate, saving it for the end when I can chew and suck on it for long uninterrupted moments. I notice the movement of [MASK]’s eyeballs under his lids as they sneak to the comers, peer at the giblet and slip back.
<name>Christopher</name>	Christopher	Adi	By the time I dispel the fears of the jungle and peep out of my quilt, [MASK] is already out of bed. A great chunk of his life is lived apart: He goes to a regular school. Spring flowers, birds and butterflies scent and color the air.
<name>Lenny</name>	Lenny	Ayah	[MASK] returns the coin to Ice-candy-man. “Keep it. It’s for you,” he says grandly, folding her fingers over it. “No,” she says, shaking her head and hiding her hands behind her back.
<name>doctor</name>	doctor	Heads	Have you ever heard of amoebic dysentery being cured just like that?” She snaps her fingers. [MASK] nod again and eyes widen in wonder as the spell of my mother’s voice conjures the Jewish doctor into a savage wizard and my cure into a feat of unparalleled sorcery.
<name>Kamau</name>	Kamau	Papoo	I know, then, that like [MASK], he really cares for me. I let him limp without comment. In return, he shows me how to mold a replica of his village with dung. And, looking generously and intently into my eyes, he permits me to feel his belly button.
<name>Mammachi</name>	Mammachi	Godmother	But, preceded by the slave. [MASK] comes. She sits by my bed stroking me, smiling, her eyes twinkling concern, in her gray going-out sari, its pretty border of butterflies pinned to iron strands of scant combed-back hair.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Slavesister	She catches my watering eye and winks. Only I ever see her wink. Her dignified bearing and noble features preclude winking. She only relaxes her guard with me. No one sees her as I do. [MASK] is snatching a few blessed minutes of sleep in the last row.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Hari	1 feel a great swell of fear for [MASK], and a surge of loathing for his bodhi. Why must he persist in growing it? And flaunt his Hinduism? And invite ridicule? And that preposterous and obscene dhoti!
<name>John</name>	John	Cousin	“Is your stomach hurting?” [MASK] asks cautiously, afraid of a rebuff. I’m grateful that he has stayed his ground at least and not gone tearing off on some pretext to avoid my irrational outburst. “No.” I shake my head.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Cousin	She counts out eight little candles from an economy-sized box of fifty. [MASK] returns with brown paper bags and a dented cardboard cake box. I blow out the candles and cut the squashed cake. And then we sit around the radio listening to the celebrations of the new Nation.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Ayah	[MASK] is nervous in his presence, given to sudden movement; her goddess-like calm replaced by breath-stopping shyness. They don’t touch. He leans across his bicycle, talking, and she shifts from foot to foot, smiling, ducking and twisting spherically.
<name>Salvatore</name>	Salvatore	Ayah	“Doesn’t anyone else know about it?” enquires my stupefied, mystified and circumspect cousin. “Only your mothers,” says [MASK]. “We do the loading and the unloading when everyone’s asleep. We cover the cans with sheets and tablecloths.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ranna	Roaring, waving swords, partly obscured by the veil of dust raised by their trampling feet, they approached the village. [MASK] flew down the steep steps. He ran in and out of the empty houses looking for a place to hide. The mob sounded close.
<name>Father Karras</name>	Father Karras	Adi	[MASK] is so excited, and so nervous that the exorcism may not materialize—or take place in his absence—that he dances from foot to foot and has tears in his eyes. “Oh, all right!”
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Yousaf	We stop along a trimmed gardenia hedge to look at the sunken rose garden; and we clamber up the slopes of artificial hills and run down bougainvillea valleys ablaze with winter flowers. Casting long shadows we take a path leading to where [MASK] has parked his cycle.
<name>He</name>	He	Cousin	He doesn’t like me seeing all those boys—or all those boys looking at me. Besides, he’s embarrassed to be seen associating with such a skinny girl. [MASK] is flushed and sweaty and weighed down by his school-bag.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Ranna	Suddenly [MASK] remembered where he was and the darkness became charged with terror. “We know you’re in there. Come on, open up!” The noise of the banging was deafening in the pitch-black room, drowning the other children’s alarmed cries.
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	Oldhusband	I can’t believe it. I am so astonished my jaw hangs open (ever since, I’ve had trouble with my mandibular). Hung-jawed I go to [MASK], and standing before him in a daze, say, “It’s my birthday.”
