<name>Doodle</name>	Doodle	Peter	“Poor little [MASK]! He was three years my senior; but he was small and not overly strong, and so I always felt I must look after him. He was honest and true and with a gentle spirit in his heart.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Walter	An intense exhilaration had gripped [MASK]. They were in the castle, and it should now be possible to carry out the full plan, his plan. The unfortunate prisoners would be rescued. “What would she think of the nameless rascal, if she knew?”
<name>Scheherazade</name>	Scheherazade	Maryam	There is only one way to get you free, [MASK], and that is to claim you as my wife. If you wish it that way, touch the curtain again.” The curtain moved a second time. “We must be very careful.
<name>Lucie</name>	Lucie	Walter	“I have one consolation, however. My grandson and I,” turning his head to smile and nod at [MASK], “have an enforced silence of more than twenty years to make up for. Ah, how our tongues will wag! We shall sit late tonight.”
<name>Emmie</name>	Emmie	Mahmoud	We must go on as we are. Great lady must still keep her face black. People outside must still think her second boy. That means she must do some work so they won’t know anything different. But, [MASK], she is small and not strong.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Mahmoud	[MASK] returned at this point, and it was apparent he was upset over something also. He gave the impression of a pariah dog slinking along with its tail between its legs. His mouth drooped, his eyes were filled with the deepest woe.
<name>Yukio</name>	Yukio	Walter	Marriage is the greatest of all lotteries, and I am happy my brother has drawn a prize for himself. Let us hope this wife will fulfill the expectations of Her Imperial Munificence by giving him many sons.” “It is a consummation much to be hoped for, kind elder brother,” said [MASK].
<name>Cassius</name>	Cassius	Wat	It was not in the stars, [MASK], for us to die like rats in this filthy river.” A moment later he asked, in a tone of sudden anxiety, “Do you think there will be any delay in sending the other skiff across?”
<name>Countess</name>	Countess	Walter	“I have nothing but contempt for him,” she said then. “No, I prefer to wait for him here. I cannot allow him to think I fear him in the least.” [MASK] did not make any effort to change her mind.
<name>Robin</name>	Robin	Tristram	You’ve seen how closely the enclosure is guarded. If we got her out of it, where could we take her?” “The chance to do something will come,” declared [MASK], confidently. “But if it doesn’t come, we must make it.”
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Walter	“If what you surmise is true,” said [MASK] slowly, “she has overlooked one point. I am not in a position to court her. I am a married man.” His grandfather protested this with an impatient frown. “An annulment must be secured at Once.
<name>Dr. Watson</name>	Dr. Watson	Joseph	“He is my son!” he said to himself. “It is hard enough to believe my wife has been restored to me. But this! This passes belief!” “Yer lady has fainted,” said the voice of [MASK] at his shoulder.
<name>Sancho</name>	Sancho	Walter	[MASK] clapped him joyously on the back. “My stout friend! I knew what you were going to say; I had no doubts about it at all.” Then he added affectionately: “Thou very idiot!
<name>Van Helsing</name>	Van Helsing	Walter	[Blood! Blood!]” Their treble voices had an almost inhuman quality. “Do they never get enough of blood?” asked [MASK]. The targets were now set up for the archery contests, and the spectators formed in two long lines.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Tris	It must seem like a betrayal, [MASK]; but I swear it could not be delayed, and I did not know then you had come back. There would have been no time in any event, but I wish it had been possible to tell you first.”
<name>her</name>	her	Maryam	But after these things fell unearned into my lap, I found I cared for them least of all. And this is all we have saved! All the gold and precious stones in the world can’t bring [MASK] back!” He turned back fiercely.
<name>Sacajawea</name>	Sacajawea	Maryam	“She has been fetched and will now appear,” he said. “An interpreter accompanies her, a man of many tongues. He will be able to unravel her story for us.” When [MASK] entered the room, a buzz of surprised comment rose from the company.
<name>Godzilla</name>	Godzilla	Tristram	With little effort, [MASK] raised him from the ground and proceeded to shake him until the yellow-skinned head spun back and forth and the bowed legs wambled like those of a scarecrow in a heavy wind. Then he gave the body a toss which sent it rolling over and over on the ground.
<name>she</name>	she	Maryam	As a matter of habit he thought, “If [MASK] could only see me!” The words had no sooner formed in his mind than all sense of pride left him. He went to the window and gazed out unhappily at the gathering storm.
<name>Jim's</name>	Jim's	Tristram	It had been his determination which had brought them to this cruel, strange land, and [MASK]’s death could be laid at his door. His face was white and his hands shook when he returned to his seat with the others.
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Walter	[MASK] made no answer. Suddenly the face of the merchant, which had regained its normal color in the warmth, began to change again. A red tint seemed to center around his eyes. Then it spread, like a smolder of fire, to all parts of his broad countenance.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Walter	He was sound asleep before the tallow dip had been extinguished, his long legs stretched out straight. When [MASK] roused at dawn, his companion was in exactly the same position; apparently he had not moved a muscle during the night.
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Walter	[MASK]’s heart seemed to tighten in his chest. This would be a heady adventure, and he knew he might not come out of it alive. “Wrap your cloak around your arm,” advised the bowman’s son. “It will serve as a shield.
<name>The narrator</name>	The narrator	Walter	They drew to one side of the road to let the proud cavalcade pass. [MASK] caught the glitter of an arrogant eye behind the bars of the steel vizor and knew that the gallant traveler counted him of low degree and so unfit for as much as a passing hail.
<name>Bimala</name>	Bimala	Maryam	It was clear that the strangers were the cause of it, for, as the two men talked over their platter of curried rice and sea food, he kept a wary eye on the screen behind which [MASK] and her son carried on their restricted existence.
<name>Sita</name>	Sita	Maryam	With these you could never be in want, even if we should be separated at any time.” [MASK] looked at the gems in her hand with a worried frown. “I think it is time you began to teach me to speak English,” she said.
<name>Prince John</name>	Prince John	Ninian	Your arm, fair guest.” [MASK] scowled at being thus passed over. As he fell into line behind the boy page, he muttered, “Things are coming to a strange pass when lackland adventurers are honored above men of honest birth.”
<name>son</name>	son	Walter	My son can now be raised like any other English boy. Soon he won’t even remember about me. I have tried so hard to find my [MASK], but—it is better this way.” Chapter Eighteen Leeds Castle FOR THREE HOURS
<name>Rainsford</name>	Rainsford	Walter	His eyes were wide open, but fixed and without expression. “Drugged!” thought [MASK], exultantly. The custodian had been faithful to his trust to the extent of lashing the overhead lever in position with a length of rope.
<name>untouchable</name>	untouchable	Christians	These people do not like you because you are [MASK]. They will have nothing to do with you. You are always supposed to ride in the rear of the caravan and to set up your tent at night on the edge of the camp.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Hal	“Take a good look at this young gentleman, [MASK],” directed the priest. “Some time this night he will be wanting to return, and he will give you a special knock. Three quick and then two slow. Like this.”
<name>Legolas</name>	Legolas	Walter	“You saved our lives,” said [MASK]. He realized now that his knees were close to the point of buckling under him. The Mongol horsemen were sitting in a sullen silence, and not one of them had given a sign of approval for the unmatchable shot.
<name>Balin</name>	Balin	Horteema	What a perfect plan is this one I have conceived! We will send her with [MASK]. After all, he is in no position to make great demands, and so we shall be able to satisfy him and still retain a good share of the stone’s value for ourselves.”
<name>Mother</name>	Mother	Hugh	She was a pretty enough slut, when she got the flour and salt off her face, but she had no better than half a mind. She died in child-bed.” His expression sobered. “Did you look closely at my poor [MASK]?
<name>The narrator</name>	The narrator	Walter	He shook his head. “Ad impossible nemo tenetus, ” he said. “They would spit us like herrings if we tried to rush them.” More clerks were pouring onto the Quadrivium. [MASK] was sure they could force a rescue by sheer weight of numbers.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Walter	[MASK] looked at his grandfather, unexpectedly ensconced in his chair on the dais. It was surprising enough that he had summoned up the strength to come down; but, in addition, he was festively attired in his best velvet cloak with wide bands of miniver and a collar of the same.
<name>John</name>	John	Walter	The boy would have been thrown off if the rider’s other arm had not clasped him tightly. It was a full minute before their talk was resumed. “He is a very stem man, your grandfather. He does not speak to me, [MASK].”
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Walter	She asked in renewed alarm, “Where is it?” “Dead,” answered [MASK]. He was becoming acutely aware that he was supporting her bare shoulders with one arm and that her breasts were pressed against him.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Walter	We are poor subjects if we stand humbly by and see them broken!” Conscious of the curious eyes and ready ears of the workers, [MASK] took his friend by the arm and led him in the direction of the house. “What do you plan to do?”
<name>The mother</name>	The mother	Engaine	The law was all on the side of the father in the matter of the child and would compel her to return him; and so it was wise to lay her case before them without the handicap of his illegal possession. [MASK] had given in with the greatest reluctance.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Walter	When anyone is near, I will keep my head down.” “Those blue eyes of yours are certain to give you away.” “I will always keep them lowered. I will wear my hat down over them. Please, [MASK], it is my only hope!”
<name>Aragorn</name>	Aragorn	Walter	He was a good comrade as well as a brave man-at-arms.” There was a moment’s silence, and then [MASK] drew the parchment from his pocket. “We have no wish to involve you in our troubles,” he said.
<name>Edmund</name>	Edmund	Walter	Fit reason indeed for laughter, the two bastard sons of one father sitting side by side and neither of them aware of the other! [MASK] sank back in his seat in such abject misery that he heard not another word as long as he remained in the church.
<name>Prester</name>	Prester	Cathay	She took advantage of the slightest pause to ask questions across the old man. Was [MASK] as fabulous a land as everyone supposed? Had he brought many curious things back with him? Had he not gained a better opinion of the fine king?
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Walter	“The Bore runs sometimes as high as twenty feet, and no skiff could face it; but there is still time to reach your ship on the other side.” [MASK] felt his arms gripped on each side and rough voices commanding him to step ahead.
<name>Juliet</name>	Juliet	Engaine	You know that. But I have always known that nothing could come of it.” “[MASK], listen to me. I will return soon, and perhaps then your father will give his consent. You are too young to wed now.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Tristram	“But she is half English, that much is clear. I don’t suppose we will be able to find out anything more about her now.” “That is enough. I wish—” [MASK] hesitated and then shook his head.
<name>Miller</name>	Miller	Hal	Was [MASK] of the mill sleeping or had he been relieved from duty? It was an anxious moment. He knocked again. No response. A complete silence still reigned inside. He had just about given up hope when he heard a hand fumbling at the lock inside.
<name>Marco Polo</name>	Marco Polo	Walter	A cheerful air of activity prevailed in the household sections of the Great Interior Palace. When [MASK] and his guide reached the Courtyard of Contented Domestics, the former marveled that so much ease of mind could be found with the threat of death and rapine looming over the city.
<name>Robin</name>	Robin	Mahmoud	She realized then that much time had passed. The sun no longer shone on the windows, and the shutters had been opened to admit more air. The room seemed to be filled with people. [MASK] was there, and the friendly innkeeper, and the leather merchant.
<name>John</name>	John	Walter	asked [MASK], nodding in the direction of the rent. As he did so, he gasped with fresh surprise. The dagger had been left there! Its weight had caused it to slip through further, and the whole of the blade could now be seen.
<name>Mei</name>	Mei	Walter	It was a two-storied affair and was painted a glaring vermilion, with pictures of black dragons and white tigers on the comers. But what attracted [MASK] most was the figure of a fairy with gold-tipped wings, with an arm outstretched, perched on the top.
<name>love</name>	love	Engaine	“I am afraid I have allowed her to drag out all I know about your lady [MASK]. She asked me all manner of questions. I am sure you haven’t noticed it, but she likes you a very great deal.
<name>Captain</name>	Captain	Tristram	The mob was in an ugly mood. The city is full of men with empty bellies, and they may have tried to storm the rice warehouses.” After a long pause, [MASK] asked, “Will they hold the ship, think you?”
<name>Moses</name>	Moses	Moses	The door of the chapel, which faced them, had the Lessford quar-terings carved in the stone on each side and a great window above with stained glass showing [MASK] and the Burning Bush. The priest turned a key in the lock and motioned him to go in.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Walter	“I’ll have no more of this endless packing and unpacking, this mewling over sheets and blankets, and running for hot possets and espic-ier’s pills! We ride straight through, I tell you.” He turned for a final besotted word with [MASK].
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Walter	[MASK] nodded and got to his feet. “How long will you be on duty here?” he asked. “Till midnight. Knock loud if ye come back. I’m old and rheumy, and I fall to sleep easy.”
<name>Siddhartha</name>	Siddhartha	Chilprat	[MASK] then moistened it with a wet finger and held it up to the light. He tapped it with his long fingernails, rubbed it on the wool of his loincloth, and finally said in a whisper to the priest: “It is a good one.
<name>Robin</name>	Robin	Tris	“This makes sorry hearing, [MASK], my friend. But rest assured that justice will be done. The Norman woman will pay for her crime. The King’s men will see to that in due course.”
<name>Montgomery</name>	Montgomery	Walter	Then it spread, like a smolder of fire, to all parts of his broad countenance. His eyes fixed themselves on [MASK] with a vicious intentness. In a low thin voice he said slowly, “You can have no conception how she will suffer for what she has done.”
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	Walter	“I expect to be married soon.” “To your fair cousin, no doubt?” [MASK]’s smile grew into a full laugh. “That will account for this great indignation you feel over the return of the lands to their rightful owner.
<name>Columbus</name>	Columbus	Walter	The journey home had been disillusioning in many ways. Often the ships they were on had remained tied up in port for many days because of cloudy weather, and [MASK] had paced the decks, berating himself for his carelessness in losing the magnetic needle which would have freed commerce from such delays.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Wat	Naturally you were supposed to share.” “Come, [MASK], don’t let your kindness of heart run away with you. I have no claim to this; and no special desire to have any of it. What would I do with it?”
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Walter	“It would make the stain run; and that would not do, would it? But I know—I know that I shall never see you again!” Despite her resolution, her large eyes were beginning to fill. “Oh, [MASK], I love you so much!”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Walter	The thin lips were in continuous motion, although [MASK]’s senses were too dulled with pain to catch any sound. As he emerged from this first phase, he began slowly to grasp the details of his existence. He was lying in a square room with log walls.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Walter	In the circumstances he decided to try the boots his father had left him. They had been hidden away with the standing cup in a sack filled with bits of old clothes. [MASK] produced them reluctantly, not happy at the need of putting them to so menial a use.
<name>Tyrion</name>	Tyrion	Walter	What could a shaveling like you do for me that they can’t?” [MASK] laughed, realizing that the plan he had thought of when the war was first mentioned was taking hold on the merchant’s mind. “Is it necessary to put the answer into words?
<name>Aziza</name>	Aziza	Unakina	She stood and watched him for a moment in silence. “White man go?” she asked finally. “Yes, [MASK]. Go with caravan.” He detached the buckle from his belt which contained a setting of turquoise and opals, and held it out to her.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Walter	Still you may be right; you so often are. I shall now strive to make amends for my headlong approach.” He got to his feet and walked over to [MASK] with long strides. “A very odd story has come to my ears.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Maryam	The fickle weather had taken a turn for the worse, and a raw wind was blowing, causing a loose walrus skin to beat against the top of the pole with the insistence of drumbeats. Finally [MASK] got to her feet: “We are very dismal company tonight.
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Walter	“You are large for your age, [MASK]. But that, after all, is what might be expected. I think you are inclined to favor— But, come, I must say no more about that.
<name>Ignatius</name>	Ignatius	Walter	[MASK] was both puzzled and disturbed. “I have never given this matter much thought,” he said. “I have always been taught to believe the so-called sciences vague and full of theory, too lacking in reality. There is no logic in science.”
<name>Tintin</name>	Tintin	Anthemus	[MASK] saw that he meant it and sighed. “You English are a tight-fisted race,” he complained. The Mongolians were careless of the loot they had acquired so easily, and the last occupant of the yurt had left a Chinese cord belt dangling from a peg on the central support.
<name>Salim</name>	Salim	Walter	[MASK] untied it. He kept a firm hand on the lever after advancing it no more than an inch. He would change it slowly, he decided. There would be direction-wise eyes in the caravan to detect any radical change in the course.
<name>Kublai</name>	Kublai	Bayan	He studied the priest closely. “It has become necessary to send a messenger to the Mongolian camp, and I am sure it would be wise for you to go. You can return when the city is in [MASK]’s hands and begin your work without interference.”
<name>Mr. Bennet</name>	Mr. Bennet	Walter	She had an amusing gift of mimicry. Often on their walks she would fall a few respectful paces behind [MASK], teetering along with short steps, her hands folded under her cuffs. She would ask in a singsong tone, “Does estimable husband still esteem small and humble wife?”
<name>Mr. Gatsby</name>	Mr. Gatsby	Walter	“A short visit, [MASK], and one long overdue.” “I came to thank you,” he answered, “for your more than generous attitude in the matter of the land.” She gave him a quick side glance.
<name>The Tin Woodman</name>	The Tin Woodman	Maryam	From the inside the scaly brass figure presented an entirely different aspect. It seemed suddenly to have become benevolent, and its protruding eyes were fixed on them with the regard of a faithful guardian. [MASK] began to laugh with relief. “I feel better already!”
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Walter	Both men went into roars of laughter, and [MASK] said, “You had better use it to look at yourself.” The discovery of the mirror had interrupted her in the midst of her ablutions, and there was still a smudge of black over one eye and on the tip of her nose.
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Maryam	Then, quite as suddenly, the animation died out of his voice. “But I am afraid my friend has offered up his life to teach them! And to save us!” “I knew it,” said [MASK] in a whisper.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Walter	“He says he is pleased we are married,” said [MASK] to her. “And knowing how truly unselfish he is, I am certain he means it. I am very much afraid I would have been less philosophic if our positions had been reversed.”
<name>Miss Jane Marple</name>	Miss Jane Marple	Walter	exclaimed [MASK]. “Generous?” The master of Gurnie smiled. “Yes, it was generous. I think, however, it was something more. It was wise on her part and—well, farseeing.” “I do not follow your reasoning.
<name>Marco Polo</name>	Marco Polo	Bayan	A servant, who had been sleeping with his back against the center pole, and snoring loudly, roused as though by instinct and placed a chair opposite that of his master. [MASK] turned back the loose sleeves of his robe with an air of eagerness.
<name>Robinson</name>	Robinson	Maryam	“[MASK], if it is indeed you, where are you? What unhappy thoughts are in your mind? Have you given up hope after all these weary days?” He closed the windows and lay down on his lumpy and far from fresh bed.
<name>Conan</name>	Conan	Tristram	[MASK] had not understood a word, but he had grasped the situation from the scurvy appearance of the mounts provided for them. He took the bow from his back and brought it down with a loud thwack across the skinny shins of the nearest of the jeering onlookers.
<name>Montmorency</name>	Montmorency	Walter	“As you see, I speak some Greek.” “Very badly.” “I am well equipped with Latin and French. I even know a little Arabic.” [MASK] was thinking, “How lucky I was in the course I selected!”
<name>Franklin</name>	Franklin	Walter	The sheets of pulp on the frames needed warmth, and so a large reredos had been placed in the center, and the logs in it blazed briskly. [MASK]’s plans to harness millstones had not passed the experimental stage, and all the work still was done by hand.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Maryam	There was a pause. “If—if things go wrong, our kind Father in heaven may deem us worthy to meet in a kindlier world than this.” The most difficult of his farewells must now be said. He walked over to [MASK].
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Armstraung	“Young sirs, young sirs,” he cried. “I did not know we had witnesses! No whisper of this must get out. We must think of the good name of the Hall.” “We’ll keep mum,” grumbled [MASK].
<name>John</name>	John	Tris	I was not proposing a whole rape of land, cut up into tenant farms and game preserves. I knew you too well to suggest anything of that kind. But after all, [MASK], you are of yeoman stock. You belong on the land.
<name>Red Sonja</name>	Red Sonja	Helen	He is a bag of decrepit bones, but still he is the strongest of the three, and I suggest the wisdom of the Tall One riding him. Then there is [MASK]. Not,” with a titter, “that men fight over her.
<name>Simon</name>	Simon	Walter	The contents spilled out on the bed, and [MASK]’s fingers came on a smaller bag concealed in the grains of com. It was of velvet, tied tightly with a leather string and with the gules crosslet of Bulaire embroidered on its side.
<name>Galahad</name>	Galahad	Walter	“It is looking straight at me! It doesn’t want to let me in.” [MASK] laughed. “I would give battle to a live dragon in behalf of my lady. Have you no faith in my power to defend her from one of brass?”
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Tris	I know I can never hope to live again as a law-abiding citizen, but I am English, and here I shall stay until I die!” “Listen to me, [MASK]. Things are going to change.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Walter	“[MASK], it is only by the merest chance that I see you. Who knows, I may never see you again! There is something I want you to know, and so I must speak of it now.” He paused for a long time.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Walter	“His father is fond of the boy. That is the one consolation I have in giving in to you. He will be treated well when he reaches home.” After two days of discussion, some of it quite heated, [MASK] had won his point.
<name>Marco</name>	Marco	Walter	“But it is not old, and it is the antiquity of porcelains which sets their value. Still it is good.” “That is not for sale,” declared [MASK]. “It is my purpose to present it to the King when he grants me an audience.”
<name>Zara</name>	Zara	Tristram	He added in an undertone, “We have the smartest thief in the whole caravan.” [MASK] dipped into the kettle again for the drumstick of a chicken and heaved a deep sigh. “Do you suppose she is all right?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Walter	The mood in which [MASK] had been sunk ever since the reading of the will, a combination of prideful anger and despairing certainty that the whole world was against him, began to lift as he conned the possibilities suggested by this note from his father.
<name>Menelaus</name>	Menelaus	Anthemus	When the girl shook her head, the woman went into a long and vehement tirade. [MASK] became impatient. “Enough of this talk,” he said, in Greek. “My mind is made up. Go back where you belong and be ready to obey when the time comes.”
