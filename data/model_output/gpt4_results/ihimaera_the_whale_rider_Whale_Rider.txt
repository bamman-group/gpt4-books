<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Kahu	Divorce tomorrow, I mean it this time.” Then she remembered something and, after taking [MASK] from me, pulled my ear. Ouch. “And that’ll teach you to take my great-grandchild gallivanting all over the place. I’ve been scared to death.
<name>Time</name>	Time	Death	He even tried to defeat [MASK], but failed. As he grew in his arrogance, he started to drive a wedge through the original oneness of the world. In the passing of Time he divided the world into that half he could believe in and that half he could not believe in.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Jeff	Leave him.” Her words were high-pitched, frenzied. "Oh. Oh. Oh.” The station wagon careered past me. I will never forget [MASK]’s white face, so pallid, so fearful. The second event occurred after the inquest.
<name>Adah</name>	Adah	Kahu	But most of all, he had not wanted an eldest girl-child in [MASK]'s genera-Sinn; he had warned an eldest boy-child, somebody more appropriate to teach the traditions of the village to.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Kahu	Although we weren’t that well educated, the boys and I enjoyed the lessons every weekend. It soon became obvious that [MASK] did, also. She would sneak up to the door of the meetinghouse and stare in at us.
<name>Wilbur</name>	Wilbur	Sophie	Others, however, stayed on. For them, their whale had become a member of the family. “And I cant leave [MASK] now,” an elderly lady said. The sun scattered its spokes across the sand. The whales kept dying.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Nanny	and I gunned our motors, just for her. Some of [MASK]’s old cronies were crossing; when they saw her through the blue smoke, they almost swallowed their false teeth. "Oh, my goodness,” they said. “Who is this?”
<name>Tikatok</name>	Tikatok	Paikea	For he remembered that [MASK] had hesitated before throwing the last of his wooden spears, and when he did this, he had said, “Let this spear be planted in the years to come when the people are troubled and it is most needed.”
<name>Kahu</name>	Kahu	Kahu	The skin felt like very smooth, slippery rubber. Without really thinking about it, [MASK] began to stroke the whale just behind the fin. It is my lord, the whale rider. She felt a tremor in the whale and a rippling under the skin.
<name>Moby</name>	Moby	Kahu	And a lump would come to my throat and I would think to myself, No, [MASK], I won’t forget you, ever. Then the final tragedy of the movie began. The whale, wounded, was dying in its own blood.
<name>Pani</name>	Pani	Maori	“Te mea te mea,” she said. “Yeah, yeah, yeah, you old goat.” We had a big family dinner that night with [MASK] bread and crayfish and lots of wine to drink.
<name>Judy</name>	Judy	Nanny	Don’t let her know what has happened.” [MASK]’s eyes glistened. She nodded her head. I got on my motorcycle and went round rousing the boys. I hadn't realized it before, but when you catch people off guard you sure find out a lot about them.
<name>Kai</name>	Kai	Kahu	She had decided to join us. “I can’t stand to hear the old paka feeling sorry for himself. Mmmm, what a beautiful day! The sun is shining." We rowed out past the bay and [MASK] asked again about the stone.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Kahu	She was hanging on to the whales forward fin. For a moment I thought my imagination was playing tricks. Earlier, the whale had been lying on its left side. But now it was rolling onto its stomach. Then I felt afraid that in the rolling [MASK] would get squashed.
<name>Wakantanka</name>	Wakantanka	Paikea	how empty our tea hac heennje" eW In the evening after our lesson on the sea, we assembled in the meetinghouse. The booming on the open waters had heralded the coming of a rainstorm. As I went into the meetinghouse, I glanced up at our ancestor [MASK].
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Kahu	With relief I saw that [MASK] was okay. She was hanging on to the whales forward fin. For a moment I thought my imagination was playing tricks. Earlier, the whale had been lying on its left side. But now it was rolling onto its stomach.
<name>Moby</name>	Moby	Paikea	“My man,” she breathed with slyness, threading her words with sensuous major arpeggios, “the rider that you carry isn’t [MASK].” The other female whales edged away carefully, but they secretly admired the courage of the old mother whale in questioning the identity of the whale rider.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Kahu	Everything was fine, really, for most of the film, because [MASK] soon fell asleep. Having her curled up so close to me made me feel protective, like a father, I guess, and I think my bonding to her was confirmed that night.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Slimmer	If he had told her he loved dogs, I'm sure she would have barked, “ Woof woof.” That’s how much she loved him. [MASK] is always shearing fpr US) and that summer the boys and I got a contract rn shea*- Ir.^1 farmers around the coast.
<name>Hinemoa</name>	Hinemoa	Tern	So she chanted special prayers, asking the Gods ro give her the right and open the way for her to take charge. Then she cried, “E-i! [MASK], kia whakatane ake au i abau!" Now I shall make myself a man.
<name>Kahu</name>	Kahu	Paikea	The other female whales edged away carefully, but they secretly admired the courage of the old mother whale in questioning the identity of the whale rider. “Yes, it is [MASK],” the bull whale said, insistent.
<name>Moana</name>	Moana	Muriwai	While they were away, however, the sea began to rise and the current carried the canoe so close to the rocks that [MASK] knew all on board would surely perish. So she chanted special prayers, asking the Gods ro give her the right and open the way for her to take charge.
<name>awaited</name>	awaited	Peaiktua	Their leader was totally ensnared in the rhapsody of his dreams of the golden rider. So long part of their own genealogy and legend, the golden rider could not he dislodged from their leader’s thoughts. The last journey had begun, and at the end of it [MASK]* waiting.
<name>Neptune</name>	Neptune	Tangaroa	In those days there was still communion with the Gods and a close relationship between land inhabitants and ocean inhabitants. Whenever man wished to cross the border between his kingdom and that of the ocean, he would honor [MASK] by making offerings of seaweed, fish, or birds.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Teff	He’s had a run of rotten luck with the workers this year, and you know what the natives are like, always drinking.” "T’ll haw- rr» gn," said [MASK], I knew he was reluctant to do so.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Porourangi	“Look.” The whale was already half submerged, spouting in its distress. Three elderly females had managed to come beside him and were trying to nudge him upright before he drowned. "Now," [MASK] cried. The two tractors coughed into life.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Nanny	“I came down to welcome you home,” she would explain. "[MASK] doesn’t want any help today. Can I have a ride on your bike? I can? Oh, neat." She would clamber on behind me and hold on tight.
<name>Karana</name>	Karana	Kahu	She raised her head and began to call to the whale. The wind snatched at her words and flung them with the foam to smash in the wind. [MASK] tried again. “Oh, sacred ancestor," she called. “I am coming to you.
<name>Myrtle</name>	Myrtle	Kahu	Nobody knew at all until she was halfway through the waves. Then the headlights and spotlights from the cars along the beach picked up her white dress and that little head bobbing up and down in the waves. As soon as I saw her, I knew it was [MASK].
<name>nodded</name>	nodded	Korn	And there, and mark. In this way the fishing places of all our fish species have always been known. And we have tried never to trespass on the fishing grounds of others, because their guardians would recognize us as interlopers.” 'ffySL Then [MASK].

<name>Gerty</name>	Gerty	Kahu	The boys and! still kick around, and although some of my girlfriends have tried hard to tempt me away from it, my first love is still my motorcycle. Once a biker always a biker.^j^jj Looking back, I can truthfully say that [MASK] was never forgotten by me and the boys.
<name>Jonah</name>	Jonah	Jonah	I panicked and I lost sight of her, and I thought that she had been swept into the whales huge mouth. I was almost sick thinking about it, but then I remembered that [MASK] had lived on in the belly of his whale.
<name>Quint</name>	Quint	Koro	“We could pull him out by boat,” I suggested. "No, too dangerous,” [MASK] replied. "The sea is running too high. The other whales are in the way. No, we wait. And we pray.”
<name>Kahu</name>	Kahu	Paikea	She looked up at [MASK]. "He’s not ready yet,” she said. The sea seemed to be trembling with anticipation. Haumi e, hui e, taiki e. Let it be done. WINTER Wkale Song, Whale Rider FOURTEEN
<name>Alveron</name>	Alveron	Paka	"There is no place for it here in this world. The people who once commanded it are no longer here.” He paused. “When it dies, we die. I die." "No, [MASK]. And if it lives?”
<name>Te Rangi</name>	Te Rangi	Kahu	She took a quick look around to make sure no one was watching us. The sea hissed and surged through her words. "This is where the birth cord will bp phmli”-f;hf niH "t ^i^hf-nf Te Rangi, after whom [MASK] has been named.
<name>foresight</name>	foresight	Rehuas	Ynnr hirrh cord is here. No matter where you may go, you will always return. You will never be lost to us.” Then I marveled at her wisdom and [MASK] in naming the child in our genealogy and the joining of her to our lands.
<name>Guinea</name>	Guinea	Nature	[MASK] will take it all back. Sometimes, when you yourself are living life to the full, you forget that life elsewhere also continues to change like a chameleon. For instance. I used to marvel at the nationalism sweeping Papua N<»w ?r>
<name>Teeka</name>	Teeka	Kahu	yeah, yeah," he would say. "Te mea te mea.” “He didn’t growl at [MASK] any more than usual,” I answered. "He just doesn’t like her hanging around when we have the school, that’s all.”
<name>Alex</name>	Alex	Jeff	The man turned. His arms came up, as if he was trying to defend himself. The front bumper crunched into his thighs and legs and he was catapulted into the windshield, which smashed into a thousand fragments. [MASK] braked. The glass was suddenly splashed with blood.
<name>Ahab</name>	Ahab	Paikea	The ancient bull whale waved the warrior whales away; he was getting irritated with them and their fancy drills. “Think back?" he repeated to himself. And through the mists of time he saw his master, [MASK], flinging wooden spears into the sky.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Nanny	Old lady! You’re supposed to put the phone to your ear so you can hear!" [MASK] disliked telephones; most times she was so shaken to hear a voice come out of little holes in the receiver that she would hold the phone at arm’s length.
<name>Enrique</name>	Enrique	Kahu	He began to communicate his joy to all parts of his body. Out beyond the breakwater, the herd suddenly became alert. With hope rising, they began to sing their encouragement to their leader. "[MASK], no,” I cried again. I panicked
<name>Ramsey</name>	Ramsey	Bernard	The second event occurred after the inquest. [MASK] had died on the road that night. Who's to say that he would have lived had we taken him to a hospital? It was an accident, of course. A native walking carelessly on the side of the road.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Kahu	Her and her blinking hat.” I was laughing too hard to answer. In the backseat, [MASK] was adding some feathers and flowers and what looked like weeds. The strange thing was that, in fact, the additions made the hat just right.
<name>Marina</name>	Marina	Kahu	If the whale lives, we live. These were the only words [MASK] could think of. The water was freezing, but not to worry. The waves were huge, but she could do this. The rain was like spears, but she could do this.
<name>Jonah</name>	Jonah	Porourangi	“The sea came up so sudden,” [MASK] yelled above the waves. “Look.” The whale was already half submerged, spouting in its distress. Three elderly females had managed to come beside him and were trying to nudge him upright before he drowned.
<name>Shea</name>	Shea	Kahu	and I got a contract rn shea*- Ir.^1 farmers around the coast. On the first few mornings when [MASK] was at home, I would see her staring at us over the windowsill as we left. Her eyes seemecT tcTsajrT
<name>Kahu</name>	Kahu	Kahu	It sounded as if she was warning them. The orcas suddenly dived. Hui e, haumi e, taiki e. Let it be done. EIGHT T he following summer, when [MASK] was three, it was dry and dusty on the coast.
<name>Elanna</name>	Elanna	Rehua	[MASK]. weak, anri frightened after the birth, had wanted ro honor her husband by choosing a name from his people, not hers. That way, should she die, at least her firstborn child would be linked to her father’s people and land.
<name>Essie</name>	Essie	Kahu	She would sit with [MASK] in her arms, rocking in the chair on the veranda, watching the men walk past. “There go the Ku Klux Klan,” she would say loudly so that we could all hear.
<name>Almira</name>	Almira	Nanny	Tl-<g niflrkf f-iHinrr qmVUy We followed [MASK] as she went back and forth across the space in front of the meetinghouse. She took a quick look around to make sure no one was watching us. The sea hissed and surged through her words.
<name>Nyala</name>	Nyala	Kahu	He began to say a prayer, and he asked the Gods to forgive him. He saw [MASK] stir again. Oh, yes, great-grandchild. Rise up from the depths of your long sleep. Return to the people and take your rightful place among them.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Kahu	Suddenly, with great clarity, I knew that our final challenge was almost upon us. I pressed [MASK] close to me, to reassure her. I felt a sudden shiver as far out to sea, muted thunder boomed like a door opening far away.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Kahu	But that first night I was in big trouble with the old lady. “H't” ond bang, went her hand. "What did you do with [MASK] at work? She’s tuckered out.” $ "Nothing,” I squealed.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Mihi	I am a senior line to yours!” Not only that, but [MASK] had then turned her back to him, bent over, lifted up her petticoats, and said, ‘Anyway, here is the place where you come from!”
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Nanny	"You look like a duchess,” I lied. "Not like a queen?" [MASK] asked, offended. “Well, I’ll soon fix that.” Oh, no, not the hat. It must have looked wonderful in the 1930s, but that was ages ago.
<name>Winnie</name>	Winnie	Kahu	Then I got a big fright because the stingray turned around and, smiling, waved at me. It was [MASK] in her white dress and sandals, dog-paddling down to the seafloor, her braids floating around her head. I gasped and swallowed seawater.
<name>Anita</name>	Anita	Kahu	He’s missing the best part.” Then the second half of the program began. There was [MASK] in her skirt and bodice, standing so proudly in front of the school cultural group. "Hands on hips!” she yelled. "Let’s begin!”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Nanny	Before we could stop her, she stood up and dived overboard. Until that moment I had never even known she could swim. [MASK]’s mouth made a big 0. Then the breath rushed into her lungs and she screamed, “Oh, no!"
<name>grandfather</name>	grandfather	Koro	Our [MASK] was like an old whale stranded in an alien present, but that was how it was supposed to be, because he also had his role in the pattern of things, in the tides of the future.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Nanny	[MASK] had invited the boys over and they arrived with a roar and a rush of blue smoke and gas fumes. It was almost as if I had never left. The guitars came out and the voices rang free.
<name>Anita</name>	Anita	Kahu	That afternoon I was looking out the window when I saw [MASK] running along the road. School had just finished. I went to the veranda to watch her arrival. Was this the same little girl whose afterbirth had been put in the earth those many years ago?
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Kahu	Ever since the birth of [MASK]’s sister, he had become more intense and brooding. Perhaps aware of his own mortality, he wanted to make sure that the succession in the present generation was done—and done well.
<name>Nalini</name>	Nalini	Kahu	Three days after the sacred whale and its accompanying herd had gone, and after [MASK] had been given up for dead, she had been found unconscious, floating in a nest of dark lustrous kelp in the middle of the ocean.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Porourangi	We killed the fatted calf for you, just like the Bible says.” She hugged me close and then skipped away. Then [MASK] was there. “Is it good to be home?” he asked cautiously. "Yes,” I breathed. "
<name>Ariel</name>	Ariel	Kahu	They were dolphins. They circled around [MASK] and seemed to be talking to her. She nodded and grabbed one around its body. As quick as a flash, the dolphins sped her to another area of the reef and stopped.
<name>Did</name>	Did	l£yon	But always, in the early morning, when the sunlight was beginning to crack the midnight glamor, the memories would come seeping through. "How’s our Nanny? How’s our Koro? [MASK] write to them, dettf-teU them that you saw usJike this,”
<name>Millie</name>	Millie	Nanny	She had let out the dress I had bought her and added lime green panels to the sides. [MASK] was color-blind and thought they were red. I gulped hard. "You look like a duchess,” I lied. "Not like a queen?"
<name>Kahu</name>	Kahu	Kahu	Ko Paikea? By chance, [MASK] felt the whales forward fin. Her fingers tightened quickly around it. She held on for dear life. And the whale felt a surge of gladness that as it mounted became ripples of ecstasy, ever increasing.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Kahu	The bull whale flexed his muscles, releasing [MASK], and she felt herself tumbling along his back, tumbling, tumbling, tumbling. All around her the whales were leaping, and the air was filed with diamond spray. “Cant you hear them?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Kahu	No wai te he?” he shouted. Where lies the blame? And the seagulls caught his words within their claws and screamed and echoed the syllables overhead. When we turned back to the station wagon, I saw [MASK]'s white face, so still against the window.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Kahu	In the clear air I heard a chittering, chattering sound from the beach. I saw [MASK] far away, silhouetted on the sand. She was standing facing the sea, listening to voices in the surf. 'J^ere. tUm-. KnUul There, therp.
<name>John</name>	John	Tom	Glad to have you home.” [MASK] had contracted Parkinsons disease. It wasn't until weeks later that I discovered the disease had not only struck at his limbs but also had rendered him partially blind. The situation was clear.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Kahu	The headlights and spotlights were dazzling upon the whale. It may have been the sudden light, or a crosscurrent, but the eye of the whale seemed to flicker. Then the whale appeared to be looking at the young girl swimming. “[MASK]!”
<name>Janet</name>	Janet	Jeff	so I told him she was doing well with her spelling." Uh-oh. That was the bad news. No sooner had I put the phone down than [MASK] laid into me. "Warm and cuddly, huh?”
<name>Nadia</name>	Nadia	Kahu	Just my luck, I thought. If I don’t drown I’ll get eaten. Then I saw that the shapes were smaller whales of the herd, coming to assist their leader. The searchlights were playing on [MASK] astride the whale. She looked so small, so defenseless.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Jeff	“We sure have.” I laughed. “And there's still a way to go yet." Then [MASK] said, "I want to thank you. For everything. But if you have to go, I'll understand.” I smiled at him, reflectively.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Kahus	White ribbons had been used to tie her braids. There was no color in her cheeks, and she seemed not to be breathing at all. The bedcovers had been pulled right up to [MASK] chin, but her arms were on top of the covers.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Kahu	The old man cradled [MASK] in his arms, partly because of emotion and partly because he didn’t want those big ears out there to hear their big chief crying. "You’re the best great-grandchild in the whole wide world,” he said.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Kahu	Perhaps aware of his own mortality, he wanted to make sure that the succession in the present generation was done—and done well. But in doing so he was pushing away the one who had always adored him, [MASK] herself.
<name>Rangi</name>	Rangi	Kingi	I couldn't understand [MASK]’s attitude at all; he was always trying to cross the street whenever he saw a cous he didn’t want to be seen with. But I would just bowl along regardless and yell, "Gidday cous!”
<name>her</name>	her	afn	The other female whales now decided to give her a wide berth. The old mother whale saw the warrior whales preparing to give her a sharp nip in the behind. She moved quickly toward the ancient bull whale and let [MASK] accidentally on purpose caress the place of his deepest pleasure.
<name>Argus</name>	Argus	Paikea	And there was [MASK], our eternal sentinel, always vigilant against any who would wish to harm his descendants. Caught like this, the village was a picture of normality, given the events that were to come. I drove up to the house.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Kahu	The sound of the women assembling in the dining room under Nanny Flowerss supervision came to us like a song of support. As I shut the door to the meetinghouse, I saw [MASK]'s face, like a small dolphin, staring out to sea.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Billy	[MASK] led the way and we followed—he was sure tricky, all right, knowing the shortcuts. No wonder the cops could never catch him. We flew over fences, jounced around paddocks, leaped streams, and skirted the incoming tide.
<name>Alia</name>	Alia	Kahu	“Cant you hear them?” [MASK] asked. She fell into the sea. The thunder of the whales departing was loud in her ears. She opened her eyes and looked downward. Through the foaming water she could see huge tail fins waving farewell.
<name>Nalani</name>	Nalani	Kahu	Then she felt that same shiver and again placed her head against the whales skin. This time when the whale dived, it stayed underwater longer. But [MASK] had made a discovery. Where her face was pressed, the whale had opened up a small breathing chamber.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Kahu	,^, s\ -Yes.- £#>1 yon don't fix him " slip whispprpH ‘Vhpn Lcwar ] y/ill" C\jT)Cjl HlSI) Hiss and roar. Ebb and flow. DT)UCgfalr The next morning I sneaked in to give [MASK] a special cuddle, iust from me.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Jeff	We had parked the station wagon at the airport and were driving home to the plantation. [MASK] was at the wheel. We were all of us in a merry mood. The road was silver with moonlight. Suddenly, in front of us, I saw a man walking along the side of the road.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Derek	All of us who were there that day and night will be forever bonded by our experience with the stranded whales. They were tighdy bunched and they were crying like babies. [MASK] had assigned people in groups, eight people to look after each whale.
<name>Neptune</name>	Neptune	Paikea	“It is the seed of [MASK],” she said, "and we must return it to the land.” In her voice was ageless music. The ancient bull whale swayed in the silken tides of the stirring sea. Though tired, he sensed the truth in his consort’s words.
<name>Riddley</name>	Riddley	T	I guess also that [MASK] didn't feel that much different: I looked much the same as they did | with my 1p<n-F»r jacket and pants matching their own gear with its buckles and scarves and whips. "What game are you into?" they would tease.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Paka	"It will be all right, [MASK].” We collected the suitcases and ran out to the station wagon. As we drove through the town, the illuminated cloud seemed always to be in front of us, like a portent.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Jeff	In so doing I had broken a cardinal rule, and my punishment was ostracism. "We’ve come a long way together,” [MASK] said. “We sure have.” I laughed. “And there's still a way to go yet."
<name>Chip</name>	Chip	Jeff	Many things were coming to a head for me on the plantation, and I wanted to avoid a collision. [MASK] and I were getting along okay, but his parents were pushing him ever so gently to consort with his own kind in the clubs and all the parties of the aggressively expatriate.
<name>Keola</name>	Keola	Billy	Now who are the brave ones to go out in the water and tie the ropes around the tail of our ancestor? We have to pull him around so that he’s facing the sea. Well?” I saw my friend [MASK], and volunteered on his behalf.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Linda	Have you got a girlfriend? There’s a boy at school who keeps following me around. I said to him that he should try [MASK]. She likes boys. As for me, I’ve only got one boyfriend. No, two. No, three.
<name>Blue</name>	Blue	Kahu	We always knew there would be such a child, but when [MASK] was bom, well, we were looking the other way, really. We were hanging out at our grandparents’ place, me and the j ^ --------------------------------------- rvCb VV\ACOC^ boys, when the phone rang.
