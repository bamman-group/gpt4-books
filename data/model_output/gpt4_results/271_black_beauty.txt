<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Job	“After that he often came to see me, and when my mouth was healed the other breaker, [MASK], they called him, went on training me; he was steady and thoughtful, and I soon learned what he wanted.” 08
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Joe	I heard him say to himself over and over again, “Stupid boy! stupid boy! no cloth put on, and I dare say the water was cold, too; boys are no good;” but [MASK] was a good boy, after all.
<name>Black Beauty</name>	Black Beauty	Jakes	[MASK], like the other carters, always had the check-rein up, which prevented me from drawing easily, and by the time I had been there three or four months I found the work telling very much on my strength.
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Rory	And there was poor [MASK] with his flesh torn open and bleeding, and the blood streaming down. They said if it had been a little more to one side it would have killed him; and a good thing for him, poor fellow, if it had.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Dolly	“Is he gentle, father?” “Yes, [MASK], as gentle as your own kitten; come and pat him.” At once the little hand was patting about all over my shoulder without fear. How good it felt!
<name>Willie</name>	Willie	Samson	‘Poor lassie! it was a bad business, a bad business;’ then he quietly took the rein and led me to the stable; just at the door stood [MASK]. I laid my ears back and snapped at him.
<name>John</name>	John	John	“Well, my dear,” she said, “how do you like him?” “He is exactly what [MASK] said,” he replied; “a pleasanter creature I never wish to mount. What shall we call him?”
<name>Samson</name>	Samson	Samson	He growled out something about a vicious brute. ‘Hark ye,’ said the father, ‘a bad-tempered man will never make a good-tempered horse. You’ve not learned your trade yet, [MASK].’
<name>Blacksmith</name>	Blacksmith	Jerry	“‘Do your best, And leave the rest, ‘Twill all come right Some day or night.’” It soon became known that [MASK] had lost his best customer, and for what reason. Most of the men said he was a fool, but two or three took his part.
<name>John</name>	John	York	I believe everybody liked him; certainly the horses did. The only wonder was that he should be in an under situation and not in the place of a head coachman like [MASK]; but he had one great fault and that was the love of drink.
<name>Shura</name>	Shura	Skinner	I want a warm coat and a mackintosh, but with so many to feed how can a man get it? I had to pledge my clock a week ago to pay [MASK], and I shall never see it again.”
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Jerry	[MASK] had taken no part in this conversation, but I never saw his face look so sad before. The governor had stood with both his hands in his pockets; now he took his handkerchief out of his hat and wiped his forehead.
<name>Ginger</name>	Ginger	James	18 Going for the Doctor One night, a few days after [MASK] had left, I had eaten my hay and was lying down in my straw fast asleep, when I was suddenly roused by the stable bell ringing very loud.
<name>Steerforth</name>	Steerforth	Larry	Because you never give them any peace or encouragement.” “Well, I have not had good luck,” said [MASK], “that’s where it is.” “And you never will,” said the governor.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jerry	I don’t believe in religion, for I don’t see that your religious people are any better than the rest.” “If they are not better,” put in [MASK], “it is because they are not religious.
<name>Black</name>	Black	Halloo	I made a step, but almost fell again. “[MASK]! he’s bad in his foot as well as his knees. Look here--his hoof is cut all to pieces; he might well come down, poor fellow!
<name>Lorna</name>	Lorna	Lizzie	“I will not be five minutes,” he said. “Oh, do not hurry yourself; [MASK] and I shall not run away from you.” He hung my rein on one of the iron spikes, and was soon hidden among the trees.
<name>Merrylegs</name>	Merrylegs	Robert	[MASK] led me on very slowly, and I limped and hobbled on as well as I could with great pain. I am sure he was sorry for me, for he often patted and encouraged me, talking to me in a pleasant voice.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Joe	[MASK]’s voice shook with excitement. “Thank ye, my lad,” said the man, running in for his hat; then pausing for a moment, “Will you give evidence of what you saw if I should bring the fellow up before a magistrate?”
<name>Ginger</name>	Ginger	Ginger	The next time that [MASK] and I were together in the paddock she told me about her first place. “After my breaking in,” she said, “I was bought by a dealer to match another chestnut horse.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Norman	Then there was [MASK]; he might have turned round and said at his age he could not be troubled with a raw boy from the plow-tail, but he was like a father to me, and took no end of pains with me.
<name>Queenie</name>	Queenie	Ginger	but I can’t speak of them, the sight was too dreadful. It was a chestnut horse with a long, thin neck. I saw a white streak down the forehead. I believe it was [MASK]; I hoped it was, for then her troubles would be over.
<name>Petrovitch</name>	Petrovitch	Sam	His wife sent a boy this morning to say his father was in a high fever and could not get out, so I’m here instead.” The next morning the same man came again. “How is [MASK]?” inquired the governor.
<name>Jerry</name>	Jerry	Jerry	When the weather was very bad many of the men would go and sit in the tavern close by, and get some one to watch for them; but they often lost a fare in that way, and could not, as [MASK] said, be there without spending money.
<name>Willie</name>	Willie	Max	As for me, I was obliged still to go in the carriage, and had a fresh partner called [MASK]; he had always been used to the tight rein. I asked him how it was he bore it.
<name>James</name>	James	Alfred	One day his master came in and said, “[MASK], the stable smells rather strong; should not you give that stall a good scrub and throw down plenty of water?” “Well, sir,” he said, touching his cap, “I’ll do so if you please, sir;
<name>Blackie</name>	Blackie	Beauty	I stood nearest the door, so he came to me first, patting me as he came in. “Come, [MASK], on with your bridle, my boy, we’ll soon be out of this smother.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jerry	It was the first election I had seen, and I don’t want to be in another, though I have heard things are better now. [MASK] and I had not eaten many mouthfuls before a poor young woman, carrying a heavy child, came along the street.
<name>Ginger</name>	Ginger	Ginger	Cut the trace here, somebody, if you can’t unhitch it!” One of the footmen ran for the winch, and another brought a knife from the house. The groom soon set me free from [MASK] and the carriage, and led me to my box.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Jerry	“I’m a great fool, [MASK], but I tried once for two days, and I thought I should have died; how did you do?” “I had hard work at it for several weeks; you see I never did get drunk,
<name>Black Beauty</name>	Black Beauty	Dolly	38 [MASK] and a Real Gentleman Winter came in early, with a great deal of cold and wet. There was snow, or sleet, or rain almost every day for weeks, changing only for keen driving winds or sharp frosts. The horses all felt it very much.
<name>Jerry</name>	Jerry	Jerry	Please tell me the way.” “Look you here, missis,” said [MASK], “I’ve got a wife and dear children at home, and I know a father’s feelings; now get you into that cab, and I’ll take you there for nothing.
<name>Black Beauty</name>	Black Beauty	Master	[MASK] noticed the change, too, and one day when he got out of the carriage and came to speak to us, as he often did, he stroked her beautiful neck. “Well, my pretty one, well, how do things go with you now?
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Polly	So don’t go and fret yourself, [MASK]” (for she had begun to cry); “I would not go back to the old times if I earned twice as much, so that is settled, little woman.
<name>Blackie</name>	Blackie	Ginger	It was a hard job to get it into the dog-cart, for there was no one to hold [MASK]; but she knew as well as I did what was going on, and stood as still as a stone.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Beauty	The boy is quite broken-hearted; he can’t eat his meals, and he can’t smile. He says he knows it was all his fault, though he is sure he did the best he knew, and he says if [MASK] dies no one will ever speak to him again.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Beauty	“Come on, [MASK], what’s the matter?” Of course I could not tell him, but I knew very well that the bridge was not safe. Just then the man at the toll-gate on the other side ran out of the house, tossing a torch about like one mad.
<name>Mrs. Weston</name>	Mrs. Weston	Mary	I know [MASK] was rather anxious about you last year.” “Yes, ma’am, she was; I had a bad cough that followed me up quite into the warm weather, and when I am kept out late she does worry herself a good deal.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Jerry	I have given them a thrashing they will remember; a set of cowardly, rascally ‘orange’ blackguards.” [MASK] kissed the child and said, “Run in to mother, my pet, and tell her I think you had better stay at home to-day and help her.”
<name>Black Beauty</name>	Black Beauty	Ginger	[MASK] was never put into the carriage again, but when she was well of her bruises one of the Lord W----‘s younger sons said he should like to have her; he was sure she would make a good hunter.
<name>James</name>	James	John	I heard no more of this conversation, for the medicine did well and sent me to sleep, and in the morning I felt much better; but I often thought of [MASK]’s words when I came to know more of the world.
<name>Black</name>	Black	James	“Ah! poor gentleman; I read all about it in the paper at the time. A fine horse killed, too, wasn’t there?” “Yes,” said [MASK]; “he was a splendid creature, brother to this one, and just like him.”
<name>Nelly</name>	Nelly	Nelly	When the old man died some years after I stepped into his place, and now of course I have top wages, and can lay by for a rainy day or a sunny day, as it may happen, and [MASK] is as happy as a bird.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	John	I heard no more, as they went into the house, and [MASK] took me to the stable. Oh, what a good supper he gave me that night, a good bran mash and some crushed beans with my oats, and such a thick bed of straw!
<name>Cartwright</name>	Cartwright	Truman	Most of the men said he was a fool, but two or three took his part. “If workingmen don’t stick to their Sunday,” said [MASK], “they’ll soon have none left; it is every man’s right and every beast’s right.
<name>Blackie</name>	Blackie	Joe	“Hold hard,” said [MASK]; “don’t go on flogging the horses like that; the wheels are so stuck that they cannot move the cart.” The man took no heed, but went on lashing. “Stop!
<name>Harker</name>	Harker	Jerry	He seemed much stunned, and as they led him into a shop he walked as if he were in great pain. [MASK] of course came back to the stand, but in about ten minutes one of the shopmen called him, so we drew up to the pavement.
<name>Max</name>	Max	Lizzie	“Oh, no, not at all,” she replied, “but I am amiable enough to let you ride him for once, and I will try your charming [MASK]. You must confess that in size and appearance she is far more like a lady’s horse than my own favorite.”
<name>Nelly</name>	Nelly	Nelly	I was a farmer’s boy, not earning enough to keep myself, much less both of us, and she must have gone to the workhouse but for our mistress ([MASK] calls her her angel, and she has good right to do so).
<name>Ginger</name>	Ginger	Ladybird	“My dear boy, I can’t make all old horses young; besides, [MASK] was not so very old, as she was run down and badly used.” “Well, grandpapa, I don’t believe that this one is old; look at his mane and tail.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Merrylegs	“Who talks about blockheads?” said [MASK], who just came up from the old apple-tree, where he had been rubbing himself against the low branch. “Who talks about blockheads? I believe that is a bad word.”
<name>Black Beauty</name>	Black Beauty	Jerry	When poor Captain was got up he was found to be very much cut and knocked about. [MASK] led him home gently, and a sad sight it was to see the blood soaking into his white coat and dropping from his side and shoulder.
<name>John</name>	John	James	When he had done [MASK] stepped up and felt me over, as if he thought I could not be thoroughly done, but he found my coat as clean and smooth as silk. “Well,” he said, “I thought I was pretty quick, and
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Joe	“Right, [MASK]! you did right, my boy, whether the fellow gets a summons or not. Many folks would have ridden by and said it was not their business to interfere. Now I say that with cruelty and oppression it is
<name>Jerry</name>	Jerry	Smith	No,” said [MASK], “that will be all right till we get home.” He spoke in a very loud, offhand way, and I thought it very unlike him not to see about the shoe, as he was generally wonderfully particular about loose nails in our shoes.
<name>Black</name>	Black	Sam	“You’ve beaten me, [MASK],” he said, “for it’s all true, and I won’t cast it up to you any more about the police; it was the look in that horse’s eye that came over me.
<name>Nell</name>	Nell	Polly	But [MASK] would always cheer him up, and say, “Never mind, father, never, mind. “‘Do your best, And leave the rest, ‘Twill all come right Some day or night.’”
<name>Dick</name>	Dick	John	The squire stood there, with a lamp in his hand. “Now, [MASK],” he said, “ride for your life--that is, for your mistress’ life; there is not a moment to lose.
<name>John</name>	John	Polly	How good it felt! “Let me get him a bran mash while you rub him down,” said the mother. “Do, [MASK], it’s just what he wants; and I know you’ve got a beautiful mash ready for me.”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Jerry	They were all wonderfully fond of each other; I never knew such a happy, merry family before or since. [MASK] had a cab of his own, and two horses, which he drove and attended to himself.
<name>Blackthorn</name>	Blackthorn	Jerry	“Of course there’s no one to tell us whose fault that was,” said [MASK], “and as long as I don’t know I shall give him the benefit of the doubt; for a firmer, neater stepper I never rode.
<name>John</name>	John	John	It grew darker and darker, stiller and stiller. I trotted quietly along, the wheels hardly making a sound on the soft road. For a good while neither master nor [MASK] spoke, and then master began in a serious voice.
<name>Phileas</name>	Phileas	John	why, he’s a child!” “He is fourteen and a half,” said [MASK]. “But he is such a little chap!” “Yes, he is small, but he is quick and willing, and kind-hearted, too,
<name>Polly</name>	Polly	Polly	At last we got home; he could hardly speak, and his cough was dreadful. [MASK] asked no questions, but opened the door and held the lantern for him. “Can’t I do something?” she said.
<name>John</name>	John	John	I was very glad to hear that, for it seems the doctor had said if we had been a little longer it would have been too late. [MASK] told my master he never saw a horse go so fast in his life.
<name>Ginger</name>	Ginger	Ginger	A few days after this I had to go out with [MASK] in the carriage. I wondered how we should get on together; but except laying her ears back when I was led up to her, she behaved very well.
<name>Phileas</name>	Phileas	Jerry	“Lady!” said one of them; “oh! she can wait; our business is very important, besides we were in first, it is our right, and we shall stay in.” A droll smile came over [MASK]’s face as he shut the door upon them.
<name>Polly</name>	Polly	Grace	“Nonsense, [MASK], get in at once, and don’t make all this fuss; a pretty thing it would be if a man of business had to examine every cab-horse before he hired it--the man knows his own business of course; there, get in and hold your tongue!”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	“Do,” she said, “for I like to keep a good name going.” Captain went out in the cab all the morning. [MASK] came in after school to feed me and give me water. In the afternoon I was put into the cab.
<name>Ginger</name>	Ginger	Ginger	There was no leave-taking of [MASK]; we neighed to each other as I was led off, and she trotted anxiously along by the hedge, calling to me as long as she could hear the sound of my feet.
<name>Thady</name>	Thady	James	the best rider in the county.” “I believe he is,” said [MASK], “but he rides very little now, since the poor young master was killed.” “Ah! poor gentleman; I read all about it in the paper at the time.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	John	[MASK] had many stories to tell of dogs and horses, and the wonderful things they had done; he thought people did not value their animals half enough nor make friends of them as they ought to do. I am sure he makes friends of them if ever a man did.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Jerry	After driving through the side street we came to the large cab stand where [MASK] had said “Good-night”. On one side of this wide street were high houses with wonderful shop fronts, and on the other was an old church and churchyard, surrounded by iron palisades.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Jerry	I found I had a good feed of crushed oats wetted up with a little bran; this would be a treat any day, but very refreshing then. [MASK] was so thoughtful and kind--what horse would not do his best for such a master?
<name>Traddles</name>	Traddles	Willie	Sometimes he brought his grandfather, who always looked closely at my legs. “This is our point, [MASK],” he would say; “but he is improving so steadily that I think we shall see a change for the better in the spring.”
<name>John</name>	John	John	“I wish I may ever be like you.” “I don’t often speak of myself,” said [MASK], “but as you are going away from us out into the world to shift for yourself I’ll just tell you how I look on these things.
<name>the driver</name>	the driver	Jerry	At a quarter past one the door opened, and the two gentlemen came out; they got into the cab without a word, and told [MASK] where to drive, that was nearly two miles. My legs were numb with cold, and I thought I should have stumbled.
<name>Pinocchio</name>	Pinocchio	Hotspur	One afternoon [MASK] was brought in very wet and dirty. “The streets are nothing but slush,” said the governor; “it will give you a good warming, my boy, to get him clean and dry.”
<name>Jacob</name>	Jacob	Jakes	“If doing his best won’t get this load up he must do something more than his best; that’s all I know, ma’am,” said [MASK]. “But is it not a heavy load?” she said.
<name>Black Beauty</name>	Black Beauty	Joe	The man was in a towering passion and the worse for drink, and laid on the whip again. [MASK] turned my head, and the next moment we were going at a round gallop toward the house of the master brick-maker.
<name>St. John</name>	St. John	John	[MASK]’s voice almost startled me as he answered: “Only ignorance! only ignorance! how can you talk about only ignorance? Don’t you know that it is the worst thing in the world, next to wickedness?--and which does the most mischief heaven only knows.
<name>Joseph</name>	Joseph	James	No, no! I shall miss you very much, [MASK], but we shall pull through, and there’s nothing like doing a kindness when ‘tis put in your way, and I am glad I can do it.”
<name>Merrylegs</name>	Merrylegs	Ginger	The last sad day had come; the footman and the heavy luggage had gone off the day before, and there were only master and mistress and her maid. [MASK] and I brought the carriage up to the hall door for the last time.
<name>John</name>	John	John	You are a good bit happier than when you came to us, I think.” She put her nose up to him in a friendly, trustful way, while he rubbed it gently. “We shall make a cure of her, [MASK],” he said.
<name>Blackbird</name>	Blackbird	Merrylegs	When they came there was plenty of work for [MASK], for nothing pleased them so much as getting on him by turns and riding him all about the orchard and the home paddock, and this they would do by the hour together.
<name>Jerry</name>	Jerry	Jerry	take this gentleman’s luggage--Dover line twelve o’clock train--that’s it,” and without waiting for another word [MASK] wheeled me round to make room for other cabs that were dashing up at the last minute, and drew up on one side till the crush was past.
<name>Black Beauty</name>	Black Beauty	John	“You Beauty!” said [MASK], and took the bridle and gently turned me round to the right-hand road by the river side. The sun had set some time; the wind seemed to have lulled off after that furious blast which tore up the tree.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Jerry	“I’ll do all that can be done, sir,” said [MASK]; “I think we shall be in time. This block-up cannot last much longer, and your luggage is very heavy for you to carry, sir.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Polly	“I suppose you’ll vote for the gentleman? He said he was of your politics.” “So he is in some things, but I shall not vote for him, [MASK]; you know what his trade is?” “Yes.”
<name>Black Beauty</name>	Black Beauty	York	[MASK] might have known, and very likely did know, how that rein harassed me; but I suppose he took it as a matter of course that it could not be helped; at any rate, nothing was done to relieve me. 24
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Smith	[MASK] did not come into the yard till five, and then he said he should not leave till six, as he had met with some old friends. The man then told him of the nail, and asked if he should have the shoe looked to. “
<name>Black Beauty</name>	Black Beauty	John	I will never say I was not frightened, for I was. I stopped still, and I believe I trembled; of course I did not turn round or run away; I was not brought up to that. [MASK] jumped out and was in a moment at my head.
<name>Langton</name>	Langton	Langley	Now, you are a military man, [MASK], and no doubt like to see your regiment look well on parade, ‘heads up’, and all that; but you would not take much credit for your drill if all your men had their heads tied to a backboard!
<name>Black Beauty</name>	Black Beauty	Beauty	I dare not go forward, and I made a dead stop. “Go on, [MASK],” said my master, and he gave me a touch with the whip, but I dare not stir; he gave me a sharp cut; I jumped, but I dare not go forward.
<name>John</name>	John	Smith	As [MASK]’s death had been so sudden, and no one was there to see it, there was an inquest held. The landlord and hostler at the White Lion, with several other people, gave evidence that he was intoxicated when he started from the inn.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	James	My brave lad!” said master, laying his hand on his shoulder, “are you hurt?” [MASK] shook his head, for he could not yet speak. “Ay,” said the big man who held me; “he is a brave lad, and no mistake.”
<name>John</name>	John	Jakes	“Poor fellow! that is what you wanted,” said she, patting and stroking me with her gentle hand; “and now if you will speak kindly to him and lead him on I believe he will be able to do better.” [MASK] took the rein.
<name>James</name>	James	John	“[MASK],” he said, “I meant to have tried the new horse this morning, but I have other business. You may as well take him around after breakfast; go by the common and the Highwood, and back by the watermill and the river; that will show his paces.”
<name>Ginger</name>	Ginger	Ginger	I hope they will now come again, if you do not bite or snap.” I told him I never bit anything but grass, hay, and corn, and could not think what pleasure [MASK] found it.
<name>Flora</name>	Flora	Tom	“A good many!” said [MASK]; “there was not one of the tender cuttings that was not nipped off. I shall have to strike all over again, and the worst of it is that I don’t know where to go to get fresh ones.
