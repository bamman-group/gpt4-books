<name>Max</name>	Max	Zeppo	“He’s an agent. He’s the agent, or at least he thinks he is.” “Is he your agent?” “I wish. But [MASK] only wants ’em when they’re ridin’ high.
<name>Donna</name>	Donna	Clarissa	If I operate through her schmuck agent, nothing’ll get done.” He nodded, pleased with his own idea. “[MASK] can whisper in my ear what she wants to do, and then I’ll do the dance of a thousand agents.”
<name>Herb</name>	Herb	Lindi	She heard the opening beat of her record, put on by a disc-jockey, and tensed up. [MASK] gave her a little push, propelling her in front of the disc-jockey stand, where a spotlight hit her in the eyes. Oh, no!
<name>the highway</name>	the highway	Pico	“I didn’t.” “I’m tellin’ you just in case.” He decided to develop herpes. Again. Preferably tomorrow. To change the subject he said, “What does your old man do, anyway?” The car roared down [MASK].
<name>he</name>	he	Wes	He stared at her intently. “Do you want me as much as I want you?” The “Yes” slipped out before she could help herself. Okay, [MASK] knew it was some kind of setup, but he couldn’t figure out the angle.
<name>he</name>	he	Mark	For a moment she allowed his insistent lips to press against hers, his familiar tongue to invade her mouth. Hard against her thigh she felt the pressure of his desire. She wanted to say, The hell with everything, [MASK] is back, and I’m glad.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Clarissa	[MASK] opened her blouse as she watched him. She wore no bra, and her breasts were small with sharply extended nipples. As he stripped, her eyes never left him. Distractedly she touched herself. Now he was naked, and she was still half dressed.
<name>He</name>	He	Mark	He smiled when he said it, but she knew he was agonizing. [MASK] was unreasonably possessive. “Just a friend,” she said lightly. “Why can’t you cancel it?” “Don’t push me.” “I miss you.”
<name>Tony</name>	Tony	Wes	“An’ while we’re talkin’, the word is out you’re cat food if you don’ pay back the money ya owe.” “I don’t owe one fuckin’ dollar,” [MASK] said angrily. “I was set up— you know it better than anyone.
<name>honey</name>	honey	Wesley	She looked embarrassed. “You do owe me, [MASK].” “And I’m gonna pay you. Next week. I don’t appreciate being threatened with eviction.” She licked her scarlet lips flirtatiously. “Would I do that to you?”
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Zachary	“He enjoys drinking. It never upsets him, only other people.” “How do you manage?” She smiled wanly. “Oh... I manage. When you love someone you always do.” [MASK] felt like an intruder in his own room.
<name>He</name>	He	Bryan	They stared at each other warily. [MASK] was very drunk. If he was sober she might have been able to talk him out of what he was about to do. “No!” She shook her head as he approached her. “No! Please, no!”
<name>Elle</name>	Elle	Heaven	She knew her mother had complained about it all her life, but [MASK] couldn’t see what was so bad, talking about herself nonstop. Pushing her hands through her multicolored hair, she answered questions on clothes, style, fashion, school, and background.
<name>Brigitte</name>	Brigitte	Jacques	If at all.” With that he stalked out of the house. “’Ellooo, [MASK].” The French actress with the inviting eyes and smoky voice was in the Green Room when he put his head around the door a few minutes before show time.
<name>The director</name>	The director	Chuck	He hooted with laughter. “Serious? You?” he sneered derisively. Her mouth drooped with displeasure. [MASK] had no confidence in her ability as an actress. He hadn’t actually said so, but she knew it, and it irked her.
<name>Cher</name>	Cher	Silver	So secret, in fact, that the press had no smell of anything going on, and [MASK], unrecognizable in a long blond wig and dark glasses, had completely fooled the old couple in the wedding chapel until later, when checking the register, they had noticed her name.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Howard	“I don’t know. Is he late?” [MASK] checked his watch. “A few minutes. He’s probably on his way. He had to go see a house or something.” “A house?” “Yeah—you know.
<name>Eve</name>	Eve	Jade	“Sorry! C’mon. In. Now. Food. And all the news. Right?” “You got it.” He followed her into the ultramodern kitchen and placed the box on a countertop. [MASK] reached for plates and a knife.
<name>He</name>	He	Wes	The man passed him a slip of paper with an address written on it. “Nine o’clock. They be expectin’ you. Then you bring package to me here. I be waitin’.” [MASK] nodded. And with gut instinct he knew he was making a wrong move.
<name>Laura</name>	Laura	Jade	They both stared at the set. [MASK] in a supermarket, buying a jar of coffee. She wore shorts and a T-shirt, with her hair piled on top of her head, and looked like every man’s fantasy of the girl next door.
<name>Luke</name>	Luke	Eli	“When it comes to the Lukes of this world I just can’t control myself.” They talked late into the night, and for the first time, falteringly, she began to confide in [MASK], as he was confiding in her.
<name>Jesse</name>	Jesse	Howard	“You’re damn right, [MASK]. And I love you for being so honest.” Crawling across the bed, she kissed him. The kiss was aimed at his cheek, but he managed to move quickly enough for it to land on his mouth.
<name>her</name>	her	Silver	And then she would add with a conspiratorial laugh and a knowing wink, “Besides, I’m hardly a mother figure, am I?” The truth was that having a teenage daughter did not suit [MASK] one bit.
<name>Louise</name>	Louise	Poppy	“If he doesn’t, / shall.” [MASK] saw her entire evening falling to pieces. “You can’t do that,” she said, thoroughly alarmed. “You’re the guest of honor.”
<name>Angelina</name>	Angelina	Jade	“I’ll come back again,” she said sweetly, “when I have another movie to plug.” He glanced up and met [MASK]’s gaze head-on. They had been conscientiously trying not to stare at each other all night.
<name>Darling</name>	Darling	Dennis	She looked elegantly casual in a suede jacket and pants, her own hair tied back, full studio makeup still in place. “You never returned my calls,” he pointed out. “[MASK], dear, you must realize that I don’t even have time to go to the bathroom!”
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Poppy	“Do it.” Reluctantly he obeyed. [MASK] was a woman you didn’t fight with, not unless you wanted to be up all night. As soon as he stopped the car she was on him, burrowing into his lap like a hungry rabbit.
<name>Her mother</name>	Her mother	Beverly	And she was almost convinced that marrying him was the right thing to do. It better be. They had taken out the license, had the requisite blood tests, and tomorrow was the big day. [MASK] had freaked out when she’d told her. “Whaaat?
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Delicious	“[MASK]!” she exclaimed, jumping up and hurrying to his side. She knelt on the bed, completely messing up his profusion of papers. “Who’s a clever boy, then?” He peered down the d6collet6 of her rose-pink peignoir.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Heaven	“Isn’t he the best?” [MASK] said as she watched him go. “And you know something—she’s nice too. Like not big time or any of that film star crap. Don’t you agree?”
<name>He</name>	He	Eddie	He’d said he would try and make it. She couldn’t wait! [MASK] stripped down to shorts and a tank top. He was tall and lanky, with an athlete’s body. Most of the girls at school thought he was the babe of all time.
<name>Putz</name>	Putz	Chuck	Dump the putz.” It had to be done. And the sooner she did it, the better she would feel. But it wasn’t going to be easy. [MASK] was like a big excitable puppy one minute, and an aggressive nut the next.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Jack	At the time she was making coffee around the studio and not much else. [MASK] spotted potential and wangled her a job as production assistant. When L.A. happened, he called, and asked if she was interested in being his right hand.
<name>Heather</name>	Heather	Silver	“I need to feel nothing between me and nature.” She stretched, allowing her full breasts to fall free of her blouse. The penthouse apartment was hardly the great outdoors, but [MASK] got the drift. Idly the two girls began to touch each other.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Heaven	“You haven’t even sent her a card.” [MASK]’s laughter rang out. “She’s never sent one to me. In fact I’m lucky to get a check three weeks later, when you remind her.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ben	She waited patiently while he laboriously printed his address on a slip of paper. “Thanks again, [MASK],” she said, finally closing the front door on him. Alone at last! In L.A. Who would have thought she would ever make the long trek west again?
<name>Raymond</name>	Raymond	Eddie	[MASK] headed for the hood of the car. “Don’t worry ’bout a thing. I’ll fix it,” he said, less hopeful than he sounded. With an exasperated sigh she sank down on the grass shoulder muttering, “Yeah.
<name>Jack Daniel</name>	Jack Daniel	Seagram	Another night of unadulterated lust. And very nice too. Somewhere along the way she had asked him what business he was in. Casually he had replied, “Liquor.” She hadn’t pushed it. Probably thought he owned [MASK]’s!
<name>her</name>	her	Kellie	Glancing down at her feet, she clapped a hand over her mouth. “What a putz!” “But a lovable one.” She grinned at him. “Thanks!” It had taken effort on his part to get connected with [MASK] again.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Corey	“The man is a riot!” She checked with [MASK]. “Okay with you?” “I think I’ll just wander around,” he said. “Are you sure?” “I’ll feel more comfortable doing that.”
<name>Madonna</name>	Madonna	Clarissa	When [MASK] appeared on his show it was considered a big deal, at first, because she didn’t do television talk shows. Struggling through an hour with her he understood why. She was a difficult guest, and he was sorry he’d asked.
<name>He</name>	He	Mannon	Sometimes [MASK] treated her like an idiot, and it was beginning to gall. Everything she did he sneered at and criticized, and she’d had enough. At lunch the women had been discussing a recent scandalous divorce. The wife was demanding and getting half of everything the billionaire husband possessed.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Wes	She took the boy’s hand and clicked her way across the wooden porch out onto the boardwalk. Hazy sunshine caught [MASK]’s attention as he watched her go. A pretty Chinese girl skateboarded by. He thought he might grab a few rays and liven up his complexion.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Clarissa	“You fine—me fine—baby fine. It’s good to be home.” “For how long?” He detected hostility in her voice. Was it possible she’d heard about [MASK] and him? Deny it. Deny it. And then deny it.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Reba	Just luck, I guess, he thought, as he struggled into his only suit, and tried to hide the frays around the collar of his one white shirt. Last week, [MASK] had turned up alone, no Mexican maid or fat son in tow.
<name>darling</name>	darling	Dennis	Too strongly? “Are you drunk?” he shouted. “How dare you! How can you—of all people—accuse me of having homosexual tendencies? Surely you know me better than that?” “Calm down, [MASK],” she said soothingly.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Clarissa	It’s too fucking late for justice. I’ve told you before—the scandal will ruin both your careers and kill The Murder stone cold. You want that? For what?” “Yes. I want that.” “Get serious, [MASK].
<name>his wife</name>	his wife	Clarissa	She apologized throughout their lovemaking for everything about herself. Then she fixed him a dish of nourishing lentil soup, and sent him back to [MASK] with the promise she would never tell. Fortunately she kept her word, and was now married to a dog trainer.
<name>Janine</name>	Janine	Clarissa	[MASK] taught him to center his feelings and care about himself more. “You’re much too nice to people,” she’d said. “They walk all over you and treat you like a fool.” He hadn’t realized that.
<name>He</name>	He	Howard	[MASK] hadn’t thought of anything as simple as that. “Would she mind?” “I don’t think for her. Give it a shot.” “That’s not a bad idea—” His attention wandered.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Heaven	Sweet. Phony. Shit! He went to bed and slept badly. In the morning he was awakened by [MASK] on the phone. She sounded suspiciously cheerful and suspiciously guilty. “What’s up?” he asked. “Do you need money?”
<name>baby</name>	baby	Vladimir	“Every time you look at it, darling, you’ll think of me!” He’d also received a Sony video camera and a closetful of new clothes. “Come here, [MASK],” she called.
<name>Norma</name>	Norma	Joy	“We’re being selfish, keeping you up. Why don’t I take you back to your hotel?” ‘Til take her,” said the secretary possessively. “Perhaps you would like to go through a scene or two before sleeping?” [MASK] suggested.
<name>Mr. Johnson</name>	Mr. Johnson	Howard	[MASK] made a gesture of compliance. “I’m all yours. Although it would have been better to have this meeting in my office where I’ve got all the facts and figures.” “I already have that information.”
<name>Miss Maudie</name>	Miss Maudie	Jade	He had a line of gossip on everyone. “She take the heroin.” “He a bigamist.” “She in the porno films.” “He only like two women.” “Stop!” [MASK] held up her hand sternly.
<name>He</name>	He	Mark	“Is she upset about the divorce?” He considered her question. [MASK] was smart; he never liked to get himself caught in a trap. “She’s had an extremely bad case of the flu,” he explained seriously. “It dragged on.
<name>Betty</name>	Betty	Poppy	She twirled for him. [MASK] was five feet two inches tall, rounded and perky. She had very long blond curls, slightly protruding blue eyes, and a permanent self-satisfied smile that went nicely with her retrousse nose.
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Antonio	“I’ve been busy. School... y’know.” “Yeah. I get the action.” A silence. “Can you help?” she asked impatiently. “I’ve got my tapes, and [MASK] has taken some brilliant pictures of me.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Wes	“Just call me [MASK],” he replied. “An’ don’t bother with the introductions ’cos I already know who you are.” “Really?” Her sarcastic tone was lost on him. “In that case you are one up on me.
<name>Biff</name>	Biff	Cheech	His brother pounded on the door. “What’s goin’ on in there?” he shouted in a slurred voice. “Thought we was goin’ t’a bar.” “I’m cornin’,” yelled [MASK] irritably, standing up and zipping his fly.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Wes	“Really?” Her sarcastic tone was lost on him. “In that case you are one up on me. I’m famous, you’re obviously not. What do you do ... [MASK]?” He was enjoying himself for a change.
<name>no one</name>	no one	Nora	“I hate these things,” she muttered to [MASK]. “All this smiling makes my face muscles ache.” She waved at the lighting cameraman—always an actress’s best friend—and graciously stopped by his table to meet his wife.
<name>Mr. Grey</name>	Mr. Grey	Mark	But she didn’t. She had her pride. He wasn’t going to walk into her life just like that and take over. With supreme willpower she disengaged herself. “Please, [MASK], go back to your hotel. We’ll see each other tomorrow.”
<name>he</name>	he	Zachary	She was outraged, furious, incensed. What was [MASK] doing at her wedding dinner? Who the hell had invited him? She had gone over the list of guests several times, making sure there were no enemies included.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Wes	“I am in charge. You vill please leave.” [MASK] flopped into an armchair. Frankly, he didn’t need this crap. He was all washed out. “I ain’t goin’ nowhere, sunshine. Don’t get your balls in an uproar.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Antonio	“You want some, cara?” “I’d love some, [MASK], dear. And if you are very good. I’ll invite you to my party later.” He beckoned one of his assistants.
<name>Valentine</name>	Valentine	Reba	Yeah, he thought, about as special as a corned beef sandwich. She had her blouse nearly off, revealing a pink Frederick’s of Hollywood push-up bra. He held up a warning hand. “Enough, [MASK].”
<name>he</name>	he	Wes	Not easy, but possible. Especially as [MASK] had never been publicly connected with her, and nobody knew who he was anyway. Naturally they all tried to talk her out of it. She listened to one minute of Who is he? You know nothing about him.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Howard	[MASK] noticed the older man was drinking a glass of water with a slice of lemon, and on the plate in front of him was a plain bran muffin. “I gotta rethink my eating habits,” he announced, as the waitress handed him a menu.
<name>Olivia</name>	Olivia	Clarissa	No way at all.” 94 [MASK] left the powder room, her pale face impassive. She ignored the activity around her—giggling women dressed to the hilt, two belly dancers hurrying to their makeshift dressing room, waiters rushing back and forth.
<name>Monica</name>	Monica	Poppy	“[MASK]—” “Be quiet. You know you love it.” Enclosing him with her mouth, she gave him her special kiss-of-life technique—the same technique she had used the first time they became more than just boss and secretary.
<name>Elvis</name>	Elvis	Donahue	Unlike [MASK], he did not roam through his audience with the hypnotizing speed of a tornado. He took it easy, sometimes loosening his tie (he always wore one) or taking off his jacket. He made his guests feel comfortable.
<name>trouble</name>	trouble	Bingo	I think it’s the least I can do. Without your quick action I don’t know what would have happened.” He heard a definite invitation in her voice. Don’t tell me I’ve scored again, he thought. Only this time it was [MASK] all the way home.
<name>Playboy</name>	Playboy	Playboy	So the great unwashed public had never spied upon her luscious nipples or her silken blond bush, even though [MASK] and similar magazines had begged, pleaded, even cried for her to reveal all—offering vast sums of money for the privilege. It was never enough.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Jack	“I got her the gig with College. Without me she’d be just another little girl tryin’ to make it.” “Back off,” warned [MASK]. “These contracts are going right over to my lawyer’s office.”
<name>Tony</name>	Tony	Wesley	A thin smile spread across her face, cracking her carelessly applied make-up. “Pay the money you owe, [MASK]. The big boys are impatient. I wouldn’t screw with them if I was you. It’s gettin’ dangerous."
<name>Rocky</name>	Rocky	Rocky	It goes on for fucking ever in every direction. You’re lucky I’m here at all.” “You really crack me up,” said [MASK], who looked like a poor man’s Sylvester Stallone—hence the name.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Carlos	“You’re one hell of a sexy old broad,” [MASK] said with a chuckle as he pulled up his pants. “Why’d we ever break up?” “A matter of ego,” she said crisply, adjusting her clothing. “Yours.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Shane	Anger flushed her face. He had a reputation. [MASK] had warned her—why hadn’t she listened? The roses were probably standard practice. And she had acted like a gullible idiot. Well, there was no way she was going to sit around and cry.
<name>the actress</name>	the actress	Clarissa	“We fall in love in this movie,” she had said. “We make love.” “We sure do!” he had joked in his usual lighthearted way. “When we interact on screen it has to be real,” [MASK] continued seriously.
<name>Aunt Reed</name>	Aunt Reed	Heaven	She sounded like she was planning a garden! “/ have a family,” he protested. “My father, and [MASK].” “Your father lives in a world of his own, you’ve often told me that. As for your niece...”
<name>Cher</name>	Cher	Heaven	decorated the ceilings. [MASK] glimmered and glittered her way through the party, an irresistible mixture of innocence and seduction in a white lace bodysuit worn with a black leather micro-skirt, lace-up gold boots, festoons of diamante jewelry, and a trailing gold trench coat.
<name>Tyler</name>	Tyler	Mannon	“You should see a shrink, you’ve got big problems.” [MASK] roared. “The only big problem I’ve got is my dick. You should have such problems.” He signaled the waiter and proceeded to order an enormous breakfast.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Whitney	He would never understand her success. What was it that took place between her and a camera? “I know that,” he said. “And I want you to know this: [MASK] stays. I’m flying in a special acting coach for her.
<name>Marlon</name>	Marlon	Clarissa	And when it wasn’t hot and muggy, it rained, putting the film even further behind schedule. Plus most of the cast and crew suffered at one time or other with what one wag had christened “The Mexican Hot Trot.” [MASK] was one of the fortunate few who escaped.
<name>he</name>	he	Antonio	She stretched languorously. “How about a break?” she suggested in a low, husky voice, standing up before finishing the sentence, uninterested in whether [MASK] cared to break or not. “My idea too, bellissima,” he said quickly.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Mark	Like—Why did you shove me out of your life as if I didn’t matter? Anger and frustration welled up inside her. What kind of crap was it not to know the identity of your own father? [MASK] emerged from the bedroom at nine-fifteen, tousled charm on full wattage.
<name>His father</name>	His father	Silver	He knew she was waiting to see what he planned to do about her ultimatum. And frankly, the more he thought about marriage, the more he loathed the whole idea. Who needed it? [MASK] had just married again.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Wes	I think I know your father.” [MASK] looked alarmed. “You do?” he asked, remembering a shifty-eyed English pimp whom he hadn’t seen since he was eight, and a potbellied American stepfather who had been in his life for no more than five minutes.
<name>Ari</name>	Ari	Sadie	“How would you like to walk away with eight million buckeroonies for one lousy movie?” He smiled. “If anyone can get me that kind of money, [MASK], it’ll be you.” She picked up a script sitting on the chair next to her.
<name>his friend</name>	his friend	Reba	he muttered to no one in particular. He was caught up in the crush himself, [MASK] was nowhere in sight, and when the fight started he knew this was not the place to be. Bad enough for him, because when blows got traded he always managed to catch one.
<name>she</name>	she	Norman	“I’ve got a lot of friends.” “We’ll have to find you a winner.” Laughingly she said, “Thanks, but I’m not shopping.” Driving home that night, [MASK] was full of how great she was.
<name>Jacob</name>	Jacob	Heaven	He was just thinking about taking one grateful teenager for a walk along the beach when he spotted [MASK], curled up in a comer, ignoring the wild action like it wasn’t even happening. With a growl of recognition, he pounced. “I made it!”
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Jade	“Why don’t we talk tomorrow when I’ve had a chance to uh... think this over?” He nodded, and raised a quizzical eyebrow. “This is a proposal, [MASK]. I have come to you hat in hand, so to speak.
<name>Madonna</name>	Madonna	Silver	There’s a recording deal in the works. Commercials, endorsements. Christ, [MASK], do you realize the money we can make?” “Are you sure?” she asked tentatively. She suffered from every performer’s lack of confidence when it came to viewing her own future.
<name>He</name>	He	Wes	“I asked you. You can’t come. I understand,” she said flatly. “Remember me next time,” he urged. “Sure,” she replied unenthusiastically. The dog appeared and wagged its tail. [MASK] leaned over and patted it.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Travis	Surprised us all, I can tell you.” “I surprised myself too,” he admitted truthfully. “You promised me a picture,” she reminded him reproachfully. “Oooh... / want a picture,” interrupted [MASK]. “Signed, if you please.
<name>Marilyn</name>	Marilyn	Clarissa	Sure she could. Because nobody ever recognized [MASK] off the screen. She answered the phone herself. “Hi, babe,” he said. “I was just sitting here thinking about you.” Her voice sounded muffled. “Who is this?”
<name>She</name>	She	Unity	[MASK] shrugged. “I think he returned a couple of calls.” “To whom?” Uneasily it occurred to her that maybe there was another woman in his life. After all, he was hardly keeping it zipped in his pants when she found him.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Everything	She wrapped her robe tightly around her and began to laugh. “Why on earth would I marry you?” [MASK] fell on top of him. He was too tired to take any more crap. “Yeah,” he said bitterly. “Why would y’wanna marry me?
