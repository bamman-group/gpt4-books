<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Bosch	Kept him under lock and key.” They went south on the 405. [MASK] was ten cars ahead, now staying in the slow lane. The freeway was thick with a stinking, polluting mass of moving steel.
<name>He</name>	He	Bosch	He rustled through the photos, occasionally pulling one out, raising his eyebrows, and then sliding it back into place. Finally, he found what he wanted. “Here. There it is.” [MASK] took the photo and studied it.
<name>Dr. Lecter</name>	Dr. Lecter	Salazar	“I would say it looks so,” [MASK] said. “Not enough to kill him, the trauma is too small. But possibly enough to get information from him. An electric charge can be very persuasive. I think there is ample history on that.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Bosch	[MASK] could see the dark gash dug into the crest of the hill at the north side of the cemetery but still could not make out what it was. It looked almost like a mass grave, a long gouge into the hill, a huge wound.
<name>he</name>	he	Bosch	She was quiet a moment, and [MASK] thought he saw the trace of a smile play on her lips. Then it was gone, if it had been there at all. “I guess that is a backhanded compliment,” she said.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Wish	It hadn’t been there the day before. “You said something about a video,” he said to [MASK]. “Oh, yes. I’ll get that set up and you can watch while I answer a few phone messages on other things.”
<name>He</name>	He	Bosch	No one was sitting behind the desk. They sat in two chairs facing the desk and waited. “Who is this we’re seeing?” [MASK] whispered. “I’ll introduce you, and he can tell you what he wants you to know about him,” she said.
<name>Carl</name>	Carl	Bosch	“Yes, I sent daisies. Like the ones growing on the hill below your house. I don’t see any in here.” Daisies, [MASK] thought. The vase he had knocked against the wall. Where are my goddam cigarettes, he wanted to yell.
<name>The protagonist</name>	The protagonist	Rourke	He keeps talking and you’ll end up walking. Out of here. Out of here. Someone’s coming, my arm’s humming. He laughed in his delirium and that made him vomit again. [MASK] just went on.
<name>Fin</name>	Fin	Bosch	You got your beeper and the Motorola turned off. And I saw a couple of the IAD silks up from downtown go in there with him a while ago.” [MASK] nodded without saying anything comforting to his partner. “What’s going on?”
<name>he</name>	he	Bosch	A quiet, shadowy man sits alone at the counter of a street-front diner. He looks across at another customer much like himself, but only the second man is with a woman. Somehow, [MASK] identified with it, with that first man.
<name>Max</name>	Max	Bosch	[MASK] rocked the steering wheel from side to side as he picked up speed. The suspension felt a little loose. He had no idea what the extent of the damage was. When he tried to check the side-view mirror he saw it was gone.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Bosch	[MASK] came back into the living room and looked around. There wasn’t much. A couch covered with green vinyl was pushed against one wall, a stuffed chair was against the opposite wall with a small color television on the carpet next to it.
<name>Andy</name>	Andy	Harry	The whys you never really know. You just need the hows and the whos.” “You know, [MASK], if they’re out there, or I should say, under there, digging a new tunnel, then we have less than two days to find them.
<name>Castle</name>	Castle	Bosch	“A stun gun,” the pathologist said. “Look for one that fires its electrode dart deep into the skin tissue. About three to four centimeters deep. Though in this case, it is likely the electrode was manually pressed deeper into the chest.” [MASK] thought a moment.
<name>Rainsford</name>	Rainsford	Bosch	[MASK] didn’t move and barely breathed for a whole minute. Stinging sweat dripped into his eyes. He closed them but heard nothing but the sound of the black water. Then slowly he moved back to the edge until he could see the dark form again.
<name>Assange</name>	Assange	Pounds	He is up to something. Find out what. And build your one point eighty-one case along the way. The Federal Bureau of Investigation may have withdrawn its complaint, but we will not back off.” “What about [MASK], you still want him copied?”
<name>Unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Bosch	“[MASK], this could mean our jobs. How could you do this without consulting me?” “For that reason. It could mean my job. You didn’t know.” “I’d never prove it. The whole thing looks like a setup.
<name>The teacher</name>	The teacher	Wish	He was moving his weight from one foot to the other now, like a boxer in his corner impatiently waiting for the next round to begin so he could deliver the knockout punch on a fading opponent. [MASK] continued to sit silently at her desk.
<name>The administrator</name>	The administrator	Rourke	“[MASK] did. He couldn’t—” “The administrator.” “Let me finish. He couldn’t justify the cost of continued surveillance without any results. We were going on a hunch, nothing more. You’re just looking at it from hindsight.
<name>Bosch</name>	Bosch	Bosch	You knew what would happen with a guy like that. Look at the Night Stalker. He’ll never get the gas. Or it’ll take twenty years.” [MASK] felt uncomfortable. He had only thought of his motives and actions in the Dollmaker case when alone.
<name>Hook</name>	Hook	Binh	Police Captain [MASK] pays people to get him and his share of diamonds out. Who he pays, we don’t know. But we do know that he gets VIP treatment all the way. Most people took boats out, he flew.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Harry	When he had opened it Sunday night he had opened a dark memory. He now found himself entranced by it, the distance of time having faded the threat as well as the photos. Sometime after dark the phone rang and [MASK] picked it up before the tape machine.
<name>John</name>	John	Bosch	As [MASK] turned to the office door he hesitated and said, “Colonel, do you mind me asking what other vehicles you have on the farm? I saw the pickup.” “We don’t mind you asking, because we have nothing to hide.
<name>He</name>	He	Binh	We’d like to keep this as informal as possible. We sit at desks all day, to tell you the truth.” [MASK] shrugged his shoulders as though it made no difference to him, that they were inconveniencing him no matter where they sat.
<name>Leonard</name>	Leonard	Harry	“That’s the name.” “You gave him one of your business cards?” “Right.” “[MASK], you aren’t looking for him anymore.” “Tell me about it.” “Come on out and see for yourself.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Bosch	Unseen, but there. And closing in. When the phone rang in the kitchen, [MASK] immediately woke. He counted the rings, wondering if he had missed the first one or two, wondering if he had left the answering machine on. He hadn’t.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Tran	It was about three minutes before [MASK] came out, followed by the suit, who carried a metal safe-deposit box about the size of a woman’s shoe box. The bodyguard took up the rear, and the three men walked out of the glass room, out of sight.
<name>He</name>	He	Avery	That’s why we need you, sir. Would you step into the car, please?” [MASK] took two tentative steps toward the IAD car and then seemed to decide, What the heck. He moved quickly to the passenger side and got in.
<name>the lab</name>	the lab	Sally	You know that. So what’s your goddam hurry?” “Are. Tox results are at least a ten-day wait.” “Fuck off.” “Just tell [MASK] I need the prelim done today. I’ll be by later.”
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Bosch	“Anyway, we had to set up our own. And our cables weren’t long enough to put the generator up here. It’s in there screaming like a five-horsepower baby.” He turned to head back into the tunnel but [MASK] reached out and touched his shoulder.
<name>Johnson</name>	Johnson	Meadows	“Go get ’im and bring ’im out here so we can get ’im a decent burial,” the lieutenant said. [MASK] said, “We wouldn’t leave any of our own in there, either.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Bosch	Extreme Terminal Performance. A bullet that expanded on impact to 1.5 times its width, reaching terminal depth in the body and leaving maximum wound channels. Whoever had written it had been right. [MASK] had killed a man a year earlier with one shot from twenty feet.
<name>Mac</name>	Mac	Rourke	[MASK] waited a beat to let his words sink in, then said, “You see. Captain, I am not going to hedge on safety on this operation. I can’t. These men that are down there, they don’t scare. They kill.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Rourke	It made him dizzy, and his arm screamed to be left alone. He felt nausea overtake him and reached for a stainless steel pan on the bed table. The feeling subsided. But it jogged loose a memory of being in the tunnel with [MASK] the morning before.
<name>Trang</name>	Trang	Tran	And could, and would, do it. “No, I won’t tell them___But if I don’t hear in a few days that you went in, I will tell Binh. And I’ll tell [MASK]. I won’t need to prove it to them.
<name>Batman</name>	Batman	Bosch	“Look, [MASK], I know about you. I’ll admit we pulled your files, we checked you out. Hell, but to do that, all we had to do was read the newspapers back then. You and that Dollmaker thing.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Bosch	They were well oiled and cared for. The rubber soles showed only modest wear. Stuck in one of the deep grooves of the tread of the right shoe was a white stone. [MASK] pried it out with the scalpel. It was a small chunk of cement.
<name>John</name>	John	Bosch	“Maybe everything,” [MASK] said. He started walking back to his car but then turned around, remembering something he had read about the memorial. “There’s a book. It tells where the names are on the wall. You can look them up.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Eleanor	I didn’t at first, and then when I wanted to tell you I couldn’t. I thought it would spoil everything. I guess it did, anyway.” “Why didn’t you at first, [MASK]? Because there was still a question about me?”
<name>Scorpio</name>	Scorpio	Salazar	Behind him he heard [MASK] using the shears to open up the dead man’s chest. The detective pulled each pocket out and looked at the lint. He turned the socks inside out and checked the inside lining of the pants and shirt. Nothing.
<name>Bob Marley</name>	Bob Marley	Arson	His dreads flopped down past his eyes and he could smell some of the coconut stuff he had put in his hair the night before at the Jaguar guy’s house. That was after [MASK] had broken the guy’s nose and the blood got everywhere.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Bosch	Now [MASK] was able to place the address in his mind, and he remembered the dark smoked glass of the building. He had never been inside the bank. A bank heist with jewelry taken, he thought. It didn’t make much sense. He studied the list.
<name>Theo</name>	Theo	Bosch	“Only a select few. You see, we charge a hefty fee. We must bring in a security guard to do it.” “How long does it take to do the override and swing the door open?” [MASK] asked. “Not long.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Porter	It’s one of them private bottle clubs. [MASK] gives me the number when we’re first introduced as partners and tells me that’s where he’ll be most nights. Tells me he works a security detail there.
<name>Andy</name>	Andy	Sharkey	Nothing made sense. “[MASK] was a tough little bastard,” he said. “You think he just went walking with somebody into that tunnel? I think he didn’t have a choice. And to do that, it maybe took somebody with a badge.”
<name>the man</name>	the man	Irving	If I don’t get it, I don’t get it. Who cares? ” “[MASK].” “Well, fuck him. He tells us he wants more documentation. He’ll get it. I’m only trying to do what the man says.”
<name>Steve</name>	Steve	Bosch	These guys get in after they raised the college requirement, or what?” “Hey, [MASK], we get a call, we’ve got to check it out. Okay? You want for us to transfer all our body calls directly to the homicide table to check out?
<name>unknown</name>	unknown	Eleanor	“What are you looking at?” “I don’t know.” It was [MASK]. “I was wondering if you knew me. You seem familiar. I didn’t realize I was staring.” “What? Why should I know you?
<name>Indiana</name>	Indiana	Harry	“[MASK], be careful. There may be more than two.” Her voice echoed in the steel room. He looked down into the hole and got his bearings. When he heard the vault door click shut and there was only blackness, he jumped.
<name>probably</name> (Note: There is no proper name that fits in this context, so this is a guess based on the surrounding words.)	probably (Note: There is no proper name that fits in this context, so this is a guess based on the surrounding words.)	Harry	Like we figured. His file is still classified. I called a guy I know out there and asked him to send it out. He called me back and said no can do.” “Why would it still be classified?” “Who knows, [MASK]?
<name>Bunk</name>	Bunk	Bosch	We got drive-bys, floaters, a sex case. People are dying to meet us, [MASK]. There is no rest for the weary, and that means no time for what you think might be a case. Listen to your partner for once.
<name>Chris</name>	Chris	Caller	It wasn’t a nine one one line, so there’s no tape or trace. Came in right to the Hollywood desk. [MASK] was a male, that’s all the dipshit, one of those fat Explorer kids who took it, could tell us.”
<name>Ballard</name>	Ballard	Bernie	Looks like accidental but [MASK]’s waiting on us to check the bullet track and powder stippling. He wants to close it. I told him we’d get to it late today, so he came in. Only we aren’t going to get to it at all today.
<name>Bosco</name>	Bosco	Bosch	he said without looking up. “What do I want?” the duty detective said. “I want to know what the fuck you are doing, [MASK]. This isn’t your place anymore. You can’t just come in here like you’re running the crew.
<name>him</name>	him	Meadows	But you already know that. So for me, fine. I’ll drop it. But I need what you have on [MASK]. You pulled his files back in September. You must have done a workup on him. Surveillance, known associates, background.
<name>Wilmer</name>	Wilmer	Meadows	“Well, I don’t know. Could have been a lot of things. They could have had a tail on [MASK] ’cause they didn’t trust him and could have seen him go into the pawnshop. Could’ve been a lot of things.”
<name>Ed</name>	Ed	Obinna	I been waiting now since five a.m. in the morning.” “Give me your phone. I’ll get somebody over.” [MASK] took the receiver off a wall phone behind one of the damaged counters and handed it across.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Bosch	Like any careful cop she sat facing the front door, so she didn’t see [MASK] until he slid onto the bench across from her and picked up the menu she had already scanned and dropped on the table. He said, “Never been here, anything good?”
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Wish	All that jewelry and bonds and stocks, and nothing ever turns up except for a single bracelet. Not even any of the other worthless things that were taken.” “They are sitting on it until they think they are clear,” [MASK] said.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Mary	They were getting ready for a BOR. I’m not sure which case.” “Well, [MASK], they will have to cancel the Board of Rights—and please do not talk to me in abbreviations. I am a slow-moving, careful policeman.
<name>the witness</name>	the witness	Irving	Or she’s coming back to meet him for a nooner. You know what I say? I say we let him go and we go back to talk to [MASK]. I think we can build something on this witness thing. Maybe dereliction of duty.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Bosch	Okay? You want for us to transfer all our body calls directly to the homicide table to check out? You guys’d go nuts inside a week.” [MASK] crushed the cigarette butt in the stainless steel sink, and looked out the kitchen window.
<name>partner</name>	partner	Harry	“You would do that, [MASK]?” “I said I would. I’ll give you two days to go in. Then I tell them the story.” She looked at him, and the pained expression on her face asked why.
<name>Finlay</name>	Finlay	Edgar	“You’re saying he’s in the gang files but he isn’t in a gang?” “Right.” [MASK] nodded and said, “He still could’ve been taken down by somebody who thought he was a gangbanger.”
<name>Marcel's</name>	Marcel's	Binh	“They hit several of the boxes to cover that all they really wanted was what was in [MASK]’s box. Okay?” She nodded. They still weren’t walking. “Okay. So in order to keep that cover, what would be the thing to do?
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Edgar	The corner of the sheet was back between the mattress and the box spring. [MASK] was right. He next opened the six bureau drawers. What clothes there were—underwear, white and dark socks and several T-shirts—were neatly folded and seemed undisturbed.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Meadows	We got [MASK]’s. We got yours. Others.” “How many others?” She pushed a six-inch stack of manila files across her desk. “They’re all here. Have a look if you want.”
<name>her</name>	her	Bosch	“We are due south of the front door of the pawnshop. A clear view of nothing going on.” “We’re east. Can see the—” She clicked off the mike and looked at [MASK]. “We forgot a code for the vault.
<name>John</name>	John	Hanlon	He heard a sharp pounding and looked through the glass wall and the lobby to see [MASK] pounding the heel of his gun on the glass front door. From that angle the FBI agent could not see that the glass wall of the vault room had been shattered.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Bosch	He was poking through a Dumpster with a stick. The cart was half full of aluminum cans. [MASK] walked away and sat down on the bed and put his head back against the wall where the headboard should have been and the white paint was a dingy gray.
<name>Nguyen</name>	Nguyen	Joe	That’s ten days after arrival this guy gets a visa. That’s too fast for the average [MASK]. Or in this case, the average Ngo.” “So what do you think?” “Hard to say. He could have been an operative.
<name>He</name>	He	Bosch	The bracelet. His partners found out and whacked him. Then they broke into the pawnshop and stole the bracelet back.” She shook her head, admiring the plan. “The thing would still be perfect if he hadn’t done that.” [MASK] nodded.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Bosch	He was heading toward one of the typewriters with an arrest report in his hand and didn’t notice [MASK] until he had sat down. He looked around when he smelled the cigarettes and coffee and saw the detective with the sling.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Bosch	He was rolling over her and they were both tumbling toward the sidewalk when his car lurched violently and there was a high-pitched keening sound of tearing metal. [MASK] saw a shower of blue sparks pass in his peripheral vision.
<name>He</name>	He	Harry	He was one of the ones that didn’t come back.” She walked out. [MASK] ate the last slice of pizza. It was cold and he hated anchovies and he felt he deserved it that way. Same for the Coke, which was warm.
<name>James</name>	James	Grant	Would you like coffee, perhaps some brandy? It is near the cocktail hour, of course. Just one of the little services we provide that a banking institution cannot.” [MASK] laughed then, silently, with his head nodding up and down.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Bosch	[MASK] felt around in his pockets for his cigarettes, then remembered she had said no. “We have to work together on this one. Right now.” He knew by her face it hadn’t worked. He emptied his coffee cup, ready for the door.
<name>Tom Cruise</name>	Tom Cruise	Bosch	A DUI unit had been called to give [MASK] a sobriety test. He passed. And by 2 a.m. he sat in an interview room at the West Los Angeles bureau, bone-tired and wondering if the Coast Guard or IRS would be next.
<name>security</name>	security	Irving	Only family, and I am told you don’t have family, so no calls.” “How’d that lady FBI agent get by you?” “She was cleared by [MASK]. Go back into your room, please.” “Certainly.”
<name>Batman</name>	Batman	Bosch	“It’s [MASK]. Still got you working Sundays, huh?” “Two to ten, every Sunday, no parole. So, what’s up? I haven’t talked to you since, uh, your problem with the Dollmaker case.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Bosch	Two cops and a feebee down in one shoot-out. Not to mention you gettin’ your arm all fucked up. Probably some kind of a record for this town. Mind if I have a cup?” [MASK] gestured to the coffeepot.
<name>the police</name>	the police	Bosch	He was arrested at the dam two months ago, but had gone back there to sleep Sunday morning. He looked through the rest of the papers in the file for indications of other habits that would help [MASK] find him.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Edgar	I’m assigning you a new partner. I don’t know who, but I’ll let you know. Okay, go on, that’s all.” [MASK] let out one more audible breath and stood up.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Bosch	And why did they have to break into the pawnshop? You’re suggesting that he told them where the bracelet was but didn’t give up the ticket?” [MASK] had thought about this, too. He said, “I don’t know.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Rourke	And then one day the seed planted all those years ago came out of the ground, man. It was there for the taking and, man, we took it. I took it! That’s why now.” A gloating smile played across [MASK]’s face.
<name>Lena</name>	Lena	Wish	The waitress walked away, writing on the pad. “I thought you were a cream-and-sugar cop,” [MASK] said. “Only when people try to guess what I am.” Her eyes seemed to soften then, but only a bit.
<name>McNulty</name>	McNulty	Bosch	“[MASK],” he said, “we all know what a smart guy you are, but we are not going to hear it today. I stop the tape only this once. If I do it again, I will have your badge in a glass block by Tuesday morning.
<name>Abra</name>	Abra	Eleanor	“You eat that, you might never get out of here.” He looked up. It was [MASK]. She stood in the open door, smiling. He smiled back. He couldn’t help himself. “I know.”
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Meadows	He thought about [MASK]’s eleven-month lease, paid in advance. If he were alive, he would be moving out next week. As they walked through the garden of white stone, it all seemed to fit together. There was no sand left in the top of the hourglass.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Wish	So if he didn’t give them the pawn slip, how’d they know where the bracelet was?” “He told them, I guess,” [MASK] said. “I don’t think so. I don’t see him giving up one and not the other.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Arson	I’m staying till I score. I’m gonna eat.” As he said this he watched a maroon Jaguar XJ6 pull into the convenience store’s lot. “How about the guy in the pipe?” [MASK] asked. “You think they found him yet?
<name>Mark</name>	Mark	Sharkey	His breathing was fast and shallow. They passed the generator thirty feet in and in another thirty feet or so [MASK] was lying on the tunnel floor under the brutal light of the strobes. The boy’s head was propped against the tunnel wall at an unnatural angle.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Hanlon	She hesitated and her eyebrows went up again. “Well, I went down with [MASK]. But when we got out of the hand-dug tunnel we split up. He went one way in that first line and I went the other. I picked the winner.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Bosch	When he heard the vault door click shut and there was only blackness, he jumped. As he came down in the rubble [MASK] crouched and fired a shot from his Smith & Wesson into the blackness and then hurled himself flat against the bottom of the tunnel.
<name>the vault</name>	the vault	Tran	“What if they split before reinforcements come?” “I’m staying with that vault. I don’t care about [MASK]. You want the keys? You can take the car and tail him.” “No, I’ll stay with the vault.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Harry	“[MASK], I thought you were in the hospital or something.” “I thought I’d come by. But I didn’t know it was going to be a circus. Don’t you people have anything better to do?” “Hey, I’m not with them.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Lewis	[MASK] asked. “Yesterday and today.” “Did he already know?” “No. He seemed surprised. He asked detailed questions on how long it would take to open the vault, what I had to do, things like that.
<name>McGill</name>	McGill	Bosch	[MASK] knew that because of the immense duplication of records in any police department, all six entries could be and probably were from the same case or report of a missing or stolen bracelet. He called the abbreviated crime reports up on the computer screen and found that his suspicion was correct.
<name>he</name>	he	Bosch	Our mistake.” She slugged him on the shoulder and told him to never mind the piano. They settled into an easy silence. Surveillance jobs were the bane of most detectives’ existence. But in his fifteen years on the job [MASK] had never minded a single stakeout.
