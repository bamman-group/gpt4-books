<name>music</name>	music	Aphrodite	As I glance at them, they each recall some task or pleasure of the coming day. A half-moulded child's head; [MASK]; a bough of forest-leaves; music; work; homely fragments, in which lie the secrets of all eternal truth and beauty.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Wolfe	The distances, the shadows, the still, marble figures, the mass of silent kneeling worshippers, the mysterious music, thrilled, lifted his soul with a wonderful pain. [MASK] forgot himself, forgot the new life he was going to live, the mean terror gnawing underneath.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Deborah	If you could go into this mill where [MASK] lay, and drag out from the hearts of these men the terrible tragedy of their lives, taking it as a symptom of the disease of their class, no ghost Horror would terrify you more.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Lord	Three days after, he tried it again: that time reached the wall. [MASK] help you! he fought like a tiger,--giv' some terrible blows. Fightin' for life, you see; for he can't live long, shut up in the stone crib down yonder.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Hugh	She had seen the look on his face, as he turned away: her own grew deadly. Yet, as she came up to him, her eyes glowed. He was seated on an old chest, quiet, holding his face in his hands. “[MASK]!”
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Kirby	The Doctor looked vexed, puzzled. Some terrible problem lay hid in this woman's face, and troubled these men. [MASK] waited for an answer, and, receiving none, went on, warming with his subject.
<name>Zilpah</name>	Zilpah	Wolfe	there'll be lashin's o' drink,--the Vargent be blessed and praised for't!” They went on, the mulatto inclining for a moment to show fight, and drag the woman [MASK] off with them; but, being pacified, she staggered away.
<name>God</name>	God	God!--shaking	Clutching it, as if the tightness of his hold would strengthen his sense of possession, he went aimlessly down the street. It was his watch at the mill. He need not go, need never go again, thank [MASK] off the thought with unspeakable loathing.
<name>Black Jack</name>	Black Jack	Kirby	But the cool, probing eyes were turned on himself now,--mocking, cruel, relentless. “Not hungry for meat,” the furnace-tender said at last. “What then? Whiskey?” jeered [MASK], with a coarse laugh.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Deborah	“Where's the father?” asked [MASK], holding out a potato, which the girl greedily seized. “He's beyant,--wid Haley,--in the stone house.” (Did you ever hear the word tail from an Irish mouth?) “I came here.
<name>Nellie</name>	Nellie	Deborah	Even [MASK] muttered, as she crept through, “looks like t' Devil's place!” It did,--in more ways than one. She found the man she was looking for, at last, heaping coal on a furnace.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hugh	[MASK]! dunnot look at me, when it wur my fault! To think I brought hur to it! And I loved hur so! Oh lad, I dud!” The confession, even In this wretch, came with the woman's blush through the sharp cry.
<name>Aylmer</name>	Aylmer	Wolfe	Out of the blocks of this korl, [MASK], in his off-hours from the furnace, had a habit of chipping and moulding figures,--hideous, fantastic enough, but sometimes strangely beautiful: even the mill-men saw that, while they jeered at him.
<name>Lily</name>	Lily	Wolfe	[MASK]'s artist-eye grew drunk with color. The gates of that other world! Fading, flashing before him now! What, in that world of Beauty, Content, and Right, were the petty laws, the mine and thine, of mill-owners and mill hands?
<name>God</name>	God	Hur	She shut her lips tightly, that she might not scream; the cold drops of sweat broke over her, in her dumb agony. “[MASK] knows best,” she muttered at last, fiercely clutching the boards where she lay.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Hugh	He looked at her. She was young, in deadly earnest; her faded eyes, and wet, ragged figure caught from their frantic eagerness a power akin to beauty. “[MASK], it is true! Money ull do it!
<name>Abigail</name>	Abigail	Hugh	If one of t' witch people wud come, them we heard oft' home, and gif hur all hur wants, what then? Say, [MASK]!” “What do you mean?” “I mean money.” Her whisper shrilled through his brain.
<name>Doctor</name>	Doctor	May	[MASK] stopped, heated, glowing with his own magnanimity. And it was magnanimous. The puddler had drunk in every word, looking through the Doctor's flurry, and generous heat, and self-approval, into his will, with those slow, absorbing eyes of his.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Wolfe	“Them irons will need a crow-bar beside your tin, before you can open 'em.” [MASK] laughed, too, in a senseless way. “I think I'll get out,” he said.
<name>Eppie</name>	Eppie	Deborah	A heap of ragged coats was heaved up, and the face of a young girl emerged, staring sleepily at the woman. “[MASK],” she said, at last, “I'm here the night.” “Yes, child.
<name>statistics</name>	statistics	Humanity	He held up [MASK] in its grand total; showed the great world-cancer to his people. Who could show it better? He was a Christian reformer; he had studied the age thoroughly; his outlook at man had been free, world-wide, over all time.
<name>Tom Sawyer</name>	Tom Sawyer	Kirby	There was outcry and crowd enough in the cell the next day. The coroner and his jury, the local editors, [MASK] himself, and boys with their hands thrust knowingly into their pockets and heads on one side, jammed into the corners. Coming and going all day.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Haley	Was he going mad? She peered closely into his face. Something she saw there made her draw suddenly back,--something which [MASK] had not seen, that lay beneath the pinched, vacant look it had caught since the trial, or the curious gray shadow that rested on it.
<name>the turnkey</name>	the turnkey	Haley	He was scratching the iron bars of the window with a piece of tin which he had picked up, with an idle, uncertain, vacant stare, just as a child or idiot would do. “Tryin' to get out, old boy?” laughed [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Summat	“I dunno,” he said, with a bewildered look. “It mebbe. [MASK] to make her live, I think,--like you. Whiskey ull do it, in a way.” The young man laughed again.
<name>Dr. John</name>	Dr. John	Kirby	“They have ample facilities for studying anatomy,” sneered [MASK], glancing at the half-naked figures. “Look,” continued the Doctor, “at this bony wrist, and the strained sinews of the instep! A working-woman,--the very type of her class.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Haley	She nodded, saying nothing, looked in his face again, and went out of the door. As she went, she staggered. “Drinkin' to-day?” broke out [MASK], pushing her before him. “Where the Devil did you get it?
<name>hair</name>	hair	korl	Now, Doctor, the pocket of the world having uttered its voice, what has the heart to say? You are a philanthropist, in a small Way,--n'est ce pas? Here, boy, this gentleman can show you how to cut [MASK] better,--or your destiny.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Deborah	[MASK] was stupid with sleep; her back pained her sharply; and her teeth chattered with cold, with the rain that soaked her clothes and dripped from her at every step. She stood, however, patiently holding the pail, and waiting. “Hout, woman!
<name>John</name>	John	Mitchell	[MASK] started back, half-frightened, as, suddenly turning a corner, the white figure of a woman faced him in the darkness,--a woman, white, of giant proportions, crouching on the ground, her arms flung out in some wild gesture of warning.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Deborah	Suddenly they grew less boisterous,--at the far end, entirely silent. Something unusual had happened. After a moment, the silence came nearer; the men stopped their jeers and drunken choruses. [MASK], stupidly lifting up her head, saw the cause of the quiet.
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Deborah	The woman [MASK] was like him; only her face was even more ghastly, her lips bluer, her eyes more watery. She wore a faded cotton gown and a slouching bonnet. When she walked, one could see that she was deformed, almost a hunchback.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Wolfe	[MASK] rose at last, and turned from the church down the street. He looked up; the night had come on foggy, damp; the golden mists had vanished, and the sky lay dull and ash-colored.
<name>Magwitch</name>	Magwitch	Deborah	[MASK] groped her way into the cellar, and, after considerable stumbling, kindled a match, and lighted a tallow dip, that sent a yellow glimmer over the room. It was low, damp,--the earthen floor covered with a green, slimy moss,--a fetid air smothering the breath.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Mitchell	“Who did it?” “Can't say. Some of the hands; chipped it out in off-hours.” “Chipped to some purpose, I should say. What a flesh-tint the stuff has! Do you see, [MASK]?”
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Janey	Wud hur take me out o' this place wid hur and [MASK]? I wud not come into the gran' house hur wud build, to vex hur wid t' hunch,--only at night, when t' shadows were dark, stand far off to see hur.”
<name>Eppie</name>	Eppie	Hugh	“To the mill, with [MASK]'s supper.” “Let him bide till th' morn. Sit ye down.” “No, no,”--sharply pushing her off. “The boy'll starve.” She hurried from the cellar, while the child wearily coiled herself up for sleep.
<name>Uncle Tom</name>	Uncle Tom	Deb	He did not answer. She wrung her hands, trying to be silent, looking in his face in an agony of entreaty. He smiled again, kindly. “It is best, [MASK]. I cannot bear to be hurted any more.
<name>Montmorency</name>	Montmorency	Kirby	laughed the Doctor. “I do not think at all.” “That is true philosophy. Drift with the stream, because you cannot dive deep enough to find bottom, eh?” “Exactly,” rejoined [MASK]. “I do not think.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Joe	It was a little thing; but it hurt him,--this disappointment. “Good-bye, [MASK]!” he called, sorrowfully enough. “Be quiet!” said one of the jailers, passing the door, striking on it with his club.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Wolfe	Such men are not rare in the States. As he knocked the ashes from his cigar, [MASK] caught with a quick pleasure the contour of the white hand, the blood-glow of a red ring he wore.
<name>Evangeline</name>	Evangeline	Janey	The girl [MASK] slept heavily in the corner. He went up to her, touching softly the worn white arm with his fingers. Some bitterer thought stung him, as he stood there. He wiped the drops from his forehead, and went into the room beyond, livid, trembling.
<name>he</name>	he	Hugh	Slow, solemn tears gathered in her eyes: the poor weak eyes turned so hopelessly to the place where [MASK] was to rest, the grave heights looking higher and brighter and more solemn than ever before. The Quaker watched her keenly.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Wolfe	The furnace where [MASK] worked was near the bounds of the works; they halted there hot and tired: a walk over one of these great foundries is no trifling task. The woman, drawing out of sight, turned over to sleep.
<name>Johnsy</name>	Johnsy	Wolfe	He went to [MASK] and put his hand kindly on his arm. Something of a vague idea possessed the Doctor's brain that much good was to be done here by a friendly word or two: a latent genius to be warmed into life by a waited-for sunbeam.
<name>one of the strangers</name>	one of the strangers	Kirby	The mills were deserted on Sundays, except by the hands who fed the fires, and those who had no lodgings and slept usually on the ash-heaps. The three strangers sat still during the next hour, watching the men cover the furnaces, laughing now and then at some jest of [MASK]'s.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Neff	He whistled, hoping he would look up; but he did not. He wondered if [MASK] remembered he was there,--if any of the boys thought of him up there, and thought that he never was to go down that old cinder-road again. Never again!
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Wolfe	[MASK] and the woman had stood in the shadow of the works as the coach drove off. The Doctor had held out his hand in a frank, generous way, telling him to “take care of himself, and to remember it was his right to rise.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Wolfe	She lay quiet in the dark corner, listening, through the monotonous din and uncertain glare of the works, to the dull plash of the rain in the far distance, shrinking back whenever the man [MASK] happened to look towards her.
<name>Madame Defarge</name>	Madame Defarge	Deborah	Is it my fault that I am no better? My fault? My fault?” He stopped, stung with a sudden remorse, seeing her hunchback shape writhing with sobs. For [MASK] was crying thankless tears, according to the fashion of women.
<name>Karl Marx</name>	Karl Marx	Liberte	“I tell you, there's something wrong that no talk of '[MASK]' or 'Egalite' will do away. If I had the making of men, these men who do the lowest part of the world's work should be machines,--nothing more,--hands.
<name>John</name>	John	Hugh	“Come home, [MASK]!” she said, coaxingly; for he had stopped, looking around bewildered. “Home,--and back to the mill!” He went on saying this over to himself, as if he would mutter down every pain in this dull despair.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Wolfe	It left him but once during the night, when, for the second time in his life, he entered a church. It was a sombre Gothic pile, where the stained light lost itself in far-retreating arches; built to meet the requirements and sympathies of a far other class than [MASK]'s.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Deborah	He bared his arms, looking intently at their corded veins and sinews. [MASK], listening in the next cell, heard a slight clicking sound, often repeated. She shut her lips tightly, that she might not scream; the cold drops of sweat broke over her, in her dumb agony.
<name>Maskelyne</name>	Maskelyne	Mitchell	“What has the man who pays them money to do with their souls' concerns, more than the grocer or butcher who takes it?” “And yet,” said [MASK]'s cynical voice, “look at her! How hungry she is!”
<name>Nell</name>	Nell	Hugh	The man sat down on the cinder-road, looking up into the murky sky. “'T be late, [MASK]. Wunnot hur come?” He shook his head doggedly, and the woman crouched out of his sight against the wall.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Nature	Physically, [MASK] had promised the man but little. He had already lost the strength and instinct vigor of a man, his muscles were thin, his nerves weak, his face ( a meek, woman's face) haggard, yellow with consumption.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Wolfe	he said, seating himself lightly on a stone with the air of an amused spectator at a play. “Are you answered?”--turning to [MASK] his clear, magnetic face. Bright and deep and cold as Arctic air, the soul of the man lay tranquil beneath.
<name>Silas</name>	Silas	Janey	When that stimulant was gone, she would take to whiskey. Man cannot live by work alone. While she was skinning the potatoes, and munching them, a noise behind her made her stop. “[MASK]!” she called, lifting the candle and peering into the darkness.
<name>John</name>	John	Hugh	With a woman's quick instinct, she saw that he was not hungry,--was eating to please her. Her pale, watery eyes began to gather a strange light. “Is't good, [MASK]? T' ale was a bit sour, I feared.”
<name>he</name>	he	Haley	He thrust the whole matter away. A dark, cold quiet crept through his brain. It was all wrong; but let it be! It was nothing to him more than the others. Let it be! The door grated, as [MASK] opened it.
<name>Mr. Wopsle</name>	Mr. Wopsle	Kirby	How hungry she is!” [MASK] tapped his boot with his cane. No one spoke. Only the dumb face of the rough image looking into their faces with the awful question, “What shall we do to be saved?”
<name>Colonel Protheroe</name>	Colonel Protheroe	Mitchell,--him	When the sentence was read, he just looked up, and said the money was his by rights, and that all the world had gone wrong. That night, after the trial, a gentleman came to see him here, name of [MASK] as he stole from.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Wolfe	I want you to come down and look at this [MASK], standing there among the lowest of his kind, and see him just as he is, that you may judge him justly when you hear the story of this night.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Hugh	It was to be her last word. What was it? “[MASK], boy, not THAT!” He did not answer. She wrung her hands, trying to be silent, looking in his face in an agony of entreaty. He smiled again, kindly.
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Mitchell	He said it over slowly, as one repeats the guessed answer to a riddle, doubtfully. “That is it? Money?” “Yes, money,--that is it,” said [MASK], rising, and drawing his furred coat about him.
<name>the jailer</name>	the jailer	Haley	Not usual in such cases; but he had made two desperate efforts to escape. “Well,” as [MASK], the jailer, said, “small blame to him! Nineteen years' imprisonment was not a pleasant thing to look forward to.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Wolfe	“Ask him,” said the other, dryly, “There he stands,”--pointing to [MASK], who stood with a group of men, leaning on his ash-rake. The Doctor beckoned him with the affable smile which kind-hearted men put on, when talking to these people.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	May	“You do not mean”--said [MASK], facing him. “Yes, I mean just that. Reform is born of need, not pity. No vital movement of the people's has worked down, for good or evil; fermented, instead, carried up the heaving, cloggy mass.
<name>Mr. Jabez Wilson</name>	Mr. Jabez Wilson	Hugh	The roll was a small green pocket-book containing one or two gold pieces, and a check for an incredible amount, as it seemed to the poor puddler. He laid it down, hiding his face again in his hands. “[MASK], don't be angry wud me!
<name>Esau</name>	Esau	Esau	Who blames her? Something is lost in the passage of every soul from one eternity to the other,--something pure and beautiful, which might have been and was not: a hope, a talent, a love, over which the soul mourns, like [MASK] deprived of his birthright.
<name>John</name>	John	Kirby	Who is responsible?” “Not I, I tell you,” said [MASK], testily. “What has the man who pays them money to do with their souls' concerns, more than the grocer or butcher who takes it?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Hugh	That woman, now, she's desper't'. Been beggin' to see [MASK], as she calls him, for three days. I'm a-goin' to let her in. She don't go with him. Here she is in this next cell.
<name>Magwitch</name>	Magwitch	Hugh	Did hur hear? Money, money,--that it wud do all?” He pushed her away,--gently, but he was worn out; her rasping tone fretted him. “[MASK]!” The candle flared a pale yellow light over the cobwebbed brick walls, and the woman standing there.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Joe	The old man stopped a moment, listening uncertainly; then hurried on. The prisoner thrust his hand out of the window, and called again, louder; but [MASK] was too far down the street. It was a little thing; but it hurt him,--this disappointment.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Mitchell	Go!” [MASK] was leaning against a brick wall. He turned his head indolently, and looked into the mills. There hung about the place a thick, unclean odor. The slightest motion of his hand marked that he perceived it, and his insufferable disgust.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Kirby	“Twelve hundred hands?” said the stranger, the young man who had first spoken. “Do you control their votes, [MASK]?” “Control? No.” The young man smiled complacently. “But my father brought seven hundred votes to the polls for his candidate last November.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Deborah	[MASK] followed him into the inner room. She carried a candle, which she placed on the floor, closing the door after her. She had seen the look on his face, as he turned away: her own grew deadly.
<name>Uriah</name>	Uriah	Mitchell	After all our kindness that night! Picking [MASK]'s pocket at the very time!” His wife said something about the ingratitude of that kind of people, and then they began to talk of something else. Nineteen years! How easy that was to read!
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Kirby	This damp wind chills my very bones. Come and preach your Saint-Simonian doctrines' to-morrow to [MASK]'s hands. Let them have a clear idea of the rights of the soul, and I'll venture next week they'll strike for higher wages.
<name>Captain Nemo</name>	Captain Nemo	Kirby	“Here, some of you men!” said [MASK], “bring up those boards. We may as well sit down, gentlemen, until the rain is over. It cannot last much longer at this rate.” “Pig-metal,”--mumbled the reporter,--“um!
<name>Tom's</name>	Tom's	Wolfe	Along the wall of her cell there was a crack low down by the floor, through which she could see the light from [MASK]'s. She had discovered it days before. She hurried in now, and, kneeling down by it, listened, hoping to hear some sound.
<name>Cassie</name>	Cassie	Deb	They were going home from the cotton-mill. “Good-night, [MASK],” said one, a mulatto, steadying herself against the gas-post. She needed the post to steady her. So did more than one of them.
<name>Eppie</name>	Eppie	Hugh	He did not speak. “[MASK], did hur hear what the man said,--him with the clear voice? Did hur hear? Money, money,--that it wud do all?” He pushed her away,--gently, but he was worn out; her rasping tone fretted him.
<name>He</name>	He	Hugh	Nothing but the rasping of the tin on the bars. He was at his old amusement again. Something in the noise jarred on her ear, for she shivered as she heard it. [MASK] rasped away at the bars.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Gibson	Time of the trial, too, came the queerest dodge of any customer I ever had. Would choose no lawyer. Judge gave him one, of course. [MASK] it Was. He tried to prove the fellow crazy; but it wouldn't go.
<name>Dolly</name>	Dolly	Deb	“Inteet, [MASK], if hur'll come, hur'll hef fun,” said a shrill Welsh voice in the crowd. Two or three dirty hands were thrust out to catch the gown of the woman, who was groping for the latch of the door.
<name>Mrs. Bates</name>	Mrs. Bates	Deb	What did she say that for? Did he not know it? Yet he would not be impatient with poor old [MASK]. She had trouble of her own, as well as he. “No, never again,” he said, trying to be cheerful.
<name>Doctor</name>	Doctor	May	I have heard you call our American system a ladder which any man can scale. Do you doubt it? Or perhaps you want to banish all social ladders, and put us all on a flat table-land,--eh, [MASK]?” The Doctor looked vexed, puzzled.
<name>men</name>	men	Deborah	The mills for rolling iron are simply immense tent-like roofs, covering acres of ground, open on every side. Beneath these roofs [MASK] looked in on a city of fires, that burned hot and fiercely in the night.
<name>Magwitch</name>	Magwitch	Deb	poor [MASK]!” he said, soothingly. “It is here,” she said, suddenly, jerking into his hand a small roll. “I took it! I did it! Me, me!--not hur!
<name>John</name>	John	Kirby	I forget the motto: 'Our country's hope,' I think.” There was a laugh. The young man talking to [MASK] sat with an amused light in his cool gray eye, surveying critically the half-clothed figures of the puddlers, and the slow swing of their brawny muscles.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Wolfe	She don't go with him. Here she is in this next cell. I'm a-goin' now to let her in.” He let her in. [MASK] did not see her. She crept into a corner of the cell, and stood watching him.
<name>Benjamin</name>	Benjamin	Korl	“[MASK], Sir.” “Who did it?” “Can't say. Some of the hands; chipped it out in off-hours.” “Chipped to some purpose, I should say. What a flesh-tint the stuff has!
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Deborah	To-morrow! He threw down the tin, trembling, and covered his face with his hands. When he looked up again, the daylight was gone. [MASK], crouching near by on the other side of the wall, heard no noise.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Wolfe	Talked to him for an hour. Thought he came for curiosity, like. After he was gone, thought [MASK] was remarkable quiet, and went into his cell. Found him very low; bed all bloody. Doctor said he had been bleeding at the lungs.
<name>likely</name>	likely	Welsh,--had	The old man, like many of the puddlers and feeders of the mills, was [MASK] spent half of his life in the Cornish tin-mines. You may pick the Welsh emigrants, Cornish miners, out of the throng passing the windows, any day.
<name>Abe</name>	Abe	Joe	The step was far down the street; but he could see him place the ladder, run up, and light the gas. A longing seized him to be spoken to once more. “[MASK]!” he called, out of the grating.
<name>His</name>	His	Mitchell	He washed himself, and went out to find this man [MASK]. His right! Why did this chance word cling to him so obstinately? Do you hear the fierce devils whisper in his ear, as he went slowly down the darkening street?
<name>Kim</name>	Kim	Mitchell	Suddenly he stopped. “Go back, [MASK]! You say the pocket and the heart of the world speak without meaning to these people. What has its head to say? Taste, culture, refinement? Go!”
