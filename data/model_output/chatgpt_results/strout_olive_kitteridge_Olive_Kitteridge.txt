<name>he</name>	he	Christopher	“Tell him you’re here.” She walked away so they could have some privacy, but it wasn’t long before [MASK] came to find her. “Where have you been?” he asked, peevishly.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Olive	“Have you come here for lessons?” “No,” said [MASK]. “I came because you were nice enough to write me a note.” “I was always sorry my kids didn’t have you for a teacher.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Olive	A black woman, wearing a red airport vest, kept saying in the same plangent tone, “People, move around to the comer and against the wall. Move around to the comer and against the wall.” Twice [MASK] approached her. “Where do I go?”
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Nina	I know this shit,” she added. “So don’t try anything.” He held both palms toward her. “I am trying nothing.” He put his hands down. “Didn’t you get arrested?” [MASK] nodded.
<name>Willy</name>	Willy	Denise	His eyes, catching hers, softened. Back and forth this cycle went. For the first time in his life as a pharmacist, he allowed himself a sleeping tablet, slipping one each day into the pocket of his trousers. “All set, [MASK]?”
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Harmon	By February, as the slow opening of the world began once more—the air having a lightness of smell at times, the extra minutes of daylight as the sun lingered across a snow-covered field and made it violet in color—[MASK] was afraid.
<name>probably</name> (Note: There is no clear proper name in this sentence, so this is a guess based on the context.)	probably (Note: There is no clear proper name in this sentence, so this is a guess based on the context.)	Olive	One day he said, with sudden cheerfulness, “He’ll come back. You’ll see.” “And what makes you so sure?” “It’s his home, [MASK]. This coastline is his home.”
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Louise	“And mentally, I don’t believe, really, that I am one bit more out of my head than any other creature here on earth.” [MASK] sipped her tea. The veins on her hand were pronounced; one went right down her skinny finger.
<name>Adunni</name>	Adunni	Rebecca	“Not bad.” The only mirror [MASK]’s father had in their house was the one that hung over the bathroom sink. If she wasn’t brushing her teeth or washing her face, she wasn't supposed to be near that mirror; vanity was a sin.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Henry	The urge to put his arm around her small shoulders was very strong, but he sat holding his hands together in his lap. A small lamp shone from the kitchen table. She blew her nose on his white handkerchief, and said, “Oh, [MASK].
<name>someone</name>	someone	Henry	“Yes,” she said. He watched her as he ate the apple he always had for lunch, nothing else. “You would go home tonight and tell [MASK]?" “Yes,” she said. It was like planning a murder.
<name>her</name>	her	Olive	The boy looked at her. His eyes were pale blue, and his eyelashes were almost colorless. The whites of his eyes had spidery red veins. He kept staring at [MASK] without changing his hangdog expression. “Just please shut up,” he finally said.
<name>Lena</name>	Lena	Denise	The next morning he and [MASK] worked in an intimate silence. If she was up at the cash register and he was behind his counter, he could still feel the invisible presence of her against him, as though she had become Slippers, or he had—their inner selves brushing up against the other.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Daisy	Who didn’t fear that? But he knew her problems had roots that were long and tangled, and the safety of [MASK]’s cottage could not provide any lasting relief. She was very sick. “How old are you?” he asked. “Twenty-three.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Harmon	and he didn’t tell her. She found out from someone else.” [MASK] stopped sweeping. “But a fuck buddy—I mean, who cares. That’s the point of a fuck buddy.” The girl put her head against her boyfriend’s shoulder.
<name>she</name>	she	Rebecca	What kind of job are you looking for?” “Something low stress,” [MASK] said. “It’s not that I’m lazy or any- thing,’ she said, and then she said, “Well, maybe I am, maybe that’s true.”
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Harmon	It’s driving me nuts.” “Negativity'?” “I just wish you’d perk up.” She crumpled the doughnut bag closed. “And clean out those gutters. It isn’t pleasant, [MASK], having to feel like a nag.”
<name>Miss Brill</name>	Miss Brill	Olive	[MASK] turns her head toward the door. “Are you still there? I thought you’d gone away.” “There's a hair coming out of one of those things on your face,” the child says, bolder now, taking a step into the room.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Winnie	“Sex.” [MASK] nodded, but she didn’t know, exactly. The sun, bright in the kitchen, was giving her a headache. “She can’t stand that I had sex with him.”
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Jane	Don’t you remember that night she had a slumber party and ended up so crushed?” “There must have been a hundred slumber parties over the years, [MASK]. No, I don’t remember that one.”
<name>The driver</name>	The driver	Olive	“You’re supposed to stay on the right side of the line,” came a voice from behind her, a young woman on Rollerblades. Her voice was not angry, but it was not kind. [MASK] turned and walked back to her car.
<name>her sister's</name>	her sister's	Henry	Her own house, a few miles down the road, she and [MASK] also built, years ago, and just recently she fired the cleaning woman because of the way the foolish girl dragged the vacuum cleaner across the floor, banging it into walls and bumping it down the stairs.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Christopher	“[MASK],” she said. He had stepped into the kitchen, his hair wet, dressed for work. “I think I met your tenant in the park. I didn’t know he had a dog as well as a Christian parrot.”
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Janie	He said, “I’m mental, [MASK].” “Very mental,” she agreed. “You have the tickets?” He nodded. “Funny to have tickets in order to get into a church.”
<name>his wife</name>	his wife	Daisy	His brief Sunday moments with [MASK] were not untender, but it was more a shared interest, like bird-watching. He turned back to the magazine, an inner shudder to think if one of his sons had gone down in one of those planes.
<name>the man</name>	the man	Rebecca	“No,” the woman said. “I never do.” “Oh, I’m sorry,” [MASK] said. “Don’t be sorry,” said the woman. “It’s a pleasure. We’ll do this.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Olive	“Oh, I don’t need a doctor. I needed a bathroom. We had dinner with friends and I ate everything came my way. My husband’s waiting for me in the parking lot.” The nurse reached for [MASK]’s hand and looked at it.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Daisy	But last night the girl knocked again, another fight, and she didn’t have a place to stay. So now she was upstairs. [MASK] clasped her hands together on the table. “Boy, do I want a cigarette.”
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Winnie	“I have a headache.” [MASK] scooched down and took some potatoes from the bin in the bottom cupboard. “You need some food in your stomach,” her mother said. “Where’s your sister? You’d think she could have started the potatoes.”
<name>She</name>	She	Olive	[MASK] glanced at him quickly. He was crying. She looked away, and from the corner of her eye, she saw him reach into his pocket, heard him blow his nose, a real honk. “My wife died in December,” he said.
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Olive	“The expectations, you know.” [MASK] turns and gazes slowly around the room. Her son’s bedroom. She built it, and there are familiar things in here, too, like the bureau, and the rug she braided a long time ago.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Ann	Even [MASK] had had to leave the room. Do you have no memory of these things at all? These days, they'd send a social worker right to the home, if a kid showed up that way. Why are you torturing me? she had cried.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Henry	“I forgot.” [MASK] sits down heavily and opens it with his pen, finds his glasses, peers at it. Her note is longer than usual. She had a scare late in the summer. Pericardial effusion, which turned out to be nothing.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Simon	Stupid to play that—to play “We Shall Overcome.” [MASK] would think it was stupid, she realized that now. “You’re so schmaltzy,” he used to say. But he had said other things.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Molly	She almost always makes a point of going the other way, taking the old route down to the bay, but here she is, and now she prepares herself to turn her head away, feigning nonchalance. “Life insurance,” [MASK] is saying.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Olive	[MASK] straightened her back and looked at the little glass bottles of different things lined up on the counter, and the box of latex gloves. In the drawers of that metal cabinet, she bet there were all sorts of syringes ready for all sorts of problems.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	David	Maalox sticks to everything. You can’t put the spoon in the dishwasher because even the glasses come out flecked with white. They had a serving spoon [MASK] called the Maalox spoon, and it stayed right there by the corner of the sink.
<name>her</name> (There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to an unknown woman)	her (There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to an unknown woman)	Olive	Some tiny ping of recogni- tion, of knowledge, takes place in [MASK], but she could not tell you who this woman is—she knows only that she doesn’t like the looks of her, with her long, stringy hair that contains a lot of unflattering gray.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Olive	[MASK] pulled up at the stop sign, and then almost pulled out in front of a car passing by; even as she looked at the car, she almost pulled out in front of it. The driver shook his head at her as though she were crazy.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Eddie	She must have gone down to the shore from around the other side of the house, because there she is in her stockinged feet on the rocks, veering over the barnacled rocks, calling out to [MASK]. Whatever she’s saying, he doesn’t like.
<name>Draco</name>	Draco	Louise	You’re very thin. But you certainly do look beautiful.” [MASK] spoke carefully, but again with that playful tone. “Physically ill, I am not. Though I have little appetite for food, if that’s what you’re referring to.”
<name>arthritis</name>	arthritis	MS	“My mother’s had [MASK] for years, you know, so starting way back we all learned to help out. All three of my brothers are different. Don’t you think it’s funny when it happens that way?”
<name>she</name>	she	Olive	“Of course I wonder how he is. I wish you’d call me to tell me how he is.” Where and how, exactly, this rupture with her son had taken place, [MASK] couldn’t have said.
<name>her husband</name>	her husband	Henry	There were days—she could remember this—when [MASK] would hold her hand as they walked home, middle-aged people, in their prime. Had they known at these moments to be quietly joyful? Most likely not.
<name>she</name>	she	Olive	“Well, I’m sick and tired of it,” she’d said, calmly. “Sick to death.” A darkness had rumbled through him; his soul was suffocating in tar. The next morning, [MASK] spoke to him conversationally.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Rebecca	Even scraping with her fingernail, there was a layer of dried Maalox that wouldn’t come off the spoon. [MASK] put the spoon back onto the counter. “I thought I probably wouldn’t get the same person again,” she said. “Wow.
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	Henry	“Right beneath the vitamins in the second aisle,” she would tell a customer. “Here, I’ll show you.” Once, she told [MASK] she sometimes let a person wander around the store before asking if she could help them.
<name>John</name>	John	Harmon	The doctor stuck metal disks onto his bare chest, wires attached to each one. [MASK]’s heart showed no signs of trouble. As he sat in front of the doctor’s big wooden desk, he told the man he perhaps was going to leave his marriage.
<name>Janine</name>	Janine	Rebecca	Can 1 just ask how the subject came up? Wouldn’t it make more sense to be talking about teeth?” “We’d already talked about teeth by then.” [MASK] pressed on the facecloth. “I was telling him why I wanted the job.
<name>Rachel</name>	Rachel	Olive	“Muslim?” The girl’s plain, big face looked pleasantly at [MASK] while she bent to pick up the baby from the pool. “I’m not a Muslim.” Quizzically: “Wait, you're not a Muslim, are you?
<name>she</name>	she	Winnie	She used to collect them when she was little, watching the way their muscly foot would cling to the rock, and then close up tight when she touched it with her hand. But today [MASK] left them alone. The desire to collect them was gone, it was only habit that made her look.
<name>Dr. Patel</name>	Dr. Patel	Henry	She was quick with numbers, and remembered everything she was told by [MASK] about the pharmaceuticals he sold. She had majored in animal sciences at the university, and was conversant with molecular structures. Sometimes on her break she would sit on a crate in the back room with the Merck Manual on her lap.
<name>Janice</name>	Janice	Janie	He must not die right now. “Just tell me,” she said again, kindly. “She got breast cancer, [MASK]. She called me at the office that spring before I retired, and I hadn’t heard from her in years.
<name>Joey</name>	Joey	Lie	“I’m kind of surprised. I thought you would. What do they want, a Ph.D.?” [MASK] tore the end off a loaf of bread that was on the counter and stuck it into a jar of spaghetti sauce.
<name>her mother</name>	her mother	Julie	She put the starfish back onto the rock. They grew new legs if they lost them. “Doesn’t matter,” [MASK] had said. “Missing someone doesn’t stop.” Their grandfather had been a fisherman whose boat had gotten stuck on a ledge out at sea.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Henry	The snow had arrived, but on the roads that led down to the water, the fishermen’s trucks had flattened it. “That’s right. Slowly up on the clutch.’’ The car bucked like a wild horse, and [MASK] put his hand against the dashboard.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Christopher	She stepped on a plastic toy and almost broke her neck. “Where is everyone?” she asked. “[MASK], I’ve got to take off that shoe before I track dog mess all through the house.”
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Daisy	I’ve been putting off the first cigarette of the day, and I’ve got it pushed back now—three in the afternoon." “That’s great, [MASK].” He had seen that she’d not been smoking on Sunday mornings, but wasn’t going to mention it.
<name>Dad</name>	Dad	Christopher	She had thought [MASK] was going to grill hamburgers. But he had grilled tofu hot dogs, and for the grown-ups had, of all things, diced up a can of oysters and poked them into these so-called hot dogs. “Are you okay.
<name>Mr. Stevens</name>	Mr. Stevens	Chris	Often, he saw twenty people a day. “Good heavens, [MASK]. That seems a lot.” “I have a lot of bills to pay,” he said. “And soon I’ll have even more.” “I guess.
<name>dear</name>	dear	Janie	“I’m cold.” “Oh, please, [MASK].” He went upstairs and came back down with her favorite sweater, a yellow angora cardigan. She put the sweater on her lap. He sat down next to her on the couch.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Rebecca	Now—” “I always talk too much,” [MASK] explained to the woman. “My boyfriend tells me that. And now I’ve given myself this headache.” “It’s a pleasure doing business with a friendly person,” the woman said.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Harmon	“You’re both young,” [MASK] said. “You can wait. I can’t wait. But don’t rush. You just got married.” “It makes you feel old, though, doesn’t it? Once that ring is on the finger.”
<name>he</name>	he	Louise	“I hardly see that would solve anything,” she said. “Of course it would,” [MASK] said, pleasantly. “It would solve everything. But there’s the question of how to do it.”
<name>Maine</name>	Maine	Henry	[MASK] did not always warm up to summer people or retirees, those who came up the coast to live out their last days in a setting of slanting light. They were apt to have money, and, often, a grating sense of entitlement.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Suzanne	Tricky business, really. “Nice spot [MASK]’s getting here,” says one of the deep voices outside the window. Heard very clearly; they must have shifted their feet around now, facing the house. “Great spot,” says the other voice.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Flenry	That is why she took him to the doctor this past Christmas, leaving [MASK] at home, and sat in the waiting room while her heart pumped, until he emerged—this grown man, her son—with a lightened countenance and a prescription for pills.
<name>John</name>	John	Henry	She brought [MASK]’s shoes home from the hospital, put them in a bag in the garage, and they are still there. They were new, bought just a few days before the last time they pulled into the parking lot of Shop ’n Save.
<name>he</name>	he	Christopher	As she stood up, looking for her car keys—because she had to get out of here—she remembered, in a distant way, how as a much younger woman she had felt the dreariness of domestic life, yelling, while [MASK] ducked his head, “I hate being a goddamn slave!”
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Henry	What had they done? She could make the bed, do the laundry, feed the dog. But she could not be bothered with any more meals. “What’ll we have for supper?" [MASK] would ask, coming upstairs from the basement.
<name>Forsythia</name>	Forsythia	Forsythias	“Do you think that makes you a man? How absolutely pathetic.” Spring came. Daylight lengthened, melted the remaining snows so the roads were wet. [MASK] bloomed clouds of yellow into the chilly air, then rhododendrons screeched their red heads at the world.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Henry	Dozing in the bump-out room, she expected the phone to ring. In the morning, [MASK] was in his wheelchair, a polite smile on his face, his eyes unseeing. At four o’clock, she returned and spooned into his mouth his supper.
<name>Sylvia</name>	Sylvia	Olive	“All right, then,” [MASK] said. “Well, I’m off to the library. Goodbye.” She sat at the kitchen table, leaning forward, her hand on her big stomach. The thought that she could, anytime she needed to, kill herself went through her head.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Chris	“See, there’s an example,” [MASK] answered, calmly. Loading the dishwasher, calmly. “You say you want to leave, then accuse me of kicking you out. In the past, it would make me feel terrible, but I’m not going to feel terrible now.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Christopher	Calling out, “[MASK], are you sure you haven’t seen my shoe?” Looking through the laundry, her underwear drawer, some anxiety will flutter through her. “I must be losing my mind, I can’t keep track of anything. . . .
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Bonnie	“I take it you had to wait.” [MASK] was ripping long strips of dark green wool. A soft pile of these strips lay at her feet, the late morning sun making a pattern across the pine floor from the small-paned window she sat near.
<name>Louise</name>	Louise	Olive	He doesn’t know where he is, or who is with him.” [MASK] felt a shoot of fury stab through her. “How do you know that? It’s not true. He knows damn well I’m there.” “Oh, I don’t think so.
<name>Marcus</name>	Marcus	Bessie	He saw [MASK] turn, walk down toward the brooms. "Is that what your mother said?” “No one said anything. I was just wondering.” “Has your mother been complaining to you?”
<name>Lorelai</name>	Lorelai	Winnie	And let’s move on to shooting people. Most mothers don’t shoot their daughter’s boyfriends in the driveway.” “I know that,” [MASK] said. “I don’t have to go away to know that.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Christopher	What’s happening?” “It’s time for me to go home. I stink like fish.” [MASK] shook his head slowly. “I knew this was going to happen. I knew something would trigger things off.” “What are you talking about?”
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Olive	The side door of the garage opens directly to stairs, and [MASK] walks up them cautiously, stands on the landing; two sweatshirts are hanging on hooks, a pair of muddied yellow rubber boots stand side by side, toes facing in opposite directions.
<name>She</name>	She	Olive	“Don't leave me alone.” [MASK] stood, uncertain. It was a mile away, her car. She looked at him, lying there, his blue eyes watching hers. “What happened?” she asked. “I don’t know.”
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Olive	His voice was filled with disappointment, she supposed because of how he hated to have her swear. He backed the car up and stopped in front of the big, well-lighted blue door that said EMERGENCY. “Thank you,” said [MASK].
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Kevin	I don’t know as that’s true.” To get the conversation over with, [MASK] said, dully, “My father died last year of liver cancer. He never remarried. And I never saw much of him once I left.”
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Olive	But there’s the question of how to do it.” [MASK] shifted her weight, touched her handbag that was next to her. “Myself, of course, it would be pills and drink. You—I don’t see you as a pill person.
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Jack	“Trying again?” “All the tests came back,” said [MASK]. He shrugged. “Nothing wrong t I’d get back on the horse, as they say. Yes, I’m try- you coming or going?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Henry	They like to sit in the booth by the window, and there’s a waitress who knows them; she’ll say hi nicely, then leave them alone. “We can do that,” [MASK] says, at the door.
<name>Francie</name>	Francie	Rebecca	[MASK], standing at the window, felt a tiny smile inside her getting larger—how delicious it would be: that one moment of perfect joy, propped up and righteous with booze, to let that first punch fly.
<name>Mrs. Dubose</name>	Mrs. Dubose	Janie	Those parents were never home, going this place and that, some party here, some evening there, leaving other people to take care of their kids.” “[MASK], calm down.” “Please don’t tell me to calm down,” she said.
<name>the protagonist</name>	the protagonist	Kevin	At the very moment [MASK] became aware of liking the sound of her voice, he felt adrenaline pour through him, the familiar, awful intensity, the indefatigable system that wanted to endure. He squinted hard toward the ocean.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Olive	[MASK] knocks on the door, looking at the boots. She bends over and places one boot on the other side of its mate, so they look like they go together, could walk off together, and she knocks again.
<name>she</name>	she	Christopher	“Don’t you think that’s interesting?" “Not really.” Pain, like a pinecone unfolding, seemed to blossom beneath her breastbone. “I don’t even know how she found out. Shut up in that house all day.” “Dunno,” [MASK] said.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Olive	She pushed the door open. “Hello?” “Hello, [MASK]. I’m back here. I’m lying down, I’ll be right there.” “No,” she sang out, “stay put. I’ll come find you.”
<name>Mr. Antolini</name>	Mr. Antolini	Harmon	“God, I love young people,” [MASK] said. “They get griped about enough. People like to think the younger generation’s job is to steer the world to hell. But it’s never true, is it?
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Rebecca	“Maybe it’s because I talked about the barium enema I had,” [MASK] said, with a shrug. She turned the heat down so the spaghetti wouldn’t boil over. “I talked a lot,” she admitted. “I probably talked too much.”
<name>he</name>	he	Henry	She waited now, until [MASK] woke up, so he wouldn’t wonder where she was. When she tried to wash him, get him dressed with the help of the aide, he was groggy and heavy and kept falling back asleep.
<name>person</name>	person	Henry	He was not sure which [MASK] she meant. She looked up at him, her small eyes almost swollen shut; she had taken her glasses off to press the handkerchief to them. “I talk to you in my head all the time,” she said.
<name>Blanche</name>	Blanche	Olive	“What’s the matter?” [MASK] said to her. “Haven’t you ever seen an old lady cry before?” She didn’t like to be alone. Even more, she didn’t like being with people.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Jace	There was no voice of her father’s in her head, no thoughts of men behaving like dogs. All of it was easy as pie. One night in the bathtub, [MASK] told her about a blond woman he’d met.
<name>He</name>	He	Chris	He’d give me this smile, and I’d smile back, and it was sort of understood that he had nothing against me, but if he knew which subway was going to blow, he’d smile and watch me walk to get on it.” [MASK] shrugged.
