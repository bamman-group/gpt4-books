<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Lem	“You’re a pretty observant man, [MASK], which ought to’ve taken you far in the line of work you were in. I just don't understand how, with all your talents, you managed to screw up the Banodyne case so thoroughly.”
<name>her opponents</name>	her opponents	Travis	Now, back at the Scrabble board, she felt buoyant, happier than she would have once believed possible—and mischievous. She started using her tiles to spell nonsense words and then vociferously defended them when [MASK] questioned their legitimacy. “ ‘Dofnup’?”
<name>He</name>	He	Travis	Her sudden sense of release from bondage had generated powerful emotions, but now they subsided somewhat to make room for curiosity. “All right?” [MASK] asked. She nodded, then stared hard at him and said, “You knew, didn’t you?
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Cliff	If I go in alone, I’ll be able to get him to talk to me, and maybe I can persuade him to just give it up.” That was a flimsy explanation for his unorthodox procedure, and it did not wipe the frown off [MASK]’s face.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Einstein	“Thanks to you,” she said. “Maybe thanks to [MASK] more than me.” “No. You most of all," she said, and abruptly she was stricken by that old shyness that had once all but paralyzed her.
<name>him</name>	him	Einstein	She thought she had gotten a grip on herself. She thought she was ready to be strong. But now she was crying. She went to [MASK], sat on the floor beside him, and put one hand on his shoulder, just to let him know that she was there.
<name>Stradlater</name>	Stradlater	Einstein	[MASK] sat before him, unmoving, never yawning, as if intently interested in his tale. “I was a loner as a kid, right from the start, though I wasn’t entirely without friends. It was just that I always preferred my own company.
<name>He</name>	He	Streck	She sensed that he could be easily angered, that the pent-up violence in him could be triggered with minor effort. So she answered him with another lie, one she hoped would make him reluctant to harass her any further: “He’s a . . . policeman.” [MASK] raised his eyebrows.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name in the given context)	unknown (There is no proper name in the given context)	Vince	Her wide blue eyes were fixated on the dead men, but now her gaze shifted slowly to [MASK]. Before she could scream, he emptied the rest of the magazine into her, maybe ten shots, and she went down in a rain of blood. Ssssnap.
<name>Don</name>	Don	Vince	“If you say they will,” [MASK] said, rising and bowing with only his head and shoulders, “I know that it is true.” The don motioned him to sit down. “But before you attend to this private affair, I’d like you to take another contract.
<name>her</name>	her	Nora	As they went, one of the topless dancers—a striking blonde—put a hand on [MASK]’s shoulder and walked beside her. “Are you new, honey?” “Me? No. Oh, no, I don’t work here.”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Tommy	“That’s private property up there. You have any right up there?” “It’s where we live,” [MASK], the driver, responded. “Is that so?” “Don’t we look like a bunch of spoiled rich kids?”
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Tommy	“Hey, man,” [MASK] said. “Why’re you hassling us? Are you a cop or what?” “Yeah, in fact, I am.” “Where’s your uniform?” one of the boys asked. “Undercover.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Travis	As [MASK] quietly stepped through the rubble, he was stricken by a feeling that the intruder had gone out the back of the house and was coming around the side, heading for the front door, risking being seen by neighbors in the gloom of twilight, intending to enter behind them, swift and fast.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Vince	[MASK] was glad for the weird green lighting because it covered the fact that he had gone ghost-pale. The idea of messing around with that infected slut, that diseased whore, that rotting and festering round-heeled pump, was enough to make him sick.
<name>Retriever</name>	Retriever	Travis	Filthy as it was, the animal was nonetheless appealing. [MASK] stooped, patted its head, and scratched behind its ears. He half-expected an owner, gasping and perhaps angry at this runaway, to follow the retriever out of the brush. Nobody came.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Streck	“What do you want?” she asked shakily. “I figure it’s a computer error,” [MASK] said, laughing quietly. “Yeah, sure, some sort of computer error dropped your husband from their records.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Walt	“Then what do you think it was?” “Damned if I know,” [MASK] said, rubbing the back of his bristly head with one big hand. “But judging from the body, the killer had sharp teeth, maybe claws, and a nasty disposition.
<name>Jennifer</name>	Jennifer	Yarbeck	“So [MASK] created a breed of baboons that would grow to greater size. Then she set to work altering the sperm and ova of her giant primates in other ways, sometimes by editing the baboon’s own genetic material, sometimes by introducing genes from other species.”
<name>the boy</name>	the boy	Travis	The dog went around the red Formica table to the twin cabinet doors below the sink. It opened one of these, stuck its head into the dark space, and pulled out the bag of Milk-Bone biscuits, which it brought straight to [MASK].
<name>the nurse</name>	the nurse	Selbok	Suddenly, he was afraid that the girl was in far worse condition than he had been told, and he voiced his concern to [MASK]. “No, no. She’s in pretty good shape,” the doctor said.
<name>her</name>	her	Einstein	Oh God, how he had loved her. To [MASK], he said, “We didn’t know it then, but she had cancer on our wedding day. Ten months later, she was dead.” The dog put its head down in his lap again.
<name>Agent Smith</name>	Agent Smith	Travis	“I wanted to talk to you because I want to know who’s spreading these falsehoods about me.” [MASK] said, “We need some ID—driver’s licenses, social security cards, the whole works. First-rate, with full backup, not junk.”
<name>John</name>	John	Einstein	[MASK] began to pace. Five minutes later, the retriever was the first to hear the car turning into the foot of the driveway at the main road. He dashed down the porch steps, which were at the side of the house, and stood at the edge of the dirt lane.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Lem	The mouth of the cave was about eight feet wide but low, requiring [MASK] to stoop a bit as he entered. Once inside, he was able to stand erect, for the ceiling was high. The place had a mildly unpleasant, musty smell.
<name>Dr. Franklin</name>	Dr. Franklin	Travis	“Maybe he’s already had them," [MASK] said hopefully. “We don’t dare count on that. He was a lab animal in a controlled environment where he might not have needed shots. And maybe the usual inoculations would’ve interfered with their experiments.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Travis	Then he realized the retriever was not concerned about anything in that direction but was standing sideways on the trail, facing the underbrush in the forest to the east of them. Spraying saliva, it barked stridently, so hard and loud that each explosive sound hurt [MASK]’s ears.
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Vince	[MASK] must have heard or sensed something because he swung toward her, but he was too late. She jammed the .38 into his belly and, before he could raise his gun and blow her head off, she squeezed the trigger three times.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Nora	It had been dreary in all other details as well. Nevertheless, when finished with her chores, or when dismissed after one of her aunt’s interminable lectures, [MASK] had fled to her bedroom, where she escaped into books or vivid daydreams.
<name>Reed</name>	Reed	Violet	She had lived there since she was only two years old, which now added up to twenty-eight years, and during all but one of them, she had been under the iron thumb of her Aunt [MASK]. Hers had not been a happy childhood or, to date, a happy life.
<name>John</name>	John	Travis	[MASK] sipped some beer and waited tensely to see what would happen next. With a shake of its head and a snort of frustration, the dog went to the far end of the room and stood facing into the corner, its head hung low.
<name>John</name>	John	Travis	He came to the table, sniffing at both of them, rubbing against their legs, and whining happily. [MASK] said, “Next week?” “Married? But it takes time to get a license and everything.”
<name>his</name>	his	Streck	Damning herself for being unable to order the bastard out of her house, she slipped past him and went to the oven, ostensibly to check that it was finished preheating, but she was really just trying to get out of [MASK]’s reach. He followed her, staying close.
<name>the thief</name>	the thief	Bockner	Perhaps breaking into a stable or barn or empty house, it had stolen the bucket and various other things that [MASK] now revealed with his flashlight. A plaid flannel blanket for when the weather turned cooler. A horse blanket, judging by the look of it.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Della	When he pulled into [MASK]’s driveway, she came out of the house, locked the front door, and hurried to his car. She was dressed in boat shoes, white slacks, a blue- and white-striped sweater, and a blue windbreaker.
<name>his wife</name>	his wife	Nora	Holding the Mossberg, he listened for the noise, and in a minute or so it came again; in the second-floor hallway. He eased out of bed without waking [MASK] and went cautiously to the doorway.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Nora	Reaching [MASK], he took her by the arm and propelled her toward the front door, out onto the stoop and down the stairs, looking left and right, half-expecting to see the living nightmare rushing at them, but it was nowhere in sight.
<name>Moreau</name>	Moreau	Weatherby	“Grotesque physical mutation that had to be destroyed. Stillborn pups. Pups that looked normal but were less intelligent than usual. [MASK] was doing cross-species engineering, after all, so you can figure that some pretty horrible possibilities were realized. ”
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Streck	Brighter and more feminine dresses would only call attention to her bony, graceless body and to the characterless and uncomely lines of her face. But why had [MASK] said that she was pretty? Oh, well, that was easily explained. He was making fun of her, perhaps.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Travis	“Maybe,” [MASK] said. “But maybe not. He’s just been acting peculiar all day, ever since you left this morning. He told me it smelled like a bad day.” “He was right,” she said.
<name>she</name>	she	Nora	She wasn’t sure how much of the oppressive sound was made by the impacting rain and how much of it was the roar of her own blood in her ears. Block by block, [MASK] searched for a cop—although she had on idea what she should do if she saw one.
<name>him</name>	him	Garrison	“You want to call [MASK] and thank him?” he asked. “Yes, absolutely!” she said, “but first, let’s unpack them all and make sure none of them is damaged.”
<name>Chicken Soup</name>	Chicken Soup	Travis	You’re going to have to sleep as much as you can, give your body a chance to knit up, and don't spend half the night at the windows, worrying." CHICKEN SOUP. Laughing, [MASK] said, “Might as well try that, too.”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Streck	The large mirror was somewhat streaked with age. She looked at her hair, which [MASK] said was beautiful, dark, glossy. But it was of one shade, without natural highlights; to her, it wasn’t glossy but oily, although she had washed it that morning.
<name>my</name>	my	Travis	Because of the ripe stink, [MASK] first thought the man must have been killed at least a week ago. But on closer inspection, the corpse proved to be neither bloated with the gas of decomposition nor marked by any signs of decay, so it could not have been there for very long.
<name>Sylar</name>	Sylar	Vince	[MASK] was not sure if he would survive the explosion. He had absorbed the life energies of so many people recently that he thought he must be getting close to the immortality he had been seeking—or was already there—but he could not know how strong he was until he put himself to the test.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Nora	He asked [MASK], and she came to the pantry door, but she had no explanation for the phrase, either. Pawing out more letters, pushing them around with his nose, the retriever asked: why say sound as a dollar?
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Nora	“Kiss you all over, [MASK]. Wouldn’t that be nice?” The cramps were getting worse. She was shaking uncontrollably, too. Her voice cracked repeatedly as she employed her final threat: “I have a gun. I have a gun.”
<name>he</name>	he	Travis	He went inside to the bathroom, then changed into an older pair of jeans and a T-shirt for the sloppy job ahead. When [MASK] came outside again, the retriever was standing beside the steaming washtub, the hose in its teeth.
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Travis	[MASK] remembered the lettered tiles on the pantry floor: fiddle broke . . . AFRAID . . . AFRAID. “Don’t be afraid,” he pleaded with the dog. “Don’t be afraid. There’s no reason to be afraid.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Einstein	“What now?” [MASK] put one paw on the door. “You want to go out?” The dog whined, but the sound was muffled by the directory in his mouth. “What’re you going to do with the phone book out there?
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Tracy	Or it would have carried the cat away for leisurely consumption elsewhere. Yet this cat had not looked even half-eaten, merely torn to pieces, as if something or someone had killed it merely for the sick pleasure of rending it apart . . . [MASK] shuddered.
<name>He</name>	He	Travis	“Move along, boy.” The retriever bared its teeth and growled low in its throat. When he tried to step past it, the retriever snarled. It snapped at his legs. [MASK] danced back two steps. “Hey, what’s gotten into you?”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Lem	“Yes.” “And if I fought you, if I tried to hang on to jurisdiction in this case, would there be anything I could do to lessen that danger, to insure the public safety?” “No. Nothing,” [MASK] said truthfully.
<name>he</name>	he	Einstein	Instead of answering her, he repeated the question that [MASK] had not yet answered: “Are you claiming to have seen such a thing?" Yes. “Something that looks exactly like this demon?” A bark and a wag: Yes and no.
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Lem	Standing on the dock, [MASK] stared at the sun-spangled sea, which slapped rhythmically against the pilings. The motion nauseated him. He looked up at the soaring, cawing seagulls. Instead of being calmed by their graceful flight, he grew edgy.
<name>Dr. Mortimer</name>	Dr. Mortimer	Lem	Body has more than a score of nasty bite marks, even more claw marks, slashes. Throat, as you saw, torn open. Eyes—” “Yes,” [MASK] said, seeing no need to dwell on these grisly details.
<name>Louise</name>	Louise	Tracy	As she lost consciousness, [MASK] heard herself say, with a seriousness that both amused and frightened her, “Well ... I think maybe it was the boogey-man who used to live in the closet at the other house. I think maybe ...
<name>him</name>	him	Travis	The tail started wagging again. “Well . . . even if it was her, it’s not wise to get involved. ” The retriever rushed at him, seized the right leg of his jeans, and shook the denim furiously, nearly tugging [MASK] off balance.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Travis	What was coming? The shrill cries of the cicadas cut off simultaneously, as if a phonograph needle was lifted from a recording. The woods were preternaturally silent. Then [MASK] heard something rushing up the lightless trail. A scrabbling noise. A clatter of dislodged stones.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Travis	The moment [MASK] was down, the dog turned away from him. It padded across the clearing to the brink of the sloping path and peered into the gloom below. Its floppy ears had pricked up as much as a retriever's ears can.
<name>food</name>	food	Streck	The morning walk and the glass of brandy had given her an appetite that even thoughts of [MASK] could not spoil. She didn’t feel like cooking, so she prepared a platter of fresh fruit and some cheese, plus a croissant heated in the oven.
<name>Pablo</name>	Pablo	Tetragna	It was hard to believe that this rotund specimen could have built an infamous criminal operation. True, [MASK] had been young once, but even then he would have been short, and he had the look of a man who’d been fat all his life.
<name>Grendel</name>	Grendel	Travis	Fixing [MASK] with its lantern eyes, it again said, “Kill dog, kill dog, kill dog,” but this time it seemed wracked with grief, as if it grasped the magnitude of the crime that it had been genetically compelled to commit.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Walt	“Three-quarter pension.” [MASK] breathed deeply of the fragrant smoke rising off the charring steaks. “Still. What is our country coming to? In less liberal times, screwups like you would have been flogged and put in the stocks, at least.”
<name>the man's</name>	the man's	Travis	“You must know that I won’t. I mean, you have good instincts about things like that, don’t you? Rely on your instincts, boy, and trust me.” The dog returned from the far end of the patio and stopped just beyond [MASK]’s reach.
<name>Dr. Grant</name>	Dr. Grant	Lem	Why does it always tear out the eyes?” [MASK] said, “Partly because the creature’s just damned aggressive, bloodthirsty. That’s in its genes. And partly because it really enjoys spreading terror, I think. But also . . .”
<name>Ethan</name>	Ethan	Travis	The dog stopped licking him, stopped wagging its matted tail. It regarded him solemnly, and he was suddenly transfixed by the animal’s gentle, warm brown eyes. Something in them was unusual, compelling. [MASK] was half-mesmerized, and the dog seemed equally captivated.
<name>The dog</name>	The dog	Einstein	He was also bleeding from his left calf, but that wound appeared to be a dog bite. [MASK] was guarding him, staying back out of range of a kick, but ready to tear at the runner if the guy was foolish enough to attempt to leave the corner.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Tracy	An instant later, her assailant slammed into the other side of the door, trying to knock it open, but the frame prevented that. The door would only move outward, and [MASK] hoped the amber-eyed creature was not smart enough to figure out how the door worked.
<name>he</name>	he	George	That’s true. I’m convinced she was a borderline paranoid even in her youth. And then, when she discovered that [MASK] had betrayed her with other women, the switch clicked all the way over in her. She got much worse after that.”
<name>he</name>	he	Travis	“It’s all right,” she said. With her head bowed and shoulders hunched, sitting there under a ton-weight of shyness, she looked so vulnerable that [MASK] could not just get up, walk away, and leave her with her problems.
<name>Carl</name>	Carl	Jim	“At first, very weak,” [MASK] said. "But gradually he’ll get most if not all of his old strength back. I’m sure now that he never went into second-stage distemper, in spite of the convulsions.
<name>Chet</name>	Chet	Travis	Every time you see something that’ll help us put the puzzle together, you’ve got somehow to bring it to our attention. Bark at it or put a paw on it or wag your tail. ” “This is nuts,” [MASK] said.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	One	From the notch between the trunks, he had a view of the phones and of the walkway leading out to the curb where the car had parked. Two men got out of the sedan. [MASK] sprinted north along the park perimeter, looking inward, searching for something.
<name>Benji</name>	Benji	Weatherby	“Thinks like a human being?” “Not like a human being, but maybe as well as." “Yet it looks like an ordinary dog?” “That was what the Pentagon wanted. Which made [MASK]’s job a lot harder, I guess.
<name>my father</name>	my father	Francine	“The white one used to belong to [MASK], my wife,” the attorney said as he led them to the car. “I don’t use it much any more, but I keep it in working order, and I drive it often enough to prevent the tires from disintegrating.
<name>Helen Keller</name>	Helen Keller	Yarbeck	When [MASK] worked with it, constructing a sign language with which to communicate complex ideas, The Outsider several times expressed a desire to kill and mutilate the dog, but it would never explain why. It was obsessed with the dog.”
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Nora	Couldn’t be done without . . . love.” Her voice had dropped to a whisper, and she was unable to lift it. “Love is like the water and the sun that make the seed grow.” He said, “[MASK], look at me.”
<name>She</name>	She	Eve	“[MASK] never seen a woman at the three-month mark in better shape," the doctor said. “I want this to be a very healthy baby, a perfect baby.” “And so it shall be.”
<name>him</name>	him	Lem	Then he frowned at [MASK]. “Cross-species? What do you mean?” “Well, you see, he was isolating those genetic determinants of intelligence in species that were brighter than the retriever—” “Like apes?
<name>he</name>	he	Travis	He raised his eyebrows quizzically. “Where on earth did you get the idea that I’m in that sort of business? I’m afraid you’ve been misinformed. ” “We need first-rate paper with full backup,” [MASK] repeated.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Travis	[MASK] waited. The house was unnaturally quiet, as if the flow of time had been suspended for every living creature, machine, and object on earth—though not for him, the retriever, or the contents of the kitchen.
<name>Enzo</name>	Enzo	Travis	Unable to move at all, the dog was of necessity incontinent. A couple of times he peed on the plastic-covered mattress. With no distaste whatsoever, with the same tenderness and compassion a father might show in caring for a gravely ill child, [MASK] cleaned up.
<name>Chris</name>	Chris	Travis	On the treeless spine of a ridge, where the low grass that had grown during the short rainy season had already turned dry and brown, [MASK] sat upon a broad table of rock and took off his backpack. A five-foot rattlesnake was sunning on another flat rock fifty feet away.
<name>John</name>	John	Travis	“And their puppies after them, on and on, until in time you’d have a colony of intelligent golden retrievers, thousands of them all over the world.” They were silent again. Finally she said, “Wow.” [MASK] said, “He’s right.”
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Nora	“Even if they do eventually connect me with you two, they won’t know I’ve given you one of my cars.” “We can’t accept something this expensive,” [MASK] said. “Call it a loan,” the attorney told her.
<name>Baxter</name>	Baxter	Einstein	[MASK] blinked at her, then looked at the letters, blinked at her again, sniffed the letters, and she was getting a sick feeling in her stomach when, suddenly, he began to choose tiles and push them around with his nose.
<name>Baxter</name>	Baxter	Einstein	The scrabble-tile dispenser was gone. In its place, an IBM computer stood on the floor. [MASK] took a stylus in his mouth and tapped the keyboard. The message appeared on the screen: THEY GROW UP FAST. “Yes, they do.”
<name>She</name>	She	Nora	More than anything, he desired domination. Perversely, her timid withdrawal would encourage him. [MASK] had no experience at confrontation, but she saw that she was going to have to learn to stand up for herself—and fast. She lifted the receiver on the thirty-first ring.
<name>Uncle Vernon</name>	Uncle Vernon	Lem	I’m about as nice as they come, though [MASK] here is a real stinker—everybody says so—but you don’t have to worry because I’ll keep him in line and make him be nice to you. Okay?”
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Travis	Getting to his feet, [MASK] said, “What is it, boy? What’s got your tail in an uproar?” The retriever jumped onto its hind feet, put his forepaws on one of the shelves, and sniffed the spines of the books.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Einstein	He was only two or three steps from the archway. He squinted into the gloomy dining room. [MASK]’s barking resounded through the house until it seemed as if a whole pack of dogs must be loose in the place.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Travis	you taught me that I’m your guardian, too, that I’m [MASK]’s guardian, and that he is my guardian and yours. We have a responsibility to stand watch over one another, we are watchers, all of us, watchers, guarding against the darkness.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Della	They’re very good, very subtle, but they’re not invisible.” He gave her time, and after a few blocks [MASK] said, “The green Ford, is it?” “That’s them." “What’ve you gotten yourself into, dear?”
<name>she</name>	she	Nora	Starting next year, [MASK] thought, there’ll be a baby in the house to share Christmas, and won’t that be a hoot! Aside from suffering a little mild morning sickness and having put on a couple of pounds, she’d not yet shown any signs of pregnancy.
<name>it</name>	it	Travis	yet there was also an indescribable quality that bespoke intelligence, a tone and modulation almost like the sound that an enraged man might make. The more he listened, the more [MASK] decided it was neither strictly an animal nor human sound. But if neither . . .
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Lem	It would be a real test of their friendship. Suddenly, staring at the body bag, [MASK] realized something was wrong with the shape of the corpse. He said, “The head isn’t here. " “You feds don’t miss a trick, do you?”
<name>Debbie</name>	Debbie	Nora	On her hands and knees in a doglike position, [MASK] was only two or three feet from the retriever, virtually face-to-face with him. “All right. This is getting us nowhere. We’ve got to do more than just have you associate one picture with another.
<name>Officer</name>	Officer	Nora	The mother and father were wary of the dog at first but quickly realized he was harmless. “How old’s your little girl?” [MASK] asked. “Ten months,” the mother said. “What’s her name?”
