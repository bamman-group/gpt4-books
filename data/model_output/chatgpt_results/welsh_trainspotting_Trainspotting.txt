<name>him</name>	him	Venters	The point soon came when there was no time left to try and illicit heartfelt apologies from him. At one stage 1 thought that I wanted repentance from [MASK] more than revenge for myself. If I got it, I would have died with a belief in the fundamental goodness of the human spirit.
<name>John</name>	John	Tom	[MASK]’s healthy, pink cheeks flushed. He couldn’t help it. Years of intensive interpersonal skills practice had taught him to hide the nervy visual and verbal giveaways. No shifty eye contact or quavering voice from him in the face of embarrassment.
<name>Jimmy</name>	Jimmy	Renton	She watches their faces, distorted into a red, gaping, gloating commonality. The joke is on the woman again, she thinks, the silly wee lassie behind the bar. [MASK] looks at her and sees her pain and anger. It cuts him up.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Begbie	As they laughed, [MASK] justified his actions. — Wir fuckin doon thair fir the fuckin racin, no tae talk tae some fuckin doss cunt oan the fuckin radio. His expression was that of a man-of-affairs, bored with being hassled by the media for interviews.
<name>Janice</name>	Janice	Hazel	[MASK] understands ego needs. She’s a windae dresser in a department store, but describes hersel as a ‘consumer display artist’ or something like that. Why should ah reject the world, see masel as better than it? Because ah do, that’s why.
<name>Mrs. McPherson</name>	Mrs. McPherson	Choatah	[MASK]! C’mere you bleedin little . . . She picks the cat up and holds it protectively to her bosom like a baby, staring at us bitterly as if ah somehow intended tae herm the bag ay shite. Ah fuckin hate cats, nearly as much as ah hate dugs.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Dode	likesay . . . fuck . . . this is, this is . . . [MASK]’s been chibbed. Ah gits um ower the road. Ah kin hear people shoutin behind us. Ah jist focus oan Na Na’s door, no darin tae look back.
<name>Des</name>	Des	Sharon	aw this, oblivious tae everything except the procurement ay smack. — Fuckin trash. Ye deserve eveything ye fuckin git hingin a boot wi that scum. He goes back in n sits doon, bit only because he sees [MASK] n June comin doon the road.
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Rents	It’s one ay these days when ma hormones are shooting aroond ma body like a steelie in a pinball machine, and all these mental lights and sounds are flashing in ma heid. And what is [MASK] proposing, on this beautiful afternoon of vintage cruisin weather?
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Tommy	n maybe [MASK]. Why am ah giein the cunt such a bad press? Is it solely because ay his neglect ay parental duties, or indeed his lack of acknowledgement ay parental status? it’s more likely because I envy the cunt. He doesnae care.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Les	Ah knew, even fae here, thit he’d be focusing oan the big mole oan her neck. — It’s ma fault . . . it’s ma fault, she cries through her hands. — Eh, [MASK] . . .
<name>McGonagall</name>	McGonagall	Tommy	— It’s nane ay your fuckin business! You keep oot ay this! The boy points at [MASK]. — That’s enough thair. Come on now! The barman shouts. The corkscrew-heided cunt smiles and a couple ay the darts boys look ower.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Johnny	Ah hud some root oan us the other day thair whin the nurse came roond tae dae the dressin. An auld boot n aw, n thair’s me sittin wi a bairn’s airm wi an aypil oan the end ay it. — Once ye git yirsel mobile [MASK], ah venture encourag-ingly.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Silver	— Ah make mair hireys daein this thin ah do oan the punt. Now if yill excuse us [MASK], ah’ve goat a 'fuckin livin tae earn here. An upright soldier like masel cannae be seen talkin tae junkies. See ye aroond.
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Granty	They had turned away from the issue of [MASK]’s death, onto the subject of the outstanding cash. — The Friday before divvy day n the cunt fuckin snuffs it. One thousand n eight hundred he wis haudin.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Peasbo	[MASK] quizzed. — Twenty-seven, twenty-nine . . . who gies a fuck? Jist a young boy. It’s his burd n that wee bairn thit ah feel sorry fir. . . ye git some ay they auld cunts . . .
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Gilbert	Straight away, [MASK] clocks the Scottish guys as small-time wasters who have stumbled on a big deal. He is impressed however, by the quality of their gear. He offers them £15,000, prepared to go as high as £17,000.
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	Nina	One pair were made of the same material as the black lace gloves [MASK] had. She removed the gloves to feel the pants. Although she liked these ones, she picked a pink flowery pair, then went back into the bathroom to put them on.
<name>students</name>	students	fanny	Ah wis sniffin aroond in the gairdins the other day. Schoolies everywhere. Ye light up a joint and thir like flies aroond a crap. The manto’s hoachin. Thir’s foreign [MASK] aw ower the place, some ay them gaggin oan it.
<name>Begbie</name>	Begbie	Rab	Whit’s every cunt fuckin wantin? Ah git up tae the bar. [MASK], the Second Prize, as we caw the cunt, he’s goat a fuckin stoatir ay an eye. Some fuckin liberty-taker’s been oan the cunt’s case.
<name>no name</name> (There is no proper name in the passage)	no name (There is no proper name in the passage)	Goat	Ah wis bevvied. The cunt looks at us, aw fuckin sheepish like. — [MASK] names? — Naw, but dinnae worry, ahTl git the cunts man, it’s aw sorted oot. — Be sure ye fuckin dae.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Si	— What’s wrong [MASK]? What’s the fuckin score? He moves towards us. Ah thought he wis gaunnae kick us. We’re best mates but we’ve hit each other before, in drink or rage when one ay us has wound the other up.
<name>him</name>	him	Renton	There was a nervous silence at this moronic comment. Embarrassed, he added: — That’s what they say anyway. He then took the opportunity to change the subject. — How are ye going tae get into the flat? Such people really scared the fuck out off [MASK].
<name>Mark Renton</name>	Mark Renton	Renton	— Cocaine . . . fuckin garbage. Yuppie shite. Although he has been clean for a few weeks, [MASK] has the smack-head’s contempt for all other drugs. — My ladies are returning. Ah’U have to leave you gentlemen to your sordid little activities.
<name>Angus</name>	Angus	Tommy	[MASK] cannae put hissel in a bubble, live in the warm, eat good fresh food, keep his mind stimulated wi new challenges. He willnae live five, or ten, or fifteen years before he’s crushed by pneumonia or cancer.
<name>Nicola</name>	Nicola	Mark	Ah’m sitting here wi her in this cafe, tryin tae make sense ay the rubbish that she’s talkin. She’s bad-mouthing [MASK], which is fair enough, but it’s startup tae get oan ma wick.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Renton	With half an hour left, they are positively desirable. [MASK]’s wandering eyes now keep stopping at this slim girl with straight, longish brown hair, slightly turned up at the edges. She has a good tan and delicate features tastefully picked out by makeup.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Dawn	We start slaggin each other, then wir walkin fir a bit, bit ah start thinkin ay wee [MASK], the baim, n that squirrel, like free n botherin naebody . . . n they wid jist kill it, like that ken, n fir what?
<name>Trainspotting</name>	Trainspotting	Lesley	Less than useless in this condition. Of negative utility. [MASK]’s nivir moved. Ah feel thit ah should mibbe go and comfort her, pit my airm aroond her. But ma bones feel twisted and scraped. Ah couldnae touch anybody right now. Instead ah babble.
<name>Moira</name>	Moira	Gail	Was she genuinely upset or playing at being upset? Difficult to tell. Then: — What happened to the covers? Genuinely upset. — Eh, a wee accident [MASK]. — Well, never mind that. Come downstairs. We’re just about to have breakfast.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Venters	He said that I’d have to work through my anger, and he was right. I took the quick route though, by sending [MASK] to oblivion. Now all I get is a bit of guilt, but I can handle that.
<name>Louise</name>	Louise	Kelly	Although her tone’s no really judgemental, she talks as if ah hud something tae dae wi [MASK]’s pregnancy n its subsequent termination. — How should ah go n see her? It’s goat nowt tae dae wi me, ah sais defensively.
<name>Jimmy</name>	Jimmy	Rents	The gadge once told us in a pub that scaffoldin wis classed as a trade now, likes. [MASK], whae wis a chippy at the time, told the boy that that wis a loaday shite, that it wis semiskilled, n the boy took the cream puff,
<name>Begbie</name>	Begbie	Begbie	Ah jist hate meat. It makes us puke. Endy story. — Well, ah still fuckin say yir fuckin spoilin it fir ivray cunt else. — How? — Cause ah fuckin sais, that’s fuckin how! [MASK] hisses, pointing to himself. i
<name>Trainspotting</name>	Trainspotting	Mibbe	Ah cannae help smirkin in his face. He comes in looking completely bewildered as we fall aboot laughing at him, stoned oota oor boxes. [MASK] it’s the dope, but he just looks so strange; men just look so strange, these funny, flat bodies and weird heads.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Rents	One cunt in the seat in hunt’s lookin roond again. — You goat a fuckin problem mate? ah shouts ower. The cunt gits a beamer n turns roond. Shitein cunt. [MASK] faws asleep. The rid-heided cunt’s pished oot ay his fuckin skull.
<name>Stuart</name>	Stuart	Ah’ll	— [MASK] fuckin tell ye. Threatened her wi a fuckin blade. Tied her doon. Fucked her fanny, fucked her arse, made her go doon oan him. The lassie wis terrified, as well as being hurt. Does this sound familiar then cunt?
<name>therapy</name>	therapy	Forbes	willin tae explore it; ah don’t feel defensive aboot any ay it. However, ah feel that it’s at best peripheral tae the issue ay ma addiction. Certainly, talking about it extensively has done fuck all good. Ah think [MASK] is as scoobied as ah am.
<name>DJ</name>	DJ	Iggy	It is pure fucking freezing here, I kid you not my man, and we move towards the light and into the ballroom. We head straight for the bar. We have more drinks at the bar, although we can hear that [MASK]’s started his set.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mark	just shakes his heid n laughs. — Ah’ve obviously called at an inconvenient time. Ah’ll gie ye a bell the mom, he sais tae me. — Aw . . . perr [MASK] . . . wir just havin a woman’s crack . . .
<name>Trainspotting</name>	Trainspotting	Ali	That is too fundamentally mad. We all just blethered for ages about everything in sight, and even [MASK] didnae seem so screwed up a boot things. Eftir a bit we decided tae go back tae ma place for a smoke ay hash and some more tea.
<name>David</name>	David	Bowie	The speed kick is running down a little. He worries that his hair looks daft, dyed black, as his orange freckles, the curse of the red-headed bastard, are prominent. He used to think that he looked like the Ziggy Stardust era [MASK].
<name>Rents</name>	Rents	Matty	— Dinnae you play Mister-fuckin-innocent, [MASK] turns oan me. — Eh? ’Moan tae fuck! Whit you oan aboot? ah respond, genuinely fuckin perplexed at the bastard’s outburst. — You wir thair Rents.
<name>Fie</name> (Note: The passage does not provide a clear indication of another proper name to fill in the [MASK] token.)	Fie (Note: The passage does not provide a clear indication of another proper name to fill in the [MASK] token.)	Mark	Fie takes it well though, poor [MASK], ah’ll say that for him. just shakes his heid n laughs. — Ah’ve obviously called at an inconvenient time. Ah’ll gie ye a bell the mom, he sais tae me. — Aw . . .
<name>Trainspotting</name>	Trainspotting	Swanney	A filthy, black overcoat hangs loosely on his grey, emaciated flesh. — Blootered oaf aw ma methy script, he states, neither looking for sympathy nor expecting it. Then a slight glint comes into his dead eyes. — Hey [MASK], dae ye make any poppy oot ay that?
<name>Trainspotting</name>	Trainspotting	Mark	Her thin, white face is like a skull wrapped in milky clingfilm; her eyes are rid raw, circled wi black rings. — Ye cookin? Ah need a shot [MASK]. Ah really need a fuckin shot.
<name>He</name>	He	Renton	Ah’ve been tae too many funerals fir a gadge ma age, likesay. Wonder whae’s next? [MASK] shrugged. — At least we’ll be prepared, whaeivir the fuck it is. If they gave oot qualifications in bereavement, ah’d be a fuckin Ph.D. by now.
<name>Trainspotting</name>	Trainspotting	Johnny	Ah wis only aware ay him slouching tae a halt oan the banister in front ay us. because he wis blocking ma route tae [MASK]’s and the skag. He wis struggling fir breath, haudin grimly oantay the railing, looking as if he wis gaunnae spew intae the stairwell.
<name>Trainspotting</name>	Trainspotting	Tommy	— Ye ken thit [MASK]’s fuckin sick? — Aye. Ah’d heard. — Go n fuckin see the cunt whin yir up. — Aye. Ah plan tae dae that. —Too fuckin right. You ay aw fuckin people should.
<name>Seeks</name>	Seeks	Tommy	Ah came fir a pint, bit ah might jist git pished yit. [MASK]’s breathin heavily n lookin tense as ah sit doon. — Fuckin tellin ye Seeks ... he sais through grinding teeth. The lassie's eye is badly swollen and shuttin.
<name>Spud</name>	Spud	Rents	[MASK] hud better watch what he’s daein, likesay. That Begbie, man, it’s likesay . . . that’s a fuckin jungle cat. We’re just ordinary funky feline types. Domestic cats, likesay. — They cunts’ve goat the fuckin poppy.
<name>McGonagall</name>	McGonagall	Tommy	He frees it wi a quick shake. — You want yir mooth punched? the boy sais. — Think ah’m gaunny jist sit here n lit ye dae it? Fuckin wide-o! Ootside then cunt. Cu-mauugghhnn! [MASK] sort ay sings tauntingly.
<name>Trainspotting</name> (Note: This passage contains offensive language and may not be suitable for all audiences.)	Trainspotting (Note: This passage contains offensive language and may not be suitable for all audiences.)	Spud	he’d been lucking on and oaf for a few months. The cunt wanted tae pimp her oot. Ah felt sickened at what he’d come tae, what we’d aw come tae, and started tae envy [MASK] again. Ah pull um aside.
<name>the nurse</name>	the nurse	Gail	She wore the same cool expression on her face. In her case she had good reason, as I recognised it as one of professional concern. In [MASK]’s case, such detachment was, I feel, inappropriate. This nurse looked at me in that strained, serious and patronising way.
<name>Rab</name>	Rab	Spud	— [MASK]: deek the fat radge. Gluttonous bastard. Ah dinnaego hr aw that shite aboct it bein a glandular or metabolic thing. Ye dinnae see any fat bastards on tv footage h Ethiopia. Dae they no huv glands ower thair? Stroll on.
<name>Trainspotting</name>	Trainspotting	Ah’m	[MASK] doon thair, stickin a fuckin bar-towel oan the draftpak’s split heid, tryin tae stem the blood. The cunt just growls at us, n ah dinnae ken whether that’s um showin gratitude or ready tae stomp ma baws, but ah cairry oan.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Shane	The skinhead is singing ma praises tae the polis n the ambulanceman. He’s upset at [MASK], he still cannae understand what turned this loving pet whae ‘wouldnae hurt a fly’, the cunt actually said that, mouthed that hideous cliche, intae a deranged monster.
<name>Jimmy</name>	Jimmy	Cathy	wir jist sayin 'if now [MASK] ... he was fixing your car which had gone in for a service, oh, I see . . . hopefully he hud mair sense . . .firstgame’s called 'Shoot To Kill’ . . .
<name>Begbie</name>	Begbie	FRANCO	— [MASK]! C’MOAN! ah shout, grabbin his airm. He stoaps tae examine his work, but brushes ma grip oaf. He turns tae look at us, and fir a minute, ah think he’s gaunnae panel us.
<name>Begbie</name>	Begbie	Dia	The thought made him feel a bit strange. While he could sense people in the flat, he couldn’t pick up that distinctive smell of pish, puke and powder that babies have. He went to speak. — [MASK] . . . — Ssh!
<name>them</name>	them	Bebgie	Ah hate cunts like that. Cunts like [MASK]. Cunts that are intae baseball-batting every fucker that’s different; pakis, poofs, n what huv ye. Fuckin failures in a country ay failures. It’s nae good blamin it oan the English fir colonising us.
<name>He</name>	He	Albo	Psycho-methy cocktail: his ticket to better times, that wee private heaven the uninitiated pour scorn on, but they could never conceive of its bliss. [MASK] has a stack of cyclozine, prescribed for his cancer.
<name>McGonagall</name>	McGonagall	Jocky	[MASK] spat out his syllables Kalashnikov style. The auld girl tries tae look coy, her expression makin us feel a bit queasy inside. Ah jist hide behind a pint ay lager and fir once in ma puff am gled tae observe the total silence that the club bingo game imposes.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Dianne	They looked to him as if they hadn’t done anything illegal in their lives. No wonder [MASK] was like the way she was, picking up strange guys in bars. This couple looked so obscenely wholesome to him.
<name>Marcellus</name>	Marcellus	Begbie	Nonetheless, he feels paranoid and self-conscious with the bag full of money. Every person looks like a potential mugger or bag-snatcher to him. Whenever he sees a black leather jacket similar to [MASK]’s, his blood turns to ice.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Ali	[MASK], crazy fuckin cow that she is, turns oan the guy. — Have you goat a girlfriend? Ah doubt it, because yir a fat, ugly prick. Why no just go intae the toilet wi a dirty book and have sex wi the only person crazy enough tae touch ye — yirsel.
<name>me</name>	me	Haze	he rasps loudly. Appropriateness hus nivir been the cunt’s strong point. — Awright doll? he sais tae [MASK]. — Lookin fuckin smert. See this cunt here? He points at me. — Style, he sais, enigmatically. Then he elaborates.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Renton	Ye need meat. A fuckin junky fuckin worryin a boot what he pits in his boady! That’s a fuckin laugh! — Jist -dinnae like meat, [MASK] says, feelin silly as they all snigger. — Dinnae fuckin tell us ye hate killin fuckin animals.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Dode	It’s no that easy whin they start singing: ‘Aint no black in the union jack’. We stay cool, but this cat won’t be denied. His claws are oot. He shouts ower at [MASK]. — Oi! Wot you fucking looking at nigger!
<name>He</name>	He	Johnny	— Back oan the mooch, he says to himself, as he studies his face in the mirror. [MASK] looked clean. It was not a nice feeling and the process had caused him a great deal of discomfort; but people expect standards from an old soldier.
<name>Naomi</name>	Naomi	Dode	Na Na up the kite. Then it was back tae the seven seas. Sounds a good life likes, a sailor’s, likesay a burd in every port n that. [MASK]’s Na Na’s youngest baim.
<name>He</name>	He	Mike	That pained, incomprehensible expression ay hers makes us want tae pish ma keks wi laughter. [MASK] wears a very hurt I-crack-the-jokes-here look, but it’s tinged wi resignation through the realisation that his power over me has gone.
<name>Begbie</name>	Begbie	Frank	He conies ower, n sais tae us: — Eh [MASK], ah’m a wee bit short, ken . . . Ah ken how, awright. — Mibbe ye’ll fuckin grow, ah sais. The cunt takes the hint, n hits the bar.
<name>her</name>	her	Lynne	where have ah been ... ah tried tae phone ye yesterday. Where are ye? What are ye daein? He almost said who are you with, but he restrained himself. — I was at [MASK]’s, she told him. Of course. Her sister’s.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Spud	Turning to his partner he says: — Man, ah’ve goat a fuckin bad rock in ma erse. Ah’ve goat tae spend a bit ay time in the bog. [MASK] shoots to life for a second. — Yir no haudin, ur ye? —
<name>Over</name>	Over	Ower	[MASK] the next few days, the pain abated slightly. Ah even started tae dae some cooking. Every cunt under the sun thinks thit thir Ma’s the best cook in the world. Ah thought so tae, until ah went tae live oan ma ain.
<name>William</name>	William	Johnny	[MASK]’s good at waiting; even British Rail on a bad day couldn’t fuck up his junky karma. However, withdrawal gives advance notice of its cruel intentions with an icy bum which causes his pulse to kick up a gear and his pores to excrete a rich, toxic sweat.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Franco	Ah’ve goat thirty-two pence in ma poakit and a pound in ma account at the Abbey National. No really the kind ay investment portfolio tae cause the Charlotte Square dudes sleepless nights, likesay. [MASK] slips us two tenners. Nice one, the Beggar-boy.
<name>Someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Venters	My opportunity came, in the event, at exactly the right time; in the end it was probably fifty-fifty luck and planning. [MASK] was struggling, no more than a wrinkled parcel of skin and bone. The doctor had said: any day now.
<name>the protagonist</name>	the protagonist	Renton	— Whae’s asleep? he whispered nervously. — Ssh! This was disconcerting for [MASK]. His mind raced through past horrors experienced first hand and from the accounts of others. He mentally flipped through a grim database which contained everything from vegan flatmates to psychotic pimps.
<name>McGonagall</name>	McGonagall	Stevie	Blood? Obviously. [MASK] survived some unimaginative taunting on the way up to the station. Surely, he thought, they could do better than ‘Hibby bastard’ or ‘fenian cunt’. One hero tried to trip him from behind, egged on by baying friends.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Begbie	The boy’s mates assume battle stances, n one ay them charges ower tae this other table n panels this innocent cunt. Another gubs some perr gadge cairryin a tray ay drinks. [MASK]’s oan his feet, n racing doon the stair.
<name>Trainspotting</name>	Trainspotting	Ali	Ah laugh oot loud at what she said. — Which woman’s crack are we havin? ah sais. We’re all fallin about laughing wildly. [MASK] n me maybe should’ve been bom men, wi see sex in everything. Especially when wir stoned.
<name>Trainspotting</name>	Trainspotting	Spud	[MASK]’s muddled brain turns to sex. Everyone seemed to bag off at the party, everyone except him. He really fancies a ride. His problem is that he is too shy when straight or sober, and too incoherent when stoned or drunk, to make an impression on women.
<name>Barry</name>	Barry	Dougie	Her mum wouldn’t even let her smoke in the living-room. She let [MASK], her moronic man-friend smoke in the living-room. That was alright, considered to be the subject-matter of light humour rather than the cause of cancer and heart disease.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Forrester	— It’ll take time, [MASK] gruffly observes, as ah swan back intae the living-room. — You’re tellin me. For aw the good they’ve done ah might as well huv stuck thum up ma erse.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Mitch	Mind you, ah step up a gear when ah sees the blood flowing fae ma nose onto my bare chest, and ower the table. Ah get [MASK]’s hair in a grip and ah’m trying tae smash his heid against the wall, but ma hands are so numb and heavy.
<name>Chanel</name>	Chanel	Carol	Ah ran intae um in the Shrub an hour or so ago. He wis quite bewied. He sais: Geez some ay that perfume, ah’m away doon tae [MASK]’s. Ah’ve treated her like shite, it’s time tae spoil ur a bit.
<name>He</name>	He	Renton	Those who are not oblivious to him, can feel the vibes he is giving out. They employ that special talent people have: pretending nutters are invisible. Even his companions won’t meet his gaze. [MASK] has pulled his green baseball cap down over his eyes.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Stevie	I love you . . . — I love you! 1 LOVE YOU! The pips went and the line died. [MASK] held the receiver tenderly, like it was something else, some part of her. Then he put it down and went and had that pee.
<name>John's</name>	John's	Andy	This was about reducing tension, solidarity in face of the grim reaper. [MASK]’s death had put that topic further up the list of items on the personal agenda of every one of them. The kettle clicked off.
<name>Mac</name>	Mac	Scot	Des-erves-it. [MASK]-lind’s-maist-kin-sist-tint-strik-ir. We continue our ritualistic argument, me trying tae find even a semblance ay passion which would breathe life intae it, and failing miserably.
<name>Declan</name>	Declan	Renton	[MASK] made half-hearted attempts to help tidy up, before the father ushered him onto the couch and the mother busied herself in the kitchen. His heart sank, expecting the ah’m-wide-fir-your-game-cunt line when they were alone.
<name>Trainspotting</name> (Note: This is a tricky one, as the [MASK] token could refer to any character in the novel "Trainspotting." However, since the prompt asks for a proper name, we can assume that the answer should be a specific character's name. Therefore, we can make an educated guess that the answer is the title of the novel itself, which is a proper name.)	Trainspotting (Note: This is a tricky one, as the [MASK] token could refer to any character in the novel "Trainspotting." However, since the prompt asks for a proper name, we can assume that the answer should be a specific character's name. Therefore, we can make an educated guess that the answer is the title of the novel itself, which is a proper name.)	Gav	Ah couldnae help it, it wis jist nerves. — Ah want ma fuckin heid looked at, [MASK] concedes, but he cannae force a smile. Ah suppose, whin all’s said n done, thir isnae a fuckin loat tae smile aboot.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Spud	He turns and puts his cheek on the glass, then licks at it with his tongue. Then he stands back and adjusts his features into a forced mask of misery. [MASK]’s eyes would be on him as soon as he opened the door.
<name>Trainspotting</name>	Trainspotting	Jakey	Fuckin bams. Dinnae git us wrong like; ah thoat the cunt wis fuckin sound. But ah mind, thir wis one time some boys asks the cunt whair he fuckin came fae. This boy goes: —[MASK]!
<name>Big Rab</name>	Big Rab	Granty	— Nae cunt wid try tae mug [MASK]. He’s the kind ay cunt thit mugs cunts, no gits mugged fae thum. If he comes in here pullin a stunt like that, ah’ll tell um whair tae fuckin go.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Renton	[MASK] thinks the girl has taste, because she cold-shoulders the fat guy. He likes the way she does it. Assertively and with dignity, not making a real arse out of him, but letting him know in no uncertain terms that she isn’t interested.
<name>Spud</name>	Spud	Rents	This speed is el magnifico, likesay. Ah feel sortay dynamic, ken, likesay, ah’m really lookin forward tae this interview. [MASK] sais: Sell yirsell Spud, n tell the truth. Let’s go for it cats, let’s get it on . . .
<name>he</name>	he	Venters	It was as if someone who had done a vile and odious fart had somehow sucked it back up their arsehole. He came back though, as he always did, sporting that sneering, gloating expression. It was as if [MASK] believed that he alone was immortal.
