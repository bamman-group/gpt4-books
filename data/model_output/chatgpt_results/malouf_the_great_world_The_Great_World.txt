<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Digger	‘You watch [MASK] now,’ her mother had told her, ‘there’s a good girl. I’m depending on you.’ She had believed always that the time might come when she would have to do it again.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Digger	So there they were, all three, united again. Back, [MASK] thought, despite the seven years and all that had happened, in a life that was barely different in its essentials from the one he had left.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Vic	The point on which it turned was that moment in the half-dark of the piano room, during what was to be the last of their games. Everything had been quite clear to her at that moment, and to [MASK] too.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Vic	[MASK] remembered the lie. One day early on, sitting in the sun in just their shorts, they had played a game of draughts. They were seated on either side of an upturned drum, he couldn’t remember where, but the heat was intense and the sunlight blinding.
<name>person</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	person (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Vic	Something in the news put a real damper on her. Something she had been looking forward to she knew now she would never have. She glanced up. And that [MASK] had the oddest look on his face, like there was suddenly nothing to him.
<name>Professor</name>	Professor	Dja	‘If they keep feedin’ us this muck, and we keep eatin’ it, our eyes’ll go slanty. [MASK] know that? This professor toP me. It’s what the bastards want! T make fucken coolies of us. They hate white men.’
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Vic	Twelve years later, when [MASK] turned up, the image of the man had come back to her and she saw what he might grow up to be. It was a type that appealed to her. She could admit that now.
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Digger	For [MASK] it was a moment that for as long as he lived would remain apart and absolute, its real seconds swelling till he felt as if his body had been suspended over a gap where the sun was stopped and chronology had ceased to operate.
<name>General Lee</name>	General Lee	Doug	He got a flash of him as he had appeared, hovering about behind [MASK], in those last days before the surrender, and experienced again, and with a force he wouldn’t have thought possible, as if time had no meaning at all, the immediate aversion he had felt.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Vic	6 It surprised [MASK], as the years went by, that, leaping right over what had been the grimmest period of his life, he so often found himself back in the year before his mother died and the time afterwards when he had lived with his father.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Digger	He would drive up to where the track turned down sharp towards the store, park it there under the firs, then walk. Sometimes, after they had had a bit of a talk, he and [MASK] would go back to the car and look it over.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Vic	‘Well,’ she said, ‘I’m glad we’ve met at last. I was wondering what you’d be like.’ ‘Me?’ ‘[MASK]’s talked a lot about you - well, not a lot, but - well, you know.’
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Ellie	Later, when his pain lessened, as it did in time, and he saw things more reasonably, what was the point? He could have stayed the night with one of the boys, he would have been welcome enough. He could have gone up for [MASK]’s sake.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Vic	He had seen at the wedding the sort of people [MASK] came from and the life they led, and had been too absorbed with the vehicles themselves, with raising the bonnet and looking in at the workings of them, to ask himself how much they might represent in the way of ‘getting on’.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Doug	When it did start, in [MASK]’s case, they pretended not to notice, not to see, either, the terror he was in, because he had discovered it even sooner of course, felt the little worry of it growing, beginning to swell.
<name>nightingales</name>	nightingales	Frogs	But when he gathered his senses together he was aware of sharp-edged little stones under him, and there was a great climbing edifice of sound as well, though what the creatures were who were making it he could not guess. [MASK]? Night crickets?
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Greg	He could not see what the rules were in this place where begging, he had thought, was unknown. The Japanese were grinning. They were amused. One of them dropped a five-dollar note into the cap, and [MASK] raised a finger to his temple in scornful salute.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Vic	With her heart beating she pushed the grass aside and a man rolled over and looked right up at her. It was [MASK]. She was in real panic now. Was he poisoned? Had she done it? But she’d given that scone to the magpies.
<name>Kino</name>	Kino	Digger	He was so unremarkable, [MASK], looked so like all the rest of them, barefoot, filthy, in a lap-lap, all bones, that no one could have guessed what he carried along with the pick over his shoulder or the basket with its weight of rubble and stones.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Digger	[MASK] was the one he was after, but she was the one he tried to get around. She knew that and kept an eye on him. She wasn’t that much of a dill. And each time the car he came in was different too.
<name>mothers</name>	mothers	Digger	‘These are just the sort of things,’ he thought, ‘that mothers must say. Looking just like that, too. Half-horrified, half-impressed.’ This side of [MASK] was a source of amusement to him.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Vic	He wasn’t at all obsequious. He was speaking as one man to another, taking for granted an equality between them, given a few million dollars, that [MASK] was glad to accept. He was speaking too as a father, and that also moved him.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Digger	Turn your back on your family and you drained the blood from your heart. She painted a fierce picture, and [MASK] at least was terrified of her. It was a religion she was preaching, her own, and she was its implacable embodiment. One more thing.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Vic	There was a police station not fifty yards away. It was amazing. [MASK] did not once look up. What he could not face, but could see clearly enough, was the look on the boy’s face. The boy — but he was past thirty.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Mac	Many of them were still straggling in, and on all sides the company sergeants were at work, shouting roll calls of their men. Twelve days ago [MASK] had been wounded, not too badly, in the thigh.
<name>he</name>	he	Digger	But what [MASK] saw was that he was overheated, and he could not judge, since he had never seen him till now under circumstances like these, whether it was normal or not, whether it was or was not to be expected as a by-product of what kept him cool.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Iris	So was the colour of the ink, which differed from letter to letter, even from page to page of the same letter, so that you could see, or guess, where [MASK] had put the pen down in mid-sentence to go off and do something.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Vic	When he got home he would be in a shouting mood. Then suddenly he would break down and weep. Every stage of this daily drama disgusted [MASK] and confirmed him in the view that this vicious crybaby who claimed to be his father had nothing to do with him.
<name>Kilgore</name>	Kilgore	Vic	[MASK] humped his sack with the rest. It was an animal’s work though a man could do it, and the dust was a torment, but none of that worried him. Neither did the weight, the two hundred pounds laid on his neck, which he had to trot a hundred yards with.
<name>Stanley</name>	Stanley	Digger	All [MASK] had done was turn his head a little to see who it was. ‘They’re all bloody thieves in this camp,’ the boy told him passionately. ‘1 lost a fucken good fountain-pen. Some bastard swiped it straight outa me pack!’
<name>he</name>	he	Douggy	He did not want her to see now how shaken up he was. When [MASK] raised his eyebrows and cast a look around the room where they were to leave their things that said, ‘Well now, what do you make of this?’
<name>the dark</name>	the dark	Meggsie	He would hang there in the doorway, his hair a bird’s nest, his stance very like his father’s, whom he imitated in everything. He was a timid little fellow, and [MASK] scared him. He wouldn’t come in.
<name>He</name>	He	Digger	The whole unit could be called up and paraded in his head, the dead right there with the living, all clean and in good shape again, whether they had drawn a short straw or a long and wherever they were. [MASK] remembered them, and their names and numbers.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Digger	‘This,’ [MASK] said to no one in particular, to the part of himself that stood apart a little and observed from a distance still, ‘is what happened to us in the world. Maybe it wasn’t meant to.
<name>his wife</name>	his wife	Ellie	In low voices, in bed, he and [MASK] argued over it. ‘Don’t be silly,’ she told him. ‘You’re making too much of it. Children grow out of things.’ He tried to talk to the boy man to man.
<name>Unknown</name>	Unknown	Ellie	She must have made a sound of some kind, just a breath. He turned his head sharply and his face was covered again. He leaned towards her in the dark. ‘Who is it?’ he said, his voice very low. ‘[MASK]?
<name>John</name>	John	Greg	So they fell back each time on what they had said before. [MASK] shouted his contempt for their whole way of life, all the things they stood for, which he rejected utterly and would have nothing to do with.
<name>George</name>	George	Digger	He was the same age as [MASK] but looked younger because he took care of himself. He was always very well turned out. He sat now with his shoes, which were new and well polished, set down very carefully in the dirt.
<name>Amir</name>	Amir	Digger	But things changed, and after a time he spoke of the boy only with bitterness. In these last years he had barely mentioned him. [MASK], hearing of this latest, this last business, did not know what to say.
<name>Eeyore</name>	Eeyore	Mac	All it does is make ya mournful. Now, I ask you, what’s the use a’ that?' ‘I’m not mournful,’ [MASK] would insist. ‘A’ course you are. You’re about the mournfullest bloke I ever laid eyes on.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Digger	Their natures, though wildly out of order in other ways, were matched in this. They were made for one another. [MASK] was struck by the irony of it, but they were in a place now where ironies were commonplace.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Vic	What scared her was that she did not know what it was, or how, when it came, she would meet it. [MASK] knew and could have told her, but what would she have learned from that?
<name>the sky</name>	the sky	Digger	Sitting out in the dry wind, under the pepper tree, on the upturned tin, what he was worth was not millions but just what [MASK] might see and reflect back to him, with no need of explanation or proof.
<name>he</name>	he	Vic	You found your limbs and hobbled away as fast as breath would take you. You fled. 12 ‘Listen mate,’ [MASK] whispered. What was he doing here? ‘I heard about something. One of the other blokes tried it and it worked on him.
<name>Mrs. Pearce</name>	Mrs. Pearce	Jenny	‘I wouldn’ worry about [MASK].’ But he did. Today, as she bashed the crockery about - ‘There, that’s yours, mister!’ - she kept fixing her eye on him. She had something on her mind.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Digger	He was fussing about at the gas ring. He turned and faced [MASK]. ‘The club was raided,’ he explained. ‘Wednesday night. Stroke a’ luck, really - f’you. Being crook when it occurred.’ He seemed pleased with himself.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Curran	When boys at school, or outside the pictures, taunted him, he found himself standing up for her. This was just what they wanted. ‘Gettin’ a root now, are ya [MASK]?’ the older boys jeered. He reddened and went for them.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Digger	And [MASK] was scared by that, too. By common agreement they fell into the habit of talking as little as possible of all this, and then only in the lightest terms. ‘Agh,’ he said now, hauling his tackle in, ‘this is a mug’s game.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Vic	Maybe you could pick it up just by seeing it in someone, someone you were too close to; or just by realising it could exist. ‘Thought I’d try the big smoke again,’ [MASK] was telling him. ‘Give it another shot.’
<name>Quirinus</name>	Quirinus	Vic	When he spoke it was with all the facts at his fingertips and the approval, always, of a board with whom he had gone over every detail. He could not understand [MASK]. Or rather, he did understand but could not deal with him.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Vic	Was that deliberate? She was moved by this but warned herself that she could not trust him. They stood very close, with the child between them, who was crowing and working his fingers in the air. ‘How old is he?’ [MASK] asked.
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Vic	It was to assure himself of the impossibility of there being any link between them that [MASK] tormented his spirit into hardness and punished his skin with the scrubbing brush. Easy-going - that was the word for him.
<name>probably</name>	probably	Vic	That lack of ease he had felt in him hadn’t had to do only with the uncomfortable nature of the occasion. It was part of the man. He wasn’t intimidating at all, [MASK] decided, not at all. 1 needn’t have worried.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Meggsie	‘[MASK] he began. ‘Go on,’ she told him, ‘you’re wasting time.’ He dipped again. ‘Yes, that’s it,’ she said with a sigh. ‘Good boy! You were always a good boy really. ’
<name>Connor</name>	Connor	Jimmy	It was a secret between them - [MASK], his father and himself. The bottles came in loose straw jackets and they went out and burned them quickly in a corner of the yard so that his mother wouldn’t find them, a real blaze.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Ellie	‘You’re doing just what he wants. All this carrying on! It’s to make us see what a sensitive soul he is and how careful we ought to be with him, that’s all. And to make himself the centre of things.’ [MASK] looked up again.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Doug	‘Well, would you?’ [MASK] laughed. ‘Are you barmy? Of course I wouldn’t. But I’m a bloody footslogger, I can’t just piss off home. Haven’t got a bloody rowboat for one thing.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Mac	But as time went on the image stayed clear, if anything, grew sharper. So in the end it was what he might never have seen at all that meant most to him. He also had the pile of letters [MASK] had left him.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucille	Once or twice earlier, while they were rushing about seeking places to hide, he had collided with [MASK], but he was shy of her now. He set off to check the pozzies where one or other of them was sure to be squeezed in holding their breath.
<name>He</name>	He	Digger	She looked at him. ‘Because he was lonely,’ she said after a moment. ‘He had nowhere to go.’ [MASK] stared. ‘Maybe,’ she said lightly, ‘he fell out with his girlfriend.’ She said it carelessly.
<name>he</name>	he	Ellie	He stood where the light fell. There wasn’t much, but [MASK] was accustomed now to the dark. He was looking straight to where she was but did not see her. The curtain rose and fell like a veil, brushing her face.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Digger	‘I don’t know him,’ [MASK] found himself saying, and he was sorry the moment after. It was true, it was what he felt at the moment, but it seemed like a betrayal. He saw from her look how surprised she was.
<name>Christopher</name>	Christopher	Digger	[MASK] knew by now, was a way of protecting himself, and you too sometimes, from the pain of things. ‘I never understood what she wanted, really. I reckoned I did, like most blokes, on’y I never had a clue really.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Digger	‘We might as well ’ave let the bastards have it,’ he said, ‘if you want my opinion.’ He laughed, tipped his head back, opened his throat and poured down the rest of his beer. ‘He’s been on the booze,’ [MASK] thought.
<name>Almost</name>	Almost	Tramps	He liked it because the only people who came here now were tired-looking women shoppers, and a few muddy-eyed older men who wanted a place where they would not be intimidated by too much style. [MASK] half of them looked, or very nearly.
<name>Primo</name>	Primo	Mac	But what was happening now made slanty eyes the mildest of changes. Their bodies had gone berserk and were dragging them back to a time before they had organised themselves into human form and come in from chaos. There were occasions now when he thought [MASK] might have drawn the best bet after all.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Digger	It was a man’s world you was in. It was other men you had to rely on. Stretcher-bearers, if you were lucky, otherwise just yer mates. That’s the truth, [MASK]. That’s what yer mother won’t tell yer.’
<name>he</name>	he	Vic	The more she argued with him, the more unreasonable [MASK] grew, and at last she gave up. She had begun to fear the things that were said between them. So long as they were unspoken they had no force.
<name>George</name>	George	Alexander	‘[MASK],’ she told him. ‘So you see,’ she wanted to add, ‘we’re no longer the youngest ones -not any more.’ She thought this might reconcile him a little, make him see things, as she did, in the longer view.
<name>her</name>	her	Digger	Well, good riddance!’ She didn’t care. The main thing was, she’d got the bad luck off [MASK] and herself. She would have liked to keep a watch on that bird and make sure, only she didn’t have the time.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Ellie	As little things they had fought like tigers. [MASK] recalled occasions when they had struggled and torn at one another, red-faced and sweaty in their singlets and pants, both tearful with rage, pulling at one another’s hair and spitting.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Doug	‘So,’ he said, ‘here we are, eh?’ [MASK] looked about, and the sigh he gave was theatrical. ‘I dunno,’ he said. ‘How did 1 get inta this? 1 was always such a careful bloke.
<name>he</name>	he	Digger	It meant something, that. But back here, at the edge of normality, these were matters that could not be alluded to. ‘He’s ashamed of all that,’ [MASK] thought. ‘It’s something he doesn’t want to know about.’
<name>him</name>	him	Em	It raised too many ghosts, put a finger on wounds that were still raw in him. But it was no good saying any of this to [MASK]. He was a tactless fellow with fixed and emphatic views, and besides, was bitter now at the snub he had received.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Digger	‘Now,’ the voice said, and half-supporting, half-dragging him where he hung under the stars (what was supporting them}), led him forward. It was a river. [MASK] saw the gleaming surface of it, coal-black and churning.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Digger	Steals the food out’v a man’s mouth, an’ the next minute he’s trying to make up to him by playin’ nurse. Typical!’ But the dampness was so good, so cooling, and the hands so gentle, that [MASK] closed his eyes again and drifted.
<name>Miss Emily</name>	Miss Emily	Digger	She had put a match to them, whether or not the flame had taken. [MASK] could do nothing with her. He had faced this sort of thing before but had not expected to see it again in his lifetime, and not here.
<name>He</name>	He	Vic	She couldn’t listen to what they were saying or believe any bit of it. The News! She would go glum and start counting in her head - one, two, three, four - till they took him off. [MASK] had always played things close to his chest.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Digger	‘Shuddup in there, get ta sleep,’ their father would shout through the wall, ‘or I’ll bloody come in an’ make yer.’ Then, after a moment, their mother’s voice: ‘Go t’ sleep now, [MASK], you can tell that t’morrow.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Digger	The father wasn’t blind. ‘You mustn’ let yer mother put you off, [MASK]. I mean, women don’t know everything, you know, though they reckon they do. It’s a different world, their world. A hard one, I admit.
<name>George</name>	George	Digger	[MASK] swallowed hard to have all their years together, and so much affection, and so many events, passed over; but death, he knew, is an official thing, so are its ceremonies, and there was no public record of their years together.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Vic	He knew [MASK]. You could trust him with your life. On the other hand, you couldn’t trust him with tuppence. He had been surprised at first that some fellow he knew, and knew well, should be getting on in the world.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Digger	The walls between things had been breaking down for a while now. ‘[MASK]?’ He was being hauled up, away from the light. When his eyes opened it was dark. The hospital hut was all shadows of men moving against the light outside.
<name>Mr. Kurtz</name>	Mr. Kurtz	Pa.	If the household was shaky, and it was at times, it was because of this. He was an odd fellow, [MASK] For all his generosity of flesh he was not expansive. People who thought that all large men should be jolly and lovers of life were disappointed in him.
<name>it</name>	it	Vic	His lies were stupid ones that were bound to be exposed, which was, perhaps, just what he intended. They were lies whose only purpose was to win attention. But what was the point of that, [MASK] demanded, when all it showed was that he was a liar?
<name>cake</name>	cake	Napoleon	She called the boys up to get a piece of [MASK]. They came in barefoot and in their house clothes, shorts and ragged shirts, and were awkward at first but found their tongues at last under her meaningful looks. He knew them already, of course.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Vic	Still, this didn’t prevent him from teasing the fellow. ‘Go on,’ he’d say with mock astonishment when [MASK] came out with some bit of self-promotion by which he hoped they might be impressed. He did, too, regularly, and sank himself.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Digger	[MASK] was planing a set of planks, three or four of which stood upright against the trunk of the pepper tree. Pale shavings, almost transparent and showing the honey-coloured grain, curled off the blade as he swept his arm through, fell, turned over, and rolled away in the breeze.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Ellie	But what she was seeing still, behind the smile and the clear roundness of his pupils, was the look she had seen earlier, an afterglow as when a bright light has imprinted itself on your eyeball and remains for long seconds after you have looked away. ‘[MASK]?’
<name>Chris</name>	Chris	Anson	With a kind of dumb patience he stood tying the rag-ends together, then turned and moved away. But what he thought now was something different: that it had taken him forty years to accept the hard facts of existence, whereas that fellow [MASK] had got there in just months.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Vic	He saw things large. ‘That’s a good question,’ he told [MASK] once, chewing on his moustache. ‘If we knew the answer to that one, young feller, we’d be on the way to millions.’ ‘Would we?
<name>Ignatius</name>	Ignatius	Vic	The moment sat so lightly upon him that he seemed weightless, and [MASK] had again a vision of him dancing, clod-hopping about on the pavement like a puppet, but one that was not attached to anything.
<name>person</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	person (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	Digger	He could see how pinched [MASK] looked. He was sorry for that. ‘I’m up against it,’ he said simply, i wouldn’t ask if I had the option. You’re the only one.’
<name>Aunt Ada</name>	Aunt Ada	Meggsie	He hoarded things, even the most useless scraps and leftovers, but knew how odd it was and hid it. He looked now at the peanut he was holding. Very slowly, he put it in his mouth and began to chew. All through [MASK]’s long Sunday dinner
<name>Mrs. Jones</name>	Mrs. Jones	Vic	[MASK] could hear them at night, and the fury of it tormented him. He was nearly twelve. She was soft with him, but expected nothing in return. She was a person, it seemed, who had no expectations of any sort, and this touched him
<name>He</name>	He	Digger	They had possums that sometimes came right into the house and would take a bite out of some piece of fruit in the bowl on the kitchen table, leaving paw marks all over the floor. [MASK] was sorry now that he had said anything.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Lucille	As the light settled out and his heart, which appeared to be the real source of it, slowed at last to normal pace, and since it had been free-floating, came to rest again under his ribs, he saw that [MASK] was there, just turning on the second step.
<name>He</name>	He	Digger	He went on quickly to cover the embarrassment of it. [MASK] was looking more and more uneasy. He was actually wringing his hands. ‘You see, we need someone who isn’t known, who couldn’t be traced - or not easily.
<name>Mr. Birling</name>	Mr. Birling	Digger	Quickly he laid the thing out, sticking to the plainest terms. [MASK] heard him through. ‘But what use would I be?’ he said at last. ‘I don’t know anything about shares' ‘You wouldn’t have to.
<name>him</name>	him	Vic	The word millions meant something definite to him. ‘Well, millions is an exaggeration,’ he said. ‘Let’s say: to setting ourselves pretty firmly on our feet.’ But that wasn’t enough for [MASK]. It might do for a start.
