<name>He</name>	He	Kipler	I’m sure their rooms were a hundred and fifty dollars a night. [MASK] is writing this down with great drama, the calculator clicking in his brain. “What’d you spend traveling? A couple hours each way?” “I guess,” I say.
<name>He</name>	He	Booker	She’s a hard woman who cries with great reluctance, but she’s slowly losing it. I pat her arm, and hand her a tissue. [MASK] squeezes the back of my neck, and says he’ll call me next week.
<name>source</name>	source	Deck	According to [MASK], the legal system shuts down from December 15 until after the new year. Judges don’t schedule trials and hearings. Lawyers and their firms are busy with office parties and employee lunches. It’s a wonderful time for me to leave town.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Dot	The doors are open, and [MASK] sticks the contract inside. We can hear her penetrating voice. “I know you think they’re crazy,” he says, reading my mind. “But they’re good people who’ve had some bad breaks.
<name>The lawyer</name>	The lawyer	Drummond	In a good bad-faith case, the claim file is an amazing historical account of one screwup after another. I’m entitled to it, and should’ve received it ten days ago. [MASK] pled his innocence, said his client was dragging its feet.
<name>Marlene</name>	Marlene	Dot	The house is humid and sticky, the smell of stale tobacco everywhere. “Something to drink?” she asks. “No thanks.” I take a seat at the table. [MASK] pours a generic diet cola over ice and leans with her back to the counter.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Buddy	I wonder how much they bill for Saturday depositions. Not long into the depo, the navy blazers come off and the ties are loosened. During a long pause, the back door slams suddenly and [MASK] stumbles onto the patio.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Dogan	THIS IS a semi-legitimate visit to the hospital, my first. We find [MASK] alone with his broken leg, broken ribs, broken wrist and facial cuts and bruises. He’s young, around twenty, no wedding band.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Rudy	She thinks she’s a real negotiator. I tried to explain things to her, but you know how hardheaded she is.” “Don’t do it, [MASK]. This case is worth a fortune.” “I know.
<name>he</name>	he	Cliff	I wonder what price she paid for dropping the charges. [MASK] shakes hands with his lawyer, and struts down the aisle, past my bench, out the door, free to do whatever he pleases, immune from prosecution because there’s no one to help her.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Drummond	“What?” I can’t think of anything worse at this moment than having a drink with [MASK]. “Business. Settlement possibilities. Could you run by my office, say, fifteen minutes from now? We’re just around the corner, you know.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Perotti	Once had to throw an insurance adjuster out of his house. I’d give him a nine.” “What about [MASK]?” “Great guy. Couldn’t believe an insurance company could actually kill a person. He’s with us.”
<name>Counselor</name>	Counselor	Drummond	[MASK] appears shocked and wounded. “But, Your Honor, I have the right to conduct a thorough examination of this witness.” “Sure you do. But most of what he’s said so far is already before the jury. It’s repetitive.”
<name>Mr. Antolini</name>	Mr. Antolini	Rudy	I read it again, then stare at it for a long time. A knock on the door jolts me from my confused state. “Come in,” I say. It cracks slowly and a slight little man sticks his head through. “[MASK]?”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Madeline	Nothing.” There’s something cozy about having [MASK] on my side. “So I explained to him in great detail how he had screwed one of our grads, and we got into one huge catfight on the phone.” I can’t help but smile.
<name>James</name>	James	COOPER	[MASK] LIKES TO DRINK vodka in his office, but only after 6 p.m. He invites me to join him. He keeps the bottle in a small freezer in a closet that serves as a bar, and he sips it straight, no ice, no water.
<name>Dr. Patel</name>	Dr. Patel	Craggdale	The lady next to her would like to stare but her neck is in a brace. Neither of us knows a soul in this room, so why should we worry? “So who’s your doctor?” she asks. “[MASK],” I answer.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Kipler	I watch out of the corner of my eye. As he steps to the defense table, he gazes for a quick second at the two executives, and I see the unmistakable look of fear in his eyes. Goose bumps cover my forearms and legs. [MASK] switches gears.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Deck	Never trust an insurance company’s own figures because they make their own accounting rules. But surely somewhere down the road there’ll be a spare million or so for us. I don’t really believe this. Neither does [MASK].
<name>someone</name>	someone	Drummond	It’s one of the best bad-faith cases I’ve ever seen, and I’ve looked at thousands.” “There’s more,” I say, then I tell him about our phone lines being tapped and the strong evidence that [MASK] is listening in.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Randolph	She’s been gone for less than a month. This is good for her. “And [MASK] is after me to sign a power of attorney that would allow him to do things on my behalf. What do you think?”
<name>him</name>	him	Cliff	He’s suddenly shaking and snarling words at her. She dishes it right back. The volume increases and I quickly discern that they’re discussing whether or not she’ll testify against him in court. Seems she hasn’t made up her mind. Seems this really bothers [MASK].
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Kipler	[MASK] asks me to be in court at nine anyway, and he’ll handle things from there. I tell him I’m ready. I certainly should be. I’ve typed every possible question for each of the witnesses, and His Honor himself has made suggestions.
<name>Opposing Counsel</name>	Opposing Counsel	Drummond	Brief though it is, it’s an absolutely golden moment. I smile at them. They smile at me. They believe everything from my witnesses, nothing from [MASK]’s. “Nothing else, Your Honor,” I say with disgust, as if I’m tired of this lying scoundrel.
<name>Sal</name>	Sal	Kelly	[MASK] and I will talk about it one of these days, but not anytime soon. We’ll pick a small college town because she wants to go to school. She’s only twenty. I’m still a kid myself.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Dot	The last funeral I attended was my father’s, and I try desperately not to think of it. The crowd inches together under the burgundy canopy as the young minister reads from the Bible. We stare at the gray casket with flowers around it. I can hear [MASK] crying softly.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Kelly	“[MASK]’s in trouble. She needs your help.” “What’s happened?” “He beat her again. Came home drunk, the usual.” “When?” I’m standing in the dark beside my bed, trying to find the lamp switch.
<name>Janine</name>	Janine	Dot	The same dogs snarl at me from behind the chain-link next door as I park in the Black driveway. [MASK] is standing on the cluttered porch, cigarette cocked with filter tip just inches from her lips, a bluish fog drifting lazily from above her head across the front lawn.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Deck	The phones have yet to start ringing. [MASK] is downtown somewhere. I’m afraid to guess where he might be prowling. I have plenty of time to play the motion game. I am motivated by thoughts of my sorrowful little client and the screwing that he got.
<name>Lake</name>	Lake	Dot	To avoid as much of this as possible, I stop at a pay phone at a Gulf station and call [MASK]. What a shame. The Lake firm has the finest electronic gadgetry available, and I’m forced to use a pay phone.
<name>Olivia</name>	Olivia	Drummond	After the Section U fiasco yesterday, nobody will believe a word he says. I’m sure [MASK] chewed on him until midnight. He looks rather haggard. I hand him the official copy of the claims information, and ask him if he can identify it.
<name>Jimmy</name>	Jimmy	Drummond	Let’s wait for the perfect moment when we need to send those clowns on a goose chase.” Both of us slowly start grinning. I WAIT TWO DAYS, and call [MASK] with the sad news that my client does not want his filthy money.
<name>Keisha</name>	Keisha	Booker	Here, there’s not a white face to be seen. [MASK] gives me a quick tour. Even though it’s lunch, the place is hopping. Word processors, copiers, faxes, phones, voices—there’s a veritable racket in the hallways.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Craig	I was in his wedding last year. [MASK] had one goal when we started college, and that was to teach high school history. He was very bright and college was too easy for him. We had long discussions about what to do with our lives.
<name>Jess</name>	Jess	Butch	“Sure, yeah, right. He certainly is better off. Really sad, though.” We watch as [MASK] expertly puts the phone back together, then shrugs at me as if I know precisely what to do next.
<name>Opposing counsel</name>	Opposing counsel	Drummond	But [MASK] always seemed to have the upper hand. I study his pleadings, briefs, motions, his written discovery and his responses to the same received from the plaintiffs. I read his depositions in bed at night. I memorize his pretrial orders.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Deck	I can see some of the countryside. We’re saving some valuable money. I’ve thought of lots of reasons. [MASK] drives and says little. I think he’s somewhat embarrassed because we can’t afford better. And he knows he should be going too.
<name>Blaze</name>	Blaze	Deck	[MASK] forces two pedestrians off the street, then zips through a tiny parking lot. “You see that door over there,” he says, pointing at the corner of the Shelby County Courthouse, a massive structure that covers an entire city block. “Yeah.”
<name>Malachy</name>	Malachy	Drummond	They squirm in perfect hemorrhoidal harmony. A moment of pain, then [MASK] says, “We’ll double it. A hundred and fifty thousand. You get fifty or so, your client gets a—” “I can do the math,” I say.
<name>doctor</name>	doctor	Rudy	Her lip is suddenly quivering and her eyes are wet. She gently touches my wrist and looks helplessly at me. “Please hurry, [MASK]. We need help. My boy is dying.” We stare at each other forever, and I finally nod and mumble something.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Rudy	When he wakes up, he touches my arm, tries to squeeze it, and says, “Do you want to settle, [MASK]? Some of the money is yours.” “No. I don’t want to settle,” I say with conviction.
<name>Dad</name>	Dad	Deck	I was forced to dip into my savings a few times, but I have twenty-eight hundred in the bank, money I’ve saved by living frugally and burying it when I could. [MASK] doesn’t spend it either. He just blows it at the blackjack tables.
<name>Donald Trump</name>	Donald Trump	Drummond	Instead of soft-pedaling by admitting a mistake was made by unknown incompetents deep within a huge company, [MASK] is conceding nothing. He’ll claim bone marrow transplants are very unreliable, bad medicine, certainly not an accepted and routine method of treating acute leukemia.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Lufkin	No answer will benefit him at this point. The jurors know full well that [MASK] lied to them, so he can’t tell the jurors they really didn’t hear what they really heard. And he certainly can’t admit that one of his vice presidents lied to the jury.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Max	Great Benefit is worth between four hundred and five hundred million dollars, about half of it hidden in reserves and surpluses. This is what must be explained to the jury. I don’t dare suggest the unthinkable, the notion of working on Christmas Day, but [MASK] is gung-ho.
<name>Officer</name>	Officer	Smotherton	“We have no choice, ma’am,” [MASK] says, suddenly much nicer. “If your lawyer here is worth his salt, he’ll get you out sometime tomorrow. That is, if you can post bond. But I can’t just release you because I want to.”
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Kipler	Thankfully, they’re also usually too busy for jury duty. I’ve isolated only five on my list, and I’m sure each will have a dozen reasons to be excused. [MASK], under different circumstances, might give them a hard time.
<name>Judge</name>	Judge	Kipler	So, I have my work cut out for me. Right now, though, I’m sick of work. I want to get on a plane and find a beach. [MASK] raps his gavel, and this trial is officially over.
<name>him</name>	him	Drummond	He’s probably reading this. “What a surprise,” I say firmly and crisply into the phone. I want [MASK] to grab every syllable. The thought of lawyers talking to potential jurors before the selection process is incredible, almost unbelievable.
<name>doesn't exist in the given passage</name>	doesn't exist in the given passage	Rudy	They can’t wait for her to die so they’ll all be rich. It’s very hard to suppress a grin. “That’s good,” I say. “She’s been a lonely old woman.” “She really likes you, [MASK].
<name>Jimmy</name>	Jimmy	DECK	“I’m worried.” “Me too.” Twenty-five I KNOW [MASK]’S having a hard time controlling his excitement these days. The idea of having his own office and keeping half the fees without the benefit of a law license is terribly thrilling.
<name>Irene</name>	Irene	Rudy	We’re in a booth in the back of a dark dining room. No one could possibly hear us, but he’s anxious nonetheless. “Something’s about to go down, [MASK], I’m sure of it.
<name>He</name>	He	Underhall	[MASK] knows I don’t have a copy of the agreement because he buried the original somewhere. But he can’t be certain. Strange things happen. How in the world did I find the Section U’s? He can’t admit there’s an agreement.
<name>the lawyer</name>	the lawyer	Deck	He’s in significant pain, so we don’t stay long. His name’s on the contract. We say good-bye and promise to see him tomorrow. By noon, [MASK] has a copy of the accident report and has already talked to the teenager’s father.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Leuberg	[MASK] gives me a wicked smile. “You are indeed. Assuming his parents have told you everything. Always a shaky assumption.” “But if everything’s right there?” I ask, pointing to the file. He shrugs and nods and smiles again.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Booker	“Good,” I say. “Thanks, [MASK].” “Don’t mention it. I think it’s safe for you to venture out now. That is, if you can tear yourself away from your research.” “I’ll try.”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Buddy	He’s changed shirts, now wears a familiar red pullover with dark stains, and he carries a sinister-looking paper bag. I try to concentrate on my witness, but out of the corner of my eye I can’t help but watch as [MASK] walks across the yard, eyeing us suspiciously.
<name>He</name>	He	Booker	Thirty-two I SUSPECT THE REASON [MASK] chose this fancy restaurant is because he has good news. The table is covered with silver. The napkins are linen. He must have a client who’s paying for this. He arrives fifteen minutes late, very unlike him
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Rudy	Do it fast. It’s not as bad as it looks.” “It’s not?” “No, [MASK]. It’s paperwork. You’ll learn. These bastards will file every motion known and many they invent, all with thick supporting briefs.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Booker	“Oh my God,” I say. “Just be cool,” [MASK] says, then both of us practically race to the courtroom. I take a deep breath, say a quick prayer and step inside.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Underhall	But I can’t. I wad the meaningless piece of paper and dramatically toss it on the table. “No further questions,” I say. [MASK] exhales mightily. A heart attack has been avoided. He leaps from the witness stand and leaves the courtroom.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Jackson	About one in twenty-five will actually consult a lawyer.” I’m recollecting documents and fragments of depositions as [MASK] tells me this, and, suddenly, the pieces are falling into place. “How can you prove this?” I ask.
<name>Lawyer</name>	Lawyer	Drummond	He eagerly takes the claims manual and explains various sections to the jury. It’s all laid out here in black and white. Everything works wonderfully! They move from the manuals to the numbers. [MASK] asks if he’s had the chance to review the information regarding policies, claims and denials.
<name>Andy</name>	Andy	Drummond	’s vow to give the money to the American Leukemia Society. [MASK] ends with an appeal for sanity and fairness. His voice deepens and his words get slower. He’s nothing but sincerity. Please do what is fair, he asks, and takes his seat.
<name>Augustus</name>	Augustus	Smoot	[MASK] is standing by a window watching us, no doubt wondering what manner of advice we’re dispensing to evoke such sorrow. “Where does he live?” I ask, just searching for a question the answer to which will allow me to write for a few seconds on my pad and ignore the tears.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Kipler	It’s just that, well, right now, my trial calendar is—” “How about next Thursday?” [MASK] interrupts, and there’s dead silence across the aisle. “Looks fine to me, Your Honor,” I say loudly.
<name>IRS</name>	IRS	Deck	They were shopping for antiques, took a wrong turn downstairs and happened to catch me napping at my desk. We had a pleasant visit, one thing led to another, and they waited as I typed their wills. They paid me in cash, which I duly reported to [MASK], the bookkeeper.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Deck	He sticks his right hand across the table for me to shake. This is a huge moment for [MASK]. I wish I felt the same way. I’ve also decided that I’ll try to rein him in, to shame him from racing to every disaster.
<name>Great Benefit</name>	Great Benefit	Booker	“Is there an exclusion for bone marrow transplants?” “Hell no. Our doctor even looked at the policy and said Great Benefit ought to pay because bone mare transplants are just routine treatment now.” [MASK]’s client wipes his face with both hands, stands and excuses himself.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Deck	I warned her against smoking in front of the jurors. [MASK] and I huddle at our table and compare notes. He sits behind me, and he’s been watching the jurors. The denial letters got their attention. The Stupid Letter infuriated them.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	KELLY	Surely an angel will tell him what happened today. They’ve been exposed and proven wrong. I don’t hate them anymore. [MASK] CUTS her thin slice of pizza with a fork and takes tiny bites. Her lips are still swollen and her cheeks and jaws are very sore.
<name>he</name>	he	Deck	I swallow hard. The twinge turns into panic. “Get to work,” he adds. “It’ll be embarrassing to lose the case on a motion to dismiss.” “I’m working on it too,” [MASK] adds helpfully. “Good.
<name>He</name>	He	Deck	They both lived in such darkness here. “Yeah. I don’t know how. Some things you don’t ask.” [MASK] has a blank look on his face. He’s deep in thought. “The money’s still here, you know.”
<name>Saul</name>	Saul	Murderers	“[MASK]?” “Yeah, but most can’t pay for a private lawyer.” “Rapists and child molesters?” I frown and pause for a second. “No.” “Men who beat their wives?” “No, never.”
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Dot	He’s wearing a cap of some sort, probably with wool earflaps, and he slowly lifts the bottle to his lips. It appears to be in a brown paper bag. He takes a leisurely nip. I hear [MASK] speaking softly to her son.
<name>Jimmy</name>	Jimmy	Butch	[MASK] confesses that he’s no expert on bugging devices, but he’s been around. They’re easy to spot. Identical devices in all three phones. They were about to search for more bugs, but decided to wait for me. “More bugs?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Kipler	Though [MASK] is not here, his presence still dominates. His order states, in very plain terms, that the six witnesses I’ve requested are to be available at nine this morning, and that I have sole discretion as to the order in which they’re deposed.
<name>John</name>	John	Keeley	[MASK]’s smile disappeared just after lunch, but he was determined to answer for as long as I could ask. He again thanks me for allowing him to finish first, and thanks me for releasing him from further questions.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Bruiser	“But it ain’t exactly a salaried position,” [MASK] says, warming to the idea. “No sir. I don’t operate that way. I expect my associates to pay for themselves, to generate their own fees.” I’m too stunned to speak.
<name>Galt</name>	Galt	Badley	I sit here tonight, on the promenade, glancing at the people walking the mall, then flashing another card from my stack: R. C. [MASK] is the name in bold letters. Age forty-seven, white male, plumber, high school education, lives in a southeast Memphis suburb.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Deck	[MASK] has no future. He cannot pass the bar exam, and there’s no place for him to go. He’ll spend a few weeks cleaning up my files, but he can’t operate without a Bruiser or a Rudy to front for him.
<name>The lawyer</name>	The lawyer	Booker	She needs a new will. She’s neglected by her children and grandchildren, so, of course, she wants to cut them out.” “How much?” “Twenty million or so.” [MASK] glances at me with a great deal of suspicion.
<name>the plaintiffs lawyer</name>	the plaintiffs lawyer	Drummond	Defense lawyers are trained to express shock and disbelief with any settlement proposal made by a plaintiffs lawyer, and my offer is met with the expected shaking of heads and clearing of throats and even a slight chuckle from somewhere behind me where the minions are clustered. “You wish,” [MASK] says acidly.
<name>the doctor</name>	the doctor	Kord	Speculation. The doctor can’t testify as to whether or not the transplant would’ve worked.” “Overruled. Save it for cross-examination.” I ask a few more questions about the procedure, and while [MASK] answers I pay attention to the jurors.
<name>partner</name>	partner	Leo	“I have nothing to hide.” A couple of the turds behind me cough at this. “Very well. It’s your grave you’re digging, [MASK]. Just don’t get out of line.” “WHAT’D Y’ALL DO in there?”
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Robin	He needs to see.” With [MASK]’s assistance, she carefully gets to her feet, turns her back to me, and lifts the tee shirt above her waist. There’s nothing underneath, nothing but solid bruises on her rear and the backs of her legs.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Robin	As soon as possible.” “I’ll do it tomorrow.” She squeezes my hand and closes her right eye. “Which brings up the second problem,” [MASK] says. “She can’t stay here.
<name>Mr. Johnson</name>	Mr. Johnson	Barry	And I had been prepared to suggest a few hours on Sunday afternoon, if he needed me. But I worried for nothing. [MASK] is leaving town for the weekend, and since I wouldn’t dare try to enter the office without his assistance, the issue quickly became moot.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Lufkin	He looks at it as if he’s never seen it before, but identifies it when I ask him to. Everybody knows the next question. “Is this a complete manual?” He flips through it slowly, takes his time. He obviously has had the benefit of [MASK]’s experience yesterday.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Kipler	It will be ugly. I won’t have to say much. “On the record,” [MASK] snaps at the court reporter, and the clones across the aisle lurch forward and hover over their legal pads. Four, today.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Delbert	[MASK] does not fully comprehend this, and he’s not bright enough to attack from different angles. For all he knows, he might be violating the law. “I hope you’re not meddling, boy,” he says as fiercely as possible.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Booker	Shoes and ties, and maybe some food that doesn’t come in a can, and perhaps a fresh pack of Jockey shorts.” At least twice a month for three years now, [MASK] and his wife have invited me to dinner.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Deck	I hang up the phone, rewind the tape in the recorder and play it aloud. [MASK] eases backward into a chair, his mouth wide open, his four shiny teeth glistening. “They bugged our phones,” he says in sheer disbelief when the tape stops.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Dru	Anything suspicious? What was he supposed to do today? Who was he supposed to see? Who talked to him last? There is an atmosphere of panic in the room, an air of confusion that’s not alleviated in the least by [MASK]’s incessant bawling.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Drummond	And I understand this too. She neither needs nor wants their money. She wants justice. As she said on the front porch the last time I stopped by, “I want them sumbitches outta business.” “That’s outrageous,” [MASK] says dramatically.
<name>Betty</name>	Betty	Charlene	“You drank two six-packs?” he asks with disbelief. [MASK] leaves to check on the child who’s begun squalling again from the back. I conclude with the process server, the lawsuit, the eviction. It’s just been a helluva day.
<name>he</name>	he	Deck	“Do we have an extension cord?” he asks. “Yes. I brought one,” [MASK] says, already shuffling through the grass. “It’s a hundred-footer.” The entire lot is less than eighty feet wide and maybe a hundred feet deep.
<name>He</name>	He	Drummond	It would take an exceptionally gifted expert to make Section U sound good. With virtually no prompting, he leads us through a complete checklist of how such a claim should be handled. [MASK] gravely nods his head, as if they’re really kicking some ass now.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Kelly	She lifts her drink, and I notice the bandages on both wrists. She has yet to see me. In fact, I realize she would see no one if the room was full. [MASK]’s in her own little world. Looks like a broken ankle.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Brownies	Introductions are made, and she quickly takes control of the visit. Cookies? [MASK]? Something to read? She props pillows around him on the bench, chirping happily the entire time. She has a heart of gold.
