<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Creena	Suddenly [MASK] is handing her something—it is a handkerchief sachet, faintly perfumed, and, inside, a ruled page folded tight. Soon as she hands it, she is gone. Into the riven Breast Of a proud Heart A paupers fate Was cut.
<name>He</name>	He	Cormac	He had changed his lair to the shoe closet and lay under a shelf, doubled up, shoes and must all around him. After dark she asked him to come out. “It’s very peaceful,” [MASK] says.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Percy	She will not buy toffees, she will put it to buy talc, to smell nice for [MASK], to absorb the sweat. “Who’s the local doctor?” the missus asked then, but vaguely, as if it were an afterthought.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Martin	“You look shook,” he says, does not move, and slugs the cold dregs of tea with intent. “I’m afraid you’ll have to leave, [MASK],” she says, rising, and then grips the back of the chair because of being overcome by dizziness.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Ned	The sudden silence is appalling. “Did you get him?” [MASK] asks, crawling towards him, saliva spilling out of his mouth. “I don’t know.” He starts to reload, filling it by feel, because darkness has suddenly descended.
<name>Flanagan</name>	Flanagan	Brennan	The Limerick sergeant thinks that it’s a guy called [MASK] ... He recognised him by an iron hand.” “Dead?” “He’ll never father a child again.” “Who hit?” <<rr-i /^i
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Tom	That hail of fire ...” “They kept well in,” [MASK] says, pointing to the lit low-lying windows scattered throughout the mountain, their lights merry and festive, like Christmas candles beaming in the grey-black dismal sphere.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Brid	“They gave me a job at the big house,” he said, and lied about money. The missus hadn’t even mentioned money. His mother said it wouldn’t last. She knew that woman well, knew about her moods from [MASK].
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Cliadhna	He was in a house I was in once. He described this house very well . . . even this room. Said you adopted him . . . Were his second mother. He called you [MASK], Queen of the Munster Fairies. He worshipped you.”
<name>Rodriguez</name>	Rodriguez	Michael	“About ten feet.” They wait then for the other two men to take their positions, and touching [MASK] on the shoulder, he gives him one last bit of advice: “If you have to shoot, make sure you have a clean line of fire.”
<name>Jimmy</name>	Jimmy	Tom	“Oh, they’re half-and-half fellas . . . Never mind them . . . Put your thinking cap on. Who, who?” “A hippie.” “A hippie, my arse, [MASK] . . . It’s your man . . .
<name>John</name>	John	Rory	Silhouetted in the distance is a figure, or what looks like a figure that might even be a tree, and fixing it as best he can, [MASK] aims his gun and moves towards it, ready to cap it. “Halt.”
<name>Marina</name>	Marina	Instinctively	[MASK] she sprinkles holy water first on her daughter, then on herself, then on the floor, making sure to avoid where he stands. “We love our country,” she says contemptuously. “So do we all,” he says.
<name>Brigid</name>	Brigid	Peg	Through the narrow slit in the stone wall of the loft he sees nothing, neither a vehicle nor a figure. It’s a cow—moaning for all she’s worth. All he bloody needs. Where is she? Where are you? “Where are you, [MASK] . . .
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Cormac	But put them at close range and they’d fail to perform. No aptitude . . . none whatsoever.” “I’m always afraid I’ll fail.” “Ah . . . You have it in you, you have belly, [MASK].”
<name>Knacker</name>	Knacker	Boss	“It’s a great story, [MASK].” “It’s a hoot.” “It’s the art in the telling,” the knacker says, and is asked what an ape like him would know about the art in the telling when he couldn’t even sign an X on a ballot sheet.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Iain	“What the fuck . . . You have a fine car . . . You must have money.” “Funds are not my responsibility . . . That’s not why I came. To fund you.” “What the fuck, [MASK].”
<name>Leopold</name>	Leopold	James	A sharpening of the senses has come with his arrival and swarms of memory, even down to her husband, [MASK], writing her that letter at the bureau and overturning the bottle of ink out of spite, that letter telling her to pack her utensils and be gone.
<name>Reuben</name>	Reuben	Ross	Two shells, each sounding to [MASK] like a pig’s bladder being burst, and the creature itself stock-still, having no time to struggle or buck. “We’ll clean her up now,” he says, as if it’s his duty to console them.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Josie	“I am,” [MASK] said, and felt eyes hot and pepper-coloured scanning her up and down. It was what the girl said then that unnerved her, something about the missing pane of glass in the conservatory window. “Oh yes . . .
<name>Job</name>	Job	Caimin	[MASK] s wish seems to have been granted, for all kinds of disease and sickness were inflicted on his body—“so that no bone of him joined another bone on the earth, but they melted and decayed with the anguish of every disease and every tribulation.”
<name>Goldie</name>	Goldie	Duckie	Once it was a golden seal that she thought was a duck and they laughed buckets over it, which was how the nickname [MASK] had come to her. There were lots of little things like that. “How do I cook this thing?”
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Egan	It was [MASK] who sang it softly and in some sort of muted apology. Not long after, her husband stood bejfore her, thick in tongue now, thick and slurry, eyes crinkled sure if she is she or another.
<name>Swotty</name>	Swotty	Eejits	“Go on . . . admit it ... You like the buzz.” “I suppose I do. But I know fellas that would rather be in rooms studying and swotting.” “Don’t I know them well . . . [MASK] . . .
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Paud	Her husband never addressed merely made a grunt, an animal grun and knew how [MASK] had been sent was in disgrace. There was speculatio had had the assignation with. A foreig anonymous letters, the same wording things this person intended to do with be compelled to do in return.
<name>Stubb</name>	Stubb	Cormac	“How can there be so little blood?” [MASK] asks, and then howls it to the unslept ring of faces, who though they pity him are as well basking and rejoicing in that terrific pent-up exultance of men who have done something dangerous together.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jamie	She returned from her reverie to find the two men laughing, boisterous laughing such as is heard only when a good joke is cracked. “Did you hear that?” [MASK] was saying. “I was miles away,” she said with a certain hauteur.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	James	“But I’m giving it back,” she said, and held the bag upside down so that not only the slip but all the contents spewed out and rolled over the floor. That night she told [MASK]. She had to tell him before someone else did.
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Fogarty	“I’d like a bit of help with the clues,” another Guard, [MASK], says. “There seems to be a lot of lakes up here,” a strange Guard says. “Piles of them . . .
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Josie	“I’m sorry for what I said about old people and love,” she said. Eat a salt herring going to bed, Take a cup of water to the bedside. Future partner will come at midnight and give drink. [MASK] smiles as she says it.
<name>Lucia</name>	Lucia	Death	[MASK] has already entered; it is like a black star, a soft black star being hauled up the stairs on its iron shanks. In the bedroom she cuts her hair. The scissors are quite blunt and she cuts hurriedly and randomly. Grey-black switches fall onto the bed.
<name>Doyle</name>	Doyle	Cormac	“The only thing that will quiet these gurriers is for the ordinary people to say, Enough. Ordinary people get roped in . . . They get frightened . . . They get threatened. They yield to the terror of the vermin.” [MASK] balks at the word.
<name>Caitilin</name>	Caitilin	Trembling	“I’ll give you,” said the henwife, “a finer dress than either of them has ever seen. And now tell me what dress will you have?” “I’ll have,” said [MASK], “a dress as white as snow, and green shoes for my feet.”
<name>Nora</name>	Nora	Josie	The nurse muses why, the older they get, the madder they are for talk: their past, their present, their futures, anything, everything, afraid of death too, as if she was not afraid of it herself. “We never know,” [MASK] says.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Percy	“Nothing much.” And the girl involuntarily stuck out her tongue. She is thinking of a boy while she dances. The boy’s name is [MASK]. He has told her she has nice eyes. Also that his mother has cancer and will soon die.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Broke	[MASK] down, like a child, the morning he read his name in the Gazette, his name and the extent of his debts. “I’m ruined . . . I’ve ruined you,” he said, and because he cried she was not able to turn on him.
<name>Cal</name>	Cal	Mick	They’re never satisfied . . .You give in to them and your life is hell . . .You don’t give in and it’s hell anyhow.” He said it with his back to his brother. “I was going anyhow,” [MASK] said.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	McGreevy	It will fall forward and damage the house, the tree which her husband believed was guarding it. The tops of the evergreens are doing battle with each other, then sinking into one another’s clutches. Where was [MASK] now?
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lola	“Everything is to be as normal,” he says. “Normal,” she says, as if to an advocate in the room, the vanished [MASK] perhaps. “What have you come for?” “To lie low.”
<name>Jerome</name>	Jerome	Rory	“C’mon now,” [MASK] calls. He moves so fast it is as if he is above the ground in some rhythmic prance, like a pony, a reserve of strength that he keeps for times like this. “What’s that?”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Manus	“How do you know?” “Because I read the minutes.” “What did they say?” “Oh, [MASK] talk, how I lacked vision . . . Visions ... I stop people for nothing ... I am uncouth ... I am unpopular. ”
<name>Bluey</name>	Bluey	Nellie	The name had faded, but with a little sable brush he gave it definition again, brought it back to the cheeky duck-egg blue it had been— Serendipity. “And you behave yourself,” he says to [MASK], who is fiddling with the pompoms of a knitted scarf.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Paud	“A few blasted guns,” he said, whereupon she said not to her house, not to her house, and added that [MASK] had not enough noddle to mind sheep. “A week at the most,” he had said.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Cormac	“Can I look?” [MASK] says, thrilling to the fact that they have got something. “Well, at least she’s not tied up,” he says, mesmerised by the fact that he can take in the features of the room so clearly.
<name>silence</name>	silence	Libya	They must creep in [MASK]. Earlier he did some scrubbing. The sound of the scrubbing brought me down. He was on his knees, half the tiled floor with sudsy water and the other half grimed. The soap was so old that the black lines in it were like ribs of ingrained thread.
<name>Chastisement</name>	Chastisement	Defiance	“That’s why I’m cutting my hair,” she says to the dying light inside her and the shadows within the room, to a world rushing away, with no time for the old and not that much for the young either. [MASK]. Chastisement.
<name>Wiggins</name>	Wiggins	Teresa	I put stones and frog spawn in the kids’ beds ...” “You could have been useful, [MASK], you could have been the vital cog in the wheel of detection, and what did you do, you played ball with him.”
<name>McGinty</name>	McGinty	Cleary	Slept next night at [MASK]’s. March. Heard that three men with strange accents were looking for me. They were near me several times during the day but we did not meet. My suspicions became aroused so I proceeded across the mountain believing them to be auxiliaries.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	josie	([MASK]’s diary) He went out last night after dark. To discuss a job. They don’t call it death or murder, they call it a job. This house will be notorious for the fact that he hid here. There will be exaggerations.
<name>Nora</name>	Nora	Trembling	One Sunday morning, after the other two had gone to Mass, the old henwife came into the kitchen to [MASK] and said, “It’s at church you ought to be this day, instead of working here at home.”
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Jamie	She remembers hoops of barbed wire running along the length of high walls in a Midland town and how [MASK] had said, “Poor buggers in there counting the hours,” and how the driver had said no, that they were all doped, that they doped them, to keep them from rioting.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	James	Doors and windows wide open, old box irons on the doors to keep them from slamming, and [MASK]’s pride in showing her things, marching her around main rooms and lesser rooms and anterooms, saying they could do with a woman’s touch, a woman’s artistry.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Paud	Threats, shouts, expletives as he chased her down the hall, up one flight of stairs and then another, while she made for the bedroom, remembering how that morning [MASK] had cleaned the windows and hoping the ladder might still be there.
<name>Yelena</name>	Yelena	Josephine	“I have good mares in all my fields,” he says, and seeing her about to depart, he drags her back and says with a galling friendliness, “Not tonight, [MASK] . . . Not tonight.”
<name>Quirke</name>	Quirke	Michael	“Yes, the minute I kicked that door open I might have set off a booby trap and in the next few minutes the whole little edifice could go up in smoke.” “Oh my God,” [MASK] says, and blesses himself as they hurry out.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	James	“Look, look,” [MASK] would say, pointing to a bird high above them, a skylark or a buzzard, the spread of the wings outdistancing the body. He knew the birds. He had hunted on the islands.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Michael	He moves so fast it is as if he is above the ground in some rhythmic prance, like a pony, a reserve of strength that he keeps for times like this. “What’s that?” [MASK] says.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Manus	[MASK] had put the boot in with the superintendent and blown his chances. “There’s no need to snap,” she said. “I’m not snapping,” he said, and looked at her with a sort of apology. At least she kept thin.
<name>Bayard</name>	Bayard	Tom	“He’s here.” “This country is wiping itself out.” [MASK] could not be sure what he meant, or to whom he referred, himself or the shape sprawled pitifully and harmlessly against the sodden ditch. “I’ll need some light.”
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Matt	an crgy,” [MASK] says, and together they watch the two bodies rise, then caper around the room, meeting and parrying like lovers. “Get ready,” he says, ridding himself of the confines of the heavy jacket and stretching to take the sleep out of one of his legs.
<name>James</name>	James	Conor	[MASK] is the first to see that it is a deer sprawled over the bonnet, a roe, bounding from one hedge across to the next, possibly as it had done every morning, believing the lonely countryside to be its milieu.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Matt	“Get ready,” he says, ridding himself of the confines of the heavy jacket and stretching to take the sleep out of one of his legs. “What do we do, [MASK]?” “You fire your cylinders . . .
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Frank	“He’d like something to eat”—her voice dry and tart as she muses pitilessly on the stranger’s plight. “He delivered the calf for us ... A fine wee calf . . . Isn’t she, [MASK]?”
<name>he</name>	he	James	“Where was it?” “God knows ... I used to hide drink from my husband,” she says, almost regretfully. “Was [MASK] a drinking man?” he asks; then giving some inaudible toast, he has his first sip.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Sheila	The children wrote the labels but weren’t sure which bits were which. She would be glad to see the end of it. “I said how do you want this cooked,” [MASK] said, holding up the bag fuzzed with blood, which looked gruesome to her.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Creena	[MASK] asks. “Get your hat and coat on,” he says, and as he does, the mother hears the sirens starting up in the valley down below and knows that yes, the woman was right, the woman was right about its being a fateful night on the mountain.
<name>John</name>	John	Sheila	There were lots of little things like that. “How do I cook this thing?” [MASK] says, returning and holding up in its bloodied bag the shins of the deer he had shot a month before. They were sick of eating it.
<name>Reinhardt</name>	Reinhardt	Tobin	“Pure madness,” [MASK] says as they wait. The dark, a godforsaken path, and now clouds bursting apart and rain on their heads and rain on their uniforms and rain that will make a muddy track impassable.
<name>Deasy</name>	Deasy	Ducks	“[MASK],” he said through the open door, “don’t bother with the damned shins,” adding that he’d pop down and get a takeaway and they’ll have an al fresco by the fire.
<name>Reilly</name>	Reilly	Riley	In one window there was a skeleton of a little foot, a little dead foot that gleamed like the white keys of the piano. It made her cry. She thought of home then, the bog road, turf being cut, and her family believing that she was living the life of [MASK].
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Jamie	[MASK] said, balancing it on his palm so that he could inspect it thoroughly. Two pale concave disks of wood, saucer-shaped, wedged against each other at a peculiar angle. The wood was very white, as if pickled in brine or snow.
<name>Horatio</name>	Horatio	Horatio	She has never liked him, not since the day of the horse show, when he made her park her car half a mile away and walk in her stiletto shoes. “There are more things, [MASK], in heaven and hell,” he says as he strides down the street.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Aoife	He could not tell me until we got to know one another better. This could go on for months or a year. Yet I feel it is a matter of days. I have intuitions, just like he has. “[MASK], tell your daddy . .
<name>Seamus</name>	Seamus	Paud	“What has he done this time?” she had asked. He hedged, said he wasn’t sure, something to do with leaflets; then it came out: [MASK] was minding guns in a field for some bloke whom the Guards suspected.
<name>Macomber</name>	Macomber	Michael	“What’s up there?” “There’s a hut on the spur of the mountain.” “Is there cover?” “There’s only what you can see.” “You go first, [MASK] . . . I’m behind you . . .
<name>Private</name>	Private	McGreevy	Then, with a disbelieving intake of breath, he senses another, as through the lacework of frosty green he sees the rifle breaching the cover and a boggled face within a foot of him. “Where do you think you’re going, [MASK]?”
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Ned	“I got him,” he says to [MASK], who is trembling beside him. “We should say an act of contrition.” “You say it,” he says, and hauls the body down to lay it on the bank.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Shiona	He thinks of [MASK]. So soft a sound. Like silk or a breeze. He grants himself one, two, three fleeting reflections of her, and then he holds his head in both hands and pummels it and bangs it on the iron rungs to blank out the longing.
<name>Seamus</name>	Seamus	Matt	They sit side by side, [MASK] pushing his elbows out like oars, positioning and repositioning himself to get the space and the comfort he requires. Young lads have to learn to be accommodating and to shrink themselves in tight surroundings. “I hear he’s a very quiet sort of person.
<name>Georgina</name>	Georgina	Deirdre	She’d give it a nice name. [MASK] or something like that. The missus didn’t want a baby either. Wore corsets that were too tight. Had to have assistance at pulling the lacings; they had to be pulled until she had an hourglass waist and could barely breathe.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Paud	[MASK] full of temper, dying to join up and learn about guns and be given a job and a rank. How little he knew. How little anyone knew when they joined up. How little that woman up in the bed knew with her wild, staring.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Manus	Absolute secrecy . . . Lids on.” “[MASK] said what about the woman in the big house?” “Don’t hit the woman yet. I want a surveillance on the house. Get the night spots . . . Something’s cooking there.”
<name>Timothy</name>	Timothy	Paud	[MASK] could not look up at the missus, but rather fixed his attention on her skirt, a grey skirt with a little swirl of pleats around the bottom. He stared at the stitched hearts at the top of each pleat, hearts threaded in grey.
<name>Wife</name>	Wife	Catherine	matinee and evening—and then she got the lonesomes, his [MASK] did, and wanted drives back to the town to her father’s pub, and it was all right for a time, and he’d drink and she’d drink with him
<name>Leopold</name>	Leopold	Percy	She flips the white with a fork on a soup plate when there’s no one around. Just stiff enough, a bit like something else, like [MASK] when he starts to bubble in her. Always wants to take it out. She fights him, though.
<name>Mrs. Dalloway</name>	Mrs. Dalloway	Josie	“You people talk a lot of rubbish,” [MASK] said, retreating, then hurrying back with the penny and a slice of cold pie. “A man will come in and a child will go out,” she said, trotting off and looking down disgruntled at her spoils.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Matt	Something about [MASK], his superior, makes him say these idiotic things. A moon is no help to them at all. Bright moonlight is not what they want, but darkness, darkness in order to get a clearer picture of what’s going on inside the house.
<name>She</name>	She	Josie	A bit like my room,” she says, and laughs. “Who’s that?” [MASK] says, pointing to a picture of the young man with a face like a lance and a wide spumy smile that was also a laugh, drenched in spume.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Conor	“If you don’t mind, Sergeant ...” [MASK] pauses to make sure that he is not being insolent, then states his preference, which is to incapacitate her immediately. “Why?” the sergeant asks. “She’s bleeding internally . . .
<name>James</name>	James	James	[MASK] is a lucky man ... Of course your aunt and uncle had a hand in it. . . your husband or your husband-to-be up there playing cards and getting the grad from you.” “Have you seen my husband by any chance?”
<name>Tristan</name>	Tristan	Shep	My husband loved horses and bred them,” she says in her haughtiest accent. “I saw a dog,” he says. “Then I didn’t dream it,” she says, the voice grateful, as if [MASK] had reincarnated and could be a mascot for her.
<name>Bert</name>	Bert	Cassidy	After they have shot two rats, they reckon that the others have scarpered out of fright. [MASK] has had the job to kick the dead ones out with his boot. “I wonder if dogs eat them . . . Fur an’ all.”
<name>John</name>	John	Rory	Sometimes they can tell by the slam of the car door. Sometimes not. [MASK]. He walks into the hall past his wife and towards the lounge, where a tea tray is laid with cups and saucers and scones. “Did you get the fuel for the barbecue?”
<name>him</name>	him	James	and they’d be driven home blotto.” He winked and asked how many days she’d been married now, then nudged her and repeated that a couple of children would make [MASK] happy, tie him down. “You think so,” she said.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Mac	He does not come in. He is not even there. She peers out into the hall where on the bamboo table the artificial tea roses and an Infant of Prague statue unite in shiver. “[MASK],” she calls, but he does not answer.
<name>Matilda</name>	Matilda	Jennifer	“Then fucking steal it . . . Go right in there and hold up the Waltzing [MASK] at the till . . . There’s only her and the guy and our songstress.” “I can’t fucking do that now . . . Not on my own ...
<name>Seamus</name>	Seamus	Padraig	she asks, and for a second he is embarrassed, the thin neat lines on his forehead meshing, as if being scored with a knife. “A young lad . . . came from around here . . . [MASK]. He told me how your husband got killed.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	nly	She got each time, what dirty her and what she would hour or more, she ran again, because just as [MASK] wanted to be active ed cobwebs out of their spleen on them, rapped ciation, then fled to the e animals.
<name>Deirdre</name>	Deirdre	Martin	“[MASK],” she says. “Your phone is up the spout,” he says. Quickly, without even having to think, she says that she was going to report it but that she had a touch of flu.
<name>She</name>	She	Ross	She helped me upstairs. We make our beds and we lie on them, our swamped beds. Mile after mile of it, dualways, tarred roads, dirt roads, then the mountain road not wide enough for two carts to pass. [MASK] hated the countryside.
