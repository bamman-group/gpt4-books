<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Susan	So what is she doing? I know of at least three commissions for drawings that she is working on, and I would bet a year’s salary that she is also writing something.” “Something ridiculously beyond her powers,” [MASK] said. “What?”
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Bessie	For models she had used her sister [MASK] and two Milton girls, and by their tucked-up skirts and mobcaps, and by the scrub bucket visible through the open door, she had meant to suggest that they had escaped from their tedious inside chores and fallen upon the wooden rakes in a spirit of play.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Susan	The station agent’s office was dark. There was not a hack to be found. The waiting room was open, dim, empty, and the stove was cold. [MASK] laid the baby on a bench and tucked his blanket so that he would not roll off.
<name>Adrienne</name>	Adrienne	Susan	Probably [MASK] consoled herself with the thought that she brought at least one good thing home: her baby. Perhaps she also had in some private corner of her mind the satisfaction of knowing that in spite of marriage, motherhood, and economic uncertainty she had not ceased to exist as an artist.
<name>Mr. Cunningham</name>	Mr. Cunningham	Grandfather	“So many kinds, and all out at once.” “Mmm,” [MASK] said around his pipe. “You’ve been working on them. They weren’t like this when I lived here.” “No. I suppose not.”
<name>Dr. Dolittle</name>	Dr. Dolittle	Creation	We can hear all those lost squawks and know that as soon as [MASK] says the right word, they’ll be birds.” “And meantime we’ll all be dead of pleurisy from standing in front of the window. Let’s get back to bed.”
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Oliver	“That’s fine,” [MASK] said. “I’m proud of you. It’s not your success we have to worry about. Meantime it’s my job to support my family. Next time we move I want to have the train fare.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Nellie	[MASK] and I have been trying to keep up his courage and determination with our tales of what wonders he will see, and what fine things he will learn, and what fine men he will study with and what fine boys he will come to know as friends.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Oliver	She said, “Couldn’t you have done something?” “I went to him and protested,” [MASK] said. “He told me my job was to keep the Santa Isabel tunnel going in, he’d take care of the men.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Susan	“Thank you,” said [MASK] furiously. “I’ll think about it.” She gave her attention to a yard where some young people were playing the newly popular game called croquet. Obviously they were trying out a Christmas present.
<name>Benjy</name>	Benjy	Pricey	Even if there had been anything like last summer’s visitors she could not have welcomed them freely to her fire. Over in his corner like the family’s imbecile child [MASK] was always rocking and reading. If visitors did come, he grabbed up the stereopticon and hid behind it, and peeked.
<name>Tess</name>	Tess	Betsy	But she never did. She started. She took poor forlorn little [MASK] away from the Milton farm and steered her toward that new, meager life; but something happened in her head and in her feelings. She winced aside, she refused the jump.
<name>lace</name>	lace	Paisley	She has already fixed it up with pictures and china hens and bits of [MASK] and her mother’s inlaid workbox. Her dressing table is a box set on end and curtained with muslin, her bed is a homemade bunk.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Light	said the man listening ratlike behind the door. “I understood that he had hired you as a secretary,” said [MASK]. That’s right! said the man behind the door. Your mother ran you out the one time you tried to come in!
<name>Ethan</name>	Ethan	Oliver	She turned, her face full of an intense question, to confront [MASK] coming across the dining room. His face was weathered, rugged, and hot. He had pushed back his rancher’s hat on his head, above the red line that circled his forehead.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Oliver	The veranda that she had drawn around three sides of [MASK]’s sketch, and had him spend most of his savings on, was a triumph. It took her breath to look east, it filled her heart to look west or south.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Oliver	“What if he sees you?” “I expect he will.” “But what if he calls you down?” “He’ll only do it once.” “[MASK],” she said earnestly, “why do we even try to stay?”
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Sue	She shook him hard enough to rattle his teeth, furious at the stubborn wordlessness that was so exactly like his father’s. “Didn’t she!” Held away and forced to glance up, he said, “Yes ma’am.” “Why? What for?” “[MASK] ...”
<name>he</name>	he	A1	They flashed around us once, she smiled and slipped into the chair that [MASK] pushed toward her, sitting with her knees together and her hands holding her white summer handbag in her lap. Her skirt was short enough to be fashionable but not so short it looked frivolous.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Elliott	She heard the noise of [MASK] shaking down the kitchen range, and in the dripping stillness that followed, distant bird cries cut through the mutter of the sea. “But not where we were” she said. “Because now there’s a future.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Susan	Sometimes [MASK] had envied her the placid sweetness of her life. She said softly, “Would thee go?” “If it would help him. If it would make him as he used to be.” “Then!”
<name>Carol</name>	Carol	Agnes	She was reading The Birds’ Christmas Carol. The two lay facing different ways, their feet entangled. [MASK], with her wide eyes open and glazed with imagining, kept pulling out strands of silvery hair to arm’s length as if measuring them.
<name>farmers</name>	farmers	Grandmother	We have been conditioned to think of chickens as neatly sorted cellophane packages of breasts, wings, legs, thighs, and necks, without guts or mess, without death. Death and life were everyday matters to [MASK].
<name>Mrs. Hutchinson</name>	Mrs. Hutchinson	Susan	He led her to the foot of the basket. The breeze from the window stirred the baby’s fine pale hair, and [MASK] reached to pull the sash clear down. Outside, though the August sunshine was full and hot, weather was building up.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Rodman	There is a certain endearing innocence about [MASK]—he makes the world’s worst conspirator or gumshoe. It has apparently never occurred to him that he has the loudest voice in the entire world, and that when he wants to be confidential he ought to retreat two miles.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Absently	Two months, maybe more.” “Could I go along?” “I wouldn’t go otherwise.” [MASK] her hand came out and settled on top of his. He was being scrupulous not to influence her, he simply laid out possibilities.
<name>he</name>	he	Oliver	“You know what?” she said, holding the curtains back and watching ahead through the dusty little oaks, “I don’t think you described this place very well.” “Draw your own conclusions,” [MASK] said.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Ollie	But she was too close now to take a room and sleep. She ate something, gave [MASK] some oatmeal and softened toast, cleaned him up, washed her face and hands. At eight thirty they were on their way to the ferry, at a quarter of nine they were aboard.
<name>Oklahoma</name>	Oklahoma	Idaho	She has a rosy color, and none of the bronchial troubles that [MASK]’s dust and wind induced. I am ashamed to bother you, knowing how full your days are, but I am so far from everything, and can think of no other way.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Oliver	She was no novice, had had two children and a miscarriage, and she did not panic. She thought she had a few hours. Depending on whether he took the bluffs road back, or the canyon road, it would take [MASK] three to four hours to return.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Shelly	It is true I used to be pulled out by classes, meetings, examinations, visitors, trips to the library, and a lot else. My afternoons used to have more in them than eight laps on the crutches and a little conversation with [MASK] or her mother.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Oliver	“I mentioned it twice.” “But he never paid you.” “Not yet.” “He never will!” she cried into the wind. “Oh, [MASK], why must it always be you who gets cheated?” He seemed amused.
<name>John</name>	John	Oliver	For the first time I understood [MASK]’s enthusiasm. We went softly on that sandy trail among the sage, and that dry magical wind from the west blew across us, until at last we came out on a long bench above a river valley, with mountains close behind patched with snow and forest.
<name>George</name>	George	Ed	The sprinkler was going down on the lawn where [MASK] had set it when he came back from his tire shop—one of those golf-course sprinklers with a kicker bar and a pulse like the panting of a hard-run dog, a comfortable afternoon sound.
<name>Herbert</name>	Herbert	Oliver	She looked for a moment or two into his shrewd light-lashed eyes. She liked him. Perhaps one day he would be [MASK]’s collaborator. She might be entertaining him at dinners when he came down to consult, or to make periodic inspections.
<name>Anton</name>	Anton	Grandmother	What held him and [MASK] together for more than sixty years? Passion? Integrity? Culture? Convention? Inviolability of contract? Notions of possession? By some standards they weren’t even married, they just had a paper signed by some witnesses.
<name>Mr. West</name>	Mr. West	Oliver	If he were alive, I should have more hope. Now funds are cut off, the contractors are unpaid and angry, [MASK] and the juniors are unpaid and apprehensive, the ditch is stopped at the three-mile mark—the ditch which was to extend for seventy-five miles.
<name>The baby</name>	The baby	Betsy	She remembered him standing above the basket of his three-week-old daughter and declaring himself as confident of success as she was that the baby could be brought up to be a woman. [MASK] was now a month past her second birthday.
<name>James</name>	James	Oliver	“But you mustn’t.” “Easier said than done. You know how I feel about [MASK], too.” “He feels the same. There’s nobody he trusts more.” The laugh that came out of him struck her ear unpleasantly.
<name>Ignatius</name>	Ignatius	Pop	“I didn’t ask.” “[MASK]...” I take the hand that he mashed in greeting me, and work the knuckles with the fingers of my other hand. I can feel the bone hard and resistant and enlarged.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Emma	“[MASK] flatters me.” He had not once smiled. Now he laid a hand on the doorknob. “No, really. If you don’t go back to work I’ll have to leave. I don’t want to disturb you.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Oliver	She could have taken his head against her breast and rocked him and told him never mind, never mind, it’s not your fault, you did all you could, it’s the way this brutal place is. “I hope you don’t mind,” [MASK] said.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Frank	“Happy family,” [MASK] said. His eyes shifted, and she became aware, with acute embarrassment, that he was looking directly at her swollen belly. “Increased by one,” he said. The blood spread quick and hot into her face.
<name>someone</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	someone (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	Nellie	Once more they met at the steps of a transcontinental train. They were both watchful and restrained; the presence of [MASK] and the children kept their reunion from being too personal; any diffidence in his greeting of her could be covered up in the exuberance of greeting his children.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ollie	“You cold, boy? Want a blanket, or are you ready for bed?” [MASK] made no answer. “Hey,” his father said, “you shivering. It’s not that cold.”
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Susan	“How can I say?” [MASK] said. “There are wonderful pictures, if one had the skill. I’m afraid they’re beyond me. But I wouldn’t have missed it, not for anything.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Susan	At the word “wife,” [MASK] felt the clerk’s eyes again, like the flick of a moth’s wing against her face. For the first time it occurred to her what the clerk thought she was, and in a chilly passion she said, “Is there no other hotel?
<name>Aunt Alexandra</name>	Aunt Alexandra	Grandfather	But she only shook her head at me, hurriedly, as if embarrassed or annoyed, and bent her nose to her talisman bud and went on into the house. I thought she was a little crazy. Why should [MASK], who would putter all afternoon on one rose bush, pull up a whole garden?
<name>Matthew</name>	Matthew	Theeing	“Thee mustn’t doubt it.” “[MASK]?” he said. “Now I know I’m one of the family.” A shiver went through her from her hips up to her shoulders. At once he was solicitous. “Cold?”
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Frank	Why don’t we quit?” A little laugh was jolted out of him. He looked first out the window and then into his hands, as if in search of something that would catch his eye. “[MASK] would feel terrible, for one thing.
<name>me</name>	me	Thomas	There has been a considerable land boom already, and the land office is doing—I just realized where the phrase comes from—a land-office business. Oh, couldn’t you and [MASK] homestead a claim and lay the foundations for a western place of visitation?
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Oliver	“Recipe for rabbit pie,” he said. “First catch rabbit.” “[MASK], I’m absolutely sure thee can do it!” “And while chasing rabbits, find some way to support family.” “The family can support itself.”
<name>Gilbert</name>	Gilbert	Oliver	The left wheels reared up, climbed, crashed down, climbed again; the buggy tilted so steeply that she hung on in frantic fear of sliding straight off under the hoofs and wheels. [MASK]’s hand shot out and grabbed her.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Shelly	Why put them down?” “Look, [MASK],” I said, “I didn’t start this discussion. It doesn’t make that much difference to me what they do. You asked me what I thought.” “I’d really like to know.”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Augusta	He’s not flashy, he’ll take a little while to establish himself. I can go on drawing. He wants me to.” “In some mining camp.” “I don’t know where.” Now [MASK]’s agitation broke out.
<name>God</name>	God	John	Help you, he says! Help you spend your paycheck! With that band around his head and them moccasins and some kind of purple pants. I wanted to stick a feather in his hair and make a real Indian of him. Honest to [MASK], how you ever...”
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Oliver	Who would have thought that the prospect of leaving this place could make me want to weep! [MASK] takes it far better than I, though the hard work and the disappointment were mainly his. End of dream number one, which was her dream, not his.
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Simpson	Whateffer you wish, command.” His pale pop eyes crawled on her like slugs. She smelled the pomatum on his hair. “Thank you,” she said. “You’re very kind,” and moved her eyes to [MASK], coming up.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Ollie	“Turtles can’t sing,” [MASK] said. Languid after his afternoon in the sun, he leaned inside his father’s knees and picked at the broad gold wedding ring on the hand that loosely held him there. The sun in that one afternoon had turned him pink.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ollie	With [MASK]’s sleeping head in her lap and a down comforter around them both, she tried now and then to get a look at that celebrated scenic wonder, but the gorge was only snow-streaked rock indistinguishable from any other rock, all its height and grandeur and pictorial organization obliterated in storm.
<name>Maxwell</name>	Maxwell	Oliver	They would trade evenings, their children would be inseparable. Of course it would take a little time. [MASK] wrote that he had found a cottage, once inhabited by a mine captain’s family, which with renovations would make them a pleasant and secluded home.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Ellen	“But she lived a long time after that,” [MASK] said. “She lived to be ninety-one. My grandfather lived to be eighty-nine. She had practically no time to be senile and alone.” “But she wasn’t happy.”
<name>Sebastian</name>	Sebastian	Susan	“[MASK].” His shadow moved, his boot hit the tiles, he reached a long arm. His fingers closed around her bare foot. Touch. It is touch that is the deadliest enemy of chastity, loyalty, monogamy, gentility with its codes and conventions and restraints.
<name>the driver</name>	the driver	Eugene	They were going right through the Hacienda at a trot. Some children scattered, turning to stare. A woman looked out a door. “Aren’t we stopping here?” she asked. “I slipped [MASK] a little extra to deliver you right to your gate.”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Ollie	The face looked down at him seriously. The hand was so heavy on his shoulder that he had to brace himself to stand straight under it. As if testing the resistance it invoked, the hand left the shoulder and fitted itself around the back of [MASK]’s neck.
<name>John</name>	John	Chepe	It’s not the way we planned it.” She would not let him blame himself, she shook her head with her face against his chest. “Thee couldn’t have done anything else.” “I could have done what [MASK]’s doing.”
<name>Vladimir</name>	Vladimir	Susan	Did [MASK], pushing away the misery of their parting, or whatever it was, stand up at some point, looking anxiously around in the growing dusk, on that bench like a great empty stage, under that sky beginning to show the first weak stars, and call out, and have no answer?
<name>Dumbledore</name>	Dumbledore	Lyman	His mouth opened, and sure enough, there was the old wart on the end of his tongue. It pulled in and hid behind his lower teeth, it crept out again and lay slyly between his lips. “Thun of a bith!” he said. “[MASK]!”
<name>Mother</name>	Mother	Susan	He watched his father come out with the gun belt and six shooter and buckle it around him. So did [MASK]. “Oh my dear!” she said. “Where is thee going?” “No reason to worry.
<name>Mattie</name>	Mattie	Lizzie	The hammock she had given up weeks ago; she could not have got out of it if she had got in. [MASK]’s noises in the kitchen, and a banging that was probably Buster among the stovewood, might have been the sounds from her mother’s kitchen.
<name>Grandfather</name>	Grandfather	Leadville	The fan and the parasol went quickly, the mat lasted until [MASK] and was mourned when it passed, the olla has come through three generations of us, as have the bowie, the spurs, and the six-shooter.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Oliver	He too? Oh, good. I didn’t know he’d come back.” She continued to look at the moving dust, since that kept her from having to look at [MASK]. “After he invested three years in this ditch?”
<name>husband</name>	husband	Bessie	Phantasmal adjustments to the road lurked in her muscles. It seemed a week since she had awakened in the berth and pulled the curtains to see dawn on the peaks of these mountains. It seemed a month since she had embraced her parents and [MASK] and kissed her son’s sleeping face.
<name>she</name>	she	Oliver	“I remember now. You put them on the desk and said they were one thing, at least, you didn’t have to take care of now. You recall telling me that.” “No,” [MASK] said. “I remember nothing of the kind.
<name>him</name>	him	Rodman	If I spoke to [MASK] in those terms, saying that my grandparents’ lives seem to me organic and ours what? hydroponic? he would ask in derision what I meant. Define my terms. How do you measure the organic residue of a man or a generation?
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Oliver	Morning, then. Oh, good! A bumblebee buzzed in, crawled around on the cretonne flowers of the curtains, and buzzed out again. [MASK] was watching her with a slow, amused, memorizing look; she knew that he had been watching her sleep.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Shelly	“Well, I’m sorry" [MASK] said. She looked me in the eye, she almost winked, there was a secret little smirk on her face. She pushed her shoulder away from the jamb and turned and slip-slopped across the bare study floor.
<name>Uncle Jack</name>	Uncle Jack	Oliver	Now [MASK]. Not only did he not feel his own awkwardness, she saw, but he was enormously tickled by the whole circus. He took her hand with formality, as if just being introduced, and shook it up and down.
<name>Brett</name>	Brett	Dully	[MASK] she said to the bowie and horse pistol and spurs, “But you were fond of her too.” “I loved her. She was a lady.” “A lady who made a terrible mistake.” “And recognized it,” I said.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Oliver	Out on the piazza she sat in the hammock and looked out over the green and gold mountain and thought how strange, how strange. Rocks clattered in the trail, and [MASK] came in sight with a great black dog padding beside him.
<name>Sheriff</name>	Sheriff	Oliver	“Tell us,” she said. He looked at [MASK] one last time for confirmation or authority. “They, ah, just hanged a couple of men. Out in front of the jail.” She heard him with a surprising absence of surprise.
<name>Beth</name>	Beth	Emelita	“He watches himself being courteous. With admiration.” “I can take you back to the hotel.” “You just try! I love [MASK]. She has the kind of face you can only get by devoting yourself to others.
<name>Christopher</name>	Christopher	Ollie	“Terribly.” “You too.” Shrug. “All of us.” They rested, getting their breath. He said, “I’m anxious to see [MASK]. He must be a big boy by now.” “Big and silent.
<name>farmers</name>	farmers	John	“Suppose I wasn’t,” she said. “What would you do?” It took him a few seconds. Then he answered steadily, “Stay here, I suppose. Get some sort of job. Pick apples. Hire out to [MASK].”
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name in the given context)	Unknown (There is no proper name in the given context)	Pricey	“Lithospermum multiflorum.” “What?” She stared at him, jolted into laughter that was half hysterical. “How did you know that?” [MASK] was confused. He stammered and shrugged, searching her face as if the answer might be there.
<name>Victorian</name>	Victorian	Grandma	Suppose four or five fellows banged this girl while everybody else watched. Would that seem crude to you, or dirty, or immoral, or something?” “I’d have to say we’d come a long way from [MASK].” She laughed, this lady missionary.
<name>Thoreau</name>	Thoreau	Grandmother	You believe in it more thah [MASK] did. As for those purely cultural patterns of convention you think I ought to escape from, they happen to add up to civilization, and I’d rather be civilized than tribal or uncouth.” She is not utterly insensitive.
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Lizzie	In the last two hours it had been through every expression from [MASK]’s native stoniness to a horrible leer, and it was now rubbed out for the fourth or fifth time. She did not feel like drawing, but felt she must.
<name>Biff</name>	Biff	Rodman	She’d been better off if she’d stayed right here and gone to secretarial school and got a job here at home. Well, I have no confused young to look after. [MASK] takes care of himself, I’ll give him that.
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Lizzie	Yet the one small doubt stuck in her mind like a burr in tweed. In a small voice she said, “You’ll spoil me.” “I hope so.” [MASK] came in with luggage in one hand and the baby in her other arm.
<name>Leonardo</name>	Leonardo	Grandmother	I responded slowly, for I guessed who it was: his thumb gave him away. I had been expecting his visit, and fearing it. Also I had been working peacefully and disliked being disturbed. I love this old studio of [MASK]’s.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Augusta	I think, don’t you, that a girl with any delicacy of feeling couldn’t bring herself to marry a man indirectly responsible for her father’s death. No matter how much she was in love with him.” “An unhappy ending?” [MASK] said.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Augusta	Yet it left her out. In bitter moods she may have wondered if he chose [MASK] because she was wealthy and well-born and could give him a social base for his career. I suppose she wept for lost gladness and the relinquishment of true friends.
<name>John</name>	John	Oliver	[MASK], sitting with his hands braced on his knees, looked altogether too vigorous and untired. He had evidently been keeping silent for her sake, not because he himself felt this jolting, dust-choked, endless ride a hardship. “Are you disappointed?”
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Oliver	she said to him, low-voiced. [MASK] looked surprised. “Where else could I take him?” “But my bedroom!” He looked at her, frowning. The mulish look was gathering in his face, but she was too annoyed to care.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Oliver	[MASK] feels he cannot leave the Survey until he has completed the field work and written his report, which will take the rest of the year, perhaps longer. Isn’t it provoking that having held himself ready for so long, he should now be prevented from plunging into the canal as he wants to!
<name>he</name>	he	Frank	The kids enjoyed them. We didn’t go clear in, we watched from the road.” “I was hoping you would.” “Couldn’t you see them from here?” “Pretty well.” “What did [MASK] want5” “What?
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Susan	“Will he come home for the birth?” “I don’t want him to unless he’s found what he wants.” “But when he does find it, he’ll send for you and you’ll go.” [MASK] took a breath.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Tregoning	He makes examples of a few to scare the rest. Last week he fired two Mexican construction workers for walking a hundred feet off the job to hang their lunch pails in the shade. Day before yesterday he fired [MASK], the hoist man at the Kendall shaft.”
<name>him</name>	him	Larry	“Can you manage?” “Of course.” “I know you don’t think I should go live with [MASK] in his commune.” Live with half a dozen fellows in their commune, I felt like saying. Be on service to the community.
