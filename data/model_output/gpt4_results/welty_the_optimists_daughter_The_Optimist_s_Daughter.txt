<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Fay	Both his eyes were bandaged. Sandbags were packed about his head, the linen pinned across the big motionless mound of his body close enough to bind him. “You didn’t tell me he’d look like that,” said [MASK].
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Fay	“If all you want to do is rub the skin off your bones.” “The scars it’s got are a different matter. But I’d work.” “And do what with it when you got through?” [MASK] said mockingly.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Laurel	[MASK] became aware that he was in evening clothes. At the elevator he got in with them, still standing between them. “Maybe we asked too much of him,” he said grudgingly. “And yet he didn’t have to hold out much longer.”
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Laurel	[MASK] faced the library. This was where, after his retirement and marriage, her father had moved everything he wanted around him from his office in the Mount Salus Bank Building on the Square. Perhaps a crowded room, whatever is added, always looks the same.
<name>even</name>	even	M	Whatever she was driven to say was all right. But it was not all right! Her trouble was that very desperation. And no one had the power to cause that except the one she desperately loved, who refused to [MASK] consider that she was desperate.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Laurel	[MASK] had been taken “up home” since a summer before she remembered. The house was built on top of what might as well have been already the highest roof in the world. There were rocking chairs outside it on the sweet, roofless green grass.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Phil	She grew up in the kind of shynessthat takes its refuge in giving refuge. Until she knew [MASK], she thought of love as shelter; her arms went out as a naive offer of safety. He had showed her that this need not be so.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Laurel	His fly had not been buttoned up quite straight. [MASK] thought he had never been in the house before except to tune the piano, ages ago. He sat down on the same stool now. “And under that cloak of modesty he wore, a fearless man!
<name>Tallulah</name>	Tallulah	Dot	To everyone in town, she was known simply as [MASK]. She came in with her nonchalant, twenties stalk on her high heels. “I couldn’t resist,” she said in her throaty baritone as she approached the coffin. She must have been seventy.
<name>Four</name>	Four	Phil	She wept for what happened to life. “I wanted it!” [MASK] cried. His voice rose with the wind in the night and went around the house and around the house. It became a roar. “I wanted it!” Four
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Lucifer	“[MASK]!” she cried. “Liar!” That was when he started, of course, being what he scowlingly called an optimist; he might have dredged the word up out of his childhood. He loved his wife.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Laurel	“You what? You what?" “I wanted him to get up out of there, and start him paying a little attention to me, for a change.” “He was dying,” said [MASK]. “He was paying full attention to that.”
<name>Tim</name>	Tim	Father’ll	She decided to put off the other necessary calls. “[MASK] need all the time both of us can give him. He’s not very well suited to being tied down.” “O.K., that’s not a matter of life and death, is it?”
<name>Mobile</name>	Mobile	Bigbee	The pecan tree there was filled with budding leaves like green bees spaced out in a hive of light. There was something bright as well in the old man’s hatband—the other half of his round-trip ticket from [MASK].
<name>Dorothy</name>	Dorothy	Laurel	In the back of the pigeonhole where these letters came from was some solid little object, and [MASK] drew it out, her fingers remembering it before she held it under her eyes. It was a two-inch bit of slatey stone, given shape by many little strokes from a penknife.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Laurel	[MASK]’s own mother, after her sight was gone, lay in bed in the big room reciting to herself sometimes as she had done on horseback at sixteen to make the long ride over the mountain go faster. She did not like being read to, she preferred to do the reading, she said now.
<name>Selina</name>	Selina	Laurel	In her need tonight [MASK] would have been willing to wish her mother and father dragged back to any torment of living because that torment was something they had known together, through each other. She wanted them with her to share her grief as she had been the sharer of theirs.
<name>Mathilde</name>	Mathilde	Laurel	She had died without speaking a word, keeping everything to herself, in exile and humiliation. /To [MASK] while she still knew her, she had made a last remark: “You could have saved your mother’s life. But you stood by and wouldn’t intervene.
<name>Wendell</name>	Wendell	Fay	She had been ready to hurt [MASK]. She had wanted to hurt her, and had known herself capable of doing it. But such is the strangeness of the mind, it had been the memory of the child Wendell that had prevented her.
<name>Mrs. Givens</name>	Mrs. Givens	Fay	His chances are a hundred to one against.” “Go on in yonder, scare-cat,” ordered the mother. “They went in my husband’s eye without consulting my feelings and next they try to run me out of this hospital!” cried [MASK].
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Laurel	“What makes you think I’ll let you? What’s made you so brazen all at once ?” “Finding the breadboard!” [MASK] cried. She placed both hands down on it and gave it the weight of her body.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Fay	The Optimifl’s Daughter sound, a snore, and firmed his mouth. He asked, “What’s the time, [MASK]?” “That sounds more like you,” she said, but didn’t tell him the time.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Laurel	“You got a lot of fat squirrels going to waste here,” the old man said, bending down to [MASK], and she was unprepared for it when he kissed her goodbye. At last they were in the truck, rolling down the driveway to the street.
<name>Enrico</name>	Enrico	Laurel	Then she cried out again, the longing, or the anger, of her whole life all in her voice at one time, “Is it the Carnival ?” [MASK] heard a band playing and another band moving in on top of it.
<name>She</name>	She	Laurel	There was no key in either keyhole of the double doors of the cabinet. But had there ever been a key? Her mother had never locked up anything that [MASK] could remember. Her privacy was keyless. She had simply assumed her privacy.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Fay	The days of the train itself were numbered now. In the last car, the two women lay back in chairs in their compartment partitioned off from the observation section behind. [MASK] had kicked off her shoes. She lay with her head turned away, not speaking.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Laurel	A flood of feeling descended on [MASK]. She let the papers slide from her hand and the books from her knees, and put her head down on the open lid of the desk and wept in grief for love and for the dead.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Laurel	[MASK] said. “Well, I won’t charge you nothing,” he said, clattering down the stairs behind her. “I don’t see nothing wrong with you,” he added. “Why didn’t you ever go ’head and marry you another somebody?”
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Fay	“You desecrated this house.” “I don’t know what that word means, and glad I don’t. But I’ll have you remember it’s my house now, and I can do what I want to with it,” [MASK] said.
<name>Eurydice</name>	Eurydice	Phil	Left bodiless and graveless of a death made of water and fire in a year long gone, [MASK] could still tell her of her life. For her life, any life, she had to believe, was nothing but the continuity of its love.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Laurel	Perhaps she was forty, and so younger than [MASK]. There was little even of forty in her looks except the line of her neck and the backs of her little square, idle hands. She was bony and blue-veined; as a child she had very possibly gone undernourished.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Fay	It’s a few minutes before ten o’clock. There’ll be callers downstairs, asking for you.” [MASK] pushed herself up on her arms and cried over her shoulder, “I’m the widow! They can all wait till I get there.”
<name>Briony</name>	Briony	Laurel	When [MASK] was a child, in this room and in this bed where she lay now, she closed her eyes like this and the rhythmic, nighttime sound of the two beloved reading voices came rising in turn up the stairs every night to reach her.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Fay	“And a dining room table that might keep you from going to bed hungry.” “Well, I didn’t know I was giving a reception,” said [MASK]. She came as far as the dining room doors and stared in.
<name>MASK</name>	MASK	Laurel	He bent over and stared in, without speaking. He knocked back the sheet and laid the side of his head against her father’s gowned chest; for a moment his own eyes closed. It was her father who appeared to [MASK] as the one listening.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Laurel	It never came. 2 At the inevitable hour, [MASK] started from her bed and went downstairs in her dressing gown. It was a clear, bright seven o’clock, with morning shadows dappling the shine of the floors and the dining room table.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Phil	Four She had slept in the chair, like a passenger who had come on an emergency journey in a train. But she had rested deeply. She had dreamed that she was a passenger, and riding with [MASK]. They had ridden together over a long bridge.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Laurel	With the hammer.” “And cigarette burns—” “Who wants an everlasting breadboard ? It’s the last thing on earth anybody needs!” “And there—along the edge!” With a finger that was trembling now, [MASK] drew along it.
<name>she</name>	she	Laurel	Pity stabbed her. Did they move too fast for him now ? Part of her father’s silence [MASK] laid, at first, to the delicacy he had always shown in family feelings. (There had only been the three of them.)
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Laurel	A screen of florist’s ferns was being built up before her eyes behind the coffin. Then a man stepped out from behind the green and presented a full, square face with its small features pulled to the center—what [MASK]’s mother had called “a Baptist face.”
<name>She</name>	She	Fay	There were vermilion drops of hardened stuff on the dark wood—not sealing wax; nail polish. They made a little track toward the chair, as if [MASK] had walked her fingers over the desk from where she’d sat perched on its corner, doing her nails.
<name>Granny</name>	Granny	Fay	“But first, me and you need to have a little meeting of the minds in a quiet, dignified place where you can be given the opportunity—” “You bet your boots,” said [MASK]. The hearse pulled away, then.
<name>Emmie</name>	Emmie	Fay	“You bet I’m staying! Just wait till he hears what I’ve got to say to him!” cried [MASK]. “You pore little woman,” said the old woman easily. “Don’t they give us all a hard time.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Laurel	Her sobbing, the same two close-together, accusing notes running over and over, went on for a time against the thin sounding-board between the two beds. [MASK] lay in the dark waiting for it to reach its end.
<name>She</name>	She	Laurel	But of course the last door on the right of the corridor, the one standing partway open as usual, was still her father’s. An intense, tight little voice from inside there said at that moment in high pitch, “I tell you enough is enough!” [MASK] was halted.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Fay	For [MASK] was without any powers of passion or imagination in herself and had no way to see it or reach it in the other person. Other people, inside their lives, might as well be invisible to her.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Phil	[MASK] had learned everything he could manage to learn, and done as much as he had time for, to design houses to stand, to last, to be lived in; but he had known they could equally well, with the same devotion and tireless effort, be built of cards.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Laurel	Here, helpless in his own house among the people he’d known, and who’d known him, since the beginning, her father seemed to [MASK] to have reached at this moment the danger point of his life. “Did you listen to their words ?”
<name>Granny</name>	Granny	Laurel	“But I don’t think it’s fair now'' said [MASK]. “Well, that backed ’em right out of there, the whole pack, right on out of town and back into the woods they came from. Cooked their goose for a while!”
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Fay	“Eating a lot of fresh vegetables, and so forth.” “Well, at least my family’s not hypocrites,” said [MASK]. “If they didn’t want me, they’d tell me to my face.” “When you coming back?”
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Missouri	She heard it somewhere, ticking. “He on the telephone.” “Oh, don’t hit—” “How’m I gonna git him, then? Look,” said [MASK]. “He ain’t got no business in your room.”
<name>Constance</name>	Constance	Laurel	When she didn’t speak, he went on, “May we have him in our parlor? Or would you prefer him to repose at the residence ?” “My father ? Why—at his home,” said [MASK], stammering. “At the residence.
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Laurel	She shut the shivering glass door gently, so as not to rock the old top-heavy cabinet. “People live their own way, and to a certain extent I almost believe they may die their own way, [MASK].”
<name>Francis</name>	Francis	Wendell	“I don’t want to,” said [MASK]. “What you scared of? Nothing’s going to bite you upstairs. Go hunt her,” said his father. “I don’t want to.”
<name>Francie</name>	Francie	Fay	[MASK] cried, “I don’t even mind standing up in the back and riding with the children!” She whirled and ran upstairs. “You’ll wind up riding on my lap,” said her mother. “I know you.”
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	Fay	“The renegade! I believe he’s just plain sneaked out on us.” In the waiting room, [MASK] stood being patted by an old woman who was wearing bedroom slippers and holding a half-eaten banana in her free hand.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Laurel	She was wearing her best—of course, she’d arranged not to teach her children today. She offered [MASK] a double-handful of daffodils, the nodding, gray-white kind with the square cup. “You know who gave me mine—hers are blooming outside.
<name>Moths</name>	Moths	Birds	“He ain’t got no business in your room.” “Just move behind it. [MASK] fly toward light—I’m sure I’ve been told. Here—I’m holding the front door wide open for it.”
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Laurel	Books, folders, file boxes were shelved with markers and tapes hanging out. Along the cabinet top his telescope was propped extended, like a small brass cannon. [MASK] slid back the glass doors and began to dust and put back neatly what she came to.
<name>Augustus</name>	Augustus	Clinton	“I have just come in. [MASK] is still toiling. I see him now from my kitchen window, struggling with the Mermaid rose.” “That fool fig tree is already putting out leaves. Will it never learn?”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Bubba	“I just finished seeing him,” [MASK] said. “I couldn’t help but think he’s young-looking for a man pushing seventy-one.” “That’s right. Not a bit wasted.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Fay	The scene she had just imagined, herself confiding the abuse to her mother, and confiding it in all tenderness, was a more devastating one than all [MASK] had acted out in the hospital. What would I not do, perpetrate, she wondered, for consolation ?
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Laurel	“Why do you persist in letting them hurt me?” her mother would ask him. [MASK] battled against them both, each for the other’s sake. She loyally reproached her mother for yielding to the storms that began coming to her out of her darkness of vision.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Fay	“When I get ready.” The clock struck for half-past twelve. “Oh, how I hate that old striking clock!” cried [MASK]. “It’s the first thing I’m going to get rid of.”
<name>Francie</name>	Francie	Becky	[MASK]’s own father had been a lawyer, too. But the mountain had stood five times as high as the courthouse roof, straight up behind it, and the river went rushing in front of it like a road. It was its only road.
<name>Francie</name>	Francie	Laurel	“Shut up. Or I’ll carry you on home without letting you see the rest of it.” “It’s my father,” [MASK] said. The little boy looked at her, and his mouth opened. She thought he disbelieved her.
<name>Levy</name>	Levy	Courtland	She gave him his breakfast; while she fed him she could read him the Picayune. Then while he was being washed and shaved she went to her own breakfast in the basement cafeteria. The trick was not to miss the lightning visits__a£_Pr. [MASK].
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	Fay	Guess how long they’ve held us here!” cried [MASK]. “If they don’t give your dad no water by next time round, tell you what, we’ll go in there all together and pour it down him,” promised the old mother.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Laurel	“Breadboard?” [MASK] rose and carried it to the middle of the room and set it on the table. She pointed. “Look. Look where the surface is splintered—look at those gouges. You might have gone at it with an icepick.”
<name>She</name>	She	Fay	“Southern Bar Association.” With both arms he had made an expansive gesture that she correctly read as the old Gulf Coast Hotel. [MASK] had had a part-time job there; she was in the typist pool.
<name>Prue</name>	Prue	Laurel	“Thought you were due to be gone!” “I am, just about!” called [MASK], and opened the baskets. Something struck her face—not feathers; it was a blow of wind. The bird was away.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Laurel	The original wooden one [MASK] had somehow passed over in her work, as forgetfully as she’d left her own window open to the rain. She advanced on it, tugged at the wooden doors until they gave. She opened them and got the earnest smell of mouse.
<name>Elara</name>	Elara	Fay	“Putting your eyes out, too? I told him if he hadn’t spent so many years of his life poring over dusty old books, his eyes would have more strength saved up for now,” [MASK] told her. She sidled closer to the bed.
<name>she</name>	she	Fay	The house took longer than [MASK] did to go to sleep; the city longer than the house. Eventually she heard the ludicrous sound of chirping frogs emerge from the now completed excavation next door. Toward morning there was the final, parting shot of a pistol fired far off.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Laurel	[MASK] thought—coming here, sewing and making up tales or remembering all wrong what she saw and heard. A cold life she had lived by the day in other people’s houses. But it had been warm here, warm then.
<name>Mac</name>	Mac	Fay	If we can make it stick, he’s going to have a little vision he didn’t think was coming to him! That’s a beautiful eye.” “But loo\ at him,” said [MASK]. “When’s he going to come to ?”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Fay	And everybody had already forgotten all about that part of his life, his work, his drudgery. This town deserved him no more than [MASK] deserved him, she thought, her finger in the dust on what he’d written.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Laurel	And that eye’s clearing. I think he’s got some vision coming, just a little bit around the edge, you know, [MASK], but if the cataract catches up with him, I want him seeing enough to find his way around the garden.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Laurel	She closed the door behind her. She was carrying a hamper. She pretended not to see them as she drummed past on her heels. [MASK] felt the Doctor’s hand shift to grip her arm; she had been about to go straight to the unattended.
<name>McCarthy</name>	McCarthy	Laurel	“Stop,” said [MASK]. “It was the little bell off her table. She told him she deliberately aimed at his knee, because she didn’t have a wish to hurt any living creature. She was a crazy and you’ll be a crazy too, if you don’t watch out.”
<name>Boy</name>	Boy	Honey	Another family had come in, grouping themselves around the Coke machine. The man who was working it called out, “He shot hisself or somebody shot him, one. He begged for water. The hospital wouldn’t give him none. [MASK], he died wanting water.”
<name>Doctor</name>	Doctor	Laurel	“[MASK], no time to lose.” He closed the door on her. But in the hall, she heard him give an answer to the nurse. “The renegade! I believe he’s just plain sneaked out on us.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Fay	And when it concerned her mother, if that was what she asked for, he went. But there was nothing of her mother here for [MASK] to find, or for herself to retrieve. The only traces there were of anybody were the drops of nail varnish.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Laurel	“Did you listen to their words ?” she asked. “They’re being clumsy. Often because they were thinking of you.” “They said he was a humorist. And a crusader. And an angel on the face of the earth,” [MASK] said.
<name>Wendell</name>	Wendell	Fay	But such is the strangeness of the mind, it had been the memory of the child Wendell that had prevented her. “I don’t know what you’re making such a big fuss over. What do you see in that thing?” asked [MASK].
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Fay	Nobody told me this was what was going to happen to me!” [MASK] cried before she slammed her door. Her sobbing, the same two close-together, accusing notes running over and over, went on for a time against the thin sounding-board between the two beds.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Laurel	She had simply assumed her privacy. Now, suppose that again she would find everything was gone ? [MASK] had hesitated coming to open her father’s desk; she was not hesitating here—not now. She touched the doors where they met, and they swung open together.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Laurel	They’d had such a long married life that she could make a pronouncement sound more military than he could, and even more legal. [MASK] hugged them both, and then said she intended to walk home. “Walk!” “It’s raining!”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Adele	“The way they set off and left it to come back to—I won’t describe the way [MASK] and I found it.” “Their bed wasn’t made,” suggested the minister’s wife. “Well, if she made him happy.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Missouri	It was a clear, bright seven o’clock, with morning shadows dappling the shine of the floors and the dining room table. And there was [MASK], standing in her hat and coat in the middle of the kitchen.
<name>John</name>	John	Philip	That was understandable. The only photograph here now was of herself and [MASK] running down the steps of the Mount Salus Presbyterian Church after their wedding. Her father had given it a silver frame. (So had she.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Laurel	To find them, she could only strike out those little fists at random, or spit from her little mouth. She could no more fight a feeling person than she could love him. “T believe you underestimate everybody on earth,” [MASK] said.
<name>Dean</name>	Dean	Wendell	They tore across the grass, all red and gold, back to their waiting jalopy. [MASK] ran at their heels. In the road he found his truck. He climbed into the back of it and threw himself down on the floor and lay flat.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Laurel	Set deep in the swamp, where the black trees were welling with buds like red drops, was one low beech that had kept its last year’s leaves, and it appeared to [MASK] to travel along with their train, gliding at a magic speed through the cypresses they left behind.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Clint	“[MASK]’s hunting a witness, some of the usual trouble, and this Negro girl says, ‘It’s him and me that saw it. He’s a witness, and I’s a got-shot witness.’ ” They laughed.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Fay	(There had only been the three of them.) Here was his daughter, come to help him and yet wrenched into idleness; she could not help him. [MASK] was accurate about it: any stranger could tell him the time.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Laurel	[MASK] could see the peppering of red road dust on the old man’s hat above his round blue eyes. “This is too strong a light for my father, I’m afraid, sir,” she said to him.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Becky	He could not by then have told the doctors for himself; he was in delirium. It turned out that he had suffered a ruptured appendix. Two doctors came out of the operating room, to where [MASK] stood waiting in the hall.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Laurel	“What’s the matter with that woman? Does she want to ruin your eye?” At last her legs drove her. [MASK] ran. The door stood wide open, and inside the room’s darkness a watery constellation hung, throbbing and near.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Laurel	They walked about, opalescent and solid, on worm-pink feet, each bird marked a little differently from the rest and each with a voice soft as a person’s. [MASK] had stood panic-stricken, holding a biscuit in a frozen gesture of appeal.
