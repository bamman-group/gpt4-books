<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Ngozi	You’re a good girl, I know.’ [MASK] looks at him in silence. His empty words ring in her ears. ‘Look, I have to go now but once it’s all sorted, I’ll pay the hospital and the school fees.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Michael	Bring the package back to base. We can sort it out tonight.’ That evening, [MASK] gets out of the car with the package under his left arm, and with the other feels for his cigarettes in his shirt and tracksuit trouser pockets.
<name>Mr. Freeman</name>	Mr. Freeman	Ben	And as she went out the front door she felt something trickle down her leg to her ankle. She stood on the doorstep, looked down, lifted her skirt slightly, to see a thin line of blood, then turned back to look at [MASK]’s wife.
<name>Bali</name>	Bali	Ngozi	And yet? Well, maybe, it’s the drug called exchange which turns his head. Here he lives a life richer than he ever could back home in the Glaswegian tenement block where he was brought up. Or maybe . . . it’s [MASK].
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Ngozi	The colour is a little faded, but [MASK]’s eyes glaze and begin to sparkle. She touches the velvet, spreads her fingers, glides them over its softness, smiles, looks at her reflection and turns right, then left.
<name>me</name>	me	Tom	‘I only saw him yesterday. He came round to talk to [MASK] about rearranging times. He was full of it. Laughing and joking about taking a holiday.’ ‘What times?’ ‘I don’t know.
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Beverly	It’s a fact: [MASK] is boring. He finishes working on the toilet. He eyes her properly as he comes down the stairs and for the first time sees the sharpness in her face, the tight way she holds her body. A man could cut himself on her.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Michael	[MASK] makes his way to the far end, past the sandwich shops and the entrances to platforms five to twenty. At the counter he hands over the ticket. The assistant returns with a navy carryall, clutching it tightly due to its five kilos of weight.
<name>Father</name>	Father	Simon	The voices grew louder, angrier, as she drew closer. Then she heard her mother scream. She ran towards the bedroom and pushed the door wide open. There he was, [MASK], standing over her. The big butcher’s knife in his hand.
<name>Tula</name>	Tula	Wind	We fell in love, [MASK] and I. It was a surprise to me, as big a surprise as when he walked back into my life bringing supplies for the maroons during the slave revolts.We carried the supplies on our heads up into the mountains.
<name>they</name>	they	Tom’ll	‘It depends. The one I’m doing this evening is for a thousand - this one’s special - but it’ll vary from one hundred upwards. It’s not regular though. But there’s one coming up this Tuesday; I reckon [MASK] pay about four hundred.
<name>Juliet</name>	Juliet	Michael	I want us to be married traditionally, like your sister. We can have a church wedding when we get back. That way we will always belong,’ says [MASK]. She cups his face in her hands and plants kisses across his nose and cheeks.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Ngozi	[MASK]’s heart drops. Watches as the two part ways. A lone tear falls, then another and another. She starts the car, stares at the road ahead, wipes her eyes and drives steadily home. The tears are flowing.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Clocks	It’s almost quarter to nine. ‘Thanks, mate,’ he says, and continues walking up to the front to talk to one of the bouncers. [MASK] a few pretty girls as he makes his way.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Michael	[MASK] looks at his friend’s feet, notices the dried leaves teasing his shoes and the early morning damp beginning to cling to the toecaps. He looks again at his friend’s face. It is now totally slack, almost at peace.
<name>Shakira</name>	Shakira	Ngozi	Come, make we go dance.’ He follows her back into the hall where she dances and wiggles her hips, raising her arms all the way. His eyes fall on [MASK]. She’s just a few yards away, dancing with a group of women.
<name>Someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Ngozi	They find a way to build their own schools but again the laws conspire against them, shut down most of what they build. Then when things are supposed to start getting better, in come the seventies and eighties flooding their communities with drugs—’ [MASK] is taken aback.
<name>his wife</name>	his wife	Eliza	When people ask him what happened to his stiff back, he doesn’t tell them that [MASK] tried to kill him with loving last night. Instead he says with a slight laugh on his lips, ‘It’s old age, man, it’s old age.’
<name>Philippines</name>	Philippines	Blessing	In this world, her dreams are fulfilled, she’s back in school, practising her English and her numbers, and there’s more than enough to send back to [MASK], her mother, her brothers who she speaks to over the phone now, once a week.
<name>She</name>	She	Ngozi	Her sin, if it is a sin, is purely to want and work for a better life. It has been two years now and [MASK] longs for home. Yes, home. But her mission has only just begun. Her ambitions quiedy surge her forward.
<name>Betsy</name>	Betsy	Ngozi	Playing house, just the two of them, playing parts that deep inside they’ve always longed to play. [MASK] as wifey: preparing his meals, soothing his brow, satisfying his aches, taking care of him, taking care of herself, nails done, hair done.
<name>Malcolm</name>	Malcolm	Michael	All black people have their own culture, except that some are older than others, but they all branch out from the same tree. I know it’s just common sense to work that one out but sometimes the simplest ideas are the hardest to grasp.’ [MASK] nods his head, deep in thought.
<name>they</name>	they	Michael	To factories, transport systems and businesses, somewhere out there, leaving so early they crept out the house so as not to wake the little ones. Those little ones are not so little any more. Many are much older than [MASK].
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Carol	[MASK] is well built, some would say pretty, but there is a harshness around her eyes and mouth, and a sadness that has grown over the years. She sits at the dining table facing her friend, several batches of material spread out between them.

<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Hope	‘What about her schooling?’ ‘She will go to the school around the corner between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. after [MASK] is back from morning school. In fact it’s one of the best evening schools in the state.
<name>Sarah</name>	Sarah	Marcia	She backed away, holding her rucksack tightly to her chest. ‘[MASK], I’m sorry,’ he said, as he pushed forward a small bundle. ‘Please. Look,’ he said, you have a niece who wants to meet you.
<name>Mark</name>	Mark	Michael	‘I don’t know. I’m just curious.’ ‘Well, anyway, you coming?’ ‘I’ve got—’ [MASK] thinks of his part-time job at the Spar supermarket and his college course, which he’s not attended this past week.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Sunday	Twenty minutes later: ‘Is she in?’ She hears the male voice at the door downstairs. ‘Shit, O, it’s [MASK]!’ She hears his heavy footsteps make their way up the stairs. She jumps up, runs to her wardrobe, biscuit still in mouth.
<name>Katie</name>	Katie	Marcia	‘Hey, [MASK],’ he called. She turned to see him, and in that moment when his voice rang in her ears, as she knew it one day would, she did not know what to do. So she froze, while people in the street pushed on past.
<name>the solicitor</name>	the solicitor	Daniel	The solicitor calmly takes it all down. ‘There doesn’t seem to be much evidence,’ [MASK] says. ‘The police won’t have much of a case, but we’ve tried to get you out on bail and it’s set too high for you to afford.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Michael	He looks at her and the word ‘traitor’ flashes in his eyes. ‘I had to, [MASK]. I just had to. Please try and understand.’ ‘Understand WHAT?’ he shouts. ‘I had to. Something in me had to.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Devon	‘I’m so fucking angry with all of it. Tell me, for fuck’s sake, why it had to happen?’ ‘I don’t know,’ says [MASK]. ‘All they had to do was keep him in.
<name>him</name>	him	Alan	‘I’ve got to tell [MASK],’ she adds. ‘He was up with me on the phone half the night.’ ‘I thought he had a girlfriend?’ he asks. ‘Yeah, we’re just good friends. Anyway, I feel like celebrating.
<name>the boy</name>	the boy	Michael	He turns to [MASK], standing quietly near the bed. ‘How old are you?’ he asks. ‘Sixteen.’ ‘Can we contact your father?’ ‘I don’t have one. He left years ago.’
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Emmanuel	His kiss grows deeper, he shifts her gently to the floor, moves on top of her, she lies beneath him waiting, waiting for him to use her and remove himself from her body. She lies still. [MASK] feels her stiffen and whispers ‘I love you’ in her ear.
<name>black</name>	black	Osu	But—’ ‘But what?’ ‘The thing is, I’ve spent all my life being made to feel less than, not worthy, because of marriage, because my father would not marry my mother as she was [MASK].
<name>Mr. Smith</name>	Mr. Smith	Ngozi	He knocked softly on [MASK]’s door. ‘Are you okay in there?’ ‘Yes, Sir.’ ‘I thought I heard a noise. Can’t be too careful nowadays.’ ‘I’m fine, Sir.’
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Sunday	Then limps off to get on the number 50 bus, which has just pulled up. ‘I don’t like these Ogede people. They are nothing but trouble - no upbringing, no ambition, all they know is that weed they smoke,’ says [MASK].
<name>he</name>	he	Ngozi	‘I’m fine,’ she says. I’ve missed you. ‘I thought I’d call and see if you got home all right and to thank you for a great time.’ ‘Yeah, it was great,’ [MASK] says, breathing deeply.
<name>her friends</name>	her friends	Leroy	‘You’d better come in.’ And so she did. Talked only enough to stop the crying. To get her to the place where she needed to seek help. Professional help. For she knew her problems were bigger than [MASK] could understand.
<name>him</name>	him	Wind	It was not my choosing. I love them with such ... I cannot find the words. I kiss [MASK] who is now by my side. I kiss him deeply and it is sweet, like the day our eyes first met across the deck, yet sad.
<name>Isaac</name>	Isaac	mosdy	Instead they came to hammer them back to life, rebuilding them, until the tallest buildings the area had ever seen began to grow, and dominate the East End skyline, the business of money, not cargo, setting it alive. But [MASK] I remember the morning
<name>Barry</name>	Barry	Devon	Just like her mother and her mother’s mother and on, and on, and on. ‘They’re just a bunch of poofters. They can’t even kick the fucking ball properly!’ shouts [MASK] at the TV screen, gesticulating at the screen.
<name>Tayo</name>	Tayo	Ngozi	I want to go somewhere where these things don’t matter. I dey stay here, just dey let my life pass me by, O.’ ‘[MASK], things abroad aren’t as easy as you might think.’ ‘Really?’ ‘Really.’
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Ngozi	‘No, your uncle just told me, but I suppose it’s a good thing. You will need your education - God knows, no one is likely to marry you.’ [MASK]’s lower jaw drops. Her heart tightens with the suddenness of these words.
<name>Sydney</name>	Sydney	Marcia	You must have seen me with my sister.’ He goes to his jacket pocket and brings out a photo. ‘Is this the girl you saw?’ ‘I think so.’ ‘Well, that’s my sister, [MASK].’
<name>she</name>	she	Ngozi	He recently needed help with obtaining a million naira as quickly as possible for a business transaction, and [MASK] located the right names for him and directed him to the right people in the bank. He said to her, trying to be helpful in return, ‘You know, you should look into getting into computers
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Marcia	Beep beep beeeeep! A driver blows his horn as a pedestrian throws himself in front of his moving car. The driver waves his hand and shouts out of his window at the pedestrian. [MASK] looks over at the lights. They are still red. ‘Hi.’

<name>night</name>	night	Michael	His eye wanders down the line at the men’s suits, at the women’s white stilettos. This is not the usual club [MASK] goes to, it’s an older, wealthier crowd, with more white people than he’s used to at the club nights at his local youth centre.
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Wind	Now, two hundred years later, we - [MASK] and I - sit and stand among the people of these docks, follow them inland, into front rooms, into supermarkets and malls, into big dance halls with strange names and strange ways.
<name>Chuck</name>	Chuck	Michael	‘Do I bring anything?’ ‘No, just yourself,’ chuckles [MASK], then steps back from the car, waves goodbye, and breaks into a jog, catching up with the blonde who is halfway up the stairs to her flat.
<name>Maya</name>	Maya	Ngozi	Over a year ago she had told her, ‘[MASK], promise me, if you have any problems, if you’re not happy, if, if... if a man touches you, if he ... if you’re not happy, you will come home.’
<name>She</name>	She	Ngozi	He laughs. ‘You can’t get rid of me that easily.’ [MASK] smiles into his eyes. It’s been a long time since a man cared enough to find out if she was okay, and she likes it, misses it.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Michael	‘Family friend?’ ‘Yes.

<name>the deceased's name</name>	the deceased's name	Devon	But it seemed to her that everyone appeared to scatter as soon as trouble came, like worker ants on feeling the tremor of a stamping foot. Hearing the lawyer refer to him, [MASK], as the deceased sends a shiver down her spine.
<name>he</name>	he	Michael	‘Thanks,’ he said, his face expressionless as he closed the front door. But now [MASK] is pacing up and down, and something inside him simmers; it simmers until it begins to bubble, and bubble, and bubble.
<name>Chiamaka</name>	Chiamaka	Ngozi	Then he lunges across the desk and chases her around it until he’s dizzy. ‘[MASK], why you dey play so. Look, if you dey cooperate, I go give you more monnie.’ His smile is stretched across his face like a clown.

<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Michael	They will shadow him, and once in a while when he forgets, in the middle of laughter or in joy, they’ll tap him on the shoulder and [MASK] will reach for his balls, making sure they’re still there.
<name>Maya</name>	Maya	Ngozi	One day she will return to this land, to her people, and the question is, will he be willing to follow? He hears [MASK]’s infectious laugh and smiles to himself. The answer is he can’t let her go even if he wants to.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Ngozi	He gives up and steps inside. [MASK] is there facing him. She waits for him to come to her. They hold each other’s eyes. The phone rings and they stand in shocked silence. It rings again.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Ngozi	[MASK] closes her books and applauds the lecturer along with the rest of the class. She’s taken in so much information this past week that her head is spinning with it all. She looks around the room at her fellow students.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Marcia	‘Can’t you speed up a bit?’ she asks, growing impatient. He looks up from one of her books. ‘In my own time.’ [MASK] leans back in her chair. She observes her brother as he reads over her work.
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Ngozi	‘Please, just tell me something!’ [MASK] begins to cry silent tears. Her shoulders quietly heave up and down. ‘What do you want from me?’ she asks. ‘The truth,’ he says, moving closer, ‘just the truth.’
<name>Mariam</name>	Mariam	Ngozi	I’m telling you, she fought, fought through the fever that killed five the day before, to be born into this dirt. [MASK] lives in the small hut over there, the one covered with crumbling plaster and with the rusty zinc roof.
<name>Tolu</name>	Tolu	Nkiru	It’s filled with bananas, oranges, plantain, pineapple and yam. The smells swirl out into the air. ‘Mummy!’ shouts [MASK] in excitement. The five of them carry the load from the car and head towards the welcoming lights in the house.
<name>his wife</name>	his wife	Marcia	He flicks through his meeting information pack covering the deaths of black men in custody, mentally noting the start and finishing times for tomorrow, then puts his clothes away and skips downstairs to the lobby. At the information desk he asks where to buy the best towels - [MASK]’s asked him to get some.
<name>John</name>	John	Michael	‘I said I’m coming with you. Don’t worry, it’s all sorted.’ ‘That’s not what I mean. You’re not coming with me because I don’t want you with me.’ ‘Yes, I am,’ says [MASK].
<name>She</name>	She	Ngozi	They climb the stairs to the top deck and take a seat towards the back. [MASK] looks out the window down towards the pavement which is stained with chewing gum and gathering litter. She sees the terraced shops and the tops of people’s heads as the bus pulls away.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Ngozi	[MASK] has few memories of her father, mainly because she has chosen not to remember the arguments, or the tension, or being woken with a shake and the kerosene lamp that shone in her face when he would suddenly appear and remove her from her mother’s bed.
<name>Queen</name>	Queen	NGOZI	It’s time to leave. The Garden of Night [MASK] sits by the window and watches the landscape race by. At first, lone palm trees sway tall above the dry spiky grass, but they are soon swallowed completely by the bush as it grows greener and denser.
<name>she</name>	she	Nneka	‘You’ll be home soon. Three months isn’t very far.’ ‘I know but—’ ‘Besides, they seem like good people.’ ‘But—’ ‘Look at me,’ [MASK] says, lifting her daughter’s chin.
<name>She</name>	She	Marcia	‘What did they say?’ He turns to look at her, then breaks into a broad smile. ‘They said there’s a stall available for a week on Friday.’ [MASK] screams with joy, reaches over to hug her brother.
<name>Tony</name>	Tony	Charlie	‘Now, I want a fucking answer or else someone’s going to get hurt around here.’ ‘I wish I knew ’cause I want to kill him myself,’ she mumbles. ‘Yeah, right - you don’t expect me to believe you?’ [MASK] says, clicking his fingers.
<name>his</name>	his	Ben	So she’d made this trip, boarded the bus with fight in her belly. But standing there in front of [MASK]’s house, in front of his wife, the words she’d rehearsed would not come, so instead she said, ‘I’m a friend.
<name>she</name>	she	Ngozi	Maybe coming from their continent made their sacrifice seem less important. Instead, [MASK] had walked away indignant, wondering why it was such a bad thing for her to want more and to have left her home in search of it.
<name>Magwitch</name>	Magwitch	Ngozi	‘Look at you,’ says the boy. ‘Wretched dirty fool.’ The other two laugh. ‘And yourself, look at you - your face looks like a dog’s backside,’ says [MASK]. ‘Look at you, you’re .. .

<name>Cheryl</name>	Cheryl	Ngozi	She sits at the dining table facing her friend, several batches of material spread out between them. [MASK] laid them out on the table earlier, taking care to match and display them in a way she hoped would provoke a sale.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Michael	‘Well, where are they? I want to know now.’ He pulls a gun out from his belt and points it straight at [MASK], who is whimpering now, kneeling, head bent with the force of the other man’s gun at his temple.
<name>He</name>	He	Simon	It was their little secret. [MASK] had been the one to walk her to school, and on cold frosty mornings when it was too chilly for her, he would carry her on his back and they would sing to forget the sharp pinch on their ears, noses and hands.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Ngozi	‘They are all fine, O. Hey, look at the time! I bettar hurry before I miss my train - I’ve got to take the twins to school. [MASK], please, O, can you put my things away?’
<name>Clarice</name>	Clarice	Ngozi	[MASK] yanks her wrist away, kicks her knee into his groin, and in a sideways move flings herself across the desk. He pulls at her, and she bites, bites hard, her teeth locking down on his meaty flesh.
<name>he</name>	he	Sharon	I suppose it’s not too late for me to say happy birthday,’ she says, her voice softer. ‘Not at all.’ ‘I was thinking about you all day yesterday,’ [MASK] says. He hears the smile in her voice.
<name>Temple</name>	Temple	Gratitude	‘Point three, it is not good to show a man that you are impressed. [MASK], yes. Impressed, no.’ And she so wants to reel this man in. ‘You dey tempt me, O, but I really have things I have to do.’

<name>It</name>	It	Lagos	Could she take this child home to her village? Bring it up there? [MASK] would no longer be practical. But if she went to the village, how would she survive, with what money, with what future? She turns on to her side.
<name>he</name>	he	Michael	They leave, but in truth [MASK] runs, runs out of there, as fast as he can. And later that night when he gets home after dropping off his date, he locks the windows and the doors tight against the feelings, the love that knocks away and rattles to come inside.
<name>Frida</name>	Frida	Ngozi	In her youth [MASK] only ever remembers him dressed in crisp white shirts. ‘What do you want?’ ‘I came to see my daughter.’ ‘And now you are finally concerned to come find me - now 1 am grown and can stand on my own feet?
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Fred	Her voice quietens as she relays juicy information to her friend. ‘He’s such a good man. A man of the eighties. A good lover. Let me tell you,’ she says in a whisper. [MASK]’s ears strain all the harder.
<name>someone</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name.)	someone (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name.)

<name>her</name>	her	Hope	They move from the sitting room to the dining room, to the kitchen, then she hears [MASK] scream as they discover her in the kitchen storeroom, and she yells like a pig about to be slaughtered as the men drag her outside. They enter her room.
<name>She</name>	She	Ngozi	‘You gutless weasel.’ [MASK] leans against the door, feeling numb. She looks over at the window and imagines him getting into his car and driving away. She tries to squeeze out a tear, but at the same time, deep inside, feels an immense relief.
