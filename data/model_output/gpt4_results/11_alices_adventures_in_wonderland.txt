<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘A knot!’ said [MASK], always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her. ‘Oh, do let me help to undo it!’ ‘I shall do nothing of the sort,’ said the Mouse, getting up and walking away.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	CHAPTER IX. The Mock Turtle’s Story ‘You can’t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!’ said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into [MASK]’s, and they walked off together.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	said the Footman. ‘That’s the first question, you know.’ It was, no doubt: only [MASK] did not like to be told so. ‘It’s really dreadful,’ she muttered to herself, ‘the way all the creatures argue.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down here till I’m somebody else”--but, oh dear!’ cried [MASK], with a sudden burst of tears, ‘I do wish they WOULD put their heads down!
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘Would it be of any use, now,’ thought [MASK], ‘to speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.’
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	said [MASK], and she put them into a large flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the others. ‘Are their heads off?’ shouted the Queen.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; ‘for it might end, you know,’ said [MASK] to herself, ‘in my going out altogether, like a candle.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘The trial cannot proceed,’ said the King in a very grave voice, ‘until all the jurymen are back in their proper places--ALL,’ he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at [MASK] as he said do.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	[MASK] did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:-- ‘I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye, How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--’ [later editions continued as follows
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘You promised to tell me your history, you know,’ said [MASK], ‘and why it is you hate--C and D,’ she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again. ‘Mine is a long and a sad tale!’
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘Which would NOT be an advantage,’ said [MASK], who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. ‘Just think of what work it would make with the day and night!
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	said [MASK] as she picked her way through the wood. ‘It’s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all my life!’ Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘Have some wine,’ the March Hare said in an encouraging tone. [MASK] looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. ‘I don’t see any wine,’ she remarked.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	’ ‘They were obliged to have him with them,’ the Mock Turtle said: ‘no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.’ ‘Wouldn’t it really?’ said [MASK] in a tone of great surprise.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	[MASK] knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘If I’d been the whiting,’ said [MASK], whose thoughts were still running on the song, ‘I’d have said to the porpoise, “Keep back, please: we don’t want YOU with us!”
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who was talking. [MASK] could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down ‘stupid things!’
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	[MASK] thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.
<name>Dinah</name>	Dinah	Dinah	‘I wish I hadn’t mentioned [MASK]!’ she said to herself in a melancholy tone. ‘Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I’m sure she’s the best cat in the world!
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and [MASK]’s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas!
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them didn’t know how to spell ‘stupid,’ and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. ‘A nice muddle their slates’ll be in before the trial’s over!’ thought [MASK].
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when [MASK] had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘You mean you can’t take LESS,’ said the Hatter: ‘it’s very easy to take MORE than nothing.’ ‘Nobody asked YOUR opinion,’ said [MASK]. ‘Who’s making personal remarks now?’
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. [MASK] led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	The great question certainly was, what? [MASK] looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘I make you a present of everything I’ve said as yet.’ ‘A cheap sort of present!’ thought [MASK]. ‘I’m glad they don’t give birthday presents like that!’ But she did not venture to say it out loud.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘Oh, you’re sure to do that,’ said the Cat, ‘if you only walk long enough.’ [MASK] felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question. ‘What sort of people live about here?’
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	Don’t be all day about it!’ and he went on in these words: ‘Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn’t believe it--’ ‘I never said I didn’t!’ interrupted [MASK].
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘Come on, then,’ said the Queen, ‘and he shall tell you his history,’ As they walked off together, [MASK] heard the King say in a low voice, to the company generally, ‘You are all pardoned.’
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	Oh, I shouldn’t like THAT!’ ‘Oh, you foolish [MASK]!’ she answered herself. ‘How can you learn lessons in here? Why, there’s hardly room for YOU, and no room at all for any lesson-books!’
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘THAT you won’t’ thought [MASK], and, after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Mabel	No, I’ve made up my mind about it; if I’m [MASK], I’ll stay down here! It’ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying “Come up again, dear!” I shall only look up and say “Who am I then?
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	Now you know.’ ‘And what are they made of?’ [MASK] asked in a tone of great curiosity. ‘Soles and eels, of course,’ the Gryphon replied rather impatiently: ‘any shrimp could have told you that.’
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	And the moral of that is--“The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours.”’ ‘Oh, I know!’ exclaimed [MASK], who had not attended to this last remark, ‘it’s a vegetable.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	[MASK] tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: ‘But why did they live at the bottom of a well?’
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	[MASK] looked up, and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm. ‘A fine day, your Majesty!’ the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;--but I must be kind to them,’ thought [MASK], ‘or perhaps they won’t walk the way I want to go!
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	[MASK] took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: ‘Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘Can’t remember WHAT things?’ said the Caterpillar. ‘Well, I’ve tried to say “HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE,” but it all came different!’ [MASK] replied in a very melancholy voice.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to [MASK] to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘Please, then,’ said [MASK], ‘how am I to get in?’ ‘There might be some sense in your knocking,’ the Footman went on without attending to her, ‘if we had the door between us.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!’ thought [MASK]. ‘Now we shall get on better.’ ‘I’d rather finish my tea,’ said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.’ Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so [MASK] soon began talking again.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn’t get them out again. That’s all.’ ‘Thank you,’ said [MASK], ‘it’s very interesting. I never knew so much about a whiting before.’
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark, with variations. ‘I shall sit here,’ he said, ‘on and off, for days and days.’ ‘But what am I to do?’ said [MASK].
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘By-the-bye, what became of the baby?’ said the Cat. ‘I’d nearly forgotten to ask.’ ‘It turned into a pig,’ [MASK] quietly said, just as if it had come back in a natural way.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘It’s all her fancy, that: they never executes nobody, you know. Come on!’ ‘Everybody says “come on!” here,’ thought [MASK], as she went slowly after it: ‘I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!’
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘That’s nothing to what I could say if I chose,’ the Duchess replied, in a pleased tone. ‘Pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,’ said [MASK]. ‘Oh, don’t talk about trouble!’
<name>Dinah</name>	Dinah	Dinah	she said to herself in a melancholy tone. ‘Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I’m sure she’s the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear [MASK]! I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!’
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children, ‘Come away, my dears! It’s high time you were all in bed!’ On various pretexts they all moved off, and [MASK] was soon left alone.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.’ For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that [MASK] had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘But then,’ thought [MASK], ‘shall I NEVER get any older than I am now? That’ll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--but then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn’t like THAT!’
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	The Pool of Tears ‘Curiouser and curiouser!’ cried [MASK] (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); ‘now I’m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!’
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘Then it ought to be Number One,’ said [MASK]. The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. ‘Consider your verdict,’ he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘It’s--it’s a very fine day!’ said a timid voice at her side. She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face. ‘Very,’ said [MASK]: ‘--where’s the Duchess?’ ‘Hush!
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	Quick, now!’ And [MASK] was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made. ‘He took me for his housemaid,’ she said to herself as she ran.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘Come, it’s pleased so far,’ thought [MASK], and she went on. ‘Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?’ ‘That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,’ said the Cat.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?’ ‘I should like it very much,’ said [MASK], ‘but I haven’t been invited yet.’ ‘You’ll see me there,’ said the Cat, and vanished.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘If you knew Time as well as I do,’ said the Hatter, ‘you wouldn’t talk about wasting IT. It’s HIM.’ ‘I don’t know what you mean,’ said [MASK]. ‘Of course you don’t!’
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘I thought it would,’ said the Cat, and vanished again. [MASK] waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘What day of the month is it?’ he said, turning to [MASK]: he had taken his watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?’ thought [MASK] to herself. ‘Of the mushroom,’ said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	[MASK] glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to be listening, so she went on again: ‘Twenty-four hours, I THINK; or is it twelve?
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘I don’t know of any that do,’ [MASK] said very politely, feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation. ‘You don’t know much,’ said the Duchess; ‘and that’s a fact.’
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	There could be no doubt that it had a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether [MASK] did not like the look of the thing at all.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	[MASK] looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	For he can thoroughly enjoy The pepper when he pleases!’ CHORUS. ‘Wow! wow! wow!’ ‘Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!’ the Duchess said to [MASK], flinging the baby at her as she spoke.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	You know the song, perhaps?’ ‘I’ve heard something like it,’ said [MASK]. ‘It goes on, you know,’ the Hatter continued, ‘in this way:-- “Up above the world you fly, Like a tea-tray in the sky.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘A barrowful of WHAT?’ thought [MASK]; but she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	Now I growl when I’m pleased, and wag my tail when I’m angry. Therefore I’m mad.’ ‘I call it purring, not growling,’ said [MASK]. ‘Call it what you like,’ said the Cat.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘--so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is!’ ‘No, indeed,’ said [MASK]. ‘What sort of a dance is it?’ ‘Why,’ said the Gryphon, ‘you first form into a line along the sea-shore--’
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘The idea of having the sentence first!’ ‘Hold your tongue!’ said the Queen, turning purple. ‘I won’t!’ said [MASK]. ‘Off with her head!’ the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	about once in a minute. [MASK] began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute, ‘and then,’ thought she, ‘what would become of me?
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	There was a long silence after this, and [MASK] could only hear whispers now and then; such as, ‘Sure, I don’t like it, yer honour, at all, at all!’ ‘Do as I tell you, you coward!’
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,’ said [MASK]; ‘but when you have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you’ll feel it a little queer, won’t you?’
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school every day--’ ‘I’VE been to a day-school, too,’ said [MASK]; ‘you needn’t be so proud as all that.’
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	said [MASK], in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.
<name>Pennyworth</name>	Pennyworth	Pennyworth	Soo--oop of the e--e--evening, Beautiful, beautiful Soup! ‘Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish, Game, or any other dish? Who would not give all else for two [MASK] only of beautiful Soup?
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!’ ‘I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,’ said [MASK], who was a very truthful child; ‘but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.’
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘You are,’ said the King. ‘Nearly two miles high,’ added the Queen. ‘Well, I shan’t go, at any rate,’ said [MASK]: ‘besides, that’s not a regular rule: you invented it just now.’
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Bill	(The unfortunate little [MASK] had left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	No, there were no tears. ‘If you’re going to turn into a pig, my dear,’ said [MASK], seriously, ‘I’ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind now!’
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Bill	Who’s to go down the chimney?--Nay, I shan’t! YOU do it!--That I won’t, then!--Bill’s to go down--Here, [MASK]! the master says you’re to go down the chimney!’ ‘Oh!
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘I wish you wouldn’t squeeze so.’ said the Dormouse, who was sitting next to her. ‘I can hardly breathe.’ ‘I can’t help it,’ said [MASK] very meekly: ‘I’m growing.’
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘It’s no use speaking to it,’ she thought, ‘till its ears have come, or at least one of them.’ In another minute the whole head appeared, and then [MASK] put down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	The moment [MASK] appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	So she stood still where she was, and waited. When the procession came opposite to [MASK], they all stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely ‘Who is this?’ She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘Off with her head!’ the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved. ‘Who cares for you?’ said [MASK], (she had grown to her full size by this time.) ‘You’re nothing but a pack of cards!’
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	[MASK] had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there. ‘That’s the judge,’ she said to herself, ‘because of his great wig.’
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Pat	(Sounds of more broken glass.) ‘Now tell me, [MASK], what’s that in the window?’ ‘Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!’ (He pronounced it ‘arrum.’) ‘An arm, you goose!
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘It matters a good deal to ME,’ said [MASK] hastily; ‘but I’m not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn’t want YOURS: I don’t like them raw.’
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses. ‘Off with their heads!’ and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to [MASK] for protection. ‘You shan’t be beheaded!’
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	It quite makes my forehead ache!’ [MASK] watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like, ‘--for they haven’t got much evidence YET,’ she said to herself.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	If they had any sense, they’d take the roof off.’ After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and [MASK] heard the Rabbit say, ‘A barrowful will do, to begin with.’
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘Did you say “What a pity!”?’ the Rabbit asked. ‘No, I didn’t,’ said [MASK]: ‘I don’t think it’s at all a pity. I said “What for?”’
<name>Serpent</name>	Serpent	Serpent	‘And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,’ continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, ‘and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, [MASK]!’
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, ‘I’ve tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them!’ ‘I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about,’ said [MASK].
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘Ah, well! It means much the same thing,’ said the Duchess, digging her sharp little chin into [MASK]’s shoulder as she added, ‘and the moral of THAT is--“Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves.”
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	‘Oh, you can’t help that,’ said the Cat: ‘we’re all mad here. I’m mad. You’re mad.’ ‘How do you know I’m mad?’ said [MASK].
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that [MASK] had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.
