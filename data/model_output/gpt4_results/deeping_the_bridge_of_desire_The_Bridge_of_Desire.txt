<name>He</name>	He	Samson	You can build a rough seat there while I am away.” [MASK] watched her as she went along the grass path beside the hornbeam hedge. “She’s goin’ to be ill,” that was his verdict upon the case, “maybe she is ill.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	North	“[MASK], don’t be hard on the man. He could say more bitter things about himself than ever you could.” “I’m glad. Well, I must be getting back. Are you going up to see her?” “Yes.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Martin	She sighed within herself. “Don’t bother, [MASK], I can finish them.” He was piqued straightway by her discovering that he was working under protest, and his immediate impulse was to stay there obstinately doing the thing he did not want to do.
<name>He</name>	He	Brough	I shall write to her and tell her; I shall ask her to try and wait. I have got to build up a new self-respect. That’s all.” [MASK] was silent a moment; then he blurted out a very blunt opinion.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Kate	“Which is it to be, the saffron one the little Frenchwoman made for you?” “I don’t know. I think I told [MASK] to put out the pink.” “Anyone you know going to the Casino to-night?”
<name>She</name>	She	Nella	I was upstairs changing. I heard your car outside.” [MASK] felt herself scanned by the other woman’s eyes. “I am afraid I’m rather early.” “Don’t take that chair; it’s a beast. Try this one.
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Frensham	“One learns not to do that. A woman may need her silence to defend herself against other women. Men forget that.” She could not help watching [MASK] more anxiously that evening, while hiding her suspense from him as though it were a sin.
<name>Isobel</name>	Isobel	Nella	Something akin to fear came into his eyes. He tried to lift his head, but she laid a hand across his forehead. “[MASK]—you?” “Lie still, dear. Are you afraid of me?” His eyes stared up at her.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Nella	[MASK] went towards the piano, hesitated, blew out one of the candles and seated herself on the music-stool. Her hands rested on the keyboard for some seconds as though the soul in her was inarticulate and distressed.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Nella	“[MASK], you don’t know what it feels like to be sick with a kind of deadly shame.” She bent over him, smoothing his forehead with her hands. “Perhaps I can guess. Perhaps I understand it all from the beginning.
<name>She</name>	She	Nella	If he would only talk, open his heart, throw off his thickening reserve. Her sensitive wisdom chose to sit and wait, asking nc questions. Men hated questions, the crude “penny-for-your- thoughts” method, and [MASK] knew it.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Martin	“I’m very cross with you, [MASK].” “Oh!” He sat there stiffly and did not respond to her challenge, ’ and the spoiled child in her put out its tongue. “Don’t look bored. You never even noticed me this afternoon.
<name>Lucia</name>	Lucia	Nella	“As a matter of fact, we brought sandwiches.” “Give them to the river god—or the nearest small boy.” “That is an easy solution.” “Charity with convenience!” “What a pity [MASK] is not here.”
<name>Raffles</name>	Raffles	Brough	I have invited the Mirlees girl to come to the afternoon concert at the Casino. She will be better out of the way.” “Not till the afternoon, [MASK]!” “My dear chap, be thankful for that.”
<name>him</name>	him	Frensham	They understood; they looked at this tragedy of hers with men’s eyes; they did not try to abuse [MASK] to her; they pitied him, were ready to keep his secret. The women whom she knew would have acted as violent and merciless partisans.
<name>Millicent</name>	Millicent	Nella	“Yes, m’am.” The girl vanished, and for some moments [MASK] stood absolutely still, looking at her own reflection in the glass. Then she turned, walked to the door of the study, opened it, and went in.
<name>Aschenbach</name>	Aschenbach	Frensham	Then [MASK] had remembered the facts, and had given the seller of coral that queer, ironic look. For he had begun to treat himself with irony; to utter sharp, wise sayings that were like the blows of a flagellant’s scourge.
<name>masked</name>	masked	Vas	Her pale face was faintly flushed; her eyes bright and restless, and she talked with a careless vivacity that [MASK] intimate and delusive. “Fancy playing golf among the ruins of aqueducts! It made me laugh yesterday. You English are terrible people; I believe you would demand ‘links’ in heaven.
<name>George</name>	George	George	“She can be kind to an old man like me, and let me sit there, and talk, and argue. She’s a comrade, a good comrade, and much more than that. Clever—by [MASK], yes, with a proper woman’s cleverness!
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Moorhens	It was a sweet spot this lake, hidden away from the house in a little wood of birch trees whose silver boles were like pipes pouring out plumes of delicate green foliage. White and yellow water-lilies floated on the water. [MASK] disappeared into the rushes.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Hallo	He glimpsed all the beauty of the woman in her, the wife woman, so much finer in many ways than the man. “[MASK], dear!—introduce me !” His surface playfulness hid a shamed and tender humility. For the moment he had lost faith in himself.
<name>Giuseppe</name>	Giuseppe	Frensham	“But perhaps the signora has been dreaming!” A lantern hung from a hook in the ceiling, a lantern that [MASK] and his wife had often used on dark nights when taking the short cut over the ravine and through the pine wood.
<name>Slade</name>	Slade	Cave	[MASK], one of those indefinably repellent men whom no decent woman could touch without physical loathing, had a quite unwholesome love of anything that was savored of sex. He was perched, the raw meat in his claw, two or three cronies round him when the war-eagle swooped.
<name>Lucia</name>	Lucia	Nella	First came the white paving-stones of the terrace, then the carved balustrade, then four big cypresses standing green and still. Between the cypresses a distant headland could be seen, jutting out into the blue of the sea. A few white clouds floated on the horizon. [MASK] lay with her eyes closed.
<name>Chalmers</name>	Chalmers	North	I hate that man, he never will take me seriously.” “My dear young lady, doctors are apt to be reticent, or to defend themselves by pretending to be playful. Do you expect [MASK] to talk to you as though you were fifty?”
<name>Smithers</name>	Smithers	Peters	Then he sat down at his desk, took his right arm out of its sling, freed his thumb and fingers by snipping at the bandages with a pair of scissors so that he could hold a pen. He wrote a brief note to [MASK] who owned the Rookhurst garage.
<name>Giulietta</name>	Giulietta	Anna	“Well, you know where to find him, or shall I have to go myself?’ [MASK] drew near and looked into her mistress’s eyes. “The signora is not mad, then—or dreaming? Yes, yes, I will go.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Samson	His blue shirt showed up against the freshly turned soil. “Good morning, [MASK].” He straightened, turned a brown face towards her, and rested a heavy boot on the shoulder of his spade. “Morning, m’am.”
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Martin	[MASK] was hers; she had always felt herself woman enough to hold him. But now------ “Why, it will be getting dusk soon. I’ve got no light on my bicycle. I must be going.”
<name>Wyant</name>	Wyant	Frensham	Someone was coming up the drive; she heard the rattling of the shingle. The footsteps approached the house, and came straight on along the path that ran between the lawn and the loggia. “Nel-la, Nel-la!” [MASK]’s wife rose with a rush of impatience.
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Frensham	[MASK]’s eyes fell into a stare. That figure ahead of him was aggressively familiar. There was no mistaking the brisk, combative walk, the way that cane was held gripped in the left hand, the slight swing of the shoulders.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Frensham	[MASK] was conscious of a sudden coldness towards his wife. A harsh sincerity gripped him. He felt frozen, inarticulate, callous. And though a vague wonder at the change possessed him, he made no effort to break the spell. “Have you had tea?”
<name>James</name>	James	Nella	The maid entered the room. 120 “Am I to pack your dress clothes, sir?” “Of course.” “Thank you.” He wrote [MASK] a check for five hundred pounds, folded it up, and slipped it into an envelope.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Frensham	There was a glitter in her eyes, and she was hungry. [MASK] had gone to the library after breakfast, and was sitting there at his desk, trying to write, but he could not escape from his senses and break through into that other world of the creative imagination.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Martin	“Damned rot, damned rot.” All this seemed part of the new phase; she did not understand it in its entirety, but she pitied him. “Stop writing for a month, [MASK].” He bit hard at his pipe. “I can’t.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Nella	“Thank you. It’s time you were in bed.” [MASK] had risen, and was opening her bureau; her hands rustled suggestively among a sheaf of papers. She could have taken the girl by the shoulders and thrust her out of the French window.
<name>He</name>	He	Frensham	She was not a woman of one mood, one day, one expression. [MASK] was always discovering her afresh. Her eyes were extraordinarily changeable. One moment they would be staring at life with exultant audacity, and he saw the woman of passion.
<name>Slade</name>	Slade	Stewart	We have got to have our guns ready to blow the feathers out of any gossiping birds, hen or otherwise, that gets up in this country. I was coming to see you because you can keep a secret.” [MASK] was lighting a cheroot.
<name>George</name>	George	Dixon	“I must get there and hit. Old men drive me crazy.” She seemed to have unnerved [MASK], who was driving against her. He waggled self-consciously, took a cramped swing, and pulled into the rough fifty yards from the tee.
<name>Macarthur</name>	Macarthur	Frensham	A white-haired old boy with a keen, fresh face strolled over from the opposite corner. “You are a lot of scandalmongering women here.” “Eavesdropping, General!” “I have been listening. [MASK]’s a good fellow and a wise man.
<name>Clarisse</name>	Clarisse	Eve	Was that what such people thought of him; did they accept him as one of themselves? He had walked round into the casino gardens, and here he was challenged by [MASK] herself, a very chic little lady, with red hair and pale eyes, with whom he had played bridge at the hotel.
<name>Maisie</name>	Maisie	Nella	Half a gale was blowing, the oak boughs were beating up and down, and the sky was hard and gray. [MASK] went as far as one of the gates closing a main “ride,” and the coincidence that met her there was a thing that she never forgot.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Martin	I think it’s just sweet.” Her slang silenced him. He had begun to realize that she could be vulgar in spite of all her cleverness. “Here’s your setting, [MASK], all ready like an egg waiting to be hatched.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Frensham	In the months that were to come [MASK] could never explain to himself the extraordinary callousness that took possession of him on that most critical of mornings. He felt no qualms, no pity, no dread of the future.
<name>Pinero</name>	Pinero	Frensham	“Yes.” The remarks that were passed upon [MASK], his villa, his plays, and his career were amusingly various and suggestive. The ordinary male’s first thought had a full commercial flavor. “That chap must have made a pot of money!
<name>Olga</name>	Olga	Martin	Will you come?” He looked at her steadily. “No. I’m rather tired, [MASK].” “All right.” He pushed his chair back abruptly. “We might have coffee in the loggia.” “Yes.”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Frensham	[MASK] swung along, staring at the ground. “She will understand,” he said, “she will think the better of me for staying away—for a time.” “What does that mean, man?
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Samson	“It has got to be done. [MASK] has a fist like a rake; one can’t trust him at this kind of job.” They worked on in silence, both of them unhappy and on edge.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Nella	Still, I’ll go and rest if you think I ought to.” She went up to her bedroom with the double idea of humoring [MASK] and of being out of the way, but her bed knew her not; she spent all the time in an arm-chair by the window.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Frensham	It made me laugh yesterday. You English are terrible people; I believe you would demand ‘links’ in heaven. My, look at that little woman there! A pity these Italian girls are so swarthy and have such big feet.” [MASK] did not lose his reserve.
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	Nella	“Boredom!” He pressed his knees hard against his bag of clubs and thought of [MASK] pruning roses. Why was he bored, why had he become so confoundedly restless, why had he to fight himself into his desk chair each day?
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Nella	She wondered. Life was so unexpected, so nai've. “I thought I should find you here.” [MASK] raised herself, and turning her head saw a girl in a cerise-colored pull-over and brown skirt emerging from the larch wood.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Nella	Almost as she spoke lightning broke from the clouds above. It was brilliant, magnificent, filling the whole valley with one blue glare. For one moment the terrace and the room itself were almost as light as day. [MASK] saw the face of the man who was standing at the window.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Nella	That broken wrist brought the blaze to a crisis. Once when [MASK] had gone out he stole like a guilty lover into her room, and stood looking about him at all that was hers. Here were her little intimate possessions, a woman’s things scattered about.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Humanity	“That’s queer. [MASK] does not suffer from that complaint too often.” “It’s a man’s view.” “And none the worse for that. Now for a frank question. You called the people at the Semiramis an unclean crowd.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Harland	I have a library book I must finish.” “I think I’ll go,” he answered. “[MASK] asked me yesterday to run across if I could. I shan’t be late.” But he was late.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Martin	She bought more bulbs and planted them herself in the orchard and among the larches. [MASK] had hankered after a sundial, and an old stone pedestal, with four clipped yews set round it, and she bought four yews at three guineas apiece, and picked up an old sundial in a curio shop.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Frensham	Perhaps that was the strangest week that [MASK] ever spent. The passion that had driven him on this adventure was dying like a lamp that had burned up its oil; and at the same time night was turning into day; a vague, gray discomforted dawn issued in the past phase of the drama.
<name>Giuseppe</name>	Giuseppe	Tolorneo	Then [MASK] had an idea; he was a big fellow with the strength of a mule. “I can carry the signore on my back—see.” “Excellent, and if someone acts as rear guard and steadies everything from behind—give me the lantern.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Martin	The strange thing was that she felt no bitterness against [MASK]. In fact, she conceived a pity for him, born of the sure conviction that he was doomed to suffer. The mother instinct survived. Even his caddishness and his treachery pleaded for justification and helped her to understand all that had happened.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Nella	The cypresses rocked; the pines lifted up their hands and moaned. [MASK] knew every turn of the path, and between the gusts of wind she could hear the splash of water where the stream in the ravine fell in a miniature cascade over a ledge of rock.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Nella	The sex fog rolled away from him. For the moment his eyes saw things clearly. He walked on and met [MASK] and the child just as they were turning away from the lake. All the tranquil water. and the green spaces of the wood lay behind her.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	North	She had never even hinted to him before that she had ceased to be her normal self; he had even doubted whether she had recognized the subtle nature of the change that had manifested itself during the last two months. “I shouldn’t send [MASK] away.
<name>Lucia</name>	Lucia	Nella	The day had a certain sparkle and briskness, but [MASK] wandered out into the garden with an aimlessness that was tragic. Her face looked thinner and more ethereal, and her eyes had a vague, shadowy sadness. Things did not interest her.
<name>He</name>	He	Frensham	The back wheels tore a grip, and the car came up on to the level. “Good man; I thought she might jib at that.” [MASK] swung the door open for her. “Where will you go ? Home, or to a doctor ?”
<name>laugh</name>	laugh	wonder-------	“The best men get it,” he said, “this fever. Oh, yes, sex is a blessing and a curse. I used to [MASK]. I could tell you things about myself; I couldn’t help them then any more than a kettle can help boiling over.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Nella	[MASK] hated going below. His business had been to tuck her up in her rug and leave her to resist nature, and to come and hearten her when the French coast was in sight. These memories seemed to strip his brain of the muffling sense-satisfactions of the moment.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Frensham	The old man’s quick glance suggested the glance of a sentry, alert, vaguely mistrustful. The Irish terrier came sniffing round [MASK]’s legs. “A bit boggy, here. General.” “It is.”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Frensham	We did not know you were leaving so soon. I hope you have been comfortable here.” “Oh, perfectly. I want my luggage packed.” “I will send up a valet, sir.” [MASK]’s mental tone had changed.
<name>Grant</name>	Grant	Frensham	Some hundred yards farther on the track curved sharply and disappeared round a steep bank covered with young birch trees and brambles. [MASK] was within ten yards of the corner when the black snout of another car flashed round the bank like the nose of a steam launch round a breakwater.
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Nella	She found herself wondering whether her own partisanship had not meddled when it should have stood aside. She was very tender with [MASK], perhaps because of her own sudden self-distrust. “Your hands are quite cold, dear.” “Are they?”
<name>John</name>	John	Brough	[MASK] looked at her seriously. “I shouldn’t do that, young woman. You might be sorry afterwards.” She flung up her chin. “There! You men always stand by each other; it’s a conspiracy, a great conspiracy.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Nella	[MASK]’s letters had not flowed easily. She had been trying to put cheerfulness on paper, to play a part, to rise above a feeling of languor and of pessimism. The bright eye of the robin interrogated her boldly.
<name>Soames</name>	Soames	Martin	There was the water garden, where [MASK] had played like a boy, dabbling with cement and a trowel, and puddling clay till he had been yellow to the waist. His boyish zest in life, his delight in the simple things! Why was he losing them?
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Nella	It was mere persiflage, but [MASK] watched them a moment, and understood. She saw a strange man in her husband. They had come together—these two. There was something burning under all that casual by-play.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Hallo	The night was so dark that she did not see him till she had come quite close. “[MASK]!” He paused and stood still. “Not a bad sort of night; cool out here.” “Can you smell the night-stock?”
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Magnus	She abandoned it for the tea tray. “He was too—too virile, [MASK].” “What! Too virile?” “Too aggressively human. He had reacted too far. I can imagine him telling risque stories in order to prove his humanity.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Frensham	“Four down and nine to play. It’s up to us, partner. If you could find your nerve we might do it.” [MASK]’s upper lip tightened. He was mad with himself, and her tolerance piqued him.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	North	[MASK] dropped his sardonic playfulness, and became the responsible and tolerant physician. He was a man who had a sensitive hatred of sentimentality; it made him rage, threw him into a kind of furious cynicism. He had the artist’s sense of the fitness of things.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Judith	That’s the honest truth. But your mood is reasonable; it’s flattering to me—in a way. There is no reason why we shouldn’t move on elsewhere.” “That’s generous of you, [MASK].” “Not a bit.
<name>Joseph</name>	Joseph	Joseph	One toddler with sloe black eyes and a “[MASK]’s coat” of many patches insisted on being led by the hand. They had filled her basket with flowers, and they babbled and flowed about her, and touched her with their hands.
<name>Worthington</name>	Worthington	Rigby	“General, I’ve been waiting for someone to blow that scallywag out of the water.” Other voices took up the cry. “The man’s a cad.” “How did he get in here?” “Oh, [MASK] put him up.”
<name>John</name>	John	Frensham	He had known scores of such still, peaceful, radiant days, when the earth looks clean and beautiful, and the joy of life is pure and serene. Yet [MASK] remembered one such morning that brought a thickness into his throat and a sense of moist heat to his eyes.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Frensham	“Will you come this way, monsieur?” [MASK] had never had any great love for humanity in the mass, but the crowded lounge of the Hotel de Russie was no more than a place full of meaningless noise. He was in a state of physical pain.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Magnus	His face was twitching. For a moment he could not speak. “Don’t rub it in, [MASK]. Has she been shielding me all this time, refusing to throw me off? And I—I left her like a cad, without a word—brutally.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Frensham	She was playing a comedy, and [MASK] made but a poor actor. He compelled himself to go and sit beside her in the lounge or the winter garden, but when he was near her he had nothing to say.
<name>He</name>	He	Frensham	She was waiting, listening, wondering, knowing that something threatened her, intuitively conscious of what it was. Men betray themselves either by over-kindness or by an indifference that scorns caution. There are a hundred subtle vibrations that record themselves upon a woman’s sensitive soul. [MASK] was detestably courteous.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Frensham	The car was all on a tilt, and it was a pretty steep pull up from where the jammed-on brakes had held her just short of a tree. [MASK] put in the reverse, raced his engine, and timed clutch and brake to a nicety.
<name>Margery</name>	Margery	Nella	The masonry had been left rough, and the joints unpointed, and [MASK] and her man had spent hours in tucking moss and rock plants in between the stones so that all the crude newness had been dispelled. The gates themselves were of dark oak, patterned with square panels.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Judith	“Enjoying the scenery, partner?” He found [MASK] standing beside him, her eyes studying his face. He had been so intent on watching tha+ memory-house up yonder that he had not noticed that she had left the compartment and placed herself at his side.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Frencham	They lunched at the clubhouse, and had their coffee taken out on to the terrace. It was sunny and warm, and the greens and blues of the April landscape were soft and pleasant to the eyes. [MASK] lay back in his deck chair, indolent, meditative.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Frensham	[MASK] picked up a stool and sat down well in the shadow. Neither of them seemed in a hurry to make conversation. It had become possible for them to be laconic, or easily silent, like partners in a log hut. “How’s the wrist?”
<name>Trant</name>	Trant	Associations	He had been so intent on watching tha+ memory-house up yonder that he had not noticed that she had left the compartment and placed herself at his side. “I am very fond of this coast.” She saw his face grow sullen and defensive. “[MASK]—dear man !”
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Cave	You can’t argue-----” The soldier flapped the Daily Telegraph viciously. “Quite right, [MASK], you can’t. One can’t argue with a man who has learned to make men. He’s practice, not theory.”
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Trench	You can smite, when you’re on your game.” The winding green current of the course showed below them over the common, with a little red flag blinking here and there. [MASK] turned the car into the private road leading to the clubhouse.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Dixon	She failed again, topping the ball, and her eyes flashed. “Fool! Idiot!” “All right, [MASK]’s foozled his.” “Yes, and look at that. And I want that fat little man’s blood.”
<name>James</name>	James	Frensham	They wound through the fir woods, plunged into the valleys, turning and twisting, with gradients that would challenge any car. [MASK] knew where a track struck off from the lane, ran through an old sandstone quarry, and plunged into a narrow cutting that was darkened overhead by soaring firs.
<name>George</name>	George	Trench	“We have got to be on in two.” She took her brassie, let fly, and hit a skimmer. It struck the ground short of the bunker, bounded, struck the guarding bank, kicked over and ran well on to the green. [MASK] expostulated.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Trix	“Thanks, [MASK]. I’m grateful. You could not have done better.” She gripped his hand, jumped up, and left him, conscious of having done a delicate thing bravely. The responsibility was his, at least that was how she viewed it.
<name>Thorn</name>	Thorn	Frensham	He had come out of the heat of a noon madness into the clean, cool fragrance of a dew-refreshed twilight. As [MASK] neared the Lago Vittoria he found himself walking about twenty paces behind a shortish, thickset man wearing a green slouch hat perched at a certain distinctive angle.
