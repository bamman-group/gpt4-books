<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Godfrey	Still there was just the chance, [MASK] thought, that his father's pride might see this marriage in a light that would induce him to hush it up, rather than turn his son out and make the family the talk of the country for ten miles round.
<name>Henrietta</name>	Henrietta	Nancy	said the voice that predominated over every other within him. "If she is, I may marry [MASK]; and then I shall be a good fellow in future, and have no secrets, and the child--shall be taken care of somehow."
<name>Mr. Poyser</name>	Mr. Poyser	Aaron	"Then, if you think well and good," said [MASK], "I'll come to the Stone-pits this afternoon, and we'll settle what land's to be taken in, and I'll get up an hour earlier
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Eppie	said [MASK], turning away, and stooping to lift rather a large stone. "See, daddy, I can carry this quite well," she said, going along with much energy for a few steps, but presently letting it fall.
<name>unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Marner	Whatever I can do for you will be nothing but paying a debt, even if I looked no further than the robbery. But there are other things I'm beholden--shall be beholden to you for, [MASK]."
<name>Mrs. Medlock</name>	Mrs. Medlock	Aaron	" "That's no reason why you shouldn't have some," said [MASK], "for I can bring you slips of anything; I'm forced to cut no end of 'em when I'm gardening, and throw 'em away mostly.
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Marner	As for the robbery, I count it no loss to me. And if I did, you couldn't help it: you aren't answerable for it." "You may look at it in that way, [MASK], but I never can; and I hope
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dunsey	The sudden alarm pushed him on to take the next step--a very slight impulse suffices for that on a downward road. "Why, sir," he said, trying to speak with careless ease, "it was a little affair between me and [MASK]; it's no matter to anybody else.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dunstan	"Oh, I've swopped with him," said [MASK], whose delight in lying, grandly independent of utility, was not to be diminished by the likelihood that his hearer would not believe him--"Wildfire's mine now."
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Nancy	"Sit down, [MASK]--there," he said, pointing to a chair opposite him. "I came back as soon as I could, to hinder anybody's telling you but me. I've had a great shock--but I care most about the shock it'll be to you."
<name>Eppie</name>	Eppie	Eppie	" "Oh, I'm stronger than you think, daddy," said [MASK]; "and if there wasn't stones enough to go all round, why they'll go part o' the way, and then it'll be easier to get sticks and things for the rest.
<name>Silas Marner</name>	Silas Marner	Marner	Gradually the guineas, the crowns, and the half-crowns grew to a heap, and [MASK] drew less and less for his own wants, trying to solve the problem of keeping himself strong enough to work sixteen hours a-day on as small an outlay as possible.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Nancy	But I won't be over-anxious, and trying to make things out beforehand: I must do my best for the present." With that last thought [MASK] roused herself from her reverie, and turned her eyes again towards the forsaken page.
<name>Mr. Thomas Marvel</name>	Mr. Thomas Marvel	Kimble	But they must turn over a new leaf--_they_ must. What with mortgages and arrears, I'm as short o' cash as a roadside pauper. And that fool [MASK] says the newspaper's talking about peace. Why, the country wouldn't have a leg to stand on.
<name>Doctor</name>	Doctor	Kimble	Found a woman in the snow--and thinks she's dead," he added, speaking low to the Squire. "Better say as little about it as possible: it will shock the ladies. Just tell them a poor woman is ill from cold and hunger. I'll go and fetch [MASK]."
<name>Silas</name>	Silas	Marner	you'll let me act according to my own feeling of what's just. I know you're easily contented: you've been a hard-working man all your life." "Yes, sir, yes," said [MASK], meditatively.
<name>Mr. Wopsle</name>	Mr. Wopsle	Marner	"Who says so?" said [MASK], sharply. "Will they make me take her?" "Why, you wouldn't like to keep her, should you--an old bachelor like you?" "
<name>Black Dog</name>	Black Dog	Jem	"What could I ha' done with his money? I could as easy steal the parson's surplice, and wear it." "Hold your tongue, [MASK], and let's hear what he's got to say," said the landlord.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Godfrey	You'll never think the same of me again," said [MASK], after a little while, with some tremor in his voice. She was silent. "I oughtn't to have left the child unowned: I oughtn't to have kept it from you.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Eppie	"Ah," he said, drawing a long breath, "there's the jail, [MASK]; that's just the same: I aren't afraid now. It's the third turning on the left hand from the jail doors--that's the way we must go."
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Godfrey	That was a feeble evasion, but [MASK] was not fond of lying, and, not being sufficiently aware that no sort of duplicity can long flourish without the help of vocal falsehoods, he was quite unprepared with invented motives. "You don't know?
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Godfrey	I'm sorry you've had such an unlucky partner." "That's very ill-natured of you," said [MASK], standing by her without any sign of intended departure, "to be sorry you've danced with me."
<name>Silas</name>	Silas	Marner	This strangely novel situation of opening his trouble to his Raveloe neighbours, of sitting in the warmth of a hearth not his own, and feeling the presence of faces and voices which were his nearest promise of help, had doubtless its influence on [MASK], in spite of his passionate preoccupation with his loss.
<name>Meg</name>	Meg	Nancy	"I won't mind the world knowing at last. I'll be plain and open for the rest o' my life." "It'll be different coming to us, now she's grown up," said [MASK], shaking her head sadly. "
<name>Mr. Enfield</name>	Mr. Enfield	Silas	"I must have slept," said [MASK]. Then, after a pause, he added, "Or I must have had another visitation like that which you have all seen me under, so that the thief must have come and gone while I was not in the body, but out of the body.
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Nancy	And you'll have the best of mothers in my wife--that'll be a blessing you haven't known since you were old enough to know it." "My dear, you'll be a treasure to me," said [MASK], in her gentle voice.
<name>Nancy</name>	Nancy	Godfrey	"We should agree in that: I give a deal of time to the garden." "Ah, there's plenty of gardening at the Red House," said [MASK], surprised at the difficulty he found in approaching a proposition which had seemed so easy to him in the distance.
<name>Sara</name>	Sara	Silas	So, as I say, I'll come and see to the child for you, and welcome." "Thank you... kindly," said [MASK], hesitating a little. "I'll be glad if you'll tell me things.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Eppie	It seemed to him that the weaver was very selfish (a judgment readily passed by those who have never tested their own power of sacrifice) to oppose what was undoubtedly for [MASK]'s welfare; and he felt himself called upon, for her sake, to assert his authority.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dunsey	"I wouldn't have spent the money myself, but [MASK] bothered me, and I was a fool, and let him have it. But I meant to pay it, whether he did or not. That's the whole story.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Godfrey	Be quick. What has he done with my horse?" "Ah, I thought it was yours, though he pretended you had parted with it to him." "Has he thrown him down and broken his knees?" said [MASK], flushed with exasperation.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Eppie	"Why, me, to be sure, daddy," said [MASK], with dimpling laughter, kissing her father's cheek; "as if he'd want to marry anybody else!" "And you mean to have him, do you?"
<name>Brownie</name>	Brownie	Wildfire	But I mean to stick to [MASK]: I shan't get a better at a fence in a hurry. The mare's got more blood, but she's a bit too weak in the hind-quarters."
<name>Death</name>	Death	Silas	The old man, contrary to expectation, seemed to be on the way to recovery, when one night [MASK], sitting up by his bedside, observed that his usual audible breathing had ceased. The candle was burning low, and he had to lift it to see the patient's face distinctly.
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Silas	I know he would." "Eh, my precious un," said [MASK], "there isn't enough stones to go all round; and as for you carrying, why, wi' your little arms you couldn't carry a stone no bigger than a turnip.
<name>he</name>	he	Silas	The other persons present, however, began to inquire where [MASK] meant to say that the knife was, but he would give no further explanation: he only said, "I am sore stricken; I can say nothing.
<name>Mr. Utterson</name>	Mr. Utterson	Godfrey	That was an evil terror--an ugly inmate to have found a nestling-place in [MASK]'s kindly disposition; but no disposition is a security from evil wishes to a man whose happiness hangs on duplicity. "Hush, hush!"
<name>that frank lady</name>	that frank lady	Priscilla	"I suppose I must go now," he said to [MASK]. "It's no matter to me whether you go or stay," said that frank lady, searching for something in her pocket, with a preoccupied brow.
<name>Mrs. Bumble</name>	Mrs. Bumble	Godfrey	My money's gone, I don't know where--and this is come from I don't know where. I know nothing--I'm partly mazed." "Poor little thing!" said [MASK]. "Let me give something towards finding it clothes."
<name>Mrs. Ramsay</name>	Mrs. Ramsay	Nancy	"Do you think he drowned himself?" said [MASK], almost wondering that her husband should be so deeply shaken by what had happened all those years ago to an unloved brother, of whom worse things had been augured. "
<name>Mr. Tulliver</name>	Mr. Tulliver	Dunstan	But it's my belief you'd sell yourself, if it was only for the pleasure of making somebody feel he'd got a bad bargain." "Aye, aye," said [MASK], very placably, "you do me justice, I see.
<name>Nancy</name>	Nancy	Eppie	" "Oh, no, I shan't," said [MASK], laughing and frisking; "he likes it." "Come, come, let me carry your prayer-book, else you'll be dropping it, jumping i' that way."
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Nancy	When you saw a thing was not meant to be, said [MASK], it was a bounden duty to leave off so much as wishing for it. And so far, perhaps, the wisest of men could scarcely make more than a verbal improvement in her principle.
<name>Eppie</name>	Eppie	Nancy	Still [MASK] was silent, looking down; and he almost expected that she would presently get up and say she would go to her father's. How could she have any mercy for faults that must seem so black to her, with her simple, severe notions?
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Bryce	"Well, to tell you the truth," said [MASK], "after I'd bargained for the horse, it did come into my head that he might be riding and selling the horse without your knowledge, for I didn't believe it was his own.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Eppie	"Oh, I'll tell you, daddy," said [MASK], clasping her hands suddenly, after a minute's thought. "There's lots o' loose stones about, some of 'em not big, and we might lay 'em atop of one another, and make a wall.
<name>Dunstan</name>	Dunstan	Kimble	"It's a nasty business turning out now, eh, [MASK]?" said the Squire. "He might ha' gone for your young fellow--the 'prentice, there--what's his name?"
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Silas	But I told him that wasn't true: for, I said, look at father--he's never been married." "No, child," said [MASK], "your father was a lone man till you was sent to him." "
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Godfrey	[MASK] was silent. He was not likely to be very penetrating in his judgments, but he had always had a sense that his father's indulgence had not been kindness, and had had a vague longing for some discipline that would have checked his own errant weakness and helped his better will.
<name>Silas Marner</name>	Silas Marner	Dunstan	"Make your tender heart easy," said [MASK], opening the door. "You never knew me see double when I'd got a bargain to make; it 'ud spoil the fun. Besides, whenever I fall, I'm warranted to fall on my legs."
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Marner	When [MASK]'s sensibility returned, he continued the action which had been arrested, and closed his door, unaware of the chasm in his consciousness, unaware of any intermediate change, except that the light had grown dim, and that he was chilled and faint.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Silas	[MASK] was still looking at his friend. Suddenly a deep flush came over his face, and he was about to speak impetuously, when he seemed checked again by some inward shock, that sent the flush back and made him tremble.
<name>Eustacia</name>	Eustacia	Nancy	He paused, dreading the effect of his confession. But [MASK] sat quite still, only that her eyes dropped and ceased to meet his. She was pale and quiet as a meditative statue, clasping her hands on her lap. "
<name>she</name>	she	Eppie	He half-expected that this would be shock enough, and that [MASK] would begin to cry. But instead of that, she began to shake herself on his knee, as if the proposition opened a pleasing novelty.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Godfrey	"Think! why haven't you the courage to ask her? Do you stick to it, you want to have _her_--that's the thing?" "There's no other woman I want to marry," said [MASK], evasively. "
<name>John</name>	John	Godfrey	Many men would have been very angry with me for standing out against their wishes; and they might have thrown out that they'd had ill-luck in marrying me; but [MASK] has never been the man to say me an unkind word.
<name>Abel</name>	Abel	Jem	"I was wrong," he said--"yes, yes--I ought to have thought. There's nothing to witness against you, [MASK]. Only you'd been into my house oftener than anybody else, and so you came into my head.
<name>John</name>	John	Bryce	"Why, hasn't he been home yet?" said [MASK]. "Home? no. What has happened? Be quick. What has he done with my horse?" "Ah, I thought it was yours, though he pretended you had parted with it to him."
<name>Mock Turtle</name>	Mock Turtle	Dunsey	said [MASK], in a mocking tone. "You're my elders and betters, you know; I was obliged to come when you sent for me." "Why, this is what I want--and just shake yourself sober and listen, will you?"
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Eppie	It's the third turning on the left hand from the jail doors--that's the way we must go." "Oh, what a dark ugly place!" said [MASK]. "How it hides the sky! It's worse than the Workhouse.
<name>Seth</name>	Seth	John	And they wouldn't be fur wrong, [MASK]." After this feeble delusive thaw, the silence set in as severely as before. "Was it a red Durham?" said the farrier, taking up the thread of discourse after the lapse of a few minutes.
<name>Silas</name>	Silas	Godfrey	"She's dead, I think--dead in the snow at the Stone-pits--not far from my door." [MASK] felt a great throb: there was one terror in his mind at that moment: it was, that the woman might _not_ be dead.
<name>him</name>	him	Solomon	But them things are dying out, as I tell [MASK] every time he comes round; there's no voices like what there used to be, and there's nobody remembers what we remember, if it isn't the old crows."
<name>Silas Marner</name>	Silas Marner	Silas	Every man's work, pursued steadily, tends in this way to become an end in itself, and so to bridge over the loveless chasms of his life. [MASK]'s hand satisfied itself with throwing the shuttle, and his eye with seeing the little squares in the cloth complete themselves under his effort.
<name>Henrietta</name>	Henrietta	Nancy	The longer the interval, the more chance there was of deliverance from some, at least, of the hateful consequences to which he had sold himself; the more opportunities remained for him to snatch the strange gratification of seeing [MASK], and gathering some faint indications of her lingering regard.
<name>Silas</name>	Silas	Godfrey	"O [MASK]!" she said, with compassion in her tone, for she had immediately reflected that the dishonour must be felt still more keenly by her husband. "There was the money in the pit," he continued--"all the weaver's money.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Kench	But if there's to be any jealousy and en_vy_ing about going to [MASK]'s in the rain, let them go as like it--you won't get me to go, I can tell you." By the landlord's intervention, however, the dispute was accommodated.
<name>Tess</name>	Tess	Michaelmas	And as for staying tea, I can't hear of it; for there's this dairymaid, now she knows she's to be married, turned [MASK], she'd as lief pour the new milk into the pig-trough as into the pans.
<name>Rip Van Winkle</name>	Rip Van Winkle	Silas	[MASK], bewildered by the changes thirty years had brought over his native place, had stopped several persons in succession to ask them the name of this town, that he might be sure he was not under a mistake about it.
<name>Mr. Durbeyfield</name>	Mr. Durbeyfield	Godfrey	Her imagination had darted backward in conjectures, and forward in previsions, of what this revealed fatherhood implied; and there were words in [MASK]'s last speech which helped to make the previsions especially definite. Not that these thoughts, either of past or future, determined her
<name>England</name>	England	Raveloe	Even if any brain in [MASK] had put the said two facts together, I doubt whether a combination so injurious to the prescriptive respectability of a family with a mural monument and venerable tankards, would not have been suppressed as of unsound tendency.
<name>Sikes</name>	Sikes	Silas	"Two hundred and seventy-two pounds, twelve and sixpence, last night when I counted it," said [MASK], seating himself again, with a groan. "Pooh! why, they'd be none so heavy to carry. Some tramp's been in,
<name>Darcy</name>	Darcy	Godfrey	With your pride and your father's, you'd have hated having anything to do with me after the talk there'd have been." "I can't say what I should have done about that, [MASK]. I should never have married anybody else.
<name>Ham Peggotty</name>	Ham Peggotty	Dowlas	"Aye, but there's this in it, [MASK]," said the landlord, speaking in a tone of much candour and tolerance. "There's folks, i' my opinion, they can't see ghos'es, not if they stood as plain as a pike-staff before 'em.
<name>Silas Marner</name>	Silas Marner	Silas	"I'll tell one o' the girls to fetch it." "No--no--I can't part with it, I can't let it go," said [MASK], abruptly. "It's come to me--I've a right to keep it."
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Jem	Give it me back, and I'll let you--I'll let you have a guinea." "Me stole your money!" said [MASK], angrily. "I'll pitch this can at your eye if you talk o' _my_ stealing your money."
<name>Edwin</name>	Edwin	Silas	Had he put his gold somewhere else, by a sudden resolution last night, and then forgotten it? A man falling into dark waters seeks a momentary footing even on sliding stones; and [MASK], by acting as if he believed in false hopes, warded off the moment of despair.
<name>St. Monday</name>	St. Monday	Cliff	It 'ud be fine fun for a man to win his bet as he'd catch the rheumatise. Folks as believe in [MASK]'s Holiday aren't agoing to ventur near it for a matter o' ten pound."
<name>Uriah</name>	Uriah	Winthrop	[MASK], if you'll bring me any proof as I'm in the wrong, I'm not the man to say I won't alter. But there's people set up their own ears for a standard, and expect the whole choir to follow 'em.
<name>Silas</name>	Silas	Eppie	We shall do very well--[MASK] and me 'ull do well enough. There's few working-folks have got so much laid by as that. I don't know what it is to gentlefolks, but I look upon it as a deal--almost too much.
<name>Uncle Tom</name>	Uncle Tom	Silas	The porridge, sweetened with some dry brown sugar from an old store which he had refrained from using for himself, stopped the cries of the little one, and made her lift her blue eyes with a wide quiet gaze at [MASK], as he put the spoon into her mouth.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Nancy	It's been "I will" and "I won't" with me all my life--I'll make sure of myself now." [MASK]'s utmost dread had returned. The eyes of the husband and wife met with awe in them, as at a crisis which suspended affection.
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Dunstan	A dull mind, once arriving at an inference that flatters a desire, is rarely able to retain the impression that the notion from which the inference started was purely problematic. And [MASK]'s mind was as dull as the mind of a possible felon usually is.
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Godfrey	"I began to get--" She paused abruptly, for [MASK] was laying down his hat with trembling hands, and turned towards her with a pale face and a strange unanswering glance, as if he saw her indeed, but saw her as part of a scene invisible to herself.
<name>Tony</name>	Tony	Godfrey	"It's just like you," [MASK] burst out, in a bitter tone, "to talk about my selling Wildfire in that cool way--the last thing I've got to call my own, and the best bit of horse-flesh I ever had in my life.
<name>Dimmesdale</name>	Dimmesdale	Marner	But while opinion concerning him had remained nearly stationary, and his daily habits had presented scarcely any visible change, [MASK]'s inward life had been a history and a metamorphosis, as that of every fervid nature must be when it has fled, or been condemned, to solitude.
<name>Dr. Jekyll</name>	Dr. Jekyll	Silas	During [MASK]'s absence in the daytime the door had been locked, and there had been no marks of any inroad on his return by daylight. And in the evening, too, he said to himself, everything was the same as when he had left it.
<name>Silas</name>	Silas	Silas	She held [MASK]'s hand in hers, and grasped it firmly--it was a weaver's hand, with a palm and finger-tips that were sensitive to such pressure--while she spoke with colder decision than before.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Godfrey	And you've got a good-natured brother, who'll keep your secret well, because you'll be so very obliging to him." "I'll tell you what it is," said [MASK], quivering, and pale again, "my patience is pretty near at an end.
<name>Eowyn</name>	Eowyn	Eppie	He delivered this box into [MASK]'s charge when she had grown up, and she often opened it to look at the ring: but still she thought hardly at all about the father of whom it was the symbol.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Aaron	"There's lots o' loose stones about, some of 'em not big, and we might lay 'em atop of one another, and make a wall. You and me could carry the smallest, and [MASK] 'ud carry the rest--I know he would."
<name>Priscilla</name>	Priscilla	Eppie	But I can't leave my father, nor own anybody nearer than him. And I don't want to be a lady--thank you all the same" (here [MASK] dropped another curtsy). "I couldn't give up the folks I've been used to."
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Marner	and so I went in to where the company was." The child, no longer distracted by the bright light and the smiling women's faces, began to cry and call for "mammy", though always clinging to [MASK], who had apparently won her thorough confidence.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bob	"I haven't a shilling to bless myself with. And it's a lie that you'd slip into my place: you'd get yourself turned out too, that's all. For if you begin telling tales, I'll follow. [MASK]'s my father's favourite--you know
<name>Silas</name>	Silas	Silas	For joy is the best of wine, and [MASK]'s guineas were a golden wine of that sort. He rose and placed his candle unsuspectingly on the floor near his loom, swept away the sand without noticing any change, and removed the bricks.
<name>Dickon</name>	Dickon	Aaron	"My little old daddy! I'm so glad. I don't think I shall want anything else when we've got a little garden; and I knew [MASK] would dig it for us," she went on with roguish triumph--"I knew that very well."
<name>weave</name>	weave	Dunstan	That was an interesting idea to [MASK], carrying consequences of entire novelty. If the weaver was dead, who had a right to his money? Who would know where his money was hidden? _Who would know that anybody had come to take it away?
<name>Flush</name>	Flush	Snuff	Though, for his own part, he did not care a button for cock-fighting. [MASK], the brown spaniel, who had placed herself in front of him, and had been watching him for some time, now jumped up in impatience for the expected caress.
<name>friend</name>	friend	Marner	But you're getting rather past such close work, [MASK]: it's time you laid by and had some rest. You look a good deal pulled down, though you're not an old man, _are_ you?"
<name>Mr. Ralph Smith</name>	Mr. Ralph Smith	Anxiety	"But money is wanted in another quarter," said [MASK], in a louder voice, "and how will you get it without selling your mother's diamond pin? And if you don't get it...?" "Well, but something may happen to make things easier.
