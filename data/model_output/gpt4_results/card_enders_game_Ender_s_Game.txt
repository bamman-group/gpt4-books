<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Ender	Sometimes he caught on fire. Sometimes he fell in and drowned. Sometimes he fell out, turned green, and rotted away. It was always ghastly, and the Giant always laughed. [MASK] knew that whatever he chose he would die. The game was rigged.
<name>Bink</name>	Bink	Ender	He found a path, which soon became an ancient brick road, much overgrown with weeds but still usable. There were hints of possible games off to either side, but [MASK] followed none of them. He wanted to see where the path led.
<name>John</name>	John	Ender	[MASK] turned back to the door and tried again to open it. “All right,” he said, giving up. “Why’s the door locked?” The old man continued to look at him blankly.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Bean	Why else would they break down the training system like this, wreck the game the way they did? Why else would they put a little kid like me in command of an army? [MASK] wondered about it as he walked back down the corridor to his own bed.
<name>He</name>	He	Ender	A pickup game, shooting balls at a hoop, dribbling down the corridors until the peace officers confiscated your ball. We had a great time. He was teaching me how to dribble when I was taken.” [MASK] remembered his own brother, and the memory was not fond.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Peter	“So it’s back to the way it was before.” “A few changes. The shields make it so nobody bothers with nuclear weapons anymore. We have to kill each other thousands at a time instead of millions.” [MASK] grinned.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Ender	“Took you long enough. You have a battle today.” So [MASK] got up and fought the battle and won it. But there was no second battle that day, and they let him go to bed earlier. His hands were shaking as he undressed.
<name>She</name>	She	Valentine	I like the way he thinks. I’m surprised he isn’t in the major nets—I looked for him in the international relations debates and you know, he’s never taken part in any of them.” [MASK] lost her appetite and left the table.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Mazer	“True.” “And the gravity is going to affect fuel levels—cheaper to go down than up.” “Yes.” “Does the Little Doctor work against a planet?” [MASK]’s face went rigid.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Alai	“We’re supposed to attack where we outnumber them.” “In this simulation they obviously don’t know what our weapons can do. It’ll only work once, but let’s make it spectacular. Fire at will.” [MASK] did.
<name>Orpheus</name>	Orpheus	Mazer	But he did not believe it. In his conscious mind he knew it was true, but in other places, deeper places, he doubted that they needed him. [MASK]’s urgency was just another trick. Just another way to make me do what they want me to do.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Bonzo	[MASK] was giving his instructions. “A take the handles and go up. B left, C right, D down.” He saw that the toons were oriented to follow instructions, then added, “And you, pinprick, wait four minutes, then come just inside the door.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Ender	Hey, can you believe it? We won the war. We were so eager to grow up so we could fight in it, and it was us all the time. I mean, we’re kids, [MASK]. And it was us.”
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Ender	All he was sure of was that he was eager for battle. Most armies needed three months because they had to memorize dozens of elaborate formations. We’re ready now. Get us into battle. The door opened in darkness. [MASK] listened. A shuffling step.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Ender	Go call him in." “Yes sir. I’ll be back with him in fifteen minutes.” “Good-bye. Yes sir yessir yezzir. I hope you had fun, I hope you had a nice, nice time being happy, [MASK].
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Dap	[MASK] came to the door that night and moved quietly among the beds, touching a hand here, a forehead there. Where he went there was more cryipg, not less. The touch of kindness in this frightening place was enough to push some over the edge into tears.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Peter	Better to torture squirrels than other children. [MASK] has always been a husbandman of pain, planting it, nurturing it, devouring it greedily when it was ripe; better he should take it in these small, sharp doses than with dull cruelty to children in the school.
<name>John</name>	John	Andrew	the nurse asked. [MASK] could not remember how to speak. They lifted him onto the table. They checked his pulse, did other things; he did not understand it all. The doctor was trembling; his voice shook as he spoke.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Bean	I’ve never had less than five hits in a battle. I’ve also completed every assignment I’ve been given.” “Why did they make you a soldier so young, [MASK]?” “No younger than you were.” “But why?”
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Dink	He doesn’t know why anybody wins or loses. Nobody does.” “It doesn’t mean he’s crazy. [MASK].” “I know, you’ve been here a year, you think these people are normal. Well, they’re not.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Demosthenes	I saw to it that he was amply rewarded. He’ll have all the money he ever needs.” “If they ever let him come back to use it.” “They never will.” “With [MASK] agitating for him to come home?”
<name>Rearden</name>	Rearden	Peter	They used throwaway names with their early efforts, not the identities that [MASK] planned to make famous and influential. Of course they were not invited to take part in the great national and international political forums—they could only be audiences there until they were invited or elected to take part.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Graff	“But they might blame [MASK]. After all this is over, the civilians can rake over our files and decide what was right and what was not Give us medals where they think we were right, take away our pensions and put us in jail where they decide we were wrong.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Demosthenes	The boy is fourteen, the girl is twelve.” “Which one is [MASK]?” “The girl. The twelve-year-old.” "Pardon me. I don’t really think it’s funny, but I can’t help but laugh.
<name>Bean</name>	Bean	Ender	“You better watch him, day and night. You better be there.” “[MASK] and I aren’t stupid. We scored as well as you did on everything. Better on some things. We’re all such wonderfully bright children.
<name>Forrester</name>	Forrester	Ender	Would you bet the human race on the chance of them giving up and leaving us alone?” [MASK] tried to grasp the amounts of time that had gone by. “And the ships have been traveling for seventy years—” “Some of them.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Peter	The fact that they did not want her to discuss this with [MASK] suggested that perhaps they knew the difference between them. She did not stop to wonder whether she herself knew the difference anymore. “You said he built the raft. How long has he been here?”
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Ender	Worst of all, though, was the number of people. [MASK] had no important memories of the scale of the cities of Earth. His idea of a comfortable number of people was the Battle School, where he had known by sight every person who dwelt there.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Ender	He put on the mask. It closed him in like a hand pressed tight against his face. But this isn’t how it feels to be a bugger, thought [MASK]. They don’t wear this face like a mask, it is their face.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Ender	The old man continued to look at him blankly. So this is a game, thought [MASK]. Well, if they want me to go to class, they’ll unlock the door. If they don’t, they won’t. I don’t care.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Ender	“I changed my mind, pinprick. Maybe by practicing with your Launchies you’ll learn something, and I can trade you easier. Anything to get rid of you faster.” “Thank you, sir,” [MASK] said.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Ender	So everything depends on how you push off, the course you set when you start. It means we’re going to have to get very good at controlling our launches and rebounds or we’re all going to end up floating around in the middle of nowhere. [MASK] looked around the room.
<name>Bean</name>	Bean	Petra	He figured that after a few more battles, she’d realize that in fact she had scored more hits against him than he expected anyone ever would again. And he was still learning from her. In practice today he would teach his toon leaders how to counter the tricks [MASK] had played on them.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Ender	The computer-controlled enemy was devious and powerful, and whenever [MASK] tried a tactic he found the computer using it against him within minutes. The game was a holographic display, and his fighter was represented only by a tiny light.
<name>Sebastian</name>	Sebastian	Bean	Instead he noticed how very tired [MASK] looked, his whole body bent with weariness, his eyes dark from lack of sleep; and yet his skin was still soft and translucent, the skin of a child, the soft curved cheek, the slender limbs of a little boy.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Ender	These were not pieced together from the censored public videos, but whole and continuous. Since many videos were working in the major battles, they studied bugger tactics and strategies from many angles. For the first time in his life, a teacher was pointing out things that [MASK] had not already seen for himself.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Ender	In the meantime, [MASK] was mentally grouping them into slow learners and fast learners. The littlest kid, the one who had been last out of the door, was the first to arrive at the correct wall, and he caught himself adroitly.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Shen	[MASK] closed his eyes and assumed a look of blissful meditation. “Haven’t you heard?” said another boy, a Launchy from a younger group. “Word’s out that any Launchy who comes to your practice sessions won’t ever amount to anything in anybody’s army.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Ender	He came straight to [MASK] and held out his hand. “You made the hard choice, boy. All or nothing. End them or end us. But heaven knows there was no other way you could have done it.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Graff	“Anyway, [MASK], it was a great relief to us. I know we quarreled, and I know the prosecution used tapes of our conversations against you. But by then I knew that you were right, and I offered to testify for you.”
<name>Honor</name>	Honor	Ender	If their style of fighting were not right for the situation they were placed in, [MASK] would not have chosen them for that assignment. The trust was complete, the working of the fleet quick and responsive. And at the end of three weeks.
<name>Bean</name>	Bean	Dink	“They’ll ice him, though,” [MASK] said. “Everybody knows he started it. I saw them get up and leave the commanders’ mess. Took me a couple of seconds to realize you weren’t there, either, and then a minute more to find out where you had gone.
<name>Orson</name>	Orson	Mazer	“If you hadn’t killed the queen. [MASK], would we have lost the war?” “I’d say the odds would have been three to two against us. I still think I could have trashed their fleet pretty badly before they burned us out.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Ender	“Really? And I’ve already commended you in your official report.” “It’s too strong. It makes that other little bastard into a hero. It could screw up training for a lot of kids. I thought [MASK] might call for help.”
<name>Valentine</name>	Valentine	Val	Game or not, though, it might also be true. And so he would work as hard as possible. It was what [MASK] had wanted of him. Five years. Only five years until the fleet arrives, and I don’t know anything yet.
<name>Peewee</name>	Peewee	Ender	It began to get to a few of the boys. “Listen to them,” [MASK] said to the other boys. “Remember the words. If you ever want to make your enemy crazy, shout that kind of stuff at them.
<name>Hardy</name>	Hardy	Peter	“They don’t publish their troop movements, [MASK].” “Of course not. But they do publish their passenger and freight train schedules. I’ve had my desk analyzing those schedules and figuring out when the secret troop trains are moving over the same tracks.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Ender	[MASK] meant to shower right away, but he was also tired. He lay down on his bed in his flash suit, just for a moment, and woke up at the beginning of lunchtime. So much for his idea of studying more about the buggers this morning.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Bean	Deadlines were sometimes kilometers long. This one was just a bit longer than a wall of the battleroom, and yet it looped easily, almost invisibly, around [MASK]’s waist. He pulled it off like an article of clothing and handed one end to one of his soldiers.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Ender	From now on you are always about to lose.” The old man’s face grew serious again. ‘‘You will be about to lose, [MASK], but you will win. You will learn to defeat the enemy. He will teach you how.”
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Ender	“It’s already too late for that.” “You’re wrong, [MASK]. You think you’re grown up and tired and jaded with everything, but in your heart you’re just as much a kid as I am. We can keep it secret from everybody else.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Wiggin	So he did. “That was three rules. We don’t do too good in math, here.” The message was clear. Winning is more important than anything. “Your practice sessions with half-assed little Launchies are over, [MASK]. Done.
<name>Alanna</name>	Alanna	Bean	That you have to go down seventeen places to find a soldier who isn’t a Dragon?” “What if I can’t think of anything?” “Then I was wrong about you.” [MASK] grinned. “You weren’t wrong.”
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Peter	We don’t talk like other children. And above all, we don’t write like other children.” “For a discussion that began with death threats, [MASK], we’ve strayed from the topic, I think.”
<name>he</name>	he	Ender	Then he shuddered and realized he had been wrong. Still, it was the same situation, and this time they wouldn’t sit still for a single combat settlement. There was no leader, as far as [MASK] knew, and these boys were a lot bigger than him.
<name>Grady</name>	Grady	Rabbit	He was a pretty good soldier, and [MASK] has done fairly well in the standings over the years. But I expect to see formations, and so I’m not worried.” At 0650 he made them all lie down on the mats and relax.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Wiggin	“How old are you, [MASK]?” he asked. “Almost seven.” Still quietly, he said, “I asked how old you are, not how old you almost are.” “I am six years, nine months, and twelve days old.”
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Wiggin	It made little sound, for only his fingernails had hit her. But there were bright red marks, four of them, on her cheek, and little pricks of blood marked where the tips of his fingernails had struck. “Here are your instructions, [MASK].
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Peter	She had seen a squirrel half-skinned, spiked by its little hands and feet with twigs pushed into the dirt. She pictured [MASK] trapping it, staking it, then carefully parting and peeling back the skin without breaking into the abdomen, watching the muscles twist and ripple.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Bean	[MASK] pushed off at great speed, in a line almost parallel to the door; when he reached the comer of the room, he pushed off again and rocketed straight out toward the enemy. The spots of light on the wall showed that the enemy was shooting at him.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Ender	The small rug before the fire unraveled itself into a long, slender serpent with wicked teeth. “I am your only escape,” it said. “Death is your only escape.” [MASK] looked around the room for a weapon, when suddenly the screen went dark.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Ender	“If [MASK] isn’t the one, if his peak of military brilliance does not coincide with the arrival of our fleet at the bugger homeworlds, then it doesn’t really matter what our training method is or isn’t."
<name>Lockwood</name>	Lockwood	Petra	“These are the mysteries,” [MASK] said in a deep whisper. “Do not pry into them. Terrible things happened to the last soldier who tried. He was discovered hanging by his feet from the ceiling of the bathroom, with his head stuffed in the toilet.”
<name>Stewart</name>	Stewart	Peter	At first [MASK] insisted that they be deliberately inflammatory. “We can’t learn how our style of writing is working unless we get responses—and if we’re bland, no one will answer.” They were not bland, and people answered.
<name>Miles</name>	Miles	Ender	A reminder that they were both far from home. It took some of the fun out of having mastered a bit of navigation. [MASK] took his pistol and demonstrated what he had learned about the two thumb buttons. “What does it do when you aim at a person?”
<name>Petra</name>	Petra	Ender	At least they did me one favor—none of my soldiers is older than me. As soon as each soldier had a bunk, [MASK] ordered them to put on their flash suits and come to practice. “We’re on the morning schedule, straight to practice after breakfast.
<name>Bonzo</name>	Bonzo	Bonzo	All his crimes weighed heavy on him, the deaths of Stil-son and [MASK] no heavier and no lighter than the rest. And so, with that burden, he waited through the empty months until the world that he had saved decided he could come home.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Petra	So he was to be a nothing. He hoped the trade happened soon. He also noticed that [MASK] did not so much as cry out in pain, or touch her cheek, though one spot of blood had beaded and run, making a streak down to her jaw.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Ender	“Knowing what to do with a toon is easy,” [MASK] said. “It’s getting them to do it that’s hard. Why would any soldier want to follow a little pinprick like you?” “They used to call you that, I hear.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Ender	Suddenly a pain stabbed through him like a needle from his neck to his groin. [MASK] felt his back spasm, and his body arched violently backward; his head struck the bed. He could feel his legs thrashing, and his hands were clenching each other, wringing each other so tightly that they arched.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Anderson	“Of course not. I haven’t assembled his army yet.” “Oh, so you’re slacking it that way, too?” “You’re getting too close to the game, [MASK]. You’re forgetting that it is merely a training exercise.”
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Humanity	But you see, he doesn’t seem interested in going on with his education.” “Oh. So I’m therapy again.” “This time we can’t censor your letter. We’re just taking our chances. We need your brother badly. [MASK] is on the cusp.”
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Graff	And he carried it further, imagining that [MASK] was actually hanging upside down from the center aisle, and then picturing him sticking straight out from a side wall. Gravity could go any which way. However I want it to go.
<name>John</name>	John	Ender	He went through a relaxing exercise as he leaned on the door, and soon he was calm again. The old man continued to watch him impassively. It seemed to go on for hours, [MASK] refusing to speak, the old man seeming to be a mindless mute.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Valentine	Has he done something crazy? I thought he stopped doing crazy things. “[MASK], you seem frightened. There’s no need to be. Please, sit down. I assure you that your brother is well. He has more than fulfilled our expectations.”
<name>Graff</name>	Graff	Graff	“You didn’t lie.” “I won’t lie now, either,” said [MASK]. “My job isn’t to be friends. My job is to produce the best soldiers in the world. In the whole history of the world.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Peter	I grind them and grind them until they don’t exist.” “Of course you don’t.” And now the fear came again, worse than before. [MASK] has mellowed, but you, they’ve made you into a killer.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ender	“I was trying to. What’s the thumping?” “There’s a war going on here. Our section is blacked out to keep us safe.” [MASK] swung his legs out to sit up. He couldn’t do it, though.
<name>Artemis</name>	Artemis	Abra	[MASK] was pointing downward. “Can you believe this?” he asked. The hill was hollow. A deep depression in the middle, partially filled with water, was ringed by concaye slopes that cantilevered dangerously over the water.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Ender	Me not laughing. He toyed with the idea of trying to be like the other boys. But he couldn’t think of any jokes, and none of theirs seemed funny. Wherever their laughter came from, [MASK] couldn’t find such a place in himself.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Ender	I’m not a prophet.” “I wish I could tell you everything about [MASK]’s situation. But it would take hours, maybe days, and afterward I’d have to put you in protective confinement because so much of it is strictly confidential.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Ender	[MASK] spoke as the old man walked to the door. “You’re too old to be a student.” “One is never too old to be a student of the enemy. I have learned from the buggers. You will learn from me.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Valentine	“And you’re afraid. Why are you afraid?” “I don’t like questions about my family. Just leave my family out of this.” “[MASK], I’m trying to leave your family out of this.
<name>Alai</name>	Alai	Bean	“It’s really dim,” said [MASK], “but light enough you can’t follow people easily by the lights on their suits. Worst possible for seeing. It’s all open space from this star to the enemy side of the room.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Graff	One day, eating a meal with [MASK], he asked, “Is that all the simulator does?” “Is what all?” “The way it plays now. It’s easy, and it hasn’t got any harder for a while.”
<name>Bean</name>	Bean	Bean	As a tripwire it wasn’t too useful, [MASK] decided. It was invisible enough, but one strand of twine wouldn’t have much chance of stopping an enemy that could easily go above or below it. Then he got the idea of using it to change his direction of movement in midair.
<name>Reynolds</name>	Reynolds	Ender	Can we at least take a leak first? “No more than a decaliter.” They laughed. The ones who didn’t sleep naked stripped down; everyone bundled up their flash suits and followed [MASK] at a jog through the corridors to the gym.
<name>Trina</name>	Trina	Ender	Instead, it was a new panel of levers, and a small headset with earphones and a small microphone. The technician who was waiting there quickly explained, how to wear the headset. “But how do I control the ships?” asked [MASK].
<name>Al</name>	Al	Mazer	“Now leave me alone.” “That’s why we’re here,” [MASK] said. “We’re trying to tell you. They’re not through with you, not at all. It’s crazy down there. They’re going to start a war.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Ender	I was defending myself. I bore it a long time. I was patient. I’m not what he said. A voice over the speaker told them they were approaching the school; it took twenty minutes to decelerate and dock. [MASK] lagged behind the others.
<name>They</name>	They	Salamander	What mattered, however, was that [MASK] felt defeated. They had surrendered the initiative completely. Though they were still fairly evenly matched with the enemy, they huddled together like the last survivors of a massacre, as if they hoped the enemy would overlook them in the carnage.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Ender	“I’m telling you things that you can’t know, by the way, if you’re ever going to leave I.F. Command. Before the war’s over.” [MASK] was angry. “If you know me at all, you know I can keep a secret.”
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Ender	No one would be late again if he could help it. In the corridors leading to the battleroom, [MASK] made them run back and forth in the halls, fast, so they were sweating a little, while the naked ones got dressed.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Bean	The lights went out. “Can you find your way back, [MASK]?” “Probably not.” “Then stay here. If you listen very carefully, you can hear the good fairy come in the night and leave our assignment for tomorrow.”
<name>Artemisia</name>	Artemisia	Bean	He had to have a well-trained army, and that meant drilling the soldiers over and over again, long after they thought they had mastered a technique, until it was so natural to them that they didn’t have to think about it anymore. But what was this thing with [MASK]?
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Ender	[MASK] ate no breakfast. He wasn’t hungry. Instead he went to the bathroom and showered, putting his flash suit in the cleaner so it would be ready when he was dried off. He washed himself twice and let the water run and run on him.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Valentine	“[MASK] loves me.” “With all her heart. Completely, unstintingly, she’s devoted to you, and you adore her. I told you it wouldn’t be easy.” “What is it like, there?” “Hard work.
<name>secrets</name>	secrets	Salaam	Did I laugh? Did I join in? Just stood there, watching, like a teacher. That’s how they think of me, too. Teacher. Legendary soldier. Not one of them. Not someone that you embrace and whisper [MASK] in his ear.
<name>Hal</name>	Hal	Ender	The perspective was close to the enemy planet now, as the ship hurtled into its well of gravity. Surely it’s in range now, thought [MASK]. It must be in range and the computer can’t handle it.
<name>Napoleon</name>	Napoleon	Ender	It was his old army, the one he had left less than four weeks before, and he knew their formations backward and forward. Partly because of [MASK]’s influence, they were the most flexible of armies, responding relatively quickly to new situations.
