<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Mary	[MASK] visited the continent, and sought health in different climates; but her nerves were not to be restored to their former state. She then retired to her house in the country, established manufactories, threw the estate into small farms; and continually employed herself this way to dissipate care, and banish unavailing regret.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Mary	To her house [MASK] directed the coach, and told the unfortunate mother of her loss. The poor woman, oppressed by it, and her many other cares, after an inundation of tears, began to enumerate all her past misfortunes, and present cares.
<name>Mr. Bronte</name>	Mr. Bronte	Ann	In one thing there seemed to be a sympathy between them, for she wrote formal answers to his as formal letters. An extreme dislike took root in her mind; the found of his name made her turn sick; but she forgot all, listening to [MASK]'s cough, and supporting her languid frame.
<name>Mrs. Flintwinch</name>	Mrs. Flintwinch	Mary	This ingratitude hurt her, as did a similar instance in the woman who came out of the ship. [MASK] had hitherto supported her; as her finances were growing low, she hinted to her, that she ought to try to earn her own subsistence: the woman in return loaded her with abuse.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Henry	[MASK] had not attempted to interrupt her; he saw she was determined, and that these sentiments were not the effusion of the moment, but well digested ones, the result of strong affections, a high sense of honour, and respect for the source of all virtue and truth.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Mary	His taste was just, as it had a standard--Nature, which he observed with a critical eye. [MASK] could not help thinking that in his company her mind expanded, as he always went below the surface. She increased her stock of ideas, and her taste was improved.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Mary	[MASK] would then assiduously try to turn his attention to something else; and when sent out of the room, would watch at the door, until the storm was over, for unless it was, she could not rest.
<name>Handel</name>	Handel	Handel	One of the sailors, happening to say to another, "that he believed the world was going to be at an end;" this observation led her into a new train of thoughts: some of [MASK]'s sublime compositions occurred to her, and she sung them to the grand accompaniment.
<name>Mr. Bingley</name>	Mr. Bingley	Ann	[MASK] then found the ladies not so agreeable; when they sat whole hours together, the thread-bare topics were exhausted; and, but for cards or music, the long evenings would have been yawned away in listless indolence.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Mary	A few months after [MASK] was turned of seventeen, her brother was attacked by a violent fever, and died before his father could reach the school. She was now an heiress, and her mother began to think her of consequence, and did not call her _the child_.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Ann	She loved [MASK] better than any one in the world--to snatch her from the very jaws of destruction--she would have encountered a lion. To have this friend constantly with her; to make her mind easy with respect to her family, would it not be superlative bliss?
<name>Man</name>	Man	Man	[MASK] seems formed for action, though the passions are seldom properly managed; they are either so languid as not to serve as a spur, or else so violent, as to overleap all bounds. "Every individual has its own peculiar trials; and anguish, in one shape or other, visits every heart.
<name>Death</name>	Death	Death	Considering the separation of the soul and body, this night seemed sadly solemn, and the hours long. [MASK] is indeed a king of terrors when he attacks the vicious man! The compassionate heart finds not any comfort; but dreads an eternal separation.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Mary	Amongst the wretched crew was one poor woman, who fainted when she was hauled on board: [MASK] undressed her, and when she had recovered, and soothed her, left her to enjoy the rest she required to recruit her strength, which fear had quite exhausted.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Mary	My [MASK], will you be comforted? Yes, yes, she exclaimed in a firm voice; you go to be happy--I am not a complete wretch! The words almost choked her. He was a long time silent; the opiate produced a kind of stupor.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Henry	[MASK] was afraid to discover his passion, or give any other name to his regard but friendship; yet his anxious solicitude for her welfare was ever breaking out-while she as artlessly expressed again and again, her fears with respect to his declining health.
<name>gentlemen</name>	gentlemen	Henry	She waited for, nay, almost wished for the summons to depart. She could not avoid spending the intermediate time with the ladies and [MASK]; and the trivial conversations she was obliged to bear a part in harassed her more than can be well conceived.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Mary	"I have myself," said he, mournfully, "shaken hands with happiness, and am dead to the world; I wait patiently for my dissolution; but, for thee, [MASK], there may be many bright days in store."
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Mary	He knew men, as well as books; his conversation was entertaining and improving. In [MASK]'s company he doubted whether heaven was peopled with spirits masculine; and almost forgot that he had called the sex "the pretty play things that render life tolerable."
<name>Thomson</name>	Thomson	Thomson	In this retreat she read [MASK]'s Seasons, Young's Night-Thoughts, and Paradise Lost. At a little distance from it were the huts of a few poor fishermen, who supported their numerous children by their precarious labour.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Mary	The heavy tale lasted until midnight, and the impression it made on [MASK]'s mind was so strong, that it banished sleep till towards morning; when tired nature sought forgetfulness, and the soul ceased to ruminate about many things.
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Mary	He saw him soon after his arrival in his native country, and prevented his hastening to enquire into the reasons of [MASK]'s strange conduct. He desired him not to be too precipitate, if he ever wished to possess an invaluable treasure.
<name>Religion</name>	Religion	Christianity	"[MASK] can only afford just principles to govern the wayward feelings and impulses of the heart: every good disposition runs wild, if not transplanted into this soil; but how hard is it to keep the heart diligently, though convinced that the issues of life depend on it.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Mary	He endeavoured to draw [MASK] out, and succeeded; she entered into conversation, and some of her artless flights of genius struck him with surprise; he found she had a capacious mind, and that her reason was as profound as her imagination was lively.
<name>she</name>	she	Henry	They frequently discussed very important subjects, while the rest were singing or playing cards, nor were they observed for doing so, as [MASK], whom they all were pleased with, in the way of gallantry shewed them all more attention than her.
<name>Henrietta</name>	Henrietta	Henry	A delicate sense of propriety prevented her replying; and recalled her bewildered reason.--Assuming, in consequence of her recollection, a more composed manner, she made the intended enquiry, and left the room. [MASK]'s eyes followed her while the females very freely animadverted on her strange behaviour.
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Mary	"I did not," said he, "expect to see thee this evening, my dearest [MASK]; but I was thinking of thee. Heaven has endowed thee with an uncommon portion of fortitude, to support one of the most affectionate hearts in the world.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Henry	Her pure spirit is happy; but what a wretch am I!" [MASK] forgot his cautious reserve. "Would you allow me to call you friend?" said he in a hesitating voice. "I feel, dear girl, the tendered interest in whatever concerns thee."
<name>anyone's</name>	anyone's	Mary	Her intention of leaving that part of the country, had much more weight with him, than [MASK]'s arguments, drawn from motives of philanthropy and friendship; this was a language he did not understand; expressive of occult qualities he never thought of, as they could not be seen or felt.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Mary	The music was uncommonly melodious, "And came stealing on the senses like the sweet south." The well-known sounds reached [MASK] as she sat by her friend--she listened without knowing that she did--and shed tears almost without being conscious of it.
<name>Edmund</name>	Edmund	Ann	Her friendship for [MASK] occupied her heart, and resembled a passion. She had had, indeed, several transient likings; but they did not amount to love. The society of men of genius delighted her, and improved her faculties.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Mary	She was several years older than [MASK], yet her refinement, her taste, caught her eye, and she eagerly sought her friendship: before her return she had assisted the family, which was almost reduced to the last ebb; and now she had another motive to actuate her.
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Mary	She had hitherto treated her with the greatest respect, and concealed her wonder at [MASK]'s choosing a remote room in the house near the garden, and ordering some alterations to be made, as if she intended living in it.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Mary	She returned to her mother--the companion of her youth forgot her, they took no more sweet counsel together. This disappointment spread a sadness over her countenance, and made it interesting. She grew fond of solitude, and her character appeared similar to [MASK]'s, though her natural disposition was very different.
<name>Fanny</name>	Fanny	Mary	[MASK] shrunk back, and was alternately pale and red. A delicate sense of propriety prevented her replying; and recalled her bewildered reason.--Assuming, in consequence of her recollection, a more composed manner, she made the intended enquiry, and left the room.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Ann	no, I do not--thy spirit is not confined to its mouldering tenement! Tell me, thou soul of her I love, tell me, ah! whither art thou fled?" [MASK] occupied her until they reached the ship. The anchor was weighed.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Mary	She often wondered at the books [MASK] chose, who, though she had a lively imagination, would frequently study authors whose works were addressed to the understanding. This liking taught her to arrange her thoughts, and argue with herself, even when under the influence of the most violent passions.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Mary	This accident put a stop to their pleasurable excursions; it had injured him, and brought on the spitting of blood he was subject to--perhaps it was not the cold that he caught, that occasioned it. In vain did [MASK] try to shut her eyes; her fate pursued her!
<name>Fanny</name>	Fanny	Mary	Her cheeks flushed with indignation, so strongly did she feel an emotion of contempt at having been thrown away--given in with an estate. As [MASK] again gave way to hope, her mind was more disengaged; and her thoughts were employed about the objects around her.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Mary	She wished to receive the sacrament with him, as a bond of union which was to extend beyond the grave. She did so, and received comfort from it; she rose above her misery. His end was now approaching. [MASK] sat on the side of the bed.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Mary	Every day almost they saw their new acquaintance; and civility produced intimacy. [MASK] sometimes left her friend with them; while she indulged herself in viewing new modes of life, and searching out the causes which produced them.
<name>my son</name>	my son	Mary	Our affections as well as our sentiments are fluctuating; you will not perhaps always either think or feel as you do at present: the object you now shun may appear in a different light." He paused. "In advising thee in this style, I have only thy good at heart, [MASK]."
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Mary	This friend determined to trust to her native strength of mind, and informed her of the circumstance; but she overrated it: [MASK] was not able, for a few days after the intelligence, to fix on the mode of conduct she ought now to pursue.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Mary	One of the nuns, who had a sweet voice, was singing; [MASK] was struck with awe; her heart joined in the devotion; and tears of gratitude and tenderness flowed from her eyes. My Father, I thank thee!
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Henry	said he in a hesitating voice. "I feel, dear girl, the tendered interest in whatever concerns thee." His eyes spoke the rest. They were both silent a few moments; then [MASK] resumed the conversation. "I have also been acquainted with grief!
<name>Nothing</name>	Nothing	Hamlet	After this account it is scarcely necessary to add, that their minds had received very little cultivation. They were taught French, Italian, and Spanish; English was their vulgar tongue. And what did they learn? [MASK] will tell you--words--words.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Henry	To beguile the tedious time, [MASK]'s favorite tunes were sung; the books they read together turned over; and the short epistle read at least a hundred times.--Any one who had seen her, would have supposed that she was trying to decypher Chinese characters.
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Henry	She durst not encounter [MASK]'s glances when she found he had been informed of her intention; and, trying to draw a veil over her wretched state of mind, she talked incessantly, she knew not what; flashes of wit burst from her, and when she began to laugh she could not stop herself.
<name>Henry Tilney</name>	Henry Tilney	Ann	But these various pursuits did not banish all her cares, or carry off all her constitutional black bile. Before she enjoyed [MASK]'s society, she imagined it would have made her completely happy: she was disappointed, and yet knew not what to complain of.
<name>Miss Williams</name>	Miss Williams	Ann	She then mentioned her intention of going to [MASK]'s relations. "I am her representative, I have duties to fulfil for her: during my voyage I have time enough for reflection; though I think I have already determined."
<name>XXVIII</name>	XXVIII	XIII	The ridiculous ceremonies they were every day witness to, led them into what are termed grave subjects, and made him explain his opinions, which, at other times, he was neither ashamed of, nor unnecessarily brought forward to notice. CHAP. [MASK].
<name>Mr. Knightley</name>	Mr. Knightley	Henry	"Be not too hasty, my child," interrupted [MASK]; "far be it from me to persuade thee to do violence to thy feelings--but consider that all thy future life may probably take its colour from thy present mode of conduct.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Mary	[MASK] rose early, refreshed by the seasonable rest, and went to visit the poor woman, whom she found quite recovered: and, on enquiry, heard that she had lately buried her husband, a common sailor; and that her only surviving child had been washed over-board the day before.
<name>Lucie</name>	Lucie	Mary	And [MASK] _waited_ to see him die. She pressed with trembling eagerness his parched lips--he opened his eyes again; the spreading film retired, and love returned them--he gave a look--it was never forgotten.
<name>she</name>	she	Mary	Her maid, a well-looking girl, had captivated the clerk of a neighbouring compting-house. As the match was an advantageous one, [MASK] could not raise any objection to it, though at this juncture it was very disagreeable to her to have a stranger about her person.
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Mary	"You are going, [MASK], and going by yourself; your mind is not in a state to be left to its own operations--yet I cannot, dissuade you; if I attempted to do it, I should ill deserve the title I wish to merit.
<name>Mary Shelley</name>	Mary Shelley	Mary	Could a life of sensuality be a preparation for a peaceful death? Thus meditating, she passed the still midnight hour by his bedside. The nurse fell asleep, nor did a violent thunder storm interrupt her repose, though it made the night appear still more terrific to [MASK].
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Mary	All [MASK]'s former fears now returned like a torrent, and carried every other care away; she even added to her present anguish by upbraiding herself for her late tranquillity--it haunted her in the form of a crime.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	Young people are mostly fond of scribbling; [MASK] had had very little instruction; but by copying her friend's letters, whose hand she admired, she soon became a proficient; a little practice made her write with tolerable correctness, and her genius gave force to it.
<name>Elinor</name>	Elinor	Mary	During the year of mourning they lived in retirement; music, drawing, and reading, filled up the time; and [MASK]'s taste and judgment were both improved by contracting a habit of observation, and permitting the simple beauties of Nature to occupy her thoughts.
<name>he</name>	he	Henry	She tried to avoid speaking of herself, and [MASK] left her, with, a promise of visiting her the next day. Her mind was now engrossed by one fear--yet she would not allow herself to think that she feared an event she could not name.
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Mary	She had often seen that when a person was unfortunate, [MASK]'s pity might easily be mistaken for love, and, indeed, it was a temporary sensation of that kind. Such it was--why it was so, let others define, I cannot argue against instincts.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Mary	She visited them every day, and procured them every comfort; contrary to her expectation, the woman began to recover; cleanliness and wholesome food had a wonderful effect; and [MASK] saw her rising as it were from the grave.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Mary	After a sleepless, feverish night she had a violent fit of coughing, and burst a blood-vessel. The physician, who was in the house, was sent for, and when he left the patient, [MASK], with an authoritative voice, insisted on knowing his real opinion.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Mary	She pleased his mother; she inchanted him. It was an advantage to [MASK] that friendship first possessed her heart; it opened it to all the softer sentiments of humanity:--and when this first affection was torn away, a similar one sprung up, with a still tenderer sentiment added to it.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Henry	Her heart longed to receive a new guest; there was a void in it: accustomed to have some one to love, she was alone, and comfortless, if not engrossed by a particular affection. [MASK] saw her distress, and not to increase it, left the room.
<name>Fanny</name>	Fanny	Mary	[MASK] was petrified; but soon assuming more courage, approached the bed, and, regardless of the surrounding nastiness, knelt down by the poor wretch, and breathed the most poisonous air; for the unfortunate creature was dying of a putrid fever, the consequence of dirt and want.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Ann	The physician was sent for; his prescription afforded [MASK] a little temporary relief; and they again joined the circle. Unfortunately, the weather happened to be constantly wet for more than a week, and confined them to the house.
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Henry	[MASK] started at the sight of her altered appearance; the day before her complexion had been of the most pallid hue; but now her cheeks were flushed, and her eyes enlivened with a false vivacity, an unusual fire.
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Mary	Just then one of the crew perceived a signal of distress; by the help of a glass he could plainly discover a small vessel dismasted, drifted about, for the rudder had been broken by the violence of the storm. [MASK]'s thoughts were now all engrossed by the crew on the brink of destruction.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Mary	But at last she conquered her disgust, and wrote her _husband_ an account of what had passed since she had dropped his correspondence. He came in person to answer the letter. [MASK] fainted when he approached her unexpectedly.
<name>anyone</name>	anyone	Mary	Taste is unknown; Gothic finery, and unnatural decorations, which they term ornaments, are conspicuous in their churches and dress. Reverence for mental excellence is only to be found in a polished nation. Could the contemplation of such a people gratify [MASK]'s heart?
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Mary	CHAP. XXIV. [MASK] still continued weak and low, though it was spring, and all nature began to look gay; with more than usual brightness the sun shone, and a little robin which she had cherished during the winter sung one of his best songs.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Mary	The third day [MASK] was desired to prepare herself; for if the wind continued in the same point, they should set sail the next evening. She tried to prepare her mind, and her efforts were not useless she appeared less agitated than could have been expected, and talked of her voyage with composure.
<name>Fanny</name>	Fanny	Mary	[MASK] now enjoyed the melancholy pleasure of nursing him, and softened by her tenderness the pains she could not remove. Every sigh did she stifle, every tear restrain, when he could see or hear them. She would boast of her resignation--yet catch eagerly at the least ray of hope.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Mary	There is a solemnity in the shortest ejaculation, which, for a while, stills the tumult of passion. [MASK]'s mind had been thrown off its poise; her devotion had been, perhaps, more fervent for some time past; but less regular.
<name>Fanny</name>	Fanny	Mary	[MASK] had not said much, for she was diffident; she seldom joined in general conversations; though her quickness of penetration enabled her soon to enter into the characters of those she conversed with; and her sensibility made her desirous of pleasing every human creature.
<name>John Keats</name>	John Keats	Milton	The governing affection gives its stamp to the rest--because I am capable of loving one, I have that kind of charity to all my fellow-creatures which is not easily provoked. [MASK] has asserted, That earthly love is the scale by which to heavenly we may ascend."
<name>a lady</name>	a lady	Mary	It was crowded with inhabitants: som were scolding, others swearing, or singing indecent songs. What a sight for [MASK]! Her blood ran cold; yet she had sufficient resolution to mount to the top of the house.
<name>someone</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	someone (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	Ann	He had exerted himself to turn her thoughts into a new channel, and had succeeded; she thought of him till she began to chide herself for defrauding the dead, and, determining to grieve for [MASK], she dwelt on
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Mary	[MASK], who only thought of her, determined to cultivate their acquaintance, as she knew, that if her mind could be diverted, her body might gain strength. They were all musical, and proposed having little concerts.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Mary	In what a labyrinth am I lost! What miseries have I already encountered--and what a number lie still before me. Her thoughts flew rapidly to something. I could be happy listening to him, soothing his cares.--Would he not smile upon me--call me his own [MASK]?
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Mary	She thought not of death, though on the borders of the grave; nor did any of the duties of her station occur to her as necessary. Her children were left in the nursery; and when [MASK], the little blushing girl, appeared, she would send the awkward thing away.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Henry	When passion first enters the heart, it is only a return of affection that is sought after, and every other remembrance and wish is blotted out. CHAP. XIX. Two days passed away without any particular conversation; [MASK], trying to be indifferent, or to appear so, was more assiduous than ever.
<name>relative</name>	relative	Henry	no. Is this complying with my [MASK]'s request, could a spirit thus disengaged expect to associate with his? Tears of tenderness strayed down her relaxed countenance, and her softened heart heaved more regularly. She felt the rain, and turned to her solitary home.
<name>Mrs. Hale</name>	Mrs. Hale	Mary	Their state did not require much explanation. [MASK] sent the husband for a poor neighbour, whom she hired to nurse the woman, and take care of the children; and then went herself to buy them some necessaries at a shop not far distant.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Mary	A little girl who attended in the nursery fell sick. [MASK] paid her great attention; contrary to her wish, she was sent out of the house to her mother, a poor woman, whom necessity obliged to leave her sick child while she earned her daily bread.
<name>David</name>	David	Ann	In the course of conversation, however, she mentioned to him, that she earnestly desired to obtain a place in one of the public offices for [MASK]'s brother, as the family were again in a declining way.
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Henry	[MASK] was a man of learning; he had also studied mankind, and knew many of the intricacies of the human heart, from having felt the infirmities of his own. His taste was just, as it had a standard--Nature, which he observed with a critical eye.
<name>Lucie</name>	Lucie	Mary	Overwhelmed by this intelligence, [MASK] rolled her eyes about, then, with a vacant stare, fixed them on her father's face; but they were no longer a sense; they conveyed no ideas to the brain.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Mary	[MASK] then left her bed, and went on deck, to survey the contending elements: the scene accorded with the present state of her soul; she thought in a few hours I may go home; the prisoner may be released.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Ann	This day she was continually thinking of [MASK]'s recovery, and encouraging the cheerful hopes, which though they dissipated the spirits that had been condensed by melancholy, yet made her wish to be silent. The music, more than the conversation, disturbed her reflections; but not at first.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Mary	The mother with tears thanked her deliverer, and pointed out her comforts. [MASK]'s tears flowed not only from sympathy, but a complication of feelings and recollections the affections which bound her to her fellow creatures began again to play, and reanimated nature.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Ann	[MASK] was still very ill; hope had beguiled many heavy hours; yet she was displeased with herself for admitting this welcome guest.--And she worked up her mind to such a degree of anxiety, that she determined, once more, to seek medical aid.
<name>daughter</name>	daughter	Henry	I will not attempt to describe what I felt when he talked thus to me. If I am to lose the support of my age, and be again a widow--may I call her Child whom my [MASK] wishes me to adopt?"
<name>she</name>	she	Mary	It made such an alarming progress, that she was prevailed on to send for a physician; but the disorder was so violent, that for some days it baffled his skill; and [MASK] felt not her danger, as she was delirious.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	CHAP	Gentle reader, I will tell thee; they neither of them felt what they could not utter. I will not pretend to say that they always annexed an idea to a word; but they had none of those feelings which are not easily analyzed. [MASK].
<name>St. John</name>	St. John	Mary	[MASK]'s tears were not those of unmixed anguish; the display of his virtues gave her extreme delight--yet human nature prevailed; she trembled to think they would soon unfold themselves in a more genial clime. CHAP. XXIX.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Mary	At last the boat arrived safe along-side the ship, and [MASK] caught the poor trembling wretches as they stumbled into it, and joined them in thanking that gracious Being, who though He had not thought fit to still the raging of the sea, had afforded them unexpected succour.
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Mary	[MASK] did not want a companion. As she had given orders for her passage to be engaged in the first vessel that sailed, she could not now retract; and must prepare for the lonely voyage, as the Captain intended taking advantage of the first fair wind.
