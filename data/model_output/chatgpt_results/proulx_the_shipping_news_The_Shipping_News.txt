<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Quoyle	Soundlessly the distant towers came together, plunged under the water. A fountain of displaced water. [MASK] below the rock. Suddenly he clasped his hands around her ankles. She felt the heat of his hands through her brown stockings, did not move.
<name>David</name>	David	Quoyle	“You stop that howling or you’ll see your bottom warmed,” said the aunt. Face red in the wind. [MASK] remembered himself crying "I can’t see it,” to a math teacher who turned away, gave no answers.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Quoyle	The thought that she, that his own son and grandchildren, would daily void their bodily wastes on his remains a thing that only she would know. On Saturday morning [MASK] and his daughters came along, suitcases humped in the backseat, the speedboat swaying behind on the rented trailer.
<name>Babette</name>	Babette	Nephew	But when the sauce was nearly done, discovered there was no linguine, only a package of egg noodles shaped like bows, soft stuff that mounded under the sauce and sent the squid rings sliding to the rims of the plates. “You’ve got to plan ahead, [MASK].”
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Jack	“It flew away.” In the weeks that followed [MASK]’s resurrection, his slow gain on the pneumonia and voicelessness that followed, he whispered out details of his round trip to the far shore and back. Decent kind of a day. Not many lobsters but some.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Quoyle	[MASK] liked the row of shops, snug from the wind, yet almost on the wharf. The windows wavery with old glass. A bell jingled as he opened the door. The aunt, working a finger-roll edge on a stuffed pad, looked up.
<name>He</name>	He	Quoyle	It doesn’t look like it goes anywhere. ” “There’s tire tracks on it,” she said, pointing to cleated tread marks. [MASK] turned onto the sumpy road. Churned mud. The tire marks disappeared.
<name>Edmund</name>	Edmund	Partridge	The front of [MASK]’s house, the empty street drenched in amber light. A gilded hour. In the bags a packet of imported Swedish crackers, bottles of red, pink and white wine, foil-wrapped triangles of foreign cheeses.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Quoyle	“Yeah. But the door is crooked.” A crash. “Did you throw something?” “The door is crooked! And you said you would give me a ride in the boat. And didn’t!” [MASK] got up. “1 forgot.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Billy	Got you, Skipper.” Hung up, swiveled his chair, looked at the marred sea. Laughed. “[MASK]! What do you think. He’s up at the house with double earache. Says ‘You won’t see me until tomorrow or next day. ’ ”
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Quoyle	to each eligible child. He hadn’t thought of insurance, but it crossed the aunt’s mind at once. The children slept, [MASK] and the aunt sat at the kitchen table. The aunt in her big purple dress, having a drop of whiskey in a teacup.
<name>Uncle Oswald</name>	Uncle Oswald	Jack	Proper thing. I haven’t seen [MASK] in a flaming fit for a long time. Not since his fishing boot fell onto the hot plate and roasted. Tell you what, you better leave your motor running when you come in tomorrow morning.”
<name>Cheryl</name>	Cheryl	Ricky	Quit her job and she is gone. Called up her boss and says ‘[MASK], I quit.’ I was standing right here when she said it. Said for you to write me out a check right away.”
<name>Dolores</name>	Dolores	Wavey	Understand they’ve had some trouble. Towing cable parted and they had to rig another.” [MASK] came down the steps pulling at the sleeves of her homemade coat, the color of slushy snow. She got in, glanced at him. A slight smile.
<name>Politician</name>	Politician	Harangues	And what’s this we read in the overseas papers about kidnappers mailing the left ear of a Sicilian businessman they are holding hostage to his family? The way the foreigners live makes you wonder! The editorial page played streams of invective across the provincial political scene like a fire hose. [MASK], pitted with epithets.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Archie	[MASK] reeked of cigarettes. His face fissured with thousands of fine lines, black curved hairs growing out of his ears and nostrils. The fingers orange. Couldn’t speak without coughing. “No, you won’t find ’er for she’s not there.
<name>him</name>	him	Dennis	The aunt peered out into the parking lot. “Can’t see it from here,” she said. “But you did the right thing. Maybe you could go out with [MASK] a few times, see how he manages and all.”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Quoyle	But he was very good-natured they said. Laughed and sang. Anybody could fool him with a joke.” “Sounds simpleminded,” sobbed [MASK] into his teacup. “Well, if he was, it’s the first I ever heard of it.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Quoyle	“Ar, the manager’s got the face of a robber’s horse and he’ll give me the brazen old runaround. But we’ll try.” [MASK] gave it five minutes, had his hand on the doorknob when the phone rang.
<name>him</name>	him	Quoyle	There’s other possibilities. What I’m getting at is maybe she is sensitive in a way the rest of us aren’t. Tuned in to things we don’t get. There’s people here like that.” Looked sidewise at [MASK] to see how he took that.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Quoyle	The chattering needle slowed, the muslin slid over the table. The woman smiled at [MASK], showing perfect teeth between violet lips, then her smile faded, a sadness flowed down her face from brow to mouth. A jabot foamed at her throat.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Dennis	That’s four thousand dollars. Another possibility is [MASK]. He said he could ferry us back and forth with his boat until it iced up too much. If we could pay for the gas and his time at, say, ten dollars an hour.”
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Wavey	The scrawn of muscle built to last into the ninth decade. “Giving [MASK] a ride home, then?” “Yes.” His soft hand embarrassed him. A curtain moved in the window of the house behind the rioting wooden zoo.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Dawn	But to cut a feller’s head off and put it in a suitcase! They say she had to have help, a weak old woman like that.” “I don’t know,” said [MASK]. The typewriter had a repeat setting.
<name>probably</name> (Note: There is no clear proper name in this sentence, so this is a guess based on the context.)	probably (Note: There is no clear proper name in this sentence, so this is a guess based on the context.)	Aunt	and it’s convenient. It’s big enough. Nine rooms, [MASK].” “I’ll get over this,” she said. “I’ve always been good at it. Getting over things.” “I know,” he said.
<name>George</name>	George	Dennis	That’s the same as the bulldozer, a hundred a week. And by January the bay will be iced in. I don’t want to risk the girls on a snowmobile going back and forth across the bay. [MASK] says there are weak spots.
<name>Aunt Dahlia</name>	Aunt Dahlia	Quoyle	Wolf down his sandwich and haul out the stocking, ply the needles for half an hour as rapidly as the aunt. No sooner done with the blue stuff than he was tearing into white wool, some kind of a coat, it looked like. [MASK] tried to make a joke about it.
<name>Santa</name>	Santa	Wavey	“I been waiting and waiting for you to come home. Dad, you got to come up to my room and see what [MASK] got for us. Come on, Dad. Right now. Please.” On fire about something. He hoped it wasn’t crayons.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Quoyie	It looked all right. Looked sturdy enough. Painted white and grey. Practically new. Must be something wrong with it. [MASK] thumped the side with his knuckles. “Tell yer what,” said the man. “Give me fifty, she’s yours.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Quoyle	And Tert Card is cornin’ down to pick us up. He wants an order of the meatballs to go if you got enough. ” So, a dish of figgy duff with a drop of rum sauce, and coffee. “I’m going to open that suitcase,” said [MASK].
<name>he</name>	he	Quoyle	But [MASK] did like movies, the darkness, the outlines of strangers’ hair against the screen, the smell of peanuts and shampoo, popcorn squeaking in teeth. He could fly away from his chin and hulking shape into the white clothes and slender bodies on the screen.
<name>she</name>	she	Wavey	“They’d sell the berries, you see, in those days.” “Still do,” [MASK] said. “Agnis girl, last fall they paid ninety dollars a gallon for bakeapples. My father made a thousand dollars on his berries last year.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Dogs	She never got to be happy here. Never had a chance to enjoy a real outing, a good walk along the shore. [MASK] love that.” “I bought a boat today, aunt. Too bad I didn’t get a motor, too.
<name>Ahab</name>	Ahab	Quoyle	He wore scale-spattered coveralls and his feet on the desk were in rubber boots with red soles. “Oh yar!” he said in a startlingly loud voice. “Oh yar,” and hung up. Lit a cigarette. “[MASK]!”
<name>June</name>	June	Bunny	Walked around, looking at the homemade shelves, open boxes of skinning knives, needles for mending net, cones of line, rubber gloves, potted meats, a pile of adventure videos. [MASK] peered through the freezer door at papillose frost crowding the ice cream tubs.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Billy	He could see nothing. But in a minute a glow on a stagehead showed and [MASK] brought the boat up, climbed out and slipped a mooring line over a bollard. “That stink,” he said, “is coming from the suitcase.”
<name>Janine</name>	Janine	Edna	It’s like the whole country got infected with some rage virus, going for their guns like it used to be you’d look at your watch. Remember [MASK] the rewrite woman on the Record?" “Yeah. She never smiled at me. Not once.”
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Card	“You may laugh, [MASK], but it’s a rotten, bitter thing for a woman to see the shadow of a mustache creeping across her face. You’d be sympathetic now, wouldn’t you, if it was men having breast fat removed?”
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Beety	He did not want to live in the trailer. [MASK] gave him a cool look and a mug of hot tea. “I stayed at the inn last night,” he said, “apparently." “Look like you slept in the puppy’s parlor.
<name>The</name> (Note: There is no proper name that fits in this sentence. The correct answer is "The" as it is referring to a specific person who is not named in the passage.)	The (Note: There is no proper name that fits in this sentence. The correct answer is "The" as it is referring to a specific person who is not named in the passage.)	Billy	You should have seen the way [MASK] sat in his comer shaking alive, scrammed with cold. Then a week or two later the heaviest rain anybody ever see. Floods and destruction. The Lost Man dam broke. 1 don’t know how many millions of dollars damage it did.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Quoyle	“Give me fifty, she’s yours.” “Does it leak?” said [MASK]. “Nah! Don’t leak. Sound as a sea-ox. Just me boy built it but he’s gone now. Good riddance to him, see?
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Quoyle	If the weather’s decent I’ll go out Saturday.” “If I can,” said [MASK]. “If the aunt doesn’t have major things planned for me.” Kept gazing out at the bay. As if waiting for a certain ship.
<name>Miss Moore</name>	Miss Moore	Mercalia	It’s the best part. Come on out here. ” [MASK] put the cap on her pen. Weary of writing of prodigies who bit their hands and gyred around parlor chairs spouting impossible sums, dust rising from the oriental carpets beneath their stamping feet.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Mumma	He should have been back dinnertime. It’s ten o’clock now. Something’s wrong. I called the Search and Rescue. I’m on my way to [MASK]’s now. I felt like something was off all day. We’s braced for the worst.”
<name>Chris</name>	Chris	Quoyle	“No,” said [MASK]. “We’re going to stick it out right here. We’ve got a tent in the back and I’m going to set it up beside the car and sleep in it. That’s the plan.”
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	Quoyle	“No wonder.” Caved in on the side as though smashed with a war club. [MASK] picked up the phone, but it was dead. “At least we can have dinner,” said the aunt. “There’s a dining room.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Tert	That’s our golden rule. No exceptions. [MASK] has a big file of wreck pictures. If we don’t have a fresh one, we have to dip into his file. But we usually have a couple of good ones. The Homcup crowd keeps us supplied.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Quoyle	THE ASHLEY BOOK OF KNOTS “BOY, there’s a sight down here to the wharf. Never the like of it in these waters.” The booming voice rattled out of the wire and into [MASK]’s ear. “With the smell of evil on it.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Quoyle	It’s like you feel to yourself that’s all you deserve. And the worse it gets the more it seems true, that you got it coming to you or it wouldn’t be that way. You know what 1 mean?” [MASK] nodded.
<name>Old Man</name>	Old Man	Billy	[MASK] stretched and yawned, his withered neck taut again for a few seconds. “I can feel the season changing,” he said. “Drawing in. This weather change coming means the end of hot weather.
<name>Toby</name>	Toby	Warren	The aunt said in the old days when the mailman drove a team and men hauled firewood with dogs, everyone kept the brutes. Perhaps, she said doubtfully, some wild tribe had descended from those dogs. [MASK] snuffled without enthusiasm, refused to take a scent.
<name>Crake</name>	Crake	Yark	” said [MASK], stopping on the path. Arm out in warning, fingers splayed. “What?” Only the sucking draw of the sea below. He wanted to get home. “The sea. Heard a big one. She’s building a swell.”
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Billy	It was a hot, windless noon hour like a slot between two warring weather systems. They squeezed into [MASK]’s truck, off to the Fisherman’s Chance in Killick-Claw for fish and chips, escaped and away from Tert Card who scratched with both hands.
<name>George</name>	George	Stared	[MASK]. “That’s for my wife’s little spaniel. Great system. Doggie makes doo-doo on the simulated grass, you throw overboard—see the loop on the comer for the line?—and presto, tow until it’s squeaky clean again. Great invention.
<name>Edie</name>	Edie	Quoyle	Maybe it was thank-you. Maybe it was stop by and have a cup of tea some day. Her hands swung. She stopped for a moment, took a white, crumpled tissue from her coat pocket, blew her nose. Still [MASK] sat there.
<name>Unknown</name>	Unknown	Card	A Ministry of Health official is quoted as saying ‘This thing is hot.’ Probably means the electrolysis machine. Millions and millions of dollars for millions and millions of electrolysis treatments.” [MASK] sniggered. He was all grease spots and hunger. Fingernails like sugar scoops.
<name>Alaska</name>	Alaska	Quoyle	I’ll think of you, [MASK], wonder if you’re still up here. See, I’m leaving New Year’s Day. I bet you’ll be the next one to go. You’ll go back to the States.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Nutbeem	Just bite off the heads, drag the meat out with your teeth and spit out the tails.” The snow swept over them. [MASK]’s hair and eyebrows were thick with it as he faced into the wind. The others had gyred around to give their backs to the weather.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Quoyle	There she was, coffin with a stem and a keel, planked up and caulked nice, a little six-foot coffin painted up smart. Best thing about ’er was the counter, set nice and low, all ready for ’er little outboard motor.” [MASK] laughed feebly.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Warren	Always will. She snorted into her handkerchief, waited in the gathering darkness, moving back a few steps at a time as the tide advanced, until [MASK] floated free, moved west along the shore, edging out and out, riding some unseen tidal rip.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Quoyle	A decent dinner and a good night’s sleep and we’ll be ready for anything.” The dining room, crowded with men, was lit by red bulbs that gave them a look of being roasted alive in their chairs. [MASK] thought the coffee filthy, but at other tables they drank it grinning.
<name>Enderby</name>	Enderby	Nutbeem	Tert Card snapped open a fresh copy of the Gammy Bird. Shot black looks from his gledgy eyes. At his desk, [MASK] lit his pipe. The smoke came up in white balls. Outside the window fog and a racing wind that could not carry it away.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Quoyle	Reminding me of me boy.” “No, no, don’t bum it,” said [MASK]. “Can’t go wrong for fifty bucks, can I!” He found a fifty and got a scrawled bill of sale on the back of an envelope.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Quoyle	Nothing like it on a wet day.” “1 will,” said [MASK]. Sat on the edge of a chair. Runnels of water coursed down the window glass. “Get down,” said the harbormaster, pushing a cat out of a chair.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Aunt	“We’ve all got to get a grip here and pull together.” “You’re right, [MASK]. And I’m sorry you’ve had to do all the looking.” He was here and there was nothing to go back to.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Quoyle	It stood, staring at her. The black mouth gaped, the teeth seemed packed with stiff hair. Then it was gone like smoke. She shrieked, stood shrieking, and when [MASK] ran to her, she climbed up on him, bellowing to be saved.
<name>Mr. Mooney</name>	Mr. Mooney	Wavey	A strained silence. Then, “One, two, three,” said [MASK] and commenced. The hornpipe rolled into the audience and at once hundreds of right heels bounced against the floor, the boy rattled his way up and down the blank boards.
<name>Marlin</name>	Marlin	Quoyle	[MASK] was frightened. Each time, he lost the rudder and the boat yawed. In a few minutes his voyage ended. The bow struck like an axe, throwing the stem high. At once a wave seized, threw the boat broadside to the oncoming sea.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Quoyle	[MASK] at the back of the meeting, writing on his pad. Went home, typed and retyped all night at the kitchen table. In the morning, eyes circled by rings, nerved on coffee, he went to the newsroom.
<name>Artemis</name>	Artemis	Bunny	The Tall and Quiet Woman. Then [MASK] ran at them with her hands cupped. Always an arrow flying to the target. A stiff, perfect bird, as small as a stone in a child’s hand. Folded legs.
<name>Walt</name>	Walt	Boyle	Something to do with a drug deal, they think. On Wednesday afternoon [MASK] picks up a passenger at the fish plant, makes a U-turn, and is ambushed by a masked man on a late-model blue Yamaha snowmobile with the word psychopath painted on the cowling.
<name>Ferns</name>	Ferns	Alexanders	Entered a band of spruce, branches snarled with moss, whiskey jacks fluttering. The path became a streambed full of juicy rocks. A waterfall with the flattened ocean at its foot. He stumbled, grasping at [MASK], the leaves perfuming his hands.
<name>Brett</name>	Brett	Quoyle	She did not move. There was a sense of a curtain, of a hand on the rope that could pull it open. [MASK] inhaled the scent of cotton stockings, a salt and seaweed female smell that made him reckless. His fingers unfurled, the hands drew back.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Quoyle	She thought of a boy in school who had wept over his lunch of mildewed crackers. She had given him her meat sandwich, cut from a cold moose roast. “There’s enough of them now,” said [MASK], laughing, wanting to seize the chapped hand.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Quoyle	I’ll do everything.” “Let’s go have supper,” muttered [MASK]. “I can’t handle this right now.” “The dining room is closed to the public tonight. It’s the curling championship dinner.
<name>Truman</name>	Truman	Bunny	“My eyes hurt,” said [MASK]. Both children had reddened, matter-filled eyes. For an imprisoned hour they watched the fading storm and the snowplows, banged on the door, called “Hello, hello.” Both plastic penguins were broken.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Quoyle	“Yes,” said [MASK], “but you are very strong.” His stout, homely child with disturbing ways, but a grand helper with boards and stones and boxes. Not interested in the things of the kitchen unless on a platter.
<name>Cheryl</name>	Cheryl	Nutbeem	The taut plastic over the party platters vibrated visibly. “When the first guests pull up,” shouted [MASK], “we’ll rip the plastic off.” They looked vainly through the cupboards for a bowl large enough to hold thirty bags of potato chips.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Quoyle	A three-temperature water bar in the kitchen. They’d installed a great sound system with digital signal processing that could play video laser discs and CDs at the same time in different rooms at different volumes. When was [MASK] going to fly out and visit?
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Quoyle	Said she dodged her bike through the paths, screaming like a crazy thing, the men after her, run like engines before they run her down.” [MASK] made a sucking noise with the side of his mouth. He did not believe a word.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Dennis	The wood of the new dock was resinous and fragrant. Water slapped beneath. Curdled foam. “Tie your boat up now, can’t you?” said [MASK]. “Pick up a couple old tires so she don’t rub. ”
<name>Mrs. Barry</name>	Mrs. Barry	Beety	“I was going to take them out to the house with me this morning. You’ve had them all week, [MASK]. You must need a break. ” “They’re like me own," she said. “But perhaps you’ll be in tomorrow afternoon?
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Quoyle	“Some would curse her mangled body for selling the little girls.” The milk on the verge of turning. Tan knobs in the sugar bowl from wet coffee spoons. “I will never believe that, that she sold them. Never,” cried [MASK].
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Quoyle	“You set in it, it’s comfortable enough, but to the others it looks like you sprouted golden wings.” "She has very good posture,” said [MASK]. Tried to cancel the stupid remark. “What I mean is, she has a good stride.
<name>John</name>	John	Quoyle	Any time at all. [MASK] refolded the letter, put it in his pocket. The bay was an aluminum tray dotted with paper boats. How short the days were getting. He looked at his watch, astonished how the months had fallen out of it.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Card	But [MASK] was in front of him again. “All of a sudden something behind him. A hairy devil jumped down the hole like a hockey puck . . . red eyes. Says to me father ... ‘be back for you . . .
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Quoyle	“You sound like you’re fishing with a holed net, shy most of your shingles standin’ there hemming and hawing away.” Glared at [MASK] who slouched and put his hand over his chin. “Got four phone calls last night about that Hitler boat.
<name>Donna</name>	Donna	Petal	They said the Geo had veered off the expressway and rolled down a bank sown with native wild-flowers, caught on fire. Smoke poured from the real estate agent’s chest, [MASK]’s hair burned. Her neck broken.
<name>Blanche</name>	Blanche	Warren	And I had a lot of trouble with the tufting. Made me sick to look at how that beautiful leather was spoiled. Because to me it was spoiled. So [MASK] says—knew I enjoyed it—says ‘Why don’t you take a workshop in leather upholstery?
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Nutbeem	He raised an axe he’d picked up near [MASK]’s woodpile. “Ar!” he shouted. “Wants to take ’is leave, do ’e? Us’ll ’ave ’im ’ere. Come along, b’ys, axe ’is bo’t.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bunny	“Well, [MASK] doesn’t like the color of the house. That dark green.” That sounded idiotic. It was what had happened in the kitchen. He could overlook the rest. The stewed cod and the squidburger came.
<name>Marian Wright Edelman</name>	Marian Wright Edelman	Wavey	Explained things could be done. “These children can learn, can be taught,” she said. Fervent. A ringing voice. Here was [MASK] on fire. Had requested books on the condition through the regional library. Started the parents’ group.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Harriet	Out the window the sky was dirty, sand swirled in the street. A few trucks passed, exhaust twisting out of tail pipes. Cold. His jacket sleeve was tom from shoulder to wrist. Downstairs [MASK] smirked. “Hear it was some party,” she said.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Wavey	[MASK] saw the questions would come for a long time, that the child was gauging the subtleties and degrees of existence. Downstairs the hubbub and laughing increased. Upstairs, difficult questions. Why was one spared and another lost? Why did one rise and not another?
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Quoyle	“I doubt it can be done without some savage talk and nervous breakdowns all around.” [MASK] showed he didn’t hear him. The Hairy Devil “To untangle a snarl, loosen all jams or knots and open a hole through the mass at the point where the longest end leaves the snarl.
<name>who</name>	who	Dennis	Wallowed along on her side. When he see she was still afloat the captain turned back and reboarded her, and the next day they got a salvage tug out that fastened a tow and finally brought her in.” “And [MASK]?”
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Wavey	[MASK] ran to get away, then for the sake of running, and at last because there was nothing else to do. It would look undecided to change her pace, as though she did not know what she wanted. It seemed always that she had to keep on performing pointless acts.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Quoyle	[MASK] heard her murmuring to them, “Get up there, honey, you want the pancakes?” She could not stack more than four before they fell. The aunt ticked off points on her fingers, drew lines on the rock with a burned stick.
<name>him</name>	him	Sunshine	Above the peak of the house the thin sky and clouds raced diagonally. The illusion swelled that the clouds were fixed and it was the house that toppled forward inexorably. The looming wall tipped at [MASK] who scrambled up and ran, deliciously frightened.
<name>Mira</name>	Mira	Quoyle	Her hands clashed in bracelets, rings. Feet stretched out, blunt purple ankles. Holding a glass cut with the initial M. Cellos sobbed, imparted a sense of drama. [MASK] saw the CD case on the coffee table, “Breakfast in Satin Sheets.”
