<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Dulcie	When the name is completely obliterated, he shudders at what he has done. Has he, the intended, been directed into acting, into becoming the agent for others? By way of making amends to [MASK] he writes her name on another clean sheet of paper.
<name>John</name>	John	David	He kept silent. The wind howled in its attempt to carry off the roof; the hibiscus tree beat itself against the windowpanes, and, not a little afraid of the vicious wintry night, I was pleased to have [MASK] there.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Hennie	Yes, it’s like a tree in the front garden just laden for all to see with the shiny apples of my shame. Your Uncle [MASK], whose children never went to college, now sits through the sunny afternoons in an armchair with his grandchildren playing all around him.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Dulcie	Ergo, we are all Griquas, I laugh. A good editor would know what to do with this material, he persists. There is no point in arguing; it is clear that the Baartman piece will have to stay. And [MASK]? I ask.
<name>Sheldon</name>	Sheldon	David	With the world. Let me see now, and picking up [MASK]’s empty teacup, he studies the uniform trace of tannin left by the no-brand tea bag. He shakes his head gravely. Things don’t look so good for you, ou pal.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Sally	Rummaging through his bag he finds a hairbrush that [MASK] must have packed, and standing in front of the mirror he performs the unfamiliar task of sliding the useless brush across his hair, noting with surprise the grey at his left temple.
<name>Piet</name>	Piet	David	And then, as her eyes fall on [MASK], she says, staring wildly, Goeienaand my Opperhoof—good night my Chief—naand tog my hoof, naand ... naaaghgh ... trailing off into a snarled gurgle as her face contorts and her body convulses.
<name>of the skirt</name>	of the skirt	Nature	Midway between the extremities [MASK] had been extremely prodigal, so as to make walking neither easy nor graceful. This lady might have sat for a model to a Parisian dressmaker, without any artificial aids in order to set forth the grotesque feminine disfigurement which the freaks of fashion made popular in the middle eighties.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	David	[MASK] is not sure of what he remembers. They were difficult times, times best forgotten. He rubs his face with both hands. People could not, under those pressures, always afford to be cautious, he explains; it was crucial to act quickly.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Thomas	He has some business to attend to; he is indeed grateful, lucky to be in such a friendly town, such reliable hands; he would be very pleased to avail himself of [MASK]’s services at another time, and turns away briskly.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jamie	Then [MASK] joins them, and conspiring against the swimming lesson they tumble like seals, laughing and splashing, and oh, what it takes to stay calm, for she is determined that the child should learn to swim today, no later than today.
<name>Ilse</name>	Ilse	Rachael	As far as I can— [MASK], he interrupted, they will be here tomorrow at three which gives you, the mother of the volk, twenty-four hours in which to remember that they are your people. What would happen to us if we do not forgive?
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Sally	Except he’s behaving strangely, doesn’t seem to be himself these days, and then there is that woman. She had seen him at a meeting looking at the woman, and she knew at once. Caught the woman’s eyes several times resting on him, even on her, [MASK].
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	David	Before his eyes he sees again the black-and-white skin of the sheep hanging in the shed, studded with coarse rock salt. [MASK] puts his hands to his ears as his head pounds, presumably with the bleating of a lamb. Or the buzz of bluebottles.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Dulcie	In which case the hotel could later become a classroom, the hit list a child’s exercise book with the names of his classmates written with a flourish, and [MASK] a page torn out of a novel—a story re-remembered as belonging to another.
<name>James</name>	James	Thomas	He shuts the box and slips it into his pocket when a knock sounds on the door. It is the headwaiter himself who enters with the drinks. He nods politely at [MASK] and fusses over the setting out of pretty coasters with flaming aloes on a background of grey rock.
<name>others</name>	others	Sally	No stoic could have imbibed army codes more thoroughly, so that his replies were curt. She knew not to badger him, knew that there were limits to probing. To [MASK] it may have seemed like an adventurous life; he would not have used such a word.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	David	See, I need a camera and it so happens that I’ve got just the thing you need. [MASK] smiles, shaking his head. Say, ou pal, haven’t seen you for a while, crocodile. Keeping yourself scarce, hey?
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	David	She winces at the thought of [MASK] being special to her because he is like her, or she is like him—of her kind, as our writers also say about race. She is grateful for the ready-made euphemism.
<name>Word</name>	Word	David	My computer has none; it has had enough, is embarrassed, and mysteriously refuses to process the elliptical dot-dot-dots, which I have to insert by hand. It is with the greatest difficulty that I get [MASK] to admit that there is something between them.
<name>the guest</name>	the guest	David	He puts out a hand to restrain him, then turns round and, as if he had been given the nod by someone—-someone who identifies him as guest?—wishes [MASK] a very pleasant evening in a manner that suggests the delay was all about conventions of politeness.
<name>Yoruba</name>	Yoruba	Afrikaans	I insisted on the influence of an amanuensis. Except, of course, that the Chief’s slippage into fantasy also makes his syntax slip accordingly, often introducing a code-switch, by which I simply mean the movement between English and [MASK].
<name>He</name>	He	Thomas	You’re spot on, absolutely right, he says, I am in a bit of a fix and I’m ready to consider any reasonable offer. [MASK] produces a rectangular leather case, not unlike a little cutlery box, which he balances on his knee for a while.
<name>Woolf</name>	Woolf	Dulcie	Not only would that be a gross misunderstanding of [MASK], and as it happens, I do know at least what the passive voice is, but it is also clear that I—and he beats his chest histrionically—have made a terrible mistake in choosing to work with you—pointing rudely at me.
<name>Morag</name>	Morag	Bronwyn	Let me tell you another story, I say. About [MASK] the Brown Witch who can do anything at all. Oh, there are tests galore for her, the usual ones of three wishes, three trips into the woods, three impossible tasks. She passes them all.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	David	But no, [MASK] insisted, not strange at all; there were several old bound books of the kind that no one reads, the kind that people buy in boxfiils from auctions. Six books of even size selected to match and flank the faded maroon spine of the Bible.
<name>she</name>	she	David	Only then does he notice her new glasses, which he says are all the more successful for not being so noticeable. She allows herself to be held, her hair to be stroked, and [MASK] makes a pot of strong tea before putting the children to bed.
<name>He</name>	He	David	But instead of looking up at him, she strikes at the till, converting her figures into the real thing, he supposes, and he leaves to the jingle of coins and the smell of her perfume lurching about in his stomach. [MASK] has no need of the key.
<name>Prue</name>	Prue	David	[MASK] can’t remember why the others pooh-poohed the idea, mocked her, wondered if she were man enough to do it by herself. She took off her socks, twisted and knotted them, held a match until they smouldered and intrepidly stormed the nest wearing only a balaclava as protection.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	David	The white wigged patriarch wears a kindly expression, as does his eldest daughter, his favourite, standing beside him with a musical instrument that [MASK] cannot identify. She is the apple of his eye; her flail lower lip droops like his.
<name>He</name>	He	Sally	They are a soft, feminine green flecked with the pale lights of his fury. [MASK] will never guess how he hates those eyes, fake doll’s eyes dropped as if by accident into his brown skin. It is, rather, the mirror that he loves.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	David	[MASK] needed help reading the typescript; he could not understand why it was indecipherable, why it appeared to be written by an illiterate madman when indeed he knew that the self-taught Griqua chief was nothing of the kind.
<name>Amos</name>	Amos	Gert	In the shade they kept rows of three-legged cast-iron pots in which the excess milk fermented into heavenly curds. To be a Rain Sister is going to be no ordinary business, no joke, [MASK] warned in his gentle, irritating manner.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Dulcie	There is a head, an upside-down smiling head, which admittedly does not resemble her, except for the outline of bushy hair. I have no doubt that it is [MASK] who lies mutilated on the page.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Rachael	Take it, [MASK], I cannot bear to touch it, for already it jingles with the shekels of treachery. She dusted it down fastidiously while he replaced the soil and smoothed the earth. And only then did she suggest that they take out the documents and rebury the bag.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sally	No, my girl, the trick is to keep faith.... You musn’t say such things.... Saying is bad luck, makes unlikely things come true. Just the sort of nonsense one expects from old people, [MASK] thinks. Why on earth can she not keep anything to herself?
<name>Anton</name>	Anton	Joop	She could only hope that he had not driven over her malva deliberately, hope that the sergeant with the moustache, brusque as he was, had nipped the plant by accident, that at least would be something. And when [MASK] came home she said nothing of the malva.
<name>Yara</name>	Yara	Antjie	The baby was a girl, with bright eyes set like jewels in her brown face and a booming voice that would brook no delay of the breast, so that, in her sling of softest sheepskin, she spent whole days tied to [MASK]’s chest.
<name>He</name>	He	David	And then ... [MASK] hesitated, savouring for a moment the memory of the UDF representative. They’d sent a woman, a young woman, for heaven’s sake, in trousers and an oversized jersey and ugly brown shoes like the old-fashioned walkers worn by nurses.
<name>James</name>	James	David	[MASK] refuses to acknowledge my need to know more. He mutters about personal and professional lives running along quite separately, then, as if realising that that might not be the right thing to say, he waves his hand as if to delete.
<name>Una</name>	Una	Sally	Homely, he thought, and cooed with pride at the boy’s natural functions. The baby was obliging in this respect and on evenings when [MASK] went to UDF meetings soiled his nappies repeatedly, challenging the most robust plastic pants.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	David	She does not exist in the real world; [MASK] has invented her in order to cover up aspects of his own story. That is what I suspect. For a day or so, while I believe in her fictionality, I feel a sense of relief.
<name>Ephraim</name>	Ephraim	Andrew	He was like a father to me. This world, my good wife, [MASK] explained, drawing up his newly patched breeches without a word of admiration for the fine stitching, but with his back modestly turned, This world is not the place we thought it was.
<name>Amos</name>	Amos	David	Thereafter it was plain sailing; she had them eating out of her hand. [MASK] admired the thoroughness of her homework. Had the government not abused and maligned the Chief, called his appeals for justice sedition, thrown him into prisons? And had he not fought back?
<name>Stuart</name>	Stuart	David	Is that word in the script? They won’t find it funny, you know, hearing you calling them kaffirs, [MASK] ventures. He is rewarded by a give away tick followed by a hurried smile. Look, man, that’s—that’s cool.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	David	Although they come in the early hours she has to be vigilant at all times. Worse than any instrument of torture is the thought of such hard-found words being fingered by them—jabbed, clubbed, defaced into a gibberish that would turn the thing between [MASK] and herself into nothing.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	David	The atmosphere could have been called electric, although that was not a word that [MASK] would have chosen. But he was at a loss; things were no longer the same, as if, like some city slicker, he was viewing the world through sunglasses, its meanings tinted beyond recognition.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	David	[MASK], suspecting him of buffoonery, stares at him coldly so that the man is driven to further parodic servility: he doffs an invisible cap, braces his shoulders and coaxes a croaky voice to concertina his Yes Sir No Sirs into a televisual Deep South drawl.
<name>Alfie</name>	Alfie	David	Say, ou pal, haven’t seen you for a while, crocodile. Keeping yourself scarce, hey? No, no, [MASK] laughs. As I said, I’m quite busy. Got a lot of work to do.
<name>Alia</name>	Alia	Dorie	Rubies and garnet, beryl and jade. Why not diamonds themselves, she ventured, fighting the bitterness in her voice. He said soberly, They would have speculated, [MASK]; they would not allow diamonds to pass to us, and for that we must be grateful.
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Sally	He thinks as one ought to, of the waste, of the hungry and homeless, as she pushes aside the plate of mashed food. Today [MASK] is clairvoyant; she beats the haft of her knife on the table and shouts, Let’s think about ourselves for a change.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	David	Is he, [MASK], responsible for her place on the list? And why, how can he possibly, and he buries his head in his hands with shame or anger or despair, how could he be thinking of her as the beloved!
<name>David</name>	David	David	The man, who was not there a moment ago, looks directly at him, rather than at the adoring dog. His hands are held together as if in prayer. [MASK] steps back somewhat, meeting his steady gaze, and, yes, the man is still there.
<name>Clarence</name>	Clarence	Dulcie	[MASK], and he indulges in the pleasure of thinking her name once more. Not everyone has a good electric iron, but then, not everyone knows how to use it. Properly, that is. First you sprinkle each item, like baptising it with a flick-flick of your fingertips.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Sally	It was only as she drew the nylon over the head of the squealing child that [MASK] thought otherwise. They had been speaking of nothing other than liberation. It would be, they were sure, only months before the overthrow of apartheid, so that the little girl would be no guerrilla,
<name>Mandla</name>	Mandla	David	[MASK] finds it hard to say that it is about himself; he mumbles about problems with this year’s Youth Day celebrations, about things being so mixed up since the ANC is being established within the country; one has to expect all kinds of sabotage from unexpected quarters.
<name>Jannie</name>	Jannie	David	[MASK] squats excitedly in front of her, but she shuts her eyes. It’s too late my boy, far too late, she mutters stubbornly, far too late, and her lips begin quivering, so that the Bezuidenhout woman comes to stroke her hand.
<name>Yael</name>	Yael	Dulcie	In the Movement those kinds of differences are wiped out by our common goal. [MASK] certainly would make no distinction between the men and women with whom she works. So I gather that, like him, she is high-ranking in the military wing, probably a commander.
<name>Blackamoors</name>	Blackamoors	Griquas	[MASK] are from the olden times; there aren’t any left now. We’re all coloured here. He has no time to apologise, for the waiter has appeared in the doorway. Extraordinary looking man. What an amazing profile, don’t you think?
<name>Aristotle</name>	Aristotle	Cuvier	In short, a windbroek, not only an absence of flesh but a weakness of spirit, which after all could not be true of [MASK], the father of biology. Besides, the passage was largely irrelevant, no more than a warming-up exercise, a digression from the real subject of his narrative.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	David	Perhaps, I say, as the ant disappears down a crack, it’s too difficult. Perhaps we should abandon the whole thing. Oh no, [MASK] says anxiously, no need for that. It’s just a matter of being careful, of not distorting things.
<name>Waterboer</name>	Waterboer	Affecting	[MASK] not to acknowledge annexation, he accused Her Majesty’s government of dishonesty and in his vulgar tongue advised the naive Griqua people to move to the Cape where he has established a Griqua church independent of the influence of missionaries.
<name>Seamus</name>	Seamus	Thomas	Included in the budget, I’m sure, he laughs. Or claim it as expenses. Twice over, and he winks roguishly at [MASK], who obliges by emptying his pockets of silver coins. As the bald man reaches the door he calls him back.
<name>She</name>	She	Sally	Really, he does not understand such an uncharacteristic outburst. [MASK] knows that questions are out of order, that she should not know anything about his missions; having been a cadre herself, she has never had any problem with secrecy.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Ouma	[MASK]’s eaten nothing, she complains. The slice of cake lies untouched on the plate by her side. In all the excitement with the stranger no one has mashed and fed it to her, and now she shakes her head.
<name>Yorick</name>	Yorick	Dorie	There he was, a man of honour, from whom the governor could have learnt a thing or two, gagging on the first mouthful of greasy felt, so that, my dear [MASK], I drew the hat out of his mouth and gave it to a beggar at the gate.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	David	Oh, no sir, we’ve got the right guy alright. We know everything there is to know about you— In that case, [MASK] interrupts, you will know that I’m not interested in diamonds or in making money, certainly not in the IDB business.
<name>Reardon</name>	Reardon	David	No doubt a new tactic for unnerving her. Are they hoping that she will get in touch with [MASK], betray his whereabouts at the Crown Hotel? Surely they know that revolutionary codes do not allow for that. She ought to consult with someone but decides to let it pass.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Thomas	Nothing to do with the shiny baubles that women, queens, hang around their heads. Bravo, my friend, bravo. [MASK] claps his hands delightedly. See, this stuff is in your blood, man, comes out of our ancestor’s soil.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	David	It occurs to me that [MASK] is, in spite of himself, becoming dependent on speaking to me. I say nothing, but I fear for him. For the telling that will surely take over. Cape Town 1991
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	David	In three-quarter profile, the distinct face of a bald black man in red livery, repeating the colours of the foreground. [MASK] feels himself going cold with fright. The man, who was not there a moment ago, looks directly at him, rather than at the adoring dog.
<name>Rosa</name>	Rosa	Sally	[MASK] awards herself a quiet hour while the children watch television at the neighbours’, but she soon shuts the book in irritation. She has had enough of the bodies of black women: their good thick legs, their friendly high-riding backsides, their great sturdy hams.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Thomas	Give me your hand, [MASK]. I need to read for myself whether you’re the sort of person I could trust. He studies the brown palm for some time, studies the way the nicotine stains darken towards the fingertips, the crisscross of the dark lines that cut into the paler skin.
<name>Wilderstead</name>	Wilderstead	Reservoir	And they were mos tired, so they made their houses right there as they came down the mountain. Now it’s the Nature Reserve and [MASK], ’cause you see we moved further away from the mountain into the valley and that, if you ask me, was our first mistake.
<name>Obi</name>	Obi	Antjie	Where had they found a camera and at what cost? Could the stern and pious Chief be guilty of vanity? Whatever the case, the official cameraman arrived by horse cart two days late, the awe of the moment long passed, hence the unusual placement of [MASK] as founding father.
<name>Antoinette</name>	Antoinette	Dorie	And what an unhealthy and accommodating business the idea of nation was, she thought—just as well that her husband had given her the new name of [MASK] with which to face this idea. It was at this stage that some came to speak of her slow sad smile of subterfuge.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Andrew	She understood little of what [MASK] said; she had never before heard anyone speak like a book. Besides, he never gave her any details, and since she was not allowed to ask she learnt little of his clandestine activities. It is safer that way, he said.
<name>Antonio</name>	Antonio	Rachael	What do they care about truth or embarrassment when there is money or land at stake? No, there is no such thing as shame, and that is why I will go on fighting, why their prisons are nothing to me. [MASK] said nothing.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Sally	It is also for this reason that he refuses to indulge [MASK]’s jealousy, to explain anything to her, for as he says, there is absolutely nothing to explain. So, I persist, people in your positions are immune to physical relationships, to passions?
<name>Ulysses</name>	Ulysses	David	By then [MASK] was getting used to the idea of walking about drenched to the skin, fascinated by a city in which he could enjoy the unfamiliar and yet read the well-known names of streets or road signs.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	David	The battles man, he continues, ignoring the discomfort of the man whose embarrassed eyes swoop and dart about the speaker’s raised face. [MASK] asks politely, Which battles d’you mean, although he has not given up all hope of getting away. For the land, of course.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	David	Which signalled that it was a happy marriage and that the struggle was going well. [MASK] was partial to the sight and smell of the red plastic bucket into which she dropped the nappies. Homely, he thought, and cooed with pride at the boy’s natural functions.
<name>Penelope</name>	Penelope	Huguenots	Or that her weaving skills would have to be replaced by winemaking, for that was another thing [MASK] did so well. That’s life, she sighed resignedly, an endless shuttling back and forth between opposing worlds. Besides, who was she to set herself against the making of history and tradition.
<name>John</name>	John	David	The young receptionist, packing her things into a bag of many compartments, much like a filing cabinet—a nuisance to get one’s eyebrow pencil all mixed up with ballpoint pens—is pleasantly surprised by [MASK]’s friendly greeting as he enters the hotel lobby.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	David	I know we’re supposed to write that kind of thing, but I have no desire to cast myself as hero, he sneers. Nothing wrong with including a historical figure. But she may not even have been a Griqua. [MASK] gives me a withering look.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	DULCIE	Silly girl, and he smiles affectionately, for her tossing and turning has woken him up. [MASK] washes the sticky red from her hands, watches until the water runs clear and then shakes them vigorously; she does not like wiping them on a towel.
<name>Mpho</name>	Mpho	Dulcie	What on earth are you talking about, eating a man’s organs? Not a man’s; the inner organs of an animal. Oh, forget it, I say, just another coincidence. But wasn’t that also the day you met [MASK], in the Soweto Day celebrations?
<name>He</name>	He	David	He has developed a peculiar system of hand signals, and seems irritated when I fail to understand. I gather that [MASK] wants to keep our association strictly businesslike, that he regrets it having slipped into a casual warmth.
<name>Don</name>	Don	Thomas	Uh huh, she grunts, her head moving steadily back and forth. He says boldly, gallantly, taking a leaf from [MASK]’s book, taking the risk, We could drive over now, when you knock off; it’s a disgrace not to know your own local attractions.
<name>Elspeth</name>	Elspeth	Antjie	If the truth be told, [MASK] would have given anything to get out of the vague and heavy responsibilities of a Rain Sister, which she could not quite fathom. Whatever the expectations were of her, she now knew that she could not live up to them.
<name>Offred</name>	Offred	Dulcie	[MASK] knows that there is only a point to screaming if you can imagine someone coming to your rescue; that a scream is an appeal to a world of order and justice—and that there is no such order to which she can appeal.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	David	He is rewarded by a give away tick followed by a hurried smile. Look, man, that’s—that’s cool. Don’t you worry yourself about that kind of thing. No, [MASK] says, it’s you I’m worrying about.
<name>He</name>	He	David	From his table [MASK] has an unimpeded view of the square, its trees and grass and benches, where a public life even at this early hour begins to murmur. Opposite the hotel, on the other side of the square, are the grand buildings of the courthouse.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	David	how to write about, how to turn it into a proper story. .. [MASK]’s hand shakes. It would seem that he is not dissembling. But how could I possibly know what he’s talking about, and who could possibly have such simple faith in formal education?
<name>Hardcastle</name>	Hardcastle	David	So that’s where I come in to offer you a new interest, a new line of action, one in which your invaluable skills and experience in the politics business are appreciated and can be put to sensible use. [MASK] paces up and down.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sally	Oh, I don’t know, [MASK] admits. I did go through his pockets, many times, but there was nothing at all. Except he’s behaving strangely, doesn’t seem to be himself these days, and then there is that woman.
<name>Chico</name>	Chico	Africans	Delighted with the gesture, the man flashes him a conciliatory smile. Okay then, [MASK], but, he warns, you should be careful of those people, man. You defend them, you treat them good, and they shit on your head.
<name>Yeats</name>	Yeats	Andrew	Ag, she said aloud, impatiently, she was becoming like [MASK] with his visions, and she rolled the thought back into a tight scroll; she had no business getting mixed up with ideas, even if these days auras and revelations were two a penny.
<name>Yevgeny</name>	Yevgeny	Sally	Just as [MASK] says, I’m prone to sentimentality, the fake feeling that brings nothing but trouble. And in a foreign city, of all places. There I was, full of bravado and sentiment, a commander of a new cell, doing something as foolish and undisciplined as chatting with the enemy.
<name>Grubach</name>	Grubach	Imbokodo	At one point, perhaps through boredom, he overstepped the mark, and got up to confront his charge. [MASK], he announced pompously, beating on his chest as if he were the entire security department. The grinding stone, he translated.
