<name>Walton</name>	Walton	EVELINA	Adieu, my dearest Sir. I am sure you will write immediately, and I shall be all impatience till your letter arrives. LETTER LXX. [MASK] IN CONTINUATION. Oct. 1st. GOOD God, my dear Sir, what a wonderful tale have I again to relate!
<name>Mr. Collins</name>	Mr. Collins	Tom	"Come, come, [MASK], don't tell secrets; you'll make the ladies afraid of me: but I assure you," lowering his voice, "if I did marry, it should be your cousin."
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Ma'am	"Why, what is the matter, [MASK]?" "The matter!-why, all the ladies are at open war with you,-the whole pump-room is in confusion; and you, innocent as you pretend to look, are the cause.
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Evelina:-Alas	that, instead of irritating, I could soothe your sorrows!-Oh Sir, how thankfully would I then prove my duty, even at the hazard of my life!" "Are you so kind?" cried he, gently; "come hither, child;-rise, [MASK], it is for me to kneel,-not
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	Maria	If he was offended, could he not have been silent? If he thought my letter ill-judged, should he not have pitied my ignorance? have considered my youth, and allowed for my inexperience? Oh, [MASK]! how have I been deceived in this man!
<name>Fanny</name>	Fanny	Maria	why there is some genius in that, my Lord, perhaps rather-rustic." Here [MASK] was called to dance, and so heard no more. Now, tell me, my dear Sir, did you ever know any thing more provoking? "
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	EVELINA	[MASK] IN CONTINUATION. Oct. 9th. I COULD not write yesterday, so violent was the agitation of my mind;-but I will not, now, lose a moment till I have hastened to my best friend an account of the transactions of a day I can never recollect without emotion.
<name>sister</name>	sister	Evelina	Yet is it too interesting, and the situation too critical, to allow of delay.-Oh, my [MASK], your situation is critical indeed!-your peace of mind is at stake, and every chance for your future happiness may depend upon the conduct of the present moment.
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Paris	When I recovered my reason, my impatience to hear from [MASK] almost deprived me of it again; and though the length of time I waited for letters might justly be attributed to contrary winds, I could not bear the delay, and was twenty times upon the point of returning thither at all hazards.
<name>God</name>	God	George	"Splashed, quoth-a!-why I thought you were soused all over.-Come, come, don't mince the matter, never spoil a good story; you know you hadn't a dry thread about you-'Fore [MASK], I shall never think on't without hollooing!
<name>Werther</name>	Werther	EVELINA	I have a thousand times imagined that the whole study of his life, and whole purport of his reflections, tended solely to the good and happiness of others: but I will talk,-write,-think of him no more! Adieu, my dear friend! LETTER LX. [MASK] IN CONTINUATION.
<name>Willoughby</name>	Willoughby	Monseer	Dieu!" And she rose, and walked about the room. "Why, what,-has [MASK] sent to you?" continued the Captain: "is that there letter from him?" "No,-it i'n't;-besides, if it is, it's nothing to you."
<name>Fanny</name>	Fanny	George	Fore [MASK], I have scarce made any use of her yet, by reason I have had nobody with me that could enjoy a joke: howsomever, it shall go hard but we'll have some diversion now."
<name>him</name>	him	Clarinda	His action-at once so graceful and so free!-his voice-so clear, so melodious, yet so wonderfully various in its tones!-Such animation!-every look speaks! I would have given the world to have had the whole play acted over again. And when he danced-O, how I envied [MASK]!
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Egad	"Often!" repeated he; "[MASK], Madam, I don't know why I said it now;-but I'm sure I can't recollect that ever I owned as much before." "Owned it before!"
<name>friend</name>	friend	Evelina	Oh, my [MASK], how will my soul find room for its happiness?-it seems already bursting!" I could make no reply, indeed I hardly spoke another word the rest of the evening; so little talkative is the fulness of contentment.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Tom	I daresay I've been over half the garden." "Half? but why did not you go over it all?" "Why, so I will: but only I thought I'd just come and see if she was here first." "But where's [MASK]?"
<name>coquetry</name>	coquetry	Orville	"Enough," cried he, "I understand you!-the art of [MASK] has prevailed;-cold, inanimate, phlegmatic as he is, you have rendered him the most envied of men!-One thing more, and I have done:-Will he marry you?" What a question!
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Ma'am!-I	" "Me, [MASK] declare I can't stir a step; the heat is so excessive, it would kill me. I'm half dead with it already; besides, I shall have no time to dress.
<name>Homer</name>	Homer	Pope	This latter seems very desirous of appearing a man of gaiety and spirit; but his vivacity is so low-bred, and his whole behaviour so forward and disagreeable, that I should prefer the company of dullness itself, even as that goddess is described by [MASK], to that of this sprightly young man.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Maria	I do not like him. He seems to be surly, vulgar, and disagreeable. Almost the same moment that [MASK] was presented to him, he began some rude jests upon the bad shape of her nose, and called her a tall ill-formed thing.
<name>Mrs. Peachum</name>	Mrs. Peachum	Lord	Why, [MASK], it's the best night of any; there's always a riot,-and there the folks run about,-and then there's such squealing and squalling!-and, there, all the lamps are broke,-and the women run skimper scamper.-I declare I would not take five guineas to miss the last night!"
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Monseer	I know your opinion of our nation too well, to affront you by supposing a Frenchman would want my assistance to protect you. Did you think that [MASK] here, and I had changed characters, and that he should pop you into the mud, and I help you out of it?
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Madame	"For Heaven's sake, my dear [MASK]," said I, "don't be alarmed,-you are in no danger,-you are quite safe,-there is nothing but-" Here the chariot was stopped by two men in masks; who at each side put in their hands as if for our purses.
<name>Henrietta</name>	Henrietta	Evelina	Remember, my dear [MASK], nothing is so delicate as the reputation of a woman; it is at once the most beautiful and most brittle of all human things. Adieu, my beloved child; I shall be but ill at ease till this month is elapsed.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Moll	"O, I promise you," cried he, "our [MASK] would never have wheedled me into this jaunt, if I'd known she was not here; for, to let you into the secret, I fully intended to have treated the old buck with another frolic."
<name>dear child</name>	dear child	Evelina	And now, my [MASK], committed at length to the care of your real parent, receive the fervent prayers, wishes, and blessings, of him who so fondly adopted you! May'st thou, O child of my bosom!
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Pardi	"I have no doubt, Madam, but you will soon discover him." "[MASK], if I do, I'll hang him, as sure as fate!-but what's the oddest, is, that he should take such a special spite against me above all the rest!
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Evelina	Perhaps the time may come, when I may know the comfort of such a daughter;-at present I am only fit to be alone: dreadful as are my reflections, they ought merely to torment myself.-Adieu, my child;-be not angry,-I cannot stay with thee;-Oh, [MASK]!
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Maria	I would fain encourage more cheerful thoughts, fain drive from my mind the melancholy that has taken possession of it; but I cannot succeed: for, added to the humiliating feelings which so powerfully oppress me, I have yet another cause of concern;-alas, my dear [MASK],
<name>John</name>	John	Sir?-no	"Me, [MASK], thank Heaven, I'm free from all encumbrances of that sort." "Well," cried the Captain, "I met a person just now so like you, I could have sworn he had been your twin brother."
<name>something</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name to fill in the [MASK] token.)	something (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name to fill in the [MASK] token.)	Thursday	In the first place, [MASK] was agreed to; and, in the second, my father, he said, was much concerned to hear of my uneasiness; sent me his blessing; and complied with my request of seeing him, with the same readiness he should agree to any other I could make.
<name>Betty</name>	Betty	Ma'am	come, come, don't be cross; here's your Grandmama ready to take care of you, so you can have no fair objection, for she'll see that I don't run away with you. Besides, [MASK], I got the tickets on purpose."
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Ma'am	"Who is severe upon the ladies now?" said I. "Why, really, [MASK], it was a slip of the tongue; I did not intend to say such a thing; but one can't always be on one's guard."
<name>William</name>	William	Sir,-and	[MASK] can you possibly have taken so much trouble?" "Trouble! O, Madam, could there be any, to return you, the moment I had the power, my personal acknowledgments for your goodness?"
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ma'am	"[MASK]," answered the poor wretch, in great confusion, "I did not know at first but that my cheek might have been bit; but as 'tis no worse, why, it does not a great deal signify.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Caroline!-yes	Soon after, starting up, he again seized the letter, exclaiming, "Acknowledge thee, [MASK], with my heart's best blood would I acknowledge thee!-Oh that thou could'st witness the agony of my soul!-Ten thousand daggers could not have wounded me like this letter!"
<name>father</name>	father	Miss	Well, I'm not so polite; I can't like nonsense, let it be never so much the taste." "But pray, [MASK]," said the son, "what makes that fellow look so doleful while he is singing?"
<name>Madam</name>	Madam	Ma'am	But how was I surprised, when I found he had the temerity-what else can I call it?-to impute my resentment to doubts of his honour: for he said, "My dear [MASK], you must be a little patient; I assure you
<name>friend</name>	friend	Evelina	Hasten, then, to the spot of thy nativity, the abode of thy youth, where never yet care or sorrow had power to annoy thee.-O that they might ever be banished this peaceful dwelling! Adieu, my dearest [MASK]!
<name>Candide</name>	Candide	George	" "Severe! 'fore [MASK], that is impossible; for, to cut the matter short, the men, as they call themselves, are no better than monkeys; and as to the women, why they are mere dolls.
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Orville	This is all I can gather of it." "O, [MASK]," returned he, "you are a happy man!-But ill-bred? -I can never believe it! And she looks too sensible to be ignorant."
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Belmont	you have practised, and the pangs of remorse may follow me to the tomb:-Oh, [MASK], all my resentment softens into pity at the thought! what will become of thee, good Heaven, when, with the eye of penitence, thou reviewest thy past conduct!
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Prithee	"[MASK]," whispered his Lordship, "is that queer woman your mother?" Good Heavens, Sir, what words for such a question! "No, my Lord." "Your maiden aunt then?" "No."
<name>Cecilia</name>	Cecilia	Maria	Oh, [MASK]! what, what could induce him so causelessly to wound and affront one who would sooner have died than wilfully offended him? -How mortifying a freedom of style! how cruel an implication conveyed by his thanks and expressions of gratitude!
<name>Diana</name>	Diana	Maria	I believe we were all sorry when the Captain returned; yet his inward satisfaction, from however different a cause, did not seem inferior to what our's had been. He chucked [MASK] under the chin, rubbed his hands, and was scarce able to contain the fullness of his glee.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Lord	"[MASK], Miss," cried he, "we've had such a hunt you can't think! some of them thought you was gone home: but I says, says I, I don't think, says I, that she's like to go home all alone, says I." "
<name>Sir John</name>	Sir John	Jack	I remember your Lordship recommended me to the notice of this lady the other morning, and, egad, I believe you have been doing me the same office to-day." "Give you joy, [MASK]!"
<name>Henri</name>	Henri	Monseer	Another short silence ensued, which was terminated by the Captain's turning roughly to the foreigner, and saying, "Do you know, [MASK], that you are the first Frenchman I ever let come into my house?"
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Evelina	"My dearest child," cried he, "I cannot bear to see thy tears;-for my sake dry them: such a sight is too much for me: think of that, [MASK], and take comfort, I charge thee!"
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Biddy	"O, none at all!" "I'm sure you must be very ill-natured if you could. Now there's [MASK] says she thinks nothing of him,-but I know it's all out of spite.
<name>Henrietta</name>	Henrietta	Maria	He could not well have read this letter the next morning without being sensible of the impropriety of having written it." Oh, [MASK]! why had I not this thought? I might then have received some apology; the mortification would then have been his, not mine.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Maria	MY Sweet [MASK] will be much surprised, and I am willing to flatter myself, concerned, when, instead of her friend, she receives this letter;-this cold, this inanimate letter, which will but ill express the feelings of the heart which indites it.
<name>Heaven</name>	Heaven	George	What, is it common?" repeated the Captain; "why then, 'fore [MASK], such chaps are more fit to be sent to school, and well disciplined with a cat-o'-nine tails, than to poke their heads into a play-house.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Miss	And as for you [MASK]," again advancing to me, "I order you to follow me this moment, or else I'll make you repent it all your life." And, with these words, she flung out of the room.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Monsieur	"Ma foi, [MASK]," answered she, "I have lost my company, and in this place I don't know nobody." There was something foreign in her accent, though it was difficult to discover whether she was an English or a French woman.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Anville	She told tham that she had it in her head to make something of me, and that they should soon call me by another name than that of [MASK]; and yet that she was not going to have the child married neither.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Ma'am	"Use!-really, [MASK], as to that,-I don't make any particular use of them; but one must have them, to tell one the day of the month:-I'm sure, else I should never keep it in my head."
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Evelina	ALL is over, my dearest Sir; and the fate of your [MASK] is decided! This morning, with fearful joy and trembling gratitude, she united herself for ever with the object of her dearest, her eternal affection.
<name>Byron</name>	Byron	Orville	"No matter, Sir," cried I, in great perplexity, "the letter is mine, and therefore-" "I must conclude, then," said he, "that the letter deserves your utmost contempt,-but that the name of [MASK] is sufficient to make you prize it."
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Miss	"It is not possible for me to judge of his merits," said I, "as I am entirely a stranger to him." "But what do you think of him, [MASK]?" "Why, really, I-I don't know."
<name>Victor</name>	Victor	Evelina	Then, after again reading it, "[MASK]," he cried, "she charges me to receive thee;-wilt thou, in obedience to her will, own for thy father the destroyer of thy mother?" What a dreadful question!-I shuddered, but could not speak.
<name>Sir William Lucas</name>	Sir William Lucas	Lord	I thanked him for his intended civility, but told him I was surprised he had so soon forgotten my having already declined going to the ball. "[MASK], Ma'am," cried he, "how should I suppose you was in earnest?
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Belmont	Should'st thou, in the features of this deserted innocent, trace the resemblance of the wretched Caroline,-should its face bear the marks of its birth, and revive in thy memory the image of its mother, wilt thou not, [MASK], wilt thou not therefore renounce it?-Oh, babe of my fondest affection!
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Evelina	For some minutes he was totally silent, and I pretended to employ myself in looking for a book. At last, with a deep sigh, "I see," said he, "I see but too plainly, that though [MASK] is returned,-I have lost my child!"
<name>daughter</name>	daughter	Evelina	yet, believe me, my dearest Sir, had he sustained the part he began to act when he wrote this ever-to-be-regretted letter, your [MASK] would have not forfeited her title to your esteem, by contentedly submitting to be treated with indignity.
<name>Monte Cristo</name>	Monte Cristo	Ma'am	"No, Sir." "So I did presume. Doubtless, [MASK], every thing must be infinitely novel to you. Our customs, our manners, and les etiquettes de nous autres, can have little very resemblance to those you have been used to.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	aunt	"Perhaps I may; but I suppose, Sir, that's none of your business, whether I do or not." "Lord! well, I should like to go! I should like to see [MASK] dance of all things!
<name>Miss Bates</name>	Miss Bates	Madam,-but	"I am ashamed to answer you, [MASK] indeed it is as full as ever, and will continue so till after the birth-day. However, you Ladies were so little seen, that there are but few who know what it has lost.
<name>Madam</name>	Madam	Ma'am	[MASK], your most obedient." "You refuse, then, to see her?" "I am much indebted to you, Madam, for this desire of increasing my family; but you must excuse me if I decline taking advantage of it.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Miss	" "Didn't you, [MASK]," cried he eagerly; "why, then you've a deal of fun to come, I'll promise you; and, I tell you what, I'll treat you there some Sunday, soon.
<name>Nephew</name>	Nephew	EVELINA	Adieu, my dear Sir, pray excuse the wretched stuff I write; perhaps I may improve by being in this town, and then my letters will be less unworthy your reading. Meantime, I am, Your dutiful and affectionate, though unpolished, [MASK].
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Lord	"[MASK], what signifies that?" cried the brother; "he has had his share of sitting, I'll be sworn." "And, if he has not," said the sister, "he has a chair up stairs; and the shop is our own, I hope."
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Madam	"You are just the party," said he, "I wished to see together. Will you, [MASK] (taking my hand), allow me the honour of introducing you, by your real name, to two of my nearest relations?
<name>Sir John</name>	Sir John	Ma'am	"Why, no, [MASK]; I must own I never heard any particular reason for it." "Why, then, Sir, I'll tell it you; and I believe you will confess it to be very particular; his Lordship's friends are not yet tired of him."
<name>Sir John</name>	Sir John	Ma'am	unless, indeed, it were to church; -ha, ha, ha!-You'll excuse me, [MASK]; but, really, I never could conquer my fear of a parson;-ha, ha, ha!-Really, ladies, I beg your pardon for being so rude; but I can't help laughing for my life!"
<name>Madam</name>	Madam	Ma'am	After a short silence he again called my attention, by saying, in an easy, negligent way, "I think, [MASK], you was never in town before?" "No, Sir." "So I did presume.
<name>friend</name>	friend	Maria	"For Heaven's sake, dear Madam," cried I, "let me go home;-indeed I cannot stay here any longer." "Let us all go," cried my kind [MASK]. "But the Captain, what will he say-I had better go home in a chair."
<name>sister</name>	sister	Maria	" And then, very abruptly, he left the room. What a commotion has this mischief-loving Captain raised! Were I to remain here long, even the society of my dear [MASK] could scarce compensate for the disturbances which he excites.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Orville	I am but half-mad yet, and you must stay to finish your work. Tell me, therefore, does [MASK] know your fatal partiality?-Say yes," added he, trembling with passion, "and I will fly you for ever!"
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Maria	But I should have told you, that I made many objections to being of the party, according to the resolution I had formed. However, [MASK] laughed me out of my scruples, and so once again I went to an assembly.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Evelina	In short, Madam, after a discourse infinitely tedious, I was obliged, though very reluctantly, to compromise with this ungovernable woman, by consenting that [MASK] should pass one month with her. I never made a concession with so bad a grace, or so much regret.
<name>Fanny</name>	Fanny	Evelina	Perhaps the time is not very distant, when your [MASK]'s choice may receive the sanction of her best friend's judgment and approbation,-which seems now all she has to wish! In regard to the change in my situation which must first take place, surely I cannot be blamed for what has passed!
<name>sister</name>	sister	Evelina	LET not my [MASK] be depressed by a stroke of fortune for which she is not responsible. No breach of duty on your part has incurred the unkindness which has been shown you; nor have you, by any act of imprudence, provoked either censure or reproach.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Ma'am	I imagine, [MASK], your retirement is at no very small distance from the capital?" I was so much disconcerted at this sneering speech, that I said not a word; though I have since thought my vexation both stimulated and delighted him. "
<name>Heaven</name>	Heaven	Providence	Yes, I do indeed give thee my consent; and so thankfully, that, with the humblest gratitude to [MASK], I would seal it with the remnant of my days. Hasten then, my love, to bless me with thy presence, and to receive the blessings with which my fond heart overflows!-And
<name>Blunderbuss</name>	Blunderbuss	Coverley	Again therefore they set off, and hobbled along, nearly even with each other, for some time; yet frequently, to the inexpressible diversion of the company, they stumbled and tottered; and the confused hallooing of "Now, [MASK]!"
<name>Sir John</name>	Sir John	Miss	"I am no judge,-but I think his person is very-very well." "Very well! -Why, pray [MASK]," in a tone of vexation, "what fault can you find with it?" "O, none at all!"
<name>Solomon</name>	Solomon	Howsomever	[MASK], whether or no, I should be glad to be told by some of you, who seem to be knowing in them things, what kind of diversion can be found in such a place as this here, for one who has had, long ago, his full of face-hunting?"
<name>Bath</name>	Bath	Ma'am	"No, Sir." "No!-nay, then I must insist on having the pleasure of conducting you there before long. I assure you, [MASK], many genteel people go, or else, I give you my word, I should not recommend it."
<name>everyone</name>	everyone	Lord	A private ball this was called, so I expected to have seen about four or five couple; but [MASK]! my dear Sir, I believe I saw half the world! Two very large rooms were full of company; in one were cards for the elderly ladies, and in the other were the dancers.
<name>Horace</name>	Horace	Horace	As I doubt not but you are both excellent classics, suppose, for the good of your own memories, and the entertainment and surprise of the company, the thousand pounds should fall to the share of him who can repeat by heart the longest ode of [MASK]?"
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Miss	"Why, really, I-I don't know." "But do you think him handsome? Some people reckon him to have a good pretty person;-but I'm sure, for my part, I think he's monstrous ugly:-don't you, [MASK]?"
<name>Lady Catherine</name>	Lady Catherine	Ma'am	He frightened me out of my senses; I declare my head is quite giddy. Do you know, [MASK], we have done nothing but quarrel all the morning?-You can't think how I've scolded; have not I, my Lord?"
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Tom	cried his sister; "no, [MASK], that I won't." "Why, then, let it alone; nobody wants your company;-we shall do as well without you, I'll be sworn, and better too."
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Lord	"Why, [MASK], you are a beau; but that's nothing to me. So, if you've a mind, you may be so polite as to dance with aunt yourself." Then, with a loud laugh, he declared it would be good fun to see them.
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	EVELINA	Again I must repeat, I know not what to wish; think for me, therefore, my dearest Sir, and suffer my doubting mind, that knows not which way to direct its hopes, to be guided by your wisdom and unerring counsel. [MASK].
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Evelina	Neither would I have [MASK] appear till summoned. And as to myself, I must wholly decline acting; though I will, with unwearied zeal, devote all my thoughts to giving counsel: but, in truth, I have neither inclination nor spirits adequate to engaging personally with this man.
<name>humbug</name>	humbug	Jack	"Egad, my Lord, I think I've helpt you out there!" "You men of wit, [MASK]," answered his Lordship, "are always ready;-for my part, I don't pretend to any talents that way."
<name>my</name>	my	appearances;-never	Never, never again will I trust to [MASK] confide in my own weak judgment;-never believe that person to be good who seems to be amiable! What cruel maxims are we taught by a knowledge of the world!-But while my own reflections absorb me, I forget you are still in suspense.
