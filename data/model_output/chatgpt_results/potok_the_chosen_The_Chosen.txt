<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Danny	It was still light outside. [MASK] put his hands in his pockets and stared out the window. “I was bom in this hospital,” he said quietly. “The day before yesterday was the first time Fd been in it since I was bom.”
<name>God</name>	God	GodI	It had happened. After two thousand years, it had finally happened. We were a people again, with our own land. We were a blessed generation. We had been given the opportunity to see the creation of the Jewish state. “Thank [MASK]” he said.
<name>Davidovitch</name>	Davidovitch	Danny	But all the Yiddish papers quoted him extensively. I was the center of considerable attention on the part of the Zionist students and the target of icy hatred from the ranks of the anti-Zionists. I paid no attention to the fact that [MASK] did not meet me in the lunchroom.
<name>Elie</name>	Elie	Danny	Whenever [MASK] and I came to visit him, we found newspapers strewn all over his bed. He was reading everything he could find that told of the destruction of European Jewry. He talked of nothing else but European Jewry and the responsibility American Jews now carried.
<name>John</name>	John	Reuven	“How many fathers do I have?” I asked. He didn’t say anything, but he blinked his eyes a few times. “I wish you’d take it a little easy,” I said. “This is not a time to take things easy, [MASK].
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Danny	He has only one desire. To leave the jail. Despite what may be waiting for him outside. [MASK] cannot think one minute beyond the moment he will have to tell his father he does not wish to take his place. Do you understand me?”
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Manya	My father and I woke early so as to be in our synagogue by eight-thirty. [MASK] came in a little before eight and served us a light breakfast Then my father and I started out on the three-block walk to the synagogue.
<name>China</name>	China	Jews	They were not in the least bit interested in teaching the masses of [MASK], in communicating their knowledge and uplifting the people. And so there grew up a great wall between the scholars and the people. It was also a time of terrible superstition.
<name>Mother</name>	Mother	Manya	The whole ride home was like that: silence in the trolley car, weeping men and women, groups of people standing about dazedly in the streets, little children looking bewildered and wondering what had happened. [MASK] and my father were home.
<name>George</name>	George	Billy	So we don’t bother him.” “That’s right,” [MASK] said, lowering his voice. “Also, I think we’ll stop listening to the radio today. We don’t want to wake him if he’s sleeping.”
<name>Abba</name>	Abba	Reuven	“I am late,” he said. “I was afraid they would not let me in.” His voice was hoarse and raspy. “There was a faculty meeting. How are you, [MASK]?” “I’m fine, abba.”
<name>neuroscience</name>	neuroscience	Freud	I couldn’t argue with that. He said experimental psychology would be a healthy balance to my knowledge of [MASK]. Maybe. I still don’t think it has anything to do with the human mind. It’s more physiology than anything else, I think.
<name>Ponyboy</name>	Ponyboy	Danny	I’d much rather be pressured. He’s a nice kid, though.” “Your sister’s pretty nice, too,” I said. [MASK] didn’t seem to have heard me—or if he had, he chose to ignore my words completely.
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	Danny	For the rest of that semester, [MASK] and I ate in the same lunchroom, attended the same classes, studied in the same school synagogue, and often rode in the same trolley car— and never said a single word to each other.
<name>Masha</name>	Masha	Manya	It was a little before ten o’clock when I woke, and my father had already left to teach, so [MASK] served me breakfast alone, calling me a lazy sleepyhead and a few other things in Russian which I didn’t understand, and then I took the trolley over to the college.
<name>the doctor</name>	the doctor	Danny	He had been examined by a big doctor that morning, and the doctor had said he would be all right, but that he would have to be careful, no strenuous studying or exercising. He had gone with his father, and [MASK] said his father was now very upset.
<name>David</name>	David	Danny	Most often these dialogues took only a few minutes, but by the end of September there had already been two occasions when they had lasted more than three quarters of an hour. I was constantly being reminded by these dialogues of the way [MASK] argued Talmud with his father.
<name>him</name>	him	Danny	It was for [MASK] to tell if he wished, not for me.” My father coughed a little and wiped his lips with the handkerchief. The three of us stood there for a moment, not saying anything.
<name>my father</name>	my father	Danny	“He’ll talk to him next week.” “Experimental psychology,” my father mused. “I know nothing about it.” “He said there was a lot of math in it.” “Ah. And [MASK] does not like mathematics.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Billy	He was a fine-looking person, and I noticed he had a long white scar on his forehead running parallel to the line of his light blond hair. “[MASK] tells me you’ve been very nice to him,” he said to me.
<name>Bromden</name>	Bromden	Billy	I felt the wild terror again, and I tried to control it. I lay there a long time, thinking about my eyes. I heard a stir in the ward, opened my right eye, and saw that [MASK]’s father had gone.
<name>the boy</name>	the boy	Billy	“My father isn’t a soldier, but that’s because my mother was killed in the accident and there’s no one else to take care of me and my little sister.” I looked at him and didn’t say anything. “I think I’ll sleep a little now,” [MASK] said.
<name>He</name>	He	Danny	It was cloudy and seemed ready to rain, so we decided to take a trolley car back rather than walk. [MASK] got off at his block, and I rode the rest of the way alone, my head full of what we had talked about, especially his teaching himself German.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Billy	The man smiled at me, then turned back to [MASK]. They went on talking quietly. I lay in the bed and thought about all the things that had happened during the day, and felt sad and depressed.
<name>Don</name>	Don	Danny	But otherwise he doesn’t say much. He told me once he wishes everyone could talk in silence.” “Talk in silence?” “I don’t understand it, either,” [MASK] said, shrugging. “But that’s what he said.”
<name>David</name>	David	Danny	But grammar!” The three of us sat there and talked until it was time for the Afternoon Service. [MASK] found his father’s deliberate mistake easily, and I was able to follow the ensuing Talmudic discussion without too much difficulty, though I did not join in.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Nu	“[MASK],” he said, “it is possible I am not right. After all, my son is not a mathematician. He has a good head on him, but it is not a head for mathematics. But we have a mathematician with us.
<name>Talmud</name>	Talmud	Talmud	He would be a great man even if he had not inherited his post from his father. It is a pity he occupies his mind only with [MASK]. If he were not a tzaddik he could make a great contribution to the world. But he lives only in his own world.
<name>Amir</name>	Amir	Danny	His eyes had said: [MASK]. “You will not understand it. You may never understand it. And you may never stop hating me for what I have done. I know how you feel. I do not see it in your eyes?
<name>in Europe</name>	in Europe	Hitler	The millions of soldiers fighting [MASK] are part of the world. I thought that the meal was ended now and we would start the Evening Service, and I almost began to get out of my seat when I realized that another silence had settled upon the men at the tables.
<name>Jew</name>	Jew	Hasid	“You don’t sound like a [MASK], though,” I told him. “What do I sound like?” “Like a—an apikoros.” He smiled but said nothing. It was a sad smile, and his blue eyes seemed sad, too.
<name>Jean Louise</name> (or <name>Scout</name>)	Jean Louise (or Scout)	Reuven	Once I asked my father why they had remained friends, their views about almost everything of importance were so different. He replied by expressing dismay at my question. Honest differences of opinion should never be permitted to destroy a friendship, he told me. “Haven’t you learned that yet, [MASK]?”
<name>Plato</name>	Plato	Reuven	Do you remember the other?” “Choose a friend,” I said. “Yes. You know what a friend is, [MASK]? A Greek philosopher said that two people who are true friends are like two bodies with one souL” I nodded.
<name>Reuven</name>	Reuven	Danny	I didn’t think the question required an answer and told him so. [MASK] nodded grimly. Besides, he added, the anti-Zionists among the Hasidic students looked upon him as their leader. How would it be if he joined a Zionist group?
<name>Rabbi</name>	Rabbi	Reuven	“Tell me more about grammar in the Talmud, [MASK],” he said to me, with a gentle hint of mockery in his voice. “All my life I have studied Talmud and paid no attention to grammar. Now you tell me a person must know grammar to know Talmud.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Reuven	Ah, you should have seen his eyes that day. You should have heard his voice. What an effort it was for him to talk to me. But he talked. I knew your soul, [MASK], before I knew your mind or your face.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Danny	How could he admire and trust someone who wouldn’t talk to him, even if that someone was his father? I hated his father. Once I even went up to the third floor of the public library, hoping I might find [MASK] there.
<name>Hassan</name>	Hassan	Danny	So I decided it would be the polite thing to do to go over one morning after the school year. [MASK] took me up to his father’s study. The third-floor hallway was crowded with dark-caftaned men, waiting around in silence to see his father.
<name>love</name>	love	Torah	Some of them were even poking each other with their elbows to indicate their pleasure. That one had really been clever. I started to go over it again in my mind. “We see that without [MASK] there is only half a life.
<name>Kafka</name>	Kafka	Freud	I asked him what he would be doing that summer, and he told me he always stayed home in the summer, studying Talmud. He added that he would probably also be reading [MASK] this summer. I said I would come over to his house that Shabbat
<name>the rabbi</name>	the rabbi	Danny	Now they were all looking at me, even [MASK] was looking at me, and from one of the students at my right came a barely audible sigh of relief. I bent over my Talmud, put the index finger of my right hand below the first word of the passage, and began to read.
<name>my girlfriend</name>	my girlfriend	Danny	Only once did we manage to see each other during the week. I had been elected president of my class, and I found myself suddenly involved in student politics. The evenings that I might have spent with [MASK] I spent instead at student council or committee meetings.
<name>David</name>	David	Danny	Then the congregants broke to go back to the front section of the synagogue for the Evening Service. [MASK] and I said nothing to each other throughout the service, and though I prayed the words, I did not know what I was saying.
<name>he</name>	he	Danny	“And I don’t like your father at all.” “You’re entitled to your opinion,” [MASK] said softly. “And I’m entitled to mine.” We were silent for a moment “You’ve lost weight,” I told him.
<name>he</name>	he	Danny	If you continue to come to the library I will show you how to use a bibliography.” “I’ll come,” [MASK] said. “Of course I’ll come.” “I am happy to hear that,” my father told him, smiling.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Danny	He struck the table with his hand, and I felt myself go cold with fright. [MASK] was watching him now, too, and his little brother stared at him as though in a trance, his mouth open, his eyes glazed. “The world kills us!
<name>Reuven</name>	Reuven	Danny	“Of course. They would have followed him anywhere.” “I don’t understand that. I didn’t know a rabbi had that kind of power.” “He’s more than a rabbi,” [MASK] said. “He’s a tzaddik.”
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Danny	I went away from there and walked the streets blindly until it was time to go home to a lonely supper. In the second week of September, I returned to school for the preregistration student assembly and found myself sitting in the auditorium a few seats away from [MASK].
<name>the boy's</name>	the boy's	Billy	I saw him sit down on the edge of the bed, and I saw [MASK] turn his face toward him and sit up. The fa- ther kissed the boy gently on the forehead. They talked quietly. I looked at my father.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Danny	And one day in the late spring of that year, while I was eating lunch, [MASK] came over to my table, smiled hesitantly, sat down, and asked me to give him a hand with his experimental psychology; he was having difficulty setting up a graph for a formula involving variables.
<name>Bella</name>	Bella	Malter	I don’t understand why I wanted to kill you.” I stared at him. “It’s really bothering me.” “Well, I should hope so,” I said. “Don’t be so cute, [MASK]. I’m not being melodramatic.
<name>Doodle</name>	Doodle	Danny	[MASK] was quiet His little brother pecked at the food on his plate, eating little. The skin of his face and hands was almost as white as the tablecloth, drawn tightly over the bones, and the veins showed like blue branches in his face and on the tops of his hands.
<name>us</name>	us	Danny	“There’s our trolley,” I said. “Come on!” The trolley was waiting for a light, and we made it just in time. Some of the people inside stared curiously at [MASK] as we went up the aisle looking for seats.
<name>Gershom Scholem</name>	Gershom Scholem	Graetz	He looked up from the book. ‘That’s pretty strong language, ‘vulgar and disgusting.’ ” His eyes were dark and brooding. “It feels terrible to have a great scholar like [MASK] call Hasidism vulgar and disgusting.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Danny	“I knew he would find out about it sooner or later,” he said softly, looking very sad. “I hope you don’t mind my telling him, [MASK]. I had to.” He shrugged. His eyes were moist and gloomy.
<name>Keating</name>	Keating	Reuven	“You are blessed to have such a father.” His voice was soft, reverent. “[MASK]?” “Yes?” “I must ask you never to use such a method of explanation in my class.” He was speaking gently, almost apologetically.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Danny	But he was very carefully avoiding me, and I knew enough to stay away from him. I didn’t want word to get back to his father that we had been seen together. I hated the silence between us and thought it unimaginable that [MASK] and his father never really talked.
<name>Hannibal</name>	Hannibal	Danny	I looked at [MASK]. For a long moment he sat very still—and then I saw his lips part, move, curve slowly upward, and freeze into a grin. I felt the skin on the back of my neck begin to crawl, and I almost cried out.
<name>God</name>	God	Torah	“The world kills us! The world flays our skin from our bodies and throws us to the flames! The world laughs at [MASK]! And if it does not kill us, it tempts us! It misleads us! It contaminates us!
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Manya	He hovered tenuously between life and death for three days. I lived in a nightmare of hallucinatory dread, and if it hadn’t been for [MASK] constantly reminding me with gentle kindness that I had to eat or 1 would get sick, I might well have starved.
<name> Talmud </name>	Talmud	Kiddushin	“I’m lucky.” He grinned at me. “I’ll show you how. What Talmud are you studying now?” "[MASK]” I said. “What page are you on?” I told him. “I studied that two years ago.
<name>he</name>	he	Israel	But it was not the Talmud that he studied, it was the Kabbalah, the books of Jewish mysticism. The rabbis had forbidden the study of the Kabbalah, and so [MASK] had to study in secret He married, finally, but almost nothing is Shabbat.
<name>Mordecai</name>	Mordecai	Reuven	But I didn’t. Instead, I said, a little scornfully, “I don’t envy his rabbi.” My father shook his head soberly. “Why not? You should envy him, [MASK]. American Jews have begun to return to the synagogue.”
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Danny	But on Wednesday I came home from school with a fever, and by Thursday afternoon I was running 103.6. The doctor called it the flu and warned my father to keep me in bed or there might be complications. I asked my father to call [MASK] and tell him.
<name>Professor</name>	Professor	Danny	I had once suggested a textual emendation in class, and he had given me a queer look. I didn’t think he even understood what I had said. “Well, good luck with your scientific method,” [MASK] told me, getting to his feet.
<name>my son</name>	my son	Reuven	My father stopped, looked at me with a smile, and said, “You are not asleep yet, [MASK]?” “No, abba.” “You are a very patient student. I think I am going to have another glass of tea.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Danny	[MASK]’s brother sat staring at them with his mouth open, finally lost interest, and began to eat some of the food that was still on his plate. Once he started picking his nose, but stopped immediately.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Billy	“She just went away. I was calling him, and she told me not to disturb him. Is it something very bad?” “I don’t know. I think we ought to talk a little quieter, [MASK]. So we don’t bother him.”
<name>Ammi</name>	Ammi	Reuven	Then he looked at me and smiled. “Are you tired yet, [MASK]?” “No, abba.” “I am not sounding too much like a schoolteacher?” “I don’t mind it when you sound like a schoolteacher,” I said.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Appleman	Mathematization yet! What should I tell him, that I hate mathematics? I’m taking the wrong course. You should be taking that course, not me!” “He’s right, you know,” I said quietly. “Who?” “[MASK].
<name>Darcy</name>	Darcy	Danny	[MASK]’s sister, I noticed for the first time, was a very pretty girl, with dark eyes and long dark hair combed back into a single braid, and vivacious hands that seemed always in motion when she spoke.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Reuven	“[MASK]—” “Yes?” “Never mind. Go to sleep. I am going to sit here for a while and have another glass of tea.” I left him sitting at the kitchen table, staring down at the white cloth. CHAPTER SEVEN
<name>Sigmund</name>	Sigmund	Freud	“But at least he’s sympathetic. He’s really a fine person.” I smiled at him but didn’t say anything. Then I noticed the psychology textbook he was carrying. It was one of the books I had seen on Friday that didn’t mention [MASK] once.
<name>Tony</name>	Tony	Billy	“That’s what I kept telling my manager. I’m a nice guy, I kept telling him. Is it my fault I got clopped? But he lost faith. Lousy manager.” [MASK] stared in the direction of his voice.
<name>the son's</name>	the son's	Levi	His brother was fine, he said finally, and everything seemed to have settled down. His mother was in bed with high blood pressure, though. But the doctor said it was caused by her excitement over [MASK]’s illness and all she needed now was to rest She would be better soon.
<name>George</name>	George	Danny	He went out, and a moment later I followed. I saw him go into the bathroom, and I went in after him. The bathroom was empty. [MASK] was urinating into one of the urinals. I stood next to him and assumed the urinating position.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Reuven	My father took another deep breath and got to his feet “[MASK], I must go home and go to bed. I am very tired. I was up almost all last night finishing the article, and now rushing here to see you after the faculty meeting. . . .
<name>Leah</name>	Leah	Danny	[MASK] and I sat down. A whisper moved through the congregation, followed by the rustle of pages as prayer books were opened. An old, gray-bearded man went up to the large podium, put on a prayer shawl, and started the service.
<name>son</name>	son	Daniel	But he has learned. Let my [MASK] become a psychologist I know he wishes to become a psychologist I do not see his books? I did not see the letters from the universities? I do not see his eyes? I do not hear his soul crying?
<name>Helen</name>	Helen	Billy	“It’ll be wonderful to be able to see again,” [MASK] said to me. “I had an accident in the car once. My father was driving. It was a long time ago. It wasn’t my father’s fault, though.”
<name>Dill</name>	Dill	Billy	[MASK]’s father said something to the boy, and the boy laughed loudly. I saw my father glance at them briefly, then look back at me. Then I saw him turn his head and look at them again. He looked at them a long time.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Danny	I saw [MASK] take his elbows from the table and sit up straight He stared down at his paper plate, his face expressionless, and I almost had the feeling that he had gone rigid, tense, as a soldier does before he jumps from shelter into open combat
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Danny	“He’s finishing another article.” “Tell him my father sends his regards.” “Thanks. Are you and your father talking to each other these days?” [MASK] hesitated a moment before answering. “Not really. Only now and then.
<name>Shulem</name>	Shulem	Billy	“Also, I think we’ll stop listening to the radio today. We don’t want to wake him if he’s sleeping.” [MASK] nodded fervently. I got my tefillin from the night table and sat on my bed and prayed for a long time.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Danny	[MASK] hadn’t changed much physically during his last year in high school. The only thing different about him was that he was now wearing glasses. BOOK THREE A word is worth one coin; silence is worth two. —The Talmud CHAPTER THIRTEEN
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Billy	“I got to take it real easy, kid. Can’t do too much talking. Have the old ring post down on my back.” He closed his eye and lay still. When I prayed that morning it was all for [MASK], every word.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Danny	I’m trapped now, too. Do you know what it’s like to be trapped?” I shook my head slowly. “How could you possibly know?” [MASK] said. “It’s the most hellish, choking, constricting feeling in the world.
<name>Amir</name>	Amir	Danny	“It was a secret between us, abba.” He looked at me grimly. “Does [MASK] know what pain this will cause his father?” “He dreads the day he’ll have to tell him. He dreads it for both of them.”
<name>Ali</name>	Ali	Danny	The child who followed him, holding on to the caftan with his right hand, was a delicate miniature of the man, with the same caftan, the same fur-trimmed hat, the same face, the same color hair, though beardless, and I realized he was [MASK]’s brother.
<name>Spock</name>	Spock	Danny	and I opened my eyes. [MASK] was sitting up in his chair and looking at me. “I was reviewing my logic,” I told him. “I wasn’t sleeping.” “Of course,” he said, smiling. But his voice sounded sad.
<name>him</name>	him	Danny	To hell with you and your damn silence. By the time the fall semester officially began two days later, I had promised myself to forget [MASK] as quickly as possible. I wasn’t going to let him ruin another semester’s work.
<name>Danny</name>	Danny	Danny	“How’s that again?” “I said my brother would probably make a fine tzaddik,” [MASK] said quietly. “It occurred to me recently that if I didn’t take my father’s place I wouldn’t be breaking the dynasty after all.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Danny	I looked at him. “I thought he might be sick. I thought your sister said—” “He’s not sick,” [MASK] broke in. He lowered his hand. “I —I really don’t want to talk about it.”
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Danny	Clearly, almost like an echo in a cave, I heard the tap-tap-tap of [MASK]’s metal-capped shoes against the linoleum hallway floor. Then he was in the study, carrying a tray with three glasses of tea, sugar, spoons, and some of his mother’s cookies.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Billy	I explained to [MASK] as best I could sor.-.e of the things that were going on, and he kept telling me his uncle was the pilot of a big plane that dropped bombs. He asked me if I thought he was dropping them now to help with the invasion.
<name>Rabbi</name>	Rabbi	Danny	There is a joke in the Talmud we did not see? What was so funny? [MASK] shook his head, still smiling, bent over the Talmud, and began to give his version of the passage. His voice trembled a little.
<name>the Rebbe</name>	the Rebbe	Danny	About half of my high school class had entered the college, and I became friendly enough with many of the other non-Hasidic students. I didn’t mix much with the Hasidim, but the extent to which they revered [MASK] was obvious to everyone.
<name>Mordechai</name>	Mordechai	Reuven	“Are you able to use your tefillin?” "Yes. I can’t read though. I pray by heart.” He smiled at he. “I did not think of that My baseball player. I will see you again tomorrow, [MASK].”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Reuven	“You will go over the first day of the holiday. On Sunday.” “Why didn’t he tell me?” “[MASK], he did tell you. You have not been listening.” “All these weeks—” “Listen next time.
<name>him</name>	him	Danny	And he went from the room, leaving me as bewildered as I had been before. I had planned to talk to [MASK] the next day, but when I saw him he was in such a state of panic over his brother that I didn’t dare mention what my father had said.
