<name>Samuel</name>	Samuel	Hakan	As he ate his food, [MASK] felt that he was saying good-bye to something. About half of the Indians returned. Once again, they surrounded the wheeled convoy. After a pause followed by a hoot, they opened fire. The emigrants responded.
<name>Jonas</name>	Jonas	Hakan	Now and then, however, they would look at each other from their horses and smile fleetingly. No one had ever smiled at [MASK] like that, for no reason. It felt good. After a while, he learned to smile back.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Linus	It was so quick, he was unable to even blow out the big breath he had taken in preparing for the effort. After the initial surprise, [MASK] smiled proudly, until he looked up and saw their father’s face.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Asa	But more impressive than his ability to decipher the plains and his perfect sense of direction was the fact that [MASK]’s knowledge of the terrain, acquired through numerous trips, allowed him to anticipate every stage of their journey.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Antim	[MASK], who feels indebted to you as well, will give you one of his ponies, and I will furnish you with all you need for your journey.” “Please don’t go back to the flats.” “1 must. I know you understand that.”
<name>Alvaro</name>	Alvaro	Hakan	How calming [MASK] found the endless night sky after those long, gridded days! The firmament was certainly greater than the desert, but at least it did not tease him with lines and cells that brought the unfulfilled promise of an ending.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Hakan	, [MASK] realized now that all those childhood tales had to have been made up. Nobody could commit or witness those barbaric acts with such giddiness. And he preferred to think the stories were false rather than to even consider that his brother had felt such frivolous delight at bloodshed.
<name>Rawlins</name>	Rawlins	Hakan	When he was not dressing his wound, [MASK] was coaxing him to drink water or trying to shield him from the sun. He spent most of the day with his cheek to the horse’s neck, feeling the flesh twitch under his coat.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Hakan	For a few days, the picture appeared on the wall as the sun started to set and vanished before it had fully sunken. Even if he knew every last detail of that patch of land, [MASK] never tired of looking at its slightly watery inversion on the wall.
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Jarvis	He cocked the unloaded pistol and pulled the trigger repeatedly. After each click, as [MASK] squeezed the trigger, the hammer rose and the barrels turned over so that a new cylinder would get under the pin just in time for the next impact. “See?
<name>Artemis</name>	Artemis	Lorimer	It contained vials, bottles, scalpels, needles, suture, clamps, saws, scissors, and other surgical instruments. “Oh, 1 almost forgot,” [MASK] added while searching his pockets. “You are a hopeless navigator. Do you have other talents?
<name>Phileas</name>	Phileas	Lorimer	[MASK] had taught him that, against everything his senses told him, the earth was a globe. Had he already made his way around it? Had his journey south (and slightly east) taken him all the way back northwest, from where he had come?
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Hakan	He was stunned by the suddenness with which the man had ceased to be. It had been like magic. Next to [MASK], the veiled woman inhaled in short segments, as if able to take in only broken pieces of air. Her eyes were on the man she had destroyed.
<name>Thorn</name>	Thorn	Lorimer	The design was surprisingly regular, and the lines of salt, protruding an inch or two, collapsed with a crunch under the wagon wheels but were often strong enough to resist the weight of their steps. The horizon was a noose. [MASK] led his party farther into the glaring expanse.
<name>Stavrogin</name>	Stavrogin	Hakan	[MASK] himself was surprised. It had been years since he last stood next to another person or something of a more or less constant size—something that was not in nature or that he had not made with his hands. The men were like children.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Hakan	Every day, [MASK] was visited by the elation he had experienced riding his own horse, a feeling that had been intense enough (his physical frame had barely been able to contain it) to ripple through time and lap against the present.
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Hakan	[MASK] slid the box across the table, and the captain, gently, with the utmost respect, opened it and looked in without touching anything. “Incredible.” He paused, passed the box back, and drank—this time, without ceremony.
<name>Roland</name>	Roland	Hakan	Night fell, and, unable to navigate in the dark, [MASK] stopped. He lay down on the warm dirt, between two clusters of sagebrush. The desert, so quiet during the day, was now bustling with activity—animals growling, mating, eating, being eaten.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Josiah	The astonishing pain. The sheriff was the one holding the needle, but the pain was his own. How could his body be doing this to itself? “[MASK], pour some water here. I can’t see what I’m doing under the slime.
<name>Horace</name>	Horace	Asa	[MASK] listened carefully, but it was unclear whether he was focused on the words or on the food. It was not easy to explain the nature of that vesicle of sentient substance and how it evolved and created a protective crust and then a body and limbs around itself to further its own life.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Hakan	“Quite a place,” the gray soldier said again. They dismounted, escorted [MASK] to his cell, and, after taking the guns they found there, walked around, inspecting the burrow and claiming different sections for themselves. Night came.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Hakan	Blue and cold were one. [MASK] felt the crisp blue sky on his skin and eyes. And with this consonance of sight and touch, he realized that his consciousness had returned. His cramped limbs were an indication that he had been gone for a good while.
<name>Heinrich</name>	Heinrich	Hakan	He smelled the clean breath coming from the empty stomach. Then he looked into the creature's watery eyes and wrung its neck. Mother and cub were skinned. His animals were exhausted and ill fed, but [MASK] knew their only hope was to outrun the northern cold.
<name>Oldtimer</name>	Oldtimer	Hakan	He frantically felt his pockets while looking around for kindling. Everything was too large or too wet. [MASK] looked up from the boy with anxious eyes. Panting, the man rifled through the wagon until all of a sudden he stopped, hit by a realization.
<name>Samuel</name>	Samuel	Asa	When it was apparent that he had concluded, [MASK] put down his plate, cleaned his teeth with his tongue, and, slowly, started to laugh. There was no malice in his chuckles, no mockery, no disdain.
<name>Heyst</name>	Heyst	Hakan	Most men were as laconic as himself, and the rest were too eager to tell their own stories to listen to anybody else. Whether [MASK] spoke or not—whether he even seemed engaged at all or not—had almost no effect on others.
<name>Lucinda</name>	Lucinda	Hakan	Life! Feel it return! The vitality, the vim, the vigor! And even if you're healthy, try my specific for that extra zing, zip, and zest!” A small group of people had gathered around the wheelbarrow. [MASK] was enraptured.
<name>Can you imagine?” [MASK] asked again. “The relief. The freedom.” Four more people died over the next few days, and each of them was ferried out into the desert at dusk. The survivors healed. The never-ending lullaby stopped.	Can you imagine?” [MASK] asked again. “The relief. The freedom.” Four more people died over the next few days, and each of them was ferried out into the desert at dusk. The survivors healed. The never-ending lullaby stopped.	Lorimer	Can you imagine?” [MASK] asked again. “The relief. The freedom.” Four more people died over the next few days, and each of them was ferried out into the desert at dusk. The survivors healed. The never-ending lullaby stopped.
<name>He</name>	He	Hakan	Cool air came wafting from the depths. The feeling was so pleasant, [MASK] had to take a step back when he pictured himself plunging into the shady chasm. The deep gorge, branching out in angular streams, looked like a black horizontal flash of lightning.
<name>Wallace</name>	Wallace	Lorimer	A kind of worried severity took over [MASK]’s face, and though he never said a word, he plainly disagreed with the party’s intentions. The naturalist made sure to ride at the front of the convoy and seemed eager to be the first to reach the Indians.
<name>Jedediah</name>	Jedediah	Hakan	In time, however, between the deadfall and the glue (which, once cool, became an amber block that could be melted and reused over and over again), [MASK] managed to catch a decent number of prairie dogs, ferrets, weasels, badgers, rats, hares, and even small dogs.
<name>Roark</name>	Roark	Lorimer	He took the teeth, and the man lay back down, physically and morally relieved. A woman next to him requested [MASK]'s attention and produced a pouch of her own. She had fewer teeth and only one, displayed with great pride, was unmarred.
<name>He</name>	He	Hakan	They could not spare any of their horses, but they referred him to a man a few wagons up who had more livestock than anyone else in that company. He thanked the couple and caught up with the man in question. After a short and failed exchange, [MASK] stated his request.
<name>Now</name>	Now	Hakan	While retaining their shape, the pearly waves became bristly knolls, and the gelatinous surface was harshened by dust and sagebrush. A gang of buffalo came out from behind the eyes and ambled through the hills. Now [MASK] knew he was dreaming and lost interest.
<name>Boxer</name>	Boxer	Hakan	The skin on [MASK]’s hands and shoulders (where he fitted the leather harness to pull the cart) was, for the most part, gone, and the exposed flesh glistened, pale pink, under the viscous honey-colored varnish of incipient infection.
<name>Granger</name>	Granger	Jarvis	“They can’t get close enough. They can’t.” “But for how long can we hold up?” asked a woman. “Oh, weeks,” replied [MASK] with a dismissive swat. “But they won’t stay for weeks.
<name>John</name>	John	Jarvis	[MASK] wondered aloud. He walked back to his horse, grabbed the blanket rolled up behind his saddle, went back to the half-buried wheel, spread the fabric over it, and began, once again, with the long process of reloading.
<name>John</name>	John	Hakan	Heading north for about a fortnight, [MASK] would eventually come to a river (which would be badly needed by then], and a few days later, a major emigrant trail—even if he strayed off course, it would be impossible to miss that line stretching from coast to coast.
<name>Rainsford</name>	Rainsford	Hakan	And all those animals. From everywhere. Of every kind. Even reptiles.” A brief silence. “And that lion.” What [MASK] saw in the captain’s eyes as he uttered those last words made him roll up the coat and glance toward the staircase.
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	James	The fat man sighed, signaled in his direction with a soft hand, and apologized in a tired, somewhat maternal tone. Then he turned back to [MASK] and asked him another question, always smiling, always polite.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Hakan	It did not sound like English. He tried again in a guttural, harsh language. [MASK] looked at him, rubbing his raw wrists. Noticing this, the man apologized once more, and mimicked a delirious, raving man, kicking and punching the air.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Hakan	What [MASK] had just been told seemed to him as remote as the stars above—so distant from any idea ever taught to him, so removed from any thought that he could have come up with himself, that it would have defied even his brother’s imagination.
<name>John</name>	John	Asa	Days and weeks went by. [MASK] believed that if they waited long enough, their pursuers, seeing how hostile the conditions were, would abandon that course and head west ahead of them—and there was nothing better, he said, than being behind one’s chasers.
<name>Thaddeus</name>	Thaddeus	Lorimer	[MASK], sullen after his unsuccessful first day at the salt lake, refused dinner and went to work in the wagon. Later that night, the men huddled around the small fire (wood had become a major concern) while the naturalist remained in the outskirts of the circle of light, a solitary bulk.
<name>Enrique</name>	Enrique	Linus	He looked for [MASK] among the silhouettes distorted by the quivering light, making his way through screaming and sleeping babies, laughing and haggard women, and sturdy and weeping men. With increasing despair, he rushed back on deck, through waving crowds and busy sailors.
<name>Heracles</name>	Heracles	Hakan	When he woke up from his long, mossy sleep, he set a few traps and got to work on his coat. Inevitably, the garment came together around the skin of the lion. [MASK] had taken good care to strip it off making as few incisions as possible to preserve the integrity of its shape.
<name>he</name>	he	Lorimer	This stronghold had become a thriving trading post for trappers and emigrants, and there [MASK] would find rest, supplies, fresh horses, and maybe even a whole new party, should he want one. They shook hands on it.
<name>Antoine</name>	Antoine	Hakan	Staying in the dugout, however, did not mean a motionless life. All day long, [MASK] walked up and down the covered trenches, repairing tiles, digging, and fueling fires, always smelling the resinous scent coming from the pine-tree ceilings.
<name>Jed</name>	Jed	Josiah	Back out in the plains, the sheriff took some of the money from a pouch hidden deep under his clothes and called his men. “Here, boys. A little taste before the reward.” [MASK] took the money with meek greediness, giving profuse thanks.
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Hakan	“Yes, Captain.” “And some meat,” he added, briskly walking away. “Thank you. I’m leaving,” said [MASK]. “I must go.” The captain stopped, paused, as if suddenly remembering something, and then turned around.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Jarvis	His closest men, the ones who had given him the most, were the ones who trusted him the least, precisely because their dependence on him was absolute. Right before the big rainstorm, the tension had become palpable, and mutiny was in the air. [MASK] had grown distrustful.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Hakan	"Inside.” “Quite a place you got here,” a gray soldier said. "Quite a place.” “How did you do it?” the blue soldier asked, ignoring his friend’s remark. “I dig,” [MASK] responded.
<name>he</name>	he	Hakan	In the shade of their own leaves, each one of these stunted bushes bore clusters of a fleshy kind of berry [MASK] had never seen before. Hundreds of these shrubs were planted at regular intervals, rather close to one another, in straight lines separated by the exact same distance.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Hakan	The beast! And just look! Isn’t he truly a beast?” The sheriff pulled up the lion’s head from [MASK]’s back and fitted it on his head, like a hood. His face vanished in the dark. Gasps and a sudden silence.
<name>James</name>	James	Hakan	Then, one morning, overcome by despair after a fruitless examination, [MASK] put his head to the horse’s midline in a loving rather than a clinical way. He heard a rustling sound, the lull of waves rolling in and out of a sandy beach.
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Jarvis	They took six or eight paces toward the wagon wheel. [MASK] took aim and fired. He was more deliberate this time and took a short moment before each one of the six shots. The wheel, however, remained untouched. “Could the shots have gone between the spokes?”
<name>Eragon</name>	Eragon	Asa	He could not leave him there, alone. Not even for an instant. He wished he could ask [MASK] what to do. "1 will come back," he said and, before becoming paralyzed by doubt again, turned around and dashed downhill toward their horses.
<name>Candide</name>	Candide	Hakan	They were always just behind the horizon. And so was winter. Seeking to avoid further encounters with the last stragglers on the trail and looking for milder weather, [MASK] headed south, always with a slight slant east.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Hakan	When he tried to cover his crotch, she gently took his hands in hers, which were gemmed, cold, and unused. From a little side table, she picked up a pair of cuffs and secured them to [MASK]’s sleeves with expert care, fastening them with gold cuff links studded with rubies.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Hakan	The eye could reach only a few feet into the dubious gloom, but the ear got a sense of the depth of the city from the distant layers of laughter and brawls. One of these fights sounded so violent that [MASK] felt compelled to ride in that direction.
<name>Thorn</name>	Thorn	Hakan	They walked along the edge, looking for a way down at each angular fork, but the incline was always too steep for the horses. Never had [MASK] witnessed desolation at such a scale. The deserts he had crossed so far had felt alive compared to this landscape.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Hakan	[MASK] often fainted and sometimes, without knowing how long he had been unconscious, was woken by a hand slapping his face. He was taken to the outhouse twice a day, shortly after his meals, which were given to him in his room.
<name>John</name>	John	Hakan	It was remarkably lighter now that the sand had been cleaned out, and he had little trouble putting the organ back in place. As a precaution, [MASK] left the horse tied down on the ground for the first two days and kept giving him a low dose of sedative.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Hakan	Once back by his horse with his donkey and his equipment, [MASK] laid out a waxed canvas tarp, boiled his instruments in the murky water (humming, like the short-haired man), washed his hands as best he could, and took all his clothes off.
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Asa	They tried different kinds of splints and straps, but once he got on the saddle, the pain was always too intense. Defeated, [MASK] picked a more secluded recess where they would settle down for a few weeks. Time went by slowly.
<name>Grady</name>	Grady	Hakan	“How long have you been here?” “I don’t know.” “You’re a legend, you know.” Again, his feet. One of the civilians took a swig from a flask and offered it to [MASK], who shook his head.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Hakan	The sun had just risen above its own red glow when [MASK] spotted four orderly plumes of smoke separated from each other by the same distance. He would have been unable to say why, but there was something in the density, texture, and color of the smoke that spoke to him of hearths and hobs.
<name>Rooster</name>	Rooster	Hakan	It turned out that the stallion that [MASK] had taken was dear to one of the victims’ relatives, and there was an additional reward for bringing the fugitive with it-—dead, alive, with horse, in increasing amounts.
<name>Emilio</name>	Emilio	Linus	But the main virtue his brother and the naturalist shared was their ability to endow the world with meaning. The stars, the seasons, the forest—[MASK] had stories about them all, and through these stories life was contained, becoming something that could be examined and understood.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Asa	He removed his hands from his face. As if waking up, he opened his eyes and kneeled at [MASK]’s feet. He grabbed his ankle, delicately moved it up and down and side to side, and suddenly, with abrupt violence, pulled.
<name>the victim</name>	the victim	Caleb	Finally, as if she had made a sudden decision, she stopped. Still staring down at [MASK], the lady muttered a few words to one of her men, who, in turn, signaled to two of his companions. Together, they carried the body away.
<name>He</name>	He	Lorimer	“I don't know.” “Roughly.” “I don’t know.” [MASK] proceeded to write down the dimensions of his skull, the extension of his spine, and the length and girth of his limbs, while shaking his head.
<name>John</name>	John	Hakan	[MASK] looked down and raised his hand to indicate he was leaving. “No, no, no, no,” she remonstrated. “We must thank you. Please.” “No, thank you.” “But you look so tired.”
<name>Jed</name>	Jed	Munro	Only a few men shyly chuckled along while the majority pretended not to have heard the prospector’s remark or seen him spit. “Come on, [MASK]," one of his companions pleaded, gently pulling him by the arm.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Jarvis	With the fifth bullet, the wheel toppled over. [MASK] walked over and finished the contraption off with his last shot. The demanding march, the nightly procedure of driving the wagons into a circle to hold the cattle, the brief meals, the hurried morning preparations were repeated daily without change.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	James	“Now,” he repeated. [MASK] looked at the mine with quivering lips. He had the expression of an obsequious dog ordered to follow a command it did not understand. He glanced toward the secret hole where he hid his gold.
<name>Thaddeus</name>	Thaddeus	Hakan	They were wrapped and rewrapped by a thick, grainy whirlpool. They could have almost grabbed fistfuls of ashes from the air. The world ended right after their horses' ears. They dismounted, and [MASK] followed the naturalist into the heart of the smoke cloud.
<name>Grimes</name>	Grimes	Jarvis	“Bread. Haven’t had bread for ages,” replied the leader, a man in a hat with the crown belled out, while discreetly gesturing his companions to specific positions. “Somebody! Bread!” shouted [MASK]. There was a moment of hesitation.
<name>Alaric</name>	Alaric	Lorimer	If [MASK] was right, the vastness around him was now his flesh. And yet, nothing—not the countless footsteps taken or knowledge acquired, not the adversaries bested or the friends made, not the love felt or the blood shed—had made it his.
<name>Levinson</name>	Levinson	Lorimer	Among those who made a quick recovery was an old man with short, very precisely trimmed white hair—an exception among his long-haired companions. [MASK]’s work would have proved impossible without his help. Nobody dared to oppose his advice or his commands.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Hakan	He stirred around but found himself firmly tied down. Lifting his head, he saw cages flapping with birds, baskets crawling with insects, and wicker trunks hissing with snakes. [MASK] thought that his recovery had been just an illusion and that he was still trapped in one of his nightmares.
<name>Thaddeus</name>	Thaddeus	Jarvis	They did not understand each other easily, but [MASK], making good use of his appearance, persevered with jovial tenacity. He was particularly curious about the Clangston lady and her gang (How many men? What kind of weapons? Where exactly was the town?).
<name>David</name>	David	Hakan	The shaking subsided. [MASK] touched the skin over the fracture. It was tight, like a full bladder. For the first time, he was scared of a body—of hurting it, of the power its frailty had over him.
<name>Space</name>	Space	Hakan	Hello? Hello? Hello?” the sheriff suddenly croaked in rapid succession. Laughs. Space kept swelling within [MASK]. He was now an unlit universe. How could he ever have thought the world an enormous place? It was nothing compared to his expanding emptiness.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Hakan	“Too many days lost here. We can't outrun anybody. But maybe we can lose them.” One night, after much hesitation, feeling foolish for having waited for so long, [MASK] asked, “What is the canon?”
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Hakan	At that exact moment, as [MASK] was staring into the dark, most of them were probably alive. At that exact moment, most of them were doing something—the schoolchildren, now young men, plowing and milking; the sailors securing mooring lines; the horses staring into space;
<name>Clangston</name>	Clangston	Lorimer	He was particularly curious about the Clangston lady and her gang (How many men? What kind of weapons? Where exactly was the town?). The precise destination of [MASK]’s tracker and his men was another matter he came back to over and over again.
<name>Juan</name>	Juan	Hakan	But now, for the first time, terror was suspended in a silent void. Between each distant, laborious breath, [MASK] barely felt his heart beat. Every now and then, he heard his animals cropping grass, their molars making the sound of pebbles in the water.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jarvis	Aside from a few holes in some wagon bonnets, the shots on both sides had been as good as blanks. The besiegers broke their formation and got together to confer. “They’ll never get us,” said [MASK] in a loud whisper to the whole party.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Hakan	The bitterness was already a relief. “I killed those men,” [MASK] managed to say under his breath. "Quiet,” the man said softly. “But not the girl. Not the friends. Just those men. Nobody else.”
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Lorimer	With one of [MASK]’s scalpels, he cut off the toe caps. His toes, dissociated from the rest of his feet, stuck out and protruded over the soles like blind albino worms. Gradually, the salt flats were reduced to crystal ripples on the dirt.
<name>Candide</name>	Candide	Jarvis	They took longer at rivers, made several unjustified stops, and never caught up with the wagons that constantly overtook them. Many believed their captain was stalling and extending the journey so that he could keep collecting his offerings. To this, [MASK] replied that he had never asked for anything.
<name>Theron</name>	Theron	Hakan	Despite its terrors, a uniform expanse could be calming. [MASK] knew this well—he had often forgotten himself and become nothing with the void around him, and those oblivious moments were the only mercy the desert had shown him. But there was something asphyxiating about those regular cells.
<name>David</name>	David	Hakan	Once she was done with the clipping, the woman moved on to filing, and then to cutting and pushing up the cuticles with a flat, sharp-edged tool, which made [MASK] wince and instinctively withdraw his hand. The woman clasped his wrist tighter and stabbed his hand with the tool.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lorimer	From his ankle, that vortex of bone and tendons and flesh, the infection had crept up his calf, and his leg had been amputated at the knee. As soon as he regained some of his vigor, he called [MASK] to his side.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Hakan	The drawing was rudimentary, and he had not seen his own face in a long time, but his main traits were there. Surely, it was a coincidence—it had to be someone else. Still stunned by the resemblance, [MASK] turned around and walked out.
<name>Eustace</name>	Eustace	Hakan	For the first time, [MASK] was almost glad to have been forced to go on this journey: after his long trip and all the unimaginable adventures that lay ahead, he would arrive a grown man, and, for once, surprise his brother with tales of his own.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Hakan	After those events, life sank back into its unaltered routine. Although unused to violence, [MASK] started to hatch an escape plan that vaguely involved the blunt knife he used for his meals. He was encouraged by his own size, which an increasing number of his captors found intimidating.
<name>Darwin</name>	Darwin	Lorimer	[MASK] declined. The man insisted with great vehemence. The scene was repeated a few times until the naturalist understood that rejecting the gift was not only a great offense but also detrimental to his patient’s health—the argument had consumed most of his strength.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Hakan	Whenever [MASK] coughed or said a word out loud, his own voice sounded monstrous, like that of an ungainly giant, an invader in his own home. It was a relief that the clay walls sucked in these awkward growls immediately, without leaving a trace.
