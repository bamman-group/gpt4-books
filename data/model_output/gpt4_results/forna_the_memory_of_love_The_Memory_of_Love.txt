<name>She</name>	She	Saffia	[MASK] closed the door behind her and stood holding on to the handle, her back to me. When she returned she had withdrawn from me further still. My visit had become untenable. Even so, I couldn’t bring myself to leave.
<name>John</name>	John	Kai	There is the cooker. The fndge is gone. Old newspapers and plastic bags fill the sink. [MASK] tries a tap, nothing. Idly he tries a tight switch, and is amazed when the bulb flickers on. The house smells of mildew and dust.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Adrian	So this is how the entire course of a hfe, of history, is changed. A day later [MASK] stands at the window and watches the men rake the grass. They are nearly finished now and the work has done much to raise their spirits.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Agnes	Dark smoke drifted beyond the roofs of the houses and the dusty smell of burning brick reached the square, carrying with it the magnitude of what was happening that day. In the middle of the square [MASK]’s husband, the eldest of the men, was struggling under the weight of one of the corpses.
<name>Rebus</name>	Rebus	Kai	Fourteen, sixteen at most. Someone had tried to remove her clothing. She lay in the street in a scarlet bra and panties, doubtless at one time looted from an upmarket boutique. The people who lived there refused [MASK] and his team leave to touch the body.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Johnson	He wants to find a way under her skin. He wants to make her think about him and nobody else, to show her what he can do. He wants to matter. She disappears downstairs and comes back with two beers, hands him one. ‘That man, [MASK].’
<name>Adrian</name>	Adrian	Johnson	He had even stolen my cake. [MASK] cleared his throat. ‘You will be more comfortable if you sit.’ I was about to decline a second time when I changed my mind, seeing how absurdly I was behaving. I was only delaying my own departure.
<name>Malone</name>	Malone	Explore	‘[MASK]. Debride. Remove any necrotic tissue.’ He blows out under his face mask. ‘Textbook stuff. Still, looks like this is going to set us back a bit.’ What time is it?
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Kai	‘Will you help me with the chairs before you go?’ ‘Sure.’ ‘We can do it now, together.’ [MASK] waves his fork. ‘Don’t worry. You go ahead. I’ll get it done before I go.’
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Kai	How goes it?’ The child doesn’t reply, but pulls [MASK]’s arm around him and buries his face in his side. Together they walk up to the house. ‘Is your mother home?’ ‘Yes. But she’s gone out again.
<name>Jennifer</name>	Jennifer	Candy	She greets the two women and sets the plate down on the table. ‘Hey, that looks great!’ [MASK] says, her tone gushing now. ‘And this place, too.’ ‘Thank you. I’ll get some more plates.’
<name>He</name>	He	Adrian	He stands and surveys the scene, then turns and heads in the direction of the kitchen. Boiling water for coffee [MASK] hears the sound of the door and fetches down a second cup from the cupboard. He realises, suddenly, how empty he has felt these past weeks.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Saffia	[MASK]’s hand on his cheek. No sound save the banging of my own heart. What a terrible stillness there is, once the heat and the light have left a body. The death mask, a look of sheer indifference to you, the living.
<name>Stavrogin</name>	Stavrogin	Johnson	I banged on the door and nobody came. ‘Nobody came for one, two, I don’t recall how many hours. I was left alone. But in the end somebody did come. Not [MASK], for he had gone home, one of his guards.
<name>One</name>	One	Midnight	He blows out under his face mask. ‘Textbook stuff. Still, looks like this is going to set us back a bit.’ What time is it? [MASK]? One o’clock. He doesn’t know and, now he thinks about it, doesn’t care.
<name>Jonas</name>	Jonas	Abass	Much later, after they have swum together, he watches [MASK] play on alone in the waves, crashing through the surf over and over. And he feels his love for the boy rise in his chest, pressing against his ribcage, crushing his lungs and his heart, as if it would suffocate him.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Adrian	[MASK] smiles. ‘Guess.’ ‘Something to do with your patient, right?’ ‘Yes.’ She gazes at the map, then shakes her head. ‘Tell me.’ ‘They’re all the places she was found before she was brought here.’
<name>Quirke</name>	Quirke	Abass	Inside [MASK]’s head he can sense the child’s brain working, trying to form thoughts out of feeling, thoughts which will in turn give rise to the questions, questions that have yet to crystallise. One day. Three o’clock in the morning.
<name>David</name>	David	Adrian	The breath comes fast and hard from their lips, their bodies tremble. They are holding each other, laughing. [MASK] opens his eyes and is instantly awake. The sun is strong and the sky a deep blue.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Abass	He put the phone in his pocket and for a quarter-hour more remained sitting on the bench, watching the children on their way home from school. ‘I think it’s ready now.’ [MASK] is staring into the recesses of the saucepan. ‘OK.
<name>Yunior</name>	Yunior	Kai	[MASK] lies still and lets his mind follow the rhythm of the child’s breathing until it drowns the howling of the dogs. Until he sleeps. The static on the line sounds like the breathing of unseen listeners. ‘Can you hear me?’
<name>John</name>	John	Kai	The doctor follows him to the door and calls the next patient. In the street [MASK] hails a taxi. Time is short. A cab pulls over and he checks the driver’s route, squeezes in next to the other passengers.
<name>Yasmin</name>	Yasmin	Saffia	I nodded to her, but if she noticed she ignored me. I heard her say something to [MASK], I can’t tell you what, because I didn’t, don’t speak their language, but it was all there, in the scolding tone.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Kai	[MASK] needs to talk to his cousin, to make her listen. For now he says, ‘We’ll talk about that another time. Meanwhile you apologise to your mother and then you and I can do something.’
<name>Arjun</name>	Arjun	Kai	For [MASK] there is something elemental about it, like bathing in a stream or making a journey by foot. While the food cooks he goes to wash, dousing himself in water from the bucket in the corner of the bathroom.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Mamakay	He is shown into a small room, given a cup of coffee. He has made few friends at the hospital, did not think his relationship with [MASK] was well known. He is considerably older than most of them. And yet here they are, showing him kindness.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Adrian	At the sink [MASK] watches him wash his hands with meticulous care, examining the cuticles and searching under the fingernails for grains of dirt. From the doorway he raises his hand in a salute. ‘So. Next time.’ He shdes his feet into his flip-flops.
<name>Yusra</name>	Yusra	Kai	The local nurses, though, show less surprise. And [MASK] recognises the expression of the mothers. It is submission, submission in the face of the inevitable. People think war is the worst this country has ever seen: they have no idea what peace is like.
<name>John</name>	John	Adrian	He noticed she didn’t hck her fingers clean like most of the others, but poured water over them into a basin from a plastic kettle by the side of her bed. [MASK] approached her from where she could see him. She gave no indication of having heard him.
<name>James</name>	James	Julius	I had no regrets, I was not being maudlin. I say simply that I had a sharp sense of my own mortality. I had never possessed the kind of fearlessness one finds so often in the very young - in my brother, before his illness. In [MASK].
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Abass	He turned into the street. In the half-light, [MASK] was standing staring ahead in the middle of the road, his hands hanging limply by his sides. Beyond him a man lay on the ground. It took ten minutes to reach the car.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Balia	They laughed. Somewhere close by a shell exploded. Somebody threw a bottle, which smashed in the comer of the room. One of the boys pulled [MASK] up by the arm and began to yank at her clothing, push his hands between her legs.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Robert	She smiles softly at him as she takes her seat. He is about to ask her if she is all right, when a disturbance at the bar draws his attention away. It is [MASK], he appears to be involved in an argument.
<name>Onyesonwu</name>	Onyesonwu	Soulay	‘Here.’ He taps the side of his head. ‘They put it inside your head. Afterwards you are powerful. You do battle.’ On the cheekbone below his temple is a series of short, thick keloid scars. His name is [MASK].
<name>Chigozie</name>	Chigozie	Kai	[MASK] exhales lightly with frustration. ‘What’s up, my friend?’ ‘All she does is go to church.’ ‘Who, your mother? Your mother is a Christian: that’s a good thing, isn’t it?’
<name>He</name>	He	Adrian	[MASK] can’t be sure whether he has heard the question or not. Suddenly the other man looks up at him. ‘I could eat,’ he announces. ‘I’ll make us breakfast.’ ‘There’s nothing much here.’
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Agnes	An orchid, dark and dense, crouches on a branch above him. He ponders [MASK] and her journeys. Fugue, they call it in his profession, a condition in which the body and the disturbed spirit are joined in shadowy wanderings.
<name>Reek</name>	Reek	Yalie	The thin men stood back while he hacked at the nursery worker’s neck with the blade, picked up the head and tossed it to [MASK], who instinctively reached out to catch it. The thin men cheered again.
<name>He</name>	He	Adrian	In the silence a prickle of self-consciousness touches him. He shifts from one foot to the other. Watching the newcomer move around the kitchen, his kitchen, as though he were a man entirely alone in his own space, it is [MASK] who feels like the intruder.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Kai	[MASK] was put into the back of the same car and driven through the town to a pharmacy, where his captors looted the shelves of morphine, sterile dressings, rubber gloves, saline solution and IV equipment under his instruction. A heavy wooden door served as the operating table.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Julius	A lie, of course. [MASK] had been gone nearly a year, but that didn’t stop people trying. I saw how tired she was beginning to look, how weary of it all. The grant money was just about to come to an end.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Adrian	The owner brings over two bottles of beer and waves at them to take their time. [MASK] says, ‘Are you sure you’re reading that right? As you say, children can place different interpretations on things. There could be another explanation.’ ‘OK.
<name>Forrest</name>	Forrest	Foday	That was the easy part. Next they’d tackle the feet. If [MASK] had been treated by doctors as a baby it would have been a simple job; now he was an adult the operation was complicated. More so if they had to lengthen the Achilles tendon.
<name>he</name>	he	Adrian	The older man’s thinness is pitiful, the shadow of his ribs visible either side of the sternum. The slack skin falls away from the bone, a cloth slung over a heap of sticks. ‘Stay, stay,’ as [MASK] prepares to withdraw.
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Binta	[MASK] listened. At first the talk sounded to her like a political speech, with words like ‘government’ and ‘elections’. He told them the government had betrayed the people, and he spoke a name that before she had only read in the newspapers.
<name>David</name>	David	Julius	I took the only option available. It occurred to me briefly, as I stepped out of the sun and into the shop, that perhaps [MASK] was using the car. But by then I had ascertained he spent long hours on campus. And in that matter I was correct.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Saffia	With her I did not feel wanting, second-best. All very banal, I’m sure. Believe me, I was aware of it at the time. It made no difference.’ ‘And you were at her home at the time of [MASK]’s car accident?’
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Seligmann	Now here he is, in a country far from home, operating where he is still needed. His wife stays in the house, occupied with their grandchildren, lunches and life-drawing classes. [MASK] calls her every day, never returns home for more than two weeks at a time.
<name>Dr. Adams</name>	Dr. Adams	Kai	Is this what it’s like?’ [MASK] nods. ‘Mild deliriums, maybe. The medication can sometimes have that effect, not just the illness.’ A movement at the window on the other side of the room causes them both to turn.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Julius	[MASK]. What had he got me involved in? That moment, during the night before, when I’d seen myself from the outside, not myself — the vacant space I occupied — I knew my limitations. I knew I was no hero.
<name>John</name>	John	Adrian	Fifty yards on there is another left turn and [MASK] takes it, then changes his mind and decides to turn back. There is just enough space to execute a three-point turn, and he does so badly, tyres spinning on the gravel road, clutch whining.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Kai	‘No. But if you find a picture for me, I would like that. Do you wish me to return the radio?’ ‘No,’ says [MASK]. ‘You hold on to it.’
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Nenebah	He watched her smile vanish. They’d greeted each other with the formality of lovers whose wound is not yet healed. So unlike [MASK], the careful solicitous voice, asking after his mother, his father and even his sister with whom she had rarely seen eye to eye.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Vanessa	‘Well, that’s just it,’ I said. ‘I’m afraid to tell you [MASK] and I won’t be marrying after all.’ ‘Oh.’ She was genuinely taken aback by this, as of course she would be.
<name>Forde</name>	Forde	Banton	In time I levered myself back to my feet and went to sit behind the desk, swivelled the chair around to face the bookshelves. I selected a volume and brought it down. [MASK]’s West African City, published under the auspices of the International African Institute.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Adrian	He shakes his head and forces his eyes open. He is not sleeping well and sleep, when it comes, chooses inopportune moments. He hasn’t been home in three days, going instead straight from the theatre to [MASK]’s apartment.
<name>He</name>	He	Kai	He saw the man with the panama hat sitting behind the wheel of his car. A soldier opened the car door, the man climbed down and the soldier took his place behind the wheel. [MASK] could see the man’s mouth, an oval of protest.
<name>Blue</name>	Blue	Mamakay	‘[MASK],’ he repeats. So he never forgets it. ‘It’s my house name,’ she says, as if in reply to a question. ‘Sorry?’ ‘It’s my house name. You know, not your real name but the one everyone calls you.
<name>James</name>	James	Kai	Vehicles sweep past, swerving, overtaking, sometimes stopping abruptly to allow a passenger to descend or pick up another. [MASK] is silent, giving his concentration to the road. Around the bend of the hill the road narrows suddenly, encroached upon by a marketplace.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Johnson	She declined my offer to accompany her home. She wasn’t sure yet where she was going, whether back to [MASK] or to the lawyer’s office. She had a few errands to run in the meantime. ‘Call me if you hear anything.’
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Kai	While they wait for the mixture to boil [MASK]’s thoughts are occupied with the events of his day. First thing he had gone into town to the Embassy for an appointment with an immigration liaison officer, who told him his application was being processed and gave him a further set of forms.
<name>Dr. Smith</name>	Dr. Smith	Seligmann	‘Under or over?’ They assess the point of entry, agree to go in under the muscle. [MASK] makes the first incision. Blood oozes from the wound. ‘Tourniquet,’ he says. The nurse tightens the tourniquet further.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Alex	‘OK. By the way, if you see [MASK], tell him I’m looking for him.’ ‘Will do.’ He smiles back at her, feeling like a hypocrite. After lunch in the staff room a game of boules is under way.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Kai	He managed two more steps. Blocking his way was the self-appointed leader, he of the cocky grin. ‘Please step aside,’ said [MASK]. The boy grinned at him. ‘Get out of my way.’
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Saffia	We talked a while of unimportant matters. At some point — I can’t remember how we got there - [MASK] told me she had newly acquired a camera and asked if she could take my picture. ‘Of course,’ I replied.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Naasu	Then suddenly everything turned black, leaving only a circle of light. She sent the girl out to buy medicine because [MASK] wasn’t at home, she had travelled to the wedding of a classmate in another town, she had been gone for two days and was not due for two more.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Kekura	We told them he had been called away on a family matter. No news of [MASK]. The dancer fellow, I remember, dropped by. Somehow he had heard what had happened and he arrived, throwing out offers of help, claiming to have various contacts here and there among the police.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Adrian	[MASK] nods. She pushes open the door. The smell hits him and clots in the back of his throat - fermented and feral, the smell of hiding places and of stale fear. He begins to breathe in short, shallow breaths, drawing air in through his mouth.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Julius	[MASK] didn’t like to be alone, he required companionship. He sought out my company, and in many ways, it seemed to me, he had come to depend upon it. Once we made a trip to the casino. We were together without either of our women.
<name>Dean</name>	Dean	Julius	I gave him my notebooks in return for my freedom. I never returned to the cell in the basement. In those first few minutes I was so relieved to be free I forgot all about [MASK]. The Dean accompanied me to my office in the faculty building to collect the notebooks.
<name>Yemi</name>	Yemi	Abass	In the kitchen he quarters a pawpaw deftly with a large knife, offers a slice to his cousin, who shakes her head. [MASK] is gone already, his satchel bouncing on his back. The two cousins eat together in silence for a few minutes, each with their own preoccupations.
<name>Rita</name>	Rita	Saffia	I told [MASK] to stay where she was and stepped out of the car. I told him I admired the job he was doing, and his thoroughness. I brought out my packet of cigarettes and offered him one, as well as a little something to buy some food.
<name>more</name>	more	Lisa	He has to admire her gift for putting her finger right on top of it. He tries for flippancy and fails. ‘Someone has to do it.’ His words are followed by a burst of background laughter, the scrape of chairs, someone calling for [MASK].
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Julius	If you rile them, you might end up making things worse for [MASK].’ She looked at me steadily. ‘I know you’re just trying to help.’ She drew a deep breath: ‘I’ve been to see a lawyer,’ she announced.
<name>John</name>	John	Ileana	He begins to breathe in short, shallow breaths, drawing air in through his mouth. The room is in twilight. Presently he is able to make out two rows of beds and mattresses, each one with a figure lying or sitting on it. [MASK] walks up the centre aisle.
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Julius	Oh, you know [MASK].’ She laughed lightly and added, ‘Or maybe you don’t. My husband has many strong points. Timekeeping isn’t one of them.’ And so we stood, making conversation against the barrage of noise, at other times simply watching the people around us.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Kekura	‘A man was nearly lost in space.’ This from [MASK]. I realised I recognised his voice from the radio, high and hectoring. ‘Come now! What is it they say? How do you make an omelette without breaking a few eggs?
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Saffia	He reached out and picked up his beer. Suddenly his face cracked into a great grin. ‘The day the first African lands on the moon!’ The laughter erupted just as [MASK] opened the sliding door to call us to eat.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Adrian	‘How do you feel?’ ‘Yes, sir. I feel better.’ [MASK] takes a breath. He says, ‘OK. Close your eyes. Now think about your special place. You can tell me about it if you want.’
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Adrian	‘Thanks,’ says the man, as he steps over the threshold into the apartment. His movements are exact, assured, unlike [MASK], who fumbles to find a candle and matches, light the candle’s wick and set it on the table.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Johnson	‘I know you’re just trying to help.’ She drew a deep breath: ‘I’ve been to see a lawyer,’ she announced. ‘The lawyer says to give [MASK] two more days and then to issue a writ of habeas corpus.
<name>She</name>	She	Wary	‘Oh.’ She was genuinely taken aback by this, as of course she would be. [MASK] still, though. ‘I didn’t realise. I mean I didn’t know you two were engaged.’ ‘No, of course you wouldn’t.
<name>he</name>	he	Adrian	He is speaking, though [MASK] can distinguish none of the words, which come in a gabbled monotone. Faster now. And louder. Followed by a gasp, as if he had been hit in the chest. Silence. Then the murmuring begins again, softly rising.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Saffia	We both watched the blind man. He sat, a great smile on his upturned face. He wasn’t tapping his feet, or marking the beat with his hand. He was just smiling. [MASK] said, ‘But do you notice how often blind people smile?
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Adrian	Later [MASK] had driven home through the rapidly gathering dusk, not wanting to test his driving skills in the dark. He arrived exhausted and with the beginnings of a headache, had drunk some water and gone soon to bed, to wake a few hours later to this unseasonal coolness.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Kate	Something to do with the water, the sea. Today he is alone. [MASK] is in town with her mother and he is not in the mood for company or sherry, so he lets his thoughts go to her.
<name>He</name>	He	Adrian	‘Yeah, fine, fine. Me and your couch go back a long time. I’m not a big sleeper anyhow. I had to check on my patient.’ ‘How is she doing?’ When there is no reply, [MASK] glances up.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Saffia	Along with the other staff members I took my turn invigilating. I enjoyed the peace, walking the aisles, handing out extra paper, warning the passing of another hour. In those periods of enforced idleness I thought often of [MASK]. The smooth mask of her beauty in repose.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	SafFia	And that now [MASK] was unbuttoning his shirt, pressing her face into his still-powerful chest, murmuring, ‘Don’t go there, please, my darling. It’s too dark. Too dark. Stay with me.’
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Adrian	Is that all right?’ ‘You want to keep straight.’ [MASK] shakes his head, he knows different now. The city has begun to unravel itself for him, he is becoming privy to its secrets and ways, the geography of its contours.
<name>Amina</name>	Amina	Yalie	Outside lean shadows stalked between the tents. They prayed nobody would notice they were four women, protected only by a young boy. The refugees lived in fear of rebel raids, but those never came. Instead two cholera epidemics arrived within the first year. The third took [MASK].
<name>Poirot</name>	Poirot	Johnson	The same phrase that appeared in the newspaper editorial. I think I even made a note of the music that was played. It was all there. [MASK] pounced on it, of course.’ ‘And that was the reason they released you?’ ‘Yes.
<name>James</name>	James	Julius	Once, at the close of the day’s work, [MASK] told me he crept to the edge of the new section, crawling on his belly, and peered over, exhilarated by the drop down to the water, the possibility of being blown away.
<name>Rebus</name>	Rebus	Adrian	A bad night. I was afraid. I didn’t cut him.’ ‘So why do you say that you did?’ ‘I saw the wound.’ Afterwards, as they leave the ward, [MASK] asks, ‘What’s his diagnosis?’
<name>He</name>	He	Adecali	Sometimes you forget where you really are. The day in the ward, for example, when I came to help you, at first you didn’t recognise me, you had forgotten where you really were. Could I be right?’ [MASK] nods.
<name>Mathilda</name>	Mathilda	Nenebah	The laugh comes back to him, time and time again. It comes in the night, and at other unexpected moments, in his dreams - an echo of its pitch and timbre. But from the little girl it comes whole, pure and absolute. It is [MASK].
<name>Alfie</name>	Alfie	Adrian	‘That’s right,’ says [MASK]. ‘And if they both confess, they will get a sentence longer than if they remain silent, but shorter than if one has been informed on by the other.’
<name>hallucinating</name>	hallucinating	Dutch	Possible suicide attempt. He recognises the handwriting as belonging to one of the Swedish doctors, or is he [MASK]? He turns back and searches for the end of another tendon amid the flesh of the woman’s wrist. There it is, narrow and pale.
<name>John</name>	John	Kai	In the darkness the city dogs sang to each other. Somewhere in the long grass a frog called for an unknown mate. [MASK] breathed deeply. He sat down upon the step, his back to the house, and setded down to wait.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Kai	Besides there were whales right here; you could see them from the beach at certain times of the year. With his parents gone [MASK] inhabited the house less and less, and then only in the hours of darkness.
