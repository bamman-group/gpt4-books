<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Clay	It came closer and got louder. She could hear big animals panting, and men yelling faintly from the head of the canyon, and she yanked [MASK]’s shoulder, looked out the window into the half-dark of morning, and shook him again exultantly.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Clay	Your pickers’ camps are over by them fires, ain’t they?” One reason [MASK] had not felt very uneasy about being caught before was that he had seen and sized up all the sheriff’s men whose job it was to catch him.
<name>Shane</name>	Shane	Clay	You might have to cut out a few logs, but it’s a good grade and grass till hell wouldn’t sneeze at it.” It sounded secluded. “I can’t go across the mountains now,” [MASK] told the Indian boy.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Luce	Her father, at a guess, was around fifty years old, and the only thing that seemed in any danger of happening to him was that somebody might shoot him over a fast-handled horse-trade. But [MASK] seemed unable to get him out of her mind.
<name>Smoke</name>	Smoke	Clay	They looked fat and blocky on account of the myrtle-nuts and wapato-root of the damp mud-flats, and [MASK] marked their trail through the wire-grass with interest because they might mean meat to live through the winter on.
<name>He</name>	He	Clay	It was as if she had won a hard race or done something praiseworthy out of her own strength and merit. [MASK] felt proud of her in his sleep and without knowing that he would ever lay eyes on her again.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Luce	That had not been done because the horse-trader was afraid that [MASK] might come over before she was supposed to. But he was always punctual about paying off when these things went against him. Most poor gamblers are good losers, contrary to a widespread belief.
<name>Alfie</name>	Alfie	Clay	“That’s the way I like to see ’em. What are you goin’ to do with that gun?” [MASK] stared and said what gun, which was a waste of time, and bad manners to boot.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Clay	He took a buckskin sack out of his shirt-bosom and clanked it, and then pointed out where the trail to his camp was. [MASK] promised that when he got a little time ahead he would come and see what it looked like.
<name>George</name>	George	Wade	When it’s ready, pretend to drop something and pick this up with it. A pencil or something. I’ll tell you when.” “All right,” [MASK] muttered. “You don’t need to go after them things, I guess.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Clay	“So you’re going to make him answer you, are you?” she said. Her voice had a tone that [MASK] had not heard in it before, a kind of muffled harshness like plucking a bass-fiddle string with one finger muting it.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Clay	At a rough count, there were three hundred and sixty sacks, all unburst and mostly soaked only on the outside, that she had dragged out and saved. [MASK] dropped his bridle-reins and came stumbling through them, and she laughed and called to him.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Drusilla	To hear them talk, finding it would be no job at all, and the law would need a blamed sight more than making and providing to get it away from them when once they got hold of it. [MASK] was a different cut of character.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Luce	How much of that was his being in love with [MASK] and how much his distaste for being classed with the circle of blowhards who spent their evenings rooting for themselves he didn’t know, but it was bad for his nerves.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Luce	The horse-trader’s wagon was climbing the hill. He focused his eyes on it and watched it slip away from them. “I didn’t care anything about her,” he said, haggling over his own exact shades of feeling as [MASK] had done over hers.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Clay	“Nothing’s the matter,” she explained, and dropped her hand on [MASK]’s shoulder. “Nothing except that he’s been worrying all winter about something he needn’t have. Here’s one woman he won’t need to look out for, no matter what climate we’re in.
<name>Jesse</name>	Jesse	Clay	“Roll me one of these things while I rake up this heifer dust I spilt.” [MASK] took the makings through the bars and rolled a cigarette, standing so the men at the desk could see him do it.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Indians	Partly it was that he didn’t want to be pulled in as a witness, but there was somebody there, in the mob of girls hanging over the wounded lavisher of good-as-new frocks on [MASK]. It was the woman who had been the horse-trader’s wife.
<name>Whiskey</name>	Whiskey	Grief	[MASK], instead of making him mellow and forgiving, had soured and hardened him. “Anything of Press Shiveley’s is bad and man-killin’ and treacherous, you can count on that I’d watch this kid, too, if I was you.
<name>Shane</name>	Shane	Wade	The gun came out of his boot crosswise, and he wished [MASK] would untrack himself and talk up so the men would stop watching him. He nodded at them and they looked carefully away while he fumbled the gun with his foot so it would go through.
<name>She</name>	She	Luce	People would find out that there had been shooting in his camp. [MASK] might tell them. If he cautioned her not to, she would wonder what he was trying to dodge. Then the dogs would find the dead man, and she would think he had murdered him.
<name>John</name>	John	Clay	[MASK] realized almost with a jolt that she was speaking to him. “What else do you know?” He knew several other songs, but the beautiful tune had driven all of them out of his head except a couple of ditties of the doghouse school.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Clay	“That’s what they’ll do,” [MASK] said, hoping fervently that he was forecasting correctly. “I’ll saddle your horse for you if you want to come along.” She sat down beside him on the ground and touched her cheek against his shoulder.
<name>Jody</name>	Jody	Clay	The hay-cutters had left [MASK] so he could do his mourning by the grave alone. The shock of the death and burial and buzzards wore off, and there did not seem to be any great sight of material to mourn about.
<name>Chantry</name>	Chantry	Clay	The horse-trader said, low and hurried, that she struggled pretty successfully when there were strange men around. Then he took [MASK] aside and advised him, since he was lined up to become a member of the family, that he ought to do something about the brand on the buckskin mare.
<name>Slade</name>	Slade	Clay	He continued to call, because it didn’t seem possible that the man beside him could have been shot from the fire. The whole column had been packed close, and [MASK] and the lost man were riding with at least a dozen men between them and the wickyup when the shot was fired.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Clay	But the lack of sense didn’t make [MASK] feel any less earnest about it, and it did make him meaner about arguing. “You don’t need to go across the mountains,” he said. “I do.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Clay	He inquired if there were any witnesses, and when they pointed out [MASK] he wanted to know if there was any reward out. They told him no, and he got more sociable. “Mostly I serve papers,” he said.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Drusilla	On the downstairs section, his artless announcement had about the same effect as if he had yanked the roof off the house and galloped away with it. [MASK] backed halfway through the kitchen door with one hand held over her mouth and her eyes dilated.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Luce	Even a man on foot would have had hard work navigating the tangle. For a horse it was impossible until the tide drew clear of the hard sand below it. [MASK] rode into the outer fringe of water and looked out at the ship.
<name>Francis</name>	Francis	Clay	He had his hands wrapped in buckskin bandages as they had been when he was a baby, to keep people from looking at them. He was glad to see [MASK], and he leaned out and greeted him as if there had never been a minute’s dissension between them in their lives.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Clay	On the floor behind the counter was a heap of loose fur pelts, mostly coon and bobcat, with a few mink and fisher scattered in for seasoning. [MASK] waited and thumped on the counter and heard somebody moving on the upper floor, but nobody appeared.
<name>Jody</name>	Jody	Indians	“Don’t you go kickin’ that horse no more. Give him to me if you don’t like him. You lose, huh?” It was the custom in races with [MASK] to lay the stakes out prominently on a blanket at the start.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Clay	Not only was he completely disembowelled, but a lick from a horse’s shoe-calk had opened the top of his skull. The brain was visible through the gash, and it was still throbbing. [MASK] blew out his match again and backed away out into the sagebrush.
<name>Chigurh</name>	Chigurh	Clay	He plays this country regularly, and he’s bound to come your way if you wait long enough. And then come down on him quick, when he’s feeling large and expansive.” “I might do that,” [MASK] said, and held out his hand.
<name>Boon</name>	Boon	Clay	Or else you’d never have got this far from home with her. Do you reckon that guardeen of yours will hunt this far after you?” “He’s liable to,” [MASK] said. A man in a place like that needed something to look forward to.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Zack	“It’s there, and it’s plenty big,” [MASK] said, unblanketing the windows. “I seen it not over two months ago, and I could git my whole foot into it. One of the kids was along, and he tried to poke his head down it.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Luce	He didn’t let on about it to [MASK] because, though she seemed restless, too, he saw that she was keeping deliberately shy of him. Couples in the hop-fields usually stripped their hops into one basket for sociability and the fun of watching it fill up faster.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Clay	The horse-trader’s wife put in that she didn’t call a man hurt when he got his nose bumped, and [MASK] said it didn’t amount to anything. “She waited up for you,” the horse-trader’s wife said.
<name>Indians</name>	Indians	Indians	In winter when trade was slack the roads weren’t fit to be traveled. In summer he had to stay with the store because [MASK] were showing up at all kinds of hours to trade, and his wife refused to have anything to do with them.
<name>Jerry</name>	Jerry	Clay	A big roan draft-horse stuck his nose through the wicket marked “Notes and Collections” as [MASK] peered in, and he nickered pleadingly, much as the original occupant might have done about the time the depositors began to lose confidence.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Clay	The sight of the skinned-headed carrion-guzzlers always made [MASK] sick, and he went to look at the colt so he could leave before they came close. He found out what he wanted to know, and it was what he had known without looking.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Luce	He ended by deciding that [MASK] was worth all he was giving up for her and that he wasn’t giving up much, since his alternatives had been wintering on a reservation with the Indian boy or going to jail.
<name>Wolves</name>	Wolves	Deer	[MASK] would run if they heard people talking. Being able to see pretty well in the moonlight, they were liable to scare all too easily, anyhow. They could have meat or they could have conversation, but they couldn’t have both.
<name>Judgment</name>	Judgment	January	"I can’t have you wavin’ your star and your papers around these camps. You’d scatter these pickers of mine like a bunch of quail, and I’d have this crop left on my hands till [MASK].
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Clay	[MASK] caught up with the hay-cutters, and they had a different opinion about his future arrangements. “That hoss-trader, he gone,” one of them volunteered. “One of the boys seen him pullin’ his outfit for the Mormon Flats early.
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Clay	“I told you she belonged to him,” [MASK] said. “I have got a bill of sale on her, though. Come to think, I had her brand smeared, too. Look here, we can’t make a thing like this work.
<name>Ennis</name>	Ennis	Luce	The two women stayed back, the horse-trader’s wife drooping in the wagon-seat and letting her husband run the program because he could always sound a great deal worse off than she could. [MASK] kept still farther back, among the trailed horses in the shadows.
<name>Ice</name>	Ice	Ice	You can do your own washin’, or you can leave it here at the laundry. We won’t run much past fall, I ought to tell you. [MASK] starts runnin’ in the river then, and we tie up for the winter.
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Burdon	“She knows you shot from camp, too,” [MASK] pointed out. “This man wasn’t killed within pistol-range of your camp. The court won’t hold you, because there won’t be any court.
<name>Joad</name>	Joad	Clay	I stoled this horse and come to tell you. Come on down.” Chapter VIII [MASK] got down in the dark and knocked broken hay out of his hair and spat to clear his mouth of the ammoniacal whang the barn had planted in it.
<name>Call</name>	Call	Clay	He stared from [MASK] to the buckskin mare and back, and said he would be teetotally snuggered if this country, hellhole though it was, didn’t draw everybody in the world. “Ever’ damn thing a-goin’,” he insisted.
<name>Jody</name>	Jody	Clay	To judge serious things by trifles. [MASK] had killed a thieving coyote raiding the sheep, and his mouth had tasted of blood and burnt powder and guiltiness for an entire day. “I won’t do it,” he said.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Clay	Strip off, bub, and a couple of you tads go rustle him a change from the house.” That was a hard one to get out of. It would look idiotic for [MASK] to refuse a change of clothes when his own were wet to the waist.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Wade	The gun on the jail floor lifted the heaviest worry off [MASK]’s mind. Having no longer to think what he was going to do to get out, his brain emerged from its retirement, unfurled its tail, and began to handle chipmunksized game as fiery and efficient as hell.
<name>Jody</name>	Jody	Clay	[MASK] mounted his pony, dropped his rope on an old ewe, and dragged her out across the stubble. She stood being towed like an old bobsledder, but when he kicked her through the gate she trotted around inside, bawling uneasily.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Clay	[MASK] explained that he was looking for a girl who was probably traveling with a horse-trader’s rig. “They’re supposed to have come along this road yesterday night or early this morning. Two wagons, a man and a woman, and a pretty girl that looks like she’d been sick.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Clay	He asked no questions, but when [MASK] mentioned the hundred and fifty dollars his expression became noticeably less uneasy and more cordial. “Well, come on in,” he invited, picking up his lantern. “If your pa sent you out here to talk horse, he sent you to the right place.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Burdon	He knew, better even than [MASK] did, that the men were there to finish him, and that the only thing they still balked at was the physical disagreeableness of the job. It was an oddly insignificant thing that brought them to the point.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Repose	Even when she was cowhiding the horses and her husband, she had been a fine-looking woman. [MASK] showed her off even better. She knew how to look a man up and down as if she were taking stock of all his capabilities and concealing her admiration for them.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Clay	“Cuttin’ hay, and if you poke yourself into my ground again I’ll mow your team off at the knees,” [MASK] said. It had been so long since he had met anybody that he could talk to without introductions that he forgot all about the stolen rifle.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Luce	If he had been three minutes earlier they would have caught him getting his hops weighed. If they had been ten minutes later they would have walked in on him in camp, with [MASK] standing by to watch them haul him away. Nothing had saved him but plain luck.
<name>Ennis</name>	Ennis	Burdon	“We can’t do anything else except go back,” [MASK] replied. “We’d all look like idiots doin’ that. We can take it slow. There’s bound to be sheep where there’s all this pasture, and they’ll slow up the dogs.
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Clay	Do you want to go to the station decent, or do you want me to tie you to the saddle hind side to and turn your horse loose to take you ?” He got up, ready to move fast if [MASK] selected the wrong alternative.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Clay	he inquired. “Giveum back!” He pumped a cartridge into the chamber. His hands and his chin trembled, which, in an Indian, is a sign of serious intentions. [MASK] opened the top of the stove and held the flute over the coals.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Simmons	Then he shaded his eyes and saw that what was coming was the horse-trader and his outfit, bucking back from the summit which he had warned them they would never be able to get across. [MASK] felt pleased that they had been able to make it back.
<name>Jody</name>	Jody	Clay	The sheep stood with her legs spraddled and her head dropped so it almost touched the ground, and the coyote stood watching her and waiting for her to look up. There was still time for [MASK] to have scared him off. A yell would have done it.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Clay	The horses had trouble finding ground that their feet would hold in, and [MASK] suggested, while they floundered and fell down and got up again, that maybe the two passengers ought to get out and wade, to save weight.
<name>Chinook</name>	Chinook	Jargon	[MASK] was the country name for the old Hudson’s Bay Company trade-lingo, the universal conversational vehicle for all Indian tribes along the Northwest Coast, where a forty-mile trip would run a man through six or seven changes of native language, each as different from the others as French is from Gaelic.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Luce	As a place to live during the winter with [MASK], it had seemed a lucky find. When he thought of the woman who had lived in it before him, its poverty and lonely nakedness hit him and filled him with pity and shame.
<name>Beauty</name>	Beauty	Luce	Homeliness may imply all sorts of virtues and weaknesses; beauty implies nothing; the woman it belongs to has had no more part in forming herself so than a square mile of prairie has in getting itself illuminated by a flash of lightning. The Carstairs women were easy to understand, and [MASK] was not.
<name>Grampa</name>	Grampa	Clay	[MASK] said the pleasures of traveling around the country depended a good deal on the people who lived in it. “You blamed near lost us all our horses, wallerin’ around here on that mule. They ain’t used to the smell, and it scared ’em.
<name>Ennis</name>	Ennis	Luce	He would be busy making camp and tending the horses, he didn’t like to leave [MASK] alone, with strange travelers roving around loose, and he didn’t care to sit around a gone-to-hell saloon swigging decayed heel-tap liquor, anyhow.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Clay	[MASK] handed her the whip and remarked that her spirits seemed to have improved. She looked startled, as if she had been caught doing something she shouldn’t, and then admitted it. “This is new country, and I like it,” she said.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Clay	“A pack of Indians claimed this section,” she said. Her breath was coming short and heavy, but she paid no attention when [MASK] ventured that they had better postpone the rest of it till some other time. “They claimed it and wouldn’t move off.
<name>Will</name>	Will	Clay	It had seemed, when [MASK] entered the town, as if almost a full day had passed since sunup. But along the street it was still early morning, with a pleasant smell of stores unfurling their newness for another whirl at the country trade.
<name>Lucette</name>	Lucette	Maud	For me it is better to be old, but [MASK] would not like it. You will let me call a girl for you?” She was quite cordial and over-the-counterish about it, like a bartender inquiring whether he hadn’t better fix something for that cough.
<name>telegram</name>	telegram	Lund	There were all those things I was afraid of. I left on account of all of them.” He said that she hadn’t let out anything; the [MASK] business had been a pure accident, and she oughtn’t to have attached importance to it.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Clay	She watched him come down head first, and then she handed the gun to [MASK] and went and sat on the bed. It was a brisk morning for a nightgown and bare feet, and now that the action was over she felt it.
<name>Jody</name>	Jody	Clay	It isn’t as if you could suit yourself about going; you’ve got to go. And we could buy more sheep with it.” [MASK] said they had more sheep already than they could tend to, and he didn’t have to go.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Burdon	He said so, and felt, because the whisky was getting hold of him, that it was clever of him to suggest it. [MASK] was not quite so much impressed. “Maybe I’ll think of something when I get sober,” he said, hopefully.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Clay	Not even the winter of 1888 could touch it. “You and me are luckier than most of ’em,” he said to [MASK]. “How would a man feel cartin’ a woman through a place like this ?” It was a bad place to cart through.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Clay	[MASK] watched while they lugged in close to two dozen large salmon without relaxing from their attitude of bored apathy, and then signaled that he would be back. He felt as well pleased that they didn’t want to ferry him immediately.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Simmons	It not only quenched her cries of ladylike reproach then, but it fixed her so she hadn’t been able to talk above a whisper since. That occurrence was familiar to everybody, but, being warmed up, [MASK] went ahead with one that wasn’t.
<name>Andy</name>	Andy	Clay	“Tell him, and none of your lip, either. He’s asked you polite enough.” “I won’t do it,” said [MASK], and took the loose near rein and whacked the crazy mare on the tail-end with it.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Orlando	He was scared, and scared bad. He stuttered and trembled at the mouth and stared off to one side as if he was searching for a hole to hide in. He didn’t even get over it when [MASK] explained that this visit was merely to deliver an official recommendation.
<name>Stanley</name>	Stanley	Clay	[MASK] said rudely that as long as she couldn’t do anything about her feelings he didn’t need to have them explained. “You’ve told me to leave and I’ll do it. Where I move to is none of your business. You said that yourself.”
<name>Antonia</name>	Antonia	Luce	It was a good thing he had made the stipulation, for [MASK] came over while they were still talking about it. She started with the three vaqueros. “You men got my father drunk,” she said. “That wasn’t your fault, probably.
<name>Carl</name>	Carl	Clay	He reared up and dug an old single-action pistol from under the bib of his overalls. [MASK] caught his hand and held it down. The noise in the brush was far off because it sounded faint, and human because you could hear twigs dragging against cloth.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Deer	[MASK] never got so high, but there were chipmunks and big snow-rabbits and black foxes and bear, and there was a mark in the light earth where a mountain goat had sat up on his haunches behind a rock, probably to act as a lookout while the settlers’ train passed.
<name>White Fang</name>	White Fang	Clay	Did you fetch anything to eat?” The Indian boy cautioned him to talk lower. Men, he repeated, were hunting [MASK] all over the country and around the toll-bridge station and through the brush and everywhere, because they were mad at him.
<name>Snape</name>	Snape	Zack	He could even, if that looked too risky, turn on [MASK] and order him to step outside for a minute or take a flogging. Whichever way it went, he would have dry clothes and he would be done being pestered about them. It went neither way.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Clay	“You got no right to take him anywhere without I go along. He ought to stay here, anyhow, to be on hand when we’re ready to start.” It was easy to see why he was so firm about [MASK] staying.
<name>Deets</name>	Deets	Simmons	They were skinning out the forelegs when a few flakes of snow fell on the warm stripped meat between them, and [MASK] yelled to them to give it up and run in the horses. They were going to pull camp and move before the storm hit, and there was no time to fool around about it.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Clay	Nobody ever accused me of being a coward, but if I had a girl on my hands that’s what I’d do.” It was the plainly sensible thing to do, but [MASK] couldn’t bring himself to agree.
<name>Jealousy</name>	Jealousy	Luce	He told her so and pulled loose from her hand. Outside, he saddled the buckskin mare, and because [MASK] had been torturing him he cut the mare up with his spurs and flogged her with his quirt to see if it would make him feel better.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Clay	I wasn’t to blame for it?” “No,” [MASK] said. The woman’s uneasiness seemed to have dropped into the ground. She didn’t look gay, exactly, but she looked sure of herself. “You kids!” she said.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Clay	That’s the only way to develop the human race, ain’t it? Do you know what all these laws and etiquettes and not eatin’ with your knife businesses are intended for?” “I never thought about that,” [MASK] said.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Luce	[MASK] spurred her horse to reach him, but she didn’t start soon enough. “This mare ain’t for sale,” he said, all on the peck. “This man wouldn’t have any right to sell her if she was.
<name>she</name>	she	Clay	Could it be, then, that the rifle [MASK] saw had been hidden in the wagon without her or her husband knowing it? He was in the habit, by what they had let out, of gambling away things that didn’t belong to him.
