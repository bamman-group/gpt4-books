<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Stanley	But his foot had barely touched the stairs when [MASK] slipped out of the living-room and caught his arm in an eager grasp. “I’ve been waiting for you,” she whispered. “I’ve been waiting for hours.” “Not for hours.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Roy	“Maybe so and maybe not. Anyway, that sports car isn’t of much use shut up in my garage. I offered it to [MASK], but she wouldn’t touch it, and I can’t say I blame her.
<name>Septimus</name>	Septimus	Peter	[MASK], who, being dead, had seemed to come closer, must be thrust out of her mind . . . Only by refusing to let him enter, could she save herself. Only by speaking of him as of a person who had gone away a long time ago.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Stanley	She asked me to take them back for her.” A minute before, he might have said that nothing [MASK] could do or not do would ever astonish him. Yet so practical and provident an idea was the last thing that he would have expected.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Parry	“When,” he asked, “did you first hear of . . . of . . .” “Not till the policemen came. They came to take [MASK]. He was setting right here listening in on the radio.
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Stanley	Or was it only the hideous white shades which made the electricity as searching as sunlight? Every one appeared ghastly, except [MASK], who bloomed with excitement or happiness. But something was wrong; the thought tugged at his heart. Voices were too high.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Lavinia	“You may have many years ahead in which to think over things.” “Well, I’ve made up my mind. Anyway, I’ve made up my mind about [MASK].” “It will mean a great deal to her and the children.
<name>Job</name>	Job	Job	Poor as [MASK]’s turkey, but his folks came over in 1619, and one of them was the younger son of an earl. Not that bragging about blood cuts any ice with me. I was never one to trade on your ancestors, good or bad.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Craig	“But [MASK] said the best things. He’s fine when he begins to speak.” “About what?” “Oh, about everything. About the housing problem and the way people are made to live and the right to happi- ness . .
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stanley	It was late when she left [MASK] sleeping and went upstairs, to find her father waiting for her in her room. How much older he looked! We are killing him among us, she thought; we are draining every drop of his blood.
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Craig	“But it isn’t real, [MASK],” she said presently. “You want it, and so do I, but it isn’t real. You’re trying again to retreat from life as it is.” “We could make it real.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Asa	“Can you make him say anything?” [MASK] asked. “WLat do you want him to say?” “Anything. He must have some idea.” “If he has, he’s not talking. He doesn’t believe in us.”
<name>John</name>	John	Roy	Her tone, when she spoke, was solemn and reverential, but she added presently, unaware that she was think- ing aloud: “I wish your father had had a new suit, [MASK]. That old one is so shabby.”
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Stanley	I only wish I could have done more.” “You couldn’t have done more. I’ll leave my address with you.” As he held out his card, he remembered grotesquely that [MASK] had given him these cards, at Christmas, a few years before.
<name>Prue</name>	Prue	Stanley	She didn’t know; she didn’t care; but only words, she felt, could prevent the moment from crashing into disaster. [MASK]’s small, weak fingers clung to her stronger hand. “I couldn’t help it. I could never help anything.
<name>She</name>	She	Lavinia	I’d better brush up before dinner.” Going over to the table, he measured a dose of some new medicine into a glass and, after adding a little water, handed it to her. [MASK] swallowed the medicine promptly, though the taste was unpleasant.
<name>John</name>	John	Peter	One object, he noticed, he had overlooked, a bag of tobacco from which [MASK] had recently filled his pipe. But, even while he hoped that she would not see it, she picked it up indifferently and tossed it into the waste-paper basket.
<name>Justine</name>	Justine	Roy	Resentments must fade and pass, or there could be no enduring peace among human beings. The old order had gone out, with its severe standards and long retributions. He glanced at [MASK]’s pitying expression, and reflected gratefully that her new happiness was already a protective barrier between her and neglect or injustice.
<name>John</name>	John	William	“Do you hear what she says?” “She is thinking about you.” “She’s got some sense, but no business sense,” [MASK] said. “Did you ever know a woman who had a grain of sense about business?”
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Stanley	She was laughing happily. “You haven’t a beggar’s chance of ever seeing a penny of it.” “That’s right with me. [MASK] has worked hard for it, and I only hope she may live long enough to enjoy it.”
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Peter	We have everything we need.” That was true, she assented. They had everything but the one thing that she and [MASK] had found and lost. And that one thing alone made the whole world of difference. “No, it isn’t real.”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Roy	“But we were young when we made it. Don’t the young always make a mess of the world? Only our children seem to be different from us. They won’t even wait to do things over. They are always running away from life.” “Not [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Stanley	“No, I came in a little early, but I’ve had a bath and a change.” “Have you seen [MASK]?” “Not since this morning.” “Did she seem all right then?” “All right?”
<name>He</name>	He	Craig	You know we can’t do it. . . .” [MASK] nodded, with the dazed look of a man who has just awakened from sleep. “I wonder,” he said, and continued in a firmer tone. “Can she stand anything more?”
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Parry	Then, swiftly reversing the order, an old woman clutching a bundle, a boy dragging a small red wagon, a man fumbling in his pockets for cigarettes, a girl fidgeting with the uncurled bob on her neck. “I must see [MASK],” he heard his voice saying.
<name>she</name>	she	Parry	“Was he rough with the rest of you?” “No, sir, he wan’t rough. He never laid his hand on us, but he looked mean. I didn’t like the set of his mouth.” “Was [MASK] frightened?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Minerva	“All she needs to make her go is some better bowels,” he had said. He was a great one for poking fun at you. They were having a party in that big house on the corner. [MASK] loved a party, no matter who gave it.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Asa	They were kind to him, [MASK] knew; they were trying to make him feel that they wanted his company, that he was not in their way. Yet he knew also that, in spite of the struggling youth in his heart, he could not speak to them in their own tongue.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Asa	[MASK] looked at him with expressionless eyes. “You chose your job, and I didn’t. A man never knows . . .” “That’s right. A man never knows; and it’s a good thing he doesn't. . . .
<name>Lawrence</name>	Lawrence	Peter	The man’s head was still turned away, and all she could see, when she glanced at him, was the muffled contour of a young face. Why was it that she could still be reminded of [MASK]?
<name>Abner</name>	Abner	Abel	He liked to get in a time or two in his garden before he went to work, and after he came home from the post office, in the eveling—no, evening. He certny did carry his years well, did [MASK].
<name>Prue</name>	Prue	Charlotte	Married for more than fifty years! and she might as well have been a casual woman who had nudged down into the seat beside him, while they rattled, over a rough road, in an omnibus. He had understood [MASK], of course.
<name>Yasuo</name>	Yasuo	Peter	“I want to forget. Is it wrong to want to forget?” “It’s only natural. Why should you force yourself to be wretched?” “It wasn’t my fault. Even if I killed [MASK], it wasn’t my fault.”
<name>Rousseau</name>	Rousseau	Craig	Every human being, parent or child, must save himself by his own strength if he is to be saved. ... Or was [MASK] nearer the truth when he insisted that a human being cannot stand alone, and that humanity must rise or sink, not in parts, but as a whole?
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Peter	And [MASK] likes going about. He says he needs distraction, after the hospital.” “Why don’t you stop work and let him look after you?” Her eager face hardened, and it seemed to him that she had grown older while he watched her.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Roy	But I have a right to my own one life, he thought. A quivering wire seemed to snap apart. I have as much right as anybody to a life of my own. ... It was at this moment that he saw the gate slowly open, and [MASK] came in from the alley.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Roy	Then the quiver passed; the response faded. Is it real? she asked herself. Whether it is real or not, it is better than loneliness. “You mean a lot to me, [MASK],” he said. “You know that.”
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	William	“[MASK] will know what to do,” she said. “Tell him to make some excuse for the newspapers. The wedding was to have been in four—no, three days. Everybody . . . everybody . .
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Roy	Snow was still falling; the trees and houses were mantled; but now and then the glimmer of a passing car, like the frozen wings of a giant moth, flitted under the pallid boughs. “I hope it won’t last,” [MASK] said, glancing out of the window.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Virgie	“I’ll let him in. You needn’t bother, [MASK].” When he opened the door a wet wind stung his face. Snow was falling again, thick and fast, and the blown white drifts made the whole street look as if it were running away.
<name>He</name>	He	Asa	His eyes were liquid with joy, and his expression had softened from its glazed immobility. Out of the complete dissolution of the past year, the broken promises, the wrecked hopes, [MASK] felt that something solid and constructive, however small, was taking shape in the present and moving on into the future.
<name>Auntie</name>	Auntie	Granny	But she believed in good eating, the way all her white folks had believed in the olden time. “None of these here wishy-washy po-folksy victuals for me,” [MASK] used to say, as far back as she could make out to remember.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Lavinia	Bending over reluctantly, for she was no longer young, he brushed [MASK]’s flabby cheek with his moustache. “All right, then, I’ll see what I can do about it, and I’ll let you know.”
<name>Archer</name>	Archer	Craig	The pause was so long that he was on the point of repeating the question, when, without glancing round, while they raced toward the hill ahead, [MASK] answered in a tone of suppressed violence, “I don’t know.
<name>Myra</name>	Myra	Stanley	“Holding tight to her bunch of pinks, and smashed beyond recognition.” A high, thin scream, as frantic as the scream of a tor- tured animal, burst from [MASK]’s lips and tore on, writhing into the discordant sounds of the night.
<name>Leslie</name>	Leslie	Lavinia	“She’ll let you know quick enough when she wants them. And somebody is looking after her. You may count upon that.” “I can’t stop loving her just because she’s weak—or—or even bad,” [MASK] sobbed.
<name>John</name>	John	Asa	“I’m not so sure, sir,” he replied. “I’m not counting on that.” Well, he had done the best he could, [MASK] told himself. The pity was that a man’s best is so often inadequate.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Craig	While he slouched there, plunged in gloom, it seemed to the older man that he could hear the savage drumming of terror. But when, at last, [MASK] spoke, his voice had dwindled into a single thin jarring sound. “Then the car was stolen.
<name>Wansley</name>	Wansley	William	A crafty humor flickered in [MASK]’s glance. “I’ve got a few matters to straighten out,” he resumed, as if his wife had not spoken. “I was always so busy forging ahead that I never stopped to bother about what would come after me.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Lavinia	[MASK] yearned toward her. “Not that we can always see, darling.” “Have I been asleep a long time?” “It will do you good. Try not to talk.” • “I feel as if I’d been away—somewhere very far off.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	William	But I loved them, he told himself, and I did the best that I could. Yet his best was not enough to ward off the lightest blow of adversity. “That is the right way to look at this—this tragedy, my dear,” [MASK] was saying.
<name>Smiling</name>	Smiling	Smiling	You’re tired?” “Yes, I’m tired.” When she tried to smile, the muscles of her face ached with the strain, and she thought bleakly, [MASK] used to be easy. “I’m sorry. I ought to have known better.”
<name>the tea</name>	the tea	Craig	Her tone had altered now; the happier moment had gone by. He thought of her eyes, eloquent with laughter, when she came in with [MASK]. Then, as she started to move away and glanced back at him, he saw that the light had died.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Asa	Huddled in his clothes, his long, loose figure seemed to have shrunk and dwindled down to the bony structure. “Then we’ll go downstairs.” [MASK] caught his arm at the elbow and drew him away. “There’s nothing we can do.
<name>Mother</name>	Mother	Martha	“Will you come in for a drink?” she asked. “Or shall we have our walk?” “Let’s have the walk first. I want to go down through the fields to the river edge.” “In a minute. I’ll tell [MASK].”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Roy	So, without lifting her head, she murmured softly, “Won’t you wait just a minute, dear?” Reluctantly, with a step that dragged slowly, [MASK] came into the room, while her mother sank deeper and flatter among the pillows.
<name>Miranda</name>	Miranda	Peter	but every way, even that strange bloody road, would lead back in memory to what had been happiness—to what had been [MASK]. . . . When she came down to breakfast, her father had just finished his Sunday morning cereal with cream.
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Abel	April was closing in. You felt a touch of summer in the hot sunshine. The wistaria on the fence and the big snowball bush in the corner were in full bloom, and [MASK]’s particular pride, the Scarlet Beauty tulips, were flaunting their brilliant heads.
<name>George</name>	George	Asa	why? why? Of course, I am, [MASK]. Every one is except you. And now you . . .” “Well, lie down, and I’ll put on the coffee” He couldn’t hurt her, that was his weakness.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Craig	Wouldn’t [MASK] have gone if it had lasted?” “So he says.” “Anyhow, he wanted to go. Didn’t he say that a battle for civilization was coming, and he wanted to be on the right side?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	William	“Remember all your Uncle [MASK] has done for you.” “How does that help me now? If he has stopped . . . what good does that do me now?” “He’s not well. When he gets back his health, he may see differently.”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Craig	“She hadn’t been there. They don’t know anything.” [MASK] did not answer. His face seemed to be moulded of hollows, dark hollows among which the shifting lights from the road sank and were absorbed.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Stanley	After this, [MASK] dropped into stillness, moaning now and then in her sleep, as a child moans in a bad dream. The only light was a pearly glimmer which drifted in from the street, and was shattered at intervals by the flashing lamps of a car.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Craig	he demanded harshly. “You see how it is?” As if the moment in which he stood were cut sharply in two, [MASK] jerked upright and threw a wavering glance round the room. “What was that? Did you speak to me?”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Craig	[MASK] nodded gloomily. “I wonder how many people are disappointed?” “More than you’d think . . . Mass murder is a popular sport.” “I’d think a good many. That war would have come at the right moment for me.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Asa	This is happiness. . . . /lS [MASK] went up the steps and drew out his latch-% key, a clock somewhere in the city struck ten / % slow strokes, which seemed to sink into the -JL jL night and leave a pool of silence behind them.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Stanley	“Do sisters ever really hate each other?” “I didn’t want to hurt you.” “Don’t, [MASK], don’t. It is over now. We have to live as we can . . .” What did she mean?
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Asa	“If your stomach’s as empty as mine, it won’t stand it.” “I could do with another drink.” [MASK] withdrew the bottle. “You can’t get into a car with all that whisky inside you.” “I don’t care.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Asa	He stood for a minute silently fingering the cap in his hand. “I’d give most anything to get away. If it wasn’t for my folks at home, I’d give most anything.” [MASK] sighed. “That feeling is in the air.
<name>John</name>	John	William	[MASK] turned from the financial to the editorial page, and prepared to inform himself on the state of human behavior. “Well, there’s plenty to worry her. All she’s got to do is to pick up a newspaper and glance over the market.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Craig	“Come to breakfast, [MASK],” she called. “We’ve a long day ahead of us, and it’s going to be a happy day.” “And we haven’t an idea where we’re going.”
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Andrew	“That’s the right idea,” [MASK] assented. “If she can have a good sleep, she’ll feel better in the morning. Then we’ll all get together and see what we can do about it.” “Do about what?”
<name>Everybody</name>	Everybody	Aspiration	Some light-colored wench across the street would swing her hips; then a man and his woman would marry on nothing, and begin in poverty to breed like jack rabbits. [MASK] would be subdued in the end to the elementary law of biology.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Roy	[MASK] was already in the dining-room mixing his highball; and he stifled the groan on his lips as he limped slowly into the kitchen and then down the dim steps to the furnace room. The cellar smelt stuffy and musty and curiously depressing.
<name>he</name>	he	Stanley	If only his mind would stay empty till morning, when the spectres of imagination would be swallowed up in the horrors of the actuality. How could [MASK] make her life over again? How could any life be made over? Perhaps he ought not to have come.
<name>Griffith</name>	Griffith	Craig	[MASK] was late; there were matters to arrange at the factory; and it was past noon before the two men entered the jail and followed a deputy sheriff, through corridors reeking with disinfectant, to the double block of cells, at the far end, where the Negroes were kept.
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Roy	The mere mention of [MASK]’s name, she said to herself, appeared to touch some secret spring in his nature. “She doesn’t want any help. She told me that she had to save herself in her own way.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	William	I’ve lived in dread for years, and I never had a pain in my breast that I didn’t think of the way my mother had gone. But the doctor says now that the stabbing pain is only chronic indigestion . . . and poor [MASK] . . .”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Asa	Farther away, a light mulatto was thumbing a small picture-book. The noise was deafening; the light dim. Still sickened by the stench, [MASK] said, “We must get him out of here.” Then he met the boy’s eyes, and something seemed to shrivel inside him.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Lavinia	Are they really stronger than I am, every one of them, even [MASK]? The old sense of failure, of inferiority, was like an odd tingling weakness in his elbows and knees. But I’m right, he persisted.
<name>John</name>	John	Asa	It seemed so pathetic,” she added with a sob, “that I almost cried.” Then, as [MASK] could still find nothing to say, she continued in a low, panting voice: “I can’t help thinking, all the time, that it ought to have been me.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Minerva	“I’m kind of stiff in my joints, and I’m going to lock up and try to get a good sleep.” “Don’t you bother to lock up,” [MASK] said. “I want to look out of doors just a minute.”
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Peter	But I told [MASK] this, and it made him perfectly furious. He pretended I was trying to get rid of him. After all I have given up for him, he seems to blame me for everything. Yet he will not hear of my leav- ing him.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	William	Then, when she found out I wasn’t the easy game that I used to be, I reckon she sent you up here to see what you could make of me . . .” “Why, [MASK]!”
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Parry	Her husband turned his frosty glance on her and continued as evenly as if there had been no interruption, “I am glad to have a good report of you, [MASK], but I hope you won’t let your head get chock-full of tomfool ideas about education.
<name>Why</name>	Why	WTiy	Why was life a perpetual discord when, with far less effort and less nervous waste, it might become a serene harmony? [MASK], in spite of every opportunity to possess and to enjoy the world, did human nature persist in acting like human nature?
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Parry	“Don’t forget that you are going to be a first-rate lawyer some day.” [MASK] avoided his gaze. “I’m not so sure, sir,” he replied. “I’m not counting on that.”
<name>George</name>	George	Peter	“You may laugh as much as you like, but I’m serious. I don’t like the way you’re looking, and I’m going to speak to [MASK] about it.” “Oh, you mustn’t.” Fear ruffled her voice.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Craig	She had fought and won; and she knew that it was not her own strength alone, it was partly [MASK], who had saved her. What she had felt, with a single flash of penetration, on that August afternoon, was a fundamental truth of emotion.
<name>Yogi</name>	Yogi	Andrew	He can see the color in the sky, and he knows that the change from baseball to football isn’t the only way to tell when it is autumn. Some men don’t know any more than that about seasons. There’s [MASK] . . .”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Craig	“Why not go with us to a movie? You may choose one you like.” “Yes, come with us.” [MASK] glanced round with friendly unconcern. “It might make you sleep better.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	William	“We didn’t give him a drink, [MASK],” she said. “And I never saw a man who needed a drink more.” WAS he tired of waiting? Has he gone back without me?
<name>Clayton</name>	Clayton	Asa	No, wealth could not buy happiness, but it could make unhappiness more comfortable; and even a broken heart, [MASK] reasoned, cannot afford to despise comfort. Freedom, too, it could buy, he thought resentfully, freedom to cast back favors and reject obligations.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Stanley	“Have patience, darling. Just try to have patience.” “If there is one virtue I despise,” [MASK] retorted furiously, “it is patience.” “What do you want to do?” “I want to go away.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Stanley	Does she hate him because he had once loved her too much or because he now loved her no longer? “Oh, not to a movie!” [MASK] exclaimed. “You have to keep still at a movie, and I’d rather do anything than keep still.”
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Stanley	[MASK] gasped, twisting lightly out of his moist embrace. “That cheque was too marvellous.” “Liked it, did you? Well, I reckon it won’t be lasting you long.” She tossed her charming head.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	William	Her deep unseeing eyes were fixed on [MASK], and her lips were so dry and hard that she moistened them before she was able to speak the thought in her mind. “Where did he—where did it happen?” “In the apartment.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Stanley	“If you could see [MASK], you would be obliged to forgive her,” she said, and he replied quickly: “I’ve not only forgiven her. I am very grateful to her for letting me have you. But I don’t want to see her.”
<name>you</name>	you	Peter	It’s just that I’m sick of the noise and the fuss and the—oh, and the . . .” “You’ve been doing too much. But as long as you’re happy . . “As long as I have [MASK].”
<name>Wilmot</name>	Wilmot	William	“I’m sure that it’s all on the surface.” “Well, I’d never choose a hard surface on a woman,” [MASK] chuckled under his breath, and then a dash of his jocose humor enlivened his tone.
