<name>editor</name>	editor	Folu	Me, me. I’ll try: “Dangerous escaped lunatic and rapist on the loose. Beware.” —Too long. Too repetitive. And where’s the aesthetic, where’s the wit? By the way, [MASK], this is a real story.
<name>Lenina</name>	Lenina	James	I’m only twenty-five. —Call me [MASK]. Well, a lot of you chaps do marry rather early, isn’t that so? A few of the workers I know, very young, but they always talk about their families. Children and all.
<name>He</name>	He	Zaq	People bought papers for news only, facts, or at least that was how the editor saw it. But [MASK] wasn’t the kind of person to sit around waiting for things to change. He quit, just like that. Even I was taken by surprise.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Zaq	We climbed the shaky ladder, placing each foot carefully, ready to grab at whatever was nearby to save ourselves if the rungs gave out from under us. I went first and then dragged [MASK] after me, his weight like a sack of sand.
<name>him</name>	him	James	I trusted him, and see what he did to me. Why? I want to know why, can you please tell me? —And, suddenly, I didn’t feel like seeing [MASK] again. I didn’t want to go home; I couldn’t.
<name>me</name>	me	Zaq	—Well, on and off for about twelve days now. He had taken blood and urine samples and said he’d work on them and let us know what was wrong by tomorrow. And then he had knocked [MASK] out with the injection.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Zaq	[MASK] was lying on a mat under an acacia tree, and though the air was hot and humid, he was covered up to his chin in a brown wool blanket. He attempted a smile when he saw me, but the smile was soon overtaken by a grimace.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Rufus	He listens, nodding his head, and all the time he stares at her, trying to catch her eye, but she avoids his eyes as she speaks. And she calls to me, [MASK], come here. Why do you stand so far away by the window?
<name>Father</name>	Father	Naman	[MASK], in the middle, was tall and upright; the others were shorter, stooped, and older. One was thin and bald and mustached, and the other was portly, with a fine head of hair. —These are my fellow priests, and together we represent the entire community.
<name>he</name>	he	Gloria	She had joined the worshippers, walking with them in a procession every morning and every evening to immerse herself in the sea and sing a hymn to the rising and the setting of the sun. And since [MASK] had returned, the two had been inseparable.
<name>Sister Aloysius</name>	Sister Aloysius	...	I’ve been attending to your friend. I saw you come up this way. I pointed at her clothes. —You’re not worshipping with them today? —I’m not a worshipper. I’m just the nurse. —Well, I see [MASK]
<name>Lord Vetinari</name>	Lord Vetinari	Naman	And later, when I voiced my lament to [MASK]—Look, they broke the statues—he smiled sadly and nodded and said, Everything that was made must one day cease to be. It is the nature of existence.
<name>Doctor</name>	Doctor	Rufus	After that greedy, focused exertion, he kicked off the blanket and released a long, blissful sigh. \ —Ahhh! You’ve just saved a life, [MASK]. —Has the nurse been to see you? —Yes. She was quite nice to me.
<name>he</name>	he	Zaq	I ate the hard dry bread and sipped the cold tea, but [MASK] didn’t even look at the bread, and the tea he downed in a single gulp, more from thirst than from an enjoyment of the bitter, inky taste.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Isabel	[MASK] took it—it was a blouse—and put it beside her on the mat. She smiled up at the girl, who smiled back and skipped out of the tent. I waited for her to resume where she’d stopped, and as I waited my nervousness returned.
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Salomon	When I woke up the next morning a man was kneeling over me, nudging me with his gun. I sat up quickly and the man stood up and moved back. The others were awake, except [MASK], who wasn’t anywhere to be seen.
<name>Lolita</name>	Lolita	Anita	He became an adviser to the information minister, a tough guy with many enemies in the cabinet. —Well, it was at this point that [MASK] miraculously reentered his life. Only this was not the same awkward young girl he had written about in his famous “Five Women” article.
<name>brother</name>	brother	Rufus	Eating and watching mindlessly till they fell asleep. Those without TV, or those who simply couldn’t bear the steaming heat in their rooms, would come out and sit on the veranda to catch whatever breeze was passing by. —Hey, [MASK], my countryman!
<name>the boy</name>	the boy	Zaq	We spent the night by the water, fighting off insects, unable to fall asleep till early morning, when the bright sun chased away the insects. When I opened my eyes the old man was talking to [MASK]. They were standing near the water’s edge.
<name>they</name>	they	James	—I guess I did. I had known him for over six months by then, and... it was a good motel, really. It was quite clean, but, most important, it was the last place [MASK] would come looking for me. —
<name>him</name>	him	Michael	The cry came from the old man as the men approached our boat; he threw himself at them as they began to drag [MASK] out of the boat, his puny arms rising and falling ineffectually against the men’s burly frames, but still he fought them, his rage churning up the water.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Zaq	The soldiers led us to the lockup when the sun was setting over the land. They walked behind us, their guns raised and aimed at a point between my shoulder blades; [MASK] was walking slightly ahead of me on the narrow path leading to the little hut.
<name>Clark</name>	Clark	Listen	—Once, he was the best. —Yes, I know. He used— —No. You don’t know anything. [MASK]. Did he tell you we were rookies together at the Daily Times? Oh, he didn’t?
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Rufus	—[MASK], I’m telling you all this just to put everything into perspective. I know you must have risked a lot to be here, so you deserve to know everything. Perhaps my husband has told you some of it already, but it doesn’t matter.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Zaq	Her nails were cut short, clean, her makeup was moderate, adequate. She was like a college girl. She seemed lost in that place, out of her element. Yes, I said to her. [MASK] told me.
<name>Moira</name>	Moira	Boma	—I’ll be fine, and so will your sister. The worst is over, I think. [MASK] was with the group of women at the hearth. I could see her red blouse standing out in the cluster of white robes around her.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Mary	[MASK], who wanted so badly to get married. She had made all the plans, and at night she’d go over them with me in the little room we shared not far from the campus. It was a tenement house, a face-me-I-face-you.
<name>The Doctor</name>	The Doctor	Major	—Well, [MASK], what is true? —The Doctor can tell you about the deserted villages around here. They used to be well populated, you know, thriving. Now the people have all packed their things and left, because of the violence.
<name>Tenzin</name>	Tenzin	Naman	I let her words sink in, not interrupting. When she came back she found the military pulling out, and the villagers, led by [MASK], who was now the head priest, engaged in rebuilding the shrine and the huts and salvaging anything that they could.
<name>the girl's</name>	the girl's	Zaq	If you can’t swim, take the rope being lowered and we’ll pull you over. Don’t take anything from your boat. I went first, plunging into the cold water and grasping blindly for the rope; then the old man, then the boy, and then it was [MASK]’s turn.
<name>Mr. Bungle</name>	Mr. Bungle	Zaq	His rumpled suit and tie, the wolfish smile on his fat face, added to [MASK]’s headache and he felt like reaching out and covering the smile with his hand. The other visitor remained standing, looking out through the open window, as if to avoid a bad smell in the narrow room.
<name>the priestess</name>	the priestess	Zaq	Over there was the seat where she had entertained me with a bowl of jollof rice. At the thought of food my stomach rumbled, my knees felt weak and I knew that I might have to return to the shrine and admit to [MASK] that I had failed.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Gloria	Now, see, everything is in ruins. Nothing left, it is a miracle so many are still alive. A miracle. He kept repeating it: a miracle. —And [MASK], where is she? —They took her away like they promised.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Zaq	—Nonsense. —What? I thought I was doing so well, and for a moment I was telling myself that even [MASK] would be proud of my persuasiveness, but obviously the driver wasn’t persuaded. —These people, they no care.
<name>Tanaka</name>	Tanaka	Nkem	—We have been expecting you. He spoke in English, his words slow and distinct, and he looked from face to face as he spoke. [MASK] stood boldly, almost challengingly, before the man, his arms akimbo. —You were expecting us? —
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Zaq	—Why don’t you find out, since you’re a reporter? I crawled back to where [MASK] lay and sprawled out beside him. I didn’t feel as if I had gained much information. I still hadn’t found out anything new about the woman.
<name>him</name>	him	Zaq	That’s why I wanted [MASK] to go in there and find out. And now you say he’s not well. What’s wrong with him? Is it serious? —He needs rest. The air out there is good for him.
<name>Walter Lippmann</name>	Walter Lippmann	Zaq	The truth was that I had no plans, no job waiting for me. My ultimate ambition was of course to become like [MASK] someday: to be respected all over the country for my strong liberal views, and to write editorials that would be read with awe.
<name>her</name>	her	Zaq	She gave up. She held me tight, till I couldn’t breathe, sobbing, I don’t have a family anymore, you are all I have. Promise me you’ll be with me always. But I didn’t tell [MASK] any of this.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Zaq	—Tell [MASK] he has my permission to negotiate with the kidnappers. My embassy has warned me against paying ransom just yet, but there’s no reason why we can’t start negotiating. I just want to end this whole thing as quickly as possible.
<name>him</name>	him	Zaq	You could get killed. —I see it as a great opportunity to show what I can do, sir. I didn’t tell them that, though I wasn’t sure exactly what to look for, I was confident that with [MASK] there everything would work out fine.
<name>Irikefe</name>	Irikefe	Zaq	May I ask you to find out for me? —How? —Go back to this Irikefe place, talk to [MASK], see what he says. I’m willing to pay him, and you, of course, for your trouble.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Zaq	I spread [MASK] out on the sand where the water would not reach us and, laying side by side, we immediately fell asleep. In the morning he woke me up and pointed eastward to the huge red sun emerging out of the blue water. —Beautiful.
<name>Siddhartha</name>	Siddhartha	Zaq	And I found her very attractive. —Yes, of course. I’ll see how he’s doing before he turns in. We found [MASK] seated on his mat, facing a fire in a brazier that had been placed near his feet.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Zaq	Five of them are coming this way, guns firmly clasped in both hands, trotting, and here they are. Footsteps came to a stop in front of the hut, and [MASK] and I waited to see what was going to happen.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Salomon	He kept licking his dry lips as he waited for me to speak, and I saw his hand shaking slightly. He kept darting glances at the guards, who were now watching us intently. —Hi, [MASK]. —Hello. —We need to talk .. .
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Zaq	[MASK] allowed me to lead him back into the hut, still grumbling about ghosts. The shrine, as this section of the island was called, occupied the entire waterfront, with the hillock and the sculpture garden intervening between the huts and the water.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Simon	—So, does that make her more important than if she were, say, Nepalese, or Guyanese, or Greek? The man made to open his mouth, but the husband spoke first. —[MASK], old chap, let me handle this.
<name>he</name>	he	Zaq	She went back to school and actually graduated. And I think it was to forget her that [MASK] threw himself into the pro-democracy movement when the military dictators returned in the late eighties. He wrote fiery, fearless anti-military pieces that even our editor was hesitant to publish.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Zaq	—You’re not going home, are you? The day’s still young. Who’s going to write the editorial, the Metro column, the book review? [MASK] brushed past him. —Why don’t you write them yourself, just for a change?
<name>Abigail</name>	Abigail	Naman	They talked only to [MASK]. They left not long before you first arrived. —I don’t know what your plans are, but her death could mean big trouble for the community. As soon as we report it, the police and army will be here.
<name>Ali</name>	Ali	Joseph	Without thinking I stood up and made for the narrow path. The guards, surprised, didn’t react till I had gone a few meters, then [MASK] ran to me and held me by the hand, the wide smile still on his face.
<name>Lolita</name>	Lolita	Star	What can she get you? —A beer will do ... [MASK]. —And a refill for me. She turned and disappeared into the kitchen. I watched the movement of her full waist beneath the close-fitting uniform.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Zaq	But I understood [MASK]’s anger, because I felt it too. But mine wasn’t directed at the old man; rather, it came from a feeling of frustration and general irritability at the way things had been going since we started on the trail of the kidnapped woman.
<name>Major</name>	Major	Zaq	His men raised their rifles nervously and the uproar died out as quickly as it had started. The Major lowered his rifle and turned his back on the crowd. —You are dismissed. —you can slip away quite easily if you want to. I looked at [MASK].
<name>him</name>	him	Zaq	—Look, dear chap, I’ll pay for your time. I know you’ll need to prepare, buy equipment and so on. How about a hundred thousand naira? All you have to do is go back to the island, give [MASK] my message, and come back.
<name>he</name>	he	Emmanuel	Well, [MASK] has proved himself to be a true friend. He’s the only one of my former colleagues whom I can still call a friend. He came up with this plan. We started the whole thing with his savings. It’s not a bad business, really.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Oya	Then, just before I turned to see what he found so arresting, I heard the command: —[MASK], move faster! The reporters were walking in a single file, their hands raised above their heads, and flanking them were figures in black wearing masks, their guns pointed at the men.
<name>The speaker</name>	The speaker	Henshaw	Who is she in the context of the war that’s going on out there, the hopes and ambitions being created and destroyed? Can’t you see the larger picture? [MASK] sounded educated and very confident, so perhaps the best way to make progress was to appeal to his reason.
<name>the Filipinos</name>	the Filipinos	Nigerians	—I haven’t been here long, you know. This is my second year in the country and I’m still trying to understand the place and the people. I think [MASK] are very nice and hospitable. —You still think so, even after the kidnapping?
<name>The Nurse</name>	The Nurse	Gloria	Her name is [MASK]. Your men took her a few days ago . .. —Ah, the nurse. She is gone. We set her free two days ago. Did you think we’d keep her here against her wish, rape her, maybe?
<name>Private Witt</name>	Private Witt	Zaq	When I trifed to explain to a sergeant that [MASK] was not feeling well, he raised his gun at me. —Keep walking. At last we arrived at a camp: a few sheds and huts arranged in a square formation around a central clearing where three low and leafy trees grew.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Zaq	—I was just coming from your hut. She looked beautiful, her smile cheerful. —Did you meet [MASK]? —Yes. He was quite chatty today. I think he’s recovering very well. Just keep him away from the bottle.
<name>John</name>	John	Salomon	He bashed him on the head with a stone, and we slipped away. I guess they weren’t expecting us to try something so crazy. —Yes, [MASK], why did he help you escape? He kidnapped you in the first place, didn’t he?
<name>the old man</name>	the old man	Zaq	They were just the old man and his son, guiding us in these waters that they depended upon for their livelihood, daily throwing in a line and hoping, always hoping, that something would bite. I felt ashamed. The look on [MASK]’s face mirrored mine.
<name>my editor</name>	my editor	Beke	Of course, he could stay with [MASK], my editor. But the man is a mean bastard and will only treat him as a servant. Don’t you have any family? —I have a sister, but she— —Can’t she take him?
<name>She</name>	She	Salomon	She grew more nervous, her face grew red and blotchy with insect bites and her clothes were all tom and dirty—they gave her a military jacket to put on when she washed her things. She cried more and more often, and more and more time went by, and at last [MASK] gave in.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Zaq	[MASK] had fallen asleep while I was talking, his whiskey bottle, now three-quarters empty, clutched tightly in his hand. I went out and walked up the hillock, and suddenly I was facing the water over the top of the scanty trees.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Boma	[MASK] was waiting for me at the edge of the sculpture garden. She was wearing the long white robe. I stopped and pointed at the robe. She looked well. There was a smile on her face. —Well, you look healthy, happy.
<name>God</name>	God	Zaq	—But he’s innocent. Isn’t he innocent? My question to [MASK], even I knew, was futile: how was he to know who was innocent and who wasn't, after all; hadn’t we both just met the man for the first time today?
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Gloria	—[MASK]. —Ask her what she knows about the Englishwoman. —What if she doesn’t want to talk? —Didn’t I tell you she likes you? Hold her hand. Kiss her. Just get her to talk. It’s very important.
<name>She</name>	She	Salomon	Good. I’ll have a whiskey. He led her into a deserted bar, and they sat in a dark comer. The bartender glanced briefly at them and returned to reading his magazine. [MASK] went to the bar and returned with her drink. —Thanks.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	ZAQ	—They took her away like they promised. She was crying and screaming, but they dragged her away. I WENT OVER TO [MASK]. —A lady was here just now, looking for you. She said she was your sister. Do you have a sister?
<name>He</name>	He	Zaq	What are you talking about? Who said we were at the burial ground last night? [MASK] tried to outstare the unblinking priests, but there was neither power nor conviction in his eyes and voice. I said nothing.
<name>figure</name>	figure	Zaq	I knelt beside the boatman, who was trying to communicate with the bowed [MASK]. As I touched his arm, which was hot and dripping with sweat, he looked up at me, licking his dry lips. —If I can get a drink, I’ll be fine.
<name>John</name>	John	Gloria	He said he and his men would spend the night here and tomorrow they’d be on their way, but before they left they’d take a hostage, just to make sure of the worshippers’ cooperation. And then he pointed at [MASK], and said, You will come with us tomorrow.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Salomon	[MASK] still sat away from me, his head bowed. At last I stood up and faced the guards, and one immediately stepped toward me, his gun raised. —I need to stretch my legs. I have cramps. I went over and stood next to him.
<name>Clark</name>	Clark	Green	Ah, I can see us now. [MASK], wet behind the ears. Of course, there was nothing like journalism school then, you just finessed your way into things. I bet you went to a journalism school, didn’t you? They are useless.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Zaq	[MASK] was still lying on his back, his eyes staring at the roof, when I returned. —We can’t get away. There are no boats coming or going, and the whole village is staying home. Nothing is happening. —You should rest.
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Isabel	I thought of [MASK] out there in the forest, waiting. She might not have long to wait. This could all be over by tomorrow, and then a period of mental healing would begin for her, but by then she would be somewhere far away, among her people.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Zaq	He turned when he heard the truck approaching. —Ah, here’s your transportation to the ferry. I turned to [MASK], who was seated with his back against the tree; his head was bowed, and his eyes when he raised them looked dull.
<name>The reporter</name>	The reporter	Nkem	No one was responding on the other end. —I am here now, I need a contact. Over! —What’s going on? [MASK], the reporter from the Globe, stood up and went closer to the guide, shouting his question into the wind and water spray.
<name>Sal</name>	Sal	Gloria	What I needed, I realized, was an ally in the enemy camp, someone who could tell me how serious the elders were about detaining us here, and how long the detention might last. [MASK]. the tenement house was not far from the waterfront.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Zaq	I wanted to ask the Doctor if he thought the fighting would end soon, who was right, who was wrong, if he knew where the Professor was, if he had heard about the kidnapped woman, but instead I turned and looked toward the shed where [MASK] lay, breathing away his life.
<name>John</name>	John	Zaq	And remember, make them understand that nothing must happen to her. She’s a British citizen— [MASK] interrupted him, not raising his gaze from the picture. —So, does that make her more important than if she were, say, Nepalese, or Guyanese, or Greek?
<name>He</name>	He	Zaq	In return I was paid a thousand naira a month, and was allowed to sleep in the office. That was how I became a journalist. [MASK] snored on. I wanted to ask him how he became a journalist. What inspired him.
<name>him</name>	him	James	But then she met someone else. It was nothing serious, nothing actually happened, but it got her thinking. —I realized how lonely I had been all this while. What we had, me and [MASK], couldn’t really be called a marriage.
<name>Kichijiro</name>	Kichijiro	Zaq	I was taken by surprise and quickly curled my fingers, trying to hide the telltale red earth that my hasty washing last night hadn’t removed from under the chipped nails. [MASK]’s stare wavered. He sighed. —Well... —Our head priest died this morning.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tekena	—They will. —How can you trust them? —Well, they didn’t shoot us. —I knew I shouldn’t have come on this assignment. —Remember what happened to [MASK] and the other one, what’s his name ...
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Zaq	—We’re prisoners, like you. The Major doesn’t believe we’re innocent journalists. —Well, are you? —What? —Innocent journalists? —Of course we are. I work for the Reporter, and [MASK] works for the Star. —
<name>John</name>	John	Zaq	We left the door and the single window open to trap whatever passing breeze we could, but despite the stifling heat in the room, [MASK], seated next to me, was shaking violently, his arms wrapped around him, trying to keep warm.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Zaq	[MASK]’s Lagos days ended almost five years ago, and in this business that was a whole generation. A generation of papers, his generation, had died out, its place taken by another generation, my generation.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Zaq	Not in my wildest dreams did I ever think our quest would end so suddenly, with an unmarked grave in a shrine. [MASK] said nothing more all day. He lay on his mat, facing the conical thatched roof, a second bottle in his hand.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Koko	She cooked and cleaned three days a week. —[MASK] is my fiancee. Yesterday she told me she was pregnant. He looked mournful, uncomfortable. He sat stiffly on the edge of his seat, and he avoided her eyes as he spoke.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Joseph	—Yes, funny. He nodded, smiling widely. —I really have to see the Professor. —No worry, you go see am. He dey busy right now. [MASK] continued to stare over my shoulder and to point the gun at me.
<name>The man</name>	The man	Zaq	[MASK] looked from the boy to me to the old man. —Look. Okay. We’ll take him. I will take him. I’ll find a way. —But.. . are you sure .. . ? —No, I’m not.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Gloria	Some of the houses had broken walls and roofs, with smoke still issuing from the rafters, yet some were surprisingly untouched. At [MASK]’s tenement I found the front door was kicked in, and it now lay beside the doorway, its zinc sheet twisted and torn.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Salomon	The men stayed in the living room all day, playing cards, and when night finally fell, [MASK] checked on her once more to make sure she was okay— there was a fridge in the bedroom, with water and fruit and bread in it—and then he left.
<name>Kevin</name>	Kevin	Jamabo	Well, I started to really think. This was the chance of a lifetime. And, like [MASK] said, it wasn’t a real kidnapping. So we all agreed. We were going to ask for one million dollars. Over three hundred thousand each.
<name>him</name>	him	Naman	I said nothing. I sensed a certain change in [MASK]: this wasn’t the same man I had talked to yesterday. He seemed more distant, sadder, and yet there was a determination, a coldness I had not noticed before in him.
