<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Allie	It is a trying disease, and this is why it is hard for their children and mine to visit. [MASK], of course, has her own problems, too, problems that will probably grow worse over time. She is terribly afraid in the mornings and cries inconsolably.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Noah	She shook her head, and [MASK] went to the kitchen and put the crabs in the steamer and the bread in the oven. He found some flour and corn-meal for the vegetables, coated them, and put some grease into the frying pan.
<name>Willem</name>	Willem	Allie	I know you can. You have a talent that comes from inside you, from your heart, not from your fingers. What you have can’t ever go away. It’s what other people only dream about. You’re an artist, [MASK].”
<name>James</name>	James	Lon	She reached for her cup, took another sip of tea, and listened as a woodpecker tapped in the distance. She spoke quietly. “[MASK]’s handsome, charming, and successful, and most of my friends are insanely jealous.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Noah	Why else wouldn’t you write? Or call? Or come see me?” [MASK] looked away without answering, and she continued: “I didn’t know, and in time, the hurt began to fade and it was easier to just let it go.
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Allie	[MASK] swallowed hard. “Did you tell him I was here?” “No. And I won’t. That’s between you and him. But knowing him. I’m sure he’ll find you here if you stay.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Noah	Glancing out the window, she saw the clouds were almost black. “Let me get the fire going again,” [MASK] said, needing to think, and she released him. He went to the fireplace, opened the screen, and added a couple of logs.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Anne	“No, I didn’t tell your father or anyone else about it. Nor did I tell anyone where I was going today.” The table was silent for a moment as they wondered what was coming next, but [MASK] remained quiet. “Why did you come?”
<name>He</name>	He	Noah	I’m glad you were the first. I’m glad we were able to share that.” “Me too.” “Were you as afraid as I was?” [MASK] nodded without speaking, and she smiled at his honesty. “I thought so.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Allie	I am surprised by this, and she says quietly, “It’s good to have you back. [MASK]’s missed you and so have the rest of us. We were all praying for you because it’s just not the same around here when you’re gone.”
<name>Amara</name>	Amara	Allie	The breeze had stopped, and the clouds grew blacker as the canoe moved toward some unknown destination. [MASK] noticed it all, every sound, every thought. Her senses had come alive, invigorating her, and she felt her mind drifting through the last few weeks.
<name>Ellie</name>	Ellie	Allie	I look around the room, then up to the ceiling, then back at [MASK], and the way she’s looking at me makes me warm. And suddenly I feel young again. I’m no longer cold or aching, or hunched over or deformed, or almost blind with cataractal eyes.
<name>the horse</name>	the horse	Clem	Together they fed [MASK] and checked the windows to make sure no damage had been done in the storm. Two pine trees had blown over, though neither had caused much damage, and a few shingles had blown off the shed, but other than that, the property had escaped pretty much unscathed.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Allie	Another bolt and the table beside me is lit enough to see a picture of [MASK], the best one I have. I had it framed years ago in the hope that the glass would make it last forever. I reach for it and hold it inches from my face.
<name>James</name>	James	Noah	By the time the candles have burned down a third, I am ready to break the silence. I say, “I love you deeply, and I hope you know that.” “Of course I do,” she says breathlessly. “I’ve always loved you, [MASK].”
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Noah	She made another turn and saw a young man unloading groceries from a truck that blocked part of the street. Something about the way he held himself, or the way he moved, reminded her of [MASK] harvesting crabs at the end of the dock.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Duke	And even now I read the passages and wonder who I was when I wrote them, for I cannot remember the events of my life. There are times I sit and wonder where it all has gone. “My name,” I say, “is [MASK].”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Allie	He stopped and gently took her shoulders in his hands, making her face him. The fading sunlight reflected in her eyes as he spoke. “If you’re happy, [MASK], and you love him, I won’t try to stop you from going back to him.
<name>the storm</name>	the storm	Lon	I told them about your mother warning us about [MASK] the next day—they seemed as surprised as we were—and yes, I even told them what happened later that day, after you went back to town. That part of the story has never left me, even after all this time.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Lon	When asked, she said her erratic behavior was due to stress. It was the perfect excuse; everyone understood, including [MASK], and that’s why he hadn’t argued when she’d wanted to get away for a couple of days. The wedding plans were stressful to everyone involved.
<name>Jake</name>	Jake	Noah	[MASK] paddled hard as dark clouds rolled directly overhead. Soon rain began to fall, a light sprinkle at first, then gradually harder. Lightning ... a pause . . . then thunder again. A little louder now. Maybe six or seven miles away.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Allie	[MASK] looked around, not seeing anything. “Where is it?” “Here,” he said again, pointing the canoe at an old tree that had fallen over, obscuring an opening almost completely hidden from view.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Allie	An occasional person found him arrogant; most simply figured he had grown up a bit faster than everyone else. He had a few girlfriends in school, but none had ever made an impression on him. Except for one. And she came after graduation. [MASK].
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Allie	He felt his loins begin to stir and quickly turned away, embarrassed, muttering to himself, glad the rain muffled any sound of it. When he finished and stood, [MASK] took his hand in hers, surprising him.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Allie	“No,” I say, shaking my head. He comes in and looks around the room before taking a seat a few feet from me. “I hear,” he says, “you had a good day with [MASK].” He smiles.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Allie	Starlings chirped in the trees around her. The clouds had begun to break up now, and [MASK] could see blue in between patches of white. The sun was still shaded, but she knew it would only be a matter of time. It was going to be a beautiful day.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Lon	I want us. I love you and I always have.” She took a deep breath before going on. “But I also want a happy ending without hurting anyone. And I know that if I stayed, people would be hurt. Especially [MASK].
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Fin	“[MASK] died in the war. His destroyer was torpedoed in forty-three.” “I’m sorry,” she said. “I know he was a good friend of yours.” His voice changed, a little deeper now. “He was.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Allie	The downpour was steady now, and [MASK] watched the rain fall diagonally from the sky, trying to defy gravity as it rode on westerly winds that whistled over the trees. The sky darkened a little more, and big heavy drops fell from the clouds. Hurricane drops.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Allie	Then he gracefully stepped off the dock into the canoe, placing his feet carefully to prevent the canoe from capsizing. [MASK] was impressed by his agility, knowing that what he had done so quickly and easily was harder than it looked.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Allie	[MASK] talked about going to college, painting, and her hours spent volunteering at the hospital. She talked about her family and friends and the charities she was involved with. Neither of them brought up anybody they had dated since they’d last seen each other.
<name>Anastasia</name>	Anastasia	Noah	He smiles. He is intrigued by us and the relationship we have. I do not know if his interest is entirely professional. “I suppose so.” He cocks his head at my answer and looks at me. “You okay, [MASK]?
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Noah	She’d had to sneak out her window to do it because her parents wouldn’t allow it, but she hadn’t been caught and she remembered how [MASK] had slipped his arm around her and pulled her close as dawn began to unfold.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Noah	She knew what he had been thinking and felt a tinge of amusement at how young he seemed. “How long have you been standing there?” “A couple of minutes.” [MASK] brushed his hands on his pants, then pointed to the kitchen.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Noah	And sometime after midnight on that clear October evening, it all rushed inward and [MASK] was overcome with longing. And if anyone had seen him, they would have seen what looked like an old man, someone who’d aged a lifetime in just a couple of hours.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Noah	She looked away and didn’t answer for a moment, surprised that she couldn’t tell him just yet. In the silence, [MASK] felt a sinking feeling in his stomach. Whatever it was, was bad. “I don’t know how to say it.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Allie	The birds ignored them for the most part. The only ones who seemed bothered were those forced to move when the canoe approached them. [MASK] reached out to touch the closest ones and felt their feathers ruffling under her fingers.
<name>James</name>	James	Lon	Occasionally she felt like running away with [MASK] to get married without the fuss. But she knew he wouldn’t agree; like the aspiring politician he was, he loved being the center of attention. She took a deep breath and stood again.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Noah	They stayed until thunder boomed in the distance—faint but powerful—and both of them knew it was time to leave. [MASK] led them back to the current of the creek, paddling stronger than he had earlier. She was still amazed by what she had seen.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Allie	I look at where she had been sitting and see her coffee, a full cup, still steaming, and once again I learn that there are good people in the world. I am warm for the first time in years as I begin my trek to [MASK]’s room.
<name>She</name>	She	Allie	He poked the fire, moving the logs, and added some more kindling. [MASK] leaned against the doorjamb, one leg crossed over the other, and continued to watch him. In a few minutes the fire had turned to flames, even and steady.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Noah	But now, as she watched [MASK] rowing, she questioned this basic assumption. He exuded sexuality in everything he did, everything he was, and she caught herself thinking about him in a way that an engaged woman shouldn’t.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Allie	“You always told me you’d find a way to do it.” They both sat quietly for a moment, thinking back again. [MASK] took another sip of tea. “Do you remember sneaking over here the night you first told me about this place?”
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Noah	Both of them seemed to think about that, trying but finding it impossible to displace from their minds. [MASK] finished his beer, surprised that he had emptied it so quickly. “I’m going to go start the water. Can I get you anything?”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Allie	Otherwise she wouldn’t be here.” She watched him as he answered, but she said nothing. [MASK], sensing an argument, cut in: “What do you mean when you say you had to come? Don’t you trust me?”
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Noah	“[MASK], you know what happened the last time you saw her at night.” “I remember.” “Then you know you shouldn’t be doing this.” I don’t answer directly. Instead I say, “I miss her.”
<name>John</name>	John	Lon	She’d tried to deny them, hide from them, but now she realized that she didn’t want them to stop. It had been years since she’d felt this way. [MASK] could not evoke these feelings in her. He never had and probably never would.
<name>James</name>	James	Noah	she’d thought he would, pleased that she would live forever with that knowledge. She had seen too many men in the past few years destroyed by war, or time, or even money. It took strength to hold on to inner passion, and [MASK] had done that.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Noah	“Yes,” he answered simply, and she smiled at him. “I know you don’t think so, but I always liked you, [MASK]. I just didn’t think you were right for my daughter. Can you understand that?”
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Allie	[MASK] organized, as was her disposition. She made arrangements to leave the house and move here. She rewrote her will and sealed it. She left specific burial instructions, and they sit in my desk, in the bottom drawer. I have not seen them.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Noah	“Yes, it has,” she said, “a wonderful night.” [MASK] turned to the stars, their twinkling lights reminding him that she would be leaving soon, and he felt almost empty inside. This was a night he wanted never to end.
<name>Artie</name>	Artie	Noah	You understood my need for my own studio, my own space, and saw beyond the paint on my clothes and in my hair and sometimes on the furniture. I know it was not easy. It takes a man to do that, [MASK], to live with something like that.
<name>John</name>	John	Lon	Even though I wasn’t there, you described it to me only once, and I remember marveling at the strength you showed that day. I still cannot imagine what was going through your mind when you walked into the lobby and saw [MASK], or how it must have felt to talk to him.
<name>He</name>	He	Lon	[MASK] had stared at it, studied it almost, and then had asked her what it was supposed to be. She hadn’t bothered to answer. She shook her head then, knowing she wasn’t being completely fair.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Clem	[MASK] wandered up the stairs, sniffed him as he slept, and then paced in circles before finally curling up at the foot of his bed. Earlier that evening and a hundred miles away, she sat alone on the porch swing of her parents’ home, one leg crossed beneath her.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Allie	But I would think about it. Think about what you really want.” [MASK] turned away, her eyes reddening. A moment later a tear drifted down her cheek. “I don’t know... ” She trailed off, and her mother squeezed her hand.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Lon	As she was driving over the drawbridge less than four minutes after she’d left the inn, [MASK] called from the courthouse. Q/Plov'mQ yPaXtr No. was sitting in his rocker, drinking sweet tea, listening for the car, when he finally heard it turn up the drive.
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Allie	“I can’t make this decision for you, [MASK], this one’s all yours. I want you to know, though, that I love you. And I always will. I know that doesn’t help but it’s all I can do.”
<name>He</name>	He	Noah	Even as a young girl.” “Why?” Saying anything, keeping his balance. “I don’t know. They just always seemed romantic to me.” She was quiet for a moment, and [MASK] watched the fire flicker in her emerald eyes.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Fin	[MASK] kept elbowing me the whole way back to your parents’ house, trying to get me to hold your hand.” “You didn’t, though.” “No,” he answered, shaking his head. “Why not?”
<name>He</name>	He	Lon	But she hadn’t smiled. She was angry. And then [MASK] guessed that she had loved that person far more deeply than her mother had suggested. Maybe even more deeply than she loved him. And now she was there. Interesting.
<name>John</name>	John	Noah	A dog barked in the distance, and [MASK] realized he had been standing with the door open a long time. He quickly closed it, turning back to the kitchen. And as he walked, he wondered if she had noticed how long he’d been gone.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Noah	He watched the car roll slowly forward; he heard the gravel crunching under the wheels. Slowly the car began to turn from him, toward the road that would take her back to town. Leaving—she was leaving!—and [MASK] felt dizzy at the sight. Edging forward ...
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Noah	[MASK] joined her in front of the open door, and she moved to make room for him. She could smell him as he stood next to her— clean, familiar, distinctive—and felt his arm brush against her as he leaned over and reached inside.
<name>Amber</name>	Amber	Allie	No* made breakfast for [MASK] while she slept in the living room. Bacon, biscuits, and coffee, nothing spectacular. He set the tray beside her as she woke up, and as soon as they had finished eating, they made love again.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Noah	[MASK] was up before the sun and dressed quickly, same jeans as last night, undershirt, clean flannel shirt, blue jacket, and boots. He brushed his teeth before going downstairs, drank a quick glass of milk, and grabbed two biscuits on the way out the door.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Noah	[MASK] used the bread knife as a pointer. “Sure, plates are over there. Utensils and napkins there. Make sure you get plenty—crabs can be messy, so we’ll need ’em.” He couldn’t look at her as he spoke.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Noah	“[MASK], before you get the wrong idea, I did want to see you again, but there’s more to it than just that.” She paused for a second. “I came here for a reason. There’s something I have to tell you.”
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Allie	There are so many things I want to ask her, but I know the picture won’t answer, so I put it aside. Tonight, with [MASK] down the hall, I am alone. I will always be alone. This I thought as I lay in the hospital.
<name>She</name>	She	Allie	He smiled and pointed over his shoulder with his thumb. “Great. They’re at the dock. I’ll just be a couple of minutes.” [MASK] watched him walk away and noticed the tension she’d felt when telling him about her engagement was beginning to fade.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Lon	With [MASK] there would be no surprises, and there was comfort in knowing what the future would bring. He would be a kind husband to her, and she would be a good wife. She would have a home near friends and family, children, a respectable place in society.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Noah	Thousands of them. Birds floating so close together in some places that she couldn’t see the water. From a distance, the groups of swans looked almost like icebergs. “Oh, [MASK],” she finally said softly, “it’s beautiful.”
<name>John</name>	John	Noah	She surprised herself with her answer but knew it was true nonetheless. And she also knew by looking at him that [MASK] had suspected the answer in advance. “Why?” She smiled weakly and shrugged as she answered. Her voice was barely above a whisper.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Noah	[MASK] handed her the bread as she was finishing the table, and their fingers touched briefly. He turned his attention back to the frying pan and turned the vegetables. He lifted the lid of the steamer, saw the crabs still had a minute, and let them cook some more.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Allie	What sort of power did she have over him? He finally turned away, shaking his head, and went back to the porch. He checked the barometer again. It hadn’t changed. Then he looked at his watch. [MASK] should be here soon.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Noah	She looks away for a moment, and her voice changes. Her voice is softer now, and I am surprised. She has never struck me as the sentimental type. “[MASK], I’ve worked here for five years and I worked at another home before that.
<name>Old Dan</name>	Old Dan	Clem	“I don’t know how to say it. I thought I did at first, but now I’m not so sure. ...” The air was suddenly rattled by the sharp cry of a raccoon, and [MASK] came out from under the porch, barking gruffly.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Noah	[MASK] She read the letter again, more slowly this time, then read it a third time before she put it back into the envelope. Once more, she imagined him writing it, and for a moment she debated reading another, but she knew she couldn’t delay any longer.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Noah	You were my first, and it was more wonderful than I ever thought it would be.” [MASK] took a drink of bourbon, remembering, bringing back the old feelings again, then suddenly shook his head. This was already hard enough. She went on.
<name>James</name>	James	Noah	[MASK] listened to the crickets and the rustling leaves, thinking that the sound of nature was more real and aroused more emotion than things like cars and planes. Natural things gave back more than they took, and their sounds always brought him back to the way man was supposed to be.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Allie	“That’s fine. I’m not that hungry yet.” He looked at her then, and she saw the softness in his eyes. “I’m glad you came, [MASK],” he said. “Me too. I almost didn’t, though.”
<name>She</name>	She	Allie	He took a few steps before responding. “You are special,” he finally said, and the way he said it made her wonder if he wanted to add something else. But he didn’t, and [MASK] smiled a little before glancing away.
<name>Demetrios</name>	Demetrios	Elayn	The artists were either uninspired or lazy, she thought. On one wall though, there were a few paintings that more suited her tastes. All were by an artist she’d never heard of, [MASK], and most appeared to have been inspired by the architecture of the Greek islands.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Allie	Then he asked: “[MASK], do you love him?” She answered automatically. “Yes, I love him.” The words hurt. But again, he thought he heard something in her tone, as if she were saying it to convince herself.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Allie	The pain coursed through my body like a lightning bolt, and in my last remaining moments of consciousness, I pictured [MASK], lying in her bed, waiting for the story I would never read, lost and confused, completely and totally unable to help herself.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Allie	[MASK] enjoyed the rain and leaned her head back for a moment to let it hit her face. She knew the front of her dress would soak through in a couple of minutes, but she didn’t care. She did wonder, though, if he noticed, then thought he probably did.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Allie	The girl who answered the phone was new and didn’t recognize the name, but she poked around the personnel files for him. She found out that [MASK]’s father had left the company and that no forwarding address was listed.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Lon	[MASK] was waiting for her. Her legs felt weak as she stepped out of the car. She paused and took a deep breath, and as she started across the parking lot, she realized she still wasn’t sure what she was going to say to him.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Lon	She was tired, and she wondered if she would have the energy she needed to talk to [MASK]. And what was she going to say? She still had no idea but hoped that something would come to her when the time came. It would have to.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Allie	I put the second page aside and moved the first page into better light and began to read: My dearest [MASK], The porch is silent except for the sounds that float from the shadows, and for once I am at a loss for words.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Noah	“It was wrong of her to do that, [MASK], and I’m sorry she did. But try to understand. Once I left, she probably thought it would be easier for me to just let it go.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Allie	He became serious with one, a waitress from the local diner with deep blue eyes and silky black hair. Although they dated for two years and had many good times together, he never came to feel the same way about her as he did about [MASK].
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Lon	She sat on the edge of the bed, picked up the phone, and called [MASK]. He couldn’t speak long, he was due in court, but before they hung up she gave him the phone number where she was staying and promised to call the following day.
<name>James</name>	James	Noah	So much had happened since then; it was hard to believe it had been only three weeks. It felt impossible to her that she had arrived only the day before yesterday. It seemed like a lifetime since her dinner with [MASK]. Starlings chirped in the trees around her.
<name>Acme</name>	Acme	Goldman	That trip was the first and last time he ever looked for her. For the next eight years, he worked for [MASK]. At first he was one of twelve employees, but as the years dragged on, the company grew, and he was promoted.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Allie	It’s too beautiful to just throw it away.” She didn’t respond. After a moment he gently turned her toward him, took her hands, and stared at her, willing her to look at him. [MASK] finally faced him with moist eyes.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Noah	She could see everything she really wanted to see if she turned her head, but most of all she wanted to watch [MASK]. It was him she’d come to see, not the creek. His shirt was unbuttoned at the top, and she could see his chest muscles flex with every stroke.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Allie	I know I shouldn’t have kept them from you, and I’m sorry for that. But I was just trying to protect you. I didn’t realize . . .” [MASK] took them and ran her hand over them, shocked.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Allie	I read it sometimes when I am in the mood, and when I do, I am reminded of [MASK] on cold winter evenings, seated by a roaring fire with a glass of wine at her side, reading the letters I had written to her over the years.
<name>Severus</name>	Severus	Noah	[MASK] took the drawing and unrolled it slowly, careful not to tear it. There were dual images, one overlapping the other. The image in the foreground, which occupied most of the page, was a picture of how he looked now, not fourteen years ago.
