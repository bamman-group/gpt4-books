<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	He took off his thick black coat and threw it to [MASK]. “You can kip under that,” he said. “Don’ mind if it wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o’ dormice in one o’ the pockets.”
<name>Lee</name>	Lee	Lee	A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd. “Give us a look, [MASK], go on.” The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	[MASK] took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to face the black flames. “Here I come,” he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp. It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body.
<name>Gringotts</name>	Gringotts	Gringotts	“Number one, I don’ know meself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn’ tell yeh if I could. That Stone’s here fer a good reason. It was almost stolen outta [MASK] — I s’ppose yeh’ve worked that out an’ all?
<name>Hermione</name>	Hermione	Hermione	“Are you really?” said [MASK]. “I know all about you, of course — I got a few extra books for background reading, and you’re in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	she said kindly, and [MASK] nodded. “Not to worry,” she said. “All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don’t stop and don’t be scared you’ll crash into it, that’s very important.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Hagrid	They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was — “Yeah, that’s a goblin,” said [MASK] quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him.
<name>Hagrid</name>	Hagrid	Hagrid	Although [MASK] seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.
<name>Waldo</name>	Waldo	Dumbledore	* i}6& They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction. They had never been told where [MASK] lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him.
<name>Dudley</name>	Dudley	Dudley	dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he’d managed to make it grow back . . . and the very last time [MASK] had hit him, hadn’t he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn’t he set a boa constrictor on him?
<name>Ron</name>	Ron	Harry	“D’you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?” said [MASK]. “Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what’s bin killin’ the unicorns — never heard anythin’ like it before.”
<name>Neville</name>	Neville	Neville	But [MASK] was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate. “I won’t let you do it,” he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole. “I’ll — I’ll fight you!”
<name>Hagrid</name>	Hagrid	Hagrid	* * ^ “A Muggle,” said [MASK], “it’s what we call nonmagic folk like them. An’ it’s your bad luck you grew up in a family o’ the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, [MASK] thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing — noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence.
<name>Neville</name>	Neville	Neville	Anyway, we’d better go and look for [MASK]’s toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we’ll be there soon.” And she left, taking the toadless boy with her.
<name>Squib</name>	Squib	Quidditch	Anyway, what does he know about it, some o’ the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in ’em in a long line o’ Muggles — look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!” “So what is [MASK]?”
<name>Dumbledore</name>	Dumbledore	Dumbledore	“The truth.” [MASK] sighed. “It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you’ll forgive me.
<name>Quirrell</name>	Quirrell	Quirrell	He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share . . . not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left [MASK] to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies.
<name>Colin</name>	Colin	Hagrid	When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest. [MASK] greeted them, looking flushed and excited. “It’s nearly out.”
<name>Firenze</name>	Firenze	Firenze	“We’ve only used the horn and tail hair in Potions.” “That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,” said [MASK]. “Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime.
<name>Ron</name>	Ron	Harry	“Mind you, we did save her.” “She might not have needed saving if we hadn’t locked the thing in with her,” [MASK] reminded him. They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Fred	Is he really, [MASK]? How do you know?” “Asked him. Saw his scar. It’s really there — like lightning.” “Poor dear— no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform.”
<name>Stanley</name>	Stanley	Hagrid	“What?” “He wants payin’ fer deliverin’ the paper. Look in the pockets.” [MASK]’s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets — bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags. . .
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Hermione	Not interested in anythin’ closer’n the moon.” “Are there many of them in here?” asked [MASK]. “Oh, a fair few. . . . Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they’re good enough about turnin’ up if ever I want a word.
<name>Malfoy</name>	Malfoy	Malfoy	“I’d take you on anytime on my own,” said [MASK]. “Tonight, if you want. Wizard’s duel. Wands only — no contact. What’s the matter? Never heard of a wizard’s duel before, I suppose?”
<name>Hermione</name>	Hermione	Hermione	You realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year? They’re very important, I should have started studying a month ago, I don’t know what’s gotten into me. ...” Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as [MASK].
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence — the book was screaming! [MASK] snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, “I can’t believe you’re going to do this, [MASK].”
<name>Hagrid</name>	Hagrid	Hagrid	“Right then,” said [MASK], “now, listen carefully, ’cause it’s dangerous what we’re gonna do tonight, an’ I don’ want no one takin’ risks. Follow me over here a moment.”
<name>Ron</name>	Ron	Ron	He was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying “Voldemort” without worrying. “What’s your Quidditch team?” [MASK] asked.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Peeves	“Let’s find an empty room, you wait ’til you hear this. . . .” He made sure [MASK] wasn’t inside before shutting the door behind them, then he told them what he’d seen and heard.
<name>Hedwig</name>	Hedwig	Norbert	“It shouldn’t be too difficult — I think the cloak’s big enough to cover two of us and [MASK].” It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	“The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.” He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving [MASK] shivering behind him.
<name>Filch</name>	Filch	Filch	“We’d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us — if [MASK] spots one of our feet wandering along on its own —” “What are you doing?” said a voice from the corner of the room.
<name>Hermione</name>	Hermione	Hermione	I was down in the village havin’ a few drinks an’ got into a game o’ cards with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.” “But what are you going to do with it when it’s hatched?” said [MASK].
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Quirrell	“Yes,” said [MASK] idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back. “He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I’d got. He suspected me all along.
<name>Reepicheep</name>	Reepicheep	Hagrid	It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood. “Heads down!” yelled [MASK] as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	“It’s not easy ter catch a unicorn, they’re powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before.” They walked past a mossy tree stump. [MASK] could hear running water; there must be a stream somewhere close by.
<name>Hagrid</name>	Hagrid	Hagrid	You was just a year old. He came ter yer house an’ — an’ —” [MASK] suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn. “Sorry,” he said.
<name>Dudley</name>	Dudley	Dudley	“Couldn’t make us a cup o’ tea, could yeh? It’s not been an easy journey. . . .” He strode over to the sofa where [MASK] sat frozen with fear. “Budge up, yeh great lump,” said the stranger.
<name>Hagrid</name>	Hagrid	Harry	Dark days, [MASK]. Didn’t know who ter trust, didn’t dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches . . . terrible things happened. He was takin’ over. ’Course, some stood up to him — an’ he killed ’em.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	[MASK] walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn’t received his first letter. Surely that meant they’d try again? And this time he’d make sure they didn’t fail.
<name>Ron</name>	Ron	Ron	Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family — in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen weren’t a drawback at all. [MASK] knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted.
<name>Ron</name>	Ron	Ron	“I’ve heard of his family,” said [MASK] darkly. “They were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they’d been bewitched. My dad doesn’t believe it.
<name>Ron</name>	Ron	Ron	“Oh, are you doing magic? Let’s see it, then.” She sat down. [MASK] looked taken aback. “Er — all right.” He cleared his throat. “Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow. ”
<name>Hermione</name>	Hermione	Hermione	It wasn’t ordinary fire either; it was * * THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR * * * ^ purple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped. “Look!” [MASK] seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles.
<name>Hagrid</name>	Hagrid	Hagrid	“Right, follow me, but careful, now.” They walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound. Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved. “Who’s there?” [MASK] called. “Show yerself — I’m armed!”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	The feeling suddenly surged back into [MASK]’s legs. He stumbled backward. “Don’t be a fool,” snarled the face. “Better save your own life and join me ... or you’ll meet the same end as your parents. . . .
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother — why, its brother gave you that scar.” [MASK] swallowed. “Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen.
<name>Filch</name>	Filch	Filch	“You are not. ” “D’you think I’m going to stand out here and wait for [MASK] to catch me? If he finds all three of us I’ll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	The last thing [MASK] saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited. “Hmm,” said a small voice in his ear.
<name>Neville</name>	Neville	Harry	He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose. “Yes,” said [MASK]. “The thing is — the thing is, I don’t know how to —” “How to get onto the platform?”
<name>Hagrid</name>	Hagrid	Hagrid	[MASK] frowned at him. “O’ course I can’t,” he said. “Number one, I don’ know meself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn’ tell yeh if I could. That Stone’s here fer a good reason.
<name>Hagrid</name>	Hagrid	Hagrid	The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by [MASK] before they could fly off again. No one could wait for the holidays to start.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	[MASK] had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he’d be learning to play that night.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	He didn’t know what he was going to — but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind. The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in. “Anyone sitting there?” he asked, pointing at the seat opposite [MASK].
<name>Gran</name>	Gran	Gran	“Its a Remembrall!” he explained. “[MASK] knows I forget things — this tells you if there’s something you’ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red — oh . . .”
<name>Hagrid</name>	Hagrid	Hagrid	The brick he had touched quivered — it wriggled — in the middle, a small hole appeared — it grew wider and wider — a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for [MASK], an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, [MASK]’s new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn’t concern him was put to an unexpected test. Walking back from the library on his own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	There was a lot more to magic, as [MASK] quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words. They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets.
<name>Ron</name>	Ron	Hermione	He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open. “What can you see?” [MASK] said anxiously. “Nothing — just black — there’s no way of climbing down, we’ll just have to drop.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for [MASK]. As they couldn’t go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom.
<name>Hermione</name>	Hermione	Ron	She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth. “We’ve already told him we haven’t seen it,” said [MASK], but the girl wasn’t listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.
<name>Griphook</name>	Griphook	Griphook	Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole. “Stand back,” said [MASK] importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away. C H A p T E B. I* I V E
<name>Ron</name>	Ron	Ronnie	The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose. “Mom — geroff.” He wriggled free. “Aaah, has ickle [MASK] got somefink on his nosie?” said one of the twins.
<name>Flamel</name>	Flamel	Flamel	Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He’d be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who [MASK] was.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto [MASK]’s plate.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	“I know what you’re thinking about, [MASK], that mirror. Don’t go back tonight.” “Why not?” “I dunno, I’ve just got a bad feeling about it — and anyway, you’ve had too many close shaves already.
<name>Potter</name>	Potter	Petunia	His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn’t stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge. “P-P-[MASK]!” he gasped.
<name>Dumbledore</name>	Dumbledore	Dumbledore	Then he said slowly, “It shows us what we want. . . whatever we want...” “Yes and no,” said [MASK] quietly. “It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts.
<name>Filch</name>	Filch	Filch	“Know you’re there, even if I can’t see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?” He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them. “Should call [MASK], I should, if something’s a-creeping around unseen.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	“I’d give anything for one of these,” he said. “Anything. What’s the matter?” “Nothing,” said [MASK]. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father?
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	“There’s a list there of everything yeh need.” [MASK] unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn’t noticed the night before, and read: HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT andWIZARDRY UNIFORM First-year students will require: 1. Three sets of plain work robes (black) 2.
<name>Hermione</name>	Hermione	Hermione	“We’ve got to go, we’re going to be late.” They hadn’t even reached the end of the corridor when [MASK] caught up with them. “I’m coming with you,” she said. “You are not. ”
<name>Quirrell</name>	Quirrell	Quirrell	There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it. . . . Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me.” [MASK] shivered suddenly.
<name>Dudley</name>	Dudley	Dudley	One minute to go and he’d be eleven. Thirty seconds . . . twenty. . . ten . . . nine — maybe he’d wake [MASK] up, just to annoy him — three . . . two . . . one . . . BOOM.
<name>Hagrid</name>	Hagrid	Hagrid	Every morning the ground was covered in frost. [MASK] could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots. The Quidditch season had begun.
<name>Hermione</name>	Hermione	Hermione	“There’s only enough there for one of us,” he said. “That’s hardly one swallow.” They looked at each other. “Which one will get you back through the purple flames?” [MASK] pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	“He’s coming now.” The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and [MASK] noticed a shiny silver badge on his chest with the letter P on it.
<name>Ron</name>	Ron	Harry	There they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him. “See?” [MASK] whispered. “I can’t see anything.” “Look! Look at them all. . . there are loads of them. . . .”
<name>Fred</name>	Fred	Fred	“Only joking, I am [MASK],” said the boy, and off he went. His twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had gone — but how had he done it?
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	“If that’s what I think it is — they’re really rare, and really valuable.” “What is it?” [MASK] picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	[MASK] looked at the tiny bottle. “There’s only enough there for one of us,” he said. “That’s hardly one swallow.” They looked at each other. “Which one will get you back through the purple flames?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	[MASK] wished he could forget what he’d seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn’t. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.
<name>Hermione</name>	Hermione	Hermione	“All right — I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,” said [MASK] in a sniffy voice. “And you’ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?”
<name>Ron</name>	Ron	Ron	He couldn’t stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother’s face, whispered, “I’ll come back,” and hurried from the room. “You could have woken me up,” said [MASK], crossly.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. [MASK] wished they wouldn’t, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	If you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that. Now, why don’t you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?” [MASK] stood up.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	He held out an enormous hand and shook [MASK]’s whole arm. “What about that tea then, eh?” he said, rubbing his hands together. “I’d not say no ter summat stronger if yeh’ve got it, mind.”
<name>Ron</name>	Ron	Harry	Finally he said, “Now, don’t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess —” “We’re not offended,” said [MASK] quickly. “Just tell us what to do.”
<name>Mrs. Weasley</name>	Mrs. Weasley	Gran	But I bounced — all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, [MASK] was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here — they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	So — think you’ve got all that?” “Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,” [MASK] reeled off.
<name>Ron</name>	Ron	Ron	“Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,” snarled [MASK], leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck. »aaz “Shut up, I’m trying to remember how to kill it!”
<name>Snape</name>	Snape	Snape	“Right, here’s what we’ve got to do,” he whispered urgently. “One of us has got to keep an eye on [MASK] — wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	it whispered. [MASK] tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn’t move. “See what I have become?” the face said. “Mere shadow and vapor ... I have form only when I can share another’s body . . .
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	He tried to lift: it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot. “Want a hand?” It was one of the red-haired twins he’d followed through the barrier. “Yes, please,” [MASK] panted.
<name>Slartibartfast</name>	Slartibartfast	Dumbledore	[MASK] gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge.
<name>Ollivanders</name>	Ollivanders	Ollivanders	The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read [MASK]: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 b.c. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window. A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside.
<name>Neville</name>	Neville	Neville	It was [MASK]. He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer. “Thank goodness you found me! I’ve been out here for hours, I couldn’t remember the new password to get in to bed.”
<name>Ron</name>	Ron	Unicorn	“[MASK] hair’s nearly poking out. Anyway —” He had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again. The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes.
