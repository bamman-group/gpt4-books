<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Diana	“Are you one of these Christians, too?” “I’m afraid not,” sighed [MASK]. “It’s too hard for me to understand . . . Did he”—she glanced toward Antonia—“did he talk much about it while he was here?”
<name>Belisarius</name>	Belisarius	Namius	The examination proceeded swiftly. [MASK] gave an account of the duel in the corridor. “We stopped it,” he concluded, “when this Syrian picked up a shard of the broken water jar and threw it at the Greek.”
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Demetrius	“I have been away from you a long time, [MASK],” he said, unsteadily. "Yes, sir. I need not tell you how glad I am that you have returned. Is there anything I can do for you?”
<name>Woot</name>	Woot	Marcellus	“When there are dangers to be faced, old men should keep still, for there’s little they can do, in any case.” “I should have thought,” commented [MASK], graciously, “that an elderly man’s experience would make him a wise counselor—on any occasion.”
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Diana	He wished he had gone back once more to see his mother. He wished he had kissed [MASK]. He wished he had not witnessed the devastating grief of his sister . . . Click! Clack! Click! Clack!
<name>Phileas</name>	Phileas	Marcellus	“They will think no less of us,” said [MASK], “and it will make them think better of themselves—and their work.” Presently they came upon an old woman who was straining hard to lift her heavy basket up to the platform of a cart.
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	Gaius	He would be terrifically angry, of course, and if he did anything about it at all he might make matters worse; but—somebody in the family must be informed where we stood in the opinion of [MASK] before any more risks were taken.
<name>Arakasi</name>	Arakasi	Marcellus	The aide, who had dismounted, carried the scroll up the steps and handed it over. “His Highness might do well to employ messengers with better manners,” drawled [MASK]. “Are you to await an answer?” “Imperial commands require obedience; not replies!
<name>Thornhill</name>	Thornhill	Marcellus	He was hungry at dinnertime. A smart breeze had risen, as the twilight came on, and the deck was abandoned. [MASK] went to his cabin, opened his largest bag, and took out the Galilean Robe, folding it as compactly as possible.
<name>Thufir</name>	Thufir	Gallio	I command you to sit down! You are an old, old man. Sit down— before you fall down!” [MASK] gratefully sank into the luxurious chair by the Emperor’s massive golden bed, pleased to observe that the royal storm was subsiding somewhat.
<name>Madeline</name>	Madeline	Marcellus	He drew her tightly to him. Her lips trembled as he kissed her. “Our happiness was too sweet to last, [MASK]. Go, now, dear, I shall try to understand. I know this has been as hard for you as for me.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Caligula	[MASK], at sixteen, was wizened and frail. He jerked when he walked. His pasty-white, foxish face was perpetually in motion with involuntary grimaces and his restless fingers were always busily picking and scratching like a monkey. He was no fool, though.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Justus	“Big enough to be stormy. They have some rough gales.” “Any fishing?” [MASK] nodded indifferently, and a middle-aged man sitting in front of them turned his head, plainly wanting to say something.
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Marcellus	“Nothing secret about it then.” “No—not then. The priests were already plotting how they might destroy his influence with the people, but they were not yet openly hostile.” “That’s strange,” said [MASK].
<name>Abdul</name>	Abdul	Marcipor	“Patience, my son!” murmured [MASK], as he led the way toward the tombs. “It has still a long, hard road to travel.” The narrow, uneven steps down into the tunnel were dark as night.
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Diana	He is a slave, and we can’t be too careful.” [MASK]’s tone was distinctly stern, until her curiosity overwhelmed her indignation. “So—then”—she went on, a little more gently—“he shook hands with you.”
<name>Lucius</name>	Lucius	Marcellus	Are you sure you aren’t related to the Senator?” “He is my father,” said [MASK]. “I believe that,” she replied, turning her face toward him with an honest smile. “But why do you tell me?”
<name>Philo</name>	Philo	Marcellus	The Captain waited, and the Procurator watched out of the tail of his eye, while the seals were broken. [MASK] thrust a shaky dagger through the heavy wax, slowly unrolled the papyrus, and ran his eye over the brief message.
<name>Drusus</name>	Drusus	Demetrius	“The Tribune needed no one to bring him home. He is fully master of himself now.” [MASK] raised his eyes and regarded her with frank admiration. “May I tell the Tribune’s sister how very—how very well she is looking?”
<name>Clarence</name>	Clarence	Demetrius	“No, sir—I am entirely sincere—and bewildered. I think this Jesus was interested in everybody! I think he was sorry for everybody!" [MASK] paused, and murmured apologetically, “Perhaps I have been talking too freely, sir.”
<name>Thrasymachus</name>	Thrasymachus	Benjamin	What do you want with gods—you who think that men are like cattle, to be led by a halter? Why should you look to the gods, when your dog dQesn’t?” [MASK] paused in his monologue to refill their goblets.
<name>Mask</name>	Mask	Demetrius	He wanted to talk about it; wanted [MASK] to plead his case, if he had one, with an air of deep conviction. You couldn’t get anywhere with a map who, when you called him a fool, calmly admitted it.
<name>Lucius</name>	Lucius	Gallio	[MASK] debated with himself, for a moment, how best to proceed, half-sorry he had alluded to the incident. “My son was accompanied by his Greek slave, a quite intelligent fellow. It is from him that I have this feature of the story.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Marcellus	You are to sail tomorrow! What ails you, [MASK]?” Once he roused to brief attention as the figure of a man with a pack on his shoulder neared his darkened doorway. The fellow was keeping close to the wall, proceeding with stealthy steps.
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	Diana	Knowing how you felt about the supernatural, I hardly expected you to be so understanding.” “Well—this is different!” [MASK] suddenly released herself and sat up to face him. “What I feared was that it might somehow affect your life—and mine, too.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Diana	Nobody’s behavior would be scrutinized. People would be scurrying about on unfamiliar errands. Maybe [MASK] would have no trouble in keeping her engagement; but, even if she were lucky enough to do that, it was a perilous risk she still had to face.
<name>Artemidorus</name>	Artemidorus	Gallio	“Yes, sir! Having heard and seen that, I should be a coward if I did not testify to it! For I, too, am a Christian, sir! I cannot do otherwise!” [MASK] made no reply.
<name>Philoctetes</name>	Philoctetes	Demetrius	So long as your master was able to stagger out of the room and unburden his stomach, you had no cause for humiliation; but if he went to sleep, your fellow slaves winked at you and grinned. [MASK] stood at attention, against the wall, immediately behind his master’s couch.
<name>Lucius</name>	Lucius	Marcellus	The sun was high now, and [MASK] carried the Galilean Robe folded over his arm. He frequently paused to rest in the shade beside the descending stream that grew more and more active as the grade stiffened toward the foothills of the distant, snowcapped Apennines.
<name>Herod</name>	Herod	Gallio	"Wait a little, sir,” he advised. “He’s not very strong yet. It is an effort for him to talk.” “But I want to speak to this Galilean!” said [MASK]. “This is no small thing that has happened.
<name>Phileas</name>	Phileas	Miriam	“They are free to go anywhere they please.” “Indeed!” exclaimed [MASK]. “Don’t they ever run away?” “Not often. There’s no place for them to go.” "That’s too bad.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Marcellus	A disturbing constraint on [MASK]’ part, a forced amiability, an involuntary shrinking away from a compassionate contact lest it inadvertently touch some painfully sensitive lesion—these strange retreats, in pathetic combination with an obvious wish to show a filial affection, constituted a baffling situation.
<name>Ezra</name>	Ezra	Benjamin	“Did you say to yourself, ‘I must take that cross old Jew some of these nice figs’?—or did you say, ‘I want to ask [MASK] some questions, and I’ll take the figs along, so he’ll think I just dropped in to be friendly’?”
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Marcellus	Nothing appeared to be alive in the massive bed but the cavernous eyes that had met [MASK] at the door and accompanied him through the room to the straight-backed chair. The face in the pillows was a scaffolding of bulging bones thinly covered with wrinkled parchment.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Marcellus	“It wasn’t exactly a condition to his promise to send for [MASK]; but—he seems now to think it was. I thought he would forget about it. He forgets almost everything. But—I’m afraid he means to go through with it.
<name>John</name>	John	Grandfather	“We will talk about it tomorrow,” he promised. “Then I should get to bed at once,” she decided, springing to her feet. “May I have breakfast with you, [MASK]?”
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Paulus	I shall summon you.” [MASK] watched the retreating figure of the old guard until he reached the door; then, glancing about the room, he said quietly, “You may all go.” He looked up over his shoulder.
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Marcellus	After a while he returned with five husky Syrians to whom he pointed out the burdens to be carried. There were no uniforms on the dirty wharf, but [MASK] was not disappointed. He had not expected to be met. The garrison had not been advised of his arrival.
<name>Caspar</name>	Caspar	Demetrius	Folding the bloodstained, thorn-rent Robe over his arm, [MASK] returned to the banquet hall. He felt like a traitor, assisting in the mockery of a cherished friend. Surely this Jesus deserved a better fate than to be abandoned—even in death—to the whims of a drunken soldier.
<name>Stevenson</name>	Stevenson	Justus	“And had spent the whole week at it,” said [MASK]. “But it seemed that the hill would be too much for him. I counseled him not to try; that his heart might fail him; but he wouldn’t listen.
<name>Lucius</name>	Lucius	Marcellus	The Emperor is said to have a large contingent of astrologers, diviners of oracles, ghost-tenders, dream-mechanics and all that sort of thing—clustered about him. It would be a sorry business for my master to be engaged in!” [MASK] had begun to share the Corinthian’s seriousness.
<name>Philoctetes</name>	Philoctetes	Benjamiri	Either they all are—or none! I, [MASK], think they all are! Therefore, when I enslave another man, placing him at] one with the cattle in the fields, I throw my whole case away.”
<name>Ben-Hur</name>	Ben-Hur	Marcellus	If the aged Jew was alarmed at the presence of an urbane young Roman in his house, he gave no sign of it. He maintained his seat on the bench of his loom, methodically polite but not obsequious. [MASK] briefly stated his errand.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Marcellus	“His apparently effortless courage, I think,” said [MASK]. “They were all arrayed against him—the government, the Temple, the merchants, the bankers, the influential voices, the money. Not a man spoke in his behalf. His friends deserted him.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Marcellus	“What of it? What did he say? What did he do?” “He tried to make love to me.” “That loathsome beast!” roared [MASK], leaping to his feet. “I’ll tear his dirty tongue out!
<name>Charley</name>	Charley	Demetrius	“Do you think he would let me see it again, [MASK]? So much has happened, lately, to depress me. Do you know—my friend—that when I touched the Robe, that night, it—it did something for me!
<name>Glaucon</name>	Glaucon	Demetrius	“But you haven’t quite answered my question, [MASK]. Do you believe in the gods—now?” “No, sir.” “Do you mean that you don’t believe they render any service to men? Or do you doubt that the gods exist, at all?”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Marcellus	Your bedouin, sir, is a wild man; wild as a fox and sneaking as a jackal. When he strikes, he slips up on you from the rear and lets you have it between your shoulder blades.” “But—doesn’t the garrison avenge these murders?” exclaimed [MASK].
<name>her</name>	her	Diana	He had taken her in his arms, but rather diffidently, for he felt he would not be coming back; and it wasn’t quite honest to make promises. This time he held [MASK] tightly—and kissed her.
<name>Liberty</name>	Liberty	Jupiter	Never had there been anything so tiresome as that interminable Ode to [MASK]! Never had there been anything so dull as those solemn choruses! “Yes—but—Your Majesty, were we not obliged to follow the ancient ritual?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Demetrius	[MASK] wished she would take it more slowly. He had cautioned her about that. She would burn her hands; perhaps lose her grip. When a lit- tie more than halfway down, she slipped several feet before checking herself by twining her legs more tightly about the rope.
<name>Barabbas</name>	Barabbas	Gallio	[MASK] nodded. “Yes—and he has never been the same since.” “Ha!” exclaimed the Emperor, brightening. “Now we are getting someplace with this story! Does your son think the Jew laid a curse on his Robe?”
<name>Phileas</name>	Phileas	Demetrius	[MASK] laid a hand on the older Corinthian’s shoulder and drew him closer. “It is something I must tell you,” he murmured. “Come to my room at midnight. I cannot tarry now. I must go back to him.”
<name>Archer</name>	Archer	Marcellus	“You used to spend half your time there—in the gymnasium and the baths.” [MASK] leaned forward with his elbows on his knees and stared moodily at his interlaced fingers. “That was before I knew what it had cost to erect that marble clubhouse,” he said, soberly.
<name>help</name>	help	Marcellus	The thing couldn’t happen; but it did.” Feeling that this sort of conversation didn’t [MASK] had mumbled good night and pretei On the next day and the day thereafter, the subject had been discussed on the road, as profitlessly.
<name>Drusus</name>	Drusus	Demetrius	He opened the door for the Senator to precede him. In the atrium, leaning against a column, lounged [MASK]. Coming smartly to attention he saluted with his spear and followed a few paces behind the two men as they strolled through the vasty rooms and out to the spacious western portico.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Justus	[MASK] was grinning broadly. The old man’s lips twitched with a self-reproachful smile. “Well,” he admitted, “perhaps we did think that after getting us into this trouble he might take a hand at one of the buckets.
<name>Lucius</name>	Lucius	Demetrius	“Remember the promise I have made—for you to keep! You are to return to your own countrymen— and testify for our Christos who has made you whole!” [MASK]' white forehead wrinkled a little, but he made no reply.
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Paulus	“I don’t even know how it is done. You’ll have to tell me.” [MASK] carefully picked his way back to the table where the grotesquely shaped wineskin sat. Refilling the big cup, he handed it, dripping, to his Commander.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Justus	“That’s what I made of it,” admitted [MASK]. “And then there was a story that two men had seen him on the highway and asked him to have supper with them at an inn.” “Reliable people?” “I didn’t know them.
<name>Philo</name>	Philo	Diana	“Movement?” echoed [MASK], mystifiedly. “Nothing less—and it has in it the seeds of revolution. Already, throughout our Palestinian provinces, thousands are professing that this Jesus is the Christos—the Anointed One—and are calling themselves Christians.
<name>Zadok</name>	Zadok	Benyosef	To reach [MASK] s shop, it was necessary to traverse a few blocks on the rim of the congested market district where the shabby hovels of the very poor huddled close to the reeking alleys. Here there was much excitement, frantic chatter, and gesticulations.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Zenos	“No—they’re not crazy,” objected [MASK]. “The people who run the Temple have got to dispose of him somehow, or he’ll ruin their business. Haven’t you heard what he did over there—same day we saw him?”
<name>Timothy</name>	Timothy	Hariph	“Was he glad to get it?” “He had some of his own,” said [MASK], adding, quickly, “But there were plenty of people who did not have any food along with them, sir. And everyone was fed, that day!
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Demetrius	m It was the first time he had ever realized the full meaning of freedom. Pausing at [MASK]’ open door he noted with satisfaction that his loyal slave, whose anxiety had been as painful as his own, was still soundly sleeping. That was good.
<name>Pat</name>	Pat	Diana	Then the scowl returned, as she plodded along doggedly. “You had decided you weren’t going to like me,” said [MASK], “and I don’t think that’s fair. That isn’t the way one girl should treat another.”
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Marcipor	I tried to forget that harrowing glimpse of my father, but it tortured me. That is why I have sought your counsel. Shall I return? Is there anything I can do?” With bowed head and downcast eyes, [MASK] meditated a reply.
<name>Philostratus</name>	Philostratus	Legate	There are letters for you, I notice, [MASK]. I asked the Tribune to take them to you when he went to deliver the message from the Emperor, but he is a haughty young fellow; said he was not a common errand boy.”
<name>McTeague</name>	McTeague	Benjamin	“So—he decided not to come; eh?” observed [MASK], glancing up sourly and returning immediately to his stitches. “Well—you’re much too early. I have not finished. As you see, I am at work on it now.”
<name>Hardy</name>	Hardy	Kaeso	Let us pay him ten, and I will be content with sixteen instead of twenty.” “Very well,” said [MASK]. “You’re a fool—but if that’s the way you want it—” “With one stipulation, sir.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Marcellus	“Thank you, sir,” replied [MASK], remotely. He half-rose from his couch, but finding that his knees were still weak, sank down again. Too much attention had already been focused on him: he would not take the risk of an unfortunate exit.
<name>Hadrian</name>	Hadrian	Marcellus	I shall have a word with him in the morning.” “The letter, sir,” said the guard, impressively, “is from the Emperor!” [MASK], who had listened with scant interest, now leaned forward and looked at the Procurator inquisitively.
<name>Olga</name>	Olga	Marcellus	He was on the point of asking her if she had ever thought of taking up diplomacy as a profession; but the matter at issue was too serious for badinage. He grew suddenly grave. “Now that you know—about [MASK]—I need not repeat the painful story.”
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Diana	With a contented sigh, [MASK] childishly snuggled her face against his breast while he held her tightly to him. She was trembling. Then, slowly disengaging herself from his arms, she looked up into his face with misty, smiling eyes.
<name>Dr. Meade</name>	Dr. Meade	Sarpedon	Get him out of these soiled garments and wrap him in heated blankets.” There was a little excitement in the stable yard as one of the younger slaves made off at a gallop for [MASK]. A half-dozen grooms and gardeners gathered about the straw pallet and raised it gently.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Nevius	There is a mystery behind it, I think. [MASK] had a tale about a haunted Robe—and darkness in the middle of the afternoon—and a confused jumble about a predicted Messiah, or something like that.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Diana	It was a sorry parting. [MASK] clung to him, weeping piteously. “Be brave, darling,” he had entreated. “Perhaps this is only to humiliate me. The Emperor will probably rebuke me—and set me free—with an admonition.
<name>Lucius</name>	Lucius	Marcellus	That,” he interrupted himself to remark, “was how we lost three-and-twenty thousand Romans—to get possession of the old salt lick.” “A most interesting story,” mused [MASK], who had never heard it told just that way.
<name>Lucius</name>	Lucius	Gallio	The chamberlain showed him to a sumptuous apartment and [MASK] sank into a chair utterly exhausted. Two well-trained Macedonians began unpacking his effects, laying out fresh linen. Another slave drew water for his bath while a big Nubian, on his knees, unlaced the Senator’s sandals.
<name>He</name>	He	Marcellus	“We’re all talking too freely,” he muttered. [MASK] turned away, followed by the tavern keeper, and inquired for a bath and a room for the night. A servant showed him to his cramped and cheerless quarters, and he began tossing off his clothes.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Demetrius	He was pale. His forehead was beaded with perspiration. His hands were trembling. [MASK] turned away with a deep sigh. That night he decided to do the thing he had resolved to do if all other expedients failed. It would be drastic treatment.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Marcellus	Had you not heard?” “Of course; but the Pater’s strong enough to take care of himself,” declared [MASK], almost too confidently to be convincing. There was a considerable pause before his sister spoke. He felt her body trembling.
<name>Pilate</name>	Pilate	Tiberius	“Indeed!” [MASK] leaned forward with sudden interest. “What did he do?” “It is their custom, sire, to sell sacrificial animals in the court of the Temple. The priests profit by it, demanding high prices from the poor.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Marcellus	“Well—it certainly wouldn’t mean anything if I said it,” replied [MASK]. “But if a man who had been out of this life were able to return from—from wherever he had been—he might conceivably have a kingdom elsewhere.”
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Jonathan	[MASK] is a great comfort to us. Perhaps you know how it is, sir, in a home where a child is sick or crippled. He gets a little more care; a little more love, maybe, to make up for it.
<name>Smee</name>	Smee	Paulus	It was the first time he had been entirely at ease since the night he had left home. After a while [MASK] came in to see if his young Commander had everything he wanted. “I am writing some letters,” he said.
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Marcellus	It had been a long time since they had needed each other so urgently. + + + After [MASK] had spent a half hour alone with his mother—an ordeal he had dreaded—his next engagement was with his sister.
<name>Hadassah</name>	Hadassah	Paulus	“If what you’ve heard is revolting,” commented [MASK], bitterly, “it’s correct. But if you are so concerned about these Christians, it might be to their advantage if one of their daughters sang acceptably for the lecherous old fox.”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Marcellus	And something else had been added, something not easy to define, a curious radiance of personality. There was a new strength in [MASK], a contagious energy that vitalized the house. It was in his voice, in his eyes, in his hands.
<name>He</name>	He	Gaius	Generosity, in his opinion, is a sign of weakness. By imputing it to him, you will have given him further offense. [MASK] has reasons to be sensitive about his power. Never put yourself on the defensive with a man who is fretting about his own insecurity.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Diana	If you thought you had such a dangerous secret, why should you tell that romping infant [MASK]?” “Because she was afraid of him, too, and understood my reasons for not wanting to be left alone with him.
<name>He</name>	He	Marcellus	Is it not true, in our life, that they find who seek? You are a man of good intent. You are kind. You deserve to have a religion.” [MASK] couldn’t think of an appropriate rejoinder to that, so he sat silent, waiting for further directions.
<name>Domitian</name>	Domitian	Tiberius	“We will not disturb your young sister with any other interpretation,” advised the Senator, “but it is no joke; nor is [MASK] merely trying to be playful when he stations a dozen Numidian gladiators at the doors and windows of his bedchamber . . .
<name>Armitage</name>	Armitage	Kaeso	“What chance will he have, with so many looking for him?” “Well—he knows his life is worth nothing if they catch him,” said [MASK], grimly. “He will make them earn their reward: you may be sure of that!”
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Demetrius	She glanced into the room, gave a smothered cry, and dashed through the doorway, throwing herself down on her knees beside the bed. “Oh—what have they done to you?” she moaned. “[MASK]!”
<name>Titus</name>	Titus	Demetrius	But apparently the Jews didn’t care who read their minds. All this, thought the Corinthian, was what the sight of their holy city had done to their emotions. Suddenly, for no reason at all that [MASK] could observe, there was a wave of excitement.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Lucia	Their long-lashed eyes widened with apprehension as [MASK] drew closer, but they did not flinch. Cupping her hands softly under their round chins, she drew up their faces, smiled a little, and said, “Don’t be afraid. I won’t bite you.”
<name>Challoner</name>	Challoner	Paulus	On either side of the paved area sloped an exotic garden of flowers and ornamental shrubbery watered from marble basins in which lavish fountains played. “These fountains,” said [MASK], in a discreet undertone, “were an afterthought.
<name>Roger</name>	Roger	Demetrius	Sometimes they seemed to be making no progress at all. Neither spoke until they were in the quiet water on the bay side. Thoroughly spent, [MASK] pulled the dory into the dark mouth of a grotto, and slumped over with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Thomas	“But he has seen it through! Hasn’t he given his donkey to the crippled lad? You don’t think he may repent of his gallantry, and ask [MASK] to give the donkey back; do you?” “No, no—not that!
