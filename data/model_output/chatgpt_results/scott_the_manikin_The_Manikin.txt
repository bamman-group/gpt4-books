<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sid	He hears [MASK] whistling from the far side of the orchard. He hears the rattle of a woodpecker, the screech of blue jays, the buzz of horseflies. The sky is pearl white, and the intense, cidery fragrance of neglected windfalls is dispersed from underfoot by the breeze.
<name>Edythe</name>	Edythe	Lily	The old woman has never seemed so pathetic, or so ancient, even as she flutters her hands about to impress the girl with her gaiety. And when [MASK] makes a weak stab at wit—“If I keep eating this way you’ll have to add me to your collection of stuffed beasts”—Mrs.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Boggio	[MASK], by virtue of his long-suffering independence, has little to lose. He holds the frilly panties to his nose. There’s a smell of buttered bread in the middle, and the panties are damp at the puckered edges where they’ve been resting against the wall.
<name>Laura</name>	Laura	Peg	We including the both of us, [MASK], you and me, for though you’re a working girl now you still have some growing to do and I wish you’d do it at home, our home, where I will be the mistress of the manor and you without a care in the world.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Ellen	He is talking about liquor again, its pleasures and ill effects, but in [MASK]’s mind his hands slide under her elbows from behind and follow the curves of her body to her breasts. His hands on her breasts, cupping and massaging.
<name>God</name>	God	Lore	Implied in the name is excessive trust. And more than that. It’s as though her worry over her daughter had become a pretext as she’d spoken, until, by the final sentence, she hears herself appeal to [MASK] for something else, a personal kind of reassurance.
<name>Huckleberry</name>	Huckleberry	Boggio	[MASK] walks on, the mud squishing water into the hole in his right shoe. He doesn’t need a lantern tonight, not with the moon lighting up the landscape. He slaps another mosquito on the back of his neck.
<name>Marmee</name>	Marmee	Ellen	Throughout her daughter’s childhood, [MASK] spared her both from chores and from punishment, as she herself had been spared for the first eight years of her life. But after her parents died within six months of each other, she and her brothers and sisters were dispersed to relatives.
<name>her daughter</name>	her daughter	Peg	She watches [MASK] take a long drink of milk, winces but manages to keep quiet when her daughter wipes her lip with the back of her hand. Now’s not the time to remind her about the use of napkins.
<name>The father</name>	The father	Lore	But the boy’s resilient enough—he can take care of himself. [MASK] turns to look at his son, who sits at the end of the table paging through his old arithmetic primer. In a few years he’ll be every girl’s dream.
<name>Cheryl</name>	Cheryl	Peg	Immediately, [MASK] is struck by a disturbing lifelessness. The trees look freshly painted, their young leaves like pieces of wax, moss upholstered to their exposed roots, the forest floor synthetic, the whole scene beautiful, perhaps, but too colorful, too silent.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Sylva	For the first time in the evening she does feel a twinge of shame—not over what she’s doing but because of what she’ll never be. And then she hears the clatter of pots in the kitchen, reminding her of [MASK]’s disapproval and the adventure ahead of her.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Billie	So soft are the ashes that when she closes her eyes and holds them in her cupped hand she can imagine she’s holding goosedown. Or cobwebs. She had better check on [MASK] later to make sure she’s reaching the cobwebs in the highest corners with her feather duster.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Boggio	And isn’t this realization itself an accomplishment? But right now there is work to do, testimonies to rehearse, letters to write. He’ll turn his fate around and reclaim his rightful inheritance, thanks to [MASK]. That old beggar will say anything for a dime.
<name>He</name>	He	Hal	Unfortunately, he hadn’t bothered to arrange a proper psychiatric evaluation. [MASK] had chosen to stay as far away from her as possible, making infrequent visits simply to remind his mother that he was her only son and sole heir. All for naught, as it turns out.
<name>me</name>	me	Lily	The bell—do you know what it means? Listen. It means your mother knows about you and [MASK]. There’s the diary to prove it. So that’s what she was doing while you lay there wishing her away. She knows, goddamn her!
<name>his</name>	his	Lily	She rests her head on [MASK]’s chest, knowing that now they can’t continue, not tonight, at least. The effort of transgression has exhausted them, and they lie in each other’s arms without speaking.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Peg	I am too good for such a man! And still I held him and let him cover me with kisses. And I have no regrets. For here’s the thing. [MASK]: he loves me, no denying. What do you think accounts for it?
<name>He</name>	He	Hal	Stuffed! A seventy-five-year-old female aristocrat, a unique specimen of a precious breed, more authentic than a waxwork copy. [MASK] had never much liked his mother, truth be told, never enjoyed her company, not even as a small boy.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Boggio	Even the most sophisticated gentleman will lose his poise if he’s woken from a deep sleep with a bloodcurdling scream. But [MASK] doesn’t have the voice for it, nor the courage. His head pivots, his attention drawn by the magnetic summons of his most perfect creature, his beloved snowy owl.
<name>he</name>	he	Lore	But she doesn’t make a move to lift herself to a more civilized position, and neither does [MASK]. Instead, since it is a night to laugh, what with the awed, bulbous-nosed moon watching their antics, that is what they do.
<name>Marianne</name>	Marianne	Ellen	It is a pleasant sort of sadness, rich with meaning. He turns on his side, as indifferent to the discomfort of the pinewood floor as a man in love. [MASK] thought she knew about love. The responsibilities. She has always been a responsible woman.
<name>Hand</name>	Hand	Bentham	The hand of the dead presides. This is what [MASK] sought to prove. The testator, by the terms of his will, may control the distribution of his property. But there are differences of opinion on this matter, you may be sure.
<name>mother</name>	mother	Ellen	Was she dead? Dying? Through that horrible night, [MASK] had subjected her daughter to every cruelty she could think of in order to prepare herself for the worst, then retracted each thought because she couldn’t bear it, and then forced her mind to continue.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Boggio	He holds the frilly panties to his nose. There’s a smell of buttered bread in the middle, and the panties are damp at the puckered edges where they’ve been resting against the wall. [MASK]’s wall, violated.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Peg	As soon as you have a nickel to spare you’re going to a picture show. You can hardly wait. What else will you do, [MASK]? Buy yourself a White Castle hamburger. You’re not hungry now, but you’re anticipating hunger. The effort.
<name>he</name>	he	Lore	It’s all filth, and now [MASK] stands in front of her, a filthy brute, a beast, no, more disgusting than an animal because he could at least take out his handkerchief and wipe his face, but he doesn’t bother. Is someone laughing?
<name>Death</name>	Death	Junket	Lovely bird. She’ll never see the blossoms of the dogwood or the speckled carpet of lily of the valley underfoot. She’ll never crush a wild strawberry upon her tongue. Think of all she’ll miss because of [MASK]’s expert aim.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Ellen	No startles or insomnia. She doesn’t even hear her daughter enter the room and rustle about as she gets ready for bed. Sleep is [MASK]’s reward for a good day’s work, and she guards it as carefully as a miser guards his gold.
<name>Sugarman</name>	Sugarman	Lore	The smoky sweetness of boiling sap fills the air around the huge stone fireplace behind the barn. [MASK] stops listening to the account of financial troubles and concentrates on the pleasures of this crop. Steal the blood from a sugar maple, boil it down, and this is what you get.
<name>John Steinbeck</name>	John Steinbeck	Lore	He’ll go out into the world with little more than a sixth-grade education and the clothes on his back. That’s [MASK]’s fault. He had convinced himself that the huge spread of land in his charge was education enough.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Lily	Shackle her to the cellar wall, that’s the only way to manage her, lock her in the coal bin. There’s a lesson to be learned from a day in a coal bin, [MASK] knows better than anyone, and she’ll never provoke her father again, not if she can help it.
<name>he</name>	he	Hal	She lay with her lips parted in an all-too-suggestive smile, her tongue flickering inside her mouth like the flame of a gas lamp. Annoyed by her self-sufficiency, [MASK] left her to her dreams and descended the front stairs.
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Boggio	Expose it, represent the living animal exactly, capture all its virulent madness, and perhaps the madness can be resisted. [MASK] loves the natural world; fears it; hates it; believes himself to be, even in his self-acknowledged madness, a prophet.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Lore	The odd stillness gives the impression that the occupants have fled in panic, taking nothing with them but the clothes on their backs. [MASK] enters through the backdoor, emerging from the pantry into the kitchen, where steam rises from the stove’s hot-water reservoir and a pot of soup simmers unattended.
<name>Ornithologist</name>	Ornithologist	Boggio	[MASK] measures the wingspan, the tarsus, the claws and head, and in his haste he records the measurements right on the table. He pants lightly, as though he were overheated. And there is the problem with his fingers again—their rebellion.
<name>Kino</name>	Kino	Boggio	There is laughter everywhere tonight—in the orchard, by the spring, on the lake. [MASK] is alone. But being alone he can do such things as scratch the private place where the sweat tickles him. Being alone he can fart to his heart’s content.
<name>friend</name>	friend	Peg	Maybe ahead of you is a lifetime of service in one form or another, and it doesn’t make much difference whether you push on or turn back. Don’t worry, [MASK]—your doubt is as old as the story that you’re living.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Ellen	The outline of his ribs. His heart beating next to her ear. They lie together without speaking, drowsy and content. Maybe they even sleep for a short while—[MASK] can’t tell whether she rises from the depths of bliss or sleep.
<name>Blackwater</name>	Blackwater	Craxton	How to do justice. How to represent life in precise detail. A job has never stumped him so thoroughly. For lack of anything better, he spends the afternoons in an old hut that he has claimed as his bird blind, overlooking [MASK]’s marsh.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Peg	He’s relieved that he’s stumped his audience with the problem, but he’s also embarrassed by his outburst. From the corner of the room comes [MASK]’s voice, gently condescending. “It’s so simple.” “What?”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Peg	[MASK] folds her arms. Her bitterness is so pronounced she appears smug when she says, “Pm not good enough?” “You don’t understand.” “Your goddamn reputation.” “Do you really believe that I can introduce you to my family—like, like some stray cat
<name>his father</name>	his father	Boggio	He isn’t supposed to understand—he knows this much, at least. His mother chose to keep it from him: the meaning of a name. For the first time in years, [MASK] begins to cry. It is a pleasant sort of sadness, rich with meaning.
<name>him</name>	him	Junket	He will remember loving her. So far the winter has been like any other, perhaps harsher than most, which suits [MASK] just fine. He dreads spring and its erratic thaws and rain and waxy green shoots that smell like rotting meat. And summer.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Boggio	The snow has begun to fall again, and with every step [MASK] pushes through an ice curtain that melts upon his face. A quarter mile away lies his hut, built a century earlier, according to local history, by a farmer to house his mad wife.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Junket	[MASK]’s smile flattens, and his eyes widen in humiliation, asking, How can you do this to me? The boy’s face, she senses right away, is one of those images that will remain in full detail in the front of her mind, easily recovered.
<name>Melanie</name>	Melanie	Boggio	The tip of her nose was cold against his neck. But such bliss couldn’t last—sure enough, the nurse returned, her fingernails scratching his skin as she reached for him. Not yet, [MASK] pleaded.
<name>Marion</name>	Marion	Lilian	That was that. I lost a fortune to him over the years.” “What shall we play?” [MASK] slouches back in her armchair in an explicit display of boredom. “I’ll teach you a game of patience, if you’re interested.”
<name>Laura</name>	Laura	Peg	So of course [MASK] wants just the opposite. She wants to be a modern girl, whatever that means— she’s not sure, but she imagines city streets at night, bathtubs full of champagne, rooms thick with cigarette smoke, couples necking in dark hallways.
<name>Cornelius</name>	Cornelius	Lore	Hah! That shut them up, for the time being. Outside, Indian summer fills the air with a ghostly sort of warmth, soothing and foreboding at the same time. [MASK]’s muscles bunch into hard knots of strength as he lifts a full bushel.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Boggio	[MASK] wonders how it began: as a dance, perhaps. Women danced, men beat stones, but the madness didn’t yield, so the people made arrows and ploughs and inflicted the first injuries upon the earth, and then upon each other.
<name>she</name>	she	Ellen	She is too diligent, too responsible. What are all these animals doing out, anyway? Only now does [MASK] notice the invasion, and her mood, temporarily foul, brightens at the sight of the macaw poised to snatch a nut from the center of the moose hoof.
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Hal	Good riddance. Better to be alone than to be compromised by an uneducated, penniless widow, a domestic servant no less. That she would give up so much because of one little transgression suggests to [MASK] that she didn’t understand the extent of his sacrifice.
<name>Dante</name>	Dante	Lore	[MASK] pushing into her, lifting, gently pulsing. The feeling has no center, instead travels through her in twisting, spiraling currents. She raises her hips to draw him deeper and watches the compression of love on his face, his mouth silently shaping a single word.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Hal	Please see to it that my son has enough to eat. Later, [MASK], you can tell me all about your travels, and we’ll attend to financial matters—I’d prefer to get this out of the way tonight, if you don’t mind.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Junket	There was one game in particular that lasted through a summer, though it had promised to go on forever. Every day the floor of [MASK]’s bedroom would collapse, and they’d fall into a different world, where rocks could sing or trees grew five hundred miles high or people were made of glass.
<name>she</name>	she	Ellen	She is like a woman recovering from a high fever, and in her weakened state her oldest memories return to her with false yet convincing clarity. Now [MASK] sees her own seven-year-old self squatting on a pebble beach, the muscles of her legs invisible beneath the smooth flesh.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Peg	During the day he splits logs and transports wood from the shed to the house, he carries buckets full of kitchen slops, he helps his father skin and gut his game, all the while remaining within view of the Manikin, just in case [MASK] is watching from her third-floor window.
<name>Abigail</name>	Abigail	Sylva	The old furnace stood in the same place, the ash door open to reveal the pit where the grates had been. The boiler lay on its side. The wooden boxes used by [MASK] to store apples and potatoes remained exactly where she’d left them.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Lore	As though to settle the dispute, [MASK] heaves his boot down on the branch, breaking through the last wedge of wood and sending it crashing to the ground. With it the pain from his molar bursts and spreads like a thick, warm liquid behind the surface of his skin.
<name>her</name>	her	Peg	He’s inept on his own. The idea of solitude fills him more with terror than with pride these days. So he indulges the desire that he should be forbidding himself, tries to twist it into hindsight. He will love [MASK] in a future memory.
<name>The mother</name>	The mother	Sylva	Yet no matter what she does, the pain destroys resolve. The great squeeze of pain. Insides churning, tightening, forcing a grunt from her throat. And then the subsidence. Blessed peace between spasms. The child may rest. [MASK] may rest.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Sylva	The thick pine table has absorbed the scent of onions and cloves and the bread that [MASK] bakes twice weekly. The huge cast-iron stove radiates enough warmth to moisten foreheads with sweat. Copper pots hanging from the ceiling wear skirts of black where the flames have licked against their sides.
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Junket	This land is no wilderness, it is a preserve, sugared and boiled down like plums into jam. After only two years in the field, [MASK] is well on his way to becoming a master hunter. So what? It is a simple game, systematic and regulated.
<name>Rapunzel</name>	Rapunzel	Peg	She has considered it before, but never so impulsively—the temptation to have a look at her daughter’s diary is stronger than ever this morning. [MASK] is her only daughter, after all, her own flesh and blood, and has fallen under a witch’s spell.
<name>Turtle</name>	Turtle	Birds	[MASK] used it now—bitterns that darted in and out like flies. They ate wild plums and blackberries and whatever fish they could catch with their hands. Once when she was hungry she said, “I’ll eat you!” and sank her teeth into his arm.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Peg	There’s [MASK] in the kitchen gobbling a sandwich, nose pink and wet after a romp outside. She’s a lovely sight to her mother, bursting with life. Still a child in many ways. So what if she’s strong-willed?
<name>Maribel</name>	Maribel	Peg	But [MASK] is more eager than skilled. She hasn’t been trained to ease out of the kitchen by slowly pushing the door open with her hip, and the creak and whistle of the swinging door breaks into the quiet.
<name>him</name>	him	Lore	But even more than that he fears them. Their bitterness is like a dog scratching at the crate where a convict hides—inside [MASK] is a dangerous, explosive emotion, his own secret rage, which he doesn’t dare let out.
<name>Chinaski</name>	Chinaski	Boggio	Madness. Wildness. [MASK] is the sanest of all because he understands what is happening. The sky laughs and spits; his fingers tremble. Wildness will undo the work of mankind in one agonizing fit. Death will follow.
<name>he</name>	he	Lore	And though [MASK] has always treated nature more generously than his father would have liked, in his present mood he regrets every breath that he let dissipate into the air. He should have taken his father’s advice to heart. The natural world is a lovely adversary whose beauty may never be trusted.
<name>Flora</name>	Flora	Ellen	He had stared at her and she at him for what must have been a full minute. And then he’d gone wild, heaving the giant turtle onto its back, and seizing a walking stick from the hall stand, swinging it over his head. [MASK] almost tumbled headfirst out of her chair.
<name>Strider</name>	Strider	Lore	Keep to the road, [MASK] would remind you. Go slowly, but don’t sit down to rest. Always travel with two boxes of matches—one in your pocket, one in your sack. A gun.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Ellen	She thought the scream was a raccoon’s, though she took it as an omen for the day. “There will be trouble before sunset, [MASK],” she muttered later, when she had her arms around the housekeeper’s neck and was lifting herself onto the bedpan.
<name>her</name>	her	Junket	“Whatcha thinking?” he asked gently, settling on the ground beside her. She threw a pebble into the pond. In the darkness, it seemed to [MASK] that the water swelled into the shape of a hand that reached up and grabbed the pebble.
<name>June</name>	June	Ellen	His palm is wide, thickened with calluses, slightly damp in the center yet with a smooth surface like sanded plaster. [MASK] waits for him to go on, to fill the room with the noise of his voice and drown out the pounding in her ears.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Peg	“How should I know!” she says laughing, unable to suppress the coquettish lilt in her own voice. She touches her cheek, as though to feel the inevitable blush. “It is [MASK]’s fault,” she insists, impassioned by embarrassment.
<name>Mr. Spencer</name>	Mr. Spencer	Boggio	Instead, the library fills with hissed commands. “Go away,” they are telling him, “you don’t belong here, leave us, go on, get out.” He feels the hard grip of an old man’s fingers around his wrist. [MASK]’s fingers.
<name>Dickon</name>	Dickon	Sid	The gardener [MASK], inexplicably! He came out of the library a quarter of an hour later—he said he’d been sworn to secrecy, and if ordinarily secrets weren’t safe with him, on this occasion pride kept him tight-lipped.
<name>Mrs. Danvers</name>	Mrs. Danvers	Ellen	Passionate about his trophies, and passionately bitter. He’s as much an expert at what he does as [MASK] is at housekeeping—more so, perhaps, if you equate intensity with genius. But his belief that he’s been cheated threatens to corrupt him entirely.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Ellen	And here [MASK] is in a woolen dress, plaid, with a high collar and sleeves that end in lace ruffles, not an elegant dress by most standards and not even her best dress, but her favorite—and she has put it on for him.
<name>Beauty</name>	Beauty	Lore	He is at that age just before his prime, when elegance struggles to subdue awkwardness, and the ungainly body works to collect itself into a powerful unity. What do you want? [MASK] should shake him to stir his senses awake. What do you want?
<name>Dolores</name>	Dolores	Ellen	[MASK] understands the impulse—when you’re young, you want to believe that life’s a steady climb to a flat-topped summit. But too often disappointment cancels out the bliss of hope, so a woman’s ambitions should be modest.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Lore	Sage, mint, basil, and worm-wort spread in luxuriant tangles in the rock garden, the daylilies alongside the creek grow five feet high, and tender puffballs spring up in [MASK]’s footprints in the mud, as though the earth were proving its love for him.
<name>Carson</name>	Carson	Peg	I’m certain you’d enjoy a turn with one of the other girls. But I’m a bit weary on my feet. So if you’ll excuse me—” “[MASK], sit down.” “At your service, ma’am.” “Please.
<name>Bertha</name>	Bertha	Ellen	Neither has had much experience with parties. [MASK] doesn’t know where to begin, and when she finally does manage to open a jar of herring roe, the formidable task of preparation absorbs her so completely that she forgets what the party is all about.
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Peg	But you never belonged to the woods, [MASK]. You were born to be a city girl, and now you’re merely fulfilling your destiny. A poignant scene. You imagine the silent movie of your life: a bundled girl making her way up the drive, disappearing into the storm.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Peg?—that	It could be—have you ever thought of this, [MASK] from the beginning your mother didn’t trust you, not because of who you are but because of what she has suffered. She has lost almost everything—you are all she has left.
<name>God</name>	God	Derrick	Finally she flung open the door and motioned me inside. She stood so close to me when she spoke again that I could feel her breath on my face. “You want to see [MASK]?” she asked, throwing out the question to taunt me, apparently.
<name>Why</name>	Why	Peg	The only thing left is to fill in the cause. “[MASK]? What’s wrong? Why are you looking at me like that?” “Why? Why, she says! Why!” “What’s the matter?”
<name>he</name>	he	Ellen	He glances at her, [MASK] smiles again, and he nudges her skirt up and nibbles the wedge of muscle on the inside of her thigh. She gives a little start, then settles into her pleasure and begins running her fingers through his hair, absently unbending the tight curls.
<name>Ennis</name>	Ennis	Junket	He leans back on his heels, and the snow crunches beneath his boots. He remembers how the cold of the lake nearly killed him when he went in after [MASK]’s Maynard. The liquid cold of a blizzard can kill too, with more finesse.
<name>Ospreys</name>	Ospreys	Otters	Quackgrass. Feathergrass. Cattails. Who lives here? Dabbling ducks. Swamp rabbits. Brown trout. Beavers. Muskrats. [MASK]. Beech and birch and spruce. No slurring sound of conversation, no smell of kerosene hanging in the damp air.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Hal	A thaumaturge come to make things right? If it’s anyone else, tell him to go away. [MASK] rises from his chair to greet his visitor, discovers that he is more than a little unsteady on his feet, and holds an armrest to regain his balance.
<name>Marceline</name>	Marceline	Peg	As [MASK] lets her hand drag through the water she asks herself whether she’ll miss her home after she leaves, forgetting for a moment that she has no home. A housekeeper’s daughter cannot call her mother’s place of employment home. Her mother.
<name>Lena</name>	Lena	Ellen	In that split second he catches sight of [MASK], who is twisting in her seat to watch him, and he thinks of a skiff again, imagines that he has just pushed her out to sea against her will.
<name>her</name>	her	Sylva	She’d found out soon enough—the next time she tried to let out a scream, the midwife put that rag-roll between her lips and yanked both ends tight, and all that came out of [MASK]’s mouth was a tiny scratching noise, like a lame dog coming up a gravel path.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Ellen	[MASK] has to admit it to herself, if to no one else, that she hates this necessary stage of cleaning, when she’s imprinted with the dirt she’s worked so hard to remove, when she’s unspeakably filthy from the contact.
<name>he</name>	he	Ellen	“God’s sake!” he says, and [MASK] prepares for a torrent of angry words. God’s sake, woman, do you have to sneak around here like a criminal? Who do you think you are making me jump out of my skin like that!
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Sylva	Nothing else to do but stretch out on the floor and pull the blanket of moonlight up to his chin. It is a night fit for profound mysteries, and [MASK] is stumbling along a woodland path, trying to make sense of the mystery of her pain.
