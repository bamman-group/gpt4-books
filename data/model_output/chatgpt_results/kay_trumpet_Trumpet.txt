<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Colman	[MASK] interrupts. ‘Don’t bother with this him/her bullshit. That’s bollocks, man. Just say him.’ ‘But it’s important that we remember that “he” was a “she” first.’ ‘Tell me about it!
<name>He</name>	He	Colman	[MASK] looks at his watch. It is 12.00. He is not hungry. He is in no fit state to eat at a time like this. He tries to think about what he is going to say. Why didn’t he learn it off by heart?
<name>Christopher</name>	Christopher	Colman	His eyes close like he sleeping. My daddy finish and people clap. Clap, clap, clap. I stands on my chair and claps too. I have on a sailor suit. I just gets it. My mummy says, Sit down, [MASK].
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Joss	As tor/ She wouldn’t take her mother’s good advice. We dance around the room, [MASK] kissing me and singing at the same time. Had to go and lose at the As tor, at the As tor last night. We make love on the living room floor.
<name>Fury</name> (The name is already given in the passage)	Fury (The name is already given in the passage)	Joss	Fury. I pluck up the courage to ask, ‘Are you angry with me?’ ‘What do you think?’ He’s getting himself dressed violently, pulling on his trousers, tying the belt too tight. ‘Where are you going, [MASK]?’
<name>you</name>	you	Cole	Yes, [MASK], you could have been a Barnardo boy. Or one of them poor sods that’s been abused by those psychos in care. Let’s face it, a pal of mine said, adoption is a lucky dip. Lucky you ended up where you did.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Aye	She spoke with a weird accent, quaint and unauthentic, the way you might expect a woman on a tin of shortbread to speak if she came to life. She said [MASK] a lot. And dinny. And tatties. Only she pronounced tatties ‘tauties’.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Joss	I really should eat. My body is getting thinner. My clothes are half falling off me. Just over a month ago, my life was full of certain things I was going to do. [MASK] had a new tour.
<name>Beyoncé</name>	Beyoncé	Millie	‘What do you think of it, [MASK]? Do you think it looks good. Do I look good?’ He can’t believe his luck. He has a wife and he has an album. He can’t contain his excitement at his own success.
<name>George</name>	George	Joss	We wouldn’t know that anyway.’ ‘What would we say was our reason for adopting?’ I ask. ‘We’d say you’ve had a hysterectomy,’ [MASK] says. ‘No, we’ll say your sperm count is too low!’
<name>John</name> (referring to John Lennon)	John (referring to John Lennon)	Joss	I could never write my version of our life. I don’t know what I’d say. I used to find the amount of publicity that [MASK] created terrifying. I hated the constant interviews, the articles about his life and music in the newspapers and magazines.
<name>Ellison</name>	Ellison	Colman	Where's the story?’) The stories in the blues. All blues are stories. Our stories, his father said, our history. You can’t understand the history of slavery without knowing about the slave songs. [MASK] doesn’t feel as if he has a history.
<name>Christine</name>	Christine	Holding	Small enough to have remained hidden beneath those bandages. The nipples were dark plum colour. [MASK] had a strange feeling staring at those breasts that was difficult for him to articulate to himself. It was as if they knew they had hardly been seen by anybody.
<name>Lucky</name>	Lucky	Colman	My mother always called me [MASK]. I didn’t ask to be adopted. Why should I be grateful to anybody. I was born under a sleeping star. Somebody wasn't paying no attention. Some people get all the luck. There were guys like that at my school.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Maryland	[MASK]. The Moody Men are in their element, changing music all the time. Well, all right, OK, you win. I’m in love with you. Well, all right, OK, you win, baby, what can I do?
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Colman	‘Our book.’ Alone in my hotel room, I go over and over [MASK] in my mind. Strip him bare. Picture his back completely bare, his arse, his thighs, the inside of his thighs, his balls, his cock.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Joss	The last few days of his life keep replaying in front of my eyes, like a film. Like a special bit in a film that you watch over and over again. I can’t stop it playing. [MASK] stares at me. He isn’t trying to speak.
<name>his grandfather</name>	his grandfather	Angus	His father and him and [MASK] on the old rowing boat. Waiting for the line to bite and tug, opening his tin of maggots, or his tin of fresh bait, attaching floats and flies to his line, choosing hooks.
<name>him</name>	him	Sundays	I curl myself into him and he holds me, rocking me back and forth, telling me he loves me again and again. He is smiling. Full of himself. I am weak. I am totally and utterly loved. I like [MASK].
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Maggie	[MASK] can see the girl look at the cleanliness of her home out of the corner of her eye. Too late now to tell her to go home and stop wasting her time. Anyway, it’s not every day she has a journalist in her front room.
<name>me</name>	me	Josephine	Perhaps she went away abroad for a while. Perhaps she’s been awful busy. Why won’t she come and visit like she used to? Nobody knows her like [MASK] knew her. And if nobody knows you how can you be yourself?
<name>Jan Morris</name>	Jan Morris	May	A very pretty girl. Beautiful teeth. Lovely smile. The morning of the journalist, [MASK] got up early, seven-thirty, washed, dressed, black and white checked trousers, green shirt. Not bad for seventy, she thought to herself. Wearing well.
<name>she</name>	she	Maggie	Tell me what you had for breakfast.’ ‘Well, I don’t eat breakfast,’ [MASK] says, suddenly shy, like the tape is some kind of camera snapping her. Her voice has become self-conscious. She can’t stop it.
<name>him</name>	him	Albert	Knows the many differences of the dead. Can tell more about those distinguished, idiosyncratic personalities than he can about the cause of death. It is the character of the dead that fascinates [MASK]. Astounding, how much he can tell instantly.
<name>Mr. Gatz</name>	Mr. Gatz	Colman	If only he’d never gone to the funeral parlour. It wouldn’t have made any difference, I suppose. Somebody was bound to tell. When [MASK] came he started behaving in a way I had never witnessed: he became super efficient, organized, understanding.
<name>God</name>	God	Joss	[MASK] has forsaken me. I dry my hands and pour the water down the sink. I must remember things. I look out of the kitchen window. It has been raining. Tiny beads of rain have been painted on the window pane when I wasn’t looking.
<name>Bix</name>	Bix	Moody	You just need to mention [MASK] and people think of the trumpet man that turned out to be a woman. In fact if my father had wanted immortality, he couldn’t have connived a more cunning plan. This one puts the tin lid on it.
<name>Miss Brodie</name>	Miss Brodie	Edith	And if nobody knows you how can you be yourself? [MASK] could be somebody different every day and most probably nobody would notice. Even her doctor wouldn’t notice. He sees that many crabbit old women, he probably gets them all mixed up.
<name>Rhett</name>	Rhett	Joss	Our eyes on each other, till we get there. [MASK] takes me up in his arms and kisses me. Everybody claps and hoots. Then we dance. A circle of people, a human wall, swiftly forms around us. All gamblers’ eyes on us.
<name>Max</name>	Max	Colman	I don’t remember coming in here. But I’m sitting on his low single bed with an old bottle in my hand. An old green glass bottle. [MASK] used to enjoy digging these up by the sea.
<name>the lighthouse</name>	the lighthouse	Kepper	The bus rounds a high tight bend, he is on the other side of the harbour. He can see [MASK] in the distance. His face, close to the bus window. The same old fishing harbour where he spent many many hours as a boy.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	May	‘I know, how we age!’ [MASK] said. ‘It sounds daft, but it’s true. You never think it’s going to happen to you. When you are young, you are invincible.’
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Joss	‘What is it, [MASK], what’s the matter?’ There is something he has to tell me. Something he should have told me ages ago, months ago, but couldn’t. He was afraid that if I knew I would stop seeing him.
<name>The son</name>	The son	Colman	He likes talking about black people and white people and how they do or do not get on. His father liked talking about the past. [MASK] said to him once, why are you always on about the past, old man?
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Colman	I am alone. My friends don’t know how to talk to me or write to me any more. They are embarrassed, confused, shocked. Perhaps angry. I don’t know. Perhaps they are angry like [MASK] is angry. I don’t know.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Joss	He told me he was too ashamed to go out. I never imagined that people could make such a fuss. I know now why they call reporters hounds. I feel hounded, hunted. Pity the fox. [MASK]’s holiday clothes are all here.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Moody	They were his babies. The big bang and the wee tom-toms. He got them all to practise drumnastics until he got so out of hand [MASK] told him to cool down or split. He was in danger of nabbing the limelight.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name in the given context)	unknown (There is no proper name in the given context)	Colman	‘No can do. Sorry, mate, [MASK].’ I grab it and screw it into a ball, a tight paper ball. I aim it at the waste paper basket. Bastard. Fucking bastard. I turn the tap on in the bathroom.
<name>the receptionist</name>	the receptionist	Bruce	‘Can you tell her I’m coming to see her on my own. My bus gets in at four-twenty.’ ‘Rightio, no problem,’ [MASK] said. ‘Thanks, make sure you tell her I’ll be on my own, will you?’
<name>Elvis</name>	Elvis	Joss	When the band finishes everybody cheers us and makes lewd noises. [MASK] throws his arms in the air, dramatically and then bows. The Moody Men start up again with ‘Ain’t Misbehavin’’. I spot some people singing into their partners’ shoulders.
<name>Candace</name>	Candace	May	She remembered the traumatic day the rich family of teeth moved into the bottom part of her house. They were sly impostors, more suave and glitzy than her re^l top lot. Those silly sparkling teeth, all ready for the ball, made [MASK] realize that her husband didn’t love her.
<name>John</name>	John	Joss	I leave the Savage shop with my meat in a plastic bag. I feel it, all soft and squidgy, against my leg. I walk up the main street with the sea behind me. The Lair bus stops and a man gets off who looks the double of [MASK].
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Joss	My weak placid father. I actually found my mother interesting when listening to her conversations with [MASK]. I heard stories I’d never heard before; or I heard stories I’d heard many times, but now suddenly they were entertaining, fascinating. I couldn’t understand it.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Edith	These days, awake or asleep, she returns to that house. The past is so vivid; the present is so dull. At six in the morning, the daylight arrives at last. [MASK] has watched it coming for some time. She gets up thankfully.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Joss	There’s an empty vase on the table by the window. We’d usually fill it with scabious, cornflowers, campions. I should have brought some flowers. This morning before I opened that second letter, I found an old note in [MASK]’s handwriting.
<name>Dad</name>	Dad	Bob	[MASK] laughed one of those knowing adult laughs and exchanged a look with my mother. She looked away then, disgusted and sometimes she’d raise her hands as if to say, ‘I can’t do anything with him.’ I’m not proud of all that now.
<name>Elvis</name>	Elvis	Sammy	I remember talking some crap about [MASK]. You can run, but you can’t hide. I’d discount a lot of that as junk. I think it’s better to start all over again. From the top.
<name>the woman</name>	the woman	Maggie	‘A woman of course. It’s in the paper. Will I bring it round?’ The next thing was a woman from the Daily Sky newspaper asking if she could come to interview her. [MASK] said there was no way she was going to talk about her employers.
<name>he</name>	he	Colman	You have a visitor here.’ This is not how [MASK] had imagined it happening. This public meeting. He had imagined her behind the door, calling out first, then cautiously opening it, inch by suspicious inch.
<name>Edie</name>	Edie	Joss	(Well, I don’t know if [MASK] had a so-called ‘three piece suit’ or not; but I’ve read about that somewhere.) Wild! It will do. She might have stuffed socks down her knickers, who knows?
<name>she</name>	she	Joss	He wants to know what [MASK] died of. Butchers do not shy away from grisly details. He wants the meat. He hopes it wasn’t painful. This is a question not a statement. His voice goes up at the end and he is waiting.
<name>Trainspotting</name>	Trainspotting	Josephine	A bunch of injection needles in his hand, pointed and thin as a hairline. ‘I'm going to have to inject you. Be a good girl.’ [MASK] struggles, wriggling and squirming on the motorway, crawling across the M8 like an injured animal.
<name>John</name>	John	Colman	[MASK] never flies unless he has to. Since he read that the majority of air disasters take place either in the three minutes of the plane taking off or landing, he has found take-offs unbearable. The sick moment when you are at the wrong angle completely to the earth.
<name>Elvis</name>	Elvis	Sammy	The door to their bedroom was always shut. Tight. And I was probably a bit relieved. I never pulled it off. Just as well. Imagine if I’d been confronted with a big frigging mound of venus. My parents liked [MASK].
<name>Ignatius</name>	Ignatius	Sophie	‘You wouldn’t know a moral if it slapped you in the face,’ he says, trying for something better. ‘I don’t see what is immoral about doing this book,’ [MASK] says, and burps. ‘Yeah, right.
<name>Harper</name>	Harper	Colman	At the time of the second letter, [MASK] seemed less sure of the visit. He told me his mother would never cooperate with such a book in a month of Sundays. Then he wondered for a moment what a month of Sundays would actually be like.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Colman	Your father died an hour or so ago, [MASK], I say. Can you please come round? I don’t know what I would have done without him. He came round, quite soon I think. But he didn’t want to see his father.
<name>her</name>	her	Colman	When the love came it was molten, hot, rushing forth out of all the guilt. I didn’t know I was capable of feeling violence at all before I had [MASK]; I didn’t know I had it in me. It is a real plot.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Colman	So [MASK] just walked out. It made him angry. He felt angry at every fucker. He didn’t like any of the other couriers anyway. They could all go to fuck. A new name and a new job, that’s what he’d like.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Joss	Friends of mine who [MASK] has not yet met come up and say, ‘Where did you find him? Quite a catch.’ Another one says, ‘I’d watch him. The handsome ones have roving eyes.’
<name>The Sandman</name>	The Sandman	Angus	He puts her back in her brown sleeping bag and strokes the rough manilla flat. He has a song in his head, the same song his father sang to sing him to sleep. Dreams to sell. Dreams to sell. [MASK] is waiting with dreams to sell.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Colman	It gives us some privacy. ‘Oh, and [MASK]? Remember you told me you had a letter from your father? Well, I think it will help the book. If you don’t want to read it, I will. Bring it tomorrow.’
<name>He</name>	He	Consumed	He is angry to do this. [MASK]. I can see him as a wee boy, three or so, having a tantrum, screaming an ear-piercing, high-pitched scream, stamping on my feet, collapsing his legs like a peace protester.
<name>they</name>	they	Josephine	He’d been here for a long time as I remember. Even if I’d been told the name, I wouldn’t remember. I’ve always been hopeless at names. He died when [MASK] was quite young, eleven or so.’ ‘He died!’
<name>he</name>	he	Joss	I feel pain in the exact place [MASK] complained of for months. A stabbing pain on my left side. We couldn’t die of the same thing? There’s a film I watched once, Double Indemnity, where the guy is telling his story into a tape, dying and breathless.
<name>darling</name>	darling	Agatha	I laugh, ‘You are just jealous, [MASK].’ I laugh heartily to myself. Quite a catch. At three in the morning we tumble out of the party and get driven to my flat. We don’t have the money for a honeymoon.
<name>him</name>	him	Joss	‘I’m going to ask your mother to dance,’ he says. ‘Break the ice.’ I stare at them for a second. I have to stop myself laughing. My mother dancing with [MASK] is quite a picture. If she only knew.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Joss	But I do now. Because in our room as [MASK] was dying, I could feel two of him there. One was the ill person, lying on his bed, constantly making clacking sounds with his dry mouth, opening and closing it, trying to make it moist.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Colman	How can he have it on at a time like this when he knows his father is dying? I hold on waiting for the bleep that everyone tells you to wait for. When it comes it frightens me, it is so loud and thoughtless. I say, [MASK]?
<name>he</name>	he	Colman	But so what if it’s not the truth exactly. He told a lie, didn’t he? His whole life was a fucking lie. What does it matter if [MASK] himself changes things a bit? He’s getting paid for it.
<name>Unknown</name>	Unknown	May	‘So they said.’ ‘Yes, but where about?’ [MASK] shrugged and laughed. ‘How am I to know that? He’d been here for a long time as I remember. Even if I’d been told the name, I wouldn’t remember.
<name>Arizona</name>	Arizona	Miss	‘You’d have a ball here. It’s terrific. The views are colossal. [MASK] you like mad. If you could only just get up in the air and come and see me right now, I’d tell you a thing or two.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Joss	It can take your life. Why in heavens name won’t you call a doctor in? I wanted her to go, just leave me to tend him. [MASK] would never see a doctor. One doctor’s visit could ruin our lives.
<name>he</name>	he	Colman	But the one further down says occupied as well. Maybe he’s in that one. Just as [MASK] is about to go back to his seat, the man comes out the john. It is not his father. Of course it is not his fucking father.
<name>him</name>	him	Colman	Utterly brilliant. I will propose it to him. Later, after a bottle of good wine and a good dinner. We could try that Thai tonight. He might be surprised I’m still speaking to him. I’ll miss [MASK] when we finish this book.
<name>Partner</name>	Partner	Joss	Now this imaginary baby is in both of our heads, wreaking havoc, having tantrums. [MASK] gives me a cold look that cuts through me. It is awful to see cold looks on your loved one’s face. I feel like I’m in a nightmare.
<name>He</name>	He	Colman	[MASK] looks at her blankly. (She has a great weakness for the word objectives. As soon as she says it she can start writing, but not before.) ‘Right,’ she says, happily. ‘Objectives. What are our objectives?
<name>someone</name>	someone	Colman	All this must have taken a very long time. I put a fresh sheet over him and another blanket. I would call the doctor, the undertaker, get him moved soon; but first I had to tell [MASK]. I wanted to wash my hands now.
<name>John</name>	John	Joss	Get a Celtic band as well. [MASK]’s funeral wasn’t right. Maybe that’s what I will do sometime, but not now. I can’t face the people right now. I can’t stand to see the look on their faces.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Stone	HOUSE AND HOME Her hand on the envelope. Third letter. Being blackmailed must feel like this. The sight of [MASK]’s white envelope makes me sink, as if the floor of my house has turned to marshland for a moment.
<name>he</name>	he	Joss	I had to get away from them so that [MASK] could get some peace. He didn’t get a proper night’s sleep for days before he died: he was in and out of sleep, fretful, snapping awake and dropping off, like a baby.
<name>The man's name is not given in the passage.</name>	The man's name is not given in the passage.	Holding	There was nothing particularly unusual about the death. The man had had a fear of hospitals and had died at home, being cared for more than adequately by his devoted wife. [MASK] sat down for his morning cup of tea.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Joss	Late afternoon, [MASK] returns and announces quite unexpectedly that if wanting a baby so badly is making me unhappy, I can have one. He says it as if it is a simple matter of going down to a shop and buying one, like you would a puppy.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Joss	[MASK] knows it. I like the world of these jazz places he has been taking me to. I like the smoke, the drink, the belief. It is an ‘in’ world. I always feel like I’ve been taken somewhere out of myself.
<name>Marianne</name>	Marianne	Edith	[MASK] has told him to walk to the Clock where he’ll find the cab office. She said it is quicker than phoning one. He is glad of the walk, of the night air. How could his father have stopped seeing her? What a waste.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Joss	I wake to [MASK] kissing me, lightly on my cheeks. His lips just brush my cheeks, patiently over and over again. His hands move up my body and across my chest. I stare at him. He has that look on his face.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Colman	His story is blowing in the wind. He lets it rip. He tears himself apart. He explodes. Then he brings himself back. Slowly, slowly, piecing himself together. SEX Since his father died, [MASK] has not seen any of his friends.
<name>Edmund</name>	Edmund	Holding	Unwrapping him. [MASK]’s hands are cool. His breath hot. His fingers are tough at the edges. He can see him bent over the table he will lie on. Cold, soft, bare. He can see the pine drape. The pad of stiffs.
<name>John</name>	John	Joss	Once, I came out of my house and at least ten of them were waiting, two days after [MASK]’s funeral. I was still in a daze. I didn’t react quickly enough. I couldn’t find cover. I couldn’t hide.
<name>Dad</name>	Dad	Joss	She hardly saw [MASK]. He was on the road, I’d explain, always doing gigs to make ends meet. My mother didn’t approve. Why can’t he get a proper job? she’d say. This is no life for you.
<name>Mrs. Dalloway</name>	Mrs. Dalloway	Joss	[MASK] liked to ‘keep me nice’. I put my coat on and go out. I don’t lock the door. I’ve never locked the door here and I’m not starting now. I will walk for a while until the shops open, along the coast.
<name>He</name>	He	Colman	This public meeting. He had imagined her behind the door, calling out first, then cautiously opening it, inch by suspicious inch. [MASK] half thinks of just running off at top speed. Let the old folks watch him run.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Cole	We liked writing it down on windows, notebooks, bus stops, toilets, bedsteads; we were a team. An item.) ‘[MASK], I think your father’s really attractive. He’s so gentle, so different from other men.’
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Holding	Still spends a small portion of every day at her grave. She is at peace, he knows. Lucky to have a son in the profession, to get a little special treatment, to land on her feet. [MASK] is rarely shocked. Never gasps.
<name>Rachel</name>	Rachel	Helen	We don’t have the money for a honeymoon. We didn’t have the money to get a house together. My mother’s given us her old double bed; it’s time I had a single, she said. [MASK] my flatmate has moved out.
<name>Moody</name>	Moody	Holding	‘By all means,’ [MASK] said, playing for time, ‘I will take you through to see your father, but there is something I want to say to you first.’ ‘Can’t it wait?’ the young Mr Moody said.
<name>him</name>	him	Joss	After they took away his body, I felt [MASK] desperate for peace. He still hasn’t been given his proper death. The one everyone expects - a good send-off. His funeral won’t have helped; he wouldn’t have been satisfied with that funeral.
<name>the son</name>	the son	Bruce	It seems as if his very soul is quaking. ‘Could be any of us at any moment,’ [MASK] the son says. I ask after his father. He tells me his father is poorly and has become a vegetarian. ‘What about you?’
<name>Jimmy</name>	Jimmy	Ewan	And the mother’s voice saying again and again, ‘[MASK], I’m not going to tell you again.’ A man’s voice behind him says, ‘I’m telling you. If it wisnae fir me the place wid have been ransacked.
<name>Her</name>	Her	Rapid	He smiles to himself and pulls open the mini bar. The thought occurs to him that she might guess he’s in hiding and come right up to his door and rap on it. [MASK] little knocks. What then? He’s made himself into a hostage.
