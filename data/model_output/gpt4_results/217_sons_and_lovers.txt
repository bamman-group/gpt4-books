<name>Tom</name>	Tom	William	No one spoke. After a while he threw his boots under the table and went to bed. “Why didn't you let me have a go at him?” said [MASK], when his father was upstairs. “I could easily have beaten him.”
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Fanny	“It wasn't ME who wanted him to play with the machine,” she said. As a rule, when all the girls came back at two o'clock, he ran upstairs to [MASK], the hunchback, in the finishing-off room.
<name>the boy</name>	the boy	Paul	“Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep.” “She says you're to go to sleep,” the father repeated gently to [MASK]. “Well, I want HER to come,” insisted the boy.
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Miriam	She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man. [MASK] did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the others went to the “Coons”.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Paul	[MASK] looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared among the young currant-bushes. “Come here!” she cried. “What for?” he answered. “Come and see.” She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
<name>He</name>	He	Annie	“A little,” she replied plaintively. And he would put some water with it, so that it should not nourish her. Yet he loved her more than his own life. She had morphia every night, and her heart got fitful. [MASK] slept beside her.
<name>She</name>	She	Miriam	She could not forgive him. [MASK] killed the joy and the warmth in him. He had been such a jolly lad, and full of the warmest affection; now he grew colder, more and more irritable and gloomy.
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Miriam	Now it was the same again. And she could do nothing for him. He had to go on alone, make his own way. He continued faithful to [MASK]. For one day he had loved her utterly. But it never came again.
<name>Ernest</name>	Ernest	Paul	But [MASK] was dying for the man to know they were expecting someone by the London train: it sounded so grand. Yet he was much too much scared of broaching any man, let alone one in a peaked cap, to dare to ask.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Paul	[MASK] never forgot, after one of these fierce internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly, between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird. And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
<name>Tim</name>	Tim	Paul	she exclaimed. “How much was the cheque?” “Ten pounds eleven,” said [MASK] irritably. He dreaded what was coming. “And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an' his club this week! But I know him.
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Miriam	He was more or less under her spell again. As usual, they were discussing the sermon. He was setting now full sail towards Agnosticism, but such a religious Agnosticism that [MASK] did not suffer so badly. They were at the Renan Vie de Jesus stage.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Paul	But [MASK] was going to distinguish himself. She had a great belief in him, the more because he was unaware of his own powers. There was so much to come out of him. Life for her was rich with promise. She was to see herself fulfilled.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Barker	“Did you have that flannel singlet made?” “Not yet,” he smiled. “Then, why didn't you?” she cried. “It'll come,” he smiled. “Ah, an' Doomsday!” exclaimed [MASK].
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Clara	[MASK] had always been “ikey”, reserved, and superior. She had never mixed with the girls as one of themselves. If she had occasion to find fault, she did it coolly and with perfect politeness, which the defaulter felt to be a bigger insult than crassness.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Miriam	He looked down again to [MASK]. “Clouds are on fire,” he said. “Beautiful!” she cried. She seemed so small, so soft, so tender, down there. He threw a handful of cherries at her. She was startled and frightened.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Morel	“And when does he handle th' money?” asked the collier. “That I couldn't tell you. When the picture is sent home, I suppose.” There was silence. [MASK] stared at the sugar-basin instead of eating his dinner.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Paul	“And what was the matter with you?” asked [MASK] of his mother. “I suppose it's my heart,” she replied. Certainly she looked bluish round the mouth. “And have you felt it before?” “Yes--often enough.”
<name>Emmeline</name>	Emmeline	Clara	Don't you listen to her. She's for ever on that 'igh horse of hers, an' it's back's that thin an' starved it'll cut her in two one of these days.” [MASK] suffered badly from her mother.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Paul	[MASK] would go in in the early morning, when his sister got up. His mother was wasted and almost ashen in the morning with the morphia. Darker and darker grew her eyes, all pupil, with the torture. In the mornings the weariness and ache were too much to bear.
<name>Jarge</name>	Jarge	Walter	Arena ter for gi'ein' me one for my bit of a lad an' wench?' 'I ham, [MASK], my lad,' 'e says; 'ta'e which on 'em ter's a mind.' An' so I took one, an' thanked 'im.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Morel	“Oh--an' what's agate now?” “He's only enlisted.” [MASK] put down his knife and leaned back in his chair. “Nay,” he said, “that he niver 'as!”
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Miriam	The whole family loved a “take-off” more than anything. He took no notice of [MASK]. Later, she saw him remark her new blouse, saw that the artist approved, but it won from him not a spark of warmth.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Miriam	He helped his mother to get the tea ready. [MASK] would have gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home. There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction. The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old.
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Edgar	Now she felt there was really something hostile between them, something of which they were ashamed. She ate her cake mechanically. He tried to go on with his argument, but could not get back the right note. Soon [MASK] came in.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Miriam	“Yes,” replied [MASK] in her musical tone. “She's reading.” He wheeled his bicycle into the barn. He had put on a handsome tie, of which he was rather proud, and socks to match. “She came this morning?”
<name>Mag</name>	Mag	Annie	He was not home again until a quarter to eleven. His mother was seated in the rocking-chair. [MASK], with a rope of hair hanging down her back, remained sitting on a low stool before the fire, her elbows on her knees, gloomily.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Paul	The smoke floated softly up. “I believe she wants you,” said [MASK]. “Do you?” replied the other, soft, satirical, abstract. “Yes. She never really hitched on to me--you were always there in the background.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Fanny	“I'm going to look,” he said. He opened his eyes. [MASK], her long cheeks flushed, her blue eyes shining, was gazing at him. There was a little bundle of paint-tubes on the bench before him. He turned pale.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Miriam	but this did not occur to him. They were silent. There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with [MASK]. She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it.
<name>She</name>	She	Morel	There were two days' holiday. On the Tuesday morning [MASK] rose early. He was in good spirits. Quite early, before six o'clock, she heard him whistling away to himself downstairs. He had a pleasant way of whistling, lively and musical.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Miriam	She was walking with a rather striking woman, blonde, with a sullen expression, and a defiant carriage. It was strange how [MASK], in her bowed, meditative bearing, looked dwarfed beside this woman with the handsome shoulders.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Dawes	[MASK] turned over suddenly with a startled grunt. “Eh?” “Caw!” she mocked. “He can only say 'Caw!' I have brought you a gentleman to see you. Now say 'Thank you,' and show some manners.”
<name>Alfred</name>	Alfred	Morel	“Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy, who's drunk, I sh'd like ter know?” said [MASK]. He was extraordinarily pleased with himself, because of his day's helping to wait in the Moon and Stars. He chattered on.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Annie	She regretted what they had been--so small and exquisite. And when [MASK] insisted on her having more stylish blouses to suit her age, she submitted. She even went so far as to allow a black velvet bow to be placed on her hair.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Paul	She seemed to be asleep. He stepped softly backwards and forwards at his painting. Suddenly her small voice wailed: “Don't walk about, [MASK].” He looked round. Her eyes, like dark bubbles in her face, were looking at him.
<name>Boots</name>	Boots	Minnie	“You shall see, my pigeon! You see if you're not swanky one of these days!” “I'm quite content, my boy,” she smiled. “But you'll have to alter. Look at you with [MASK]!”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Paul	Then she closed her eyes, giving herself up again in a kiss. She acted of her own free will. What she would do she did, and made nobody responsible. [MASK] felt life changing around him. The conditions of youth were gone.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Clara	“And would YOU let a WOMAN do as she likes?” “Yes; I'll see that she likes to love me. If she doesn't--well, I don't hold her.” “If you were as wonderful as you say--,” replied [MASK].
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Morel	So 'e wor that mad, 'e cossed an' 'e swore, an' t'other chaps they did laugh.” [MASK] was a good mimic. He imitated the manager's fat, squeaky voice, with its attempt at good English.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Miriam	he asked. “Yes; they are very fine,” replied [MASK]. “Which sort do you like best?” he asked. “I don't know. The bronze, I think.” “I don't think you've seen all the sorts.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Arthur	And then, if they were impudent, he said quietly: “Do you mind going on with your work,” and stood and watched. When he celebrated his twenty-third birthday, the house was in trouble. [MASK] was just going to be married.
<name>Ernest</name>	Ernest	Paul	“You know how be carries on and says he's never told anything.” “All right,” said [MASK]. But he would almost rather have forfeited the prize than have to tell his father. “I've won a prize in a competition, dad,” he said.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	William	“My new black SUEDE.” “No.” There was a hunt. She had lost them. “Look here, mother,” said [MASK], “that's the fourth pair she's lost since Christmas--at five shillings a pair!”
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Paul	She'll last through to-morrow.” “I don't think so.” “Yes. Go to work.” The miner looked at her again, in fear, and went obediently out of the room. [MASK] saw the tape of his garters swinging against his legs.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Miriam	[MASK] heard her greet the lad gaily, knew exactly how brilliant her grey eyes became with that tone. She herself would have felt it bold to have greeted him in such wise. Yet there she stood under the self-accusation of wanting him, tied to that stake of torture.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Morel	As they came out and went along the railway, with the sunny autumn field on one side and a wall of trucks on the other, [MASK] said in a frightened voice: “'E's niver gone, child?” “Yes.” “When wor't?”
<name>James</name>	James	Morel	They sat down again helplessly. Again came the great, snoring breath. Again they hung suspended. Again it was given back, long and harsh. The sound, so irregular, at such wide intervals, sounded through the house. [MASK], in his room, slept on.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Liberty	[MASK]'s had taken several of his painted designs on various stuffs, and he could sell designs for embroideries, for altar-cloths, and similar things, in one or two places. It was not very much he made at present, but he might extend it.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Miriam	“Ought I to send this letter?--I doubt it. But there--it is best to understand. Au revoir.” [MASK] read this letter twice, after which she sealed it up. A year later she broke the seal to show her mother the letter.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Clara	I wished she was sitting comfortably in peace--” “'Darning her husband's stockings,'” said [MASK] scathingly. “I'm sure she wouldn't mind darning even my stockings,” he said. “And I'm sure she'd do them well.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Miriam	[MASK] followed, breathing the fragrance. To her, flowers appealed with such strength she felt she must make them part of herself. When she bent and breathed a flower, it was as if she and the flower were loving each other.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Morel	A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures, its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment [MASK] came in.
<name>Heyst</name>	Heyst	Clara	said [MASK], too frightened to speak. “And she looks at me, and she wants to stay with me,” he went on monotonously. “She's got such a will, it seems as if she would never go--never!”
<name>Ursula</name>	Ursula	Miriam	But [MASK] almost fiercely wished she were a man. And yet she hated men at the same time. “But it's as well to be a woman as a man,” he said, frowning. “Ha! Is it? Men have everything.”
<name>Ursula</name>	Ursula	Annie	Yet he, too, knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously. And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much. Yet to [MASK] he said: “Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Miriam	He would never have got so far in the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family. But now they condescended to listen. [MASK] sat on the sofa absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him, when he was present.
