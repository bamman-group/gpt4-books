<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Jimmy	“There’s no reason to get worked up, [MASK]. You asked me a question and I answered it.” “Now, just shut up a minute. Here’s the deal. I’m not getting worked up, okay? I’ve been worked up since this afternoon.
<name>Catalina</name>	Catalina	Miles	but he was determined to practice every day, even if only by throwing himself pop flies on the beach. Besides, his mother admitted she’d never been there herself so [MASK] harbored a secret hope they’d be surprised by what they found there.
<name>Salinger</name>	Salinger	Honus	One afternoon not long after [MASK], then deep into his seventies, had suffered a minor stroke and was released against his will into the care of his wife, he got up from a chair too quickly and, suddenly feeling woozy, grabbed on to the nearest piece of furniture to steady himself.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Janine	One of his favorite expressions was “You know, a smart man might just...” and then he’d explain just what a smart man might do. In the beginning [MASK] imagined these statements were actually connected in some way to his intentions.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Charlene	She wants us all right here. Or me, at least.” [MASK] shook her head. “I don’t understand.” “I do,” he said, meeting her eye. “It took a while, but I do.”
<name>Da Vinci</name>	Da Vinci	Tick	To [MASK] it seems as though his arm, wrist, hand, fingers and brush are all an extension of his eye, or perhaps his will. When he does make a mistake, he just chuckles and says, “Never mind.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	True”—she	“[MASK] chuckled—“and I just explained why. At any rate he was no more foolish than most men, I suppose, and yet you’ll never guess what he was up to when I met him. He was actually engaged in altering the flow of this very river.
<name>her</name>	her	Janine	Her afternoon aerobics class was just shy of half an hour away, if she could last that long. For [MASK], late afternoon was always the worst part of the day, the stretch she couldn’t handle alone, which was the only reason she visited her mother, who drove her nuts.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Janine	“Like I said, Ma,” [MASK] replied, grabbing the last of the napkins, “you’re just jealous, so let’s drop it before one of us says something they’ll regret, okay?”
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Max	[MASK], with a face almost beatific, delivered this lesson as if to suggest he meant the whole thing as a compliment, causing the officer to knit his brow in confusion. He was almost sure he was being insulted, but not quite.
<name>the boy</name>	the boy	Jimmy	“We would’ve scored again if we got the damn ball back.” “That’s for sure,” [MASK] agreed. “And they were all done scoring on you.” “That they were,” the boy said proudly.
<name>Mr. Bingley</name>	Mr. Bingley	Otto	[MASK] had not himself gone into either the attic or the cellar, of course, but even taking into account that there was no light in the house to search by, it had taken a very long time to ascertain officially what everyone seemed to know from the beginning.
<name>They</name>	They	Pm	Was this what criminals in the Witness Protection Program felt like when they were recognized on the street by a former associate? “Pve been trying to reach you for days. [MASK] afraid you’d better come home. ” Just that quickly, everything in his life changed.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Miles	“Sorry,” [MASK] told her, drawing his child to him, feeling the smile spread across his face at her nearness, at her confidence in his ability to dispel the bad magic of old pop groups. Not that she was a child anymore, not really.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Miles	Still, I’m sorry he said what he did. I have no idea where he comes up with such things. He probably doesn’t even remember your mother.” [MASK] forced himself to consider this possibility. True, the old man’s mind was gone.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Miles	“Dear, dear [MASK].” So, back to climbing and reclimbing the bleachers for another long hour, his failure of imagination even more disheartening than the endless ascent. At least, he told himself, in the bleachers they were both clothed.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Miles	Granted, there were men you wanted to sleep with, some men because they got you all hot and bothered, but others, like [MASK], you just kind of wanted to do something nice for because they were decent and deserved it
<name>he</name>	he	Walt	The problem though, she had to admit, was that [MASK] wouldn’t commit either to doing or not doing much of anything. The secret of his success, he was fond of reminding her, was keeping all his options open.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Tick	“I’m just thinking how . . . nice it would be for that boy to know there’s somebody his own age who doesn’t...” Consider him a maggot, [MASK] thinks, since completing the sentence isn’t all that hard.
<name>they</name>	they	Miles	I’m the one who has to leave work to deal with it, not you.” “I’m not sure that’s fair,” [MASK] said. “I wish they would call me. If you’d let me have primary custody—” “Right.
<name>Max</name>	Max	Bea	This impulse never lasted long, though, so you had to take advantage swiftly. xMax had been offering [MASK] opportunities to insult him all night long, but until this very moment she’d resisted, which meant she hadn’t owed him anything and his glass had remained dry.
<name>Abby</name>	Abby	Bea	As if he hadn’t been keeping the biggest damn secret of all from her. But the real reason for hauling [MASK] along to the game was so that for once she could be the solution to a problem instead of its source.
<name>he</name>	he	Candace	She hasn’t forgotten his kindness the afternoon that [MASK] sliced her thumb open with the Exacto knife, and she hasn’t forgotten that she repaid his kindness and concern with duplicity by slipping the knife into her backpack, where it has remained ever since.
<name>Biff</name>	Biff	David	Regarding their father, [MASK] was unsentimental. “You’re right not to let him on any ladders, though. Don’t let him con you into feeling sorry for him.” “I’ll try. But he’s pretty good at getting to me.
<name>he</name>	he	Miles	Which was true, and when [MASK] didti ’t deny it, he added, “Plus she likes you. Better than anybody." “That's the worst part," he admitted, meeting his friend's eye. “No.
<name>me</name>	me	Miles	She continued staring at her reflection, as if meeting his eye would amount to some terrible admission. When she finally did, there were tears, and it occurred to [MASK] that there might be something she wasn’t telling him. Something she wasn’t sure of herself.
<name>anyone</name>	anyone	Miles	At which her eyes teared up, causing him to apologize as she wept gently onto his shoulder, convincing onlookers that what they were witnessing went well beyond touching. It was damned inspirational. Even the Silver Fox himself got misty-eyed. These sudden tears on the dance floor had not taken [MASK] by surprise.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Miles	“It wouldn’t kill you to eat something.” “That’s where you’re mistaken, [MASK]. That’s exactly what it would do. I’m not going to be fat again, not ever.”
<name>him</name>	him	Miles	“You’re not skulking off without one last dance,” she said, her face flushed, and she dragged [MASK] out to the middle of the floor. The band, determined to have equally deafening music fill the room even in their absence, was playing recorded music through their guitar amplifiers.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Miles	It was going to last a long time, which was a good thing. He wasn't to fidget or scratch. He hadn 't even been allowed to bring his mitt along. [MASK] had to admit that he'd never seen his mother look more beautiful than she did tonight.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Aliles	“I’ll be good at keeping secrets. If I cheated on my husband, nobody would ever know.” [MASK] opened his mouth, then shut it again, wondering as he often did if there was another sixteen-year-old like this one anywhere else in the world.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Miles	“I was asleep. In this dream ... she was hurt...” Her voice relented a little. “I’m sure she’s fine, [MASK]. Her deadline is midnight. She’ll be home soon.” “Call me anyway?” he asked.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Bea	Then he’d tell you to your face he thought you’d left. If [MASK] would spring for a big-screen TV, they argued, they wouldn’t all have to crowd within a foot of one another.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Miles	Upstairs? Move the pallets of ffvolator grease down to the basement to make a little room for her?” “You have a point,” [MASK] said, trying to keep the bitterness out of his voice. “I am left without a house in all this.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Miles	“You missed one hell of a party.” What [MASK] had heard was that after he left, his ex-wife had danced several strong men into a state of exhaustion, got very drunk, and then berated the band when they finally quit and began packing up their instruments.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Miles	“Well, then,” she said, as if that settled the matter. In the men’s room [MASK] examined the five swollen, painful blisters he managed to give his right hand during the course of the afternoon.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Miles	“[MASK] and me go way back, but for some reason it embarrasses him that we were friends. He always feels better after making a joke or two at my expense. Which I don’t mind—not one or two, anyway.
<name>he</name>	he	Miles	The only other car [MASK] had driven was the driver's ed vehicle, which was underpowered by design, so he was greatly surprised when the Lincoln leapt forward beneath his foot like a suddenly uncaged animal. When he instinctively let off the gas, she barked, “No!
<name>Francie</name>	Francie	Miles	On what had once been a tidy, middle-class street, theirs and the Minty place next door were the first houses to prefigure the deterioration of the whole neighborhood. [MASK]’s father, though a sometime house painter, had been disinclined to paint any house he himself happened to be living in.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Miles	[MASK] was going through the picnic basket. The instant she told him not to worry, he’d taken her advice and quit. “There’s a lot more stuff today,” he informed her, holding up a small jar of what appeared to be inky little ball bearings.
<name>he</name>	he	Miles	“Don’t I think what?” “I said it’s about time our luck changed around here.” “It sure is,” [MASK] agreed. Assuming it’s luck that’s the problem, of course. Which he privately doubted.
<name>Miles</name>	Miles	Miles	She’ll be the next manager of the Empire Grill.” “Over my dead body,” [MASK] said. His brother got to his feet and smiled, clearly having seen this coming. “Good. Now we’ve come full circle.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Zack	“Don’t pretend you don’t know who I’m talking to. Turn around.” The boy rotates in his chair without looking at them. As always, he studies the floor. “That’s better,” [MASK] says.
<name>Hope</name>	Hope	Zack	“It just makes me really angry that you won’t give me another chance,” he blurts out. They’ve had this conversation before, of course. [MASK] believes fervently, devoutly, in second chances. Also third and fourth chances.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	David	“It is my business, [MASK],” he said, feeling a lifetime’s worth of resentment welling up dangerously. Every time he allowed himself to imagine that his brother had finally turned the corner, that ingrained irresponsibility would surface again.
<name>perhaps</name>	perhaps	Charlie	But he did want her. He was almost sure of it. His bride-to-be had other thoughts. “That would be a fine place for a gazebo, [MASK], ” she observed, indicating with her thin index finger a spot halfway down the bank.
<name>he</name>	he	Miles	What [MASK] took from this knowledge was mostly relief, and when he spoke he was aware of something new either in or behind his voice, a new attitude, sort of. “You don't know that, ” he told his father.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	John	Nothing. “You aren’t mad at me now, are you? About that quarter? That was a shitty thing, [MASK], I admit. We’re still buddies, though, right?” Again, nothing.
<name>he</name>	he	Minty	Something about the combination of innocence and urgency in his question suggested the latter stages of intoxication, though the policeman displayed none of the other symptoms. It was as if [MASK] had posed the question in his mind all those years ago and hadn’t had the opportunity to ask it until now.
<name>Augustus</name>	Augustus	Max	“You don’t have the cancer, do you?” “No, just a kid. Some people worry about them.” “You think you can hurt my feelings, but you can’t,” [MASK] assured him, not for the first time.
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Miles	Then, after a moment, “I wonder what will become of her?” “Hard to say. Some of these beautiful old churches are being bought up and renovated into community theaters, art centers, things like that.” “I don’t think that would work here,” [MASK] said.
<name>he</name>	he	Miles	Even more troubling was his suspicion that “okay” was designed specifically as a conversation stopper, employed in hopes that the person who’d asked the question would simply go away. The trick, [MASK] had learned, was not to go away.
<name>John</name>	John	Zack	Crouching low, they crept along the treeline toward the dilapidated house in the pale fight of an almost full moon. In the car, [MASK] had doubted both his purpose and his resolve, but being on his feet and moving made him feel strong and sure.
<name>Miles</name>	Miles	Miles	“I’d have to run you through the Hobart first,” [MASK] told him. “Rinse some of the crumbs out of your beard. You don’t seem to understand that people come into the Empire Grill to eat, and you’re a walking appetite suppressant.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Walt	Not that she was a child anymore, not really. “Did you hear them on the radio?” “No,” she admitted. “They’re his fault.” Meaning [MASK]. And with this accusation she pulled away from her father and grabbed an apron.
<name>The narrator</name>	The narrator	Tick	He’s eating what looks like tuna fish from a plastic container; whatever it is, its odor is particularly strong. [MASK] herself is well on her way to becoming a vegetarian, and most meat and fish smell rancid to her.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	David	[MASK], who had to prep and serve Mexican Night at the grill this evening, had spent most of the afternoon setting up accounts with distributors and doing whatever tasks could be managed by a man with one good hand.
<name>Stan</name>	Stan	Miles	“People like you are the reason other people get answering machines to begin with,” [MASK] told him. “In fact, people like you are driving a lot of modem technology.” “Ml I wanted was enough money to get down to the Keys.
<name>She</name>	She	Tick	Even sheltered from the worst of the wind, it was still cold—and getting dark too, though it wasn’t yet four o’clock. Still, coming here had been a good idea. [MASK] could feel her spirits gradually picking up.
<name>the son</name>	the son	Miles	“Butyou have to promise to wear that white dress again. ” His mother had put on sunglasses and rolled onto her back. “It's the only one I have. ” She laughed, and [MASK] could feel his anger returning.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Buster	“No more double shifts,” [MASK] said. Though his eye had cleared up almost completely, he looked like a man who’d spent every last nickel of his strength and energy. “You want to go home?”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Miles	“The lucky few who happen actually to know what they want are said to have will -power." “That’s all it takes?” “Well, let’s call it a necessary beginning.” [MASK] allowed himself to settle into his chair.
<name>Delilah</name>	Delilah	Janine	He only had to look at her to know that. And not just any kid, either—his kid. His, far more than [MASK]’s, never mind what the court said. His kid to adore and to protect for a while yet.
<name>he</name>	he	Miles	Given the man she intends to mam- she ought to be cold all the way up to her barrettes.” “I don’t think women wear those anymore, do they?” It’d been so long since [MASK] had loosened a woman’s hair that he’d lost track.
<name>Hank</name>	Hank	Miles	“[MASK], you’re a true Manichaean. You seek out Mass in the morning and your friend’s wife’s tan line in the afternoon. Anyway, what is it they do again?” “Write television sitcoms.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Tick	Now do you get it?” He’s finished his lunch by now, the smell of it still thick in the air between them. When his eyes pause again on [MASK]’s half-eaten sandwich, she says, “I can’t finish this.
<name>Darry</name>	Darry	Jimmy	He was just about through taking it himself, actually. “I won’t be late.” “You wreck that Camaro, I’m not going to give a good goddamn whose fault it was,” [MASK] said, feeling the need for one last warning.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Miles	She gripped the biceps of his left arm with both hands and said, “Dear [MASK],” just as she had last night in his dream. “There’s not a soul on earth I’d rather be with.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Cindy	He’d vowed at the time that if it turned out there was life after death he certainly wouldn’t linger around his hole in the ground waiting for visitors. “I put flowers on your mother’s grave, too,” [MASK] continued. “I always do.
<name>George</name>	George	David	[MASK] was just anxious that they not part angry. His question was designed to restore the usual equilibrium. “I’ll see if I can hunt him down tomorrow.” “We’re going to need another waitress and busboy, too.” “I know.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Candace	And, as was often the case, talking to [MASK] buoyed her spirits, though she did wonder if the mere fact that somebody was worse off than you was a proper basis for friendship. Both girls were silent for a while, listening to the water slide by at their feet.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Horace	[MASK] polished some hamburger grease into the countertop with his napkin before cutting the deck. “You should live so long. Hell, I should live so long,” he said, watching the deal, content to wait until he had his whole hand before picking up any cards.
<name>he</name>	he	Miles	Though [MASK] could have done without the pitying tone, he was moved to consider the possibility that his ex-wife appeared, somewhat belatedly, to imagine the possibility that he might be lonely. “She’s working, actually.” “So you give her the damn night off.
<name>his own name</name>	his own name	Charlie	Strange. Had anyone else called him [MASK], he'd have corrected that person before his or her voice had a chance to fall, but for some reason, with this woman whom he had asked on bended knee to be his bride, he'd delayed.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Max	[MASK] crossed his legs and stared out the window, the sprung door of the glove box resting on his knee. He contented himself with this view for about a minute, then pulled out the real-estate guide again.
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	David	Three afternoons, actually.” “You didn’t let him near the register, I hope?” Their father could not be trusted around money, though Aides and [MASK] had argued for years about the boundaries of his dishonesty.
<name>She</name>	She	Charlene	“It’s not a person’s fault if they’re not hungry.” [MASK] pushed the plate back in front of her. “Yes, it is,” she said. “That’s exactly whose fault it is.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Tick	“Go easy. He’s trying. He just doesn’t know how to ... be around you.” “He could try being dead.” “[MASK].” “Why can’t you just go ahead and admit how much you hate him?”
<name>John</name>	John	Miles	I’m sure she paid him for his time.” “Works for her how, exactly?” [MASK] asked. “Different ways. He looks after the house when she travels. He helped her put in a security system. Keeps an eye on the old factories.”
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Tick	“And wash your hands.” “Wash my hands so I can bus dirty dishes?” The back room was thick with steam, and [MASK] was stacking dishes when her father and grandfather entered. “How’s it going, darlin’?”
<name>George</name>	George	Miles	For instance, I’d wager you have no idea why you married.” [MASK] nodded. “You mean you’d bet if you could find somebody to bet with.” “So you admit you have no idea!” she cried. “Lovely.
<name>her</name>	her	Miles	Since the accident, though, all this seemed to matter less, though it troubled [MASK] that their newfound intimacy seemed to depend on their having so little to say to each other. They passed the baton of the restaurant back and forth with an almost effortless minimum of talk.
<name>his father</name>	his father	Miles	“I may be sempty,” his father continued without missing a beat, “but I can still climb like a monkey.” Back to painting the church again. The old man was nimble, [MASK] had to admit, both of foot and of conversation.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Miles	she objects to, it’s me. She probably thinks I’m trying to get her fired.” “Are you?” “Teachers can’t be fired unless they molest their students,” [MASK] told her.
<name>He</name>	He	Justin	What I’m saying is, he’s so fucking stupid he doesn’t even get the rush.” [MASK] didn’t look convinced. “Anyway, fuck you. You don’t play, you don’t get to criticize.” “I played once.
<name>John</name>	John	Craig	She’s not sure, for instance, if the boy is really in jail. Or if he exists at all. Or if the other boy, [MASK], ever really promised to buy her The Beatles Anthology. Vagaries of this sort make it hard to give good advice.
<name>his father</name>	his father	Max	“I borrowed ten dollars,” his father said sheepishly. “I was going to mention it, but you never gave me the chance.” “Right.” “I was,” [MASK] insisted, perhaps truthfully. He did sometimes tell the truth if it suited his purpose.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Max	“Not having a brain.” [MASK] treated this insult the way he treated all insults, by pushing his glass forward for a refill. In his experience, after insulting you, people generally felt guilty. It occurred to them that maybe they were selling you short.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Neuman	Five days a week Airs. [MASK] showed up at one o’clock, a busy time in the exercise room, and did her leisurely stroll on one of the three working treadmills, reading the free magazines and pissing off the members who were interested in real workouts.
<name>the owner</name>	the owner	Miles	While they did need another busboy, hiring a backup fry cook was far more urgent if [MASK] didn’t intend to continue opening the restaurant himself every day of the week, which he’d done now for nearly a month.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Miles	The band, determined to have equally deafening music fill the room even in their absence, was playing recorded music through their guitar amplifiers. To [MASK]’s additional discomfort, almost everyone at the reception stopped and turned to watch them dance.
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Miles	“Maybe you didn’t hear the question?” he finally said. “Have I done something illegal?” Now it was the cop’s turn to fall silent. For a full minute he ignored [MASK], apparently to prove that he too could play this silence game.
<name>Raymond</name>	Raymond	Minty	It’s not like the side of this damn building’s invisible. The idea is to stop before you get to it.” “You need to get a couple of those concrete curbs out there.” [MASK] smiled.
<name>Marion</name>	Marion	Miles	She intended to jump. He was so sure of it that when she didn't, when she walked right past the place where you’d jump if you were going to, [MASK] still couldn ’t banish the idea. Because what other explanation could there be?
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Miles	For direct lineal descendants they didn’t look all that much alike except, [MASK] decided, for one feature. Even as young men, they appeared prematurely old, or maybe just distinguished, their hair white, their brows chiseled in cogitation.
<name>Ex-girlfriend</name>	Ex-girlfriend	Zack	“My old girlfriend is going to explain why she doesn’t like me anymore.” The strangest part of this statement is that it appears heartfelt. [MASK]’s point, if she understands him correctly, is that big, stupid, cruel people have feelings too, and she’s hurt his.
<name>Driver</name>	Driver	Miles	“Okay, ” she said, “floor it. ” [MASK] wasn 't certain he heard her correctly. “You want me to—” “Correct, ” she said. “I don't...” “As in, depress the accelerator all the way to the floor. ”
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Miles	They’d been understaffed again, and [MASK] had said just to leave them soaking, knowing the new boy was coming in early. Besides, Sunday was a short day. The restaurant opened only for breakfast, though so few showed up it was hardly worth the effort.
<name>George</name>	George	Miles	[MASK] couldn’t help smiling. That had long been his own estimate of the situation, but even so he was surprised that his father had come to the same conclusion. “ ’Course, then there would’ve been no you.” “Not a tragedy.”
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Walt	“He’s smarter than you, [MASK],” she’d have liked to tell him. “He’s cheating you by remembering what cards you’ve played and what cards he’s played. That’s how he knows what’s left in the deck.
