<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Thomas	I got out the cuff-link and went with it to the pantry. [MASK] was wiping silver and the air was heavy with tobacco smoke. I sniffed and looked around, but there was no pipe to be seen. "
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Thomas	"I am afraid she is worse to-night," she ventured at last. I put my hand on the sick girl's forehead. It was burning with fever, and I turned to where [MASK] lingered in the hallway.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Gertrude	The strange thing seemed to be his surrendering himself on the point of departure. To me, it seemed the shrewd calculation of a clever rascal. I was not actively antagonistic to [MASK]'s lover, but I meant to be convinced, one way or the other.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Liddy	I had to take [MASK] to her room up-stairs, however,--she was quite sure she would find something uncanny. In fact, when she did not, having now the courage of daylight, she was actually disappointed. Well, we did not go back to town that day.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Halsey	We were the center of action. Of course, there was no time then to voice such an idea. My mind seemed able to hold only one thought: that [MASK] had been foully dealt with, and that every minute lost might be fatal.
<name>Wanamaker</name>	Wanamaker	King	It is a general department store." He was silent after that, but he went to the telephone as soon as we got home, and called up [MASK] and Company, in the city. After a time he got the general manager, and they talked for some time.
<name>Blackie</name>	Blackie	Flinders	The small driver caught my attention at once: he was a beautiful child, and, although he showed traces of recent severe illness, his skin had now the clear transparency of health. "Whoa, [MASK]," he shouted. "You're goin' to smash the trap."
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Halsey	[MASK] bought a car, of course, and I learned how to tie over my bonnet a gray baize veil, and, after a time, never to stop to look at the dogs one has run down. People are apt to be so unpleasant about their dogs.
<name>Heaven</name>	Heaven	Lord	And then he stooped and began punching around the keyhole with the end of a lead-pencil. When he stood up his face was exultant. "It's locked on the inside," he said in a low tone. "There is somebody in there." "[MASK] have mercy!"
<name>Godfrey</name>	Godfrey	Halsey	Altogether, we were a sad-looking trio that gathered around a breakfast that no one could eat. Over a cup of black coffee the detective told us what he had learned of [MASK]'s movements the night before. Up to a certain point the car had made it easy enough to follow him.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Liddy	I am sure I did not faint. I was never more composed in my life. I remember planning, if I were not discovered, who would have my things. I knew [MASK] would want my heliotrope poplin, and she's a fright in lavender.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Gertrude	I was surprised. I waited until she had had time to get almost to the house before I started. And then I stepped back again into the shadows. The reason why [MASK] had not kept her tryst was evident.
<name>Godfrey</name>	Godfrey	Arnold	" "No. Unfortunately, there had been trouble between [MASK] and his father. For two years he had lived in town." "Then it would be unlikely that he came here last night to get possession of anything belonging to him?"
<name>Millicent</name>	Millicent	Gertrude	I ran down the steps and along the drive. Just at the corner I ran full tilt into somebody who seemed to be as much alarmed as I was. It was not until I had recoiled a step or two that I recognized [MASK], and she me.
<name>Mildred</name>	Mildred	Gertrude	Perhaps I was growing suspicious of every one, but it seemed to me that [MASK]'s gaiety was forced and artificial. I watched her covertly during the rest of the drive, and I did not like the two spots of crimson in her pale cheeks.
<name>Hilda</name>	Hilda	Liddy	"The knocking kept up, and just as I was about to call [MASK], she ran through the room and out into the hall. I got up then, feeling weak and dizzy, and put on my dressing-gown.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Halsey	I was vaguely irritated with her; there are few young fellows like [MASK]--straightforward, honest, and willing to sacrifice everything for the one woman. I knew one once, more than thirty years ago, who was like that: he died a long time ago.
<name>John</name>	John	Alex	Another decision I made, and I put it into execution immediately after breakfast. I had one of the unused bedrooms in the east wing, back along the small corridor, prepared for occupancy, and from that time on, [MASK], the gardener, slept there.
<name>John</name>	John	Halsey	"Nonsense!" I said, as briskly as I could. "We are making a lot of trouble out of something perhaps very small. [MASK] was probably late--he is always late. Any moment we may hear the car coming up the road."
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Thomas	With the death of her stepfather and the prospect of the immediate return of the family, things had become more and more impossible. I gathered that [MASK] was as relieved as I at the turn events had taken. No, she did not know of either of the deaths in the family.
<name>Hilda</name>	Hilda	Halsey	I was past that. Just at the foot of the stairs I stubbed my toe against [MASK]'s big chair, and had to stand on one foot in a soundless agony until the pain subsided to a dull ache. And then--I knew I was right.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Liddy	That decided me. If the scraps had anything to do with the mystery ordinary conventions had no value. So [MASK] arranged the scraps, like working out one of the puzzle-pictures children play with, and she did it with much the same eagerness.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Halsey	He came to bring--something." "[MASK]," I cried, "you MUST tell me the whole truth. Every time I see a way for you to escape you block it yourself with this wall of mystery. What did he bring?"
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Liddy	He ran up the stairs two at a time, and his face was flushed and furious. "The whole place is locked," he said angrily. "Where's the laundry key kept?" "It's kept in the door," [MASK] snapped.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Dave	First big fire we've had since the summer house burned over to the club golf links. My wife was sayin' the other day, '[MASK], you might as well 'a' saved the money in that there helmet and shirt.'
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Burns	[MASK] traced him there. We have made guarded inquiry at the Greenwood Club, and through the village. There is absolutely nothing to go on but this. On the embankment above the railroad, at the point where we found the machine, is a small house.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Arnold	"I was wondering why I had not heard from [MASK] since the--since I saw him that night at the lodge. I was afraid he was ill, because--he was to have done something for me, and he had not come back.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Halsey	"Why didn't you trust me, and send for me before?" "It was because I couldn't trust myself," she said in a low tone. "I am too weak to struggle to-day; oh, [MASK], how I have wanted to see you!"
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Halsey	That a houseful of detectives missed it entirely was because they were busy trying to prove that two and two make four. The depression due to my visit to the hospital left me at the prospect of seeing [MASK] again that night.
<name>He</name>	He	Thomas	About his relatives, I have already notified his brother, in the village. It was heart disease, I think. [MASK] always had a bad heart." "Heart disease and fright," I said, still on the edge of my chair.
<name>Godfrey</name>	Godfrey	Halsey	One look was all I needed. It was [MASK]'s revolver. I had unpacked it the day before and put it on his shaving-stand, and there could be no mistake. His name was on a small silver plate on the handle.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Louise	I believe he has a million at least, as the result, and that he will never come back. I'm worse than a pauper now. I can't ask [MASK] to share nothing a year with me and when I think of this disgrace for her, I'm crazy."
<name>FBA</name>	FBA	Lucien	She gave [MASK] a handkerchief and forgot it. It was very fine, black-bordered, and it had three hand-worked letters in the corner--F. B. A." "No," I said with truth enough, "she is not a friend of mine."
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Liddy	In the center was a small ruby. The trinket was odd enough, but not intrinsically of great value. Its interest for me lay in this: [MASK] had found it lying in the top of the hamper which had blocked the east-wing stairs.
<name>Freddie</name>	Freddie	Gertrude	[MASK] seldom loses her presence of mind, and she ran to the telephone. But by the time the Casanova volunteer fire department came toiling up the hill the stable was a furnace, with the Dragon Fly safe but blistered, in the road.
<name>Liddy</name>	Liddy	Liddy	I hardly know how I came to think of the circular staircase and the unguarded door at its foot. [MASK] was putting my clothes into sheets, preparatory to tossing them out the window, when I found her, and I could hardly persuade her to stop.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Louise	Any moment we may hear the car coming up the road." But it did not come. After a half-hour of suspense, [MASK] went out quietly, and did not come back. I hardly knew she was gone until I heard the station hack moving off.
<name>Halsey</name>	Halsey	Gertrude	"Some one has been killed, killed!" "Thieves," I said shortly. "Thank goodness, there are some men in the house to-night." I was getting into my slippers and a bath-robe, and [MASK] with shaking hands was lighting a lamp.
<name>Greenwood</name>	Greenwood	Thomas	Then she slipped upstairs, and threw the revolver out of an upper window, going down again in time to admit the men from the Greenwood Club. If [MASK] had suspected, he had never told. When she found the hand
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Liddy	[MASK]'s gaze had wandered to the door of the chute, now bolted securely. "Not a word," she said, "beyond asking her a question or two, which there was no harm in. She says there never was a ghost known here."
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Gertrude	The children's money was gone: that was bad enough, though I had plenty, if they would let me share. But [MASK]'s grief was beyond any power of mine to comfort; the man she had chosen stood accused of a colossal embezzlement--and even worse.
<name>Godfrey</name>	Godfrey	Warner"--he	She came over and sat down on the bed, and I saw she looked very tired and worn. "Is there anything new?" I asked anxiously. "Nothing. The car is gone, but [MASK] is the chauffeur--"Warner is at the lodge and knows nothing about it."
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Gertrude	At three o'clock in the morning I was roused by a revolver shot. The sound seemed to come from just outside my door. For a moment I could not move. Then--I heard [MASK] stirring in her room, and the next moment she had thrown open the connecting door.
<name>Flora</name>	Flora	Arnold	The knocking had stopped, and I was afraid I was too late. I got to the foot of the staircase and over to the door on to the east veranda. I had never thought of anything but that it was [MASK], until I reached the door.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Gertrude	The machine was temporarily out of commission, and the carriage horses had been sent to a farm for the summer. [MASK] finally got a trap from the Casanova liveryman, and we went out. Just as we turned from the drive into the road we passed a woman.
<name>Griffith</name>	Griffith	Riggs	"Real eggs, real milk, and a touch of real Kentucky whisky," he said. He insisted on carrying it up himself, but at the foot of the stairs he paused. "[MASK] said the plans were drawn for the house," he said, harking back to the old subject.
<name>John</name>	John	Gertrude	[MASK] and I were out, as I have said, and at dinner we both noticed that something had occurred to distract him. He was disagreeable, which is unlike him, nervous, looking at his watch every few minutes, and he ate almost nothing.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Gertrude	[MASK] hesitated. "No," she said finally. "I--I am not nervous, and after I had extinguished the light, I remembered something I had left in the billiard-room, and I felt my way back there through the darkness.
<name>Pauline</name>	Pauline	Louise	That afternoon I had a new insight into the character of the dead banker. I had my first conversation with [MASK]. She sent for me, and against my better judgment I went. There were so many things she could not be told, in her weakened condition, that I dreaded the interview.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Halsey	and I do love--some one else'!" "I can not say that," she breathed, "but, very soon, I shall marry--the other man." I could hear [MASK]'s low triumphant laugh. "I defy him," he said.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Liddy	"I shan't stir a foot." She was equally decided. Then, more lightly: "Why, you and [MASK] need me to arbitrate between you every day in the week." Perhaps I was growing suspicious of every one, but it seemed to me
<name>Liddy</name>	Liddy	Liddy	I was growing more and more nervous. [MASK] had given up all pretense at bravery, and slept regularly in my dressing-room on the couch, with a prayer-book and a game knife from the kitchen under her pillow, thus preparing for both the natural and the supernatural.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Lucien	She was small and fair-haired, just a little bit gray, and very sad. She was in deep mourning, and, I think, when she came, she expected to go at once. But the child, [MASK], interested her.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Liddy	But not another word would she say: she stood gazing down at that gruesome figure on the floor, while [MASK], ashamed of her flight and afraid to come back alone, drove before her three terrified women-servants into the drawing-room, which was as near as any of them would venture.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Halsey	"Taking a walk," I said, trying to be composed. I don't think the answer struck either of us as being ridiculous at the time. "Oh, [MASK], where have you been?" "Let me take you up to the house.
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Warner	At the door he was to force, [MASK] put down his tools and looked at it. Then he turned the handle. Without the slightest difficulty the door opened, revealing the blackness of the drying-room beyond!
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Halsey	[MASK] kissed her tenderly, and I noticed evidences of strain and anxiety in both young faces. "Is everything--right?" she asked. "Right as can be," with forced cheerfulness. I lighted the living-room and we went in there.
<name>Leslie</name>	Leslie	Louise	And when it does, we shall find [MASK] Armstrong a victim." I had not noticed where we were going, but now I saw we were beside the railroad, and from a knot of men standing beside the track I divined that it was here the car had been found.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Gertrude	Rang that bell so hard I hadn't time scarcely to get 'em on." "And--did you see a man who limped?" [MASK] put in, as he stopped for breath. "Not at the train, ma'm," he said.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Liddy	But there were no large pieces of mortar lying around--no bits of lathing. When I mentioned this to [MASK] she merely raised her eyebrows. Being quite confident that the gap was of unholy origin, she did not concern herself with such trifles as a bit of mortar and lath.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Halsey	"Nonsense!" I said briskly. "Why, what would [MASK] do to me if I even ventured such a thing? He is so big and masterful that if I dared to be anything but rapturous over you, he would throw me out of a window.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Winters	He offered it to me for three dollars." "How did you know the watch?" [MASK] snapped at him. "I had seen it before, many times. I used it at night when I was watching at the foot of the staircase."
<name>Halsey</name>	Halsey	Gertrude	"I shall believe that when it is proved," I said grimly. "In the meantime, I take no one on faith. The Inneses never do." [MASK], who had been standing aloof at a window, turned suddenly. "
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Liddy	Apparently only a few minutes elapsed, during which my eyes were becoming accustomed to the darkness. Then I noticed that the windows were reflecting a faint pinkish light, [MASK] noticed it at the same time, and I heard her jump up.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Halsey	" Which was [MASK]'s solicitous care for me, put into vernacular. "I shall stay right here," I said, and crossing the small veranda, now shaded and fragrant with honeysuckle, I hammered the knocker on the door.
<name>Liddy</name>	Liddy	Liddy	We had one peaceful day--then [MASK] took sick in the night. I went in when I heard her groaning, and found her with a hot-water bottle to her face, and her right cheek swollen until it was glassy. "Toothache?"
<name>He</name>	He	Halsey	At the lodge everything was quiet. There was a light in the sitting-room down-stairs, and a faint gleam, as if from a shaded lamp, in one of the upper rooms. [MASK] stopped and examined the lodge with calculating eyes.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Louise	It had been done quietly, and with deliberate purpose. If I had only known how to read the purpose of that gaping aperture what I might have saved in anxiety and mental strain! Why had [MASK] left her people and come home to hide at the lodge?
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Halsey	I give it as she told it. She lay propped in bed, and [MASK] sat beside her, unrebuffed, and held her hand while she talked. "I was not sleeping well," she began, "partly, I think, because I had slept during the afternoon.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Gertrude	"Go down and see him," I instructed [MASK]. "Tell him I am out--for mercy's sake don't say I'm sick. Find out what he wants, and from this time on, instruct the servants that he is not to be admitted.
<name>Snuffles</name>	Snuffles	Liddy	It was for all the world as if something heavy, perhaps a piece of steel, had rolled clattering and jangling down the hard-wood stairs leading to the card-room. In the silence that followed [MASK] stirred and snored again.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Halsey	The maddening thing, however, was that the nightly visitor had evidently more than one way of gaining access to the house, and we made arrangements to redouble our vigilance as to windows and doors that night. [MASK] was inclined to pooh-pooh the whole affair.
<name>Clayton</name>	Clayton	Gertrude	And yet--I will take my oath none of us even inadvertently killed that poor devil." I looked at the closed door into [MASK]'s dressing-room, and lowered my voice. "The same horrible thought keeps recurring to me," I whispered.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Arnold	It was unlocked and opened about an inch. Everything was black: it was perfectly dark outside. I felt very queer and shaky. Then I thought perhaps [MASK] had used his key; he did--strange things sometimes, and I turned around.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Liddy	We ate only when [MASK] brought in a tray, and then very little. The papers, of course, had got hold of the story, and we were besieged by newspaper men. From all over the country false clues came pouring in and raised hopes that crumbled again to nothing.
<name>Georgiana</name>	Georgiana	Thomas	Why, she doesn't know me!" "Fudge!" I snapped, being apt to grow irritable when my sympathies are aroused. "She's doing nothing of the sort,--and don't pinch my arm. If you want something to do, go and choke [MASK]."
<name>Godfrey</name>	Godfrey	Gertrude	"I know nothing of it," he maintained; but I fancied I caught a sudden glance at [MASK], a flash of something that died as it came. As quietly, as calmly as I could, I went over the whole story, from the night
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Liddy	Then, automatically, I got the laudanum and went back to her. It was fully a half-hour before [MASK]'s groans subsided. At intervals I went to the door into the hall and looked out, but I saw and heard nothing suspicious.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Warner	It was filled with gold-topped bottles and brushes, and it breathed opulence, luxury, femininity from every inch of surface. How did it get there? I was still asking myself the question when [MASK] came running down the stairs and into the room.
<name>Radley</name>	Radley	Sunnyside	The stable, being on a hill, was a torch to attract the population from every direction. Rumor had it that [MASK] was burning, and it was amazing how many people threw something over their night-clothes and flew to the conflagration.
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Arnold	She could hear [MASK] fumbling at the lock outside. She slipped down quietly and opened the door: he was inside before she had got back to the stairs. It was quite dark, but she could see his white shirt-bosom. From the fourth step she fired.
<name>Cass</name>	Cass	Watson	it's too skeery fer her, it's too skeery fer me. We had it, then, sho' nuff, and it ended up with Mis' [MASK] stayin' in the lodge nights an' me lookin' fer work at de club."
<name>lady</name>	lady	Walker	No, I want to ask this young [MASK] something." She was curious, I knew, but I did not wait to explain. I went up the walk to the house, where a brass sign at the side announced the office, and went in.
<name>Godfrey</name>	Godfrey	Bailey	Every time I see a way for you to escape you block it yourself with this wall of mystery. What did he bring?" "A telegram--for [MASK]," he said. "It came by special messenger from town, and was--most important.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Louise	"[MASK] told me her mother despised the place. Besides, this is no place for quiet and peace just now. Anyhow, doctor, while I don't care to force an issue, I shall certainly remain here, for a time at least."
<name>Godfrey</name>	Godfrey	Alex	She thought, as I did, that there was little doubt of it. I said nothing to her, however, of the detective's suspicions about [MASK]. Little things that I had not noticed at the time now came back to me.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Halsey	Then we heard [MASK] running up the main staircase. He came quickly down the hall to where we were standing. "There's no one trying to get in. I thought I heard some one shriek. Who was it?" Our stricken faces told him the truth.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Halsey	At this point in my story, [MASK] always says: "Trust a woman to add two and two together, and make six." To which I retort that if two and two plus X make six, then to discover the unknown quantity is the simplest thing in the world.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Rosie	Then [MASK] began to cry--not silently, but noisily, hysterically. I stopped her by giving her a good shake. "What in the world is the matter with you?" I snapped. "Has the day of good common sense gone by!
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Halsey	Suddenly, from the top of the staircase above us came the sound of a cautious footstep. At first I was not sure, but [MASK]'s attitude told me he had heard and was listening. The step, slow, measured, infinitely cautious, was nearer now.
<name>Bromley</name>	Bromley	King	--I wish she would pay this week's board." "Did she say what store it was?" "No, sir, but all the boy's clothes came from [MASK]'s. He has far too fine clothes for the country."
<name>Travers</name>	Travers	Halsey	[MASK] prowled up and down the entire east wing, now in the card-room, now in the billiard-room, and now and then blowing his clouds of tobacco smoke among the pink and gold hangings of the drawing-room.
<name>Inspector</name>	Inspector	Gertrude	Whether I want to or not, I find myself looking for the few I know by name, and feeling ridiculously new and small by contrast--always an unpleasant sensation. After [MASK] joined us, we avoided any further mention of the murder.
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Thomas	And then [MASK] motioned to a partly open door, and I went in. The lodge boasted three bedrooms up-stairs, all comfortably furnished. In this one, the largest and airiest, a night lamp was burning, and by its light I could make out a plain white metal bed.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Alex	[MASK] was awake and running down the stairs, and in five minutes from the time the fire was discovered, three of the maids were sitting on their trunks in the drive, although, excepting a few sparks, there was no fire nearer than a hundred yards.
<name>Soames</name>	Soames	Halsey	As before, [MASK] watched the east entry from ten until two. He had an eye to comfort, and he kept vigil in a heavy oak chair, very large and deep. We went up-stairs rather early, and through the open door
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Warner	What have you locked in the laundry?" "I can't wait to explain," I replied. "I must get [MASK] from the lodge. If you came out for air, you'd better put on your overshoes."
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Eliza	He looked daggers at me. And he wanted to know if we would recommend [MASK] as a cook. He has brought a patient, a man, out from town, and is increasing his establishment--that's the way he put it."
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Liddy	Only--and [MASK] always screams and puts her fingers in her ears at this point--only now I was not alone in the chimney room. There was some one else in the darkness, some one who breathed hard, and who was so close I could have touched him with my hand.
<name>Wells</name>	Wells	Rosie	" I ordered, as he hesitated. "And send [MASK] here." He did not go far. He sat on the top step of the stairs, only leaving to telephone for a doctor, and getting in everybody's way in his eagerness to fetch and carry.
