<name>Mrs. Malaprop</name>	Mrs. Malaprop	Flossie	“Ah, but you don’t know [MASK]. She’s a marvel. An archbishop would swear she was his own mother. She gets the voice right every time, and that’s really the principal thing.”
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Tuppence	He’ll want to know how much _you_ know, and where you got your information from, and a lot of other things that you can’t cope with. What are you going to do about it?” [MASK] frowned severely. “We must think.
<name>Mr. Hyde</name>	Mr. Hyde	Whittington	All the geniality had faded out of [MASK]’s face. It was purple with rage, and the veins stood out on the forehead. And behind it all there lurked a sort of incredulous dismay. He leaned forward and hissed savagely: “So that’s your little game, is it?”
<name>Nancy</name>	Nancy	Albert	“We haven’t exactly proved it yet. But we’re after her. And”--she produced a long-drawn-out wink--“I guess she won’t get away with the goods this time.” [MASK] uttered another ejaculation indicative of delight.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Tommy	While they had been together she had never questioned it for a minute. Although she was accustomed to take the lead, and to pride herself on her quick-wittedness, in reality she had relied upon [MASK] more than she realized at the time.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Tuppence	“He suggested advertising for the nurse,” she reminded him. “Yes, with a ‘forlorn hope’ flavour to his voice! No--I’m about fed up. I’ve half a mind to go back to the States right away.” “Oh no!” cried [MASK].
<name>Fritz</name>	Fritz	Tommy	The German turned on her with an oath. “Get out of this. Go to your room!” Very cautiously [MASK] swung himself down the back of the ladder. So long as they did not turn round ... all was well. He crouched behind the cupboard.
<name>Mr. Utterson</name>	Mr. Utterson	Julius	’s reflection she sat down and wrote a note, weighing each word as she did so. Finally she nodded her head as though satisfied, and slipped it into an envelope which she addressed to [MASK]. She went down the passage to his sitting-room and knocked at the door.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Tommy	It’s very awkward.” “I thought as much,” said [MASK] with satisfaction. “How like a woman! No foresight! Now just stand aside, and see how easily the mere male deals with the situation.” He pressed the bell.
<name>Mr. Sutcliffe</name>	Mr. Sutcliffe	Julius	The doctor’s glance came back to [MASK] with a new and subtle quality in it. This was no longer an eccentric young fellow with a habit of falling off trees. The doctor’s eyes held the deference accorded to a really rich man. “Very remarkable plan.
<name>Long John Silver</name>	Long John Silver	Tommy	“A bargain?” The bearded man took him up sharply. “Yes--a bargain. My life and liberty against----” He paused. “Against what?” The group pressed forward. You could have heard a pin drop. Slowly [MASK] spoke.
<name>Lucie</name>	Lucie	Tuppence	She stamped her foot. “Get up, I say.” But [MASK] continued to cling and sob, interjecting her sobs with incoherent appeals for mercy. Every minute gained was to the good. Moreover, as she grovelled, she moved imperceptibly nearer to her objective.
<name>Uncle Podger</name>	Uncle Podger	Conrad	Therefore, why not wait in ambush for [MASK] behind the door, and when he entered bring down a chair, or one of the decrepit pictures, smartly on to his head. One would, of course, be careful not to hit too hard.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Tuppence	“But I think that, in an ambiguous, legal, without prejudishish lawyer’s way, he was trying to warn me.” “Why should he?” “I don’t know,” confessed [MASK]. “But he looked kind, and simply awfully clever.
<name>Tommy's</name>	Tommy's	Jane	How did he get ahead of us? We hustled all we knew. It’s downright impossible for anyone to get here quicker than we did. And, anyway, how did he know? Do you reckon there was a dictaphone in [MASK]’s room?
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Tommy	Pocketing the usual fee of fifty pounds, I rejoin you in the road outside, and we proceed to the next address and repeat the performance.” “Don’t be absurd, [MASK]. Now for the other letter.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tuppence	“I knew you found something,” said [MASK] reproachfully. “To tell you the truth, that’s what started me off suspecting you. Why didn’t you say?” “I guess I was a mite suspicious too. It had been got away from me once,
<name>Mr. Higgins</name>	Mr. Higgins	Tuppence	She’s a-packing up, and she’s just sent down word for me to get her a taxi.” “What?” [MASK] clutched his arm. “It’s the truth, miss. I thought maybe as you didn’t know about it.”
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Tommy	[MASK] assented brazenly. After listening to the porter’s meticulous but perplexing directions, they prepared to leave the station. It was beginning to rain, and they turned up the collars of their coats as they trudged through the slush of the road.
<name>Lady</name>	Lady	Tuppence	How would you like to work for me? All quite unofficial, you know. Expenses paid, and a moderate screw?” [MASK] gazed at him, her lips parted, her eyes growing wider and wider. “What should we have to do?”
<name>Janet</name>	Janet	Tuppence	In about a quarter of an hour the bell rang, and [MASK] repaired to the hall to show the visitor out. He had given her a piercing glance before. Now, as she handed him his hat and stick, she was conscious of his eyes raking her through.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Whittington	Of course, I knew there was no reason why [MASK] should be in that room rather than in any other--less reason, in fact, for the betting would be on his being in one of the reception-rooms downstairs.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Julius	“I went round to his house,” said [MASK]. “I said that I reckoned a car like that was worth every penny of twenty thousand dollars. Then I told him that it was worth just about fifty thousand dollars to me if he’d get out.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Tommy	In five minutes his woes were forgotten. The sound of the key turning in the lock awoke him from his slumbers. Not belonging to the type of hero who is famous for awaking in full possession of his faculties, [MASK] merely blinked at the ceiling and wondered vaguely where he was.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Tommy	“Don’t be a wretch. Aren’t there _any_ answers?” [MASK] shook his head with a deep and somewhat overacted melancholy. “I didn’t want to disappoint you, old thing, by telling you right off. It’s too bad.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Henry	“One thing more. Do you remember what the young lady did with the telegram?” [MASK] gasped and spoke. “She crumpled it up into a ball and threw it into the grate, and made a sort of noise like ‘Whoop!’ sir.”
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Tuppence	I can _feel_ him.” “Sure, [MASK], how could he be? This door’s open into the hall. No one could have come in by the front door without our seeing and hearing him.” “I can’t help it.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Jane	He took a desperate step, trusting in his assumed character to avert suspicion. He nearly succeeded--but not quite.” “I can’t believe it,” murmured [MASK]. “He seemed so splendid.”
<name>Randolph</name>	Randolph	Julius	“The old man was like that,” admitted [MASK]. “But I guess the new generation’s sort of different. Got no use for the family feud business. First thing I thought about, soon as the war was over, was to come along and hunt you up.”
<name>Mr. Hyde</name>	Mr. Hyde	Tommy	The door was shut to again. It was at this juncture that [MASK] lost his head. What he ought to have done, what any sane man would have done, was to remain patiently where he was and wait for his man to come out again.
<name>Santa</name>	Santa	Tuppence	“Do you know how long we’ve been here?” he asked one morning as they sat facing each other at breakfast. “A week! We’re no nearer to finding [MASK], _and next Sunday is the_ 29_th!_” “Shucks!
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Tuppence	Beautiful as she had seemed before, it was as nothing to the loveliness that now went fully adorned. [MASK] had performed her part faithfully. The model gown supplied by a famous dressmaker had been entitled “A tiger lily.”
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Tuppence	[MASK] had no claim to beauty, but there was character and charm in the elfin lines of her little face, with its determined chin and large, wide-apart grey eyes that looked mistily out from under straight, black brows.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Boris	He looked confidently round, and was glad they could not hear the persistent beating of his heart which gave the lie to his words. “No,” admitted [MASK] at last sullenly, “you do not.”
<name>Wilson</name>	Wilson	Tommy	The draft treaty was [MASK]’s bait. Every now and then he was aghast at his own presumption. How dared he think that he had discovered what so many wiser and clever men had overlooked? Nevertheless, he stuck tenaciously to his idea.
<name>Horace</name>	Horace	Tommy	Look here, [MASK], shall we really? Shall we form a business partnership?” “Form a company for the stealing of diamond necklaces?” “That was only an illustration. Let’s have a--what do you call it in book-keeping?”
<name>Lestrade</name>	Lestrade	Tommy	“You’re tying my hands,” complained [MASK]. “It’s a very delicate affair, and the other fellow will muff it up as likely as not, and then where shall I be? I don’t believe one of you has got an ounce of tact.”
<name>Mr. Bingley</name>	Mr. Bingley	Tommy	How was I to know?” “Yes,” [MASK] chimed in. “How was he to know? Don’t blame the poor fellow. His hasty action has given me the pleasure of seeing you all face to face.”
<name>Hermione</name>	Hermione	Julius	It is me they’re after. I’m the one they want. You shall not lose your lives because of me. Let me go.” She was fumbling with the fastenings of the door. [MASK] took her by both arms, and looked at her.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Julius	For a moment the girl fancied she must have dreamt it. But she determined nevertheless to be on the alert. “Well,” said [MASK], “I guess we’d better make a move out of here any way.” The others fell in with his suggestion.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Tuppence	Will you step this way?” He ushered them into a room at the back of the house, furnished as a library. The collection of books was a magnificent one, and [MASK] noticed that all one wall was devoted to works on crime and criminology.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Rita	“Now there’s just a chance, I admit it’s only a chance, that this woman may have been ‘[MASK].’” “And if so?” “If so, we’ve got to hunt through the survivors of the _Lusitania_ till we find her.”
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Tuppence	If this boy is alive, he may have very valuable information to give us. Therefore, we must find him.” “Yes, but how?” cried [MASK]. “I’ve tried to think of everything.”
<name>Christine</name>	Christine	Tommy	“I dare not, monsieur; I am afraid of them.” She turned away. “Wouldn’t you do anything to help another girl?” cried [MASK]. “She’s about your age too. Won’t you save her from their clutches?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tommy	“She’s my cousin, and as patriotic a girl as ever stepped.” “I don’t care a damn what she is, but get out of here!” retorted [MASK] also at the top of his voice. The young men were on the point of coming to blows.
<name>Antoinette</name>	Antoinette	Annette	For a moment he stood rooted to the ground. Then he took it out, shut the drawer, walked slowly over to an arm-chair, and sat down still staring at the photograph in his hand. What on earth was a photograph of the French girl [MASK] doing in
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Tommy	Always I hear that name. It is familiar.” [MASK] came forward eagerly. “You must know _something_ about her?” But the girl turned away abruptly. “I know nothing--only the name.” She walked towards the door.
<name>Louisa</name>	Louisa	Tuppence	“No one would ever think of sentiment in connection with you.” “That’s not very polite,” replied [MASK]. “But I dare say you mean it all right. Well, there it is! I’m ready and willing--but I never meet any rich men!
<name>He</name>	He	Tuppence	“You must let me know if anything further comes to light. Letters will always be forwarded.” [MASK] stared at him blankly. “You are going away?” “I told you. Don’t you remember?
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tommy	[MASK] reflected gloomily that if supper did not arrive soon it would be a question of waiting for breakfast. At ten o’clock hope deserted him, and he flung himself on the bed to seek consolation in sleep. In five minutes his woes were forgotten.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Tuppence	No one--of course! She stooped down and looked under the bed. There was no other possible hiding-place. [MASK] gave her familiar shake of the shoulders. It was absurd, this giving way to nerves! Slowly she went out of the room.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Tommy	“Yes--but look here----” “Leave it to me.” She bent down. To his amazement, [MASK] saw that she was fastening the end of a long piece of string to the handle of a big cracked jug.
<name>Tuppence</name>	Tuppence	Tommy	In this he was completely foiled; they spoke low and the din of the traffic drowned their voices effectually. Just before the Bond Street Tube station they crossed the road, [MASK], unperceived, faithfully at their heels, and entered the big Lyons’.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Tuppence	“Neither of you will leave this room alive! You said just now we had succeeded. _I_ have succeeded! The draft treaty is mine.” His smile grew wider as he looked at [MASK]. “Shall I tell you how it will be?
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Tommy	The girl nodded. [MASK] dropped off the bed and came and inspected the contents of the tray. It consisted of a loaf, some margarine, and a jug of coffee. “The living is not equal to the _Ritz_,” he observed with a sigh.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Tommy	While they was a-running of you out the window opened, and something was chucked out.” He handed a scrap of paper to [MASK]. “It was wrapped round a letterweight.” On the paper were scrawled three words: “To-morrow--same time.”
<name>Inspector</name>	Inspector	Julius	[MASK] was like a hound on the leash. He followed up the slenderest clue. Every car that had passed through the village on the fateful day was tracked down. He forced his way into country properties and submitted the owners of the motors to a searching cross-examination.
<name>Miss Lavish</name>	Miss Lavish	Tuppence	[MASK] beamed upon him. “How lovely. You are kind. I do love money! I’ll keep beautiful accounts of our expenses all debit and credit, and the balance on the right side, and red line drawn sideways with the totals the same at the bottom.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Tuppence	“You don’t know him,” she reiterated hoarsely. “He’s--ah!” With a shriek of terror she sprang to her feet. Her outstretched hand pointed over [MASK]’s head. Then she swayed to the ground in a dead faint.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Albert	She thought a minute or two, then tapped [MASK] on the shoulder. “See here, son, my brain’s got busy. How would it be if you mentioned that you’d got a young cousin, or a friend of yours had, that might suit the place.
<name>Uncle Tom</name>	Uncle Tom	Julius	Then he remembered that there was a good supply in [MASK]’s sitting-room. The American had announced his immediate departure, there would be no fear of running up against him. Besides, he wouldn’t mind if he did.
<name>Abdullah</name>	Abdullah	Tommy	At last that worthy made his appearance. “Well?” cried [MASK] eagerly. “It’s all right. While they was a-running of you out the window opened, and something was chucked out.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tommy	“Gee whiz! You’ve got it! Say, that idea of yours was great. It never occurred to me.” [MASK] held the paper in position some minutes longer until he judged the heat had done its work. Then he withdrew it.
<name>Raffles</name>	Raffles	Julius	Now, if the girl had been placed there it would almost certainly be under an assumed name.” “Bully for you,” cried [MASK]. “I never thought of that!” “It was fairly obvious,” said the other.
<name>The girl</name>	The girl	Tommy	[MASK] was secretly grateful for the information. “But you would help me if you could?” “No, monsieur.” “Why not?” The girl hesitated. “I think--they are my own people. You have spied upon them.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Tommy	Was it possible that this genial, well-known figure could be in reality a dangerous criminal? His life seemed so open and aboveboard. No hint of sinister doings. Suppose it was all a gigantic mistake? [MASK] felt a cold chill at the thought.
<name>pro</name>	pro	Tuppence	She evidently went in deadly terror of her mistress. The girl thought it probable that the other woman had some hold over her. For the rest, she cooked like a _chef_, as [MASK] had an opportunity of judging that evening.
<name>Wilson</name>	Wilson	Julius	The car fairly leapt forward. Three more shots rang out, but went happily wide. [MASK], upright, leant over the back of the car. “Nothing to shoot at,” he announced gloomily. “But I guess there’ll be another little picnic soon.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Tommy	That’s what beats me!” he ended up. [MASK] shook his head, and said dully: “It accounts for the stitches being new. We might have guessed....” “Never mind the darned stitches. How did he get ahead of us?
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Tommy	“[MASK] wouldn’t have told us to do this unless he was sure we’d be all right.” “But he doesn’t know them as I do!” The girl shivered. “You can’t understand. Five years! Five long years!
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Tommy	She dragged him after her up the ladder. In another moment they were standing in a dusty garret littered with lumber. [MASK] looked round. “This won’t do. It’s a regular trap. There’s no way out.” “Hush! Wait.”
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Tuppence	She lifted her eyebrows at the sight of the girl. “You?” “I had a touch of toothache, ma’am,” said [MASK] glibly. “So thought it better to come home and have a quiet evening.”
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Julius	“As I said before, I’m a mutt!” returned [MASK]. The doctor looked at them all curiously. “You spoke of wanting a statement from her,” he said. “Supposing she is not able to give one?” “What?
<name>the protagonist</name>	the protagonist	Tuppence	As they passed the third floor landing a young clerk came out of an office. He hesitated a moment, then addressed himself to [MASK]. “Were you wanting the Esthonia Glassware?” “Yes, please.” “It’s closed down. Since yesterday afternoon.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Tuppence	I hope they haven’t lost that photograph. That Western photographer’s place was burned down and all his negatives destroyed--this is the only copy in existence. I got it from the principal of the college there.” An unformulated dread swept over [MASK].
<name>The listener</name>	The listener	Tuppence	My experts, working in stereotyped ways, have failed. You will bring imagination and an open mind to the task. Don’t be discouraged if that too does not succeed. For one thing there is a likelihood of the pace being forced.” [MASK] frowned uncomprehendingly.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tommy	Having dispatched this, and [MASK] not having yet returned--which did not surprise her--she started off on a shopping expedition which, with an interval for tea and assorted creamy cakes, occupied her until well after six o’clock, and she returned to the hotel jaded, but satisfied with her purchases.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Tommy	He looks so awfully tired and bored, and yet you feel that underneath he’s just like steel, all keen and flashing. Oh!” She gave a skip. “Pinch me, [MASK], do pinch me. I can’t believe it’s real!”
<name>Ernest</name>	Ernest	Tommy	“Spent.” “Oh, [MASK]!” “No, old thing, not in riotous dissipation. No such luck! The cost of living--ordinary plain, or garden living nowadays is, I assure you, if you do not know----”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tuppence	Nothing of importance remained, though they searched the other rooms as well. “There’s that,” said [MASK] suddenly, pointing to a small, old-fashioned safe let into the wall. “It’s for jewellery, I believe, but there might be something else in it.”
<name>Lord Arthur Savile</name>	Lord Arthur Savile	Tommy	Come along.” “Is this a new brand of humour? Or is your brain really unhinged?” inquired [MASK]. “Your last supposition is the correct one. I have come into money, and the shock has been too much for me!
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Danvers	[MASK] was among the list of those missing. Eventually his body was washed ashore, and identified beyond any possible doubt. But the oilskin packet was missing! “The question was, had it been taken from him, or had he himself passed it on into another’s keeping?
<name>Miss Marple</name>	Miss Marple	Tuppence	“Do you believe in spiritualism?” asked [MASK], opening her eyes wide. The lawyer shrugged his shoulders. “There is some truth in it, without a doubt. But most of the testimony would not pass muster in the witness-box.”
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Tommy	But there was something about that photo”--Julius shook his head, and heaved a sigh--“I guess romance is a mighty queer thing!” “It must be,” said [MASK] coldly, “if you can come over here in love with one girl, and propose to another within a fortnight.”
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Tuppence	Come on, we’d better take a taxi.” “Now who’s being extravagant?” “All expenses paid, remember. Hop in.” “At any rate, we shall make a better effect arriving this way,” said [MASK], leaning back luxuriously.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Tuppence	The look of you told me. Good place here?” “Very good, thank you, sir.” “Ah, but there are plenty of good places nowadays. And a change does no harm sometimes.” “Do you mean----?” began [MASK].
<name>Wolfe</name>	Wolfe	Julius	“Sure thing. Well, so long. I’ll be back in a couple of shakes with a few inspectors along. I shall tell them to pick out their brightest and best.” But the course of events was not to follow the plan [MASK] had laid down.
<name>the young man</name>	the young man	Tommy	The first man was quite unknown to [MASK], who put him down as a city clerk. A quiet, intelligent-looking man, rather shabbily dressed. The second was of the working classes, and his face was vaguely familiar to the young man.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Tuppence	Aren’t you afraid to trust yourself with her?” “No, no, that’s all right. _But go and telephone_. Be quick.” Drawing a long breath, [MASK] entered the Mansions and ran up to the door of No. 20.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Tuppence	“Why?” “Your voice was so--queer!” “I _was_ thinking of something,” confessed [MASK]. “But I don’t want to tell you--not now. I may be wrong, but I don’t think so.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Tommy	She walked towards the door. Suddenly she uttered a cry. [MASK] stared. She had caught sight of the picture he had laid against the wall the night before. For a moment he caught a look of terror in her eyes. As inexplicably it changed to relief.
<name>Liza</name>	Liza	Albert	[MASK] suspected no irony. “She’s style about her, and keeps her silver a treat--but, my word, ain’t she got a temper. Are you going up now, miss? Step inside the lift. No. 20 did you say?”
<name>the protagonist's</name>	the protagonist's	Tuppence	“You may do--some day!” said the other significantly. The cold malignity of her manner sent an unpleasant chill down [MASK]’s spine, but she was not going to give in to it. “Supposing we sit down,” she said pleasantly.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Danvers	So you can go right ahead and tell us the whole story. Did [MASK] give you the papers?” “Yes. He said they’d have a better chance with me, because they would save the women and children first.”
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	Julius	Oh, you don’t know how lonesome I feel!” “Sure thing I do. Then I guess that’s all fixed up, and I’ll see the archbishop about a special license to-morrow morning.” “Oh, [MASK]!”
<name>Mrs. Thompson</name>	Mrs. Thompson	Tuppence	Now, about this young Tommy of yours----” “Yes.” [MASK] clasped her hands. “Frankly, things look bad for him. He’s been butting in somewhere where he wasn’t wanted. Not a doubt of it. But don’t give up hope.”
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Tommy	On the morrow they took up the search once more, and were reluctantly forced to the conclusion that the house had not been invaded for some considerable time. They might have left the village altogether but for a fortunate discovery of [MASK]’s.
<name>Bertie</name>	Bertie	Tommy	“And mind the tea comes in separate teapots,” she added severely. [MASK] sat down opposite her. His bared head revealed a shock of exquisitely slicked-back red hair. His face was pleasantly ugly--nondescript, yet unmistakably the face of a gentleman and a sportsman.
<name>Uriah</name>	Uriah	Conrad	This is just a bit of spite on his part. I’m certain of it.” Further meditations induced in him the feeling that it would be extremely pleasant to bring something down with a whack on [MASK]’s egg-shaped head.
<name>Moriarty</name>	Moriarty	Boris	Well, I guess I’d better buy a car, a slap-up one, dress as a chauffeur and hang about outside. Then if [MASK] comes, you could make some kind of signal, and I’d trail him. How’s that?”
