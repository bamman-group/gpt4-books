<name>Tris</name>	Tris	Portia	“After he said he loved me, did you think I could be in love with him, too?” I ask. “I did,” says [MASK]. “The way you avoided looking at the cameras, the blush.” The others chime in, agreeing.
<name>who</name>	who	Rue	By her position, leaning up against the trunk of the tree, I’d guess Glimmer was supposed to be on guard, but fatigue overcame her. My eyes squint as they try to penetrate the tree next to me, but I can’t make out [MASK].
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Prim	Possibly because they know me from the Hob, or knew my father, or have encountered [MASK], who no one can help loving. So instead of acknowledging applause, I stand there unmoving while they take part in the boldest form of dissent they can manage.
<name>Dr. Mallard</name>	Dr. Mallard	Caesar	“He’s right,” says [MASK]. “He’d have bled to death for sure without it.” I guess this is true, but I can’t help feeling upset about it to the extent that I’m afraid I might cry and then I remember everyone in the country is watching me
<name>Gale</name>	Gale	Peeta	I hand [MASK] my knife, since whatever weapons he once had are long gone, and he slips it into his belt. My last seven arrows — of the twelve I sacrificed three in the explosion, two at the feast — rattle a bit too loosely in the quiver.
<name>Rue</name>	Rue	Rue	I really think I stand a chance of doing it now. Winning. It’s not just having the arrows or outsmarting the Careers a few times, although those things help. Something happened when I was holding [MASK]’s hand, watching the life drain out of her.
<name>Coach</name>	Coach	Peeta	Instead they seem to be of one mind, determined to whip us into shape. Full of endless directions about what we should do and not do in training. [MASK] is more patient, but I become fed up and surly.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Peeta	I translate this into “No one will overhear us talking” in my head. You do have the sense that we might be under surveillance here. “Can we just go up?” “Sure, come on,” says [MASK].
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Peeta	This is what I tell myself to explain the conflicting emotions that arise when I think of [MASK]. The gratitude that he gave me an edge by professing his love for me in the interview. The anger at his superiority on the roof.
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Foxface	The thought makes me smile. I drop my hands and hold my face up to the moonlight so the cameras can be sure to catch it. So, who is there left to be afraid of? [MASK]? The boy tribute from her district is dead.
<name>her</name>	her	Peeta	It’s my own fault, I guess, for telling him he didn’t have to coach us separately. But that didn’t mean I wanted to do everything with [MASK]. Who, by the way, clearly doesn’t want to be partnering up with me, either.
<name>Daddy</name>	Daddy	Peeta	The way my mother’s face would light up at the sound of his boots at the door. The way she almost stopped living when he died. “[MASK]!” I say, trying for the special tone that my mother used only with my father.
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Peeta	Do I run from them now, on the chance they heard me call [MASK]’s name? No, I think. Let them come. Let them come with their night-vision glasses and their heavy, branch-breaking bodies. Right into the range of my arrows.
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Peeta	My stomach is in no way satisfied. “Tomorrow’s a hunting day,” I say. “I won’t be much help with that,” [MASK] says. “I’ve never hunted before.” “I’ll kill and you cook,” I say.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Peeta	But [MASK] holds his ground, actually waving and smiling at the gawking crowd. He only stops when the train pulls into the station, blocking us from their view. He sees me staring at him and shrugs. “Who knows?” he says.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Effie	Still final good-byes must be said here. [MASK] takes both of us by the hand and, with actual tears in her eyes, wishes us well. Thanks us for being the best tributes it has ever been her privilege to sponsor.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Caesar	When did you realize you were in love with him?” asks [MASK]. “Oh, that’s a hard one ...” I give a faint, breathy laugh and look down at my hands. Help. “Well, I know when it hit me.
<name>Kira</name>	Kira	Rue	The more time that passes, the less hopeful I am that this is an injury that will heal. When I reach the site of our first meeting, I feel certain its been undisturbed. There’s no sign of [MASK], not on the ground or in the trees.
<name>Hazel</name>	Hazel	Peeta	I ask. “Maybe not,” he says. [MASK]’s a whiz with fires, coaxing a blaze out of the damp wood. In no time, I have the rabbits and squirrel roasting, the roots, wrapped in leaves, baking in the coals.
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Thresh	Murder! Thankfully, I didn’t say it aloud. That’s not going to win me any points in the arena. What I do say is, “It’s just... if we didn’t win ... I wanted [MASK] to. Because he let me go.
<name>the guide</name>	the guide	Cato	But what? My eyes scan the woods just in time to see the first creature leap onto the plain. As I’m turning away, I see another half dozen join it. Then I am stumbling blindly after [MASK] with no thought of anything but to save myself.
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Katniss	Well, well, well. [MASK], there’s no guarantee there’ll be bows and arrows in the arena, but during your private session with the Gamemakers, show them what you can do. Until then, stay clear of archery. Are you any good at trapping?”
<name>Effie Trinket</name>	Effie Trinket	Prim	I let her towel-dry it and braid it up on my head. I can hardly recognize myself in the cracked mirror that leans against the wall. “You look beautiful,” says [MASK] in a hushed voice. “And nothing like myself,” I say.
<name>Artemis</name>	Artemis	Huh	That should have been my strategy! By the time I’ve worked through the emotions of surprise, admiration, anger, jealousy, and frustration, I’m watching that reddish mane of hair disappear into the trees well out of shooting range. [MASK].
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Cato	“So, I heard. Nice of you to find what’s left of me.” I pull out my water bottle and give him a drink. “Did [MASK] cut you?” I ask. “Left leg. Up high,” he answers.
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Peeta	And then where would he get his liquor? So . . . what? Is he trying to make me suffer for defying him? Is he directing all the sponsors toward [MASK]? Is he just too drunk to even notice what’s going on at the moment?
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Rue	The brief sense of home I had that one night with [MASK] has vanished. My feet wander this way and that until sunset. I’m not afraid, not even watchful. Which makes me an easy target. Except I’d kill anyone I met on sight.
<name>Bod</name>	Bod	Peeta	Unless it’s gone very stale. Of course, practically everything we eat is stale,” says [MASK], pulling the sleeping bag up around him. In less than a minute, he’s snoring. Huh. I always assumed the shopkeepers live a soft life.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Katniss	The result is unsatisfactory. An animal might not question it, but a human would see hands had manufactured it quickly enough. I tear it down in frustration. “[MASK],” he says. I go over to him and brush the hair back from his eyes.
<name>Tris</name>	Tris	Clove	[MASK] jams her fist into my windpipe, very effectively cutting off my voice. But her head’s whipping from side to side, and I know for a moment she’s at least considering I’m telling the truth.
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Peeta	[MASK], it turns out, has never been a danger to me. The thought makes me smile. I drop my hands and hold my face up to the moonlight so the cameras can be sure to catch it. So, who is there left to be afraid of?
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Prim	[MASK] was thrilled to have her back, but I kept watching, waiting for her to disappear on us again. I didn’t trust her. And some small gnarled place inside me hated her for her weakness, for her neglect, for the months she had put us through.
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Gale	A public whipping’s a rare thing in District 12, although occasionally one occurs. Technically, [MASK] and I could be whipped on a daily basis for poaching in the woods — well, technically, we could get a whole lot worse — except all the officials buy our meat.
<name>Cassava</name>	Cassava	Rue	Of course, this kind of deal can only be temporary, but neither of us mentions that. [MASK] contributes a big handful of some sort of starchy root to the meal. Roasted over the fire, they have the sharp sweet taste of a parsnip.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Peeta	“If he’s wounded —” I begin. “It won’t matter,” [MASK] breaks in. “If he can move, he’s coming.” With all the rain, the stream has overrun its banks by several feet on either side.
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Cinna	I think I’m finished when [MASK] pulls the gold mock-ingjay pin from his pocket. I had completely forgotten about it. “Where did you get that?” I ask. “Off the green outfit you wore on the train,” he says.
<name>him</name>	him	Cinna	If it was anyone but [MASK], I might be tempted to ignore him. But after last night’s triumph, I don’t have a lot of room to criticize his choices. I’m nervous about the training. There will be three days in which all the tributes practice together.
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Cinna	I can see by the light that it must be around noon, although the sunny sky has turned overcast. [MASK] invites me to sit on one of the couches and takes his place across from me. He presses a button on the side of the table.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Haymitch	After lunch, [MASK] takes me into the sitting room, directs me to the couch, and then just frowns at me for a while. “What?” I finally ask. “I’m trying to figure out what to do with you,” he says.
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Peeta	2HH Before I can stop myself, I call out [MASK]’s name. paRT mi THE VICTOR ◄ I clap my hands over my mouth, but the sound has already escaped. The sky goes black and I hear a chorus of frogs begin to sing. Stupid!
<name>Neo</name>	Neo	Cato	We wait, for the hovercraft to take [MASK]’s remains, for the trumpets of victory that should follow, but nothing happens. “Hey!” I shout into air. “What’s going on?” The only response is the chatter of waking birds.
<name>Dad</name>	Dad	Gale	At dawn, I lie in bed for a while, watching the sun come up on a beautiful morning. It’s Sunday. A day off at home. I wonder if [MASK] is in the woods yet. Usually we devote all of Sunday to stocking up for the week.
<name>Gale</name>	Gale	Gale	You’re the best hunter I know,” says [MASK]. “It’s not just hunting. They’re armed. They think,” I say. “So do you. And you’ve had more practice. Real practice,” he says.
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Peeta	They’re nightlock. You’ll be dead before they reach your stomach.” Just then, the cannon fires. I whip around, expecting [MASK] to collapse to the ground, but he only raises his eyebrows. The hovercraft appears a hundred yards or so away.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Caesar	“She asked me to try really hard to win.” The audience is frozen, hanging on my every word. “And what did you say?” prompts [MASK] gently. But instead of warmth, I feel an icy rigidity take over my body.
<name>Effie Trinket</name>	Effie Trinket	Cinna	What did you think of that costume?” [MASK] raises one eyebrow at me. Be honest. “You mean after I got over my fear of being burned alive?” I ask. Big laugh. A real one from the audience. “Yes.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Haymitch	Don’t resist,” says [MASK]. He takes the bottle of spirits from the table and leaves the car. As the door swings shut behind him, the car goes dark. There are still a few lights inside, but outside it’s as if night has fallen again.
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Peeta	And while I was talking, the idea of actually losing [MASK] hit me again and I realized how much I don’t want him to die. And it’s not about the sponsors. And it’s not about what will happen back home.
<name>Prim</name>	Prim	Cato	A mockingjay gives the long, low whistle, and tears of relief fill my eyes as the hovercraft appears and takes [MASK]’s body away. Now they will take us. Now we can go home. But again there’s no response.
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Clove	and I’m able to deflect it with my bow. I turn, drawing back the bowstring and send ass an arrow straight at [MASK]’s heart. She turns just enough to avoid a fatal hit, but the point punctures her upper left arm.
<name>Jem</name>	Jem	Prim	I grabbed a bucket and [MASK]’s hand and headed to the Meadow and yes, it was dotted with the golden-headed weeds. After we’d harvested those, we scrounged along inside the fence for probably a mile until we’d filled the bucket with the dandelion greens, stems, and flowers.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Rue	Besides, what I’d really need is to throw about thirty rocks in there at once, setting off a big chain reaction, demolishing the whole lot. I glance back up at the woods. The smoke from [MASK]’s second fire is wafting toward the sky.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Peeta	I can’t do it. I’m helpless as the first hunter crashes through the trees, spear lifted, poised to throw. The shock on [MASK]’s face makes no sense to me. I wait for the blow. Instead his arm drops to his side.
<name>Thresh</name>	Thresh	Rue	The words come out of my mouth before I can stop them. 2BB “You know, they’re not the only ones who can form alliances,” I say. For a moment, no response. Then one of [MASK]’s eyes edges around the trunk.
<name>Haymitch</name>	Haymitch	Haymitch	It’s bad though. They’ll throw us into the arena no matter what condition we’re in. “I know we promised [MASK] we’d do exactly what they said, but I don’t think he considered this angle.”
<name>John</name>	John	Cinna	I look up and find [MASK]’s eyes trained on mine. “How despicable we must seem to you,” he says. Has he seen this in my face or somehow read my thoughts? He’s right, though. The whole rotten lot of them is despicable.
<name>Rue</name>	Rue	Thresh	We were allies. She was so young. But no one will understand my sorrow at [MASK]’s murder. The word pulls me up short. Murder! Thankfully, I didn’t say it aloud. That’s not going to win me any points in the arena.
<name>Waldo</name>	Waldo	Peeta	As we head up alongside the stream, we pass the place where I found [MASK] camouflaged in the weeds and mud. One good thing, between the downpour and the flooded banks, all signs of his hiding place have been wiped out.
<name>Uncle Eddie</name>	Uncle Eddie	Prim	“Even wished me luck.” “Well, we all feel a little closer today, don’t we?” I say, not even bothering to roll my eyes. “[MASK] left us a cheese.” I pull it out. His expression brightens at the treat.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Rue	“If he did, it was all probably just part of his act. You know, to make people think he’s in love with me.” “Oh,” says [MASK] thoughtfully. “I didn’t think that was an act.”
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Gale	I was still using the small version my father had made me, but I’d been practicing with the full-size one when I could. I was hoping that by spring I might be able to bring down some bigger game. [MASK]’s eyes fastened on the bow.
<name>Rue</name>	Rue	Gale	A single note. Just like the one [MASK] and I heard when the redheaded Avox girl was caught. High above the dying campfire a hovercraft materializes. A set of large metal teeth drops down. Slowly, gently, the dead tribute girl is lifted into the hovercraft.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Peeta	“My fault, I guess, if I’m as loud as you say.” We were about as hard to follow as a herd of cattle, but I try to be kind. “And she’s very clever, [MASK]. Well, she was.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Peeta	I wouldn’t even have been here to do it if you hadn’t helped me then,” I say. “Why did you, anyway?” “Why? You know why,” [MASK] says. I give my head a slight, painful shake.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Gale	Quite a crowd had gathered by then to hand out opinions. It was an excellent deal if the goat lived; I’d been robbed if she died. People took sides in the argument, but I took the goat. [MASK] offered to carry her.
<name>Paula</name>	Paula	Peeta	Somehow, although it’s made from the same stuff, it looks a lot more appetizing than the ugly drop biscuits that are the standard fare at home. “And there you have it,” says [MASK], scooping the breads back in the basket.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Peeta	I keep one arm around him as I help him up, and we each place a foot on the first rung of the ladder. The electric current freezes us in place, and this time I’m glad because I’m not really sure [MASK] can hang on for the whole ride.
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Cato	I feel almost as if it’s the first day of the Games again. That I’m in the same position. Twenty-one tributes are dead, but I still have yet to kill [MASK]. And really, wasn’t he always the one to kill?
<name>Rue</name>	Rue	Rue	Especially the Careers. They, at least, can be made to pay for [MASK]’s death. No one materializes though. There aren’t many of us left and it’s a big arena. Soon they’ll be pulling out some other device to force us together.
<name>Haymitch</name>	Haymitch	Haymitch	See, they’d have to reveal what happened in the Training Center for it to have any worthwhile effect on the population. People would need to know what you did. But they can’t since it’s secret, so it’d be a waste of effort,” says [MASK].
<name>him</name>	him	Cato	“Look, I can handle [MASK]. I fought him before, didn’t I?” J1S Yeah, and that turned out great. You ended up dying in a mud bank. That’s what I want to say, but I can’t.
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Prim	You can see the glint of excitement in her eyes. In this way, she’s exactly the opposite of [MASK], for whom adventures are an ordeal. “No idea. Come on, we’ll figure out a plan while we hunt,” I say.
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Rue	But since the odds are still against either of us surviving, I manage to ignore the thought. Besides, I’m distracted by my latest idea about the Careers and their supplies. Somehow [MASK] and I must find a way to destroy their food.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Peeta	He loses his balance and crashes into an ugly urn filled with fake flowers. The urn tips and shatters into hundreds of tiny pieces. [MASK] lands in the shards, and blood immediately flows from his hands. “What was that for?” he says, aghast.
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Haymitch	I’d never make it. Hope for rain. There’s not a cloud in the sky. Keep looking. Yes, this is my only chance. But then, another thought hits me, and the surge of anger that follows brings me to my senses. [MASK]!
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Katniss	he said. “[MASK],” I said louder. “And I wasn’t stealing it. I just wanted to look at your snare. Mine never catch anything.” He scowled at me, not convinced. “So where’d you get the squirrel?”
<name>Prim</name>	Prim	Prim	I’ve never felt lonelier since the Games began. Just accept it will be a bad night, I tell myself. I try not to, but I can’t help thinking of my mother and [MASK], wondering if they’ll sleep a wink tonight.
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Rue	“Well, come on, then. Fix me up.” I plunk down by the fire and roll up my pant leg to reveal the sting on my knee. To my surprise, [MASK] places the handful of leaves into her mouth and begins to chew them.
<name>Gale</name>	Gale	L	For some reason, our discussion from that last morning comes back to me. “We could do it, you know. ” “What?” “Leave the district. Run off. Live in the woods. You and [MASK], we could make it. ”
<name>Cinna</name>	Cinna	Cinna	This day belongs to [MASK]. He’s my last hope. Maybe he can make me look so wonderful, no one will care what comes out of my mouth. The team works on me until late afternoon, turning my skin to glowing satin, stenciling patterns on my arms.
<name>Foxface</name>	Foxface	Rue	I don’t see any other tributes, but I do notice some of the things [MASK] has mentioned. Patches of the sweet berries. A bush with the leaves that healed my stings. Clusters of tracker jacker nests in the vicinity of the tree I was trapped in.
<name>Bella</name>	Bella	Prim	I won’t. I couldn’t help what —” “Well, you have to help it this time. You can’t clock out and leave [MASK] on her own. There’s no me now to keep you both alive. It doesn’t matter what happens.
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Peeta	Once were in the arena, there’s detailed coverage of the bloodbath and then the filmmakers basically alternate between shots of tributes dying and shots of us. Mostly [MASK] really, there’s no question he’s carrying this romance thing on his shoulders.
<name>Miranda</name>	Miranda	Haymitch	[MASK] grabs my shoulders and pins me against the wall. “Who cares? It’s all a big show. It’s all how you’re perceived. The most I could say about you after your interview was that you were nice enough, although that in itself was a small miracle.
<name>Flipper</name>	Flipper	Peeta	[MASK]’s happy to oblige and since he’s a lot quieter in water than on land, it’s a doubly good idea. It’s a long walk back to the cave though, even going downward, even with the rabbit to give us a boost.
<name>Neo</name>	Neo	Cinna	But [MASK]’s close-cropped hair appears to be its natural shade of brown. He’s in a simple black shirt and pants. The only concession to self-alteration seems to be metallic gold eyeliner that has been applied with a light hand.
<name>Themis</name>	Themis	Peeta	Even if they think it’s a ruse, I hope they’ll decide I’m hidden somewhere near it. While in reality, I’ll be tracking [MASK]. The sun burns off the morning haze almost immediately and I can tell the day will be hotter than usual.
<name>Haymitch</name>	Haymitch	Caesar	My lips are sealed.” “Let’s go back then, to the moment they called your sister’s name at the reaping,” says [MASK]. His mood is quieter now. “And you volunteered. Can you tell us about her?” No.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Gale	Of [MASK]. I excuse myself to change out of my dress and into a plain shirt and pants. As I slowly, thoroughly wash the makeup from my face and put my hair in its braid, I begin transforming back into myself.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Peeta	“Did I actually get a pair of fighters this year?” [MASK] rises from the floor and scoops up a handful of ice from under the fruit tureen. He starts to raise it to the red mark on his jaw.
<name>Miranda</name>	Miranda	Gale	I try to forgive her for my father’s sake. But to be honest, I’m not the forgiving type. [MASK] spreads the bread slices with the soft goat cheese, carefully placing a basil leaf on each while I strip the bushes of their berries.
<name>Haymitch</name>	Haymitch	Peeta	that was just some strategy you two worked out.” “No. I mean, I couldn’t even talk to him in the arena, could I?” I stammer. “But you knew what he wanted you to do, didn’t you?” says [MASK].
<name>Andy</name>	Andy	Peeta	Are they fighting each other? Looking for us? Maybe one of them has located us and is just waiting for the right moment to attack. The idea sends me back to the cave. [MASK]’s stretched out on top of the sleeping bag in the shade of the rocks.
<name>Nurse</name>	Nurse	Peeta	“I think it’s stopped finally, but I wouldn’t sit up or anything.” I gingerly lift my hand to my head and find it bandaged. This simple gesture leaves me weak and dizzy. [MASK] holds a bottle to my lips and I drink thirstily.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Peeta	“Oh, she meant you,” I say with a wave of dismissal. “She said, ‘She’s a survivor, that one.’ She is,” says [MASK]. That pulls me up short. Did his mother really say that about me?
<name>Finch</name>	Finch	Katniss	“[MASK]?” I push away, trying to sort out my feelings. “If two people agree on a signal, they stay in range. Because if one of them doesn’t answer, they’re in trouble, all right?” “All right!”
<name>Capricorn</name>	Capricorn	Cinna	Even the slight movement in the air sends a ripple up my body. By comparison, the chariot costume seems garish, the interview dress too contrived. In this dress, I give the illusion of wearing candlelight. “What do you think?” asks [MASK].
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Rue	23H Here it’s safe, here it's warm Here the daisies guard you from every harm Here your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings them true Here is the place where I love you. [MASK]’s eyes have fluttered shut. Her chest moves but only slightly.
<name>Han</name>	Han	Katniss	“I’ll let them fight it out, we’ll see who’s in the sky tomorrow night and work out a plan from there.” “You’re such a bad liar, [MASK]. I don’t know how you’ve survived this long.”
<name>him</name>	him	Haymitch	A thought hits me, and I’m amazed the question’s taken so long to surface. Maybe it’s because I’ve only recently begun to view [MASK] with a degree of curiosity. “How do you think he did it?” “Who?
