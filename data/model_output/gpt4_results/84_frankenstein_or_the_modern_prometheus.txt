<name>Clerval</name>	Clerval	Clerval	I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but my convalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly. In another fortnight I was able to leave my chamber. One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce [MASK] to the several professors of the university.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	I took the hand of [MASK]. "You are sorrowful, my love. Ah! If you knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure, you would endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this one day at least permits me to enjoy."
<name>Clerval</name>	Clerval	Clerval	The delight of [MASK] was proportionably greater than mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his inferiors.
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Frankenstein	Believe me, [MASK], I was benevolent; my soul glowed with love and humanity; but am I not alone, miserably alone? You, my creator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures, who owe me nothing?
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Frankenstein	The guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they are, to speak in their own defence before they are condemned. Listen to me, [MASK]. You accuse me of murder, and yet you would, with a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature.
<name>Victor</name>	Victor	Henry	[MASK] deeply felt the misfortune of being debarred from a liberal education. He said little, but when he spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a restrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details of commerce. We sat late.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	On her deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert her. She joined the hands of [MASK] and myself. "My children," she said, "my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your union.
<name>Justine</name>	Justine	Justine	"My dear father, you are mistaken; [MASK] is innocent." "If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. She is to be tried today, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted."
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Clerval	[MASK] spent the last evening with us. He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit him to accompany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain. His father was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the aspirations and ambition of his son.
<name>Edgar</name>	Edgar	Victor	"You well know, [MASK], that our union had been the favourite plan of your parents ever since our infancy. We were told this when young, and taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take place.
<name>Providence</name>	Providence	Providence	With his permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their charge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence had seemed a blessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty and want when [MASK] afforded her such powerful protection.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Henry	Doubtless my words surprised [MASK]; he at first believed them to be the wanderings of my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which I continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.
<name>Valjean</name>	Valjean	Justine	dearest blessed child! I soon shall see you again in heaven, where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as I am to suffer ignominy and death." "Oh, [MASK]! Forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you.
<name>Clerval</name>	Clerval	Clerval	[MASK] spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words impressed themselves on my mind and I remembered them afterwards in solitude. But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a cabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend.
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Frankenstein	He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and the appearances of the sky. "This is what it is to live," he cried; "how I enjoy existence! But you, my dear [MASK], wherefore are you desponding and sorrowful!"
<name>Safie</name>	Safie	Safie	I heard of the discovery of the American hemisphere and wept with [MASK] over the hapless fate of its original inhabitants. "These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. Was man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so vicious and base?
<name>Albert</name>	Albert	Ernest	My uncle is not pleased with the idea of a military career in a distant country, but [MASK] never had your powers of application. He looks upon study as an odious fetter; his time is spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the lake.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Beaufort	[MASK] had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a merchant's house.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	It is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for the guilty there is no peace. The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief. Soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with [MASK].
<name>Clerval</name>	Clerval	Clerval	He had vowed TO BE WITH ME ON MY WEDDING-NIGHT, yet he did not consider that threat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show me that he was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered [MASK] immediately after the enunciation of his threats.
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Frankenstein	So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of [MASK]--more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Felix	Her voice was musical but unlike that of either of my friends. On hearing this word, [MASK] came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression.
<name>Justine</name>	Justine	Justine	"I wish," cried she, "that I were to die with you; I cannot live in this world of misery." [MASK] assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty repressed her bitter tears.
<name>Clerval</name>	Clerval	Werter	But I thought [MASK] himself a more divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character contained no pretension, but it sank deep. The disquisitions upon death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Clerval	[MASK]! Beloved friend! Even now it delights me to record your words and to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving. He was a being formed in the "very poetry of nature." His wild and enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart.
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Frankenstein	Oh, [MASK]! Generous and self-devoted being! What does it avail that I now ask thee to pardon me? I, who irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all thou lovedst. Alas! He is cold, he cannot answer me."
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Frankenstein	When the sailors saw this and that their return to their native country was apparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them, loud and long-continued. [MASK], who was dozing, awoke and asked the cause of the tumult.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native country. My journey had been my own suggestion, and [MASK] therefore acquiesced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of my suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	"Dear, dear [MASK]!" I exclaimed, when I had read her letter: "I will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety they must feel." I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but my convalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly.
<name>Werther</name>	Werther	Satan	Many times I considered [MASK] as the fitter emblem of my condition, for often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter gall of envy rose within me. "Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings.
<name>Clerval</name>	Clerval	Henry	But I was not the witness of his grief, for I was lifeless and did not recover my senses for a long, long time. This was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for several months. During all that time [MASK] was my only nurse.
<name>Clerval</name>	Clerval	Clerval	He had also changed my apartment; for he perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had previously been my laboratory. But these cares of [MASK] were made of no avail when I visited the professors.
<name>Walton</name>	Walton	Margaret	Adieu, my dear [MASK]. Be assured that for my own sake, as well as yours, I will not rashly encounter danger. I will be cool, persevering, and prudent. But success SHALL crown my endeavours. Wherefore not?
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	"Have you, then, some other attachment?" "None on earth. I love [MASK] and look forward to our union with delight. Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate myself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin."
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Frankenstein	I cannot doubt it, yet I am lost in surprise and admiration. Sometimes I endeavoured to gain from [MASK] the particulars of his creature's formation, but on this point he was impenetrable. "Are you mad, my friend?" said he.
<name>Felix</name>	Felix	Felix	I thought (foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people. When I slept or was absent, the forms of the venerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent [MASK] flitted before me.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Felix	[MASK] darted forward, and with supernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung, in a transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently with a stick. I could have torn him limb from limb, as the lion rends the antelope.
<name>Justine</name>	Justine	Justine	Nor was her residence at her mother's house of a nature to restore her gaiety. The poor woman was very vacillating in her repentance. She sometimes begged [MASK] to forgive her unkindness, but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her brothers and sister.
<name>Clerval</name>	Clerval	Clerval	As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black melancholy that nothing could dissipate. The image of [MASK] was forever before me, ghastly and murdered. More than once the agitation into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous relapse.
<name>Clerval</name>	Clerval	Clerval	But I enjoyed friends, dear not only through habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever I am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the conversation of [MASK] will be ever whispered in my ear.
<name>Manette</name>	Manette	Manoir	She is a widow, and much older than [MASK]; but she is very much admired, and a favourite with everybody. "I have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxiety returns upon me as I conclude.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	My departure was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the day resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life occurred--an omen, as it were, of my future misery. [MASK] had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was in the greatest danger.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Henry	Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight tribute to the unexampled worth of [MASK], but they soothe my heart, overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates. I will proceed with my tale.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Justine	[MASK] has just returned to us; and I assure you I love her tenderly. She is very clever and gentle, and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her expression continually remind me of my dear aunt.
<name>Justine</name>	Justine	Justine	You, my playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold! No! No! I never could survive so horrible a misfortune." [MASK] shook her head mournfully. "I do not fear to die," she said; "that pang is past.
<name>Justine</name>	Justine	Elizabeth	[MASK] was sad and desponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted and destroyed.
<name>Felix</name>	Felix	Felix	When they separated [MASK] kissed the hand of the stranger and said, 'Good night sweet Safie.' He sat up much longer, conversing with his father, and by the frequent repetition of her name I conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject of their conversation.
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Frankenstein	I hesitated before I answered, when [MASK], who had at first been silent, and indeed appeared hardly to have force enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled, and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour. Turning towards the men, he said, "What do you mean?
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	For myself, there was one reward I promised myself from my detested toils--one consolation for my unparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when, enfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim [MASK] and forget the past in my union with her.
<name>Victor</name>	Victor	Justine	My cousin wept also. "Oh, [MASK]!" said she. "Why did you rob me of my last consolation? I relied on your innocence, and although I was then very wretched, I was not so miserable as I am now." "
<name>Justine</name>	Justine	Justine	I dared not ask the fatal question, but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my visit. The ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and [MASK] was condemned. I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt.
<name>Felix</name>	Felix	Felix	"'It is utterly useless,' replied [MASK]; 'we can never again inhabit your cottage. The life of my father is in the greatest danger, owing to the dreadful circumstance that I have related. My wife and my sister will never recover from their horror.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Felix	He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a Christian, but he feared the resentment of [MASK] if he should appear lukewarm, for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer if he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which they inhabited.
<name>Felix</name>	Felix	Felix	The horrible scene of the preceding day was forever acting before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged [MASK] tearing me from his father's feet. I awoke exhausted, and finding that it was already night, I crept forth from my hiding-place, and went in search of food.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	William	This picture is gone, and was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed. We have no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover him are unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved [MASK]!
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	I trembled violently at his exordium, and my father continued--"I confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your marriage with our dear [MASK] as the tie of our domestic comfort and the stay of my declining years.
<name>Justine</name>	Justine	Justine	A thousand times rather would I have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to [MASK], but I was absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have exculpated her who suffered through me.
<name>Clerval</name>	Clerval	Clerval	Yet that is over now: [MASK] writes that indeed you are getting better. I eagerly hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in your own handwriting. "Get well--and return to us. You will find a happy, cheerful home and friends who love you dearly.
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Elizabeth	The saintly soul of [MASK] shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home. Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of her celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us.
<name>Safie</name>	Safie	Justine	[MASK], thus received in our family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Justine	This benefit was fully repaid; [MASK] was the most grateful little creature in the world: I do not mean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Frankenstein	But, my dear [MASK]," continued he, stopping short and gazing full in my face, "I did not before remark how very ill you appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching for several nights."
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	I neither spoke nor looked at anyone, but sat motionless, bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me. [MASK] alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice would soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human feelings when sunk in torpor.
<name>Victor</name>	Victor	Victor	But as brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each other without desiring a more intimate union, may not such also be our case? Tell me, dearest [MASK]. Answer me, I conjure you by our mutual happiness, with simple truth--Do you not love another?
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	In this state of mind I wrote to [MASK]. My letter was calm and affectionate. "I fear, my beloved girl," I said, "little happiness remains for us on earth; yet all that I may one day enjoy is centred in you.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Victor	I now say, Thank God she did not live to witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling! "Come, [MASK]; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin, but with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of festering, the wounds of our minds.
<name>Liberty</name>	Liberty	Liberty	For they had called me mad, and during many months, as I understood, a solitary cell had been my habitation. [MASK], however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as I awakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge.
<name>Felix</name>	Felix	Felix	I should not have understood the purport of this book had not [MASK], in reading it, given very minute explanations. He had chosen this work, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the Eastern authors.
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Frankenstein	"You, who call [MASK] your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my crimes and his misfortunes. But in the detail which he gave you of them he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured wasting in impotent passions.
<name>Safie</name>	Safie	Agatha	The gentle words of [MASK] and the animated smiles of the charming Arabian were not for me. The mild exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved Felix were not for me. Miserable, unhappy wretch! "Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply.
<name>Gringoire</name>	Gringoire	William	; he said, that he had been playing with him, that [MASK] had run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and afterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return. "
<name>Walton</name>	Walton	Walton	I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea. "I thank you, [MASK]," he said, "for your kind intentions towards so miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and fresh affections, think you that any can replace those who are gone?
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	The rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had then been observed by [MASK]. Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change.
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Frankenstein	I leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom these eyes will ever behold. Farewell, [MASK]! If thou wert yet alive and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better satiated in my life than in my destruction.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Margaret	About half an hour afterwards he attempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and his eyes closed forever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed away from his lips. [MASK], what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this glorious spirit?
<name>Clerval</name>	Clerval	Clerval	Study had before secluded me from the intercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but [MASK] called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught me to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children. Excellent friend!
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	I hastened to return home, and [MASK] eagerly demanded the result. "My cousin," replied I, "it is decided as you may have expected; all judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty should escape. But she has confessed."
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Clerval	[MASK], whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn. I thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak.
<name>Felix</name>	Felix	Felix	[MASK] rejected his offers with contempt, yet when he saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visit her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude, the youth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed a treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard.
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Felix	I entreat you not to reason with me any more. Take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this place.' "[MASK] trembled violently as he said this. He and his companion entered the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and then departed.
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Frankenstein	What do these sounds portend? It is midnight; the breeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir. Again there is a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin where the remains of [MASK] still lie.
<name>Clerval</name>	Clerval	Clerval	I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my misery and taunt me with the death of [MASK], as a new incitement for me to comply with his hellish desires.
<name>Justine</name>	Justine	Justine	[MASK] was called on for her defence. As the trial had proceeded, her countenance had altered. Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly expressed. Sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was desired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible although variable voice.
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Devil	"[MASK], cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice. I have declared my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend beneath words. Leave me; I am inexorable." "It is well.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Margaret	I must own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services. And now, dear [MASK], do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?
<name>Clerval</name>	Clerval	Clerval	"Compose yourself," said [MASK], who observed my change of colour, "I will not mention it if it agitates you; but your father and cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your own handwriting.
<name>Justine</name>	Justine	Justine	She is to be tried today, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted." This speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own mind that [MASK], and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder.
<name>Victor</name>	Victor	Victor	I could offer no explanation of them, but their truth in part relieved the burden of my mysterious woe. Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder, "My dearest [MASK], what infatuation is this?
<name>Coleridge</name>	Coleridge	Coleridge	Like one who, on a lonely road, Doth walk in fear and dread, And, having once turned round, walks on, And turns no more his head; Because he knows a frightful fiend Doth close behind him tread. [[MASK]'s "Ancient Mariner."]
<name>Justine</name>	Justine	Justine	The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass the awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as I did, such deep and bitter agony. I gnashed my teeth and ground them together, uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul. [MASK] started.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Child	As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before his eyes and uttered a shrill scream; I drew his hand forcibly from his face and said, '[MASK], what is the meaning of this? I do not intend to hurt you; listen to me.'
<name>Justine</name>	Justine	Justine	I was overcome by gloom and misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. At one time I considered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the penalty of the law, less innocent than poor [MASK] had been.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Victor	My dear [MASK], do not speak thus. Heavy misfortunes have befallen us, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love for those whom we have lost to those who yet live. Our circle will be small but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Justine	That report, you say, is false; and be assured, dear [MASK], that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a moment, but your own confession." "I did confess, but I confessed a lie.
<name>Justine</name>	Justine	Justine	I afterwards hired a mule, as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive injury on these rugged roads. The weather was fine; it was about the middle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of [MASK], that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe.
<name>Wilhelm</name>	Wilhelm	William	She is very clever and gentle, and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her expression continually remind me of my dear aunt. "I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling [MASK].
<name>Clerval</name>	Clerval	Clerval	Two I have already destroyed; other victims await their destiny; but you, [MASK], my friend, my benefactor--" The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and I was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Ernest	Before, I had only imagined the wretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and a not less terrible, disaster. I tried to calm [MASK]; I enquired more minutely concerning my father, and here I named my cousin.
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Thomas	I am too ardent in execution and too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me that I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild on a common and read nothing but our Uncle [MASK]' books of voyages.
<name>Safie</name>	Safie	Agatha	[MASK] listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father.
