<name>Aunt Reed</name>	Aunt Reed	Efuru	‘How?’.[MASK] asked in horror. The boy was playing with a stick. The maid saw him and did not take it away from him. So the stick went right into his eye and now the poor boy is blind in one eye.’

<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Nkoyeni	This is very sad.’ It seemed as if cold water was poured on [MASK]’s body during the harmattan. Her heart missed a beat. She stared at the woman who said these incomprehensible words. ‘What are you saying?’ another woman said.
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Efuru	On the appointed day, the young men went to bring back their daughter who had brought so much disgrace to them. Immediately [MASK] saw the men, she came out and greeted them. ‘Welcome, my brothers. What good wind brings you here today.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Adizua	Angry because she had again loved in vain. She had deceived herself all these years, as she deceived herself when she was [MASK]’s wife. She was filled with hate and resentment, qualities that were foreign to her nature.

<name>Oya</name>	Oya	Uhamiri	It is a great honour. She is going to protect you and shower riches on you. But you must keep her laws. Look round this town, nearly all the storey buildings you find are built by women who one time or another have been worshippers of [MASK].
<name>Chimamanda</name>	Chimamanda	Adizua	She remembered the day she and her father went to the dibia and what the sage told her. And above all, she remembered the first day she felt in her womb that she was expecting [MASK]’s baby and also the day she had the baby.
<name>Chinonso</name>	Chinonso	Efuru	[MASK] got up early and went to the stream to fetch water. She took extra care about her appearance. She wore a new wrappa and plaited her long black hair into four. When she came to the gate, she saw the old woman who was at the gate the night before.
<name>Okeke</name>	Okeke	Efuru	He started dealing in cigarettes and when he made headway, he soon owned a fairly large stall in the market. He was still unmarried which was strange. [MASK] brought kola-nuts and a bottle of home-made gin. ‘Who will break the kola?’
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Gilbert	‘Come on Eke day then.’ “No, I won't come. You come when you have time. I am going to sleep. Let day break.’ ‘I must marry her,’ [MASK] kept on telling himself.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Efuru	When you finish the cassava, bring it along with the children. I want to go and help [MASK] with the funeral.’ There, there, it sounds again, like thunder rendering the quiet of the morning.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Efuru	[MASK]’s mother-in-law went to the direction of the call. She bought some oranges and bananas from the woman who called her. ‘I hope she is doing well,’ the woman asked her. 'Oh, she is doing very well.
<name>she</name>	she	Ogea	As soon as [MASK] saw the coffin, she began to weep again. "Please don’t put her in that coffin," she wept. ‘Please don’t put her in that wretched coffin, put me instead.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Ogea	When she finished sweeping, she began to eat. ‘You don't sit like that when you are eating. Put your legs together and sit like a woman.’ [MASK] did as she was told and continued eating.
<name>Mr. Jaggers</name>	Mr. Jaggers	Gilbert	‘It will not stop,’ said [MASK]. ‘Even those who are caught in the trade and go to jail often come back after their term of imprisonment determined to pursue the trade with all their might. Nothing stops them from trading in it.’
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Ogea	‘You are spoiling [MASK]. You just leave her to do what she likes. Remember she is a girl and she will marry one day. If you don’t bring her up well, nobody will marry her. By the way, can she cook now?’
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Efuru	You may not wait as long as I did. I gained nothing from my long suffering, so the world would think, but I am proud that I was and still am true to the only man I loved.’ [MASK] did not say a word.

<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Efuru	She had to go to the farm with him and she had to learn the hard way. She was able to endure it because of the tremendous love she had for her husband and her children. Surprisingly enough, the following evening husband and wife found themselves going to [MASK]’s house.
<name>Lady Bracknell</name>	Lady Bracknell	Omirima	And now you ask me this impertinent question.’ ‘So it is true that she has been paying her visits?* [MASK] went on, strengthened by this information. That’s it, they saw something before they started talking. Did I say they must have seen something.
