<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Thea	She took [MASK] into the sitting-room, very warm and smelling of food, and brought her a plateful of little Christmas cakes, made according to old and hallowed formulae, and put them before her while she warmed her feet.
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Fred	“And then I got the idea,” he added simply, “that she would not live like other people: that, for better or worse, she had uncommon gifts.” “Oh, we'll see that it's for better, you and I,” [MASK] reassured him.
<name>Mr. Gatsby</name>	Mr. Gatsby	Harsanyi	He was there so often and at such irregular hours that the ushers thought he was a singer's husband, or had something to do with the electrical plant. [MASK] and his wife were in a box, near the stage, in the second circle.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Fred	Now, as I look back on it, I see that I've always, even when I was little, shielded him.” As she laughed, [MASK] caught the bright spark in her eye that he knew so well, and held it for a happy instant.
<name>Ma Joad</name>	Ma Joad	Thea	You were always wiping my face with them, when you met me out in the dust, I remember. Did I never have any?” “I think you'd nearly always used yours up on your baby brother.” [MASK] sighed.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Thea	They both wore glasses, but such a look! Like forget-menots, and so full of happy recollections. [MASK] wanted to put her arms around them and ask them how they had been able to keep a feeling like that, like a nosegay in a glass of water.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Fred	“Dark as pitch in here,” [MASK] exclaimed as they hurried over the old rock doorstep. “But it's warm. The rocks hold the heat. It's going to be terribly cold outside, all right.” He was interrupted by a deafening peal of thunder.
<name>Orinoco</name>	Orinoco	Wunsch	It was a nature-voice, [MASK] told himself, breathed from the creature and apart from language, like the sound of the wind in the trees, or the murmur of water. “What is it the flowers mean when they ask him not to be harsh to their sister, eh?”
<name>he</name>	he	Wunsch	She was stroking his hand and looking off into the distance. He felt in her face that look of unconscious power that [MASK] had seen there. Yes, she was bound for the big terminals of the world; no way stations for her. His lids drooped.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Stratton	“That's the way for the old man to go. It would be pretty hard luck if he had to die in a hospital. I wish he could turn up something before he cashes in. But his kind seldom do; they're bewitched. Still, there was [MASK].
<name>Brunnhilde</name>	Brunnhilde	WOTAN	The FRICKA of that afternoon was so clear and sunny, so nobly conceived, that she made a whole atmosphere about herself and quite redeemed from shabbiness the helplessness and unscrupulousness of the gods. Her reproaches to [MASK] were the pleadings of a tempered mind, a consistent sense of beauty.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Fred	“Any one you'd rather be shut up with than me? No? Sure about that?” “I think I am. Aren't you cold?” “Not especially.” [MASK] smoked in silence, listening to the roar of the water outside.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Fred	The doctor looked at him narrowly. “You think that's about the principal difference between country people and city people, don't you?” [MASK] was a little disconcerted at being followed up so resolutely, and he attempted to dismiss it with a pleasantry.
<name>Sigrid</name>	Sigrid	Ottenburg	She was behaving somewhat like a cyclone now, and while she wrenched open drawers and closet doors, [MASK] got to the piano as quickly as possible and began to herald the reappearance of the Volsung pair, trusting to memory.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Landry	[MASK] turned back. “Yes. She came several times when I had erysipelas. I was a nice mess, with two nurses. She brought down some inside window-boxes, planted with crocuses and things. Very cheering, only I couldn't see them or her.”
<name>Captain Smollett</name>	Captain Smollett	Landry	And in about fifteen minutes, bring some fresh toast. That's all, thank you.” For the next few minutes there was a clatter of teacups and responses about sugar. “[MASK] always takes rum. I'm glad the rest of you don't.
<name>Madame Butterfly</name>	Madame Butterfly	SIEGLINDE	Too much to be an agreeable hostess.” She turned quickly away from the coffee and sat down on the piano bench, facing the two men. “For one thing, there's a change in the cast for Friday afternoon. They're going to let me sing [MASK].”
<name>George</name>	George	Ottenburg	“I couldn't give you much of an idea of it. It's a big song.” [MASK] took her gently by the elbow and pushed her into the other room. He sat down carelessly at the piano and looked over the music for a moment.
<name>Jeb</name>	Jeb	Lars	[MASK] was the fourth son, and he was born lazy. He seemed to bear the mark of overstrain on the part of his parents. Even in his cradle he was an example of physical inertia; anything to lie still.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Fred	[MASK] whispered her name three times, shaking her a little as if to waken her. It was too dark to see, but he could feel that she was smiling. When she kissed him she had not hidden her face on his shoulder,--she had risen a little on her toes, and stood straight and free.
<name>Dill</name>	Dill	Gunner	But you've got to know how to do something, [MASK], that you have. What are you going to do when you git big and want to git into society, if you can't do nothing? Everybody'll say, 'Can you sing?
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Thea	One carried things about in one's head, long after one's linen could be smuggled out in a tuning-bag. He handed the paper back to [MASK]. “There is the English, quite elegant,” he said, rising.
<name>Brett</name>	Brett	Thea	You surely earn your bath. I went down and had a look at your pool the other afternoon. Neat place, with all those little cottonwoods. Must be very becoming.” “Think so?” [MASK] said over her shoulder, as she swung round a turn.
<name>William</name>	William	Thea	She still remembered that, as a baby, [MASK] had been the “best-formed” of any of her children. “I'll have to get you a longer bed,” she remarked, as she put the tray on the table.
<name>Ruby</name>	Ruby	Thea	Such treatment the imposing lady did not at all resent. She tried harder and harder, her eyes growing all the while more lustrous and her lips redder. [MASK] played on as she was told, ignoring the singer's struggles.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Thea	“It's an awful climb,” he sighed, “when I could be perfectly happy here with my pipe. However--” He took up his stick and hat and followed [MASK] down the water trail. “Do you climb this path every day?
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Thea	No, it was all clear enough. Nothing that she would ever do in the world would seem important to them, and nothing they would ever do would seem important to her. [MASK] lay thinking intently all through the stifling afternoon.
<name>Truman</name>	Truman	Landry	I could hear her pacing about like something in a cage. She pushed the piano back against the wall and the chairs into corners, and she broke my amber elephant.” [MASK] took a yellow object some four inches high from one of his low bookcases.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Johnny	She come for hear guitar. She gotta some music in her, that child. Where she get?' Then he tell me 'bout your gran'papa play oboe in the old country. I never forgetta that time.” [MASK] chuckled softly.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Ottenburg	And after all, we must really be just about as we shall look to him.” [MASK] started up and threw his cigarette into the grate. “That I deny. Have you ever been really frank with this preceptor of your childhood, even when you WERE a child?
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Thea	That substantial comfort might take the temper out of you, dull your edge. Yes,” he sighed, “I guess you were meant for the jolt of the breakers.” “I guess I'll get plenty of jolt,” [MASK] murmured, turning to her trunk.
<name>Miss Bates</name>	Miss Bates	Fred	In the light of what she had done, of the strain they had lived through during the last two hours, it made one laugh,--almost cry. She went on, robustly: “And I didn't feel my dinner, really, [MASK].
<name>the world</name>	the world	Wunsch	And yet she knew that she was going to leave them all behind some day. They would be changing all day long, yellow and purple and lavender, and she would not be there. From that day on, she felt there was a secret between her and [MASK].
<name>Lucie</name>	Lucie	Thea	“In a hurry?” he asked. “I'll leave the end door open and air you out. Catch a wink; the time'll go faster.” [MASK] nodded good-night to him and settled her head back on her pillow, looking up at the oil lamps.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Fred	You might have thought the management would say something, but not they.” She looked at [MASK] from under her blackened lashes. “It WAS a stunt, to jump in and sing that second act without rehearsal. It doesn't sing itself.”
<name>Mr. Stevens</name>	Mr. Stevens	Harsanyi	[MASK] himself had changed very little. He had put on his best afternoon coat in honor of his pupil, and wore a pearl in his black ascot. His hair was longer and more bushy than he used to wear it, and there was now one gray lock on the right side.
<name>him</name>	him	Ottenburg	She was confused, but not embarrassed. She was not afraid of [MASK]. He was not one of those people who made her spine like a steel rail. On the contrary, he made one venturesome. “Well, it goes something like this: Thanks for your advice!
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Thea	When [MASK] first came, the chokecherry bushes were in blossom, and the scent of them was almost sickeningly sweet after a shower. At the very bottom of the canyon, along the stream, there was a thread of bright, flickering, golden-green,--cottonwood seedlings.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Thea	Taking [MASK] into the studio, which was littered with excelsior and packing-cases, she stood holding her hand and looking at her in the strong light from the big window before she allowed her to sit down. Her quick eye saw many changes.
<name>Howard Roark</name>	Howard Roark	Thea	She glowered at the rows of feckless bodies that lay sprawled in the chairs. Let them try it once! Along with the yearning that came from some deep part of her, that was selfless and exalted, [MASK] had a hard kind of cockiness, a determination to get ahead.
<name>Mrs. Hudson</name>	Mrs. Hudson	Ottenburg	How lucky you got here just when she was coming on for this. You couldn't have hit a better time.” [MASK] stirred the contents of the dish faster and put in more sherry. “And where have you been since twelve o'clock, may I ask?”
<name>Meg</name>	Meg	Kennedy	He took her hand with the sympathetic, reassuring graveness which had helped her at more than one hard time in her life. “Get your hat, my girl. [MASK]'s hurt down the road, and he wants you to run down with me.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Thea	[MASK] picked up the tray. By this time she was as white as the Sunday tablecloth. “Well,” she replied in a cold, even tone, “I'll have to throw it at them sooner or later.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Thea	One of the sick girls used to ask them to pray that she might have more faith in the times of depression that came to her, “when all the way before seemed dark.” She repeated that husky phrase so often, that [MASK] always remembered it.
<name>someone</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	someone (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	Ray	She took from her pocket a postcard, bent in the middle and folded, and handed it to [MASK]. On it was a white dove, perched on a wreath of very blue forget-me-nots, and “Birthday Greetings” in gold letters.
<name>John</name>	John	Thea	The spark in his eye, which is one's very self, caught the spark in hers that was herself, and for a moment they looked into each other's natures. [MASK] realized how good and how great-hearted he was, and he realized about her many things.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Thea	“She doesn't sigh every time the wind blows. With her one swallow doesn't make a summer.” [MASK] told them very little about herself. She was not naturally communicative, and she found it hard to feel confidence in new people.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Thea	[MASK]'s eye lighted. “I haven't seen him for years. We always miss each other.” She paused, hesitating. “Yes, I should like that. But he'll be busy, maybe?”
<name>Swedes</name>	Swedes	Swedes	“Yes, I used to be ashamed of being a Swede, but I'm not any more. [MASK] are kind of common, but I think it's better to be SOMETHING.” “It surely is! How tall you are getting.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Thea	You must have been doing it ever since you were two feet high.” [MASK] looked slowly up at her companion's good-humored face. His eyes, sometimes too restless and sympathetic in town, had grown steadier and clearer in the open air.
<name>Uncle Jack</name>	Uncle Jack	Thea	“Oh, I can walk in our yard,” he replied unappreciatively. “I guess I can make a pond for my duck.” [MASK] leaned down and looked into his face. “But you won't forget about sister, will you?”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Thea	he asked, looking down at her curiously and wrinkling his dull red forehead. [MASK] glanced at him in surprise. “I suppose he thinks they are asking him not to be harsh to his sweetheart--or some girl they remind him of.”
<name>Saffron</name>	Saffron	Thea	“Now we have some lil' SERENATA, eh? You wan' a try?” When [MASK] began to sing, instant silence fell upon the company. She felt all those dark eyes fix themselves upon her intently. She could see them shine.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Peter	“Well, you're mighty conceited, [MASK]! But I don't know as I ever regretted it. I prefer having a family of my own to fussing with other folks' children, that's the truth.”
<name>Miss Lonelyhearts</name>	Miss Lonelyhearts	Thea	When she moved into a new place her eyes challenged the beds, the carpets, the food, the mistress of the house. The boarding-houses were wretchedly conducted and [MASK]'s complaints sometimes took an insulting form. She quarreled with one landlady after another and moved on.
<name>Juan</name>	Juan	Thea	“No use spoiling your Sunday dinner with race prejudices. The Mexicans suit me and [MASK] very well. They are a useful people. Now you can just talk about something else.” Conversation, however, did not flourish at that dinner. Everybody ate as fast as possible.
<name>Isadora</name>	Isadora	Thea	The last time I heard her she had no voice at all. She IS a poor vocalist!” [MASK] cut him off. “She's a great artist, whether she's in voice or not, and she's the only one here.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ole	I guess they were all a little drunk, for they got to seeing how near they could make the girls dance to the edge of the cliff. [MASK]--he was the girl's husband--seemed the jolliest and the drunkest of anybody.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Bowers	[MASK] balanced the tablet on the end of his long forefinger and whistled softly. “And how did you form your conception of what a singer ought to be?” he asked. “I don't know.”
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Ray	I'll bring her as soon as I've had a look at you.” [MASK] looked up. “You might clean me up a trifle, doc. Won't need you for anything else, thank you all the same.”
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Fred	And you can't cry enough to spoil your face for more than ten minutes. It comes right back, in spite of you. It's only since you've known me that you've let yourself be beautiful.” Without rising she turned her face away. [MASK] went on impetuously.
<name>Wilson</name>	Wilson	Archie	Well, doctor, you'll have to let me get through that door. I was out last night, and I'm going to get my bacon, if you lose your mine.” He clapped [MASK] on the shoulder and pushed him along in front of him.
<name>Nellie</name>	Nellie	Thea	The important thing, he said, was to keep your feet warm. On very cold nights [MASK] always put a brick in the oven after supper, and when she went upstairs she wrapped it in an old flannel petticoat and put it in her bed.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Tillie	The young men--bank clerks, grocery clerks, insurance agents--played tricks, laughed at [MASK], and “put it up on each other” about seeing her home; but they often went to tiresome rehearsals just to oblige her. They were good-natured young fellows.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Thea	Some day I'll get up and find my hair turning gray, and I'll have nothing to show for it.” [MASK] slid closer to him and caught his arm. “No, no. I won't let you get gray.
<name>Della</name>	Della	Thea	When he went in to chat with her mother, [MASK] opened the bag cautiously, trying to keep it from crackling. She drew out a long bunch of white grapes, with a little of the sawdust in which they had been packed still clinging to them.
<name>Amory</name>	Amory	Archie	She shook him off before he could say anything more, and went out of his door with a kind of bound. She left so quickly and so lightly that he could not even hear her footstep in the hallway outside. [MASK] dropped back into his chair and sat motionless for a long while.
<name>her husband</name>	her husband	Thea	He reminded her of her children. “Yes,” she replied; “the children are all very well, but they are not father. We were married young.” The doctor watched her wonderingly as she went on knitting, thinking how much she looked like [MASK].
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Fred	“Yes, [MASK],” he went on seriously; “I thought it sounded very beautiful, and I thought she was very beautiful, too. I never imagined she could be as beautiful as that.” “Wasn't she?
<name>Lena</name>	Lena	Thea	“Ever since I came. I had to get a position of some kind,” [MASK] explained, flushing, “and the preacher took me on. He runs the choir himself. He knew my father, and I guess he took me to oblige.”
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Thea	[MASK], too, was drowsy, and lay looking through halfclosed eyes up at the blazing blue arch over the rim of the canyon. She was thinking of nothing at all. Her mind, like her body, was full of warmth, lassitude, physical content.
<name>Mowgli</name>	Mowgli	FLUSTERN?--to	“[MASK] whisper. You must begin now to know such things. That is necessary. How many birthdays?” “Thirteen. I'm in my 'teens now. But how can I know words like that? I only know what you say at my lessons.
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Archie	[MASK] looked rather self-conscious, as he sat down on a fragile gilt chair that rocked under him, and stretched out his long legs. “Well, if you'll believe me, I had the brutality to go to see her. I wanted to identify her.
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Thea	The church itself was a very neat little building. The parsonage, next door, looked clean and comfortable, and there was a well-kept yard about it, with a picket fence. [MASK] saw several little children playing under a swing, and wondered why ministers always had so many.
<name>Christine</name>	Christine	Archie	Some one spoke to her; she only inclined her head. He spoke again, and she bowed her head still lower. [MASK] had forgotten his libretto, and he had not counted upon these long pauses. He had expected her to appear and sing and reassure him.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Paulina	Stay you in the bed, [MASK].” The dresser had lost its casters years ago, but he managed to drag it in front of the door. “He is in the garden. He makes nothing. He will get sick again, may-be.”
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Thea	he sang softly, playing the melody with his right hand. [MASK], who was turning over the pages of the third act, stopped and scowled at a passage. The old German's blurred eyes watched her curiously.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Thea	[MASK] dressed without building a fire. The morning shone like a holiday, and for her it was to be a holiday. There was in the air that sudden, treacherous softness which makes the Poles who work in the packing-houses get drunk.
<name>Mr. Stevens</name>	Mr. Stevens	Harsanyi	[MASK] stood looking at his pupil's back, bent as if she were pushing something, at her lowered head. “You can sing for those people because with them you do not commit yourself. But the reality, one cannot uncover THAT until one is sure.
<name>Buck Mulligan</name>	Buck Mulligan	Fred	[MASK] dusted his hands and began tucking in the blouse of his shirt, “I'm going to make some single-sticks and teach you to fence. You'd be all right there. You're light and quick and you've got lots of drive in you.
<name>Red</name>	Red	Ray	He made you want to come back at him. You weren't always being caught up and mystified. When you started in with him, you went; you cut the breeze, as [MASK] used to say. He had some go in him.
<name>he</name>	he	Wunsch	You were, but [MASK] wasn't, and I wasn't. I suppose I'm here because I married as soon as I got out of medical school and had to get a practice quick. If you hurry things, you always get left in the end.
<name>Lily</name>	Lily	Thea	“I'm not ungrateful,” [MASK] repeated as she got into her cab. “Yes,” she reflected, as the taxi cut into the Park carriage road, “we don't get fairy tales in this world, and he has, after all, cared more and longer than anybody else.”
<name>He</name>	He	Ottenburg	She did the right thing there.” [MASK] drew out his watch. “Hello! I must be traveling. You hear from her regularly?” “More or less regularly. She was never much of a letter-writer.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Fred	“Is [MASK] in town? They were from him, then--some flowers that came last night without a card.” She indicated the white lilacs on the window sill. “Yes, he would know, certainly,” she said thoughtfully.
<name>she</name>	she	Thea	I guess you see through 'em. Still, even if [MASK] ain't apt to have children of her own, I don't know as that's a good reason why she should wear herself out on other people's.” “That's just the point, mother.
<name>her husband</name>	her husband	Fred	That is, she had no intellectual humor; no power to enjoy the absurdities of people, no relish of their pretentiousness and inconsistencies--which only depressed her. But her joviality, [MASK] felt, was an asset, and ought to be developed.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Ray	She was sitting on the floor of the car, crouching like a little animal about to spring. “No occasion for you to see,” he said warmly. “There'll always be plenty of other people to take the knocks for you.” “That's nonsense, [MASK].”
<name>dear</name>	dear	Thea	“But poor fellows like that tramp--” she hesitated and wrinkled her forehead. The doctor leaned forward and put his hand protectingly over hers, which lay clenched on the green felt desktop. “Ugly accidents happen, [MASK]; always have and always will.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Fred	[MASK] was on his mettle in an instant. He pinned both her arms down and kissed her resolutely. When he released her, she turned away and spoke over her shoulder. “That was mean of you, but I suppose I deserved what I got.”
<name>no one</name>	no one	Fred	If she had that, she could sing. When she felt so keenly alive, lying on that insensible shelf of stone, when her body bounded like a rubber ball away from its hardness, then she could sing. This, too, she could explain to [MASK].
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Thea	The reverse was there,--it stared me in the face,--but I couldn't pull it. I let you drive ahead.” He threw out his hands. What [MASK] noticed, oddly enough, was the flash of the firelight on his cuff link. He turned again.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Thea	[MASK] looked intently at the music. “I see,” she said dully. “Oh, I see!” she repeated quickly and turned to him a glowing countenance. “It is the river.--Oh, yes, I get it now!”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Ray	[MASK] was a loyal-hearted fellow, and it had cost him a great deal to give up his God. He was one of the stepchildren of Fortune, and he had very little to show for all his hard work; the other fellow always got the best of it.
<name>Jay Gatsby</name>	Jay Gatsby	Ottenburg	[MASK] was in evening clothes and very pointed dress shoes. His white waistcoat, upon which the doctor had fixed a challenging eye, went down straight from the top button, and he wore a camelia. He was conspicuously brushed and trimmed and polished.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Fred	[MASK] started up. “My God, haven't you seen her this blessed night?--when she'd have kicked any other man down the elevator shaft, if I know her. Leave me something; at least what I can pay my five bucks for.”
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Fred	I lived through it. I have no choice now. No matter how much it breaks me up, I have to go. Do I seem to enjoy it?” [MASK] bent over her trunk and picked up something which proved to be a score, clumsily bound.
<name>Mr. Guppy</name>	Mr. Guppy	Thea	You are still determined to call on him?” He sat down tentatively in the chair [MASK] had indicated. “I don't see why you won't borrow from me, and let him sign with you, for instance. That would constitute a perfectly regular business transaction.
<name>Zaroff</name>	Zaroff	Harsanyi	I like that song.” That evening at dinner [MASK] sat looking intently into a glass of heavy yellow wine; boring into it, indeed, with his one eye, when his face suddenly broke into a smile.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Thea	“Oh, several weeks, if you'll let me stay. I won't hang around and be a burden to you, but I want to try to get educated up to you, though I expect it's late to begin.” [MASK] rose and touched him lightly on the shoulder.
