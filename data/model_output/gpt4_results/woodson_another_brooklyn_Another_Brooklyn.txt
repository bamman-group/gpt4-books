<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Angela	We slow-danced with each other. [MASK] showed us how to French-kiss and we spent hours practicing. We practiced until our bodies felt as though they were exploding. We whispered, I love you and meant it. We said, This is scary and laughed.
<name>Yunior</name>	Yunior	Jerome	He’s too fine to let slip away. Forget you then, [MASK] said finally. Forget you. Forget me. I held on to my body and my brother held on to his faith, finally pulling my father back into it.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Sylvia	I see everything. You’re the one without a mother, aren’t you? [MASK] touched my cheek, her mouth so close I could smell her wild cherry Life Saver. No. That’s not me. It was years before the woman with the hijab.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Poncho	The front gate first—Stay inside it. Keep it closed. Then to the tree in the middle of the block. Then to the stop sign on the corner. Around the corner to [MASK]’s bodega, but only together. Hold your brother’s hand.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Sylvia	So we looked away and headed home. In class, [MASK]'s empty seat reminded us of her father, his arms folded across his chest, his glare a reminder of a power that was becoming more and more familiar to us. A power we neither had nor understood.
<name>Sonny</name>	Sonny	Sylvia	[MASK] lived deep inside of those notes, halfway hidden from all of us. They got some hungry women there and man, they’ll really make a mess out of you____ You have to be a singer, we said. You have to!
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jennie	I searched for the children’s names in the paper, wondering if they had been [MASK]’s children. At the end of the night, we pressed against our boyfriends, fingers locked together, slow swaying as the DJ announced, We about to shut this party down, y’all.
<name>Keisha</name>	Keisha	Gigi	Meet my mom. Hey, we said, struck silent by a woman so young and beautiful she could have been on the cover of Ebony or a centerfold in Jet magazine. Hey yourselves, [MASK] s mother said.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	SweetGrove	A hole closing up beneath him. We only knew [MASK] and the words that ended every fairy tale our mother read to us. We lived in our own happily ever after. But after her brother died, my mother began disappearing.
<name>ferocity</name>	ferocity	Charlsetta	And we laughed until the beating became legendary, a warning to all of us that this kind of public humiliation was only one belt-whipping away. There was some [MASK] buried in each of us. She got a baby inside her, her brother finally admitted.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Gigi	Take somebody with you, we said. Don’t wear dresses when you go there. He’ll offer you a quarter to see your panties. When we weren't practicing walking in [MASK]’s mother’s shoes, we were little girls in Mary Janes and lace-up sneakers.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Sylvia	For several slow seconds, the years fell away and she was [MASK] again, nearly fifteen in her St. Thomas Aquinas school uniform—green and blue plaid skirt, white blouse, and plaid cross bow tie, her belly just beginning to round.
<name>Allah</name>	Allah	Allah	All praise to [MASK], I said. My brother drove me to the subway, kissed my forehead, and hugged me hard. When had he become a man? For so long, he had been my little brother, sweet and solemn, his eyes open wide to the world.
<name>August</name>	August	Sylvia	Why do you think my mother has died? Three months passed before I saw [MASK] again. She was wearing her school uniform, her belly pushing against the buttons. She waved to me from across the street, two-way traffic between us. August!
<name>the Universe</name>	the Universe	Sylvia	It stayed that way for days and days. Law. No one had this dream for me. No one held out a hand saying. Here, take this. So I told my secrets to [MASK] with the hope that I’d get something in return.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Fading	Memory like a bruise. [MASK]. She’s coming tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow. Don’t wade in the water, children. Your mama’s done troubled the water. Our land moved in grassy waves toward the water. The land ended at the water.
<name>Allen</name>	Allen	Sylvia	They got some hungry women there and man, they’ll really make a mess out of you____ You have to be a singer, we said. You have to! After law, [MASK] said. We tried to hold on.
<name>Antoine</name>	Antoine	Jerome	And because I wanted it so much, I told her about my secret love, how [MASK] and I met in my vestibule some evenings, his hands everywhere, his lips on my mouth, neck, breasts. How I had to stand on the upper stair to reach him.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Sylvia	Photos of the four girls lined a room reserved just for sitting. There was a pool table in the basement, a refrigerator that dispensed ice. The two oldest sisters had already left for, as [MASK]’s father called it, University.
<name>Emmett</name>	Emmett	Perch	Behind my brother and me, my father was saying that it was time to move on now, but none of us moved from where we were standing. Wind came up, shuddering the leaves. The person in the canoe had stopped paddling and now cast a line into the water. [MASK].
<name>David</name>	David	Sylvia	How I had to stand on the upper stair to reach him. How he looked outside for grown-ups before leaving my building. [MASK]'s world felt delicate and foreign. Mother and father in one city, one home. Each room spare and clean.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Angela	I promised her we’d go with her. But [MASK] shook her head, her straightened hair hot curled into a mushroom low over her brow and ears. She stared straight ahead at the fireworks. Nab, she said. Ya’ll won’t.
<name>Yolanda</name>	Yolanda	Angela	Then closed it again. And stayed that way for a long, long time. On the third morning, my father took the day off from work and took [MASK] to the police station. This child’s mama, he said, seems to be missing.
<name>Allah</name>	Allah	Allah	I’ve been sent by the prophet Elijah, in the name of [MASK], he said, with a message for you, my beautiful black brother. The man looked at me, his eyes moving slowly over my bare legs. You’re a black queen, he said.
<name>her</name>	her	Clydes	Did she still call [MASK] name in the night, curse my father, walk through the land that used to belong to her, walk down to the water and believe it belonged to her still? Come with me, I said to my brother again and again.
<name>Tyrone</name>	Tyrone	August	I’m good! What—you got a man over there you don’t want me to meet? I laughed. Still doing the Devil, I bet. I slapped at him and got out of the car. Love you. Love you, too, [MASK].
<name>She</name>	She	Angela	Then just as quickly, she pulled her arms in, her hands closing, her eyebrows twisting with such ferocity, I took a step away from her. What? I said. What is it? But [MASK] just shrugged, shoved her hands into her pockets, and shook her head.
<name>Adeline</name>	Adeline	Sylvia	A grown-up, I answered. She and my father laughed and laughed. But listening to [MASK]’s father, I felt myself straightening my back, tilting my chin up. Law, I wanted to say, like you. I want truth, I wanted to say.
<name>Mami</name>	Mami	Sweetie	So many brown and black men, who could know? my mother said. It could have been anybody. He told me. Another nurse wanted to know if I was all right. Your brother will be fine, she said. Everything’s going to be all right, [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Angela	In the only light coming in from a streetlamp, I stared at her and saw deep beneath the smooth cheeks and broad nose, there she was—there was the woman staggering past us with her thin face, nearly toothless mouth, and [MASK]’s eyes.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Sylvia	It’s against the rules to laugh like that, she said finally. I’m supposed to know were better than that. But you always laugh that way, we said. Not always, [MASK] said. Not here. The parents questioned us. Who were our people?
<name>Tasha</name>	Tasha	Charlsetta	The whole block had heard the yelling. We had watched her mother leaving the house for work in the morning, stern-faced and stiff-backed. [MASK] got her behind beat last night, we said to each other. Her mother tore her up.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Sylvias	How the hell would I even know. Maybe this is how it happened first for everyone— adults promising us their own failed futures. I was bright enough to teach, my father said, even as my dream of stepping into [MASK] skin included one day being a lawyer.
<name>Jess</name>	Jess	Gigi	What keeps keeping us here? [MASK] asked one day, the rain coming down hard, her shirt torn at the shoulder. We didn’t know that for weeks and weeks, the lock had been broken on her building’s front door.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Sylvia	We felt we had snuck into a party we had not been invited to. We feared breaking the china plates lined along the mantelpiece, speaking too loudly, laughing with our mouths open. Each side-eye glance from [MASK]’s mother reminded us of how truly unworthy we were.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Trout	[MASK]. Maybe catfish but I’m not sure. This is memory. I watched the water slowly lap back and forth against the shore. The sun was beginning to set. I took my brother’s hand and held it.
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Allah	I told her to be patient, that with [MASK], all things were possible. 11 We turned thirteen and it seemed wherever we were, there were hands and tongues. There were sloe-eyes and licked lips wherever our new breasts and lengthening thighs moved.
<name>Zahra</name>	Zahra	Jerome	The woman’s office was small and smelled of musk oil. Beneath her hijab, her face was unlined and calm, so that at certain angles, she looked no older than [MASK]. Brother, she said to my father. Sister, he replied softly.
<name>silhouette</name>	silhouette	DNA	My father, brother, and I were different from this. I went through my days connected to them, but inside myself, holding my brother, laughing with my father, always deeply aware of their presence. But it was a presence in shadow, a presence etched in [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Angela	Park swings, handball courts, the spot of sun on the corner where a windowless factory set dozens of pale, tired women free every day at 5:00 p.m. [MASK] said, My mother said don’t tell a soul But we didn’t have to open our mouths.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Jennie	It’s absolute. Late in the autumn, the woman returned for [MASK]’s children. She carried the little one out in her arms, the older one, skipping ahead, not looking back, the baby screaming. What the hell is going on?
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Sylvia	Then, saying nothing, he left. We stayed up late, watching television sitcoms, eating Popsicles and bags of candy. [MASK] and I wore baby-doll pajamas that felt obscene and made us giddy. We slow-danced with each other.
<name>Yolanda</name>	Yolanda	Gigi	When I’m an actress, [MASK] said, I’ll be everywhere—TV, movie screen, onstage. Who’s that? Who’s that? When it wasn’t wavering around doubt, her voice was deep and sure, and we wanted that, too— Who’s that?
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Jennie	When the woman left again, [MASK] knocked on our door. Please watch them, she whispered. I go get food. The children were tiny and silent, staring up at my brother and me with huge dark eyes. The girl might have been four and the boy not yet two.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Angela	The boy asks if I know her. She’s hot, he says. [MASK], I whisper. You made it. Behind my brother and me, my father was saying that it was time to move on now, but none of us moved from where we were standing.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sylvia	A power we neither had nor understood. When we saw [MASK] again a week later, she was wearing a St. Thomas Aquinas uniform, her older sister’s arm tight around her shoulder. She glanced at us, mouthed, Park later.
<name>Yolanda</name>	Yolanda	Gigi	The hair, too, her mother said, holding up [MASK]’s braids. Heavy and thick like hers. The only curse you carry, her mother said, is the dark skin I passed on to you. You gotta find a way past that skin.
<name>Malone</name>	Malone	Gigi	But when the soldier finally emerged from behind [MASK]’s stairs, it was not with a single-edged blade protruding from his neck but with a needle clinched and dripping from his left hand. He had been dead three days when the super found him.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Sugar	Slide a curtain back and there’s a baby crying. Slide another one and there’s the girl with the crazily hanging arm. Curtains and children. Nurses and noise. Where was my brother? You enjoying those cookies, [MASK], the nurse asked.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	August	Women had been found dead before—in hallways, in basements, in the unlit corners of subway platforms. Sometimes, as we walked the streets, we imagined our own selves found somewhere. How long would it take to know? Who would be the first to ask, Have you seen [MASK]?
<name>Natalie</name>	Natalie	Angela	The movie is about a dancer hungry for the lead role in La Sylphide, as her fiance runs off and her own real life mirrors the story. [MASK] is stunning as she dances across the stage, her body thinner than I remember, but muscled and able.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Angela	She’s not dead, [MASK], I whispered. They have the wrong person. When she pulled away from us days later, we didn't know to yank her back. We didn't say Wait! We said We love you. We said See you tomorrow.
<name>Caution</name>	Caution	Allah	[MASK] had prevailed. The shards of glass could have landed on others below. A vein could have been hit. My brother could have lost his arm. My father could have chosen that evening to take a long walk around the neighborhood, maybe stop after work for a drink.
<name>Emilia</name>	Emilia	Jennie	I I -?k- 12 ~^st I looked for [MASK]’s children in the faces of strangers. The terrified girl with her hand closed tight around pieces of bologna, the boy with his too-small shoes. The night the woman came to take them, they had cried late into the day.
<name>Connor</name>	Connor	Jerome	The way this me-and-[MASK] thing happened. Don’t he mad. You guys broke up. I was gonna tell you. What about law? I wanted to ask. What about your father? The question vast as the silence between us: What about me?
<name>Blue</name>	Blue	Sylvia	[MASK] came closer to me. Really, I’m asking what are you seeing? When you look at us? I’m not trying to he mean. Everything, I said. I see everything. You’re the one without a mother, aren’t you?
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Sylvia	In the morning, she pulled my father's robe together at her breasts, made instant coffee, and sat at our kitchen table, smoking. Oh just do it, [MASK] said. He’s too fine to let slip away.
<name>Our father</name>	Our father	Clyde	Our mother was sad-eyed and long-limbed like my father, with graceful hands that always seemed to be reaching for something or someone. When [MASK] died, those hands slowed, lifted away from her body less often, rarely reached for us.
<name>Keisha</name>	Keisha	Sylvia	Body turning to ash. Maybe [MASK] thought I was coming toward her, ready to hug away the years and forget. Maybe she had already forgotten, the way years allow us to. You look good, girl, she said. The train doors opened.
<name>Leila</name>	Leila	Sylvia	Still, it wasn’t the skin or the eyes or the voice I wanted. I simply wanted to be [MASK], to walk through the world as she did, watch the world through her eyes. Is that girl laughing at us, my brother had asked that first time.
<name>Lenin</name>	Lenin	Malcolm	When had he become a man? For so long, he had been my little brother, sweet and solemn, his eyes open wide to the world. Now, behind small wire-rimmed glasses, he looked like a figure out of history. [MASK] maybe.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Clyde	For weeks before, my father and mother had argued. My mother swore shed bring the butcher knife to bed and sleep with it under her pillow. [MASK] told me about you being with that woman last night, my mother said.
<name>Tina</name>	Tina	Sylvia	When I tiptoed into the living room, the woman lying on his sofa bed pulled the covers up over herself but not before I saw the size of her breasts, the dark nipples. You his baby girl? the woman asked. [MASK]’s father had a plan for her.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Sylvia	Please God Please until her father lowered his gun, said, Go home to the God you believe in and don’t ever come to my door again. He didn’t know he had already lost [MASK]. It hurt like hell, she whispered to us.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Sylvia	But I got off anyway. Years erase us. [MASK] sinking back into the dust of the world before I knew her, her baby gone, then her belly, then breasts, and finally only the deep gap in my life where she had once been.
<name>Shrugged</name>	Shrugged	Gigi	Shrugged, Said, Why you have to be all up in my business? Said, Kind of. Said, Damn, why’s it all have to be so complicated, you know? She put her face in [MASK] s hair and shook until she cried.
<name>She</name>	She	Angela	My mom was a dancer, she told us, then quickly grew silent. Does she still dance, we asked. But [MASK] turned away from us. Shrugged, Said, Why you have to be all up in my business? Said, Kind of.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Angelas	Before I knew their names, I knew the tiny bones at the back of their necks, the tender curve of their hairlines. I knew each Peter Pan-collared shirt and turtleneck they owned. I knew [MASK] scowl as she waited in line in the lunchroom.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Sylvia	Promises—of things they could do to us, with us, for us. When [MASK] threatened to run away, her father said we could stay over. He asked to call our parents, make sure they knew where we were.
<name>Emmy</name>	Emmy	Sylvia	When we asked, What do you love? [MASK] looked around her perfectly pink room and said, I’m not the boss of me. How the hell would I even know. Maybe this is how it happened first for everyone— adults promising us their own failed futures.
<name>Tasha</name>	Tasha	Angela	This would never happen to us, we thought. We knew this could never be us. Some days, [MASK]’s eyes were narrow and distant. When we asked what was wrong, she said, Nothing! God, why y’all hounding me like I’m a dog!
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	August	Squared, he said, is absolute. No one in the world can argue algebra or geometry. No one can say pi is wrong. Come with me, I begged. But my brother looked up from his numbers and said, She’s gone, [MASK].
<name>Trayvon</name>	Trayvon	Alafia	[MASK] can sit at the table, just not allowed to stand at the stove and cook. But I got us. It’s all good. A minute passed. I miss him, he said. I miss you.
<name>Adelina</name>	Adelina	Sylvia	This America thing you keep talking and talking about. At four, [MASK] was reading books assigned to her eight-year-old sister. At five, she was made to stay after school with ten-year-olds, cracking codes in long division, searching Latin word origins.
<name>he</name>	he	Jerome	We said, This is scary and laughed. When [MASK] asked where Id learned what I learned I said. Don’t worry about it because he was eighteen and I was nearly fourteen and nothing mattered but hearing I love you and believing he meant it.
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Alana	It’s us. We have food upstairs. We can play hide-and-seek. Please open the door, we said. We can take you someplace better. We were not poor but we lived on the edge of poverty. [MASK] moved in across the street.
<name>Yolanda</name>	Yolanda	Sylvias	One morning, [MASK] first boyfriend showed up at her door. He was tall and brown-skinned, the captain of the neighborhood high school basketball team. Please wait a moment, her father said. When he came back, he pointed a .22 at her boyfriend's chest.
<name>Yunior</name>	Yunior	Angela	Where did your hands go, [MASK]? I wanted to tell her that when her fingers were still like that, my mother reappeared. At that moment, a woman had staggered past us slowly, fighting against a nod, her hand swollen and veinless.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Gigi	The government owns the pecan trees now. What had once been my family’s has been taken. By the government. We came by way of our mothers’ memories. When [MASK] was six years old, her mother pulled her in front of the mirror.
<name>Judy</name>	Judy	Sylvia	During the last verse of "I Don’t Know How to Love Him” a crack in her voice echoed through the auditorium. Everyone laughed, I’d heard later. The whole auditorium. Everyone. We didn’t mean to. We didn’t know... [MASK] hadn’t shown.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Angela	It happened, [MASK] said. I’m bleeding. Finally, we said. We thought you’d never join us on this side, we said. We were teenagers now, our bodies different but all of us still the same height, all of us still blending into each other.
<name>Yvette</name>	Yvette	Angela	Before we knew it was her mother, [MASK] spent three nights at my house, the two of us curled together on the pullout sofa, my father in my bed. Her hair smelled of sweat and Royal Crown hair grease, her breath coming fast, even when she was sound asleep.
<name>God</name>	God	Allah	She said, I think I can handle this if this is what [MASK] has planned for me. She came in the daytime, mop and bucket in hand, and showed me how to pull on yellow rubber gloves.
<name>Antares</name>	Antares	Gigi	When it wasn’t wavering around doubt, her voice was deep and sure, and we wanted that, too— Who’s that? Who’s that? we echoed, laughing, our hands on her head, in her hair. That’s that big star, [MASK].
<name>Toni</name>	Toni	Angela	She just looked up at our window and laughed. Shush, I said. She isn’t even anybody. I was beginning to hate them. I was beginning to love them. Sometimes, [MASK] stood apart from the others, biting fiercely at her nails, her short Afro dripping.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Angela	After speaking to my father, he said. He’s a good man. He has his God. A man needs his God. He eyed [MASK], the torn sweater, the hole in the toe of her dingy socks.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sylvia	I was thirteen the first time we went further than the kisses we stole in the dark of my vestibule. Only [MASK] knew. Give this back to me, I wanted to say to her. I want your promised future filling up the empty space ahead of me.
<name>Jackson</name>	Jackson	Sylvia	I truly believed they were standing steadily in the world. I watched them, wanting to have what they had—six feet planted. Right here. Right now. That year, before we all grew to one height, [MASK] was the tallest.
<name>Delilah</name>	Delilah	Promises	[MASK] shed find me again. So much air around the lies distance allowed us to tell as she sank back into the world she had become a part of, a world of dancers and actors—redrawn into royalty without a past.
<name>Rosa</name>	Rosa	Sylvia	When we arrived late in the afternoon, he stood at the door. No company today, he said to us. [MASK] needs to get ready for her new school. Go home, he said. Study. Become somebody better than you are.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Sylvia	He leaned down then, and kissed me. Who could understand how terrifying and perfect it is to be kissed by a teenage boy? Only your girls, I thought. Only your girls. [MASK] was the baby of four sisters. Piano lessons. Dance lessons.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Gigi	The coats over the seats [MASK] had saved for us remained there until her castmates took theirs and only hers remained. Two steps to the left or right or back or front and you're standing outside your life. Someone’s friend knew someone who lived at the Chelsea Hotel.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Clyde	Her brother [MASK] wasn’t dead yet. He was sitting at our kitchen table smoking a Pall Mall and telling stories. We knew this only because he always smoked and we could hear our mother, ever so often laughing and saying.
<name>Carmen</name>	Carmen	Jennie	A woman named [MASK] moved into the apartment below us. She was dark and reedy and wore a long, black wig that stopped at the middle of her back. When she spoke, her voice lilted up. Most of what she said was in Spanish.
<name>She</name>	She	Gigi	Please, the quarter, held up and gleaming between his thumb and pointer finger as we shook our heads No and embarrassed tears we didn't yet understand sprang forward. The pastor at my church comes up behind me sometimes when I’m singing in choir, [MASK] said.
<name>Latisha</name>	Latisha	Charlsetta	[MASK] had been sent away. She was sixteen, captain of the Thomas Jefferson cheerleaders. She had a straightened ponytail and bangs oiled and spiraling over her forehead. For weeks, we asked her younger brother where shed gone. The whole block had heard the yelling.
<name>Marlboro</name>	Marlboro	Winston	None of us asked where she’d gotten the joint or the [MASK] matchbook. We circled around her and watched her take the smoke deep into her lungs, hold it, then exhale. We followed her lead, the smoke hot and hard against the back of my throat.
<name>Spiderman</name>	Spiderman	Jumped	There was the rope of ivy on her windowsill, the leaves moving neatly along the ledge and down. There were gates on the windows, even though her office was only on the seventh floor. Had anyone ever vaulted past her? [MASK]? I looked up at her.
<name>Tina</name>	Tina	Gigi	We were twelve. I can’t tell anybody but you guys, [MASK] said. My mom will say it was my fault. We twisted the long braids up into a crown, used oil and a comb to etch the fine baby hair over her forehead.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Gigi	I sat there, the apartment silent, growing hot inside my coat. I sat there long after the play had ended. [MASK] faltered. During the last verse of "I Don’t Know How to Love Him” a crack in her voice echoed through the auditorium.
