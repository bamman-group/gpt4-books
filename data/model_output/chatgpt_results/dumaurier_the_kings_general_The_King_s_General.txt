<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Matty	“Go back, [MASK],” I said, “and see what you can do to help my sister. None of the servants have any sense left in their heads.” She had not been gone more than ten minutes before I saw two figures coming across the fields towards me.
<name>a brother</name>	a brother	Dick	“I’d rather keep the splinters and bear the pain.” “It will give you an excuse, at any rate, for your bad temper,” she replied. She washed the wound and dressed it once again, and all the while he held my hand as [MASK] might do.
<name>John</name>	John	Matty	I was well-nigh desperate, now that the house was beginning to stir, and the children beginning to talk in the adjoining chamber. “Very well, then,” I said. “Open the door, [MASK]. Call the troopers.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Dick	“But,” he said slowly, “the blood makes a pretty mess upon the straw.” I saw [MASK] grip his ankle with his hand, and I turned like a fury on the man I loved. “Will you be silent?” I said.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	John	But my mind was far too lively to find sleep for several hours. I kept trying to remember the formation of the house, seen from without, and what it was that struck me as peculiar the day before, when [MASK] had wheeled me in my chair towards the gatehouse.
<name>Queen Victoria</name>	Queen Victoria	Parliament	He glanced at the half-open door of the gallery. A queer, instinctive move, unnecessary when the few servants that we had could all be trusted. Yet since we had been ruled by [MASK] this gesture would be force of habit. “Have you heard anything?”
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Robin	Ours is the dull, drab life of day by day. Looking back, there can be very few amongst our friends who have not suffered. So many gone, so many penniless. I do not forget that [MASK] and I both live on charity.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jack	I won’t stay here and have that hopeless nincompoop [MASK] Berkeley obstruct every move I make. He is hand in glove with your blasted brother, that’s the trouble.” “You began the trouble,” I said, “by making an enemy of my brother.
<name>Bertha</name>	Bertha	John	The little stairway, set inside the buttress, twisted steeply to the cell below, which had height enough for a man to stand upright. More I could not see, craning from my chair, save for a dark heap that must be [MASK] lying on the lower step.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Richard	The pace will be too strong for her.” “What?” said [MASK], his face falling. “You are coming, aren’t you?” “Why, yes,” I said swiftly. “I will see you kill your heron.”
<name>Tess</name>	Tess	Richard	“Let her sleep, [MASK], and me also.” “I only wished to tell you her remark to me on leaving. ‘So it is true, what I have always heard,’ she said to me, ‘that Cornishmen are famed for one thing only, which is wrestling.’
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	Honor	He did not answer for a moment, and when he did I saw his eyes look large and black in his pale face, even as they had done as a boy four years before. “I tell you one thing, [MASK],” he said passionately.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Joan	And at that moment my godchild [MASK] came hurrying along the causeway to fetch me, her pretty face all strained and anxious, her soft dark hair blowing in the wind. “They are coming,” she said. “We have seen them from the windows.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Joan	[MASK] shut the window, for the smoke from the campfires blew thick about the room, and the noise of the men shouting and calling orders made a vile and sickening clamour. The sun set in a dull crimson sky and the shadows lengthened.
<name>Mrs. Joe</name>	Mrs. Joe	Matty	The sun set in a dull crimson sky and the shadows lengthened. About half past eight [MASK] brought us a small portion of a pie upon one plate, with a carafe of water. Her lips were grimly set. “This for the two of you,” she said.
<name>RECOUNT</name>	RECOUNT	SURVEY	The play goes on, then—what you have just read is but the prologue. (TT IS NOT MY PURPOSE TO [MASK], IN THESE AFTER YEARS, the suffering, bodily and mental, that I underwent during those early months when my life seemed finished.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Fairfax	“And your uncle?” “He will remain, I fear, at the Mount. He has no other choice. But [MASK] is a soldier and a gentleman. He will receive fair treatment.” This was no answer for me.
<name>General Zaroff</name>	General Zaroff	Elizabeth	“But man for man we are superior,” urged [MASK]. “Everyone says that. The rebels are well equipped, no doubt, but when our fellows meet them face to face in fair fight, in open country...”
<name>John</name>	John	John	There was a dull smouldering smell, and a wisp of smoke blew past the windows of the gallery. “They are setting fire,” said [MASK] quietly, “to the stables and the farm buildings before the house.”
<name>Monte Cristo</name>	Monte Cristo	Richard	“Come,” said [MASK]. “I will show you. A jailer should have knowledge of the cell where she puts her prisoners.” He took me in his arms and, crawling sideways, dragged me through the little stone entrance to the steps and down to the cell below.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jonathan	We came to the end of the causeway, and were about to turn in through the gate into the walled gardens when her little son [MASK], a child of barely three years, came running across the path to greet us.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Jonathan	“Yes, [MASK], and with interest.” I found myself getting hot under the skin, not at the implied sarcasm of his words, but because his revelation was so very different from what I—with excess of imagination—had supposed.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Matty	I came abreast of the door and waited once again. The picture that [MASK] had hung over the crack was on a level with my eye. I blew out my candle, trusting to fortune to blunder my way back to bed when my curiosity was satisfied.
<name>Mrs. Dubose</name>	Mrs. Dubose	Gartred	He looked across at me as though to ask a question, and I nodded to him, summoning a smile. We sat there waiting, no one with the heart or strength to speak. A little apart from us, near the centre window, sat [MASK] with her daughters.
<name>Thorin</name>	Thorin	Richard	“I yield to no man,” said [MASK]’s nephew, “in my admiration for my uncle. He has the better of his opponents every time. But I wish he would guard his tongue.” “What,” I asked wearily, “are they disputing now?”
<name>Colin</name>	Colin	John	At five o’clock word went round the house that we were every one of us to descend to the gallery. Even [MASK], from his sickbed, must obey the order. The rest had little strength enough to drag their feet, and I found difficulty holding to my chair.
<name>Master</name>	Master	Dick	“I shall be eighteen in two months’ time,” he answered, smiling. “Have you forgotten? You wrote the first year for my birthday, but never since.” “Writing has not been possible, [MASK], these past two years.”
<name>Lucie</name>	Lucie	Gartred	“Good-bye, [MASK].” She went, throwing her veil back from her face to show the vivid scar, and I have not seen her from that day to this. I heard the troopers ride away from the courtyard and out across the park.
<name>The boy</name>	The boy	Peter	“I knew that all along, but it would make no difference,” he said. “It would,” I said, “after a little while.” [MASK] had a young voice, clear and gay, and his song was happy.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Mary	[MASK], God bless her ignorance, turned up her bewildered face to him. “I know nothing of any silver,” she said, “except the few pieces of plate we have kept of our own, which you now possess, having my keys.”
<name>Edmond</name>	Edmond	Richard	At once the captain of the guard, the castle walls, the frowning battlements, lost all significance. [MASK] was no more imprisoned there. “Thank you,” I said. “Good day.” And I saw the officer stare after me, and then return to his room beneath the gate.
<name>Age</name>	Age	Resignation	The middle years have me in thrall, and there is much to be said for them. [MASK] brings its own reward. The trouble is that I cannot read now as I used to do. At twenty-five, at thirty, books were my great consolation.
<name>Marmee</name>	Marmee	Alice	The rest had little strength enough to drag their feet, and I found difficulty holding to my chair. Nothing had passed our lips now but weak herb tea for two whole days. [MASK] looked like a ghost, for I think she had denied herself entirely for the sake of her three little girls.
<name>Bathsheba</name>	Bathsheba	Cecilia	The women, too, were not idle, many—like [MASK] at Mothercombe—-tearing strips of bed linen into bandages, and packing their storerooms with preserves for fear of siege. Arguments were fiercer then, I do believe, than later when the fighting was amongst us.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Gartred	“What a bunch of prizes,” he said, “for the sheriff of the duchy if he chose to call. Each one of you a traitor.” They stared at him, blankly, even [MASK], for once, slow to follow his swift mind.
<name>Larry</name>	Larry	Matty	Back and forth we went along the causeway, with [MASK] pushing my chair, and still no sign of a living soul, nothing but the cattle grazing on the farther hills and the ripple of a breeze blowing the corn upon the skyline.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Gartred	I know, because I saw my father pen the letter, laughing as he did so, with aunt [MASK] at his back.” I was silent at that. Goddamn them both, I thought, for cruelty.
<name>Edmund</name>	Edmund	John	She came to me with it in her hands in great perturbation, for, she said, [MASK] was already so much out of favour with his father for some neglect on the estate that she was loath now to tell him of her theft of the key, for fear it should bring him into greater trouble.
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Dick	Shaking all over and seeming not to know what has been happening. His head is burning hot, but his limbs are cold.” At least he was alive, and a wave of thankfulness swept over me. But from [MASK]’s description I realized what had happened.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Richard	[MASK] stared down at me, one eyebrow lifted. “What?” he said smiling. “Do you turn against me too?” For answer, I threw him the note I was clutching in my hand. It was smeared by now, and scarcely legible.
<name>her</name>	her	Matty	I looked at [MASK], and she looked at me. The thoughts chased round my head in wild confusion. “What hour is it?” I asked. “Near five o’clock,” she answered. “Four hours of daylight still,” I said.
<name>me</name>	me	Jo	“Do you think,” I said, “to win his affection in that way?” “I don’t ask for his affection,” he said. “I ask for his obedience.” “You were not harsh thus with [MASK].
<name>Aunt Alexandra</name>	Aunt Alexandra	Gartred	I give the remarks as [MASK] phrased them, but the veiled contempt, the mockery, the suggestion that because I was crippled I must be tucked down and in the dark by half past nine, this was in her voice and in her eyes as they swept over me.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Dick	“He is more likely,” I said, “to degrade you to the ranks.” He climbed through the entrance and knelt upon the stair, where [MASK] waited for him. “I’ll do your destruction for you,” he said.
<name>Matthew</name>	Matthew	Matty	My first thought was to send no answer, for he took my compliance so much for granted, but curiosity and a beating heart got the better of my pride, and I bade [MASK] show the visitor the orchard, but that he should not go too directly for fear of being seen from the house.
<name>Laertes</name>	Laertes	Richard	Their bare feet padded on the boards, their breath came quick and short, and they seemed, the two of them, like phantom figures, lunging, thrusting, now in moonlight and now in shadow, with no word uttered. “[MASK]... ”
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Honor	But not before I had caught a glimpse of the sharp corner of a step descending into darkness. I replaced the mat just as my godchild came into the summerhouse. “Well, [MASK],” she said, “have you seen all you have a mind to for the present?”
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Honor	“All your books and your possessions, [MASK], they will not spare them any more than ours.” There was reproach in her voice, and disillusionment, that her favourite aunt and godmother should show no sign of grief.
<name>Black Jack</name>	Black Jack	Richard	“Give me some tobacco,” he said. The youngster produced a pipe and pouch from his coat. “Yes, I hate the breed,” said [MASK], blowing a cloud of smoke across the table, “and nothing affords me greater pleasure than to see them trounced.
<name>nothing</name>	nothing	Dick	We must wait until the tale is verified.” “Then my father has been slain in battle?” “No, [MASK], nothing has been said of that. Do you wish me to continue reading?” “Yes, please, if you will do so.”
<name>Lady Catherine</name>	Lady Catherine	Gartred	And it’s he who has provided her the escort for today.” I smiled in spite of myself. However much I hated [MASK], I had to bow to the fashion in which she landed on her feet in all and every circumstance.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Gartred	“They’ve gone,” he said. “They’ve all ridden away. The house is bare, deserted.” I looked up at [MASK], and this time it was I who smiled, and I who spread my cards upon the table.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Robin	The rumour may be false, and yet...” He broke off in the middle of his speech and resumed his pacing of the room. Presently we heard [MASK] mount his horse and ride away. The hours wore on; the clock in the belfry struck twelve, and later one.
<name>Mrs. Danvers</name>	Mrs. Danvers	Matty	I remembered then that the closed-up door into the empty chamber did not meet the floor at its base but was raised two inches or so from the ground, for [MASK] had tried to look under it before she made the crack with the scissors.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Matty	I handed back the mirror to [MASK] with a sigh. “What do you make of it?” she asked. “In ten years,” I said, “I’ll be an old woman.” She sniffed and began to fold my garments on a chair.
<name>Horatio</name>	Horatio	Robin	He looked around the gallery, as though in search of someone. “[MASK] gone?” he asked. “I thought so. It was he, then, I saw, when I was skirting the sands, engaged in fighting with five of the enemy or more.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Matty	Impervious to man or situation, the clock beneath the belfry struck six, hammering its silly leaden notes with mechanical precision. [MASK] brushed the soot from my hair and changed my gown, and when she finished there came a tap upon the door.
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Joan	He was nothing if not methodical in his business. The volume marked “Wills” was nearest to me and surprisingly tempting to my hand. I looked over my shoulder and saw through the window that [MASK], humming a tune, was busily engaged in picking posies for her children.
<name>Canterbury</name>	Canterbury	Liskeard	I watched them, from a hiding place in the trees, pass away up the road to [MASK] in a cloud of dust “That’s over,” I said to myself. “That’s the last of them.
<name>Colonel John "Jack" H. Watson</name>	Colonel John "Jack" H. Watson	Richard	“Well, he’ll never prove that now,” said [MASK]. “I found him creeping about the Devon lanes disguised the other day and seized the occasion to arrest him as a spy. I’ve waited eleven years to catch that blackguard.”
<name>Miss Bingley</name>	Miss Bingley	Mary	They were all easier when he was from home. He kept an account of every penny spent, and any servant wasting food or produce was instantly dismissed. [MASK], my sister, was more liked, though she was said to be a tyrant in the stillroom.
<name>me</name>	me	Alice	So keep a cool temper, lady, for you’ll find no redress.” They stared us coolly in the face, and one of them favoured [MASK] with a bold, familiar stare and then whispered something in the ear of his companion.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Bunny	My aunt is dead, you know, and no one was there but the steward, and my cousin [MASK], and the others. My father made himself known to the steward, and since then many secret meetings have been held throughout the county.
<name>Mrs. Hudson</name>	Mrs. Hudson	Gartred	Have you forgotten that it only opened from the other side?” Had I forgotten? It was the one thing that I remembered. “Smoke them out,” said [MASK]. “It is the only way.” Yes, but she did not understand.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Matty	Long past your usual hour.” “Why, yes,” I said, “if you care to bring it,” feigning intensity upon my book, yet all the while counting the hours to darkness, and wondering with an anxious heart what had become of [MASK].
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Kit	The household were abed. I remember flitting like a little ghost before the windows. The casement of the guest chamber was open wide, and I heard [MASK]’s voice, louder than usual, lifted in argument. Some devil interest in me made me listen.
<name>General</name>	General	Richard	“I dare say,” said my eldest brother slowly, “that I should be very ill advised if I attempted to address to you, General, a single word of criticism, but...” “You would, sir,” said [MASK], “be extremely ill advised.”
<name>Godzilla</name>	Godzilla	Fairfax	When [MASK] chooses to strike he will find no opposition. This is the end.” Yes, I thought. This is the end. Many had fought and died, and all in vain. The bridges would not be blown now; the roads would not be guarded, nor the defences held.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Robin	There is so much to say, and so little time in which to say it. For I do not fool myself about the future. My own instinct, quite apart from [MASK]’s face, warns me that this autumn will be the last.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Richard	“Away with you now—he won’t be troubled with you.” The door of the dining room was open, and I heard more sound of talk and laughter, and [MASK]’s voice topping the rest.
<name>Count</name>	Count	Richard	[MASK] still lived. This was my first inquiry and the only thing that mattered. He was lodging at the hostelry in the cathedral square, where I immediately repaired. He had taken the whole building for his personal use and had a sentry before the door.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Bess	“Freckled, I suppose? A prancing miss?” “Nay. Rather studious and quiet. Dependable. She put me in mind of my mother. ‘[MASK],’ I said to her, ‘will you look after me in my declining years?’
<name>boys</name>	boys	Matty	It is not fit for any woman, let alone one as helpless as yourself. Deserters and stragglers are constantly abroad, robbing on the highway, and the thought of you here, with a few old men and [MASK], is a constant disturbance to our peace of mind.”
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	John	[MASK] heaped logs upon the fire and blew the candles, and the flames lit the long room from end to end, shining on the panelling and on the faces of us, one and all, as we sat around the hearth.
<name>Achilles</name>	Achilles	Richard	He came from his room, unshaven, buckling his sword, and I thought how [MASK] would have dealt with him. “I would be grateful,” I said to him, “if you could give a message from me to the governor.”
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Honor	“That is a lie, [MASK].” “Perhaps. What does it matter? There is no reason now to harp back on the past.” “There I agree with you. The past is over. But we have the future with us.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Bunny	[MASK] with eager, questing eyes, and a map of the coast under his arm. “Where are the beaches? Where are the landing places? No, I want no refreshment; I have work to do. I want to see the ground.”
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Matty	“Do you have as much pain now as when you were first hurt?” he said. “Sometimes,” I answered, “when the air is damp. [MASK] calls me her weatherglass.” “Can nothing be done for it?”
<name>Bates</name>	Bates	Jack	“His worse fault is his temper, and much, I think, had gone wrong that day to kindle it. Given reflection, he would have acted otherwise.” “He made no attempt, you know, sir,” cut in [MASK], “to resist arrest.
<name>June</name>	June	January	He said nothing to me, only waited to see what I would do. “Two years ago,” I said softly, “you disobeyed an order given you by your commander because of a private quarrel. That was in [MASK] ’46.
<name>Conan</name>	Conan	Robin	This is no time for any man to seek private vengeance in a quarrel. When men have sworn an oath to my command, I demand obedience.” Not one of them made answer. [MASK] gazed, limp and shattered, at the floor.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Robin	Thinking it was [MASK], I scrambled down from my apple tree and went to the stables, but when I arrived there I found the servant leading a strange horse to the stall—a fine gray—and I caught a glimpse of a tall figure passing into the house.
<name>Gwendolen</name>	Gwendolen	Gartred	I sat still in my chair with my back to the arras and bade them enter who knocked upon the door. It was [MASK]. She was wearing, if I remember right, a gown of emerald green, and there were emeralds round her throat and in her ears.
<name>Mammy</name>	Mammy	Matty	[MASK] carries me upstairs, and as she brushes my hair and ties the curling rags I think I am almost happy. A year has come and gone, and though we are defeated, we live, we still survive.
<name>John</name>	John	Bunny	That youngster who has just left us, [MASK], ran from his tutor last autumn, playing truant, that he might place himself at my disposal and hold a sword for this cause we all hold dear. I have no brief for myself. I am a soldier.
<name>Blackie</name>	Blackie	George	I said, “Do you speak to him in this way too?” “Oh, [MASK] and I are old friends,” he answered. “He does what he is told. He gives me no trouble. Look at those drunken fellows in the courtyard there.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Honor	“I have not yet decided. Two of the children are not well at home.” She rode abreast of me, that slow smile that I remembered on her face. “How are you, [MASK]?” “Well enough,” I answered.
<name>brother</name>	brother	Robin	“My trailer of the drum.” “You know that I am given up as lost to all perdition by good persons,” I said. “My family have cast me off and do not speak of me. Even my dear [MASK] is ashamed of his sister.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Richard	What a time to choose to pay old scores, [MASK], my lover, mocking and malevolent. The eve of a rising, and these six people in it to the hilt. There was something symbolic in the empty chair beside me.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Matty	We clung to one another in the darkness, and as I listened I could hear the steady thumping of her heart. (7LAY UPON MY BED UPSTAIRS FROM HALF PAST NINE UNTIL A quarter before twelve. When [MASK] came to rouse me the house was deadly still.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	John	This, then, was a new and hideous dilemma, for I had warned [MASK] not to attempt an entry to the chamber before I warned him, since I was confident at the time that I would be able to find the entrance from inside.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Richard	I wondered if I should confide my fears to [MASK] when he next came, or whether, in his ruthless fashion, he would immediately give orders to his men to break open the room and force the buttress, so bringing ruin, perhaps, to my brother-in-law and host.
<name>Hamish</name>	Hamish	Richard	I myself had had no word from [MASK] since the night I had bidden him good-bye before the battle, and now that he was engaged in a struggle with foe and former friends as well, I thought it best to keep silent.
<name>Robin</name>	Robin	Matty	I felt it as if he had been my own brother, but I was too stunned to weep for him. “They say,” said [MASK], “that he was struck down by a poleax, just as he and his men had won the day and the enemy were scattering.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Richard	I could not answer this, for reason was on his side. But I thought of the spring days, lost to me forever, and the apple blossom in the orchard. No maid could have had more tender or more intuitive a lover. “How was [MASK] violent?”
<name>Ernest</name>	Ernest	Jo	And his sister is very beautiful.” More than that I could not drag from him. But my brother [MASK], to whose rather sarcastic, penetrating mind I put the same question later in the day, expressed surprise at my ignorance.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Honor	I found that I could paint, [MASK]. I wished to make painting my trade. I had friends, too, fellows of my age, for whom I felt affection. But no. Painting was womanish, a pastime fit for foreigners.
<name>Victor</name>	Victor	Gartred	And to this I could give no answer, for I knew it to be true... The weather was cold and dreary, and I spent much of my time within my chamber, which was the same that [MASK] had been given eighteen months before.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	John	[MASK] did not answer, and it occurred to him perhaps, as it had to me, that his father might not want me for companion. We made a circle of the grounds, returning by the steward’s house and the bowling green, and so through the warren at the back to the outer court.
<name>his wife</name>	his wife	Gartred	He must take the companion that is thrust upon him.” Whether the place was rank with cobwebs, mould, or mildew, I neither knew nor cared. At least it would give concealment while the troopers came. And no one, not even [MASK], knew the secret.
