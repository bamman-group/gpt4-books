<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Flora	And even if any body had been so foolish as to do such a thing, they would have knocked upon the door - and not done it in this strange, secret way.” To these very reasonable arguments [MASK] made no reply.
<name>the Duke</name>	the Duke	Strange	Above them the thunder roared and the rain came down in torrents. From time to time deputations of bedraggled men approached the elm-tree and begged [MASK] to make it stop, but he only shook his head and said, “When the Duke tells me to stop, I shall.”
<name>Bertie</name>	Bertie	Strange	[MASK] frowned. “I am being watched. Spied upon!” “Are you indeed? And do you know by whom? “By a fairy and a butler!” “A butler, eh?” said his lordship, laughing.
<name>Mr. Worthing</name>	Mr. Worthing	Strange	[MASK]’s friends were glad to be assured that he did not intend to give up his comfortable houses, his good income and his servants to go and be a gypsy in the wind and the rain, but still very few of them were entirely comfortable with his new practices.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Childermass	The carriage came for him over an hour ago. I dare say he will be back shortly.” “No,” said [MASK], “that cannot be. He cannot have gone. Are you sure that he is not upstairs doing magic?”
<name>Mr. Utterson</name>	Mr. Utterson	Strange	[MASK] broke off and was silent a moment. “What was I saying? Oh, yes. Drawing teaches habits of close observation that will always be useful. Take that doorway for instance . . The footman looked at the doorway. “. . .
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Brewer	The wind shook the falling snow and made it spin and twist about. [MASK] made a sound as if something had disturbed him. Briefly, the snow and the shadows seemed to form a picture of a thin, dark man in a greatcoat and boots.
<name>Mrs. O'Leary</name>	Mrs. O'Leary	Lascelles	“Oh!” cried [MASK]. “You are all very bold, I must say, to discuss your thievery in front of me! What? You think I shall not speak out against you? On the contrary I shall see you all hanged!”
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Stephen	“Has it been in your family long, sir?” he asked, politely. “No, not long.” The gentleman snapped shut the box and put it in his pocket. Together, he and [MASK] admired his reflection in the mirror.
<name>him</name>	him	Strange	He made a few flourishing gestures with his club in what he hoped was a threatening manner. “What . . . ?” Upon the instant several of the crowd turned together and put their fingers to their lips. Another man came up to [MASK].
<name>John</name>	John	Greysteel	He did not look so frantic as he had the night before, but his eyes had the same haunted look. He regarded the doctor for a long moment without any sign of recognition. “[MASK],” he murmured at last. “What are you doing here?”
<name>Basil</name>	Basil	Strange	“There is no mirror in that part of my library.” “Artists are tricky fellows, sir, forever reshaping the world according to some design of their own,” said [MASK]. “Indeed they are not unlike magicians in that.
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Wellington	Someone else suggested a gravel road. But that, thought [MASK], was liable to the same objection as a chalk road: it would become a river of mud in the rain - and the Portuguese did seem to think that it would rain again tomorrow.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Birds	Even dishes that broke were left in cracked pieces on the floor.1 In her fiftieth year the ivy was grown so vigorous and had so far extended itself that it grew inside all the closets and made much of the floor slippery and unsafe to walk upon. [MASK] sang as much within the house as without.
<name>Death</name>	Death	Stephen	moaned the gentleman. “What shall I do?” Something caught [MASK]’s eye. Beneath a black arch stood a familiar figure: a fairy woman who habitually wore a black veil that went from the crown of her head to the tips of her fingers.
<name>Thornfield</name>	Thornfield	Hurtfew	At best he fancied [MASK] must be like its owner -dusty, old-fashioned and given to long, dull silences; at worst he pictured a rain-lashed farmhouse upon a dark, dreary moor. He was surprized to find that it was none of these things.
<name>Merlin</name>	Merlin	Vinculus	[MASK] leaned forward across the table. “Magic shall be written on the faces of the stony hills, but their minds shall not be able to contain it. In winter the barren trees shall be a black writing but they shall not understand it.”
<name>Florian</name>	Florian	Strange	What does the prophecy say we must do? - the other magician and I?” “Fail.” [MASK] blinked in surprize. “I ... I do not think . . . Fail? No, madam, no. It is too late for that.
<name>Mr. Biswas</name>	Mr. Biswas	Next	[MASK] his polishing-sleeves and polishing-gloves slipped off his arms and hands and folded themselves up neatly upon the table. Then his coat leapt from the chairback where he had hung it. It took firm hold of him and helped him on with itself.
<name>Neptune</name>	Neptune	Strange	Of the hundred horses that [MASK] created only about twenty were eventually harnessed to the ship. These twenty were certainly instrumental in pulling the False Prelate off the sand, but equally useful was the great trough in the sandbank which appeared as more and more horses were created out of it.
<name>someone</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	someone (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	Strange	Then with great reluctance he stood aside for [MASK] to enter. The proportions of the room were lofty. The walls were panelled in oak and there was a great deal of fine carving. More royal and symbolic personages lounged about upon clouds on the ceiling.
<name>he</name>	he	Ac	Such a noodle I am upon occasion! I mistook him for you! Pray do not be offended, sir! For now that I behold you, I plainly see that whereas [MASK] has the wild, romantic looks one associates with magicians,you have the meditative air of a scholar.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Stephen	“Oh, it does not matter!” said the gentleman. “In truth, there is nothing to do but wait. Moss-oak is most easily discovered at dawn.” “But dawn is not for another nine hours!” exclaimed [MASK] in horror.
<name>Tarot</name>	Tarot	Childermass	“You may expect a meeting,” said [MASK], “leading to an ordeal of some sort, perhaps even death. The cards do not say whether you survive or not, but whatever happens, this,” he touched the last card, “says that you will achieve your purpose.”
<name>Tree</name>	Tree	Snow	He realized he had been entwined in the wood for years and years. He knew the wood and the wood knew him. There was no saying any longer what was wood and what was man. All was silent. [MASK] fell. He screamed . . .
<name>Mr. Bingley</name>	Mr. Bingley	Stephen	[MASK] helped the gentleman on with his leaf-green coat (which was of the very best quality and most fashionable cut), then the gentleman went over to the milking stool and picked up the little box that lay there.
<name>Sharpe</name>	Sharpe	Strange	“Can you look over that hill?” [MASK] tapped the water and made a sort of twisting gesture above the surface. The crossroads vanished and in its place appeared an excellent view of the French Army - or, if not the whole Army, a very substantial part of it.
<name>Agent</name>	Agent	Leucrocuta	“I brought you here. [MASK], tell me: why do you spy on me? What have I ever done that is secret? Why did you not come here and ask me? I would have told you everything!” “They made me do it.
<name>The Stranger</name>	The Stranger	Drawlight	They were rutted and ill-maintained; one was scarcely more than a cart-track. It was an out-of-the-way place, marked on no map. It did not even have a name. [MASK] was waiting at the crossroads.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Childermass	I think you told me about him.” [MASK] studied the people in the square a moment longer and then he said, “Unlikely as it seems, one of them must be performing some sort of magic. I need to go down and see. Come.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Strange	And if he will not, we shall send him to the workhouse.” “Well, that seems most reasonable,” whispered [MASK]. “But what I do not understand is . . .” Just at that moment the man under the hedge opened his eyes.
<name>He</name>	He	Drawlight	He drew closer until he was leaning over the figure. There was no sound of breathing. He wished that he had a stick to poke it. Without warning, the figure turned over. [MASK] gave a little yelp of fright. Silence.
<name>him</name>	him	Strange	It was the release of an overcharged heart. Her tears fell abundantly and she admitted that she had seen [MASK]. She had seen him in the street below and known that he was waiting for her and so she had run out of the house to meet him.
<name>Colonel Fitzwilliam</name>	Colonel Fitzwilliam	Childermass	“Ah! That is generous indeed!” said [MASK]. “Believe me, sir, I know very well that not every gentleman would be so magnanimous in defeat. But it is no more than I expected.
<name>Cecily</name>	Cecily	Alfred	He waited until he was sure the gentlemen were out of hearing and then he exlaimed, “What in the world was the matter with everyone tonight? [MASK]! I know that you have not often been in such company as we have tonight, but that is no reason to forget all your training!
<name>someone</name>	someone	Lascelles	He was sitting deep in thought, wholly taken up with this new, and not altogether pleasant, idea. At last he spoke, but it was more as if he were speaking his thoughts out loud, rather than answering [MASK]’s question.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Frank	I can scarcely sleep for thinking of it. I curse my stupidity that I could not explain myself better. But they trust you, [MASK]. You could drop a few hints - not to your master, but to his sister and daughter - about
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Arabella	“No. I do not think so. I believe he came for another reason entirely.” “I know that you have warned me against false hopes,” said [MASK], “and I have tried to do as you advise. But he is here!
<name>Sharpe</name>	Sharpe	Strange	One very rainy morning about the middle of the month [MASK] was riding at the side of a road along which the 95th Rifles were marching. He happened to spy some particular friends of his a little way ahead. Urging his horse to a canter, he soon caught up with them.
<name>Trelawney</name>	Trelawney	Stephen	He did not struggle at all. I wonder who he was?” “I told you, sir,” said [MASK], wiping his eyes. “He is the man who told me that prophecy. He has a strange disfiguration upon his body.
<name>Cheshire</name>	Cheshire	Childermass	[MASK] smiled a long smile that went all up one side of his face. “Oh! You have talked yourself into a belief that he is the agent of some other magician. Well, sir, he is not. You may depend upon me for that.
<name>magician</name>	magician	Strange	^ .r . ■_ ■ * w ’ • [MASK] had been cautioned by the Royal Dukes that it was contrary to Court etiquette to speak to the King unless the King addressed him first. However there seemed little hope of this since the King disliked magicians so much.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Lascelles	In a dead voice he said, “I am the Champion of the Castle of the Plucked Eye and Heart. I offer challenges to . . .” “Yes, yes!” cried [MASK], impatiently. “I do not care about that.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Strange	“You have studied the matter?” “I know that to keep a man without companionship, to deny him exercise and a change of air cannot possibly cure any thing,” said [MASK]. “It is barbaric! I would not keep a dog so.”
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Stephen	It was the sort of simple, domestic scene that would ordinarily have delighted [MASK], but in his present mood he could only feel a chill; if the man had reached out and struck the girl or strangled her - he would have felt no surprize.
<name>Byron</name>	Byron	Vinculus	He did not belong anywhere. [MASK]’s words had briefly given him the sense of belonging to something, of being part of a pattern and of having a purpose. But it had all been illusory. The Engravings Late February-March 1816 Y ou are changed.
<name>Montmorency</name>	Montmorency	Strange	It was high up on the wall, just above the level of the water outside, and it was covered by a heavy iron grille. This meant that most of the room was below the level of the canal. Yet after their encounter with [MASK], it seemed a warm and friendly place.
<name>Kim</name>	Kim	Strange	Only a few minutes ago he had struggled to persuade the gentleman not to kill [MASK], but why should he care what became of one Englishman? Why should he care what became of any of that cold, callous race?
<name>Merlin</name>	Merlin	Strange	But it was not a bee; it was a bead of pearly blue light. A second light flew out of the cuirassier’s horse. The horse screamed and reared up. The cuirassier stared, puzzled. [MASK] raised his other hand to smash horse and horseman out of existence.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Strange	[MASK], contemptuously. “Oh, no. I do not think so. But then I flatter myself that neither am I particularly safe. I hope I have not missed my chance. I hope that when I return tomorrow I will find some clue as to where the mysterious figure went.”
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Stephen	But these were very fleeting fancies. A moment later [MASK]’s native distrust of Englishmen - and of English magicians in particular - reasserted itself. “I do not understand you,” he said quickly. He mounted his horse and rode away without another word.
<name>Borges</name>	Borges	Ormskirk	We shall all be kings together! 2 The likelihood was that neither did [MASK]. He had simply written down a spell that someone else had told him or that he had found in another book. This is a perennial problem with the writings of the Argentine magicians.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Arabella	I meet with that sort very often. Well, if he is not a magician, what is he? Can you at least tell me that?” “I think I can,” said [MASK] in the pleased manner of someone who has made a very clever discovery.
<name>Fudge</name>	Fudge	Drawlight	[MASK] did so. Long years of collecting and repeating malicious gossip about his acquaintance had made him adept at remembering names and facts. He had the first message perfectly, but the second had descended to a few garbled sentences about magicians standing in the rain, looking at stones.
<name>Simon</name>	Simon	Vinculus	The face was purple and swollen; the eyes were bulging and filled with blood. He studied it until he could discern in the distorted features a face he knew. “[MASK],” he said. Taking out his pocket-knife, he cut the body down.
<name>St. Joseph</name>	St. Joseph	Child	But the Virgin and [MASK] had somehow got into the habit of speaking and whenever some unfortunate stranger passed within the compass of their gaze they would still turn their stone heads and say, “It is not him.”
<name>Strange</name>	Strange	Stephen	But none of them are missing. They are all exactly where I thought they were.” From this rather incomplete explanation [MASK] deduced that the magician must have succeeded in summoning and speaking to the gentle-man with the thistle-down hair.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Happily	[MASK] the solution occurred to him immediately; he stuck his hand into the breast of his coat and pulled out some sheets of paper with bits of straw sticking to them. “Now,” he said, looking even more mysterious and impressive than before, “I have here some spells which . . .
<name>he</name>	he	Stephen	This was such a very extraordinary proposal that for a moment [MASK] did not know quite what to say. “Either he is mad,” he thought, “or else he is some sort of radical politician who wishes to destroy all distinctions of rank.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Lord	He had no gift. He lifted his head and said, ‘[MASK], I bring you the trees and hills. I bring you the wind and the rain.’ The kings and queens, the great lords and ladies and the other magicians were amazed at his impudence.
<name>Merlin</name>	Merlin	Arabella	He thought of the wood and the tiny lights within it that had suggested an ancient house. The King’s Roads could certainly take him there, but - leaving aside his promise to [MASK] - he had no desire to find the gentleman by magic he had already done.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Firenze	Thinking of [MASK] reminded him that he had not yet told the gentleman about his meeting with the blue-skinned man in the cart and the prophecy. He did so now. “Really? Well, that is most unexpected!” declared the gentleman.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Norrell	“Fairy magic?” “Oh!” said [MASK]. “Undoubtedly! This is part of the same spell that keeps you here in Eternal Darkness.” He looked around. “How extensive is it?” “What?”
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Alfred	Yet you brought him a strawberryjellyl What were you thinking of?” [MASK] said something rather indistinct in which only the word “fright” was distinguishable. “You had a fright? What fright?” “I thought I saw a queer figure standing behind her ladyship’s chair.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Stephen	“He begs me to save him,” the gentleman explained. “Oh, could you not do it, sir? I hate to see these noble creatures die!” “Tender-hearted [MASK]!” said the gentleman, fondly.
<name>Jinn</name>	Jinn	Fairies	There was someone else present who, I believe, both heard and saw him. Now, consider the advantages of dealing with such a person! No magician, living or dead, could teach me as much. [MASK] are the source of everything we magicians desire.
<name>Phileas Fogg</name>	Phileas Fogg	Stephen	The footman gave a short, uncheerful laugh. Finding that his companions were of no help, [MASK] did what he always did under such circumstances; he took the whole charge of the journey upon himself. He instructed the coachman to take one road, while he took another.
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Lascelles	Sometimes [MASK] would amuse himself by picking up one of these volumes. A prominent characteristic of these histories was that the murderer, however bold he was during the act of murder, would soon afterwards be overcome with emotion, leading him to act in strange, irrational ways that were always his undoing.
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Strange	Three of the maidservants went back to the house where they went into attics that had scarcely been disturbed since [MASK] had been a boy. They took an axe and a hammer and broke open chests that had been locked fifty years before.
<name>Anansi</name>	Anansi	Strange	This was because the man had a pineapple in his mouth. How he had managed to cram the whole thing in there, [MASK] could not imagine. Green, spiky leaves emerged slowly out of his mouth and then were sucked back in again as he spoke.
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Childermass	Instead, he leant hard against him, keeping him trapped against the wall. Then he reached down and picked up the pearl-handled knife with the jagged edge. He drew the blade slowly across [MASK]’s face, cutdng him from eye to mouth.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Stephen	He cut a piece off the pie with a large knife and seemed about to offer it to [MASK] when he was struck by a doubt. “Do black lads eat the same as us?” he asked as if he thought they might possibly eat grass, or moonbeams.
<name>Engliss</name>	Engliss	Minichello	To her absolute astonishment it was [MASK] who helped her comprehend it. In a very reasonable counterfeit of the English language he said, “The magician Engliss makes it. The magician Engliss makes the tempesta.” “I beg your pardon?”
<name>Falkor</name>	Falkor	Vinculus	It is the task of the Book to bear the words. Which I do. It is the task of the Reader to know what they say.” “But the last Reader is dead!” [MASK] shrugged as if that were none of his concern.
<name>the arras</name>	the arras	Strange	He could not find the gunpowder. He hunted in cupboards, under staircases and on balconies. He called back every now and then “One moment!” - until the moment came when he thought to look behind [MASK], behind the curtain and under the arch.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Stephen	Then he rose from his own box and came and sat in [MASK]’s. “I may as well tell you,” he said, speaking in a highly confidential manner, “that this city has not the hundredth part of its former splendour!
<name>Uriah</name>	Uriah	Childermass	[MASK] was one of that uncomfortable class of men whose birth is lowly and who are destined all their lives to serve their betters, but whose clever brains and quick abilities make them wish for recognition and rewards far beyond their reach.
<name>Titus</name>	Titus	Tantalus	“This wine is one of the vintages of Hell - but do not allow yourself to be dissuaded from tasting it upon that account! I dare say you have heard of [MASK]? The wicked king who baked his little son in a pie and ate him?
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jeremy	I would have known her by her figure, by her way of walking, by her everything.” “What did you do after you had lost sight of the woman?” “I rode straight here - but your servant would not let me in.” “[MASK]?
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Stephen	[MASK] felt clouds pause in their passing; he felt sleeping hills shift and murmur; he felt cold mists dance. He understood for the first time that the world is not dumb at all, but merely waiting for someone to speak to it in a language it understands.
<name>Strange</name>	Strange	Childermass	“I said he was a great magician. I did not say he was a good man or that I welcomed his influence upon English magic. Besides what you have just heard was my private opinion and not for public circulation. [MASK] knows.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Strange	cried [MASK]. “I dare say he came here on purpose to make me mad!” With a cry of mingled rage and self-pity he demanded, “Why will he not attend to me? After everything I have done, why does he not care enough to look at me?
<name>Colonel</name>	Colonel	Strange	Every officer he met was invited to come and drink Champagne with him that evening after dinner. They soon excused him the eccentricity of his profession. What mattered was that one could always meet with some very jolly fellows at [MASK]’s bivouack and something decent to drink.
<name>Dumbledore</name>	Dumbledore	Strange	He paused and his face worked as if he were struggling to say something that lay very deep inside him. “What you wrote, you wrote for me. For me alone.” [MASK] opened his mouth to protest at this surprizing conclusion.
<name>Rasputin</name>	Rasputin	Buonaparte	According to the spies, [MASK] had asked the wardrobe the following three questions: “Would the baby the Empress was expecting be male?”; “Would the Czar of Russia change sides again?”; “When would the English be defeated?”
<name>She</name>	She	Arabella	[MASK] told him very plainly that she felt just the same as she had last night. In the end is it not futile to try and follow the course of a quarrel between husband and wife? Such a conversation is sure to mean- der more than any other.
<name>Dicksie</name>	Dicksie	Jerrys	Sometimes he won money at gambling clubs, but mote often he encouraged foolish young Toms and [MASK] to gamble, and when they lost (which they invariably did) he would take them by the arm and, talking all the while, would lead them to this or that money-lender of his acquaintance.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Strange	To [MASK]’s unnautical eye, it looked very much as if the ship had simply lain down and gone to sleep. He felt that if he had been the Captain he would have spoken to her sternly and made her get up again.
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Magician	I hope to be married soon and a life spent in dark woods surrounded by thieves and murderers would be inconvenient to say the least. I suggest you chuse someone else.” “I did not chuse you, [MASK]! You were chosen long ago.”
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Drawlight	[MASK]’s glance sank to the ground. He seemed to shrink inside his clothes. He grew, if it were possible, several degrees more miserable. One might have supposed that he was ashamed to hear his past sins described, but it was not that.
<name>Dr. Watson</name>	Dr. Watson	Stephen	“I hope her ladyship did not eat something which disagreed with her?” she asked. “No,” said [MASK] with a sigh, “it is nothing of that sort. She complains of aches in all her limbs, odd dreams and feeling cold.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Drawlight	I dare say there are all sorts of desperate characters close at hand.” “You are probably right. But you see I have my pistols with me, and am quite as desperate as any of them.” [MASK] was struck by a sudden thought.
<name>his</name>	his	Strange	The vision had not been very distinct, but he had seen a magician in the darkness, doing magic. He had congratulated himself on penetrating [MASK]’s counterspells at last; until it occurred to him that he was looking at a vision of himself in his own library.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Strange	“I dare say,” said [MASK]. “You do not seem very sure of it.” “Forgive me, my lord, but - as I think I have said before -visions are precisely the wrong sort of magic for this sort of thing.”2
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Edward	“Oh! How could she be so negligent? I have told her a thousand times that if she left the drawing-room window open, sooner or later a thief would come in by it. Have I not said so a hundred times, [MASK]?
<name>He</name>	He	Lascelles	He paused. “I ought not to have told you that.” [MASK] shrugged. “What I do not understand,” he said, “is how you expected to succeed with such a perfectly absurd scheme.” “It was not in the least absurd!
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Drawlight	His words were, ‘Come with me, my dear [MASK], for I do not think that my spirits can support the sight of a lady, young, fair and innocent, cut off in the sweetest period of existence!’ She stays in the house and sees no one.
<name>Strider</name>	Strider	Stephen	“I saw him last night in the King’s Roads, with the Darkness wrapped about him like a mystical cloak! What does he want? What can he be planning? Oh! This will be the end of me, [MASK]! I feel it!
<name>Merlin</name>	Merlin	Afterwards	The dreadful sights attendant on a magician’s work - ghosts, demons, horrors? The sudden discovery that he had a mistress somewhere and half a dozen natural children? Suddenly there was a shout from outside in the hall. [MASK] no one could say whose voice it had been.
<name>Artemis</name>	Artemis	Norrell	“They are foolish,” said [MASK]. “Fairy roads cannot hurt them. Fairy roads lead nowhere at all.”3 “And what of the half-human descendants of fairies? Do they inherit their forefathers’ knowledge and powers?”
