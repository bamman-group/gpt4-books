<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Wycliff	“If the heirs can prove that he lacked sufficient mental capacity when he executed the handwritten will, then there is no other will. They were all destroyed.” “In which case he died without a will,” [MASK] added.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Snead	[MASK] decided to help him. “This is the way I see it. Your boy got screwed, along with his brother and sisters. They each got five million bucks when they turned twenty-one, and we know what they did with the money.
<name>Heinrich</name>	Heinrich	Nate	He has not. You are the first American he’s ever seen.” “Lucky guy.” THE FIRST SIGN of the settlement came at almost seven hours. [MASK] saw a thin line of blue smoke rising above the trees, near the foot of a hill.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Nate	But the kids were gone now, either grown or taken away by their mothers, and the last thing [MASK] wanted was another Christmas in a bar with other miserable drunks singing carols and pretending all was merry. The valley was white and still, a few cars moving like ants far away.
<name>Rick</name>	Rick	Jevy	[MASK] yelled again, and pointed to something on his side of the plane. The airstrip looked to be the length of a nice suburban driveway, dangerous even in good weather. It didn’t matter. They had no choice. If they crashed, at least there were people nearby.
<name>John</name>	John	Troy	The autopsy was finished. The cause of death was obvious. There was no trace of alcohol or drugs of any kind. And there was no tumor. No sign of cancer. [MASK] was in good physical health at the time of his death, though slightly malnourished.
<name>Mickey</name>	Mickey	Hark	So his eyes were red and puffy and his head ached, but he was nonetheless moving quickly around the coffeepot. [MASK]’s hourly rates varied. In the past year, he’d handled a nasty divorce for as little as two hundred dollars an hour.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Nate	It widened, and they were off, at full throttle. [MASK] moved lower in the boat, and found a spot on the bottom between the box of food and the buckets, with his back to the bench. From there the mist couldn’t spray his head.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Valdir	The boat’s gone.” [MASK] was much more concerned about the boat than about its deckhand. “I’ve never seen such storms. We’ve been hit with three of them.” “What did the woman say?” “I don’t know.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jevy	His heart was pounding and his muscles were already tired. The clouds were breaking up, so the sun was bearing down. [MASK] went to work on the motor. Luckily it started, and kept running, and they followed the boy, his canoe easily outpacing them and their sputtering outboard.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Nate	It was overcast and threatening more rain. The sun finally broke through at about six. [MASK] knew because he’d rearmed himself with a watch. A rooster crowed. They were docked near a small farmhouse, their bow tied to a timber that once held a pier.
<name>Annabeth</name>	Annabeth	Rachel	They jumped to their feet and resumed their positions. The weeds along the trail were knee-high, and from the distance they could see a patrol moving their way, along the path. [MASK] was with them; she was coming.
<name>Griffin</name>	Griffin	Josh	But his smart retorts and quick comebacks failed him under pressure. Almost four months of virtual solitude had dulled his reflexes. He could manage to look pitiful, and that was all. “Come on, [MASK]. You can’t just kick me out.”
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Jevy	[MASK] actually once knew a man who died from malaria. Two hours into the journey, the guides led them through a bewildering series of narrow streams and quiet lagoons, and when they emerged into a broader river the canoes slowed for a moment.
<name>Ennis</name>	Ennis	Jevy	Surely he wouldn’t die. THIRTY-THREE HE WOKE ONCE, but couldn’t see. He woke again and it was dark. He tried to say something to [MASK] about water, just a small drink, and maybe a bite of bread.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Troy	“Many years ago. Before I went to college. . . . How much do you know about me?” “Not much. You don’t leave much of a trail.” “Then how did you find me?” “[MASK] helped.
<name>John</name>	John	Nate	I now live alone.” “Divorce is so easy, isn’t it?” [MASK] took a very small sip of the warm liquid. He had thus far managed to avoid the raging diarrhea that struck so many foreigners. Surely the murky liquid was harmless.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Troy	“I welcome death.” “Don’t say that. When did you meet [MASK]?” “A year went by. He and my mother became phone pals. She became convinced his motives were good, and so one day he came to our house.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Jevy	“I think so.” “Does he speak Portuguese?” “I don’t know.” “Why don’t you go find out?” “Relax.” [MASK] stepped from the boat. “He looks like a cannibal,” he whispered.
<name>Grisham</name>	Grisham	Nate	[MASK] opened the hard plastic case and examined the glossy little phone. “How much did this cost you?” he asked. “Me, not a dime.” “Okay, how much did it cost the Phelan estate?” “Forty-four hundred bucks.
<name>Jonas</name>	Jonas	Nate	Past the middle of the swamp, the water fell to the horses’ legs, then their feet. Safely on the other side, [MASK] relaxed. Then he laughed at himself. He could sell this back home.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Nate	Mosquitoes carry it and it spreads quickly.” [MASK] began scratching and was ready to hop in the boat, then he remembered his pills. “I’m safe. I’m taking chloro-something.” “Chloroquine?” “That’s it.”
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Nate	“The women get the hard work,” [MASK] observed. “Yes. But the work is easy compared to childbirth.” “I’d rather watch them work.” The air was humid, but free of the smoke that hung eternally over the village.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Jevy	The boat was adequate and now properly repaired. They were anxious to set sail. When he hung up he vomited again. And then he showered again. Then [MASK] helped him to the elevator and through the lobby.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Laura	A complete answer would get complicated. “What brings you here?” “It’s a long story.” “Oh wonderful! [MASK] and I love stories. Let’s have a long lunch and tell stories. We’ll have a grand time.”
<name>Slughorn</name>	Slughorn	Stafford	He’d been declared sane on the spot, and seconds later had taken a thick will prepared by [MASK] and one of his associates, declared it to be his, and signed it. There was no dispute about this.
<name>Haymitch</name>	Haymitch	Stafford	“Meeting’s adjourned,” [MASK] says, and everyone quickly packs. Per my instructions, the three families are hurried from their respective rooms and asked to leave the building. One camera remains focused on me, its images going nowhere but the archives.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Nate	He wore a ragged straw hat that hid most of his face. When they were only a few feet away, close enough to inspect him, [MASK] noticed that he was fishing without the benefit of a pole or a rod. No stick of any sort.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Phil	[MASK] asked. “I’m not sure what to expect. I want to hug my kids and apolo- gize for being such a lousy father, but I’m not sure how that’s supposed to help them now.” “I wouldn’t do that.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Nate	“And here’s your response,” he said, handing over a manila file. “You need to read and sign this as soon as possible.” “Has the estate filed an answer?” [MASK] asked. “Tomorrow.
<name>Simba</name>	Simba	Jevy	“When the floods stop,” [MASK] continued, “we have the dry season. Grasslands, marshes, more lagoons and swamps than anyone can count. The cycle—the flooding and the dry season—produces more wildlife than any place in the world.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Neva	No one but her. Evidently, those who’d passed it along did not make the connection between the name on the envelope and the name in the recent news. It was Monday morning, the offices were slow and quiet. [MASK] locked her door.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Nate	[MASK] asked if he could help, and was quickly informed that he could not. At least not with the engine. He could, however, take a bucket and begin dipping out the rainwater. And he could take a paddle and keep them in the center of the river, whatever it was named.
<name>Artie</name>	Artie	Nate	[MASK] was flipping through the owner’s manual. “Of course not.” “Then how am I supposed to keep the batteries charged?” “There’s an extra battery. You’ll think of something.” “So much for a quiet getaway.”
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Jevy	He was burning with fever again. His legs were numb and weak, and the three of them inched carefully along the narrow pier and up the steps to the porch. When they folded him into the hammock, [MASK] delivered a quick review of the past week.
<name>John</name>	John	Jevy	A small herd of deer waded through the floodwaters, nibbling at green vines, oblivious to the noise from the river. Seven deer, two of which were spotted fawns. “There is a small trading post a few hours away,” [MASK] said, getting to his feet.
<name>Walt</name>	Walt	Hark	[MASK]’s edgy voice rose an octave, and the words carried even more anxiety. “But you heard our psychiatrists. Hell, they’re on tape.” “Are they sticking by their opinions, in light of the suicide?” “Damned right they are!”
<name>John</name>	John	Valdir	He was dirty and smelled like cow manure. “So the boat is gone?” [MASK] said. “Yes. I’m sorry. There was nothing I could do. I have never seen such a storm.”
<name>Wapshot</name>	Wapshot	WyclifF	“But she’s a party,” [MASK] said. “Yes she is. But her presence can be excused. We can litigate without her.” “Excused by whom?” “You, Your Honor.”
<name>Rudy</name>	Rudy	Snead	He laughed loud and long and did so while looking at the solemn and partially hidden faces of the Phelan lawyers. He laughed directly at [MASK]. He stood and walked along his end of the table, chuckling to himself. “What a trial,” he said, then sat down again.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Snead	So for the next hour or so, you are to assume that we are the enemy. Okay?” It certainly wasn’t okay with [MASK], but he’d taken their money. He had to play along.
<name>He</name>	He	Nate	My father had Irish ancestors. Family history has never interested me.” “What church do you attend?” “Episcopal.” Catholic, Lutheran, Episcopal, it didn’t matter. [MASK] hadn’t seen the inside of a church since his second wedding.
<name>He</name>	He	Nate	“What school?” “Grad school.” “I dropped out.” His words were edgy and strained. There was pressure behind them. [MASK] was involved in the dropping out; he just wasn’t exacdy sure how and why. His water arrived.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Phil	[MASK] stood between two sawhorses, tape measure in hand, sawdust on his shoulders. He wore a flannel shirt, jeans, boots, and would’ve easily passed for a carpenter. “Thanks for coming,” he said with a big smile. “You’re welcome.
<name>James</name>	James	Snead	Per my instructions, the three families are hurried from their respective rooms and asked to leave the building. One camera remains focused on me, its images going nowhere but the archives. The lawyers and psychiatrists leave in a rush. I tell [MASK] to take a seat at the table.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Cody	Word filtered out from the group and before long the women scattered around the house were whispering about the half a billion. [MASK]’s mother, a prim and shriveled little woman whose wrinkles cracked when she smiled, was appalled by the obscenity of the fortune.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Jevy	[MASK] had captained dozens of them. He saw the light coming around a bend, and when he heard the knock of the diesel, he knew precisely what kind of boat it was. And he knew the captain, who was sleeping on his bunk when the deckhand stopped the chalana.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Nate	“When did you last see him?” [MASK]’s words too were softer and slower. She had a soothing effect. “Many years ago. Before I went to college. . . . How much do you know about me?” “Not much.
<name>Dirk</name>	Dirk	Nate	“My deckhand. Right now he’s under the boat in twelve feet of water, holding his breath and cutting rope from the prop. Like I said, I’m supervising.” “Stay out of the water, [MASK].” “Are you kidding?
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Troy	Surely [MASK] had left her fifty million or so. One percent of his estate would be around a hundred million. One lousy percent. She did the math on a paper napkin as she talked on the phone to her lawyer.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Nate	“Where were you born?” “This could take a while.” “Just hit the high points.” “There are more low ones.” “Come on, [MASK]. You wanted to talk, let’s talk. The hike takes half an hour.”
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Josh	There’s no way to assemble everyone before Christmas. How does the twenty-seventh look to you?” “What do you have in mind?” “A reading of the will.” The idea struck [MASK], and he almost choked on a dill spear.
<name>He</name>	He	Hark	But for the allegations of her attorney, there’d been no sign of her. No document in the official court file had her signature on it. [MASK] referred to her as the “phantom party.” He and the other contestants were litigating against a shadow.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jevy	“Yes, eventually.” [MASK] removed the top cover of the motor and wiped the moisture from the carburetor. He adjusted the throttle, checked the oil, then tried to start the motor. On the fifth pull, the motor caught and sputtered, then quit.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Nate	The room was very cool, the air conditioner running at full speed. He saw a bare foot, then stepped closer to see [MASK], lying naked, wedged between the bed and the wall with a sheet pulled down and wrapped around his knees.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Nate	Once secure, he drove six more nails into the studs, and admired his handiwork. Then he produced a tape and began to measure the next open space. “Where did you learn to be a carpenter?” [MASK] asked as he watched with interest.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Jevy	The ceiling was low, the windows shut, and the first major problem was the fact that there was no air conditioning. The cabin was an oven. “We’ll get a fan,” [MASK] said, reading his mind.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	TJ	Three years ago I made a will, just for the hell of it, and left everything to charities, over a hundred of them. I was cursing [MASK] one day, and he was cursing me, and I told him about this new will.
<name>God</name>	God	Rachel	A tiny little woman one pew up clapped her hands and sang along. Maybe the music would draw [MASK]. She had to crave real worship in a church with wooden floors and stained glass, with fully clothed people reading Bibles in a modern language.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Nate	The boat startled them and upset their nap. Tails slapped and water splashed. [MASK] glanced at the machete, just in case, then laughed at his own foolishness. The reptiles did not attack. They watched the boat ease past. No animals for the next twenty minutes.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Nate	His hosts would have gladly sat at the table or in the den and talked until dark, but [MASK] needed a walk. He thanked them for their hospitality, and when he left them waving on the porch he felt as though he’d known them for years.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Janie	[MASK] has had two husbands since our divorce many years ago. I’m almost certain she is living alone at the moment. I hire investigators to keep me posted, but not even the FBI could keep track of her bed-hopping.
<name>John</name>	John	Jevy	The worst storm ever. It happened in the middle of the night, and he didn’t see much. The wind was so fierce that he, his wife, and his child hid under a bed. “Where did it sink?” [MASK] asked.
<name>Truman</name>	Truman	Theishen	Come on, old boy, they’re pleading. [MASK] asks, “What is your current physical condition?” “I’ve felt better.” “It’s rumored you have a cancerous tumor.” Get right to the point, don’t you?
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Phil	“I can’t afford it.” “Sure you can. My client will foot the bill. You can be my spiritual adviser for the trip. Money is no object.” “It wouldn’t be right.” “Come on, [MASK].
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Lillian	[MASK] and the first family are in the executive conference room on the thirteenth floor, just below me. It’s a large room, marble and mahogany, with rich rugs and a long oval table down the center, and it’s now filled with very nervous people.
<name>Neely</name>	Neely	Wycliff	[MASK] was gazing at the ceiling, deep in thought. “Why would he give eleven billion to an illegitimate daughter who is a missionary?” “I can’t answer that, Judge. He surprised me so many times that I became jaded.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Phil	“Well, uh, thanks, but—” [MASK] was all smiles too. “No, I insist. My wife makes a lamb stew every time it snows. It’s on the stove now. We have so few guests in the wintertime.
<name>Nate</name>	Nate	Josh	Should one wait until the thaw? Or sprinkle them anyway? [MASK] didn’t give a damn. He’d toss them in the face of any natural disaster. He was being hounded by the lawyers for the Phelan heirs.
<name>He</name>	He	Nate	He could, however, take a bucket and begin dipping out the rainwater. And he could take a paddle and keep them in the center of the river, whatever it was named. He did both. The current kept them moving, although at a much slower pace than [MASK] preferred.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Josh	[MASK] asked. “Could you pull over at the nearest quick shop?” “Sure. Why?” “I’d like to get a six-pack.” “Very funny.” “I’d kill for a tall Coca-Cola.”
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Jevy	He took it, eased it into his mouth, and began sucking on it. “I’ll get some water,” [MASK] said. He opened the refrigerator and removed a bottle of water. “Can you lift your head?” he asked.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Josh	“Can I thank you now?” “No.” “Thanks, [MASK]. For everything.” “Don’t mention it.” IN THE CROWDED TERMINAL, at a small table across from a busy bar, they sipped weak espresso and read newspapers.
<name>David</name>	David	Josh	“He will need rest when he leaves the hospital.” “When will he leave the hospital?” Another conversation. “He can’t say right now.” [MASK] shook his head and flung the remnants of his bagel into the wastebasket.
<name>Who</name>	Who	Anacondas	“I’m not going.” “We can hire local guides and such, but it still might take a week or so.” “Don’t they have cannibals down there?” “No.” “[MASK]?”
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Nate	[MASK] asked, still staring at her grave. “The spirits are blaming us for the malaria. It arrived when we came the first time. They are not happy to see us.” “Tell him his spirits are a bunch of clowns.”
<name>John</name>	John	Jevy	The rooms were full, so they simply left him in the hall of the men’s ward, near a messy desk they called the nurses’ station. At least they couldn’t ignore him. [MASK] was asked to leave. There was nothing he could do but wait.
<name>Clayton</name>	Clayton	Nate	“You’ve litigated for over twenty years, [MASK]. That’s about average. It’s time to move on to something else.” “So I’ll become a lobbyist, and do lunch with the press secretaries for a thousand little congressmen.”
<name>Grisham</name>	Grisham	Nate	“I had a clear view, yes.” “And you had a clear reason to watch your father closely?” “I did.” “Did you have any trouble hearing him?” “No.” The lawyers knew where [MASK] was going.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Josh	“A holographic will?” “Yes.” “Weren’t you with him?” “Yes. It’s a long story.” “Perhaps I should hear it.” “Perhaps you should.” [MASK] had a busy day.
<name>Harshaw</name>	Harshaw	Troy	But was the stock placed in trust, or given outright, or tied up in any one of a hundred devious ways that [MASK] would certainly enjoy from the grave? “We have to see that damned will!”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Nate	Yes, [MASK] knew the basics. Perhaps his mother had told him. Neither of his wives had been churchgoers, though number two was Catholic and they did midnight mass at Christmas every other year. Three more stragglers came from the street.
<name>John</name>	John	Marco	The fractured wing had been removed, as had the propeller. It was in the grass near the plane, still stained with blood. The right landing brace was bent, but would not require replacement. The dead cow had been butchered by [MASK] and his wife.
<name>Deborah</name>	Deborah	Tira	Alternative rock with strong rap influences, something new. Something he was already inventing. Two floors up, in the study of their spacious home, [MASK], his mother, spent the day on the phone chatting with friends who called with their halfhearted condolences.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Nate	After two bends in the river, the trees grew thin and the ground was lower. The river widened, then spilled into a flooded lake with three decaying trees in the center of it. [MASK] knew they had not passed the trees on the way in.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Nate	They followed the boy in the canoe for twenty minutes until they entered a small shallow stream with rapid currents. [MASK] withdrew his paddle, caught his breath, and wiped sweat from his face. His heart was pounding and his muscles were already tired.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Lee	By dusk they were looking at an empty home priced at four million five, and the prospective buyers were seriously considering making an offer. [MASK] rarely saw such wealthy clients, and they’d worked her into a frenzy.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Cody	Others grimaced because they knew [MASK], and they were all Strongs, and they knew they would never see a dime of it. They all quietly seethed with envy. Word filtered out from the group and before long the women scattered around the house were whispering about the half a billion.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Jevy	The sun was up and unfiltered by clouds. The sidewalks were hot to the touch. There was no oil pump, at least not one for a diesel engine. The merchant made two calls, and [MASK] roared away in his pickup.
<name>Jose</name>	Jose	Jevy	] “Was she on the map?” “No.” “Then how did you find her?” No Brazilian could ever admit to being lost, especially a seasoned guide like [MASK]. It would hurt his self-esteem, and perhaps his business.
<name>Nkosi</name>	Nkosi	Rachel	They were being watched. The chief kept them away from the huts as if they were carrying diseases. He turned onto another trail, one that led through the woods for a few moments. When they emerged into a clearing, they were across from [MASK]’s hut.
<name>He</name>	He	Nate	They exchanged smiles, and for one scary moment [MASK] was afraid he was about to be introduced to the small crowd. His sermon was on the subject of enthusiasm, an odd choice given the average age of his congregation.
<name>She</name>	She	Jevy	The money goes into a trust.” “What is a trust?” “Think of it as a big bank account. It sits in the bank, protected, earning interest. The trustee decides where the interest goes.” [MASK] still wasn’t convinced.
<name>David</name>	David	Nate	What does this mean?” “I’ll explain later.” They stepped into the sunlight. The chief had his arms folded over his chest—his patience was almost gone. [MASK] removed his camera from the satchel and began taking pictures of the hut and the graves.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Nate	We should wrap it up by then.” “I can’t wait,” [MASK] said, and folded the phone. Time for a coffee break. They sat on the floor, backs to a wall, and sipped warm latte. “They wanted fifty?”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Snead	[MASK] had to lie about the half a million bucks already in hand, and he had to He about the promise of $4.5 million upon settlement or other favorable outcome. He had to He about the existence of the contract between himself and the lawyers.
<name>Yasser</name>	Yasser	Phelan	They filmed friends and neighbors as they came and went, tossing out banal questions about how the family was doing. Inside, [MASK]’s four eldest children gathered with their spouses and their children to receive condolences. The mood was somber when the guests were present.
<name>Rudy</name>	Rudy	Hark	The idea lost steam quickly until [MASK] offered the lame suggestion that each firm could front some expense money. The meeting grew incredibly quiet. Those who’d had so much to say about everything were now captivated by the magical language of briefs and old cases.
<name>John</name>	John	Montgomery	“How much do you know about her?” “Not much. But we need to find her.” “For what purpose?” “It’s a legal matter,” [MASK] said, with just enough hesitation to sound suspicious.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Nate	“Look, [MASK], she’s only human. She has those papers with her. She’ll wait a few days and start to think about them. Maybe thoughts of wealth have never entered her mind, but at some point she has to think of all the good things she could do with the money.
