<name>Marcellus</name>	Marcellus	Cornelius	[MASK]’ deep-set eyes widened. He nodded his head. “You, too, have seen him, then?” he asked. “Yes, sir. He is a courier, representing the Kingdom.”
<name>her</name>	her	Abigail	And — next morning after the burial, he had gone back to work, quiet and sad, but spending no time in useless brooding; for life was like that; people sickened and died; even young people like [MASK]; even little babies who had had no chance to live at all.
<name>Indiana</name>	Indiana	Mencius	“I’d like to hear it,” declared [MASK] with an unexpected enthusiasm that proved somewhat disconcerting to the Arabian, who dismissed the matter with a careless flick of his hands. “Tell me more about your trip,” he said.
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Hannah	There was no response to her knock at the front door. She stepped into the hallway and called cheerily. A weak voice bade her come in. [MASK], fujlly clothed, was lying on her bed. She tried to smile a welcome.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Mencius	“You astonished me today, [MASK]. You play so many parts —and all of them so very well.” “Perhaps you are referring to our public formalities, as compared with our unconventional behavior in private?”
<name>Prophet</name>	Prophet	Fara	“Coming soon?” asked [MASK]. “You would think, from his talk, that the prophet expected the avenger by next week — at the latest. If he had said it would occur a hundred years from now, his prediction would have been less risky.”
<name>David</name>	David	Voldi	The girl lifted pretty eyes and smiled shyly. It was the older people’s fault, thought [MASK], that the different races despised one another. He wondered whether the world might be more harmonious if all the old people were abolished; say, everyone over twenty.
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Jairus	That was it! They were deliberately snubbing him! After that, [MASK] —in the role of a mere inn-keeper — saw to it that their plates and cups were replenished, addressing himself only to the serving-maids. . . .
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Simon	What the Italian trollop had said was true: the Jews did take themselves too seriously; they made the business of living a sad and sorry undertaking. As for himself, [MASK] was now resolved to be more light-hearted in the future.
<name>Rachel</name>	Rachel	Esther	“Not likely.” He pretended to be debating the matter. “[MASK] is definitely Jewish, and by the time this baby was born her Arabian mother would hardly have wanted any more reminders of her unhappy life in Jewry.” “That is true, sir.
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Sergius	Reverting to this mysterious Galilean, [MASK], I’m no more gullible on the subject of miracles than you are — or my cynical young Arab who isn’t interested in anything but fine horses, sharp steel, and good sportsmanship.
<name>Mrs. Dubose</name>	Mrs. Dubose	Esther	There will be much confusion.’’ “But I cannot miss this, my son! I want to see this troublemaker finally disposed of! A day to remember! An historic occasion!’’ [MASK] listened with a sinking heart. She felt she must go.
<name>Trimalchio</name>	Trimalchio	Philip	[MASK], who was seated next to her, overheard the conversation and leaned forward to remark that one was expected to drink deeply at Roman banquets. “It annoys half-drunken people,” he went on, drolly, “to talk to anybody who remains sober.
<name>Princess Margaret</name>	Princess Margaret	Voldi	And that night around the camp-fire they had confided their bitter opposition to the Prince who, they said, had become so arrogant and so thoroughly detested by the people that his accession to the throne would amount to a national disaster. [MASK] had tried to temper their anger....
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Mencius	He called to one of the roustabouts and inquired whether there was a farrier in the neighborhood. The oaf nodded. “I’m afraid no farrier we’re likely to find in this place will do us much good,” observed [MASK].
<name>someone</name>	someone	Myra	She would provide herself with some inexpensive trinkets — and be a peddler. ... Yes — and she would try to find a tame little donkey to carry her pack. Proceeding from village to village, in the daytime, no harm would befall her. “You will need money,” cautioned [MASK].
<name>Pilate</name>	Pilate	Caesar	It was true, as the servant-girls had reported: this John was confident that stern judgment was at hand for evil-doers in high places. The whole world would be shaken! Not only High Priests and Prefects would be punished: [MASK] himself would feel the sting of that lash!
<name>the Arab</name>	the Arab	Voldi	I’m sure you wouldn’t like him.” The Roman’s eyes twinkled through this ironical speech, inviting the Arab to commit himself, but [MASK] made no sign of understanding. The friendly son of the Prefect might not be a policeman but this was no time to risk a confidence.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Voldi	‘‘Where is everybody?” inquired [MASK], raising his voice as the old man bared his gums and cupped his ear with a trembling hand. “Out yonder!” growled the ancient, pointing with his stick.
<name>The Queen</name>	The Queen	Arnon	“A ruler’s life, my dear, is not his own. His only concern is for the welfare of his country.” [MASK] despised herself for what, in this case, was a ridiculous lie; but felt that it was an easy way out of a painful discussion.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Peter	For one thing, the cell was dry, a welcome change from the perpetual dampness of the Catacombs. Perhaps when winter came — it was August now — the prison would be damp too; but [MASK] did not expect to be here when winter came, so there was no need to worry about that.
<name>fate</name>	fate	Jehovah	As a lad he had been forced to assume a man’s responsibilities, requiring him to work early and late while other children were at play, but it had never occurred to him to complain that the world was mistreating him, or that [MASK] had singled him out for target practice.
<name>Miss Temple</name>	Miss Temple	Andrew	After smouldering for a moment, he inquired, “Whoever put this foolish idea into her head?” “The Master,” said [MASK]. “She asked him if she might go along?” “No — it was his own idea. He invited her.”
<name>Churchill</name>	Churchill	Cornelius	It was unfortunate that this should be true; but wasn’t it true? The pity of it, admitted [MASK], was that whole nations so often were obliged to follow mad rulers, wicked men recklessly gambling with the blood and property of their subjects.
<name>Dulcie</name>	Dulcie	Fara	And when the testy hostler growled that he knew how to take care of a horse, [MASK] shouted untruthfully that if he did he was the first old man she had ever seen who knew or cared whether a hot horse was safely watered, and that she proposed to stand by him until he had done it.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Mariamne	[MASK] threw her arms about him, hugging him hungrily. “You have stayed away so long! We wondered if we were ever to see you again!” She held him at arms’ length. “You’re brown as a peasant.”
<name>Pierre</name>	Pierre	Voldi	They set off in all directions. [MASK] dashed away at a gallop along their favorite bridlepath skirting the rim of the plateau. At places where the trail was narrow and the descent precipitous, he dismounted and led his tired horse slowly, searching for ominous signs.
<name>Silas</name>	Silas	Voldi	asked [MASK]. “No. As I say, he was not a one to talk much, except to the smaller children; and, after he came into his teens, he was very quiet and walked alone, most of the time.
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Jairus	We’re just providing food and shelter.” ###### By mid-forenoon it had cleared. Patches of blue sky were appearing and the sun was glinting on the puddles in the rose-garden as [MASK] sauntered out to the pergola.
<name>Joseph</name>	Joseph	Peter	“What I have to say to you could not be confided to those fine fellows who brought you here. They would not have understood. I have had a mysterious dream, and I am informed that you can interpret it.” [MASK] leaned forward and listened attentively.
<name>Hitler</name>	Hitler	Simon	And the man was not exerting himself to compel attention. It was indeed a voice such as you had never heard in a public address: it singled you out. You! Yes — [MASK] — You! He edged in closer against the backs of his neighbors.
<name>Basil</name>	Basil	Arnon	The little porridge plate was always “pinakos” after that, and the little cup was always “poterion,” and the napkin was “soudarion.” [MASK], too, enjoyed the game. “Teach her to say ‘I love you,’ lone.”
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Peter	In two hours they had left the snow behind them and the men were taking off their leather jackets. [MASK] preferred to walk — and he walked alone, his gray head bent in serious meditation. He had made a mistake, it seemed.
<name>The Lone Ranger</name>	The Lone Ranger	Mencius	“Well —good luck —and fair weather.” They rose in their stirrups and exchanged a formal salute, for the benefit of the observant patrols. Spurs were put to the horses and the distance between them rapidly widened. [MASK] was glad to be on his way.
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Esther	They were walking slowly south in the direction of the old Sheep Gate. Although the whole Temple area for many blocks was densely packed, it was so much more quiet here that by comparison the street seemed almost deserted. [MASK] had recovered from her sudden weakness, but was silent and depressed.
<name>Elrond</name>	Elrond	Peter	“There will be nothing for you to do,” said [MASK]. “No meetings along the way, no healings; just a steady march to the city — and into who knows how much trouble.” For an hour they discussed the probabilities.
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Fara	Unable to think of an appropriate answer to that, [MASK] abruptly changed the subject by saying: “I could not help overhearing your talk about a prophet you met who said the world was to be punished for its misdeeds. Does he propose to attend to this chastisement?”
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	James	As I told you — there is something peculiar about the Carpenter’s voice. He doesn’t talk as other men do. Nobody — ever — talked — like that!” “But he didn’t do anything — out of the ordinary?” [MASK] wanted to know.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	David	“Does this penniless Carpenter expect to withstand a Roman invasion?” “The Romans will not invade his Kingdom, [MASK].” “I’m afraid I don’t understand, Master.” “No,” sighed the old man, “you wouldn’t understand.
<name>Edison</name>	Edison	Cornelius	The crowds increased. The highways were crowded with frantic relatives bringing their sick to be healed. Dusk came down. A servant slipped quietly into the room and lighted the lamps. [MASK] told him to serve supper here on the desk.
<name>Sinbad</name>	Sinbad	Pincus	The morning was bright and clear. The long wharf swarmed with the usual pack of filthy donkey-boys and villainous camel-drivers. [MASK] and his men were the first to leave the ship and were promptly swallowed up in the noisy throng of competitive caravan-owners.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Amon	[MASK]’s presence comforted him, but he was impatient to learn why she had been brought back by strangers. She tried to spare him, tried to take most of the blame, tried to temper his rising anger; but he demanded the full truth, and she told him everything.
<name>he</name>	he	Voldi	It was unlike any pilgrimage that [MASK] had ever seen. Like a river at flood, with swift currents channeling the central stream and sluggish eddies eating into the weeds and bushes of its banks, the crowd pressed on in silent, sober, sweating, desperate haste.
<name>King Auberon</name>	King Auberon	Peter	[MASK] viewed the wreck of his local project without dismay. Considering the enormous weight of the forces aligned against it, it was a wonder that it had been permitted even a brief existence. Its disintegration did not mean that the Kingdom was a failure.
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Philip	“How did you learn to speak it so well?” “It’s a long story, [MASK],” she replied. “Much too long to tell; and, besides, we must be going now.”
<name>Black Beauty</name>	Black Beauty	Darik	[MASK] tossed his head and snorted. “Is he dangerous?” inquired the farmer, dubiously. “Tame as a kitten, after he’s acquainted. I see you keep bees. Give him a little piece of honeycomb and he’ll be one of your best friends.
<name>Gregor</name>	Gregor	Voldi	After [MASK] had sat alone, staring absently at the fountain for a quarter hour, he was joined on the divan by the lawyer, who hoped he was not intruding. “Expect to be with us for a while?”
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Simon	And because he didn’t care to risk any further conversation with her, he closed his door, not noisily enough to give offense — he hoped — but with sufficient emphasis to accent his desire to be let alone. It turned out to be a bad night for [MASK].
<name>Unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name to fill in the [MASK] token.)	Unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name to fill in the [MASK] token.)	Jairus	“He wonders how the Master is feeling — and whether he is to wait.” “The Master is very tired,” replied [MASK]. “When he is rested I shall give him conveyance to wherever he wishes to go.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Fara	*###*# Having brought no camping equipment except a pair of camel’s-hair rugs, [MASK] slept for the first time in her life under the open sky. She retired early, for there was little else to do.
<name>John the Baptist</name>	John the Baptist	John	“No —I am not He,” answered [MASK], humbly. “I am but His courier, unworthy to stoop down and buckle His sandal-straps. I am but a voice, crying in the desert.
<name>the man</name>	the man	Esther	“I bid you both good-day.” With lengthened steps, he strode majestically away and proceeded slowly up the street toward his home. The women faced each other with inquiring eyes, puzzled over [MASK]’s predicament.
<name>Caecilius</name>	Caecilius	Simon	It was almost as if they expected an early invasion demanding flight, though anybody could see that the Romans weren’t ready for their long-threatened offensive. [MASK]’s sales hadn’t been worth the bother and expense of the trip and he was half minded not to do it again.
<name>Mr. Gatsby</name>	Mr. Gatsby	Cornelius	They took him directly to their well-appointed clubhouse, showed him to a beautifully furnished guest-room, and told him to rest until [MASK] came. He bathed, slept, and wolfed the food a servant brought him.
<name>him</name>	him	Hannah	She kissed [MASK] tenderly — and joined the plodding pilgrims. A friendly young woman told her it was a beautiful day, and she agreed; but her heart was heavy. “Are you alone?” asked her new friend.
<name>David</name>	David	Simon	By the time he was twelve [MASK] heartily despised the Synagogue and everything it represented because, he felt, it had made a loafer and a tiresome bore of an otherwise fine man. By a practice of great restraint, he never disclosed his private contempt for his father’s sanctimoniousness.
<name>Theoden</name>	Theoden	Mishma	[MASK]’s posture in the saddle was a score of years younger than his deep-lined face. They had little to say until they reached the old Counsellor’s gate: there they drew their horses together. “Shall we say good-bye, sire?”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Johnny	Go ahead, [MASK]. Tell us all about it.” The men were pleased to be included in the conversation. They pocketed their awls. Some rested their elbows on their knees and cupped their chins in their hands.
<name>he</name>	he	Hoseph	Since early morning he had been toiling on a broken plowshare, hoping to complete his task by the end of the day, but the sudden storm had darkened the shop, already at dusk, and he had given it up, complacently however for the gardens needed the rain more than [MASK] needed his plow.
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Simon	. He will listen . . . He will bless you. Some short-statured person was digging a sharp elbow into [MASK]’s back. He turned about and looked down into the contorted face of a woman with a little girl of five in her arms.
<name>Beth</name>	Beth	Rennah	“She is a most dutiful child.” “But now that you are getting well — ” “I have thought of that, [MASK]. She should be happy again. I wish we could think of something that might divert her. She has no interest in anything.”
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	Mencius	“I’d much rather not, of course,” sighed [MASK]. “It would please me to hope that The Torchbearer might some day come upon the one great man — with the one powerful lamp — that would illumine the highway — for us all!
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Simon	Let the patrols and the priests attend to it. The extreme weariness of the Carpenter made a bid for [MASK]’s sympathy. If it weren’t for making a spectacle of himself, he would like to get down into that front row and use his elbows.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Voldi	He had plenty of money. But he had no business acquaintances — and no business. And so it was that on the third day after his arrival, [MASK] received a polite note requesting him to call at the Prefect’s office in the Praetorium.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Voldi	[MASK] held her close and tried to comfort her. “You heard nothing more — about his death?” he asked, gently. “Was there more — to hear?” She raised her tearful eyes to search his face.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	lone	“If he is alive, he will stay alive. . . . You must see [MASK] now — and the King and Queen.” He glanced up at the sun. “And we should be on our way, if we expect to get there before nightfall.”
<name>Simon</name>	Simon	Peter	“If a man has enough faith,” replied [MASK], “he can find his way in the dark — with faith as his lamp.” i6 They were finishing a leisurely breakfast. It was the first time the four of them had eaten a meal together for many weeks.
<name>Death</name>	Death	Herod	Noting that his father was occupied, or pretended to be, the well-favored Prince strolled across to the high bank of cases which lined the eastern wall, drew out a new, heavily gilded scroll, read the title, and chuckled audibly. [MASK] regarded him with interest.
<name>Aunt Polly</name>	Aunt Polly	Sharon	“Is this By-Jove a heathen?” asked [MASK]. “Drink your milk, little one,” admonished her father, gently. “We’ll all have our fill of theology before the day is over, without beginning it now.”
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Hannah	[MASK] was visibly embarrassed and her heart raced. She had not reckoned on a question that would demand fuller explanation and her expression showed that she now regretted having introduced tire subject. Her confusion spurred the lawyer’s curiosity. He stepped closer and soberly searched her eyes.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Fara	And so it was that [MASK], briefly experiencing this singular sense of peace, gave it up for duty’s sake. But the Carpenter’s entreating voice continued to haunt her, and she had a mounting desire to hear him speak again.
<name>Gaul</name>	Gaul	Abraham	Often the contentious children of [MASK] quarreled; screaming, gesticulating and reviling; for both of their languages, stemming from a common origin, were rich with invective and ingenious in the contrivance of exquisite insults. Neither nation had ever sent an ambassador to the other’s court.
<name>Father</name>	Father	Master	Shaking her head, despairingly, she looked up through blinding tears and said, thickly: “It would do no good, [MASK]; not from me. I am unworthy.” “Then — perhaps you had better ask Him, first, to cleanse your heart of evil.
<name>he</name>	he	Simon	He couldn’t stand there on the comer any longer. Salutations were offered along the road to which he responded grumpily, in no mood for neighborly conversation. Not for a long time had [MASK] been in this part of the town, but nothing had changed.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	lone	The King and Queen are over there now. You must go — without a moment’s delay. I shall get you a fresh horse.” [MASK], pale, thin and nervous, crept timidly into the circle.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Leah	I don’t believe in any of it! . . . Not in any of it, I tell youl” His puzzled audience gaped at him for a long moment as he stood glowering. At length [MASK] broke the silence by remarking, in a disgusted drawl:
<name>Galileo</name>	Galileo	Socrates	They’re in the driver’s seat.” “Still think he’s ‘The Torchbearer’?” “Perhaps; I don’t know.” “Think a Torchbearer would let himself be condemned to death?” “It’s possible! [MASK] did!
<name>Titus</name>	Titus	Jairus	Even the beautifully crafted mosaics on the walls were dingy and lifeless. As they neared the high-arched doorway, [MASK] slowed to say, before they entered, “If our people want this sort of entertainment, I’ve no objection. The crops are all in.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Ephraim	Wearied by the day’s work, and drowsy in the darkness — for he had banked his forge-fire in preparation for leaving — [MASK] stretched out comfortably and fell asleep so soundly that he was quite unaware of the opening and closing of the double doors facing the street.
<name>Galadriel</name>	Galadriel	Peter	“I had to tell the truth,” [MASK] had replied. “I disowned my Master once. I think he depends on me not to do it again.” “But — did you have to say that the Master’s Kingdom would rule the world?
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	James	“You’ll be losing your job — if you aren’t careful!” [MASK] made no reply, but followed his brother. A moment later the silent sailors heard the clatter of oars in a dory’s locks. Craning their necks, they saw the little boat making toward the beach.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Simon	On the other side of the highway, a little farther on, three half-grown youngsters were lazily roping wheat-sheaves to the backs of as many shaggy pack-asses. [MASK] waved a hand to them, but they only stared back.
<name>Cleopatra</name>	Cleopatra	Salome	She was light as a feather, and almost completely unencumbered by clothing of any sort. Except for a braided chaplet of rubies, an elaborate design of pearl necklaces, and a fringe of sapphire-strands across her loins, [MASK] was nude.
<name>Ben-Hur</name>	Ben-Hur	Peter	Very much bewildered, [MASK] had awkwardly climbed onto the tall black horse they had brought for him; and there he was, riding along under the bright moonlight, in the company of Romans; to all appearances the same kind of Romans he had learned to hate!
<name>Balthasar</name>	Balthasar	Voldi	“You might have fooled me with your tatters,” he said — “but I knew you were in the city. What’s all this about, [MASK], selling your horse to the Tetrarch, and working as a hostler in his stables?”
<name>Cranmer</name>	Cranmer	John	“It is not for Your Majesty’s prisoner,” continued [MASK], “to conjecture why our God, in His wisdom, should have called to this important task a man so vain and selfish as Your Majesty; but His ways are mysterious and past finding out.
<name>Tom Buchanan</name>	Tom Buchanan	Antipas	I can’t think that any harm’s been done,” he added. “The Arabian is still in prison. . . . And— by the way —[MASK] has just arrived in town with his large party.
<name>Ulysses</name>	Ulysses	Simon	Thowing open the door of his tent, he beckoned to his body-servant who came running with a basin of water and an armful of towels. [MASK] plunged his bearded face into the basin and splashed the sleep out of his eyes.
<name>Cynthia</name>	Cynthia	Fara	[MASK] went on. “You would give up your duty and your distinction for me. Do you think I could ever be happy, in the days to come, knowing it was my fault that you were unable to serve your King and your country?”
<name>Arinbjorn</name>	Arinbjorn	Voldi	Slowing to a walk, as the distance between them lessened, [MASK]’s suspicions were confirmed. The stocky, shaggy fellow,' with the ragged tunic and the uncombed beard, couldn’t have afforded a mount of such value.
<name>John</name>	John	Sarah	[MASK], his aging wife, was barren. To solve this problem, the perplexed idealist had won the consent of his wife to permit his alliance with a beautiful young native in their employ. A son was born to them.
<name>Cassandra</name>	Cassandra	Voldi	“No, [MASK], I am not a prophet; nor am I guessing. The earth is a vast theater with many stages on which companies of actors present the same old play — a tragedy — in five acts.
<name>Phyllis</name>	Phyllis	Hannah	[MASK] was dependable in all weathers. She could be sympathetic without being silly. He hoped she would not question him about his absence from home. Maybe she would chatter him out of his despondency. He brightened a little and lengthened his stride.
<name>Siddhartha</name>	Siddhartha	Peter	[MASK] had suddenly acquired maturity. His resonant voice, when he spoke, had a tone of authority. There was no trace of pride or arrogance in it: indeed, it had something of the tenderness and compassion that had distinguished the voice of the Master.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Johnny	The rest of the day was spent in putting the nets and sailing tackle in order. The tension was relaxed. A frayed rope at the end of the mainmast’s boom broke with [MASK] and dumped him into the lake. They hauled him out dripping and everybody laughed.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	David	I am still a fisherman, but I own my ships and have a score and ten men in my employ.” “That is ever so good,” commented [MASK]. “I am glad you have prospered. I daresay you have a home — and family.”
<name>Black Elk</name>	Black Elk	Mencius	“So they do,” declared [MASK] — “and very properly, too. They lost their rating as conquerors, but they gained something much more valuable — the world’s respect. Everywhere they went, they carried their culture. They became known as the wise ones of the earth!
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Fara	“Your tents and furniture,” he said. “Everything will be put in place today, just as you left it. Your servants will be here soon.” “Oh —but you mustn’t! I cannot stay here!” pleaded [MASK].
<name>Mr. Stevens</name>	Mr. Stevens	Voldi	On the morning of the fourth day, the dining-room servant who had been bringing his meals said, as he put down the breakfast tray, “I understand, sir, that you are dining downstairs at noon.” “Yes,” said [MASK], as if he had been notified.
<name>Odysseus</name>	Odysseus	Fara	“It is quite clear that you do not realize the utter hopelessness of your undertaking, my child,” he said sadly. “I do not expect ever to see you again. . . . Farewell.” “Until we meet,” persisted [MASK].
