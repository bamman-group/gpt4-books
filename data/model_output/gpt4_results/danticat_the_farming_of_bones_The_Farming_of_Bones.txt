<name>he</name>	he	Sebastien	“Unless you want to die,” one of them says, “you will never see those people again.” When [MASK] returned from the compound that night, he was wearing a clean shirt and had washed most of the grass from his face.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Yves	The young men surrounded us, isolating us from most of the crowd faithfully watching the church doors and waiting for the Generalissimo to come out. As they circled us, [MASK] pulled out his machete and held it like a metal sash across his chest.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Podyab	I dragged my feet along, feeling now and then like other people were standing on them, people whose eyes were only a flutter away from mine, whose hands and fingers wandered freely towards me, whose lips shouted, “[MASK], poor devil,” in my ear.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Tibon	We reached the foot of the mountain by mid-afternoon. At the mouth of the forest was a small deserted settlement of thatched huts and wood cabins with long vines of tobacco leaves drying in roped layers around them. [MASK] limped to the first of five doorways lined up in a short row.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Yves	[MASK] limped out after her, then offered his hand to guide me over the threshold. Once outside, I clung to her shoulder as though it were a walking stick. The voices of the soldiers died down with the humming of trucks out in the square.
<name>Fermina</name>	Fermina	Valencia	I couldn’t stop thinking that perhaps an older member of her family, a Dona with a similar face, similar manners, and a voice similar to hers, had come to keep me company until [MASK] herself could talk to me.
<name>Elayne</name>	Elayne	Rosalinda	“And [MASK]?” She closed her eyes for a moment and rubbed her temples with her fingertips. “I know you cannot tell me if she will live or die,” she said. “You could not do this with my son.
<name>Bigfoot</name>	Bigfoot	Sebastien	I could still hear the thunderous waterfall crashing down inside my head, feel the spray against my face, even though we never got out of the car. [MASK], I didn’t find. He didn’t come out and show himself. He stayed inside the waterfall.
<name>Ilia</name>	Ilia	Ilestbien	“We called him lie,” she said, pushing her wet handkerchief towards me to show the embroidering of his name. “lie is a nickname for [MASK]. He told me that it means ‘he is well.’” We walked through the afternoon without resting.
<name>Haitian</name>	Haitian	Haitian	On the levee are a few river rats, young boys, both [MASK] and Dominican, who for food or one or two coins, will carry people and their merchandise across the river on their backs. The current is swelling, the pools enlarging.
<name>Alaric</name>	Alaric	Kongo	He didn’t want to take any chances with his only heir. Now [MASK] was bathing in the middle of the stream, scrubbing his body with a handful of wet parsley, while the sun climbed up in the sky above his silver-tipped hair.
<name>Hiroshima</name>	Hiroshima	Yves	Leaving [MASK] behind, I was taken past a line of people with burns that had destroyed most of their skin, men and women charred into awkward poses, arms and legs frozen in mid-air, like tree trunks long separated from their branches.
<name>James</name>	James	Yves	I pushed my way towards [MASK] to tell him. “We’ll try to wait,” he said, keeping his eyes down as we snaked through the tiny spaces between the swell of bodies. The cathedral was covered with lights from the steeple down to the front door.
<name>Emilio</name>	Emilio	Yves	“Please, don’t kill my son. A man can die of hunger, but a man can also die over a plate of food.” [MASK] put his spoon down and pushed his plate away. His mother chortled, even though no one was cackling along with her.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Yves	“How did you keep on with the planting, even when nothing was growing?” I asked [MASK]. I could hear him breathing loudly, tapping his tongue against the roof of his mouth, trying to find the right phrasing for his answer.
<name>Adunni</name>	Adunni	Kongo	“He told me he killed people in a war when he was a young man,” [MASK] said. “He couldn’t remember how many he’d killed but felt like each one was walking kot a kot with him, crushing his happiness.
<name>Yusuf</name>	Yusuf	Sebastien	“Everything you knew before this slaughter is lost,” she said. Perhaps she was encouraging me to embrace her son and forsake [MASK], even my memories of him, those images of him that would float through my head repeatedly, like brief glimpses of the same dream.
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Joel	“[MASK]’s well enough where he is. He’d want us to be glad for him. We should give him a joyous wake to send his spirit on its way. He would want us to laugh and be grateful he’s not here now.”
<name>Yannick</name>	Yannick	Yves	The next morning, I stumbled out of bed, ashamed to have slept so soundly and so late. The mother was sitting under the traveler’s tree outside, pouring steaming hot water over the powdered grains in her coffee pouch. “Where’s [MASK]?”
<name>Adela</name>	Adela	Juana	When we reached the road near the ravines, we saw three men walking ahead—” “Blessed Mother who gives life, forgive us,” [MASK] interrupted. She raised both her hands up in the air as though to complain to the stars.
<name>Chika</name>	Chika	Sinner	“You don’t know how long I prayed for a child myself,” she said. “I have no child, but even I know you must do more than pray.” “[MASK]!” She laughed and playfully slapped the back of my hand.
<name>Jonah</name>	Jonah	Sebastien	One night, in the awakened dark, when he is missing his father, [MASK] asks, “What was it that you admired most about your father?” I pretend that I cannot remember, but he insists.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Yves	“Tomorrow you may not be here!” [MASK] yelled back. “When we’re both home, we’ll have a Sunday meal together, you and me, except we’ll not eat too much, not enough to kill us.”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Sebastien	Perhaps she needed to cradle a cloud-soft child and pretend that it was hers. Besides, I had to go to my room and wait for [MASK]. Surely he would know what had happened, who had been struck by the automobile.
<name>Saladin</name>	Saladin	Henry	As a child, I played in the deserted war rooms of [MASK] I’s citadel. I peered at the rest of the world from behind its columns and archways, and the towers that were meant to hold cannons for repelling the attack of ships at sea.
<name>Jonas</name>	Jonas	Felice	“Maybe I should stand here and wait in case more arrive. We don’t want them to make so much noise knocking that the soldiers hear them.” The old woman and the young man peered into the darkness over [MASK]’s shoulder.
<name>Manuel</name>	Manuel	Joel	“[MASK] had a good woman,” I said. “You think of that one with the big black mark under her nose. I did not want her for him.” “She wanted your son,” I said. “She desired your blessings.
<name>Kambili</name>	Kambili	Sebastien	“You were squawking like a crazy parrot all night long.” After most of the workers had left for the stream, [MASK] and I went to a mud-and-wattle cooking hut near a wooden fence where the compound met an open dirt road.
<name>Minerva</name>	Minerva	Odette	I would go back with [MASK] to say her “pesi” to the Generalissimo, for I would not know how to say it myself. My way of saying it would always be—however badly—”perejil.” For somewhere in me, I still believe that perhaps one simple word could have saved all our lives.
<name>I</name>	I	Juana	Among the children was the boy I had given the goat bones to the night before. I poured him a full cup and then moved on to the others. [MASK] had rationed carefully, controlling the supply so everyone who wanted to could have at least a sip.
<name>Dobby</name>	Dobby	Joel	“The others have been out looking for him,” he said. “I think he took [MASK]’s body away because he wants us to let him be. I’m going to respect his wishes. He’ll come back when he wants.”
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Tibon	My words ran together, blurred and incomprehensible. They stopped listening, perhaps thinking that each attempt at a phrase was a complaint about leaving [MASK] behind. As we walked out of the palm grove, we found a tree-arched path leading down to the river.
<name>Emeka</name>	Emeka	Sebastien	I rose and walked to the door. [MASK] was standing there. He handed me two yams with the roots and dirt still clinging to them. The yams were from the small garden behind his room at the compound. Sometimes I cooked for him.
<name>Toussaint</name>	Toussaint	Henry	To the French generals who returned in fleets to reclaim these treasures and the souls of their slaves, [MASK] I had said, “I will not surrender the Cap until it’s in ashes. And even then I will continue to fight on these ashes.”
<name>Alanna</name>	Alanna	Unel	“[MASK] looked bad.” “Some of the people on the steps just came from the road,” she said. “Maybe I should stand here and wait in case more arrive. We don’t want them to make so much noise knocking that the soldiers hear them.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Yves	[MASK] and I were shoved down onto our knees. Our jaws were pried open and parsley stuffed into our mouths. My eyes watering, I chewed and swallowed as quickly as I could, but not nearly as fast as they were forcing the handfuls into my mouth.
<name>Yanko</name>	Yanko	Yves	[MASK] spent all his days planting in his father’s fields, then lingered with his friends and neighbors for late-afternoon talk after his work. I never saw him but only heard him undress and slip into bed at night when he finally came home.
<name>Jonas</name>	Jonas	Tibon	[MASK] became as quiet as everyone else after we left the sisters. We were going down a steep part of the mountain, which required a lot of concentration from all of us but most especially from him because of his limp and wounded ankle.
<name>Ignacio</name>	Ignacio	Kongo	“Her son is being buried this morning, so she may not be fully well.” I tapped my temples to explain any rifts in the senora’s reasoning. [MASK] dug his broom handle into the red dirt and started towards the house.
<name>Yorda</name>	Yorda	Yves	“I don’t want to die walking,” she said. “Gather your things and come,” [MASK] insisted. “No one dies walking.” “I already have decided,” she said. “I will stay here.
<name>John</name>	John	Sebastien	“In my place, would you believe this?” she asked. “No, I would not believe this,” I said. But in my heart I kept thinking, how could I not? Wouldn’t [MASK] have come home already if he was still alive?
<name>Enrique</name>	Enrique	Tibon	[MASK], I tell myself, today you are a bird.” He opened his arms and spread them, like the rare large butterfly that drifted past us now and then, testing new wings against the unfriendly currents of the mountain air.
<name>Pedro</name>	Pedro	Unel	Our time here has been joyful, but now I must say good-bye to you.” “I will stay and fight,” [MASK] said. “I work hard; I have a right to be here. The brigade stays to fight.
<name>Emilia</name>	Emilia	Sebastien	I could not accept that I’d never see [MASK] again, even though I knew it was possible, just as I would never see my mother and father again, no matter how many times I called them forth both with my own loud voice and the timid one inside my head.
<name>Elrond</name>	Elrond	Kongo	“Courage, dear one,” I said, trying to hold her up. “He was too young,” she said, “and [MASK] will not even let the others act in response to this.” “What can be done?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sebastien	A few ripe almonds had fallen off the branches. The seeds were cracked open, half buried in the soil. The broken fruits oozed a ruddy juice, which made it seem as though the ground was bleeding. • in- “What’s chasing you?” [MASK] asked.
<name>Emilio</name>	Emilio	Joel	I walked out into the night, past the ravine into which [MASK] had been thrown. Lemongrass and bamboo shoots lined the road. A breeze raced down the incline, the rustle growing louder as the grass blades bent towards the gorge at the bottom of the ravine.
<name>the child</name>	the child	Odette	“Her relations?” asked the priest. “We do not know where they are from.” The man with [MASK] in his arms was walking on the side of the road where the corpses had been hauled and laid out in rows.
<name>Enrique</name>	Enrique	Senora	“I am glad we never had to choose, [MASK].” “If you’d had to make this choice, I’d want you to look after my children. See what we’ve brought forth together, my Spanish prince and my Indian princess.”
<name>Alonso</name>	Alonso	Wilner	“Not me. I have two good eyes.” [MASK] turned to the Dominican sisters who were still watching the smoke and addressed them in Spanish. “You will travel with us no more,” he said.
<name>Arturo</name>	Arturo	Papi	“At least you are with us now.” In the parlor, [MASK] sat alone, as he did every night, in a corner near the parlor’s accordion-shaped radio, straining to make out an announcer’s voice without disturbing the others.
<name>Henrietta</name>	Henrietta	Papi	An eye for an eye, she had said. Did one only have to wish for it to make it true? “What are you going to do with [MASK]’s wood?” I asked. “What am I going to do with what wood?”
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Yves	[MASK] and I were crowded on a long school bench with many others and told to wait our turn. We tried not to look at the people around us, especially those whose bodies were bared, as if giving you permission to gape deep inside them.
<name>Amabelle</name>	Amabelle	Kreyol	“Please listen to me,” he whispered in [MASK]. “You must leave this house immediately. I have just heard this from some friends at the border. On the Generalissimo’s orders, soldiers and civilians are killing Haitians.
<name>Renata</name>	Renata	Mimi	“[MASK] too.” “They carried the doctor off with all those people who were to cross the border with him,” the old woman said. “The priests they took alone in a separate automobile. The priests begged the soldiers to let them stay with the people.
<name>Wildfire</name>	Wildfire	Micheline	she asked. “I did.” “She was always untamed for a young girl,” she smiled. “Her father gave her the name [MASK]. Did she ever tell you this?” “No,” I said. “She never did.”
<name>Adichie</name>	Adichie	Yves	My own mouth was still too bruised for hard foods. A full plate of fried goat meat remained on my lap. [MASK]’ mother walked over to me and asked, “Some soup for you? It won’t be too hot or too thick.”
<name>Chon</name>	Chon	Sebastien	“[MASK]’s well, he is,” he said. “He decided after what happened at the ravine that he didn’t want to waste more time. He sent me to ask you if you would promise yourself to him and keep yourself just for him.
<name>Shoulders</name>	Shoulders	Shoulders	[MASK] were shrugged. Eyebrows were raised. Burlap sacks and straw hats were removed from heads for a better look at the house. Discussions began and ended in the same breath. What did she want with them anyway? Maybe they were all going to be poisoned.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Sebastien	Thinking of [MASK]’s return made me wish for my hair to grow again—which it had not—for the inside of my ears to stop buzzing, for my knees to bend without pain, for my jaws to realign evenly and form a smile that did not make me look like a feeding mule.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Amabelle	You will tell me, [MASK], if you hear of this man, if you hear that he lived or died. You will ask your friends and then report to me.” “I will.” “Good-night, then.”
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Juana	I took the children’s dirty linen from a corner and carried it down to the basin of rainwater that [MASK] kept out in the yard for the wash. From the hill I could see some of the cane workers heading towards the fields.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Wilner	Chin-high grass surrounded the spot [MASK] chose for our crossing. The bridge lay far ahead, the curve of its iron girders dotted with night lights. The lamps moved from one end of the bridge to the next, making the distant sentinels seem like giant fireflies.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Wilner	A few sheets were thrown open from the bundles, and we all fared well enough with something between us and the cool dirt and something else to throw over our bodies. [MASK] ordered us not to light any fires, which might make us discernible from a distance.
<name>Theron</name>	Theron	Wilner	The salt stung my mouth. I spat it out on the front of what was left of my dress. “We will rest here tonight,” [MASK] said, sounding like the echo of his own voice. “Tomorrow, we go to the river.”
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Juana	He was wearing his well-worn, mud-stained shirt and gardening pants, the pockets bulging with seeds. [MASK] had given me a large cup of water to bring to him. “I brought you some water, “ I said, “so that you’ll suffer less with this heat. ”
<name>Emmanuel</name>	Emmanuel	Amabelle	“I am looking for [MASK],” he said through the crack in the door. Running his fingers over the verandah rail, he stood outside in the night and listened to the tree frogs croaking. “Please come,” I said.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Amabelle	My mother tells him to wait and see, to watch the current for a while. “We have no time to waste,” my father insists. “I’ll carry you across, and then I’ll come back for [MASK] and the pots,” my father says.
<name>Yanko</name>	Yanko	Papi	Like me, [MASK] had been displaced from his native land; he felt himself the orphaned child of a now orphaned people. Perhaps this was why he often seemed more kindly disposed to the strangers for whom this side of the island had not always been home.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Yves	I coughed and sprayed the chewed parsley on the ground, feeling a foot pound on the middle of my back. Someone threw a fist-sized rock, which bruised my lip and left cheek. My face hit the ground. Another rock was thrown at [MASK].
<name>Emilia</name>	Emilia	Odette	[MASK] laughed and I was calmed. We stayed awake for some time, waiting for the mountain to stir again. The stars stopped falling and slowly disappeared from the sky. We returned to our places, and perhaps because our bodies demanded it, most of us fell asleep.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Rafi	At the same time, she leaned over to have a closer look at her son’s sleeping face. “His sister’s cries will wake him,” she said. His sister’s cries did not wake [MASK]. There was no movement in him, no signs of life.
<name>Generalissimo</name>	Generalissimo	Juana	It took some time for her to turn around again. I felt I had to keep talking. “What became of your portrait of the Generalissimo, which was in the parlor in your old house, down the road? Where is [MASK]?
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Rosalinda	[MASK] remained asleep while I unbuttoned my blouse and placed her tiny cheek between my breasts and collarbone. I could instantly feel the air streaming in and out of her nose, her breathing falling into step with the beating of my heart. “Isn’t it miraculous?”
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Odette	The water guided [MASK] downstream. She was not paddling or swimming but simply letting herself be cradled by the current; her head dipped under now and then, and when it came up again, she opened her mouth wide to gulp in the air.
<name>beside</name>	beside	Odette	Taking hold of a boulder, I eased myself out of the current. We lay [MASK] facedown. Even though she was still breathing, she would not gain consciousness. It was as though she had already made her choice. She was not going on the rest of the journey with us.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Sebastien	“It is his son who died. He will know best what to do.” Every night [MASK] talks in his sleep. “Do you know what I would like to do?” he asks one night. “Tell me what you would like to do.”
<name>John</name>	John	Papi	From the floor you could see the imperfections in the finish, the shading differences, places where the tint didn’t match because [MASK] had waited too long before adding another coat, or where he had by chance brushed backwards, against the grain.
<name>Ramona</name>	Ramona	Sylvie	When we didn’t move, the anxious frown became more pronounced on her face; she wiped her sweaty palms on her lap and tried to temper the audible racing of her breath. “What is it, [MASK]?” asked the senora. “Are you ill?”
<name>Leah</name>	Leah	Rosalinda	After the sehora had eaten a few spoonfuls, [MASK] began to whimper. I picked her up and brought her to her mother. “My tiny little one, she must grow strong, or how will she defend herself when her brother wants to tussle?”
<name>She</name>	She	Juana	“How do you know I’m not a believer?” “Do you believe in anything?” [MASK] rubbed her closed hands together as though washing in the stream. After years of working as a housemaid, it was hard for her to remain still.
<name>Rusty</name>	Rusty	Yves	He sat up and leaned against the gray cement wall, looked at the doorway through the scarred fingers laced over his face. [MASK] yawned loudly from outside, waiting for the right moment to come in and bed down for the night.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Unel	He was told to go and arrest some people who were plotting against the Generalissimo at the church that night, then he was detained by those people who were on the road, that young man [MASK], the one who once rebuilt the latrines for us.”
<name>Anthea</name>	Anthea	Moy	I scream until I can taste blood in my throat, until I can no longer hear my own voice. Yet I still hold [MASK]’s gleaming pots in my hands. I walk down to the sands to throw the pots into the water and then myself.
<name>Yunior</name>	Yunior	Tibon	[MASK] tried to step back, but the young men shoved him forward, towards the stick. I moved to an empty space on my left and found myself stepping on one of the young men’s feet. His cheeks ballooned. He spat.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Papi	She swung her long braid from her back to her shoulder. The end of the braid landed on the closed parasol on her lap. “[MASK], you haven’t strolled past our house in some time.” She played with the braid while talking.
<name>God</name>	God	Misery	I remembered what my father used to say as he would hurry off with a knapsack of bottles filled with leaves and warm rum, as he raced to a birth or to a death, thinking of ways to encourage or halt the event. “[MASK] won’t touch you gentle.
<name>Garaged</name>	Garaged	Sylvie	There are many waterfalls still. If you like, I can show you the closest one that remains.” Garaged behind the main house was a wide, two-toned, green and white automobile with a yellow vinyl interior. [MASK] climbed into the back first.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Sebastien	I asked. “Tell him I am a man,” he said. “He was a man, too, my son.” [MASK] was sitting in a corner in his room, rubbing an aloe poultice over some blisters along his calves.
<name>Yakov</name>	Yakov	Papi	“Love cannot always be explained,” [MASK] said, his voice filled with a desire to understand. “I have seen this before. Your man, he believes that everything he is doing, he’s doing for his country.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Amabelle	I myself didn’t know if that story was true or even possible, but as the senora had said, there are many stories. And mine too is only one. “Come back to the house with us and stay tonight, [MASK],” the senora offered.
<name>He</name>	He	Wilner	She splashed the rest of the water on her face, washing her arm-pits and the space between her breasts. [MASK] wandered in and out of the huts, to see what other treasures could be found. He ran out with a pile of land papers in his hand.
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Yves	[MASK] came to see me what must have been a few days later. I wanted to thank him for caring for me during my fever. But how? He looked better now except for shreds of gauze taped in odd shapes on different sections of his head.
<name>the woman</name>	the woman	Felice	A couple—an older woman and a young man who looked like they might be related—moved towards the entrance. “I hear it was terrible on the road. We could hear all the noise coming from there,” [MASK] said.
<name>Yankel</name>	Yankel	Luis	My [MASK], he loves children. If they could grow out of the ground, he would have grown one for me long ago. At this moment in life, a woman asks herself: What good is all this flesh? Why did I have this body?”
<name>Thaddeus</name>	Thaddeus	Yves	They disagreed, though, on how long the journey should take. “We’ll be at the border before sunset tonight,” said [MASK]. “You have misjudged, my friend,” shouted the man with the uneven arms, “how long it takes for men to cross mountains!
<name>He</name>	He	Yves	Are they here or did they all die in the killing over there?” [MASK] said nothing. I went out to the yard, found the cooking fire and a basin of water, bathed myself with the bitter orange the way the woman in front of the cathedral had instructed.
<name>Enrique</name>	Enrique	Sebastien	[MASK] took four long boards, stained and polished, enough to build a coffin for a grown man. I offered to help him carry them, but he refused. “You stay,” he said. “I will come back.”
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Amabelle	“[MASK], can you not stay longer?” the senora asked. “I cannot stay at all,” I said. “Someone is waiting for me.” She drove very quickly back to the square, where the young man was waiting.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Sebastien	After I realized that [MASK] was not coming back, I wanted to find someone who would both help me forget him and mourn him with me. Perhaps this was too great a gift to ask of a man who was in search of the same thing for himself.
