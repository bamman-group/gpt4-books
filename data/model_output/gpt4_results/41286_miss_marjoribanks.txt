<name>Henrietta</name>	Henrietta	Lucilla	He went away, meaning to return immediately and have it out and know his fate. And [MASK], whose heart had come back, having fully ascertained who it was, and was now choking her with its beating, was left to await the new event and the new-comer alone.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Lucilla	If [MASK] had not been supported by a conscious sense of rectitude, she must have broken down before this universal disapprobation. Not a soul in the world except one supported her in her resolution, and that was perhaps, of all others, the one least likely to be able to judge.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Lucilla	"It was through that it was all broke off. I am sure I don't know whether he has regretted it or not, [MASK]. It is not always very easy to understand a gentleman, you know.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Barbara	Her heart leaped back, as she thought, to its right place when she first caught sight of that blessed apparition; and with her heart came the orange-flowers, and the wedding breakfast, and the veil of real Brussels for which [MASK] had so much wept.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Lucilla	People who like to discover the alloy which blends with all human motives, may suppose that [MASK] felt her own credit as the leader of society at stake, and would not admit that she had been duped. But this had in reality but a very small share in the matter.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Lucilla	But then [MASK] had, as all the ladies admitted, an influence over "the gentlemen," of which, as was natural, they were slightly contemptuous, even if perhaps envious, to some extent, of the gift.
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Lucilla	There was no comfort to her in the thought of the India shawl, which her son had gone to find. Any day, any hour, [MASK] might tell; and if the unlucky mother were put on her defence, what could she say?
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Lucilla	"I knew you would have laughed at me when I was depending on my mother; but now all that is over, [MASK]. I have loved you as long as I can remember; and I always thought--that you--cared for me a little.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Lucilla	It is one of my principles that too many young people are the ruin of society; but it is hard work, sometimes, when one is not properly supported," [MASK] added, with a gentle sigh. "If I can be of any use," said the amused soldier.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Lucilla	It is clear to me that you keep her shut up in a box." "Exactly," said [MASK]. "I don't mean to tell you anything about her. You may be sure, now I have found her out, I mean to keep her for myself.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Lucilla	But then if he did not mean it she meant it; and, after all, there are occasions in which the woman's determination is the more important of the two. So that, taking everything into consideration, there can be no doubt that it was very fortunate that [MASK]'s affections were not engaged.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucilla	Perhaps it was his fatigue which gained upon him just at this moment, and repulsed all livelier thoughts; but the fact is, that however willing [MASK] might turn out to be, her image was coy, and would not come.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucilla	"I hope you have had something to eat, [MASK]," he said; "don't get into that foolish habit of flying to tea as a man flies to a dram. It's a more innocent stimulant, but it's the same kind of intention.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Lucilla	The widow was still sitting at the window when [MASK] appeared tripping across the wet garden in her waterproof cloak, if not a ministering angel, at least a substantial prop and support to the lonely woman who trusted in her, and yet in the present instance feared her.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucilla	I dare say he thinks it is original," said the unhappy man. He thought he was pointing out his rival's weakness to [MASK], and he went on with energy--"I know you better than to think you can like that milk-and-water sort of thing."
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Lucilla	"I shall not know how to talk, nor look, nor anything; and then I know nobody; and then----" "My dear, you have always _me_," said [MASK], with tender reproach. "I am so sorry I can't stop any longer.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Lucilla	It will give me great grief to find that you, upon whose superior good sense I have so much calculated, should support her in her folly. I know how much she owes to you----" "Oh, no, she does not owe me anything," said [MASK].
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Lucilla	It is everybody's duty to leave him undisturbed; and then, you know, he is only a man, and does not understand; and if she won't pay any attention to me when I speak to her, oh, [MASK], tell me, what can I do?"
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucilla	I shall see you again before you go." "[MASK], don't be so cruel!" cried the unlucky Tom, and he caught her hand though they were at the window; "do stop a moment and listen to me.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucilla	She seemed to survey everybody with that defiant look which was chiefly awkwardness and temper, but which looked like pride when she was standing up at her full height, and in a conspicuous position, where everybody could see her. Most people concluded she was an Italian whom [MASK] had picked up somewhere in her travels.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Lucilla	"If you had kept your own place it would not have mattered; but I don't see how you are to get out of it. You see young ladies should let these sort of things alone, [MASK]." This was all the feeling he showed for her in her unexpected dilemma.
<name>She</name>	She	Lucilla	But then she had triumphed over the weakness, and triumphantly proved that her estimate of the importance of her work went far beyond the influence of mere personal feeling. In these circumstances [MASK] could contemplate her withered flowers with perfect calmness, without any thought that all was vanity.
<name>they</name>	they	Lucilla	It looked all very solid and substantial, and yet it was as unstable as any gossamer that the careless passenger might brush away. The two good people were so old that they had forgotten to remember they were old. But neither did [MASK] think of that.
<name>she</name>	she	Barbara	There was nobody in, and [MASK] did not see, any more than her lover did, why she should sacrifice any of her advantages. They were, on the whole, quite well matched, and stood in need of no special protection on either side.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Ashburton	"Tut--before long, to be sure," he said impatiently. "[MASK] would not be at all amiss if he liked it and you liked it; but it's no use making any suggestions about those things.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucilla	"It would have been a great loss to me if you had gone away. I shall never forget our talk about it here _that_ day, and how you were the first person that found me out." "It was not any cleverness of mine," said [MASK].
<name>Walpole</name>	Walpole	Carlingford	And then he had more need of it than most men have; and, when [MASK] signed his patent of gentility, and acknowledged and prized him, it did an infinite deal more than it had any intention of doing.
<name>Milly</name>	Milly	Barbara	He couldn't speak to me, you know, the first time; though indeed I shouldn't be the least surprised if he had followed--at a distance, you know, only to see where I live," said [MASK], turning round and searching into the distance with her eager eyes.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Lucilla	To add to these excellences, [MASK] had a mass of hair which, if it could but have been cleared a little in its tint, would have been golden, though at present it was nothing more than tawny, and curly to exasperation.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Lucilla	He was a worldly man himself, and he thought his daughter a worldly woman; and yet, though he thoroughly approved of it, he still despised [MASK] a little for her prudence, which is a paradoxical state of mind not very unusual in the world.
<name>he</name>	he	Barbara	"If you must go----" she said, so low that her father could not hear her, though the vigilant, suspicious little Rose caught the sound, and came a step nearer, like a little dragon, as [MASK] was disposed to think she was.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Lucilla	Everything went on delightfully so long as this interval lasted, and [MASK] herself did not disdain to recompense her faithful assistant by bestowing upon him various little privileges, such as naturally appertain to a subject whose place is on the steps of the throne.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Lucilla	"If you had only said you were engaged," the old lady exclaimed, "or not at home--or anything, [MASK]! You know, you need never stand on ceremony with me. No wonder he looked as if he could eat me!
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Lucilla	But I must say she has taken a very queer notion into her head--a thing I should never have expected from [MASK]--she says she will stay here." "Here?--ah--eh--what does she mean by here?" said the Colonel. "
<name>Florence</name>	Florence	Rose	But these soothing tones were too much for [MASK]'s composure. She cried, and her cheeks flushed, and her dewy eyes enlarged and lightened when they had thrown off a little part of their oppression in the form of those hot salt tears.
<name>Ursula</name>	Ursula	Lucilla	"I suppose those sort of things give them pleasure--things which neither satisfy the body nor delight the soul." "If it had been something to eat, would it have pleased you better?" said [MASK], moved for once in her life to be impertinent, like an ordinary girl.
<name>Charley</name>	Charley	Tom	It was not till more than an hour after that a succession of dreadful thumps was not only heard but felt throughout the house. It was [MASK], but he was not doing any harm to himself. He was not blowing out his brains or knocking his head against the wall.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Lucilla	She thought of them, and her heart sank within her; for it was not in [MASK]'s nature to live without a sphere, nor to disjoin herself from her fellow-creatures, nor to give up entirely the sovereign position she had held for so many years.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Nancy	She studied the countenance of her young mistress with the interest of a woman who has had her experiences, and knows how little _They_ are to be depended upon. [MASK] murmured "Poor dear!" under her breath, almost without knowing it, and then a brilliant inspiration came to her mind.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Thomas	He accepted the soup humbly, which [MASK] set before him, though it was a white soup, an effeminate dish, which went utterly in the face of his principles. And then he looked at the innocent young creature at his side in that flutter of happy confusion.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Lucilla	I have expressed myself very clearly----" [MASK] smiled compassionately, and with the gentlest tolerance, at this wild suggestion. "I was not thinking of Reform," she said, with that meekness which people assume when it is of no use being impatient.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Lucilla	Time enough for all the rest. The thing is, [MASK], to decide when you will leave off those formalities, and let It be. Why shouldn't it be now? Do you think my uncle would wish to keep us unhappy all for an idea?" "
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Lucilla	But at the same moment there came into [MASK]'s mind a name, a humble name, which has been often pronounced in the pages of this history, and it gave her once more a certain consolation. A sympathetic presence seemed to diffuse itself about her in her loneliness.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Lucilla	I calculated it all over last night, and I thought he would get home by the eleven train; but these trains are never to be calculated upon, you know, my dear. I _am_ a little disappointed, [MASK]. Poor dear!
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Lucilla	[MASK] knew perfectly well that it was only the baker, but it could not be expected that the Archdeacon should be similarly initiated into the secrets of the house. He thought, as was natural, that it was the people she expected, and almost wrung her hand as he let it go.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Lucilla	cried the honest fellow--and [MASK] could not but cast a despairing glance round her, as if appealing to heaven and earth. What was to be done with a man who had so little understanding of her, and of himself, and of the eternal fitness of things?
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Tom	"[MASK]!" she said, "of course it is you; nobody else would have been so impertinent. When did you come? Where did you come from? Who could ever have thought of your appearing like this, in such an altogether unexpected----?"
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Lucilla	[MASK] did not give him all the benefit of the uncertainty, for she began to get a little impatient, and to wonder, if the man had come to propose, as appearances suggested, why he did not do it and get done with it?--which was a very reasonable question.
<name>Blanche</name>	Blanche	Lucilla	"Yes; I hate a grand toilette when it is only a meeting of friends," she said--"for the girls, you know; of course you married ladies can always do what you like. You have your husbands to please," said [MASK].
<name>she</name>	she	Lucilla	Affairs were in this state when she took up her burden again boldly, and set out anew upon her way. It was a proof of magnanimity and philanthropy which nobody could have asked from her, if [MASK] had not been actuated by higher motives than those that sway the common crowd.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Barbara	"I dare say she would have lived if she could for all our sakes. But then you have always taken a false view of our position, [MASK]. We are a family of _artists_," said the little mistress of the School of Design.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Lucilla	she said, in her innocence. It was the first time such an idea had entered into her mind. "I don't think I have anything else," said [MASK]; though even as she said it she began to recover her spirits.
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Lucilla	Every creature has a soul. I am sure we say so in the Creed every day of our lives, and especially in that long creed where so many people perish everlastingly. So far from laughing, it is quite dreadful to think of it," said [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Tom	Accordingly, she drew her chair a little nearer to the window, and regarded [MASK] with a calm gaze of benevolent interest which was in perfect accordance with the sentiments she had just expressed; a look in which a gentle reproach was mingled.
<name>Pandora</name>	Pandora	Gulliver	"I don't mean to tell you anything about her. You may be sure, now I have found her out, I mean to keep her for myself. Her box is quite a pretty one, like what [MASK] had somewhere.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Lucilla	Do take him downstairs, and let him have something to eat. For myself," [MASK] continued, in a lower tone, "it is my duty that keeps me up. You know it has always been the object of my life to be a comfort to papa."
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Lucilla	Nobody could doubt who knew [MASK] that she would have gladly taken the world on her shoulders, and saved everybody from those little misadventures; but how could she help it if people absolutely would not take care of themselves? The Doctor smiled grimly, but he was not satisfied.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucilla	"Everybody says you are going to stay on, but we do hope it is not true, [MASK]," her friends said, in many voices. "It is dreadful for us to lose you, but you never _could_ bear it, dear."
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Rose	She had been amusing herself as she waited by working at a corner of that great design which was to win the prize on a later occasion. Readers of this history who have studied the earlier chapters will remember that [MASK]'s tastes in ornamentation were very clearly defined for so young a person.
<name>Mrs. Gaskell</name>	Mrs. Gaskell	Lucilla	"I have no doubt it was a very pleasant party, if one could have got the key-note," he said, in his Broad-Church way, as if there was nothing more to be said on the subject, and [MASK]'s Thursday was the merest ordinary assembly.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucilla	I don't mean to say _I_ am attached to [MASK], but you used to be, or to give yourself out for being. You flirted with her dreadfully in the winter, I remember, when those terrible Woodburns were here," she continued, with a shiver.
<name>Olga</name>	Olga	Lucilla	"There are a whole lot of children, and a pretty governess," said [MASK]. "It is a school, and I am so much interested in it. I may call it my school, for that matter. I came to know her in the funniest way;
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Lucilla	As for [MASK], her self-possession gradually came back to her when the crisis was over, and she felt that her involuntary abdication had lasted long enough, and that it was full time to take the management of affairs back into her own hands.
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Barbara	To be sure, it was a little hard upon a young woman of a proper ambition, who knew she was handsome, to fall back into housekeeping, and consent to remain unseen and unheard; for [MASK] was also aware that she had a remarkable voice.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Lucilla	"I am sure you are not well, or you could not have stayed away so long; but if you did not feel equal to going out, why did you not send for me, [MASK], my poor dear?"
<name>Blanche</name>	Blanche	Lucilla	The corners are for the people that can talk. It is one of my principles always to flirt in the middle of the company," said [MASK]; and again, as happened so often, ignorant people laughed and thought it a _bon mot_.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucilla	"Whether I intend?--oh, goodness, [MASK]! how can you speak so? as if I ever intended anything," said her companion, confused, yet flattered, by the possibility; to which the elder sage answered calmly, with all the composure in the world.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Lucilla	" "I do not see how papa can help it," said [MASK]. "I am sure it is very sad for him as well; but since dear mamma died there has been nobody but me to be a comfort to him.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Lucilla	I only wish I had had one of my headaches this morning, my dear, to keep me indoors for an old Malaprop. I do indeed, [MASK]. It would have served me right, and I should not have minded the pain." "
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Cavendish	"You've got a nice little house, [MASK]," said the General, "but it's too small for a married man, my boy. These women are the very deuce for turning a man out of his comfortable quarters.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Lucilla	Perhaps a touch more exquisite might still come in to round the full proportions of content. But, to tell the truth, [MASK] was so well off that it was not necessary to invent any romantic source of happiness to account for the light of well-being and satisfaction that shone in her eyes.
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Lucilla	She'll soon be an inmate herself if we leave her here," the Colonel said. They were all very sad and grave, and yet it was a droll scene; and then the old hero offered [MASK] his arm, and led her to the door.
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Lucilla	energy--"I know you better than to think you can like that milk-and-water sort of thing." "Oh, I don't pretend to know anything about politics," said [MASK]. "I hear you gentlemen talk, but I never pretend to understand.
<name>Griggs</name>	Griggs	Thomas	And the truth was that [MASK] did hear him, who had just opened the door to tell his young mistress that her luncheon was waiting, and whom the Archdeacon did all but knock downstairs in his sudden and unlooked-for exit.
<name>her</name>	her	Barbara	She did not reproach him, nor commiserate him, nor look at him with that mixture of wonder and tolerance and pity which other people had manifested. She did not even remark that he had grown stout. He was not a man fallen, fallen, fallen from his high estate, to [MASK].
<name>Eleanor</name>	Eleanor	Lucilla	No sort of acknowledgment passed between them of the obligations one had to the other, and, what was still more remarkable, no discussion of the terrible evening when [MASK] had held the Archdeacon with her eye, and prevented the volcano from exploding.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Lucilla	He said, "You are flushed, [MASK]? is anything going to happen?" with the calmness of a man who knew there was not much the matter--but yet he did observe that her colour was not exactly what it always was.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Lucilla	He is not so very young," said [MASK]. "He is quite as old as I am, though no one ever would think so. I am sure he is honourable, but what has that to do with it?
<name>Verena</name>	Verena	Rose	The idea of practically exemplifying, in her own person, the kind of demeanour which society ought to expect from an artist had not occurred to [MASK]; but destiny having arranged it so, she was not the woman to withdraw from her responsibilities.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Lucilla	She knows how to put _him_ down at least," the Doctor said to himself, well pleased; and he was so much amused by his daughter's superiority to the vulgar festivity of parties, that he almost gave in to the idea of refurnishing the drawing-room to suit [MASK]'s complexion.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Helen	"My poor [MASK]," he said, coming back to her when he found she had stopped speaking, "I don't see why you should not come, if this sort of thing is any pleasure to you; but afterwards----" he said reflectively.
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Barbara	Instead of a failure, such as for a moment seemed likely, she had a triumphant success. She, and she only, said a word of kindness to her formerly triumphant rival. She drove her chariot over [MASK], and drew an advantage even from her sullen looks and red eyes.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Lucilla	And, to be sure, whenever anybody was tired of the music, there were quantities of corners to retire into, not to speak of that bright spot full of yellow light under the lime-tree. "Nobody but [MASK] ever could have thought of anything so delicious," was what everybody said.
<name>John</name>	John	Tom	"[MASK] is tired," said the Doctor; "and there are no new carpets coming out of my pockets. Besides, he's going to bed, and I'm going downstairs to the library. We may as well bid you good-night."
<name>Samuel</name>	Samuel	Thomas	He went off humbly and opened the window when he was told to do so, and tried to find the eau-de-Cologne on the table; while [MASK] rushed downstairs for water at a pace very unlike his usual steady rate of progress.
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Lucilla	You can have as much red and green as you like abroad, where the sun is strong, but here it would be bad style," said [MASK]; from which the most simple-minded of her auditors drew the natural conclusion.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Nancy	and then she awoke to the practical exigencies of the position. "There will be quantities of people coming to have a cup of tea, and I must speak to [MASK]," she said, and went downstairs with a cheerful heart.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Lucilla	Naturally the unfitness of these surroundings to witness a revolution so unlooked-for and disagreeable struck [MASK]. If she had to be again humiliated, and to submit once more to see another preferred to herself, it certainly should have been under other circumstances.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Lucilla	To have the control of society in her hands was a great thing; but still the mere means, without any end, was not worth [MASK]'s while--and her Thursdays were almost a bore to her in her present stage of development.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Woodburn	" cried the trembling woman. "What do you suppose she can know? She gave me a dreadful fright, coming and asking about you and your name. And then she never was a great friend of mine--and if she should say anything to [MASK]!
<name>George</name>	George	Lucilla	She hid her face in her hands and blushed down to the very edge of her black dress and up into the glooms of her widow's veil; and all the self-defence she was capable of was a faint "Oh, [MASK]!"
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucilla	"If you have any feeling as if fever was coming on," said [MASK], "I think you should go upstairs and lie down a little till papa comes in. I heard there had been some cases down about the canal.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Lucilla	Of course we all love each other. What is the good of being relations otherwise?" said [MASK] calmly; "it is such a natural thing, you know. I suppose it is because you are going away that you are so affectionate to-day.
<name>Job</name>	Job	Nancy	" "Sir," said [MASK] austerely, "them is things as it ain't needful to name; that ain't the question as I was asking. Supposin' as things come to such a point, what am I to do?" "Bless me!
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Lucilla	He gave a glance up at the windows as he passed her door, and felt a kind of disagreeable satisfaction in seeing how diminished the lights were in the once radiant house. And [MASK] was so fond of a great deal of light!
<name>Jove</name>	Jove	George	She was pale, almost white, and had dark eyes and dark hair, and possessed precisely all the accessories which make a sudden change of complexion remarkable; and the effect this evening was so evident that even her husband admired her for a moment, and then stopped short to inquire, "By [MASK]!
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Lucilla	But there could be no doubt that [MASK] had more colour than usual. Her pulse was quite steady, and her heart going on at its ordinary rate; but her admirable circulation was nevertheless so far affected, that the ordinary rose-tints of her complexion were all deepened.
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Lucilla	"My dear aunt," she said at last, "I can see nothing and hear nothing, and you know as much about what is going on as I do"--which, it will be acknowledged, was not an answer such as one would have expected from [MASK]'s perfect temper and wonderful self-control.
<name>Turner</name>	Turner	Willie	We have no wealth; but we have some things which cannot be purchased by wealth," said the drawing-master, with mild grandeur; and he looked round upon the walls of his parlour, which were hung with his own drawings, and where one of [MASK]'s held the place of honour.
<name>Miss</name>	Miss	Lucilla	Under such circumstances, the poor woman, amid her cares, may be excused if she looked back a little wistfully at [MASK] going home all comfortable and independent and light-hearted, with no cares, nor anybody to go on at her, in her sealskin coat.
