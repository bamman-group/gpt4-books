<name>McCandless</name>	McCandless	Ron	"Cheer up,” [MASK] said. "You do nice things on the sweet potato there. I have a guitar inside—I’ll get it out, and we can play together, hey?” He grabbed hold of the guy line and started to climb hand over hand.
<name>Phaedrus</name>	Phaedrus	Elmer	"Because they’ve been doing it longer than thou hast.” “I don’t mean about my work. I mean about my trip and the message and everything.” "Oh.” [MASK] shrugged. "Simplex, complex, and multiplex.”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Sam	He said that [MASK] was right. And then he told me he was going to kill me.” "It sounds like a bad joke.” "It wasn’t--” I watched her struggle to find words to tell me what it was. "
<name>The Giver</name>	The Giver	Jo	"But I don’t understand how—” "By then you will,” [MASK] said. "Reassure him. Tell him he’ll learn what his message is by the time he has to deliver it. He’s a very insecure little boy.”
<name>John</name>	John	Jo	He shook it back. The kitten rubbed his ankle, giggled again, then darted around the boulder. [MASK] followed—then threw himself back against the rock. The claws of his left hand and the nubs of his right ground on the granite. He sweated.
<name>Stradlater</name>	Stradlater	Lump	The panting ceased to be something happening inside his ear and settled to a reasonable sound a respectable number of feet away. "Do you want to speak to him, or shall I?” "You go ahead.” "Who are you?” [MASK] asked.
<name>George</name>	George	Amos	Now if you dive through here, you can swim out from under the boat.” "And once we get out from under the boat,” said [MASK], "we can climb back in.” "Why should we do that?
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Amos	The trap door had been nailed firmly shut this time, and even [MASK] could not think of a plan. "Cast off for the greyest and gloomiest island on the map,” cried the grey main. "Cast off!” cried the sailors.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Edna	"You really think I’d turn you in?” “Button it up.” He did. Then he said, "Oh.” And then, "You know, it's midnight." "So?” "[MASK] just gave me the Word.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jo	He was still holding the guitar by the neck. He pushed open the door, and something grabbed [MASK] by the stomach and twisted. Tears mounted in his eyes, and his mouth opened. His breath began to come very slowly. "Really hit you, didn’t it?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jo	[MASK] stood up, and concern deepened the young lines of his face. "That’s a very important message.” The concern turned to a frown. "When will I be ready to deliver it?” Whenever someone has come to free them.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jo	Just get there, no matter how long.” "Wha’ hell I say when I ge' there?” [MASK] demanded. Then he thought of all the things he should have already asked. "Whe’ ya fum? Whe’ ya go’?
<name>Lara</name>	Lara	Vondra	"I’m laughing,” [MASK] said, as she stood up, "at your cyhnk—at your stupid sygn—for the same reason I laughed at it when I first met you.” On the ground the glowing metal darkened to red; red faded toward black.
<name>Aphrodite</name>	Aphrodite	Kirke	After he drank it, his talk grew more coherent. Once, when he stopped suddenly, after a whole dozen sentences that had actually made a sort of sense to her, she ventured: "The ruins of [MASK]'s temple are an evil place.
<name>Nakamura</name>	Nakamura	Arty	"How did you get to pull him out?" "Once you got going, [MASK]’s security managed to jam the elevator service above the seventy-first floor, so we didn’t get to the lobby till after you were out of the building.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Jo	The melody was like a rainbow slick over his mind, calming, spreading. "I’ll sing anoth—” "No,” [MASK] said. "Let me just think about that one awhile." She smiled and dropped her hand, silent, over the strings.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Sam	When we get hold of a couple of cases of liquor, we have some pretty wild times up here. [MASK] came down to the forge to fool around. He heated up one end of a pipe and started swinging it at people. He liked to see them jump and holler.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Arty	Heard you’ve been looking into the security business yourself,” which was true. "Good idea. Very good. I like the way you’re handling yourself.” "Thanks. [MASK], I'm not feeling too hot this evening.
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Clikit	I mean a state that is eternal, unchangeable, imperturbable even by death ...” Her last word did not really end. Its suspiration, rather, became one with the sound of rain hissing through a broken roof in some upper corridor. Now! thought [MASK].
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Norn	As the rest of us fought to save the ship, I turned for a moment and saw [MASK] standing at the front, staring out at the glittering sun at which we hurtled. He had begun to laugh. Struggling to pull us back on course, I demanded. "
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Amos	"Don't I get a chance to rest?” asked [MASK]. "I have been climbing up and down mountains all night.” "You may take a nap,” said the grey man. "But come and have breakfast first.”
<name>Sal</name>	Sal	Lump	"Well I could, [MASK].” "Why did you leave, then?” "Well, because of the message and because there were a lot of things I don’t think I really appreciated. I don’t think I was ready to leave.
<name>Deep Thought</name>	Deep Thought	Comet	"Then I'll say you're a computer. But let’s get going. We'll be here for hours if this keeps up. I can feel another one of those discussions starting.” He stood up from under the desk and started for the door. "[MASK]?”
<name>Curley's wife</name>	Curley's wife	Bigfoot	How'm I gonna eat!” he demanded. "You gonna let me up to eat?” "Calm down a little. We'll send someone in to feed you.” A few minutes after the dinner bell rang that evening, [MASK] looked into the room.
<name>Amos</name>	Amos	STAN	D I [MASK] = T S T A R S "Look, you've got a kid back there at the anvil who needs a doctor. You say he's a good part of your bread and butter. And you let him walk around with a face like that?
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Norn	"I don’t think there's anything we can do.” The light through the greenish jelly gleamed on his fear-stained face. I looked back at [MASK], who still hadn't moved, as the blot of illumination spread over the darkness.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Amos	As the man started to go, [MASK] said, "It seems a shame to take someone’s clothes away, especially since I might not come back anyway. Give my rags to whoever owns the suit to keep for me until I return.”
<name>John</name>	John	Bigfoot	Ear, cheek, neck, and left shoulder were bandaged. Blood had seeped through at the tip of his clavicle to the size of a quarter. In one hand [MASK] held a tin plate of rice and fatback, in the other an iron spoon.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Mabel	"Hi, [MASK]. How’s the midnight oil?” "If you strain it through white bread, reduce it over a slow Bunsen, and recondense the fumes in a copper coil, I hear you have something that can get you high."
<name>Lee</name>	Lee	Faust	He ground his canvas palm against his face. ([MASK]’s electric bass ground against a suspended dissonance.) As he staggered down the walk, hot solvent rained on his back. Then something inside went wild, and he began to swing his arms.
<name>John</name>	John	Blacky	She shook her head. "[MASK], we're going to have a problem, you and I.” "How so, ma’am?” "Again: you are going to have a problem with me. I am going to have a problem with you.”
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Jo	I left the incident out because I thought it was disqracting and assumed it was perfectly deducible from [MASK]'s question what had happened, sure that the multiplex reader would supply it for himself. I have done this several times throughout the story.
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Danny	[MASK] steadied her. "Would you mind telling me what brings you here this hour of the morning?" After five silent seconds I thought she was playing a joke. I spent another paranoid three thinking I was about to be victim to a cunning nefariousness.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Buddy	He came over, sat on the edge of [MASK]'s bed, and kicked off one canvas shoe. "They told me I should come in and feed you, kid." He kicked off the other one. "You real hungry?"
<name>Dirk</name>	Dirk	Lea	"Second,” said [MASK], "who is standing just behind your right shoulder?” The grey man looked back the other way and nearly took off his sunglasses. The he decided it was not necessary, for all he saw was a mass of confusing colors.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Gods	"I'm gonna fly!” Fly till my stick pokes a hole in the night! [MASK], you hear that? We’re coming at you! We're gonna beat you to death with broomsticks and roar the meteors down before we’re done....”
<name>Rumpelstiltskin</name>	Rumpelstiltskin	Amos	"I gave him food and water when they brought me some. I think he’s asleep now.” "Good,” said [MASK]. "So one-third of your magic mirror has been found. Tomorrow evening I go off for the second piece.
<name>Rocky</name>	Rocky	Hawk	"Brilliant idea,” I concluded. "You want a couple of thousand back for the service?” The idea didn't amuse him. "I don’t want anything from you.” He turned to [MASK]. "I need something from you, kid.
<name>Link</name>	Link	Jo	"T'chapubna," the boy said, and pointed again. Then he put his hands to his mouth as though he too were playing an ocarina. "You wanna try?” [MASK] asked and then wished he hadn’t, because the boy was so dirty.
<name>Glumphvmr</name>	Glumphvmr	Amos	The grey man looked after [MASK] until he disappeared. Then he put his hand on his forehead, which was beginning to throb a little, and leaned against the black trunk, which had been carried to the deck. Glumphvmrcame from the trunk.
<name>Case</name>	Case	Jo	Can’ make no music.” Which maybe half made sense, maybe. "Where ya from?” [MASK] asked. "Jus' a shuttle-bum,” the boy repeated. Now he pointed to the pink moon-moon above the horizon. "
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Fidessa	People stopped talking when I passed. Whenever I turned, somebody looked away. Whenever I looked at one of the upper porches, somebody moved away. I had been walking twenty long minutes when I finally came into a room to find [MASK], smiling.
<name>Dagny</name>	Dagny	Danny	[MASK], come out here!” Barefoot, soot-smeared, the smears varnished with sweat: bellows and hammers had pulled the muscles taut, chiseled and defined them, so that each sat on his frame apart.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Vondra	I have no idea what a family is." "You are being disingenous. You know as well as I do: A family is a mother, a father, and a son," [MASK] said, with the same voice to inculcate the obvious.
<name>mine</name>	mine	Jo	He was barefooted, shirtless, and his frayed pants were held on by rope. His hair was of some indiscriminately sexless length and a good deal more snarled than [MASK]’s had been. He was very dirty, but he was grinning. "Hey!’’
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Buddy	And don’t let me see your knee touch the—” [MASK] straightened his shoulders. And slipped. He went over on his backside, grabbed the pail; water splashed over him, sluiced beneath. Soap stung his eyes. He lay there a moment.
<name>Queen Arden</name>	Queen Arden	Omegahelm	And you will find, in your southern desert, near your furniture cooperative, a new home being built for you, its basements sunk as many stories beneath the scrumbly soil, and its upper courts raised as many stories above it, as [MASK]’s courts and basements.”
<name>Jill</name>	Jill	Charona	"I gonna ge' off this planet—now!” [MASK] raised the bare flesh where her eyebrows would have been. "Thou seemst a mite determined. Thou art the first person bom here to tell me that in four hundred years. Return thou.
<name>Wintermute</name>	Wintermute	Jo	"You’ve had a lot of experiences recently. Order them multi- plexually and they will be much clearer. And when they are clear enough, enough confusion will remain so that you ask the proper questions.” [MASK] was silent for a moment, ordering.
<name>Athena</name>	Athena	Sue	I slew the thought). Then again, I was still feeling pretty belligerent. Hell, who wants to take your debate rival to a party. I looked back at the monster. [MASK] sat at the top of the step, reading. "Hey!”
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	Roger	Now I understood what granny had been trying to get across with her anecdote. "... you don't know what’s going on up here. You've wandered around for half an hour, and nobody but me and [MASK] have said a thing to you.
<name>The Doctor</name>	The Doctor	Jo	He started down the street. "I hope he made the sun. "They couldn’t put her to sleep with something or maybe hypnotize her?” [MASK] mused, staring through the glass wall back in the console room.
<name>June</name>	June	Danny	I say we’re just trying to live.” "Suppose [MASK]’s eye infection decides to spread? I’m not casting moral aspersions just to gum up the works. I’m asking if you're even doing what you want to.” He played with his ring.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Lady	I mean a very bad one...Something in the expression that hugged her high cheekbones, that balanced over her lightly cleft chin made him want to tell her everything about himself. "But you don't have to be afraid of me, [MASK]. No, really!
<name>Odin</name>	Odin	Hidalga	And [MASK]’s word should be proof enough for anybody. Now, what do you look like?” "What do I look like?” demanded the North Wind. "Yes, describe yourself to me.”
<name>He</name>	He	Ron	Oh, I see.” He put the guitar down. "I guess it’s good you're going with the shipment of Lll then.” I smiled to myself. [MASK] was a multiplexually educated young man.
<name>Dean</name>	Dean	Roger	"I'd dig to see you spread all over that mountain.” "If you don't pull out, you'll never get the opportunity.” "Shit,” [MASK] said. His elbows went out from his side. The broomstick vibrated.
<name>Lucifer</name>	Lucifer	Devil	We’re dying.” "We’re not trying to kill you.” "You are.” "When I get down from here, I'm going to do quite a bit of proselytizing. [MASK] often speak with”—I took another bite of bread—"honeyed tongue.
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Amos	Now [MASK] looked over his shoulder too and saw that the white disk was going slowly down. They began again, climbing faster than ever, but in another hour the bottom of the moon had already sunk below the edge of the ocean.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Danny	So you two got scared and left?” "I wasn’t scared then.” Her voice retreated to shortness. She glanced up. "I'm scared now.” Swaying gently, [MASK] put one foot on top of the other and meshed his toes.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Jo	One of the things was trying hard to struggle free. The devil-kitten, oblivious to the agony inside, pranced to the base, spat haughtily, and pranced back. As [MASK] chanced a breath, the thing inside broke out. It staggered forward, smoking.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Gylda	[MASK] pushed away, backing across the rock. As her head moved, Pretania-IV light caught her features: pain! Pain too startling even to let her scream; so she choked and gagged and snarled, scrambling backward, managing somehow to get her knees under her.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Billy	"Well, come in, then,” said [MASK], "and play me a game of jackstraws, and you can tell us all about it.” They went back into the tavern, wheeling the barrow before them. "What is this?
<name>the grey man</name>	the grey man	Amos	"Friendship is a rare thing these days,” said [MASK]. "What sort of help do you and your friend need?” "The question is: would you be willing to give it?” said the grey man.
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Alexis	What’s that humming overhead—?” when a large woman wrapped in a veil of fading fabric tottered across the rocks, screaming. Her hands were clawing at her covered face. [MASK] sloshed soda over his sleeve, and the man said, "Oh my God!
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Clikit	[MASK] remembered the burden clutched behind him. Was it lighter? He felt lighter. His brain floated in his skull, now and again bumping against the portals of perception at eye or ear. And they were turning. She was turning.
<name>Zaphod</name>	Zaphod	Amos	"Then come with me,” said the grey man, and the rough sailors with cutlasses rose about him and hoisted the trunk to their grimy shoulders—Onvbpmf came from the trunk—and r the grey man flung out his cape, grabbed [MASK] by the hand, and ran out into the street.
<name>Link</name>	Link	Jo	You can rest up and make plans there. Sit back and relax. We'll be there in three or four minutes.” [MASK] sat back. He didn't relax, but he took out his ocarina and played on it until a door opened in the front wall.
<name>Queequeg</name>	Queequeg	Elmer	"Yeah. What is it?” “[MASK], how come everybody knows more about what I'm doing on this boat than I do?” "Because they’ve been doing it longer than thou hast.” “I don’t mean about my work.
<name>Casey</name>	Casey	Ron	"Wha'? Jhup—” "Not now, noplex! Wait till he's finished.” "But you just—” "You're not me,” [MASK] explained, "and he wasn’t trying to balance the load when I stopped him.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Fidessa	I glanced at [MASK]’s powdered hips. They rocked with her walking: I didn’t look away. "Look.” I stopped three steps from the doorway. "About the power installation here.” Light over my uniform deviled the bottom of my vision.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sue	The other foot was bare, a length of black chain around the ankle, two toes, little and middle, gone. I looked back at his face to see his eyes come up to mine. Well, I was still sans shirt; back at the chameleon [MASK]’s pants leg was still rolled up.
<name>Boss</name>	Boss	Elmer	"If I gotta work, I don't mind. The boy pulled himself upright on the wire. "Hey, [MASK],” he called. The man looked back, then flipped a switch on his wrist-console, and the robo-loaders all halted.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Mabel	"Look, I haven’t been trying to gloss over anything I saw-on—” At which point [MASK] stood. Silence. You-know-what were passing. Something clanged on the skylight: cracks shot the pane, though it didn't shatter.
<name>The grey man</name>	The grey man	Amos	"Then what are the treasures ?” [MASK] asked, full of curiosity. "The treasure is happiness, for me and my nearest and dearest friend.” "How do you intend to find it?” "In a mirror,” said the grey man.
<name>Kvothe</name>	Kvothe	Clikit	He knew he would not have it long, unless he stopped to break the strap at the weak spot and retie it. [MASK] reached the wall and peered around, cautiously, for light. In a broken frame above, a blue window let in lyrian radiance.
<name>Atkins</name>	Atkins	Mabel	But they made the vegetarians look healthy: at least they got it out of their systems. The one before that—” "[MASK]—” "I assume you're interrupting me because you’ve gotten my point.” "You were talking about ways of life before.
<name>archangel</name>	archangel	Blacky	It was, I realized, the same stream the Gila Monster was parked across a mile below. "You know I’m new at this job, [MASK],” he said after a while. "I’ve just been archangel a couple of weeks.
<name>Casey</name>	Casey	Alexis	[MASK], who had pressed the autobar (odd how automation has become the upper crust’s way of flaunting the labor surplus) for more crushed ice, looked up, saw what was about to happen, and pushed the cut-off button. The autobar hummed to silence.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Pitt	[MASK]’s a funny kid.” The passing wrinkles on a seventeen-year-old girl's face are charming. "But I like her.” She looked up, took hold of my thumb, and asked. "When are we going?"
<name>Kvothe</name>	Kvothe	Flame	[MASK] turned the drops on his cheek and hair to flickering copper and blood. He banged his fists against his wet thighs, took a deep breath, and against the roar and the bells and the whispering, he Sang. Two people ducked back into two elevators.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Mabel	"I'd go up the wall anyway.” "Knew that's what you’d say.” "Knew you’d make me say it.” "Well,” I said, "[MASK] asked me to come around to her office.” "Yeah.
<name>Ed</name>	Ed	Alexis	Five. Six. "Fine,” I said. "How about throwing in the briefcase?" "Ask [MASK] for a paper bag. If you want, I can send them—” "Give them here.” The humming was coming closer.
<name>Gabriel</name>	Gabriel	Roger	Her hands closed and broke like moths. "I came here first because I... wanted to warn you.” "Of what?” "[MASK]—I think him and the rest of the angels are going to try and rumble with you here.”
<name>Deckard</name>	Deckard	Jo	[MASK] asked. "You'd almost forgotten about them, hadn’t you?" "No I didn’t.” "You see, my mind is a Lll mind.” "But you don’t make me sad.” "I’m half Lll and half machine.
<name>Han</name>	Han	Lump	“Hey, [MASK],” he called, "is this guy putting me on?” He doesn’t really need to know what my ship is made of, does he? If he’s putting me on, I’m going to go.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Roger	You gonna fly the moon off the sky? I can see three stars up there! Who's gonna put them out?” [MASK] balanced on the cycle rack, feet wide, fist shaking at the night. "I'm gonna fly!”
<name>Pham</name>	Pham	Jo	"I’m afraid that wouldn’t do much good. We’re only up to volume one hundred and sixty-seven: Bba to-Bbaab." "It’s common term is jhup.” [MASK] said. The mem smiled benignly at him. "
<name>Calypso</name>	Calypso	Lea	" asked [MASK], smiling. "A piece of the mirror I am trapped in lies at the bottom of this pool. Once I myself dived from a rock into the blue ocean to retrieve the pearl of white fire I wear on my forehead now.
<name>Simon</name>	Simon	Ron	and the Lll and the boy began to push their way toward the edge of the crowd, to begin a journey as incredible as the one I have recounted, while [MASK] stayed there, open mouthed, incredulous at the sacrilege.
<name>Phylo</name>	Phylo	Comet-	But multiplexity had awakened. "I shall try and explain something to thee, [MASK] Tell me, what's the most important thing there is?” "Jhup,” he answered promptly, then saw her frowning. He got embarrassed. "I mean plyasil.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Fidessa	Do you know what holds these guys here? I don’t. I do know it’s weaker than you think.” "[MASK] says they’ve been drifting away.” "I’m not out to make any man do what he don't want.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Amos	Down the block the sign of the Mariner’s Tavern swung in the breeze. [MASK] ran to get his wheelbarrow, put the prism on top, and wheeled it to the mirror. Then, just in case, he went back and locked the trunk tightly.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jack	For that is the same question asked me a year and a day ago by a wizard so great and so old and so terrible that you and I need never worry about him.” "What did you say to him?” asked [MASK].
<name>me</name>	me	Lll	I’m definitely going. But... well, if I were—now be honest—just lumping along the street, do you really think people would just say, ’Oh, there goes a linguistic ubiquitous multiplex,’ and not think about [MASK]?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Mabel	"We were, it was, and it was.” "I didn't know.” [MASK] looked adequately sincere. "Don’t tell me you didn’t guess?” "Don’t joke ... well, joke if you want.”
<name>Singer</name>	Singer	Hawk	I watched [MASK] because I'd never had a chance to observe one Singer at another's performance. He put the blackened soles of his feet together, grasped his toes, and leaned forward, veins making blue rivers on his neck. Tlie top button of his jacket had come loose.
<name>Casey</name>	Casey	Jo	"It's the first one finished and will be the last to be repopulated.” "Why?” [MASK] asked, stepping over the new cast-iron gutter grating on the curb. The bluish sun flamed in the spiral window that circled the great tower to their left.
<name>Doc</name>	Doc	Scott	The high voltage effect in the housing causes a brush discharge the length of the exposed cable. Very impressive. Three-foot sparks crackling all over, and [MASK] grinning, and all his hair standing up on end.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Lump	It’s as simple as that, and I don't really think you fully comprehend that.” "I do,” [MASK] said. "I hope you can be happy in someplace like that. Because that’s what most of the universe is composed of.
