<name>Out</name>	Out	Cutlasses	"Out, lads, out, and fight 'em in the open! [MASK]!" cried the captain. I snatched a cutlass from the pile, and someone, at the same time snatching another, gave me a cut across the knuckles which I hardly felt.
<name>Udolpho</name>	Udolpho	Silver	[MASK] was roundly accused of playing double--of trying to make a separate peace for himself, of sacrificing the interests of his accomplices and victims, and, in one word, of the identical, exact thing that he was doing.
<name>Israel</name>	Israel	George	Very pretty wrote, to be sure; like print, I swear. Your hand o' write, [MASK]? Why, you was gettin' quite a leadin' man in this here crew. You'll be cap'n next, I shouldn't wonder.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	And talking o' trouble, why did that doctor give me the chart, [MASK]?" My face expressed a wonder so unaffected that he saw the needlessness of further questions. "Ah, well, he did, though," said he.
<name>Godfrey</name>	Godfrey	Dogger	This time, as the distance was short, I did not mount, but ran with [MASK]'s stirrup-leather to the lodge gates and up the long, leafless, moonlit avenue to where the white line of the hall buildings looked on either hand on great old gardens.
<name>Anderson</name>	Anderson	Silver	[MASK] was a changed man once he was out there and had his back to his friends and the block house; his cheeks seemed to have fallen in, his voice trembled; never was a soul more dead in earnest.
<name>Flint</name>	Flint	Flint	Bout ship, mates! This here crew is on a wrong tack, I do believe. And come to think on it, it was like [MASK]'s voice, I grant you, but not just so clear-away like it, after all.
<name>Hands</name>	Hands	Hands	With these I came on deck, put down my own stock behind the rudder head and well out of the coxswain's reach, went forward to the water-breaker, and had a good deep drink of water, and then, and not till then, gave [MASK] the brandy.
<name>Silver</name>	Silver	Silver	It was as plain as day. [MASK] was the captain, and a mighty rebellious crew he had of it. The honest hands--and I was soon to see it proved that there were such on board--must have been very stupid fellows.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	John	"Well, that's so," he said. "You've a head upon your shoulders, [MASK], and no mistake. 'Bout ship, mates! This here crew is on a wrong tack, I do believe.
<name>Jerry</name>	Jerry	Pew	At this [MASK] saw his error, turned with a scream, and ran straight for the ditch, into which he rolled. But he was on his feet again in a second and made another dash, now utterly bewildered, right under the nearest of the coming horses.
<name>Lighthouse</name>	Lighthouse	Lillibullero	and we made for shore again as fast as oars could take us. This second trip fairly aroused the watchers along shore. "[MASK]" was dropped again; and just before we lost sight of them behind the little point, one of them whipped ashore and disappeared.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	John	But now [MASK] put his hand into his pocket, brought out a whistle, and blew upon it several modulated blasts that rang far across the heated air. I could not tell, of course, the meaning of the signal, but it instantly awoke my fears.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	This sudden noise startled us shockingly; but the news was good, for it was only six. "Now, [MASK]," she said, "that key." I felt in his pockets, one after another.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	"You won't forget?" he inquired anxiously. "Precious sight, and reasons of his own, says you. Reasons of his own; that's the mainstay; as between man and man. Well, then"--still holding me--"I reckon you can go, [MASK].
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	"[MASK]," he whispered, "take that, and stand by for trouble." And he passed me a double-barrelled pistol. At the same time, he began quietly moving northward, and in a few steps had put the hollow between us two and the other five.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	"And there's something under that, no doubt--something, surely, under that, [MASK]--bad or good." And he took another swallow of the brandy, shaking his great fair head like a man who looks forward to the worst. 29
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	"Will you taste, messmate?" he asked; and when I had refused: "Well, I'll take a drain myself, [MASK]," said he. "I need a caulker, for there's trouble on hand.
<name>Gray</name>	Gray	Gray	But this was not so easily answered. There had come many from the north--seven by the squire's computation, eight or nine according to [MASK]. From the east and west only a single shot had been fired.
<name>Long John</name>	Long John	Silver	If it had been [MASK] and his lads that were now creeping in on them, not a soul would have seen daybreak. That was what it was, thought I, to have the captain wounded; and again I blamed myself sharply for leaving them in that danger with so few to mount guard.
<name>Israel</name>	Israel	Israel	This was all that I required to know. [MASK] could move about, he was now armed, and if he had been at so much trouble to get rid of me, it was plain that I was meant to be the victim.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	In a jiffy I had slipped over the side and curled up in the fore-sheets of the nearest boat, and almost at the same moment she shoved off. No one took notice of me, only the bow oar saying, "Is that you, [MASK]?
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Hawkins	Now, I'll tell you, [MASK], if you like, I'll take you along." I thanked him heartily for the offer, and we walked back to the hamlet where the horses were. By the time I had told mother of my purpose they were all in the saddle.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	George	"You always was brisk for business, and has the rules by heart, [MASK], as I'm pleased to see. Well, what is it, anyway? Ah! 'Deposed'--that's it, is it? Very pretty wrote, to be sure; like print, I swear.
<name>Morgan</name>	Morgan	Morgan	You're a pretty colour, certainly; why, your liver, man, is upside down. Did you take that medicine? Did he take that medicine, men?" "Aye, aye, sir, he took it, sure enough," returned [MASK].
<name>Flint</name>	Flint	John	o' mine swearing blue fire, and none the wiser, you may lay to that. She would swear the same, in a manner of speaking, before chaplain." And [MASK] would touch his forelock with a solemn way he had that made me think he was the best of men.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	"Why, now, who's to hinder you?" "Not you, I know," was my reply. "And right you was," he cried. "Now you--what do you call yourself, mate?" "[MASK]," I told him.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	Then he passed his hand over his eyes several times and at last turned back into the house. "[MASK]," says he, "rum"; and as he spoke, he reeled a little, and caught himself with one hand against the wall.
<name>Anderson</name>	Anderson	Anderson	cried the captain; and even in the hurly-burly, I perceived a change in his voice. Mechanically, I obeyed, turned eastwards, and with my cutlass raised, ran round the corner of the house. Next moment I was face to face with [MASK].
<name>Israel</name>	Israel	Silver	[MASK]'s face was a picture; his eyes started in his head with wrath. He shook the fire out of his pipe. "Give me a hand up!" he cried. "Not I," returned the captain.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Silver	Wot did I say? No good'll come o' that, I said." "Well, you've about fixed it now, among you," continued [MASK]. "You'll all swing now, I reckon. What soft-headed lubber had a Bible?"
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Dirk	"[MASK] was a fool and a coward from the first--you wouldn't mind him. They must be close by; they can't be far; you have your hands on it. Scatter and look for them, dogs!
<name>Silver</name>	Silver	Silver	Then he hailed the buccaneer. "Who goes? Stand, or we fire." "Flag of truce," cried [MASK]. The captain was in the porch, keeping himself carefully out of the way of a treacherous shot, should any be intended.
<name>Silver</name>	Silver	Silver	Well, there we stood, two on one side, five on the other, the pit between us, and nobody screwed up high enough to offer the first blow. [MASK] never moved; he watched them, very upright on his crutch, and looked as cool as ever I saw him.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Silver	This was a run of eight or nine miles. [MASK], though he was almost killed already with fatigue, was set to an oar, like the rest of us, and we were soon skimming swiftly over a smooth sea.
<name>Hands</name>	Hands	Hands	One glance, however, was sufficient; and it was only one glance that I durst take from that unsteady skiff. It showed me [MASK] and his companion locked together in deadly wrestle, each with a hand upon the other's throat.
<name>Silver</name>	Silver	Silver	I'll give you a piece of advice," he continued as the cook drew near again; "don't you be in any great hurry after that treasure." "Why, sir, I do my possible, which that ain't," said [MASK].
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Silver	You see, sir, here it is. I get a rough answer, do I not? Well, if I speak back, pikes will be going in two shakes; if I don't, [MASK] will see there's something under that, and the game's up.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	John	You're his last card, and by the living thunder, [MASK], he's yours! Back to back, says I. You save your witness, and he'll save your neck!" I began dimly to understand. "You mean all's lost?
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Pew	Down went [MASK] with a cry that rang high into the night; and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him and passed by. He fell on his side, then gently collapsed upon his face and moved no more. I leaped to my feet and hailed the riders.
<name>Gray</name>	Gray	Gray	Then it had occurred to him to work upon the superstitions of his former shipmates, and he was so far successful that [MASK] and the doctor had come up and were already ambushed before the arrival of the treasure-hunters.
<name>Long</name>	Long	Silver	I readily gave the pledge required. "Then, doctor," said [MASK], "you just step outside o' that stockade, and once you're there I'll bring the boy down on the inside, and I reckon you can yarn through the spars.
<name>Silver</name>	Silver	Silver	We're about sick of him.' These was his words. "Is that all?" I asked. "Well, it's all that you're to hear, my son," returned [MASK]. "And now I am to choose?" "
<name>Flint</name>	Flint	Darby	I could hear his teeth rattle in his head, but he had not yet surrendered. "Nobody in this here island ever heard of [MASK]," he muttered; "not one but us that's here."
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	I'd have had you but for that there lurch, but I don't have no luck, not I; and I reckon I'll have to strike, which comes hard, you see, for a master mariner to a ship's younker like you, [MASK]."
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	O'Brien	"[MASK] there is in another world, and may be watching us." "Ah!" says he. "Well, that's unfort'nate--appears as if killing parties was a waste of time. Howsomever, sperrits don't reckon for much, by what
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	And if them pirates camp ashore, [MASK], what would you say but there'd be widders in the morning?" Here he was interrupted by a loud report, and a cannonball came tearing through the trees and pitched in the sand not a hundred yards from where we two were talking.
<name>Silver</name>	Silver	Silver	"You lost the ship; I found the treasure. Who's the better man at that? And now I resign, by thunder! Elect whom you please to be your cap'n now; I'm done with it." "[MASK]!" they cried. "
<name>Thunder</name>	Thunder	Thunder	"Aye, aye," said he, "that's some better, sure enough. And now, matey, did that doctor say how long I was to lie here in this old berth?" "A week at least," said I. "[MASK]!"
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Silver	Top o' the morning to you, sir!" cried [MASK], broad awake and beaming with good nature in a moment. "Bright and early, to be sure; and it's the early bird, as the saying goes, that gets the rations.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Silver	A gentle slope ran up from the beach to the entrance of the cave. At the top, the squire met us. To me he was cordial and kind, saying nothing of my escapade either in the way of blame or praise. At [MASK]'s polite salute he somewhat flushed.
<name>Flint</name>	Flint	Tom	The squire dropped down beside him on his knees and kissed his hand, crying like a child. "Be I going, doctor?" he asked. "[MASK], my man," said I, "you're going home."
<name>John</name>	John	John	"I'll ask you later on to give us a help. You may go." I was surprised at the coolness with which [MASK] avowed his knowledge of the island, and I own I was half-frightened when I saw him drawing nearer to myself.
<name>Flint</name>	Flint	Silver	The captain looked on for a while in silence. Then he spoke. "My lads," said he, "I've given [MASK] a broadside. I pitched it in red-hot on purpose; and before the hour's out, as he said, we shall be boarded.
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Merry	" cried [MASK]. The song had stopped as suddenly as it began--broken off, you would have said, in the middle of a note, as though someone had laid his hand upon the singer's mouth.
<name>Silver</name>	Silver	Silver	"Leastways, this is good sea-cloth." "Aye, aye," said [MASK]; "like enough; you wouldn't look to find a bishop here, I reckon. But what sort of a way is that for bones to lie?
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Jim	"Look, [MASK], how my fingers fidges," he continued in the pleading tone. "I can't keep 'em still, not I. I haven't had a drop this blessed day. That doctor's a fool, I tell you.
<name>Pew</name>	Pew	Pew	And that was plainly the last signal of danger, for the buccaneers turned at once and ran, separating in every direction, one seaward along the cove, one slant across the hill, and so on, so that in half a minute not a sign of them remained but [MASK].
<name>Swanston</name>	Swanston	Jim	"And good evening to you, friend [MASK]. What good wind brings you here?" The supervisor stood up straight and stiff and told his story like a lesson; and you should have seen how the two gentlemen leaned forward and looked at each other, and forgot to smoke in their surprise and interest.
<name>Silver</name>	Silver	Silver	Another voice answered, and then the first voice, which I now recognized to be [MASK]'s, once more took up the story and ran on for a long while in a stream, only now and again interrupted by the other.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Morgan	Long after the voice had died away they still stared in silence, dreadfully, before them. "That fixes it!" gasped one. "Let's go." "They was his last words," moaned [MASK], "his last words above board."
<name>Handy</name>	Handy	Hands	I think I was a good, prompt subaltern, and I am very sure that [MASK] was an excellent pilot, for we went about and about and dodged in, shaving the banks, with a certainty and a neatness that were a pleasure to behold.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	"And so, [MASK]," said the doctor, "you have the thing that they were after, have you?" "Here it is, sir," said I, and gave him the oilskin packet.
<name>Long</name>	Long	Silver	[MASK] leant back against the wall, his arms crossed, his pipe in the corner of his mouth, as calm as though he had been in church; yet his eye kept wandering furtively, and he kept the tail of it on his unruly followers.
<name>Israel</name>	Israel	Jim	In order to speak he had to take the dagger from his mouth, but in all else he remained unmoved. "[MASK]," says he, "I reckon we're fouled, you and me, and we'll have to sign articles.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Hawkins	"[MASK], I put prodigious faith in you," added the squire. I began to feel pretty desperate at this, for I felt altogether helpless; and yet, by an odd train of circumstances, it was indeed through me that safety came.
<name>Long</name>	Long	George	J. F., and a score below, with a clove hitch to it; so he done ever." "Mighty pretty," said [MASK]. "But how are we to get away with it, and us no ship."
<name>Gray</name>	Gray	Joyce	And just at that moment came the first news of the attack. "If you please, sir," said [MASK], "if I see anyone, am I to fire?" "I told you so!" cried the captain.
<name>Hands</name>	Hands	Hands	My new employment struck [MASK] all of a heap; he began to see the dice going against him, and after an obvious hesitation, he also hauled himself heavily into the shrouds, and with the dirk in his teeth, began slowly and painfully to mount.
<name>Flint</name>	Flint	Flint	That's what he said. "Well, I was in another ship three years back, and we sighted this island. 'Boys,' said I, 'here's [MASK]'s treasure; let's land and find it.'
<name>Wolf</name>	Wolf	Silver	He whipped out of sight in a moment, leaving [MASK] to arrange the party, and I fancy it was as well he did so. Had he been on deck, he could no longer so much as have pretended not to understand the situation.
<name>John</name>	John	Hawkins	The stern window was open, for it was a warm night, and you could see the moon shining behind on the ship's wake. "Now, [MASK]," said the squire, "you have something to say. Speak up."
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	Never a month but I've given you a silver fourpenny for yourself. And now you see, mate, I'm pretty low, and deserted by all; and [MASK], you'll bring me one noggin of rum, now, won't you, matey?"
<name>Flint</name>	Flint	Flint	"Speaking of knives," said another, "why don't we find his'n lying round? [MASK] warn't the man to pick a seaman's pocket; and the birds, I guess, would leave it be." "By the powers, and that's true!"
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	For my part, I must do my best to save this fellow's trebly worthless life; [MASK], you get me a basin." When I got back with the basin, the doctor had already ripped up the captain's sleeve and exposed his great sinewy arm.
<name>Long</name>	Long	George	After that, we'll see." "Oh," replied [MASK], "you don't be under no kind of apprehension; WE'RE all square, we are. First, you've made a hash of this cruise--you'll be a bold man to say no to that.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Bill	The expression of his face was not so much of terror as of mortal sickness. He made a movement to rise, but I do not believe he had enough force left in his body. "Now, [MASK], sit where you are," said the beggar.
<name>Flint</name>	Flint	Flint	"But you are so confoundedly hot-headed and exclamatory that I cannot get a word in. What I want to know is this: Supposing that I have here in my pocket some clue to where [MASK] buried his treasure, will that treasure amount to much?"
<name>Long</name>	Long	Joyce	Not a bough waved, not the gleam of a musket-barrel betrayed the presence of our foes. "Did you hit your man?" asked the captain. "No, sir," replied [MASK]. "I believe not, sir."
<name>Lillibullero</name>	Lillibullero	Lillibullero	The six scoundrels were sitting grumbling under a sail in the forecastle; ashore we could see the gigs made fast and a man sitting in each, hard by where the river runs in. One of them was whistling "[MASK]."
<name>Flint</name>	Flint	Silver	"No," I replied; "you know right well you wouldn't do the thing yourself--neither you nor squire nor captain; and no more will I. [MASK] trusted me; I passed my word, and back I go.
<name>Silver</name>	Silver	Silver	But this crew," he added, "beats me." "Captain," said the doctor, "with your permission, that's [MASK]. A very remarkable man." "He'd look remarkably well from a yard-arm, sir," returned the captain.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	I now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude, and I suppose I must have shown the feeling in my face, for he repeated the statement hotly: "Rich! Rich! I says. And I'll tell you what: I'll make a man of you, [MASK].
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	This was the first that [MASK] heard, the sound of the squire's shot not having reached him. Where the ball passed, not one of us precisely knew, but I fancy it must have been over our heads and that the wind of it may have contributed to our disaster.
<name>Silver</name>	Silver	Silver	It is one thing to be idle and skulk and quite another to take a ship and murder a number of innocent men. At last, however, the party was made up. Six fellows were to stay on board, and the remaining thirteen, including [MASK], began to embark.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Dick	I'll wring his calf's head off his body with these hands, [MASK]!" he added, breaking off. "You just jump up, like a sweet lad, and get me an apple, to wet my pipe like."
<name>Silver</name>	Silver	Gray	"Why no," says I. "He's about the last of this crew for that, I take it." "Well, shipmate," said [MASK], "mad he may not be; but if HE'S not, you mark my words, I am.
<name>Barbecue</name>	Barbecue	Barbecue	And this the more surprised me, for I thought he had never shown himself so cunning as he did then. "Aye, mates," said he, "it's lucky you have [MASK] to think for you with this here head.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Billy	'Dead men don't bite,' says he. Well, he's dead now hisself; he knows the long and short on it now; and if ever a rough hand come to port, it was [MASK]."
<name>Alan</name>	Alan	Silver	One thing I observed, which looked well for us: they all got out upon the opposite side from [MASK]. Well, there we stood, two on one side, five on the other, the pit between us, and nobody screwed up high enough to offer the first blow.
<name>Silver</name>	Silver	Silver	Now, we've only one man to rely on." "And who is that?" asked the squire. "[MASK], sir," returned the captain; "he's as anxious as you and I to smother things up.
<name>Gray</name>	Gray	Gray	The doctor and [MASK] and I ran full speed for shelter. The survivors would soon be back where they had left their muskets, and at any moment the fire might recommence. The house was by this time somewhat cleared of smoke, and we saw at a glance the price we had paid for victory.
<name>Dick</name>	Dick	Dick	and the gallows." The rogues looked at each other but swallowed the home-thrust in silence. "[MASK] don't feel well, sir," said one. "Don't he?" replied the doctor.
<name>Flint</name>	Flint	Hawkins	"Now, that bird," he would say, "is, maybe, two hundred years old, [MASK]--they live forever mostly; and if anybody's seen more wickedness, it must be the devil himself.
<name>Little</name>	Little	Little	I turned hither and thither among the trees. Here and there were flowering plants, unknown to me; here and there I saw snakes, and one raised his head from a ledge of rock and hissed at me with a noise not unlike the spinning of a top. [MASK] did
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Silver	"They liked a bit o' fun, they did. They wasn't so high and dry, nohow, but took their fling, like jolly companions every one." "So?" says [MASK]. "Well, and where are they now?
<name>Israel</name>	Israel	Silver	And there was [MASK], sitting back almost out of the firelight, but eating heartily, prompt to spring forward when anything was wanted, even joining quietly in our laughter--the same bland, polite, obsequious seaman of the voyage out. 34
<name>Noah</name>	Noah	Noah	Every man on board seemed well content, and they must have been hard to please if they had been otherwise, for it is my belief there was never a ship's company so spoiled since [MASK] put to sea.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Bill	he shouted, and cursed them for their delay. Four or five of them obeyed at once, two remaining on the road with the formidable beggar. There was a pause, then a cry of surprise, and then a voice shouting from the house, "[MASK]'s dead."
<name>Long John</name>	Long John	John	And with that, this brave fellow turned his back directly on the cook and set off walking for the beach. But he was not destined to go far. With a cry [MASK] seized the branch of a tree, whipped the crutch out of his armpit, and sent that uncouth missile hurtling through the air.
