<name>Hardin</name>	Hardin	Hardin	In response to the signal, he stepped on the pedal beneath his desk, and the door slid aside. They filed in, the four that composed the deputation, and [MASK] waved them gently to the armchairs that faced his desk in a semicircle.
<name>Travers</name>	Travers	Hardin	They’re going to find that out soon, and if you think they’re going to enjoy being jollied along, you’re mistaken.’ ‘My dear sir—’ ‘Hold on: I’m not finished.’ [MASK] was warming up. He liked this.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Lee	He appeared at noon last time.’ ‘What if he doesn’t?’ ‘Are you going to wear me down with your worries all your life? If he doesn’t, he won’t.’ [MASK] frowned and shook his head slowly.
<name>Hardin</name>	Hardin	Wienis	‘Yes, the cruiser I myself ordered repaired - but in my own way. Tell me, [MASK], have you ever heard of an ultrawave relay? No, I see you haven’t. Well, in about two minutes you’ll find out what one can do.’
<name>Ward</name>	Ward	Mallow	[MASK]’s face grew livid. ‘A missionary, sir. He’s in need of hospitalization, sir—’ ‘There’ll be more than one in need of that, sergeant, for this piece of work. Order the men to battle stations.’
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Mallow	‘You mean conquest by missionary?’ ‘Exactly.’ ‘No compromise short of that?’ ‘None.’ ‘Um-m-m.’ [MASK] lit up very slowly, and inhaled the tip of his cigar into a bright glow.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Pirenne	If it comes to what it comes, and you co-operate, we could probably arrange it so that you lose nothing. Titles can be conferred and estates granted. You understand me, I think.’ [MASK] sneered, ‘Thanks!’
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Hardin	‘Your taste in epigrams is amusing, [MASK], but out of place. As a matter of fact, I think you remember my line of argument concerning the Vault about three weeks ago.’ ‘Yes, I remember it.
<name>Rearden</name>	Rearden	Mallow	[MASK] said, ‘Did you hear him?’ The politician flopped to the floor. ‘I never heard him as angry as that, since I’ve known the snake.’ ‘All right. What do you make of it?’
<name>Hardin</name>	Hardin	Wienis	That can’t be helped, your highness.’ [MASK]’ smile broadened. ‘The Galactic Spirit, to use the popular cant, helps those who help themselves. I quite understand that, left to itself, the Foundation would never co-operate.’
<name>Hardin</name>	Hardin	Jael	And one false move means that it, itself, may be on our neck. That’s why I must be mayor and high priest. I’m the only man who knows how to fight the crisis.’ [MASK] swallowed dryly, ‘How?
<name>Jorgen</name>	Jorgen	Gaal	An officer came through and said, ‘View-room will be closed for the remainder of the trip. Prepare for landing.’ [MASK] had followed after, clutching at the sleeve of the white uniform with the Spaceship-and-Sun of the Empire on it.
<name>Lucien</name>	Lucien	Mallow	The less you speak, the less suspicion you will draw upon yourself. Now I’ll tell you how to get to the city—’ Five minutes later, [MASK] was gone. He returned but once, for a moment, to the old patrician’s house, before leaving it entirely, however.
<name>Prendick</name>	Prendick	Bort	What’s he doing there? Is he blind, too?’ ‘I don’t know,’ said [MASK], curtly. ‘He’s high priest to them. As far as I know, he does nothing but act as adviser to the priesthood on technical details.
<name>Hober</name>	Hober	Mallow	‘It will become so,’ said [MASK]. ‘Consider that until now the power of trade has been underestimated. It has been thought that it took a priesthood under our control to make it a powerful weapon. That is not so, and this is my contribution to the Galactic situation.
<name>Wentworth</name>	Wentworth	Mallow	It was a sort of mutual agreement. He was one of us, you might say, and these foreigners here—’ [MASK] cut him short, ‘I sympathize with your feelings, sergeant, and understand them. These men, were they under your command?’
<name>Trevize</name>	Trevize	Lepold	sort of blasphemous, you know, to attack the Foundation. I mean—’ He paused. ‘Go on.’ [MASK] said confusedly, ‘I mean, if there were really a Galactic Spirit, he ... uh . .. it mightn’t like it.
<name>Hardin</name>	Hardin	Wienis	Our yielding will be taken as a sign of appalling weakness and the addition of the Imperial Cruiser will just about double the strength of [MASK]’ navy. He’ll attack as sure as I’m a high priest. Why take chances? Do one of two things.
<name>Slade</name>	Slade	Twer	I was at sea - and completely. ‘There was one thing I could do. I got rid of [MASK] for five minutes by sending him after my officers. In his absence, I set up a Visual Record receiver, so that whatever happened might be preserved for future study.
<name>Shekt</name>	Shekt	Gorov	Item three, we’ve worked together before and the Board knows it. Isn’t that a sweet, inevitable set-up? The answer just pops out of a slot.’ ‘Be careful,’ said [MASK], tautly. ‘There’ll be someone listening.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Twer	He seemed at no time to be in complete possession of his wits.’ ‘Hard usage—’ murmured [MASK] bitterly. ‘Maybe! And maybe the idea was to have us go all chivalrous and gallant, into a stupid defense of the man.
<name>Mayor</name>	Mayor	Pirenne	Anything of importance will be communicated to the people. That is final and please make it plain to the Journal.’ ‘I’m sorry, [MASK], but the City Charter guarantees a certain minor matter known as freedom of the press.’ ‘It may.
<name>Alfred</name>	Alfred	Gaal	It glowed faintly. The Supervisor said, ‘One point twelve.’ [MASK] fumbled for the coins. He said, ‘Where do I go?’ ‘Follow the light. The ticket will keep glowing as long as you’re pointed in the right direction.’
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Sermak	Your attack on the foreign policy of this government was a most capable one.’ [MASK]’s eyes smoldered. ‘Your interest honors me. The attack may or may not have been capable, but it was certainly justified.’ ‘Perhaps!
<name>Hardin</name>	Hardin	Hardin	But that does not mean that the first and only aim of the Foundation is no longer to publish the definitive Encyclopedia of all human knowledge. We are a State-supported, scientific institution, [MASK]. We cannot - must not - will not interfere in local politics.’
<name>Hari Seldon</name>	Hari Seldon	Seldon	At the age of two, he is said to have . . . . . . Undoubtedly his greatest contributions were in the field of psychohistory. [MASK] found the field little more than a set of vague axioms; he left it a profound statistical science .. .
<name>Grigori</name>	Grigori	Pherl	His Veneration is aging and his protection will not last past his death, when it is an enemy of yours who will undoubtedly be the one to interpret the words of his Spirit.’ [MASK] scowled, ‘For a foreigner you hear much.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Mallow	Now there was a disturbed whispering in the council. [MASK] cleared his throat theatrically, and continued: ‘I hate to describe my feelings when I first heard that we had a refugee missionary on board. I even hate to remember them. Essentially, they consisted of wild uncertainty.
<name>Alvar</name>	Alvar	Mallow	[MASK] breathed deeply, ‘As a spy?’ ‘Not at all. As a trader - but with your eyes open. If you can find out where the power is coming from - I might remind you, since you’re a Smyrnian, that two of those lost trade ships had Smyrnian crews.’
<name>Kim</name>	Kim	Sermak	He fills the temple with a pearly, internal light at a gesture. There is no end to these quite simple tricks that we perform for his benefit; but even the priests believe them, while working them personally.’ ‘Bad!’ said [MASK], biting his lip.
<name>Mask</name>	Mask	Seldon	He had sprung his trap; backed [MASK] into a corner; driven him astutely from any possibility of answering. There was a rising buzz of conversation at that which swept the ranks of the peers in the audience and invaded even the row of Commissioners.
<name>Trantor</name>	Trantor	Terminus	You and I both know that the armament he now has could defeat [MASK] handily, long before we could repair the cruiser for our own use. What does it matter, then, if we give him the cruiser as well? You know it won’t ever come to actual war.’
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Barr	‘There is quite enough that money won’t buy. And now if you’ll tell me the nearest city with one of the stations, and how best to get there, I’ll thank you.’ ‘Wait!’ [MASK] held out his thin hands.
<name>Anacreon</name>	Anacreon	Smyrno	‘You see, you’re beginning to understand. And now, my boy, what if [MASK] decides to attack the Foundation for its own part and thus gains all that power? How long do you suppose we could escape becoming a vassal power?
<name>Emile</name>	Emile	Jerril	‘You were talking to a man on the observation tower, were you not?’ ‘Yes. His first name is [MASK]. I know no more about him.’ ‘His name is nothing. He is an agent of the Commission of Public Safety.
<name>Straker</name>	Straker	Sutt	Your report was incomplete.’ ‘I gave it to you months ago. You were satisfied then.’ ‘Yes,’ [MASK] rubbed his forehead thoughtfully with one finger, ‘but since then your activities have been significant.
<name>He</name>	He	Wienis	‘I don’t know.’ 7 do. And that threat always stood.’ ‘And still stands now?’ ‘Now it is rather too late to speak of threats.’ [MASK] had cast a rapid glance at the clock on his desk.
<name>Napoleon</name>	Napoleon	Hardin	To cut our own throats so thoroughly and so hopelessly would require colossal stupidity. More than [MASK] could possibly have even if he were a fool, which I deny. One the one hand, to establish a religion that would wipe out all chance of internal troubles.
<name>Hober</name>	Hober	Mallow	[MASK] nodded, ‘Of course. They’ll declare war, eventually, though I’m betting it’ll take another pair of years.’ ‘With atomic ships?’ ‘What do you think? Those three merchant ships we lost in their space sector weren’t knocked over with compressed-air pistols.
<name>He</name>	He	Wienis	We decided to wait - to wipe out the insult at a fitter time. It had been your father’s hope, before his untimely death, that he might be the one to - Well, well!’ [MASK] turned away for a moment.
<name>Hardin</name>	Hardin	Hardin	‘The difficulty, [MASK], of persuading the Foundation to co-operate. Your policy of peace, you see, has led you into making several very serious mistakes, simply because you underestimated the boldness of your adversary. Not everyone is as afraid of direct action as you are.’
<name>Alaric</name>	Alaric	Mallow	While [MASK]’s look of patience never changed, the atomic forces that tore at him consumed themselves against that fragile, pearly illumination, and crashed back to die in mid-air. The tech-man’s blaster dropped to the floor with an unnoticed crash.
<name>Snufkin</name>	Snufkin	Commdor	‘The only catch, [MASK], is that you’re going to be burdened with an immense quantity of riches.’ ‘Indeed?’ he snuffled. ‘But what could I want with riches? The true wealth is the love of one’s people.
<name>Arsène</name>	Arsène	Ponyets	The show you offered us and the antagonism you aroused would have been dispensed with.’ ‘True,’ [MASK] admitted, ‘but since I was myself, I accepted the antagonism for the sake of attracting your attention.’ ‘Is that it?
<name>Tanner</name>	Tanner	Gorov	‘But you’ve damaged his ego,’ said [MASK]. ‘Will he use the gadgets?’ ‘Why not? It’s his only way of recouping his losses, and if he makes money out of it, he’ll salve his pride.
<name>Septimus</name>	Septimus	Seldon	They received, rather, a conversation constructed at random out of a vast stock of innocuous phrases in various tones and voices. ‘Now,’ said [MASK], at his ease, ‘six months will be enough.’ ‘I don’t see how.’
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Twer	Never mind the in-betweens.’ ‘You’ve got to have the in-betweens, or you won’t understand, [MASK]. We’re both waiting. They don’t know what I’m doing here and I don’t know what they’ve got here.
<name>Hardin</name>	Hardin	Hardin	[MASK] answered, half in reverie: ‘Yes, I never completed my studies, though. I got tired of theory. I wanted to be a psychological engineer, but we lacked the facilities, so I did the next best thing - I went into politics.
<name>Alveron</name>	Alveron	Hardin	‘And that means it was humanity’s birth planet?’ ‘P’haps. I must wead it closely and wigh the evidence befoah I can say foah cuhtain. One must see just how weliable his obsuhvations ah.’ [MASK] remained silent for a short while.
<name>Stranger</name>	Stranger	Pherl	Such ears are made for cropping.’ ‘That may be decided later.’ ‘Let me anticipate.’ [MASK] stirred impatiently in his seat. ‘You’re going to offer me wealth and power in terms of those evil little machines you carry in your ship.
<name>Obviously</name>	Obviously	Jael	‘With atomic ships?’ ‘What do you think? Those three merchant ships we lost in their space sector weren’t knocked over with compressed-air pistols. [MASK], they’re getting ships from the Empire itself. Don’t open your mouth like a fool.
<name>Alvar</name>	Alvar	Ponyets	All right. I sold that transmuter for nothing. Nothing except the risk of the gas chamber and that doesn’t count towards the quota.’ ‘Get back to the mining estates, [MASK]. Where do they come in?’ ‘With the profits.
<name>Arkady</name>	Arkady	Twer	And it would be pretty hard to mask all signs of the widespread effects a fundamental technology such as atomics would have on everything.’ ‘Not if it was just starting up, [MASK], and being applied to a war economy.
<name>Hari</name>	Hari	Mallow	The tech-man’s lips pursed peevishly, ‘Now, my man, quickly. I have things of great importance waiting for me. You seem a stranger—’ He seemed to evaluate [MASK]’s definitely un-Siwennese costume and his eyelids were heavy with suspicion.
<name>Hardin</name>	Hardin	Seldon	‘As I have said, somewhat secluded. It will suit your needs for concentration. Come, you have two minutes left.’ [MASK] said, ‘We will need time to arrange such a trip. There are twenty thousand families involved.’
<name>Steerforth</name>	Steerforth	Hardin	Let them blow everything up. You’ll rot! I’ll get you! ‘Soldiers!’ he thundered, hysterically. ‘Shoot me down that devil. Blast him! Blast him!’ [MASK] turned about in his chair to face the soldiers and smiled.
<name>Hardin</name>	Hardin	Twer	There’s no way of maintaining decency and honor otherwise. He’s of the Foundation and, after all, he - is a priest. These savages outside— Do you hear me?’ ‘I hear you, [MASK].’
<name>Donatello</name>	Donatello	Wienis	that such war will never in the future ... be resumed, and that’ - here a long pause, and then continuing - ‘and that the one-time prince regent, [MASK] ... be imprisoned . . . and tried before an ecclesiastical court ... for his crimes.
<name>Milo</name>	Milo	Gaal	The scene contracted further and began to slide backward. There was a wall ahead. It began high in the air and extended upward out of sight. It was riddled with holes that were the mouths of tunnels. [MASK]’s taxi moved toward one then plunged into it.
<name>Hardin</name>	Hardin	Mallow	You can’t maintain discipline that way.’ [MASK] said icily, ‘/ can. There’s no merit in discipline under ideal circumstances. I’ll have it in the face of death, or it’s useless. Where’s this missionary?
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Twer	There’s a guard around the field and there are ships overhead. Suppose they’re getting ready to blow us into a hole in the ground.’ ‘They’ve had a week.’ ‘Maybe they’re waiting for reinforcements.’ [MASK]’s eyes were sharp and hard.
<name>Kim</name>	Kim	Walto	He’s an absolute monarch by divine right, and the people believe it, thoroughly, and the priests, too. You can’t overthrow a king like that. Now do you get the point?’ ‘Hold on,’ said [MASK], at this point.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Ponyets	[MASK] heard the staccato rattle of the receiver quite plainly. Dripping suds and a curse, he stepped out to adjust the vocal, and three hours later a second trade ship was alongside, and a grinning youngster entered through the air tube between the ships.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Gaal	[MASK]’s funds were low, but there was only this one night and then he would have a job. He tried to sound nonchalant, ‘A good hotel, please.’ The Supervisor was unimpressed, ‘They’re all good. Name One.’
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Mallow	There was a queer glint in the older man’s eyes, ‘All right. I’ll go.’ He held out his hand, ‘It’ll be my first trip in three years.’ [MASK] grasped and shook the other’s hand, ‘Good!
<name>He</name>	He	Verisof	But, conversely, as long as more than one course of action is possible, the crisis has not been reached. We must let things drift so long as we possibly can, and by space, that’s what I intend doing.’ [MASK] didn’t answer.
<name>Sheffield</name>	Sheffield	Pirenne	He caught it and flipped it again, watching the flashing reflections lazily. Stainless steel made good medium of exchange on a planet where all metal had to be imported. [MASK] looked up and blinked. ‘Stop that!’ he said querulously. ‘Eh?’
<name>Heyst</name>	Heyst	Sutt	I even hate to remember them. Essentially, they consisted of wild uncertainty. The event struck me at the moment as a move by [MASK], and passed beyond my comprehension or calculation. I was at sea - and completely. ‘There was one thing I could do.
<name>Wobert</name>	Wobert	Lameth	I leave?’ ‘Only too pleased.’ ‘[MASK], you must know,’ continued the chancellor, pontifically, ‘pwesents a new and most intwesting addition to my pwevious knowledge of the “Owigin Question.” ’
<name>Arkady</name>	Arkady	Lepold	We were forced to abandon that base as a result of the machinations of the leader of that Foundation, a sly cur, a scholar, with not a drop of noble blood in his veins. You understand, [MASK]? Your grandfather was humiliated by this commoner.
<name>Poirot</name>	Poirot	Pirenne	But [MASK] had been seen in this wing and on this floor. It was simply a matter of trying every door. Half-way down, he said, ‘Ah!’ and stepped into the darkened room.
<name>Hardin</name>	Hardin	Hardin	What do we need with those? We’ve got hefty surpluses. Gold, of course. Chromium or vanadium would be even better, incidentally, if you have it in quantity.’ [MASK] laughed. ‘Quantity! We haven’t even got iron in quantity.
<name>Zarniwoop</name>	Zarniwoop	Ponyets	‘This,’ said [MASK], stepping back, ‘is a small device I have constructed myself.’ ‘That is obvious, but it is not the information I want. Is it one of the black-magic abominations of your world?’
<name>Trevize</name>	Trevize	Avakim	A guard entered, walked to the table, picked up the recorder, looked upon all sides of it and put in his pocket. [MASK] said quietly, ‘I will need that instrument.’ ‘We will supply you with one, Counsellor, that does not cast a static field.’
<name>Drakov</name>	Drakov	Wienis	The report was made in the expressionless tones of an officer, but his eyes shifted uneasily. [MASK] cried, ‘If any of the rabble attempt to pass the palace gates, blast them out of existence. For the moment, nothing more. Let them howl!
<name>Hardin</name>	Hardin	Sermak	What price our value to the kingdoms, then?’ ‘Little chance of that, [MASK]. You are being superficial. The best men on the planets of the kingdoms are sent here to the Foundation each year and educated into the priesthood.
<name>Trevize</name>	Trevize	Twer	His arms went out in an embracing gesture. ‘My son - my children. May you always be in the protecting arms of the Galactic Spirit.’ [MASK] stepped forward, eyes troubled, voice husky, ‘The man’s sick. Take him to bed, somebody.
<name>Thufir</name>	Thufir	Avakim	I’m innocent of anything. Of anything.' He slashed his hands outward, palms down, ‘You’ve got to arrange a hearing with the Emperor, instantly.’ [MASK] was carefully emptying the contents of a flat folder onto the floor.
<name>Hitler</name>	Hitler	Chen	‘Because, my boy, in a plan such as ours, the actions of others are bent to our needs. Have I not said to you already that [MASK]’s temperamental makeup has been subjected to greater scrutiny than that of any other single man in history.
<name>Hardin</name>	Hardin	Mallow	All of that!’ But [MASK]’s answer was incisive, ‘When I’m boss of this Foundation, I’m going to do nothing. One hundred percent of nothing, and that is the secret of this crisis.’
<name>Seldon</name>	Seldon	Seldon	There are no trained psychologists on Terminus and no mathematical texts on the science. It is plain that he wanted no one on Terminus capable of working out the future in advance. [MASK] wanted us to proceed blindly - and therefore correctly - according to the law of mob psychology.
<name>Psmith</name>	Psmith	Hardin	[MASK] threw himself back in the chair. ‘You know, that’s the most interesting part of the whole business. I’ll admit I had thought his Lordship a most consummate donkey when I first met him - but it turned out that he was actually an accomplished diplomat and a most clever man.
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Twer	[MASK] said, ‘My motives were good. It’s difficult to send a man out to be lynched. That wobbly-kneed governor or whatever-he-was can’t save him. It’s murder.’ ‘I can’t help that.
<name>Hardin</name>	Hardin	Gorov	‘It’s simple enough,’ said [MASK]. ‘The only way we can increase the security of the Foundation here in the Periphery is to form a religion-controlled commercial empire. We’re still too weak to be able to force political control.
<name>Archer</name>	Archer	Dryly	Your opinions are yours, of course. Still you are rather young.’ [MASK]. ‘It is a fault that most people are guilty of at some period of their life. You became mayor of the city when you were two years younger than I am now.’
<name>Powell</name>	Powell	Gaal	‘Sure! Sell you a ticket for that, if you want. Better let me check if it’s raining or not.’ He closed a contact at his elbow and read the flowing letters that raced across a frosted screen. [MASK] read with him.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Hardin	‘Queer name! Anyway, that’s for tomorrow. We might as well clear away some of the underbrush, man to man, right now, though. Hey?’ ‘And this means—’ prodded [MASK]. ‘Just this.
<name>Black</name>	Black	Lefkin	[MASK] looked about wildly. ‘Seize that man. Arrest him, or by Space, I will send every man within reach of my voice out the air lock in the nude.’ He paused, and then shrieked, ‘It is your admiral that orders.
<name>Insulin</name>	Insulin	Insulin	The young councilman regarded his cigar stub thoughtfully and tossed it into the incinerator chute. ‘I fail to see the analogy. [MASK] will bring a diabetic to normal without the faintest need of a knife, but appendicitis needs an operation. You can’t help that.
<name>Mexican</name>	Mexican	Smyrnian	I don’t claim to be able to outsmart him. And don’t think he doesn’t fight hard, and dirty.’ ‘I’ve got money.’ ‘That helps. But it takes a lot to buy off prejudice, - you dirty [MASK].’
<name>Hober</name>	Hober	Ponyets	[MASK] said, ‘You mean that this is a matter of patriotism and traders aren’t patriotic?’ ‘Notoriously not. Pioneers never are.’ ‘All right. I’ll grant that. I don’t scoot about space to save the Foundation or anything like that.
<name>Windrip</name>	Windrip	Sermak	I tell you this [MASK] has a following. What if he doesn’t wait till the next election? There was a time when you and I put things through violently, in spite of your slogan about what violence is.’
<name>Travers</name>	Travers	Mallow	You can’t seriously consider running for mayor. Mob enthusiasm is a powerful thing, but it’s notoriously fickle.’ ‘Exactly!’ said [MASK], grimly, ‘so we must coddle it, and the best way to do that is to continue the show.’
<name>McKee</name>	McKee	Hardin	‘Well, of course, there would be the matter of supporting the protecting forces.’ [MASK]’s chair came down on all four, and his elbows went forward on his knees. ‘Now we’re getting to the nub. Let’s put it into language.
<name>Trurl</name>	Trurl	Wienis	‘It seems,’ suggested the king, timidly, ‘that we ought to be grateful—’ ‘Grateful?’ roared [MASK]. ‘Grateful that they begrudge us the merest dregs, while keeping space knows what for themselves - and keeping it with what purpose in mind?
<name>Roderick</name>	Roderick	Lepold	They had been more or less running their own affairs since the Zeonian revolt, but even after communications broke down and [MASK]’s pirate of a grandfather made himself king, they never quite realized the Empire had gone kaput.
<name>Slartibartfast</name>	Slartibartfast	Hardin	’ ‘Which question?’ asked [MASK]. ‘The “Owigin Question.” The place of the owigin of the human species, y’know. Suahly you must know that it is thought that owiginally the human wace occupied only one planetawy system.’
<name>Moriarty</name>	Moriarty	Chen	[MASK] said, ‘These are words to frighten children, and yet your death is not the only answer which will satisfy us.’ He lifted his slender hand from the papers on which it rested, so that only two fingers touched lightly upon the topmost sheet.
<name>Earth</name>	Earth	Anacreon	‘—but we believe that it would be best for all concerned to have [MASK] establish a military base upon the planet.’ ‘And that is all you would want - a military base in some of the vast unoccupied territory - and let it go at that?’
<name>Leto</name>	Leto	Gorov	That smells of atomics to me.’ [MASK] shrugged. ‘Those ships are holdovers of the Empire, no doubt. Probably with atomic drive. What they have, they keep. The point is that they will not innovate and their internal economy is entirely nonatomic.
