<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jack	Or not think about, just let the idea come. These men advocated faith and trust, but not believing. Every once in a while, as they spoke, [MASK] felt he really understood that there was a genius to that. “Drink up, boy.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Walter	“None of that,” [MASK] replied. “The key to the city is something that if it was smaller you would wear, like a white rose or a red rose on Mother’s Day or a boy scout pin. Except those things are more true than what the key means.
<name>Andre</name>	Andre	Walter	Not that she don’t make you work for it. But she be working too, you know. It’s like, very much together, something you doing. I think that’s a form of love,” [MASK] said.
<name>She</name>	She	Joan	Other animals saw better in darkness. Then, they took over the land and the water. [MASK] only heard them outside and from their weight, she guessed they ran in packs or danced in couples, that her only recourse was to scatter if she saw them in daylight.
<name>Alonzo</name>	Alonzo	Lapin	“I got an idea why you can hear it. It’s a proven fact that you can. Ain’t that the truth, [MASK]?” “Well, man, I ain’t never listened to it with you. And you say you can’t hear it unless you alone.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Levia	“Pork chops.” [MASK] ran out the back door, holding her stomach. “The poor Pig” Twilight was falling when she sat on the backyard steps. She tried to make out the outline of the things she enjoyed.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Joan	Her sobbing echoed on top of the water reaching far into the dark, empty spaces of swamp. And when she stopped, nature imitated her silence. But no longer did she feel its peace. Inside this timeless and changeless darkness, [MASK] felt different.
<name>Rosa</name>	Rosa	Levia	[MASK] didn’t know what to say. She just ran out the house. “The white people,” she said to herself, she kept repeating. “They killed my father.” She ran to the corner where the children were playing.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Joan	The backs remained in shadow as if everything had a covered and undiscov-erable side. The light on her mother, [MASK] thought, made a mask of her face—painted bright in the front and smiling with tension—over the true depth of her thoughts.
<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Levia	She called back, “I’m just in eighth grade.” [MASK] hurried with her head down and her arms across her chest, to the bathroom under the bleachers. It was dimly lit and where ceiling lights were broken in places, electricity buzzed in the dark.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Levia	They spoke in a jovial way that encouraged their sons and daughters to adulthood by sharing the laugh. Watching from a distance away, [MASK] knew what occurred. The adults stood confidentially close to one another, but arrogantly.
<name>integrate</name>	integrate	Levia	It seemed good enough to think about, when it was planned. But now it just appeared too much trouble to [MASK]. People were always protesting and others moved from places they lived all their lives. Where blacks and whites had lived willingly with their differences, now they were bitter.
<name>Jesse</name>	Jesse	Walter	“You could be old as you want to be,” [MASK] said. “I know you remember and you read.” “Don’t be spreading that around, man. I’ll lose my reputation as a good bartender ...”
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Joan	“What if I’m too stupid for her? I got no city in me,” [MASK] thought as she framed the ponytail around her face. “Is all a mistake,” she regretted her existence. Night was beginning to fall in the French Quarter.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Jack	“But I don’t quite understand,” [MASK] said. “You are saying that there are racial differences. But you don’t want to call it that.” “Of course, everybody is different. That’s what I’m saying makes them the same.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Joan	Is there anything you can tell me?” [MASK] imagined herself speaking boldly and cruelly to this parent, although she really needed an answer. “When I meet her, this is what I will tell her.”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Aces	Did [MASK] care for her less? Sometimes she sat, observer to his affection. No, he did not massage her shoulders anymore, pass his hand down her back, kiss the part in her hair. At the Blue Peacock she saw him treat other women.
<name>Sula</name>	Sula	Joan	But me, I can’t have one no way.” “The babies is trouble. You never heard of getting in trouble? Child, you too innocent.” The store woman pushed the package of roots into [MASK]’s hand, “for when you will need them.”
<name>Mildred</name>	Mildred	Levia	Another cheer broke from the stadium above her head. [MASK] tried to laugh like the girls did who were standing under the light. But she only succeeded in making a dumb sound like little grunts linked by a strained desire. Suddenly people came running down the ramps of the stadium.
<name>Camille</name>	Camille	Joan	The photo in the doctor’s pocket had life of its own. Energy radiated from it, making him feel touched and tense. All the way back to the French Quarter apartment, the doctor tried to decide whether to show the picture to [MASK] now or to wait until they found her mother.
<name>Hemingway</name>	Hemingway	Jack	“Just a half loaf dress shrimp.” [MASK] looked at them both. “Do you have an American cheese sandwich and a salad?” “I think we could find it,” the waitress said and continued writing as the older men smiled.
<name>Altagracia</name>	Altagracia	Joan	The doctor had talked to her the previous night about not running away anymore, growing up and starting a new life. [MASK] understood that he did not want her to return alone to the swamp. He wanted her to live with him or go work for the nuns.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Levia	Or were colors just reserved for the halos of saints, glows that surrounded their heads on top of their hair? As she was thinking, [MASK] loaded the gun for her father, to do him a favor. She took out the box of bullets from a different drawer.
<name>She</name>	She	Levia	She nodded hello to a soft, masculine face that she recognized from the neighborhood or was even related to. But when he smiled, [MASK] saw from the crookedness of the teeth and the way the lips were hooked around them, he was no one she knew.
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Walter	“I want to go into this postcard shop.” [MASK] waited outside next to the Mammy in a red-checkered dress with an apron and her head tied. She was stuffed cotton, like a big rag doll or something a taxortionist, he thought they called them, would do.
<name>Samantha</name>	Samantha	Levia	[MASK] went to the kitchen table, “Do we have to kill animals to eat?” Her mother replied, “Well, there are some things that we grow. A person could eat vegetables and grains all the time.” Her father entered the room, “No.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jack	They had not left the French Quarter but [MASK] felt transported. He was thrown to a time that he never lived. It was comfortable sometimes. Then he would feel totally out of place. He did not know these men.
<name>She</name>	She	Oceola	She ran down the steps of the building and into the street. The first call she could think of was a mockingbird whisde, a high screeching imitation of cats. [MASK] heard the sound behind her. It was familiar. But she couldn’t place it.
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Levia	While she and her mother waited with dinner, they turned on the news. “Oh my God, [MASK],” her mother called her close to the television. There were pictures of violence and sounds of shots as the camera weaved through the crowd.
<name>Marvin</name>	Marvin	Walter	But because of his funny looks, he never was given serious fame. The others [MASK] ran for were the people. He knew that sounded crazy when he told it to his wife. “You some kind of revolutionary?
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Levia	Too much fighting, supposedly because of their children. For years, [MASK] looked forward to high school. But now the first question everyone asked her was whether she wanted to go to school among blacks or whites. Next summer she’d have to make up her mind.
<name>Truman</name>	Truman	Walter	But to say that an aria, [MASK] knew opera too, was better than a riff, only a true fool would presume. Outside the evening was falling like a cheap window shade, the best buy for the people who loved summer because it still let the breeze and some light in too.
<name>he</name>	he	Joan	When he got older, in fact, he was the child as she told him what he could and could not do. Other times [MASK] spent walking in the woods or fishing with the dog in the pirogue. Now she did not have the dog either.
<name>Boyle</name>	Boyle	Walter	“Man, I just got a few beers in me. I’m sorry. I don’t mean to make fun. So what you going to do?” [MASK] asked. “Well, I figure I sit with it for a while, see if it get worse.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Walter	Most of the time, like that evening at the lake, his friends loved him so much because of his foolhardiness, they would save him. [MASK] himself, not much of a swimmer compared to the other guys, had also jumped in.
<name>He</name>	He	Joan	[MASK] asked. “Baby, sit down. But I didn’t. And I didn’t know it was you to come out. You were nothing to me then. I did not even see you.” “And you haven’t seen me since.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Joan	She had told the story so often. She had not made the connection between the “thing” and her daughter sitting in front of her. But [MASK] had. And then she decided that she was better off without a mother than with one like this.
<name>Among</name>	Among	Mosdy	People talked from the separate streets who never knew each other except by appearance. They introduced themselves by name. [MASK], the black people stayed. But the mother of the white country people from around the corner came bringing all of her children.
<name>Jerome</name>	Jerome	Edward	So I Know He’s Watching Me.’ They hooked then, they don’t know whether to stay or go. You know, like the Lord caught them red-handed.” “Man, do we must hear all this?” [MASK] asked.
<name>Eunice</name>	Eunice	Edward	“That’s right,” said [MASK]. “People always want to see the wolfs in sheep’s clothes. But what if the wolf in wolf clothes? Most of the time, seem like that to me anyhow.”
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Joan	When she got those images, they often proved out. Since a child, [MASK] saw clear pictures in her head during times of deep concentration. Sometimes, quicker than a picture a voice would give her advice. This voice too had the quality of predicting in advance something to happen.
<name>Jerome</name>	Jerome	Walter	[MASK] laughed, “Don’t go show yourself, unless you ready to share.” They stepped through one half of the swinging door and it banged back and forth, slamming against the lip of the other and squeaking.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Jack	He was definitely coming back. [MASK] stepped out of the bar and looked to one corner, then the other. The street was practically empty. It must have been about 7:00 A.M. He could hear trucks passing with a “Vaaroom” on nearby blocks.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jack	Is something wrong?” “Shoot, not no more than I’m thirsty and somebody better be buying the next round.” “Not me,” [MASK] said, trying to joke as he had heard the men do before. “How you know?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Edward	“He don’t need no lecture,” said [MASK]. “Tell us the rest.” “Well, don’t you know, when the judge bang down his hammer, all the people begins to boo. Hollering, ‘That ain’t right.’
<name>Sula</name>	Sula	Levia	“Does it matter?” she asked people who looked dumbfounded when they heard her reply. That was another occasion when her mother asked everyone to excuse her child. Then whoever posed the question to [MASK] in the first place would say she had a duty to her race.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Levia	A neighbor might tell her family. A stranger might hurt her. There were sailors and tourists, shopgirls and businessmen, teenagers much worldlier than [MASK] and foreigners who wanted to stop and talk. But people said that was pointless because they were dumb.
<name>Hemingway</name>	Hemingway	Walter	He was drunk by this time also and did not understand the offense, as it was slight. “The difference between where I was before and then,” [MASK] said, “was words. I still had the heart of a musician.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Jack	And [MASK] imagined or realized, he drank so much he wasn’t sure, that it was beginning to dawn. He could hear no sound but talking and maybe distantly a little music was playing. A shadowy aqua-green light seemed to bathe the street.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Aces	“Give her this picture, not the other one. Tell her you found it or something. Don’t tell her about [MASK]. That was a bad time,” the bartender said. “I don’t know.” The doctor started to hand the photo back.
<name>Delilah</name>	Delilah	Oceola	[MASK]’s red hair, heavy makeup, and bright orange dress were colored so obviously to be out of place here where her walls, floors, and even decorations were in shades of deep blue, green, and grey. Additionally, an aquarium gave the room an odd light.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Walter	“Who is the mayor’s wife now?” [MASK] remembered the newspaper headline. She was who she always had been. But now, men were calling at her, reporters following her down the street, women studying her hair and wanting to hear her speak.
<name>Essun</name>	Essun	Joan	[MASK] took that sense as one they did not share. She was never tempted to be that kind of mean. Sometimes she neglected her plants in the pots until they shriveled up. But she never desired to hurt something breathing. When she hunted she made sure her animals were quickly dead.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Levia	[MASK] nodded her head with each one, especially for the hurricane he mentioned twice, thinking he might get the message that she had to go and was getting bored. But that just seemed to encourage him to go on. “Out of respect,” her mother said pay attention to old people.
<name>John</name>	John	Walter	So you figure on beans, rice, and chicken wings. That’s about sixty-five cents a plate. “My sweet wife,” [MASK] said, “was so happy, I thought she’d arise right into heaven when they said they could feed all those poor folks.”
<name>Emmeline</name>	Emmeline	Joan	Visiting her house with the grandfather was like returning into some primitive century, some prehistoric time. The darkness and the rigidity of the home fixed in place, pressed in by constant isolation. When trees fell in that part of the swamp, no one but [MASK] and her grandfather heard the sound.
<name>Salinger</name>	Salinger	Walter	“Look, young man, don’t get all worried about that,” [MASK] said. “Just don’t bullshit me. There’s a lot of truth going on here.” “You know what’s the truth?”
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Levia	She had to defend them from the bullies across the street, she said too. Once she said she hit a boy in the head with a baseball bat. “I never went to see what happened to him,” she told [MASK], “and I heard he was OK
<name>Envy</name>	Envy	Peace	She heard once on the radio that everything living has colors, like emotions. [MASK] is green and anger is red. She wondered how she looked in the light of the bedroom lamp, if it had the power to diagnose her feelings as it did with the turncoat gun.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Joan	How did people recognize each other among so many? It was different for animals. They acted on smell. [MASK] recognized them too. The raccoons near her home in the swamp who came from the same mother had a particular grey strip of hair on the same side.
<name>Sylvia</name>	Sylvia	Joan	When she didn’t answer, she could see their heads bowed toward one another, talking. [MASK] did not want to answer because she was confused. The wrong time to appear seemed to be when they called. What explanation would she give for hiding in the yard?
<name>Seamus</name>	Seamus	Lapin	“Go on man, parade,” [MASK] called. He was strutting from one end of the bar to the other, waving his dishrag above his head. Three steps up, three steps back, two steps, two steps, one to the side.
<name>Lord</name>	Lord	Lord	The old ones who come dragging they feet and the young ones who played nothing that hadn’t been electrified. They all came to strut, like I said, for all their different reasons. But [MASK], that was a day.
<name>She</name>	She	Joan	She could not help but begin laughing. Her grandfather then made her happy just as the doctor was trying to now. They wanted to give of themselves to satisfy her emptiness. But they could not fill it. Her mother was special, [MASK] knew, although they had never met.
<name>Sal</name>	Sal	Delesepps	If [MASK] could get away from his beer and his wife after his day of painting houses, he’d break out his violin. Man, you couldn’t get a more beautiful situation that that. “Those were nights.
<name>Slothrop</name>	Slothrop	Walter	“. . . out of work for a long time, if you call musicianing work, meaning only you get money. My sign, now, [MASK] in a Moment, people seen so much they think I’m stupid . . .”
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Joan	The teacher wanted to send [MASK] to school in the city. She could come home on weekends like other young people did. Her grandfather said no. “She got to go some time. She could live with the nuns in the week,” the teacher argued.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Jack	Except the city is supposed to be for all of the people and most of the people without the key, the ones you don’t give nothing to, you don’t even know. “So look here, [MASK], this is what I did to the cause of being fair.
<name>James</name>	James	Levia	Then [MASK] took a seat near the top of the stadium. The air was clear and cool, hinting of the arrival of fall. The oppressive heat in summer that made a poor choice of any seat close to the sun was gone.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Levia	“I didn’t have to fight. You just got to be smart,” she advised. It was just like with white people, [MASK] thought. Always someone was telling her, “We have to outsmart them to get what we want.”
<name>Earl</name>	Earl	Walter	“Drink up, boy. You a young man,” [MASK] was patting him on the forearm and encouraging him. “You not going to slow down now, are you? Don’t be no chump. I’m about to get to the best part.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Joan	There were men and women holding onto each other in most obvious ways. Many of them seemed mismatched, [MASK] could tell by their fashions. She noticed that one of the couple wore very bright clothes while the other had on dark colors.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Walter	“I knew you would on that part.” There was a glossiness in the older man’s eyes. “People believe in our souls,” [MASK]’s wife had told him when things started to become rough, “so we must.”
<name>her</name>	her	Joan	The woman wanted him to buy [MASK] a dress to wear to church festivals in town and for parties. She said, “Here, put your gal pretty in this here.” The store owner pushed something lacy and bright yellow in front of the old man’s face.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Honey	But you could hear those old girls whispering back asking them, ‘[MASK], you can have some if you want. Don’t you? This is good.’ “Well, of course, I got to get up in front of the people.
<name>Jenkins</name>	Jenkins	Walter	I say like I want to say. Politics is of the people. And I am of the people. That’s why the people elected me.” [MASK] looked at the visitor, a sorry little young man, as people go.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Joan	Then she put them all overboard. The swamp folded her grandfather inside as he sank and she said prayers to remind herself his spirit left during the previous night, and now she submerged only his shell. But [MASK] began crying and praying words from the Bible.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Joan	[MASK] held the object deep to her grandfather’s ribs to hear the faint swishing and patting not quite in rhythm like clothes on the line being blown by the wind against the side of the house. Her own heart in contrast sounded like her bare foot tapping against the planks of the porch.
<name>Neeka</name>	Neeka	Levia	And if she got it because she was smarter, why didn’t she have it all along? Her mother said civil rights was a problem for white people, because “then they will have to see we’re the same.” A cheer went up from the stands above [MASK]’s head.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Oceola	[MASK] ran, then stood on the corner to watch. The girl ran by the blade. But the man picked it up. After looking at the blade in his hands, and hesitating, the man finally brought his arm back and threw it.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Levia	[MASK] didn’t know if it was worth all that much. Why couldn’t everything have stayed soft and comfortable like when she was young and a baby? Then, the family went on picnics out at the lake.
<name>John</name>	John	Walter	[MASK] remembered he’d had to get bodyguards for his wife because she shunned some men in the grocery store. She never was the kind of woman to play along with men. But after he got elected, people said she was trying to act stuck up.
<name>Ignatius</name>	Ignatius	Edward	Pass out the key to the city. Sheet, now if that ain’t a lie I don’t know what is. Please tell me, what does the key to the city unlock?” “The bathrooms at the Lake Pontchartrain shelters,” [MASK] said.
<name>Jem</name>	Jem	Edward	[MASK] looked down at the ground and said weakly, “I think it’s sick from the heat. I went over there and it’s foaming a little around the mouth. I couldn’t tell. And it ain’t saying a word to me.”
<name>Monsieur</name>	Monsieur	Lord	“Benitez-nous, Monsieur,” was all he could mumble. They were the first words he said before accepting his plate three times a day, “Bless us, [MASK].” “The daughter wants to see the mother,” he finally said.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Walter	“I’m getting to that.” It was two in the afternoon, the sun blazed like a spotlight on the story [MASK] was about to tell. The men left the mule alone so they could go and get sandwiches “in the air condition.”
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Oceola	“Hurry up. Get out of here, fool.” The women ahead of [MASK] told her to catch up. Instead, she stopped and leaned into her boot. She pulled out her long blade knife. She would give it to the child.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Joan	She noticed that one of the couple wore very bright clothes while the other had on dark colors. Pushed up against each other in doorways or heaped together in cars, they first appeared to [MASK] like sparrows nesting with bluejays.
<name>Janet</name>	Janet	Levia	They were all safer if the children stayed on the blanket she placed on one patch of grass while she alone went to the concession stand. But [MASK] now told her brother and sister, “Here, take some money and go get on a ride,” to make them feel better.
<name>Tina</name>	Tina	Joan	“You got to think and act like an adult now. If you didn’t find your mother, what, huh?” “That’s not possible,” [MASK]’s pride now lied to cover the realization she made on the streets.
<name>Reba</name>	Reba	Jack	Got a man said he would pick up three old folks a week from the home take them to the social security office for a key. And people paid money. The nuns counted two, three thousand dollars just off of rugs. Do you know how much poor people that could feed, [MASK]?”
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Walter	So now you just got to go to jail.’ “‘But am I still the mayor, your honor?’ I ask him. “‘I’m sorry to tell you, [MASK]. But you ain’t even got that.’
<name>Granny</name>	Granny	Walter	“The thing I had to learn was you got to hold it in your hand for a minute to make your wish, then you let it go. Even the children know that. But people get more stupid as they grow,” [MASK] said.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Edward	[MASK] said. “Shoot, do a mile before you know it or play pitch the can, see through the water clear like in your bathtub. Now, you couldn’t see you hand in front of your face, was you was to put your face in that mess.”
<name>John</name>	John	Jack	You already inside your own walls.’ I separated them. But I swear, I was sure proud of her every minute since that. That’s a good woman, [MASK]. She tell what need to be told, when it need to be.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	George	She was young with a clear face and a smile that showed no lipstick and much more sincerity. On the back was written in a shaky hand with fountain pen, “To [MASK]. From O.C.” The bartender said, “Oh. I wrote that in the war.”
<name>John</name>	John	Lapin	[MASK] asked. “It’s that he speaks the things that people don’t believe. They can’t or don’t want to believe or something. I ain’t figured that part out yet. But I know it’s the truth.” “You right, my friend.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Levia	[MASK] didn’t know what to do. If she moved away, he would think she was rude. Plus, she already was sitting at the top, so she would encounter him if she tried any route to leave.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Edward	“A big crowd gathered listening to the music and started to help when they found out what it was that we was doing,” continued [MASK]. “And most of them, lot of folks, got in their cars and followed us out to the nuns’ house.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Jack	I go running straight to the St. Bernard bus. But guess who I’m following behind?” “\bur wife?” asked [MASK]. “You right, young man. There she was barefoot as she want to be, running with one shoe in her hand.
