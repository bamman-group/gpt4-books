<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Laura	If you knew what to leave behind ... [MASK] moved restlessly. Lying awake, like this, did your feelings no good. It was childish to be so upset. To keep putting your finger on a sore place does the hurt no good!
<name>him</name>	him	Sam	She’d managed to be calm all day— to wait. But now that she knew [MASK] must be home, she could wait no longer. She had to find out, had to see him, had to talk.
<name>Pap</name>	Pap	Bill	Used to say there was too dadbum many of em. String one up now and then or drop him in the pond to the gators—made the others flourish like pruning a tree. [MASK] took things pretty far. Did as a boy.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	LAURA	TWENTY-SIX [MASK] HAD DRESSED early and sat now in the library, inept and griefless in her thin black dress of mourning. Beyond the wide double doors which opened into the living room, slow-gathering friends and neighbors dragged like a heavy chain, refusing her solitude.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Non	“I’ve thought maybe I could do something with machinery—don’t know—what do you think, [MASK]?” She’d smiled. “That is one of the things you know so much about. I know so little,” she said, “but it seems right, somehow."
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Tracy	[MASK] tapped on the door, opened it slowly. His mother was brushing her hair. "May I come in?" Her plump white arm moved up and down in the shadows, the smoky blue crepe of her dressing gown falling away at the elbow.
<name>Aunt Dicey</name>	Aunt Dicey	Ernie	Hit ain good, [MASK]," she added, "for chudren to be brung up round glumness. Dey need to hear folks laughin. You know datl A spoonful of grits’ll make a child healthy ef you keep him alaughin while he eats it."
<name>Cassie</name>	Cassie	Tracy	The smell of scorched cloth from shanties clung to the sweet, near odor of honeysuckle in her hand. Slowly she took a step toward him. “I am youm,” she whispered, and held out the grubby flowers. Twelve-year-old [MASK] took them.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Laura	[MASK] watched her. Beyond them, from the other rooms, came a chirr of voices, restrained below a level of cheerfulness but steadily increasing in volume, as though many people now were entering the house. “It’s time ...”
<name>Berenice</name>	Berenice	Dorothy	Get saved in Colored Town—get you a nigger— she’ll save you—make you feel good—make—O.K. by him. If that’s the way men work things out—O.K. by him. He’d marry [MASK], join the church.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Nonnie	Ain’t they sweetl Sometimes I’ve thought I wouldn’t mind death if I could go smelling something sweet as tuberoses— Don’t it—pink, I mean—for a man?” “Yes mam,” [MASK] said....
<name>Tracy</name>	Tracy	Alma	Until sometimes it was difficult not to tell her to leave your house foreverl When [MASK] became pregnant again and her mother wanted to take the young Tracy back with her, it was easier to let her take him than to fight it out.
<name>Sister</name>	Sister	Tillie	Her mother sighed. “Sometimes I think you is outgrowed yo careless ways and then lak this, yo seems— Sister, you must learn tuh think aheadl I don know what’ll become of you ef you don leam tuh think.” [MASK] sighed again.
<name>Malcolm</name>	Malcolm	Tillie	He went on talking low, as if he had not heard [MASK]. “Saddy night... I were in da store . . . buyin me a plug of tobaccy . . . back of me . . . two white men talkin ... bout women.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Rosie	“There ain no runnin away from white folks, [MASK], you oughter know that well as me. There’s ways to git along wid white folks if you hunts round for um. I’ve spent my whole life ahuntin . . .
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Dot	She stood there waving as he went down the steps to the tracks, peering at him through her bifocal glasses, and smiling a little vaguely. She had stood here on the porch tonight, waving, after he asked her to go with him and [MASK] for a coke.
<name>Calpurnia</name>	Calpurnia	Harris	You’re talking too much—” [MASK] paused, went on, "I know it’s hard for an educated colored man to live in the South. Like running into barbed wire everywhere you turn. Told you that before.
<name>ghosts</name>	ghosts	Bess	She had to hold to that. Needed her, and cared. Nothing could change that. Nothing anyone could do or say could change that. She must not worry about foolish, imaginary things, making up dangers, like [MASK], to scare herself with.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Laura	while everything [MASK], with her degrees decorating her like a slimy French general, did was just right "And what honors did you bring home this time .. Cackling geese, the whole town. After him now . . . evangelist hot on his heels . . .
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Tracy	[MASK] ... so far away tonight. It was as if she could never again bridge the distance. Thinking of him now made the distance greater, as if something were pulling him away and she could only stand and watch his going. She was cold and afraid.
<name>The Chief</name>	The Chief	Tom	“Watch your step, boys,” he had called out to the darkness. If these irresponsible whippersnappers didn’t watch out, there would be trouble. Bad trouble, and they didn’t have the sense to see it. [MASK] stood at the telephone, his hand still on the receiver.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Tracy	She would take off each garment carefully, gently, as if she were taking off a part of herself. Dress would be examined for spots, shaken out, hung up; slip would be shaken out, hung up; brassiere— [MASK] smiled.
<name>Mrs. Ramsey</name>	Mrs. Ramsey	Eenie	At the kitchen door he automatically stooped, but in his haste to relay the message to [MASK] he forgot to use caution and struck his shoulder a hard blow against the door jamb, righted himself, eased through, closed the door behind him, lost his balance and dropped the tray.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Tom	"Know where I got him? In jail. Yeah, behind barsl Safe as a baby. Letting the law look after him. Law ought to protect innocent well as guilty—especially when nobody knows it’s doing it.” [MASK] chuckled.
<name>Mrs. Bains</name>	Mrs. Bains	Sadie	She wiped her mouth and went on with the afternoon news. ’’They’re singing over at the tent, and it’s real sweet Children’s services always seem real sweet some way.” "What they singing, [MASK]?”
<name>be</name>	be	Bess	Her high nose seemed to [MASK] a barricade against her. “Where is he, please? I must see him.” “He ain’t here.” Lips shut tight. “Where is he, please? It’s important. Awfully important.”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Dorothy	Nobody thinks I’ve been decent to her—and I haven’t. Been pretty yellow, I guess, but—well, to cut it short—” He drew in a deep breath. “Today I gave [MASK] a ring. We’re to be married in the fall.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Nonnie	it was the first time always asked you were scared you . .. "Now for another tuberose. Here, tie it tight, [MASK], pull now—that’s it! What would you put here? Yes, that fern is needed.
<name>he</name>	he	Sam	“Bookkeepers have a way of putting everything in the wrong column,” he laughed, went on copying figures in his notebook. There was no one in the office, [MASK] was relieved to see. Be easier to say what he had come to say.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Tom	I don’t know how—” He paused, and his brown eyes rested on [MASK]’s face. “I don’t know exactly how, but it’s bigger— Things—unions —things is goin to make it bigger, some day. Different.”
<name>George</name>	George	Tut	He felt in his wife a new quality of uncertainty. He had not realized before how old she was—how old we both are, he amended, for [MASK]’s thoughts were ordinarily as well sifted as his words. Past middle age—and showing it.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Harris	And as he crossed the railroad and passed through the narrow stretch of cypress and palmetto, a light had flashed in his face. “It’s [MASK],” a voice had called. Another one muttered, "All right.” "What you up to, boys?”
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Bess	Always the lamps in this house smokel” And one of the twins climbed up in a chair and turned the wick down, and everyone tried to laugh a little. Then they went home, silent. At the door [MASK] said almost gently, "I know it’s no use for me to say it
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Charles	Things not so quiet around. Hate for them to be out tonight by themselves. Wish you’d go, if you don’t mind.” [MASK] laid down his book. "What’s the matter with this town? Have you heard the talk?”
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Dessie	And [MASK] began to see that sometimes (oiks line up by color and sometimes they line up by other things—like sins, and who is good to them, and where they work. “You better hurry, chile, an git dat table sot.”
<name>Joey</name>	Joey	Sam	[MASK] was laughing now. You’d missed what the old man had been saying. “All these folks tote water from the well down near the branch. There’re a hundred palmetto bushes and every one a privy, draining into it, straight as my old man used to go for likker on Saturday night.
<name>Meg</name>	Meg	Henry	Slowly the ene* mies assumed a decorous position of limb. The voice went on. "Turn the damper, the stove is too hot. You’ll burn the place up. Your kitchen is sweltering. [MASK], your table isn’t set. It is late.’’
<name>God</name>	God	Laura	Laid a burden on me that I couldn’t shake off—’’ I’ve given my life to you and [MASK]—all of it—I’ve asked little of you in return and you’ve given me nothing— “Funny, way I tried.
<name>Mr. McKee</name>	Mr. McKee	Dorothy	Always finding— She was talking again and wiping the cold cream from her neck as she talked. "I’ll give you the check in the morning,” the said, “and then I want you to go straight to [MASK] and talk this whole thing over.
<name>Lena</name>	Lena	Bess	[MASK] had a feeling that if she said it aloud, if she once put words to it, all she feared would come true. But if she didn’t say it, maybe it would be something she had made up—like so many of her worries.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Nonnie	A piece of moss had fallen from the limb above them on her breast, and she had let it rest there. Any other girl would have jumped or exclaimed or thrown it off. But [MASK] let it rest there. Easy.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Tracy	[MASK] laughed. "And like as not I would too.” “These things—hants—hell, they stand for something. I wish I knew what. There’s an argument, a damned good argument against all this revival stuff, but trouble is, I don’t know what it is.
<name>she</name>	she	Laura	She says they’re after him. He didn’t do it of course,” she’d added quickly. "Maybe he did,” though he knew better. "No,” [MASK] spoke as if she knew. "No. He wouldn’t have done it.”
<name>Vivian</name>	Vivian	Tillie	“[MASK]?” She searched for a meeting ground. “She’s Miz Purviance’s cook.” “Yeah, I know. Now run on before it’s pitch-dark.” “Who is you?” Voice shy in its first social exploration.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Mommy	White women eyed him curiously, and a mill child came close up to the car and stared at him. “Hit’s another nigger, [MASK]’’ he cried, and the woman said, “Shut yo mouth! He might git ye and hurt ye.
<name>smiled</name>	smiled	Laura	She remembered with startling clearness her feeling of peace, as if the baby [MASK] had for all time answered an old nagging doubt. She, who seldom was without some handwork, had sat with hands quiet as her heart, watching her baby. This child loved her.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Mamie	“I got to whip you,” she said and hushed. And the two children stood there in the back yard and waited while [MASK] went out to the garden and cut her a good heavy sprout from the pecan tree.
<name>Toni</name>	Toni	Nonnie	You could say it, say [MASK]’s name after it, and still believe in her and yourself. The world’s wrong, you could say. Dead wrong. She’d turned then, as if she had read his thoughts. “Race is something—made up, to me.
<name>Benjamin</name>	Benjamin	Tracy	Not directly, but by the subtle influence of his failures. [MASK]’s tight lips, his silence, his withdrawal from the family, his refusal to be someone worth while, the long hours spent . . . Wherever he spent his time it was wickedly spent—this she knew.
<name>Joe Christmas</name>	Joe Christmas	Bess	You keep thinking . . . time [MASK] told the kinfolks about you crawling up in your mama’* lap, nudging the baby Non-nie out of the way, grabbing the teat for yourself, patting the breast, patting, patting, she’d said.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Eddie	Its shrill cry trickled down her body like ice water. She beat frantically on a door that would not open. “I don’t give a damn,” [MASK] said stubbornly. “Oh you’re such a fooll” she was hating him, and hating, grew sane. "
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Dessie	She turned to ease cramped muscles. [MASK] lay on the floor, curled up like a brown puppy at her feet. She was breathing easily through wide-open mouth, as she had breathed all her life in sleep.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Ed	“It’s the same old Maxwell, [MASK],” he said quietly. “But it’s not so bad. You ought to have a pretty good time if these girls feed you the way your mother used to feed us.”
<name>John</name>	John	Sam	"I came back because my people need me. They need me right here. I came back,” [MASK] looked up into his white friend’s face and tried to smile, “because it’s my home. That’s enough to make a man die laughingl
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Tracy	Ever thought of it?” [MASK] suddenly laughed. The preacher wasn’t so bad. “You take things that matter on faith. There’s no way of proving them! I don’t say that in the pulpit, mind you, or to the ladies.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	So	She had been shaken with fury by her son’s stubborn silence, his refusal to admit her rightness. And now, as she remembered it, she gTew angry. [MASK] stiffly had he obeyed her, baring his thin thighs to the switching.
<name>girl</name>	girl	Laura	I know.” “I miss the little [MASK].” Her mother had smiled, but the muscles in her throat had trembled. “You’d want me to grow up, wouldn’t you?” She’d see if she could turn it into more casual directions.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Non	"I mean it. I could vomit. In slavery maybe, in those bad years afterward, folks had to find back ways. Had to! Not now. We’ve got to follow American ways. We’ve got to be respectable. We are respectable, [MASK].
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Sam	You’ll do it, won’t you?” He did not answer her. “You’ll do it, won’t you, [MASK]?” Why did he just stand there as if he had not heardl “She’s so hardheaded!” Suddenly she was angry.
<name>George</name>	George	Sam	It's late, she thought, you got to get back to your supper, it’s late. But she went on talking. ‘‘Last night... looking at those overalls... I began to see him—” [MASK] looks tired. No sleep.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Dorothy	It’d all be the same. And she’d give it like a swamp bay lets you smell its sweetness. Just as simply. Not [MASK]. He’d have a time with that girl. He thought now of her sallow-faced mother.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Bess	Rubbing his thumb against the side of the chair—you could hear the sound of it. [MASK] looked at her brother, and though the room was almost dark she could see enough. Yes—feeling sudden pride —he’s good-looking and clean and neat.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Bess	"You won’t have the courage to see it through,” there seemed no end to [MASK]’s words, tumbling out as if freed from a too-long restraint, “and don’t you dare tell me others havel Just look at our skin!
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Non	"Would you like to talk to me, [MASK], about it?” It made him feel decent to say that to her. It made him feel almost as he had felt the night he danced with her. It was coming back, the feeling he had lost.
<name>one</name>	one	Dottie	He laughed, lit his cigarette again, enjoyed smoking it. What would [MASK]’s sins be? In a life so neat, so orderly, like a folded handkerchief carried around all day and never crumpled—where would there be room for a life-size sin?
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tracy	[MASK] half smiled. “I think maybe you’re right.” “Well,” said the preacher, “how about it? How about trying it on the Lord’s side—and man’s, for a while?” "I’ll think about it.”
<name>Ma	Ma	Samt	He couldn’t know much more than she— What made her believe him, like this? "And somehow, seeing those two things ... hurt so. They were so poor, [MASK] All their life colored folks so poor . . . working...
<name>he</name>	he	Deen	By his side she sat there now, pushed up close to him, kind of cuddling in public, as some little women do. She was looking up at him every few minutes and smiling. And [MASK] smiled back, as if he meant it.
<name>Lucinda</name>	Lucinda	Snooks	Sure—sure. She worries so—you’re making her nervous. It’s her bad time-change of life. Try to be easy on her now—try to— He cut across to avoid the boys. Went back of the A.M.E. Church to [MASK]’ cabin.
<name>Rhett</name>	Rhett	Tracy	"All right. Tell me quick. What’s happened?” She looked up at him steadily. “I’m pregnant, [MASK].” She felt his hand tremble on her arm. “And I’m glad,” she whispered. “Glad?
<name>Tea Cake</name>	Tea Cake	Henry	A sweet sensation of warmth crept over her. He drew her closer. “Us can’t—here," she whispered. “Us is gwine find a big palmetto bush, honey,” and, laughing, [MASK] picked her up and went out of the door.
<name>Elmer</name>	Elmer	Henry	You’d think after we made fools of ourselves in the war, folks would be ashamed to hold revivals. And right now there’s one going on in almost every town in the state. [MASK], you ought to know the answer to all this."
<name>Mrs. Dubose</name>	Mrs. Dubose	Mamie	Both of them like little children, with no attempt to hide their tears. [MASK] was already on the wagon seat, sitting primly with her hat on, and her hands, in their black cotton gloves, folded in her lap.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Tracy-	Mighty smart—yeah—making everybody laugh at me—making everybody laugh, you hear? Making the whole goddamed town laugh its head off— you—” “[MASK]” “I’ve caught on. You’re nigger ... yesh . . . nigger.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Nonnie	“You’re having a chill right this minute! Here. Take this quinine. Take it, [MASK]! Might have known you was going to have a chill when you came this morning. Looked sick then. Take it now.”
<name>May</name>	May	Dorothy	Went on, "Mother’s so glad, it’s kind of—you see, I’ve always failed them. Always managed somehow to do the wrong thing— There’s [MASK] . . . Nobody thinks I’ve been decent to her—and I haven’t.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Dorothy	And women touched his arm, with maternal affection, letting their hands linger as if loath to give up what had been so long in returning to them. And always there was [MASK] by his side, smiling and crisp and neat and devoted. Enjoying her small triumph.
<name>Gene</name>	Gene	Dot	She was a nice decent girl who would make a comfortable pleasant home for him. After all, what more should you expectl They’d be by themselves in the country, he’d hunt in the bill—take her with him sometimes, pretty good shot, [MASK].. .
<name>Flora</name>	Flora	Bess	Go out there and we’ll find something for you to eat. [MASK], fix him a sandwich and a cup of coffee.” But her voice had not changed nor had the muscles of her face moved. She was neither irritated nor sorry for him.
<name>Brett</name>	Brett	Act	[MASK] easy and casual. "Of course not. Like to have a chance to, after so many years.” Out of character. Too polite. “Bet you’re broke—that it?” She laughed. That’s more like it.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Bess	“I knew . . . I’ve always known he’d ruin you.” “I’m not ruined. I’m happy. Very happy,” she added softly. [MASK] stared at her. "I believe you think he loves you,” she whispered.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Harriet	[MASK] came from the living room where she had been reading, and slipped into a chair. “I’ve always wondered how a lyncher feels,” she said. “Now I know.” The two men did not answer. “Every Southerner knows, of course.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Alma	He’d like to go to her and put his hand on her shoulder. Like to kiss her and remind her that he was still here—to give her what comfort he could. Been a long time since he’d kissed [MASK] like that A long time.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Tillie	You looks plum lak a little fat sow.” [MASK] laughing in good-natured teasing now until big flat breasts jounced against her body like two old bags. "Hit must be near yo time, ain’t it?” The foot was freed from its binding.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Harriet	It seemed to him that she should be with the crowd, with [MASK], with the others her own age, not here with Mother. She’ll be an old maid before she’s twenty-five, he thought, and found himself angry.
<name>Mrs. Pusey</name>	Mrs. Pusey	Dorothy	She’d be cute at fifty and not so petite either—probably skinny. Well, that was [MASK]. Clean, herself, and kept the Pusey house clean. Made good cucumber pickle and excellent fudge and was pleased over doing both. Sang in the choir.
<name>Curley's wife</name>	Curley's wife	Sadie	[MASK] smoothed the sheet once more. Maybe in a minute, now, she’d go to sleep. It’s hard to believe the men you’ve seen downtown every day—so pleasant and agreeable to you, always doing something kind for you-could do a thing like this.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Nonnie	‘Time we cross ... the patch ... it’ll be good and light,” whispering, voice like leaves scuttling down a path. “[MASK], you’re scared of something.” “No.” “Hands cold and you’re— What’s happened?”
<name>Cherry</name>	Cherry	Non	The sun made its way through the half-opened shutter, moved across [MASK]’s face, stripping off the maturity which had been there in the dim light, tendering wide full lips, until you knew you were looking at a kid—a fool kid who doesn’t know what she’s doing!
<name>John</name>	John	Sam	brown hand beating softly, “you take it and take it and take it... day comes ... you can’t take any more ..voice had sunk to a whisper now, “can’t take any more . . [MASK] stared out of the window across the tracks.
<name>something</name> (There is no proper name in this passage)	something (There is no proper name in this passage)	Teady	What’d he do it for?” “What ud any nigger do it for? They don’t reason! Ain’t got nothing to reason with in their caboodles. When a damned nigger gits [MASK] to kill he kills, that’s all there is to it.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Laura	Never’d seen [MASK] cry. Everybody crying . . . crazy . . . everybody . . . better . . . Slowly he went up the stain, stopped on each step, feeling for the next with his foot. Slow and dull, as if he had heard strange bad news from a far country.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Sis	"Therc’re other things in the world. [MASK],” he’d said gently, “but maybe you don’t want them.” "Maybe I would want them—if I knew what they are.” She knew, yes she knew.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tracy	The swamp behind her, the night, were ugly and threatening. The rattle of palmettos near the fence, an evil sound. Maybe she was wrong. Maybe she had made it all up. Maybe it wasn’t any of it real—hers and [MASK]’s life together.
<name>John</name>	John	Bess	It was as if she had shut out this world she’d been bom into, insulating herself by soft denials of it. If she said it didn’t exist, it didn’t exist. It was this invulnerableness which angered [MASK], this giving the lie to her fears.
<name>she</name>	she	Dottie	He had the feeling that [MASK] might let him set the date but the decision of marriage itself had been made by her long ago, maybe in high school or when he took her to her first party. It seemed as old, as familiar as that.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Sam	“Sometimes, [MASK],” he said, “I believe I need glasses. Things get blurred, bother me, sort of. Ever have any trouble like that? Seeing things you—don’t know whether you see or don’t see?”
<name>Edgar</name>	Edgar	Dangerous	But he must have made it up. A pair of tweezers lay near the comb. She’d been pulling the hairs from that mole near her lip. Glad she wasn’t doing that now. It made him uneasy to watch her jerk at herself like that. [MASK].
<name>George</name>	George	Dot	After we are married, a little farther. He had grown restless and impatient and had stopped the slow movement of the swing with his foot, as if to stop . .. everything. [MASK] was talking. “We’ll make the old farm over, if you decide on it.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Willie	“I don’t aim to go,” [MASK] said. “Shore don’t aim to. All them College Street folks with their airs and their money! No goddumed revival for me. Not if the preacher was to climb the tent pole like he done before.
