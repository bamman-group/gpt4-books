<name>Oscar</name>	Oscar	Voltaire	Too late [MASK] realised what he risked losing, & returned to witness his great love dying in childbirth—which is why, after causing such misery, it was only right & proper he ended up an empty-headed perfume bottle used to bring women to pleasure ever after.
<name>man</name>	man	Dane	I picked up the book that had lain across the old [MASK]’s face—its corner darkly bloodied from where it had gored his eyeball out—to see what, if anything, it might have to say on the matter of unmeditated murder.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Ton	The old Dane shoved up against me, communicating his vision of my future Hell not only with mere words but in the dribbly froth which accompanied them & blew in a spume over my face. ‘[MASK] will be afflicted by thirst <& loathsome diseases,' sprayed he.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Lempriere	possessions—overbaked, crusty & craggy to the touch, doughy & soft in their centre, be it the rough worm-riddled table, or the portraits that oozed over his walls, all of which seemed to wish to shout, ‘We too are [MASK].’
<name>Galadriel</name>	Galadriel	Pobjoy	As [MASK] so long ago told me, definitions belong to the defxner, not the defined, & I no longer wished to have my life & death foretold by others. I had endured too much to be reduced to an idea.
<name>Magwitch</name>	Magwitch	HESLOP	‘a CALLING,’ he had told the mute convict, ‘GLORIOUS & SACRED—WHAT I HAVE GIVEN YOU—WHAT SAY YOU, EH, [MASK]?’ to which the mute, was, of course, unable to say anything.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Gould	Or at least no difference that matters. And certainly, the book you will read is the same as the book I remember reading, and I have tried to be true both to the wonder of that reading and to the extraordinary world that was [MASK]’s.
<name>Pip</name>	Pip	Pobjoy	When the water rises to my belly, I hide my fish & these bloody thoughts, then yell at the door until [MASK] comes to fetch his convict-Constable. And what a splendid spot I have for my book of fish!
<name>God</name>	God	Commerce	Somewhat unsteadily I picked up a paintbrush, my light body stumbling in the heavy mud, recovered my balance, & set to work, fully intending despite the fug of nausea that overwhelmed me, to paint the Commandant a picture of Revelation & Profound Discovery that remade the world anew as [MASK].
<name>Queen</name>	Queen	Pobjoy	To clarify my point a little further, I threatened the King in the manner I had found to be so effective with [MASK], & seeing what I had in my hand ready to lob should he say a word in criticism, he ventured no folly of comment.
<name>Robinson Crusoe</name>	Robinson Crusoe	Keats	‘And great unerring Nature,’ continued [MASK], ‘for once seems wrong.’ VI Twenty years passed. There ought be a full reckoning of my life through that time, but I have just read to the King what I have so far written.
<name>Mr. Quin</name>	Mr. Quin	Maurepas	[MASK] gazed up at the jolly Frenchmen in shivering incomprehension, as his wife & children returned from the sea, as dogs vomited forth pieces of human beings that reformed into whole people, as the brutal repression of the slave revolt turned into a brief liberty then finally, once more, an infinite servitude.
<name>Polonius</name>	Polonius	Heaven	Now I realise it is an idea that would appeal greatly to the King in his dialogue with [MASK], but when I mention it the King rolls his body slightly which is his way of showing utter contempt for an opinion other than his own.
<name>William</name>	William	Brady	The sun was growing ever greater in size & redder in ?8i colour until it was a monstrous bloody sphere the precise outline of which disappeared into that dark catastrophe of memories; & lost within it forever [MASK] & his great liberating army, ham hocks,
<name>Death</name>	Death	McCabe	4- that Nature at the same time! And they waited for when he & [MASK] & the rest of the grand gang would burst like those splendid horsemen of the Apocalypse out of that inferno dispensing a fiery judgement with muskets of thunder & flintlocks of righteousness.
<name>Ignatius</name>	Ignatius	Pobjoy	[MASK] reacted like it was a turd not a word I had thrown, leapt upon me & began thrashing me. I thanked him for that also, as it meant he would shortly be leaving. ‘You idiot!’
<name>Beethoven</name>	Beethoven	Cicero	They praised the plaster busts of [MASK] that began to arrive even before the plans were complete, wrote sonnets in imitation of styles long dead & succeeded in creating Art that was a death mask of fashions buried everywhere else.
<name>Captain</name>	Captain	Clucas	[MASK], in company with some other sealers, had been on a raiding mission. They had rushed a mob of blacks on a beach, but only managed to seize a baby boy before being beaten back to their boat by the natives.
<name>The Chronicler</name>	The Chronicler	Pobjoy	What [MASK] doesn’t know is what I am about to write here, an annal of a life etched in blood. IV Before I began writing, I asked the King: ‘How might I commence such a mighty chronicle? By singing a new genesis?
<name>Deniehy</name>	Deniehy	Brady	[MASK] would bring to a divine justice the rats who dobbed, the convict constables who sold their mates out for a cosy billet, for all were depicted in the old Dane’s records as heroes, as worthy & respected convicts.
<name>The Surgeon</name>	The Surgeon	Castlereagh	The hog was of indeterminate breed & lived in a pen that adjoined the cottage. Even by the squalid standards of the island, [MASK]’s home was a festering, stinking horror of churned mud in which the Surgeon daily threw his slops & leftovers any convict would have happily scrabbled for.
<name>Christopher</name>	Christopher	Bugger	The last page I looked at lay at the wombat-hole entrance to the hut. It was even more irrelevant. ‘I said of laughter/ it read: ‘It is mad: & of mirth; what good doeth it?’ [MASK] all.
<name>he</name>	he	Pobjoy	He seemed impervious to the acrid stench of my quarters, my groans, far less the watery arguments I was cheerfully contriving out of every orifice in the forlorn hope he might leave. As [MASK] took some pleasure in pointing out to me, definitions belonged to the definer, not the defined.
<name>Napoleon</name>	Napoleon	Napoleon	The incongruous small squawks issuing out of that dark emptiness pronounced the Commandant as pleased as I was appalled, as if I had done a fine portrait of him as one of [MASK]’s marshals he had once so admired, rather than a painting of a lousy fish.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Brady	I intended first to paralyse the settlement by removing its basis of administration, the paper records of its invented history, the necessary fiction by which the reality of the prison-island was maintained. I had then determined I would find [MASK] & deliver these records to him.
<name>Truth</name>	Truth	Brady	[MASK] would free the rest, & a convict without a record would remain a free man, for it was clear to me now that it was these false words which enslaved us. Without them, who was to say which man was free & which man not?
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Goethe	The Commandant, who noticed this verse on an inspection tour the following day, was said to be so moved that a tear erupted out of an eye socket of the gold mask & trickled amber down its glowing side. [MASK]
<name>Orthonyx</name>	Orthonyx	Viz	[MASK]— The eggs of the Orthonyx temmincki (Spinetailed log-runner) are of an elliptical form, moderately glossy, & of a plain white colour. Three eggs measure respectively: 1.07 by .76; 1.13 by .8; 1.17 by .8.
<name>Aztlán</name>	Aztlán	Brady	To no longer care if I lived or died, far less found [MASK]. My supplies, my strength, my very life seemed spent in a quixotic mission that had come to nothing but utter disillusionment. My back spasmed, a mass of cruel knots ever more tightly tangled.
<name>Christ's</name>	Christ's	Maurepas	It was all that blood—of fish eyes & revolting slaves being torn apart & [MASK]’ nailed shoulders haemorrhaging & the blood in the machine breaker’s eyes after we drew the palliasse away—and it was my own fear at this cracked world in which I & they & everything was trapped.
<name>Napoleon</name>	Napoleon	Castlereagh	I saw [MASK] drunk on our rough rum, ever angrier, trotting up & down, up & down, wondering, in as far as drunk pigs may be said to be capable of active thought, when this maddening racket would halt.
<name>Reason</name>	Reason	Voltaire	As we started dancing the old Enlightenment & [MASK]’s smile of reason began building in her a slow wave waiting to break, I saw these things: on one wrist a large silver bangle, on the other a large unlanced boil. A cowfish staring.
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Pobjoy	I have to bow so low to get beneath [MASK] that I am almost blowing bubbles in the slimy rock pools at 4.6 our feet, disturbing my friends that cluster in the darkness there, the crabs & periwinkles & mussels that share this demimonde with me. ''
<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Sal	As she came around to the side of the fire closest to me, I saw that while dancing Twopenny [MASK] had been all the time feeding the fire with pages she was ripping with a great frenzy from the registers. The registers!
<name>Unknown</name>	Unknown	VIII	Then he slid to the ground, still talking, & I resumed daydreaming of new names & old loves. At some point later in the evening I realised he had been asleep on the floor for at least half an hour & I hadn’t noticed. [MASK]
<name>Gabriel</name>	Gabriel	Brady	I curled into a ball over which kangaroos & wombats & devils & dancers & hunters & the moon roamed in stories I had no way of understanding. In that serene dark of the beehive hut of feathers, covered in incomprehensible tales with [MASK]’s book of indigestible love at my side, I finally fell asleep.
<name>Guy Fawkes</name>	Guy Fawkes	Clucas	I did not then know that having fulfilled his part of a bargain in providing several dozen barrels of gunpowder, [MASK] had then been paid out in his own currency of death. But when I looked further up I did know, without seeing his face, the name of his murderer.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	MattBrady	Thought I: only a madman would open it. The book fell open in my outstretched hand, & there at the book’s front, written in what thought I a surprisingly childlike hand, was the name— [MASK]. Thought I: I can’t bear to read what follows.
<name>rum</name>	rum	Castlereagh	As he grunted with the effort of lifting, he contemplated his successful theft of [MASK] from his pen a short half hour earlier in the tumult of fire & mutiny, & never saw the swirl of angry hot wind that picked up the canvas ball at his feet & threw it dancing in the air.
<name>Max</name>	Max	Billyboy	[MASK]!’ & before I can say a word he’s thrown my painting of the stargazer into the dull ashes of Lempriere’s fire, & is off brightly yabbering again, saying, ‘We’ve got better work on our hands.’
<name>Jack Ketch</name>	Jack Ketch	Pobjoy	The hooks were only at elbow height, but it doesn’t take height to hang, only some rope & a strong will. They worried I might do the same & cheat the gallows, & so had me brought to this saltwater cell & put under the regime of [MASK].
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Boh	Walk with me, [MASK]! he yelled, then began his famous roaring & wailing. It was clear he was drunk, full as a fat girl’s blouse, & we all cheered & laughed, & his roars & wails rose with us, through us, beyond us.
<name>Kathleen</name>	Kathleen	Moinee	It was early winter. While over us brutal westerly winds cut across the island, in the tea-tree we had us our snug, warm & protected, close & holy as the night. Here we traded words. My favourite: [MASK].
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Robinson	[MASK] thought convicts scum, & was the type who would happily walk naked in front of you, so little opinion did he have of those he felt below him, as though you were a dog to be kicked or a chamber pot to be pissed in.
<name>Titivillus</name>	Titivillus	Pug	At his trial [MASK], committed for bestiality, had wrongly thought himself accused of sodomy. When asked by the judge what he had to say in his defence, he felt obliged to point out that it was not a ram but a ewe with which he had been caught.
<name>Flora</name>	Flora	Pobjoy	In my saltwater cell, under the cover of the convict-Constables, I determined I would repaint all the fish from memory, this time around adding to them these notes. [MASK] provided me with oils & canvas for my Constables, as well as the paper
<name>Bartleby</name>	Bartleby	Jorgensen	I smelt parchment, vellum, sour sweat, the decaying kidney scent of [MASK]. There was a dull heavy pain in my lower back that I took to be a corner of the bookcase resting on my body. Beyond, names were being yelled & answered.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Ackermann	Nor did I bother the Surgeon with tedious details now flooding my memory of the publican’s offensive behaviour there, pressuring [MASK] & me incessantly like some Eightways harpy about our tick, him would you believe with all his money planted away!
<name>Beckett</name>	Beckett	Jorgensen	Will that it is raining, but that doesn’t mean you continue standing in the rain. And so on. And while I accepted [MASK]’s argument that my miserable skin really didn’t deserve anything other than the most miserable death, I didn’t agree that I ought die there & then.
<name>Bullseye</name>	Bullseye	Pobjoy	‘Yes, absolutely,’ I replied, though it was less than easy to get all the words out with [MASK]’s fist & boot clattering around my teeth. ‘I would most respectfully have to say that I am.’
<name>Aleut</name>	Aleut	Clucas	She came to the boat & offered herself to them if the child could go back with the tribe. The sealers grabbed her. [MASK], taking hold of the boy by his legs, swung him against the rocks & beat his brains out.
<name>Toussaint</name>	Toussaint	Brady	?o s In which is recounted a most hold & audacious escape—The sled of thwarted memory—[MASK], an avenging angel—Return ofCapois "Death—Attacked by blacks—A murder—The funeral pyre. I
<name>Bristol</name>	Bristol	Frenchman	Ill The following morning, as I once more hung from the cell’s high barred window, gazing out, I avoided looking at the gibbet by focusing on the distant plumes of smoke that daily moved further outward from [MASK]’s Cap & closer to us.
<name>artifacts</name>	artifacts	Rubens	The endless river of money that had once flooded into the settlement dried up. The Commandant was forced to sell whatever he could, including a priceless collection of [MASK], to meet his ever greater debts with the Chinese pirates & Javanese usurers who had financed the hall’s construction.
<name>Fagin</name>	Fagin	Pobjoy	My poor arms could not hold even such miserable weight as I was any longer, & I fell back into the darkness of my cell while [MASK], as ever stooping to new lows, announced that he was seeking the return of the oil-paint set.
<name>Georges Cuvier</name>	Georges Cuvier	Lamarck	‘HOT RUM—YOUNG girl—OLD DOCTOR—CRUEL—cruel.’ He rattled on about a French botanist called [MASK] whose seven-volume Histoire naturelle des animaux sans vertbbrbs he described as a taxonomic tour deforce, & the infinite perfectibility of pigs through breeding.
<name>Barry</name>	Barry	O’Riordan	This only antagonised the Commandant all the more, because he knew all his soldiers to be feckless, cowardly Irish peasants, & it was evident [MASK] was even worse, being a feckless, cowardly, lying Irish peasant.
<name>Godot</name>	Godot	Pobjoy	I think [MASK] knows but chooses not to: it is my one recompense for the convict-Constable he takes from me each day. Or maybe he’s just worried about hitting his head if he raises it to look.
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Pobjoy	Hush! [MASK] is coming, the sea is rising, my wound is clotting, so just sit back & agree with the Russian convict that it’s all better in a book, that life is better observed than lived.
<name>Don Quixote</name>	Don Quixote	Jorgensen	She would have felt like me with books. Cheated. After all, it was reading all those romances & adventures as a young boy that had been the undoing of [MASK], making him think he could remake the world in the image of a book.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Brady	The island waits. For a final confrontation, a reckoning. In the face of [MASK]’s growing power, the increasingly unsettled, unruly nature of the convict population in consequence, & the unceasing black war, the settlers begin abandoning their farms & retreating into the larger towns.
<name>Korg</name>	Korg	Numminer	One was a tall man, & somewhat scabby. The other was of a shorter, stouter build. We could see they were angry. We never saw the spears they dragged along the ground, clenched between their toes. ‘[MASK]?
<name>Audubon</name>	Audubon	Audubon	[MASK] painted marriages, courting, all the vain pretence of polite society, & all of it was birds & all of his birds sold & it was all up a very clever thing that he was doing, a natural history of the new burghers.
<name>Byron</name>	Byron	Brady	I dreamt I spat onto the crazed sepia crust of kangaroo blood at the bottom of [MASK]’s ink pot, making a scarlet ink, the colour of a troubled dawn. Into that wet, dark demon I dipped the nib of an old quill with which
<name>Squanto</name>	Squanto	Towtereh	I witnessed their reunion. Both wept much & seemed greatly moved to be together again. Talking with [MASK], I found my own opinions of the savages changing, & I could no longer think of them as I formerly had.
<name>Merlin</name>	Merlin	Brady	[MASK] would tell me how this world might be turned upside down & once again made right, the way it once was, & the way it should be. Ill He came into the flaring circle of my fire early in the evening.
<name>God</name>	God	Pobjoy	Now my guts clench tighter than the dying machine breaker’s gob, I fear the lousy fish I paint, I have been shitting through the eye of a needle for the last four days, & today I did not have a single solid turd to toss at [MASK] when he visited.
<name>Wilbur</name>	Wilbur	Castlereagh	[MASK] had somehow managed to roll them under the fence & into his pen with his front trotters, whereupon he had smashed them open & drunk their potent contents. I looked at the pig. The pig opened its eyes & looked at me.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	VI	He was extending his arm. He was reaching toward me. With the back of his fingers, on my cheek & lips, he was touching me. [MASK] His hand fell from my face, & I sat down on the earth with them around their fire.
<name>Turnkey</name>	Turnkey	Pobjoy	For a man who has always prided himself on his absence of physical strength & who had moreover been confined in a cell only an arm-span wide for several months surviving on slops thrown him by [MASK], this was no mean feat.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Rubens	In the meantime, if I didn’t mind, I was to knock up a few copies of [MASK] from a book of etchings. During this time the fortunes of the island changed. The endless river of money that had once flooded into the settlement dried up.
<name>Lena</name>	Lena	Gould	I looked at her & then I couldn’t look at her, & so I looked at the ash-strewn, dance-scuffed ground. ‘[MASK], you come,’ said she. I kicked my toes into the dirt, felt myself shuddering & swallowing.
<name>Godfrey</name>	Godfrey	Brady	Though I fought & thrashed, still I continued sinking. My thoughts were galloping far away, transforming into bubbles racing upwards, so many confused questions that could never be answered. Was [MASK]’s Army of Light laying siege & demolishing the building in which I was held with cannon fire?
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name in the given context)	unknown (There is no proper name in the given context)	Gould	‘I will personally flog your back until there’s nothing left & the cat’s tails are sticking out the other side tickling your tits.’ He snorted snot from his nose back down his throat & from his great height gobbed on me. ‘Are you such a half-wit, [MASK]?’
<name>Babe</name>	Babe	Castlereagh	He tried to feign an oblivious air to their imagined derision, but would every so often crack & start yelling back. Then he would look vti weary with the demands scientifick respectability was placing upon him & would glance fondly, almost coquettishly across at the pig yard where [MASK] was asleep in the muddiest corner.
<name>Stargazer</name>	Stargazer	VI	[MASK] In different ways does the Devil present & never one easily reducible to illustration. My work was becoming increasingly frustrating & it seemed only appropriate that the evocative & luminous name ‘stargazer’ would suggest to my mind a fish entirely different from that which the fishing gang one morning presented me to paint.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Pobjoy	VI Do you think I was only gaoled? I wished to cry out as she turned to leave & rapped thrice on the door for [MASK] to come & open—for I too was the gaoler. Do you think to keep my own hide unflogged I never lied?
<name>Friday</name>	Friday	Pobjoy	It was one of three slightly larger cells on the other side of the island to the main settlement, & I could have been almost happy with my imminent demise if it hadn’t been for [MASK], who at that point took it upon himself to interrupt my splendid solitude.
<name>George Washington</name>	George Washington	Towtereh	Moreover he was a true patriot, whose profound love of his country seemed undeniable. I painted [MASK] as a man of dignity, a portrait which for a single, very obvious reason, has no place in a book of fish.
<name>police</name>	police	Castlereagh	She would make a great deal of noise, somewhere between a Van Diemonian devil screeching at night & a stampede, which was both pleasing & frightening because it meant we ran the risk of being caught, even with [MASK] carolling away in the background.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	GOULD	His sister revealed as fake as her brother, his nation ash, the Commandant threw away his scented towel & inhaled so deeply of that great tumbling acridity of [MASK] S BOOK OF FISH fumes that he found himself retching.
<name>laser</name>	laser	CAT	When I managed to persuade the museum to run tests on the parchment and inks and paints, carbon date and even [MASK] scan the book page by page, they admitted all the materials and techniques seemed authentic to the period.
<name>Octavia</name>	Octavia	Lice	[MASK] crawling up her arm & onto a cowfished breast; this sight of one body ceding to others, of the inevitable advance of death & at the same time its transformation into new life, struck me as terrible & wonderful. Nothing was reconciled: everything was beautiful.
<name>Chris</name>	Chris	VT	At first he was going to [MASK] kill himself) after a time he instead resolved to escape the following summer. He had fled with a party of six several weeks before; they had split when the last of their food ran out.
<name>John Langan</name>	John Langan	Gould	Or perhaps only my joy in the glorious wonder of all that [MASK] wrote and painted explains my subsequent decision to rewrite the Book o/Fish, a book in which there is no popular interest nor academic justification nor financial reward, nothing really, save the folly of a sorry passion.
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Pobjoy	Then [MASK] was weeping, saying he always had bad luck, he had bad luck being pressed into the army, then worse luck being sent to such a dismal outpost as this, & worst luck of all being made guard idiots like me.
<name>Jacob</name>	Jacob	Pobjoy	I can offer no argument—after all, what, other than [MASK]’s pottage, have my fish ever won me? I just tried to get him to leave as quickly as possible so that I might get back to my work.
<name>John</name>	John	Keats	Outside, [MASK] paid no heed to such argument, declaiming: ‘Their bad flowers have no scent, their birds no sweet song.’ ‘A men of the on-ore,’ the aggrieved Audubon was shouting, ‘and shell pay—if cursed.’
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Ton	‘[MASK] will be but one of an infinite parade of the broken dead, another mutilated shade, condemned to live amidst the sickening stench of putridflesh, all youfalsifiers covered in loathsome scabs & each other's sloughing flesh.' With these words he gave the flat of the sword a good shove.
<name>Caesar</name>	Caesar	Veni	Warming to my idea, I put it to the King that this question of roads marks the fundamental divide between the ancient Greek & Roman civilisations. You make a straight road like the Romans & you are lucky to get three words: [MASK], vidi, vici.
<name>Success</name>	Success	Hope	They had wanted of me consolation, & this was desolation. The latent violence, the manic vision: I had got none of it. They had wanted [MASK] & Progress, & to my horror I saw sullenly staring back at me—a stargazer\
<name>Fredrick</name>	Fredrick	Pobjoy	Until that point I had thought the self-interest of [MASK] & his need for a continuing supply of convict-Constables might make common cause with my desire to live. Quite the opposite: he calmly told me that my impending execution no longer disturbed him.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Tracker	An earhole burning with a soft yellow flame like a tallow lamp. I heard a yelp & looked down to see one of the wretched dogs attempting to race off with the hand that had dropped from [MASK]’s corpse onto me & from there to the ground.
<name>Vivaldi</name>	Vivaldi	Vivaldi	Even the owner stayed huddled over a small bar radiator at the far end of his domain, his back turned to me, surreptitiously slipping off that vile anthem of contemporary retailing, [MASK]’s Four Seasons, and putting on the comforting low rubato of the races, a golden slipper of sound.
<name>Gregor</name>	Gregor	Jorgensen	But I saw nothing. This immense weight of inanimate matter that seemed to be so important to [MASK] was for me a smothering blindfold I needed to be freed of. I feared it, the way it would kill me if I did not find a way to escape it.
<name>Nat</name>	Nat	Robinson	He seemed not reconciled to what he did, nor yet was he hostile. In his words, [MASK]’s party was simply a mob to travel with, but it was not his land through which he travelled, & though he was a black, they were not his people.
<name>Cortez</name>	Cortez	Robinson	[MASK] treated the savages as though they were his entourage, & the savages treated him like he was one of the many stray dogs they picked up on their travels. Neither seemed to notice the earth falling away beneath them as a breaking wave.
<name>God</name>	God	Gould	My desire was only ever to make a vessel—however crude—in which all [MASK]’s fish might be returned to the sea. But I must confess to a growing ache within, for these days I am no longer sure what is memory and what is revelation.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Heslop	When I presented [MASK] with the latest set of bones for cataloguing, he was annoyed. By gesture he made it clear that he thought he had finished with the bones of the dead blacks & would be able to return to the more congenial cataloguing of plants & flowers.
<name>Ernest</name>	Ernest	Audubon	I would only have two fish: each alone, fearful, united solely in the terror of death I see in their eyes. [MASK] painted the dreams of a new country for which there is always a prospective purchaser; my fish are the nightmare of the past for which there is no market.
