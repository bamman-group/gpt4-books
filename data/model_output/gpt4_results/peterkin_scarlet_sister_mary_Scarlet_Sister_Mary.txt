<name>Dorothy</name>	Dorothy	Mary	[MASK] answered as politely as she could that the rooster had flapped his wings and crowed three times at the door, so she knew somebody was coming. She had changed her clothes to look decent to meet her visitor.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Doll	When she ran into the shed room he paid no heed to her until he heard a strange fuss. He got there just in time to see [MASK] grab up every bit of the rations and throw them out of the win- dow into the yard.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Mary	I ain’ gwine let you get away wid any such-a doins in my house. No. I’m gwine lick you haf to death. You wait!” A good long sleep calmed [MASK]’s anger, and the morning light showed that the girl-child was the prettiest one of the babies.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Andrew	Si May-e. Le me fill em fo you.” And she handed him her pipe, making a wry face. “I ruther smell a pole-cat, Cun [MASK].” “Me too, but don’ blame me, gal.
<name>Priscilla</name>	Priscilla	Mary	[MASK] stepped silently inside the door, then halted a minute to let her heart slow down a little, for a delicious suspense which was almost like fear had it thumping hard in her breast. Her wind was short, her breathing hurried, and her blood running fast and hot.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Unex	[MASK] was her heart-string. If l>e died she could not, could not bear it. He lay gazing at her, his big pitiful eyes asking dumbly for help. She must not let him see how sad she felt, that would be against him.
<name>John</name>	John	July	A strong man’s hand can fall heavy, and the best way to deal with strength is to be weak and helpless. She was not able to fight with [MASK]. It was better to knuckle to him any day.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Andrew	A strange power seized her and held her and she spoke with a new, quickened tongue. Instead of looking first at one deacon, then at another she hardly took her eyes from [MASK]’s face and he gazed back at her spellbound, with his eyes as bright as stars.
<name>Melinda</name>	Melinda	Mary	She was not a member of any lodge or society or church, and she had a right to live her own life as she liked. He defended everything she did. He declared that except for his own mother, [MASK] was the best woman on the plantation.
<name>Josephine</name>	Josephine	Cinder	[MASK] sat down carefully, spreading out the fine rustling cloth of her black silk skirt. She was dressed in the finest of clothes. Gold was in her front teeth, and her cheeks were covered with a dust of white powder which made her look pale and strange.
<name>Essie</name>	Essie	Cinder	[MASK]’s pan was empty and she got up to go. But she paused at the door. “I hear-say you got a baby, Si May-e.” “I sho is, de finest lil boy-chile ever was.
<name>Nora</name>	Nora	Mary	She smoked a pipeful and laid her pipe on the hearth and settled herself with folded arms to sleep a little. She had hardly dozed when something roused [MASK]. She opened her eyes and peered through the dim light at her two babies. They were sound asleep.
<name>Leslie</name>	Leslie	Doll	The way she did made him hot all over and he all but slapped her then, but he didn’t. He just told her to pull in her lip and keep it pulled in. Then, [MASK] jumped up and said he had better pull in his own.
<name>Teacake</name>	Teacake	July	I fretted haf to death—I couldn’ sleep—neither eat—I got po as a snake. I sure did love dat low-down [MASK]. I did. Same like you love some strange man yonder to town.”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	July	It was early, but her head ached and her heart was fluttering like a bird. She lay still in the dark, nursing her new grief with burning tears while the street rang with merriment. Everybody was welcoming [MASK], everybody was rejoicing to see him back home again.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	June	Holding the tiny bag tight, she rested her fingers on his shoulder. “[MASK],” she said in a voice that was husky and low, “please don’ go. Seems like if you was to leave home, I couldn’ hardly stand it.”
<name>Si</name>	Si	July	“You ain’ know me—Si May-e? Is you forgot you [MASK]?” he asked gently. He stood waiting for her to speak, holding his hands out to her— almost like a child. She looked at his face.
<name>John</name>	John	July	Where were [MASK]’s senses that he stood asking her what to do when a rain was almost on them. He soon had the cabin closed tight, but it was filled with an awkward silence that marked the heavy rolling thunder.
<name>Emmeline</name>	Emmeline	Mary	She smiled and drew in the cool air stealthily through her nostrils. A strange smell came with it. It was not one of the children who stood there in the door. No! [MASK] tried to lean a little and see without being seen. It was a stranger.
<name>Ona</name>	Ona	Mary	[MASK] was heavy, but many tasks to be done kept her days filled from morning until night. A woman who is about to bear a child has a strangely good hand for planting seed; something magic in her touch makes the seed sprout quickly and grow fast and mature in half the regular time.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	July	Then the air hummed with laughter and [MASK] came forward and took her by the arm and smiled down into her eyes. What a splendid fellow he was. So tall. So well-made. His teeth were as white as a hound’s.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	July	Her waist was certainly bulging before its time. If she had not danced she would have been turned out when her child was born. [MASK] laughed when he noticed her growth, and warned her to have a boy-child. No girl-child for him.
<name>Zora</name>	Zora	Mary	He showed that the conjure rag had laid its heavy spell on him without tarrying. The red rooster stepped out in front of the steps and called the hens to make haste and come see some fine tasty thing he had found. [MASK] knew he was fooling them, playing a trick on them.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	July	Men are strange things. The best and the strongest are weak as water when a charm gets to working on them. But [MASK] was satisfied to stay at home most nights and he seemed to care less about pleasuring himself.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Mary	The stillness was peaceful except when merry laughter drifted in from the cotton-pickers. Contentment filled the world as [MASK] went about her tasks, humming low to herself so as not to wake the baby, stopping now and then to look at him as he slept.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Ben	“No, I ain’ cussed em nuttin. Whoever say I cussed all de deacons Friday night—whoever say sich a ting is a—a---” [MASK]’s voice was too hoarse to be shrill, and it broke into a fierce squeak.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Mary	Some of the people hummed snatches of hymn tunes as they walked home. Some of the sinners were whistling. A thin yellow moon had risen above the trees that rimmed the fields, and its light fell clear on the earth as [MASK] stepped carefully down the rickety steps out into the yard.
<name>Emmeline</name>	Emmeline	Mary	“I wish I was dead,” [MASK] faltered. “No, you don’t, neither. You don’ wish no such a thing. It’s a sin to say so, too. Sposen you was to die, who’d raise Unex?
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Mary	His wet coat and breeches clung tight to his body and he seemed to have no breath left for speaking. The door swung wide open, pushed back by the wind, and [MASK]’s hands shook so she could hardly shut and bar it again.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Mary	She patted him softly, gently while he slept peacefully through the great full-throated waves of sound. Where was her July now ? [MASK]’s heart ached bitterly. It lay heavy and slow-beating in her breast, weighing her whole body dowrn.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Cinder	“De chimney got broke, but de fire gives plenty of light. Me an’ July don’ set up late.” [MASK]’s round eyes narrowed a little. “It’s awful bad luck for a lamp chimney to break, enty?”
<name>Essie</name>	Essie	Mary	You got em all worried in his mind an’ fretted half to death right now. Is you call dat bein a Christian?” “What you got to say ’bout dem poor nameless chillen you got?” [MASK] leaned back and laughed.
<name>Henrietta</name>	Henrietta	Mary	He crowed every hour in the day to tell the time, then at midnight and again at dawn. No clock could have been better, but whenever he came up to the door and flapped his wings three times and crowed, [MASK] might as well stop and get ready for company.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Mary	Finally [MASK] got tired of questioning them. “Git on back to bed. I too vexed to fool wid yunnuh. To-morrow I’m gwine to get up an’ lick all-two. I ain’ gwine let you get away wid any such-a doins in my house.
<name>They</name>	They	Andrew	Yet those children discounted him and plagued him, and laughed at him because he couldn’t run them down and catch them and beat hell out of them. [MASK] had no right to be unmannerable to him. Not a bit.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Andrew	She liked to watch [MASK]’s big hands ruling the hot metal and molding it into a pattern. The rumbling boom of his deep voice was pleasant. His skin was as smooth and black as her own and in spite of his height and bulk he moved as easily as a cat.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Mary	Yes, you is!” His hand reached out and touched her shoulder, but [MASK] drew away and she felt her lips curling proudly, even if they did tremble. “I might be ain’ changed on de outside, but I sho is changed on de inside.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Andrew	How can you stand a coal fire? It stinks worse’n a blunt tail moccasin to me.” [MASK]’s eyes twinkled but his voice was grave. “You better smoke you pipe whilst you’s here. Si May-e. Le me fill em fo you.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	July	Sinners were required to take the back seats. But she liked to sit where she could see everybody who came in the door, or who stood outside in the yard. [MASK] might get home tonight. He may have been left by mistake some- how.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Ben	[MASK]’s being turned out of the church was not anything new, but for him to take it so hard certainly was. He had never been so upset before. He was more upset than he ought to be, as many times as he had experienced falling from grace.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	July	“Whe is Unex, Si May-e? Maybe de boy what you had fo me would like to see his Daddy. E use to love me.” “Unex is gone, [MASK]. E went off and left me de same as you done.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Auntie	“I’m gwine to settle down. [MASK], soon as I birth dis same child.” “I hope so, honey. I hope so. But you ought to settle down hefo de time comes to birth dat child. You stays too wild an’ wicked.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	June	She wanted him to give her sympathy, but he was so steady, so clear-seeing she strove to be good-mannered. She slipped a hand through his big arm next to her and leaned her cheek against his shoulder, but [MASK] turned his face away and moved his body uneasily.
<name>Si</name>	Si	Mary	He picked up his suitcase and walked away. “Who dat. Si May-e? Who dat?” the children asked curiously as soon as he was out of hearing. [MASK] sucked her teeth and grunted.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	July	His eyes looked like corn-liquor eyes. “Come lay down on de bed. Le me put a wet rag on you head, [MASK]. Dat’ll make you feel more better. When de rain stops I’ll get a collard leaf an’ tie on em.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	July	“No.” “[MASK] is a case, a heavy case.” Then the kindly voices fell back into talk about the excursion to town. The same talk had run steadily through the whole day. That excursion yesterday was the best excursion ever run.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	July	She tried to do that. This morning she was up ahead of the morning star, fixing hot coffee and bread for [MASK] before he went off with the crowd. But he swallowed it down and hurried off with hardly as much as, “Thank you.”
<name>Essie</name>	Essie	Budda	“Home, I tell you—I got to go home.” She tried to stand up, but [MASK] pulled her hack. “Pray right here, Si May-e. You’ll get trompled on sho as you try to get to dat mourner’s bench.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Yunnuh	“Mind, honey, don’ forget an’ shake you foot to-night. Foolishness ain’ no place for a child o God. I’m sorry to see you gwine in de company of all dem sinners. [MASK] ought to go straight on home.”
<name>Miss</name>	Miss	Si	You ought to be happy and smilin, enty?” She said it as softly, as gently as she could, smiling as woman smiles when she knows her power. He shook his head gloomily. “I has a lot o trouble, [MASK] May-e.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Mary	All the members in good standing took places up in front, close to the fire, but the sinners had to sit wherever they could find room, back against the wall or on the steps outside. [MASK] sat back with the sinners.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Auntie	You an’ [MASK] an’ de baby is all I got left in de world.” “You would have you way, enty? Now, you want evybody to be sorry fo you. You ought to be shame.
<name>Granny</name>	Granny	Mary	She never slept in any bed but her own. Whenever she stayed from home at night she sat by the fire and nodded and smoked without even taking off her shoes. [MASK] and the new-born babies were in the big room bed.
<name>John</name>	John	Unex	Then a day would come when he must pass on, and other people would live in this old house, while she and [MASK] would be lying yonder in the graveyard where the pines rose tall and dark over graves that sheltered so many homeless bones.
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Andrew	whe you was. Do keep quiet. When you git ready, you can pray an’ seek an’ find peace an’ jine de church again. If I was you I wouldn’ let my mind run on [MASK] no more.
<name>Stanley</name>	Stanley	July	“Don’ put you hand on me again, [MASK]! Don’ touch me! Take you money an’ go. Get out o my yard. Me an’ my chillen don’ want not a brownie you got! Not one.”
<name>God</name>	God	Gawd	e gwine crave some new ’oman alto-gedder. [MASK] made mens so. It don’ pay to love no one man too much. It’s all right to like em. But don’ never let yousef tink on one man all de time.
<name>Mahalia</name>	Mahalia	Mary	I’d be on de floor myself if de misery in my crippled knee would let go a minute. But it’s got me hamstrung. I can’ hardly lift my right hand foot off de ground.” [MASK] shook her head no. She was too sad to rejoice.
<name>Otherwise</name>	Otherwise	Lord	Not a soul had been shot. Nobody got cut with a razor. The one man bent on starting a row got pushed clean off the boat. A good thing, too. [MASK], town had a fine restaurant. The fish there tasted too good.
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Gawd	What you mean? You wouldn’ send me away, not after I come all dis way to see you. I been comin four days to git here. Stand still and lemme look at you good. I swear to [MASK], you ain’ hardly changed.”
<name>Rabbits</name>	Rabbits	Larks	[MASK] hopped about the fields and in the roads; doves mourned tenderly; squirrels chased each other up and down trees. / Hens cackled up and down the length of the street telling of new-laid eggs, and cocks cackled back in loud encouragement.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	July	Is you hear me?” If [MASK] would only have sat still long enough for her to talk to him, she could have made up with him, but as soon as he ate, he got his hat and left the house.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	July	[MASK]’s been gone a long time. I don’ know whe e is, an’ I don’ care. But if de boat yonder on de river would fetch em home to-day, cold an’ stiff in a box, I could look at em same as if e was a stranger.
<name>Camille</name>	Camille	Mary	The passing years made no difference to the spirit of her youth. The Quarter women could dream their bad dreams and talk of good and evil as much as they liked; they made no differ- ence to [MASK]. Hard work had kept her lean and hard-muscled.
<name>Oyuki</name>	Oyuki	Mary	A light breeze full of summer softness floated in from the rice-fields and, snatching at the strong sweet smoke [MASK] pulled out of her pipe, swept it away, then climbed up and whirled some of the yellow tassels down from the trees.
<name>Tea Cake</name>	Tea Cake	July	“Git up off dat floor, May-e,” [MASK] shouted, and she pretended to do her best, then fell back down like something hamstrung, crying weakly all the time. “What de matter ail you?” he stormed.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Mary	“My soul be on thy guard Ten thousand foes arise,” The weight of dismay in [MASK]’s heart made her knees shaky. Tears burned her eyelids. “The hosts of sin are pressing hard To draw thee from the skies.”
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Cinder	I didn’ know you was home an’ when my eyes first fell on you, I thought right at first, you might be a sperit.” “No, gal, I sho ain’ no sperit. Dis is de same old mean [MASK] a-walkin in de flesh.”
<name>Tea Cake</name>	Tea Cake	July	Then the necklace seemed suddenly hateful. She unhooked it and started to throw it into the fire but [MASK] stopped her. “Go put em in de trunk and keep em in de trunk lessen I tell you to take em out. Is you hear me?”
<name>Lucinda</name>	Lucinda	Seraphine	[MASK] is a sensible gal. E do wear shoes lately fo-true, by e got such a awful splinter in e heel de last time e danced barefeeted. But e skin is black in’ e teeth is solid as my own.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Mary	[MASK] saw how his black eyes deepened as they fell on her with a hard fixed gaze trying to make out why she had come. His grimy woolen shirt was open across his broad breast, and his sleeves were rolled up high, showing his powerful, brawny arms.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	July	She stayed in bed, while [MASK] waited on her and cooked for her and washed her face and tended to her as though she were a baby. He thought she was crippled, and he could not bear for anybody to know he had done it.
<name>Ulysses</name>	Ulysses	Unex	Hot meal gruel made with milk would strengthen him. He was too big to go without victuals; he must swallow some down whether he felt like it or not. But [MASK] craved no food, he wanted cool spring water, not sweetened water / or hot table tea.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	July	At the top of the hill she turned to look back at the hazy blue world lying so far away over the river. [MASK] had been out there and had overcome all kinds of danger and seen all kinds of places, all kinds of women.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Mary	It was a beautiful reading, and with the lightning flashing and the thunder crashing outside it sounded so solemn it reached clear down to the bottom of [MASK]’s heart. “Though you sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.”
<name>Tempy</name>	Tempy	Budda	Then she thought of the Big House with glass windows all over it and all kinds of glass inside; looking-glasses and chandeliers hung with hundreds of pieces of glass. Lightning had never struck it, and it had stood there a hundred years. “No use to fret, [MASK].”
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Mary	“Whe you gwine?” [MASK] asked him timidly. He waited a minute; then he asked, “How-come you got to know evywhe I go, here lately? I’m gwine whe I’m gwine. Dat’s whe I’m gwine.”
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Mary	He hobbled ahead of her toward the back of the cabin where a rickety hand-split clapboard fence enclosed a small yard. Taking down the props of the hingeless gate, he showed [MASK] six straw-necked pullets and a young cockerel.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Unex	She raised up and tears fell on her breast for her head was still bent low. [MASK]’s soul must have climbed high by this time for he was young and strong. To-day he would stand before his Maker.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Mary	A soft wind stirred and the old hackberry tree scattered bright yellow leaves over them, and [MASK]’s full skirts billowed around her. Her shiny new shoes squeaked proudly with every step, while grunts and exclamations of approval sounded on every side.
<name>he</name>	he	June	Instead of smiling at him, she leaned over and wiped her wet face with her petticoat, then took the cup of sweetened water [MASK] offered her and sipped it slowly, one small taste at a time. Without looking up she knew that all the people were staring at her watching every move she made.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	July	A few people had come by to speak to her this morning, but she knew they had come to see how she took [MASK]’s going and she didn’t encourage them to stay and talk. If she had the heart, she would go away and leave everything, everybody.
<name>John</name>	John	July	The others were the fruit of eye-love, the children of her flesh, yet they were strong and hearty; and her joy-child, her first-born, her jewel, [MASK]’s son, was gone. Grief smothered her.
<name>Mammy</name>	Mammy	nervish	She was dressed in the finest of clothes. Gold was in her front teeth, and her cheeks were covered with a dust of white powder which made her look pale and strange. She was [MASK] too. Her hands acted tremblish and her face had a twist-mouth look.
<name>Mother</name>	Mother	Mary	Then she flew to the wood-pile and got the ax and gave the big iron wash-pot one awful lick. The poor thing pure bellowed when the ax hit it, for a great hole broke in its side. [MASK] was shocked sure enough now.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Mary	Children were playing games in the dusk, shouting, singing, screaming out when the one who was “booger-man” ran out from a hiding-place to catch somebody, but [MASK]’s mind was too full of something else to notice them.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Seraphine	[MASK] looked up, and a pitiful smile flitted over her lips. “It don’ pay to love mens too much, gal. When a man finds out fo-true a ’oman is crazy bout em, he don’ crave dat ’oman no mo.
<name>Geordie</name>	Geordie	Keepsie	one from the land, one from the sea, tried to rule the coming day. The children were huddled in a corner, weeping softly, except [MASK], who had forgotten his new crutches and went hopping about on his one leg.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Presently	[MASK] he came back smiling and poured her out a cup of tea from another one of the several pots boiling on the hearth. “Drink dis, honey. It’ll do you all de good whilst I fix you someting to try.
<name>Elisenda</name>	Elisenda	Mary	A bad-luck sound. [MASK] got up quickly and put the shovel in the fire to stop it. People have to rule owls. She would learn to rule herself and her feelings, too. She would not let another tear fall out of her eyes.
<name>Essie</name>	Essie	Mary	[MASK] counted them again. Ten scarlet stripes were there. “You had nine chillen, enty, Si May-e?” She had. “All was born in sin, enty?” She bowed her head low. But she had only nine children.
<name>She</name>	She	Doll	E got de finest man ever was for a husband, a lot o nice chillen, a good home, an’ clothes, an’ plenty to eat. What more could heart wish? [MASK] must be gone out e head if e ain’ satisfy wid all dat.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Mary	Maybe a little goat had gone under the house out of the storm. There it was again. What was it ? The old woman went to the corner; the sound seemed there, behind the organ. She didn’t feel comfortable close to that organ. Why did [MASK] have it?
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	Misery filled his dull red-rimmed eyes. His high-pitched outbursts of fury were pitiful. [MASK] begged him to be quiet, not to make himself sick. Ranting could do no good in the world; what was done was done.
<name>Wang</name>	Wang	July	The great black iron rice pot began a hoarse clanging as its bottom was scraped to get the last white grain. The couple’s health and happiness were drunk over and over until [MASK] complained that his head was swimming round and round. He was ready to go home.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Auntie	“Sorry for me, [MASK]? How-come so? I’m heavy fo-true, but I’m well. I don’ mean to brag, but birthin a baby ain’ no trouble to me. It don’ even gi me a backache.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	July	One of the children was tipping up the steps, getting ready to jump at her and scare her; an old game of [MASK]’s. She’d be ready. She put the pan on the table and crept softly along the wall till she reached the door, then she eased behind it and stood waiting--
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Cinder	[MASK] asked with a dry little laugh. “You jumped all over when you seed me.” “No,—no,—you just make me feel surprise. I didn’ know you was home an’ when my eyes first fell on you, I thought right at first, you might be a sperit.”
<name>Si</name>	Si	Unex	“Wha’ you gwine to do, Si May-e?” She lay speechless. “Prayin is all de hope you got so pray wid-out ceastin until dem stripes come clean and you soul gets white as snow.” The grave melted, [MASK] was gone.
<name>Emmy</name>	Emmy	Emma	It was not little [MASK] that got her so poorly, but a fever. First a night fever, then an inward fever gnawed steadily at her insides and gave her no rest day or night. He bought that same fireless bottle for her
