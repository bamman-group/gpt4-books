<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Zaphod	“Who said that?” “Will you open up the exit hatch, please, computer?” said [MASK], trying not to get angry. “Not until whoever said that owns up,” urged the computer, stamping a few synapses closed.
<name>Deep Thought</name>	Deep Thought	Lunkwill	“I am simply the second greatest computer in the Universe of Space and Time.” “But the second?” insisted [MASK]. “Why do you keep saying the second? You’re surely not thinking of the Multicorticoid Perspicutron Titan Muller, are you?
<name>Ford</name>	Ford	Ford	he waved at where it had been. There was a potted plant there now. “But where are we?” said [MASK], who was sitting on the spiral staircase, a nicely chilled Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster in his hand.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Arthur	[MASK] glanced around him once more, and then down at himself, at the sweaty disheveled clothes he had been lying in the mud in on Thursday morning. “I seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my life-style,” he muttered to himself.
<name>Trillian</name>	Trillian	Ford	They all shook their heads. “Oh well,” he said, and stood up. For a moment, nothing happened. Then, after a second or so, nothing continued to happen. [MASK] peered through the thick smoke that was billowing out of the burning computer.
<name>James</name>	James	Zaphod	They slashed sheets of water hissing into the air, carved deep gashes in the sea which swayed crazily and sank back foaming in the boat’s wake as it careered across the bay. [MASK] loved effect: it was what he was best at.
<name>Deep Thought</name>	Deep Thought	Lunkwill	“We are quite definitely here as representatives of the Amalgamated Union of Philosophers, Sages, Luminaries and Other 171 Thinking Persons, and we want this machine off, and we want it off now\" “What’s the problem?” said [MASK].
<name>Aphrodite</name>	Aphrodite	Zaphod	Chapter 29 2 aphod! Wake up!” “Mmmmmwwwwwerrrr?” “Hey, come on, wake up.’ “Just let me stick to what I’m good at, yeah?” muttered [MASK], and rolled away from the voice back to sleep.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Arthur	[MASK] tried to gauge the speed at which they were traveling, but the blackness outside was absolute and he was denied any reference points. The sense of motion was so soft and slight he could almost believe they were hardly moving at all.
<name>Ford</name>	Ford	Arthur	“Look,” said [MASK], “would it save you a lot of time if I just gave up and went mad now?” For a while the aircar flew on in awkward silence. Then the old man tried patiently to explain.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Trillian	This above all appeared to [MASK] to be genuinely stupid, but she could no longer be bothered to argue about it. She sighed and punched up a star map on the visiscreen so she could make it simple for him, whatever his reasons for wanting it to be that way.
<name>The Prophet</name>	The Prophet	Ford	“Are you serious, sir?” he said in a small whisper which had the effect of silencing the pub. “You think the world’s going to end?” “Yes,” said [MASK]. “But, this afternoon.”
<name>Slartibartfast</name>	Slartibartfast	Trillian	“Yes,” agreed [MASK], and looked at him quizzically. “That’s one big whack of Improbability to be accounted for. Something pretty improbable has got to 101 show up on the balance sheet if it’s all going to add up into a pretty sum.”
<name>Hal</name>	Hal	Trillian	They had swung round now on to a direct homing course so that all that could be seen of them now was the warheads, head-on. “As a matter of interest,” said [MASK], “what are we going to do?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Arthur	[MASK], struggling through his third pint, looked round at him. “Why? What, no ... should I have?” He had given up being surprised, there didn’t seem to be any point any longer.
<name>the protagonist</name>	the protagonist	Ford	He didn’t sound hopeful. “Resistance is useless!” bellowed the guard. “Just don’t say things like that,” stammered [MASK]. “How can anyone maintain a positive mental attitude if you’re saying things like that?”
<name>Bernard</name>	Bernard	Arthur	They’ve got a page for people like you.” “Drink up.” “Why three pints all of a sudden?” “Muscle relaxant, you’ll need it.” “Muscle relaxant?” “Muscle relaxant.” [MASK] stared into his beer.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Arthur	[MASK] discovered to his embarrassment that he was lying curled up in a small ball on the floor with his arms wrapped round his head. He smiled weakly. “Charming man,” he said. “I wish I had a daughter so I could forbid her to marry one ...”
<name>Dr. Frankenstein</name>	Dr. Frankenstein	Arthur	[MASK] thought about this for a second, and then his face cleared. “Ah no,” he said, “I see the source of the misunderstanding now. No, look, you see what happened was that we used to do experiments on them.
<name>Maverick</name>	Maverick	Arthur	“ ‘And the sweet silver song of the lark. ’ ... Revised impact time fifteen seconds, fellas__‘Walk on through the wind The missiles banked round in a screeching arc and plunged back in pursuit. “This is it,” said [MASK], watching them.
<name>the host</name>	the host	Trillian	He heard the silence and glanced around at everyone. “Oh!” he said, with sudden realization. “Oh, I’m sorry, I wasn’t quite prepared for ...” “Let me introduce you,” said [MASK].
<name>Ford</name>	Ford	Arthur	“The suspense is killing me,” said [MASK] testily. Stress and nervous tension are now serious social problems in all parts of the Galaxy, and it is in order that this situation should not be in any way exacer- 121 bated that the following facts will now be revealed in advance.
<name>Professor</name>	Professor	Slartibartfast	A tall Magrathean man was standing in front of them. “The mice will see you now,” he said. Chapter 30 So there you have it,” said [MASK], making a feeble and perfunctory attempt to clear away some of the appalling mess of his study.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Arthur	“Good grief,” said [MASK], “is this really the interior of a flying saucer?” Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz heaved his unpleasant green body round the control bridge. He always felt vaguely irritable after demolishing populated planets.
<name>Marvin</name>	Marvin	Marvin	“Life,” said [MASK] dolefully, “loathe it or ignore it, you can’t like it.” The ground had caved in where the whale had hit it, revealing a network of galleries and passages, now largely obstructed by collapsed rubble and entrails.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Arthur	“With a flashlight.” “Ah, well, the lights had probably gone.” “So had the stairs.” “But look, you found the notice, didn’t you?” “Yes,” said [MASK], “yes I did.
<name>Ford</name>	Ford	Zaphod	“You don’t mean to say you’ve been on that miserable little planet as well, do you?” “No, of course not,” said [MASK] breezily. “Well, I 107 may have just dropped in briefly, you know, on my way somewhere ..
<name>Kirk</name>	Kirk	Zaphod	Someone from the dead planet was talking to them. “Computer!” shouted [MASK]. “Hi there!” “What the photon is it?” “Oh, just some five-million-year-old tape that’s being broadcast at us.”
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Marvin	He called to [MASK], who crawled up the slope making a big show of being lame, which he wasn’t. “On second thoughts,” said the old man, “leave it here. You must come with me. Great things are afoot.”
<name>Trillian</name>	Trillian	Slartibartfast	No one in the room remarked on his peculiar arrival, which is hardly surprising as he wasn’t there. He began to realize that the whole experience was merely a recorded projection which knocked six-track seventy-millimeter into a cocked hat. The room was much as [MASK] had described it.
<name>Bertie</name>	Bertie	Ford	[MASK] had recovered himself. He was at his flippest. “Yes,” he said gaily, “in less than two minutes I would estimate.” The barman couldn’t believe this conversation he was having, but he couldn’t believe the sensation he had just had either.
<name>Trinculo</name>	Trinculo	Majikthise	173 “think our brains must be too highly trained, [MASK].” So saying, they turned on their heels and walked out of the door and into a life-style beyond their wildest dreams. Chapter 26 Y"V"7es, very salutary
<name>Spock</name>	Spock	Ford	A whole section in the middle of both brains that related only to each other and not to anything else around them. Some bastard had cauterized all the synapses and electronically traumatized those two lumps of cerebellum.” [MASK] stared at him, aghast.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Zaphod	[MASK] stuck a head up for a dangerous moment. “Hey,” he said, “I thought you said you didn’t want to shoot us!” and ducked again. They waited. After a moment a voice replied, “It isn’t easy being a cop!”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Zaphod	“How can you say that?” cried [MASK], falling to his hands and knees and staring at the ground. He poked it and prodded it. It was very heavy and very slightly soft—he could mark it with his fingernail.
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Zaphod	“Here’s an interesting little notion. Did you realize that most people’s lives are governed by telephone numbers?” A pained look crawled across one of [MASK]’s faces and on to the other one. “Have you flipped?” he said.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Arthur	“You were upset!” “Yes. Five minutes later and it wouldn’t have mattered so much. It was a quite shocking cock-up.” “Huh?” said [MASK]. “The mice were furious.” “The mice were furious?”
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Ford	“Somebody did that to you?” whispered [MASK]. “Yeah.” “But have you any idea who? Or why?” “Why? I can only guess. But I do know who the bastard was.” “You know?
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Arthur	At that moment the bottom fell out of [MASK]’s mind. His eyes turned inside out. His feet began to leak out of the top of his head. The room folded flat around him, spun around, shifted out of existence and left him sliding into his own navel.
<name>Ron</name>	Ron	Ford	“They haven’t the wit.” “What were those thuds?” “Dunno.” They waited for a few more seconds. “Right,” said [MASK], “I’m going to have a look.” He glanced round at the others.
<name>The narrator</name>	The narrator	Fook	Or the ...” Contemptuous lights flashed across the computer’s console. “I spare not a single unit of thought on these cybernetic simpletons!” he boomed. “I speak of none but the computer that is to come after me!” [MASK] was losing patience.
<name>Randle</name>	Randle	Zaphod	he said. “Dunno,” said [MASK], “I think I preferred it when they were shooting.” “So are you going to come quietly,” shouted one of the cops again, “or are you going to let us blast you out?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ford	He just lay panting. “We’re trapped now, aren’t we?” “Yes,” said [MASK], “we’re trapped.” “Well, didn’t you think of anything? I thought you said you were going to think of something.
<name>Hal</name>	Hal	Ford	He was clearly very excited about something, almost childishly so. “Hey, this is really terrific, this is just far too much!” “What’s so great about being stuck in a dust cloud?” said [MASK].
<name>Ford</name>	Ford	Ford	The words Vogon Constructor Fleets flared in green across the screen. [MASK] pressed a large red button at the bottom of the screen and words began to undulate across it. At the same time, the book began to speak the entry as well in a still, quiet, measured voice.
<name>Hermione</name>	Hermione	Ford	“Understand that!” [MASK] sprang up. “Keep looking at the book!” he hissed urgently. “What?” “Don’t Panic. ” “I’m not panicking!” “Yes, you are.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Arthur	This wasn’t the way he had wanted it. Running up the lane, [MASK] had nearly reached his house. He didn’t notice how cold it had suddenly become, he didn’t notice the wind, he didn’t notice the sudden irrational squall of rain.
<name>Zaphod</name>	Zaphod	Ford	“Some people like the oddest things.” “And before that,” said [MASK], “we had platinum. Bit dull. We thought you’d like to see this one though.” 186 Seas of light glared at them in one solid blaze wherever they looked.
<name>Dirk</name>	Dirk	Ford	“I don’t know,” yelled [MASK], “I don’t know. It sounded like a measurement of probability.” 82 “Probability? What do you mean?” “Probability. You know, like two to one, three to one, five to four against.
<name>someone</name> (uncertain)	someone (uncertain)	Trillian	“But that’s crazy!” cried [MASK]. “You wouldn’t do that!” “Oh yes, we would,” shouted the cop, “wouldn’t we?” he asked the other one.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Arthur	“You know what’s happened now, of course?” “No, what?” said [MASK], who didn’t want to know. “We’ve arrived at another of those doors.” There was a sliding door let into the side of the corridor.
<name>Dr. Straker</name>	Dr. Straker	Slartibartfast	Chapter 27 [MASK]’s study was a total mess, like the results of an explosion in a public library. The old man frowned as they stepped in. ‘Terribly unfortunate,” he said, “a diode blew in one of the life-support computers.
<name>Zaphod</name>	Zaphod	Zaphod	“Then turn the bloody engines back on!” bawled [MASK]. “Oh, sure thing, guys,” said the computer. With a subtle roar the engines cut back in, the ship smoothly flattened out of its dive and headed back toward the missiles again.
<name>Holly</name>	Holly	Eddie	“Oh no . . .” “Hi there! This is [MASK], your shipboard computer, and I’m feeling just great, guys, and I know I’m just going to get a bundle of kicks out of any program you care to run through me.”
<name>Earth</name>	Earth	Earthman	Then the old man tried patiently to explain. “[MASK], the planet you lived on was commissioned, paid for, and run by mice. It was destroyed five minutes before the completion of the purpose for which it was built, and we’ve got to build another one.”
<name>the astronaut</name>	the astronaut	Ford	The planet’s surface was blurred by time, by the slow movement of the thin stagnant air that had crept across it for century upon century. Clearly, it was very very old. A moment of doubt came to [MASK] as he watched the gray landscape move beneath them.
<name>Zaphod</name>	Zaphod	Zaphod	Another voice broke in, presumably Halfrunt. He said “Veil, [MASK]’s just zis guy, you know?” but got no further because an electric pencil flew across the cabin and through the radio’s on/off-sensitive airspace.
<name>Ford</name>	Ford	Trillian	Okay, so ten out of ten for style, but minus several million for good thinking, yeah?” He tapped irritably at a control panel. [MASK] quietly moved his hand before he tapped anything impor- 89 tant.
<name>Dr. Smith</name>	Dr. Smith	Trillian	As he entered he was surprised to see two figures hunched excitedly over the instruments. “See? The ship’s about to move into orbit,” [MASK] was saying. “There’s a planet out there. It’s at the exact coordinates you predicted.”
<name>Mark</name>	Mark	Arthur	“No,” insisted [MASK], “don’t you understand, this is the first time I’ve actually stood on the surface of another planet ... a whole alien world ... ! Pity it’s such a dump though.”
<name>Ford</name>	Ford	Ford	A huge young Vogon guard stepped forward and yanked them out of their straps with his huge blubbery arms. “You can’t throw us into space,” yelled [MASK], “we’re trying to write a book.” “Resistance is useless!”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Marvin	“She’s not asking you to enjoy it,” he shouted, “just do it, will you?” “All right,” said [MASK], like the tolling of a great cracked bell, “I’ll do it.” “Good . .
<name>Dr. Floyd</name>	Dr. Floyd	Zaphod	Then a vast crescent sliced into the comer of the 1 13 picture—a red glare shading away into deep black, the night side of the planet. “I’ve found it!” cried [MASK], thumping the console. “I’ve found it!”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Ford	A man sitting next to [MASK] at the bar looked at the two men, looked at the six pints, did a swift burst of mental arithmetic, arrived at an answer he liked and grinned a stupid hopeful grin at them.
<name>Zaphod</name>	Zaphod	Zaphod	“No, we’re also going to ... er ... take evasive action!” said [MASK] with a sudden access of panic. “Computer, what evasive action can we take?” “Er, none, I’m afraid, guys,” said the computer.
<name>Unknown</name>	Unknown	Arthur	“Oh yes, very neat.” “What was it?” “Well, I hadn’t worked out the details yet. Not much point now, is there?” “So ... er, what happens next?” asked [MASK].
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Arthur	[MASK] shivered involuntarily as he seated himself next to the old man. The strangeness of it, the silent bobbing movement of the craft as it soared into the night sky, quite unsettled him. He looked at the old man, his face illuminated by the dull glow of tiny lights on the instrument panel.
<name>he</name>	he	Arthur	“What an extraordinary person,” he muttered to himself. “I beg your pardon?” said the old man. “Oh, nothing. I’m sorry,” said [MASK] in embarrassment. “All right, where do we go?”
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Zaphod	“What from? You just said there’s no one here.” “Yeah, well, just for safety, okay?” said [MASK]. “Whose? Yours or mine?” “Good lad. Okay, here we go.”
<name>Spock</name>	Spock	Marvin	“Go down to number two entry bay and bring the two aliens up here under surveillance.” With a microsecond pause, and a finely calculated micromodulation of pitch and timbre—nothing you could actually take offense at—[MASK] managed to convey his utter contempt and horror of all things human.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Zaphod	[MASK] paused. The scene around them was currently plunged into gloom. Dark mists swirled round them and elephantine shapes lurked indistinctly in the shadows. The air was occasionally rent with the sounds of illusory beings murdering other illusory beings.
<name>Zaphod</name>	Zaphod	Ford	“Oh freddled gruntbuggly ...” he began. Spasms wracked [MASK]’s body—this was worse than even he’d been prepared for. “? ... thy micturations are to me- As plurdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee.”
<name>Casey</name>	Casey	Arthur	Suddenly the air exploded with energy bolts as both the cops opened fire on them simultaneously. “Hey, they’re shooting at us,” said [MASK], crouching in a tight ball. “I thought they said they didn’t want to do that.”
<name>Titivillus</name>	Titivillus	Loonquawl	“What a dull name,” he said, and great incisions appeared down the length of his body. [MASK] too suddenly sustained horrific gashes from nowhere. The Computer console blotched and cracked, the walls flickered and crumbled and the room crashed upward into its own ceiling....
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Arthur	[MASK] agreed this was very sad. He did this with a 7! small feeble gesture, because he was too asphyxiated to speak. Deep rumblings of bemusement came from the guard. “Well. Now you put it like that I suppose ...”
<name>Deep Thought</name>	Deep Thought	Loonquawl	“Forty-two!” yelled [MASK]. “Is that all you’ve got to show for seven and a half million years’ work?” “I checked it very thoroughly,” said the computer, “and that quite definitely is the answer.
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Arthur	It sounds awful.” “Ah no, it was a beautiful place.” “Did it have oceans?” “Oh yes,” said [MASK] with a sigh, “great wide rolling blue oceans ...”
<name>Ford</name>	Ford	Ford	Hideous alien shapes seemed to throng about him, the air was thick with musty smells which sidled into his lungs without identifying themselves, and a low irritating hum kept his brain from focusing. “How did we get here?” he asked, shivering slightly. “We hitched a lift,” said [MASK].
<name>Ford</name>	Ford	Ford	“Resistance is useless!” “Oh, give it a rest,” said [MASK]. He twisted his head till he was looking straight up into his captor’s face. A thought struck him. “Do you really enjoy this sort of thing?”
<name>God</name>	God	Ford	Stop it.” Again came the voice. ‘Two to the power of seventy-five thousand to one against and falling.” [MASK] waddled around his pond in a furious circle. “Hey, who are you?” he quacked. “Where are you?
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Arthur	The car shot forward straight into the circle of light, and suddenly [MASK] had a fairly clear idea of what infinity looked like. It wasn’t infinity in fact. Infinity itself looks flat and uninteresting. Looking up into the night sky is looking into infinity—distance is incomprehensible and therefore meaningless.
<name>Zaphod</name>	Zaphod	Zaphod	“Are you telling me,” he said, “that you set yourself up to become President of the Galaxy just to steal that ship?” “That’s it,” said [MASK] with the sort of grin that would get most people locked away in a room with soft walls.
<name>Leela</name>	Leela	Arthur	“Yeah, could you just sort of keep this robot with you and guard this end of the passageway. Okay?” “Guard?” said [MASK]. “What from? You just said there’s no one here.”
<name>Zaphod</name>	Zaphod	Southend	“[MASK] seems to be melting away ... the stars are swirling ... a dustbowl ... my legs are drifting off into the sunset ... my left arm’s come off too.” A frightening thought struck him. “Hell,” he said, “how am I going to operate my digital watch now?”
<name>Zaphod</name>	Zaphod	Ford	“[MASK]!” he said, “there’s an infinite number of monkeys outside who want to talk to us about this script for Hamlet they’ve worked out.” Chapter 10 1_ _|he Infinite Improbability Drive is a wonderful new method of crossing vast interstellar dis-
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Ford	12 [MASK] frowned. “Er, no,” he said. “What do you see?” “Nothing.” “Recognize it?” “What are you talking about?” “We’re in the Horsehead Nebula. One whole vast dark cloud.”
<name>the protagonist</name>	the protagonist	Arthur	“You choose a cold night to visit our dead planet,” he said. “Who ... who are you?” stammered [MASK]. The man looked away. Again a look of sadness seemed to cross his face. “My name is not important,” he said.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Ford	[MASK] scrambled round and flung his shoulder uselessly against the reclosing hatchway. “But listen,” he shouted to the guard, “there’s a whole world you don’t know anything about ... here, how about this?”
<name>Ford</name>	Ford	Arthur	"Meanwhile, the poor Babel fish, by effectively removing all barriers to communication between different races and cultures, has caused more and bloodier wars than anything else in the history of creation. ” [MASK] let out a low groan.
<name>He</name>	He	Ford	He felt he ought to add something to that, but for the moment the guard seemed to have his mind occupied pondering that much. ‘‘Eerrrrrmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm ...” said the guard, “erm, well, that doesn’t sound that great to me.” [MASK] suddenly felt the moment slipping away.
<name>Ford</name>	Ford	Arthur	“No, the measurement of improbability!” “I don’t know. I don’t know at all. I think we’re on some kind of spaceship.” “I can only assume,” said [MASK], “that this is not the first-class compartment.”
<name>Zaphod Beeblebrox</name>	Zaphod Beeblebrox	Marvin	“Zaphod Beeblebrox ... ?" he said weakly. “Sorry, did I say something wrong?” said [MASK], dragging himself on regardless. “Pardon me for breathing, which I never do anyway so I don’t know why I bother to say it,
<name>Han Solo</name>	Han Solo	Ford	“Right!” he said. “Er ... we’ve got to get manual control of this ship.” “Can you fly her?” asked [MASK] pleasantly. “No, can you?” “No.”
<name>Fenchurch</name>	Fenchurch	Slartibartfast	“It sounded like quite a good life-style otherwise.” Somewhere on the wall a small white light flashed. “Come,” said [MASK], “you are to meet the mice. Your arrival on the planet has caused considerable excitement.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Arthur	This fact may safely be made the subject of suspense since it is of no significance whatsoever. Chapter 17 J a \ fter a fairly shaky start to the day, [MASK]’s / ^ \ mind was beginning to reassemble itself LJ \_Afrom the shell-shocked fragments the previous day had left him with.
<name>Hal</name>	Hal	Zaphod	“[MASK],” she said, “any minute now we will be swinging round to the daylight side of this planet,” adding, “whatever it turns out to be.” “Hey, what do you mean by that?
<name>Zaphod</name>	Zaphod	Ford	oh, well, look, it doesn’t matter now. The whole place has gone up in smoke anyway ...” “I wish you’d stop sulking about that bloody planet,” said [MASK]. “Who was the lady?” “Oh, just somebody.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Zaphod	— how did I work out how to do it?—I get a very strong 144 desire just to stop thinking about it. Like I have now. It’s a big effort to talk about it.” [MASK] paused for a while. For a while there was silence.
<name>Kip</name>	Kip	Arthur	[MASK] stared about him in a kind of wonderful horror. Ranged away before them, at distances he could neither judge nor even guess at, were a series of curious suspensions, delicate traceries of metal and light hung about shadowy spherical shapes that hung in the space.
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Ford	“No.” They waited. “Hello?” called out [MASK]. No answer. “That’s odd.” “Perhaps it’s a trap.” “They haven’t the wit.” “What were those thuds?” “Dunno.”
