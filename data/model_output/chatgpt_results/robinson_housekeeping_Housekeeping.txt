<name>Fisher</name>	Fisher	Sylvie	We knew enough about [MASK] to know that she had simply chosen not to act married, though she had a marriage of sufficient legal standing to have changed her name. No word had ever indicated who or what this Fisher might have been.
<name>Ethan</name>	Ethan	Sylvie	It was such a winter, [MASK] said, so cold, that the snow was as light as chaff. Any wind would blow a hill bare and send the snow drifting, as placeless as smoke. In the face of such hard weather the old woman had grown formal and acquiescent.
<name>her</name>	her	Sylvie	I wanted to ask her if she knew what she thought, and if so, what the experience of that sort of knowledge was like, and if not, whether she, too, felt ghostly, as 1 imagined she must. I waited for [MASK] to say, “You’re like me.”
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Sylvia	“So near the hospital.” “That’s an advantage, with children.” “I’m sure they’d be quiet.” “They’re very quiet.” “Girls always are.” “[MASK]’s were.” “Yes, they were.”
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Sylvie	She shifted around and peered over the other side. The wind was rising, and the boat sat rather heavily in the water, because we were over our shoes in water. I scooped some of it up in my hands and spilled it over the side. [MASK] shook her head.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Lucille	A ribbed circle spread to the four walls and the curves of its four sides rebounded, interpenetrating, and the orderly ranks of light swept and swung about the room. [MASK] stomped with her feet until the water sloshed against the walls like water carried in a bucket.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Sylvie	We sat listening to the rasp of the knife as [MASK] buttered and stacked the toast, bumping our heels with a soft, slow rhythm against the legs of our chairs, staring through the warped and bubbled window at the brighter darkness.
<name>Trillium</name>	Trillium	Edmund	Sometimes [MASK] would carry buckets and a trowel, and lift them earth and all, and bring them home to plant, and they would die. They were rare things, and grew out of ants’ nests and bear dung and the flesh of perished animals.
<name>The Woman</name>	The Woman	Sylvie	“Mostly.” “Have you ever seen any of them?” “I think I have,” [MASK] said. “Sometimes if I think I see smoke I go walking toward it, and now and then I’m sure there are children around me.
<name>he</name>	he	Sylvie	We were still for a while, listening to the shouts and watching the lights come on in the neighboring houses. We could even hear children’s voices, and there was an uproar among the dogs. “One thing we could do,” [MASK] said.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Lucille	There were lisps and titters, and the sounds of stealthy approach—the sense of a disturbing intention, its enacting inexplicably deferred. “[MASK],” I said. I could hear her stand up through the roof. “What time do you think it is?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sylvie	A stone splashed the water inches from my face, and another rattled into the bottom of the boat. [MASK] swung an oar over my head, settled it into the lock, crouched, and pulled us strongly away from the shore. A stone flew past my arm.
<name>Phelps</name>	Phelps	Lucille	we should ever need it.) [MASK] had startled us all, flooding the room so suddenly with light, exposing heaps of pots and dishes, the two cupboard doors which had come unhinged and were propped against the boxes of china.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Lucille	“She knows what you’re going to say,” [MASK] said. “I don’t know if she’ll work harder this year or not. She will or she won’t. You can’t really talk to her about practical things.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Sylvie	I finally fell asleep despite the noise [MASK] made washing and stacking dishes. In the morning the kitchen table was cleared and scrubbed and there was a bowl and a spoon and a box of cornflakes and a glass of orange juice and two pieces of buttered toast on a saucer and the vase of artificial daisies.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sylvie	“Probably in the orchard. I was looking for her.” “You can’t find her?” “She won’t let me. It’s like a game.” I walked out of the orchard and went and stood on the porch beside [MASK].
<name>a moose</name>	a moose	Lucille	Yet something of the somberness with which [MASK] and I remembered this outing had to do with our last glimpse of her fat haunches and her palsied, upright tail as she clambered up the rocks and into the dusty dark of the woods. It became a hot day.
<name>Miss Sasaki</name>	Miss Sasaki	Lucille	It is accurate to say that [MASK] went to the woods with me to escape observation. I myself felt the gaze of the world as a distorting mirror that squashed her plump and stretched me narrow. I, too, thought it was just as well to walk away from a joke so rudely persisted in.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Lucille	[MASK] shook her head. Her face was flushed and her cheeks were wet. “It’ll be all right,” I said. She wiped her face roughly with her sleeve. “I know it'll be all right, but it makes me mad.”
<name>she</name>	she	Lucille	“My clothes are wet.” “You should change your clothes.” I was too tired to move. She brought some wood from the porch and dropped it into the stove. “It doesn’t matter,” [MASK] said. “Where have you been?”
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Ruthie	“But you and [MASK] are together a lot.’’ “Oh, all the time now. She’s like another sister to me. She’s her mother all over again.” There was a long silence.
<name>her mother</name>	her mother	Lucille	She pulled her school coat over her shoulders without putting her arms in the sleeves, said good night, and went out to wait for her date by the side of the road. When [MASK] closed the door behind her the house seemed very empty.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Sylvie	I went over to the bench and lifted the newspaper. [MASK] smiled. “What a pleasant surprise,” she said. “And I have a surprise.” She sat up, groped in her trench-coat pocket, and pulled out a Mountain Bar.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Sylvie	The moon was going into eclipse behind a mountain, and the night was turning black. [MASK] had begun to hum to herself a song I did not know, and every moment was like every other, except that sometimes we turned, and sometimes a wave slapped our side.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Sylvie	“Now we find you asleep on a bench!’1 she shouted, and was unmollified by [MASK]’s assurances that she had not been asleep. “Probably nobody saw her,” I said. “In the middle of town? In the middle of the afternoon?”
<name>Earth</name>	Earth	Eve	So memory pulls us forward, so prophecy is only brilliant memory—there will be a garden where all of us as one child will sleep in our mother [MASK], hooped in her ribs and staved by her spine.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Lucille	“I’m talking to you,” [MASK] said. “I didn’t hear you.” “Well, why don't you keep up with me? Then we could talk.” “What about?” “What do other people talk about?”
<name>Marion</name>	Marion	Lucille	“She has her own ways,” she said quietly. That was the only time [MASK] and I spent together at school. I saw her often, but she avoided me. She became one of a group of girls who ate lunch in the Home Economics room.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Sylvie	[MASK] said. The air was sharp and cold and painful to swallow. Then bang! we could hear a window shatter in the house behind us, and bang! another. Someone shouted. We turned around to see, but we saw neither flames nor smoke.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Lucille	“Well, the fact is, I never did have many friends here. We kept to ourselves. We knew who everyone was, that’s all. And now I’ve been away— sixteen years.” “But you came back sometimes,” [MASK] said.
<name>the widow</name>	the widow	Nona	How must it have seemed to step into the narrow hallway which still kept (as it seemed to me) a trace of the rude odor that the funeral flowers had begun to make before [MASK] could bring herself to throw them away. Her hands and feet must have ached from the warmth.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Sylvie	That most moments were substantially the same did not detract at all from the possibility that the next moment might be utterly different. And so the ordinary demanded unblinking attention. Any tedious hour might be the last of its kind. “[MASK],” I said.
<name>he</name>	he	Sylvie	You know, so long as they don’t damage it.” We walked down to where a stand of birch and aspen trees sheltered a little inlet. “This would be a perfect place for it,” [MASK] said, but it was not there.
<name>Auntie</name>	Auntie	Sylvie	Crossed the bridge. Not that anybody knows of.” Well. “We’ve got to go if we’re going,” [MASK] said. “Are you all buttoned up? You should have a hat.” She put her arm around my shoulder and squeezed me.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Lucille	“Maybe I won’t go home.” "Where will you go?” “Down to the lake.” “It will be cold.” [MASK] shrugged. “I’ll go, too,” I said.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sylvie	“You wouldn’t believe how many people live out here on the islands and up in the hills,” [MASK] said. “I bet there are a hundred. Or more. Sometimes you’ll see a little smoke in the woods.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Sylvie	She had crept off to the freight yard one morning in the dark, leaving no word but a pearl ring which had never before been known to leave her hand. The pearl was brown as a horse’s tooth and very small. [MASK] kept the ring in a little box with her hairpins.
<name>Louise</name>	Louise	Sylvie	[MASK] smoothed her skirt with her long hands. The dress was a deep green, with a satiny shine. It had short sleeves and a large round collar on which there was a brooch, a little bunch of lilies of the valley.
<name>Cherry</name>	Cherry	Lucille	“I think I’ll go home.” “Don’t go home.” [MASK] turned to look at me. From beneath lowered brows her eyes beseeched me fiercely. “I brought money for Cokes,” she said.
<name>Margot</name>	Margot	Lucille	At the time I thought she lied very blandly about this, considering that she was, much of the time, wholly without guile. But perhaps what she told them was only what she forgot to tell us. [MASK] was, often enough, a touchy, achy, tearful creature.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Sylvie	Downstairs the flood bumped and fumbled like a blind man in a strange house, but outside it hissed and trickled, like the pressure of water against your eardrums, and like the sounds you hear in the moment before you faint. [MASK] lit a candle.
<name>She</name>	She	Lucille	It was a hard wind in her face; if she had made the world, every tree would be bent, every stone weathered, every bough stripped by that steady and contrary wind. [MASK] saw in everything its potential for invidious change.
<name>Miss Marple</name>	Miss Marple	Sylvie	“I could boil one.” “Either way would be fine,” [MASK] said. “A poached egg would be very nice.” She unbuttoned her coat and slipped her arms out of the sleeves. “What a lovely dress!”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Lucille	[MASK] pulled me up by the hair. At last it became ordinary day. Our jeans clung, our cuffs dragged, our hair hung in damp snarls. Our fingernails and our lips were blue. We had lost our fishing rods and our creel, as well as our shoes.
<name>Meg</name>	Meg	Sylvie	“Get up!" “In a minute.” “Now! Breakfast is ready!” I crouched on the covers, hoarding warmth and sleep, while they passed off me like a mist. “Wake up, wake up, wake up,” [MASK] said.
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Sylvie	“What did you think?” The room was dark. The cans in their towering stack gleamed blue and the effect was cold and melancholy. I said, “1 don’t want to talk.” “I don't know what to think,” [MASK] said.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Lucille	By that time the crickets in the pantry were singing again, the window was luminous, the battered table and the clutter that lay on it were one chill ultramarine, the clutter of ordinary life on the deck of a drowned ship. [MASK] sighed again and consented to the darkness.
<name>anyone</name>	anyone	Sylvie	It occurs to me sometimes that as I grow older I am increasingly able to present to her gaze the face she seemed to expect. But of course she was looking into a face I do not remember—no more like mine than [MASK]’s is like hers.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Sylvie	As we sometimes realized, we were now in [MASK]’s dream with her. In all our truancies, perhaps we never came to a place where she had not been before us. So she needed no explanation for the things we could not explain.
<name>George</name>	George	Lucille	Once, [MASK] and I walked beside the train to the shore. There had been a freezing rain that glazed the snow with a crust of ice, and we found that, when the sun went down, the crust was thick enough for us to walk on.
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Lucille	[MASK] peered at me. When she had made a decision or a choice, I had little to say. She knew my side of things as well as I did. She would have considered already the fact that I had never made a friend in my life.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Sylvie	But watching [MASK] seemed very much like dreaming, because the motion was always the same, and was necessary, and arduous, and without issue, and repeated, not as one motion in a series, but as the same motion repeated because here was the mystery, if one could find it.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Lucille	[MASK] and I used to delve in this drawer. Its contents were so randomly assorted, yet so neatly arranged, that we felt some large significance might be behind the collection as a whole. We noted that the socks, for example, all appeared unworn.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Nona	[MASK] went upstairs, and in a few minutes came down again, carrying a hot-water bottle. “I’ve put you in the hall bedroom. It’s a little close, but that’s better than a draft.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Sylvie	She was a music I no longer heard, that rang in my mind, itself and nothing else, lost to all sense, but not perished, not perished. [MASK] put her hand on my back. She had knelt on the grass beside me
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Sylvie	However a day’s or a week’s use might have maimed the velvet bows and plastic belts, the atomizers and gilt dresser sets, the scalloped nylon gloves and angora-trimmed anklets, [MASK] always brought us treasures. 6 The summer that followed was summer indeed.
<name>John</name>	John	Sylvie	It occurred to me that most people in bus stations would be conspicuous if it were not for the numbers of others there who would otherwise be conspicuous in the same way. [MASK], at that moment, would hardly be noticed in a bus station.
<name>Sylvie</name>	Sylvie	Sylvie	[MASK] walked over to the vanity. The cards were dealt for a third hand. “You started without me,” she said. We put bricks on the floor for our feet and wrapped ourselves in quilts and played gin rummy. During those days Fingerbone was strangely transformed.
<name>Meg</name>	Meg	Lucille	She smiled. “What have you been thinking about?” “Old times, mostly. People you don’t know. Is [MASK] home?” “Yes. She said she’d sleep downstairs.” “Well, we can’t let her do that.”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Sylvie	[MASK] liked cold food, sardines aswim in oil, little fruit pies in paper envelopes. She ate with her fingers and talked to us softly about people she had known, her friends, while we swung our legs and ate buttered bread.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Ruthie	“We’re nice folks, you know. My wife’s some cook, I tell you. We got apple pie at our house, [MASK], the world’s finest, believe me!” “No.” “ ‘No, thank you,’ ”
<name>Galadriel</name>	Galadriel	Sylvie	“I have never seen such a thing,” [MASK] said. The water shone more brilliantly than the sky, and while we watched, a tall elm tree fell slowly across the road. From crown to root, half of it vanished in the brilliant light.
<name>I</name>	I	Sylvie	I started running to bring myself closer to her, but she looked back and saw me and she began to run, too. I decided I would tell her that [MASK] wanted something from a store, since she was going downtown anyway.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Ruthie	“I wish I had a mink coat.” “I wish I had an electric blanket.” “Don’t sleep, [MASK]. I don’t want to sleep.” “Neither do I.” “We’ll sing.” “All right.”
<name>Dill</name>	Dill	Lucille	She walked slowly past the drugstore and the dime store and the dry-goods store, stopping to look into each of the windows. Then she walked directly to the railroad station and went inside. [MASK] and I walked down to the station.
<name>Ed</name>	Ed	Lucille	“You left your stuff at our house,” [MASK] said. “Oh, I just came in here to get warm. Nothing else is open. It’s early, you know. I forgot how early the sun rises these days.”
<name>Edie</name>	Edie	Ruthie	“What?” “Could I see [MASK]?” “No.” “She’s upstairs sleeping?” “Yes.” “Then it can’t hurt if I peek in the door.” “She sleeps very lightly. She’ll wake up.”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Lucille	Remembering that [MASK] had crawled in behind me, and that she crouched between me and the door, I scrambled out through the roof and over the wall into darkness no less absolute. There was no moon. In fact, there appeared to be no sky.
<name>He</name>	He	Sylvie	So whatever we may lose, very craving gives it back to us again. Though we dream and hardly know it, longing, like an angel, fosters us, smooths our hair, and brings us wild strawberries. [MASK] was gone.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Lucille	They watched us tensely and timidly, to see the result of their reprimand. “The time went by so fast,” [MASK] said. “We’re really sorry.” “You see, we can’t go out looking for you.”
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Lucille	[MASK] scooped up flowers and crushed them between her palms. I tried very hard to hit her with the dictionary, but she blocked it with her left elbow, and then slapped me very deftly on the left ear. I dropped the dictionary on the floor.
<name>Hugh</name>	Hugh	Sylvie	I dozed on the rocks while [MASK] watched for an eastbound train. A freight came after a long time, and it slowed so cautiously for the bridge that we clambered into a boxcar without much difficulty. It was half full of wooden crates and smelled of oil and straw.
<name>Old Man Winter</name>	Old Man Winter	Fingerbone	I do not know why it was persisted in, for it turned people out of house with a frequency to startle even [MASK]. And if the way to the next shelter was impassable because of snow, the family would not be seen again until the snow melted.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Sylvie	I was a little bit relieved,” she said. “A child like that might claw or bite. But I did want to look at it.” “This was at the place we’re going to now.” [MASK] smiled and nodded.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Sylvie	“Well, they might send someone to get her.” “I don’t think they will.” ‘‘What if they do?” The prospect was painful. [MASK] knew nothing about the history test, and we would have no chance to explain it to her.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Sylvie	“Wait here,” [MASK] said when we came to the shore. She walked down to a place where trees grew near the water. After a few minutes she came back. “The boat is not where I left it!” she said.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Sylvie	“She’s had so much trouble and sorrow.” So much, yes, she has, it’s the Lord’s truth, it’s a pity. It is. “Really, she’s all right,” [MASK] answered.
<name>Casey</name>	Casey	Sylvie	“And I have a surprise.” She sat up, groped in her trench-coat pocket, and pulled out a Mountain Bar. “Is that still your favorite? Look at this,” [MASK] said, spreading the paper in her lap.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Sylvie	“It’s still early.” We walked back down to the shore, and found some rocks against which we could sit, out of the wind, facing the sun. [MASK] crossed her ankles and folded her arms. She appeared to fall asleep.
<name>Beulah</name>	Beulah	Sylvie	I waited to see how long she would be still. I thought the darkness might make [MASK] her old self again, that she might disappear again, to extend my education, or her own. But then she stood the shovel in the ground.
<name>he</name>	he	Lucille	“I had no idea it was so late!” she called as we walked toward her. “I thought it would be an hour or so until school was out.” “School isn’t out,” [MASK] said. “Well, I was right after all, then.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Lucille	I was afraid to put out my hand, for fear it would touch nothing, or to speak, for fear no one would answer. We all stood there silently for a long moment. [MASK] said in a very loud voice, “I’m really tired of this.”
<name>Uncle Axel</name>	Uncle Axel	Sylvie	“But you’ll want to watch for the children.” “Yes. All right.” “Well, I think you better just stay in one place and be very quiet.” “Yes, but it’s too cold here.” [MASK] shrugged.
<name>Miss Stacy</name>	Miss Stacy	Lucille	What are we going to do about that?” “Give us extra homework,” [MASK] said. “We can catch up.” “Well,” he said. “You’re bright girls. You’ll be all right if you make the effort.
<name>She</name>	She	Sylvie	[MASK] shrugged. “He was tall. Not bad-looking. Awfully quiet, though. I think he was shy.” “What kind of work did he do?” /s* “He traveled. I think he sold some sort of farming equipment.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Sylvie	[MASK] lifted her shoulders. “It just wasn’t in the cards,” she said. “Did you want them?” “I always liked them.” “But, I mean, did you want to have them?”
<name>Lena</name>	Lena	Sylvie	We forgot supper. Again and again [MASK] stepped out of the firelight and in a few minutes reappeared with an armful of things to be burned. We had both become conscious of Fingerbone all around us, if not watching, then certainly aware of everything we did.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Sylvie	The current that made us sidle a little toward the center of the lake was the draw of the river, and no vortex, though my grandfather’s last migration had settled him on the lake floor. It seemed that [MASK]’s boat slipped down the west side of every wave.
<name>my grandfather</name>	my grandfather	Lucille	All my kin and forebears were people of substantial or remarkable intellect, though somehow none of them had prospered in the world. Too bookish, my grandmother said with tart pride, and [MASK] and I read constantly to forestall criticism, anticipating failure.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Sylvie	Even when I sat at the vanity with my back to her, I was aware of her lying there, and I could not keep my mind on my work. “[MASK],” I said once, but her eyes did not change.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Sylvie	Of course our aunt [MASK] knew nothing of our truancies, and so there would be her to face. All of this was too dreadful to consider, and every aspect of the situation grew worse with every day that passed, until we began to find a giddy and heavy-hearted pleasure in it.
<name>Mrs. Frank</name>	Mrs. Frank	Sylvie	We sat very still. Nevertheless, she should have seen us. We were almost accustomed by that time to the fact that [MASK]’s thoughts were elsewhere, but having waited so many days for someone to come for us, we found her obliviousness irksome.
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Lucille	“What are they good for?” This was not a real question, of course. [MASK] lowered her coppery brows and peered at me boldly, as if to say, It is no crime to harden my heart against pansies that have smothered in darkness for forty years.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sylvie	I stopped by the door and watched her stoke earth into the embers—one shovelful and a great waft of sparks and light rose in the air. [MASK] was all alight and around her the shadows leaped from behind their trees.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Sylvie	“Oh, no,” [MASK] laughed. “That was just the one time. We were so tired, you know. We’d been out all night, and we just took the fastest way home.” “Out where?” “On the lake.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sylvie	“I left them on the train.” “Why don’t you wear boots?” [MASK] smiled. “I suppose I should.” “You also need a hat. You should use hand lotion.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Lucille	The morning that my grandmother did not awaken, [MASK] and I had found her crouched on her side with her feet braced against a rumple of bedclothes, her arms flung up, her head flung back, her pigtail trailing across the pillows.
<name>Priscilla</name>	Priscilla	Sylvie	Now there was neither threshold nor sill between me and these cold, solitary children who almost breathed against my cheek and almost touched my hair. I decided to go back up and wait for [MASK] by the cellar hole, where she could not help but find me.
<name>Aunt Reed</name>	Aunt Reed	Sylvie	I saw just the same figure against the lid of my eye or the wall of my room, or in the trees beyond my window. Even the illusion of perimeters fails when families are separated. [MASK] realized that her first scheme to keep us together had failed.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Sylvie	[MASK] looked at the sky and said no more. I peered over the side now and then, into the murky transparencies of the upper waters, which were clouded and crude as agate. I saw gulls’ feathers and the black shapes of fish.
