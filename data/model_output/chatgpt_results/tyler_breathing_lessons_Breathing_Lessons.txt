<name>her</name>	her	Jesse	She felt rueful and proud, both. She was ashamed of herself for feeling proud, and to make up for it she acted especially kind to every girl who came. Sometimes she acted so kind that the girls continued to visit her for months after [MASK] had dropped them.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Maggie	But now here I am and it’s so quiet. It’s like I’m wrapped in cotton or something. I was thrilled to hear the phone ring.” “I wish you lived closer,” [MASK] said.
<name>Raymond</name>	Raymond	Maggie	He slowed as they came to a large, prosperous-looking farm. A grassy lane led toward the barn, and he veered onto that without signaling first, in order to make the turn seem more sudden and more exasperated. [MASK]’s sunglasses scooted the length of the dashboard.
<name>Phyllis</name>	Phyllis	Ira	Out of the blue (for [MASK] had never been thought to have a particularly striking voice),, she took it into her head that they should sing “Love Is a Many Splendored Thing” before the exchange of vows.
<name>Heirloom</name>	Heirloom	Maggie	[MASK]’s tomatoes were subject to an unusual ailment: They were bulbous, like collections of little red rubber jack balls that had collided and mashed together. This problem has persisted for several years, through several varieties of hybrids.
<name>him</name>	him	Jesse	She told [MASK]. “You promised.” “I don’t remember promising.” “Well, you did,” she said. “All right! I’ll get to it! Didn’t I tell you I would?”
<name>Norman</name>	Norman	Ira	Not a sign of them. Well, of course, he’d have taken them to the basement, where [MASK] kept his tools. She tore back down the stairs, calling toward the porch as she passed, “He’s on his way!”
<name>Heather</name>	Heather	Maggie	He would have to be expressly invited. [MASK] hoped he hadn’t made other plans. Saturday: That could mean trouble. She checked her watch. Saturday night he might very well be singing with his band, or just going out with his friends.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Maggie	It was one of those houses that appear to be mostly front porch, at least from the street—squat and low-browed, not at all impressive, as [MASK] was the first to admit. She wished at least the lights were on.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Daisy	“We looked like children,” she told him. “Like infants. We were hardly older than [MASK] is now; just imagine. And thought nothing of deciding then and there who we’d spend the next sixty years with.”
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Maggie	“I mean all of life, the whole messy kit and caboodle that comes at the end.” He sounded peevish; he seemed to think his wife had got away with something. [MASK] clucked again and patted his hand. It felt the way she imagined an eagle’s foot would feel.
<name>She</name>	She	Ira	The cover was only a token cover, a battered metal beret that she replaced crookedly on top. And the house’s siding was speckled with mildew, and rust stains trailed from a fuel tank affixed beneath the window. “How long will they be staying?” [MASK] asked when she returned.
<name>He</name>	He	Fiona	Are you comfortable? Is the baby moving?” “I don’t know.” “Is he moving or isn’t he? [MASK]? You must have some idea.” “I don’t know, I tell you. No. He’s not.”
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Maggie	Last came the shampoo. [MASK] dug through her purse for the coupon and handed it to him. “Here,” she said, “this is for you.” He took it and turned it over. He read it narrowly, not quite moving his lips.
<name>She</name>	She	Daisy	“[MASK]’s at school,” she told him. “And anyhow, she hasn’t needed watching in years.” “You’ll want someone to put supper on, though.” She gave up on him.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Fiona	“And they claimed I was getting married?” “ You claimed it. You called in and claimed your wedding was next Saturday.” “Not me,” [MASK] said. There was a kind of alteration of rhythm in the room.
<name>Jennifer</name>	Jennifer	Maggie	‘Love Is a Many Splendored Thing’?” “Not everyone would understand, though,” [MASK] said. “People who weren’t at the wedding, for instance.” Or even the people who were at the wedding, she thought privately.
<name>Sookie</name>	Sookie	Maggie	One angular brown hand was poised above a jack, preparing to strike. [MASK] stepped inside and shut the door. She set her purse down and wrapped her arms around him from behind. “You missed a good movie,” she said into his hair.
<name>she</name>	she	Maggie	They rattled like machine-gun fire. “Well,” [MASK] said, “I’m just going to pretend that I don’t know you.” She gathered the straps of her purse and slid out the other end of the pew.
<name>she</name>	she	Fiona	How must [MASK] feel, returning after so long—walking across the porch where she’d decided to keep her baby, passing through the front door that she had so often slammed out of in a huff? She looked drawn and dispirited.
<name>allergies</name>	allergies	Serena	“How come you’re acting so irritable?” “I’m not irritable,” she said. She pushed her sunglasses higher. She could see her own nose—the small, rounded tip emerging below the nosepiece. “It’s [MASK],” he said.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Maggie	[MASK] parked in front of an insurance agency next door. The picketers glanced over at her and then went back to watching the clinic. A car drew up and a girl in jeans got out, followed by a young boy.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Maggie	[MASK] wondered what a swelter was. She pictured it as a combi- nation of a sweat and a welt. She knew she must make an odd sight, arriving on foot out of nowhere so dressed up and citified. “Hello!” she cried, sounding like her mother.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Maggie	“Oh, yes!” “And I want to know if you’ll be home for the next little bit so we can come by and pick up her things.” “Yes, of course, come right away,” [MASK] said.
<name>him</name>	him	Ira	She looked over at [MASK]. She looked away. She hung the dress in her closet, next to her one silk blouse. “Goodness,” she said, turning toward him again. “Wasn’t Cartwheel dinky.” “Mm.”
<name>John</name>	John	Jesse	You couldn’t leave a wife and baby behind! But then other pictures came too: for instance, the year they’d all got the flu except for [MASK], and he had had to take care of them.
<name>Mame</name>	Mame	Jesse	so what, [MASK]?’ I ask him. ‘She’s so what? How dare you come tramping in here telling me she’s so something or other when the last time you sent us a check was December?
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Maggie	Only honked the horn when I was the one driving. Only scared that fellow so he lost what last few wits he had. Just once in your life, [MASK], I wish you would manage not to stick your nose in what doesn’t concern you.”
<name>darling</name>	darling	Jesse	It wasn’t me who called you, may I remind you,’ and she says, ‘But it was you, [MASK], because here you are on the line, aren’t you,’ and I say, ‘But goddamn it—’ ”
<name>Truman</name>	Truman	Maggie	“I still can’t see what else I could have done.” “Good gracious, no.” [MASK] picked up a box of Ritz crackers. There used to be a kind of apple pie people made that contained no apples whatsoever, just Ritz crackers.
<name>The speaker</name>	The speaker	Boris	They just hadn’t consciously understood that. “Well, why didn’t you say so?” [MASK] asked. “Who was it?” “No one you knew.” “You can’t be sure of that! Who was it?”
<name>Edie</name>	Edie	Ira	She had picked them up while she was dusting and come running to [MASK]. “What’ll we do? What are we going to do?” she had wailed. “Our daughter’s smoking marijuana; this is one of the telltale clues they mention in that pamphlet that the school gives out.”
<name>Rachel</name>	Rachel	Maggie	I could feel it. I can’t believe you’re doing this, [MASK].” “Well, I’m sorry,” she said stubbornly, “but I refuse to say I didn’t see what I saw with my own two eyes.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Serena	“If I just didn’t feel I had to carry him; always be the one to carry the household,” [MASK] had confided once. But then she had turned breezy and waved a hand, clanging her bangle bracelets. “Oh, well!
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Maggie	[MASK] breezed in as if she had a perfect right to be there and scooped up the magazine, at the same time performing a clumsy half-curtsy to show the old woman she meant no intrusion. She settled beside the man in coveralls.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Maggie	And all around the churchyard, members of the class of ’56 were recognizing each other. “Is that you?” they asked. And, “How long has it been?” And, “Can you believe this?” The Barley twins told [MASK] she hadn’t changed a bit.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Maggie	[MASK] had the morning off and so she was the one who drove him to the bus station. She felt lonesome after she had said goodbye. It suddenly seemed very sad that he had come all this way just to see her. She wished she had been nicer to him.
<name>someone</name> (There is no clear indication of a specific name in this passage)	someone (There is no clear indication of a specific name in this passage)	Maggie	“If I were traveling alone I’d make do with just a toothbrush,” she told [MASK]. “But once you’ve got a kid, you know how it is. Pajamas, comics, storybooks, coloring books for the car. . .
<name>someone</name>	someone	Mabel	She could step into the cafe and speak to [MASK], ask if she knew of a job and a place to stay; or she could head straight for town and find something on her own. In a way, she preferred to fend for herself.
<name>George</name>	George	Durwood	“Just let me get my car,” [MASK] said. “Oh, never mind that; we’re all walking. It’s just over there through the trees, and anyway there’s not a lot of parking space.”
<name>God</name>	God	Nature	They opened and closed their mouths in silence while the audience sang for them, poking gentle fun, intoning melodramatically. “ ‘Love is [MASK]’s way of giving, a reason to be living . . .’ ”
<name>Myrtle</name>	Myrtle	Ira	“It’s my wheel,” the old man said. “Lady back up the road a ways pointed out my wheel was falling off.” “That was us,” [MASK] told him. “Or my wife, at least.
<name>thought</name>	thought	Maggie	“She’s scared,” he said, “and I try to calm her down, but those hospital people keep shooing me out. Anytime someone official comes they ask me to leave.” So much for modern developments, [MASK] thought.
<name>her brother</name>	her brother	Daisy	Then she fixed herself a big bowl of ice cream. She wished they had bought mint chocolate chip. Fudge ripple was too white-tasting. She climbed the stairs, digging her spoon in. At the door to [MASK]’s room, she paused.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Serena	“I can be certain because I’ve come to the end of the line,” [MASK] said, turning back to the mirror. Her voice was at normal level now. She patted on liquid foundation, expertly dotting her chin and forehead and cheeks.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Fiona	She picked up her purse and left the room. [MASK] was kneeling in the hallway, rooting through the bottom of a closet. She pulled out a pair of galoshes and threw them aside. She reached in again and pulled out a canvas tote bag.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Maggie	“You’re just wondering what kind of fool you are even to consider allowing me behind the wheel.” He blinked. He had assumed the subject was concluded. “Lord, [MASK],” he said, “why do you always take things so personally?”
<name>she</name>	she	Maggie	He watched her. “I was worried,” she told him. So worried you took a joyride in a laundry cart, his glare said plainly. Then [MASK], stooping to set the brake on his wheelchair, was struck by the most peculiar thought.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Maggie	“Well, hi!” an old classmate said. “Um ...” [MASK] murmured, and she shaded her eyes and looked up the street. All she saw were more guests. She felt a moment’s impatience with them; they seemed so frivolous.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Maggie	“Late as we’re running now,” he said (another reproach), “it’ll be dark before we’re halfway home, and the state police are going to nail us for driving without a taillight.” “Stop off and get it fixed, then,” [MASK] said.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Maggie	"Navy’s fine.” “Also I’ve got that trick back.” She glanced at him. “And it’s not as if I was ever very close to him,” he said. [MASK] reached over to the steering wheel and laid a hand on his.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Fie	Yes, what a good idea; why don’t you.’ [MASK] said, ‘But how did she word it, is what I’m asking,’ and I said, ‘Oh, I forget,’ and he said, ‘Think.’
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Fiona	Then [MASK] didn’t eat, either, but sat there at the table playing with her food, a tear slipping down her cheek from time to time, and afterward she put on the hooded windbreaker that didn’t button over her stomach anymore
<name>She</name>	She	Jesse	“Huh?” “The keys to the van. Hand them over.” “Where are you going?” [MASK] asked her. “I don’t know! How would I know? I just have to get out of here.”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Junie	The traffic signal, turning green, was the one little pinprick of color. And nobody else was in sight except for a single balloon man, who took shape eerily on the opposite corner as they approached. It was the balloons that snagged [MASK]’s attention.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Ira	But then she found out she was pregnant, and she had to take leave from her job. And after that [MASK]’s sister developed a whole new symptom, some kind of seizures that required hospitalization; and a moving van crashed into the shop one Christmas Eve and damaged the building.
<name>Lorelai</name>	Lorelai	Fiona	“Well, of course you don’t.” [MASK] sat down heavily in a kitchen chair and threw her purse on the table. Like the most formal of guests, she was carrying that purse with her from room to room; some things never changed.
<name>George</name>	George	Ira	[MASK] wished she wouldn’t keep telling her dreams. It made him feel fidgety and restless. Maybe if he hadn’t gotten married. Or at least had not had children. But that was too great a price to pay; even in his darkest moods he realized that.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Fiona	What on earth had got into her, not even to question that the voice she’d heard was [MASK]’s? And on such a staticky, inadequate radio; she’d known perfectly well how inadequate it was, with those dinky litde auto speakers that didn’t begin to approach high fidelity.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Ira	The long drive and the forced conversation and the long drive home again, for absolutely nothing. And it was wasteful to devote your working life to people who forgot you the instant you left their bedsides, as [MASK] was forever pointing out.
<name>Ma	Ma	Maggie	Now [MASK] moved toward him, willing him further into the house. (He always seemed on the verge of leaving.) She took his arm and said, “I’m frying up some chicken; it’ll be a few more minutes.
<name>Herbie</name>	Herbie	Ira	Soft-drink cups and paper napkins covered the floor at her feet. Also there were loops of black and red wire sagging beneath the glove compartment; nudge them accidentally as you crossed your legs and you’d disconnect the radio. She considered that to be [MASK]’s doing.
<name>the flight attendant</name>	the flight attendant	Maggie	He pulled himself together and said, “Why, yes, I think so.” “With diet soft drinks?” “Urn . . .” “I’ll go check,” [MASK] said. “Those pretzels made me thirsty.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Ira	[MASK] cut the engine and watched the two of them walking across the apron. Over by the full-service island, a white boy with a stringy brown ponytail listened to what they asked and then shook his head. He said something, waving an arm vaguely eastward.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Mrs.	On the way, though, my breath come back to me and so I say, ‘[MASK], lets not go after all, they’ll only take my life savings to say I got nothing wrong with me,’ so she say fine
<name>Wilbur</name>	Wilbur	Ira	L-shaped samples of moldings hung from hooks on a yellowing pegboard wall, and the counter was painted a thick, cold gray. Behind this counter stood a bent old man in a visor, with shocks of white hair poking every which way. [MASK]’s father.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Maggie	“Oh, never mind that; we’re all walking. It’s just over there through the trees, and anyway there’s not a lot of parking space.” She took [MASK]’s elbow, leaning slightly. “It did go well, didn’t it?”
<name>something</name> (Note: There is no proper name that fits in this context, so the answer is "something" as a placeholder for an unknown noun.)	something (Note: There is no proper name that fits in this context, so the answer is "something" as a placeholder for an unknown noun.)	Maggie	She rose and bent over him and hugged him. She squatted next to him and tried to peer up into his face. Had something happened to his father? To one of his sisters? Was he just so disgusted with [MASK] that he couldn’t endure it?
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Ira	“On the radio while I was driving.” “They’d announce a thing like that on the radio?” “She telephoned it in.” “That seems kind of. . . self-important, if you want my honest opinion,” [MASK] said.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Fiona	While his telephone rang and rang, she twined the cord nervously between her fingers. She was conscious of [MASK] watching them, seated at the table with her chin resting on her cupped hand. “Who’re you calling?”
<name>Thee</name>	Thee	Thee	“Oh. Well, good.” He started whistling the last hymn they had practiced: “Just a Closer Walk with [MASK].” He sauntered beside her with his hands in his pockets. They passed a couple kissing at a bus stop.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Maggie	As soon as he came back upstairs (unashamedly heading straight to [MASK]), she told him that the mother of that girl, whoever she was, would be horrified to know her daughter had been alone with a boy in his bedroom.
<name>she was a baby</name>	she was a baby	Maggie	I was waiting in the hospital for you to be delivered. You stayed with us the first eight or nine months of your life.” “I did?” “You don’t remember staying with us?” “How could she, [MASK]?”
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Fiona	“Oh, why does this always happen between you two? He loves you, [MASK]. He loves you both. He’s just the world’s most inept at showing it. If you knew what it must have cost him to make that trip!
<name>her</name>	her	Maggie	But she would heave to her feet, sighing. Even in pregnancy, her body was a teenager’s—slender and almost rubbery, reminding [MASK] of those scantily clad girls she’d glimpsed on beaches who seemed to belong to a completely different species from her own.
<name>Aunt Alexandra</name>	Aunt Alexandra	Maggie	I thought it would make a nice touch.” “Nice touch! But you know how songs, well, age,” [MASK] said, winding after her among the tables. “Why not just some consoling hymns? Doesn’t your church have a choir?”
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Maggie	“At least, I think it is.” “Then maybe it was the windshield wipers,” [MASK] said. “I’ve done that, lots of times: switched on my wipers instead of my blinkers.”
<name>the Queen</name>	the Queen	Anita	I said to her mother, ‘Listen,’ I said, ‘you want to make a hit with the other residents? Want to show the staff right off that you’re not just another bland old lady?’ I mean this was [MASK]!
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Serena	“ ‘Then your fingers touched my silent heart,’ ” she sang, and she remembered how she and [MASK] had giggled over that line when they sang it themselves—oh, long before that fateful Harvest Home Ball—because where else was your heart but in your chest?
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Fiona	“Yes; tomorrow she leaves for college,” she said to [MASK]. “College! Well, she always was a brain.” “Oh, no . . . but it’s true she won a full scholarship.”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Maggie	Some incompetent idiot; best to put such people far behind you. He pressed the accelerator and checked the rearview mirror, but at the same time [MASK] reached over to jab his horn. The long, insistent blare startled him.
<name>her</name>	her	Maggie	“You take a packet of orange Jell-O powder, a can of crushed pineapple, a carton of Cool Whip . . .” Some woman in a bouffant hairdo said hello and the neighbor turned to greet her, leaving [MASK] with the gritty feeling of Jell-O powder on her teeth.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ira	She picked up a box of Fig Newtons and read the nutrition panel on the back. “Sixty calories each,” she said out loud, and [MASK] said, “Ah, go ahead and splurge.” “Stop undermining my diet,” she told him.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Maggie	They say I’m sure to make heaps of money.” “That’s just lovely!” [MASK] said. “Then maybe you can move out and find a place of your own.” And leave the pretender grandma behind, was what she was thinking.
<name>he</name>	he	Jesse	I must think of a way, it went, tactfully, tentatively, into your heart. . . When [MASK] was a little boy he liked to tell her stories while she cooked; he seemed to believe she needed entertaining.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Maggie	“Well, it’s just that. . . shoot, before she was born I had this sort of, like, anticipation. And now I’ve got nothing to anticipate, you know?” “Oh, that’ll pass,” [MASK] said.
<name>his</name>	his	Serena	She looked around for him but saw only the others, meaningless and bland. She threaded her way to the dining alcove, but he wasn’t among the guests who stood picking over the platters of food. She walked down the hall and peeked into [MASK]’s bedroom.
<name>James</name>	James	Jesse	Why, a boy didn’t stand a chance! But then [MASK] would saunter out, not even rearranging his face at the sight of them, making no effort whatsoever, his T-shirt giving off the yeasty smell of fresh sweat and his hair obscuring his eyes.
<name>Mrs. Avery</name>	Mrs. Avery	Maggie	“Mine are all boys,” she told [MASK]. “Studying came about as natural to them as flying.” “Yes, our boy was that way.” “ ‘Why aren’t you doing your homework?’ I’d ask them.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jesse	She smoothed the layers down again and shut the drawer. “But where would she be?” she asked [MASK]. It seemed for a long while that he wasn’t going to answer. Finally, though, he said, “I guess her sister’s.”
<name>Marion</name>	Marion	Maggie	“I’ll go out and do some shopping,” [MASK] told him. “What? No, wait.” “You’ll have the place to yourselves.” “Wait, don’t go. How will I—? Maybe we’ll need you.”
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Junie	This happened, from time to time. “Remind yourself you’re here as someone else.” “I believe I’m going to faint,” [MASK] said, and without warning she swung her spike-heeled sandals up and lay down flat upon the bleacher.
<name>She</name>	She	Maggie	[MASK] went to the waiting room, which was the size of a football field. A vast expanse of beige carpeting was broken up by clustered arrangements of beige vinyl couches and chairs. She settled on an empty couch and chose a ruffle-edged magazine from the beige wooden end table.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Leroy	She turned to follow the house with her eyes. The drums grew smaller but stayed eerily bright, like fish in an aquarium. “I had the weirdest dream,” she said after a moment. “Was I in it?” [MASK] wanted to know.
<name>Mavis</name>	Mavis	Maggie	[MASK] watched the waitress cleaning a griddle. She sprayed it with something, scraped up thick gunk with a spatula, and sprayed again. From behind she was a large white rectangle, her gray bun tacked down with black bobby pins.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jesse	She knocked. After a startled pause, [MASK] called, “Just a second.” She heard rustles and whispers. When he came out he had a girl in tow. Her long blond hair was rumpled and her lips had a bruised look.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ira	[MASK] reappeared at the window and motioned for her to move over. “Well be ticketed for this—what do you bet?” he said, opening the door and getting in. “I really couldn’t care less,” she said.
<name>Mrs. Bradley</name>	Mrs. Bradley	Ira	Maybe he would say that [MASK] had mentioned her name. That wasn’t completely impossible. Or, seeing how she had been one of the few who had properly valued his son, he might even send her some little memento—maybe an old photo.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Maggie	Then [MASK] thought of what she might find in her own gun-nysack—the misplaced compacts, single earrings, and umbrellas, some of which she hadn’t noticed losing at the time but recollected weeks or months afterward. (“Didn’t I used to have a . . . ?”
<name>Officer</name>	Officer	Ira	“Well, no.” “Probably he’s been drinking. Remember that public service message on TV? We have a civic duty to report him. Speed up, [MASK].” He obeyed, mostly out of exhaustion.
