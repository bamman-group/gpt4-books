<name>Friday</name>	Friday	MEGAN	She’s not looking at me, but over my shoulder, and as I turn around to follow her gaze, I see him at the kitchen window, watching us. [MASK] FRIDAY, JULY 12, 2013 MORNING She’s forced my hand. Or maybe he has.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Scott	I think about that, and the way he used to be—the way they used to be, the way I imagined them to be—and 1 feel bereft. I feel their loss, too. I sent an email to [MASK], apologizing for all the lies I told him.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Rachel	It’s this house, this situation, all the things that have been going on here— they’re making me doubt myself, doubt us. If I’m not careful they’ll end up making me crazy, and I’ll end up like her. Like [MASK].
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Megan	[MASK] has been missing for around 133 hours, and I feel better than I have in months. When 1 looked at myself in the mirror this morning, 1 could see the difference in my face: my skin is clearer, my eyes brighter. 1 feel lighter.
<name>Elwood</name>	Elwood	Scott	“I can’t go home,” he says. “There are cameras everywhere.” “[MASK]?” “I know this is . . . this is really weird, but I just need to go somewhere, somewhere they won’t be waiting for me.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Riley	“Why haven’t you changed your name?” [MASK] asked me. “Excuse me?” “You still use your husband’s name. Why is that? If a man left me for another woman, I think I’d want to get rid of that name.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Megan	I shook my head. I put my hand out to him, and he took it. “[MASK],” he said again, shaking his head. I didn’t say anything. “You can’t . . . You should sit down,” he said.
<name>him</name>	him	Tom	Trains are wonderful.) Before, when I was still myself, I used to dream of taking romantic train journeys with [MASK]. (The Bergen Line for our fifth anniversary, the Blue Train for his fortieth.) Hang on, we’re going to pass them now.
<name>She</name>	She	Anna	[MASK] raised her hand to her mouth and swooped down to grab her child. The lioness protecting her cub. I wanted to laugh at her, to tell her, I’m not here Jot you, 1 couldn’t be less interested in your daughter.
<name>she</name>	she	Meg	I take my chance. “I wanted to ask you about what happened,” I say. “The night that I met you. The night that [MASK]—The night that woman disappeared.” “Oh. Right. Why? What d’you mean?”
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Megan	It’s hard to believe now that there was once a time when I wanted her to appear. Since [MASK] went missing I’ve avoided walking this way whenever possible—it gives me the creeps passing that house—but to get to the cafe it’s the only route.
<name>someone's</name>	someone's	Martin	I walked to the very far end, next to the zoo. I sat down in the shade beneath a sycamore tree, thinking of the unfilled hours ahead, replaying the conversation in the coffee shop, remembering the look on [MASK]’s face when he said good-bye to me.
<name>him</name>	him	Tom	I didn’t even get upset. I was just astounded. And when I brought it up with [MASK]—calmly, matter-of-factly—he was just as baffled as I was. “I’ll get in touch with her,” he said.
<name>Dave</name>	Dave	Anna	” [MASK] starts to protest. “It’s OK.” He smiles at his wife. “I just want a cuddle. Don’t I, darling?” He goes over to the fridge with his daughter in his arms and pulls out a beer.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Anna	“You think he did it?” He shakes his head, swallows hard. “No, no. I’m not saying that. I know . . . Well, [MASK] says that they argued a lot.
<name>Reality</name>	Reality	Life	I wake abruptly, my breath jagged and heart racing, my mouth stale, and I know immediately that’s it. I’m awake. The more I want to be oblivious, the less I can be. [MASK] and light will not let me be.
<name>He</name>	He	Abdic	It’s from him, I assume. [MASK].” He gives a long, shuddering sigh. “I don’t understand why. I don’t understand why he would say things like that about her. I don’t know what he’s trying to do.
<name>God</name>	God	aboyd@cinnamon.com	When I closed down the browser window with his calendar in it, there was his email account, logged in, laid bare. There was a message at the top from [MASK]. I clicked. XXXXX. That was it, just a line of As.
<name>Anna's</name>	Anna's	Tom	I think about [MASK]’s laptop, which is on the coffee table in the living room. And then 1 do the things 1 never thought I would. I grab the bottle of red that we opened last night with dinner and 1 pour myself a glass.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Megan	And she was all too happy to provide it.” “I’m really sorry, that’s awful. I know ... I wanted to have a child. [MASK] kept saying she wasn’t ready yet.” Now it’s his turn to wipe the tears away.
<name>Daddy</name>	Daddy	Scott	I ran home and through the house and down to the tracks, then I sat down there, waiting for the train to come, to rattle through me and take away the other noises. I waited for [MASK] to come and calm me down, but he wasn’t at home.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Scott	The downpour has become a deluge. We are the only people on the street, both of us soaked to the skin. [MASK] starts to laugh. He throws his hands up in the air and roars with laughter. “Come to the house,” he says.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Scott	[MASK] nods. “He told the police that she was unhappy with me and she might have run off.” “He’s trying to shift suspicion, get them to think that you did something.” “I know that. But they seem to buy everything that bastard says.
<name>He</name>	He	Scott	But they didn’t actually have enough to charge him with anything anyway.” He hands me the mug and we sit down at the table. I notice that one of the photograph frames on the sideboard has been turned facedown. [MASK] is still talking.
<name>AA</name>	AA	Scott	I can be thankful to [MASK] for this: I’m too afraid, now, to go out in the middle of the night to buy booze. I’m too afraid to let myself slip, because that’s when I make myself vulnerable.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Scott	All I know for sure—for absolutely certain—is that [MASK]’s wife has been missing for a week. I know that he is probably a suspect. And I know, because 1 saw that kiss, that he has a motive to kill her.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Rachel	“[MASK], it’s me.” His voice is leaden, he sounds worn out. “Listen, you have to stop this, OK?” I don’t say anything. The train is slowing, and we are almost opposite the house, my old house.
<name>her</name>	her	Megan	He’s talking through gritted teeth; I can see the muscle tensing in his jaw. “I was so pissed off, I just wanted you to go away and leave us alone, you and [MASK]. I have my family. I have a good life.”
<name>John</name>	John	Scott	His tone is light, as though this is a casual request, but I can feel him watching me, his eyes on my face. We’re on the edge of an argument, and I have to be careful. “I can’t, [MASK], it’s too late,” I say.
<name>her</name>	her	Evie	I pick [MASK] up and we go out into the garden together. She’s pushing her little trolley up and down, giggling to herself as she does it, this morning’s tantrum forgotten. Every time she grins at me I feel like my heart’s going to explode.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Megan	[MASK] hardly ever invites people round. She’s really private, protective of her own space.” I’m searching for a reason. I wish I had never told him I’d been to the house. “I just came round to borrow a book.”
<name>He</name>	He	Scott	In the end I really thought I could just walk away from it, a little bruised, but no real harm done. But it’s not that simple any longer. [MASK] is still outside the door. I can’t hear him, but 1 can feel him.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Jess	I look carefully, as the train rolls slowly past, for blood on the clothes, but 1 can’t see any. The train stops at the signal as usual. I can see [MASK] standing on the patio in front of the French doors.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Jason	[MASK] is standing behind her, his hands on her shoulders. I smile at them. I want to wave, but I don’t want people to think I’m weird. I just watch, and I wish that I had a glass of wine, too.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Scott	I phoned [MASK] this morning when I saw the news. He didn’t answer, so I left a message, telling him I was sorry. He called back this afternoon. “Are you all right?” I asked him. “Not really.”
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Anna	I couldn’t let her go to the house. I couldn’t let her talk to [MASK], could I? I told her that we could go somewhere and talk, and I meant it—that was all I was going to do.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Gaskill	I could feel my face flushing again. I shook my head. “No, I didn’t,” I said. [MASK] got to his feet and held out his hand for me to shake. “I think that’s enough.”
<name>Adnan</name>	Adnan	Megan	I can’t remember the last time I laughed like that. I’m not laughing now. As soon as I got myself a seat, I checked the latest on [MASK]’s case on my phone, and it’s the news I’ve been dreading.
<name>Daniel</name>	Daniel	Tom	I can almost feel it, the warmth of that morning sunshine on my face and arms as I sit at the breakfast table, [MASK] opposite me, my bare feet resting on top of his because they’re always so much warmer than mine, my eyes cast down at the newspaper.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Anna	The smell of shit fills the room; it turns my stomach. “Are you going to tell us why?” I ask him. [MASK] stops what she’s doing and looks across at us. The room is still, quiet, save for the babbling of the child.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Cathy	[MASK] came upstairs to see me, she knocked softly on my door and opened it a fraction. She cocked her head to one side and asked if I was OK. I apologized without being sure what 1 was apologizing for.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Tom	I’m hoping that being there will jog my memory, that I’ll get to the station and I’ll see everything clearly, I’ll know. I don’t hold out much hope, but there is nothing else I can do. I can’t call [MASK].
<name>her</name>	her	Megan	I felt dizzy, as though I were having an out-of-body experience, as though I were looking out at myself. “You said in your email that you wanted to tell me something about [MASK].” The pitch of his voice raised a little.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Anna	“Yes.” [MASK] must be there with him, he doesn’t want to say my name. 1 wait for a moment, to give him time to move to another room, to get away from her. I hear him sigh. “What is it?”
<name>her</name>	her	Anna	Please tell me so that I can put [MASK]’s mind at ease. She’s worried.” “I had something to tell him. Something I thought might be useful.” “You didn’t see her, but you had something useful to tell him?”
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Anna	Did you give it to her?” [MASK] shakes her head. “Where is it?” “I threw it away,” she says. “Over the fence. By the track.” “Good girl. Good girl,” he says distractedly.
<name>Diana</name>	Diana	Megan	He’s talking about the news, about the things they’re saying about her. This tabloid story, supposedly leaked by someone in the police, about [MASK]’s involvement in the death of a child. Murky, speculative stuff, a smear campaign on a dead woman.
<name>her</name>	her	Megan	“I’ve spent the whole day going through [MASK]’s things again,” he says. “I’ve already searched our room, the whole house, half a dozen times, looking for something, anything that would give me an indication as to where she could be.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Megan	I should pour it down the sink, but I know I’m not going to. Something to look forward to in the morning. It’s dark, and I can hear someone calling her name. A voice, low at first, but then louder. Angry, desperate, calling [MASK]’s name.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Tom	Total black; hours lost, never to be retrieved. [MASK] bought me a book about it. Not very romantic, but he was tired of listening to me tell him how sorry I was in the morning when I didn’t even know what I was sorry for.
<name>Psychology Today</name>	Psychology Today	Vogue	I sat down and picked up a copy of [MASK] and flicked through it with trembling fingers, trying to focus my mind on the task ahead while at the same time attempting to look unremarkably bored, just like any other patient.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Rachel	There is a lump in my throat as hard as a pebble, smooth and obstinate. I cannot swallow. I cannot speak. “[MASK]? Are you there? I know things aren’t good with you, and I’m sorry for you, I really am, but ...
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Tom	[MASK] said she was being reasonable, she didn’t seem drunk, she wasn’t hysterical, she didn’t make threats or beg him to go back to her. He told me he thought she was getting better.
<name>Yours</name>	Yours	Kamal	He waits for me to say something, but I’m frightened of saying the wrong thing, so I stay silent. “It’s not mine. It wasn’t mine. The funny thing is, it wasn’t [MASK]’s, either.” He laughs.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Cathy	It’s awful, cringeworthy, but I start to weep. I sob and sob, and poor [MASK] holds me, strokes my hair, tells me I’ll be all right, that everything will be all right. I feel wretched.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Rachel	I feel immeasurably calmer when we go back outside, even if [MASK] is still there, standing down at the bottom of the garden by the fence, watching one of the trains go past. After a while, when she realizes that I’m back outside, she walks towards me.
<name>He</name>	He	Gaskill	I slipped on the steps and he caught my arm.” [MASK] leaned forward, his elbows on the table, hands clasped together in front of his mouth. “He was wearing ... I think he was wearing a blue shirt.” This is not actually true.
<name>Maya</name>	Maya	Megan	“Back in August and September last year.” I don’t know what to say. I can’t imagine it: [MASK] in my home, with her, with her baby. “The cut on your lip, is that from when you got knocked down the other day?”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Tom	And yes, I was angry. I was really pissed off by that point.” “I’m sorry, [MASK],” I say. “I’m really sorry.” “I know,” he says. “You’re always sorry.”
<name>friends</name>	friends	Tom	At some point our childlessness became an acceptable topic of Sunday-lunch conversation, not just between [MASK] and me, but more generally. What we were trying, what we should be doing, do you really think you should be having a second glass of wine?
<name>Leah</name>	Leah	Anna	He’s saying something but I don’t hear what. I keep my hands raised and my head down, so I’m barely five feet away from her when I see [MASK], standing next to her car, hands on hips, watching me.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Tom	I lean farther forward, my heart hammering in my chest, trying to get a better look, but the angle’s wrong and I can’t see her now. I turn, ready to bolt out of the front door to chase her down the street, but [MASK]’s standing there in the doorway,
<name>her</name>	her	Evie	He climbs back into bed and we lie with [MASK] between us. She has her fingers curled tightly around his forefinger and I have hold of her perfect pink foot, and I feel as though fireworks are going off in my chest. It’s impossible, this much love.
<name>Facebook</name>	Facebook	Facebook	Something he wrote, rather: I read it on [MASK] that morning. It wasn’t a shock—I knew she was having a baby, he’d told me, and I’d seen her, seen that pink blind in the nursery window.
<name>He</name>	He	Gaskill	She closed the file in front of her. [MASK] leaned back in his seat, studying my face. She clearly thought I was making it up; he wasn’t so sure. “Can you describe him?”
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Anna	I try not to think about what came after. I try not to think about that night. 1 try and I fail. Side by side, drenched in his blood, we sat on the sofa, [MASK] and I. The wives, waiting for the ambulance.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Megan	“There is no him, OK? It’s over.” “Please wait, [MASK]. Please don’t go.” I don’t want to hear him beg, don’t want to listen to the whine in his voice, the self-pity.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Megan	But I need to give him a reason to talk to me, and I’m worried that whatever I saw will make me look like a madwoman. He might even think 1 have something to do with [MASK]’s disappearance, he could report me to the police.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Anna	I wasn’t too worried at first, because [MASK] was going out. You remember, darling? You were supposed to be going out to dinner with the girls, and I was going to babysit. I thought perhaps it wouldn’t be such a bad thing—she would come round
<name>him</name>	him	Tom	“I do hope we’ll be able to see her soon,” she said, but when I told [MASK] about it he dismissed it. “She’s trying to get me to invite them round,” he said, “just so she can refuse.
<name>yourself</name>	yourself	Megan	I don’t want to hear this. You’ve got some problem with your ex, your ex’s new wife, that’s obvious. It’s got nothing to do with me, nothing to do with [MASK], has it? Jesus, aren’t you ashamed?
<name>he</name>	he	Tom	I get out of bed, slip into the nursery and pick her up. I feed her and take her back to bed with me. When I wake again, [MASK]’s not at my side, but I can hear his footfalls on the stairs.
<name>her</name>	her	Clara	Just like I remember saying good-bye to [MASK] after that party and her hand holding mine. Just like I remember the fear when I found myself on the floor next to that golf club—and I know now, I know for sure that I wasn’t the one swinging it.
<name>he</name>	he	Tom	I remember her saying that we should get together again; I remember her holding my hand in hers. I remembered that so clearly, but it wasn’t true. I knew it wasn’t true the next morning when [MASK] turned his back on me when I tried to speak to him.
<name>Marie Kondo</name>	Marie Kondo	Cathy	It could be her birthday, it could be the morning of the Rapture—[MASK] will get up early on Saturday to clean. She says it’s cathartic, it sets her up for a good weekend, and because she cleans the house aerobically, it means she doesn’t have to go to the gym.
<name>Rachel</name>	Rachel	Megan	He turned to face me. “You saw [MASK] from the train?” he asked. “So you were . . . just looking out of the window and there she was, a woman you happen to know?” The atmosphere in the room had changed.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Anna	I drag her outside and talk to her, low and urgent. “You have to calm down, [MASK]. Do you understand me? I need you to calm down. I need you to talk to him, to distract him for a moment while I ring the police.
<name>Carol</name>	Carol	Rach	I was a good husband to you, [MASK]. I put up with a lot—your drinking and your depression. I put up with all that for a long time before I threw in the towel.” “You lied to me,” I say.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Megs	I go downstairs to say good-bye as he’s heading off to work. He slips his arms around my waist and kisses the top of my head. “Love you, [MASK],” he murmurs, and I feel horrible then, like the worst person in the world.
<name>Tony</name>	Tony	Megan	“[MASK], I can’t counsel you any longer.” “I know. I know that. But I can’t start over with someone else. I can’t. We got so far. We were so close. I just have to tell you.
<name>he</name>	he	Scott	Then one day, when [MASK] was away, I bumped into him in the street, we started talking and I invited him in for coffee. The way he looked at me, I could see exactly what was going through his mind, and so it just happened.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Scott	[MASK] leaned against the counter, his head bent almost to his chest. I felt wretched then. I wasn’t helping, I had just made him feel worse, increased his pain. I was intruding on his grief, it was wrong.
<name>myself</name>	myself	Scott	They think I’m a stalker, a nutcase, mentally unstable. I should never have gone to the police station. I’ve made my own situation worse and I don’t think I’ve helped [MASK], which was the reason I went there in the first place.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Rach	“Grab hold. Come on, [MASK], up you come.” I let him pull me to my feet. My back is to the kitchen counter, he is standing in front of me, against me, his hips pressing against mine.
<name>she</name>	she	Jess	I feel a flash of intense anger. I feel as though something has been taken away from me. How could she? How could [MASK] do this? What is wrong with her? Look at the life they have, look at how beautiful it is!
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Megan	In the distance, I heard a low rumbling—the train was coming. It felt comforting, that old sound. “You’re a friend of [MASK]’s?” he said at last. Hearing her name from his lips brought a lump to my throat.
<name>Jesse</name>	Jesse	Scott	They had him in for questioning again yesterday. They won’t confirm it, of course, but there’s footage on the Internet: [MASK], walking into the police station, his mother at his side. His tie was too tight, he looked strangled.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Megan	“You’re saying I’m imagining all this?” He shook his head. “You have to understand, [MASK], I shouldn’t have let things get this far.” I moved closer to him, put my hands on his hips and turned him around.
<name>them</name>	them	Rachel	He does fool me. I know he’s not always 100 percent honest about everything. I think about that story about his parents—how he invited them to the wedding but they refused to come because they were so angry with him for leaving [MASK].
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Megan	Remember how you always argued with me, how you always wanted the last word? [MASK] was like that. She wouldn’t listen.” He shifts in his seat and leans forward, his elbows on his knees, as if he’s telling me a story.
<name>Her</name> (There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to a female person previously mentioned or known to the speaker and the context.)	Her (There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to a female person previously mentioned or known to the speaker and the context.)	Rachel	He was distracted, pulling on his jacket, straightening his tie, getting ready to go to meet the day’s last client. “What are we going to do?” I asked him. “Do?” He looked at me blankly. “About her. [MASK].
<name>lazy</name>	lazy	Saturdays	I felt a horrible pang of envy then, a longing for [MASK] spent lying on the sofa with the newspapers and a hazy memory of leaving the club the night before. Stupid, really, because what I’ve got now is a million times bet- ter,
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Tom	It wipes the smile off my face, though, thinking about those conversations. Thinking about [MASK] laughing conspiratorially while he traced his fingers lower over my belly, smiling up at me, saying, “I’m a good liar.” He is a good liar, a natural.
<name>John</name>	John	Gaskill	I wanted to see him, but then I decided that it wasn’t a good idea, so I came home.” “What time was this?” [MASK]’s voice was even, his face completely blank. His lips barely moved when he spoke.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Tom	So I pick up the phone and dial his number, butterflies in my stomach, just the way it always used to be, the anticipation of hearing his voice as acute now as it was years ago. “Yeah?” “[MASK], it’s me.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	[MASK] told me, “It won’t always be like this, they’ll eventually upgrade the line and then it will be fast trains screaming past,” but I couldn’t believe it would ever actually happen. I would have stayed there, I would have bought him out if I’d had the money.
<name>him</name>	him	Mac	This means I’m to go on, I’m to keep talking. “I was actually really happy there, with [MASK]. I lived with him for . . . God, it was about three years, I think, in the end. I was . . .
<name>him</name>	him	Kamal	I glance over, just for a moment, but we’re too far away on this side of the track to really see anything. I keep thinking about the day I saw [MASK], about the way he kissed her, about how angry I was and how I wanted to confront her.
<name>him</name>	him	Tom	What could I tell her? There was no way to explain it. I just said I was sorry and went upstairs to my room, like a teenager in a sulk. And then I lay awake, trying to sleep, waiting for [MASK] to call.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Tom	I remember waking that morning filled with anxiety, instantly knowing that something terrible had happened. [MASK] wasn’t in bed with me, and I felt relieved. I lay on my back, playing it over. I remembered crying and crying and telling him that I loved him.
