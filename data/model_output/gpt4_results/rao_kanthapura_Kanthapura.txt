<name>Arundhati</name>	Arundhati	Kanthapura	The brass vessels shimmer and shake, and then there is only the long, moving shadow on the wall. There, in the streaming starlight, [MASK] floats like a night procession of the gods over still waters, and up the Bebbur mound is seen a wavering lantern light.
<name>Ramu</name>	Ramu	Bhatta	She is twelve and a half years old, and_mji - ^ year’s time [MASK] can have someone to light his bath fire at least. A thousand rupees cash, and five acres of wet land beneath the Settur canal. And a real seven-days marriage.
<name>Rama</name>	Rama	Ranganna	But [MASK] comes and tells me, ‘I cannot change his heart. You are a religious man, go and speak to him,’ and I came to see you. I have neither hair nor home, and I have come to tell you, this is not just.

<name>Ramu</name>	Ramu	Bhattare	I don’t think so. He always says let the castes exist, let the separate-eating exist, let not one community marry with the other—no, no, [MASK], the _Mahatma is not for all this pollution.”
<name>Esteban</name>	Esteban	Venkamma	and [MASK] cries out, "That’s it, sister. You forgot it. But this body that has borne eight children cannot forget it. If you had a daughter to marry, you would not forget it, would you?”

<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Rangamma	He would come. He was only at [MASK]’s house. Oh, he was no wicked child to leave the village without telling her. Oh, the fool that she was to have been so angry with him!
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Ratna	She seemed something so feminine and soft and distant, and the idea that he could ever think of her other than as a sister shocked him and sent a shiver down his spine. But [MASK] looked at him sadly and shyly, and whispered, “Is there anything I can do?”
<name>Babu</name>	Babu	Stamp	Let us say two hundred and seventy-five. Two hundred and seventy-five it shall be. [MASK] charges three rupees, registration bribes two-eight, and eight annas for the head peon and four annas for the doorkeeper.
<name>Liberty</name>	Liberty	Swaraj	Have faith in your enemy, he says, have faith in him and convert him. But the world of men is hard to move, and once in motion it is wrong to stop till the goal is reached. And yet, what is the goal? Independence? [MASK]?

<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Moorthy	We would not insult him. We would not hate him. But we could not love him. How could we? He was not my uncle’s son, was he? And even if he were. ... The next day [MASK] was weaker still.
<name>Raman</name>	Raman	Rangamma	“Oh, they’ll excommunicate us—they’ll excommunicate us, the Swami will excommunicate us,” she said, and she rolled on the floor of her house while [MASK] stood by the door, helpless as a calf. 4
<name>Gunga</name>	Gunga	Himavathy	And I know that in our good village there is no Brahmin who has drunk of our holy [MASK]’s water and wants caste pollutions. I shall speak to our people,’ say I. And that is why I have come to see you.”
<name>Odysseus</name>	Odysseus	Rangamma	Oh what?” but the swell bubbled out by the pyre and [MASK] gave a sigh, and when the body was ashed down whole and only a few cinders lay blinking behind the bones, a huge swell churned round the hill and swept the bones and ashes away.
<name>I</name>	I	Ratna?”—"I	we exclaimed,—“Yes, since the pact with the Viceroy many a prisoner has been released.”—“And when is he coming here, [MASK] don’t know, aunt, for he says —well, I’ll read to you his letter.” And she read the letter.

<name>Yata</name>	Yata	Brahma	They have come to hind us and to whip us, to make our women die milkless and our men die ignorant. O [MASK], deign to send us one of your gods so that he may incarnate himself on earth and bring back light and plenty to your enslaved daughter . .
<name>Raman</name>	Raman	Mada	He likes the sumptuous smell of cardamoms and his home is amongst them. That’s why all these cardamom-garden coolies wear, you know, a slab thin as a cloth on their heads. There was that fellow [MASK] who died leaving three children and a yelling wife.
<name>Tim</name>	Tim	Narsamma	They gaveTiim food by the kitchen door as [MASK] did, and he still went to the Pariahs, and he still gave them cotton to spin and yarn to weave, and he taught them alphabets and grammar and arithmetic and Hindi, and now my Seenu, too, was going to go with him.
<name>Rikki</name>	Rikki	Subba	and the_ plough cuts the earth and spatters the clods, and the farther they go the lighter does it cut.

<name>sister</name>	sister	Nanjamma	Ready to fight without moving a hair?’ and if you say, ‘Yes, sister,’ you will come with us, and if you say, ‘No,’ we shall say, ‘That does not matter, our [MASK] is only afraid,’ ”
<name>Indra</name>	Indra	Kenchamma	May our hearts be touched by their light! May [MASK] protect us! The next morning, with bell and camphor and trumpet, we planted our trophies before the temple. Five twigs of toddy trees were there, and a toddy pot.
<name>Ramanujan</name>	Ramanujan	Moorthy	And why not? He was so brilliant in school, and he was so deferential in his ways. And they began to ask for his horoscope when he was hardly sixteen. But [MASK] would have none of this.
<name>Simpleton</name>	Simpleton	Surappa	And they all cried out and said: “Oh, [MASK], you had better tell those tales to whitewashed walls. Nobody who has eyes to see and ears to hear will believe in such a crow-and-sparrow story. It was a passing policeman.
<name>Ratan</name>	Ratan	Moorthy	We shall have closed our eyes. So, he goes, [MASK], from house to house, from householder to householder, and—what do you think?—he gathers a hundred and forty-seven rupees. Everybody says, “Take it, my son.”
<name>Are</name>	Are	Are_they	I will go and eat with them if necessary. Why not? [MASK] not men like us. And the Swami, who is he? A self-chosen fool. He may be learned in the Vedas and all that. But he has no heart.
<name>Yankel</name>	Yankel	Vasudev	And [MASK] says, ‘‘In the Estate he spits and beats everyone. Already he has moved down to the hut by the main gate, and he and his dog and his woman keep guard over everyone that crosses the stile.
<name>Ram</name>	Ram	Kanthamma	Do I know how to decipher your hooks or your papers? You will say ‘This is the paper, [MASK].’ And I shall put my thumb-mark on it.”—In a week’s time the papers are ready.
<name>Swamiji</name>	Swamiji	Sankar	and somebody cries out again, “Ah, our religion is going to be desecrated by you youngsters!” and [MASK] says, “Brother, if you have anything to say, please come up to the platform,” and the man says, “And you will allow me to speak?”
<name>Swami</name>	Swami	Rangamma	to which he replies, “The fault of others, l [MASK], is the fruit of one’s own disharmony,” and silently he walks down the steps, and walks up to the temple, where, seated beside the central pillar of the mandap, he begins to meditate.
<name>Kabir</name>	Kabir	Hari	And if you send elephants to kill me, the elephants will stand by and say, ‘This is [MASK]’s child,’ and lift me up with their trunks and seat me on their backs and throw a garland round my neck.
<name>Amrita</name>	Amrita	Ratna	and she says she is frightened; but [MASK], who is by her, says, “Be strong, sister. When your husband beats you, you do not hit back, do you? You only grumble and weep. The policeman's beating are the like!”
<name>Govindan</name>	Govindan	Moorthy	[MASK] said his gayatri thrice a thousand and eight times, and when the sanctum lights began to flicker he spread out his upper cloth on the floor and laid himself down.

<name>wife</name>	wife	Seenu	“Yes,” say I, though a rupee was a lot to me. I have seven acres of wet land and twelve acres of dry land and they yield just enough for my [MASK] and me to have our three meals a day. A rupee!
<name>Surya</name>	Surya	Nanjamma	And one day [MASK] came and said, “Sisters, last night I dreamt my husband was beating me and beating me, and I was crying and my bangles broke and I was saying, ‘Oh, why does he beat men with a stick and not with his hands?’
<name>Ratna</name>	Ratna	Moorthappa	You just pay four annas or two thousands yards of yarn per year, and that is all you have to do, and then you become a Congress member. And you must vow to speak truth, and wear no cloth but the khadi cloth.” “Oh yes, [MASK]!
<name>Anand</name>	Anand	Moorthy	And, during the first month, the cotton is given free.” - “May I ask one thing, [MASK]? How much has one to pay?” “Nothing, sister. I tell you the Congress gives it free.”

<name>Sevi</name>	Sevi	Radhamma	And every time the milk curdled or a dhoti was not dry, they would say, “And this is all because of this Sevi business,” and [MASK]’s husband beat her on that day he returned from village inspection, though she was seven months pregnant.
<name>Nyai</name>	Nyai	Rangi	We haven’t swallowed it all,’ you say. But [MASK] knows the truth, and when the rainy season comes and there’s little rice to eat, she will pass by your door and spit three times at you in the name of her children.

<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ratna	But he had caught a little of that primordial radiance, and through every breath more and more love seemed to pour out of him. That was why, when [MASK] came to see him, he felt there was something different in his feelings toward her.
<name>Ramachandra</name>	Ramachandra	Ramanna	Such grass-rings and such leaf-cups too! Never has anything better been seen. And it was so pleasant to hear him hum away at the Gita. The very walls could have repeated it all. [MASK] is the Second Brahmin. He would come along before noon.
<name>Anjaneya</name>	Anjaneya	Kenchamma	He had poetry on his tongue, sister. And he could keep us sitting for hours together. And how we regretted the evening the Sankara-jayanthi was over. The air looked empty. But by [MASK]’s grace it did not end there.
<name>Subramani</name>	Subramani	Bhatta	_[MASK] is the First Brahmin, He would be there before it is hardly eleven—his fresh clothes, his magnificent ashes and all—and seated on the veranda he would begin to make the obsequial grass-rings. Such grass-rings and such leaf-cups too!
<name>Raman</name>	Raman	Ramayya	Then, as he is just by a flowering aloe, what should rattle up but a huge cobra as long as this—that the bicycle-wheel had run down. [MASK] cried out, ‘Ayyo . . . Ayyoo . . .’ and ran away.
<name>Savitri</name>	Savitri	Ratna	[MASK] would beat her clothes on the riverstones, beat them and wet them and squeeze them, and packing them up, she would hurry back from the river alone—all alone across the fields and the lantana growth.
<name>Kasturba</name>	Kasturba	Narsamma	And when he has eaten his meal, he goes and washes himself at the well, and [MASK] munches her food alone in the kitchen, while tears run down her cheeks. “Oh, this Gandhi! Would he were destroyed!”

<name>Appanna</name>	Appanna	Bhatta	Yes, yes, sister, we are toddy people! But we don’t marry our daughters to gap-toothed sons-in-law. Nor like [MASK] do we go on Kashi-pilgrimage with toddy contract money. Do we? 15
<name>Seenu</name>	Seenu	Siva	[MASK] am I.” Then he sat himself down by the central pillar and slipped back into meditation. Why was it he could meditate so deeply? Thoughts seemed to ebb away to the darkened shores and leave the illumined consciousness to rise up into the back of the brain, he had explained tcTSeenu.
<name>Yama</name>	Yama	Seethamma	And we hurried through the central hall, and we rushed to the veranda to see [MASK]’s courtyard, where beds and bells and broomsticks lay strewn everywhere, and across the byre walls children were heard weeping; and we said, “Let’s slip past
<name>Ramanuja</name>	Ramanuja	Bhatta	The children are playing in the shadow, by the byre, and the elderly people are all in the side room, waiting for the holy brahmins to finish their meal. But [MASK] goes on munching and belching, drinking water and then munching again.
<name>Kamala</name>	Kamala	Puttamma	But we said, “No, no, [MASK], the gods will forgive you,” but she broke into sobs, and her mother-in-law came and threw water over her face, and cooled her down.
<name>Brahma</name>	Brahma	Brahma	But, O [MASK], you who sent us the prince propagators of the holy law and sages that smote the darkness of ignorance, you have forgotten us so long that men have come from across the seas and the oceans to trample on our wisdom and to spit on virtue itself.
<name>Napoleon</name>	Napoleon	Moorthy	The policeman's beating are the like!” and we say, “So they are.” And we begin to get more and more familiar with it. And we say that in a week, in ten days’ time, [MASK] will say, “March!”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Rangamma	Never. Never.” And as she began to unroll her bundle, something came up from her stomach to her throat, and she burst out sobbing. She sat herself down and she began to sob. Meanwhile [MASK] and her mother came along to the river.
<name>Ramanujan</name>	Ramanujan	Bhatta	One day, when [MASK] was returning from the river after his evening ablutions, he did not turn at the Mari-temple corner, but went straight along the Lantana lane and hurried up the steps of the Kannayya house.
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Timma	"Oh! fine, fine! I’ve come to bring you [MASK], a man with a family and children, and I said to him, I’ll drop a word in your ear. He and his ancestors have cultivated our fields for generations. . .

<name>Rukmani</name>	Rukmani	Moorthy	And the maistri comes to pull them off and whips them, and the women fall on the maistri and tear his hair, while [MASK] cries out, “No beatings, sisters. No beatings, in the name of the Mahatma.”
<name>Raman</name>	Raman	Sankar	You are our eldest son, and you have to give us at least a grandson so that when we are dead our manes will be satisfied,” but [MASK] smiled back again and said, “If you want the marriage thread to be tied in an ocean of tears, I shall.
<name>Alina</name>	Alina	Kenchamma	Tell me, how could this happen, if it were not for [MASK] and her battle? Thank heaven, not only did she slay the demon, but she even settled down among us, and this much I shall say, never has she failed us in our grief.
<name>Vasily</name>	Vasily	Bhatta	“What is all this city chatter about?’’ he would say; “we’ve had enough trouble in the city. And we do not want any such annoyances here. . . .” To tell you the truth, [MASK] began all this after his last visit to the city.
<name>Rama</name>	Rama	Moorthy	So [MASK] says, “As you will,” and taking the Ganges water he feels a fresher breath flowing through him, and lest anyone should ask about his new adventure, he goes to the riverside after dinner to sit and think and pray.
<name>Ratan</name>	Ratan	Narsamma	And the Swami, who is he? A self-chosen fool. He may be learned in the Vedas and all that. But he has no heart. He has no thinking power.’ And what shall I say to that, [MASK]?”
<name>Yakov</name>	Yakov	Moorthy	and she spat into the street. And, as everybody knew, she had no particular love for [MASK]. He had refused her second daughter, for whom bridegroom after bridegroom was being sought—and she was nearing the age. And then there was that other affair.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Siddayya	“Oh, it’s the fever of this country,” [MASK] explained. "It’s always like this. It harms no one. It comes every two days and goes away, and when you know it better, you can work with it as well as any.”
<name>Arjuna</name>	Arjuna	Rangamma	He looked a veritable Dharmaraja. And [MASK] told us never a man smiled more and sang more at home than he, and he was always the earliest to rise and the last to go to bed, yet he was always in the best of health.
<name>Therese</name>	Therese	Moorthy	and [MASK] answered, “Pray with me that the sins of others may be purified with our prayers.” She could hardly grasp his idea. She was but fifteen. Praying seemed merely to fall flat before the gods in worship.
<name>Ratan</name>	Ratan	Bhatta	“What else would they do?” [MASK] goes straight into his room, opens his casket and the two rupees have gone in. He knows how much there is in it. Something around three hundred and fifty rupees.

<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Rangamma	“Lemon water and gymnastics, gymnastics and lemon water, can keep the plague at the doorstep,” he used to say, and to tell you the truth, never had [MASK] looked so healthy and serene as she did then.
<name>Subhadra</name>	Subhadra	Rangamma	But the coolness in his empty stomach made him shiver. Then a warmth rose in his veins and he felt strength streaming into his limbs. [MASK] again tried to persuade him to eat a little—"just not to be too weak, for even the dharma sastras permit it,” she said.
<name>Ratan</name>	Ratan	will.my_son	No. Never [MASK] bring dishonour to his family. He has promised me. No dishonour to his family. Never. Never.” And as she began to unroll her bundle, something came up from her stomach to her throat, and she burst out sobbing.
<name>Ronny</name>	Ronny	Moorthy	“Policemen do not come along like that in these civilized days,” she mocked. “I know why they’ve come. They’ve come because of [MASK] and all this Gandhi affair. He with his kitchen she-friends and all this bragging city-talk!”
<name>Ram</name>	Ram	Moorthy	A rupee! It was a twenty-fifth of my revenue, and tell me, when did we ever pay it in time? But_the rupee is for the gods. ^And it is [MASK] that asks for it. We always bless him.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Ratna	There is no more charging now, but a^continuous firing comes down from the Bebbur mound. The moon still shines and with it the winking light of the Skeffington Coffee Estate. There is a long silence. We’re in the big field. Where is [MASK]?
<name>Mowgli</name>	Mowgli	Siddayya	But “Don’t bother to swallow them,” explained [MASK]. “They are as bitter as the neem-leaves and the fever will come just the same. The sahib says that in his country they are always used for fever.
<name>Lenin</name>	Lenin	Sankar	She was nearing forty, but she looked hardly thirty-three, and there was not a grey hair on her head. And she would work, too, then, she could talk and write and hold classes and sometimes she even went, they said, to meetings with [MASK].
<name>Ram</name>	Ram	Moorthy	“AH right, my son. And how should we pay?” We know [MASK] had been to the city and he knew of things we did not know. And yet he was as honest as an elephant. “One rupee, aunt. Just one rupee.
<name>Kenchamma</name>	Kenchamma	Goddess	ernment wants to eat up the food of our ancestors,” and everybody, as they passed by the Kenchamma grove, cried out, “[MASK], when the demon came to eat our babes and rape our daughters, you came down to destroy him and protect us.

<name>Raman</name>	Raman	Vasudev	Inside the house of [MASK] is seen a faint oil-light, and his widowed mother is seen to serve him his evening meal. The brass vessels shimmer and shake, and then there is only the long, moving shadow on the wall.
<name>Esteban</name>	Esteban	Moorthy	And when she had taken her bath and came back home telling her beads, she felt the sands and the grass and the shadows so familiar that she went straight to the kitchen and began to cook as usual. But where was [MASK]? He would come.
<name>Ramu</name>	Ramu	Moorthy	How far will you finance my studies?—I want to have this degree and that degree.’ Degrees. Degrees. Nothing but degrees or this Gandhi vagabondage. When there are boys like [MASK], whcT should get safely married and settle down, they begin this Gandhi business.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Moorthy	He had refused her second daughter, for whom bridegroom after bridegroom was being sought—and she was nearing the age. And then there was that other affair. [MASK] was so often at the “next-house-woman’s kitchen,” as she used to say.
<name>Yashoda</name>	Yashoda	Alur	and she sends messengers to [MASK] to inform her gap-toothed son-in-law of the nuptial ceremony, and the next morning at the river she says, “I want my daughter to go to her husband’s house soon.
<name>Moonface</name>	Moonface	Siva	But someone would be chanting away, and clapping away, and through half-wakened eyes [MASK] would be seen, staring and weird, and such terror would come over us that we would rub our eyes and sing again.
<name>Ananda</name>	Ananda	Rangamma	But [MASK] simply said, “My paper says nothing about that,” and continued measuring the unhusked rice. Oh, she told us so many, many interesting things—and all came from these white and blue papers, sister!
