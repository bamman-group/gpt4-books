<name>the</name> (There is no proper name that fits in this context. The sentence is referring to a location or object, not a person.)	the (There is no proper name that fits in this context. The sentence is referring to a location or object, not a person.)	Narciso	Perhaps if I had been closer to [MASK] what happened would not have happened, or perhaps we would both be dead. I heard a pistol shot just ahead of me. I paused and listened for the report that always follows a shot, but the screaming wind muffled it.
<name>Boo</name>	Boo	Tenorio	I knew that if I stayed on the road back to my uncles’ fields that I would be trapped and [MASK] would run me down, so as I felt the hot breath of the horse on my neck I jumped to the side and rolled down the embankment.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Juan	You must choose what you will do as a grown man, but if you ever decide to become a farmer you will be welcomed here. This earth that was your mother’s will be yours—” I wanted to thank him, but as I started to respond my uncle [MASK] came hurrying towards us.
<name>John</name>	John	Marez	“You walk on my land! That is my business!” my father shouted. “We do not want to quarrel with you, [MASK]; it is the old witch we want. Give her to us and we will take her away.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ultima	And always [MASK] was near me, caring for every turn I made in the progress of that hideous journey. It was a long night during which the nightmares, like a herd of wild horses, trampled through my fevered mind.
<name>Chief</name>	Chief	Samuel	I grew dizzy. The weight of the jackets on me was heavy and suffocating. “All right!” I cried to appease them, “I shall be your priest!” I looked at [MASK]. He had turned away. “Yea-aaaaaaaaye!”
<name>had</name>	had	Marez	I had heard a story told in whispers not meant for my ears that once, long ago, my father’s father had taken a priest from the church and beaten him on the street for preaching against something my grandfather [MASK] had done.
<name>Ahab</name>	Ahab	Cico	The spear whistled through the air, but the aim was low. The huge tail swished and contemptuously flipped it aside. Then the black form dropped into the foaming waters. “Missed,” [MASK] groaned. He retrieved his line slowly. I nodded my head.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Tellez	“Aiiiiiiiie,” [MASK] groaned, “it is the devil dancing on my roof—” His body twisted to the crescendo of the fearful drum beat. But almost as quickly as it had begun the noise stopped and the dark cloud moved away.
<name>Macbeth</name>	Macbeth	Lucas	“Well, you know [MASK]. He could see the evil one himself and not be convinced. He thought the three witches were three old dirty women who deserved a Christian lashing, tongue or otherwise, so he stepped forth from behind the tree that hid him and he challenged them!”
<name>Antonito</name>	Antonito	Death	I had prayed that it would be alive, but the blood had almost stopped flowing. [MASK] was carrying it away in its cart. My uncle handed me a blanket from the truck and I wrapped the owl in it. “jAntonito!
<name>Leon</name>	Leon	Gabriel	“[MASK]! They have just returned—” my mother said. “Well,” my father shrugged, “I don’t mean tonight, maybe in a month or two, right boys?” My brothers glanced nervously at each other and nodded. “jLeon!
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Ffo	On the path that led to the bridge lived huge, fat Fib and his beautiful wife. [MASK] and my father worked together on the highway. They were good drinking friends. “jJason!” I called at the kitchen door. I had run hard and was panting.
<name>Antonio</name>	Antonio	Cico	“The magic people all know about the coming day of the golden carp,” [MASK] answered. His bright eyes twinkled. “Do you know how Narciso plants?” he asked. “No,” I answered. I had always thought farmers were sober men.
<name>Old Man Warner</name>	Old Man Warner	Narciso	The coroner’s jury that gathered under the juniper tree found the cause of death to be accidental or self-inflicted, then they hurried away from the cold to the warmth of their homes. Because [MASK] was the town drunk, nobody cared much.
<name>Aunt Lally</name>	Aunt Lally	Ultima	“There is no fever,” [MASK] whispered to me, “you are strong. The blood of the Lunas is very thick in you—” Her hand was cool, like the fresh air of a summer night. My uncle groaned and thrashed about in his bed.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Gene	“Like hell,” [MASK] scowled. He pulled away from us and sat by himself. My mother said he was like that, a loner, a man who did not like to show his feelings. We all understood that.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Florence	The priest was calling from the church steps, so they ran off to confession. I slowly picked myself up and rubbed the bruises on my chest. [MASK] handed me my shirt and jacket. “You should have given me a penance,” he said.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jason	There was no trace of what had happened. The sun shone white and clean, and there was chill in the air. I ran to [MASK]’s and asked him to feed the animals for me while we were gone.
<name>God</name>	God	Ultima	y el Espiritu Santo—” I felt [MASK]’s hand on my head and at the same time I felt a great force, like a whirlwind, swirl about me. I looked up in fright, thinking the wind would knock me off my knees.
<name>Uncle Axel</name>	Uncle Axel	Chavez	From where I stood I could look up into the flooding beams of light that were pointed down by the excited men. I could hear them giving frenzied, shouted instructions. I looked to my left where the bridge started and saw my father and [MASK] running towards the excitement at the center of the bridge.
<name>Pablo</name>	Pablo	Tellez	[MASK] gathered the other Mexicans around him and they hanged the three Indians. They left the bodies strung on a tree; they did not bury them according to their custom. Consequently, the three souls were left to wander on that ranch.
<name>hands</name>	hands	Theresa	She held trembling [MASK]. “It is all right,” she reassured them, “it is over.” “Take them to their room,” I said to my mother. It was the first time I had ever spoken to my mother as a man; she nodded and obeyed.
<name>jjodido</name> (There is no proper name that fits the description given in the prompt, so the answer is the word that appears in the sentence.)	jjodido (There is no proper name that fits the description given in the prompt, so the answer is the word that appears in the sentence.)	Tenorio	one of the men screamed, and I recognized the evil voice of [MASK]. My blood ran cold. They tumbled into the snow like two drunken bears, kicking and striking at each other, and their cries and curses filled the air. “jjodido!”
<name>Dora</name>	Dora	Ultima	But [MASK] was more alert than I. With a nimble sidestep and a pull she jerked me from the path of the black horse and rider that went crashing by us. The rider that had almost run us down disappeared into the swirling dust.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Ultima	She had cleaned a small spot on the icy window. I looked out and saw a white countryside, desolate except where ripples of blue broke the snowdrifts. “The girls will not go to school today,” she said to [MASK], “what’s one day.
<name>Francis</name>	Francis	Narciso	The doctor told my mother I had had pneumonia and that I was to get as much rest as possible. As I regained my strength I learned what had happened. My father had found the body of [MASK], frozen stiff under the juniper tree.
<name>She</name>	She	Andrew	“As long as you are safe, who cares about a car. He wanted to come home to see his mother!” she beamed. “But the car’s not too badly damaged?” [MASK] asked. “Burned!”
<name>him</name>	him	Lloyd	Perhaps I had not prepared right. I opened my eyes. On the altar the priest was cleaning the chalice and the platters. The mass was ending, the fleeting mystery was already vanishing. “Did you feel anything?” I urgently asked [MASK] and clutched his arm.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Andrew	my mother asked, “I thought today was your day off at the store—” “It is,” [MASK] answered, “just going to pick up my check.” “And see your girl,” my mother smiled.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Leon	“Well let’s not just sit around and talk about it, let’s do it! Let’s cut out! Move!” “I can see the action now,” [MASK] rubbed his hands, “money, booze, women—” “Yeah!
<name>Melanie</name>	Melanie	Ultima	In the bell tower the pigeons cou-rouing made a mournful sound. The priest was by us now. I could smell the incense trapped in his frock, like the fragrance of [MASK]’s herbs was part of her clothes. I bowed my head.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Grande	“Yes, [MASK],” my mother nodded, “it’s just that he is so small—the last one to leave me—” I thought she would cry all over again. “Go and wash, and comb,” she said simply.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Samuel	“It will only end when blood is spilled,” [MASK] said. “My father says that the blood of a man thickens with the desire for revenge, and if a man is to be complete again then he must let some of that thick blood flow—” We stopped and it was very quiet.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Gabriel	And then I knew her eyes glanced briefly at my father. “[MASK], we cannot let her live her last days in loneliness—” “No,” my father agreed, “it is not the way of our people.”
<name>Mrs. Hudson</name>	Mrs. Hudson	Gabriel	“You know, [MASK],” she said to my father, “I am getting old. Perhaps this would be the best burial you could provide me—” She peered into the dying fire and smiled. I could see that she was very tired.
<name>God</name>	God	Ultima	I saw very little of [MASK], or even of my mother and father. I was concerned with myself. I knew that eternity lasted forever, and a soul because of one mistake could spend that eternity in hell. The knowledge of this was frightful.
<name>John</name>	John	Florence	“Confess! Confess!” they cried. Then with one powerful heave and a groan [MASK] shook off his tormentors. He was long and sinewy, but because of his mild manner we had always underestimated his strength.
<name>Baba</name>	Baba	Ultima	the man who would not face us snarled. “Give me your face,” [MASK] demanded. “Have you not the strength to face an old woman? Why do you keep your back ?»» The thin, hunched body jumped up and spun around.
<name>Antonio</name>	Antonio	Narciso	I had seen and reveled in the beauty of the golden carp! Oh God! my soul groaned and I thought that it would burst and I would die huddled against the evil house. How had I sinned? “dQuien? Who? Ah, [MASK], you!”
<name>Uncle Axel</name>	Uncle Axel	Gabriel	“Yes, it is time, [MASK],” my mother said, and I noticed she touched him gently. “Yes,” my father answered, “so it is. Be respectful to your teachers,” he said to us.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Rosie	His inquiring, angelic face smiled. “And my sisters are whores, working at [MASK]’s place—” The wind swirled around us and made a strange noise, like the sound of doves crying at the river.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Florence	His wild eyes just stared at us as we pulled [MASK] on the sand. I looked across the lake and saw the high school boys pointing excitedly toward us. Some were already convinced something was wrong and were sprinting up the path. They would be here in seconds.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Ultima	“jMira! Que suerte, tunas,” [MASK] cried with joy and pointed to the ripe-red prickly pears of the nopal. ‘‘Run and gather some and we will eat them in the shade by the river.”
<name>I</name>	I	Eugene	She breathed a prayer and crossed her forehead. The flour left white stains on her, the four points of the cross. I knew it was because my three brothers were at war that she was sad, and [MASK] was the youngest.
<name>Colonel</name>	Colonel	Reynaldo	“Get your rifle, we must go to the bridge—” “The bridge?” “[MASK] said to meet him there—The crazy bastard has taken to the river—” My father nodded silently. He went to the bedroom and returned with his coat.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Toni	“[MASK]-eeee!” someone called. I broke into a run and didn’t stop until I got home. When I got home my mother was very angry with me. I had never been late before.
<name>Toni</name>	Toni	Andrew	“Toni-eeee the giant killer—” he smiled and whizzed by. “Never beat him!” [MASK] gasped at the end of the bridge. “Nobody, can, beat, him,” I panted hard. “I swear, he sleeps, under the bridge!”
<name>The Swede</name>	The Swede	Chavez	[MASK] laughed. “This is the only talk he will understand—” he turned and fired over the railing of the bridge. His shots roared then whined away down the river. I could hear the bullets make splashing noises in the water. “Wait!”
<name>Eurydice</name>	Eurydice	Ultima	She disappeared. I heard the owl singing outside, and I heard its whirling wings. I saw its wise face and fluttering wings at the window—then [MASK] was by me. Her feet were wet with the clay-earth of the valley.
<name>my mother</name>	my mother	Ultima	She only wished for strength and health within the person she blessed. “Your father is waiting,” my mother said as we rose. Then I did something I had never done before. I reached up and kissed [MASK].
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Chavez	“He is an animal! He has to be shot!” [MASK] cried out. “jSf!” the men agreed. “Now wait a moment—” It was my father who spoke. I do not know what he said because of the shouting.
<name>him</name>	him	Florence	“Kill him!” They circled around me and advanced on [MASK], their eyes flashing with the thought of the punishment they would impose on the non-believer. It was then that the fear left me, and I knew what I had to do.
<name>Jem</name>	Jem	Tony	“There is freedom here.” “Try putting that in the lunch pails of your children!” “[MASK] goes to school today, huh?” he said. “Yes. And you must talk to him.” “He will be all right.”
<name>The man</name>	The man	Horse	“How long has it been since your last confession?” I asked [MASK]. “Always,” he blurted out, “since I was born!” “What are your sins?” I asked. I felt hot and uncomfortable under the weight of the jackets.
<name>Antonio</name>	Antonio	Tony	I exclaimed. He smiled and stood up. “The golden carp is my god, [MASK]. He will rule the new waters. I will be happy to be with my god—” It was unbelievable, and yet it made a wild kind of sense!
<name>Beavis</name>	Beavis	Hell	They were the dumbest kids in school, but they never missed a single day. [MASK] could freeze over but they would still come marching across the tracks, wrestling, kicking at each other, stomping into the classrooms where they fidgeted nervously all day and made things miserable for their teachers.
<name>John</name>	John	Narciso	I could hear laughter inside. Something told me to flee the house of the naked women, and another thought whispered for me to stay and know the awful truth. I felt paralyzed. “I did not come for pleasure, whore!” [MASK] roared.
<name>She</name>	She	Jason	I asked. She pointed towards the river, northwest, past the railroad tracks to the dark hills. The river came through those hills and there were old Indian grounds there, holy burial grounds [MASK] told me. There in an old cave lived his Indian.
<name>Enrique</name>	Enrique	Horse	He’s cold and heavy, like death—” “jChingada!” [MASK] muttered and turned away. I dropped to my knees beside the bronzed, wet body. I touched his forehead. It was cold. His hair was matted with moss and water.
<name>Zoroaster</name>	Zoroaster	Cico	The cosmic struggle of the two forces would destroy everything! The doom which [MASK] had predicted was upon us! I clasped my hands and knelt to pray. The terrifying end was near. Then I heard a voice speak above the sound of the storm.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Ultima	The moaning of the wind and the cries of the animals outside mixed into the thin smoke of incense and the fragrance of pinon wood burning in the stove. At one time [MASK] was gone a long time. She disappeared. I heard the owl singing outside, and I heard its whirling wings.
<name>Dracula</name>	Dracula	Ultima	Then my dream-fate drew me to the coffin. I peered in and to my horror I saw [MASK]! I must have cried in my sleep, because I felt someone pick me up, and after that I felt warm and was at peace.
<name>George</name>	George	Lupito	Now we have this bad business to settle. But we are friends who will help you—” I saw [MASK]’s tense body shake. A low, sad mournful cry tore itself from his throat and mixed into the lapping sound of the waters of the river.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Theresa	We prayed rosary after rosary, until the monotonous sound of prayers blended into the blur of flickering altar candles. We prayed until our faith passed into an exhaustion that numbed us to sleep. The first to fall asleep was [MASK], and my father quietly got up and took her to bed.
<name>my dad</name>	my dad	Jason	“I know,” he said. “So last summer I fished. Sometimes with [MASK].” “You have a lot to learn—” “Yes,” I answered. The afternoon sun was warm on the sand.
<name>Satan</name>	Satan	Florence	Inevitably it was he whom I saw burning in the roaring inferno of eternal damnation. But why? I questioned the hissing fires, [MASK] knows all the answers! But he does not accept, the flames lisped back.
<name>Stephen's</name>	Stephen's	Cico	“Bah,” she laughed, “I have many ways to keep me safe— Now promise you will tell no one about this.” She tucked the scapular under my shirt. “I promise,” I answered. Another thing I did that summer was to confirm [MASK]’s story.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Horse	“I got a better sin than [MASK]! Bless me, father! Bless me, father! Bless me, father!” he repeated. He kept making the sign of the cross over and over. “I got a sin! I got to confess!
<name>Grandmother</name>	Grandmother	Ultima	I smelled it and its fragrance was sweet. “A small pouch of helpful herbs,” [MASK] smiled, “I have had that since I was a child. It will keep you safe.” “But what will you use?” I asked.
<name>Abigail</name>	Abigail	Narciso	“Old woman with a hot tail for gossip!” [MASK] retorted. Both men stood trembling with rage, but they would not clash again. I think they both realized that a second encounter would mean death to one of them. The three men did not have to hold them anymore.
<name>El Mono</name>	El Mono	Did’jew	I went low and came up yanking at his left leg. With a hard pull I flipped the Horse on his back. “jHiii-jo-lah!” “;Ah la veca!” “[MASK] see that, the kid threw the Horse!”
<name>Red</name>	Red	Tenorio	I had not thought of [MASK] all summer even though the man lived on the black mesa down the river and had his saloon in town, but now he was here again, plotting to bring another tragedy into my life.
<name>Abuela</name>	Abuela	Ultima	[MASK] laughed. “Oh those Trementina girls will be cut and bruised tomorrow,” she said. “But I have much work to do,” she spoke to herself now. She tucked me into the blankets and then burned more incense in the room.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Deborah	“We must pray to the Virgin,” my mother said, and although [MASK] objected, saying nobody prayed for a grade promotion, my mother gathered us around the Virgin’s altar. My father arrived home late from work and was hungry.
<name>Dr. John Watson</name>	Dr. John Watson	Ultima	“Au-ggggggggh! Ai-eeee!” He cried in pain. [MASK] was immediately at his side, holding him so that he would not tumble from the bed. His body convulsed with the spasms of a madman, and his face contorted with pain.
<name>son</name>	son	Tony	“No,” he chuckled. “Will you become a priest?” I held my breath. He laughed. Then he stopped, put his hand on my shoulder, and said, “Look, [MASK], I know what you’re thinking about.
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Narciso	Tonight a mad animal crawled behind him and took his life. You call that reason! That animal has to be destroyed!” “jSf! jSf!” the men shouted in unison. “At least let us try to talk to him,” [MASK] begged.
<name>Two-Bit</name>	Two-Bit	Horse	“I had to recite the Apostles’ Creed and tell what each part meant, and I had to explain where we get original sin—” “jOh si!” “jAh la veca!” “jChingada!” “Bullshit!” [MASK] spit out the grass he had been chewing.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Samuel	“And if you eat one,” I whispered, “you might be punished like they were punished.” “I don’t know,” [MASK] said. He rose and took my fishing line. “Is that all the story?” I asked.
<name>Uncle Frank</name>	Uncle Frank	Serrano	I was very frightened. Finally we could open the tailgate of the truck and let the cow out. Immediately the massive weight of the bull was on her, humping her down, my father and [MASK] were laughing and slapping their knees. They laughed until their eyes watered.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Horse	No one was allowed to swim along the wall because the water was very deep and full of thick weeds, and because the lifeguard was on the other side. But as we came up the gentle slope we heard the shouts of swimmers. I recognized [MASK] and the others shouting and waving at us.
<name>Medusa</name>	Medusa	Tenorio	I know that your daughters gathered the cut hair, and with that they worked their evil work!” It was more than the three men could stand. They were frightened. They lowered their eyes to avert [MASK]’s gaze and scurried for the door.
<name>Old Man</name>	Old Man	Eugene	Do not enter, I cried. It is written on the waters of the river that you shall lose your souls to hell if you enter! Bah! [MASK] scowled, you heat your breast like a holy-roller, hut you too will find your way here.
<name>the person speaking</name>	the person speaking	Florence	I wanted to call out that I was not afraid. “My father says the weather comes in cycles,” I said instead, “there are years of good weather, and there are years of bad weather—” “I don’t understand,” [MASK] said.
<name>Galadriel</name>	Galadriel	Ultima	[MASK] remained motionless. “Evil is not easy to destroy,” she said, “one needs all the help one can get.” She looked at me and her gaze made me step forward. “The boy will have to go with me,” she whispered.
<name>Darry</name>	Darry	Leon	“You were so small those air hammers just tossed the three of you around like rag dolls—” Tears streamed from his eyes. “Yeah, those were great times,” [MASK] said vigorously. His blue, melancholy eyes lit up.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Ultima	It was thin and drawn, with tufts of beard growing on it. The eyes were dark and narrow. An evil glint emanated from them. The thin lips trembled when he snarled, “Because you are a bruja!” Spots of saliva curled at the edges of the mouth. [MASK] laughed.
<name>Mother Teresa</name>	Mother Teresa	Ultima	For us [MASK] personified goodness, and any risk in defense of goodness was right. She was the only person I had ever seen defeat evil where all else had failed. That sympathy for people my father said she possessed had overcome all obstacles.
<name>Blackie</name>	Blackie	Lupito	What I saw made my blood run cold. Crouched in the reeds and half submerged in the muddy waters lay the Figure of [MASK], the man who had killed the sheriff. The glint of light was from the pistol he held in his hand.
<name>He</name>	He	Antonio	She looked at me and her gaze made me step forward. “The boy will have to go with me,” she whispered. “What?” My mother was startled. “[MASK] must go with me.
<name>Tony</name>	Tony	Chingada	[MASK] I will! I can be the worst cabron in the world, and when I’m ninety-nine I can be sorry for being such a culo, and I go to heaven— You know, it doesn’t seem fair—”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Florence	the lifeguard cursed back. “I’ve told you guys a hundred times not to swim here! Two years I’ve had a perfect record here—now this!” He continued pushing down on [MASK]’s back and the white froth continued to flow from his mouth.
<name>Orpheus</name>	Orpheus	Ultima	We waited. A strange singing, a low chanting song emanated from the house all day long. Finally, at dusk when the nightjars and bats began to fly and the setting sun had passed from orange to gray. [MASK] came through the front door of the house.
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Samuel	“It is a sin to catch them,” [MASK] said, “it is a worse offense to eat them. They are a part of the people.” He pointed towards the middle of the river where two huge back fins rose out of the water and splashed upstream.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Horse	“For your penance say a rosary to the Virgin,” I said weakly. I didn’t feel good. The weight of the jackets was making me sweat, and the revelation of [MASK]’s confession and the way the kids were acting was making me sick.
<name>Abuela</name>	Abuela	Ultima	“I do not mind,” I answered, “I want to help.” “And if people say you walk in the footsteps of a curandera, will you be ashamed?” “No, I will be proud, [MASK],” I said emphatically.
<name>Florence</name>	Florence	Ultima	I could see in his eyes that he knew he was a man again, a man returned from a living hell. [MASK] helped him lie down. She washed him and then fed him his first meal in weeks. He ate like a starved animal.
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Ultima	“Now touch it,” she would say. The leaves were smooth and light green. For [MASK], even the plants had a spirit, and before I dug she made me speak to the plant and tell it why we pulled it from its home in the earth.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Lucas	Hie! Hie! They cried and danced, through your body went the spell that cured [MASK], and your name lent strength to the curse that took one of us from the service of our Master. We will have our vengeance on you, their voices crackled.
