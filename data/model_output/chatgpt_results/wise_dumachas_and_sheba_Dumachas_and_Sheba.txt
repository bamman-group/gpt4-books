<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Claudia	Keep in mind what we have, and to just think about it. All right, my dear?” [MASK] remained staring blandly at her husband. “Will you do that? Will you do that for us? Will you think about it. . .
<name>Livia</name>	Livia	Julia	After squeezing her large breasts, the Roman ran his hand up and down her legs, and then finally began to finger the slave—pushing his index finger in and out of her. This brought [MASK]’s nausea on perhaps a little sooner than it should have, and she began to gag.
<name>Jordan</name>	Jordan	Sheba	“Why don’t you sleep with him sometime, and maybe it’ll give you a hint.” “You know very well I’m keeping you away from him for your own good.” “Why don’t you let me make my own mistakes?” [MASK] asked.
<name>he</name>	he	Dumachas	Day after day, night after night, hour after hour of constant companionship, and caring. They cared as much for each other as they did themselves. Whenever they were separated, [MASK] missed her as he would have his right arm.
<name>Rinaldi</name>	Rinaldi	Marcellus	I don’t want him to die and become a martyr to these people.” “I would like for it to happen that way also,” said [MASK], “but the jackal has decided to make a run for it and we have no choice.
<name>Isadora</name>	Isadora	Sheba	You must get the ‘Emperor’s’ permission to . . . think. Probably to breathe, and maybe even to dream. Does he tell you who you can, or cannot, make love to?” [MASK] asked and brushed her skirt at the slit, revealing her bare legs.
<name>Cleopatra</name>	Cleopatra	Claudia	[MASK] could not take her eyes from him, so masculine and devilishly handsome was he. Sipping her wine, she decided to converse. “It is true you hate the Roman people?” she asked. “I don’t hate people; I just dislike some of the things people do.”
<name>The Doctor</name>	The Doctor	Abenadar	“You want to live a long, prosperous, and secure life, and all of the alternatives would probably shorten it. I don’t blame you. And I’m glad, very glad that you are here with us.” [MASK] smiled and nodded, thinking the conversation was over.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Asher	“One can only hope,” replied [MASK]. “It seems to me that what is truly important to the future generations is not the avenues we use to make changes but to see that we use all available means to achieve those changes.”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Thadius	He was completely unaware that [MASK] had followed him. The spy had now worked his way to the side of the building and was, at that very moment, hiding under some trash while peering through a slit in the window boards.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Eltone	“We had some good days. Some fabulous nights, but there were so many other things I wanted to do. So many places I wanted to see. Other countries, other people. [MASK] said that people are the same everywhere . . . good and bad.
<name>Creedy</name>	Creedy	Marcellus	“You keep telling me that. You keep saying he is going to die. I don’t believe you any more. Whose blood is that?” “All I want to know is what you intend to do when he is dead,” said [MASK].
<name>Maximus</name>	Maximus	Necator	He stood back then and watched the Roman slide slowly to the floor, and realized this was the first time he had killed since he fought [MASK]. He had fought many times, always won, and had let his opponent live. He had never liked killing, never once enjoyed it.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jezzi	Someone in the crowd handed him a glass; he looked at it, frowned in disgust, cleaned it with the tail of his shirt, and poured and drank the wine. “Come on,” said [MASK]. “We haven’t got all night.”
<name>Cristóbal Colón</name>	Cristóbal Colón	Dumachas	The women yelled their love to him while throwing kisses and flowers. Men rushed out of their shops, patted him on the back, offered him food or other portions of their wares. [MASK] smiled and refused everything offered to him, except the kisses being blown by the women.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Dumachas	“Run away? Run away from you? I’ll tell you when I’m going to run away from you,” said [MASK], beginning to tear also. “When these flowers no longer bloom in the spring, then I’ll run away from you.
<name>Arya</name>	Arya	Sheba	He wished then he had taught [MASK] how to use a sword or a dagger, so that she could at least defend herself. He made a mental note to teach her—if they survived this confrontation. “I would like you to answer my question.
<name>she</name>	she	Dumachas	“You’re silly sometimes, but I love it.” “Then, you’ll accept the flowers?” “Only if you’ll accept my love,” she said. “I accept,” [MASK] sang, “I accept, I accept!”
<name>Olivia</name>	Olivia	Sheba	He wanted his men to live, at all cost, and after taking a deep breath, he finally said, “I’m meeting with [MASK] in a little while. If she’s with him because she wants it, then we’ll go away.
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Hadrius	“Which god?” [MASK] asked. “Their god.” “What happens now?” “The priests will try him for blasphemy, they will find him guilty, and they’ll ask to have him put to death.”
<name>Uncle Tom</name>	Uncle Tom	Nadab	Quite often the two youngsters could be seen leaving the back entrance while toiling with a carpet that was to be delivered to some distant part of the city. Old now, [MASK] was still gentle, kind, and intelligent.
<name>Julius</name>	Julius	Hunter	The Romans on the balcony lifted [MASK]’s body and threw it down to the main floor, while others began to go from room to room. The pitiful cries of the frightened, the wounded, and the dying were dreadful and deafening.
<name>Conan</name>	Conan	Grixis	[MASK], sensing and hoping for a fight, was sitting out by his pile of weapons, meticulously sharpening a broadsword. Hearing a twig snap, probably from a wayward bird, he spun around ready for fatal combat.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Partirus	[MASK] was an apelike man, with a grotesque, simian face. He was tall and slender-looking, but, viewing him closely, one could see that every inch of his body was laden with muscle. His fingers, puffy and knotted, appeared like large, sturdy meat hooks.
<name>He</name>	He	Dumachas	When his arms were overloaded, he ran back to the apartment, leaving a colorful, scented trail along the way. As he rushed into their bedroom, he found Sheba stretched out on the bed crying. [MASK] laid the flowers next to her, and taking her into his arms, asked what was wrong.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Marcellus	The servants managed to avoid being slashed and ran from the house. Completely alone now, lost and frightened, [MASK] began to weep, feel sorry for himself, and drink. He had consumed a huge bottle of wine and was languished before the fireplace when he heard the downstairs door open.
<name>He</name>	He	Claudia	I’m certain this will definitely not cause a break between us. What do you think?” [MASK] put the cheese down and selected a slice of pear and bit into it. “I merely want you to know I still love you very much.
<name>Abigail</name>	Abigail	Abenadar	There were four guards over each of the condemned men, and others stood by in case of trouble. When an old, grayhaired woman carrying a skin of wine begged entrance to the three men, [MASK] ordered the cordon of guards to let her through.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Marcellus	‘Tor my destiny.” “Destiny does not come to one; we each guide our own destinies. Which way are you steering, [MASK], or are you leaving your fate to some ill wind?” “The gods have decided my destiny.”
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Marcellus	“Not you. Send someone else to see if the building was burned. If it wasn’t, make certain that it is. And I want you to find that jackass [MASK] and bring him to me.”
<name>he</name>	he	Dumachas	Laughing aloud, [MASK] grabbed her up in his arms and twirled her around. “Have you gone mad?” “Yes, yes,” he said. “Mad with love. Mad with passion. Mad with freedom.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Sheba	“I don’t think I’ll bother to ask why.” “Why should you? You know very well why.” “For the life of me, [MASK], I cannot understand your infatuation with that criminal. The two of you have
<name>Thalia</name>	Thalia	Dumachas	And I don’t want you and the rest of our friends to die either, and if we go against the legions, we’ll lose.” “How can you be so sure?” [MASK] took a second and then said, “Because, believe it or not, I have considered it.
<name>Moses</name>	Moses	Dumachas	If he wasn’t, how was he able to move his entire tribe, tents, and animals, without making a sound or leaving a trace? [MASK] didn’t believe it, but the romantic in him allowed it as one possible explanation.
<name>Claudius</name>	Claudius	Sheba	“[MASK], I want you to think about what this means. I am a tribune. Are you aware of the power it gives me?” “The only power you have that I am concerned with is the power to keep me here against my will.
<name>God</name>	God	Nadab	They had always been together, always. Even slept together, but always as brother and sister— until their afternoon of sweet shattered innocence. The sun had glittered all morning, and when the children finished their chores for [MASK], they were free for the remainder of the day.
<name>Judas</name>	Judas	Judas	“They want me to betray him,” [MASK] almost whispered. “They have offered me thirty pieces of silver.” “What are you saying?” “That’s it. The man has performed miracles. He speaks of love and he treats everybody the same.
<name>he</name>	he	Dumachas	He shook his head, and pulled the covers over the girl. “They have saved me for you,” she said softly. “I know.” “Don’t you want me?” “I belong to someone else,” [MASK] said, speaking quietly.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Sheba	The boy managed to scale the six-foot wall with one agile leap but found difficulty getting through the window because of [MASK]’s kisses. Once he was able to hold her off for a moment, they tumbled to the floor in laughter.
<name>Caesar's</name>	Caesar's	Dumachas	“Roman blood, sir.” “Your Roman blood, or ours?” “All Roman blood.” “This wouldn’t have anything to do with the fact you are living with [MASK]’ woman, would it?”
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Sheba	They were, naturally, strangers to the women, but these silent creatures acted as if the Judeans didn’t exist. “Have you noticed?” said [MASK], “that there are only women and children here?” “Perhaps you were right.
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Marcellus	“As soon as the Passover Feast is complete.” “Why should I have to wait until then?” “It’s only a few days,” said [MASK]. “You can at least give me that much time with you, can’t you?”
<name>God</name>	God	Dumachas	Every step I take, every word I speak, and every beat of my heart is for [MASK]. And every prayer I say from this day forward will be to ask for his forgiveness, and nothing, nothing can change it.”
<name>Arya</name>	Arya	Partirus	[MASK] asked. “It was blocking my view of the celebration.” “I have killed men for less than that.” more graceful with time, because I’m still sitting here.” “I am the fastest man alive with a sword.”
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Dumachas	“Wrong?” she answered. ‘What could be wrong? You have taken me and I am yours. Yours forever. I am your wife until death.” [MASK] thought about it, smiled, and said, “It’s true.”
<name>Red</name>	Red	Grixis	He’s a good man and a friend.” “A friend!” said [MASK]. “That’s right. He helped me when it was time for my release.” “He said he’s in a hurry and for you to come as soon as possible.”
<name>Adonis</name>	Adonis	Rashah	Some of the most shapely women of the tribe entered the tent with trays of meat, fruits, and drink. Three of the women, all dressed in black with their faces veiled, began to strip [MASK] naked and bathe him.
<name>George</name>	George	Asher	“Thank you anyway. Well find something.” “No,” said [MASK]. “I wouldn’t feel right knowing you’re somewhere else. You had better come with me.” “We don’t want to impose on you.”
<name>Myrtle</name>	Myrtle	Rashah	You insult me, you make me sad, and yet you make me love you. I do not understand.” “All of us . . . are many things, [MASK]. Many things.” The chief nodded and drank his wine.
<name>Caesar</name>	Caesar	Sheba	When one of the four guards, his anus filled with purchases, began to lag behind, [MASK] shouted, “If you can’t keep up, why don’t you ask one of these other nursemaids to help you?” The legionnaire instantly ran to catch up.
<name>Francisco</name>	Francisco	Hamicar	“The rest of you men can go where you want. But I want your word you won’t slave again.” [MASK]’s men were shocked. Some had already begun to pray silently, certain of their doom. “May we have the mules?”
<name>whoever</name>	whoever	Grixis	If she’s with him because she wants it, then we’ll go away. If she is being held, then. . . .” “Then, what?” asked [MASK]. “Then I’ll have to figure a way to free her.”
<name>Babe Paley</name>	Babe Paley	Claudia	[MASK] was not young or beautiful, but she was pure elegance. She had obviously been bom rich, catered to, milk-bathed, massaged, and spoiled all her life, and yet she appeared as if she had never been a child, but always a tough, smart, mature woman.
<name>David</name>	David	Pilate	*1 understand your Sheba is quite beautiful,” offered [MASK]. “Yes, she is. As far as women are concerned, I would have to say that you and I are the most fortunate men in all the world.”
<name>Victor</name>	Victor	Marcellus	She pulled it out and then calmly shoved it in at another angle and twisted it again. [MASK]’ legs straightened, throbbed, and stiffened. His fingers and hands froze in grotesque positions while his eyes and mouth were locked open.
<name>Octavia</name>	Octavia	Aurelius	“My God, where does your revenge end?” [MASK] complained to the tribune. “What good is this going to do?” “She doesn’t believe he is capable of dying. Now she will see.” “Do you think this will make her love you?”
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Dumachas	“Would you like to make love to her?” [MASK] thought a moment, and said, “It surprised me how soft and warm she was when I held her. She looked and acted so much like a man, it surprised me.”
<name>her</name>	her	Sheba	As the three of them passed through the crowds of shoppers and pilgrims in front of the many small stands, a necklace made of river pearls caught [MASK]’s eye and she stopped, touching it delicately. “How much?”
<name>Patrick</name>	Patrick	Marcellus	As [MASK] dug his nails into her bare thighs, Sheba ignored the pain and twisted the knife one way and then the other. She pulled it out and then calmly shoved it in at another angle and twisted it again.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Dumachas	“Why can’t we make love?” “We’ll have plenty of time. You’d better go before they get suspicious.” “I don’t care. I want you.” “No!” [MASK] said sharply. ‘Tonight.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Abenadar	[MASK] shook his head. “He looked rather sad and said, ‘I’m glad I’m good at something. It’s terribly depressing sitting across from a man who has so much charm, looks, and intelligence. At least I can win a game or two.’
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Dumachas	Taking a deep breath, the rabbi stated, “I suppose you two are aware that you give me nightmares every time I think of the way you live.” “We live very well,” said [MASK]. “We’re happy, we’re healthy, and we’re in love.
<name>her</name> (There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to a pronoun)	her (There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to a pronoun)	Sheba	When he looked over at [MASK] and asked, “Don’t you want to be bathed?” she refused to answer, and remained glaring coldly at him while gulping her wine. “Do not ask your woman; tell her!”
<name>Thresh</name>	Thresh	Demen	He had never liked killing, never once enjoyed it. As the fire began to engulf the entire first floor, the three victors ran from the room. “Fire! fire!” [MASK] was yelling as they returned to the olive trees.
<name>Walt</name>	Walt	Dumachas	[MASK] scanned the area as far as he could see in all directions and was a bit relieved that the strange, purple-and-white tent top sprouting up in back of a distant hill was all he could see of human interference with this desolate but beautiful land.
<name>The Immortan Joe</name>	The Immortan Joe	Allah	I’m clean. I am the cleanest nomad there is. I bathe every day. Sometimes twice a day. Except when we are in the desert —there, water can be more precious than religion.” “Are you truly the brother of [MASK]?”
<name>the horizon</name>	the horizon	Sheba	He remained on the hill, watching [MASK], and then his naturally cautious instincts caused him to survey the terrain. Something far south of them caught his eye. Squinting against the sun’s glare, he saw a striped piece of cloth and assumed correctly that it was the top of a tent.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Pilate	“That was a rather silly question, wasn’t it?” "Yes, sir.” Again tears tried to swell in [MASK]’s eyes, but he turned to the window and said, “Her happiness means more to me than anything else in the entire world.”
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Marcellus	[MASK], finally calm, had hatred in his eyes when he raised himself up to look at her. “I can’t let you go,” he said. “I can’t let him have you.” “But don’t you understand ...
<name>Anton</name>	Anton	Grixis	“[MASK], all I’m trying to say is that we don’t have a chance here.” “I’ve killed fifty and I’m still free to kill more.” “How many towns have you had to run from?” “Not many.”
<name>Uncle Tom</name>	Uncle Tom	Jezzi	“Would you like something to eat?” “No, but I am very tired.” “Come,” said [MASK]. “I’ll find you a nice bed.” “Is it all right that I have come here?” the black woman asked.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Sheba	“Welcome, welcome, dear lady. What an unexpected pleasure it is for a humble servant like myself to be honored with your presence!” Remaining coldly aloof, [MASK] asked, “What do you have that is worth seeing?” “Probably nothing worthy of my lady.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Dumachas	As the blood flowed from the wounds, [MASK] was in excruciating agony, but he knew there were hours to go before death would put a merciful end to his misery. “Is there anything you want me to do?”
<name>Doodle</name>	Doodle	Allah	“No, I’ve never cried. I’ve never been sad. [MASK] has made his brother very happy.” “Have you ever been so happy that you’ve cried tears of joy, or perhaps of relief?” “No. I have never cried.
<name>he</name>	he	Eltone	“Perhaps you take me for a fool. Perhaps you think I’m retarded also. I couldn’t care less what [MASK] or anyone else tells you. As far as I’m concerned he’s trash just like the rest of you.”
<name>Long John Silver</name>	Long John Silver	Barabbas	Beaching down, he grabbed the young man in the lower berth and sent him sailing across the room to a pile of straw. “You don’t mind, do you?” [MASK] laughed. ‘You’re young and strong. I need my rest.”
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Dumachas	As he sat watching the woman, she would look up every so often and smile at him. Finishing the steps, she left her bucket and rags and walked up to [MASK]. “Is there anything I can do for you?” “What is your name?”
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Jarid	As he reached the mule, he saw the ten old men, who were brandishing broadswords, daggers, spears, and tridents, sneaking up on their position. “What is it?” [MASK] asked, and one of the old men said plainly, “We have been sent to kill you.”
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Dumachas	After a pause, [MASK] said, “Yes.” In thought, the girl said, “I’m not a slave any more, but I can’t be a princess either.” “Why not?” “Because I don’t have a kingdom.
<name>him</name>	him	Dumachas	Lifting her again, he carried her back to the bedding, and within moments they were making love. It wasn’t the crowing of a rooster that woke [MASK] the next morning. Or the small breakers slapping at the shore. Or the proud braying of the stallions.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Dumachas	“But I don’t know anything about business,” [MASK] admitted honestly. “I’ll teach you. I know all there is to know. You just take care of the fights and I’ll handle the rest. And you’ll never have to worry about me robbing you.
<name>Zorro</name>	Zorro	Barabbas	All were asleep when [MASK] and his two guards arrived, but the loud clanging of the keys and the lock woke everyone, and all eyes were pinned skeptically on the well-known and much-feared bandit, save those of one: the man in the top bunk at the back of the cell.
<name>her</name>	her	Jezzi	“I take it he wasn’t there.” “No, he wasn’t—fortunate for him.” “Did you kill [MASK]?” “Yes; she and the others took it upon themselves to attack my legionnaires as they entered. We had no other choice.”
<name>Patrick</name>	Patrick	Marcellus	The yard had been cleaned of debris, but the divots and bloodstains on the lawn were signs that could not be easily erased. He didn’t know if [MASK] had returned to the house. He hoped he wasn’t there. The house appeared quiet and empty.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Abenadar	[MASK] kneeled to him and asked, “What do you mean?” “Prison was never so complete. Now you have me. I am nothing . . . ever again.” The soldiers moved to his feet.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Rashah	“I know women cry. I make them cry all the time.” “Do you know that men cry? Have you ever cried?” [MASK] thought for a moment. “No, I’ve never cried. I’ve never been sad.
<name>Love</name>	Love	Power	“No, I won’t let you go,” he shouted. “I care about your safety even if you don’t.” “My safety is not what concerns you. [MASK] is all that’s on your mind. I represent some impossible challenge to you.
<name>Boo</name> (from the novel "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee)	Boo (from the novel "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee)	Dumachas	You had better come with me.” “We don’t want to impose on you.” “[MASK], you two have been ‘imposing” on me in one way or another since you were bom. One more night will hardly cause my death.”
<name>his</name>	his	Dumachas	The pain became nothing to her then. She would bear it all and more if it would relieve one ounce of [MASK]’ suffering. She would hurt for him, bleed for him, and even die for him. For his love.
<name>He</name>	He	Dumachas	All there was at that moment, and as it seemed eternal, was their love for each other. As the tears finally began to subside, [MASK] took a deep breath of relief to gain control. Turning to Sheba, he whispered, “I’m sorry.”
<name>Max</name>	Max	Abenadar	He hoped he wasn’t there. The house appeared quiet and empty. [MASK] avoided the lower level and took the outside steps to the balcony. Nothing there, but standing in the hallway was a Roman legionnaire guarding a door.
<name>Brienne</name>	Brienne	Hunter	As the Dibon women were brought into view, [MASK] chuckled and said, “Well, at least we’re going to be in good company.” “A lot of good they’re going to do us chained up like this.”
<name>John</name>	John	Dumachas	“Yes, keep it. And go now.” [MASK] lingered long enough to say, ‘Tm sorry the world isn’t a better place to live in, and that you and your wife, and Sheba and I couldn’t have met at a better time.”
<name>He</name>	He	Abenadar	“Let me think. What does she have that I would want?” He chuckled then and winked at the leeches, and then all started to laugh aloud. [MASK] was boiling inside, but he had to remain calm or ruin the plot.
<name>him</name>	him	Dumachas	Looking into the mirror, she knew there would be a mark there, a red welt, and she wouldn’t want [MASK] to see it if he was set free. As always, she wanted to be perfect for him—as he was for her.
<name>Yael</name>	Yael	Pilate	“Why is the prisoner Dumachas being held?” [MASK] asked. “I thought it was better to keep him until after the Pass-over, for security reasons.” “Why is he a risk?”
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Marcellus	“Luxury and power are all that one needs.” “You have luxury and power, [MASK], and you’re the most miserable human being I have ever had the misfortune to meet. . . and I’m bored to death talking to you.
<name>Rand</name>	Rand	Lucius	“I’m pushing you, [MASK]. I’m pushing as hard as I can. I wish I knew how to push you harder, push you into drawing that sword so I could rip your brainless head off at the shoulders.”
<name>Attila</name>	Attila	Hamicar	You don’t talk, laugh, or breathe unless I tell you!” When one of the men said they were ready to leave, [MASK] shouted for them to move out. Huge, flaming torches in the front of the column and along the sides guided their way.
<name>Effie Trinket</name>	Effie Trinket	Jarid	“Laugh if you want to, but have you noticed how she wears the clothes and that jewelry? As if she were bom to it. And did you see the guards carrying all those gifts she bought for herself?” “I saw them,” said [MASK].
