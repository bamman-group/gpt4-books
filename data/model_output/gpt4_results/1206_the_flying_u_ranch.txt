<name>Chip</name>	Chip	Pink	“But we'd rather be ashamed than good, any old time.” The Little Doctor giggled behind the Kid's tousled curls, and reached out a slim hand once more to give [MASK]'s tongs the expert twist he was trying awkwardly to learn.
<name>Shorty</name>	Shorty	Slim	“When sheepherders starts in once to be ornery, there ain't no way uh stoppin' 'em except by killin' 'em off. And that'll mean the pen for a lot of us fellers--” “Well, by golly, it won't be me,” [MASK] declared loudly.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Weary	“Come on, [MASK]. It won't take but a minute to hand a punch or two to that bug-killer, and then I'll feel better. They've both got it coming--come on!”
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Pink	cried [MASK], with intense disgust. “Ambling off there, so the sun can strike all that silver and bounce back in our eyes. And that braided lariat--I'd sure love to see the pieces if he ever tries to anchor anything bigger than a yearling!”
<name>Samuel</name>	Samuel	Slim	[MASK] did not hear a word they were saying; he was thinking it over, with that complete mental concentration which is the chief recompense of a slow-working mind. He was methodically thinking it all out--and, eventually, he saw the joke.
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Weary	You're taking a fine way to make us love yuh,” [MASK] cut in ironically. “I know what you want. You want the same as every other meek and lovely sheepman wants. You want it all--core, seeds and peeling.
<name>Blackbeard</name>	Blackbeard	Weary	For answer, [MASK] pulled back the hammer; also he smiled as malignantly as it was in his nature to do, and hoped in his heart that he looked sufficiently terrifying to convince the man. So they faced each other in a silent clash of wills.
<name>Shorty</name>	Shorty	Irish	I guess we'd have been to the Little Rockies ourselves.” “You've got a sweet little voice,” [MASK] cut in savagely, “but we're tired. We'd rather hear yuh say something!” “Oh--all right.
<name>Clayton</name>	Clayton	Slim	The blacksmith shop was silent, closed--as grimly noncommittal as a vault. You might guess whatever you pleased about its inmate; it was like trying to imagine the emotions pictured upon the face behind a smooth, black mask. [MASK] stopped before the closed door and listened.
<name>Weary</name>	Weary	Slim	After him went the Native Son, who had not been with the Flying U long enough to sense the magnitude of the affront, and [MASK], who knew to a nicety just what “cowmen” considered the unpardonable sin, and the rest of the Happy Family, who were rather incredulous still.
<name>Chet</name>	Chet	Irish	“Not for me,” [MASK] declared, and turned his face away from the stench of them. Others there were who rode the length of the train with faces averted and looks of disdain; cowmen, all of them, they shared the range prejudice, and took no pains to hide it.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Andy	[MASK] edged his horse around an impracticable slope of shale stuff and went on. The herder followed. When he was within twelve feet or so of the bottom, there was a sound of pebbles knocked loose in haste, a scrambling, and then came the impact of his body.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Dunk	“Back on the old stamping ground, are you?” “Since you see me here, I suppose I am,” [MASK] made churlish response. “Do you happen to own those Dot sheep, back there on the hill?”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Irish	He gazed thoughtfully at his boots, laughed suddenly, and slapped [MASK] quite painfully upon the back. “Come on up and introduce me, boys,” he said. “We'll make this Native Son so hungry for home--you watch me put it on the gentleman.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Weary	“Who's that tall, lanky feller in the lead? I don't call to mind ever seem him before. Them four herders I'd know a mile off.” “That?” [MASK] shaded his eyes with his hat-brim, against the slant rays of the westering sun.
<name>Enough</name>	Enough	Mamma	It happens that we expect to make a living off of sheep. Now, we don't want to start in by quarreling with our neighbors, and we don't want our neighbors to start any quarrel with us. All we want--” “[MASK]!
<name>Andy</name>	Andy	Shot	[MASK] through the leg--shattered a bone, by cripes!--las' night, only; and here he's makin' a hand and ridin' and cussin' same as any of us t'day. We ain't goin' to let yuh grouch around, that's all.
<name>Chayne</name>	Chayne	Andy	Like the Native Son, he leaned and peered into eyes that stared back defiantly, wavered, and turned away. [MASK] also sat back in the saddle then, and snorted. “So this is the Dunk Whittaker that's been raising merry hell around here!
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Dunk	“Hello, [MASK],” he said cheerfully, sliding over in the saddle so that a foot hung free of the stirrup, as men who ride much have learned to do when they stop for a chat, thereby resting while they may.
<name>Shorty</name>	Shorty	Slim	I'll bet, by golly, he paid then herders to tie him up like that. He can't fool me!” “Say, [MASK], I do believe your brains is commencin' to sprout!”
<name>Woolly</name>	Woolly	Dunk	If he didn't, we can take [MASK] in to-morrow, ourselves.” He turned and fixed a cold, commanding eye upon the slack-jawed herders. “Come along, you two, and get these sheep headed outa here.”
<name>Slivers</name>	Slivers	Dunk	“Let [MASK] froth at the mouth if he wants to; what we want is to get these sheep off the range. And,” he added recklessly, “so long as the sheriff is headed for us anyway, we may as well get busy and make it worth his while.
<name>Jeff</name>	Jeff	Andy	“I thought you said you was goin' to lock Dunk up in the blacksmith shop,” he launched accusingly at [MASK]. “We did,” averred that young man, pushing his toe against the railing to accelerate the voluptuous motion of the hammock.
<name>Monte</name>	Monte	Weary	“He'll do it when you ain't looking, though. He--” “I know it,” [MASK] sighed. “I'm kinda sorry, now, I slapped him. He'll hit back--but he won't hit me; he'll aim at the outfit.
<name>Slim</name>	Slim	Andy	“Why don't you point out Slim as the limit, once in a while?” “Come on down to the stable, and let's talk it over,” [MASK] suggested, and led the way. “What's his style, anyway?
<name>Chip</name>	Chip	Andy	He cowered miserably before the Happy Family, his face hidden behind his two hands. “Boys, I want to say a word or two. Come over here.” [MASK]'s voice, quiet as ever, contrasted strangely with the man's sobbing.
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Weary	“You fellows ride up around that side, and put the run on them sheep,” [MASK] shouted back to the others. “We'll start the other side moving. Make 'em travel--back where they came from.” He jerked his head toward the north.
<name>Tim</name>	Tim	Miguel	[MASK] exclaimed softly, and rose to greet him. “And that scrap in the alley--we sure had a hell of a time there for a few minutes, didn't we? Are you that tall fellow who kicked that squint-eyed greaser in the stomach?
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Andy	He smiled again that wonderful smile, which lighted the darkness of his eyes as with a flame, and murmured a sentence or two in Spanish. “Did you get the spurs me and my friends sent you afterward?” asked [MASK] eagerly.
<name>John</name>	John	Chip	“I'll go tell some one to catch up the team--you'll want to make that 11:20, I take it.” He added, as [MASK] went by him hastily, “I had the agent wire for sleeper berths on the 11:20 so--” “Thanks.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Andy	The bug-killer and the other were there, and they noted that the features of that other bore witness to the truth of [MASK]'s story of the fight. He regarded them with one perfectly good eye and one which was considerably swollen, and grinned a swollen grin.
<name>Clayton</name>	Clayton	Oleson	“I don't.” He made a catlike spring at the foremost man, who happened to be [MASK], and got a merciless grip with his fingers on his throat, snarling like a predatory animal over its kill.
<name>Goodness</name>	Goodness	grandma	And even a rattler is square enough to buzz at yuh and give yuh a chanc't to side-step him. Honest to [MASK], I don't hardly know what kinda reptyle y'are. I hate to insult any of 'em, by cripes, by namin' yuh after 'em.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Pink	“They could be up on the hill--” “Hell, yes!” was [MASK]'s forceful answer. “They could be on the hill, but they ain't. Why, darn it, they're straggling into the little pasture!
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Pink	“Why, sure!” [MASK] threw a leg over the bench and got up with cheerful alacrity. “I'll do it now, if you say so; I didn't know but what that was some new fad of yours, like--” “Fad!”
<name>Chip</name>	Chip	Pink	He sure must be a tough proposition, if the whole bunch of yuh have had to give him up. By gracious--” “We haven't tried,” [MASK] defended. “It kinda looked to us as if he was aiming to make us guy him; so we didn't.
<name>Alvin</name>	Alvin	Paw	“[MASK]'s got a million dollars. A man bought our ranch and gave him a lot of money. We're rich now. Maybe paw'll buy us a phony-graft. He said maybe he would. And maw's goin' to have a blue silk dress with green onto it.
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Miguel	“I'd hate to ride as fast and far to-night as that hombre will,” supplemented [MASK] with his brief smile, that was just a flash of white, even teeth and a momentary lightening of his languorous eyes.
<name>Chayne</name>	Chayne	Weary	There were more horses about the place, a covered wagon or two, three or four men working upon the corral, and, lastly, there was one whom [MASK] recognized the moment he caught sight of him. “Looks like a sheep outfit, all right,” he said somberly.
<name>Chip</name>	Chip	Dunk	He spat upon the burnt end of his cigarette stub from force of the habit that fear of range fires had built, and cast it petulantly from him; as if he would like to have been able to throw [MASK] and his sheep problem as easily out of his path.
<name>Tex</name>	Tex	Weary	“That's all right, then. Start 'em south, and don't quit till somebody tells you to.” [MASK] carefully let down the hammer of his six-shooter and shoved it thankfully into his scabbard.
<name>sheep</name>	sheep	Dots	“This here sheep business is plumb wearin' on a man. 'Specially,” he added with a fretful note, “when you've got to handle 'em gentle. The things I'd like to do to them [MASK] is all ruled outa the game, seems like.
<name>Shorty</name>	Shorty	Slim	“Come on out here and smell 'em yourself, then!” [MASK] bawled indignantly. “I never seen such an outfit as this is gittin' to be; you fellers don't believe nobody, no more.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Irish	Only it does seem a shame to do it.” “No, it ain't. If you'd been around him for two weeks, you'd want to kill him just to make him take notice,” [MASK] assured him.
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Irish	The sheep jumped, scuttled away a few paces and returned to its nibbling progress. [MASK] called it names and whacked another. After a few minutes he grew tired of swinging his loop and seeing it have so fleeting an effect, and pulled his gun.
<name>Arturo</name>	Arturo	Miguel	“I didn't know--we heard you had disappeared off the earth. Why--” [MASK] laughed outright. “To fight a bull with bare hands is one thing, amigo,” he said. “To take a chance on getting a knife stuck in your back is another.
<name>Shorty</name>	Shorty	Weary	Honest to grandma, a little gore would look better to me right now than a Dutch picnic before the foam's all blowed off the refreshments. Lemme kill off jest one herder, [MASK]?” he pleaded. “The one that took a shot at me las' night.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Dunk	[MASK]. He stopped when his hand began to sting through his glove. “Now you keep your hand away from that gun--that you ain't honest enough to carry where folks can see it, but 'ye got it cached in your pocket!”
<name>Chip</name>	Chip	Miguel	And, by gracious, they were beauts, too--did yuh get 'em?” “I wear them every day I ride,” answered [MASK], a peculiar, caressing note in his voice. “I didn't know--we heard you had disappeared off the earth.
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Weary	It won't take but a minute to hand a punch or two to that bug-killer, and then I'll feel better. They've both got it coming--come on!” This because [MASK] showed a strong inclination to take the trail and keep it to his destination.
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Pink	[MASK], therefore, withdrew his challenge to the bunch, and laid his billiard cue down with a sigh and the remark that all he lacked was time, to have the scalps of every last one of them hanging from his belt.
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Weary	[MASK] considered briefly. “No, I guess we'll pass 'em up for the present. An hour or so won't make much difference in the long run, and our horses are about all in, right now--” “So'm I, by cripes!”
<name>Shorty</name>	Shorty	Pink	“It wouldn't matter so much if he wasn't all front,” [MASK] complained. “You'll notice that's always the way, though. The fellow all fussed up with silver and braided leather can't get out and do anything.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Bud	So don't think about--our own feelings, or about--” he stopped abruptly and let a downward glance finish the sentence. “We've got to keep our own hands clean, and--now don't let your fingers get the itch, [MASK]!”
<name>Weary</name>	Weary	Pink	Four herders moved slowly upon the outskirts, and the dogs were little, scurrying, black dots which stopped occasionally to wait thankfully until the master-minds again urged them to endeavor. The Happy Family drew up and stared in silence. “Do I see sheep?” [MASK] inquired plaintively at last.
<name>Chip</name>	Chip	Andy	I'd back you single-handed against a dozen sheepherders like then two we've been chasing around. If I hadn't felt that way I wouldn't have sent yuh out alone with 'em.” “Well, [MASK] needn't think he's goin' to stick me on that there story,”
<name>Rowena</name>	Rowena	Sybilly	He had caught the boys grinning, and fancied that they were tracing a likeness between the garrulity of [MASK] and the fluency of her aunt, the Countess. “You don't want that train to go off and leave yuh, by golly.”
<name>Stable</name>	Stable	Jim	I'll have a rig--no, you better get a team from [MASK]. They'll be fresh, and you can put 'em through. If you kill 'em,” he added grimly, “we can pay for 'em.”
<name>Chip</name>	Chip	Weary	He smiled that supercilious smile which [MASK] had hated of old, and which, he knew, was well used to covering much treachery and small meannesses of various sorts. “As I said, if the Flying U has any claim against us, let the owner present it in the usual way.”
<name>Weary</name>	Weary	Slim	The rest was indistinguishable, but it did not matter. The Happy Family, save [MASK], who stayed to look after the patient, tiptoed penitently off the porch and took themselves and their enthusiasm down to the bunk-house. CHAPTER XVII. Good News
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	Andy	“I'll get rid of the sheep,” he said, as if he was minded to clinch the promise. “I'll do it at once.” “That's nice.” [MASK] spoke with grim irony. “And you'll get rid of the ranch, too.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Pink	You'd have done just what I did; you'd have let him go.” “He will hit back, all right enough,” [MASK] retorted passionately. “He'll do it when you ain't looking, though.
<name>Ramon</name>	Ramon	Miguel	“I was just wonderin', by golly, where yuh learnt to talk!” [MASK] turned his velvet eyes sleepily toward the speaker. “From the boarders who ate those parrots, amigo,” he smiled serenely.
<name>Chayne</name>	Chayne	Pink	“All right,” [MASK] remarked, a little quick-breathed, when the herder decided for the third time to get up. “A friend of mine worked yuh over a little, this morning, and I just thought I'd make a better job than he did.
<name>Shorty</name>	Shorty	Andy	“You'll wisht, by cripes, you was a dozen men just like yuh before you're through with the deal. Haw-haw-haw-w!” There were others who, seeing [MASK]'s grin, had something to say upon the subject before they left.
<name>Shorty</name>	Shorty	Slim	“I ain't got a shell left,” he growled regretfully. “I wisht we'd thought to tell the boys to bring them rifles. Say, [MASK], you crawl onto your hoss and go git 'em. It won't take more'n a minute.
<name>Chip</name>	Chip	Weary	“What worries me,” [MASK] confided, obeying the impulse to talk over his troubles with those who sympathized, “is how I'm going to keep the work going along like it ought to, and at the same time keep them Dot sheep outa the house.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Dunk	If any of us boys got into trouble, the Old Man would spend his last cent to clear us; and [MASK] knows that just as well as he knows the way from the house to the stable. He'd see to it that it would just about take the Old Man's last cent, too.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Irish	Two o'clock in the morning is a mighty poor time for elegant conversation, if you want my opinion.” “And the main point is, you knew all about it, and you didn't give a darn whether we did or not,” [MASK] said bluntly.
<name>Chip</name>	Chip	Weary	To see him lose his temper was something of an event with the Happy Family, who used sometimes to fix the date of an incident by saying, “It was right after that time [MASK] got mad, a year ago last fall,” or something of the sort.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Weary	[MASK], when the band stopped and huddled, blatting incessantly against a sheer wall of sandstone and gravel, got the herders together and told them what he wanted. “You take 'em down that slope till you come to the second little coulee.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Mamma	“[MASK], how I do love sheep!” Whereupon he put spurs to his horse and galloped down to the station to rid his ears of the turbulent wave of protest from the cars. Naturally it required some time to compose the telegram in a style satisfactory to all parties.
<name>Tex</name>	Tex	Pink	“I betche they'll kill somebody before they're through. When sheepmen gits mean--” [MASK] picked up his rope and started for the large corral, where a few saddle horses had been driven in just before supper and had not yet been turned out.
<name>Blackbeard's</name>	Blackbeard's	Weary	Unlike the four whose camp had been laid low the night before, these two were unarmed, as they had been from the first; which, in [MASK]'s opinion, was a bit of guile upon the part of
<name>Shorty</name>	Shorty	Slim	and he permitted his horse to lag a length. It is difficult to fight absolute passivity. Then [MASK], who ever tramped solidly over the flowers of sarcasm, blurted one of his unexpected retorts. “I was just wonderin', by golly, where yuh learnt to talk!”
<name>Weary</name>	Weary	Pink	He glanced back to see where [MASK] was, saw that he was close behind, as was the lank man, and spoke in a tone that included them all. “The Flying U ain't pasturing sheep, this spring,” he informed them pleasantly.
<name>Chip</name>	Chip	Irish	And that braided lariat--I'd sure love to see the pieces if he ever tries to anchor anything bigger than a yearling!” “Why, you don't think for a minute he could ever get out and rope anything, do yuh?” [MASK] laughed.
<name>Champ</name>	Champ	Bud	“So I wish you boys would hang onto yourselves when you hear a sheep blatting under your window,” he summed up his unburdening whimsically. “As [MASK] said this morning, you can't hang a man for telling a sheepherder you'll take off his shoes.
<name>Kit</name>	Kit	Pink	“Seems to me I'd friz them diamonds, if I was goin' to be mean enough to do anything.” “You would, eh?” [MASK] glanced up at her and dimpled. “I'll find you a rich husband to pay for that.”
<name>gringo</name>	gringo	Mexican	“To take a chance on getting a knife stuck in your back is another. Those Mexicans--they don't love the man who crosses the river and makes of their bull-fights a plaything.” “That's right; only I thought, you being a--” “Not a [MASK].”
<name>Griffiths</name>	Griffiths	Dunk	[MASK], they judged, had just arrived with another man whom they did not know: a tall man with light hair that hung lank to his collar, a thin, sharp-nosed face and a wide mouth, which stretched easily into a smile, but which was none the pleasanter for that.
<name>Andy</name>	Andy	Irish	[MASK] raised a rumpled, brown head from his pillow, and blinked sleepily at him. “I've been dreaming I was a sheepherder, all night.” “Well, you've got the swellest chance in the world to 'make every dream
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Andy	Neither did [MASK] have anything to say, until he saw that they were swinging steadily to the west, instead of keeping straight north, as they had been told to do. Then he rode over to the nearest herder, who happened to be the bug-killer.
<name>Fritz</name>	Fritz	Patsy	Two of a Kind [MASK], staunch old partisan that he was, placed before them much food which he had tried his best to keep hot without burning everything to a crisp, and while they ate with ravenous haste he told, with German epithets and a trembling lower jaw, of his troubles that day.
<name>Emmeline</name>	Emmeline	Mary	soon as I sold I got oneasy like. The feller wanted p'session right away, too, so I told [MASK] we might as well start b'fore we git outa the notion. I wouldn't uh cared about sellin', maybe, but the kids needs to be in school.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Weary	he pleaded. “The one that took a shot at me las' night. Purty, please!” “If you killed one,” [MASK] told him glumly, “you might as well make a clean sweep and take in the whole bunch.”
<name>Dunk</name>	Dunk	Dunk	[MASK]'s wise, all right. He knows enough about the cow business to know we ye got to get out on the range pretty quick, now. And he's so mean that every day or every half day he can feed his sheep on Flying U grass, he calls that much to the good.
<name>Weary</name>	Weary	Weary	“Say, I smell sheep, by golly!” he announced in the bellowing tone which was his conversational voice, and sniffed again. “Oh, that's just a left-over in your system from the dose yuh got in town Sunday,” [MASK] explained soothingly.
<name>Chip</name>	Chip	Weary	“Hello, kids,” [MASK] greeted them amiably, with a secret smile over the memory of a time when they had purloined the Little Doctor's pills and had made reluctant acquaintance with a stomach pump. “Where's the circus going to be at?”
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Andy	“You want to look out, or you'll get apoplexy sure,” [MASK] soothed, giving himself another luxurious push and pulling the last, little whiff from his cigarette before he threw away the stub. “Fat men can't afford to get as excited as skinny ones can.”
<name>Blackburn</name>	Blackburn	Weary	“You move,” he directed with grim intent, “and don't take too much time about it, either.” The bug-killer, an unkempt, ungainly figure, standing with his back to the morning sun, scowled up at [MASK] stolidly.
<name>Abner</name>	Abner	Weary	“I never did go much on them darned hospitals, anyway,” [MASK] observed gloomily. “He oughta be home, where folks can look after him. Mam-ma! It sure is a fright.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Weary	“[MASK], I wish you'd untie this rope. I can't.” He spoke still in that peculiar, husky tone, and, when the last words were out, his teeth went together with a snap.
<name>Chip</name>	Chip	Mary	How's the Kid stacking up?” It was signed simply “The Bunch.” “[MASK]'s little lambs are here yet, I see,” the Native Son remarked carelessly when they went out. “Enough lambs for all the Marys in the country.
<name>Smitty</name>	Smitty	Mig	“Oh--all right. Well, [MASK] and I just ribbed up a josh on Dunk. I'd read somewhere about the same kinda deal, so it ain't original; I don't lay any claim to the idea at all; we just borrowed it.
<name>Shorty</name>	Shorty	Chip	“I'm kinda sorry, now, I slapped him. He'll hit back--but he won't hit me; he'll aim at the outfit. If the Old Man was here, or [MASK], I'd feel a whole lot easier in my mind.”
<name>Chip</name>	Chip	Chip	“Say, maybe you better go on up to the house,” he began diffidently. “I guess your wife wants to see yuh, maybe.” “Just as a good wife should,” grinned [MASK]. “What's the matter?
<name>Andy</name>	Andy	Slim	“Never mind, [MASK]; you can't all be famous,” he comforted. “Some day, maybe, I'll teach yuh the fine art of lying more convincingly than the ordinary man can tell the truth. It is a fine art; it takes a genius to put it across.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Irish	Then [MASK] mentally pictured him lying maimed, dying, perhaps, in a far-off hospital among strangers, and swore. “If he's got to die, it oughta be here, where folks know him and--where he knows--”
<name>Chip</name>	Chip	Irish	All that identification stunt of ours was just a bluff. But the minute I shoved my chips to the center, I knew we had him dead to rights. You were there. You saw him wilt. By gracious--” “Yuh don't know anything against him?” gasped [MASK].
