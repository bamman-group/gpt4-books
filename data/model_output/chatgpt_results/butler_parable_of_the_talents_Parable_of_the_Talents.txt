<name>see</name>	see	Dan	It hadn’t been nice at all. “I still want the Noyer girls,” I said. He nodded. “I’ll keep my eyes open. That young one over there is a real good fit to the description you gave.” I turned to [MASK].
<name>William</name>	William	Bankole	His legs and shoulder are healing, and he can walk a little. [MASK] says he can thank the maggots for that. Not only did the disgusting little things keep his wounds clean by eating the dead tissue, but they did no harm.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Michael	If we’re lucky, no one will wander in behind us before then and give us trouble or draw the truck’s attention back this way. But whatever happens, we’ll wait.” “Three people are dead,” [MASK] said. “We should be dead ourselves.
<name>Abel</name>	Abel	Bankole	“There was nothing here when we got here but the ashes of a house, the bones of [MASK]’s relatives, some untended crops and trees, and a well. There were only 13 of us then. There are 66 of us now—67 with you.”
<name>the President</name>	the President	Jarret	That’s why I voted for him. Now he’ll start putting things right!” It’s true that there haven’t been any burnings or beatings since [MASK] was inaugurated—or none that I’ve heard of, and I’ve been paying attention to the news.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Zahra	I continued. “Then... Then maybe they’ll let us... take care of [MASK].” We waited until afternoon, hungry, thirsty, scared, miserable, worried about our children, and wondering about our men. No one paid any attention to us.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Madison	And of course, being touched by [MASK]’s moist little hands was nasty. But this man, my uncle... my uncle!... made me want to reach out to him. I believed everything he told me. It never occurred to me not to.
<name>Mrs. Hale</name>	Mrs. Hale	Nia	And I took my sketchpad from my pack and began to draw not the rolling hills but [MASK]’s own plump, pleasant face. She was in her late forties or early fifties and had dark brown hair streaked with gray.
<name>Dean</name>	Dean	Olamina	Crock of shit, I thought. But I said, “[MASK].” “The girl’s outside with some friends of mine.” “Let’s go see her.” We walked out of the cafe together, followed by my friends and his.
<name>anguish</name>	anguish	Teresa	I cried. I cried in grief and terror and rage. People told me later that I made no sound at all, but within myself, I cried. Within myself, I screamed with [MASK], and I cried and cried and cried.
<name>Huxley</name>	Huxley	Jarret	The poor could enjoy the illusion of wealth, the ugly could be beautiful, the sick could be healthy, the timid could be bold... [MASK]’s people worried that this new entertainment would be like a drug to the “morally weak.”
<name>Chinua</name>	Chinua	Bankole	The emerald is a kind of beryl. “Ife” is the Yoruba personal name we’ve chosen to go with our two Yoruba surnames—since my grandfather and [MASK]’s father had chosen to take Yoruba surnames back in the 1960s.
<name>The dog</name>	The dog	Len	We’re not rushing and the days are long, so we don’t have to push on until it’s too dark to read. We’ve traveled south to a state highway that will take us inland to 1-5. [MASK] gave no trouble about this.
<name>us</name>	us	Acorn	He needed that more than he needed anything, and he meant to have it all at once. But now, instead of feeling important and proud, he feels angry and embarrassed. I had to let him inflict those feelings on himself. I couldn’t let him begin to divide [MASK].
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Freedom	We were quiet, but they awoke in confusion and chaos. Some were already awake and confused and grabbing me, and realizing that I was a woman. 1 hit one who wouldn’t let me go—a stranger from the road. “[MASK]!”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bankole	We’re growing. We need to do this.” Beside me, [MASK] sighed. “If we’re not careful,” he said, “our size and success will make us the castle on the hill—everyone’s protector in this area.
<name>Lauren</name>	Lauren	Len	“I don’t like them. They frighten me. But being without them would frighten me more.” So now [MASK] and I are lecturing and conducting Earthseed Workshops. We’re being paid in hard currency, fed well, and allowed to live in good, safe hotels.
<name>Ponyboy</name>	Ponyboy	Bankole	“She wasn’t as badly beaten as he was. I believe she’ll be all right.” Would she, after all that had happened? I doubted it. [MASK] and I sat silent for a while, each of us thinking our own thoughts.
<name>George</name>	George	Jus	We had begun to walk together up toward the George complex. “Is the Doctor there too?” I stopped, staring up toward the complex, and looked down, waiting until I could keep my voice steady. “No, [MASK]. He’s not here.”
<name>June</name>	June	Dan	There was a time when that was something of a hardship. It reminded us that we were not growing or raising as much as we should. Now it’s a pleasure. We’re doing well. “Can I sit with you?” [MASK] asked.
<name>Harlem</name>	Harlem	Gathering	We had reached out from our dump with money made at our dump. We had found him and freed him. But for us and our dump, he would still be a slave and a whore! “Come to [MASK],” I said in almost a whisper.
<name>Amish</name>	Amish	Marc	But afterward there will be questions and discussion.” “I’m not out to teach a class. I want to preach a sermon.” “That’s not our way, [MASK]. If you speak, you have to face questions and discussion.
<name>Barack</name>	Barack	Marc	It never occurred to me back in the 1990s when I was in medical school that in spite of my ideals, I would have to learn to do both.” MONDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 2033 [MASK] spoke at Gathering yesterday. This is the third time he’s done it.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Day	She ripped that guard’s throat out with her teeth! “[MASK]’s people hurt a couple of other guards, but it cost them 15 of their own. Fifteen dead just to start with. Some others were lashed to death or almost to death later.
<name>him</name>	him	Javier	They took their places on either side of her as the baby slept in her arms, and we hied past, each of us looking at [MASK] and giving him gentle, welcoming touches on each tiny hand and the black-haired head.
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Di	Things [MASK]’s rapist had said while she was with him waiting to be raped again made her certain that this was true. A master control unit protected by the guns, locks, and armor of a maggot was beyond our reach, for now.
<name>he</name>	he	Gray	That’s what I would have done. But this time, there was no escape. And yet [MASK] would not be a slave again. I found out later that he managed to get to the housetruck, lock himself in, and fire on some of the maggots.
<name>Greta</name>	Greta	Irma	I had done a quick sketch of [MASK] to catch her attention, and added a verse that was intended to reach her through environmental interests that I had heard her express: There is nothing alien About nature. Nature Is all that exists. It’s the earth
<name>her son</name>	her son	Justin	The repair work she was doing now for other people was for extra cash to buy clothing or books for [MASK]. “I wish you’d stay and teach him,” she said to me. “Tm afraid he spends too much time with kids who are already breaking into houses and robbing people.
<name>he</name>	he	Marcus	But because [MASK] wasn’t in serious physical pain, we could keep him with us. We gave him a space behind screens—room dividers—in our kitchen. It was warm there, and we had set up a bed, a dresser, a pitcher and basin, and a lamp.
<name>Tracfone</name>	Tracfone	Harry	I did the same in the message I left. Neither couple had found their kids. Both had left numbers. They had bought new phones—the cheap, talk-and-listen, debit phones like [MASK]’s and mine.
<name>Dee</name>	Dee	Jill	That was why she and [MASK] had left home. They had waited until their father drank himself to sleep. Then they set fire to their shack with him in it and ran away. Fire again. What a cleansing friend. What a terrible enemy.
<name>disappears</name>	disappears	Keith	A part of me is gone. Not being able to feel my brothers’ pain is like not being able to hear them when they shout, and I’m afraid. The dream begins to become a nightmare. Without warning, my brother [MASK] vanishes.
<name>Connor</name>	Connor	Marc	Tonight’s walk back to the old man’s house has helped me to relax a little, calm down a little. But not enough. [MASK] was waiting near the long dinner line when I arrived. He looked so handsome and at ease in his clean, stylish, casual clothing.
<name>Malala</name>	Malala	Bankole	No one seems to know. The new women were stuffed in with us or put into the empty third room of the school—the room that was once our clinic. The men were housed in the big room with our men. I need to write about [MASK].
<name>someone</name>	someone	Alan	They look at their children— [MASK] has four kids, too—and they’re afraid and ashamed of their fear, ashamed of their powerlessness. And they’re tired. There are millions of people like them—people who are frightened and just plain tired of all the chaos.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Day	After that, I was more careful. Being lashed hard several times is enough to induce temporary coordination problems and memory loss. [MASK] told me later that he’d seen a man lashed until the man didn’t know his own name. I believe him.
<name>members</name>	members	Acorn	We managed to meet in the field as we worked with only our own community members nearby. We were harvesting—often in the rain—salad greens, onions, potatoes, carrots, and squashes, all planted and tended by [MASK], of course.
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Len	Anyway, [MASK] is a good traveling companion. And she’s an avid reader with an active mind. She says one of the things she misses most about home is computer access to the libraries of the world. She’s well read.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Larkin	“If I can’t live to see it succeed, then, maybe [MASK] can!” I found the words all but impossible to say. It was not a new idea to me that I might not live to see the Destiny fulfilled. But it felt new.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Bankole	This sounded like a small gang raid of a kind we hadn’t had for years. [MASK] and I slipped out of the house together and headed for the truck. For most of the run, we were protected by the bulk first of our own cabin, then of the school.
<name>Sissy</name>	Sissy	Natividad	I’m only two months along, and not showing at all yet. But she would notice, somehow. No matter how distracted and grandmotherly she can seem when she wants to, she doesn’t miss much. We left [MASK] in the housetruck, on watch.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Bankole	“I just got hit by broken rock when those guys were shooting. There was rock flying everywhere.” I went up to take [MASK]’s place, and he went back to check on her. I’m a pretty decent driver now, so I got us back to the houses.
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Tori	“I’m pregnant,” she said. “[MASK] isn’t, but I am.” “It’s a wonder we all aren’t,” I said. “We were slaves. Now we’re free.” I looked at her.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Allie	It was simple and handsome. I ran a hand over it. “[MASK] shouldn’t be in a place like this,” I said. “She’s good at what she does. She should have a shop of her own in some town.”
<name>Jeannine</name>	Jeannine	Len	I nodded. “I think... I think my life would have been so different if my brother had been a sharer, too, instead of his normal, perfect self,” [MASK] said. “It was as though I had leprosy and he didn’t.
<name>Tashi</name>	Tashi	Mary	So, of course he was lashed. But he bought no mercy for his daughter. [MASK] was having terrible convulsions, and they went on lashing her. They lashed both women until neither could scream anymore. They made us watch. I didn’t watch.
<name>politicians</name>	politicians	Jarret	Even people who can read and are educated are apt to pay more attention to good looks and seductive lies than they should. And no doubt the new picture ballots on the nets will give [MASK] an even greater advantage.
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Gray	It wasn’t obvious, but ants came in there, and water spilled near there ran out. [MASK] had promised to fix it, but hadn’t gotten around to it. I moved people away from the area—told them what I was doing and why.
<name>the resistance</name>	the resistance	Jarret	They slice into the flesh of the wild animals who blunder into them. I’ve asked some of the strangers what’s happening outside. Do people know what a reeducation camp really is? Are there other camps? Is there resistance? What’s [MASK] doing?
<name>him</name>	him	Bankole	At first I was horrified and disgusted with myself. I don’t do that. I don’t cry on people. I’ve never been that kind of person. I tried to pull away from [MASK], but he held me. He’s a big man.
<name>Karen</name>	Karen	Kayce	In my neighborhood there were only a few kids, and they were all older than I was. To them I was either a nuisance or a pawn. They ignored me or they got me into trouble. [MASK] and her friends didn’t appreciate any attempts I made to join in their adult conversation.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Cougar	“He’s 17!” [MASK] lied. I laughed and told a lie of my own. “Maybe five or six years ago he was 17. Good god, man, I’m not blind! He’s great-looking, but he’s no kid.”
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Len	They never lost interest. “What will you ask them to do?” [MASK] said to me that night as we settled in again in the guest house. “You have them, you know, even if they don’t realize it yet.” I nodded.
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Kayce	[MASK] wasn’t that bad, but she was more rigid and literal-minded than any human being with normal intelligence should have been, and 1 suffered for it. Anyway, she snatched the doll from me and began slapping my face.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Madison	What should a father be like inside, in his thoughts and feelings? I wasn’t sure. Not like [MASK], for sure. Like the fathers of my occasional friends? 1 saw my friends’ fathers now and then, but I didn’t know them.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Allie	I left some of my money and one of my guns with [MASK] so that I’ll have something to fall back on if I’m robbed. I’ve come first to the message cache—two days’ walk— to see whether anything has been left.
<name>my friend</name>	my friend	Dan	Who says it’s true?” “You do, [MASK].” I let him chew on that for a while, then went on. “You learn, you think, you question. You question us and you question yourself.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Bankole	We can always screw it up. I can always screw it up. There’s so much to be done.” [MASK] went on holding my hands, and I let myself go on talking, thinking aloud. “I wonder sometimes whether I’ll make it.
<name>Scientology</name>	Scientology	Earthseed	“[MASK]?” he said at last. “My god, I’ve heard of you guys. You’re that cult!” “So we’ve been called.” “There was a politician. He was running for the state senate, I think.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Len	If so, she wouldn’t come back. She would get her things and leave the area as soon as she could. She would not stay where someone knew her dangerous secret. All this happened on Friday. I didn’t see [MASK] again until yesterday—Saturday.
<name>politics</name>	politics	Jarret	My father stood by the only phone in the house that servants were allowed to use. He watched as their finger and retinal prints were scanned in. Then he watched them vote.” “I wonder whether it was your abduction that made your father give up on [MASK].”
<name>my mother</name>	my mother	Madison	She was screaming and crying and bleeding, and I was horrified—scared to death. I got kicked out of school, and very nearly collared as a juvenile felon. Only [MASK] and our minister working together managed to keep my neck out of a collar.
<name>Dad</name>	Dad	Bankole	Both boys ran. I took my phone from my pocket and tapped out the emergency bug-out signal. We’ve had bug-out exercises. [MASK] called them that, and the name spread. 1 thought of them as “melt into the mountains” exercises.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Bankole	“[MASK] was awake, but not really alert. He was just sitting on the floor, holding his head between his hands, staring down. They had taken all the furniture out by then, and piled it in a heap out where the trucks were.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Marc	My Larkin would not come. I begged her, but she refused. She’s caring for [MASK]. He’s just getting over another heart transplant. How completely, how thoroughly he has stolen my child. I have never even tried to forgive him.
<name>Marv</name>	Marv	Sargent	He tried to explain, but she wouldn’t listen. Then [MASK] woke up. The next day, he gathered all his whores together, and he staked the girl out naked and made us all gather wood and stack it around her and on top of her with just her head showing.
<name>Richard Nixon</name>	Richard Nixon	Jarret	Filled with righteous superiority and popular among the many frightened, ordinary citizens who only wanted order and stability, the fanatics set up the camps. Meanwhile, [MASK] himself was busy with the ridiculous, obscene Al-Can war.
<name>Darry</name>	Darry	Madison	This was the beginning of the worst part of my adolescence. I was grateful to [MASK]. I hadn’t thought he would fight for me. I hadn’t thought he would fight for anything. He had become even more of a shadow as I had grown.
<name>The Inquisitors</name>	The Inquisitors	Crusaders	She sat down at the table with me. “[MASK]. I’ve heard of them, of course—that they rescue homeless orphans and... burn witches, for heaven’s sake. But I’ve never heard that they.. .just killed people and... stole their children.”
<name>her</name>	her	Len	I glanced at [MASK], caught a little smile on her face, and wound down. “It’s about a lot more than that,” I said. “But those are the bones.” “Makes a strange sermon.” “I know.”
<name>Rast</name>	Rast	Dan	I hate doing this—burning the dead. Of course, whether they’re our dead or someone else’s, it has to be done, but I hate it. We burned [MASK] separate from his attackers. I set his pyre alight myself.
<name>She</name>	She	Di	People complained when she crawled over them, but I asked them to put up with it and [MASK] apologized and the complaints stopped. We were still human, still civilized. I wondered how long that would last. “Someone’s here!”
<name>Nathan</name>	Nathan	Dan	It was possible that these men had spotted the truck from one of the ridges, then circled around to attack them. [MASK] thought they had. The intruders had rounded the wall and, an instant later, opened fire on the family. They caught all seven Noyers outside the truck.
<name>mother</name>	mother	Bankole	Now that we’ve got the truck, traveling is a lot less dangerous than it used to be, but my [MASK] is more worried than ever. And, to tell the truth, there are still things to worry about.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Dan	I paused, thinking of how well [MASK] had done just that when he tried to rescue his parents. “It doesn’t always work the way we want it to,” I said. “But it’s always worth the effort.”
<name>Neo</name>	Neo	Lauren	I put the rock in his hands. “If I were to analyze this stone and find out exactly what it’s made of, would that mean I made it up?” “That’s not a good comparison, [MASK]. The rock exists.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Dan	I sighed. “I can’t promise anything, [MASK], but we’ll do what we can. And we need you to help us. Travel with us to street markets, stores, and shops in nearby communities. Help us to look for them.”
<name>Marilyn</name>	Marilyn	Olamina	To those who loved her or hated her, she was simply “[MASK].” She was my biological mother. She is dead. I have wanted to love her and to believe that what happened between her and me wasn’t her fault. I’ve wanted that.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Noriko	Instead, I sat up, bumped someone, apologized, sat stupidly for a while, then found the sense to say, “Who else is here? One by one, say your names.” “[MASK],” a voice said just to my left.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Obsessed	He raised his hands and gave me an ironic round of applause. “I knew you would say something like that. Well, I never thought you were stupid. [MASK], perhaps, but not stupid. That being the case, I have a proposition for you.”
<name>Carlisle</name>	Carlisle	Dan	I said, “Sure,” then had to fend off several other people who wanted me to eat with them. [MASK]’s expression made me think it was time for him and me to have some version of the talk that I always seem to wind up having with newcomers.
<name>Heisenberg</name>	Heisenberg	Gray	Making it explode had to take a conscious effort—unless it was the maggot that exploded. I don’t know for sure. But knowing [MASK], I suspect he did something to cause the explosion. I believe he chose to die. He is dead.
<name>Abby</name>	Abby	Allie	And... I want my kids back. I’m scared to death of what might be happening to them. That’s all I can think about now. That’s all I care about.” And [MASK] put her hand on his shoulder, trying to give comfort.
<name>Milton</name>	Milton	Donner	The idea is that all nonmilitary space travel, manned and unmanned, should be privatized. “If it’s worth doing at all,” [MASK] said, “it should be done for profit, and not as a burden on the taxpayers.”
<name>Marlena</name>	Marlena	Zahra	But this time [MASK] hadn’t come to talk about my drawing. “So you’re going to leave!” she hissed at me as soon as we were alone. She looked angry and bitter. Here and there around us, people found their own Gathering Day amusements.
<name>Max</name>	Max	Harry	No screen, no net access, no message storage. But at least we’ll be able to talk to one another.” “But your chances of surviving alone on the road—” He got up and walked toward the door. “[MASK]!”
<name>Chris</name>	Chris	Bankole	[MASK] took him out to one of our composting toilets. I didn’t see him until later when he had washed and dressed. Then he came hesitant and tentative, to my kitchen table. “Hungry?” I asked. “Sit down.”
<name>Jimmy</name>	Jimmy	Bankole	“Shit,” [MASK] said, and turned his face to the wall. Now the long day is over. We’ve cleaned up the hillside battlefield and thrown ground pepper over parts of it so that any smell of blood that still clings to it wouldn’t hold the attention of wild dogs.
<name>Cassius</name>	Cassius	Asha	He paused. “You know, your mama wanted to let you go on and be collared. She thinks you hurt that girl on purpose.” Another pause. “You need to be nice to me, [MASK]. I’m all you’ve got.”
<name>Titus</name>	Titus	Mary	Better me than [MASK]’s father. He isn’t in his right mind either. He was forced to watch his child tortured to death. He just wanders around, staring. Our teachers lash him, and he screams from the pain, but when they finish, he’s no different.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Cougar	He opened his eyes and looked at me. “You haven’t asked how I wound up with [MASK].” “I want to know,” I admitted. “Simple. My first night walking the freeway, three guys jumped me—big guys.
<name>Maxine</name>	Maxine	Bankole	[MASK] and I are already Change-sister and -brother to them and Change-aunt and -uncle to their children. Now it goes the other way as well. We each stand ready to parent one another’s children.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Jarret	Now, though, as they’re more able to meet their own immediate needs, they begin to look around, feel dissatisfied with the slow pace of change, and with [MASK], who with his war and his Crusaders, has slowed it even more.
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Jarret	“It’s about a lot more than that,” I said. “But those are the bones.” “Makes a strange sermon.” “I know.” “You need to do what [MASK] does.” “What!”
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Harry	We’ve tried to trick it—fool it into mistaking one of us playing dead for an actual corpse—and we’ve never been able to. That’s comforting. “All right,” [MASK] said, looking up from his screen.
<name>Malala</name>	Malala	Acorn	I’ve fed a few ragged parent-child groups because it’s hard for me to see hungry children and do nothing at all. Yet I couldn’t do much. What’s a meal, after all? With [MASK], I had done more.
<name>Cassius</name>	Cassius	Marcus	[MASK], younger, smaller, but always stubborn, always tough, punches back. I grab each boy’s fist and squeeze. I’m bigger and stronger than both of them and I’ve always had strong hands. The boys squirm in pain and try to pull away.
<name>she</name>	she	Len	That was very compelling, somehow, that complete acceptance and trust. It was hard for me to leave her. By the time we did leave, she was as much with me as [MASK] was. The verses and the sketches and memories will keep her with me for a while.
<name>him</name>	him	Marc	Things would have gone better for [MASK] if he had done his homework, and things would have been more interesting and involving for his audience. He might even have won over a Faircloth or a Peralta. I had worried about that.
