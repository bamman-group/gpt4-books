<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Ondine	“Okay, okay.” “You have to believe me.” “I don’t smell anything on her breath; maybe she just flipped.” [MASK] was mumbling again. “Can’t you get her to a chair?”
<name>He</name>	He	Jadine	Just a quick snatch of breath before that woman’s woman—that mother/sister/she; that unphotographable beauty—took it all away. [MASK] followed her profile, then her back as she passed the store window—followed her all the way to the edge of the world where the plate glass stopped.
<name>Lucien</name>	Lucien	Jadine	Sein de Vieilles. It couldn’t have been very comfortable for you there. The local people avoid it entirely. Spirits live there, I’m told.” The man didn’t answer. “Did you see any ghosts while you were there?” [MASK] asked him.
<name>Leon</name>	Leon	Th£r£se	Why not over the other side, or up the road where those Fili*-pinos are? He must have been looking for somebody specific.” "The chippy. The fast-ass,” said [MASK]. “That’s why he went straight up to her room.
<name>Amara</name>	Amara	Cheyenne	He was silent then too as he ran his car through the house and the bed caught on fire. He pulled them both out— the teenager and [MASK]—but she didn’t make it. He watched her wrappings but not her eyes in the hospital and still no sound.
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Margaret	The point was not consorting with Negroes, the point was her ignorance and her origins. It was a nasty quarrel and their first in which they said regrettable things to each other that resulted in not touching toes in the night. It frightened [MASK]—the possibility of losing him.
<name>Arvid</name>	Arvid	Gideon	Son stood up. “I can’t eat,” he said. “And I’ve been awake for days. Sleep won’t come and I can’t get hungry.” “Come with me then,” said [MASK]. "Let’s go out.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Ondine	The roots of her sunset hair were brown. She held her head that way for a moment and said, “You have to forgive me for that, [MASK]. You have to.” “You forgive you. Don’t ask for more.”
<name>Pepto-Bismol</name>	Pepto-Bismol	Postum	“You are determined to make me have an ulcer. I don’t have an ulcer. You have an ulcer. I have occasional irregularity.” “I had an ulcer. It’s gone now and [MASK] helped it go." “I’m delighted.
<name>Roark</name>	Roark	Margaret	“By what, pray? By my removing a pair of thieves from my house?” “No, by not telling her,” said [MASK]. “So what? All of a sudden I’m beholden to a cook for the welfare of two people she hated anyway?
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Son	“Lazy. Really lazy. I never thought I’d hear a black man admit it.” She rubbed the line with her thumb and frowned. “Uh-uh. I’m not admitting any such thing.” [MASK]'s voice cracked with indignation.
<name>Sula</name>	Sula	Son	But their worshipful stares and nonconversation made [MASK]'s absence seem much too long. She was getting annoyed when she remembered her camera. Now she was having a ball photographing everybody. Soldier’s yard was full. “Beautiful,” she said. “Fantastic.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sydney	"What?”—looking down at her plate. It was all right, nothing spilled, nothing broken: lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber all there. Then [MASK] set the bowl on the table and picked up the salad spoon and fork. She had left them on the table.
<name>McGivney</name>	McGivney	Dominique	to After thirty years of shame the champion daisy trees were marshaling for war. The wild parrots that had escaped the guns of [MASK] could feel menace in the creeping of their roots. During the day they tossed their branches; at night they walked the hills.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Valerian	"You should take care of yourself, too. You need a haircut. ’’ “I prefer it long,” said [MASK]. “No, you don’t. You just don't want to go into town. The mulatto’s here today.
<name>Mrs. Ramsay</name>	Mrs. Ramsay	Sydney	Nothing can happen to us as long as she’s here.” [MASK] went out with the tray on which a steaming potato in a covered dish was situated to the left of an empty wineglass, a napkin and a stack of mail.
<name>Blue</name>	Blue	Son	The girl’s face was as tight and mean as broccoli, her forefinger shot bullets into the pavement. But inside her narrowed angry eyes were many other eyes—some of them hurt, some brave, some just lonely hollow-eyes, and her shaved head reminded [MASK] of his sister.
<name>She</name>	She	Jadine	“Sure.” She gestured toward the escritoire for him to help himself. He pulled out a Gauloise filter, lit it and began to cough. “Been a long time,” he said, and for the first time looked vulnerable. [MASK] grabbed the leashes.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Margaret	‘What did he say?” asked [MASK]. “When you all had dinner? Did he say what he was doing here?” “Oh, he said he was hiding. That he’d been looking for food after he jumped ship a few days ago.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Valerian	He held the arm over the record and turned to [MASK]. “We’ll give you the best of care. Just like we always done. That’s something you ain’t never got to worry about.” He placed the arm carefully in the groove and turned the volume up high.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Valerian	“She’s drunk,” said [MASK] with the wisdom of the drunk, “and nobody’s paid her any attention for a whole hour.” “Why don’t you believe me?” She looked around at them all.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Margaret	“I suppose you are decorating the house with guests for Christmas. Push that salt over here, will you?” “Why would you suppose that?” [MASK] stretched out a hand, a beautifully manicured hand, and passed him the salt and pepper.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Margaret	[MASK] chattered and thought up extra niceties for the holidays and ended by insisting that she would cook the Christmas dinner herself. It was to be a really old-fashioned Christmas, and that required the woman of the house to be bustling in the kitchen with an apron roasting turkey and baking apple pies.
<name>Shakespeare</name>	Shakespeare	Bridges	"He won’t come. You’ve misled him entirely.” “What are you talking about? He’s on his way. His trunk’s already been shipped.” “That is not a line from anything [MASK] ever wrote.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Jadine	[MASK] felt the fear again and another thing that wasn’t fear. Something more like shame. Because he was holding my wrists so tight and pressing himself into my behind? God, what a nasty motherfucker. Really nasty. Stink nasty. Maybe that was it.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Valerian	[MASK] stood up. “Over there, that can. Spray the doorsill. It won’t do much good, but it will help for a while, and tuck that muslin in tighter.” The man did as he was told and then said, “You ought to get mirrors.”
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Sydney	“No, you don’t. You just don't want to go into town. The mulatto’s here today. If you won’t let me cut it, let him take you over.” “What mulatto?” [MASK] slit open a letter with a penknife.
<name>Mouse</name>	Mouse	August	You can, but I can’t.” “What the hell do you do that’s so jive you can’t take it out of the city and do it there?” “I pay the bills is what I do.” It was [MASK].
<name>Sally</name>	Sally	Jadine	I wanted you relaxed, like you were before. You were sassy before and rubbing your ankles with your hands.” [MASK] looked at him trying to figure out whether he was the man who understood potted plants or the man who drove through houses.
<name>Antoinette</name>	Antoinette	Jadine	And when the vision materialized in a yellow dress [MASK] was not sure it was not all part of her list—an addition to the coconut and tamarind, a kind of plus to go with the limes and pimiento. Another piece of her luck.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jade	Not even a hundred.” "You liar. I should have known. I was going to ask [MASK] about that.” "She wants to open up a little shop of some sort,” he said. "You’re mumbling.” “Shop.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Gideon	“He’s a horseman come down here to get her. He was just skulking around waiting for his chance.” "Maybe. Maybe.” [MASK] looked at her milky eyes. “You damn near blind, but I have to hand it to you.
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Ondine	"[MASK], what would you have done differently if you had known? You would have grumbled, and tried to make me keep them on. And since they were obviously stealing, and the whole house was upset anyway, I did what I thought was best.”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Sydney	Good sense. That was what surprised her. She talked sense she didn’t know she had about a situation that both frightened and disoriented her. But in talking to [MASK] she knew what it was. The man was black.
<name>Marina</name>	Marina	Jade	The avocado tree watched her go then folded its leaves tightly over its fruit. When [MASK] got near the greenhouse she thought she saw two figures behind the translucent panes. One was gesticulating wildly. Her heart pounding, she raced to the open door and peeped in.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Jadine	[MASK] dropped the leashes. “Where did you see that?” “I didn’t see it. I heard it.” “Where?” She could not find them, they were gone. “The woman who comes to work here.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Margaret	He’s crazy and beautiful and black and poor and beautiful and he killed a woman but he doesn’t want you. He wants me and I have the fingerprint to prove it. But she didn’t say any of that; she said she wanted to sleep now. [MASK] left but her alarm stayed behind.
<name>Wemmick</name>	Wemmick	Sydney	“Why don’t you believe me?” She looked around at them all. They looked back at her, each thinking why, indeed, he didn’t; and then they heard the footsteps of [MASK] plus one.
<name>Raymond</name>	Raymond	Son	It was almost four when [MASK] said, “I didn’t come by myself.” “You with a woman?” “Yeah." “Where is she?” “Over to Soldier’s. Can she stay here?” “You all married?”
<name>Sal</name>	Sal	Jadine	A deer, thought [MASK]. She has the eyes of a curious deer. She wished once more that she had had real talent—she’d like to draw her—deer eyes, wig and all. Suddenly she reached into the side pocket of her traveling bag.
<name>Boo</name>	Boo	Sydney	“Hush up.” [MASK] wiped his mouth with the pale blue napkin. “You be around all day today?” “Most of it. But I may have to take the boat back to town.” “What for? More Christmas shopping?”
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	Sydney	"It's not a shed,” said [MASK]. “It’s a greenhouse I keep telling you.” 'Whatever you call it.” “He grows hydrangeas in there. And dahlias." “If he wants hydrangeas he should go back home.
<name>Roark</name>	Roark	Valerian	He will though, because I promised him this really terrific present.” ‘What? Can you tell me?” “A poet,” said [MASK]. “She’s giving him his favorite poet for Christmas. Isn’t that so, love?”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Ondine	You told [MASK] you got into some trouble with the law and jumped bail.” “I didn’t want to go to prison.” “But-” “That’s not the same thing. I didn’t want their punishment. I wanted my own.”
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Jadine	The silver tray of walnuts, the equally silver bowl of peaches he brought in, and a jiffy later, the coffee—all were exacdy and surreptitiously placed on the table. One hardly knew if he left the room or stood in some shadowy comer of it. [MASK] leaned her cheek on her fist.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Jadine	Didn’t he introduce you?” “Go to sleep, [MASK].” “I can’t. I’m tired, but not sleepy.” “You’re agitated. Calm down.” “You won’t bother me? I don’t want to wresde.”
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Valerian	"The first time in her life she tries to boil water and I get slapped in the face. Keep that bitch out of my kitchen. She’s not fit to enter it. She’s no cook and she’s no mother.” [MASK] stood up.
<name>Suttree</name>	Suttree	Son	"That didn’t have no eyebrows either I bet.” “I should have made him some with a razor.” They laughed together then and an hour or so passed while [MASK] told what all he’d been doing for the last eight years.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Sydney	She was bored and no more together than the river rat. She kept calling him that. River rat. [MASK] called him swamp nigger. What the hell did he say his name was and even if she could remember it would she say it out loud without reaching for the leash?
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Jadine	“Why not?” He stayed near the piano but looked directly at her, the question apparently important to him. [MASK] took a few steps toward him. “I don’t have to explain anything to you.” "But I said I’m sorry.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Gideon	It’s good to have some plain Pennsylvania food for a change. This is an old-fashioned Christmas.” “Too bad [MASK] couldn’t come.” Son, who seemed to be the only one genuinely enjoying the food, had been silent until then.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Sydney	“I thought all he ate was sunflowers and molasses these days.” [MASK] shrugged. “Last time I saw him he ate a mighty lot of steak.” "And fresh coconut cake. The whole cake as I recall.” "That’s your fault.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Son	Can I ask you somethin?” “Sure. Ask it.” “How come you never put no note or nothin in them envelopes? I kept on lookin for a note.” [MASK] stopped. How hurried all those money order purchases had been.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Margaret	Who else but an old fool would marry a high school dropout off the back of a truck!” “A float!" [MASK] shouted, and when the wineglass bounced from the centerpiece of calla lilies and rolled toward him he didn’t even look at it.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Jadine	I have a picture of the other one. It’s at home. Is he coming back? Can you get it for me?” "No,” [MASK] answered. “You kill him?” asked the girl in a very matter-of-fact tone.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Jadine	That’s it. Poodle-cut,” and she laughed with such pleasure that [MASK] had to smile. “I’m sorry about leaving you with so little notice. I don’t want you to think I didn’t appreciate your helping me out last winter.”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Valerian	[MASK] had not thought of that yet; he had been living with just the picture of the boy under the sink and had only been hearing the la la la, la la la, but now he realized that was part of his anger.
<name>John</name>	John	Sydney	[MASK] was right. It was his bone. Whether they liked it or not. But she was right, too. He had to drop it. The man upstairs wasn’t a Negro—meaning one of them. He was a stranger.
<name>Sula</name>	Sula	Ondine	Old black people must be a worrisome thing to the young ones these days.” [MASK] went to the oven and removed a baked potato. She put it on a plate and the plate on a tray. Then she went to the refrigerator and removed a wineglass that had been chilling there.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Sydney	A good long time.” “What’s happening here. Something’s happening here." “Don’t agitate yourself. Rest your mind.” [MASK] put down the wineglass, and went to the record player.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jadine	In the center of the room, [MASK] stopped, released his hand and turned to face him. She pressed her fingers together in front of her lips. “Awful,” she said frowning, looking at the floor. “Don’t think about it.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Son	Backs straight, shoulders high—alert but restful in the security of the Napoleonic Code. Somewhere in the back of [MASK]’s mind one hundred black men on one hundred unshod horses rode blind and naked through the hills and had done so for hundreds of years.
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Son	The man did not speak and did not smile; he kept on staring. Then he raised his hands, clenching them into fists, and began to jump up and down on both feet, stamping the floor like a kid jumping rope. [MASK] was laughing soundlessly.
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Jadine	Inhuman and therefore unworthy. No man should live without absorbing the sins of his kind, the foul air of his innocence, even if it did wilt rows of angel trumpets and cause them to fall from their vines. 9 “This is a town?” [MASK] shouted.
<name>Thad</name>	Thad	Valerian	What? What is it?” But she would not stop. She just balled her beautiful hands into fists and pummeled her own temples, screaming louder. [MASK] stared through port-softened eyes at his wife as though he, not she, were in pain.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Nanadine	“It’s over, [MASK]. I don’t know what got into me.” “You could have told us.” “Maybe. But everything was so messed up here. I mean that was some Christmas.” “You still could have told us.”
<name>Peppermint</name>	Peppermint	Kirk	It was nothing like the blue of her eyes. “Sometimes in the morning he can’t do everything he used to. You know: buttons, zippers. I have to tie his shoes even. Yesterday I washed his hair”—she smiled—“with [MASK]’s Original Castile Soap.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ondine	"Did you . . . ah . . ." “No, sir, I didn’t. I heard about it same time you did.” “[MASK] never told you?” “Not a word.” "I hear them in the kitchen.
<name>Maude</name>	Maude	Valerian	“I’ll tell it. She wants to meddle in my kitchen, fooling around with pies. And my help gets fired!” 'Yowr kitchen? Your help?” [MASK] was astonished. “Yes my kitchen and yes my help. If not mine, whose?”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Margaret	"He doesn’t care all that much for us, [MASK].” “You,” she said, “he doesn’t care all that much for you.” "Whatever you say.” “Then I can go?” “We’ll see.
<name>Lucien</name>	Lucien	Valerian	That maybe this time there would be that feeling of rescue between them as it had been when he had taken him from underneath the sink. Thus when the black man appeared, [MASK] was already in complicity with an overripe peach, and took on its implicit dare.
<name>Chango</name>	Chango	Gideon	Maybe he’s not a rider. Maybe he’s an old boyfriend and he the one sent her the box, [MASK].” "Hold on. You going wild.” “And machete-hair she don’t like it. Tried to keep them apart.
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Son	The very notion of warm beer in his empty stomach sickened him. He refused. “You sick, man. Not just your head either. Why can’t you let her go?” “Let her go?” asked [MASK], and he smiled a crooked smile.
<name>John</name>	John	Valerian	He stood there, his arms over his head, while the muggers, some black teenagers with rags around their heads, ran their fingers through his pockets. One of them looked at him and must have seen the disdain in [MASK]’s eyes.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Certified	[MASK]. It took some time before she could fall asleep. The soap had done its job. The little feet he wanted so badly to see were clean again, peachy soft again as though they had never been touched and never themselves had touched the ground.
<name>John</name>	John	Sydney	It was his bone. Whether they liked it or not. But she was right, too. He had to drop it. The man upstairs wasn’t a Negro—meaning one of them. He was a stranger. (She had made [MASK] understand that.)
<name>He</name>	He	Soldier	“Yeah. I guess you right about that.” [MASK] smiled. “But maybe it’s better’n not thinkin at all.” “How would you know?” she asked him. He laughed. “You a hot one, ain’t you?”
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Valerian	[MASK] said nothing; he only stared at her. She was even lovelier now that her hair had no spray in it, that it was not tortured into Art Deco, now that it hung according to its own will and the shape of her head.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Th£r£se	It was raining a little, getting foggier, but the sea was not high. [MASK] insisted on steering for she knew the way, she said, and could not talk the directions to him. The feel of the current was what she went by.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Joe	They were flattered by his letters, but could not understand the sudden affection from a great-nephew they did not remember. For a year they declined to pay a visit on account of advanced age, until [MASK] offered to pay their bus fare.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Margaret	She shook her head back and forth back and forth in wonder. “No,” she said. “I wasn’t thirty-five. I was twenty-three. A girl. Just like you.” [MASK] put her forehead into her palm.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Ondine	“Turkey.” [MASK] looked at her husband over her shoulder. “Don’t fool with me this morning.” “And apple pie.” “You better get me a plane ticket out of here.” She straightened. “Calm down, girl.”
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Valerian	Go to snake dances?” “I’m going to live near him. Not with him, near him.” “It won’t work.” “Why not?” [MASK] put his palms down on either side of his plate.
<name>Garrett</name>	Garrett	Valerian	It had certainly taken the zing out of the magazine cover as well as her degree. Beyond the window etched against the light of a blazing moon she could see the hills at the other side of the island where one hundred horsemen rode one hundred horses, so [MASK] said.
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Michael	When he knew for certain that [MASK] would always be a stranger to,him, he built the greenhouse as a place of controlled ever-flowering life to greet death in. It seemed a simple, modest enough wish to him. Normal, decent—like his life.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Son	“What’ll we do now?” “Sleep,” he said. “I can’t sleep. It was so ugly. Did you see the faces?” [MASK] kissed her cheek, bending his neck down low. “It’s true, isn’t it?
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Michael	He could not say to her that he hoped far more than she did that [MASK] would come. That maybe this time there would be that feeling of rescue between them as it had been when he had taken him from underneath the sink.
<name>Miss</name>	Miss	Jade	“Yes, ma’am. I’ll see to it.” “Thank you. Is [MASK] down yet?” “Not yet, ma’am.” “When she is, tell her I’ll be ready at ten.” “Yes, ma’am.”
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Jadine	,” said the girl. “Oh, wow.” [MASK] smiled. “I didn’t recognize you. What are you doing here? You work here now?” The girl nodded. "You took the chocolate eater away,” she said.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Son	And to listen to the four/four time of her heels. [MASK] sat there wagging his knees back and forth like a schoolboy. Not thinking most of the important things there were to think about: What would they do? Where would they go, live?
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Yardman	If they tear loose from me, they free. I can’t chase em anymore. I don’t even know if I got the strength to wring their necks.” “Well, what you don’t have the strength for, [MASK] is supposed to do.
<name>Holly</name>	Holly	Nanadine	“It’s just a Christmas present, [MASK].” “It’s not just anything, honey. I could buy a house with what that cost.” “No, you couldn’t.” “I’d lock it up somewhere if I were you.”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Son	Arm around her shoulder, he led the way to a Chinese restaurant and ordered her gin. She drank and began to tell him about the man, but [MASK] shook his head. “Don’t,” he said. “Don’t think about it.
<name>Clary</name>	Clary	Jadine	"Should I be scared?” asked [MASK]. "Not if you have to ask.” “I’m serious.” “So am I.” ‘Who was he? The man you killed?” He stood up, untangling himself gracefully but swifdy.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Son	Suddenly a bite and he reeled in a huge glitter of froth and steel. The friends watched admiringly as the fish flopped into death. But when [MASK] bent down to remove the hook, the fish executed a dazzling final arc three feet above the deck and slapped his face.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Ondine	[MASK] sensed his absorption of her apartment. “Not as grand, I suppose, as where you sleep.” Now he did smile. “Too grand,” he said. “Much too grand for me. I feel out of place there.”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Valerian	“Hit me,” she said softly. “Hit me, [MASK].” His shuddering fingers went wild at the thought of touching her, making physical contact with that skin. His whole body recoiled. "No,” he said. “No.”
<name>She</name>	She	Margaret	That was the beginning and he knew there would be more of them. For now he would settle for this bright burning. [MASK] opened her eyes and looked into his. “Hit me,” she said softly.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Sydney	[MASK] will chop you, slice you . . “No, they won’t.” “You rape me and they’ll feed you to the alligators. Count on it, nigger. You good as dead right now." “Rape?
<name>Chigurh</name>	Chigurh	Jadine	so I turned the car around and drove it through the house.” “You ran over them?” [MASK]’s upper lip was lifted in disgust. “No, I just busted up the place. But the car exploded and the bed caught on fire.
