<name>Stevenson</name>	Stevenson	Polly	“Oh,” said the engine-driver, “I don’t care.” How many bones did [MASK] break? One, two, three, four . . . The chant continues, repeats itself; the rope revolves, a vibrating blur in the air, enclosing an ellipsoid of charmed space.
<name>Art</name>	Art	Fred	She lowers her slime-green, thick-lashed eyelids, leans toward him. “Anyhow, what does a hunk like you want with a bag that age?” “I—” [MASK] suppresses the impulse to defend his love; there’s no time to lose.
<name>Reggie</name>	Reggie	Chuck	She imagines [MASK] as a fall guy, a kind of debased stuntman made to perform over and over again for the amusement of his wife’s relatives. “Well, if it’s going to be like that, don’t tell them.” “Yeh-uh.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Chuck	(She hasn’t been affected by any such hallucination in this case—rather the reverse: when she is with [MASK] she feels more than usually small, intellectual, and timid.) Even more often, outsiders conflate the couple, and credit them with each other’s characteristics.
<name>Marilyn</name>	Marilyn	Rosemary	Television, on the other hand, is shot in tiny segments: it doesn’t require an extended and developed performance, only a concentrated brief intensity of expression, something [MASK] is certainly capable of—even famous for—in private life.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Fred	By the time [MASK] gets back to his flat and his typewriter most of the working day will be gone. On the other hand, if he’d stayed home he probably wouldn’t have accomplished damn-all either.
<name>anyone</name>	anyone	Myrna	The place was quiet, and 1 didn’t have to talk to [MASK], or watch the maid hustling around, following me all over the house with the damn vacuum cleaner. If I felt real bad, I’d keep at the booze till I passed out.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Chuck	“Let me take that shopping bag,” she says, changing the subject. “Naw. You sit right there and rest. I’ll manage.” In spite of her doubts, [MASK] does manage, warming and serving the supper with skill and dispatch.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Vinnie	“You’re a good woman,” he said during her story, and again at its end; and for the first time [MASK] almost believed him. She isn’t a good woman; but perhaps she has done one good thing.
<name>She</name>	She	Vinnie	“How about fifty pence?” “Okay.” The reply is animated, almost avid. [MASK] realizes she’s offered much more than was expected. She gets out her notebook and pen; then, noticing the child’s suspicious stare, she rummages in her purse.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Vinnie	The hot-water bottle is lukewarm, and the carpet by the bed is littered with damp wads of paper, offensive to her natural tidiness; but she is too weary and depressed to do anything about either discomfort. [MASK]’s cold is an embarrassment to her as well as an irritation.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Roo	Or even their asses—“great buns,” he had heard that was the term— But [MASK], still fuming, interrupted him. “That’s not where it’s at, pal. Women aren’t interested in men’s behinds, that’s a fag thing.”
<name>She</name>	She	Vinnie	“No, thanks.” He gives her a brief smile, a longer stare. [MASK], uneasy, returns neither. “Well then,” she begins, “maybe you’d like—” “Y’know what I’d like?”
<name>Holly</name>	Holly	Vinnie	I’ll even try the opera, if I can get us some decent seats.” “Well . . .” With considerable difficulty [MASK] rights herself and crawls backward into bed, dragging the telephone and the comforter with her. “I don’t know.”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Fred	Instead she sits up away from [MASK], with her fair, fine hair tumbling over her face. “You’re not really going back to the States next month,” she says, with a half lazy, half threatening whispery intonation like the sound of his grandfather stropping a razor.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Fred	“I mean, suppose he was to wake up alone in a strange room? It could be a serious trauma.” “Well, okay.” For days [MASK] has been looking forward to the meeting between his old friends and his new love.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Vinnie	This strategy was brilliantly successful. The more generous and sensitive of her lovers were relieved of the fear that [MASK] might take them too seriously, and suffer as a consequence; the less generous and sensitive were relieved of the fear that she might “make trouble.’’
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Vinnie	“There’s a tearoom here in the store, but it’s awfully expen-sive. “No sweat. I’m taking you.” “Well. All right.” [MASK] leads the way past elaborate ziggurats of biscuits and candied fruits and up the steps to the mezzanine.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	William	He goes on packing [MASK]’s clothes, faster than before. Though most of them are clean, they now feel disagreeable: the tightly rolled thin dark lisle socks, the slippery starched shirts with the name of a Belgravia laundry on the paper band.
<name>Trimalchio</name>	Trimalchio	Nigel	“Almost everyone here was invited for some ulterior purpose, as usual. They’re connected with the firm, or with some paper, or they’re in the theater—though I hear [MASK]’s very disappointed because so few of our leading dramatis personae have shown up.
<name>Stahr</name>	Stahr	Fred	(“You have very original ideas on the cinema, [MASK], I think very exciting. I suppose that you know many people in the American film industry, or in the American theater, perhaps, that you have discussed these theories with? . . .
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Rosemary	He has hardly spoken to any of the natives, except as a tourist might; he hasn’t seen a single one of the many people he met through [MASK]. Or, to be more accurate, he hasn’t seen them in the flesh.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Chuck	Is there some awful parallel between [MASK]’s fantasy of being an English lord and hers of being—in a more subtle and metaphysical sense, of course—an English lady? Might there be someone somewhere as impatiently scornful of her pretensions as she is of his?
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Chuck	she wonders, realizing she has no idea of the probable recreations of someone like [MASK]. “Travel, visit your friends, read”—Read? Is this likely?—“play golf, go fishing”—Are there any fish in Oklahoma?—“take up some hobbies—” “Yeh, that’s what my wife tells me.
<name>Stuart</name>	Stuart	Fred	But [MASK] had no wish to sleep with ten screwed-up freshmen, or even with one carefully selected well-balanced freshman. He wasn’t attracted to puppy fat and unformed minds; and though in a couple of cases he was tempted, he had a strong sense of professional ethics.
<name>Arnie</name>	Arnie	Fred	[MASK] would have liked to worry them a little more—but not at the cost of failing school, scrambling his brains permanently with acid, or wrecking the battered tail-finned Buick he had delivered papers in zero weather and mowed lawns for five years to earn.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Roo	Yeh, maybe. But however bad her taste, [MASK] is a person he used to care a lot for, and his wife. The least she deserves from him now is the truth. But how can he give her that?
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Vinnie	Moreover, as was perhaps necessary for the ploy to work, it wasn’t quite a lie. As she had done in early adolescence, [MASK] allowed herself to fix her romantic desires on men she hardly knew and seldom saw.
<name>Clifford</name>	Clifford	Fred	For the next eighteen hours [MASK] was in a bad state of mind. He called—or, in the British phrase, “rang”—several times, starting at ten a.m., but couldn’t get through her answering service. Either she was out, or she was angry with him.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Chuck	That she can accept; can affirm. Physical pleasure of the sort she’s known with [MASK] does improve the entire world; it becomes a humming, spinning top in which all the discordant colors are blurred and whirled into a harmony that spirals out from that center.
<name>Yvette</name>	Yvette	Fred	With [MASK]’s help, the surprisingly heavy baby and his canvas sling are transferred to his father’s back, where the whimpering and squeaking resume. “Maybe if he had a cracker or something.” “Sure.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Vinnie	“Oh, don’t be ridiculous. It’s probably somewhere back at your hotel.” “Come on, [MASK]. I left it right here, day before yesterday.” His grin widened. “You hid my raincoat; I can see it in your eyes.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Chuck	But she did gradually manage to persuade [MASK] not to carry around so many maps and guidebooks, and to leave his cameras and light meters at the hotel— suggesting that she could guide him, and that his constant picturetaking interfered with conversation.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Vinnie	The hermit was standing in front of it, with a scraggy beard and long hair and a droopy straw hat like some old bag lady.” “Still, there’s no proof it was your ancestor,” [MASK] says. “It was him all right.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Edwin	“I can make it. My plane isn’t until noon.” “Well—” “I want to.” “If you insist,” [MASK] says with a sigh. “But promise me you won’t try to get into the house until I come.”
<name>She</name>	She	Roo	They had prepared for the trip together, read books, studied maps, consulted all their friends—[MASK] even more excited by their plans than he was. But a domestic storm had blown up: thunder, lightning, and a torrential downpour of tears.
<name>Blackie</name>	Blackie	Shara	But I wanted to be with [MASK]. I figure this might be her last good year—she’s nearly as old as I am, and after twenty you never know with a horse. She can still work up a fair speed, but she gets winded.
<name>Whiskers</name>	Whiskers	Fido	Perhaps because she is still a little blurry from sleep, she imagines [MASK] hearing it too under the sofa where he has been more or less hibernating for the past two months; waking, blinking open his huge mournful brown eyes.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Vinnie	Again [MASK] agrees, but in such a way as to make it clear that she does not choose to converse. She shifts her body and the tissuey sheets of the paper toward the window, though nothing can be seen there.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Vinnie	“Oh no,” [MASK] always replies, concealing her irritation. Of course she feels frightened, of course she gets lonely—how stupid can they be? Obviously she only puts up with it because for her the alternative is worse.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Fred	Her welcome seems doubtful to [MASK], for she is not only late but ill-equipped. She has forgotten her lantern; and small as she is her hooded robe is far too short; it doesn’t reach the ground by almost a foot, and exposes a pair of modern pumps.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Rosemary	Finally, about six, [MASK] rang back. She was as affectionate as ever, “simply longing” to see him. She denied she’d been cross; wouldn’t even discuss it; welcomed him passionately at her front door an hour later.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Fred	He looks insulted; probably he has never heard of a wimp and thinks it is something unspeakable. “Sorry,” [MASK] says. “Look, maybe you could just pile up those books and papers, all right?’
<name>Muriel</name>	Muriel	Mumpson	It can only clog up their brain cells with useless data, and is moreover often invidious, tending to estrange casual acquaintances. ([MASK]’s brother-in-law, like many before him, has just remarked to her, “You’re an English teacher?
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Rosemary	“Goddamned bitch,” he cries to the empty parking lot, and much more. He says to himself that [MASK] is cold-hearted, cruel; that all her words and gestures—some rise to consciousness, but he shoves them down again—were false, theatrical.
<name>Pamela</name>	Pamela	Macheath	Like [MASK]’s, it follows one of the classic literary patterns of the eighteenth century, in which a man meets and seduces an innocent woman, then abandons her. Sometimes he merely “trifles with her affections”; at other times he rapes her.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Fred	A revulsion from the thousands of undead objects that surround him on all sides seizes [MASK], and he starts to walk, then to run toward the staircase and the exit. Outside the vast cocoa-colored mausoleum he takes deep breaths of a living air that smells of auto exhaust and cut grass.
<name>Lolita</name>	Lolita	Posy	“What’s that noise outside? It sounds like a car.” In the white sailor-boy blouse she has just pulled on over her long pleated red silk dress, [MASK] runs to the window and pushes aside the heavy velvet curtain. “Oh, my God.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Fred	“You think I’m a little fool, don’t you,” she says, her voice shaking in a way [MASK] has never heard before. “You think I’m a—what is it you said of your cousin, an easy pushover.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Vinnie	No one has been to see [MASK] in her illness either, mainly because she hasn’t encouraged anyone to come. Whenever she’s depressed or under the weather her instinct is always to conceal herself until the skies clear.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Vinnie	“I don’t see that,” [MASK] says a little snappishly. “Why shouldn’t your father have been interested in his genealogy? A great many people are.” “Sure, I know. But they’ve mostly got someone worthwhile in their family tree.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Vinnie	“Not a very nice hotel, I should imagine,” says [MASK]. “Uh, no. It’s not specially nice. It’s called the Majestic, but it’s kinda yucky really. How did you know?” “Because they always are.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Vinnie	“Oh, come on, [MASK],” she interrupts. “I don’t need to hear all that drivel again. I know there’s more to it; he’s going back to that stupid wife of his, isn’t he?’ ”
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Rosemary	If he doesn’t go on to [MASK]’s, at least he will have done something professionally useful. Five minutes later he has passed from the warm sunny afternoon into the cool, cavernous galleries and halls of the V and A. They are almost deserted, maybe because of the weather outside.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Vinnie	If he only had a decent raincoat instead of that awful transparent plastic thing—she gives it a nasty look as it hangs in the hall—then he could wear that while his clothes dried, or even go home in it. “Hey, [MASK]!
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Rosemary	A wave of euphoria lifts him. He has never, he thinks, been happier than he is at this moment. “Really, darling.” [MASK] disengages herself from a second long kiss. “It was one of the nicest moments of my life.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Vinnie	“So how do you see the future of the affair, then?” “I don’t know.” [MASK] puts down her fork, considering. “But whatever happens, it can’t last very long.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Edwin	And she could do all this . . . Nothing prevents her from doing it except a sense of the hopeless ridiculousness of such an excursion. “Not me.” [MASK] helps himself to the last of the macaroons, of which he has already had more than his fair share.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Vinnie	As she often says to herself—though never aloud, for she knows how unpleasant it would sound—why shouldn’t she look out for herself? Nobody else will. But such internal arguments, frequent as they are with [MASK], occupy little of her mind now.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Chuck	“She can imitate just about anyone. You should hear her do your cowboy friend, [MASK] what’s-his-name. How is what’s-his-name, by the way?” he adds, changing the subject with his customary deftness.
<name>She</name>	She	Vinnie	“It’s not safe any more, is it, giving parties? One never knows what fateful events are going to be precipitated.” “The hostess as demiurge.” He giggles, and [MASK], reassured, joins in.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Roo	What he probably ought to do is find someone who would not replace [MASK] or make him forget her —that’s impossible—but distract him and warm him. Preceded by a rush of chilly air, a hollow roar, the inbound Underground train arrives.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Vinnie	The pieces on clothes and beauty, on the other hand, she passes over rapidly. She has now no use for, and has never derived any benefit from, their advice. For nearly forty years [MASK] has suffered from the peculiar disadvantages of the woman born without physical charms.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Rosemary	It has occurred to him that in a way their love affair has reenacted Anglo-American history. [MASK] may have loved him, but she has the colonial mentality; she would do anything for him but grant him independence. When he demanded that, it was war.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Nico	They are empty and lined with glazed paper in an overcomplicated and disagreeable red paisley design. “I don’t know what you call it,” says [MASK]. He has given up all pretense of helping and is lounging on the window seat.
<name>Les</name>	Les	Joe	“Yeh,” [MASK] agrees. “I mean, she was obviously a decent person. But she was always in overdrive.” “Those photographs of hers. They were so kind of frantic and weird. And she seemed awful immature compared to you.”
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Rosemary	When she wrote in May she must have hoped that he’d ask her to join him here at once; instead he let her letter lie on his desk unanswered for weeks. He had encouraged [MASK] to love him unconditionally, while intending to love her only as long as it was convenient for him . . .
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Fred	They have an arrangement, he says.” “You mean like an open marriage.” [MASK] begins to pull out the drawers below the wardrobe. They are empty and lined with glazed paper in an overcomplicated and disagreeable red paisley design.
<name>Borges</name>	Borges	Fred	And the less often he goes to the Bowel Movement the worse it gets, since books placed on temporary reserve by [MASK] or any other reader fail to rise again on the third day and are, with infinite slowness, returned to their dark tombs.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Rosemary	Below in the kitchen and in the bedroom upstairs it is worse: the closets are jammed with rubbish, and the bathrooms not always clean. How [MASK] can emerge from all that disorder looking so fresh and beautiful is a mystery—and how she can stand to live in it another one.
<name>Grady</name>	Grady	Mike	All of them related some way, I guess, if you go back far enough. One of [MASK]’s students, he was saying maybe that’s why I feel so good down here. Said it could be a genetic memory, didja ever hear of that?”
<name>Abner</name>	Abner	Mumpson	Wal, there probably wasn’t much old [MASK] knew how to do besides farming. So he took this hermit job, instead of going on public assistance. The way I figure it, I oughta be proud of him, ’stead of ashamed, y’know?”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Vinnie	“I’ll wear it. And the lady will pay,” he added. Then he stood there calmly, grinning, while [MASK] helplessly allowed nearly a hundred pounds to be charged to her Barclaycard, wondering meanwhile what on earth the man must think.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Vinnie	And if she doesn’t do something sensible instantly, [MASK] realizes with dismay, she is going to start howling too. She can feel the rising sob in her throat, the sting and ache of tears behind her eyes. Something. What?
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Vinnie	“All right then, don’t show a little initiative,” [MASK] says, losing her temper. “Lie down in the street and let a bus run over you if you want to. Only stop being so damn sorry for yourself.”
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Chuck	She isn’t a good woman; but perhaps she has done one good thing. As for [MASK] himself, he seemed to be in high (too high?) spirits. Work on the dig was going great, he told her, and so was his genealogical research.
<name>Lenina</name>	Lenina	Vinnie	It would be idle to pretend that [MASK] likes this rhyme. But since she has never heard it before she records the lines and then, as is her custom, reads them back for confirmation. “Yeh. You got it.” “Thank you.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Vinnie	“Are you all right?” she asks. “No, I guess not.” Instinctively, [MASK] steps back. “Don’t worry. I’m not drunk or anything. I’d like to sit down, okay?” “Yes, of course.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Rosemary	[MASK] slides into stage Cockney—“and ’er dawg’s worms and ’er cat’s fleas and ’er budgie’s molt, ooh, the pore dear, ’e’s losin’ ’is feathers somethin’ awful and won’t touch ’is bloody birdseed.”
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Rosemary	[MASK] never follows current fashion, but has developed a style of her own. Everything she wears shimmers and billows and dangles; she seems not so much dressed as loosely draped in flimsy, flowery, lacy stuffs: veils and scarves and floating gauzy blouses and trailing skirts and fringed silk shawls.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Roo	Around them, [MASK]’s photographs were hung in groups of two. What she had done was to pair views of natural and manmade objects in such a way as to emphasize their similarity. A few of the combinations he had already seen.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Chuck	The last time [MASK] was here, she suddenly recalls, he hardly smoked at all. He was trying to give it up, he had told her. And he hadn’t drunk anything to speak of either: only one glass of soda with a little white wine.
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	Vinnie	When several members of a women’s group she belonged to in the early seventies confessed that they had passionate fantasies about their carpenter, their gardener, or the mechanic at the service station, [MASK] was astonished and a little repelled.
<name>Stoner</name>	Stoner	Fred	Later he became the kind of prep-school boy who is elected class president and the kind of undergraduate and graduate student who is described in letters of recommendation as “incidentally, also a most attractive young man.” The real disadvantages of [MASK]’s appearance did not surface until he began to teach.
<name>Millie</name>	Millie	Vinnie	“I betcha you’ll get more brass ’n that when you sell my stuff.” “I don’t sell these rhymes.” [MASK] tries to say this pleasantly, to keep both distaste and rebuke out of her voice. “Yeh?
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Rosemary	Right now he feels sore and disoriented because [MASK] has thrown him over, but he will recover. Many other women will love him; his career will steadily advance; and unless he is struck by a car or a deadly disease or some other form of lightning his whole life will be irritatingly fortunate.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Heavens	Instead of replying, she yawns, covering the pink flower of her mouth with one fluttering hand. “[MASK], I’m exhausted! Classical drama does that to me sometimes. Is it dreadfully late?” “No; half past eleven.”
<name>He</name>	He	Chuck	“Please, let’s take it easy,” she says. “And let’s get out of the kitchen, before something else spills.” “Okay.” [MASK] stands aside, then follows her into the sitting room.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Vinnie	“Yes, of course that’s possible,” [MASK] says, wishing she had thought of this comforting argument herself weeks ago. “There’s a hell of a lot of learning that isn’t in books.” “You may be right.”
<name>She</name>	She	Vinnie	He laughs in the too-loud manner of someone joining in a joke of which he is the butt. “Really.” [MASK] recalls articles she has read about the growing trend toward forced obsolescence among middle-aged executives, and congratulates herself on her university’s tenure system.
<name>he</name>	he	Chuck	But all the euphemisms are stupid. Passed on, passed away, kicked the bucket, gone over to the Other Side—as if [MASK] had committed a foul or switched teams in some awful children’s game. What he has done is died; he’s dead.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Vinnie	“I tried to phone you, to get some help, but I must have taken down the number wrong. I got a laundry instead.” “Mm.” [MASK] naturally doesn’t explain that she had deliberately altered one digit of her number.
<name>She</name>	She	Rosemary	I like it the way it is.’ Oh, they were shocked. My Aunt Etty said”—another voice, lower and wearier —“ ‘No man’ll stay in a house that looks the way your room does now.’ Little she knew.” [MASK] giggles provocatively.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Vinnie	The real stuff is locked up somewhere else. Hell, anybody could see that: the crowns and all look like what guys in the Shriners or Masons would wear to some big do.” [MASK] laughs. “1 remember thinking the same thing, years ago.
<name>Griffith</name>	Griffith	Andy	The ones who stayed behind, by a process of natural selection, became progressively more timid, inert, slavish, and sickly. Hell, just look around you, [MASK] said. The British are poor pale sad bastards now, the dregs of a once noble stock.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Edwin	And after all, what right has she to scream at [MASK] for thinking as she had thought for months? “Well,” he says, splashing the last of the wine into their balloon glasses. “We mustn’t judge everyone by our own silly standards.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Rosemary	[MASK] protests, with a soft giggle. “And if she goes out,” he continues, “if she doesn’t watch them every minute, the people from Help Yourself help themselves to her whisky and her pate and her opera records and sometimes even her clothes.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Vinnie	Of course, elderly couples can now and then be seen hugging or kissing in a friendly manner. The public regards this indulgently, as visitors to the Zoo do the two damp-stained polar bears across the way from [MASK], who are now nuzzling each other with a playful, clumsy affection.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Fred	If she doesn’t want to play by those rules, okay; so long, no hard feelings.” [MASK] doesn’t agree. In his experience, no matter what is said in the preliminary negotiations, there are always strings.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Rosemary	It wasn’t a very large role, admittedly; but a fair amount of money was in- volved—and, as everyone says, [MASK] has to think of her reputation; she isn’t getting any younger. None of this gossip seems to affect the lovers.
