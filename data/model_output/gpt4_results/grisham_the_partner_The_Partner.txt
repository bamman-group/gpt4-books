<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Cohen	The company was quite anxious to setde and leave town. “All litigation is dismissed,” [MASK] said. “And we pay a half a million?” “That’s it.” “We’ll do it.”
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Patrick	Eight seconds of level five will kill you, and I’m perfectly willing to do that as a last resort. Are you listening, [MASK]?” His flesh still burned from his chest to his ankles. His heart pumped furiously and he exhaled quickly.
<name>Palmer</name>	Palmer	Jack	The Director is at home, on the phone, consulting with the Attorney General, who by the way is not taking this very well, and they call me every twenty minutes and peel off some more skin. This is serious stuff, okay, [MASK]?
<name>Janet</name>	Janet	Trudy	“I’d been saving it for a while. I was making good money, though [MASK] was doing her best to spend it faster than I could make it. I told the bookkeeper in the firm that I needed to reroute some money to keep it away from my wife.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Stephano	“Yes.” “And that was April of ’94?” “Correct.” “Continue, then.” [MASK] settled into his chair and got himself comfortable. “The trail ran cold for a while. For a long time, actually.
<name>Rudy</name>	Rudy	Patrick	He would read about it tomorrow. A handful of the lawyers were old buddies who came to cheer [MASK] on. Escape was a common, usually unspoken, dream of many small-town lawyers trapped in an overcrowded, boring profession where expectations were too high.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Patrick	“Then why didn’t [MASK] tell them where the money is?” “Because he didn’t know.” “He gave it all to you.” “Something like that. I have control of it. Now I’m being chased, and my poor father is caught in the middle.”
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Hayani	What else did he have to do? He changed into a pair of loose-fitting khakis and a large white cotton shirt. He wore new Bass loafers, no socks because of the rope-burned ankle. He hugged [MASK] and thanked him for his friendship.
<name>Reilly</name>	Reilly	Patrick	He seemed to know everything about the disappearance of [MASK] and the money. He had a file of all the press clippings. Everything was indexed and at his fingertips. He handed us a four-page, double-spaced narrative of what his client knew.”
<name>Ray</name>	Ray	Lance	She recognized him. “Can I come in?” “No.” “[MASK] is in police custody. I think we should talk.” “What!” “The Biloxi police have him.” She unlocked the chain and opened the door.
<name>Stevenson</name>	Stevenson	Mast	“Yes, he implemented the scheme.” “And how do you know this?” “Where are the tapes?” [MASK] handed him a sheet of paper on which the tapes of over sixty conversations had been cataloged.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Lance	“She’s fine. How’s your woman?” “I don’t have one. Look, [MASK], we’ve picked up some pretty serious tips that you’re in the market for a trigger.” “Lies, lies, total lies.”
<name>Restlessness</name>	Restlessness	Problems	[MASK] can be left behind. It’s inbred in us. We’re the products of immigrants who left miserable conditions and came here in search of a better life. And they kept moving west, packing up and leaving, always looking for the pot of gold.
<name>John</name>	John	Shenault	“We take the deal. Now, if you want someone else to represent you, fine. But as long as I’m your lawyer, we’re taking the deal, right now.” [MASK] went speechless.
<name>Wormtail</name>	Wormtail	Clovis	Now, telling him about [MASK] is one thing, but testifying in court is another. He can’t make me testify in court if he tries me for mutilation. He’ll be pressured to try me for something, because, as you say, he can’t allow me to walk away.
<name>He</name>	He	Patrick	They ate waffles and bacon and drank coffee on the patio as the old streets came to life. Before the neighbors could begin stopping by to applaud the good news, they left for a long drive. [MASK] wanted to at least see his city again, if only briefly.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Sandy	“I knew they would grab me, and I knew they would try to make me talk. But I had no idea this would happen.” He pointed to the bum above his left ankle. “I thought it might get ugly, but they damned near killed me, [MASK].
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Patrick	The voices were not coming from the hall but from within the room. Could it be the drugs? It could be a number of things, [MASK]. The medicine, the fatigue, the trauma of what you’ve been through, the shock both physically and psychologically.
<name>She</name>	She	Leah	He showered and dressed, and found his way down to the kitchen, where [MASK] sat in the breakfast nook with fresh coffee and a surprisingly alert face. She fixed him wheat toast with jam as he glanced at the newspapers.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Huskey	Kids are getting closer to college, and I need to make more money.” [MASK] paused for a second, then asked, “Just curious, how did you know I was leaving the bench? It’s not something I’ve broadcast.”
<name>He</name>	He	Rapley	And the remotest chance of collecting that money brought in the friends and the curious for a drink or two and a story or a rumor and an update and the inevitable, “Damn, I hope they find the money.” [MASK] disappeared into the crowd with his second drink.
<name>Jennifer</name>	Jennifer	Vitrano	At the other end, a variety of bottled waters and soft drinks was being ignored. “It’s been like this all afternoon,” [MASK] said as they looked at the crowd and listened to the happy talk. “Soon as word got out, this place started hopping.”
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Bogan	If so, why hadn’t he warned his more indifferent partners? He’d simply been cautious, and lucky. Important conversations were held in [MASK]’s office. It took only seconds to engage the deadbolt. He kept the only key.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Patrick	And she would go. She would linger in the background, hiding and doing what he wanted, and praying for the safety of both of them. She would roam her room at night, just like [MASK], asking herself what had become of their future.
<name>Blackwood</name>	Blackwood	Lanigan	This person knew an awful lot about [MASK]—his movements, his habits, his aliases. It was all a setup— there was a brain at work. We knew what was coming, and, frankly, we were quite anxious. Finally, they popped the big one.
<name>Callahan</name>	Callahan	Karl	Why should I care?” “Remember the Hoover trial? My first in your courtroom, and my finest hour as a trial lawyer.” “Of course.” [MASK] crossed his feet on his desk, his hands locked behind his head.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Sandy	“And take these with you.” He handed over the package. [MASK] sat in the only chair, flipping through the photos of his naked friend, taking his time. “When were these taken?” he asked. “Yesterday.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Sandy	“Let me guess. I’m supposed to drop everything, and race over right now.” “It’s important, [MASK].” “So are my other clients,” he said angrily. “Why can’t you give me a little notice here?”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Trussel	“Yeah, I know.” “Anyway, I’ve talked to [MASK], and he’s ready to take the case. I’ve also told him about your heinous injuries, and how important it is for you to stay here for as long as possible.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Stephano	“The money?” “We haven’t started yet. He’s still drugged.” “When?” “Tonight.” “I’m by the phone.” [MASK] hung up, though he could’ve talked for hours.
<name>She</name>	She	Lance	He took a fresh legal pad and uncapped his pen. “Let’s make a list,” he said. She paid a hundred and thirty thousand dollars for the Rolls, and still owned it. [MASK] drove a Porsche, which she’d bought for eighty-five thousand.
<name>Levine</name>	Levine	Warren	THE NEXT INTERROGATOR was a squirrely little man named [MASK], who chain-smoked and viewed the world through thick, dark glasses. His eyes were invisible. His left hand worked the cigarette, his right one handled the pen, and nothing else moved, except his lips.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Lance	“Look at what he’s done to me. I got two and a half million when he died, now the insurance company is ready to bankrupt me.” “She deserves a helluva lot of money,” [MASK] piped in on cue.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Patrick	[MASK] opened and closed his eyes. Then he opened them for good as the drugs found their mark. They hovered over him, busy hands everywhere. His underwear was cut off, without much finesse, and he lay bare and exposed.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Underhill	“Why wouldn’t he return the car?” [MASK] asked, musing. “Simple. When he rented it, his death had just happened, and had not been reported. But the next day, his face was on the front page of both the Biloxi and Mobile papers.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Terry	“I don’t care about the other four hundred, and they certainly don’t care about me. This is the criminal process, [MASK]. It’s every man for himself.” “But not everybody is on the front page.” “Oh, I see.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Pepper	Two o’clock in the morning, and [MASK] caught me. I told him my wife and I had just finished a big fight, I was in a foul mood, and would he please leave. I don’t think he saw me wrestling the corpse up the steps of the cabin.
<name>John</name>	John	Jack	Their last hope was gone. The search for the money was finally over. “Where is she?” he asked, not expecting any meaningful answer. “We have her, [MASK]. She’s with us.” “Congratulations.”
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Aricia	“[MASK],” he repeated, then looked away. He knew the basics, at least what he’d read in the papers. “It will take some time, so I’d pack for overnight.” “Am I expected to stay at the beach house?”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Patrick	Just when he thought he had been clued in to [MASK]’s past, this latest twist came crashing in. “You \yere a damned fool if you let them catch you.” “Oh really. Did I not just walk out of the courtroom a free man?
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Bogan	Surely they could find it. The firm’s fee was a third. Maybe, just maybe. [MASK] worked on his moist eyes and thought of his ex-wife, a congenial woman who’d turned vicious when the sky fell.
<name>Archer</name>	Archer	Terry	“Look, [MASK],” he said sincerely. “You can’t prosecute me for murder. That’s gone. You can’t prosecute me for mutilating a corpse, because you don’t know who got mutilated. You have nothing.
<name>the deal</name>	the deal	Clovis	“He can’t let you walk away.” “No, he can’t. But here’s the catch. He won’t know about [MASK] unless I tell him, but I have to tell him before he’ll drop the murder charges.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Sandy	His wife brought an overnight bag to the office. A paralegal drove them to the airport, and at some point along the way [MASK] noticed she had no luggage, nothing but a small brown leather satchel, well used and quite handsome. “Where are you staying?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Stephano	“Any nibbles?” “A few, here and there. But we never paid any money, at least not to language tutors.” “To others?” [MASK] nodded as he glanced at a sheet of paper.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Patrick	Most folks, it seemed through the informal polling of coffee shop talk and courthouse gossip, felt he was guilty and should spend time in prison. Very few favored the death penalty. Leave that for rapists and cop killers. Most pressing, though, at the moment, was keeping [MASK] alive.
<name>Mickey</name>	Mickey	Sandy	“That’ll do for starters. Am I doing the civil as well as the criminal?” “Everything.” “Just me?” “Yes. He wants no other lawyer.” “I’m touched,” [MASK] said, and he meant it.
<name>Rudy</name>	Rudy	Parrish	The lawyers said nothing. “Good. I have prepared a schedule for discovery, motions, pretrial, and trial. It’s available in the clerk’s office. Anything else?” [MASK] stood and said, “Just one small matter, Your Honor.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Patrick	[MASK] said he was a Canadian businessman who needed a lawyer with experience in trade matters. But he really needed a friend. I was a friend for two days, then we fell in love. He told me everything about his past, everything.
<name>He</name>	He	Patrick	He hadn’t heard her wonderful voice for some time, and he was not pleased to hear it now. “Can we talk?” “Yes. What’s the matter?” [MASK] checked the phone in his room for bugs every three or four hours.
<name>she</name>	she	Trudy	I loved the child as best I could, but I was miserable. I gathered evidence and promised myself I would confront [MASK], but it was easy to put off. Oddly enough, I sort of got used to the idea that she had a lover.
<name>Bingo</name>	Bingo	Catfish	He said it was still too painful to talk about. I helped him into the house and he fell onto the sofa, snoring. It was almost midnight. This went on for about a month. Rocking on the front porch. [MASK] on Tuesdays.
<name>Daddy</name>	Daddy	Patrick	“But I don’t want him to be—” “I’m sorry, honey. I was gonna tell you when you were much older, but [MASK] is about to come back now, and it’s important for you to know.”
<name>Hardy</name>	Hardy	Hamilton	“Why?” “Don’t know. He told us to come get you. He wants you to ride with us to his office.” “So [MASK] is working late, is he?” “Yes sir. Can you come with us?”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Bogan	But [MASK] didn’t answer. He sat with his fingers locked over his stomach and watched the dust settle on his desk. Oh, what could’ve been. He would get five million, the Senator the same. No bankruptcy, no divorce.
<name>Scarpetta</name>	Scarpetta	Patrick	The bad guys would be crazy to tap his phones and stalk him. One bungled move, and serious damage could be done to the case against [MASK]. But he had contacted a local security firm and made an appointment to have his offices swept for bugs.
<name>He</name>	He	Clovis	We drove and drank, and he said he’d like to show me where he grew up. It wasn’t far away, he said. One county road led to the next, and after twenty minutes I had no idea where I was. [MASK] couldn’t see very well.
<name>He</name>	He	Lanigan	“What was in the file?” “Just the basics. Clear frontal photos of our man before and after the surgery. It was really odd because [MASK] had insisted on no photos. He wanted no trail whatsoever, just hard cash for the alterations.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Patrick	“Good morning, [MASK],” she chirped happily. “It’s time for breakfast.” She sat the tray on a table. “How was your night?” “Wonderful. Yours?” “Wonderful. Anything I can get for you?”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Patrick	[MASK] was relaxed, animated, into his story, grinning now. “You woke up with the sun. A new man in a new world. All your worries and problems left behind.” “Most of them. It was terribly exciting, and also frightening.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Patrick	“I promise. It was such a masterful job of deceit, [MASK]. How’d you do it?” “I may have to skip a few of the details.” “I’m sure you will.” “Let’s take a walk.
<name>Rudy</name>	Rudy	Patrick	He had packets for them, thin folders which he distributed and asked them to flip through. Each contained a copy of the lawsuit filed by [MASK] against the FBI for his injuries, and each had a set of color pictures of the bums.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Patrick	Fourteen FOR HIS RETURN HOME, [MASK] chose a pair of aqua surgeon’s scrubs, very baggy and loose-fitting because he wanted nothing to aggravate his burns. The flight would be nonstop, but still more than two hours, and he needed to be as comfortable as possible.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Patrick	But I’ll need to stay here for a while.” “I have no problem with that, [MASK]. No one is screaming for you to be moved to the jail.” “Not yet. But I bet the press will start soon.”
<name>Thornhill</name>	Thornhill	Patrick	We listened to them. They developed the story that [MASK] should be an American fugitive wanted for the kidnap and murder of the daughter of a wealthy family, a family now offering a reward for information about his whereabouts.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Cutter	“Get us some coffee, lots of it,” he barked at the secretary. The room cleared and [MASK] sat rigidly before the grand desk. Though mightily fatigued, he tried hard to be alert. He’d never been near the Deputy Director’s office before.
<name>Briggs</name>	Briggs	Jaynes	It was called a tracing cone, a tiny but powerful transmitter used to monitor movements of people, packages, even automobiles. He’d frisked himself while chatting with [MASK], and had been tempted to rip out the cone and toss it on his desk.
<name>Mitch</name>	Mitch	Patrick	Escape was a common, usually unspoken, dream of many small-town lawyers trapped in an overcrowded, boring profession where expectations were too high. At least [MASK] had the guts to chase the dream. There was an explanation for the dead body, they were sure of that.
<name>He</name>	He	Clovis	He liked it, and he insisted that I be designated as the person to pull the plug, in consultation with his doctors, of course. [MASK] was tired of the nursing home, tired of the loneliness, tired of life.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Patrick	They also spent a lot of time in their room, like newlyweds. Once, after too much wine, [MASK] referred to it as their honeymoon. □ □ □ □ SHE FOUND a smaller room at the same hotel, and after a nap had tea on the patio in her bathrobe.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Sandy	“A friend, maybe.” “Your job will be easier if you think of me as a criminal.” [MASK] lifted the settlement agreements from the table and started for the door. “I’m tired and I’m going to rest.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Sandy	[MASK] asked. “Whatever. And we’ll pull the records of every old codger who died in early February of 1992. We’ll go to the families, see if they’ve talked to you. We might even get a court order, dig up a few graves.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Karl	“Right. February ninth. I spent the weekend at my cabin, and as I was driving home I had a wreck, got killed, and went to heaven.” [MASK] watched him closely and never smiled. “Try it again,” he said.
<name>Interrogation</name>	Interrogation	Kidnapping	He was well, and so was she. Both were liberated, though she didn’t tell him where she’d spent the last three days. [MASK] wasn’t such a harsh ordeal after all, he joked. He had been treated superbly; not a single bruise.
<name>He</name>	He	Sandy	“Who are these people?” “There’s a file over there,” she said, nodding at a small table. “Please sit.” She was pointing at the end of the bed. [MASK] sat with his coffee and waited.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Patrick	His dream had been to somehow find the money, then disappear with it, just like [MASK]. But his dream was over now. He had a million bucks left. He had friends in other countries, and contacts around the world.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Karl	[MASK] absorbed this reaction, because he would think about it many times over the next few days. A jolt, then a glance, and then unable to answer truthfully, a diversion to the wall. The line from the old movie said, “When you commit a murder you make twenty-five mistakes.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Sandy	An hour later, [MASK] arrived for what he thought would be a long day of digging through the past four years and finding answers to his coundess questions. The television went off, the shades opened, the room brightened up as the day began.
<name>Grimes</name>	Grimes	Vitrano	A small square table with a chair on each side. No windows. The ceiling was slanted because a stairway ran above it. [MASK] was fetched because he was second in command, and a meeting of sorts commenced. It didn’t last long.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Sandy	“Good work, [MASK]. A masterful job.” “We had a good day. Federal charges are all dismissed, the litigation is settled. Attorneys’ fees are taken care of. The kid’s future is secure.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Patrick	One had been convicted. The other was well on his way. [MASK] was in college when his father left, then died. His mother adjusted badly to the life of a divorced middle-aged woman with no professional skills and no history of employment.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Patrick	“So much for a quiet little appearance,” [MASK] said. “Secrets are hard to keep around here. Nice clothes.” “Thanks.” “This reporter I know from the Jackson paper asked me to ask you—” “Absolutely not.
<name>Goldberg</name>	Goldberg	Patrick	There were certainly enough other bugs for him to absorb and assimilate. In fact, they had decided there was a very good chance the Closet meeting had been missed by [MASK]. “Surely he wouldn’t keep the tapes for four years, would he?”
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Sandy	“For now. I’ll stop by the clerk’s office in town to see if any more suits have been filed.” “Send ’em over. [MASK] here works fast.” They shook hands, this time without the intrusion of cuffs, and the Sheriff left.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Trudy	I started gaining the weight, eating like a maniac. I changed my will. I convinced [MASK] that we should make our funeral and burial arrangements, and I did it without arousing suspicions.” “Cremation was a nice touch.” “Thanks.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sandy	Yes, I’m fine. I’ve never felt better. And you?” He listened for a long time, his eyes closed, his head leaning back. “What’s today?” he asked. “Friday, November sixth,” [MASK] said.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Birck	[MASK] listened without trying to, though he couldn’t understand a word. When she hung up and finished wiping her eyes, he said, “There are some phone numbers in the letter, in case you get stopped again by customs.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Paulo	With guards posted around the clock, he had learned to relax somewhat. But the outside lines still worried him. “It’s my father,” she said, then blurted out the story of [MASK]’s disappearance. “I have to go home.”
<name>John</name>	John	Vitrano	“Oh my God!” he exclaimed, then buried his face in his palms. “Oh my God.” [MASK]’s head fell back, his mouth too fell open. He gazed in utter disbelief at the ceiling. “Where?” he managed to ask.
<name>Maxwell</name>	Maxwell	Sandy	“Smart man. After abandoning the child for four years, he’d be hard-pressed to see her.” “There is another reason,” [MASK] said, as he opened the file and picked out the DNA test.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Danilo	Perhaps [MASK] was still alive somewhere. He had promised her they wouldn’t kill him. They might make him beg for death, but they couldn’t afford to kill him. If the American authorities found him first, it would be a matter of extradition.
<name>Indigo</name>	Indigo	Lanigan	Where is it? What did he do with it? Can it be recovered and given to its owners? The second is just exactly who is buried out there. I gotta hunch that only [MASK] can tell us, and he won’t unless he’s forced to.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Patrick	“Nervous as a whore in church.” “Let’s get it done before they get cold feet,” [MASK] said as he signed his name. A bailiff walked to the bar and announced that court was about to convene, so please have a seat.
<name>John</name>	John	Sandy	She wasn’t ashamed to cry over the pictures, and when she was finished with them she placed them in a neat stack and put them back in the folder. “I’m sorry,” [MASK] said. He could think of nothing else to offer.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Patrick	“I don’t remember it that way, [MASK]. No, an innocent person had been murdered so you could steal the money. Plus, you left behind a wife and daughter.” “The wife got a bundle. The child isn’t mine.”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Parrish	Bottom line is this: no jail.” [MASK] tapped his fingers and analyzed it. “And you’ll reveal the name of the victim?” “I will, but only after we have a deal.”
<name>Since</name>	Since	ISo	They had a picture of the shoe found at the site. She suffered through the months and years afterward. [MASK], she had not remarried. No, she had not heard from her husband since he had returned. Wasn’t sure if she wanted to.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Patrick	He then emerged on the other side, and attempted to slip past the second man, a person he obviously knew and didn’t want to speak to. But he didn’t make it. The second man glanced up, and said, “[MASK], it’s been a long time.”
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Sandy	She gets none of my assets.” “When do we talk about your assets?” “Soon. I promise. But there is something more pressing.” [MASK] removed his obligatory legal pad and poised himself to take notes. “I’m listening,” he said.
<name>Camille</name>	Camille	Karl	They ate on a wooden bench, not far from a small fountain and a sad little maple. The various wings of the hospital surrounded them. [MASK] had brought po’boys for the deputies as well, and they sat nearby, just out of earshot.
