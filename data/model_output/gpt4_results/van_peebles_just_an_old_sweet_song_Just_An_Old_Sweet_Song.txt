<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Grandma	“You better get to work, before you spoil that perfect on-time record of yours.” “And there’s a chicken out there to take with you.” [MASK] called over the noise of the screen door banging shut.
<name>Brick</name>	Brick	Junior	Besides, don’t you think”—she slipped into a deep Southern drawl to make a joke of what she said—“your old ma and pa deserve a little two weeks’ rest?” Not a bit amused, [MASK] stood up and restlessly began pacing the porch, his stacked heels clicking.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Junior	“Open up, it’s the police!” [MASK] rushed to the door. Before he knew what was happening, a policeman had him spread-eagle against the wall with a gun at his head while another tore to the rear of the apartment to the fire escape.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Priscilla	His strut was the one he reserved for certain occasions, mostly times like tonight when he was stepping out with the boys. [MASK] never allowed him to perform it when he went places with her because she had always said it looked too low-down.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Nate	[MASK] listened to her attentively, searching for a clue to his own feelings. One part of him was at war with another, but he couldn’t tell which side he was on. “What did you do?”
<name>Alonso</name>	Alonso	Junior	“Even if we stay here and you get the worm farm on its feet,” he said angrily, “what says that country bumpkin can keep it going?” “I don’t allow no disrespect, [MASK].”
<name>Sally</name>	Sally	Joe	The girls looked at one another and giggled. “Good evening,” they said, smiling back at him. “I got a fresh pot of coffee brewing,” [MASK] chirped. “And we got fresh buns,” the shorter girl spoke for the first time.
<name>John</name>	John	Nate	He was so glad to see his father that he gave him a big hug ... something he hadn’t done for years. [MASK] sighed gratefully and tried not to show his relief. It was an awkward moment between father and son.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Nate	“To hear you tell it, you’re never scared.” “Well, I don’t know about you kids, but it sure frightened the daylights outta me,” [MASK] confided. “That plane must’ve been a little low.”
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Nate	Now I can go,” he said, snapping his fingers and raising the thick skin on his forehead into an arch of ripples above his eyebrows, “just like that, while you go see about your boy—and in style too,” he mused, pointing at [MASK]’s car.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Junior	He kept it folded in half and neatly tucked in a corner of his wallet so the edges wouldn’t get frayed. In scrawled lead pencil it read: This is my son. [MASK]. Let him have a bottle for me.
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Grandma	He’s never been south in his life.” “You all ought to come down and see what you’re missing,” [MASK] sighed. She smiled at them and pushed back her chair. Standing up, she closed her eyes for a second as if she were thinking of something.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Priscilla	And they don’t cost an arm and a leg!” [MASK] realized too late that she had raised her voice to her mother, something she had never done before. She could hear the defensiveness creeping into her voice.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Junior	And then all was black. Even though he was out cold, he was glad to be spared the sight of the meat on the floor. [MASK] staggered home with a stomach full of beef broth. He could hear it sloshing around inside of him when he walked.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Junior	Yes, I suppose I’ll be glad to get back, too. Yes, I’m not as worried about [MASK] down here.” “See, that’s just what I said. He can’t get into trouble as long as he’s down here.”
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Highpockets	“To get me a thing to dig with like you.” “A hoe. But what about your folks? They know you over here?” “They said I could come back if I wanted to.” [MASK] disappeared into the bam.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Junior	“Take a shot, son. You must be soaked clear through. In fact, take a couple of belts. It’ll make you feel better.” [MASK] filled the cap of the flask. The motion of the car made him dribble liquor down his chin.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Nate	“She was smiling at what she hopes you got in your wallet,” [MASK] burst his bubble, “—not you.” The bright sunlight gleamed through the yellow and white gingham kitchen curtains down onto the linoleum floor. A cockroach scampered toward safety as fast as it could go.
<name>High-pockets</name>	High-pockets	Junior	To High-pockets, she said sweetly, “We’re going to be here two weeks, so you’re not going to miss anything!” And when [MASK] groaned at the mention of “two weeks,” she couldn’t pass up the chance to rub a little salt in his misery.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Priscilla	“No, son. We’ll all go together or stay together.” [MASK] struggled to control herself in front of the kids. Confusion and turmoil tore at her insides. She, too, had been looking forward to getting back to her home ... her job.
<name>Yolanda</name>	Yolanda	Alice	“Man, I hate a chick got telegraph-pole legs, same size all the way down. That [MASK] ain’t got no ankles. Elephant legs.” “You like her?” “Awww.” “Maybe one day one of us gonna get some.”
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Joe	There was a commotion in front of his building. The two hookers from his floor were being hustled out of the tenement and into a waiting paddy wagon. A gauntlet of onlookers stood around en- joying the show, then, last but not least, two cops exited with [MASK] in tow.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Stone	“I watched him for a while—can that man talk! —then I went out... found him in the shed talking about what good shape the place was in and talking about how the roof didn’t leak.” Everyone laughed thinking about [MASK]’s boldness.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Nate	Not just the big things like scraping layers of linoleum off the floors and plastering the ceiling, but also little things that made life more pleasant. She chuckled as she reflected she was probably the only person in the building whose windows opened and closed without sticking. [MASK] had put in new cords and metal counterweights.
<name>Mavis</name>	Mavis	Priscilla	She liked iron pots and pans, and now stared at her collection trying to decide what she would use tonight: cornbread stick baker, frying pans. She sighed thinking of that cramped-up little space [MASK] had to cook in.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Julie	The women hugged. “My goodness, girl, it’s been a long time. This must be [MASK]. She wasn’t big as a minute last time I saw her. Now look how grown up and pretty she is.”
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Joe	Empty. [MASK] put on a pot of coffee. He stretched and opened the apartment door as if it led to his own porch back home, instead of the outside hall. Two hookers from across the way were just getting in.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Priscilla	“I was right there in the kitchen,” [MASK] pulled out her chair, the last one to sit down at the dinner table, “and just out of the comer of my eye through the window I caught a glimpse of people walking in the yard, and I looked . . .
<name>Marvin</name>	Marvin	Joe	“First thing back from a trip, and you come here to hug a box of worms before going home.” “From the looks of things,” [MASK] gazed around, “we’re the only ones here.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Priscilla	[MASK] struggled to hold back her tears. A big-eyed doll sat in a rocking chair next to a window with white lace curtains. The room was dainty with an air of sugar and spice and everything nice about it. “It’s beautiful!”
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Highpockets	Why couldn’t he say he was sorry. As soon as the door closed, a familiar mischievous ten-year-old’s head popped up from beside the bed. Suppressing a giggle, [MASK] crawled back into bed and reclaimed his spot beside his grandmother.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Nate	“How you doing, honey?” she asked, shaking water out of a head of wet lettuce. “How are you doing, honey?” [MASK] responded, putting his arms around her and sneaking a slice of green pepper from her salad bowl.
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Grandma	[MASK] followed his finger and looked up the front of a row of weary apartment buildings. Fire escapes clung to the face of the tenements like petrified scaffolding. People leaned out of their windows trying to catch a breeze or just watching the street below.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Junior	[MASK] sank into an old wing-backed chair. The smell of something, he didn’t know what, wrinkled his nose. What was it, old lady, lace and lavender, or just the house closed up for a few days. He didn’t know.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Nate	“Oh, [MASK]!” she cried, leaning on him. “Hey, babe, come on now, your momma’s gonna be all right,” he cajoled. “She’s got plenty of years left.”
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Nate	The bright sunlight gleamed through the yellow and white gingham kitchen curtains down onto the linoleum floor. A cockroach scampered toward safety as fast as it could go. Wham—[MASK]’s size ten-and-a-half shoe was faster.
<name>Flanagan</name>	Flanagan	Nate	The kid leaped a fence into a nearby yard . . . somewhere a dog barked as he tore through a vacant lot making his escape. The foreign voice from the other end of the alley, a chubby policeman, and [MASK] arrived in a dead heat.
<name>Myra</name>	Myra	Grandma	He vfas dreaming about the farm and hoping there would be chickens so he could feed them. [MASK] leaned forward, careful not to disturb his head on her lap. Her searching eyes peered into the darkness beyond the speeding car.
<name>Teacake</name>	Teacake	Junior	She stood back enjoying them eat until it seemed to her that the heavyweights were going to get it all. She tried to shoo the big brutes away with words. [MASK] opened one eye and couldn’t believe that the woman yelling, “Go away you . . .
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Junior	“I heard noise and...” “It’s okay,” [MASK] interrupted, going back inside. “You can mind your own business now.” He tried to sound polite. “I’m here now.” “You ain’t by yourself, is you?”
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Nate	“The fact remains, it’s midnight and he’s not home.” “I suppose that’s my fault ’cause I was tough on him.” [MASK] was getting peeved. “Are you taking up for him being sassy about your mother?”
<name>Rufus</name>	Rufus	Joe	Anyway, tonight he had decided that he would walk the walk he had learned long ago as a gang leader, the walk of pride of the Detroit ghetto. [MASK] hooked his hands into the pockets of his red-and-green checked jacket.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Nate	When [MASK] heard the word “hustle” it triggered the anger and worry and fear in him. He grabbed his son by the shoulders and gave him a shake. “I hear you got too much hustle, mister!”
<name>Yelling</name>	Yelling	Junior	The tires skidded on the gravel and the auto shot forward into the rain covering [MASK] with a spray of fine mud. “Maniac!” Yelling was all he could do. Later a van eased off the road behind him. The driver blew his horn.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Nate	While [MASK] loaded his new, free supplies into the trunk of his car, his eyes reviewed the small-town street. The old men were still playing checkers. The weasellike one who had greeted him earlier was stealing a midmoming nap on an empty milk crate stacked against the notion store.
<name>He</name>	He	Nate	“Hi,” said a voice from behind them, a pretty voice, a female voice. “How y’all doin’?” [MASK] looked over his shoulder at two women coming out of the apartment across the hall. Both were dressed in short skirts and wore long wigs.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Junior	“Think maybe the wind’s gonna blow soon?” [MASK] teased, as much to shake off his own depressing memories as to brighten the driver’s spirits. “Is this a tornado?” he added seriously. “Don’t rightly know, son.
<name>Ponyboy</name>	Ponyboy	Junior	“Next time you get your suspects straight before you call the cops. We coulda shot this kid and started a riot or something.” Their heavy shoes stomped down the stairs. “Looks enough like a thief,” [MASK] heard one of them say.
<name>Susan</name>	Susan	Darlene	Just then [MASK] entered the kitchen. Seeing what her mother was doing, she took the napkins from her and said, “I’ll set the table.” “Good, now I can get the food dished out.”
<name>Alonzo</name>	Alonzo	Joe	“I ain’t scared,” [MASK] protested. “I always been lucky, ask anybody.” “Luck ain’t got nothing to do with it, with these guys.” “Jive turkeys!” the dice player shouted after them.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Highpockets	“I also sell homeowner’s insurance. Aim to please any needs. Be happy to serve you.” [MASK] ran to the car and took the card. The automobile made a U-turn and left again in a cloud of dust.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Trunk	“But you know, last night I walked around these old fields and down by the creek out in the woods and I says to myself, I says, [MASK], you too old to go off chasing dreams, plus you just too plain scared. . . .”
<name>Stevenson</name>	Stevenson	Nate	Yes, sir, I know that puts you right back where you started from, but don’t forget this is an evening visit. . . . Yes, sir . . . I’m on my way right now.” [MASK] hung up.
<name>John</name>	John	Nate	Silently, the neighbor went on down the steps to his car in the yard. Through the screen door they saw that the house was filled with people, all of them as sad as the sober gentleman they had passed on the steps. Some of them were weeping. Icy fingers gripped [MASK]’s heart.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Joe	“Okay, the main job right now is building those first bins,” [MASK] authoritatively chattered on a mile a minute. “Figure once we get that done, then we get the breeding soil and manure mixed up and put in.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Darlene	He had started the day clean and pressed and he intended to stay that way—even if there wasn’t anyone around to appreciate his snappy clothes. Grudgingly he moved out of the way for [MASK], who emerged from the house bearing an armload of gardening tools, oblivious to his discontent.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Junior	Guess my mind was roaming,” [MASK] apologized, chuckling inside that he had taken so easily to the expression from the man with Southern blood in his veins. “Two weeks ago I’d have said no, now I’m not so sure . .
<name>McTeague</name>	McTeague	Simmons	“Now see here, [MASK], I have a firm, generous offer for this place. I took the liberty of bringing prospective buyers here yesterday.” “So I heard . . . hold up that end for me.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Priscilla	[MASK] looked into his warm brown eyes and felt herself melting inside the same way she had before they were married. It seemed like she never had enough time alone with him anymore. Between , their jobs, the children, and worrying about bills, there wasn’t very much time left for them.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Nate	She could hear the defensiveness creeping into her voice. But —damn it—she was proud of what she and [MASK] had accomplished. “We were lucky to get this apartment. We’re saving up and one day we’re going to have our own house.”
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Junior	“You ain’t by yourself, is you?” There was too much disbelief in the old man’s voice for that to be a real question. [MASK] felt happy to be able to say yes. “I ran away to home,” he said.
<name>She</name>	She	Priscilla	“Hey, babe, come on now, your momma’s gonna be all right,” he cajoled. “She’s got plenty of years left.” [MASK] tried to stop her tears, but it seemed that her heart would break.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Nate	he’s not going to be happy.” “Your boss, either . . . tion for once just like anybody else. Anyway,” [MASK] joked, trying to clear the air, “it’s probably a lot safer down there than it used to be.
<name>Rosie</name>	Rosie	Priscilla	“You’re gonna flood the place.” “I’m happy, that’s why,” [MASK] replied. Her face was aglow. “Besides, it’s okay .. . I’m married to the best plumber in the world.”
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Pm	“You haven’t stopped since you got up. Can’t you unwind for once?” “There’s a lot needs doing. Your ma’s handyman is not exactly what you’d call a self-starter. I guess [MASK] a little nervous too, about being down South.”
<name>Artie</name>	Artie	Momma	Now he’s almost in his teens.” “[MASK], you were always welcome to come up here.” “Yeah, and I thought I’d better just do that, too —while I still could. I’m not getting any younger.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Junior	[MASK] stood outside the ancient door until all the customers who might recognize him were gone. He didn’t want anybody paying too much attention to him. Still, he would have a problem keeping the owner busy so he wouldn’t look too closely at the note.
<name>children's</name>	children's	Claypool	Here I come!” She stumbled out of the back door and hobbled across the grayish-red clay-packed yard, worn bare and brick-hard by generations of skipping, walking, running, playing [MASK] feet. “You get out, now!”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Helen	“Wait till I tell [MASK] ... oh, man, she’ll flip.” A funky live combo played in one corner. People were laughing and dancing. All the lights were red except a small white one just over the cash register.
<name>Link</name>	Link	Junior	“You pawned a TV, didn’t you? Lots of folks saw you.” “I didn’t tell ’em I stole it. . . when I pawned it, they sorta assumed I did,” [MASK] said shamefacedly. “I just didn’t tell ’em
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Junior	Finally her wrinkled countenance settled into an “Oh-my-God!” look. She rushed out holding a gravy-covered wooden spoon. [MASK] thought he would faint dead away from the sight—gravy. And where there was gravy, there was meat.
<name>John</name>	John	Nate	Once plowed fields overgrown with wild grasses had turned into rolling meadows, tempting a working Northern visitor to play and hike. [MASK] could almost hear the fast-running stream he’d found on his watch-the-sun-come-up walk that morning.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Mattie	“Why, I can remember when [MASK], your momma, first came to this place. She hadn’t been married more than a year. The house was filled with love and happiness. Yes, sir, a lotta love . . . just like it is now.
<name>Highpockets</name>	Highpockets	Priscilla	Suddenly, he turned and jumped from the porch, stalking off around the side of the house while [MASK] looked thoughtfully after him. The red Georgia clay puffed up in balls around Highpockets’ tennis shoes as he played.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Grandma	[MASK] smiled and patted the bed. “To tell the whole truth, honey, it pains me to see you and your family living this way. Especially since you could do better, back down home.” She was worrying the subject like a dog with a bone.
<name>High-pockets</name>	High-pockets	Highpockets	Taking High- pockets by the hand, he walked with him to a log in the yard and sat down. He was aware that whatever he said to [MASK] would reflect his own anxiety, but he decided that all he could do was be honest with his son.
<name>Kevin</name>	Kevin	Junior	His dad was so strict he had to account for every dime of his allowance. [MASK] sat despondently on the side of his bed, staring at the dark eye of his television set. A slow panic fire was growing inside of him. How was he gonna make it.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Nate	“Lay it on me, man,” [MASK] continued chuckling, “I can’t stop laughing, but I’m interested—honest. How the devil did you farm worms?” “I didn’t, but I started to.” “What happened?”
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Junior	[MASK] was too overcome with happiness to remember he was half-afraid of the reception he might receive. He was so glad to see his father that he gave him a big hug ... something he hadn’t done for years.
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Momma	It seemed like she never had enough time alone with him anymore. Between , their jobs, the children, and worrying about bills, there wasn’t very much time left for them. Maybe, she thought, this visit with [MASK] will be a real vacation.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Joe	“You know,” [MASK] said carefully, “I never really imagined the city being so noisy. Kinda thought it was, you know, like loud music, but not noisy, noisy, know what I mean?” “And?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Joe	[MASK], having the same thought, was already dashing across the yard. He just managed to jump into the car before it roared away. At the bottom of the yard, the car swerved onto the road, raising an ominous cloud of red clay that hung in the air like a veil.
<name>Blanche</name>	Blanche	Junior	[MASK] was out of control. “Are you all blind? Can’t you see she hasn’t really been sick a day since we got down here? She’s laying back there propped up in bed pulling the strings and we are her dancing puppets.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Highpockets	[MASK] was excited, hopeful, and tongue-tied. “I ... I met him in the woods this morning. A real old man chopping down a tree. He offered me work at his farm doing chores, fifty cents an hour.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Priscilla	“You weren’t even bom, [MASK], the last time I saw this place; now I can’t see, I’d sorta like to feel it.” Chapter IS “I guess things are changing now, huh?”
<name>She</name>	She	Priscilla	“I’m not budging,” he promised. [MASK] left her husband to his labors with a smile. She was too happy on her first day back home to perform her usual mind-reading, so she couldn’t guess what he was thinking about.
<name>Francie</name>	Francie	Darlene	[MASK] asked her mother. “I watched him for a while—can that man talk! —then I went out... found him in the shed talking about what good shape the place was in and talking about how the roof didn’t leak.”
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Nate	[MASK] followed her to the kitchen. It was almost time for dinner. “How you doing, honey?” she asked, shaking water out of a head of wet lettuce. “How are you doing, honey?”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Joe	In fact, its original purpose was storage—preserves, canned vegetables. But the need to feed an army of children through long winters and/or crop failures never happened and she long ago turned it into a guest room. “Excuse me for interrupting you, [MASK].
<name>Jonas</name>	Jonas	Junior	Tension drained from his body till even his spine lay flat against the curve of the van seat. “Now you look like a human being,” the driver teased. “Instead of a wet chicken,” [MASK] laughed. He felt like a human being too.
<name>Buford</name>	Buford	Junior	[MASK] walked slowly to the edge of the porch, daintily spread a handkerchief on the steps, and sat down. He had started the day clean and pressed and he intended to stay that way—even if there wasn’t anyone around to appreciate his snappy clothes.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Nate	[MASK] shrugged and got into the back seat. In five minutes he was curled up and fast asleep. He didn’t even notice when the car paused for a moment on the early-morning road. He didn’t even hear the door slam, or feel the car speed up again.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Nate	“Makes you kinda sad to see them alone like that. Children gone to the city . . . don’t keep in touch. They just two old people with nobody. . . . It’s not too far now, [MASK]. Slow down.”
<name>Granny</name>	Granny	Grandmother	[MASK]’s lids fluttered. Her thin voice was no louder than a whisper. “No doctor ... No doctor.” She opened her eyes, a faint weak smile played upon her lips. “Nothing a doctor can do when a body’s just got old and worn out.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Nate	“A runaway sharecropper is what Tm in the market for today. I think he’s still in this neck of the woods.” [MASK] felt uncomfortable in the sheriff’s presence, so he waved good-bye to the two men and strolled off.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Nate	“As for your boy, I haven’t seen the kid; if you see him first send him around I could use some help.” And: “No more extensions, and that’s final.” [MASK] eyed his boss and started to speak.
<name>Rusty</name>	Rusty	Nate	They moved on. [MASK] looked in every pool hall, luncheonette, and record store they passed; his eyes scanned the occupants of every car, and the slick, lost teen-agers who preferred to stay in the shadows out of the light.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Priscilla	[MASK] was daydreaming and cleaning up in the kitchen when a knock at the door startled her. “Yes?” she asked, hooking the latch as a reflex, then blushing with embarrassment when she remembered where she was. “Pm sorry,” she said to a strange man.
<name>Artie</name>	Artie	Nate	“And your ma can’t go to work for you,” [MASK] continued, “like she ended up taking care of your puppy.” “But I was little then, not big, going on ten like now ... Dad, Tm gonna do it good, honest.”
<name>Ennis</name>	Ennis	Junior	For some reason, it seemed to him that the position would make the water in his eyes drain to somewhere else. Maybe up to his brain. Wash it out a little. [MASK] lowered his head and knocked on the door. “Coming through!”
