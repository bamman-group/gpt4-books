<name>Meggie</name>	Meggie	John	I’m not blaming anyone. But—” The tears were soaking [MASK]’s nightshirt; he wiped her face with a handkerchief as best he could. “She is so young. It breaks my heart to see her frightened the way she was this afternoon.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Barbara	He was not surprised by the flood of presents-—Waynesboro would conform to the conventions—nor by the acceptance of invitations to wedding and wedding reception; his friends were curious enough to be willing to pay the price of admission: recognition of his wife. [MASK]’s father, on the other hand, was naively delighted.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Blair	But I was in my office the other day, with the door open. There were a couple of boys his age at the teller’s cage when [MASK] went past outside. I suppose they couldn’t see me from where they stood.” “What did they say?”
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Ruhamah	[MASK], who had shed her coat and hat, stood waiting for them at the newel post as they came down the stairs, an already round-shouldered little figure, her plain spectacled face turned up to them. “What is it?” she quavered.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Eliza	“Carry it under your arm.” “But—stockings—indecent.” “Forget it. My automobile is out back. No one will see you. At the hospital orderlies will bring a stretcher.” “A stretcher!” [MASK]’s lips quivered.
<name>Meg</name>	Meg	Ruhamah	“It will kill her to be in such acold room.” “Not if she’s wrapped warm enough. Not with comforts under the bottom sheet, and blankets on top of her. Doctor’s orders. There’s [MASK].” She went to the door.
<name>his grandmother</name>	his grandmother	Jennifer	He had been with [MASK] at the Fiftieth Anniversary dinner and program of the Woman’s Club. It had been at his grandmother’s, and after dinner they had sat in rows of straight-backed chairs to listen while the ladies gave the program.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Deborah	I’m sorry if I seem too pessimistic, but the prognosis is not good. You must be prepared.” “You mean—” [MASK]’s whisper was like a cry of agony. “I thought at the worst she might be lame.
<name>Lottie</name>	Lottie	Anne	He went to the wall telephone, ground the handle, gave his house number, and explained briefly to [MASK], cutting short her exclamations. “I’ll tell you about it when I’ve seen her. Just now I have a hack waiting.
<name>her</name>	her	Anne	Maybe that is why she didn’t let you know in time to get to her grandfather’s funeral.” “Maybe. 1 wouldn’t have gone. What does it matter anyway?” It wasn’t like [MASK] to harp on a subject.
<name>Calliope</name>	Calliope	Dock	“I just want to make sure. I’ll supervise this show myself.” Then, as he noticed that the guests had risen from all the other outside tables and were heading toward the porch, he said, “One thing you might do. [MASK].
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Eliza	We were up most of the night.” “Hemorrhage! Then she isn’t getting better. I thought—” [MASK] shook her head. “She coughs up blood—oh, just a little—all the time. She tries to hide it, but we know.
<name>Lucie</name>	Lucie	Kitty	1 do not need to ask her. [MASK] will at last be free to marry. As for you, you are free to make your own choice. Return to your husband, if he will have you for the children’s sake, after all this time.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Voorhees	“Can I do anything to help, [MASK]? 1 know your wife probably thinks this is the end of the world, but there have been other wars, and other soldiers. In fact, most men my age in this town were once soldiers.
<name>Meg</name>	Meg	Tim	His curls had long since been shorn, but his hair was rather long that day, and the soft wind blew it across his forehead in a thick fringe. His black eyes shone, and the dimples in his round cheeks appeared and disappeared as he trotted along laughing beside [MASK].
<name>John</name>	John	John	Blessed is the man whose bowels move And melt with pity toward the poor. [MASK] struggled with his voice. “You don’t mean—you don’t sing this in church?” “No, not really.”
<name>Abraham</name>	Abraham	Lowrey	But to go back to them—it was really their heredity I was going to speak about. [MASK], in spite of his name, is like me: meek and acquiescent.” “Quiet, maybe, but kind and gentle.” “Thank you.
<name>sister</name>	sister	Ludwig	You go into the hospital to die.” It made no difference that many more patients recovered than were lost. He hoped that his mother and [MASK] would not be the only ones to say, “What a pity she waited so long!”
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Barbara	They helped raise me. I can manage the nigras.” “Come along then, [MASK], and I’ll introduce them: there are only two, after all: the cook and the housemaid-waitress. You will excuse us.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Thomasina	His daughters were grown, his son-in-law perfectly trustworthy, if not very forceful, and his situation—the family situation— should be made clear to them all. “Don’t remind me, [MASK], of what I have so many times expressed as my firm conviction.
<name>Mammy</name>	Mammy	Venny	“No. I’d rather tell him face to face when he comes home at noon. It will be a blow.” “Yas’m. He sho’ dotes on that boy. Maybe I’d oughta hold lunch back a little.” “If you will, [MASK].
<name>General</name>	General	Ludwig	But he did not forget. When [MASK] had got the young people lined up, he led them to the end of the next car, where all the Shermans were disembarking. When the General saw them coming, he stepped aside and waited.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Theresa	[MASK], occupied in backing her mother’s car out of the driveway, did not answer until she had turned safely into the street. Then she said, “Like a fool, if you must know. I can never think of anything to say except ‘Thank you.’”
<name>Kurtz</name>	Kurtz	Zack	[MASK] died of fear—shock—something—not the amputation. But I failed.” With his fists he struck the under side of the mantel two or three times, gently. “I failed in what I was trying to do, and to prove.
<name>President Lincoln</name>	President Lincoln	Cleveland	He lacked magnetism—had in fact a very quenching sort of personality; he was hardly the sort to raise the hero- shout, although he had fought through the war, rising from second lieutenant of an Indiana regiment to brevet brigadier general, as opposed to [MASK]’s having hired a substitute when drafted.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dock	Have to sit on the grass. I’m afraid. There will be all kinds of preliminaries before the General has his turn. [MASK], would you like to circulate through the crowd, after our families are settled? Lots of our old friends here.”
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Thomasina	[MASK] and her mother might not be aware of or resent it, but she was, and did. Even now, with her day ruined, she felt better when she had finished with her hair, had whipped the protective towel from her shoulders, and looked herself over in her glass.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Eliza	None of it is complicated, just time-consuming. It would help, of course, if a secretary could take dictation in shorthand and use the typewriter. Have you ever seen a typewriter?” [MASK] shook her head.
<name>Kipling</name>	Kipling	Kipling	They will be waited on hand and foot, have servants by the dozen, and transfer to the mountains for the hot season.v “You’ve been reading too much [MASK]. You’re thinking of British army officers. 1 don’t believe missionaries live like that.”
<name>him</name>	him	Paul	And you had better admit that you cannot manage [MASK]. Do you want to lose him too?” “If he marries this girl, I will consider him lost. I told your father last night that she will never be welcome here!”
<name>Mrs. Ballard</name>	Mrs. Ballard	Christina	“No. It would seem indecent, wouldn’t it, so soon? And with three Ballard women in mourning, it would not be a very happy occasion. [MASK] will be pleased, at any rate: she thinks the celebration of Christmas a pagan practice.”
<name>Congress</name>	Congress	Congress	The President, still endeavoring to negotiate, lost so much influence with the legislators that had he failed in April to send [MASK] a message asking for a declaration of war, it would have exercised its constitutional right and acted without a request from him.
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Rodney	The carriage was waiting; [MASK] must have sent his man with it. As in a number of families in that decade, the horse and carriage had been turned over to the wife for her use when the husband bought an automobile.
<name>Mr. Pontellier</name>	Mr. Pontellier	Sheldon	“You will have the two boys to raise, and children grow up so quickly, in the blink of an eye. You will be surprised some day to find how fast the years have gone.” [MASK] rose, straightened his tie, and pulled down his rumpled jacket.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Paul	“Some of them are getting pretty big to consider it fun to sleep on mattresses on the floor. Let me take at least one lot of them.” “Not [MASK]’s. I’m trying to make amends for his sake and your father’s.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Mamma	And with an odd grown-up inflection, “[MASK] has mentioned you, but—” She hesitated and her voice came out toneless and flat. “She’s sick.” “Then will you tell her for me, please, that I asked for her?”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Ariana	It wouldn’t occur to them that she just might not care for their plans. You know,” she said thoughtfully, “I don’t believe they ever really looked at [MASK] to see what she was like.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Anne	Open the windows, too—clear the air in here.” “Twenty-four hours,” [MASK] said slowly. “Right after the neighbors saw her.” With the shutters open and more daylight in the room, she could see on the table a pile of library books.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Anne	[MASK], too, was having trouble keeping her mind on the meeting. “All these old ladies,” she thought resentfully, and was surprised at herself. She had never felt like this before: as if it were all a waste of time.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Johnny	“Yes, sir.” [MASK] gulped. “I thought if I proved I could do it, maybe I could get a job for the summer.” “I see. And do you still think you want it?”
<name>He</name>	He	Kate	As he stepped into the aisle and away from her, she had the impulse to follow and push ahead of him, to shield him from anyone’s glance. His expression, his pallor, his fixed eyes, were a kind of nakedness in public. [MASK] had done something awful.
<name>Miss Bates</name>	Miss Bates	Sally	[MASK] pulled her reading glasses from the button pinned below her shoulder and took the letter. When she had finished reading it, and was holding it in a trembling hand in her lap, she said, “There’s nothing official about this. It’s just gossip.
<name>he</name>	he	Amanda	I guess, from what [MASK] said, in the hope that by meeting more temptation, he’ll get so he can resist.” “Then that’s to the good, isn’t it? It’s high time those kids were given a little leeway.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	John	“I seen your light burning. I hoped you were still here. I just stopped on the way back to the depot.” “I’m still here.” [MASK] interrupted the nervous flow of speech. “Is there anything I can do for you?”
<name>ice cream</name>	ice cream	Grandmother	Haven’t you noticed how faults are exaggerated in old age? Maybe the controls slip that conceal how difficult people really are, underneath. But people do love [MASK], you know: it isn’t hard.” “I have never known any old people really well.”
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Martha	Dese tacks all loose.” She pulled back the carpet from the angle of the baseboard. “Whut Ah fin’?” “I don’t know. What?” “Ah decla’l” [MASK] was not slow. “Nothin’ but of paper.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Tucker	“We want to hear all about school, and what you do with yourself when you’re not in school—and whether you get to the beach, and are learning to swim.” “I already know how to swim.” [MASK] was surprised at such ignorance on the part of his father.
<name>Nixon</name>	Nixon	Debs	Their interests are identical: to keep an industry running at a profit, so that all can earn a living. You’ve been reading some pretty one-sided stuff. That jailbird [MASK]?” “I would vote for him if 1 were old enough to vote.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Binny	“I’m glad you think he’s good. The town could use more doctors. I really stopped in to ask whether I might spend an evening with [MASK] now and then. She must get mighty bored, lying there in bed.” “Of course.
<name>Caesar</name>	Caesar	Caesar	That is why I hope, in a class with her friends—” “But she is such an ardent soul! I can’t imagine her not throwing herself headlong into any undertaking.” “She has not been ardent about [MASK]’s Gallic Wars, believe me.”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Elsa	Games might pall, but they were both readers, almost compulsively addicted to the printed word. The first time [MASK], on a rainy Saturday afternoon, came upon them in the living room, each curled up with a book, she protested vigorously.
<name>she</name>	she	Elizabeth	“Isn’t she—” They laughed; they had grown up in bookish households, and read without restriction whatever on the parental shelves had taken their fancy. But after a moment [MASK] brought them back to the business in hand.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Anne	The two young women were silent for a moment, relishing the prospect of the “conniption-fit.” Then [MASK] said, “I suppose I’ll not see much of you the rest of the winter if you are going to turn theatrical manager.
<name>Stevens</name>	Stevens	Jessamine	And I never heard him use so many words to say so little. To avoid mentioning what? Whom? His cousin [MASK]?” She said, “What’s he like, this Stevens? Did your young cousin marry him?”
<name>George</name>	George	Mamma	You should never have given him that automobile, [MASK].” “He’s old enough to be independent. When we’re in the country, he can’t be expected to come and go with his father. Or stand around waiting for the trolley.
<name>seats</name>	seats	Democrats	The men were again struck by the coming elections, when a new House of Representatives would be chosen. Nationally the makeup of the new Congress was of crucial importance: [MASK] must be replaced by Republicans, and the menace of wild Democratic notions removed.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Shakespeare	I enjoyed the play, but [MASK] isn’t exactly a cheerful fellow, would you say? ‘Sceptre, learning, physic must all follow this and come to dust.’” “But what made you so glum?” “Skeletons beneath the flesh beginning to show.”
<name>Lister</name>	Lister	Lister	“I’d like to try to save it. A compound fracture always has meant amputation, but I don’t think it should. [MASK] has saved one or two—there’ve been papers of his printed. I’ll try carbolic acid dressings as he suggests.
<name>Mrs. Sacheverell</name>	Mrs. Sacheverell	Mamma	“We have an excellent ayah, devoted to us all. We brought her home with us. That is why I can spend this time at [MASK]’s. She promised solemnly that she would take them to school every morning and meet them when school was out.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	John	That was hard. How could he go on, I wonder?” “He wanted to be remembered to you, with his sympathy.” [MASK]’s eyes misted over. He could not bring himself to say anything beyond a murmured “Thank you.”
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Amanda	He’s well-prepared enough for the Seminary, but his father and I decided he needed more experience first, particularly in associating with other young men his own age.” [MASK] thought, but of course did not say, that it was a little late for that.
<name>Edwards</name>	Edwards	Eliza	He said, “It’s all right. [MASK] knows as well as I do what to say in acknowledging these orders. Just so you get the hemp orders in the mail—leave the other things on my desk. I’ll sign them.
<name>The mother</name>	The mother	Julia	“Now that’s rubbish,” the midwife said, cheerful and bustling. “You know in a couple of years you’ll be ready for another. You’ll have forgotten all about this.” [MASK] opened her eyes, dull with drugs and exhaustion, and stared at her.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Barbara	The boys who had been sitting on the box opened its lid and began to pile its load of snowballs on the ground. “Forward into battery! Action front!” [MASK] had seen her father putting these boys through artillery drill the previous summer, for their amusement and his.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Kate	“At [MASK]’s?” She sat down quickly on the foot of the bed, obscurely frightened. “What kind of a row?” He turned over and sat up then, his feet over the side of the bed, his elbows on his knees, his hands in his hair.
<name>Conrad</name>	Conrad	Johnny	[MASK], who had never heard his mother talk so—almost like a preacher—hung his head in embarrassment. His father looked at her steadily, and was surprised, when he caught her eye, to see in it, besides rejection of his judgment, a quick and quickly veiled look of fear.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Rudy	She is young, and a very handsome woman. And 1 understand the hills and canyons out West are full of bachelors.” “She didn’t care very much about—being married.” [MASK] wondered at the power of love not to blind its victims but to make them acquiescent.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Johnny	But she can’t afford a good military school, and a second-rate one—” “Wait and see, [MASK],” she had said. “We’ll hear from him sooner or later. It may not turn out to be as bad as he thinks.”
<name>Mr. March</name>	Mr. March	Ernest	But if I can’t, I suppose I can’t.” She shrugged her shoulders and rose from the table where she and her mother had been dawdling over their morning coffee, more or less waiting for [MASK]’s wife and children to come down.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Theresa	And so [MASK], during the rest of the winter of 1929-30, spent her days in her bedroom, making a show of getting some work done, but spending a lot of time sharpening pencils and looking at blank pieces of paper, and thing of what a clamorous household she lived in.
<name>Doctor</name>	Doctor	Johnny	[MASK], who had been with her most of the night, came to the breakfast table drawn and exhausted, and reported to his mother that the long-expected death had occurred. “And you had to be there? And her family? And the nurse—?”
<name>He</name>	He	John	[MASK] did not like the stricken look on her face. He drew her to him and sat down with her on the couch by the window; with his arm around her, he brought her head to his shoulder and laid his cheek on her bright brown hair.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	John	She put her hand on one of his. “She was a happy child; don’t remember the occasional tears: remember how transparently joyous she could be for some small reason. Oh, [MASK]! She was my baby and I loved her with all my heart.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Elsa	[MASK], your father must have some influence with her: couldn’t he suggest—?” “I asked him. He said he’d as soon tangle with a buzz saw. Her private life and what she chooses to do with it is none of his business.”
<name>He</name>	He	Tucker	“I’ll tell you why 1 want it, if you will promise not to laugh or think I’m silly—or being presumptuous to believe I can do it. Or tell anyone else.” He smiled at her. [MASK] had a heartwarming smile.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Blair	“I got caught. I’m sorry.” “So I understand. Caught by a stein of beer. Am I to be serious about a drinking man? [MASK] wants to know.” “He tell you he tasted it himself?
<name>Miss Emily Grierson</name>	Miss Emily Grierson	Jessamine	She had long since come to accept [MASK] as a relative and kind of friend, as one did accept relatives, in spite of their shortcomings; and besides, whatever the questions in her own mind, to make an intimate of her would quiet any surmises in the minds of others.
<name>Mrs. Wilkins</name>	Mrs. Wilkins	Henry	She has heard about it too often. 1 spoke to her, too, and got the same rebuff; so I suppose did other Club members. And who knows how many have spoken about him to [MASK] in the bank? Chauffeur to a general: she wouldn’t like that.
<name>Snape</name>	Snape	Sally	They looked at each other in consternation. “But she can’t be going to give us demerits. We’re through with all that. It’s just her manner. She can’t help it.” “As if we hadn’t better things to do,” [MASK] grumbled.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Elsa	“Oh, [MASK]. She adores her father and he thinks she can do no wrong. She hates being a girl. I suspect she has the best brain of our lot, but she may as well be reconciled. I shall have to take her in hand soon.”
<name>Aunt Chloe</name>	Aunt Chloe	Cassie	I’ll take her,” and take her he did, from a willing [MASK], who felt her age as “de mis’ry in ma back,” but would not have owned herself unable to carry a child upstairs.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Yassuh	If you’re not, the fighting was wasted. If you are, then you can stand to lose a leg as well as the crippled soldiers you see on the street every day of your life.” “[MASK]. But white men mo’ use’ to bein’ brave.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Anne	“To die alone, like that, after all those many, many years, without ever having really lived. That seems so sad: year in and year out, and never anything. And now, this.” [MASK] looked at her, startled.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Eliza	But I saw her with him once, and the way she looked at him. But he ran off to the circus three or four years ago.” “And in spite of all common sense, you think she may have joined him?” [MASK] nodded.
<name>Ivy</name>	Ivy	Edwards	My husband—they call him ‘young [MASK]’ in the store— has told me about you. Do you suppose you can fit me with a pair of white gloves, so that I shall not be ashamed to go to my Club meeting?
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Ellen	You’re excused, unless,” he grinned at them, “you are playing for your own pleasure.” They stopped at once. [MASK] said, “Oh, no—I don’t mean it wasn’t a pleasure, but it is time I was getting home.”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Paul	“[MASK] and your father may go. I thank you, but 1 decline. I have no desire to meet her. Your father says we are going to the wedding, but after that—” She made a brushing away gesture with her hands as she stopped for a moment facing the window.
<name>Hemingway</name>	Hemingway	Ludwig	For the surgeons there was none of that fight-and-run, stand-fight-and-run, this way, that way.” “I suppose the doctors had a peaceful day, cutting off arms and legs.” [MASK] laughed ruefully.
<name>The person</name>	The person	Amanda	“The doctors haven’t much hope. I can tell, though they don’t say so. Do you want what little I have, or not? Don’t be too proud to say so.” [MASK] was too proud.
<name>John</name>	John	Rose	But what about the quarantine?” “Of course. Get the draperies down off the windows. Have [MASK] boil them. Give him plenty of air, and keep him wrapped up warm. There must be strict isolation from the rest of the household.”
<name>Andrew</name>	Andrew	Ludwig	His own two older sons obviously had not been gifted with the acumen for business or finance, and they had little interest in the manufacture of rope. This lack confounded [MASK], who never went into the mill without feeling horizons opened, his imagination fired.
<name>Hermione</name>	Hermione	Ruhamah	He continued with explicit directions as to other precautions to be taken. Upstairs, [MASK] ignored her thumping heart and marched steadily along the hall to the door she had heard the others come out of; she rapped lightly, opened it, and went in.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	John	It was four o’clock before [MASK] came in and sought her, found her still in the rocker, her knitting in her hands, a kind of everydayness that she was offering him. He came to stand before iter, one foot on the fender, his left arm extended along the mantel’s edge.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Blair	“She seemed almost shocked at my taking [MASK]’s defection so hard.” “I am glad. I haven’t liked to say anything—but everyone who has talked to me has said, ‘But other boys have gone off to be soldiers before now, don’t take it so hard.’
<name>Job</name>	Job	Job	So you mustn’t be surprised, nor grieved when—Read the Book of [MASK], and you will see that dying is not something to be afraid of. Verses like, ‘He dis-covereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death.’”
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Johnny	“Divorce! Oh, [MASK]! She couldn’t! It’s unthinkable.” “Not to her, it isn’t. She seems to have been thinking of it for a long while—even before this gave her justification.
<name>Mother</name>	Mother	Mary	He is old enough to have outgrown his father’s crackpot ideas. An out-and-out Socialist?” “Then you must also doubt my judgment. Because I am an out-and-out Socialist too.” “Oh, [MASK]!”
<name>Mrs. Breedlove</name>	Mrs. Breedlove	Martha	She has been good to us all her life; now it is our turn,” and generally managed to spend part of her afternoons with [MASK] in the kitchen. talking, listening, waiting for the old woman to awaken when she dropped into a doze.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Johnny	How happy they sounded! Only the young—but “happy” was not the word. One could be happy at any age. “Lighthearted”—only the young could be so lighthearted. She called [MASK] into the dining room.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Ludwig	You don’t know, either, how many loaves of yesterday’s bread I sell for a penny a loaf.” [MASK] thought, “Still driving that bakery cart, when he makes the best hard crackers to go with beer and cheese I’ve ever eaten.”
