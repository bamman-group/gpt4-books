<name>Gandalf</name>	Gandalf	Gandalf	‘So do I,’ said [MASK], ‘and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Frodo	When the light of the last farm was far behind, peeping among the trees, [MASK] turned and waved a hand in farewell. ‘I wonder if I shall ever look down into that valley again,’ he said quietly. When they had walked for about three hours they rested.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Frodo	Laboriously they climbed a sharp slope and halted for a moment at the top. [MASK] felt a soft touch on his face. He put out his arm and saw the dim white flakes of snow settling on his sleeve. They went on.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Bilbo	He was just trying to put poor [MASK] off his guard. And I daresay it amused his wickedness to start a game which might end in providing him with an easy victim, but if he lost would not hurt him.’
<name>Gandalf</name>	Gandalf	Merry	‘I can’t keep it dark any longer. I have got something to tell you all. But I don’t know quite how to begin.’ ‘I think I could help you,’ said [MASK] quietly, ‘by telling you some of it myself.’
<name>Isildur</name>	Isildur	Isildur	On some errand of mischief. But that does not matter much now. His worst mischief was done. ‘Yes, alas! through him the Enemy has learned that the One has been found again. He knows where [MASK] fell.
<name>Gandalf</name>	Gandalf	Strider	Now we know who made the path - and we had better get off it quick.’ ‘There is no need, I think,’ said [MASK], coming out. ‘It is certainly a troll-hole, but it seems to have been long forsaken.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Frodo	I knew at last that something dark and deadly was at work. And I have spent most of the years since then in finding out the truth of it.’ ‘There wasn’t any permanent harm done, was there?’ asked [MASK] anxiously.
<name>Gandalf</name>	Gandalf	Gandalf	He hardly dared to breathe, and yet the desire to get it out of his pocket became so strong that he began slowly to move his hand. He felt that he had only to slip it on, and then he would be safe. The advice of [MASK] seemed absurd.
<name>Gandalf</name>	Gandalf	Gandalf	Your own way you alone can choose. In this matter I cannot advise you. I am not [MASK], and though I have tried to bear his part, I do not know what design or hope he had for this hour, if indeed he had any.
<name>Gandalf</name>	Gandalf	Tom	By the time that [MASK] returned they were feeling strong (and hungry). He reappeared, hat first, over the brow of the hill, and behind him came in an obedient line six ponies: their own five and one more.
<name>Gandalf</name>	Gandalf	Gandalf	‘You must trust me now. Your Frodo is made of sterner stuff than I had guessed, though [MASK] hinted that it might prove so. He is not slain, and I think he will resist the evil power of the wound longer than his enemies expect.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Sam	It was some time before he looked about him again or even turned to his neighbours. He looked first for his friends. [MASK] had begged to be allowed to wait on his master, but had been told that for this time he was a guest of honour.
<name>Merry</name>	Merry	Frodo	‘You had better lead on and find that path,’ [MASK] said to him. ‘Don’t let us lose one another, or forget which way the Hedge lies!’ They picked a way among the trees, and their ponies plodded along, carefully avoiding the many writhing and interlacing roots.
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Frodo	It has great virtues, but over such a wound as this its healing powers may be small.’ He threw the leaves into boiling water and bathed [MASK]’s shoulder. The fragrance of the steam was refreshing, and those that were unhurt felt their minds calmed and cleared.
<name>Pippin</name>	Pippin	Frodo	There was a ring of metal. The sounds died slowly away, and seemed to go southward, on into the wood. A head appeared suddenly through the hole in the flet. [MASK] sat up in alarm and saw that it was a grey-hooded Elf.
<name>Gandalf</name>	Gandalf	Gildor	I will take [MASK]’s advice. If the danger were not so dark, I should dance for joy. Even so, I cannot help feeling happy; happier than I have felt for a long time. I had dreaded this evening.’ ‘Good!
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Frodo	So terrible was it that [MASK] stood rooted, unable to cry out or to withdraw his gaze. The Eye was rimmed with fire, but was itself glazed, yellow as a cat’s, watchful and intent, and the black slit of its pupil opened on a pit, a window into nothing.
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Frodo	It was dark, and white stars were shining, when [MASK] and his companions came at last to the Greenway-crossing and drew near the village. They came to the West-gate and found it shut; but at the door of the lodge beyond it, there was a man sitting.
<name>Lucien</name>	Lucien	Frodo	‘Surely you see it, my friend?’ he said, turning now suddenly to [MASK] again. ‘You say that you are afraid. If it is so, the boldest should pardon you. But is it not really your good sense that revolts?’
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Frodo	He laid his hand on the hobbit’s shoulder in friendly fashion; but [MASK] felt the hand trembling with suppressed excitement. He stepped quickly away, and eyed with alarm the tall Man, nearly twice his height and many times his match in strength.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Bilbo	‘Good ... good luck!’ cried [MASK], stuttering with the cold. ‘I don’t suppose you will be able to keep a diary, Frodo my lad, but I shall expect a full account when you get back. And don’t be too long!
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Frodo	It looked like the black shade of a horse led by a smaller black shadow. The black shadow stood close to the point where they had left the path, and it swayed from side to side. [MASK] thought he heard the sound of snuffling.
<name>Phyllis</name>	Phyllis	Elrond	I want your help in something urgent. [MASK] says this song of mine is to be finished before the end of the evening, and I am stuck. Let’s go off into a comer and polish it up!’
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Frodo	‘Look!’ he cried; and stooping he lifted from the ground a black cloak that had lain there hidden by the darkness. A foot above the lower hem there was a slash. ‘This was the stroke of [MASK]’s sword,’ he said.
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Pippin	‘And if you are supposed to be on the road, there is some chance that you will be looked for on the road and not off it.’ ‘All right!’ said [MASK]. ‘I will follow you into every bog and ditch.
<name>Gandalf</name>	Gandalf	Strider	[MASK] looked grave. ‘I do not know,’ he said. ‘I came west with him in the spring. I have often kept watch on the borders of the Shire in the last few years, when he was busy elsewhere. He seldom left it unguarded.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Sam	We know a good deal about the Ring. We are horribly afraid - but we are coming with you; or following you like hounds.’ ‘And after all, sir,’ added [MASK], ‘you did ought to take the Elves’ advice.
<name>Gimli</name>	Gimli	Gimli	And on the other side the snow suddenly grows less, while further down it is no more than a white coverlet to cool a hobbit’s toes.’ ‘Ah, it is as I said,’ growled [MASK]. ‘It was no ordinary storm.
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Frodo	Behind him they walked in file, threading their way with care, for under the weedy pools were sliding and greasy stones, and footing was treacherous. [MASK] shuddered with disgust at the touch of the dark unclean water on his feet.
<name>Gandalf</name>	Gandalf	Strider	said [MASK]. ‘I knew nothing of this letter. For all I knew I had to persuade you to trust me without proofs, if I was to help you. In any case, I did not intend to tell you all about myself at once.
<name>Godfrey</name>	Godfrey	Saruman	Wait!” ‘And I waited. Until that night when he left this house. He said and did things then that filled me with a fear that no words of [MASK] could allay. I knew at last that something dark and deadly was at work.
<name>Gandalf</name>	Gandalf	Gandalf	‘Why didn’t you tell me that you were [MASK]’s friend at once?’ he asked. ‘It would have saved time.’ ‘Would it? Would any of you have believed me till now?’
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Frodo	[MASK] wandered round the familiar rooms, and saw the light of the sunset fade on the walls, and shadows creep out of the comers. It grew slowly dark indoors. He went out and walked down to the gate at the bottom of the path, and then on a short way down the Hill Road.
<name>Galadriel</name>	Galadriel	Goldberry	[MASK] shall wear it now, and we will not forget her!’ For each of the hobbits he chose a dagger, long, leaf-shaped, and keen, of marvellous workmanship, damasked with serpent-forms in red and gold.
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Frodo	During the next year or two he had turned up fairly often, coming unexpectedly after dusk, and going off without warning before sunrise. He would not discuss his own business and journeys, and seemed chiefly interested in small news about [MASK]’s health and doings.
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Gandalf	What fun to be off again, off on the Road with dwarves! This is what I have really been longing for, for years! Good-bye!’ he said, looking at his old home and bowing to the door. ‘Good-bye, [MASK]!’
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Hal	Your [MASK]’s always saying he’s seen things; and maybe he sees things that ain’t there.’ ‘But this one was as big as an elm tree, and walking - walking seven yards to a stride, if it was an inch.’
<name>Gandalf</name>	Gandalf	Gandalf	This then is one choice before you, before us. We may join with that Power. It would be wise, [MASK]. There is hope that way. Its victory is at hand; and there will be rich reward for those that aided it.
<name>Emil</name>	Emil	Bilbo	I did not know [MASK], of course, as well as I know you; I was too young, and he was also more careful - but he was not careful enough. If you want to know how I first found out, I will tell you.’
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Sam	‘What do they live on when they can’t get hobbit?’ asked [MASK], scratching his neck. They spent a miserable day in this lonely and unpleasant country. Their camping-place was damp, cold, and uncomfortable; and the biting insects would not let them sleep.
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Frodo	They leapt up refreshed. [MASK] ran to the eastern window, and found himself looking into a kitchen-garden grey with dew. He had half expected to see turf right up to the walls, turf all pocked with hoof-prints.
<name>Elrond</name>	Elrond	Elbereth	I am getting very old, and I began to wonder if I should live to see your chapters of our story. Good night! I’ll take a walk, I think, and look at the stars of [MASK] in the garden. Sleep well!’
<name>Lady</name>	Lady	Lady	It seemed to them that they did little but eat and drink and rest, and walk among the trees; and it was enough. They had not seen the Lord and [MASK] again, and they had little speech with the Elven-folk; for few of these knew or would use the Westron tongue.
<name>Renewed</name>	Renewed	Renewed	The old that is strong does not wither, Deep roots are not reached by the frost. From the ashes a fire shall be woken, A light from the shadows shall spring; [MASK] shall be blade that was broken: The crownless again shall be king.
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Frodo	Beside it a broad white ladder stood, and at its foot three Elves were seated. They sprang up as the travellers approached, and [MASK] saw that they were tall and clad in grey mail, and from their shoulders hung long white cloaks.
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Barliman	The audience all opened their mouths wide for laughter, and stopped short in gaping silence; for the singer disappeared. He simply vanished, as if he had gone slap through the floor without leaving a hole! The local hobbits stared in amazement, and then sprang to their feet and shouted for [MASK].
<name>Pippin</name>	Pippin	Pippin	We want to go on.’ ‘That’s what I meant,’ said [MASK]. ‘We hobbits ought to stick together, and we will. I shall go, unless they chain me up. There must be someone with intelligence in the party.’
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Fanuilos	Even as they stepped over the threshold a single clear voice rose in song. A Elbereth Gilthoniel, silivren penna miriel 0 menel aglar elenath! Na-chaered palan-diriel 0 galadhremmin ennorath, [MASK], le linnathon nef aear, si nef aearon!
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Frodo	It was a cheerless land, and their journey was slow and gloomy. They spoke little as they trudged along. [MASK]’s heart was grieved as he watched them walking beside him with their heads down, and their backs bowed under their burdens.
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Pippin	They passed along the edge of a huge turnip-field, and came to a stout gate. Beyond it a rutted lane ran between low well-laid hedges towards a distant clump of trees. [MASK] stopped. ‘I know these fields and this gate!’
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Sam	‘That’s hard, trying to go without me and all. If I hadn’t a guessed right, where would you be now?’ ‘Safely on my way.’ ‘Safely!’ said [MASK]. ‘All alone and without me to help you?
<name>Pippin</name>	Pippin	Sam	He turned and saw that [MASK] was now standing beside him, looking round with a puzzled expression, and rubbing his eyes as if he was not sure that he was awake. ‘It’s sunlight and bright day, right enough,’ he said.
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Frodo	I will roast the old fool over a slow fire.” He expected no less, and when he saw my face he fell down flat and began to melt on the spot.’ ‘What did you do to him?’ cried [MASK] in alarm.
<name>Samwise</name>	Samwise	Sam	But [MASK] had more on his mind than gardening. After a while he sighed, and got up and went out. It was early April and the sky was now clearing after heavy rain. The sun was down, and a cool pale evening was quietly fading into night.
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Frodo	[MASK] suddenly felt very foolish, and found himself (as was his habit when making a speech) fingering the things in his pocket. He felt the Ring on its chain, and quite unaccountably the desire came over him to slip it on and vanish out of the silly situation.
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Bilbo	In the end [MASK] won the game, more by luck (as it seemed) than by wits; for he was stumped at last for a riddle to ask, and cried out, as his hand came upon the ring he had picked up and forgotten: What have I got in my pocket?
<name>Baggins</name>	Baggins	Maggot	It was five miles or more from [MASK]’s lane to the Ferry. The hobbits wrapped themselves up, but their ears were strained for any sound above the creak of the wheels and the slow clop of the ponies’ hoofs.
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Frodo	Alas! the wounds of this weapon are beyond my skill to heal. I will do what I can — but all the more do I urge you now to go on without rest.’ He searched the wound on [MASK]’s shoulder with his fingers, and *
<name>Aragorn</name>	Aragorn	Aragorn	It was there that the snow first began to burden us. If we could reach that point, maybe it would prove easier beyond. It is no more than a furlong off, I guess.’ ‘Then let us force a path thither, you and I!’ said [MASK].
<name>Gandalf</name>	Gandalf	Bilbo	‘Well, what about it?’ ‘What do you know already?’ ‘Only what [MASK] told me. I have heard his story: how he found it, and how he used it: on his journey, I mean.’
<name>Gandalf</name>	Gandalf	Gandalf	It was an ancient defence of the Dwarves against any enemy that might capture the First Hall and the outer passages. They could only pass across it in single file. At the brink [MASK] halted and the others came up in a pack behind.
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Frodo	[MASK] took the phial, and for a moment as it shone between them, he saw her again standing like a queen, great and beautiful, but no longer terrible. He bowed, but found no words to say.
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Bilbo	‘Good-bye, for the present, [MASK]. Take care of yourself! You are old enough, and perhaps wise enough.’ ‘Take care! I don’t care. Don’t you worry about me!
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Frodo	Their mattresses and pillows were soft as down, and the blankets were of white wool. They had hardly laid themselves on the deep beds and drawn the light covers over them before they were asleep. In the dead night, [MASK] lay in a dream without light.
<name>Gandalf</name>	Gandalf	Boromir	At this the stranger, [MASK], broke in. ‘So that is what became of the Ring!’ he cried. ‘If ever such a tale was told in the South, it has long been forgotten.
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Frodo	But I will always help you.’ He laid his hand on [MASK]’s shoulder. ‘I will help you bear this burden, as long as it is yours to bear. But we must do something, soon. The Enemy is moving.’
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Bilbo	But one beyond your strength, [MASK]. You cannot take this thing back. It has passed on. If you need my advice any longer, I should say that your part is ended, unless as a recorder. Finish your book, and leave the ending unaltered!
<name>Gollum</name>	Gollum	Gollum	Lurking by a stagnant mere, peering in the water as the dark eve fell, I caught him, [MASK]. He was covered with green slime. He will never love me, I fear; for he bit me, and I was not gentle.
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Strider	said [MASK]. It was already mid-day when they drew near the southern end of the path, and saw before them, in the pale clear light of the October sun, a grey-green bank, leading up like a bridge on to the northward slope of the hill.
<name>Alan</name>	Alan	Maggot	[MASK] looked at him thoughtfully. ‘Well, I see you have ideas of your own,’ he said. ‘It is as plain as my nose that no accident brought you and that rider here on the same afternoon; and maybe my news was no great news to you, after all.
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Bilbo	And he is bound up with the fate of the Ring. My heart tells me that he has some part to play yet, for good or ill, before the end; and when that comes, the pity of [MASK] may rule the fate of many - yours not least.
<name>Pippin</name>	Pippin	Frodo	They seem to like them as much as food, or more. They will be going on for a long time yet. What do you say to slipping off for some more quiet talk?’ ‘Can we?’ said [MASK]. ‘Of course.
<name>Pippin</name>	Pippin	Pippin	He lay motionless, still listening; but all was now silent, and at last he turned and fell asleep again or wandered into some other unremembered dream. At his side [MASK] lay dreaming pleasantly; but a change came over his dreams and he turned and groaned.
<name>Goldberry</name>	Goldberry	Tom	[MASK]’s going on ahead candles for to kindle. Down west sinks the Sun: soon you will be groping. When the night-shadows fall, then the door will open, Out of the window-panes light will twinkle yellow. Fear no alder black!
<name>Théoden</name>	Théoden	Legolas	he asked, pointing to the northern sky. ‘Is it, as I think, an eagle?’ ‘Yes,’ said [MASK]. ‘It is an eagle, a hunting eagle. I wonder what that forebodes. It is far from the mountains.’
<name>Gandalf</name>	Gandalf	Elrond	‘You have done well to come,’ said [MASK]. ‘You will hear today all that you need in order to understand the purposes of the Enemy. There is naught that you can do, other than to resist, with hope or without it.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Frodo	If what I’ve seen turns out true, somebody’s going to catch it hot!’ ‘Do you now wish to look, [MASK]?’ said the Lady Galadriel. ‘You did not wish to see Elf-magic and were content.’
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Bilbo	‘Just what I said myself,’ said [MASK]. ‘But never mind about looks. You can wear it under your outer clothes. Come on! You must share this secret with me. Don’t tell anybody else! But I should feel happier if I knew you were wearing it.
<name>Legolas</name>	Legolas	Aragom	Only [MASK] was silent and restless. After a while he left the Company and wandered on to the ridge; there he stood in the shadow of a tree, looking out southwards and westwards, with his head posed as if he was listening.
<name>Gandalf</name>	Gandalf	Gandalf	‘I thought I knew the elf-letters, but I cannot read these.’ ‘The words are in the elven-tongue of the West of Middle-earth in the Elder Days,’ answered [MASK]. ‘But they do not say anything of importance to us.
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Strider	He paused and stood in anxious thought. Each of the hobbits saw in his mind a vision of the cloaked and booted Riders. If the horsemen had already found the dell, the sooner [MASK] led them somewhere else the better.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Sam	‘No rope! And only last night you said to yourself: “[MASK], what about a bit of rope? Y ou’ll want it, if you haven’t got it.” Well, I’ll want it. I can’t get it now.’
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Frodo	He put out his arm and saw the dim white flakes of snow settling on his sleeve. They went on. But before long the snow was falling fast, filling all the air, and swirling into [MASK]’s eyes.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Pippin	‘What fellow do you mean?’ asked [MASK]. ‘Then you haven’t seen him?’ said the farmer. ‘He went up the lane towards the causeway not a long while back. He was a funny customer and asking funny questions.
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Frodo	Then the Eye began to rove, searching this way and that; and [MASK] knew with certainty and horror that among the many things that it sought he himself was one. But he also knew that it could not see him - not yet, not unless he willed it.
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Frodo	‘I am so sleepy,’ he said, ‘that soon I shall fall down on the road. Are you going to sleep on your legs? It is nearly midnight.’ ‘I thought you liked walking in the dark,’ said [MASK].
<name>Sting</name>	Sting	Sting	Then he drew it, and its polished and well-tended blade glittered suddenly, cold and bright. ‘This is [MASK],’ he said, and thrust it with little effort deep into a wooden beam. ‘Take it, if you like.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Frodo	‘He’ll squeeze me in two, if you don’t. He says so!’ ‘Who? What?’ shouted [MASK], rushing round to the other side of the tree. ‘Put it out! Put it out!’
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Bilbo	I have known few hobbits, save [MASK] here; and it seems to me that he is perhaps not so alone and singular as I had thought him. The world has changed much since I last was on the westward roads.
<name>Gandalf</name>	Gandalf	Celeborn	At length [MASK] spoke of their departure. ‘Now is the time,’ he said, ‘when those who wish to continue the Quest must harden their hearts to leave this land. Those who no longer wish to go forward may remain here, for a while.
<name>Pippin</name>	Pippin	Sam	‘You at least shall go with him. It is hardly possible to separate you from him, even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not.’ [MASK] sat down, blushing and muttering.
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Frodo	The others cast themselves down upon the fragrant grass, but [MASK] stood awhile still lost in wonder. It seemed to him that he had stepped through a high window that looked on a vanished world. A light was upon it for which his language had no name.
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Frodo	‘Look!’ he said, clutching [MASK] by the arm. They all looked, and on the edge high above them they saw against the sky a horse standing. Beside it stooped a black figure. They at once gave up any idea of going back.
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Frodo	He hurried off and disappeared again into the darkness. [MASK] dozed, though the pain of his wound was slowly growing, and a deadly chill was spreading from his shoulder to his arm and side. His friends watched over him, warming him, and bathing his wound.
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Sam	Come and go as you like, as long as you don’t make a noise.’ They got up and withdrew quietly into the shadows, and made for the doors. [MASK] they left behind, fast asleep still with a smile on his face.
<name>Galadriel</name>	Galadriel	Galadriel	Yet it is not yours to give me, even if you would; and only through darkness shall I come to it.’ ‘Yet maybe this will lighten your heart,’ said [MASK]; ‘for it was left in my care to be given to you, should you pass through this land.’
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Frodo	‘What shall we look for, and what shall we see?’ asked [MASK], filled with awe. ‘Many things I can command the Mirror to reveal,’ she answered, ‘and to some I can show what they desire to see.
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Frodo	Ever since this spring we have kept our eyes open, and done a good deal of planning on our own account. You are not going to escape so easily!’ ‘But I must go,’ said [MASK]. ‘It cannot be helped, dear friends.
<name>Boromir</name>	Boromir	Boromir	There was only one thing he could do: trembling he pulled out the Ring upon its chain and quickly slipped it on his finger, even as [MASK] sprang at him again. The Man gasped, stared for a moment amazed, and then ran wildly about, seeking here and there among the rocks and trees.
