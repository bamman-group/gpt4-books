<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Margaret	Like there was a fence around it, [MASK] thought. But now there was this little man, grey-haired, with a tiny mustache, chair tipped back against the wall, playing his banjo. He was singing too, very softly, an old blues.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Margaret	That for the back door. Didn’t seem to be none for the front.” I looked at the key, an ordinary Yale key to the night lock on the kitchen door. "Where’s [MASK]?” "Been gone.” "Where?”
<name>John</name>	John	Oliver	Hastily, [MASK] drove the tractor back the way he had come. I followed, stopping only once to light the grass by the roadside cars. I scrambled up the Indian mound, panting, with the singing of gasoline-fed flames in my ears.
<name>Redbone</name>	Redbone	Freejacks	So these new freemen and their children for all the years after were called [MASK]. They were proud of their station and they kept apart from other Negroes. In the generations that followed they got themselves some Choctaw blood, and kept even more to themselves, taking on many of the Indian ways and customs.
<name>whoever</name>	whoever	John	She didn’t seem to hear. Maybe because she wouldn’t take any- thing from me, not even sympathy. "Let him be,” she said after [MASK]. "He hasn’t got a coat,” I said, "and it’s cold.”
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Nina	We walked on the carefully placed stepping stones through the side yard, past the thick hydrangeas with their heavy sagging blue flowerheads. We came around the house and cut across the front lawn. [MASK]’s husband saw us coming and he opened the door and stepped out to meet us.
<name>unavailable</name>	unavailable	Catholic	Her family nearly went out of their minds. They were [MASK]—and very serious about it—so the whole thing was a horrible sin. They tried to get to the girl, but she was of age and had gone off to a Florida track somewhere
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	John	"You didn’t tell me.” He grinned again. "If you’re having long passionate love calls, I thought I’d let the opposition gather my divorce evidence for me.” "Oh [MASK], you should have. I might have said something.”
<name>Phoenix</name>	Phoenix	Margaret	Her bare yellow-soled feet had shaken apart during the paroxysm of coughing. Now she brought them together again and placed them properly, heels together, toes with their nails like yellow horns pointing slightly out. [MASK] waited. "Made it,” the old woman said.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	John	I didn’t even hear [MASK] come in; he had to shake me. For a moment, muddled and drunk with sleep, I smiled at his familiar shape. Then his cold grim face came into focus, I remem- bered and sat up. He had a newspaper.
<name>ponies</name>	ponies	Oliver	I sent them down to the barns to amuse themselves with [MASK]. I could see them riding their ponies in the near pasture lots, clumsy figures on fat clumsy ponies. The phone rang. "I’m not home,” I told the butler.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Margaret	But every morning I drove into town to school—barely two miles by the direct road, but nearly five the way a car had to go, keeping to the best of the graded roads. It took me almost as long as it did [MASK] and her children.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	William	As they dumped their greens on the porch on the shady side of the house and fetched buckets of water to pour over them, [MASK] noticed some poison ivy in the lot. He said nothing, wondering idly if his sister was susceptible.
<name>Ma Joad</name>	Ma Joad	William	"Take you time,” [MASK] said, "don’t fret.” So she sat in the kitchen alone, eating quietly. She listened to the voices of the men outside, and then she heard the trace chains clank as the wagon moved.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Oliver	"I kind of feel like I’m being watched.” "You’d make a hunter,” [MASK] said briefly. "There’s eyes there.” "Who?” "People.” "They won’t bother the children?” He snorted.
<name>the man</name>	the man	John	I studied myself in the car mirror. I didn’t look different. I always looked this way. I had the sort of face nobody remembered an hour after seeing it. (They remembered [MASK], of course: he was dark and thin and striking.
<name>The man</name>	The man	Oliver	No answer. I called the state police, and told them that I thought there was trouble. [MASK] was still standing there, silently. I asked him: "You think they’ll come?” He didn’t answer and he didn’t have to.
<name>the baby</name>	the baby	Nina	I went straight to the bar in the comer of the living room. I plunked the baby down on the rug without a word and poured myself a stiff drink. He watched me, too amazed even to cry. I soon forgot about [MASK].
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	John	"[MASK],” I said, "what do you really think about the Negroes? Not what you’re going to say tonight, but what you really think?” He chuckled and swerved around a stock truck with a blast of his horn. "
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Margaret	"Not me,” I said, "not me.” "Well,” he said, "you need a cup of coffee. Come inside and we’ll see what [MASK]’s got.” I spent four blurred vague years at college.
<name>Orpheus</name>	Orpheus	Margaret	"Stay away for good like [MASK]’s children?” His eyes didn’t even flicker. "No,” he said, “you can come back. ... You can but you might not want to, someday.” I hugged him then, because I was sorry
<name>stonecutter</name>	stonecutter	Margaret	A wedding picture for a grave__ It would be over there, the east corner, [MASK] thought. I don’t have to see, I know it’s there, with the name and date scratched under it.... But nobody does that any more.
<name>Rainsford</name>	Rainsford	William	On the far side of the lake a black panther emerged from the tangled green of a hummock and padded lazily down to the water. That was upwind, a good quarter mile away, [MASK] noticed, so the animal was not aware of him.
<name>John</name>	John	Oliver	We went out the back door, across the half-lighted yard. There was a little scufHing and a clank of metal as [MASK] cleared the tractor. "I’ll leave the children up by the spring,” I told him as we passed.
<name>Uncle Axel</name>	Uncle Axel	William	“Your aunt,” [MASK] said, "knows a great many things.” He was annoyed. He had never been able to get on with her, not from the days when they were children together. It was something about her voice.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Abigail	[MASK] tell you?” "I don’t believe she did.” "Expect she was scared to. . . . Every man that’s come for the wedding’ll be there, blood and in-law and friend. I reckon you’ll see.”
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Yeats	[MASK] for reciting aloud. She sat looking out at the screening wisteria and the glittering day beyond and she would say to the soft greenness: The wind blows out of the gates of the day The wind blows over the lonely of heart And the lonely of heart is withered away.
<name>Grandfather</name>	Grandfather	John	"You’re right,” I said slowly. "But I don’t think I like that.” My grandfather had treated me the same way; but then I was a child. [MASK] shrugged. "Why tell you things I know will upset you?
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	William	It had one line: "You can come back now. P.S. Give this child a nickel.” [MASK] left his dirty quiet room, which was getting rather chilly at night, and went back to his house. He was startled at the change.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	William	As the sun dropped, a cloud of biting gnats rose from the grasses—the saw grass and the oyster grass, and the duck grass— until the sky was dark with them. [MASK] felt his whole body begin to tingle.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Margaret	They were singing a familiar hymn: "Will There Be Any Stars in My Crown.” They were singing more softly and they kept losing the melody in the noise of the mourners, but they just picked it up again and went on. [MASK] turned back to the kitchen.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Abby	I added: “They’ll be scared out of their wits up there, and [MASK] too proud to admit it.” He may have nodded in the dark but I didn’t see it. I only saw him walk off in the direction of the path that led to the spring.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Ramona	There were two rooms here, one leading into the other. They were musty and stuffy, and the mattresses on the beds had been rolled up and covered with newspapers. [MASK] put down the sheets and started for another door on the far wall. "
<name>Lady Bracknell</name>	Lady Bracknell	John	I couldn’t indeed. I didn’t know anything. "After all,” [MASK] said, "what does it matter if they know who we’re going to have dinner with—they could get that much out of the servants for a few bucks.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Forehead	So he must have had some warning of what was coming. He was still sitting there, hands on the wheel. [MASK] touching the knuckles of his hands. As if he were waiting for something. As if he had stopped and was waiting for something.
<name>My father</name>	My father	Margaret	I stand in the pitch darkness and listen to the sounds of voices that roar around in my head and watch the parade of figures that come and jostle for attention before my eyes. My grandfather. My mother. [MASK].
<name>he</name>	he	William	But maybe, [MASK] thought, they had several small stills scattered around among the hummocks. Smaller the still, sweeter the whiskey, he’d always heard. And too, he chuckled, the loss of one still wouldn’t put them out of business. . . .
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	William	She hadn’t seemed to mind perching uncomfortably on the edge of her world.... [MASK] forgot about her again as he concentrated on getting the skiff out into the river, and safely across, avoiding the snags and the sand bars, and keeping a special watch out for whirlpools.
<name>Mrs. Frazier</name>	Mrs. Frazier	William	If you can stand having her in the house.” "I’ve stood her my whole life,” [MASK] said to the horse’s back. "I can manage a bit more.” "Well, that’s all there is to it. Really.”
<name>Mrs. May</name>	Mrs. May	Margaret	The hoods dropped and opened. "Old woman,” [MASK] began. But she forgot the rest and lost interest and instead of standing and trying to remember what it was she had been thinking to say, she turned and went inside.
<name>The boy</name>	The boy	Margaret	She dipped in her arm, groping for the bottom, found none. She stood up, dragged over the fallen branch of a magnolia and thrust it down, pushing against the little current. It did not touch. [MASK] pulled it out, tossed it aside.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Margaret	[MASK] didn’t answer, didn’t seem to hear it. So we didn’t answer it either. It would have been like interrupting a funeral. All the doors of the house were open in spite of the cold and her singing followed us out to the car.
<name>The land</name>	The land	Howlands	It would belong to my children. It would come to them the way it had come to me. [MASK] were not run out, nor burned out. "You didn’t think I could do it,” I said, looking around in the dark for my grandfather.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Margaret	[MASK] was eleven or so before she dared ask about her father. She was afraid. She saw how the other people deferred to her, how they pretended she wasn’t there. But in the end, she got up her courage, and her great-grandmother told her all about it.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Willie	"For heaven’s sake, [MASK] . . . no.” "I saw some, all bound up with the others.” She gave him a quick smile, the sort of smile that he had not seen on her face since they had been very young children together.
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Margaret	But it didn’t last. I hadn’t seen too much of my mother since we’d moved back; even when she was living in the house with us, she was mostly lying down or reading in the summerhouse. It was [MASK] who took care of us.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Margaret	On the way over he told us that [MASK]’s children were going to stay with him. I don’t think he was very happy about that, he and his old-maid sister, with children in the house for the first time—but there wasn’t anybody else.
<name>her brother</name>	her brother	Robert	She was also the bright- est, a lot brighter than [MASK], though everybody encouraged him more. She’d learned to read from the old magazines my grandfather gave her, and long before she was ready to go to school she was reading from my old story books.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	John	I hadn’t heard anything—it must have been while I was firing the cars. I thought of [MASK]’s orchids—the stiff ones and the soft climbing ones, all of them dying in the cold night air, their foliage and blossoms tattered by the glass slivers.
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Abigail	It wasn’t her fault that she was fat and old and a little dull. . .. Like me, he thought, just like me. "I don’t suppose those rooms’ll be opened now, until [MASK]’s children come to getting married.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Abby	Tell her I’ll let her know when I want her back.” [MASK] trotted off. I looked at her thin legs under their faded blue jeans, and I thought mechanically: they must have some proper riding clothes.... She came back, saying: "She was glad to go.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sam	"I haven’t seen it,” I said, "the papers here haven’t carried it.” "I would think not,” [MASK] said. "Did your grandfather own the papers too?” "You know better.”
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Nina	Her face emptied out, like a glass, quickly and smoothly. "I know she did.” "Who could have told her that? ... Who’d be so mean?... But come inside. I’ll take the baby.” [MASK] shook her head.
<name>Amasa</name>	Amasa	William	She knelt at the side of the creek, just above the baptistry, washing clothes. Her dress was brown, her hair black as her skin. Only a flash of bright yellow from the material in her hand caught [MASK]’s eye. She had not heard him.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Oliver	Six, seven years ago.” So that was how long ago my grandfather had given it to her. [MASK] had known; he’d told me the truth. "Well,” I said, "tell her if she needs anything let me know.”
<name>Mrs. Avery</name>	Mrs. Avery	Margaret	"No,” he said, "I reckon you can’t.” "What does [MASK] think with all her kids gone?” He was looking at me levelly, the bright blue eyes light and clear. "Our kids,” he said quietly.
<name>Grandfather</name>	Grandfather	Margaret	So it was only by accident I saw something one day. That was one of the times I had not come down to supper. [MASK] knocked on my door and I yelled that I was busy writing poetry and couldn’t possibly stop. (My grandfather never argued.)
<name>empty</name>	empty	Greek	She stood smiling at me eagerly; she was very beautiful. She looked—somehow—[MASK]. I blurted the first thing I thought: "Your mother said you were dead.” Her face emptied out, like a glass, quickly and smoothly.
<name>Devil's</name>	Devil's	Death	Lots of plates. Most of these stood on two-inch-high spires of sandy mud, jutting out like mushrooms from the grave. The rain had given them that form, and the plates that sat on that thin rain-carved stem were called [MASK]’s Cups.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Oliver	I looked back once—I couldn’t see the house itself, but I could see the glow in the sky from the burning barn beyond it. I didn’t look again. [MASK] stopped by the first of the cars parked on the road.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Oliver	I thought about it afterwards and I began to wonder if maybe there wasn’t always a rat in the spring and if that wasn’t the carving [MASK] made. "That a rat?” I asked him the next time we went for a drive.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	John	It was the Eastman-Halsey tract, I was three-quarters of the way home. I closed the window again, still puzzled by the distance I had come. I really should have looked at the speedometer. [MASK] would be furious if he ever found out.
<name>Pa</name>	Pa	John	I was getting ready for bed—[MASK] was out again. The state legislature was in session and he had gone to the capital. I had a nasty cold—I was fixing a hot toddy when the phone rang. "
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Margaret	He had knocked almost all the lower planks out of those walls and tied them securely to the rafters. The flood water would flow directly through—across the dirt floor—and unless some very large object smashed into it, the building would stand. [MASK] watched him finish and turn to leave.
<name>John</name>	John	Robert	[MASK] jumped and glanced toward the sound. "I’m not saying I will do that,” I told him, "I am only saying that I could, if I wanted to. I haven’t made up my mind yet.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Harry	"No,” he said, slowly. "We’ll keep her in bed for a few days or a week.” "Hey,” I said. "In your room, then, missy.” My grandfather chuckled again. "Have some supper, [MASK].”
<name>John</name>	John	William	A change of scene would be so good for you,” she always said. [MASK] always answered her letters politely, though he hated to write and even his account books were trouble for him. Year after year he explained patiently why he could not come.
<name>Scobie</name>	Scobie	Margaret	There was a second cry, the long descending wail of mourning. The old woman was dead. [MASK] settled back. No need to go in, just an old woman who had died, worn out with the revolving years. No need at all. . . .
<name>owls</name>	owls	Egrets	[MASK] and herons and starlings and robins rose up screeching and frightened. Even the great noisy black bird that people called the Lord God Bird sailed up from the top of a peaked cypress tree. "Hey,” he called again. "It’s Will Howland.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	William	[MASK] could hear her moving about, and he folded his arms under his head and stretched contentedly. She came finally, closing the door behind her, stopping at the dresser to take the last of the pins from her hair, and do its regular brushing.
<name>Granny</name>	Granny	Rufus	"I took it off just the way it come in,” [MASK] said, miffed. Most of the message was not understandable, but the meaning was clear—the wedding had her approval and she was delighted.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Margaret	She was grown now herself. She was seventeen. Most girls that age were married. Lots of them had a child or two. They wouldn’t be crying over a mama. [MASK] looked out across the misty pasture where a single black-and-white cow grazed.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Margaret	How horrid it looks. I kept staring at it, wrinkling my lips; I almost didn’t notice [MASK], who had jumped up and was dialing quickly at the wall phone. While it rang, she turned to me. "You feel anything?”
<name>McCandless</name>	McCandless	William	[MASK] followed it. When he thought he’d gone far enough he cut back to the stream. He was now well above the baptistry. He drank and hung his head in the cold water, until the ache and weariness of the past day and night were gone.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Margaret	"We shouldn’t have come.” "[MASK] didn’t ask you to come. Nobody sent for you.” They would call me a white bigot. Let them, I thought. To hell with them and all their problems. I marched back into the yard.
<name>the midwife</name>	the midwife	Margaret	But it was the blood-smeared ammonia-smelling bit of flesh I had delivered. We crouched, the two of us, until delivery was finished. Then [MASK] helped me back into bed. I forgot about the baby and I fell asleep.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	William	"I heard of him,” [MASK] said. "You his daughter?” "Granddaughter.” He smiled at her quick correction. "I reckon you don’t look old enough to be much else.” "I’m eighteen,” she said.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Margaret	The black skin helped, of course—its color looked so silent, so impenetrable. It hid the blood and bone under it. "He’ll come back with pneumonia.” "He respected him,” [MASK] said quietly. "Let him grieve.”
<name>Ikemefuna</name>	Ikemefuna	Johnny	"I’ll take him.” She rolled the blankets tight as she could and I tucked them under my arm. [MASK] clambered on her back, and clung there, arms and legs wrapped around her, his sleepy black head dangling on her left shoulder.
<name>Mr. Watson</name>	Mr. Watson	John	"Have you noticed anything amiss?” "No. I don’t think so.” "Any calls?” "There are always lots of calls, [MASK].” "Anything you’d notice?” "You mean crank calls, or threats?”
<name>Nana</name>	Nana	Julia	The whole staff was staying away. They expected trouble. . .. I put on the kettle for coffee, and used the house phone to call the children’s nurse, [MASK]. She would be frightened when she saw the empty house; I had to explain.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	John	I allowed myself a chuckle. Things really were funny if you looked at them right. "Child of my heart,” I told him, "you have really done it this time. You got rid of [MASK] and got something ten times worse_____”
<name>Miss Kilman</name>	Miss Kilman	William	"Isn’t it lovely? I know you thought you’d never get me off your hands.” "No,” [MASK] said, "I can’t say I was bothered about that.” "Not being pretty... it worries a girl.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Margaret	I remember that night, even now. I always think of it as the end of the happy times. And in a way it was—though there were some quiet months left to us. Once I saw the boy who had brought me the first message from [MASK].
<name>Mae</name>	Mae	Abby	I be up to the house, when I get finished.” The sun went down and the early winter dark began in the hollows and slipped up the hill. [MASK] kept the children amused and quiet and only now and then I’d feel her large blue eyes watching me.
<name>Pa</name>	Pa	Oliver	"They mostly always come down to the fence at dusk,” she said, and her large eyes blinked a few times. So they were killing the animals. I glanced at [MASK]. "I ain’t had time to move nothing, excepting the dairy cows.
<name>Huckleberry</name>	Huckleberry	William	"Just to make it come out right,” [MASK] said, "if I ain’t been seen for a couple of days I’ll be in the swamp. If it’s more than four, I’m in trouble.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	William	[MASK] came home the very next day, over his sister’s squeals of protest. That single day had been enough. He had not recognized the city. A few landmarks were vaguely familiar, but distorted in a new setting.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	John	We parked in back of the office that had been [MASK]’s and was now mine. Funny, I couldn’t seem to remember that it belonged to me alone now. I was free, but I didn’t feel so.... The morning was crisp and cool.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Ramona	Then [MASK] tucked the lot under her arm and opened the low small door. It led to the ell at the back of the house, directly over the kitchen. It must have been the oldest part, for the rooms were smaller and the ceilings lower.
<name>Breath</name>	Breath	Congo	[MASK], some people called them, because they were black. She had always thought of her body as solid, one piece. Now she knew it was otherwise. She was black outside, but inside there was her father’s blood. She thought about this carefully.
<name>Laura</name>	Laura	Nina	"Of course I can. I was just surprised. After all these years, both of you turn up.” "Who else?” "[MASK].” "What did she want?” "Don’t you know? Don’t you see her?”
<name>She</name>	She	Margaret	He looked away. Other bodies slipped between them, people moved about, and he disappeared. [MASK] began to breathe again. But now the air in the room had gotten too hot for her, it was too full of the smell of whiskey-laden breaths.
<name>Clarisse</name>	Clarisse	Margaret	Heavy and slow like a giant dying. Creaky and thin like the turning of a wheel. It seemed to [MASK] that the room rocked and echoed and shook with the noise. How did I sleep before, she thought, and I couldn’t now....
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Will	"Hard trip?” "I believe so.” There were dozens of people getting off the train, milling about on the small platform. "[MASK],” they called to him, "here we are!”
<name>moving</name>	moving	Oliver	Work really started the day before when the knives, the two-sided slaughtering knives, were honed on the back porch. By then the hogs had been brought to the slaughter pen; they hadn’t eaten for two days, but they kept [MASK] and a couple of boys busy filling the water troughs.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Abigail	He stopped in front of the hall table and studied its great silver bowl, glistening dully in the light. With his finger he touched the tracing of grapes and leaves on the top edge. "Where’d this come from?” [MASK] giggled delightedly. "
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Oliver	The front door was locked. I went to the back. That was locked too. I knocked and waited. [MASK] came plodding slowly up from the barns: he had seen my car. He handed me a key. "That for the back door.
<name>her</name> (Note: There is no proper name that fits the description in this passage. The [MASK] token refers to a person's mother, who is being described as intangible but all-present.)	her (Note: There is no proper name that fits the description in this passage. The [MASK] token refers to a person's mother, who is being described as intangible but all-present.)	Margaret	There was nothing of hers you could put your finger on and say: that came from [MASK]. She was everywhere, in his face, in his movements, intangible but all-present, as much as her blood running in his veins.
<name>Claudia</name>	Claudia	Margaret	Her mother ought to have taken another man and forgot the whole thing. After all, she had nothing to stop her. No other blood in her veins. [MASK] looked down at her own hand, at the black skin with the white blood under it.
