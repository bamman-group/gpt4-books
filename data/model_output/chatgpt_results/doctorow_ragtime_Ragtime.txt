<name>Eric</name>	Eric	Tateh	I've been a socialist all my life, [MASK] assured her. Of course, the woman said. A doctor will listen to her chest. For that alone it's worthwhile. She'll eat hot meals and know her father has friends in the world.
<name>Houdini</name>	Houdini	Houdini	Suddenly he collapsed in a heap. There were exclamations of disbelief followed by prolonged applause. His assistants helped him to a chair. [MASK] asked for a glass of wine to restore his strength. He held the wine up in the spotlight. It turned colorless.
<name>Houdini</name>	Houdini	Houdini	[MASK] was to tell no one of this strange confrontation. He went through the celebrations of his jailhouse feat in an uncharacteristically quiet, even subdued manner. Not even the lines at the box office following the stories in the evening papers could cheer him up.
<name>Capone</name>	Capone	Whitman	You couldn't get a knife blade between the stones. The place was wired for dynamite and a pair of watchful coon eyes looked out of every window. [MASK] now had the good sense to ask for ideas from the police officers in the room.
<name>Diego</name>	Diego	Tateh	But the man in charge told him they were not right. We don't want art, the man said. We want something to stir the anger. We want to keep the fires stoked. [MASK] had drawn pickets, stark figures with their feet in snow.
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Walker	[MASK] decided to put the Ford into reverse gear, back up to the corner and go another way. He turned in his seat. At this moment two of the firemen carrying a twenty-foot ladder between them came into the street behind the car.
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Grandfather	He hired the man who had been the part-time gardener and installed him in the rooms above the garage stable. [MASK] already had a registered nurse to tend him in the day. The house, under siege, now bustled like a wartime camp.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Sarah	The laundress held [MASK]'s child. The station on the inside was so vast that although it was filled with people their voices were no more than a murmur. The boy gazed at the roof, an exposition of corrugated green glass vaults and arches supported by steel ribs and needlelike steel columns.
<name>Walker</name>	Walker	Walker	An old sergeant with many years on the street, a veteran of Hell's Kitchen and the Tenderloin, said The crucial thing, sir, is to get this Coalhouse [MASK] engaged in conversation. With an armed maniac, talking calms him down.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Houdini	[MASK] stormed out the door. Crystal light dazzled his eyes. He was in the grand ballroom of the doge palace. A string orchestra played from a balcony. Great pale red drapes framed the clerestory windows and four hundred people were waltzing on a marble floor.
<name>Queequeg</name>	Queequeg	Business	Nothing more had been heard from the black killer. [MASK] was holding up as he would know from the copies of the orders sent out to him every day. None of this put him at ease. He was becoming bored by the beach and no longer cared to bathe in the ocean.
<name>Hank</name>	Hank	Frick	They took the gun. He had a knife. He stabbed [MASK] in the leg. They took the knife. He put something in his mouth. They pinned him to the ground. They pried open his jaws. It was a capsule of fulminate of mercury.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Conklin	[MASK] smelled of whiskey and the experience of being a hunted man had turned his florid face the color of veal. He was by turn bombastic and craven. He offered counsel of the same level of wisdom that had triggered the crisis in the first place.
<name>Mr. James</name>	Mr. James	Morgan	Very quickly the butler's silver plate filled with cards. For several weeks [MASK] received counts and dukes and other aristocrats. They arrived with pieces that had been in their families for generations. Some of them were impoverished, others merely wished to convert their assets.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Morgan	He was a man of homespun tastes but was not at all put off by what he recognized as an empire different only in style from his own. [MASK] brought him to the great West Room of the Library. Here they took chairs on opposite sides of a fireplace that was as tall as a man.
<name>She</name>	She	Evelyn	And grasping the hand of the little girl in the pinafore, he disappeared into the crowd. [MASK] stood staring after them. It seemed to her that the light was racing away from her eyes. Her hand went out for something to hold.
<name>Oscar</name>	Oscar	Goldman	We know, don't we, both of us, what it means to have a man in jail. The two women looked at each other. There was silence for some moments. Of course, your man is a pervert, a parasite, a leech, a foul loathsome sybarite, [MASK] said.
<name>Morgan</name>	Morgan	Whitman	A patrolman was found and dispatched through the garden that separated the Library from the Morgan residence. [MASK] and the other officials waited in the improvised headquarters. No sooner had the officer entered the garden than the sky flashed and there was a loud report followed by an agonized scream.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Sarah	Her hair was bound, she was groomed and smiling and neat. She embraced him and said Look, I have something to show you. Her face was radiant. She stepped aside and walking down the hall, holding the hand of the housemaid, was [MASK]'s child in his nightshirt.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Goldman	The truth is, [MASK] went on quickly, women may not vote, they may not love whom they want, they may not develop their minds and their spirits, they may not commit their lives to the spiritual adventure of life, comrades they may not!
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Houdini	[MASK] climbed into the pilot's seat, turned his cap backwards and pulled it down tight. He clutched the wheel. His eyes narrowed in concentration, he set his jaw firmly and he turned his head and nodded to the mechanic, who spun the wood propeller.
<name>John</name>	John	Morgan	The two men stared at each other. [MASK] sat back in his chair. The blood drained from his face and his eyes lost their fierce light. When he spoke, it was with the weak voice of an old man.
<name>Thomas Edison</name>	Thomas Edison	Edison	He was working on an invention so secret that there was frequent speculation in the press as to what it might be. One news story came out claiming the new invention was something called a vacuum tube by which [MASK] hoped to receive messages from dead people.
<name>Mr. Norton</name>	Mr. Norton	Coalhouse	He had expected to find dozens of colored men but saw only three or four youths standing each beside a window with a rifle in his hands. [MASK] stood waiting upon him in a well-pressed hound's-tooth suit and a tie and collar, although he carried a pistol in his belt.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Goldman	She wept into the towel. After all, [MASK] went on, you're nothing more than a clever prostitute. You accepted the conditions in which you found yourself and you triumphed. But what kind of a victory has it been? The victory of the prostitute.
<name>Anastasia</name>	Anastasia	Goldman	It turned out that in his vigil he had been mistaken for a police spy. He was treated with elaborate irony. He was offered tea. Numbers of people were standing about in the apartment in their hats and coats. Then [MASK] appeared in a doorway and her attention was directed to him.
<name>someone</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	someone (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	Goldman	In the heat and constant excitement rising from the audience she allowed her shawl to drop to her shoulders. There were perhaps a hundred people present, all sitting on benches or standing along the walls while [MASK] spoke from behind a table at the end of the room.
<name>Dr. Urbino</name>	Dr. Urbino	Grandfather	He had treated [MASK] with the arrogant courtesy one gives to the senile even before the condition had set in. From Younger Brother he was completely estranged. Toward his wife he felt drastically slipped in her estimation, an explorer in body only, the spirit trapped in his own father's prejudices.
<name>George</name>	George	Tateh	When the train arrived the two refugees found a bench in the station and spent the night there. [MASK] was not entirely himself. He had in his pockets, fortunately, that part of his week's wages he had set aside for the rent: two dollars and fifty cents.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Walker	The more he thought about this the more true it seemed. [MASK] didn't act or talk like a colored man. He seemed to be able to transform the customary deferences practiced by his race so that they reflected to his own dignity rather than the recipient's.
<name>Evelyn</name>	Evelyn	Evelyn	Most of these are today in private collections. [MASK] came nearly every afternoon and stayed for as long as she could. She dressed down to be as inconspicuous as possible. Following a Thaw practice she paid great sums of money to the chauffeur to keep him quiet.
<name>Lindbergh</name>	Lindbergh	Houdini	He was tremendously proud of his aeroplane. He wanted to make flying history. Young officers from the local casern began to come to the parade grounds to watch [MASK] fly! He got to know some of them by name.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Peary	Waiting for [MASK] to return to the Roosevelt he had heard the wind howl at night and had clasped with love and gratitude the foul body, like a stinking fish, of an Esquimo woman. He had put his body into the stinking fish.
<name>Harvey Dent</name>	Harvey Dent	Whitman	This took the form of a vigil in the street. District Attorney [MASK] granted his permission even though the report brought back from the Library was grim enough to cause him to order an evacuation of every house and apartment within a two-block radius.
<name>Jay Gatsby</name>	Jay Gatsby	Ford	Cigars were offered. [MASK] refused. He noticed the ceiling was gilded. The walls were covered in red silk damask. There were fancy paintings hanging behind glass in heavy frames—pictures of yellowish soulful-looking people with golden haloes.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Willie	[MASK], the policeman said to the Fire Chief, did you or your boys do any desecratin? I'll tell you exactly what happened, the Chief said. The nigger here parked his damn car in the middle of the road right in front of the firehouse.
<name>the boy</name>	the boy	Tateh	His hand was in his mother's hand and as he passed the little girl standing with her ancient father, the boy's eyes looked into hers. At this moment the Post Road streetcar appeared and [MASK] holding the little girl firmly by the wrist walked into the street and stepped aboard.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Washington	This fellow now turned to look over his shoulder at [MASK] and the great educator drew in his breath sharply as he saw it was not a Negro but a white in blackface, as if this were some minstrel show.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Houdini	Then he stood up and dramatically cast off his wig of waved gray hair and announced who he was. He accrued lawsuits by the dozens. [MASK] realized he was now raised to his assigned height. The breeze up here was somewhat stronger. He felt himself revolving.
<name>Godfrey</name>	Godfrey	Sarah	She was affectionate to her son, her husband, her invalid father; she was affectionate to her Negro woman and most of all to the still-unchristened and beautiful son of [MASK], who was thriving here and seemed to be growing visibly.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Houdini	It was nailed shut and tied with a stout rope. No drape was set up in front of the packing case. It was pried open. It was empty. A collective gasp went up from the audience as [MASK] was seen running into the theatre from the lobby.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Morgan	[MASK] would not sleep that night. This was the King's Chamber, long since emptied of its furnishings. The earth was so damp that its chill permeated the wool blanket he had brought to sit upon. He had his monogramed gold box of safety matches but refused as a matter of principle to light one.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Walker	This is a public thoroughfare, [MASK] said. I've traveled it dozens of times and no one has ever said anything about a toll. He got up behind the wheel. Tell the Chief, one of the men said to another.
<name>Officer</name>	Officer	Coalhouse	Listen, he said, we'll push your tin lizzie back on the road and you be on your way. There's no real damage. Scrape off the shit and forget the whole thing. I was on my way when they stopped me, [MASK] said.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Morgan	The pennant? [MASK] said. The pennant? Running toward him was a squat ugly man in pin-striped knee pants and a ribbed undershirt. His hand was outstretched. An absurd beanie was on his head. A cigar butt was in his mouth.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Whitman	[MASK] went pale. They've got the goddamn place mined, he said. An officer came in. From what anyone could tell, the patrolman in the garden was dead, which was his only bit of luck because nobody could have gone in to get him out of there.
<name>Lawrence</name>	Lawrence	Morgan	He permitted himself a drink of brandy. His limbs were stiff, his back ached and he had caught a chill. [MASK]'s aides came along with the Arab guides and he was helped back to the outside world. Surprisingly, the morning was well-advanced.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Evelyn	Yet as [MASK]'s eyes accustomed themselves to the darkness she perceived that the home was scrupulously clean. Her arrival had caused a storm of consternation in the old artist, who paced up and down in the candlelight and did not know what to do about her.
<name>Mrs. Whatsit</name>	Mrs. Whatsit	Goldman	It seemed to her that the light was racing away from her eyes. Her hand went out for something to hold. A now familiar voice said in her ear This way, come with me, and her arm was in the grip of [MASK] herself.
<name>Sebastian</name>	Sebastian	McKinley	[MASK] fell back. Blood dyed his vest. There were screams. When he left she hugged him at the door. Her lips, surprisingly soft, pressed his cheek. He was overcome. He stepped back. The literature under his arm fell to the floor.
<name>Ma Joad</name>	Ma Joad	Tateh	The car barreled along its tracks down the side of the road, and whenever it approached an intersection its air horn blew. Once it stopped and took on a load of produce. Riders crowded the aisle. The little girl could not wait for the speed to be up. [MASK] realized she was happy.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Harry	He would have made a joke out of it. That was his way. He was a lusty old fuck and he loved a good laugh. She could drive him out of his mind, just as she could drive [MASK] out of his.
<name>Einstein</name>	Einstein	Houdini	Physicists all over the world were discovering waves, the man told him. There was a tremendously important theory from abroad in which it was supposed matter and energy were but two aspects of the same primal force. That is my idea too, the man told [MASK].
<name>the sea</name>	the sea	Ovid	The old man was very thin and stooped, and he emitted a mildewed smell, possibly because he had few clothes and refused to buy or accept anything new. Also his eyes were constantly watering. But he would sit in the parlor and tell the boy stories from [MASK].
<name>BFG</name>	BFG	Houdini	She came to [MASK]'s knees. Her voice had deepened with age and she now spoke in the tones of a normal twenty-year-old girl. She had sparkling blue eyes, silver-white hair and the finest of wrinkles on her clear white skin.
<name>Blip</name>	Blip	Houdini	Police on horseback blew their whistles. Everything was upside down—the automobiles, the people, the sidewalks, the police on horseback, the buildings. The sky was at his feet. [MASK] rose past the baseball score-board attached to the side of the building.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tateh	[MASK] lifted his daughter bodily and swung her up on the platform of the nearest car, out of harm's way. Then he turned his attention to the fallen woman. He picked her up under the shoulders and dragged her through the crowd to a bench.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Houdini	At that moment [MASK] realized that across the vault of gloom the cell directly opposite was lighted and occupied. A prisoner sat there staring at him. The prisoner had a broad flat face with a porcine nose, a wide mouth, and eyes that seemed unnaturally bright and large.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Evelyn	Why do you have this child tied with a rope, [MASK] said. The old man gazed at her finery. He laughed and shook his head and talked to himself in Yiddish . He turned his back to her. A crowd had gathered when the car stopped.
<name>prominent</name>	prominent	Morgan	but he did not touch the wine. He finished before his host. He gazed frankly at the [MASK] nose. ]rle found a crumb on the tablecloth and deposited it in the saucer of his coffee cup. His fingers idly rubbed the gold plate.
<name>Malcolm</name>	Malcolm	Houdini	Despite such experiences [MASK] never developed what we think of as a political consciousness. He could not reason from his own hurt feelings. To the end he would be almost totally unaware of the design of his career, the great map of revolution laid out by his life.
<name>Jurgis</name>	Jurgis	Tateh	They had come there the previous autumn, having heard there were jobs. [MASK] stood in front of a loom for fifty-six hours a week. His pay was just under six dollars. The family lived in a wooden tenement on a hill. They had no heat.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Coalhouse	They mimicked [MASK]'s dress and so the suit and carefully brushed black derby was a kind of uniform. They came and went from their rooms like soldiers on patrol. At night they sat for hours and discussed their situ- ation and what it could lead to.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Evelyn	Her shrieks echoed down the corridors and stone stairwells. The German servants in their quarters listened, grew flushed, opened bottles of Goldwasser and copulated. Shocking red welts disfigured [MASK]'s flesh. She cried and whimpered all night.
<name>accent</name>	accent	Yiddish	The magician readily agreed. He arranged his schedule accordingly and began a series of informal sessions. He liked the young officers. They were highly intelligent and very respectful. They laughed at his jokes. His German was faulty and [MASK]-inflected but they seemed not to notice.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Coalhouse	The big policeman came to a decision. He took [MASK] aside. Listen, he said, we'll push your tin lizzie back on the road and you be on your way. There's no real damage. Scrape off the shit and forget the whole thing.
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Coalhouse	In the few weeks of her happiness, between that time she accepted [MASK]'s proposal and the first fears that her marriage would never happen, she had been transformed to the point of having a new, a different face. Grief and anger had been a kind of physical pathology masking her true looks.
<name>Mother Jones</name>	Mother Jones	Tateh	But the battle went on week after week. Relief committees had set up kitchens in every neighborhood. It's not charity, a woman told [MASK] when, after the child received her portion, he refused his. The bosses want you weak, therefore you have to be strong.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Evelyn	All he had to do was chew on the capsule and the room would have blown up and everyone in it. They held his head back. They removed the capsule. They beat him unconscious. [MASK] had sat up in bed, drawing her knees up to her chest.
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Coalhouse	We always talked before, one of them said. Now you doing this. You can't, man! We all [MASK]! We can't get out we'll blow it up, another said. Younger Brother said What you are doing is betraying us.
<name>Emmett</name>	Emmett	Sarah	As for my execution, he said, my death was determined the moment [MASK] died. As for my Godforsaken Ford it is to be made over as it was the day I drove past the firehouse. It is not I who reduce my demands but they who magnified them as long as they resisted them.
<name>Ellison</name>	Ellison	Washington	But I would hope this might suggest to you the solemn calculation of my mind. And that therefore, possibly, we might both be servants of our color who insist on the truth of our manhood and the respect it demands. [MASK] was so stunned by this suggestion that he began to lose consciousness.
<name>President McKinley</name>	President McKinley	Frick	I embraced him at the station. He planned to shoot [MASK] and take his own life at his trial. I ran after the departing train. We only had money for one ticket. He said only one person was needed for the job.
<name>Chang</name>	Chang	Coalhouse	One white face looks just like another. They all laughed. [MASK] embraced each of them before the great brass doors. He embraced Younger Brother with the same fervor he accorded the others. He looked at his pocket watch. At this moment the floodlights in the street went out.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Evelyn	she now asked. [MASK] nodded. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Look at me, even with my figure I have not one foundation garment, I wear everything loose and free-flowing, I give my body the freedom to breathe and to be.
<name>Pancho Villa</name>	Pancho Villa	Zapata	The capital seethed with proliferating factions, thieving bureaucrats and foreign businessmen and spies. Into this chaos rode [MASK]'s peasant army of the south. The city was hushed by their arrival. Their reputation was so fierce that the urban Mexicans feared them.
<name>Leopold</name>	Leopold	Becker	I can't give in to the coon. Even to hang him. I can't afford it. It would finish me. Goddamnit, I took care of that son of a bitch [MASK]. The crime of the century. That's what the papers called it.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Coalhouse	For them I want safe passage away from here and full and total amnesty. But stay here, please, until I have a chance to tell them. [MASK] rose from his chair and went out to talk to the young men in the hall.
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Coalhouse	They arrived the next morning and immediately set up their tents on the baseball field behind the high school. Children gathered to watch. Special editions of the local papers were published and each carried prominently the text of [MASK]'s second letter.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Whitman	That might get him. [MASK] agreed. Of course every one else on the East Side would die, too. He was beginning to feel fretful. The 273 Library was built of fitted marble blocks. You couldn't get a knife blade between the stones.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Conklin	[MASK] spoke to him differently from the way he addressed the policemen. His diction improved. His assumption of social equality was galling. It's a tragic thing. Captain, he would say. A tragic thing indeed.
<name>The narrator</name>	The narrator	Tateh	There was in these days of our history a highly developed system of interurban street railway lines. One could travel great distances on hard rush seats or wooden benches by taking each line to its terminus and transferring to the next. [MASK] did not know anything about the routes.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Willie	He wanted to go to the black neighborhood and clean all the niggers out once and for all. The officers heard this with disinterest. They teased him about his fate. We may have to give you to the boogie man, [MASK], they said.
<name>who</name>	who	Emma	He was a short, totally baldheaded man with thick eyeglasses, a large full mouth and a very sallow complexion with skin like wax. The issue has become [MASK]'s right to speak rather than what she has to say. All our energies go into defending ourselves.
<name>Captain Wolf Larsen</name>	Captain Wolf Larsen	Peary	[MASK] lived the most comfortably of all. He had a player piano in his stateroom. He was a large man with a heavy torso and thick red hair turning gray. He wore a long moustache. In a previous expedition he had lost his toes.
<name>Houdini</name>	Houdini	Houdini	Just call me [MASK], he said. An enterprising reporter decided to find the great magician and solicit a comment. He was that kind of reporter expert in the stupid and inconsequential news story so loved by the papers of the time.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Whitman	An officer came in. From what anyone could tell, the patrolman in the garden was dead, which was his only bit of luck because nobody could have gone in to get him out of there. The police officials were grim. They looked at [MASK].
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Tateh	A strike committee was formed with every one of the races represented and the message went out to the workers: no violence. Taking the girl with him [MASK] joined the thousands of pickets encircling the mill, a massive brick building that went on for blocks.
<name>Mrs. Ramsay</name>	Mrs. Ramsay	Sarah	When he arrived at the back door he gave it a stout rap and when admitted would solemnly greet everyone and somehow convey to them the feeling that they were [MASK]'s family, and that his courtesies to them simply measured the regard and respect he held for her.
<name>General Lee</name>	General Lee	Peary	Now the sun shone brightly, the sky was clear; there was a full moon in the blue sky and the great ice thighs of the earth heaved and shuddered and rose toward the moon. At midmorning of April 9, [MASK] called a halt.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Mameh	He didn't know what to do. He had a peddler's business. Never could he find a place at the curb that was profitable. While he was gone [MASK] sat by the window with her stack of cut cloth and pedaled the sewing machine.
<name>Marconi</name>	Marconi	Houdini	All he needed was to devise the properly sensitive instrument, and primal waves could be detected and decoded that nobody as yet knew anything about. [MASK] signed an agreement with him giving him two thousand dollars for the exclusive rights to his research.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Berkman	[MASK] got out only last year. His hair is gone. He is the color of parchment. My darling young man walks with a stoop. His eyes are like coal pits. We are friends in principle only. Our hearts no longer beat together.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Houdini	[MASK] had lately been feeling better about himself. His grief for his mother, his fears of losing his audience, his suspicions that his life was unimportant and his achievements laughable— all the weight of daily concern seemed easier to bear.
<name>Officer</name>	Officer	Houdini	The prisoner came up to the front of his cell and raising his arms in a shockingly obscene manner he thrust his hips forward and flapped his penis between the bars. [MASK] rushed down the promenade, fumblingly unlocked the cell-block door and closed it behind him.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Tateh	They turned and the wind blew their clothes against their backs. They turned and the wind blew their clothes against their chests and legs. They cut away from the water toward the boardwalk. [MASK]'s black hair, flattened over his forehead, shone in the bright water.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Tateh	She had seen him first at [MASK]'s corner, standing across the street and turning his eyes away when she challenged him with her gaze. She knew her mother-in-law employed private detectives but she decided he was too shy to be a detective.
<name>Lenin</name>	Lenin	Sacha	She gently removed the ladle from his hand. [MASK], my dear, she said to the sallow man, if first we have to teach them their own ideals, perhaps then we may teach them ours. The party went on into the early hours.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Tateh	He stuck out his lower lip. Let me try that, he said. An hour later [MASK] walked out of there with twenty-five dollars in cash and a letter of agreement which he had signed calling for four more books at twenty-five dollars each.
<name>Europe</name>	Europe	Life	He talked incessantly in his European accent, with malapropisms he himself recognized and laughed over. [MASK] excited him. He dwelled on his own sensations and liked to talk about them: the taste of the wine or the way the candle flames multiplied in the crystal chandeliers.
