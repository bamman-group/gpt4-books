<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Margaret	I would take a live dragon into my house to live, if, by hiring such a chaperon, and setting up an establishment of my own, I could make my old age happy with having [MASK] for a daughter. But there are those Lennoxes!'
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Henry	Well, [MASK]?' said she, with a look of interrogation. 'Well!' said he, rather shortly. 'Come in to lunch!' 'No, thank you, I can't. I've lost too much time here already.'
<name>Inspector</name>	Inspector	Watson	Take no further steps. I have not seen the coroner; but I will take the responsibility.' 'Well,' thought [MASK], 'it relieves me from an awkward job. None of my witnesses seemed certain of anything except the young woman.
<name>Napoleon</name>	Napoleon	Cromwell	I wish we had him to put down this strike for us.' '[MASK] is no hero of mine,' said she, coldly. 'But I am trying to reconcile your admiration of despotism with your respect for other men's independence of character.'
<name>Frederick</name>	Frederick	Frederick	'I will do anything, if you wish it, mamma,--but if--but when [MASK] comes---- ' 'Ah, to be sure! we must keep our doors shut,--we must let no one in. I hardly know whether I dare wish him to come or not.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Margaret	'No, papa,' said [MASK], sadly. 'Then, you see, she can't be fretting after them, eh? It has always been a comfort to me to think that your mother was so simple and open that I knew every little grievance she had.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Margaret	[MASK] was so unconscious of herself, and so much amused by watching other people, that she never thought whether she was left unnoticed or not. Somebody took her down to dinner; she did not catch the name; nor did he seem much inclined to talk to her.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Margaret	For he came home every evening more and more depressed, after the necessary leave-taking which he had resolved to have with every individual parishioner. [MASK], inexperienced as she was in all the necessary matter-of-fact business to be got through, did not know to whom to apply for advice.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Margaret	Speak to me!' The speculation came again into his eyes, and he made a great effort. '[MASK], did you know of this? Oh, it was cruel of you!' 'No, sir, it was not cruel!
<name>he</name>	he	Higgins	She and her father kept up an indifferent conversation until [MASK], scarcely aware whether he ate or not, had made a very substantial meal. Then he pushed his chair away from the table, and tried to take an interest in what they were saying;
<name>shadows</name>	shadows	shadows!--all	What a vain show Life seemed! How unsubstantial, and flickering, and flitting! It was as if from some aerial belfry, high up above the stir and jar of the earth, there was a bell continually tolling, 'All are [MASK] are passing!--all is past!'
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Margaret	[MASK] sat down by her mother, and took her unresisting head on her breast, bending her own soft cheeks down caressingly to touch her face. 'Dear, darling mamma! we were so afraid of giving you pain.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Margaret	I can pay a pretty long bill, if there is any chance of success. Money, dear father, that I had meant for a different purpose; so I shall only consider it as borrowed from you and [MASK].'
<name>Thornton</name>	Thornton	marcy	'To be sure. I knew he'd do it all long. It's no good expecting [MASK] at the hands o' them measters. Yo're a stranger and a foreigner, and aren't likely to know their ways; but I knowed it.'
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Margaret	[MASK] thought she had seen the face of one of them before, and returned him a proud look of offended dignity for his somewhat impertinent stare of undisguised admiration. She went hastily to her brother, who was standing outside, and took hold of his arm. '
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Margaret	And then, in tears, [MASK] left her, as she rushed up-stairs to throw herself on her bed, and hide her face in the pillows to stifle the hysteric sobs that would force their way at last, after the rigid self-control of the whole day.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Frederick	The strain had been terrible, as she now felt. But [MASK] was come! He, the one precious brother, was there, safe, amongst them again! She could hardly believe it. She stopped her crying, and opened her bedroom door.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Margaret	'Oh, mamma, let us do all we can,' said [MASK] eagerly, not seeing the prudential side of the question, only grasping at the idea that they were rendering such help for the last time; 'we may not be here long.'
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Margaret	The little casement window in [MASK]'s bed-chamber was almost filled up with rose and vine branches; but pushing them aside, and stretching a little out, she could see the tops of the parsonage chimneys above the trees; and distinguish many a well-known line through the leaves.
<name>Byron</name>	Byron	Fairfax	To parody a line out of [MASK]'s Tasso-- 'His strong idea wandered through her thought.' She disliked him the more for having mastered her inner will. How dared he say that he would love her still, even though she shook him off with contempt?
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Dixon	'Oh, wait a minute. I am overpowered by the discovery of my own genius for management. [MASK] is to have--let me see, I had it once--the back sitting-room. I think she will like that.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Margaret	She was thankful to see her father so much occupied with her mother as not to notice her looks. Even after her mother went to bed, he was not content to be absent from her, but undertook to read her to sleep. [MASK] was alone. '
<name>Millicent</name>	Millicent	Margaret	You are unfair and unjust.' [MASK] compressed her lips. She would not speak in answer to such accusations. But, for all that--for all his savage words, he could have thrown himself at her feet, and kissed the hem of her garment.
<name>Hannah</name>	Hannah	Dixon	I have every chance of a good night myself, and you are looking very pale with your watching. I shall call [MASK] if your mother needs anything. Do you go to bed and sleep like a top; for I'm sure you need it, poor child!'
<name>Higgins</name>	Higgins	Higgins	You're a pretty chap to come asking me for work. You don't want impudence, that's very clear.' 'I've getten enemies and backbiters, like my betters; but I ne'er heerd o' ony of them calling me o'er-modest,' said [MASK].
<name>Blackpool</name>	Blackpool	Thornton	He's as slippery as an eel, he is. He's like a cat,--as sleek, and cunning, and fierce. It'll never be an honest up and down fight wi' him, as it will be wi' [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Margaret	'Now, please, just stop here for a minute or two, said [MASK]. 'These are the cottages that haunted me so during the rainy fortnight, reproaching me for not having sketched them.' 'Before they tumbled down and were no more seen.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Margaret	The common sounds of life were more musical there than anywhere else in the whole world, the light more golden, the life more tranquil and full of dreamy delight. As [MASK] remembered her feelings yesterday, she said to herself: '
<name>Rosamond</name>	Rosamond	Margaret	[MASK]'s black hair was too thick to be plaited; it needed rather to be twisted round and round, and have its fine silkiness compressed into massive coils, that encircled her head like a crown, and then were gathered into a large spiral knot behind.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Margaret	I hope you will excuse me for doing what is only my duty, although it may appear impertinent.' [MASK] bowed her head as he went towards the door. Her lips were stiff and dry. She could not speak even the common words of farewell.
<name>Hannah</name>	Hannah	Jack	Thy lile [MASK] shall na' clem. I ha' getten brass, and we'll go buy the chap a sup o' milk an' a good four-pounder this very minute. What's mine's thine, sure enough, i' thou'st i' want.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Dixon	Then as to dress, and [MASK], and personal expenses, and confectionery (all young ladies eat confectionery till wisdom comes by age), I shall consult some lady of my acquaintance, and see how much you will have from your father before fixing this.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Edith	I shall be glad to have time to think, and I am sure [MASK] will.' 'I am not so sure about her; but I can fancy that you will. Whenever I have seen you lately, you have been carried away by a whirlwind of some other person's making.'
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Margaret	[MASK] was thankful that she received this letter while her father was absent in her mother's room. If he had been present, he would have expected her to read it aloud to him, and it would have raised in him a state of nervous alarm which she would have found it impossible to soothe away.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Frederick	On the contrary, all their intercourse was peculiarly charming to her from the very first. She knew then how much responsibility she had had to bear, from the exquisite sensation of relief which she felt in [MASK]'s presence.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Margaret	They said yo' were ill,--and butter me, but yo' dunnot look like th' same wench. And yo're going to be a grand lady up i' Lunnon, aren't yo'?' 'Not a grand lady,' said [MASK], half smiling.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Margaret	'No, you can't, [MASK]. No one can who did not see him then. I could hardly lift myself up to go and meet him--everything seemed so to reel around me all at once.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Dixon	She is not well, that is all. Many a one is not well for a time; and with good advice gets better and stronger than ever.' 'But has [MASK] said anything about her?' 'No!
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Margaret	I could not bear it, [MASK]. And a hundred a year would go a very little way, after the necessary wants of housekeeping are met, towards providing your mother with all the comforts she has been accustomed to, and ought to have.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Margaret	'I don't know. I never thought of anything of that kind,' said [MASK], reddening, and looking hurt and offended. 'And perhaps he never would, but for the lie,--which, under the circumstances, I maintain, was necessary.'
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Margaret	Oh! I'm glad we don't visit them. I don't like shoppy people. I think we are far better off, knowing only cottagers and labourers, and people without pretence.' 'You must not be so fastidious, [MASK], dear!'
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Margaret	[MASK] was lighting the lamp when he entered, for the darkness was coming on. The lamp threw a pretty light into the centre of the dusky room, from which, with country habits, they did not exclude the night-skies, and the outer darkness of air.
<name>Thornton</name>	Thornton	Slickson	I believe it's [MASK]'s doing,--confound him and his dodges! He thought he was overstocked; so he seemed to yield at first, when the deputation came to him,--and of course, he only confirmed them in their folly, as he meant to do.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Fanny	You would not have approved of [MASK]'s being seen out, after dark, in rather a lonely place, walking about with a young man. I say nothing of the taste which could choose the time, when her mother lay unburied, for such a promenade.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	John	To-morrow, you will---- Come back to-night, [MASK]!' She had seldom pleaded with her son at all--she was too proud for that: but she had never pleaded in vain. 'I will return straight here after I have done my business.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Margaret	He was with mamma when she died,' said [MASK], softly. 'To be sure! To be sure! Why, some one asked me if he had not been over then, and I denied it stoutly--not many weeks ago--who could it have been?
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Martha	'When can we hear from him?' 'Not for a week yet, certainly,--perhaps more.' 'We must send [MASK] away in good time. It would never do to have her here when he comes, and then send her off in a hurry.'
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Nicholas	Ay, an' chase yo' through heaven wi' my hatred,--I will, lad! I will,--if yo're leading me astray i' this matter. Thou saidst, [MASK], on Wednesday sennight--and it's now Tuesday i' th' second week--that afore a fortnight
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Margaret	But what in five minutes? Can you do nothing to soothe these poor creatures? It is awful to see them.' 'The soldiers will be here directly, and that will bring them to reason.' 'To reason!' said [MASK], quickly. '
<name>Alroy</name>	Alroy	Bessy	But for a minute or two she did not speak. At last she said in a low voice, '[MASK], do you wish to die?' For she shrank from death herself, with all the clinging to life so natural to the young and healthy.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Margaret	He's not an infidel, [MASK]; how could you say so?' muttered he reproachfully 'I've a good mind to read him the fourteenth chapter of Job.' 'Not yet, papa, I think. Perhaps not at all.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Margaret	[MASK] was proud of her father; she had always a fresh and tender pride in seeing how favourably he impressed every stranger; still her quick eye sought over his face and found there traces of some unusual disturbance, which was only put aside, not cleared away.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Margaret	He could almost pity her. What would be the end of it? She could not have considered all she was entering upon; if there was an inquest and the young man came forward. Suddenly he started up. There should be no inquest. He would save [MASK].
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Boucher	Don't you see how you've made [MASK] what he is, by driving him into the Union against his will--without his heart going with it. You have made him what he is!' Made him what he is! What was he?
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Margaret	He's fairly knocked down in his mind by it. It's no use telling him, fools will always break out o' bounds. Yo' never saw a man so down-hearted as he is.' 'But why?' asked [MASK]. '
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Margaret	He was so steady at his work, that [MASK] did not often see him during these winter months; but when she did, she saw that he winced away from any reference to the father of those children, whom he had so fully and heartily taken under his care.
<name>Fan</name>	Fan	Fanny	She will be able to suggest something, perhaps--won't you, Fan?' 'I have not always an ailment,' said [MASK], pettishly; 'and I am not going with mamma. I have a headache to-day, and I shan't go out.'
<name>John</name>	John	Margaret	She never would conceal anything seriously affecting her health from me: would she, eh, [MASK]? I am quite sure she would not. So don't let me hear of these foolish morbid ideas. Come, give me a kiss, and run off to bed.'
<name>Spenser</name>	Spenser	SPENSER	she was very weak; and her mind sought for some present fact to steady itself upon, and keep it from utterly losing consciousness in another hideous, sickly swoon. CHAPTER XXIII MISTAKES 'Which when his mother saw, she in her mind Was troubled sore, ne wist well what to ween.' [MASK].
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Fanny	'[MASK]!' said her mother, as they drove away, 'we will be civil to these Hales: but don't form one of your hasty friendships with the daughter. She will do you no good, I see.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Dolores	People know what you did; but not the motives that elevate it out of a crime into an heroic protection of the weak. For [MASK]' sake, they ought to know.' 'But how must I make them know?
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Margaret	It seemed cruel to refuse him the comfort he craved for. And besides, his passionate refusal to admit the existence of fear, almost inspired [MASK] herself with hope. 'I do think she is better since last night,' said she. '
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Bessy	Nor I of myself. Good-bye!' [MASK] stilled her rocking to gaze after her. 'I wonder if there are many folk like her down South. She's like a breath of country air, somehow. She freshens me up above a bit.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Bessy	She saw it in dreams more vivid than life, and as she fell away to slumber at nights her memory wandered in all its pleasant places. But her heart was opened to this girl; 'Oh, [MASK], I loved the home we have left so dearly!
<name>Marian</name>	Marian	Margaret	He came at last, his arms hanging loose down, his head sunk, and walking heavily along, as if every step was a labour and a trouble. [MASK], I see him now.' 'Don't go on, mamma.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Margaret	I say it's no wonder to me that there are no longer any saints on earth---- ' 'Oh, [MASK]! here you are! I have been so wanting you. But how your cheeks are flushed with the heat, poor child!
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Margaret	[MASK] tried to make acquaintances with one or two of them, while her father strove to raise the widow's thoughts into some higher channel than that of mere helpless querulousness. She found that the children were truer and simpler mourners than the widow.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Dixon	She knew, from the surprised expression on [MASK]'s face, how ridiculously grand she herself must be looking; and the idea carried her down stairs into the room; it gave her that length of oblivion from the keen sharpness of the recollection of the actual business in hand.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Margaret	A sense of change, of individual nothingness, of perplexity and disappointment, over-powered [MASK]. Nothing had been the same; and this slight, all-pervading instability, had given her greater pain than if all had been too entirely changed for her to recognise it.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Higgins	[MASK]'s eye fell on the children. 'Yo've called me impudent, and a liar, and a mischief-maker, and yo' might ha' said wi' some truth, as I were now and then given to drink.
<name>Eppie</name>	Eppie	Margaret	Of course, she told it incompletely; and her father was rather 'taken aback' by the idea of the drunken weaver awaiting him in his quiet study, with whom he was expected to drink tea, and on whose behalf [MASK] was anxiously pleading.
<name>Bessy</name>	Bessy	Bessy	I were loth to let her go; but somehow we must live; and th' Union can't afford us much.' 'Now I must go. You have done me good, [MASK].' 'I done you good!' 'Yes.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Higgins	He's dead, and I'm sorry. That's enough.' 'So it is. Will you take work with me? That's what I came to ask.' [MASK]'s obstinacy wavered, recovered strength, and stood firm. He would not speak.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Martha	[MASK] went to the door, and let him in; she has shown him into master's study. I went to him myself, to try if that would do; but no--it's you, miss, he wants.'
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Margaret	She dwelt upon what he must have borne in secret for long; her mother only replied coldly that he ought to have told her, and that then at any rate he would have had an adviser to give him counsel; and [MASK] turned faint at heart when she heard her father's step in the hall.
<name>Thornton</name>	Thornton	Thornton	Few drapers' assistants, as he was once, could have made themselves what he is.' 'But can yo' give dinners back, in yo'r small house? [MASK]'s house is three times as big.' '
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Susan	'My little [MASK] was disappointed when I left without wishing her goodbye; and it has been on my conscience ever since, that I gave her pain which a little more exertion on my part might have prevented. But it is a long way.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Margaret	'It's no use my trying to say how much I shall like it,' said [MASK], through her tears. 'Well, then, prove your gratitude by keeping those fountains of yours dry for the next two days.
<name>Helen</name>	Helen	Margaret	Let them turn out! I shall suffer as well as they: but at the end they will find I have not bated nor altered one jot.' [MASK] had re-entered the room and was sitting at her work; but she did not speak.
<name>Fanny</name>	Fanny	Margaret	I am as sure that he will come directly to us, as I am sure of my life. Be easy, mamma, you shall see him as far as anything earthly can be promised.' 'You will write to-night? Oh, [MASK]!
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Margaret	God help 'em!' said he, more convinced by his own presentation of the facts than by all [MASK] had said, and suddenly renouncing the idea, which had but recently formed itself in a brain worn out by the day's fatigue and anxiety. '
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Bessy	[MASK]'s cheeks flushed a little at her thought being thus easily read. 'Well,' said she, 'yo' see, they thinken a deal o' money here and I reckon yo've not getten much.'
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	John	'Nonsense, [MASK]. One would think you were made of money.' 'Not quite, yet. But about the horses I'm determined. The last time you were out in a cab, you came home with a headache from the jolting.'
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Henry	They kept her out of the way of other friends who might have eligible sons or brothers; and it was also agreed that she never seemed to take much pleasure in the society of any one but [MASK], out of their own family.
<name>Bessie</name>	Bessie	Dixon	But I am tired: it surely must be near bedtime.' 'Not far off--it is half-past nine. You had better go to bed at once dear. Ask [MASK] for some gruel. I will come and see you as soon as you are in bed.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Fanny	[MASK] asked her mother numerous small questions, all having nothing to do with the subject, which a wiser person would have perceived was occupying her attention. Consequently, she received many short answers. She was not sorry when, at ten o'clock, the servants filed in to prayers.
<name>Lord</name>	Lord	Lord	They may say they do, for form's sake; but [MASK], sir, d'ye think their first cry i' th' morning is, "What shall I do to get hold on eternal life?" or "What shall I do to fill my purse this blessed day?
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Margaret	' 'And a great deal more, you would imply. I differ from you. A man is to me a higher and a completer being than a gentleman.' 'What do you mean?' asked [MASK]. 'We must understand the words differently.'
<name>Ned</name>	Ned	Nicholas	They drew very close to each other in unspoken sympathy. [MASK] was sitting by the fire-side in his accustomed corner: but he had not his accustomed pipe. He was leaning his head upon his hand, his arm resting on his knee.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Margaret	I do not like you to rest even under the shadow of an impropriety; he would not know what to think of seeing you alone with a young man.' 'As for that,' said [MASK], rather haughtily, 'I hold it is "Honi soit qui mal y pense.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Margaret	The porter opened the door cautiously, not nearly wide enough to admit her. 'It's you, is it, ma'am?' said he, drawing a long breath, and widening the entrance, but still not opening it fully. [MASK] went in.
<name>Estella</name>	Estella	Margaret	He had seated himself on a chair, close to the door; half-conquered, half-resenting; intending to go out as soon as she left her position, but unwilling to use the violence he had threatened not five minutes before. [MASK] laid her hand on his arm.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Havre	'To [MASK]. Trying to detect the secret of the great rise in the price of cotton.' 'Ugh! Cotton, and speculations, and smoke, well-cleansed and well-cared-for machinery, and unwashed and neglected hands.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Margaret	The sharpness in her eye turned to a wistful longing as she met [MASK]'s soft and friendly gaze. 'I ha' none so many to care for me; if yo' care yo' may come. So they walked on together in silence.
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Betsy	'The fall! What fall?' 'Caused by the blow or push of which [MASK] speaks.' 'Then there was a blow or push?' 'I believe so.' 'And who did it?'
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Margaret	I never removed in my life, and only a fortnight to think about it!' [MASK] was inexpressibly relieved to find that her mother's anxiety and distress was lowered to this point, so insignificant to herself, and on which she could do so much to help.
<name>Thornton</name>	Thornton	Margaret	[MASK] looked up at the man, almost expecting some contradiction from him, or at least some remark that would modify his daughter's utter hopelessness. But, instead, he added-- 'I'm afeared hoo speaks truth. I'm afeared hoo's too far gone in a waste.'
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Margaret	'All men must die,' said he at last, with a strange sort of gravity, which first suggested to [MASK] the idea that he had been drinking--not enough to intoxicate himself, but enough to make his thoughts bewildered. '
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Dixon	So [MASK] flung off, to bid him walk up-stairs. She was a little mollified, however, when he looked at his feet with a hesitating air; and then, sitting down on the bottom stair, he took off the offending shoes, and without a word walked up-stairs.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Margaret	It took a great moral effort to galvanise his trust--erewhile so perfect--in [MASK]'s pure and exquisite maidenliness, into life; as soon as the effort ceased, his trust dropped down dead and powerless: and all sorts of wild fancies chased each other like dreams through his mind.
