<name>Rhett</name>	Rhett	Richard	[MASK]’s voice had been light, but the slight emphasis with which he clipped his words proved that he was not as carefree as he would have her believe. She decided wisely not to pester him with questions about their plans. He was probably completing them now.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Frances	“I know,” he said, and began some amusing suggestions about what they could possibly be drinking. “It’s really only habit which makes me order coffee. A few more days and I’ll probably lose it,” [MASK] said.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Richard	[MASK] closed his eyes: he could see the two scars ridging the cheek. The words reached them in waves. “. . . regret your stupidity . . . advantage of my humanity. In two hours my young barbarians, as you called them, will return.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Richard	She watched them finish their beer, each man with his own thoughts. The truth was that there was no peace of mind left for anyone—for anyone with a heart. [MASK] had risen, and changed the subject. “Now about this afternoon.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Frances	He pointed to the farthest bookshelves. His eyes were fixed for a few moments on the red rose of [MASK]’ hat. She said, “I am very interested in some of these old song collections.” She waved her hand towards the music table.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Frances	They had reached the pavement and, surrounded once more by Sunday-evening crowds, they walked in silence towards the cinema. Outside its doors, [MASK] paused to look at the stills. ‘‘I think I’d rather have a drink,” she said.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Frances	The waiter staged his arrival from nowhere. He wiped and apologized with equal vigor. [MASK] sat very still. She was conscious of the smile on her lips which had settled there and wouldn’t come off, as if she were having her photograph taken.
<name>He</name>	He	Richard	Perhaps it was the very large, very pink flowers on the wallpaper that made her feel so wilted. [MASK] said good night rather brusquely, and opened their door. The woman wasn’t usually conversational, he thought, but she must have been surprised to see them.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Frances	[MASK] nodded. She was concentrating on the varying firmness of the treacherous clumps underneath her feet. The stream was shallow, fortunately. They crossed by choosing stones either jutting up or only lightly covered by the racing water.
<name>Quiller</name>	Quiller	Richard	She said, “They aren’t the only ones.” It was half a question. [MASK] squeezed her arm affectionately. “Right you are. Too obvious.” That confirmed her guess why they hadn’t slipped out of the cinema last night, instead of innocently changing seats.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Richard	“A kind of mental pervert, working herself into depths of depression to enjoy her secret thrills of pity? No, thank you, [MASK]. Instead, I’ll become accustomed to the idea that man is bom in pain, lives in struggle, dies in suffering.”
<name>he</name>	he	Frances	The bookseller’s eyes flickered as they read “My love is like a red, red rose” (translated from the English). And then he smiled gently, his round fat face creasing with genial puckers. He mopped his brow again, and [MASK] closed the book carefully.
<name>Hardy</name>	Hardy	Richard	The whole thing looked so simple that one would hardly have guessed the strain on his arms and shoulders. He disappeared silently over the edge of the balcony. [MASK] kept close to the shadow of the house. Above him, he heard a shutter being tried.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Frances	The bedroom door closed gently. [MASK] looked as if she might cry. She tied the scarf which lay on the bed beside the hand-knitted jacket round her head, and knotted it under her chin. She buttoned on the white-wool jacket.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Frances	They had laid a pretty track. “Go on,” he whispered to [MASK]. She looked at him despairingly. “I can’t lead. You must. I’ll go over the side.” She pointed to the steep drop down to her right.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Thornley	Take away the Tyrolese jacket, and add a black one, and a heavy black cap, and a holster at his belt, and a rubber club, and he was typed as accurately as in a Hollywood casting office. His eyes had been fixed on [MASK].
<name>Jenkins</name>	Jenkins	Johann	“What about the owner of the hotel?” “He left the hotel just after a telephone call came for him very late last night. No one has seen him since. So [MASK] was in charge when the police came. They seemed very angry.”
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Richard	The fear, which had paralyzed her legs so that she couldn’t follow [MASK], suddenly left her. All she felt now was anxiety for him. She pointed frantically towards the boulder; but he didn’t or wouldn’t understand. He was coming back to her.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Richard	[MASK] brought over a damp sponge smelling of pink geranium. “Do your face and shoulder," he commanded. He poured water into a basin and carried it over to where she was sitting. He helped her pull off the tattered cardigan and blouse.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Richard	She turned to [MASK]. He was standing before the piano, his hands deep in his pockets, his lips pursed. He nodded silently to a piece of music displayed prominently on the stand. It was their old friend. He shook his head disapprovingly.
<name>He</name>	He	Richard	She lay feeling safe and warm and comfortable. Dangers and cruelty didn’t exist; nor did lies and treachery, nor hatred and jealousy. It was fine just to lie like this, just to feel safe and warm and comfortable. [MASK] watched the smile on her lips.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Richard	It is so large.” “Yes, unfortunately it is,” broke in [MASK]. He was damned if he was going to let this pass. “But we are very frank about our unemployment figures.” “What do you mean?”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Richard	She noticed that [MASK] brightened. His dislike was the cafds with creamcakes. As he moved towards the stairs, she broke off a red rose, and fastened it through the lapel buttonhole of her flannel suit. She wished she felt as confident as her heels sounded on the wooden staircase.
<name>John</name>	John	Richard	Its lights were few. It seemed already asleep within its walls. The porter had found them a taxi, at last. [MASK] gave the driver the name of the hotel. The driver looked at them. His face was large and round and expressionless.
<name>George</name>	George	Anni	How on earth were they to get hold of the map? “I’ll bring it to you,” [MASK] said eagerly. “Then you must come when it’s dark. Can you get away this evening without making anyone suspicious?” “On Saturday, yes.
<name>He</name>	He	Richard	They both stared in amazement. The tall man who had entered was equally taken aback. He recovered himself before they did. “Well, really,” he said in perfect English, “this is a pleasure.” [MASK] smiled; his eyes were calm again.
<name>She</name>	She	Frances	He is, isn’t he?” “Yes. I think he didn’t mean to show it, but I made him angry.” “What interests me is what he said to anger you.” “Was it obvious?” [MASK] was dismayed.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Richard	They sat in silence during the short journey to the hotel. “You could have walked,” said the driver, as they got out of the taxi. He seemed as if he disapproved of their extravagance. [MASK] made no reply. CHAPTER THE WALLED TOWN
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bob	She struggled weakly against the rope which held her. And then there was [MASK]’s voice, too. Beside her. She heard the lamp fall, and the glaring circle of light had gone. The ropes had suddenly stopped cutting into her breast and thigh.
<name>Chichikov</name>	Chichikov	Madame	He spoke for a moment to [MASK]. Still no one came. They left, as slowly as would seem natural, but the man had completely disappeared. They went down the steep steps. It had begun to rain, and the doorkeeper put up his enormous umbrella for them as they waited for a taxi.
<name>Priscilla</name>	Priscilla	Frances	Our pleasures are really very simple.” “You mean that if I hadn’t laughed just now, you would have been laughing because I didn’t laugh because you didn't laugh.” “I would have had my giggle inside,” admitted [MASK].
<name>She</name>	She	Frances	“Don’t let the tragedy of the human race get you down at this time of the morning. Come and have some breakfast, first.” He drew her gently from the window. “An empty stomach only turns thought into worry.” [MASK] smiled and kissed him.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Richard	[MASK] was thankful for the second time in two days that his shoes were soled with rubber. At any moment, he expected the door above them to open, and a volley of shots to pin them against the staircase wall . . . But the door didn’t open.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Richard	“I stayed there in ’32. What happened to it?” The man was silent. “What happened to it?” [MASK] asked again. The man hesitated. “Oh—they went away.” His voice was as expressionless as his face.
<name>Inspector</name>	Inspector	Richard	Now let’s see what [MASK] can make of that. The waiter became aware of the man who was trying to edge impatiently past him. He stepped aside, but not in time. He must have knocked the man’s elbow, for the cigarette fell from his hand onto their table.
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Richard	When he joined them, the three men looked at each other for some moments. Then [MASK] turned, and led the way up the wooded hillside. It was a short climb. They paused on the crest, sheltered by the pines.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Richard	That is how we will be dismissed, as if neutrality implied a special sanctity. There now, [MASK], I’ve got it all out of my system. I shan’t mention it again.” “That’s the girl. Remember this part of the river?”
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Richard	Their eyes searched the hill around them. Once they stopped, while the man looked towards the westward path on the mountain, but it had only been some animal which had attracted his attention. He had quick eyes all right, thought [MASK].
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Frances	Someone who spoke a foreign language had more allowances made for him. “By the way, we don’t know your name, yet,” [MASK] said. “We can’t go on just calling you ‘the American.' ” The man smiled.
<name>Parker</name>	Parker	Richard	“I must say I thought he was a little—theatrical. He was very unlike himself.” [MASK] shook his head slowly. “No to both of these. He was too worried to be theatrical. By the way, he didn’t turn up at the party.”
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Frances	“We can’t go on just calling you ‘the American.' ” The man smiled. Thank goodness, thought [MASK], he gave up the idea that I was trying to reprimand him. He was searching in his pocketbook for a card.
<name>Klaus</name>	Klaus	Richard	If she hurried she would not be late for [MASK]. The man in the restaurant, who had chosen a window table next to where a young American and Englishman had sat, saw the Austrian girl who walked in that familiar way. He was suddenly alert.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lisa	It led on to a narrow paved path beside a high wall, from which a coarse green climbing plant stretched greedily over the trellis above her head. In front of her were the backs of the houses on the next street. Everything happened as [MASK] had said it would.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bob	But anyway she could tell us the quickest way to get to the house. That worried [MASK] still more, because it was the road you had taken that afternoon. Then we thought we would go see for ourselves.
<name>Challenger</name>	Challenger	Frances	“I was thinking of icebergs. You know, one tenth above to impress you, and the rest beneath to terrify you.” “If you know the peculiarity of icebergs,” said the American, with a quick glance at [MASK].
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Frances	[MASK] saw their name followed by the words Passenger to Nice. The room, stripped of their belongings, looked colorless in spite of the wallpaper. It was just another hotel bedroom. The dark-haired, sallow chambermaid came in at half-past twelve.
<name>Swann</name>	Swann	Bob	He thought he had heard a shutter being forced open. . . . And that sound might be a window. He began to blame himself for not having tried to climb up himself, even with his stiff shoulder and tom knees. What the devil was keeping [MASK]?
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Viewed	[MASK] dispassionately, he was tall and thin; he was already going bald; his chin was weak despite the posed pout of the lips; but whatever strength his chin lacked, his eyes with their intense stare sought to gain.
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Johann	Armies cost a lot of money, [MASK]. And the money is wasted unless the armies are used, and pay for themselves by winning. It is a very dangerous thing to build up a huge army when the rest of the world is at peace.”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Kronsteiner	[MASK]’s change seemed to amuse him . . . And then he went back to his soup. “It would be a pity to leave it,” he explained, his voice once more matter-of-fact.
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Frances	He calmly swung himself onto one of them, and raced after [MASK]. His improvising was more successful than he had hoped. Three angry young men rushed out of the cafe and mounted bicycles too. Their yells were enough to make everyone in the street look round.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Frances	“Nice to be young,” said [MASK]. “Then you can laugh at the other fellow, and leave it at that. You never think that the things which make you laugh can also strike you cold with horror.”
<name>John</name>	John	Frances	Tonight she would slip the map under the door of that house; and then she would forget the address forever. She promised. She was smiling again, as [MASK] said good-by. She seemed happier now that she could be of some use after all.
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Smith	They were probably safe— probably. “Could you run, if we both helped?” he asked [MASK]. “I can try.” They linked arms round him, and half ran, half swept him along the road.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Richard	As he concentrated on the problem of francs and centimes, she caught sight of the gray-suited man and girl in a mirror. This was how we look to strangers, she thought. [MASK] had noticed the direction of her glance. His eyes were laughing.
<name>Quiller</name>	Quiller	Richard	It was the natural reaction of any secret agent to outwit the other fellow. That indeed could be their mistake. She began to understand just how intelligent [MASK] had been last night, when he hadn’t left the picture house. But one thing still needed explaining.
<name>Viking</name>	Viking	Frances	Again the fear came back to him that they might be on the wrong trail. [MASK] might be a hundred miles from here—injured, dead. He began to count the branches above him. Anything, anything to keep him from thinking. CHAPTER VIKING’S FUNERAL
<name>McGee</name>	McGee	Thornley	“To pay for the wear on the tires,” said [MASK] tactfully. “Where is she now?” asked the one who had smiled. “She went up that small alley.” “But it has another entrance! There's a short-cut!
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Frances	Two young men had halted at their compartment. "This will do,” said one, after hardly seeming to glance in their direction. They swung their rucksacks on to the rack, and threw their Burberries after them. Undergraduates, thought [MASK], as she looked at a magazine.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Myles	” The voice was clearer now, as if the man’s anger were becoming cold and cruelly calculating. “Your remaining days will not be pleasant. We shall catch [MASK] just as surely as we caught you. And your stupidity will be quite in vain.”
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Ottilie	She said, “I am very interested in some of these old song collections.” She waved her hand towards the music table. The bookseller looked at her gloves in dismay. “But the books are filthy,” he cried. “[MASK], where is the duster?”
<name>Spider</name>	Spider	Thornley	He pointed to a window. “That may be our room. Can you climb?” [MASK] looked at the balcony at the side of the house. He grinned. “Easy meat,” he said softly. He swung himself up easily from a windowsill.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Frances	When two people succeeded in that, then they were complete. Without [MASK], however definite his own personality might be, he was incomplete. Sleep was impossible. He lay and watched the blackness of the courtyard bleach to gray, and felt the coldness of early morning strike his bare shoulders.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Richard	When did you get back?” “Two or three weeks ago. I would have written you if I could. I’ve just been explaining to [MASK]. I’ve purposely not written you. And I am not staying with you, either.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Thomley	Then he might try some stalking right up to the outskirts of the house itself. [MASK] would be a good man to have along; he knew his way about a mountain. It was just as well that he had come up here after all.
<name>She</name>	She	Frances	“Now some talcum powder on top of these scratches and they won’t show.” [MASK] smiled gratefully, and then grimaced as she covered the cut on her shoulder with iodine. “We got lost on the hills,” she explained.
<name>Constance</name>	Constance	Frances	“Well, I only hope she was beautiful,” [MASK] said. “I mean, if you will do things like that, you may as well make the most of it.” She smiled as she looked up at the correctly dressed young man balancing against the fireplace.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Frances	It was an extraordinary sight to watch them open their parcels of bread and sausages at the restaurant tables, ordering one glass of beer, clean plates and knives. [MASK] was particularly shocked when she found that not even a tip was left for the overworked waitresses.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Richard	Sort of legitimate showing-off, you know, with no one to reprimand you for being an exhibitionist. Well, I think it will be the same when whatever is going to happen happens. I was thinking about the war, particularly, [MASK].
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Frances	As he explained to [MASK] in bed that night, “They were hungry and when we landed in the cinema, they might have gone out in relays for their dinner. Then we moved our seats, and they didn’t notice it at first.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Frances	Her matter-of-fact kind of sanity smothered [MASK]’ impulse, and she contented herself with looking at the garden and having another cup of coffee. She rose to leave. “Not that way,” said the woman. “Go out by this door: across the yard.
<name>Heinrich</name>	Heinrich	Richard	That will cost you extra, of course, but you’ll find it worth every pfennig. Every pfennig.” “How much will it cost?” 1^6 Assignment: Suspense “How much have you?” [MASK] restrained a smile.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Frances	[MASK] looked after him sadly. “He really was so nice, you know, before he got caught up in his theories. I suppose if your country is three thousand or whatever it is miles away you can afford the luxury of pros and cons.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Frances	The men saw the expression on her face change to one of amazement, like that of a child who has fallen and only realizes it is hurt when the blood begins to flow. So [MASK] looked as the searing pain showed her a neat groove in her left arm.
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Richard	It shouldn’t be dangerous: tiresome, perhaps, and certainly a blasted nuisance, but not actually dangerous if you stick to the directions.” He shot a quick glance at [MASK], and added with emphasis: "You are just the people we need for it.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Thornley	He wished [MASK] would come. The man’s weight was tiring him. “How are you feeling?” he asked. “Shaky and stiff. But better every moment. Good to be free again.” “How did they get you?”
<name>John</name>	John	Thomley	Everyone does.” She was a nice girl, the kind who really liked to please the customers. [MASK] thanked her, and studied the folder as he made his way out of the office. The queue at the Brenner table was still large.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Anni	It’s all right. But don’t call me that.” [MASK] said, “I knew something was wrong. I have been so worried about you.” “How?” They were both talking in undertones, pacing slowly under the trees.
<name>Jose</name>	Jose	Henry	“It’s some man, anyway. I’d still like to look around. [MASK] may carry a gun. If so, I’ll borrow it. If not, then I’ve always got my stick.” He patted the makhila which lay beside them.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Schulz	He nodded his thanks, and watched her slip them safely into the brown-paper parcel. “We’ll give you five minutes, and then we leave,” called [MASK], in the middle of the last dumpling. “Good-by, young man, and courage.”
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Frances	It had followed the boulders on the banks of the stream, and now it was poised above them, eyes gleaming, teeth showing wickedly. Even as they had turned, it gathered its muscles to spring. [MASK] was the nearer.
<name>Harley</name>	Harley	Richard	The station is just to the left.” He turned to [MASK]. “I seem to have caused you a lot of trouble. But perhaps you’ll find some consolation in the fact that I really happen to have discovered something which will be extremely valuable.
<name>Nynaeve</name>	Nynaeve	Frances	I’m sorry.” [MASK] let her muscles relax. She pushed her damp hair away from her brow to feel the full coolness of the evening breeze. “You can always study the paths,” she said.
<name>John</name>	John	Richard	His eyes were fixed on the other man standing over the girl roped to a chair, as he himself paused in the lighting of a cigarette. The match was still burning as [MASK]’s full weight knocked him backwards, pinning him against the desk.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Frances	They turned again to the chessboard. [MASK] lit a cigarette with some enjoyment. When she came to think of it, the conversation had been rather like a game of chess, itself. From their point of view, it had been really quite satisfactory.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Tony	“It became obvious that I was inclined to get involved in things, and there was no sign of [MASK]’s girl. In the end, he thought it was better for him to do the job alone. He can control his temper better than I can.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Richard	[MASK] had nothing. It might have been the shadow of a smile on the American’s face, but his voice was serious enough. “Well, I have, so if we get into a tight spot . . .” He didn’t finish, but tapped his pocket thoughtfully.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Frances	[MASK] paid little attention; he often did that—but as they reached the desk, she suddenly realized that the last few bars had taken shape into something she knew. My love indeed my love is like a red red red red rose.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Richard	It’s only the opinion of the civilized that really matters.” “Yes, but it looks as if a lot of the civilized will be killed because they ignored the thoughts of the uncivilized. Ignoring doesn’t abolish them, you know, [MASK].”
<name>Patricia</name>	Patricia	Peter	There was no doubt that [MASK]’s friend had a peculiar sense of humor. This might only be another example. She drew her cardigan more closely round her shoulders, and lit a cigarette. She walked slowly round the room, feeling it like a cat.
<name>Lord</name>	Lord	Richard	“No one told her to stop her work, and so she goes on. How long will it take before she realizes that she is already out of a job? [MASK], if ever a sailor needed grog, that sailor’s me.”
<name>John</name>	John	Thomley	We are all tied to our mothers’ apronstrings—and big business keeps bleating about peace and prosperity. Between the apronstrings and the bleating, we’ll all hesitate until it’s too late. That is what depresses me.” [MASK] said nothing to that.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Richard	“Sorry, [MASK].” She moved to kiss him and bumped her nose against his chin. “I’ll pack tomorrow afternoon, and then we can leave anytime,” she added sleepily. She stifled a yawn against his shoulder.
<name>Margot</name>	Margot	Richard	[MASK], that is going to be a difficult moment. Other summers, it was different. She always knew she would be coming back in time for October. She seems to feel she will never be back here. I found her packing in floods of tears this evening.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Frances	There was a man at the desk, watching them through his small half-closed eyes. Or it might have been the largeness of his face which gave his eyes the appearance of smallness. Like two bullet holes in a lump of dough, thought [MASK].
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Frances	“We go to the movies,” said [MASK] gravely. He looked at her serious face, and then decided to risk a laugh. “It’s that dead-pan look you English have when you have your little joke which makes us think you’ve no sense of humor.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Frances	I’d like to look around.” “You’ve no gun,” said [MASK] in a very low voice; her fears stifled her. “Perhaps he isn’t our man after all,” she added persuadingly. “It’s some man, anyway.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Richard	“What?” “Don’t be a brute, [MASK]. No one can possibly hear us.” She looked at the houses across the fields, their wide overhanging roofs anchored with roped stones, their window boxes gay with rich-colored petunias.
<name>John</name>	John	Richard	[MASK] did not blame her. “Can I phone safely from some place near here?” he asked. She nodded, and pointed across the back yard to a house in the next street. And then the doorbell rang.
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Richard	The velvet glove was off. [MASK] was unperturbed. “I think we’ll leave quite soon, now. We’ve done most of the walks and climbs which we intended to do . . . Actually, we have been just discussing tonight where we should go next.
