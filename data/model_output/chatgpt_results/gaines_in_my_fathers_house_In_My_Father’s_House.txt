<name>he</name>	he	Jonathan	But [MASK] was not through. He raised both fists over his head and looked round at the people in the room. “We need more people,” he said. “More young people. More old people. We need the ones in the bars.
<name>the other person</name>	the other person	Chippo	He probably wouldn’t have been able to say anything even if he had tried. It was only when he realized that [MASK] had stopped talking, that there had been silence a minute or two, that he looked at him again. “What?” he said.
<name>Rocky</name>	Rocky	Phillip	“Sir?” [MASK] stood wide-legged and stretched out his two big arms. In his navy blue cotton robe, he looked like a heavyweight fighter in the center of the ring. “Do I look tired?” he asked again.
<name>black</name>	black	African	His long, narrow face was the color of dark, well-used leather, and it looked just as tough. His sharp features, his thick, curly black-gray hair showed that he had as much white or Indian in him as he did [MASK].
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Phillip	“No,” [MASK] said. “No. That’s what the law is for. That’s what the law’s there for.” “Law?” the boy asked, as if the word was foreign to him. “There ain’t no law.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Phillip	The dream that he had a night or two before the boy got here was more than a dream, it was a vision, an omen, a warning. [MASK] pressed his face down against the sheet and tried not to think about it any more.

<name>Rocky</name>	Rocky	Mills	“He was my war,” [MASK] said. “I’m old, I don’t have too many more battles left in me. This might be my last one— and I wanted to go out winning.
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Shepherd	“I had a home once,” he said. “Where did you come from?” « i • » A prison. “You’re just getting out of prison?” “You can call it that.” For a moment [MASK] watched him without saying anything else.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Phillip	Always will be.” “Not to them. Not to me no more either.” “I’m father,” [MASK] said. “No matter what. I’m father. To you and to them.” The boy looked at him a long time.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Mills	“Yes, I made a mistake,” he said. “Yes, I shoulda got up off that floor and said who he was. When I didn’t do that I shoulda called [MASK] Saturday night. I shoulda told him about it Sunday morning.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Phillip	He saw a man in a black overcoat walking on the sidewalk to his right. The man had both hands in his pockets, his head down, his shoulders hunched, walking fast against the wind. [MASK] drove up even with him and rolled down the glass.
<name>Job</name>	Job	Chippo	[MASK] shrugged his shoulders. “I don’t understand His ways, man. They say what He do He do for the best.” “To let my boy die like that, that’s for the best?
<name>Father</name>	Father	Phillip	“ ‘Get yourself a ticket and go kill him,’ she told me. ‘Sew back your nuts by killing your father.’ Rut I can’t sew them back by killing you, can I? Can I, Father?” [MASK] looked horrified.
<name>Malcolm</name>	Malcolm	Hal	Oh, they let a black slip in here, slip in there every now and then, but for every one that get a little position they hire another hundred cops to keep the rest back. That’s why they killed [MASK] today.
<name>Maury</name>	Maury	Phillip	“Y’all ain’t talked, y’all ain’t seen each other in over twenty years—and he had to be a little nothing when he left from here—how you know he’s your son?” “I know my blood,” [MASK] said.
<name>Uncle Tom</name>	Uncle Tom	Baboons	He’s got no more respect for me, for you, for any other black man or woman than his paw had. We animals far as he’s concerned. [MASK], monkeys, apes. Me? He call me an old gray coon.
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Nolan	Not so much from anger as from total disbelief of what he was hearing from [MASK]. “We always been straight with each other,” he said. “We always had problems—in our business we go’n have problems—but we always handled it like men.”
<name>Phoenix</name>	Phoenix	Lisa	“[MASK] live a mile from here.” “She got them children. Can’t they walk?” He looked at the small, very old woman sitting back in the chair with the blanket spread over her legs. He loved her very much, and he wished he could tell her everything.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Phillip	The brim of her big red hat turned up on one side. She had a small dark mole just above the left comer of her mouth. She and [MASK] had been lovers once. A sudden warm good feeling came over him that he wished was not there.
<name>Reverend</name>	Reverend	Shep	“[MASK] woulda told me if he knew. It’s none of my business, but I don’t think he’s here to meet anybody. I think he’s just drifting. Just drifting. I think he’s a lost soul that’s just drifting.”

<name>Minnie</name>	Minnie	Theresa	“Always tried to do my best,” he said. “What more can poor people do?” [MASK] said. “Turn left right there.” After he had gone another block she told him to turn right.
<name>Myrtle</name>	Myrtle	Alma	After a while he went into the living room and looked out on the street. He wanted to go into his office, but he knew [MASK] would come in there and get him out. He sat down in the big leather chair with his pipe.
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Phillip	The deputy started looking through his papers again. After [MASK] had been standing there about five minutes, the deputy got up from his desk and went into another room. When he came back out he looked through his papers another minute or two before saying anything.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Nolan	“That’s right,” [MASK] said. “This personal, not political. They can’t blow it up like they can do a demonstration. Go on, call him and see. See what he cares about blood kin.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Phillip	[MASK] bit into his lips, the tears running down his face. “Now you put it on the world,” the boy said, taunting him more now that he was crying. “Did the world push them three dollars in my hand that day?
<name>Uncle Tom</name>	Uncle Tom	Phillip	“What happened to your brother?” [MASK] asked. “What you think happens to a black boy when he kills? The law takes charge.” “They killed him?” “For all we’re concerned, they killed him.
<name>him</name>	him	Phillip	The woman groaned as she pushed herself away from the stool. She poured the coffee from a glass urn that sat on a little electrical stove at the far end of the counter. “This been some weather, you hear me,” she said, coming back to [MASK] with the coffee.
<name>his wife</name>	his wife	Alma	He started thinking about his own family at home. How was he ever going to make up to [MASK] and the children? How was he ever going to make up to his church? But maybe he wouldn’t even have a church when he got back.
<name>The Inspector</name>	The Inspector	Shepherd	His coat and cap hung on a nail against the wall. [MASK] had looked round at the things in the room, and now he looked back at the tenant again. “Why don’t you change,” he told him. “We ought to get moving.”
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Alma	[MASK] tried comforting him, but as soon as he felt her hand, he wiped his eyes and reached for his hat and coat. He adjusted his hat well on his head, then as he stood up to put on the coat he suddenly stopped as if he had just remembered something.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Phillip	“I just said they wasn’t go’n stand for you to treat them the way you treat me.” “Well, nobody need to stand for nothing I do no more,” [MASK] said, and finished off his drink.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Billy	“Burning this country down.” “Burning it down?” “To the level ground,” [MASK] said. “The white man’s just go’n stand round with his hands in his pockets and let you burn this country down?”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Lord	He didn’t want tell me nothing, and I didn’t want tell you either. But I wanted to know what had happened, just like you want to know. I’m just telling it to you the way he told it to me. [MASK] knows I hate telling it.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Phillip	He couldn’t bring himself to ask it.

<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Beverly	Wore yellow all the time. Yellow hats, yellow dresses, yellow ribbons. I can’t remember the time she didn’t have on something yellow.” [MASK] could see how serious he was, and she smiled patiently at him. “What happened?”
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Phillip	Be quiet. Lie still a moment.” “I’m all right,” [MASK] said. The people who stood over him canopylike could see tears in his eyes. “I’m all right. Please let me up. I have to get up.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Chippo	“What—he come to see you?” “He wanted to kill me. When he heard where I was he went to her and told her he wanted to kill me.” “That boy’s crazy,” [MASK] said. “Not her.
<name>Candy</name>	Candy	Virginia	“What friend?” [MASK] said. “He ain’t got no friend. He ain’t got nobody. And he ain’t going to no conference neither. I know it, you know it, and everybody else round here know it.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Phillip	Two young waiters in white jackets, with their dish towels over their shoulders or across their arms, went from the bar to the tables, to the food counter in back. Nothing had changed here—nothing; except that most of the people in here now were only half [MASK]’s age.
<name>Boss</name>	Boss	Shepherd	I need somebody to look up to. There ain’t nobody else left out there to look up to. You, I look up to. Me, plenty more like me, we look up to you. I’m right or I’m wrong there, [MASK]?”
<name>he</name>	he	Mills	But, no, how could it be? If [MASK] had known who the boy was he would have brought it up yesterday. Again in his mind’s eye he saw the boy’s thin, bearded face watching him from across the room.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Phillip	But you never loved her, or us. You raped her. You tried to pay off with three dollars.” “I never raped nobody,” [MASK] said. “Surely not her. I gived you three dollars ’cause that’s all I had.”

<name>Bucephalus</name>	Bucephalus	Johanna	How many times had he held him in his arms? How many times had he ridden him on his back? He couldn’t recall now if he ever did. He couldn’t even recall his true name. Talk about what then? He would ask about [MASK].
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Phillip	Where was the boy? Where was he this moment? Why wasn’t he passing the house? [MASK] had heard that he walked the streets day and night, whether it was raining or not, whether it was cold or not—then where was he now?

<name>Bona</name>	Bona	Johanna	He would ask about [MASK]. He would ask about her. She was a beauty, that woman, when she was young. That good, light-brown cafe-au-lait color. She never had to put makeup on that face; no iron in that hair.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Phillip	I cut my hands, I cut my knees, picking up pennies and wrinkled old dollar bills.” He turned back to [MASK] again, his eyes showing more pain than hatred. “ ‘Get yourself a ticket and go kill him,’ she told me.

<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Uptown	But she asked herself where else would he go? [MASK] to one of those back rooms of that white motel? Would they let him in there? By law they were supposed to, but couldn’t they say they didn’t have any vacancy either?
<name>He</name>	He	Phillip	They kept their voices down to keep from disturbing him. [MASK] started thinking about the boy again. Why? he asked himself. Why after all these years—why? And how did he know where to find me? Did she send him here?
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Nolan	“I know you have money,” [MASK] said. “The rich give you money and expensive jewelry. Look at your wrist, look at your fingers. The poor, they give you whatever they can scrape up. I know all about your money.”

<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Shepherd	Cans bent and rusted. Nothing but trash. Nothing but trash now.” “Life’s not like that,” [MASK] said. “Man’s not made of glass and tin.” “It all adds up to the same thing,” the tenant said.

<name>Saul</name>	Saul	Nolan	“Why you doing this to me?” he asked. “Why you persecuting me?” [MASK] let his feet slide away from the desk as he folded the papers and laid them aside. He had controlled himself long as he could. “Persecuting you?”

<name>Trout</name>	Trout	Alma	“He’s just another X,” he said, looking up at [MASK]. “He’s just another X, that’s all.” He ate his breakfast without wanting it. He took a pill from each bottle, hating the pills, and hating himself for taking them.
