<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Agnes	The air at her back felt damp, although when she moved closer to the window she realized it was only the unaccustomed coolness. When had summer become fall? She sat at the kitchen table. [MASK] returned, poured the coffee, and now refusing to meet her eye, carried the tray away.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Momma	“And I’d better call [MASK],” she told him, the children’s rocks and shells and gold alone keeping her from putting her hand to his cheek. She was out with the three of them right after breakfast, a fistful of coins weighing down her purse.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Patrick	“We saw him. He gave us bourbon and Coke.” “Both of us,” [MASK] said. He had his mother’s pale skin but with freckles across his nose, and his father’s dark wavy hair. “Double shots even.”
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Momma	She thought it a shame that more of these immigrants hadn’t simply stayed home, stayed where they belonged. Made the best, as her mother was always telling her to do, of a bad situation. She stood and crossed the rug to the small bare entry that led to [MASK]’s bedroom door.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	One	[MASK] dipped a platter into the center of the three girls and asked, “Caviar?” but their cousin turned up her lip and said, “Fish eggs,” so that the girls, despite their curiosity, pulled back their hands.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Patrick	Now the waiters who had paused to watch the dance scurried through to pour champagne, putting just a mouthful into each child’s glass, which was enough anyway to make [MASK] roll his eyes as if to say this was just what he needed.
<name>Holly</name>	Holly	May	[MASK] brushed back the curtain to see the courtyard and the lighted rooms of the other apartments and then, on an impulse, pushed back her chair, raised her knee to the sill, and climbed out to the narrow fire escape. She straightened up slowly.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Momma	No more sudden weeping and sloppy women breezing in to press her against their breasts. No more sympathy meals, as [MASK] called them, brought by curious neighbors who she said came only to see how they were getting along. “And where is it you’re sleeping?”
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Momma	They were all perspiring. Before they could finish with the beans, [MASK] turned, lifted the colander, shook it, chin raised, took assessment, and then set it down again and told them to break all the beans in half as well.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Fred	Surprisingly for the children, the man with the trumpet began to sing in a soft and foggy voice. You are the promised kiss of springtime That makes the lonely winter seem long . . . [MASK] was a dancer, a natural, even the children saw it.
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	May	She might have been annoyed. “You’d think you’d never heard of them before.” Driving home that evening. [MASK] sat silently beside her mailman, the fingers of her left hand wrapped lightly around the vinyl armrest inside the door.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Momma	I only threw them out yesterday.” “I like daisies,” the younger girl offered and [MASK] said, “Do you?” She brushed her hand over her lap, once, twice, three times. She shook her wrist as if to push back a sleeve.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Mary	What a tongue I have. I put down [MASK], for my sister. I’d already told her in a letter that I would. When he gets home tonight I’ll tell him we can call her May. Sweet as can be.
<name>Margo</name>	Margo	Momma	It was pretty nice. “Last week it was daisies,” [MASK] said. She raised her white brows and her dark eyes flashed. “It’s becoming quite a courtship, don’t you think?” Yeah, they mumbled.Yeah, it was.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Fred	It would not be long before he would have the pleasure of telling him: I know these gals. Believe me. “And how about you, [MASK]?” he asked from across the table that held all the women in his life.
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	Momma	[MASK] came now on their father’s arm in a dress of gray-blue lace, a large, pink, trembling orchid pinned to her shoulder. Her white hair had been curled and brushed out sofdy from her face and the lace cap she wore was set at what seemed a jaunty angle.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Momma	[MASK] said, “The heat was like this the night your mother died. We were afraid we’d all suffocate. Your father slept on the chair in there and it was the first night of all the nights we’d been here that he finally agreed to take off his collar and untie his shoes.
<name>Roger</name>	Roger	Fred	He paused, seemed to pull himself short, and then bent to whisper something to her, [MASK] all the while sitting alone behind her, his hands on his thighs and his face so sympathetic and confused that, watching him, the best man, unaccountably, felt his heart sink.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Fred	The women would straighten up when they saw him, smile and touch a gloved finger to a runny nose—a gesture that the snow and the light and the children calling made seem as delicate and as flirtatious as a raised fan. “Hello, [MASK].
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Annies	The two women grinned—one had a blackened tooth— and said how much the children resembled each other. One of them pointed at the older girl.“And there’s [MASK] face at that age, as clear as if I’m remembering her,” she said.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Rosie	“I wasn’t even born yet when my father got hit,” he said and then, turning his red-rimmed eyes toward his daughter, added ruefully, “And [MASK]’s about to say she’s heard all this before.”
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Annie	Who would have believed that a time would come when I’d say it was just as well, just as well that [MASK] died young and missed seeing this, her own last child, the girl she’d named, throwing away the very life she’d given her.”
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Momma	She returned the tray to the cart and lifted her own drink. Holding it in the air she asked, “Now, where’s [MASK]?” and all four of them looked to the dining room to the empty chair at its far end.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Agnes	Her sister preferred [MASK] and was watching her now with great care, memorizing the way she poured the liquor into the tall pitcher of ice, stirred it with a glass rod, poured it again through a silver strainer and into each delicately stemmed glass.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Momma	[MASK] herself had found the book beside her sister’s bed, had found the name written on the last page, and, had there been more peace in the household in those days, might have foreseen the girl’s need to someday read it for herself.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Momma	The older girl glanced up at the gladiolas, the extravagant flutes of pink and yellow and orange, the tall green stems. In her adult life she would always associate them with some folly. “It’s a vision of heaven,” [MASK] said again.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Momma	They walked through to [MASK]’s bedroom and once again took their places at the window—the two girls sharing one this time—to watch the way the sun, turning orange now and reaching only the top floor of the building across the schoolyard, set brief flames in the windows of buildings far beyond them.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Lucy	The youngest resembled her, and while she was sorry for that, she’d always felt a kind of pride, too, and so had despaired when [MASK] said this morning that the child could not walk as far as the river.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Momma	They were generous, bighearted, bitter. They had been angels of mercy for [MASK] in the months that followed her sister’s death, cooking and cleaning, caring for the girls and holding her in their big arms when that was what she had needed.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Fred	She touched the children’s faces as they filed by but had no words for them, it seemed, although they heard [MASK] tell someone in the line behind them,“Her sisters kids, she’s wild about them,” and felt themselves some trepidation that their aunt’s careful affection for them had been so boisterously revealed.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Fred	She looked at [MASK] again. She saw him raise his eyes to the rearview mirror and then return them to the road ahead. Six years ago when she’d left the convent she had understood fully that it was not because she’d lost her vocation, only settled into it too perfectly.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Fred	He suspected [MASK] felt something of the same. He wrapped the five sandwiches in wax paper and filled a glass jar with lemonade. He chose five perfect peaches and five soft plums. The breeze through the kitchen window was sweet and the radio said the waters were calm, a lovely day for boating.
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Momma	“Oh, sure,” their father added, supporting his new ally. “That’s cancer for you. It’s a terrible disease.” But from her end of the table [MASK] said, “My husband died right outside this apartment door.”
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Maryanne	“The bakery lady put a cookie in there for you. If you want to offer something up, don’t eat the cookie.” He paused and said without boasting, “I always give mine to [MASK].” She recalled that she had seen him do it.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	May	He placed the four of them against the green shingles of the house. In the kitchen he washed the breakfast dishes and rinsed out the cooler. The phone conversation, he knew, would be a long one, what with the wedding to discuss and [MASK] being gone.
<name>her</name>	her	Annie	I looked out the window. The world had never been so quiet. And then I began to hear one sound. I saw the curtain move, although I can tell you there was no breeze. I turned back to [MASK]. I stood right next to her.
<name>time</name>	time	Mary	I thought I’d have an accident myself we laughed so hard at that. There’s a woman from church who knows a family on the Heights who may need a girl come the first of the year, so if it all works out I’ll have [MASK] for myself till then.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Momma	“You see?” she said, by way of comfort. “That’s what happens.” Half an hour later when [MASK] emerged from her room, she listened indifferently to the tale, her eyes on the potato and the peeler in her dirty hands.
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Fred	There was another round of applause as the song ended ([MASK] turning her once, twice, and then finishing the dance with a delicate, debonair dip) and the two of them kissed and went to their places at the table.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Rosemary	[MASK] turned to her cousins, her shallow chin raised and her arms reflecting the blue of her dress. “Aren’t you glad,” she said regally, “that you only have to see your relatives at weddings and wakes?” The children laughed and said.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Momma	There was tea and tiny sandwiches and pastel-colored petit fours back at [MASK]’s place, where the three window fans moved the curtains but did little to relieve the heat. Their father, in his shirtsleeves now, played bartender.
<name>Mr. Peters</name>	Mr. Peters	May	[MASK] was there from the beginning, he supposed, a quickly familiar figure hurrying along. He’d tip his hat, “Isn’t it a lovely day?” Glance over his shoulder whenever she entered the hallway as he snapped the mail into each box.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Momma	At dinner the sisters plied them with roast beef and boiled potatoes and the dark descended long before there was a hope that their father might knock at the door. From her chair [MASK] said, “Your father,” and the four sisters, the children too, held their breath.
<name>Edmund</name>	Edmund	Patrick	And all the wedding guests touched glasses and called good luck and drank their champagne, which struck the two girls as bitter, although their cousin [MASK] drank his down in one gulp and then smacked his lips as if it had been peach nectar, their brother laughing delightedly at this, enchanted.
<name>Mrs. Ramsay</name>	Mrs. Ramsay	Momma	[MASK] took her own cup of tea to her chair. The children didn’t dare look at her or at one another. Without that generation of grownups, of mother and aunts, who had until now blocked and buffeted all their contact with her, they had no sense of what was expected.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Momma	After she died their father hid the book—it was too painful for him to read—and after he remarried, [MASK], his wife, found it in odd places whenever she cleaned, under the rug or behind the stove, wherever.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Momma	“Hello, all,” she said. (So she had been in there, the youngest child thought, there in the room just beyond [MASK]’s, and so thinking began to learn a lifelong lesson in anticipation and longing.)
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Rosemary	Their father plunged again into the crowd, pumping hands and touching forearms, leaning to kiss women the girls didn’t know. [MASK], their cousin, tucked a thin hand under her elbow and looked out over their heads as she sipped her drink.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Fred	A bungalow, she called it, and the children pictured their own summer cottages, miles from here. A nice yard and a fence and walking distance to a bus stop that could take [MASK] to the railroad if he couldn’t manage to get another route out this way.
<name>Estelle</name>	Estelle	Margaret	She needed a loyal student or two to defend her when the imitators started their acts in the schoolyard (smoothing an invisible lipstick over their puckered lips and—this was [MASK]’s own contribution to the scene—waving their rear ends from side to side).
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Rosemary	she said, drawing the word out to show that, no matter how she stretched it, it could not begin to cover her meaning. “I’ll say.” [MASK] smiled politely. She might never have met the man.
<name>McBride</name>	McBride	Hylan	He said, scanning the print as if he were reading it, that [MASK] was a decent man as far as he could see, a former motorman like himself, and he didn’t agree with the people who were trying to make him out to be a raving fool.
<name>Sanctity</name>	Sanctity	Holiness	By the way he held his hand to the white breast of his cassock and held the gold plate just under her chin at Communion. [MASK], sainthood, was upon him, resting easily, and she was discouraged by all the catching up she had to do.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	May	His clothes, too, had been touched with the metal of the fall city air and with his hat knocked askew and his shoulder bent under the weight of the older girl he said, Hello, [MASK], and without thought or awkwardness kissed her cheek.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Momma	They were the nieces of [MASK]’s stepfather, who had been so good to her when she first arrived here and a shanty Irish thorn in her side ever since. (“No blood of mine,” she would declare later that week when they had all gathered again.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Veronica	she would say. Or, “I pay my own way. I certainly pay my own way.” [MASK] would pull the younger girl more tightly to her waist, as if she planned any moment to make a break for it with the child as her shield.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Patrick	she asked. “Just taste it.” She took it from him and put it to her lips just as [MASK] said, “It’s bourbon.” She pulled it away, taking only a sip of the Coke, which had, perhaps, another aftertaste.
<name>She</name>	She	Cancer	He hesitated to recall, for instance, that final year of his mother’s life when at each pleasant pause along his route he would hear himself saying it, saying “It’s my mother, you see. [MASK].”
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Margy	I said. The good-time kids? I can tell you, the neighborhood gossips had a field day.” Her husband looked at the children and then said, a kind of warning, “Now, [MASK],” but she waved a hand.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Margaret	She looked over her shoulder as she slipped it into the bag. “Your sister want one, too?” she said. [MASK] had moved to the little window seat where the tall wedding cake sat and she shook her head quickly when her brother turned to her.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	One night he sat back in his chair, his dark hair all askew from where earlier in the evening he had grasped at it with both hands, and he looked at her, at her fine, broad, serious face, her eyes, and said, “My own contrary [MASK].
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Momma	When [MASK] came her first request was that a proper wall be built, and their father himself had done it, hammering and plastering and bringing all the neighbors up to mark his progress, much to the humiliation of his new bride.
<name>Lucia</name>	Lucia	Momma	He turned to his sisters, touching his cheek to theirs as well. He patted the childrens heads and shook hands with the men and waved briefly from the dark street below when the children ran into [MASK]’s bedroom to see which way he would go.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	May	“Such names!” she said. “When you think about it. So pretty.” Her cheeks were flushed. Their mother turned away a little, avoiding all eyes. “Oh, [MASK],” she said. She might have been annoyed.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sister	Excuse me, please. Don’t you people have work to do?” But for now [MASK] only watched the child as she spoke in a thrilled and breathless way that in other circumstance would have marked her a liar. “It was a long, long time ago.
<name>moonlight</name>	moonlight	Scotch	There was a bar—a saloon was how the children thought of it—with a stuccoed front and a single mysterious brown window, a rounded doorway like the entrance to a cave that breathed a sharp and darkly shining breath upon them, a distillation of night and starlight and [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Veronica	[MASK] let them in and then the three children threw themselves one after the other on the wide green couch. Their mother felt their foreheads. The smell of the roses had taken over the place. “We had fun,” the children said, turning away.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Annie	She was five years old when her widowed mother packed them all up, her and her sister [MASK]—the only two of her five children who were still left—and moved to the city, where she married a terrible man for lack, it seemed, of anything better to do.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Veronica	Had not noticed that the joyous day had proceeded entirely without [MASK] and that, perhaps because of the joy itself, she had not been thought of, she had not been missed, not even by the younger girl, who had given her her loyalty.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Momma	Every year it was a different cottage, never any bigger than [MASK]’s rooms in the city and always, it seemed to the children, built for the most part with wire mesh screens: screen porch front and back, screen doors, patched window screens.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Momma	“A place that’s walking distance to some stores, of course,” she said. “And to a church, if that can be. For [MASK]’s sake. It’s hard to tell this time of year just how green a place might be
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	May	Her eyes were a weak blue but her skin was pale and lovely and her black hair streaked dramatically with gray. “Does it matter?” she asked. “Oh, no,” [MASK] said, carefully, but also throwing caution to the wind.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Rosemary	“Double shots even.” The girls saw their brother hesitate before he said, “Yeah,” and so were certain that this part, anyway, was a lie. [MASK] took the glass from her brother’s hand and sniffed it. It was nearly empty.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	May	And [MASK] once said fiercely, “All this is the past,” seeming to indicate with the cutting, physical motion of her voice the five women in the dining room and their father with his cigarette and even the small children themselves stretched on their stomachs beneath the tree.
<name>Thady</name>	Thady	Veronica	And sure enough, just as the game outside was getting interesting, there she was with the old woman behind her, as white and broad as a god. She was not their natural mother but the sister of the woman who had borne them and who had died with [MASK], the last.
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Momma	He said, “How are you, sis?” to each of the four sisters, and “Hiya, [MASK], dear,” to the old woman, and then added each year, “I’d kiss you, but I’d hate for you to get this cold.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Momma	she’d know he was safe. Once, as A young woman, [MASK] spread a damp dish towel over the wide lip of the sink and then stood on tiptoe to slip a box of soap powder onto the shelf above her.
<name>Miranda</name>	Miranda	Margaret	Her fingernails were long, as bright and as red as her lipstick. The backs of her hands were plump. “Wherever did you get these?” Filled with the grace of her own bestowed blessing, [MASK] said, “From the cemetery,” well before it occurred to her to lie.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Momma	He called her [MASK] dear again and only the older girl noticed how, when he touched her hand, her fingers curled up suddenly to meet his. And yet did not hold. He turned to his sisters, touching his cheek to theirs as well.
<name>Mrs. Hopewell</name>	Mrs. Hopewell	Momma	It was the kind that [MASK] made herself and it was so cool and sweet, so festive with its shreds of fresh peaches or shards of strawberry and blueberry, that it seemed to indicate some joy that lay buried in the old lady’s personality—something girlish, something celebratory.
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Unfortunate	[MASK] had, at least, the fortune, if only a small fortune, somewhere in it and the youngest child imagined that it was lost in that dark room, somewhere among the cottons and the silks that draped the bed and the floor and the embroidered chair and the glass-topped dressing table.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	May	“I hope [MASK] is having better weather,” their mother said at one point, and their father told her, “Weather isn’t supposed to matter on your honeymoon,” which made her laugh and slap him on the knee with her magazine.
<name>leader</name>	leader	Saviour	Each of us has as we leave here today our own arduous way to follow toward death. But it is from such moments as these that we, following our [MASK]’s example, find the courage to go forward. Love sustains us.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Momma	She lived, as far as the children understood, in the small dark room off [MASK]’s bedroom, and although they knew she ventured out, she spoke of shopping downtown, of meeting old friends on the subway, of taking in a show, they had never been with her when she’d done so.
<name>Mrs. Dalloway</name>	Mrs. Dalloway	Momma	On the last day she worked, her office friends led her quietly across the dawn-lit landing and eased her in through the front door, making an escape well before [MASK] could do more than cluck her tongue at them.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Fred	The boy knew that had he himself been the priest called to that house he would have spoken to the figure in the glass in the same manly tone his father had finally used. “[MASK], what is it you want us to do for you?
<name>Rosa</name>	Rosa	Veronica	[MASK] worked for him for five years and when he retired permanendy he gave her the opportunity to do the same, offering her a severance—from his own pocket, it was said—that seemed a small fortune in those days.
<name>Julian</name>	Julian	Momma	The distance from [MASK]’s chair to the patch of dirt or parking lot where their mother stood was not two hundred miles and yet it seemed to inspire in the old lady all the regret and loneliness and sense of devastating mortality that whole churning oceans or continents of mountain ranges might elicit.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Bobby	Still, their first impression was of whiteness, and the two children blinked their eyes and stood enchanted for a moment as children in fairy tales are said to do, coming upon a dream. “Hiya, [MASK],” the woman in white behind the glass counter said.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	May	The fireplace. The skeleton of the new wall. [MASK]'s WEDDING took place on the last Saturday morning of July at 10 a.m., when the streets had not yet dried and the summer sunlight still seemed fresh and weightless in the thick green leaves of the trees.
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Bob	“[MASK],” she said, “will you do the honors?” Their father moved quickly toward her, both men seemed like children under her cool and gentle gaze. “Certainly,” he said. “Ladies, what will it be?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Momma	“Hello, children,” she whispered and then surprised them by not continuing past them as usual and into her room but instead placing herself carefully (the ice cubes tinkling) on the edge of [MASK]’s bed.
<name>New Year's</name>	New Year's	Golgotha	Christmas was passing and even before the merry fog of it had cleared they caught the stony shapes of [MASK]. The mournful part. And then, in the day’s last, limp miracle, the downstairs buzzer rang.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Momma	And then, some years ago, [MASK] had spent the night in their parents’ room (their parents moving into the girls’ room, the girls into their brother’s, their brother to the couch, in what was an illogical but equitable arrangement sure to guarantee each member of the family equal discomfort).
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Veronica	Two weeks later their Aunt [MASK] was born, she said. A beautiful baby that her mother never gained strength enough even to hold—she poked the thick arm of her chair and nodded again as she had nodded at the vase of flowers—now what did they think of that?
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Agnes	And then had borne forever the indelible image of his suffering on her veil. In the bright light of the living room she squinted a little and smiled and said, “Hello, all,” before accepting the drink from [MASK] and taking the youngest child into her arms.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Margaret	She placed the white bakery box she had just tied with string on top of the glass case. “Is this your girlfriend?” [MASK] saw her brother blush and felt better about him than she had all morning when he said sullenly, “My sister.”
<name>Eve</name>	Eve	Fred	His sisters and his mother watched him drink, their anger and their tears and even, on the Christmas [MASK] was there, that stony silence of the grave suspended now on what seemed the delicate promise of his sobriety.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Agnes	There was a check her sister [MASK] was waiting for and what did he think was a reasonable time before having the bank put a stop on it? Another day or two, he said, and the next day rang the buzzer when he saw it had arrived.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Fred	The children were telling their father about the walk and with her courage failing her she prayed they would not mention [MASK] (Saturday night, then?) and yet crossing the landing from the stairs to the door was sorry they had not. The coffee table was bare.
