<name>her</name>	her	Roscoe	The smooth tarmac was wet and steaming. We went back inside. No evidence at all except the wrenched lock and the faint footprints throughout the house. Neither of us spoke. I was burning with anger. Still watching [MASK]. Waiting for the dam to break.
<name>Stephanie</name>	Stephanie	Roscoe	Bounced to a stop right next to us. The big guy folded himself out of the seat and stood up. Just about blotted out the sun. “I appreciate this, [MASK],” he said to her. “You’re really helping me out.”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Hubble	It looked pretty good. Looked like there might be someone in there. Then the first stop was the coat closet off the main hallway. I was looking for gloves. Not easy to find in the Sunbelt. Not much call for them. But [MASK] had some.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Hubble	[MASK] knew the warehouse well. He’d been working up there most days for a year and a half. So we got him to go over and over it, describing the layout. We found paper and pencil and got him to draw plans.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Eno	Maybe it was real, maybe it wasn’t. It would spend just the same. And I wanted to leave her a big tip. [MASK] was getting a dirty grand a week, but I didn’t know if he was passing much of it on.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Spivey	Over his shoulder, I saw a dust plume far in the east. Then I heard the faint roar of a diesel engine. Then I made out the gray shape of the prison bus rolling in. [MASK] snapped his head around to look at his salvation.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Reacher	She had run out of things to do. Run out of distractions. Now she had to face the quiet vulnerable hours of the night. The first night after last night. The prospect was making her agitated. “You got that gun, [MASK]?”
<name>Strickland</name>	Strickland	Hubble	“Nobody said so.” “OK,” I said. “So he’s got some urgent business some- where. Not even an asshole like [MASK]’s going to forget about a ten-thousand-dollar watch, right?” ‘‘What urgent business?”
<name>Quiller</name>	Quiller	Reacher	It was practically a gasp. “Christ,” he said. “Currency paper is mostly cotton fiber. With a bit of linen. They’re bleaching the dollar bills. My God, [MASK], they’re bleaching the ink off. I don’t believe it.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Hubble	Because there’s no point in spectacular work unless it serves a purpose. The threat of it beforehand works on the guy himself. It had certainly worked on [MASK]. He had taken a lot of notice of it. That’s the point of a threat.
<name>She</name>	She	Kissed	She got up when she saw me and walked over. We went back out through the door. Walked a few paces. [MASK]. “Anything from the car rental people?” I asked her. She shook her head. “Tomorrow,” she said.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Kliner	Might get me into trouble as well. I was already worried enough about what I was doing. The whole thing was insane. [MASK] was importing a lot of the fakes. He couldn’t resist it. I thought it made the whole thing way too visible.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Roscoe	I lifted [MASK] off her feet and kissed her long and hard. On and on. She wrapped her legs around my waist and locked her arms behind my head. We kissed like we would die if we stopped. Then I drove slowly and quietly back to town.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Teale	He nodded and moved away. Rested his giant frame against the counter. “This is a huge problem for me,” he said. “Bureau can’t act without a call from the responsible official in the local jurisdiction. That would be this guy [MASK], right?
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Finlay	So I could end up with my big ass in a sling for this. But I’ll bend the rules for [MASK]. We go back quite a ways. But you got to remember, this is all unofficial, OK?” I nodded again.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Roscoe	“There are lawyers sniffing everywhere, right?” she said. “No big deal.” “This guy wasn’t an ambulance-chaser,” [MASK] said. “He was a partner in a big firm down there.
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Kelstein	I said. [MASK] nodded enthusiastically. “Outstanding,” he said again. “How much do you know about counterfeiting?” I shrugged at him. “More than I did last week,” I said. “But not enough, I guess.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Hubble	He figures that’s why you waited the eight hours. Figures that’s why [MASK] was at home today. Didn’t go to work because he was waiting around to pay you off.” I was silent. 1 was worried.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Finlay	Then we fell silent. We were approaching the warehouse complex up at the top of the old county road. It loomed up on our left like the center of our universe. The metal siding reflected the pale dawn. [MASK] slowed. We looked over at the place.
<name>O'Malley</name>	O'Malley	Morrison	Makes it do what the blues is supposed to do. The relaxed G major misting it almost into sweetness. Not vicious. But then I saw the fat police chief walk by. [MASK], on his way past the cells, toward the big office in back.
<name>Peabody</name>	Peabody	Finlay	“Ten minutes, beginning to end. So the woman was being held. The man was being nailed to the wall. I’d guess both were naked by then. They were in nightwear before the attack, right?” “Robes,” [MASK] said.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Finlay	Waited for [MASK] and walked up to the door. The place was deserted apart from the desk sergeant. He nodded to us. We skirted the reception counter. Walked through the big quiet squad room to the rosewood office in back. Stepped in and closed the door.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Roscoe	Everything was consistent. We got the background story from the local people up there. I couldn’t see a problem.” “What was the background story?” [MASK] asked him. He swung his gaze back to her. Glanced through the file.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Roscoe	Someone had used a crowbar on it. The tangle of broken lock and splinters wouldn’t allow the door to close all the way. [MASK] put her hand to her mouth and gave a silent gasp. Her eyes were wide. They slid from the door to me.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Finlay	I was thinking about the second guy’s desperate sprint across the road. Trying to reach cover while the bullets smashed into his flesh. Hurling himself under the highway ramp and dying amid the quiet scuffling of the small night animals. “OK,” [MASK] said.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Charlie	He would break the news, gloss over the details, drive her down to the morgue to identify the body. The morgue people would shroud the corpse with heavy gauze to hide the appalling wounds. “Will you help us?” [MASK] asked me.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Finlay	Guy like that couldn’t shoot pool.” I nodded. Like [MASK]’s partner. Worrying away at a problem. “Got to throw his ass in the can for now,” he said. “No option. He’s confessed, couple of plausible details.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Kliner	and I couldn’t understand about [MASK]’s operation.” “Why not?” I asked him. “Because their paper is perfect,” he said. “It’s one hundred percent perfect. Their paper is better than their printing.
<name>Malfoy</name>	Malfoy	Picard	[MASK] smiled a cold smile at him. “None other,” he said. “The pleasure’s all mine, believe me. You’ve been very helpful, both of you. Very considerate. You’ve kept me in touch every step of the way.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Hubble	“You dropped the match.” We laughed and hugged. We danced and laughed and slapped each other’s backs. We swung the children up in the air and hugged them and kissed them. [MASK] hugged me and pounded me on the back.
<name>Rebus</name>	Rebus	Roscoe	“Corpse stank of whiskey,” he said. “Some fresh bruising on the upper and lower arms. Consistent with him being walked home by two men while inebriated. I couldn’t see a problem.” “Did you do a postmortem?” [MASK] asked him.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Molly	“And they can get that ink?” I said. “Anywhere in the world,” he said. “Everybody uses it. We lag behind other countries. We don’t like to admit we worry about counterfeiting.” I remembered what [MASK] had said.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Bartholomew	“What did the e-mail say?” I asked him. “It said stand by for a call in the morning,” he told me. “The assistant guy said it felt like [MASK] had hit on something important.”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Gray	I thought about it. Pointed at the total on [MASK]’s audit. “They’d need figures like that,” I said. “If this is how much they’re spending, they’d need figures like that just to get rid of it all.”
<name>Jimmy</name>	Jimmy	Joe	I went quiet for a while. I had known nothing about [MASK]. Nothing at all. ‘‘So that’s it?” I said. “Is that all you got?” “No,” he said.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Baker	Any guy with a tweed suit like that and a moleskin vest and a Harvard education would go big on ethics. After a moment the door opened and [MASK] came out. He walked into the big open room and headed for his desk.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Morrison	He strode down the side of the open area. His neck was rigid with fury. His eyes were fixed on the front doors. He was ignoring the fat police chief. He walked straight past the reception counter and out through the heavy door into the bright afternoon. [MASK] followed him.
<name>She</name>	She	Judy	“What happened to him?” she asked. It was a simple question. Deserved a simple answer. “He was shot in the head,” I lied. “Died instantly.” [MASK] nodded. Like she wasn’t surprised. “When?” she asked.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Hubble	Thirty-six years of bad luck and trouble were wiped away in one single bright glance. The gods were sitting on my shoulder, whooping and driving me on. In that one single bright glance, I knew that I had won. Because the children were asleep on the office floor. [MASK]’s kids.
<name>Spenser</name>	Spenser	Finlay	[MASK] pushed off the statue and started walking back north. “I got to make some calls,” he said. “Time to go to work on this thing.” “Walk slow,” I said. “I haven’t finished yet.”
<name>Griggs</name>	Griggs	Teale	But don’t worry, they’re not going to gun us down in the middle of the squad room. They’ll go for somewhere quiet and isolated, probably at night. [MASK]’s the only bad guy up there, so just don’t be on your own with him.
<name>She</name>	She	Roscoe	The thunderstorm was finally breaking outside. The rain was lashing the little house. Lightning was blazing and the thunder was crashing about. We finally made it to the shower. By then, we really needed it. Afterward I lay on the bed while [MASK] dressed.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Teale	I said. She dumped the stack of paper onto a cabinet top. Dusted herself off and flicked her hair back. Glanced at the door. “Couple of things,” she said. “[MASK]’s got a Foundation board meeting in ten minutes.
<name>He</name>	He	Finlay	We ran them an hour ago and something may come of that, if we’re lucky.” “Gunshot wounds?” I asked him. [MASK] nodded. “Looks like the same gun,” he said. “Small-caliber, soft-nose shells.
<name>Armitage</name>	Armitage	Joe	Sat down at a desk. The desk nearest to the file room door. We walked past him into the rosewood office. Sat down to wait it out. I pulled [MASK]’s tom printout from my pocket and passed it across the desk.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Stevenson	[MASK] still stared at me as the car slowed to yaw into the approach to the station house. A wide semicircle of driveway. I read on a low masonry sign: Margrave Police Headquarters. I thought: should I be worried? I was under arrest.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Hubble	In the service we used to say: do it once and do it right. Tonight I was going to add: and do it quickly. “[MASK]?” I said. “I need your help.” He roused himself and looked over at me.
<name>She</name>	She	Judy	“At midnight. Did he say where he was going on Thursday night?” [MASK] shook her head. “He never told me much,” she said. “Did he ever mention meeting an investigator?”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Charlie	“I’ll do that, [MASK]. But like I say, don’t expect miracles. I think we’re looking at something very bad here.” “I think he’s alive,” she said. “I would know if he wasn’t.”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Gray	SPUN HIS BARBER CHAIR TO FACE mine. “The Kliner Foundation is bogus,’’ he said. “Totally bogus. It’s a cover for something else. It’s all here. [MASK] bust it wide open. Audited it from top to bottom.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Finlay	Stay there with them and wait. [MASK], come back here. Do it now. Do it quietly.” I pulled out the Desert Eagle and clicked the safety off. Clamped my wrist against the door frame and aimed across the office at the inner door.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Finlay	[MASK] asked. “Was there a problem with the truck?” “There was one major problem,” I said. “The truck was empty.” There was silence in the office for a long moment. “It was going back empty?”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Reacher	Jumped down next to it. It was a battered, well-traveled bag. Scuffed and scratched. Lots of airline tags all over it. There was a little nameplate in the shape of a miniature gold credit card fastened to the handle. It said: [MASK].
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Roscoe	Unfolded it carefully. It was a sheet of computer paper. The top inch had been torn off the right-hand comer. Half the heading had been left behind. It said: Operation E Unum. “Operation E Unum Pluribus,” [MASK] said.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Baker	“I suppose you’re going to say you never heard of this guy?” he asked me. “Never heard of him,” I said. He glared at me briefly. Turned back to [MASK]. “You better go on out and bring this Hubble guy in,” he said.
<name>Could</name>	Could	Ca	“He’s got me marked down as a token and an idiot. Not to be promoted further. Makes sense in a way. [MASK]n’t believe they gave me the job in the first place, token or not.” I waved to the counter guy for the check.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Roscoe	[MASK] killed the motor and we sat for a minute. Didn’t want to get out. We squeezed hands, her right, my left. A brief good luck gesture. We got out of the car. Into battle. THE STATION HOUSE WAS COOL AND DESERTED EXCEPT FOR
<name>They</name>	They	Spirenza	Two of them were attacking him commercially. The other six were threatening to close him down. [MASK] pulled him apart. Turned him inside out. He was on his back for a year. The paperwork in my hand was a testimony to that.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Readier	he said. “Where?” I glanced across at him. “In the Stollers’ garage,” I said. “Christ’s sake, [MASK],” he said. “It got burned down. And there was nothing in it, right?
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Picard	Thrusting my hands deep in the pockets and stamping from foot to foot, trying to look like a guy who was getting cold standing around doing nothing. I waited until [MASK] stepped around to check the bolts were tight. He put his weight on the lever and I could hear the metal graunching.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Morrison	They had him inside because they need the chief on board. Because that’s useful to them in some particular way. So they wouldn’t waste [MASK] unless they had a replacement ready. And whoever it is, we’re looking at a very dangerous guy.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Finlay	I shook my head. [MASK] was one very cautious guy. “What about the dead guy?” I said. “Did you run his prints again?” She concentrated on passing a farm truck. The first vehicle we’d seen in a quarter hour.
<name>Camilla</name>	Camilla	Roscoe	Just enough moonlight to pick it out. [MASK] pulled up where I showed her. I kissed her and got out. Told her I’d see her up at the hotel. Slapped lightly on the Chevy’s roof and waved her off. She turned in the road.
<name>Freedom</name>	Freedom	Finlay	Ran over to the car and dove in. I started it up and howled backward out of the lot. Slammed into drive and took off down the road toward town. [MASK] was out. Ninety seconds, beginning to end.
<name>He</name>	He	Blake	Didn’t see them. Just crashed into the white boy. A white boy, maybe ten years old, maybe twelve. [MASK] sent him flying into the dirt. White boy cut his head on a stone, set up such a hollering like you never heard.
<name>John</name>	John	Finlay	They’re feeding it into the cash flows in the big cities. It’s an international counterfeit money distribution network. It’s obvious, [MASK].” “Is it?” he said. “Of course it is,” she said again.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Finlay	‘‘What did he tell you about it?” “He didn’t tell me diddly,” I said. “Like I told you, we hardly spoke.” [MASK] glared at me from the front seat.
<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Roscoe	I tucked it under my arm and nodded to [MASK]. She rolled the drawer shut and locked it again. “Thanks,” I said. “Now make those calls, OK?” I walked down to the entrance and levered the heavy glass door open with my back.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Hubble	Don’t give me that shit.” [MASK] looked down at the floor. Thought for a moment. “I can’t explain it,” he said. “I can’t say anything about it. I just need to know what happens next.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Finlay	So I said, what money? He said a thousand bucks. He said all the merchants get it. So I figured he meant some kind of a business grant, a thousand bucks a year, right?’ ’ [MASK] nodded. Seemed about right to him.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Picard	Screamed and yelled out loud. [MASK] was gone. IT WAS DARK WHEN I HIT THE OUTLYING AUGUSTA SUBURBS. I pulled off the highway as soon as the taller buildings started to thicken up. Drove down the city streets and stopped at the first motel I saw.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Kliner	He had two Hispanic guys there with him. There was this other guy chained up in a back room. [MASK] said this was a guy who had stepped out of line. He told me to watch carefully. His son just kicked the guy to a pulp.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Roscoe	“Probably,” [MASK] said. “He had a file on just about everything. Somebody spat on the sidewalk, he’d put it in a file.” I nodded. Stepped back to the bed and picked up the phone.
<name>Janet</name>	Janet	Roscoe	HE WAS CONVINCED. THEN HE SMILED. HE stood up from the bench in the barbershop window and took [MASK]’s hand. Shook it very formally. “Good work,” he said to her. “A perfect analysis.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Finlay	I said. He smiled. Changed it to a grimace as a tendon graunched. “I’ll live,” he said. [MASK] got out and joined us in the alley. He was coming round. He was stretching like he was waking up. Getting excited.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Picard	He had his heavy cane in his left hand. But in his right hand he was carrying a police-issue shotgun. It was an Ithaca Mag-10. Didn’t really matter where he was pointing it. “Get over there,” [MASK] said to me again.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Hubble	It was a fire lane guide. I guessed it must lead outside, but we were going in the wrong direction. Into the prison, not out of it. We followed the red line through corridors, up stairs and around comers. [MASK] first, then me.
<name>Andrea</name>	Andrea	Hubble	“And you closed that down?” I said. “Why?” “Too expensive,” he said. “Big overhead, small margin. It had to go.” “And [MASK] was a part of that?” I asked him.
<name>Marvin</name>	Marvin	Spivey	They would ask, who put you here? I would say [MASK], the top boy. They would say, well that’s OK then, right? So the only plan was no plan. Wait and see. React accordingly. Objective, survival until Monday.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Banker	One was a pair of ski gloves. Lime green and lilac. Not much good to me. I wanted something dark. The other pair was what I wanted. Dressy things in thin black leather. [MASK]’s gloves. Very soft. Like a second skin.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Finlay	“Maybe an inch taller, maybe ten pounds lighter.” “That would make him what, about six-six?” he asked. “Right,” I said. “About two hundred pounds, maybe.” [MASK] wrote it all down.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Hubble	Understaffed and harassed. Ushering the short-stay guests around by himself. With a- shotgun in his big red farmer’s hands. He studied his clipboard. “Which one of you is [MASK]?” he asked. He had a high-pitched voice.
<name>Arnie</name>	Arnie	Morrison	Too old, not vigorous enough. And he wasn’t the gofer. That was [MASK]. But if he starts messing with me, then he’s in deep shit. Otherwise, to hell with him.” “So what now?” she said.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Molly	He shouldered backward toward the doors to wait for her. Then it seemed like just about any of the women could be [MASK]. There must have been a couple of dozen candidates. There were blondes and brunettes, tall ones, short ones, pretty ones, homely ones.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Hubble	Half of the shattered handcuff dangled from his wrist. Like a silver bracelet. [MASK] sat upright. He hadn’t done this before. He just fidgeted around, burning energy. Couldn’t blame him. He kept looking over at me. Questions in his eyes.
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Spivey	Pointed to an empty cell. We crowded in. [MASK] swung the bars shut behind us. They locked automatically. He walked away. The cell was very dark. I could just about see a bunk bed, a sink and a john. Not much floor space.
<name>Alex</name>	Alex	Hubble	The bus was empty. The driver directed [MASK] into a seat. He slid over the vinyl to the window. I was pulled alongside. The driver knelt on the seat in front and clicked our outer wrists to the chromium hoop which ran across the top.
<name>Gruber</name>	Gruber	Picard	Swept it up off the hot concrete and shot [MASK] through the back of the head. His skull exploded under the impact of the huge bullet. His legs crumpled and he started falling. I fired my last four shells into him before he hit the floor.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Hubble	He scuttled backward to the rear of the cell. Tried to hide behind the john. He was practically hugging the pan. Time to intervene. Not for [MASK]. I felt nothing for him. But I had to intervene for myself.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Finlay	The one you told me about? Could you use his office as a kind of private facility?” [MASK] thought about it. Nodded. “Not a bad idea,” he said. “I’ll have to go off the record.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Joe	“Older or younger?” “Older,” I said. I gave him [MASK]’s date of birth. “Two years older than me.” “So he was thirty-eight?” I nodded.
<name>Bukowski</name>	Bukowski	Baker	“Why don’t you just call it up and see who answers?” They hadn’t thought of that. There was another silence. They were embarrassed. They didn’t want to look at each other. Or me. Silence. [MASK] bailed out of the situation.
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Judy	It was a traffic violation in his truck. A lawyer came to help him out.” [MASK] shrugged, like two years ago was ancient history to her. “There are lawyers sniffing everywhere, right?” she said. “No big deal.”
<name>Jackson</name>	Jackson	Finlay	Movement and scraping, muffled to a dull boom by the huge space. I took a deep breath. Motioned the others to flatten themselves against the metal siding. I still wasn’t sure about exterior guards. My gut said there wouldn’t be any reinforcements. But [MASK] was worried about it.
<name>Hayden</name>	Hayden	Roscoe	Stood in front of the bars. Where [MASK] had stood. “I need to go to the bathroom,” I said. “Unless I got to wait until I get up to the big house for that, too?” He cracked a grin.
<name>Chigurh</name>	Chigurh	Roscoe	Walked in and found a bathroom. Wrapped the Buick keys in a paper towel and dropped them in the garbage. Then I slipped down to the arrivals hall and stepped out into the damp night again. Caught the hotel courtesy bus and rode off to meet [MASK].
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Teale	His face and body betrayed nothing. He was like a statue hewn from teak. But his eyes burned with a kind of cruel energy. They sneered at me out of his blank, bone-hard face. [MASK] rattled open a drawer in the rosewood desk.
<name>Griggs</name>	Griggs	Spivey	I moved the blade a fraction closer to his big red face. “Want me to use this on you?” I said. [MASK] looked around wildly. Saw the gate guard thirty yards away. “He’s not going to help you,” I said.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Roscoe	The water was bright blue in the sun. I could smell the chlorine hanging in the hot air. “Some place,” [MASK] said. I nodded. I was wondering if my brother had been there. “I hear a car,” she said.
<name>Wesley</name>	Wesley	Picard	The smaller guy had his khaki raincoat on. I nodded amiably to the two of them. I figured they had less than an hour to live. They strolled over and stood with [MASK] in a knot of three.
