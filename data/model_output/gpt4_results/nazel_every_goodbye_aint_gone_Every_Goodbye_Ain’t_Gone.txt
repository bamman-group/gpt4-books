<name>Shanice</name>	Shanice	Ruth	“You know I ain’t got time to be going to no school.” “I’ll be right back,” he said, feeling obligated to say something before he left. “You think she’s better than me, don’t you?” [MASK] asked.
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Amos	“But with all that work,” [MASK] went on, nodding to the little boy, “the boy still didn’t have much money at all and he had ran out of things to sell, especially because he wouldn’t spend his money on much of anything in the first place.
<name>Cadillacs</name>	Cadillacs	Cadillacs	Went all through the thing like I was runnin’ drugs or something.” “You know a nigger ain’t s’posed to drive no Cadillac,” the round-faced man yelled from the table. “White folks have always been suspicious of niggers that be drivin’ [MASK].
<name>Rosie</name>	Rosie	Ruth	He’s got things to do and he doesn’t need to do any of them with you.” “What’s a matter,” [MASK] burbled and fell back in her chair, “he too good for a project woman?”
<name>He</name>	He	Pike	Wasn’t like he believed in no communism or no radical stuff like that. He jus’ had his own way of doing things, like when the river flooded the county, damn near washing away everybody and everything in its way.” “What did [MASK] do?”
<name>Cherry</name>	Cherry	Butch	Had they changed? Would they accept the changes in him? “[MASK] asks about you all the time.” “I thought I’d just kind of lay around, you know, until I could figure out what I’m going to do with myself.”
<name>Jeeter</name>	Jeeter	Amos	By the time his thirtieth birthday rolled around, he had saved up enough money to put a downpayment on poverty. And he was mad.” [MASK] gummed down a piece of hot-water com bread and swigged from a jug that always appeared when he did, then continued.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Cracker	Got something for the first one steps out of line with me. [MASK] put his white-ass hands on me and he’ll beat me to the Devil’s door.” “But you won’t be but a half a step behin’, nigger.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Nigger	That’s the natural way of it. Fair exchange ain’t never been no robbery. I’m tellin’ you what I know.” “[MASK], you ain’t no different than any other body. You scared, too.
<name>David</name>	David	Mable	It was a woman. Her voice was shaken, excited. He didn’t detect any pain, any horror, and it bothered him. He heard his mother. “[MASK] was just telling me what happened just now.” And he heard and felt her pain.
<name>Ramesh</name>	Ramesh	Barney	[MASK] was an actor who had achieved some acclaim among his “skin-fellows” by playing the parts of natives and servants and drivers and slaves in some major motion pictures. He had always aspired to more, to meatier, more meaningful roles.
<name>Jed</name>	Jed	Amos	“I knowed this fella once,” [MASK] started, taking on peculiar shape over his toothless gums, “nice fella as I recall, but he had one serious problem— he loved money more than anything else in life.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Mable	“I know what you mean. They’re always fighting. I don’t know why that young girl got herself messed up with that thing in the first place.” “Just weak-minded,” [MASK] said.
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Ruth	“They should be ready by now,” his mother said and then shot, in an even tone, “[MASK], sit down and finish your drink. He’s got things to do and he doesn’t need to do any of them with you.”
<name>Henrietta</name>	Henrietta	Mable	“They asking everybody who want to git on television and say something. I’d a said something to him myself but I didn’t see nothin’. I was to the store cashing my check I sure wish I had been there.” “Girl, I was there!” [MASK] exploded.
<name>Shaniqua</name>	Shaniqua	Mable	"Why the baby?" “That thang caught her with the baby’s father,” [MASK] said. “The girl brought the baby’s father into the apartment thinking that thang had gone to work. But that thang doubled back and caught them in the bed together.”
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Nigger	“[MASK], you couldn’t cut your way out of a pile of toilet paper with a straight razor,” fired the round-faced man, who impatiently watched the empty table, the faces of his opponents, and the dominoes he held in his hands.
<name>Yellow</name>	Yellow	Tom	[MASK] curtains sagged in the broken window. A dark face poked out from behind the curtains and bobbed for a moment like a puppet in a Punch and Judy show and then ducked back behind the curtains. Was it a face he should know? He was home.
<name>Shoulda</name>	Shoulda	Should’a	No tellin ’ what I would have goin ’ for me if I hadn’t been saddled with your black ass. You don’t look nothing like me no way. Probably ain’t even mine. [MASK] flushed yo’ narrow ass down the toilet when I had the chance. ”
<name>Roark</name>	Roark	Jenkins	[MASK] grunted. His fingernails had tom through his worn shirt and were digging into his flesh. “This coon is heavy.” “Put him on the table.” He felt himself being hoisted onto a hospital table. A hooded light hung over the table.
<name>Ruth</name>	Ruth	Bitch	“I ain’t ’shamed of none of my chil’ren. And you can bet they all know who they daddies is.” “[MASK], what you tryin’ to say? You got something to say ’bout my kids you better say somethin’ nice.”
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Ruth	“Who’s gonna raise them kids?” [MASK] snapped. “You know I ain’t got time to be going to no school.” “I’ll be right back,” he said, feeling obligated to say something before he left.
<name>Tyrone</name>	Tyrone	Mable	He’s a man. Why didn’t he stop it?” “Too busy tryin’ to save his own ass,” [MASK] said. “He ran out of that apartment with his pants in his hands when that thang snuck back in and caught them.
<name>Sonny</name>	Sonny	Mable	“They already done took that she-he away in the pohleece car. She didn’t say nothin’. Just went along with them like they was gon’ take her for a ride in the park.” “That thang is crazy,” [MASK] said.
<name>Slick</name>	Slick	Nigger	“If I had a just one rock a bit ago. I’d a made you eat them sixes.” “[MASK], if you was a broad, you’d be a whore who give up the money every time a bone drop.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Pike	he felt like a scratched record. “What did [MASK] do?" The beer came, and they both drank in silence. The drunk belched, smiled, and then took a cigarette from the pack on the table between them.
<name>They</name>	They	Worker	“My check’s gonna be late. [MASK] come tellin’ me they cut me off ’cause they didn’t get them damn papers back on time. Like it was my fault or something. My sister was s’posed to drop them off.”
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Raygun	“That’s awful chilly, brother. Why you want to do me that way? That’s a cold way to do a brother, ’specially wit’ [MASK] trying to keep a nigger poor. Why don’t you git off of something, you know?
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Amos	There was a wicked gleam in [MASK]’s eyes. “He got hungry like he ain’t never been before in his whole life, even when he had to eat that dog food. Now there was birds and berries and rabbits and other such good eatin’ all around him.
<name>Easy</name>	Easy	Nigger	What kind of people are you?” “[MASK], you best to watch how you talkin’,” an angry voice threatened. “You can git yo’ ass kicked talkin’ bad.” “Why didn’t you kick the ass that murdered that baby?
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Marvetta	“[MASK], you do like I tol’ you. I don’t want no mo’ of yo’ back sass. Ain’t nothin’ wrong with this water.” The younger woman disappeared into the apartment. He stared at the old woman until she noticed him.
<name>Guys</name>	Guys	Mable	He heard new voices. “[MASK], television cameras are all over the place,” someone who had just come into the apartment said in a hurried voice. “Channel seven, channel four, channel two, all of them. Saw the trucks myself.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Malcolm	“Or is about to see a ghost!” “Bet he’ll piss on himself, scared as he is!” The tiny voice jeered from its perch at the back of his head: “[MASK] didn’t piss on himself!
<name>Jackie</name>	Jackie	Jackie	“He knew what he was doing. He knew that if he fought back..., well, put it this way, niggers didn’t live long back in those days if they fought back at the wrong time. Besides, [MASK] wanted to play baseball.
<name>Junior</name>	Junior	Nigger	A no-man’s-land run by children with deep voices? “[MASK], you can’t handle nothin’ like that. Takes a real man, home, to make a broad like that scream.” He stiffened his back against their laughter, which pummeled him.
<name>Yasha</name>	Yasha	Ruth	“[MASK],” his mother said to the woman, who swallowed down a mouthful of vodka and belched, “this is my son. He’s been working down south for the last....” “You done tol’ me enough about him so’s
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Martin	[MASK] managed to hold his water!” But where were they now? “Come on, let’s just whip the coon some more and take him on to the crazy house! That’ll teach him good.” “I’m going through with what we planned.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Barney	And then one day [MASK] went mad, they say, went mad on the set of a movie and screeched out that he was as good as anyone there, except for his eyes. His eyes kept him from working regularly, and he plucked them out and tossed them to the casting director.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Limbo	He crossed to the night stand, folded the papers that released him from the custody of [MASK] into a neat square, and stuffed them into the back pocket of his jeans. Taking his pack of cigarettes, he went downstairs to breakfast, though he had no taste for food.
<name>Mrs. Dalloway</name>	Mrs. Dalloway	Mable	It’s almost as if the same thing happens over and over. But I just can’t seem to get used to it happening, especially when children are involved. Nothing seems to grow right in the Gardens.” “I blame that young girl,” [MASK] said.
<name>Uncle Remus</name>	Uncle Remus	Amos	On some nights, he confessed, it took him stops at three or four different shacks to “git fed and liquored properly.” No one ever denied [MASK], even when he was not in the mood to tell stories, which was seldom.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Mack	You ain’t been in no church since [MASK] got killed in the parking lot.” “A man don’t have to run in and out of no restaurant to know that they serve food,” the barber said glibly, and there was a subtle threat in his tone.
<name>Shirley</name>	Shirley	Mable	“Channel seven, channel four, channel two, all of them. Saw the trucks myself. And you know that cute announcer with the curly hair, he’s out there asking everybody questions about what happened.” “You kidding, girl,” [MASK] said.
<name>Cadillacs</name>	Cadillacs	Benzes	And it was noted, in yearly celebrations, that the “Big Burn of ’65” triggered a flood of dollars designed to smother the ghetto infernos, slumbering and smoldering in reach of white suburbia. Botany 500 replaced dashikis, [MASK] nosed out Volkswagens, and upward mobility became the new battle cry.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Elmo	[MASK] fell silent, momentarily comforted by his memories. The Blue Bird Bar and Grill wasn’t a fashionable place. In fact, except for the jukebox and the ceiling fan, the bar had little to offer by way of atmosphere.
<name>Shorty</name>	Shorty	Nigger	“Ain’t no God,” a short man called, then slammed a domino onto the table with, “Play behind that rock if you can.” “[MASK], who told you that?” the barber snapped, and the clippers were silent again.
<name>Chappie</name>	Chappie	Kingman	[MASK] was dangerous. Everyone said that. He had killed his entire family—wife, two sons, and four daughters—fearing that his home was about to be attacked by the white-sheeted Klan and that his family might fall victim to a more brutal death.
<name>Shug</name>	Shug	Mable	And he heard and felt her pain. “I was there,” [MASK] said. “I just come back from over there,” the newcomer puffed, out of breath. “It’s awful, girl. Blood all on the side of the building.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Elmo	“Awww, leave me the hell alone. You talkin’ crazy!” He felt better after his trip to the outhouse behind the bar. [MASK] greeted him with a drunken nod and slipped back into his silent reverie.
<name>Jedediah</name>	Jedediah	Pike	“When the river busted over the levees, folks thought it was the end until they remembered [MASK]’s Mountain, which is the only high ground in these parts.” He swallowed down another mouthful of beer and puffed contentedly on the soggy end of his cigarette.
<name>Brer</name>	Brer	Amos	[MASK]’s storytelling visits lasted as long as the liquor and the food was available. On some nights, he confessed, it took him stops at three or four different shacks to “git fed and liquored properly.”
<name>Latisha</name>	Latisha	Mable	“I hear she chased the baby’s daddy away with a gun when he came by to see the baby after it was bom.” “It’s true,” [MASK] said. “It’s true. I saw it. I was there, girl.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Mable	But you know how some of these young girls is.” “She ain’t but seventeen,” the second woman interjected. “Just seventeen and in all this mess.” “She asked for it,” [MASK] smacked, obviously angry at the interference.
<name>Jackie</name>	Jackie	Jackie	“[MASK] was great, but there were so many others who didn’t get a chance at all.” “Who you tellin’?” the barber said. “Ain’t I seen some of those Negro League teams play?
<name>Together</name>	Together	Solemnly	[MASK], even self-righteously, they peered from their windows, paced the tangle of littered walks and ruts worn in unkempt lawns, and indicted fellow inmates for their mutual confinement. Some found a way to make their homes there.
<name>Who</name>	Who	Nigger	What the hell is the matter with you people?” “[MASK] who the hell you think you talkin' to?” came from one of the dark faces, he wasn’t sure which; tears scalded his cheeks, stung his eyes, and he couldn’t see.
<name>Jackie</name>	Jackie	Jackie	I remember where they threw black cats out on the field and called him nigger and stuff like that. He had guts.” The barber clicked off his clippers and offered, “Base runners used to slide into second base with their spikes up when [MASK] was on the bag.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Ruth	“[MASK],” his mother started, her voice showing her irritation, “you know what you have to do, so don’t blame anyone else because you didn’t feel like taking those papers down to the welfare office yourself. Those are your children.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Limbo	Waxen and pale, the faces he met in [MASK]’s day room were a horror show of contorted facial muscles. Glazed eyes peered suspiciously from behind droopy lids. Words, often unintelligible sounds, oozed, plopped, spittled from lips grotesquely misshapen by involuntary muscle spasms.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Ruth	A twinge of guilt made him lower his eyes and he started out of the kitchen with, “I’ll get another bottle on the way back.” “You know just what to say,” [MASK] bellowed and then laughed loudly to herself.
<name>Who</name>	Who	Earthquake	I didn’t hear what you said.” “There’s an awful lot of broken glass and boarded windows. [MASK]?” “Kids!” “That bad?” “Only when they throw Molotov cocktails or shoot the windows out.” “That bad!”
<name>Jerome</name>	Jerome	Nehemiah	“Where?” he had asked. “To the end, or the beginning, depending on which way you trying to go.” “Of the river?!” “Naw, fool!” [MASK] had countered. “The river’s got no end.
<name>Git</name>	Git	NIGGER	Well, I hope you’re satisfied. You got yourself a professional ass-whup-pin ’ and some Limbo time. I guess, all things considered, that beats dangling from a tree limb and dancing over fire. [MASK], GIT HOT!!!!
<name>Queenie</name>	Queenie	Mable	Even let some of his drunk friends get a little bit.” “I’d kill any man of mine that come puttin’ his hands on any one of my babies,” [MASK] threatened. “Niggers ain’t nothin’ but the lowest kind of dog.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Limbo	“Jus’a minute.” Lighting a cigarette, he fought for control, for space, and shifted nervously on the concrete slab porch, feeling much like he had felt when he had emerged from the solitude of his cell and entered [MASK]’s day room for the first time.
<name>Virgil</name>	Virgil	Coon	Federals ready to jump into a white man’s business every time one of these coons gets a nosebleed.” “[MASK].” The deputy jammed the barrel of the gun against his temple. “Where’s the en-double-ass-cee-pee?
<name>Sweet</name>	Sweet	Mable	I’d tell him everything he want to know, and a few things that I got on my mind.” “I know what you got on yo’ mind,” [MASK] laughed. “But it ain’t nothin’ he gon’ want to hear.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Ruth	He said nothing and walked out the front door, tingling under a barrage of angry, unintelligible words spewing from [MASK] like the debris from a broken dam. What had he done? Should he have allowed her to...to...to do whatever the hell she felt, because she felt like it?
<name>Roaches</name>	Roaches	Roaches	At least not on the first. I got me some other plans. They’ll just have to wait until I get my check on the fifteenth.” “My refrigerator ain’t worked in a month.” “[MASK] is taking over my apartment.”
<name>Calpurnia</name>	Calpurnia	Mable	“Why didn’t someone do something before it came to this?” “Wasn’t nothin’ nobody could do,” [MASK] explained as if privy to information unavailable to anyone else. “I know. I even tried to talk to the girl, you know.
<name>Earl</name>	Earl	Nigger	she screamed. “[MASK], git off of me and quit touching me!” There was no “skinship” between them. He bolted up from the seat as if snakebit and hoped the effort did not affect the delicate control he had over his swollen bladder.
<name>Clarence</name>	Clarence	G’on	“[MASK] and cut that young brother’s hair and stay out the conversation,” someone laughed. “Much as you got to say about religion, you should have been a preacher instead of a barber.” The clippers buzzed to life.
<name>Muslims</name>	Muslims	Muslims	The man with the bean pies hung in the doorway for a moment, then ducked back outside with, “I’ll have ’em for you next time.” “[MASK] is something else,” the barber muttered. “They can git pushy, too.
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Grandma	“You here visiting your folks?” she asked, and her eyes went opaque like dried drops of milk. “No..., I mean, yes, ma’am. [MASK] and grandpa, you know,” he said and waddled backwards away from the cold stare.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Mable	“That man/woman was thinking about that welfare money,” [MASK] said, matter-of-factly. “That’s what kind she is. She took up with the girl right after the girl got pregnant. Talked her into taking that apartment.”
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Amos	But him bein’ a city boy he didn’t recognize what was good eatin’ like you children know how to do.” [MASK] drank and took a long pause while the rapt audience waited impatiently, the sounds of the night providing an appropriate score for the tale.
<name>Gramps</name>	Gramps	Pike	Maybe he was crazy, but it didn’t matter; he made more sense than many of the people he had met. “The river was here first,” [MASK] had told him. “It was here first and it’s got a mind of its own.
<name>Orpheus</name>	Orpheus	Limbo	A ictures of [MASK] tramped through his head, pictures of shuffling figures slipping out of their orbits creating a chain reaction of confusion. But he knew there were no men in crisp white uniforms who would rush out and dispense potent tranquilizers to restore order— or at least submission—and quiet compliance.
<name>Tim</name>	Tim	Nobody’ll	“Naw! I never said that I was going to help you to...to kill the coon. I thought we was just going to mess him up a little, teach him a good lesson....” “[MASK] miss this one. He’s crazy.
<name>Bobby</name>	Bobby	Custer	But naaaw, you had to stand your ground—remember [MASK]? Blue eyes and blonde hair didn’t save his ass when the shit got bad. That should have told you that a cotton-headed spade sho ’ didn’t have a chance facing no white Indians.
<name>Voices</name>	Voices	Sirens	[MASK] were screaming all around, and the rush of people towards the tragedy had not abated. From the kitchen he heard the women talking, rerunning old horror stories. “Ain’t the first time a baby’s been killed or hurt.
<name>Zero</name>	Zero	Rabbit	That time when the fear of exploding from an overload of hand-me-down shit is stronger than any fears yet experienced. Face it, and grow! But first, here’s a little piss to christen the ground. Sincerely Yours, [MASK] ONE Born Again
<name>Alvin</name>	Alvin	brutha	His heart raced, tripped, flipped. He heard and felt the threat in the little man’s voice, and his eyes searched for an escape route that wasn’t there. “Stop a minute, [MASK]. I want to talk at you a minute.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ruth	What had he done? Should he have allowed her to...to...to do whatever the hell she felt, because she felt like it? What was expected of him? And what was [MASK]’s problem? Her children? Her lack of education?
<name>Easy</name>	Easy	Ruth	He looked away from the gaunt woman, who seemed a sexless skeleton, someone dressed in sagging pants and a halter top who had nothing to hide. “What’s hap’nin’, [MASK]?” he muttered, nodded, and then said to his mother, “I’m going to get a haircut.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Pike	Though it sure ain’t nowhere near as hot as it was back in....” “Two more beers,” he called to the bartender, then turned back to the drunk and said “What about [MASK]? What did he do that caused so much trouble?”
<name>Squeaky</name>	Squeaky	Negroes	His wife tried to knock one side of his head off with a hot iron. And even [MASK]’ hair ain’t the same. Some got long stringy hair. Some got the kind of hair that beads up in little tight balls like b.b.s for a toy gun.
<name>Doctor</name>	Doctor	Pike	The footpath that wound to the top of [MASK]’s Mountain began where Little Cotton Road curved away from the Quarters and passed by a series of stately relics of pre-Civil-War architecture where some of the prominent members of the faculty of the colored college across the river made their homes.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Easter	And I got to buy [MASK] clothes for them kids out of the little money I get. They crazy up there in the welfare building if they think folks can live off the little they give up.” “You got that right, girl.
<name>Rooster</name>	Rooster	Weell	so’s I know him like I’d know one of my own niggers.” She paused, leered at him, and added, “[MASK], maybe not as good as I know one of my own niggers, not just yet.”
<name>Tina</name>	Tina	Mable	“I just come back from over there,” the newcomer puffed, out of breath. “It’s awful, girl. Blood all on the side of the building. And that baby laying there all....” “I was there!" [MASK] cut her off.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Ruth	Why did his mother waste her time with [MASK]? Were drinking partners that hard to come by? A twinge of guilt made him lower his eyes and he started out of the kitchen with, “I’ll get another bottle on the way back.”
<name>Leon</name>	Leon	Ruth	“You know where to take it.” “Same place?” “It’s all filled out. Just drop it off.” “They gonna have to wait for they rent,” [MASK] said sourly. “My check’s gonna be late.
<name>Snip</name>	Snip	Buzzzzz	[MASK], went the clippers. “Give you the same haircut every time, too. I know my job. Can tell who a person is just by rubbing them on the head. Lumps on the head is just like fingerprints sometimes.”
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Nehemiah	“How much time?” “I don’t know how much time!” [MASK] didn’t like questions. He said what he had to say and questions would not coax any more from him, unless he had planned to say it anyway.
<name>Blues</name>	Blues	Tar	They could segregate but they could not be separated. A coarse voice broke out into a mellow blues. A guitar twanged sharply from somewhere. The moans subsided. Woke up this mawnin’. [MASK] was runnin’ all ’round my bed.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Elmo	In fact, except for the jukebox and the ceiling fan, the bar had little to offer by way of atmosphere. He stared at [MASK] and then excused himself from the table, saying, “Got to take a leak.” The toilet was out back.
<name>Skeeter</name>	Skeeter	Mable	“[MASK], if I was you and seen what you seen. I’d be right there talkin’ to that cute announcer. I’d tell him everything he want to know, and a few things that I got on my mind.”
<name>Jackie</name>	Jackie	Jackie	But [MASK] took it. Didn’t start no trouble. Just kept quiet and played the best damn baseball white folks had ever seen.” “He didn’t do nothin’?” the lean man in the felt hat gasped. “He didn’t fight back?”
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Nigger	From above he yelled down in a scratchy voice, “Cut that out!” and was immediately sorry. The gunman swirled, stood, and pointed the gun at the bedroom window. “[MASK], what you got to say about this?! Huh?!”
