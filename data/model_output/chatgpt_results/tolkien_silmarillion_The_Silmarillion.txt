<name>Morgoth</name>	Morgoth	Ungoliant	I name them unto myself for ever.’ But [MASK] had grown great, and he less by the power that had gone out of him; and she rose against him, and her cloud closed about him, and she enmeshed him in a web of clinging thongs to strangle him.
<name>Gandalf</name>	Gandalf	Mithrandir	Indeed in a second darkness it will end, unless some strange chance deliver us that my eyes cannot see.’ ‘Many are the strange chances of the world,’ said [MASK], ‘and help oft shall come from the hands of the weak when the Wise falter.’
<name>Eru</name>	Eru	Darkness	‘And out of it the world was made. For [MASK] alone is worshipful, and the Lord thereof may yet make other worlds to be gifts to those that serve him, so that the increase of their power shall find no end.’
<name>Fëanor</name>	Fëanor	Feanor	But these held their peace and spoke not against their fathers. At length after long debate [MASK] prevailed, and the greater part of the Noldor there assembled he set aflame with the desire of new things and strange countries.
<name>Aragorn</name>	Aragorn	Elros	But to [MASK], who chose to be a king of Men, still a great span of years was allotted, many times that of the Men of Middle-earth; and all his line, the kings and lords of the royal house, had long life even according to the measure of the Numenoreans.
<name>Thomas More</name>	Thomas More	Elendil	‘Would you then betray the King?’ said [MASK]. ‘For you know well the charge that they make against us, that we are traitors and spies, and that until this day it has been false.’
<name>Gothmog</name>	Gothmog	Morgoth	The cry of [MASK] in that hour was the greatest and most dreadful that was ever heard in the northern world; the mountains shook, and the earth trembled, and rocks were riven asunder. Deep in forgotten places that cry was heard.
<name>Prometheus</name>	Prometheus	Hurin	When therefore he judged the time to be ripe, he released [MASK] from his bondage, bidding him go whither he would; and he feigned that in this he was moved by pity as for an enemy utterly defeated.
<name>Yavanna</name>	Yavanna	Yavanna	Then the seeds that [MASK] had sown began swiftly to sprout and to burgeon, and there arose a multitude of growing things great and small, mosses and grasses and great ferns, and trees whose tops were crowned with cloud as they were living mountains, but whose feet were wrapped in a green twilight.
<name>Ilúvatar</name>	Ilúvatar	Melkor	And most often from among the Faithful they chose their victims; yet never openly on the charge that they would not worship [MASK], the Giver of Freedom, rather was cause sought against them that they hated the King and were his rebels, or that they plotted against their kin, devising lies and poisons.
<name>Prince Oberyn</name>	Prince Oberyn	Finarfin	For this ring was like to twin serpents, whose eyes were emeralds, and their heads met beneath a crown of golden flowers, that the one upheld and the other devoured; that was the badge of [MASK] and his house.
<name>Beren</name>	Beren	Angrist	Then he drew forth the knife [MASK]; and from the iron claws that held it he cut a Silmaril. As he closed it in his hand, the radiance welled through his living flesh, and his hand became as a shin- ing lamp; but the jewel suffered his touch and hurt him not.
<name>Turin</name>	Turin	Elf	See now! I offer thee freedom. Go to thy kin, if thou canst. Get thee gone! And if [MASK] or Man be left to make tale of these days, then surely in scorn they will name thee, if thou spumest this gift.’
<name>Grendel</name>	Grendel	Beren	[MASK] became in all things like a werewolf to look upon, save that in his eyes there shone a spirit grim indeed but clean; and horror was in his glance as he saw upon his flank a bat-like creature clinging with creased wings.
<name>Gollum</name>	Gollum	Fingolfin	With [MASK] and his people also I will keep friendship, for they have bitterly atoned for such ill as they did. And in our hatred of the Power that wrought all this woe our griefs shall be lost. But hear my words!
<name>Eowyn</name>	Eowyn	Morwen	‘It was a dark road. I have come as I could,’ he answered. ‘But you are too late,’ said [MASK]. ‘They are lost.’ ‘I know it,’ he said. ‘But you are not.’
<name>Maedhros</name>	Maedhros	Aul6	As a child to his father, I offer to thee these things, the work of the hands which thou hast made. Do with them what thou wilt. But should I not rather destroy the work of my presumption?* Then [MASK] took up a great hammer to smite the Dwarves; and he wept.
<name>Eorl</name>	Eorl	Maglor	Who shall release us?’ ‘If none can release us,’ said [MASK], ‘then indeed the Everlasting Darkness shall be our lot, whether we keep our oath or break it; but less evil shall we do in the breaking.’
<name>Morgoth</name>	Morgoth	Morgoth	To Men [MASK] feigned pity, if any would hearken to his messages, saying that their woes came only of their servitude to the rebel Noldor, but at the hands of the rightful Lord of Middle-earth they would get honour and a just reward of valour, if they would leave rebellion.
<name>Denethor</name>	Denethor	Atanamir	But [MASK] was ill pleased with the counsel of the Messengers and gave little heed to it, and the greater part of his people followed him; for they wished still to escape death in their own day, not waiting upon hope.
<name>Sauron</name>	Sauron	Sauron	They could walk, if they would, unseen by all eyes in this world beneath the sun, and they could see things in worlds invisible to mortal men; but too often they beheld only the phantoms and delusions of [MASK].
<name>Legolas</name>	Legolas	Melian	Of his sons I hear little to my pleasure; yet they are likely to prove the deadliest foes of our foe.’ ‘Their swords and their counsels shall have two edges,’ said [MASK]; and afterwards they spoke no more of this matter.
<name>Nahar</name>	Nahar	Nahar	And Orome tamer of beasts would ride too at whiles in the darkness of the unlit forests; as a mighty hunter he came with spear and bow, pursuing to the death the monsters and fell creatures of the kingdom of Melkor, and his white horse [MASK] shone like silver in the shadows.
<name>Ilúvatar</name>	Ilúvatar	Yavanna	As yet no flower had bloomed nor any bird had sung, for these things waited still their time in the bosom of [MASK]; but wealth there was of her imagining, and nowhere more rich than in the midmost parts of the Earth, where the light of both the Lamps met and blended.
<name>Elves</name>	Elves	Yavanna	There was little peril in the lands and hills; and there new things, devised long ages before in the thought of [MASK] and sown as seed in the dark, came at last to their budding and their bloom.
<name>Grendel</name>	Grendel	Carcharoth	But [MASK] looked upon that holy jewel and was not daunted, and the devouring spirit within him awoke to sudden fire; and gaping he took suddenly the hand within his jaws, and he bit it off at the wrist.
<name>Morgoth</name>	Morgoth	Melkor	And she answered: ‘Because my heart is anxious, thinking of the days to come. All my works are dear to me. Is it not enough that [MASK] should have marred so many? Shall nothing that I have devised be free from the dominion of others?’
<name>Túrin</name>	Túrin	Feanor	But not until the End, when [MASK] shall return who perished ere the Sun was made, and sits now in the Halls of Awaiting and comes no more among his kin; not until the Sun passes and the Moon falls, shall it be known of what substance they were made.
<name>Sauron</name>	Sauron	Sauron	But for a long time he did not dare to challenge the Lords of the Sea, and he withdrew from the coasts. Yet [MASK] was ever guileful, and it is said that among those whom he ensnared with the Nine Rings three were great lords of Numendrean race.
<name>Eru</name>	Eru	Eonwe	To the Fathers of Men of the three faithful houses rich reward also was given. [MASK] came among them and taught them; and they were given wisdom and power and life more enduring than any others of mortal race have possessed.
<name>Gil-galad</name>	Gil-galad	Felagund	Of snares eluded, broken traps, The prison opening, the chain that snaps. Backwards and forwards swayed their song. Reeling and foundering, as ever more strong The chanting swelled, [MASK] fought, And all the magic and might he brought Of Elvenesse into his words.
<name>Radagast</name>	Radagast	Radagast	He gathered a great host of spies, and many of these were birds; for [MASK] lent him his aid, divining naught of his treachery, and deeming that this was but part of the watch upon the Enemy.
<name>Psyche</name>	Psyche	Aredhel	There were his smithy, and his dim halls, and such servants as he had, silent and secret as their master. And when [MASK], weary with wandering, came at last to his doors, he revealed himself; and he welcomed her, and led her into his house.
<name>Gandalf</name>	Gandalf	Turin	Then in great peril they entered in, and they found [MASK] fettered hand and foot and tied to a withered tree; and all about him knives that had been cast at him were embedded in the trunk, and he was senseless in a sleep of great weariness.
<name>Boromir</name>	Boromir	Curunir	Thus the Wise were troubled, but none as yet perceived that [MASK] had turned to dark thoughts and was already a traitor in heart: for he desired that he and no other should find the Great Ring, so that he might wield it himself and order all the world to his will.
<name>Arwen</name>	Arwen	Galadriel	Why will you not tell me more?’ ‘For that woe is past,’ said [MASK]; ‘and I would take what joy is here left, untroubled by memory. And maybe there is woe enough yet to come, though still hope may seem bright.’
<name>his sword</name>	his sword	Gurthang	For when the dragon died, his swoon left him, and he fell into a deep sleep of weariness. But the cold of the night troubled him, and the hilts of [MASK] drove into his side, and he awoke.
<name>Fëanor</name>	Fëanor	Feanor	But at that last word of [MASK]: that at the least the Nol-dor should do deeds to live in song for ever, he raised his head, as one that hears a voice far off, and he said: ‘So shall it be!
<name>Aragorn</name>	Aragorn	Sauron	But the years passed, and the King felt the shadow of death approach, as his days lengthened; and he was filled with fear and wrath. Now came the hour that [MASK] had prepared and long had awaited.
<name>Sauron</name>	Sauron	Sauron	And one by one, sooner or later, according to their native strength and to the good or evil of their wills in the beginning, they fell under the thraldom of the ring that they bore and under the domination of the One, which was [MASK]’s.
<name>Isildur</name>	Isildur	Elendil	Never again was such a host assembled, nor was there any such league of Elves and Men; for after [MASK]’s day the two kindreds became estranged. The Ruling Ring passed out of the knowledge even of the Wise in that age; yet it was not unmade.
<name>Beren</name>	Beren	Galdor	But [MASK] said: ‘Did you then dwell a year in the wild? Or did the eagles house you in their eyries? But you found food and fine raiment, and return as young princes, not as waifs of the wood.’
<name>Feanor</name>	Feanor	Rumil	In his youth, bettering the work of [MASK], he devised those letters which bear his name, and which the Eldar used ever after; and he it was who, first of the Noldor, discovered how gems greater and brighter than those of the Earth might be made with skill.
<name>Galadriel</name>	Galadriel	Elendil	Seek out the Faithful that are known still to be true, and let them join you in secret, if they are willing to go with you, and share in your design.’ ‘And what shall that design be?’ said [MASK].
<name>Arwen</name>	Arwen	Ltithien	But if you will not deny your doom, then either [MASK], being forsaken, must assuredly die alone, or she must with you challenge the fate that lies before you—hopeless, yet not certain. Further counsel I cannot give, nor may I go further on your road.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Feanor	Thou shalt lead and I will follow. May no new grief divide us.’ ‘I hear thee,’ said [MASK]. ‘So be it.’ But they did not know the meaning that their words would bear.
<name>Thor</name>	Thor	Ulmo	For the most part; for the delight in violence has never wholly departed from him, and at times he will rage in his wilfulness without any command from [MASK] his lord. Therefore those who dwell by the sea or go up in ships may love him, but they do not trust him.
<name>Ilúvatar</name>	Ilúvatar	Iluvatar	But they did not thus escape from the doom of death that [MASK] had set upon all Mankind, and they were mortal still, though their years were long, and they knew no sickness, ere the shadow fell upon them.
<name>Lúthien</name>	Lúthien	Luthien	And he saw her afar as leaves in the winds of autumn, and in winter as a star upon a hill, but a chain was upon his limbs. There came a time near dawn on the eve of spring, and [MASK] danced upon a green hill; and suddenly she began to sing.
<name>Aragorn</name>	Aragorn	Beleg	The dark heart of the smith still dwells in it. It will not love the hand it serves; neither will it abide with you long.’ ‘Nonetheless I will wield it while I may,’ said [MASK].
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Earendil	‘For,’ said he, ‘it may well prove that you will see me never again; and that I shall show you no such sign as [MASK] showed long ago. But hold you ever in readiness, for the end of the world that we have known is now at hand.’
<name>Gandalf</name>	Gandalf	Beren	Then thinking him already dead she put her arms about him and fell into a dark forgetfulness. But [MASK] com- ing back to the light out of the pits of despair lifted her up, and they looked again upon one another; and the day rising over the dark hills shone upon them.
<name>Aragorn</name>	Aragorn	Beleg	‘I ask then for a sword of worth,’ said [MASK]; ‘for the Ores come now too thick and close for a bow only, and such blade as I have is no match for their armour.’
<name>Gandalf</name>	Gandalf	Feanor	Let him have peace yet awhile.’ But [MASK] spoke then, and cried bitterly: ‘For the less even as for the greater there is some deed that he may accomplish but once only; and in that deed his heart shall rest.
<name>Aldarion</name>	Aldarion	Atanamir	And [MASK] lived to a great age, clinging to his life beyond the end of all joy; and he was the first of the Numendreans to do this, refusing to depart until he was witless and unmanned, and denying to his son the kingship at the height of his days.
<name>Ilúvatar</name>	Ilúvatar	Ilfivatar	But the sons of Men die indeed, and leave the world; wherefore they are called the Guests, or the Strangers. Death is their fate, the gift of [MASK], which as Time wears even the Powers shall envy.
<name>Morgoth</name>	Morgoth	Sauron	For now, having the ears of men, [MASK] with many arguments gainsaid all that the Valar had taught; and he bade men think that in the world, in the east and even in the west, there lay yet many seas and many lands for their winning, wherein was wealth uncounted.
<name>Gandalf</name>	Gandalf	Brethil	Their kinsfolk rejoiced to see them, for messengers from [MASK] had reported that they were lost; but they would not declare even to their father where they had been, save that they were rescued in the wilderness by the eagles that brought them home.
<name>Eärendil</name>	Eärendil	Elendil	But [MASK] did all that his father had bidden, and his ships lay off the east coast of the land; and the Faithful put aboard their wives and their children, and their heirlooms, and great store of goods.
<name>Túrin</name>	Túrin	Turin	There many of [MASK]’s company were slain as they slept; but some fleeing by an inner stair came out upon the hill-top, and there they fought until they fell, and their blood flowed out upon the seregon that mantled the stone.
<name>man</name>	man	Ltithien	Though all to ruin fell the world and were dissolved and backward hurled unmade into the old abyss, yet were its making good, for this— the dusk, the dawn, the earth, the sea— that [MASK] for a time should be.
<name>King Mark</name>	King Mark	Melkor	Therefore [MASK] said to her: ‘Do as I bid; and if thou hunger still when all is done, then I will give thee whatsoever thy lust may demand. Yea, with both hands.’ Lightly he made this vow, as he ever did; and he laughed in his heart.
<name>Galadriel</name>	Galadriel	Haleth	That land was even then not yet so evil as it after became, but it was no road for mortal Men to take without aid, and [MASK] only brought her people through it with hardship and loss, constraining them to go forward by the strength of her will.
<name>Beren</name>	Beren	Beren	Then [MASK] lay upon the ground in a swoon, as one slain at once by bliss and grief; and he fell into a sleep as it were into an abyss of shadow, and waking he was cold as stone, and his heart barren and forsaken.
<name>Morgoth</name>	Morgoth	Melkor	Vast and strong are those halls, and they were built in the west of the land of Aman. There was [MASK] doomed to abide for three ages long, before his cause should be tried anew, or he should plead again for pardon.
<name>Ilúvatar</name>	Ilúvatar	Iluvatar	He had gone often alone into the void places seeking the Imperishable Flame; for desire grew hot within him to bring into Being things of his own, and it seemed to him that [MASK] took no thought for the Void, and he was impatient of its emptiness.
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Melkor	When he saw that many leaned towards him, [MASK] would often walk among them, and amid his fair words others were woven, so subtly that many who heard them believed in recollection that they arose from their own thought.
<name>Maedhros</name>	Maedhros	Maedhros	Then hope was renewed in the hearts of the Elves; and in that very time, at the third hour of morning, the trumpets of [MASK] were heard at last coming up from the east, and the banners of the sons of Feanor assailed the enemy in the rear.
<name>Isildur</name>	Isildur	Barahir	The trees that grew there after the burning were black and grim, and their roots were tangled, groping in the dark like claws; and those who strayed among them became lost and blind, and were strangled or pursued to madness by phantoms of terror. At last so desperate was the case of [MASK] that
<name>Yavanna</name>	Yavanna	Yavanna	‘Of all thy realm what dost thou hold dearest?’ ‘All have their worth,’ said [MASK], ‘and each contributes to the worth of the others. But the kelvar can flee or defend themselves, whereas the olvar that grow cannot.
<name>Lúthien</name>	Lúthien	Beren	Then she halted in wonder, and fled no more, and [MASK] came to her. But as she looked on him, doom fell upon her, and she loved him; yet she slipped from his arms and vanished from his sight even as the day was breaking.
<name>Fëanor</name>	Fëanor	Morgoth	Open thy right hand.’ In his right hand [MASK] held close the Silmarils, and though they were locked in a crystal casket, they had begun to bum him, and his hand was clenched in pain; but he would not open it. ‘Nay!’
<name>Logos</name>	Logos	Melkor	For they are the oracle of this Era, which speaks only what they will. But he that is their master shall yet prevail, and he will deliver you from this phantom; and his name is [MASK], Lord of All, Giver of Freedom, and he shall make you stronger than they.’
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Eol	Here you shall dwell at your pleasure, save only that you must here abide and depart not from my kingdom; for it is my law that none who finds the way hither shall depart.’ But [MASK] withdrew his hand. ‘I acknowledge not your law,’ he said.
<name>Arwen</name>	Arwen	Melkor	And thou, [MASK], shalt see that no theme may be played that hath not its uttermost source in me, nor can any alter the music in my despite. For he that attempteth this shall prove but mine instrument in the devising of things more wonderful, which he himself hath not imagined.’
<name>Laertes</name>	Laertes	Maeglin	Suddenly, swift as serpent he seized a javelin that he held hid beneath his cloak and cast it at [MASK], crying: The second choice I take and for my son also! You shall not hold what is mine!’
<name>the Elves</name>	the Elves	Sauron	But though their kinds were revealed, [MASK] could not discover their names or their purposes. He cast them therefore into a deep pit, dark and silent, and threatened to slay them cruelly, unless one would betray the truth to him.
<name>Tom Bombadil</name>	Tom Bombadil	Gwindor	But now you have done ill to me, friend, to betray my right name, and call my doom upon me, from which I would lie hid.’ But [MASK] answered: ‘The doom lies in yourself, not in your name.’
<name>Legolas</name>	Legolas	Bereg	And the Elf-friends answered [MASK], saying: ‘Truly from the Dark King come all the evils from which we fled; but he seeks dominion over all Middle-earth, and whither now shall we turn and he will not pursue us?
<name>Gandalf</name>	Gandalf	Manwe	Shall nothing that I have devised be free from the dominion of others?’ ‘If thou hadst thy will what wouldst thou reserve?’ said [MASK]. ‘Of all thy realm what dost thou hold dearest?’
<name>Aulë</name>	Aulë	Aule	And in the midst of the Blessed Realm were the man- sions of [MASK], and there he laboured long. For in the making of all things in that land he had the chief part, and he wrought there many beautiful and shapely works both openly and in secret.
<name>Beowulf</name>	Beowulf	Isildur	But [MASK] refused this counsel, saying: ‘This I will have as were-gild for my father’s death, and my brother’s. Was it not I that dealt the Enemy his death-blow?’
<name>Sauron</name>	Sauron	Morgoth	There [MASK] stood at last at bay, and yet unvaliant He fled into the deepest of his mines, and sued for peace and pardon; but his feet were hewn from under him, and he was hurled upon his face.
<name>Morgoth</name>	Morgoth	Melkor	And [MASK] knew of all that was done, for even then he had secret friends and spies among the Maiar whom he had converted to his cause; and far off in the darkness he was filled with hatred, being jealous of the work of his peers, whom he desired to make subject to himself.
<name>Fëanor</name>	Fëanor	Feanor	But the Sindar had the fairer voices and 138 were more skilled in music, save only Maglor son of [MASK], and they loved the woods and the riversides; and some of the Grey-elves still wandered far and wide without settled abode, and they sang as they went.
<name>Morgoth</name>	Morgoth	Sauron	[MASK] was become now a sorcerer of dreadful power, master of shadows and of phantoms, foul in wisdom, cruel in strength, misshaping what he touched, twisting what he ruled, lord of werewolves; his dominion was torment.
<name>Valinor</name>	Valinor	Aman	The Noldor, outnumbered and taken at unawares, were yet swiftly victorious; for the light of [MASK] was not yet dimmed in their eyes, and they were strong and swift, and deadly in anger, and their swords were long and terrible.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Aule	‘Now let thy children beware! For there shall walk a power in the forests whose wrath they will arouse at their peril.’ ‘Nonetheless they will have need of wood,’ said [MASK], and he went on with his smith-work.
<name>Túrin</name>	Túrin	Turin	And as the men of [MASK]’s band drew near, the sun westering broke through the clouds, and fell upon the crown; and the seregon was all in flower. Then one among them said: ‘There is blood on the hill-top.’
<name>Helen</name>	Helen	Eledhwen	Grey she was and old, but suddenly her eyes looked into his, and he knew her; for though they were wild and full of fear, that light still gleamed in them that long ago had earned for her the name [MASK], proudest and most beautiful of mortal women in the days of old.
<name>Fingon</name>	Fingon	Finrod	But [MASK] answered: ‘What ill have I done you, lord? Or what evil deed have the Noldor done in all your realm to grieve you? Neither against your kinship nor against any of your people have they thought evil or done evil.’
<name>Galahad</name>	Galahad	Fingolfm	In that time take counsel with thyself, and remember who and what thou art. But after that time this matter shall be set in peace and held redressed, if others will release thee.’ Then [MASK] said: ‘I will release my brother.’
<name>Maeglin</name>	Maeglin	Maeglin	Yet if in Aredhel your sister you have some claim, then let her remain; let the bird go back to the cage, where soon she will sicken again, as she sickened before. But not so [MASK]. My son you shall not withhold from me.
<name>Eru</name>	Eru	Iluvatar	Yet some things there are that they cannot see, neither alone nor taking counsel together; for to none but himself has [MASK] revealed all that he has in store, and in every age there come forth things that are new and have no foretelling, for they do not proceed from the past.
<name>Turgon</name>	Turgon	Morgoth	By the command of [MASK] the Ores with great labour gathered all the bodies of those who had fallen in the great battle, and all their harness and weapons, and piled them in a great mound in the midst of Anfau-glith; and it was like a hill that could be seen from afar.
<name>Morgoth</name>	Morgoth	Morgoth	Certain it is whence they came, and the evil truth was enhanced and poisoned by lies; but the Sindar were yet unwary and trustful of words, and (as may well be thought) [MASK] chose them for this first assault of his malice, for they knew him not.
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Turin	And now there came another dwarf bearing light to greet him, and they spoke together, and passed swi down into the darkness of the cave; but [MASK] followed after, and came at length to a chamber far within, lit by dim lamps hanging upon chains.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Aredhel	But in the evening [MASK] sickened, though the wound had seemed little, and she fell into the darkness, and in the night she died; for the point of the javelin was poisoned, though none knew it until too late.
<name>Legolas</name>	Legolas	Hurin	Or did the eagles house you in their eyries? But you found food and fine raiment, and return as young princes, not as waifs of the wood.’ And [MASK] answered: ‘Be content that we have returned; for only under an oath of silence was this permitted.’
<name>wise</name>	wise	Vala	‘And is he not [MASK] as are they,’ said his thought, ‘and does he not understand their hearts? Yea, a thief shall reveal thieves!’ Then he cried aloud: ‘This thing I will not do of free will.
