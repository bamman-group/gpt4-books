<name>Gerty</name>	Gerty	Stephen	that I'll be the death of that fellow one time. But his voice was no longer angry and [MASK] wondered was he thinking of her greeting to him under the porch. They turned to the left and walked on as before.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Maurice	Here, [MASK]! Come here, you thick-headed ruffian! Do you know I'm going to send you to a college where they'll teach you to spell c.a.t. cat. And I'll buy you a nice little penny handkerchief to keep your nose dry.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Cranly	He turned into the pillared hall, now calmly lit, went up the staircase and passed in through the clicking turnstile. [MASK] was sitting over near the dictionaries. A thick book, opened at the frontispiece, lay before him on the wooden rest.
<name>MacCann</name>	MacCann	MacCann	What do we know about what she feels? But whatever she feels, it, at least, must be real. It must be. What are our ideas or ambitions? Play. Ideas! Why, that bloody bleating goat Temple has ideas. [MASK] has ideas too.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Lepidus	This mentality, [MASK] would say, is indeed bred out of your mud by the operation of your sun. And mine? Is it not too? Then into Nile mud with it! APRIL 1. Disapprove of this last phrase. APRIL 2.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Cranly	--Because, [MASK] continued, you need not look upon yourself as driven away if you do not wish to go or as a heretic or an outlaw. There are many good believers who think as you do. Would that surprise you?
<name>Botulism</name>	Botulism	Canker	[MASK] was a disease of plants and cancer one of animals: or another different. That was a long time ago then out on the playgrounds in the evening light, creeping from point to point on the fringe of his line, a heavy bird flying low through the grey light.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stephen	The boys answered him phrase by phrase. [MASK], his tongue cleaving to his palate, bowed his head, praying with his heart. --O my God!-- --O my God!-- --I am heartily sorry-- --I am heartily sorry-- --for having offended Thee-- --for having offended Thee--
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Simon	They'll be of service to him in after years. Those are the fellows that can get you a position. --And they're a very rich order, aren't they, [MASK]? --Rather. They live well, I tell you.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Fleming	You are one of the idlest boys I ever met. Copy out your themes again the rest of you. [MASK] moved heavily out of his place and knelt between the two last benches. The other boys bent over their theme-books and began to write.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Cranly	And I'm proud that I'm an emotionalist. He sidled out of the alley, smiling slyly. [MASK] watched him with a blank expressionless face. --Look at him! he said. Did you ever see such a go-by-the-wall?
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Temple	We want to hear about that. --He had, faith, [MASK] said. And he was a married man too. And all the priests used to be dining there. By hell, I think they all had a touch. --We
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Davin	There was no face seen. The brother's face was bent upon her fair rain-fragrant hair. The hand freckled and strong and shapely and caressing was [MASK]'s hand. He frowned angrily upon his thought and on the shrivelled mannikin who had called it forth.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stephen	--Do you not fear that those words may be spoken to you on the day of Judgement? --What is offered me on the other hand? [MASK] asked. An eternity of bliss in the company of the dean of studies?
<name>Shelley</name>	Shelley	Newman	Their feet passed in pattering tumult over his mind, the feet of hares and rabbits, the feet of harts and hinds and antelopes, until he heard them no more and remembered only a proud cadence from [MASK]: --Whose feet are as the feet of harts and underneath the everlasting arms.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Cranly	He frowned angrily upon his thought and on the shrivelled mannikin who had called it forth. His father's jibes at the Bantry gang leaped out of his memory. He held them at a distance and brooded uneasily on his own thought again. Why were they not [MASK]'s hands?
<name>Shelley</name>	Shelley	Shelley	The vast cycle of starry life bore his weary mind outward to its verge and inward to its centre, a distant music accompanying him outward and inward. What music? The music came nearer and he recalled the words, the words of [MASK]'s fragment upon the moon wandering companionless, pale for weariness.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Cranly	The laugh, pitched in a high key and coming from a so muscular frame, seemed like the whinny of an elephant. The student's body shook all over and, to ease his mirth, he rubbed both his hands delightedly over his groins. --Lynch is awake, said [MASK].
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stephen	the same way, said [MASK], your flesh responded to the stimulus of a naked statue, but it was, I say, simply a reflex action of the nerves. Beauty expressed by the artist cannot awaken in us an emotion which is kinetic or a sensation which is purely physical.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stephen	chase me, ladies, I'm in the cavalry! His fellow student's rude humour ran like a gust through the cloister of [MASK]'s mind, shaking into gay life limp priestly vestments that hung upon the walls, setting them to sway and caper in a sabbath of misrule.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stephen	I see schemer in your face. Where did you break your glasses? [MASK] stumbled into the middle of the class, blinded by fear and haste. --Where did you break your glasses? repeated the prefect of studies. --The cinder-path, sir. --Hoho!
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stephen	You must choose the pure oil and you must be careful when you pour it in not to overflow it, not to pour in more than the funnel can hold. --What funnel? asked [MASK]. --The funnel through which you pour the oil into your lamp.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Adam	The soul of every human being that has ever existed, the souls of all those who shall yet be born, all the sons and daughters of [MASK], all are assembled on that supreme day. And lo, the supreme judge is coming!
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	John	He pointed to the portrait of his grandfather on the wall to his right. --Do you see that old chap up there, [MASK]? he said. He was a good Irishman when there was no money in the job. He was condemned to death as a whiteboy.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stephen	--Cunning indeed! he said. Is it you? You poor poet, you! --And you made me confess to you, [MASK] said, thrilled by his touch, as I have confessed to you so many other things, have I not?
<name>MacCann</name>	MacCann	Moynihan	--Are we likely to be asked questions on applied science? The professor began to juggle gravely with the terms pure science and applied science. A heavy-built student, wearing gold spectacles, stared with some wonder at the questioner. [MASK] murmured from behind in his natural voice:
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Cranly	--And not to have any one person, [MASK] said, who would be more than a friend, more even than the noblest and truest friend a man ever had. His words seemed to have struck some deep chord in his own nature.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stephen	--It was a great day for European culture, he said, when you made up your mind to swear in yellow. They lit their cigarettes and turned to the right. After a pause [MASK] began: --Aristotle has not defined pity and terror. I have.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stephen	I meant about the... I was thinking about the bad language of the railway porter. Well now, that's all right. Here, [MASK], show me your plate, old chap. Eat away now. Here.
<name>Ovid</name>	Ovid	Ovid	One of the first examples that he had learnt in Latin had run: INDIA MITTIT EBUR; and he recalled the shrewd northern face of the rector who had taught him to construe the Metamorphoses of [MASK] in a courtly English, made whimsical by the mention of porkers and potsherds and chines of bacon.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Ennis	--Well now, [MASK], I declare you have a head and so has my stick! Do you mean to say that you are not able to tell me what a surd is? The blundering answer stirred the embers of his contempt of his fellows.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stephen	--Then, said [MASK], you pass from point to point, led by its formal lines; you apprehend it as balanced part against part within its limits; you feel the rhythm of its structure. In other words, the synthesis of immediate perception is followed by the analysis of apprehension.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Cranly	Did you see that? I bet [MASK] didn't see that. By hell, I saw that at once. As they crossed the inner hall, the dean of studies was in the act of escaping from the student with whom he had been conversing.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stephen	--Good morning, everybody, said [MASK], smiling and kissing the tips of his fingers in adieu. The lane behind the terrace was waterlogged and as he went down it slowly, choosing his steps amid heaps of wet rubbish, he heard a mad nun screeching in the nuns' madhouse beyond the wall.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stephen	I disremember if it was October or November. It was October because it was before I came up here to join the matriculation class. [MASK] had turned his smiling eyes towards his friend's face, flattered by his confidence and won over to sympathy by the speaker's simple accent.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Willie	He stood still in the middle of the roadway, his heart clamouring against his bosom in a tumult. A young woman dressed in a long pink gown laid her hand on his arm to detain him and gazed into his face. She said gaily: --Good night, [MASK] dear!
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Glynn	I suppose you mean the barefooted children that are taught by a bloody ape like you. God help them! He bit off the rest of the fig and flung away the butt. --I suffer little children to come unto me, [MASK] said amiably. --A
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stephen	[MASK] followed also with his ears the accents and intervals of the priest's voice as he spoke gravely and cordially of indifferent themes, the vacation which had just ended, the colleges of the order abroad, the transference of masters.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Dedalus	The rector looked at him in silence and he could feel the blood rising to his face and the tears about to rise to his eyes. The rector said: --Your name is [MASK], isn't it? --Yes, sir... --And where did you break your glasses?
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Cranly	* * * * * MARCH 20. Long talk with [MASK] on the subject of my revolt. He had his grand manner on. I supple and suave. Attacked me on the score of love for one's mother. Tried to imagine his mother: cannot.
<name>Nash</name>	Nash	Nash	Brightness falls from the air. He had not even remembered rightly [MASK]'s line. All the images it had awakened were false. His mind bred vermin. His thoughts were lice born of the sweat of sloth. He came back quickly along the colonnade towards the group of students.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stephen	He produced his match and began to clean the crevice between two teeth. Then he said carelessly: --Tell me, for example, would you deflower a virgin? --Excuse me, [MASK] said politely, is that not the ambition of most young gentlemen?
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stephen	A figure was crouching before the large grate and by its leanness and greyness he knew that it was the dean of studies lighting the fire. [MASK] closed the door quietly and approached the fireplace. --Good morning, sir! Can I help you?
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stephen	--That idea never occurred to me, [MASK] answered. But I am curious to know are you trying to make a convert of me or a pervert of yourself? He turned towards his friend's face and saw there a raw smile which some force of will strove to make finely significant.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stephen	[MASK] walked on at his father's side, listening to stories he had heard before, hearing again the names of the scattered and dead revellers who had been the companions of his father's youth. And a faint sickness sighed in his heart.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stephen	One evening his father came home full of news which kept his tongue busy all through dinner. [MASK] had been awaiting his father's return for there had been mutton hash that day and he knew that his father would make him dip his bread in the gravy.
<name>Simon</name>	Simon	Dante	He liked to sit near him at the fire, looking up at his dark fierce face. But his dark eyes were never fierce and his slow voice was good to listen to. But why was he then against the priests? Because [MASK] must be right then.
<name>Heron</name>	Heron	Heron	He scarcely resented what had seemed to him a silly indelicateness for he knew that the adventure in his mind stood in no danger from these words: and his face mirrored his rival's false smile. --Admit! repeated [MASK], striking him again with his cane across the calf of the leg.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Dixon	That's a fine invention too. Like hell. --But with the unpleasantness left out, [MASK] said. He turned smiling to the others and said: --I think I am voicing the opinions of all present in saying so much.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Davin	[MASK] could not, was going to a meeting. When we came away father told me he had a good honest eye. Asked me why I did not join a rowing club. I pretended to think it over.
<name>Gabriel</name>	Gabriel	Gabriel	The instant flashed forth like a point of light and now from cloud on cloud of vague circumstance confused form was veiling softly its afterglow. O! In the virgin womb of the imagination the word was made flesh. [MASK] the seraph had come to the virgin's chamber.
<name>Brother</name>	Brother	Ghezzi	This means to leave church by back door of sin and re-enter through the skylight of repentance. Cannot repent. Told her so and asked for sixpence. Got threepence. Then went to college. Other wrangle with little round head rogue's eye [MASK].
<name>Doran</name>	Doran	Dante	He was a good Irishman when there was no money in the job. He was condemned to death as a whiteboy. But he had a saying about our clerical friends, that he would never let one of them put his two feet under his mahogany. [MASK] broke in angrily:
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stephen	And could he repent? Yes, he could: and cry two round rogue's tears, one from each eye. Crossing [MASK]'s, that is, my green, remembered that his countrymen and not mine had invented what Cranly the other night called our religion.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Hurroo	They caught their caps and sent them up again spinning sky-high and cried again: --Hurroo! [MASK]! They made a cradle of their locked hands and hoisted him up among them and carried him along till he struggled to get free.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stephen	[MASK] paused and, though his companion did not speak, felt that his words had called up around them a thought-enchanted silence. --What I have said, he began again, refers to beauty in the wider sense of the word, in the sense which the word has in the literary tradition.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Towser	--Duck him! Guzzle him now, [MASK]! --Help! Help!... Ao! He recognized their speech collectively before he distinguished their faces. The mere sight of that medley of wet nakedness chilled him to the bone.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stephen	His hands were in his side-pockets and his trousers were tucked in at the knees by elastic bands. On the evening of the day on which the property was sold [MASK] followed his father meekly about the city from bar to bar.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Fleming	It was not a cod because they had run away. He looked with the others across the playground and began to feel afraid. At last [MASK] said: --And we are all to be punished for what other fellows did?
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stephen	[MASK] remained in the background, depressed more than ever by the darkness and silence of the theatre and by the air it wore of jaded and formal study. On the desk he read the word FOETUS cut several times in the dark stained wood.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stephen	The consciousness of the warm sunny city outside his window and the tender tremors with which his father's voice festooned the strange sad happy air, drove off all the mists of the night's ill humour from [MASK]'s brain.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Cranly	--Yes, my child, [MASK] said, still gaily. --You made me confess the fears that I have. But I will tell you also what I do not fear. I do not fear to be alone or to be spurned for another or to leave whatever I have to leave.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Stephen	He could still hear his father's voice-- --When you kick out for yourself, [MASK]--as I daresay you will one of these days--remember, whatever you do, to mix with gentlemen. When I was a young fellow I tell you I enjoyed myself.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stephen	--Rhythm, said [MASK], is the first formal esthetic relation of part to part in any esthetic whole or of an esthetic whole to its part or parts or of any part to the esthetic whole of which it is a part. --If
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stephen	He doesn't smoke and he doesn't go to bazaars and he doesn't flirt and he doesn't damn anything or damn all. [MASK] shook his head and smiled in his rival's flushed and mobile face, beaked like a bird's.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Lynch	[MASK] gazed after him, his lip curling in slow scorn till his face resembled a devil's mask: --To think that that yellow pancake-eating excrement can get a good job, he said at length, and I have to smoke cheap cigarettes!
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Davin	--This race and this country and this life produced me, he said. I shall express myself as I am. --Try to be one of us, repeated [MASK]. In heart you are an Irish man but your pride is too powerful. --My
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Stephen	I'm talking to you as a friend, [MASK]. I don't believe a son should be afraid of his father. No, I treat you as your grandfather treated me when I was a young chap. We were more like brothers than father and son.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stephen	You're an excitable bloody man, do you know. He laughed nervously as he spoke and, looking up into [MASK]'s face with moved and friendly eyes, said: --Do you know that you are an excitable man?
<name>Heron</name>	Heron	Cranly	We're not deaf, said the tall consumptive. [MASK] still frowned at the stout student below him. Then, with a snort of disgust, he shoved him violently down the steps. --Go away from here, he said rudely. Go away, you stinkpot.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Cranly	--And is that why you will not communicate, [MASK] asked, because you are not sure of that too, because you feel that the host, too, may be the body and blood of the son of God and not a wafer of bread?
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stephen	The light had waned. He could not see. Did that explain his friend's listless silence, his harsh comments, the sudden intrusions of rude speech with which he had shattered so often [MASK]'s ardent wayward confessions?
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stephen	[MASK] at his post by the window heard the old lady and the priest laugh together and heard the boys' murmurs of admiration behind him as they passed forward to see the little boy who had to dance the sunbonnet dance by himself. A movement of impatience escaped him.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Davin	You remember? Then you used to address the jesuits as father, you remember? I ask myself about you: IS HE AS INNOCENT AS HIS SPEECH? --I'm a simple person, said [MASK]. You know that.
<name>Leopold</name>	Leopold	Temple	Go home, blast you, for you're a hopeless bloody man. --I'm an emotional man, said [MASK]. That's quite rightly expressed. And I'm proud that I'm an emotionalist. He sidled out of the alley, smiling slyly.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	One	A broad-shouldered student with a moustache was cutting in the letters with a jack-knife, seriously. Other students stood or sat near him laughing at his handiwork. [MASK] jogged his elbow. The big student turned on him, frowning.
<name>Heron</name>	Heron	Cranly	A match of four was arranged, [MASK] insisting, however, that his ball should be used. He let it rebound twice or thrice to his hand and struck it strongly and swiftly towards the base of the alley, exclaiming in answer to its thud: --Your soul!
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	Pray to our mother [MASK] to help you. She will help you, my child. Pray to Our Blessed Lady when that sin comes into your mind. I am sure you will do that, will you not? You repent of all those sins.
<name>Corley</name>	Corley	Cranly	He moved the umbrella in indication and tittered again. [MASK], who was still chewing the fig, answered with loud movements of his jaws. --Good? Yes. It is a good evening. The squat student looked at him seriously and shook his umbrella gently and reprovingly.
<name>Christmas</name>	Christmas	Christmas	He went once or twice with his mother to visit their relatives: and though they passed a jovial array of shops lit up and adorned for [MASK] his mood of embittered silence did not leave him. The causes of his embitterment were many, remote and near.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stephen	He would seize a handful of grapes and sawdust or three or four American apples and thrust them generously into his grandnephew's hand while the shopman smiled uneasily; and, on [MASK]'s feigning reluctance to take them, he would frown and say: --Take them, sir.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Dixon	The blackish, monkey-puckered face pursed its human mouth with gentle pleasure and its voice purred: --Delightful weather for March. Simply delightful. --There are two nice young ladies upstairs, captain, tired of waiting, [MASK] said.
<name>Dolphus</name>	Dolphus	Hickey	Angry with himself he tried to hide his face from their eyes by gazing down sideways into the shallow swirling water under the bridge but he still saw a reflection therein of their top-heavy silk hats and humble tape-like collars and loosely-hanging clerical clothes. --Brother [MASK].
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stephen	His mother kissed him. Was that right? His father was a marshal now: higher than a magistrate. Welcome home, [MASK]! Noises... There was a noise of curtain-rings running back along the rods, of water being splashed in the basins.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stephen	Can you not combine the progressive tendency with a respect for punctuality? --That question is out of order, said [MASK]. Next business. His smiling eyes were fixed on a silver-wrapped tablet of milk chocolate which peeped out of the propagandist's breast-pocket.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Cranly	And I am not afraid to make a mistake, even a great mistake, a lifelong mistake, and perhaps as long as eternity too. [MASK], now grave again, slowed his pace and said: --Alone, quite alone. You have no fear of that.
<name>Bloom</name>	Bloom	Christy	--Is it [MASK]? he said. There's more cunning in one of those warts on his bald head than in a pack of jack foxes. He inclined his head, closed his eyes, and, licking his lips profusely, began to speak with the voice of the hotel keeper.
<name>Mercedes</name>	Mercedes	Mercedes	The vastness and strangeness of the life suggested to him by the bales of merchandise stocked along the walls or swung aloft out of the holds of steamers wakened again in him the unrest which had sent him wandering in the evening from garden to garden in search of [MASK].
<name>Fleming</name>	Fleming	Fleming	--Hoho! he cried. Who is this boy? Why is he on his knees? What is your name, boy? --Fleming, sir. --Hoho, [MASK]! An idler of course. I can see it in your eye.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stephen	hell, that's a queer notion. I consider that notion to be a mercenary notion. His voice faded into silence. No heed was paid to his words. He turned his olive face, equine in expression, towards [MASK], inviting him to speak again.
<name>Lynch</name>	Lynch	Dixon	It did no one any harm, did it? --We hope, [MASK] said suavely, that it was not of the kind known to science as a PAULO POST FUTURUM. --Didn't I tell you he was a smiler?
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Lynch	The past is consumed in the present and the present is living only because it brings forth the future. Statues of women, if [MASK] be right, should always be fully draped, one hand of the woman feeling regretfully her own hinder parts. APRIL 6, LATER.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stephen	[MASK] knelt down quickly pressing his beaten hands to his sides. To think of them beaten and swollen with pain all in a moment made him feel so sorry for them as if they were not his own but someone else's that he felt sorry for.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stephen	His pallid bloated face expressed benevolent malice and, as he had advanced through his tidings of success, his small fat-encircled eyes vanished out of sight and his weak wheezing voice out of hearing. In reply to a question of [MASK]'s his eyes and his voice came forth again from their lurking-places.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	But he imagined that he stood near [MASK] in a wide land and, humbly and in tears, bent and kissed the elbow of her sleeve. In the wide land under a tender lucid evening sky, a cloud drifting westward amid a pale green sea of heaven, they stood together, children that had erred.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Lynch	Our flesh shrinks from what it dreads and responds to the stimulus of what it desires by a purely reflex action of the nervous system. Our eyelid closes before we are aware that the fly is about to enter our eye. --Not always, said [MASK] critically. --In
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Dante	I am a catholic as my father was and his father before him and his father before him again, when we gave up our lives rather than sell our faith. --The more shame to you now, [MASK] said, to speak as you do.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Maggy	Fill it out, you, [MASK]. When the enamelled basin had been fitted into the well of the sink and the old washing glove flung on the side of it he allowed his mother to scrub his neck and root into the folds of his ears and into the interstices at the wings of his nose.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Cranly	--It is a curious thing, do you know, [MASK] said dispassionately, how your mind is supersaturated with the religion in which you say you disbelieve. Did you believe in it when you were at school? I bet you did.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stephen	asked [MASK]. --Bedad I am, said the little old man. I have two bouncing grandchildren out at Sunday's Well. Now, then! What age do you think I am? And I remember seeing your grandfather in his red coat riding out to hounds.
