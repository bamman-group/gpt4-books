<name>Pip</name>	Pip	Pip	“Or Provis,” I suggested. “Or Provis--thank you, [MASK]. Perhaps it is Provis? Perhaps you know it's Provis?” “Yes,” said I. “You know it's Provis.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Biddy	“No; I have seen him there, since we have been walking here.--It is of no use,” said [MASK], laying her hand upon my arm, as I was for running out, “you know I would not deceive you; he was not there a minute, and he is gone.”
<name>Herbert</name>	Herbert	Herbert	Now burn.” When I had shown this to [MASK] and had put it in the fire--but not before we had both got it by heart--we considered what to do. For, of course my being disabled could now be no longer kept out of view.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Biddy	“Did he ever tell you he liked you?” I asked indignantly. “No,” said [MASK], glancing over her shoulder again, “he never told me so; but he dances at me, whenever he can catch my eye.”
<name>Barnard</name>	Barnard	Barnard	“I haven't begun insuring yet,” he replied. “I am looking about me.” Somehow, that pursuit seemed more in keeping with [MASK]'s Inn. I said (in a tone of conviction), “Ah-h!” “Yes.
<name>Rawdon</name>	Rawdon	Handel	and I will walk quietly into the nearest church. Remember! The blessed darling comes of no family, my dear [MASK], and never looked into the red book, and hasn't a notion about her grandpapa. What a fortune for the son of my mother!”
<name>Phileas</name>	Phileas	Wemmick	“Shall I see something very uncommon?” “Well,” said [MASK], “you'll see a wild beast tamed. Not so very uncommon, you'll tell me. I reply, that depends on the original wildness of the beast, and the amount of taming.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Joe	I going to be? I told her I was going to be apprenticed to [MASK], I believed; and I enlarged upon my knowing nothing and wanting to know everything, in the hope that she might offer some help towards that desirable end.
<name>Pip</name>	Pip	Pip	It were a'most the only hammering he did, indeed, 'xcepting at myself. And he hammered at me with a wigor only to be equalled by the wigor with which he didn't hammer at his anwil.--You're a listening and understanding, [MASK]?”
<name>Estella</name>	Estella	Biddy	For which cogent reason I kept [MASK] at a distance during supper, and when I went up to my own old little room, took as stately a leave of her as I could, in my murmuring soul, deem reconcilable with the churchyard and the event of the day.
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Herbert	His room must be like a chandler's shop.” While he thus spoke, the growling noise became a prolonged roar, and then died away. “What else can be the consequence,” said [MASK], in explanation, “if he will cut the cheese?
<name>Estella</name>	Estella	Estella	How can I say, when I never knew? What I dreaded was, that in some unlucky hour I, being at my grimiest and commonest, should lift up my eyes and see [MASK] looking in at one of the wooden windows of the forge.
<name>Herbert</name>	Herbert	Herbert	It was soon done, and the boat was brought round to the Temple stairs, and lay where I could reach her within a minute or two. Then, I began to go out as for training and practice: sometimes alone, sometimes with [MASK].
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Biddy	“I don't know,” I moodily answered. “Because, if it is to spite her,” [MASK] pursued, “I should think--but you know best--that might be better and more independently done by caring nothing for her words.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Joe	The administration of mutton instead of medicine, the substitution of Tea for [MASK], and the baker for bacon, were among the mildest of my own mistakes. However, her temper was greatly improved, and she was patient.
<name>Estella</name>	Estella	Herbert	“What am I fit for? I know only one thing that I am fit for, and that is, to go for a soldier. And I might have gone, my dear [MASK], but for the prospect of taking counsel with your friendship and affection.”
<name>Heep</name>	Heep	Joe	After I had turned the worst point of my illness, I began to notice that while all its other features changed, this one consistent feature did not change. Whoever came about me, still settled down into [MASK].
<name>Estella</name>	Estella	Estella	At the door.” To stand in the dark in a mysterious passage of an unknown house, bawling [MASK] to a scornful young lady neither visible nor responsive, and feeling it a dreadful liberty so to roar out her name, was almost as bad as playing to order.
<name>Wemmick</name>	Wemmick	Wemmick	What a liar you were! I never met such a liar as you!” Before putting his late friend on his shelf again, [MASK] touched the largest of his mourning rings and said, “Sent out to buy it for me, only the day before.”
<name>Wemmick</name>	Wemmick	Mike	[MASK] looked hard at my guardian, as if he were trying to learn a lesson from his face, and slowly replied, “Ayther to character, or to having been in his company and never left him all the night in question.” “Now, be careful.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Mike	[MASK] looked at his cap, and looked at the floor, and looked at the ceiling, and looked at the clerk, and even looked at me, before beginning to reply in a nervous manner, “We've dressed him up like--” when my guardian blustered out,-- “What?
<name>Adèle</name>	Adèle	Estella	We sat down on a bench that was near, and I said, “After so many years, it is strange that we should thus meet again, [MASK], here where our first meeting was! Do you often come back?” “I have never been here since.”
<name>Wemmick</name>	Wemmick	Joe	For was it not,” said [MASK], with his old air of lucid exposition, “that my only wish were to be useful to you, I should not have had the honor of breaking wittles in the company and abode of gentlemen.”
<name>Orlick</name>	Orlick	Joe	As he looked at the fire, I thought I saw a cunning expression, followed by a half-laugh, come into his face. “I am not acquainted with this country, gentlemen, but it seems a solitary country towards the river.” “Most marshes is solitary,” said [MASK].
<name>Silas</name>	Silas	Joe	There was a delicious sense of cleaning-up and making a quiet pause before going on in life afresh, in our village on Saturday nights, which stimulated [MASK] to dare to stay out half an hour longer on Saturdays than at other times.
<name>Stapleton</name>	Stapleton	Steady	I saw him over your shoulder.” “[MASK]!” I thought. I asked him then, “Which of the two do you suppose you saw?” “The one who had been mauled,” he answered readily, “and I'll swear I saw him!
<name>Clennam</name>	Clennam	Joe	In short, I shouldn't greatly deceive you,” [MASK] added, after a little grave reflection, “if I represented to you that the word of that young woman were, 'without a minute's loss of time.'”
<name>Herbert</name>	Herbert	Biddy	“[MASK],” said I, after binding her to secrecy, “I want to be a gentleman.” “O, I wouldn't, if I was you!” she returned. “I don't think it would answer.”
<name>Estella</name>	Estella	Estella	said [MASK], “to know what satisfaction it gives me to see those people thwarted, or what an enjoyable sense of the ridiculous I have when they are made ridiculous. For you were not brought up in that strange house from a mere baby. I was.
<name>Job</name>	Job	Joe	“Why you see, old chap,” said [MASK], in a tone of remonstrance, and by way of getting at it by degrees, “I wouldn't go so far as to say that, for that's a deal to say; but
<name>Estella</name>	Estella	Biddy	“Till you're a gentleman,” said [MASK]. “You know I never shall be, so that's always. Not that I have any occasion to tell you anything, for you know everything I know,--as I told you at home the other night.”
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Joe	“There was a conwict off last night,” said [MASK], aloud, “after sunset-gun. And they fired warning of him. And now it appears they're firing warning of another.” “Who's firing?” said I.
<name>Estella</name>	Estella	Wemmick	When we went downstairs again, [MASK] led me into my guardian's room, and said, “This you've seen already.” “Pray,” said I, as the two odious casts with the twitchy leer upon them caught my sight again, “whose likenesses are those?”
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Drummle	she had favored; but a worthier object would have caused me a different kind and degree of distress. It was easy for me to find out, and I did soon find out, that [MASK] had begun to follow her closely, and that she allowed him to do it.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Joe	After which, [MASK] withdrew to the window, and stood with his back towards me, wiping his eyes. And as my extreme weakness prevented me from getting up and going to him, I lay there, penitently whispering, “O God bless him!
<name>Provis</name>	Provis	Wemmick	Good-bye!” They shook hands again, and as we walked away [MASK] said to me, “A Coiner, a very good workman. The Recorder's report is made to-day, and he is sure to be executed on Monday.
<name>Compeyson</name>	Compeyson	Compeyson	Keep me down!' Then he lifted himself up hard, and was dead. “[MASK] took it easy as a good riddance for both sides. Him and me was soon busy, and first he swore me (being ever artful) on my own
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Herbert	“At the hour and minute,” said [MASK], nodding, “at which she afterwards stopped all the clocks. What was in it, further than that it most heartlessly broke the marriage off, I can't tell you, because I don't know.
<name>candle</name>	candle	candle,--which	Neither, beyond the blowing out of the [MASK] stood on a table between the door and my sister, and was behind her when she stood facing the fire and was struck,--was there any disarrangement of the kitchen, excepting such as she herself had made, in falling and bleeding.
<name>Handel</name>	Handel	Handel	And she has come back, a most beautiful and most elegant creature. And I saw her yesterday. And if I adored her before, I now doubly adore her.” “Lucky for you then, [MASK],”
<name>Herbert</name>	Herbert	Herbert	said I. “O yes, I constantly expect to see him,” returned [MASK], “because I never hear him, without expecting him to come tumbling through the ceiling. But I don't know how long the rafters may hold.”
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Camilla	The other lady, who had not spoken yet, said gravely and emphatically, “Very true!” “Poor soul!” [MASK] presently went on (I knew they had all been looking at me in the mean time), “he is so very strange!
<name>Estella</name>	Estella	Estella	A great event in my life, the turning point of my life, now opens on my view. But, before I proceed to narrate it, and before I pass on to all the changes it involved, I must give one chapter to [MASK].
<name>Herbert</name>	Herbert	Herbert	It was between twelve and one o'clock when I reached the Temple, and the gates were shut. No one was near me when I went in and went home. [MASK] had come in, and we held a very serious council by the fire.
<name>Charley</name>	Charley	Wemmick	Come; can't I tempt you?” Not a man of them, sir, would be bold enough to try it on, for love or money.” “They dread him so much?” said I. “Dread him,” said [MASK].
<name>Snagsby</name>	Snagsby	Pip	Having had a letter from you, I were able to say 'I am.' (When I married your sister, sir, I said 'I will;' and when I answered your friend, [MASK], I said 'I am.') '
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Joe	growled the journeyman, between his teeth, “I'd hold you, if you was my wife. I'd hold you under the pump, and choke it out of you.” (“I tell you, let her alone,” said [MASK].)
<name>Good</name>	Good	Goo	I said so, and he took me down. “Now,” he pursued, “you remember what you've undertook, and you remember that young man, and you get home!” “[MASK]-good night, sir,” I faltered.
<name>Wemmick</name>	Wemmick	Drummle	“I wouldn't lend one of you a sixpence. I wouldn't lend anybody a sixpence.” “Rather mean to borrow under those circumstances, I should say.” “You should say,” repeated [MASK]. “Oh Lord!”
<name>Jupiter</name>	Jupiter	Joe	How [MASK] got out of the room, I have never been able to determine; but I know that when he did get out he was steadily proceeding upstairs instead of coming down, and was deaf to all remonstrances until I went after him and laid hold of him.
<name>Steerforth</name>	Steerforth	Wemmick	Could you commission any friend of yours to bring me a pair, if you've no further use for 'em?” “It shall be done, sir.” “All right,” said [MASK], “they shall be taken care of.
<name>Stamford</name>	Stamford	Drummle	“Yes,” said I, edging him a little away with my shoulder. “Beastly place,” said [MASK]. “Your part of the country, I think?” “Yes,” I assented. “I am told it's very like your Shropshire.”
<name>Pip</name>	Pip	Pip	Look'ee here, [MASK]. I was low; that's what I was; low. Look over it, dear boy.” Some sense of the grimly-ludicrous moved me to a fretful laugh, as I replied, “I have looked over it.
<name>Thornhill</name>	Thornhill	Herbert	The time when one would be due where we lay, wherever that might be, could be calculated pretty nearly, if we made inquiries beforehand. [MASK] assented to all this, and we went out immediately after breakfast to pursue our investigations.
<name>Wemmick</name>	Wemmick	Wemmick	The punch being very nice, we sat there drinking it and talking, until it was almost nine o'clock. “Getting near gun-fire,” said [MASK] then, as he laid down his pipe; “it's the Aged's treat.”
<name>Provis</name>	Provis	Estella	“Pray, sir,” said I, “may I ask you a question?” “You may,” said he, “and I may decline to answer it. Put your question.” “[MASK]'s name.
<name>Estella</name>	Estella	Biddy	Dissatisfied, and uncomfortable, and--what would it signify to me, being coarse and common, if nobody had told me so!” [MASK] turned her face suddenly towards mine, and looked far more attentively at me than she had looked at the sailing ships.
<name>Herbert</name>	Herbert	Herbert	“He hopes I am, if he's alive, you may be sure,” with a fierce look. “I never heerd no more of him.” [MASK] had been writing with his pencil in the cover of a book.
<name>Estella</name>	Estella	Estella	Enough that I saw no gate then, and that I saw one now. As it stood open, and as I knew that [MASK] had let the visitors out,--for she had returned with the keys in her hand,--I strolled into the garden, and strolled all over it.
<name>Estella</name>	Estella	Molly	[MASK], let them see your wrist.” Her entrapped hand was on the table, but she had already put her other hand behind her waist. “Master,” she said, in a low voice, with her eyes attentively and entreatingly fixed upon him.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Biddy	I was disappointed to find that the day was a holiday; no children were there, and [MASK]'s house was closed. Some hopeful notion of seeing her, busily engaged in her daily duties, before she saw me, had been in my mind and was defeated.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Joe	“Whose?” said I. “Not, I grant you, but what his manners is given to blusterous,” said [MASK], apologetically; “still, a Englishman's ouse is his Castle, and castles must not be busted 'cept when done in war time.
<name>Magwitch</name>	Magwitch	Lord	[MASK] strike me dead!' I says each time,--and I goes out in the air to say it under the open heavens,--'but wot, if I gets liberty and money, I'll make that boy a gentleman!' And I done it. Why, look at you, dear boy!
<name>Robinson</name>	Robinson	Herbert	About midnight I got out of bed and went to [MASK], with the conviction that I had been asleep for four-and-twenty hours, and that Wednesday was past. It was the last self-exhausting effort of my fretfulness, for after that I slept soundly.
<name>Herbert</name>	Herbert	Herbert	After a little show of indecision, which there were none to see but the two or three amphibious creatures belonging to our Temple stairs, we went on board and cast off; [MASK] in the bow, I steering. It was then about high-water,--half-past eight.
<name>Steerforth</name>	Steerforth	Herbert	Our conference being now ended, and everything arranged, I rose to go; remarking to [MASK] that he and I had better not go home together, and that I would take half an hour's start of him.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Joe	In my conscience, I doubt very much whether I had any lingering intention left of going to see [MASK]; but if I had, this observation put it to flight. “You had no idea of your impending good fortune, in those times?”
<name>Wemmick</name>	Wemmick	Wemmick	[MASK] tightened his post-office and shook his head, as if his opinion were dead against any fatal weakness of that sort. “This friend,” I pursued, “is trying to get on in commercial life, but has no money, and finds it difficult and disheartening to make a beginning.
<name>Wemmick</name>	Wemmick	Wemmick	[MASK], “you and I understand one another. We are in our private and personal capacities, and we have been engaged in a confidential transaction before to-day. Official sentiments are one thing. We are extra official.” I cordially assented.
<name>Wemmick</name>	Wemmick	Wemmick	In the mean time, [MASK] was diving into his coat-pockets, and getting something out of paper there. “Halloa!” said he. “Here's a couple of pair of gloves! Let's put 'em on!”
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Joe	Therefore, I made no remark on [MASK]'s first head; merely saying as to his second, that the tidings had indeed come suddenly, but that I had always wanted to be a gentleman, and had often and often speculated on what I would do, if I were one.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Joe	But, at last I began, in a purblind groping way, to read, write, and cipher, on the very smallest scale. One night I was sitting in the chimney corner with my slate, expending great efforts on the production of a letter to [MASK].
<name>Pip</name>	Pip	Pip	(I saw the idea suddenly break upon him that he would adapt his epitaph to the occasion, before he went on to say) “And there weren't no objection on your part, and [MASK] it were the great wish of your hart!”
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Joe	I had thought of that too, and it was very far from comforting to me to find that he had thought of it; for it seemed to render it more probable. “But, [MASK].” “Yes, old chap.”
<name>Weller</name>	Weller	Pumblechook	Tell me not it cannot be; I tell you this is him!” A low murmur from the two replied. The waiter appeared to be particularly affected. “This is him,” said [MASK], “as I have rode in my shay-cart.
<name>Pip</name>	Pip	John	Do try him, if it is only for old acquaintance sake. Good-bye, Aged Parent!” in a cheery shout. “All right, [MASK]; all right, my boy!” piped the old man from within.
<name>Lord</name>	Lord	Lord	Then why go into subjects, old chap, which as betwixt two sech must be for ever onnecessary? There's subjects enough as betwixt two sech, without onnecessary ones. [MASK]! To think of your poor sister and her Rampages!
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Camilla	and we went on again. “I suppose there's nothing to be done,” exclaimed [MASK], “but comply and depart. It's something to have seen the object of one's love and duty for even so short a time.
<name>Magwitch</name>	Magwitch	Herbert	“Assuredly,” replied [MASK]. “As to anything I say, you know,” he insisted. “The oath applies to all.” “I understand it to do so.” “And look'ee here! Wotever I done is worked out and paid for,” he insisted again.
<name>Pip</name>	Pip	Pip	But what the Devil was I to do? I must put something into my stomach, mustn't I?--Howsomever, I'm a getting low, and I know what's due. Dear boy and [MASK]'s comrade, don't you be afeerd of me being low.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Herbert	[MASK] received me with open arms, and I had never felt before so blessedly what it is to have a friend. When he had spoken some sound words of sympathy and encouragement, we sat down to consider the question, What was to be done?
<name>Pip</name>	Pip	Pip	what I said, “and I thought you would kindly not mind my taking leave of you.” “This is a gay figure, [MASK],” said she, making her crutch stick play round me, as if she, the fairy godmother who had changed me, were bestowing the finishing gift.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Joe	All this time (still with both hands taking great care of the bird's-nest), [MASK] was rolling his eyes round and round the room, and round and round the flowered pattern of my dressing-gown.
<name>Biddy</name>	Biddy	Biddy	I reflected that even in those untoward times there must have been latent in [MASK] what was now developing, for, in my first uneasiness and discontent I had turned to her for help, as a matter of course.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Herbert	“Not to say an unfeeling thing,” said I, “he cannot do better than go.” “I am afraid that must be admitted,” said [MASK]; “and then I shall come back for the dear little thing, and the dear little thing
<name>Betsy</name>	Betsy	Biddy	She had no idea what stock she had, or what the price of anything in it was; but there was a little greasy memorandum-book kept in a drawer, which served as a Catalogue of Prices, and by this oracle [MASK] arranged all the shop transactions.
<name>Herbert</name>	Herbert	Trabb	“I think he's all right!” said [MASK]'s boy, in a sober voice; “but ain't he just pale though!” At these words, the face of him who supported me looked over into mine, and I saw my supporter to be--
<name>Stevenson</name>	Stevenson	Wemmick	“No, no,” said [MASK], coolly, “you don't care.” Then, turning to me, “Served His Majesty this man. Was a soldier in the line and bought his discharge.” I said, “Indeed?”
<name>Joseph</name>	Joseph	Joseph	But that man said he did not repent of what he had done, [MASK]. Not at all. It was right to do it, it was kind to do it, it was benevolent to do it, and he would do it again.'”
<name>Estella</name>	Estella	Herbert	“It seems,” said [MASK], “--there's a bandage off most charmingly, and now comes the cool one,--makes you shrink at first, my poor dear fellow, don't it? but it will be comfortable
<name>Orlick</name>	Orlick	Biddy	“I might as well ask you,” said [MASK], “how you manage?” “No; because when I come in from the forge of a night, any one can see me turning to at it.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Joe	“What's that?” I asked, in some hope of bringing him to a stand. But [MASK] was readier with his definition than I had expected, and completely stopped me by arguing circularly, and answering with a fixed look, “Her.”
<name>Traddles</name>	Traddles	Herbert	The sound of our pens going refreshed us exceedingly, insomuch that I sometimes found it difficult to distinguish between this edifying business proceeding and actually paying the money. In point of meritorious character, the two things seemed about equal. When we had written a little while, I would ask [MASK] how he got on?
<name>Pumblechook</name>	Pumblechook	Pip	And there he remained so long saying, “Astonishing” at intervals, so often, that I began to think his senses were never coming back. At length he prolonged his remark into “[MASK], I do assure you this is as-TON-ishing!”
<name>Wemmick</name>	Wemmick	Drummle	[MASK] and I then sat snorting at one another for an hour, while the Grove engaged in indiscriminate contradiction, and finally the promotion of good feeling was declared to have gone ahead at an amazing rate. I tell this lightly, but it was no light thing to me.
<name>Traddles</name>	Traddles	Trabb	The last word was flung at the boy, who had not the least notion what it meant. But I saw him collapse as his master rubbed me out with his hands, and my first decided experience of the stupendous power of money was, that it had morally laid upon his back [MASK]'s boy.
<name>Pip</name>	Pip	Punch	This spot and these beautiful works upon it ought to be kept together by the Nation, after my son's time, for the people's enjoyment.” “You're as proud of it as [MASK]; ain't you, Aged?”
<name>Biddy</name>	Biddy	Biddy	I repeated, with disdainful emphasis. “O! there are many kinds of pride,” said [MASK], looking full at me and shaking her head; “pride is not all of one kind--” “Well? What are you stopping for?” said I.
<name>Estella</name>	Estella	Estella	“It seems,” said [MASK], very calmly, “that there are sentiments, fancies,--I don't know how to call them,--which I am not able to comprehend. When you say you love me, I know what you mean, as a form of words; but nothing more.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Mike	“Is he here?” asked my guardian. “I left him,” said [MASK], “a setting on some doorsteps round the corner.” “Take him past that window, and let me see him.” The window indicated was the office window.
