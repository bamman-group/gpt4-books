<name>Marcia</name>	Marcia	Ian	In fact, him didn't even bother to finish the fish dinner. Him get up from around the table and went upstairs. Not long after, him put on pyjamas and crawl under the sheet. Them didn't touch atall that night. [MASK] was over again the following week.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Andrea	'[MASK], all we can do is pray. The doctors try them best. Did everything they could. But this thing, this disease/ him hated to call it that, 'is out of our hands all together. Out of our hands.
<name>Josey</name>	Josey	Niguel	The message in the walk. Notice who him glance at first when him look at people, follow the eyes. And most important,' [MASK] instruct him, 'notice the batty man trousers him wearing. Not a single, solitary pocket.'
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Dale	Sometimes after service [MASK] would follow the older women into the kitchen at the back of the church where the wide back windows look out on to the well-kept garden and neatly arranged flowers and help them rinse out the communion dishes and wine-soiled tablecloths.
<name>He</name>	He	Dale	Say him don't own one.' [MASK] didn't say anything else. Him just turn away from her and walk slowly out the door, never even bothering to say goodnight, or to pull the door shut behind him, to keep out the strong wind.
<name>Yuh</name>	Yuh	Nevin	'[MASK] know?' Silence. 'Well my love, you know you don't have much rights once wife's involved. Is them who get the property when him drop down dead in you bed. Is them who get to take care of him when him fall down sick...'
<name>Miss Matty</name>	Miss Matty	Loxley	For two weeks him been wracking his brains, trying to figure out how to continue school next term, from whom him could borrow money. His own savings had dwindled down to nothing, for him insist on buying food since [MASK] won't allow him to pay rent.
<name>Corbett</name>	Corbett	Dale	[MASK] continue on, slightly out of breath, as him stir the heavy liquid with a tall thin spoon, 'will coat the walls of your throat. With all that coughing, them bound to sore up. And the lime juice will kill the germs.'
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Dale	She glance at her long and polished nails. She click them repeatedly. She pause to sip water from a cup. She click. [MASK] bristle, slapping down the telegram on the counter before her, scattering paperclips and sheets of paper.
<name>Preacher</name>	Preacher	Bill	Now him realise why him didn't trust [MASK]. Now him know why him didn't like his oily grin. His sweet mouth. His kiss-me-ass kindness. 'No. Please don't leave!'
<name>could</name>	could	atall	His entire left side was as stiff as a piece of board. Nothing [MASK] moved, except for the rolling of his eyeballs, an occasional bobbing of the Adam's apple. Drops of saliva curdle themselves by the edges of his mouth.
<name>Roy</name>	Roy	Dale	Them walk out on to the field together, completely deserted by then, except for the two, and even night was setting up quick and brisk, with the sun already gone down and the evening starting to blow cold. [MASK] swing the bat this way and that, a skip in every step.
<name>He</name>	He	Dale	[MASK] start to walk briskly, his anger mounting, eyes blind to the people standing up on the sidewalk waiting for the bus, to the ones walking fast behind him, ahead. But him was going to show the whole lot, stock and barrel of them that what them think don't count.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Andrea	Him did only have one intention and that was to get to the mother's house. Already in his mouth, rolling back and forth on his tongue, was the entire conversation framed. First him would knock at the door boldly and [MASK] would run downstairs to let him in. '
<name>Amos</name>	Amos	Dale	Then him was gone. And [MASK] was alone. Flooded with guilt. With shame. With pleasure. Him stoop down to pull up his trousers, all the while looking around, behind him, in front, to the side.
<name>Ramesh</name>	Ramesh	Dale	Before it was only one. Always dress-up in white, face bearded, hair neat - prematurely greying at the temples, a gold bracelet dangling from thick wrist. One evening after practice, everybody else marching back towards the school. [MASK] did walk up to him.
<name>Who</name>	Who	Ian	So please don't lay the blame on me, sir.' Then she pause, making sure everything was quiet. 'Yesterday him ask me if him can accompany me to church next Sunday, maybe even set up an appointment for his baptism ...' '[MASK]?'
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Ian	[MASK] fan his hand, annoyance strong in his voice, face furrowing up all of a sudden. 'You have to take chances. Can't just spend your life coop up inside the blasted house. You bound to start grow fungus. Furthermore you see the thighs on that boy?
<name>Anancy</name>	Anancy	Nevin	Them did have to force cow-itch tea down me throat to get you to budge. Even then you were no damn good. Should've followed me heart and put a blasted end to you, then.' [MASK] say him couldn't listen anymore.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Dale	It recede from off his forehead stretching way back on to the middle of his head. Pimples spot his cheeks now, leaving them feeling rugged; lumpy; out of form; ugly. 'Must be him searching for a younger version of me.' Bitterness stained [MASK]'s voice. '
<name>He</name>	He	Loxley	Sorry. I just lost track of time.' [MASK] walk back towards the couch and pick up the cigarette he'd been smoking from off the coffee table. Him inhale, scratch his head. The robe hang loose around him, exposing thin legs.
<name>Precious</name>	Precious	Dale	'The doctor did say it would happen. Just when him least expected it.' [MASK] pull on the pair of trousers him did leave next to the dresser last night. 'Just when him think everything all right. Just when him think him getting better.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Dale	It was still cool, and the brilliant face of the moon was just starting to fade, to make room for the yellow sun. 'Oh, [MASK].' Her voice was hoarse and him wrap his heavy arms around her thin and trembling shoulders, his chin nestled in the deep grooves of her collar.
<name>He</name>	He	Dale	Then it would strike. Disabling him even worse than before. Probably putting him into a coma. Probably paralysing him for life. Probably leave him brain dead.' [MASK] fish through the dresser for a tee shirt, scattering several on the carpet.
<name>Ramon</name>	Ramon	Dale	[MASK] would catch the ball expertly in his cupped hands. After each game, sometimes them would rest under the willowy branches of a nearby guava tree and talk quietly as the sun slip from out the sky and hide behind the mountains, and swallows fly west for the night.
<name>Miss Matty</name>	Miss Matty	Dale	But as far as I can see [MASK], it seems as if you wouldn't know love even if it knock you in your face. But you must be happy now, with your own place, your own money, paying you own rent, you own school fee.'
<name>He</name>	He	Dale	This wasn't why him come. This wasn't what him wanted to hear. Then there was a loud crash. Followed by a grunt. [MASK] close his eyes and waited. Stop his breath and listened. The wheelchair ceased its creaking.
<name>He</name>	He	Nevin	Cannot be left alone for long. Absolutely useless.' Him sigh, raise his head to glance at them, flash pearly white teeth, then return to the magazine on his lap. 'They give you medication?' [MASK] again. 'Some stuff.'
<name>Delroy</name>	Delroy	Nevin	Him could see [MASK] and the boy now, on the little blue couch in the back of the store, 'soon come back' sign hang askew from the door. Bare-face, the boy wouldn't know quite exactly what to do; how to start.
<name>Delroy</name>	Delroy	Dale	[MASK] squeeze back the eye water burning behind his nose. Feel the throbbing by his temples, the rushing in his head, the dull tremor of the crab. Him think about the little savings him have. The last few months him been dipping into it.
<name>Magdalena</name>	Magdalena	Dale	She could give away the old one she have now. For as you cough. that thing break down. She could set it down next to the organ and maybe put one or two figurines on top ...' Still, [MASK] didn't say anything.
<name>He</name>	He	Dale	Blow his nose inside the white, lace handkerchief and spit sudden. Tuck his shirt into his trousers, straighten his tie and ran his hand quickly through his hair. [MASK] brace himself forward, head upright, knees firm. Together them step through the front door.
<name>Sylvia</name>	Sylvia	Johnney	At the glasses perched quietly at the tip of her nose. At the swollen ankles pressed into her shoes. Him think about [MASK] lean up against the column. Neck throw back, throat bare, brown, vulnerable to the white lights streaming out into the darkness.
<name>him</name>	him	Dale	Other times, it was the particular way she would laugh, after giving her own dry lifeless joke, that sounded so much like angels singing in a choir accompanied by the enchanted chimes of an old-fashioned harp. She reminded [MASK] of his mother.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Ian	'[MASK] won't admit it. But the woman crazy! She send back everything him give her. She disown him cause him can't give her children. Cause him won't marry. Cause him love man. Man!'
<name>Mrs. Hudson</name>	Mrs. Hudson	Dale	I got the telegram this morning and came first thing. What happen to him?' [MASK]'s voice was beginning to rise. The little hand whip out a pink serviette and mop the doctor's face. 'We like to know a little something about our patients.
<name>Ramesh</name>	Ramesh	Nevin	You still pick him up, clean him up and let him run your shop.' [MASK]'s top lip quiver under the moustache. His forehead glisten shine from where hair was beginning to recede. 'You were the first one I thought about when I open that shop.
<name>He</name>	He	Ian	[MASK] stop and shudder, voice husky, heavy with emotions. 'Big shoulders, face coarse and rough-looking. Just the way I love them.' Him inhale more of his cigarette and exhale slowly, lips tunnelshaped. '
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Nevin	The glowing of the cigarette in the darkness draw his attention. The sudden brightness before it dulled again. Curling of the smoke in the still night air. His chest constrict and the air burst out in gulps as him come to realise it was [MASK] outside lean up against the column.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Ian	There was a certain shrill escaping [MASK]'s voice now and again. Wasn't overly noticeable. For the most part you could overlook it, but every time it was about to emerge, burst forth, it slink back beneath a cackle of laughter, some new joke, a jab at somebody else.
<name>Precious</name>	Precious	Dale	[MASK] turn away his head. Him couldn't understand why this woman, in her loud green frock, was still feeding the baby even though it look big enough to be eating yam and breadfruit by now. And look at the way she hold it!
<name>Them</name>	Them	Bill	I can't understand what you find in them, you know. [MASK] look after you well, but that don't satisfy you. You want the tough, ugly, ignorant man who more than quick to call you names and burst up your head.'
<name>Sharon</name>	Sharon	Ian	Police just slap-slap you with batons as them have a mind. Anyway, bad news aside, I see the loveliest man at the bus stop, though.' [MASK]'s face break down into a grin, eyes deep, mysterious. 'Oh yeah?'
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Nevin	[MASK] ask from across the room. 'Oh, just fine. Just fine.' Him knock ash into a nearby crystal tray, eyes steady on the magazine. 'Can't wait to get back to the office, can just imagine all the work on me desk.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Ian	For one brief second, [MASK]'s eyes brighten in recognition before settling back into their gel of haze. Then as if something suddenly occurred to him, him start to gesture wildly, fingers stiff, mechanical, eyes watery, shifting around restlessly in the porcelain face.
<name>Amara</name>	Amara	Dale	[MASK] didn't see her, the woman, tall and erect like a pine tree, busily sifting through the crowd, her face tight with emotions as the wails rip themselves from the edges of her belly and slap violently against the rippled surface of the water.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Loxley	'Look, I want to help you out, for you nervous, it's a stressful time. But you not giving me the chance.' [MASK]'s voice sounded tired. 'I don't need your help.' 'What!'
<name>He</name>	He	Dale	The room did take on a sudden glumness. [MASK] get up from the desk and walk towards the window. Him push it open. The warm air from outside brush against his face. Him inhale it. The laughing from outside draw his attention.
<name>Percy</name>	Percy	Dale	[MASK] wasn't sure if him wanted to spend time with her tonight. She was so sometimish. One day, chat and laugh from now till next week as if you and she coming from afar. Another time, you go over to borrow a handful of salt.
<name>Cholly</name>	Cholly	Nevin	I mean it look as if she mad as hell with you. I mean, look.' [MASK] stretch out his hands, empty, at the envelope with the ashes. 'You dropping me or not?'
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Dale	I made a promise ...' 'Well, this is what you can do with your fucking promises.' And in one quick flash. [MASK] pick up the cheque in his palm, crush it into a small ball and send it sailing into the waterfall.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Andrea	'It's OK, [MASK]. It's OK.' Him try to pacify her with the deep reassuring bass of his voice, his right hand making circular motions around her frail back. 'You send for the doctor, already?'
<name>She</name>	She	Dale	She was seated on the bed facing the bureau, stocky legs knocking against the sides as she hum some song or other, the white scarf on her head scented high of the bay rum that ease the plenty headaches she get now. [MASK] did have it well rehearsed.
<name>Chike</name>	Chike	Dale	So I put the briefcase on my lap and start to unlock it. Lo and behold, my tube of Vaseline intensive care was sitting right on top.' 'Serve you damn right,' [MASK] burst out, voice agitated, laughter gurgling in his throat. '
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Nevin	She and [MASK] have the same dirt brown eyes, except one of hers have a tendency to just slide past over your head, beside you, not quite in focus. She turn back to her receipts. 'But I have news for that no count wretch.
<name>He</name>	He	Dale	She hand him a pile of papers hold together with a piece of elastic. 'Here, look through these and pick out all the ones for 1977. You want a little ginger tea?' [MASK] shake his head. She slurp a mouthful from her mug.
<name>Marcia</name>	Marcia	Ian	'You mash-up?' 'Might as well.' [MASK] ease the pressure off one slender foot and place it on to the other. 'I know that man now five months. We travel everywhere together. You name it, him buy it and give me.
<name>He</name>	He	Dale	I don't have on me glasses and I can't see how your mouth lips moving. Start again.' [MASK] wonder if she couldn't walk and come to the gate. The sun was raging crossway the sky. Sweat trickle down behind his two ears.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Dale	At the intersection. [MASK] wait with another woman, the hem of whose pale yellow frock was pulling out at the back, for the lights to change. A broad-shouldered fellow in shorts ride pass on bicycle, marble calves shuddering with each pedal.
<name>He</name>	He	Dale	It doesn't seem to linger long. Just enough to drop off till next time.' [MASK] shift round, uncertain how him should answer. Him glance at her posture - rigid inside the red nightie, two thin straps holding up her breasts in order.
<name>Horace</name>	Horace	Ian	[MASK] sigh long looking off at nothing in particular, hand with cigarette en route to his lips, poised high in mid-air. 'You going on as if tree growing in my face. As if I don't have charms and other delicious niceties.'
<name>He</name>	He	Dale	But just as sudden as it came, the desire flitted away, and [MASK] drop the penknife and several stems of roses to the ground. Him fall down with them noiseless, on the cool thin dirt, sighing out loud. Him was tired of trying.
<name>He</name>	He	Nevin	Slowly him take it down and place it gently on the floor next to his other polished shoe. 'Get the hell out.' [MASK] hesitate. The anger had left his eyes. Fear replaced it. The centipede shivered. 'Don't you ever barge in here again without knocking.
<name>He</name>	He	Dale	You different from them others. But you ambitionless just like them.' 'A job is a job.' [MASK] didn't know where the calmness came from all of a sudden. 'As long as the means to getting the wages honest.'
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Ian	Instead him run pass the figure doubled-over on the couch, hands press against chest, the cigarette burning by the winged-tip shoes, and into the kitchen for the roll of paper towel on the counter to wipe-up the phlegm [MASK] was spitting out.
<name>Horace</name>	Horace	Nevin	Him look meagre-meagre to me, bad.' [MASK] rest the book on his lap, back lean-up against the bedhead. Turn the leaves one or two times, stroke the few strands of beard that were starting to grow on his chin.
<name>Rosemary</name>	Rosemary	Cho	'I don't mean to bother you ...' '[MASK]!' She hand him a pile of papers hold together with a piece of elastic. 'Here, look through these and pick out all the ones for 1977. You want a little ginger tea?'
<name>She</name>	She	Dale	She put down her note pad and straighten out the pleats in her crisply ironed flowered skirt. End of hour was at hand. She adjust her bifocals and unfold her ankles. 'Come again next week so we can get to the root of this business.' [MASK] never went back.
<name>Lucinda</name>	Lucinda	Bill	One Thursday afternoon, however, after knocking several times and still no answer, she did barge in, her heart galloping in her bosom, the charcoal pupils of her eyes staring wildly ahead, for maybe it was too late to accomplish what her cousin [MASK] did hire her to do.
<name>Marlon</name>	Marlon	Dale	[MASK] sigh out loud and continue to watch the programme. Him didn't see the point in answering. Granted, it wasn't his house. Him don't pay rent either. But for all the hours and overtime him put in, his friends have a right to come and go as them please.
<name>Nevin</name>	Nevin	Ian	I just feel sweaty and dirty. I walked all the way from [MASK]'s house. I just wanted to think, to breathe in some fresh air. Shake the depression.' 'Is Nevin again, isn't it?'
<name>Rankine</name>	Rankine	Ian	Sweat trickle down behind his two ears. '[MASK] drop down this morning, and them admit...' 'By the way. Who are you, sir?' In the middle of the heat, him could hear the chill to her voice.
<name>MacGill</name>	MacGill	Dale	The nurse lady [MASK] pull one side didn't have much to say. No, she didn't see any particular puncture hole, so it can't be asthma or any kind of lung abscess. But X-ray results will come out next week.
<name>Him</name>	Him	Bill	'Friend of a friend.' [MASK] put down both bags on the counter and start to stock tins on shelves. 'She use to take care of his mother, something like that.' Him pause to light a cigarette.
<name>Stand</name>	Stand	Dale	It cause his eyes to squeeze down to slits. 'Especially since you have him well trained already.' '[MASK], him straight.' 'That didn't stop you. You still pick him up, clean him up and let him run your shop.'
<name>Ravi</name>	Ravi	Dale	Hunched over the table in a comer, one hand holding up his jaw, the other swirling the straw in his glass of aerated water. [MASK] wait patiently, his back turned to the uniformed portrait of the Governor General.
<name>Esteban</name>	Esteban	Dale	When [MASK] noiselessly step inside the church with its heavy red rug padding the floor, and stained glass windows of glossy-eyed madonnas looking wistfully outside at the cemetery fenced around with barb wire, the barrel-faced minister was already bowed at the altar, leading the congregation in prayers.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Loxley	Seven black, waist-high, sharp-teethed German shepherds guard the gate, and not even [MASK] can walk through unless his mother, a squat, big-bosomed, round-faced lady, call them each by name, scold then speak kindly, before chaining them up.
<name>Jerome</name>	Jerome	Dale	The air was so thick, so cloudy with it. 'The illness, you know. Him was just crying and crying. So, I just stayed.' [MASK] shake his head and sighed. 'But you right, I really should've called.
<name>Shad</name>	Shad	Dale	Him put his hand around [MASK]'s shoulders. 'But you don't know if that's where she call from?' His tone was gentle, patient. 'Listen, you dropping me there or not?'
<name>Junior</name>	Junior	Bill	'Well, him need more than that.' [MASK] dip his fingers in his drink and swirl the ice-cubes around and around thoughtfully. 'Him need to give up this nonsense, this man-loving shit. You too.'
<name>Sammy</name>	Sammy	Bill	[MASK] was a man who love to live well and spend plenty money. No one was inside the pool splash-splashing around, only one or two tourist lay-up around the edges in lounge chairs, pink skins lather-up with lotion.
<name>them</name>	them	Dale	People pass quickly back and forth on the narrow dirt road close-by, low conversations and spiralling laughter ringing loud into the night. But them could see neither [MASK] nor the stranger, for the large limbs of the willow trees served as chameleons in the dark.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Ian	Him did promise to wait for [MASK], but him didn't feel comfortable by himself. It was his first time. All around, trees stand up tall and weeds grow plenty. A foot beaten path trail off into the thickets. It was evening.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Dale	Eyes without sheen. '[MASK], let's just talk. The packet. Oh God.' Him sigh long and look up the road to the darkness. 'I lost my head. I lost.. / 'The bus will be here any minute now.
<name>Anancy</name>	Anancy	Ian	Four. Five.' [MASK] stretch out a finger at each count. 'I want my business taken care of right away, me love. That kind of celibate life not for me.' Him fumble around for a cigarette, hands trembling as him light it.
<name>Miss Mattie</name>	Miss Mattie	Sister	Evening time around the small dinette set, his brother would always engage her about which lightskinned girl him was sporting this week. [MASK] wasn't any differ- ent. She was a woman who love to talk at length about the cast-eyed taxi driver she been courting on and off for two straight years.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Dale	It was hard, calloused, rough, fingers: short, thick. The fingers moulded and squeezed and tugged. Against him [MASK] lay, almost swooning, the heat licking away at his ears, his chiselled cheeks, his massive throat, the turmoil coursing through his veins.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Ian	People were starting to open up windows and peer outside to see who it was causing the commotion this early in the day. 'But me and [MASK] are good friends. Use to go to the same school.'
<name>He</name>	He	Dale	[MASK] trudge on, eyes paying attention to nothing in particular, nostrils picking up now and again the mingled scents of melted tar, Esso gasoline, jerk pork. The thought of going back to the house didn't sit easy with him.
<name>He</name>	He	Dale	Bar his sweetheart from coming to your house? Stop supporting him?' [MASK] wait, anger subsiding, annoyance building instead. Him hate the hesitancy, the slowness of speech, the biding of time, the silence.
<name>He</name>	He	Dale	Except for scratchy sounds ejecting from the overhead intercom now and again, the humming of a respirator tank, and light snores coming from one or two of the beds, the room was silent and yellow. [MASK] walk towards the sound of the respirator, steps heavy, uncertain.
<name>She</name>	She	Dale	You know what I would do to get that? You know how grateful I'd be?' Then there was quiet. Him wheeze softly. [MASK] sigh deep and look out into the dark. Yes, him get plenty. It was starting to rain.
<name>Arjun</name>	Arjun	Dale	Each time [MASK] visit, all that greet him is a pair of eyes, the colour of curry, sitting inside the darkness, shoulders slumped down into his belly. His entire left side was as stiff as a piece of board.
<name>Doyle</name>	Doyle	Brookes	But...' Him pause again to shake his head, eyes dead on the floor, 'out here, all I can think about is that fellow, [MASK], the one that slip into the coma ...' On the way home.
<name>him</name>	him	Nevin	But not of late. In fact not much about [MASK] engage him of late. Not the smile that crinkle his eyes and flare out his nose. Nor the coarseness of his cheek from each day-old beard. The room was empty now.
<name>Jerome</name>	Jerome	Nevin	[MASK]'s face loom large before him, eyes wide, frightened, the centipede bristling with the tension in the room. Him didn't know where the power had come from all of a sudden, causing him to grab the ice pick. Him wasn't a violent person.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Ian	Then she would make her way up the wooden stairs, humming softly under her breath, knock timidly at the door before entering to lift [MASK] from out the bed, set him gently on to the chair and wheel him into the bathroom.
<name>Ulysses</name>	Ulysses	Dale	And [MASK] savour every contraction, every expansion, every twinge of muscle, every palpitation in every comer as the man's fingers encircle, fondle, run deftly up and down, returning again and again, sometimes using only two fingers, sometimes the whole calloused hand.
<name>Jerome</name>	Jerome	Dale	'I don't need your help.' 'What!' 'I don't need your help/ [MASK]'s eyes were flashing, the crab trembling slightly. Him wonder whose voice that was now, the person who replace him or ... 'Here, take the car.'
