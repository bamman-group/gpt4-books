<name>Bobby</name>	Bobby	Victor	— But [MASK] nagged for his racing-car track. —It only means you’ll have to dismantle it and pack it up again.— He had the habit of standing in front of her with his demands; she walked round him. He planted himself again.
<name>Jan</name>	Jan	Bam	The shops. The distance to the nearest general store must be forty kilometres. There was a police post there; certainly the Indian store would have a petrol pump. [MASK] stepped through a minefield of words before he chose what to say. —Who drove the bakkie?
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	July	— She was distracted by something misplaced. What would appear for her from beneath the vehicle, from the ruined huts, so often a silent presence while not yet noticed: now he surely would come forward to [MASK]’s call with his young man’s easy stroll.
<name>Marietjie</name>	Marietjie	Martha	—I like to be with other women sometimes. And there are the children, too. We manage to talk a bit. I’ve found out [MASK] does understand—a little Afrikaans, not English. It’s just that she’s shy to try.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	July	—Well that’s all right, [MASK], isn’t it—he knows you. I mean he must know you’ve got somebody here.— —He know who is it me... He send someone ask who I’m keep in my house.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Bam	—I tell them you give it to me.— [MASK] blew laughter. —Who’ll believe that.— —They know, they know what it is happening, the trouble in town. The white people are chased away from their houses and we take.
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	July	—We can go to my home.— [MASK] said it, standing in the living-room where he had never sat down, as he would say ‘We can buy little bit paraffin’ when there was a stain to be removed from the floor.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Victor	— It was some days before the vehicle ceased to be the point of reference for their existence. What was left of the tinned food was still there; the box containing [MASK]’s electric racing-car track that it was discovered he must have put in under cover of adult confusion.
<name>she</name>	she	Maureen	— The chief spoke in English without any explanation and with a face that stopped short any show of surprise. She—[MASK]—seemed to take it she was the one addressed. On the stroke of dead silence, she laughed again, to him.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Royce	[MASK] hummed and sucked on the pipe-stem of a rib-bone; was almost asleep. Carried off in a state of unprotesting confusion to be bedded-down, he mumbled with content. —There’s no school tomorrow, is there?
<name>Nanny</name>	Nanny	July	For this—this village and this empty bush? And they’ll kill you. You mustn’t let the government make you kill each other. The whole black nation is your nation.— Like the chief, like [MASK], like everyone, she was hearing him say what he
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Mwawate	The match worked from the right corner of the chief’s mouth to the left. He sucked once at the gap in his teeth. —How many you got there by [MASK]’s place?— One eye closed, hands in position, taking aim.
<name>someone</name>	someone	July	—Want to lie down?— But that was a non sequitur, like the tea she made from their precious store, pumping the Primus they’d been lent. There was no reason why [MASK] should be expected back within any limit of time that could be fixed.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	July	He did not know he had lifted his arms wide until he saw [MASK], the black men—all of them were looking at his palms open to them, sinking. —You’re not going to shoot your own people. You wouldn’t kill blacks.
<name>The narrator</name>	The narrator	Victor	There was nothing to be done but wait. The children tried to fondle the usual cats, but the cats were terrified of human hands and hid behind an old car radiator grid whose honeycomb was welded with rust. [MASK] wanted to know if his father would buy it.
<name>Mrs. van der Spuy</name>	Mrs. van der Spuy	Bam	I just took stuff that gets thrown away, nobody wants— But all the parents did was give the man a two-rand note, and [MASK] patted him on the back with gestures of apology and assumption that adults must make allowances for the actions of children.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Bam	He wanted to hold the gun; [MASK] showed him how to aim at a moving target and explained the loading mechanism. —Have you ever fired a shot?— The young man shook his head and others laughed at white ignorance. —I read about it.
<name>Seymour</name>	Seymour	Royce	—If he had two rands to pay for an old orange-bag, he’d be able to buy a rope instead, wouldn’t he.— [MASK] made his way patiently round the whole question to approach his brother shyly, confidentially.
<name>Stivvings</name>	Stivvings	Bam	Well, what can they say?— Only a colourless texturing like combings from raw wool across the top of his head from ear to ear remained to [MASK]— he had begun to go bald in his twenties. The high dome reddened under the transparent nap.
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	Vic	He planted himself again. —When are we going?— —[MASK], where’s there to set it up? And there’s no electricity, you can’t run it.— —I want to show it.— —To whom?—
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Bam	They were hungry. She went up to [MASK] and fished, without a word, for the knife with tin-opener attachment he kept in his pocket. He noticed she gave them the last of the pork sausages, coming from the tin like plugs of wet pink cork.
<name>Dr. Watson</name>	Dr. Watson	July	—Your chief wants to be left alone. But it’s not possible.— —He’s talking talking. Talking too much.— Their cautious lack of response roused a kind of obstinacy in [MASK]. —You can tell me, what he can do?
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	July	— It was she who smiled at [MASK], said what had to be said. —We owe him everything.— The two white people stepped forward, one by one, to shake the chief’s hand and those of his elders.
<name>Boer</name>	Boer	AmaZulu	[MASK], amaXhosa, baSotho... I don’t know. They were already there by the mine, coming near here. If they coming, the government it’s going give me guns. Yes! They give us guns, we going kill those people when they come with their guns.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Barn	But you, you don’t think about me, I’m big man, I know for myself what I must do. I’m not thinking all the time for your things, your dog, your cat.— —The master. [MASK]’s not your master.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Bam	Even a woman can tell that. Her presence conveyed all this to him, in their silence both heard, knew from what had been unspoken in their past. She said it. —You’ve never been able to fix machines. Get [MASK] to do it.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Bam	— [MASK] suddenly remembered, touching the rill of sleep, how they had run in haste and confusion. The malaria pills: —Where’d you get such a supply? Surely we didn’t have them in the bathroom cupboard?— —1 looted.
<name>Hammett</name>	Hammett	July	He doesn’t seem to think much of his chief, anyway. You heard the way he talked.— She blinked slowly two or three times. —I think [MASK] was talking about himself.— —Himself? How?
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	July	A-l-1 your things is there, it’s me I’ve got the key, always it’s me— —[MASK], you don’t ask me— —Your boy who work for you. There in town you are trusting your boy for fifteen years.
<name>Ethan</name>	Ethan	Gina	—How can you say what it’s like?— For [MASK], what hadn’t before been seen in this village was new to the world. The parents were brought together to witness the contraption as divorced people might meet on their regular day to keep up a semblance of family life.
<name>someone</name>	someone	July	The chief sucked loudly and sharply through the gaps in his teeth. Everyone listened to the sound as if it were intelligible. When he spoke again it was in his own language; [MASK] translated. —You think they can find this place with those people?
<name>Mr. Kurtz</name>	Mr. Kurtz	July	Where had they come from? Why here? —The chief he say, he ask, yes, I’m work for you, but he never see a white man he come to his boy’s place.— [MASK] had taken on the in-
<name>Simon</name>	Simon	July	—1 tell them? They don’t understand our language.— The boy said nothing but kicked steadily at the dented, rusted bath used for their ablutions. —Don’t. D’you hear me? That’s [MASK]’s.— The demijohn of water was empty.
<name>The judge</name>	The judge	July	The clearing of his throat was a rap for attention. —You coming from where?— [MASK] must have told him, he must, like everyone else around, have known of their presence and their story; this was the magisterial ritual of cross-examination.
<name>Abraham</name>	Abraham	Gee	—[MASK], two rands for an old orange-bag. I could buy one of those vintage buggy miniatures for that. I’ll get him some old orange-bags if he’ll pay me two rands.— His father laid the same calming hand on him, a palm lightly on his head.
<name>Wangero</name>	Wangero	Bam	—If we could find a couple of bricks to raise it on.— But bricks were a cherished commodity; in every hut, they were used to raise beds. Where was [MASK] to find bricks for her? She found her own solution.
<name>he</name>	he	Bam	She saw how when she or [MASK], who were completely dependent on these people, had nothing but bits of paper to give them, not even clothes—so prized by the poor—to spare, they secreted the paper money in tied rags and strange crumpled pouches about their persons.
<name>Chief</name>	Chief	July	— When [MASK] didn’t answer at once she couldn’t wait. —Perhaps he’s going to.— Trying to hem him in with her reasoning; she thought she was chasing a chicken? —Why should the chief do that? Who told you that?
<name>the chief's</name>	the chief's	July’s	— Handed it back; he hung it on the nail where the previous occupant of the hut had hung her hoe. In place of chaos, the sounds of [MASK]—the chief’s—form of order came to them. Someone droning song in rhythm with movement.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	July	Look after everything, [MASK]. And you bringing nice present when you come back. You looking everywhere, see if everything it’s still all right. Myself, I’m not say you’re not a good madam—but you don’t say you trust for me.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Bam	—I would never have thought he would do something like that. He’s always been so correct.— [MASK] paused to be sure she accepted the absolute rightness, the accuracy of the word. —Never gave any quarter, never took any, either.
<name>Mother</name>	Mother	Barn	What else, over the years? Yet he was perfectly honest. When he was cleaning the floor, and found a cent rolled there, he would put it on [MASK]’s bedside table. They had never locked anything, not even their liquor cupboard.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Gina	[MASK] was called but paid no attention; finally she walked in with the old woman’s sciatic gait of black children who carry brothers and sisters almost as big as they are. She had a baby on her small back and wore an expression of importance.
<name>Louise</name>	Louise	Darling	Sometimes they giggle and are in cahoots —Don’t tell you saw, hey Lydia—(When she has come from school on the back of a boy’s bicycle instead of safely by bus.) —[MASK], how can I tell? You are my true friend, isn’t it?
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ellen	He stuffed the note-book into his shirt-pocket tom and neatly sewn back with unmatched thread by [MASK]. —How I must get that gun? Where I’m going find it? You know where is it? You know?
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Habit	—As long as the money lasts.— —The money! We’ll be out of here, with plenty of money.— [MASK] assumed the male role of initiative and reassurance—something he always had on him, a credit card or cheque-book.
<name>David</name>	David	Roberts	[MASK]’ bird book and standard works on indigenous trees and shrubs were the Smales’ accommodation of the wilderness to themselves when they used to visit places like this, camping out. At the end of the holiday you packed up and went back to town.
<name>the war</name>	the war	Ellen	Where is she, in the fighting there? Has she got something to eat, somewhere to sleep? You were so concerned about your wife—and what does she think about [MASK]?— He had stopped instantly the blinking pantomime of derision.
<name>Hogwarts</name>	Hogwarts	July	If he took it out and killed, could that be a defence against what might come, once outside [MASK]’s protection? I am a boy with a pea-shooter; he wanted to say it aloud. The real little boys wandered back to the hut of their own accord.
<name>Uncle Harvey</name>	Uncle Harvey	July	We’ll get one of [MASK]’s relations to teach us how to preserve the skin.— —And if you don’t get anything?— The boy yelled after him. —What’ll you give me if you don’t get anything?
<name>Samuel</name>	Samuel	Mhatti	— —You killed the wrong fowl... But 1 don’t know what it’s all about.— He called back. —Exactly. [MASK], that one with the bad foot is a young one. It will lay well next year, even.
<name>George</name>	George	Daniel	Anything we had to give.— —I wonder what would have become of him.— The paraffin lamp was still burning but the blue eyes were closed. —Would have got old with us and been pensioned off.— [MASK] has the gun.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Lydia	Did the book, placing the pair in its context, give the reason she and [MASK], in their affection and ignorance, didn’t know? /\t least for Bam the days were roughly divided into cate-L V gories of work and rest.
<name>coffee</name>	coffee	Royce	You don’t give that for [MASK]. You give it already?— —No, I thought tonight. I thought maybe it’s something that makes you sleepy— —It’s—you know... It’s not for white people.— She was smiling as if he knew better.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Albert	You’ve got it. [MASK] brought it with the shoes I sent.— The old woman completed the description. —The fat woman with a pink cap like this— (She cocked a hand over one eye.) —Looks as if she likes to drink.
<name>Big Boy</name>	Big Boy	July	— One eye closed, hands in position, taking aim. Of course, ‘[MASK]’ was a name for whites to use; for fifteen years they had not been told what the chief’s subject really was called. —It’s a shot-gun, to kill birds.
<name>UNHCR</name>	UNHCR	July	It’s like a war. It is a war. We could have been killed. The houses where we stayed...they’ve been burned, bombed—some of them. People had to leave, our children might have been hurt. [MASK] brought us.
<name>Beetlejuice</name>	Beetlejuice	Superman	Conjure up [MASK] (he tossed open his hand at the children, who watched the serial at home) to bear them away? I know I gave him the fucking keys.— —Why don’t you admit we were mad to run. Why can’t you.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Bam	—Now I’m tell you.— —When?— He gestured; in his own time. —Tomorrow.— —[MASK] can go with you.— He was carrying on with his repair. —You, master, your children. All is going.
<name>Wolfe</name>	Wolfe	Bam	[MASK] rose from the bed like a man who has fallen asleep on the couch in his office when he was supposed to be working. —It’s a question of courtesy, apparently. I don’t think there’s anything sinister. Paying respects to the chief.
<name>Briony</name>	Briony	Bam	—It’s rubbish. Don’t let’s transpose our suburban adulteries. His wife knew nothing else about him, there, either.— [MASK] tore off a length from one of the toilet rolls she had not forgotten to provide, and went out into the bush.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lydia	[MASK] has her time to herself, her housework is varied by frequent saunters to the shops where she goes to pick up a loaf, starch for the washing, or simply to meet and talk to other black people on similar errands.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	July	[MASK]. —He’s not around.— —When did he get the keys?— —Oh, the other day.— There was nothing to be remarked or reproached, in that, between them. He had been in charge on the journey, they were on his ground, here.
<name>him</name>	him	Victor	If he hadn’t been with them watching the installation of the gumba-guntba they would have thought it was [MASK]. Quite possible he would boast that he was allowed to handle his father’s gun; would have somehow climbed up and taken it from its place in the roof.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Bam	Even box matches, you must fight for get it.— —The mine?— [MASK] answered her. —There’s an asbestos mine about sixty kilometres in the other direction—west. I suppose a lot of the men sign up to work there.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	July	[MASK] broke into snickering embarrassment at her ignorance of a kind of authority not understood—his; and anyway, he had told them—everybody—about the vehicle. —Told them what?— She was confident of his wily good sense; he had worked for her for years.
<name>Johannes</name>	Johannes	Dingus	She shaped for the white woman the few Afrikaans words she could find; these included a slang catch-all brought back from the mines and cities by men of the village who were the gang labourers of poorly-educated white foremen: [MASK], thing, whatsisname.
<name>Evangeline</name>	Evangeline	Maureen	The small child was his last-bom, conceived, as all his children were, on one of his home-leaves and born in his absence. [MASK] provided presents for him to send home on her behalf, at the news of each birth.
<name>the old ones</name>	the old ones	Martha	The others—[MASK]— were wise to keep the little hearth-fire alive always in the middle of the huts. Only those still thinking as if they were living with bathrooms en suite would have decided, civil-izedly, the custom was unhygienic and too hot.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	July	There is always something to say: the formula for the roadside breakdown. —What’s the trouble?— [MASK]’s voice came between grunts. —No, is coming all right. That pipe, like always, it’s little bit loose— —Oh the exhaust.
<name>Max</name>	Max	Victor	She would have thought toilet rolls were some of the few essentials she had thought to bring. The things that had got in, bundled along (let alone the racing-car track [MASK] had smuggled)! She came upon a gadget for taking the dry cleaner’s tags off clothes without breaking your nails.
<name>Lyd</name>ia	Lydia	Lydia	[MASK] swings the case—it contains a blazer, gym shoes as well as a load of books—onto her head. Sometimes they giggle and are in cahoots —Don’t tell you saw, hey Lydia—(When she has come from school on the back of a boy’s bicycle instead of safely by bus.)
<name>Chinua Achebe</name>	Chinua Achebe	Bam	To them, a church or schoolhouse—the kind of utility structure, a ‘building’ rather than a large hut by virtue of its brick construction and rectangular shape, about which [MASK] had once presented a paper (Needs and Means in Rural African Architecture).
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	July	Not with the means they had satisfied themselves with. The words were not there; his mind, his anger, had no grip. —You saw he ‘let me’ drive, going there?... A treat for me. [MASK]’s pretty sure of himself these days.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Gina	Her tender curls sift sunlight, one pink-soled foot hooks round a tiny black ankle as she waits for her friend [MASK]. The little girls smile and don’t speak before the others; their friendship is too deep and secret for that.
<name>she</name>	she	Maureen	He felt humbled, towards [MASK], but saw she did not share this— she was frightened into sulks? But she got up and gathered the burrs and went to throw them in the embers of their cooking-fire outside, making sure, with a strange precision, that they took the flame properly.
<name>Mr. Avery</name>	Mr. Avery	Martha	He was lost to her behind [MASK]’s chicken-house on stilts and the water-tank when he reached the village. In the afternoon there was a deafening, fading and lurching bellow through the air; it was the gumba-gumba being tried out, the children reported.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Martha	She went to his hut—not his private quarters, but the home of his women. [MASK] was bathing the baby boy in a basin set on a box. Flashing tears of pure anger he appealed to the one—anyone—who had arrived to rescue him from soap and water.
<name>he</name>	he	Daniel	You were like his father, weren’t you. You can’t say to me he didn’t tell you?— Two gnats she had swatted against her face stuck drowned in sweat on her cheek. —Don’t tell me what [MASK] he tell me.
<name>John</name>	John	Bam	[MASK] spoke up with independent pleasantness. —You shouldn’t bother. I’ve told you. I can chop my own wood. You mustn’t do it.— —The women bring the wood. You see all the time, the women are doing it.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bam	— She was stirring the meal thickening on the Primus. Spoon dripping in her hand, she looked at [MASK], considering what could be done for him rather than what he had said. —But jam will be good—a dollop of jam with this...—
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Maureen	She was offered a sausage; shook her head, dumb with dreamy responsibility or make-believe. No doubt his daughter was full of pap anyway. He and [MASK] were both fascinated by her. Her eyes were crudely blue in the mask of a dirty face.
<name>the child</name>	the child	Royce	—Of course. I’ll bring them back to you.— —Tell me?— —Of course, yes of course.— He looked at her, looked away. —Tomorrow I’m go get medicine for [MASK]. That child he’s sick.
<name>Kezia</name>	Kezia	Royce	— The demijohn of water was empty. [MASK], the littlest, kept asking for Coca-Cola: —Then buy some. Go to the shop-man and buy some.— She put paraffin tins of river water on the fire.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bam	She would cool the boiled water overnight; —It’s madness to let them drink that stuff straight from the river. They’ll get ill.— [MASK] got the blaze going. —I assure you, they’ve been drinking water wherever they find it, already...
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Royce	the approaching voices of their children. But she would not let him avoid the logical conclusion of his question. She was telling him as [MASK] raced up, prancing, tripping and shadow-boxing one of his own heroic fantasies of adult life: —How.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	July	She dragged the lame stool [MASK] had supplied ‘for the children’ out where she had a view of the bush and began. But the transport of a novel, the false awareness of being within another time, place and life that was the pleasure of reading, for her, was not possible.
<name>Shylock</name>	Shylock	Shylock	Everybody he’s like money. Of course—[MASK]’s gesture from a man so poor he had nothing to offer in the city but his own pound of flesh, and nothing else to gain there beyond money; money in the beggarly denominations a servant knows.
<name>God</name>	God	July	Then he came heavily on, as if through crowds in a path cleared for him by [MASK]. A good thing there had not been time to get back into the vehicle; it would be disrespectful not to be standing for this meeting.
<name>my future</name>	my future	Ellen	It’s not the keys for your kitchen. Fifteen years I’m work for your kitchen, your house, because my wife, my children, I must work for them. Take it.— —If all you can think about is what happened back there, what about [MASK]?
<name>Queenie</name>	Queenie	Nora	—You know I didn’t make the food. There was the Xhosa woman, the cook.— —How must I know, I didn’t see her— —Nomvula. The one they called [MASK]. You saw her on the photo. One Christmas.
<name>Sammy</name>	Sammy	July	She could go to the river but no farther, and not often. When she did go she did so believing it better not to go at all than risk being seen, now. [MASK] came to fetch her family’s clothes for the women to wash down there.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	July	No one remembered where the water-tank came from. [MASK] said he would ask the old woman but never did, although she sat outside the women’s hut most of the day, on the ground, making brooms out of some special grasses the women collected.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	July	— Bundles of notes were bits of paper, in this place; did not represent, to her, the refrigerator full of frozen meat and ice-cubes, the newspapers, water-borne sewage, bedside lamps money could not provide here. But its meaning was not dissociated, for [MASK]’s villagers.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Gina	[MASK] pulled a kitten for each of them from the cat’s teats and the minute creatures were possessed by a tension of claws and mewling as much too great for them as the boy’s anger had been for him. There came the expected admonition from a parent—the mother.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Bam	— [MASK] got up and had the menacing aspect of maleness a man has before the superego has gained control of his body, come out of sleep. His penis was swollen under his rumpled trousers. He went off round the huts, from one to another.
<name>Mothers</name>	Mothers	July	The mother thought there were pleasanter sights for the children than—in particular—some of the women (not [MASK]’s, ever) getting drunk with their babies on their backs, and going to pee only as far away as their staggering would carry them.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	July	[MASK]’s knowledge or instinct that in country dorps the black petrol attendants often live in sheds behind the garage-and-general-store complex—on that they had kept going, on and on, although they had left with only enough fuel to take them less than halfway.
<name>Friday</name>	Friday	Victor	[MASK] he’s twenty-one January, isn’t it? This one he’s Christmas Day.— The white children had seen the servant’s photograph of his children, in his wallet along with his pass-book, back there.
<name>he</name>	he	July	When the lesson petered out he ahd his friend sat about on their hunkers—too far away to make out what they were doing; just talking, no doubt, [MASK] stimulated and eager to communicate, as everyone is when acquiring a new skill, the stages at which mastery eluded or came to him.
