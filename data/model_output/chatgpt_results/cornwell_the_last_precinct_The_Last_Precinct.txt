<name>the officer</name>	the officer	Stanfield	So it should still be right where it was. The rope should be right there where it was.” I refrain from showing my complete disgust with [MASK]’s sloppy policing. I don’t probe any further or suggest to him he ought to do exactly what he threatened: quit.
<name>Joel</name>	Joel	Marino	“I’ve never had anybody die here,” she whines some more. “Not much worse can happen to a place.” “Hey,” [MASK] quips to her above the noise of sawing, “you’ll probably get business from the publicity.”
<name>Dumbarton</name>	Dumbarton	Dumb	“They’d already bagged the body by the time I got there. [MASK] as a bag of hammers, all of ’em.” The man in the Polaroids is light-skinned with handsome features and short, tightly curled hair dyed egg-yolk yellow.
<name>Adnan</name>	Adnan	Benton	but maybe you’d better be sure why you’re getting into all this. Don’t go on a witch hunt ’cause you want to pay back the fucker who might have sent that shit to [MASK] and maybe had to do with him being killed.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Marino	He has old scars on his knees and left elbow, but nothing fresh except the abrasions from being bound and gagged. What happened to you? Why did you die? He remains silent. Only [MASK] is talking in a blunt, loud way to disguise how unsettled he is.
<name>he</name>	he	Benny	“She disappeared when?” I want to know. “Oh, I don’t know.” A shrug. “Last week.” “Well, [MASK] was pretty torn up about it, too,” I comment, watching for his reaction.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Marino	Christmas speeds away from us. We finally get around to opening gifts at half past ten, and [MASK] groggily plays Santa, handing out boxes and trying to be festive. But his mood has gotten only darker and any attempts at humor have a bite.
<name>defendant</name>	defendant	Chandonne	Do you understand?” ‘Yes.” “And if you don’t have a lawyer or can’t afford one, a lawyer will be provided to you free of charge. Do you understand?” At this, [MASK] reaches for his Pepsi again.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Chandonne	This is important. My doorbell activates the camera system. Had [MASK] rung the bell, I would have been able to see him on a video screen inside the house. “I don’t know,” he replies. “I saw the knocker and used it.”
<name>him</name>	him	Chandonne	I need you not to hate him.” I am silent. I don’t want to give [MASK] any more of myself than he has already taken. I feel tears of frustration and fury and blink them back. “How can you help me?”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Edith	Everything’s moved indoors for the winter.” [MASK] slips out of her jacket and drapes it over the back of the sofa. “Cataloging artifacts, writing up the findings, all the things we can’t get around to while we’re working on the site.
<name>her</name>	her	Lucy	I have stood up to anyone who tried to interfere with [MASK], including her mother, who has rewarded my efforts with nothing but abuse. “You’re supposed to respect me,” I say to my niece as I wipe tears with my palm.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Marino	“I can tell you everybody I know about,” [MASK] answers. “But I haven’t been here every time somebody else has. So I can’t say I know who everybody is.” I sigh and lean my back against the fireplace.
<name>him</name>	him	Benton	That is why you are such an effective witness. You evoke images so the common person can understand. Why did you not tell [MASK] the associations you are just now telling me?” I stop rocking and reposition my broken arm, resting the cast in my lap.
<name>He</name>	He	Anna	My elbow throbs slowly and deeply as we eat. Whatever my problems are, I resist talking about them, as if to voice them will somehow give them life—as if they don’t have life already. [MASK] doesn’t push. We are quiet.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Marino	“And what do you mean by normally?" “That’s what I’m getting to. [MASK] got a call from the Manhattan D.A.’s office.” “This morning? This is the new development?” I am baffled.
<name>La Reina</name>	La Reina	Scarpetta	[MASK]?’ He says that everyone in the city knows her. I ask where she lives and say I’m a tourist. He takes me to her neighborhood but we don’t go in because there are guards and a gate. But I know enough to find her.
<name>he</name>	he	Chandonne	“By the way.” I am stuck on another matter, namely, my credibility. “How does [MASK] explain that there were two chipping hammers at my house? Yes, I bought one at the hardware store, as I have told you.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Berger	[MASK] stops the tape again. “Did he have a body odor?” I ask her. “When you sat in the room with him early this morning.” I indicate the television. “When you interviewed him, did he have ...”
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Stubbornness	“You know, I was going to put on coffee,” I say to him. “Would you mind?” “Mind what?” [MASK] holds him in his chair. “Mind putting on a pot.
<name>too</name>	too	Lucy	They’d find more nails to drive into my reputation as they hang me on their bureaucratic, bullshit cross. Why the hell would I want to do that to myself?” “If you don’t fight injustice, others will suffer from it, [MASK].
<name>Freud</name>	Freud	Kay	A strange thing for a psychiatrist to admit, yes? I give you this lesson for a reason, [MASK]. After you read my letter, you must destroy it and never admit it existed. I know you well. Such a small covert act will be hard for you.
<name>May</name>	May	Anna	It doesn’t matter that [MASK] no more had a choice about who stayed in her family home than she had a say about whom she had sex with when she was seventeen. She would not be forgiven if others knew.
<name>it</name>	it	Rocky	No conflict. Nothing I can do about it. And [MASK]’s poison.” Our conversation continues into the bay, where we stand in the cold by our cars. The starkness of the bare concrete around us seems a symbol of the realities I now face.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Marino	“In other words, I basically said I’m glad she’s dead.” “So’s everybody who knew her,” [MASK] retorts. “And I’ll be glad to tell the fucking special grand jury that.”
<name>Joel</name>	Joel	Benton	And now it is your penance to eradicate other monsters, perhaps? To do it for [MASK], because you let monsters murder him? You did not save him?” My helplessness, my outrage boil over. “He didn’t save himself, goddamn it.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Aaron	[MASK] takes my coat. He indicates he is fine and pleased to see me, using few words because he has mastered the art of being gracious with little noise. Just off the entry hall, on either side, are two rather stiff parlors of Brussels carpet and formidable antiques.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Berger	Eating there, working there?” [MASK] pushes ahead. “Eating there by myself. She walked in, also by herself. I had a very nice bottle of Italian wine. A nineteen-ninety-three Massolino Barolo. She was very beautiful.”
<name>the protagonist</name>	the protagonist	Kiffin	We fill three bags, and he cuts open a fourth and drapes sections of black plastic over the baby carriage and tapes them together. While he is doing this, he explains to [MASK] that it is possible someone scared off the family who was staying in this tent.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Marino	“So predictable. People blame the prey not the predator, criticize the injured not the asshole who did it.” I tremble in the dark. “Goddamn you. Goddamn you, [MASK].” “I still can’t believe you opened your door!”
<name>Tris</name>	Tris	Jeff	My notoriety is reflected in people’s eyes. My heart sinks. “Good morning, [MASK],” I say as I walk past the console. A nod. I pass my plastic ID over the electronic eye and the door leading into my side of the building unlocks.
<name>Tris</name>	Tris	Anna	I feel no remorse,” I tell [MASK]. “What do you feel?” I close my eyes for a moment, firelight moving across my lids. “Sick. I can’t think about those deaths without feeling sick. What I did wasn’t wrong.
<name>Kemper</name>	Kemper	Berger	It is a good question. Stomping and kicking would add other shadings to the emotions of the crime. “Hands are more personal than feet,” [MASK] remarks. “That’s been my experience in lust murders. Rarely do I see kicking, stomping.”
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Chandonne	I don’t want to, but I’m trying to be cooperative.” [MASK] blows out smoke. “Please go on. In as much detail as you can remember.” “We kissed for a while and it quickly progressed.” He says nothing more.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Stanfield	“Do we know where he got the rope?” I push aside his annoying assumptions. “His stepdaddy says there’s all kinds of rope in the barn,” [MASK] replies. “Well, they call it a barn but it’s where they just keep junk.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Marino	Lot of people just leave their key in the room and I don’t know they’re gone until I go in to clean up. You know, I left my cigarettes in the house,” she says to [MASK] without looking at him. “You mind?”
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Stanfield	“He is a goddamn brother-in-law, you want to know the truth.” He says this so pitifully and with such candor that everybody laughs. [MASK] perks up a little bit. He sits higher against the pillows. “And you’re
<name>him</name>	him	Stanfield	He is extremely upset. “What about [MASK]?” I ask darkly. “I thought he was quitting.” “I wish he would. The guy’s an idiot. He calls about this case and guess what else? Apparently, he goes to the scene.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Marino	[MASK] snorts and takes a swallow of bourbon. “Gets my vote,” he retorts. “That and swiping your chipping hammer. Can’t think of anybody else who’d do it. I know every guy who went in there, in your house.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Joyce	As much we can go with any such theory about why people do what they do.” “And it was important that [MASK] do the excisions carefully and not damage the faces. Which is why he did not shoot his victims, certainly not in the head.
<name>Dad</name>	Dad	Benton	[MASK] had to watch. He had to listen. I always knew. He’d come home looking gray. He wouldn’t talk much during dinner, wouldn’t eat much, and on those nights he drank more than usual.” “But he wouldn’t tell you . . .”
<name>She</name>	She	Marino	She looks at me as if in search of a cue. “Good,” I tell her. “Let’s hear it.” ‘Yeah. I'm all ears,” [MASK] responds. “I’ve run him through quite a number of databases.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Kay	If that’s what I hear you saying. If that is what you’re saying.” “It is what I am asking.” She butters a roll. “It is what I am asking you, [MASK],” she somberly repeats.
<name>Marlee</name>	Marlee	Berger	“You’ve sure been through it. Can I ask a question. We can ask, can’t we?” “Please,” [MASK] replies. “I know what I think,” the juror in the flower-printed dress comments to me.
<name>Derek</name>	Derek	Terry	When I reflect back his scalp, I find no contusions or fractures hiding underneath. I plug a Stryker saw into the overhead cord reel and realize I need more than one hand. [MASK] helps me steady the head as I push the whining, vibrating semicircular blade through the skull.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Anna	I have everything figured out and resolved, just that fast, because I am a pro at ducking any truth that directly impacts my inner self, my well being, my feelings. “Tell me, [MASK],” I say. Silence fills the kitchen.
<name>Curley's wife</name>	Curley's wife	Chandonne	It is her method to offer silences more than opinions. Grief throbs in my chest and my heart beats in a staccato of fear. “I suppose I’d be punished if I’d killed [MASK],” I add. “Without question I’ll be punished because I didn’t.”
<name>friend</name>	friend	Terry	“Were you there?” “Nope, and you wasn’t either, [MASK], which is why they won.” “Probably true.” I pluck a surgical knife off the cart as the phone rings.
<name>Tris</name>	Tris	Anna	“I’m okay with it,” 1 answer [MASK]. “Really and truly. It simply isn’t my preference. It’s not my choice.” “People choose?” “In a sense.” Of this I am certain.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Greg	She must mean the person who answered the phone. “Actually, they’re from [MASK]’s first marriage. Two teenagers. And today I’d sell them to the first bidder. Hell, I’d pay someone to take them.” “No, you wouldn’t!”
<name>Hank</name>	Hank	Marino	“All of us wanted to blow him away. You don’t think [MASK] did?” She meets my eyes. “You don’t think every cop, every agent who showed up at your house didn’t want to pull the trigger?
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Berger	[MASK] is into it. “He might have shoved his way in and the chase begins. The door is unlocked the entire time he is mutilating her body in the bedroom.” “That would suggest he was out of control and taking big risks,” I point out.
<name>Laura</name>	Laura	Anna	I guess at [MASK]’s, but I dread the necessary chill between us. I didn’t even see her this morning, and a helpless feeling of loneliness settles over me and seems to push me down in my seat.
<name>my father</name>	my father	Lucy	“That’s right,” I reply. “I don’t think anyone can imagine something like that until it happens. I know if I were the one driving up and it was [MASK] in the yard, and he had tried to murder her, then ...
<name>He</name>	He	Anna	What is it with her and shooting people? Thank goodness she did not kill again.” The weight in my chest presses down harder. My blood seems to have turned into a heavy metal. “What is it with her and killing?” [MASK] pushes.
<name>Me</name>	Me	Lucy	So far I’ve counted five bylines. They must’ve had the entire fucking news staff working this thing without our having a clue. Including an aerial shot of your house . . .” “What about [MASK]?” I ask with more force.
<name>new</name>	new	Asian	It is eerie, but in recent weeks his light brown hair has started falling out before our very eyes, clinging to his clothing, drifting through the air like down, as if he is molting. He frowns at the misspelling on the toe tag. “The guy from the removal service must be [MASK].
<name>Montresor</name>	Montresor	Marino	I am not dead, but maybe it is worse to be the accused. I hate even to suggest the next stage of my undoing. It is overkill. “[MASK],” I say, “try the key in my door.” He hesitates, frowning.
<name>her</name>	her	Anna	Mostly, I want her to believe I am not upset with her, that I realize she is as victimized by circumstances as I am. I say circumstances because I am no longer sure who is holding a gun to [MASK]’s head and ordering her to divulge confidences about me.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Marino	Dangerous, fucking stupid in light of his situation. He one of those types who had a hard time keeping his pants on?” She doesn’t answer him. Tears jump out. “You know what, folks?” [MASK] scans the room.
<name>Trudy</name>	Trudy	Marino	“This mean you can’t work cases no more?” [MASK] says to me. “Not at all,” I reply. “I’ll be acting chief until the governor decides otherwise.” No one asks me what I plan to do with the rest of my life.
<name>Harper</name>	Harper	Turk	Don’t tell me she’s pregnant,” he adds ironically as he holds the door for me and we leave the bay. Inside the autopsy suite, [MASK] is hosing off my workstation, water slapping and steel grates clanking loudly as she sponges off the table.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Anna	The evil lives on. That is my conundrum. I don’t want them killed, but I know the damage they do while they’re alive. Lose-lose, any way you look at it,” I tell [MASK].
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Anna	Uncomfortable with the idea, I hold it away from me and study it like an organ I am dissecting. “That never entered my mind,” I decide. “So it probably wasn’t there or I would have picked up the signals.” [MASK] doesn’t answer me.
<name>George</name>	George	Chandonne	[MASK] goes on to claim he began to get fearful about coming to see me. He claims there were a lot of police cars cruising the neighborhood, and that at one point when he came to my house late, there were two police cruisers parked in front.
<name>Herculaneum</name>	Herculaneum	Bray	The wounds from both the blunt-bladed tip and the pointed tip were identical in configuration and measurement to those on [MASK]’s body, particularly to the punched-out areas in her cartilage and skull, which are excellent for retaining the shape—or tool mark—of whatever penetrated them.
<name>Dr. Lecter</name>	Dr. Lecter	Marino	She wants to see if I can be objective when talking about my own case. She wants to see if I can stick to the facts. I hear [MASK] down the hall. He walks in with three steaming Styrofoam cups and sets them on the table, sliding a black coffee my way.
<name>Natalie</name>	Natalie	Barbosa	“He wouldn’t,” I cut her off with a weary wave of my hand. “No way. Sure, he had access, but no way. And based on his account of the crime scene, he never saw [MASK]’s body.
<name>Kylie</name>	Kylie	Lucy	made for [MASK] in gold. The timing is perfect, especially in light of late-breaking revelations about her plans in life. “Just what exactly will you do with your own helicopter? You’re really getting one?” I ask.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Chandonne	“She’s dead.” She lets this scenario hang pregnantly as we seek out the laundry room. She knows I can relate to the distraction and mind-searing horror of opening the front door and having [MASK] suddenly rush in from the darkness like a creature out of hell.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Chandonne	[MASK] ought to pay for what he tried to do to her. And he sure as hell should pay for what he did to the other two women. And he ought to get the death penalty. At least down here, we’d fry him.”
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Berger	We’re going to stop now. That’s enough. Calm down, calm down.” Frames flicker and bars fill the screen before it turns the bright blue of a perfect afternoon. [MASK] turns off the VCR. I sit in stunned silence.
<name>Dr. Seward</name>	Dr. Seward	Anna	I asked him what in the world was the matter, and he ordered me back to bed, jabbing his finger at me. At this point, [MASK] interrupts me. “Nothing else might have preceded this? No forewarning whatsoever?”
<name>he</name> (Note: There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to a pronoun)	he (Note: There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to a pronoun)	Talley	He’d have to be at least in his seventies and he sure moves around a lot and uses post office boxes instead of physical addresses. He’s also bought a lot of cars, sometimes changing vehicles a couple times a year.” “Did [MASK] ever tell you where he was born?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Arnold	“[MASK]?” I say when he answers on the sixth ring. “Could you please open the bay door?” “Oh, yes ma’am.” He sounds groggy and confused, as if I just woke him up. “Doing it right now, ma’am.
<name>Cheryl</name>	Cheryl	Benton	This was an alien who had invaded [MASK]’s body. “Nothing,” I answer her. “No warning.” I rock slowly, nonstop. Smoldering wood pops. “The last place I wanted to be with him that moment was in bed.
<name>Augustus</name>	Augustus	Anna	If you don’t think tomorrow or next year or the year after that will be better, why bother?’ ” I stop for a moment, rocking. I tell [MASK], “Well, he stopped bothering.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Marino	“See how quickly you guys can get these into the computer,” I tell him, all business and not especially friendly. He is keeping secrets from me and I am pissed off by his peacock display of adolescent behavior. “We’ve got a bad situation here, [MASK].”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Marino	And I keep thinking about the Tlip file. It has hardly been out of my mind since I looked at it on Christmas Day. The telephone rings at close to midnight and I assume it is [MASK] finally returning my page.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Marino	“We got a gay guy and now an Indian. Oh boy, oh boy.” [MASK] shakes his head. “We got to keep this out of politics, out of circulation and I mean it.”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Jay	I explain that I was having a terribly hard time breathing after [MASK] tied me up and gagged me. I was panicking and began to hyperventilate, which means, I explain, that I was taking such rapid, shallow breaths, I couldn’t get sufficient oxygen.
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Turk	She is so attentive and officious and almost salutes me when she suddenly appears at the end of the table. [MASK], as everyone knows her, always refers to me as “Chief." I suppose for her Chief is a rank and doctor isn’t.
<name>Matthew</name>	Matthew	Benton	What didn’t these poor people know?” “That sexual sadists are only more aroused by crying. By begging. By fear,” I reply. “Do you think [MASK] cried or begged when his killers abducted him and took him to that dark building?”
<name>Anaïs</name>	Anaïs	Anna	“Gentle and sensitive.” “Ah. Thoughtful. Well, there is something to be said for that,” [MASK] says with a hint of irony that draws attention to what I have just revealed. “It was never hungry enough, never purely erotic.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jay	[MASK] gets up from the bed again. He is sweating, his face pale. I struggle to breathe through my nose and my heart is hammering like a machine gun as my entire body begins to panic. I try to will myself to calm down.
<name>Forman</name>	Forman	Formalin	Where the jar of the chemical, the formulin . . .” “[MASK],” I quietly correct her. “Right,” she says. “Exactly, I mean, where exactly was the jar when you picked it up?”
<name>Zaphod</name>	Zaphod	Chandonne	“Front-page photo of [MASK] in the stretcher being carried into the E.R., his hairy shoulders sticking out of the sheets like some sort of long-haired dog. Of course, his face was covered by bandages, but you certainly could get the sense of how grotesque he is.
<name>the perpetrator</name>	the perpetrator	Chandonne	You have no reason to trust me. Maybe you have no reason to trust anyone. But you really have no factual reason not to trust me as a professional whose singular intent is to make [MASK] pay for his crimes—if he murdered these women.”
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Bray	“Christ, I didn’t have a chipping hammer when [MASK] was murdered. I’ve been confused because I bought it the day her body was found, not the day she died. She was murdered the night before, her body found the next day.”
<name>the driver</name>	the driver	Chandonne	They need you.” She stares out at the cold, empty house beyond our windshield, indicating [MASK]’s other victims, the ones who didn’t survive. They need me. “Okay.” She returns us to why we are waiting in this driveway.
<name>T-L-P</name>	T-L-P	TLP	But one day I made mention of his Tip file and he corrected me and said the file was actually his T-L-P file which he pronounced tlip. I next asked what [MASK] stood for, and he said The Last Precinct.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Lucy	Hospital staff held me for observation until late afternoon and detectives were in and out of the examination room. They took my clothes. My niece, [MASK], had to bring me something to wear. I have had no sleep. The telephone pierces the air like a foil.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Anna	I’m sure [MASK] can find a spare bed. You’re not driving anywhere and none of us care to be subjected to you right now.” He gives me a defiant, mocking stare as he lifts his glass again. “Least I’m being honest,” he retorts.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Doc	Hell, I wouldn’t go down to that stink-hole half as much as I do if it wasn’t for you being there, [MASK]. You’re the only damn thing that gives any life to that joint, no kidding.” I hug him.
<name>Nisha</name>	Nisha	Bray	But, he points out, that doesn’t mean I didn’t buy such a tool after [MASK]’s murder to fabricate an alibi. “You know, to make it look like you didn’t own one or even know what she was killed with until after the fact.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Marino	and I’d meet him there. He was a nice-looking man, well-dressed, didn’t look like the usual I get, that much stands out clear as day.” “He tell you his name?” [MASK] asks her.
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Benton	The guy says to tell you he called and will be an hour late to dinner, identifies himself as [MASK] and hangs up. So add that to the mix. No wonder I’m going bald.” “Why didn’t you tell me?”
<name>Julian</name>	Julian	Lucy	Philly cops went through everything in his hotel room and then turned it over to me. He would also figure you’re going to see his stuff at some point. Maybe [MASK], too.” “I think the point is he couldn’t be sure of who might see the file.
<name>Reid</name>	Reid	McGovern	“Not unless he owns an air freight company.” “Kind of eerie, right?” [MASK] adds. “Considering how much shipping the Chandonne family is involved in. So maybe there’s a connection. It’s way too soon to say.”
<name>John</name>	John	Kay	“Don’t blame me. No one has a right to blame me for what he did. Why are you blaming me?” “We create our own worlds. We destroy our own worlds. It is that simple, [MASK],” she answers me.
