<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Oyd	Then he would come home with the desire to talk to [MASK] about the beauty of the day and all the boats in the harbor growing strong in him, but he knew it would bring her more pain and disappointment than happiness, so in the end he never said anything about bis feelings and his thoughts.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Oyo	They say it spoils the Party’s name.’ ‘Foolishness! Complete foolishness!’ fumed the old woman. ‘So what is to be done?’ asked [MASK]. There was a long silence, during the whole of which the man could not help smiling softly to himself.
<name>She</name>	She	Oyo	‘We can sign for her.* ‘I don't think I can sign,' said the man. [MASK] stared at him in amazement and disappointment. But the moment was brief, and therefore almost entirely private.' ‘1 will sign it.’
<name>Mr. Birling</name>	Mr. Birling	Koomson	Perhaps in the pocket, but nowhere else.’ His wife and her mother were looking downward in utter humiliation. [MASK] made a noise as if to clear his throat, but he had nothing to say, or had not yet thought of anything.
<name>salt</name>	salt	kola	The driver had not bought it yet, and each of the policemen had said to him, in front of everybody. 'Even [MASK] gives pleasure in the chewing.’ In each case the driver had smiled and given the law twenty-five pesewas, and the law was satisfied.
<name>Minister</name>	Minister	Koomson	nodding vigorously now. ‘And so that is what I wanted to ask you about. Minister,* said the old woman. ‘Ah, yes,’ [MASK] said, leaning forward in his seat. Things are very difficult these days. Very difficult.’
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Koomson	The man walked slowly behind everybody else, saying nothing. Outside, the driver was still hunched over the big car’s wheel. To escape the cold night air he had roiled up the glass windows, 138 and this made it hard for [MASK] to wake him up.
<name>Crane</name>	Crane	Finding	Instead, the invitation was uttered in a manner that made it plain that the speaker knew he was doing his guests a favor. The two men entered. [MASK] nothing to sit on. they stood in the middle of the little room, the boatman facing them.
<name>dear</name>	dear	Oyo	The old woman sat down in an armchair, letting out a whole series of sighs that sounded like complaints unspoken. The younger woman got up. but before she could walk out her mother asked her, ‘Where are you going, [MASK]?’
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Koomson	‘She will be all right,’ said [MASK]. ‘If they don't trouble her she will be all right.’ ‘She has enough money?’ •Uh-huh.’ ’Where is she now?’ ‘With her mother.’
<name>She</name>	She	Oyo	They have eaten,’ [MASK] said. Then, again unnecessarily, she 160 motioned to him to come quietly, and the two of them entered the inner room. It was quite dark inside. The uncll was something the man had not at all expected.
<name>She</name>	She	Oyo	She sat languidly in her chair, and for some time she did nothing but stroke her wig from front to back in motions that were long, slow, and very studied. Ts that the dining room?’ [MASK] asked, pointing.
<name>Death</name>	Death	Estella	‘And [MASK] was with him. I suppose?1 she asks at last. 'Uh-huh,' he nods, turning to look at her. He sees instead the eyes of his children. O you loved ones, spare your beloved the silent agony of your eyes.
<name>Magwitch</name>	Magwitch	Koomson	The window led outside, out of the yard, and was possibly large enough for a man to go through, even a man of [MASK]’s size. But the hole of the window had three upright iron bars stuck in it. Now these bars looked most unnecessary and cruelly strong.
<name>fear</name>	fear	Ghana	‘1 can see it.’ The naked man laughed. ‘1 have seen it so clearly I have spent a long time running from it.’ ‘She was right, but it was not philosophy she was talking about. It was [MASK].’
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Koomson	The thing did not move. The man stooped to take a closer look at it where it came against the back wall. There were nails in it, fixing the box seat to the building. The man looked at [MASK]. 'We can still try,’ he said.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Koomson	'Help me push the can aside,’ he said. It took [MASK] some time to make up his mind, but in the end, like a man at his own funeral, he stuck his hand in the other side of the hole and touched the can.
<name>Kafka</name>	Kafka	Koomson	the voice from inside shouted. [MASK] seemed to shrink from this human voice wanting to know who was out there, as if each sound, immediately it was uttered, bad formed itself into a needle and was pricking his skin. And the man stopped himself from answering.
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Oyo	[MASK] was seated at tbe big table, looking down at the top of it. She got up when she saw the man, and when he had come quite close she whispered in his ear,‘How he smdlsl’ ‘It is fear,’ he said, trying to sound casual.
<name>Holly</name>	Holly	Estella	‘She is a very funny girl,’ said [MASK], with a small, hard laugh. ‘She says she has fallen in love with a Jaguar, and she's going to kill herself if she can't have it.
<name>Beauvoir</name>	Beauvoir	Jack	But just then he saw the low house that looked like some long thing Battened against the earth, and they walked all the way to the unpainted door at the extreme end. Softly the man knocked on the door. Small, easy sounds inside, like the rustle of a mat disturbed. 'Hex [MASK])
<name>death</name>	death	Koomson	I have my family. I am in the middle.’ ‘Will you let yourself be destroyed first, then?* ‘I don’t know. When I speak of [MASK] my wife looks at the children and I can see how sorry she feels for herself.’
<name>Stench</name>	Stench	Tt	It was quite dark inside. The uncll was something the man had not at all expected. [MASK] was overpowering, as if come corrosive gas, already half liquid, had filled the whole room, irritating not only the nostrils, but also the inside, of eyes.
<name>the man</name> (since the passage does not provide any context clues to suggest a specific name)	the man (since the passage does not provide any context clues to suggest a specific name)	Koomson	The man took his and placed it next to himself on the table, away from the group. Then he opened the bottles of beer, pouring out the first mug for each person and leaving the half-empty bottles beside them. ‘Cheers!’ said [MASK].
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Deede	'Yes. [MASK],’ the man said. Television is veiy beautiful.' ‘You seel’ shouted the girl in triumph. The boy bared his teeth and pushed his head out menacingly toward the girl, but she only laughed.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Koomson	[MASK] was looking up at the ceiling with something like relief. But there, nothing could be seen except cement that had once been painted over with a sick yellow, blackened in large places by the midnight candles of constipated men when the small bulb was burned out.
<name>Miss Emily</name>	Miss Emily	Mike	They rose and died very quickly, with the passage of the bouses, but in the adult mind they left an unpleasant echo that turned the child’s every perception into the seed of an accusation that would reveal itself with growth. This house belong to [MASK].’
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Oyo	Now, as usual, the touch itself filled the tired mind with traces of blood and the color of flesh newly exposed, and the tortured face of a woman alone, then [MASK]’s forgiving eyes in the hospital afterward. when he had gone to visit her.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Koomson	‘She says she has fallen in love with a Jaguar, and she's going to kill herself if she can't have it. She wants us to get her the foreign exchange for it.’ ’I thought that was no longer possible,* said the man, looking at [MASK].
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Contractor	I cut timber. [MASK].’ 'If you can come back tomorrow ...’ the man was saying. But now the sick conciliatory smile had receded from the visitor’s face and in its place there was the impotent resentment of a cheated man.
<name>Salome</name>	Salome	Mammy	Even tbe old ones,’ the seller laughs, ‘even the old men.’ ‘[MASK], I am different.’ The suited man pays the seller. She takes the money and holds oo to the man's hand, looking intently into his face now.
<name>Marx</name>	Marx	Koomson	But the money is not the difficult thing. After all, the Commercial Bank is ours, and we can do anything,’ said [MASK]. ’Mmmmm,* the old woman nodded. ‘But they say we are socialist ministers, so we shouldn’t do these things.’
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Maanan	And often I remember [MASK] and the bitterness and the emptiness of life rise up in me. That is all.' Near the place of the prostitutes there were little puddles left by the gentle rain, some beginning to flow, looking for gutters.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Maanan	We were laughing at some impersonation of his. one empty afternoon, when after a long absence [MASK] came dressed to make a man faint and telling us nothing about where she had been. All she would say was that she had come to be at the rally.
<name>they</name>	they	Teacher	* ‘And so [MASK] runs.* ‘And so I run. 1 know I am nothing and will never be anything without them, and when most 1 wish to stop being nothing, then the desire to run back to those I have fled comes back with unbearable strength.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Maanan	‘Preferably [MASK].’ How could this have grown rotten with such obscene haste? Sometimes I think I will understand it. when 1 see it as one frightened man’s light from his own death. For he was not afraid of the old ones, the jokers.
<name>the man</name>	the man	Koomson	He did not seem to think there was anything else he could do now. Had fust,’ the man said. That is the only way.' Disgust came strongly into [MASK]'s face, struggling to suppress his earlier resignation. Outside in the yard, the noises increased.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Bcntil	Walking very slowly so as to consume time, he went in the direction of the house alone by itself, where he had gone earlier in the day with the beer. He found his friend [MASK] in and sat down to talk for a while.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Master	Now the voice within broke its silence. 'Ah. [MASK], is it you?’ How rapidly this voice had lost the accustomed reverence. There was fear in the boatman’s voice still, but on this night it was not the fear of the weak confronted with the powerful.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Oyo	‘Months ago you showed it to me, yes.’ There was a momentary flash of fury in the woman’s eyes. The man caught the driver’s eye in the rearview mirror, fascinated eyes. ‘No!’ said [MASK], 'I wasn’t speaking about that one.
<name>something</name> (There is no proper name in this sentence, so the output is a placeholder.)	something (There is no proper name in this sentence, so the output is a placeholder.)	Koomson	The table has food on it. The man moves forward and sits at it with his back to his guilt, resolving to break the heavy quiet ‘I saw [MASK] on my way borne.' be says. The wife is slow about showing any interest.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Oyo	Not as much as you like to think.’ ‘I am sure your mother is secretly in love with me, [MASK],’ he said. ‘Not in love,’ she answered. ‘Not in love, but she won’t bite you.’
<name>Jim's</name>	Jim's	Koomson'a	As the two drew nearer they saw four figures moving here and there around it. A lorry with a very noisy exhaust passed, and they saw it stop at the bridge. It was some time before it moved off. ‘Police barrier,’ the man said, placing a hand on [MASK] arm.
<name>Iq</name>	Iq	Koomson	Iq a moment [MASK] was gesturing with quick, desperate motions, pointing first at the light and then at the open window in his silent frenzy, the fear coming out of every piece of him. The man understood. He switched off the light.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Koomson	‘How, pure profit?’ the man asked. The old woman was staring at him, and winking with furious speed, but he ignored her. *1 mean,’ said [MASK], ‘after maintenance and crew pay and that sort of thing.'
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Koomson	So he took [MASK]’s arm and together they went across the gutter, their feet sinking now and then in places along the soft parts of the bottom, and on the other side they stamped upon the earth to get rid of some of the aged mud.
<name>her</name>	her	Koomson	Even a sigh from him spoiled the air some more. The man tried again, looking for a way out any way out. ‘Have you eaten?’ be asked ‘No.’ The sound from [MASK] was surprisingly hopeful. The man jumped up.
<name>Rumi</name>	Rumi	Maanan	let me wet it.' It was surprising that [MASK] could be so very happy and yet continue to speak so calmly. ‘Let it soak itself in love. Today things have gone inside me. and they have brought out what I have hidden in me.
<name>the cat</name>	the cat	Koomson	punctuated with increasing rapidity from below, destroyed the peace of the room. When tho man’s eyes had again adjusted to the darkness, he could see the vague luminosity of [MASK]’s eyes in the black space of his face.
<name>Mr. Thomas</name>	Mr. Thomas	Koomson	no, no!’ said [MASK] happily. ‘Wait till I tell you a story.’ His wife was frowning, but he was not looking at her. He closed his eyes and began. ‘Some people think being a Minister is all good-time.
<name>the doctor</name>	the doctor	Oyo	* Beneath his tongue the man felt something like a sharp sting. He turned away from the table and said softly to his wife, ‘Please don't cook any more fish for me.’ It was impossible to see the look in [MASK]’s eyes.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Oyo	Why do you always do that?’ *[MASK], you remember these things I don’t remember, that’s all.’ The woman uttered a sound of complete exasperation, as if she were trying hard to contain her anger but knew it would be impossible.
<name>she</name>	she	Koomson	* ‘That probably means your mother, not us We should remember to tell her when she comes.' The woman paused before answering. ‘It is not only for my mother that [MASK] will come.1 ‘What do you mean?' asked the man.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Oyo	She held his hand in a tight grasp. Then, in a voice that sounded as if she were stifling, she whispered, 'I am glad you never became like him.’ In [MASK]’s eyes there was now real gratitude.
<name>Mac</name>	Mac	Contrey	‘He is cracking them like tiger nuts.’ ‘[MASK], you would do the same____’ ‘True ... money swine.’ ‘Money swine.’ In a group the workers move off to wash their bands.
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Koomson	that his room was not a room at all, only a converted lavatory. ‘Greet the lady here.’ said [MASK]. ’She will be looking after the boat when I am not here. Do not forget her face.’
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Koomson	‘But that is what my people will not see. [MASK] is doing very well for himself.... These days any young man with brains can do very well. ... They make me feel like a criminal.’ ‘They are only urging you to get ahead.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Irresistible	[MASK] rides down clean, smooth bottoms of gutters cutting down the hill to mix the unchanneled mud below with water. And the water coming from the hills was always clean, like unused water, or like water used by ghosts without flesh.
<name>the house</name>	the house	wbat	And you can see that I have nothing in my hands. A few here know where I live. Not much is there. And even [MASK] is there is not my own. It is the kindness of a woman, one of you now here.
<name>Princess</name>	Princess	Estella	Instead, she turned the conversation. ‘I didn’t know your first born had become such a young lady. What is her name?’ ‘Princess.’ said [MASK]. ‘Is that her real name, or some sort of nickname?’
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Oyo	The man moved away from the wall and stopped just in front of the bookcase, as if he were looking for some title there. But his words did not stop. ‘One fine day [MASK] explained everything to me. I think it was when this boat scheme was first mentioned.
<name>She</name>	She	Estella	‘We’ll prepare for you.’ [MASK] said, smiling like a queen. The group went out into the night. The man walked slowly behind everybody else, saying nothing. Outside, the driver was still hunched over the big car’s wheel.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Koomson	[MASK] felt with a hand for the water. It made a hollow sound as it went down into his belly, and a wet belch rose from his throat. At that moment the doth at the window was illuminated, very briefly, be the light of a passing vehicle.
<name>he</name>	he	Koomson	It was again hard to see, since [MASK] did not want the door open. Only the sounds coming from him told the man how eagerly he was eating. They were greedy noises, the sucking noises of an impatient man hungrily pushing food into bis face.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Etse	They say he docs not go talking about himself. Only the work wc have to do.’ ‘He is another fool, then.’ [MASK] said, 'just like the others, talking to men without jobs about the work we have to do.’
<name>Daisy's</name>	Daisy's	Teacher	The man has long known of the pain of disappointment inside his friend. In his own way he too had felt it. and it was pathetic that in the past and even now all he had to soothe out the injury would be [MASK]'s remembered words.
<name>Maria</name>	Maria	Oyo	What is there to eat?' •Oh, and you yourself, you haven’t eaten.’ ‘I don’t fed hungry any more,* tbe man said ‘But we have to give him something to eat.’ [MASK] led the way into the kitchen.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Teacher	And no one wants what I happen to have. It's only words, after all.’ The man had said something earnest about the connectedness of words and the freedom of enslaved men, but then [MASK] had said one of the harshest things he had ever said.
<name>Jem</name>	Jem	Etse	You haven’t seen him yet.’ ‘Who?’ ‘The new one.’ ‘A new old lawyer, wanting to be white.’ [MASK] was not often angry. ‘No. He is new, and he is young.’
<name>Guinness</name>	Guinness	Star	He raised his mug dramatically and took a gulp, then exclaimed, imitating the man on the billboards. ‘Ah, [MASK]!' When the mug came down it was empty, and a small stream of beer was running down the Party man’s lower jaw.
<name>Mrs. Samsa</name>	Mrs. Samsa	Oyo	he began. The old woman cut him short. 'Ah yes, the suffering daughter of mine, what does she say?* ‘[MASK] asked me to bring the children along.’ 'Oh. I will take them!’ she exclaimed dramatically.
<name>the boy</name>	the boy	Koomson	Soon the huge rocks that had been thrown down on the shore for the building of the breakwater made it impossible for them to continue walking along the beach itself. The man took hold of [MASK] and helped him over the rocks to the base of the breakwater.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	T	He raised the spoon to bis mouth, and as he did so he caught the scent of perfume still on his hand. [MASK] shook hands with his wife, and I can smell her still. Her hand was wet with the stuff.'
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Maanan	Forgive me, [MASK], forgive us all if that is possible these days. I remember we said nothing at all about love, at this time when perhaps something said might have brought travelers back from frightening journeys, we said nothing about love itself.
<name>Marlon</name>	Marlon	Koomson	Everybody who wants speed goes there, and the only thing demanded of them is that they be good at fawning. Is that the place that changed the dock worker [MASK]? Or did he go there after he had changed? Because he had changed?
<name>them</name>	them	Oyo	‘What I don’t understand,' he said, ‘is my own feeling about it. I know I have done nothing wrong. I could even get angry with [MASK] about this. And yet, and yet I am the one who feds strange.’
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Koomson	The smell was truly unbearable. As if to {dead with him not to torment a poor fugitive with cruel questions, [MASK] sighed again, a very long, slow sigh that spoke dearly of his suffering. Even a sigh from him spoiled the air some more.
<name>Plato</name>	Plato	Plato	and would laugh with hate at the bringer of unwanted light if what they knew they needed was the dark. He had told a story he said had meant more to him in his unhappiness than any other story, something he called the myth of [MASK]’s cave.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Oyo	[MASK] had remained silent all this time, standing close to the door. But now, with a choking sound, she retreated into the hall outside. The man himself was filled with only one thought now: to get out of this room.
<name>Myra</name>	Myra	Oyo	‘I am sorry. That is not my intention.’ There was a note of real unhappiness in the voice now. and the man on the desk looked down at the cement floor beneath his feet. ’[MASK] flung my uselessness at me again this night.’
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Koomson	‘That fish came straight from [MASK]'s boat.’ The man could not think of anything to say. There was something in the air around the words that filled them with a certain unhealthiness. The man just chewed the piece in bis mouth over and over again, til!
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Koomson	'There's someone waiting over there,’ the man said, indicating the steward. ‘Oh, the steward boy.' [MASK] said, still playing with the loud noises from his huge toy. ‘By the way. what will you drink?’
<name>Kofi</name>	Kofi	Koomson	Then they walked on along the shore Near the Anafo area the man led [MASK] out first into the street and then down the small, dusty lanes of the neighborhood. ‘You know the boatman’s borne better than I,’ the man said.
<name>He</name>	He	Koomson	‘But will there be any profit in it?* he asked. The question seemed to have taken everybody by surprise, but once asked, it hung there in the air and would not just go away. [MASK] shifted in bis seat.
<name>Ali</name>	Ali	Gibran	'Then solemnly,like a man in great distress of spirit, he would go to another book of another stranger whom be called sometimes the Prophet and sometimes [MASK], and read: Would that you coukl live on the fragrance of the earth, and like an air plant be sustained by the light.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Teacher	Surely, something could still be done by a good man. First, [MASK] had asked the man, ‘Something for which people?’ But he had not waited for an answer. ‘The things people want, I do not have to give.
<name>Dewey</name>	Dewey	Thtf	[MASK] touch of the can had something altogether unexpected about it. It was cold, but not at all wet or slippery. It felt instead as if a multitude of little individual drops had been drying on the can for ages, but had never quite arrived at a totally dry crispness.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Maanan	It was not a weak, meaningless softness. Rather, it was as if [MASK]’s face was all I would ever need to look at to know that this was a woman being pushed toward destruction and there was nothing she or I could do about it.
<name>He</name>	He	Koomson	‘And the driver is you.’ ‘From that day 1 have not been able to stop wondering what went wrong with me, and where. [MASK] was my classmate.’ ‘You say that like a litany.' ‘He was not very intelligent.’
<name>Kwame</name>	Kwame	Nkrumah	’ said the man slowly, ‘you know who the real Nkrumaists are.’ The unionist turned round and went down to join his crowd. Through the windows their sounds came: old songs with the words changed from the old praise for [MASK] to insults for him.
<name>Green</name>	Green	ISO	The man closed his eyes, and like a piece of twine the [MASK] thought ran round and round inside his head that it would never be possible to look at such comfortable things and fed a real contempt for them. Envy, certainly, but not contempt.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Koomson	When the boatman had slowed the boat down almost to a stop, the man threw his inner tube out and away from the boat, in the direction of the shore. ‘You are going, then/ said [MASK], coming forward to the man. ‘Yes.’
<name>Phyllis</name>	Phyllis	Maanan	They have lost all theirs, trying to be white.’ [MASK] laughed like a happy woman, and when she calmed down she said, ‘You people are late. You haven’t seen him yet.’ ‘Who?’ ‘The new one.’
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Koomson	Then he went down the bole again, the disgust returning to share his face with his resignation. This time [MASK]’s body slipped through easily enough, past the shoulders and down the middle. But at the waist it was blocked by some other obstacle.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Prcstea	You will never prosper. Da' The man said nothing, did not even look back at tbe hurier of tbe insult. There was an answering signal on the machine, and be listened to it, not bothering to write down the letters. It said ‘[MASK].’
<name>Mr. Stevens</name>	Mr. Stevens	Koomson	‘It’s just a matter of signing some papers, and knowing what to do, that is all,’ said [MASK]. The man sat staring at the little group in the center of the room. He was tapping a noiseless rhythm on the table.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Koomson	asked [MASK]. Another grudging ‘Yes.’ The fishing harbor was not far from the boatman's house, and they met no one on the way there, though a few times they saw people in lonely motion in the far distance, and heard indistinct voices in the night.
<name>Lenin</name>	Lenin	Estella	’What is wrong with this socialism?’ the man interrupted. [MASK] laughed. 13S 'What is wrong, he asks. What is wrong, indeed!’ •Perhaps you know things we do not know,’ said the man, very calmly.
<name>others</name>	others	Oyo	At such times the man was 94 ready to embrace envy itself as a force, a terrible force out of which something good might be born, and he could see, around close corners in the labyrinths of his mind, new lives for [MASK]; for the children with their averted eyes; for himself also.
<name>the old woman</name>	the old woman	Oyo	At seven-thirty she still had not come, and [MASK] asked her husband whether he had really remembered to tell her to come early. ‘I told her,’ he said, trying to bide a smile. The old woman arrived shortly before eight, trailing the children with her.
