<name>White Fang</name>	White Fang	Billee	He sprang back, bristling and snarling, fearful of the unseen and unknown. But a friendly little yelp reassured him, and he went back to investigate. A whiff of warm air ascended to his nostrils, and there, curled up under the snow in a snug ball, lay [MASK].
<name>The Man</name>	The Man	Thornton	So saying, he slammed a sack of gold dust of the size of a bologna sausage down upon the bar. Nobody spoke. [MASK]'s bluff, if bluff it was, had been called. He could feel a flush of warm blood creeping up his face.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Buck	“Well, [MASK], my boy,” he went on in a genial voice, “we've had our little ruction, and the best thing we can do is to let it go at that. You've learned your place, and I know mine.
<name>the person</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	the person (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Hal	It would have required an experienced man to keep the top-heavy sled upright, and [MASK] was not such a man. As they swung on the turn the sled went over, spilling half its load through the loose lashings. The dogs never stopped.
<name>Uncas</name>	Uncas	Hans	From the camp came the faint sound of many voices, rising and falling in a sing-song chant. Bellying forward to the edge of the clearing, he found [MASK], lying on his face, feathered with arrows like a porcupine.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Buck	“Now, you red-eyed devil,” he said, when he had made an opening sufficient for the passage of [MASK]'s body. At the same time he dropped the hatchet and shifted the club to his right hand.
<name>Locust</name>	Locust	Buck	[MASK] multiplied himself, attacking from all sides, enveloping the herd in a whirlwind of menace, cutting out his victim as fast as it could rejoin its mates, wearing out the patience of creatures preyed upon, which is a lesser patience than that of creatures preying.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Francois	It was a harness, such as he had seen the grooms put on the horses at home. And as he had seen horses work, so he was set to work, hauling [MASK] on a sled to the forest that fringed the valley, and returning with a load of firewood.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Spitz	“Gif it to heem, by Gar! Gif it to heem, the dirty t'eef!” [MASK] was equally willing. He was crying with sheer rage and eagerness as he circled back and forth for a chance to spring in.
<name>the wild brother</name>	the wild brother	Buck	For the better part of an hour the wild brother ran by his side, whining softly. Then he sat down, pointed his nose upward, and howled. It was a mournful howl, and as [MASK] held steadily on his way he heard it grow faint and fainter until it was lost in the distance.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Francois	Time was flying, and they should have been on the trail an hour gone. [MASK] scratched his head again. He shook it and grinned sheepishly at the courier, who shrugged his shoulders in sign that they were beaten.
<name>Turpin</name>	Turpin	Buck	His small eyes burned with a vicious and bitter light, while he roared with fury at sight of [MASK]. From the bull's side, just forward of the flank, protruded a feathered arrow-end, which accounted for his savageness.
<name>George</name>	George	Perrault	[MASK] was in a hurry, and he prided himself on his knowledge of ice, which knowledge was indispensable, for the fall ice was very thin, and where there was swift water, there was no ice at all.
<name>Scott</name>	Scott	Buck	This dog was thrashing about in a death-struggle, directly on the trail, and [MASK] passed around him without stopping. From the camp came the faint sound of many voices, rising and falling in a sing-song chant.
<name>him</name>	him	Buck	As it was with [MASK], so was it with his mates. They were perambulating skeletons. There were seven all together, including him. In their very great misery they had become insensible to the bite of the lash or the bruise of the club.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Buck	For two days and nights this express car was dragged along at the tail of shrieking locomotives; and for two days and nights [MASK] neither ate nor drank. In his anger he had met the first advances of the express messengers with growls, and they had retaliated by teasing him.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Buck	He sat down. The wolf started on toward the place from where the call surely came, then returned to him, sniffing noses and making actions as though to encourage him. But [MASK] turned about and started slowly on the back track.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Buck	And through it all [MASK] staggered along at the head of the team as in a nightmare. He pulled when he could; when he could no longer pull, he fell down and remained down till blows from whip or club drove him to his feet again.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Spitz	In fact, his conduct approached that of a bully, and he was given to swaggering up and down before [MASK]'s very nose. The breaking down of discipline likewise affected the dogs in their relations with one another.
<name>Yosemite</name>	Yosemite	Buck	The crowd fell silent; only could be heard the voices of the gamblers vainly offering two to one. Everybody acknowledged [MASK] a magnificent animal, but twenty fifty-pound sacks of flour bulked too large in their eyes for them to loosen their pouch-strings.
<name>the canoe</name>	the canoe	Thornton	He struck out boldly, but not straight enough into the stream. He discovered the mistake too late, when [MASK] was abreast of him and a bare half-dozen strokes away while he was being carried helplessly past.
<name>Phileas Fogg</name>	Phileas Fogg	Buck	A rest comes very good after one has travelled three thousand miles, and it must be confessed that [MASK] waxed lazy as his wounds healed, his muscles swelled out, and the flesh came back to cover his bones.
<name>partner</name>	partner	Perrault	Eh? How moch?” “Three hundred, and a present at that,” was the prompt reply of the man in the red sweater. “And seem' it's government money, you ain't got no kick coming, eh, [MASK]?”
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Curly	[MASK] rushed her antagonist, who struck again and leaped aside. He met her next rush with his chest, in a peculiar fashion that tumbled her off her feet. She never regained them, This was what the onlooking huskies had waited for.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Buck	At the same instant [MASK] peered out where the spruce-bough lodge had been and saw what made his hair leap straight up on his neck and shoulders. A gust of overpowering rage swept over him. He did not know that he growled, but he growled aloud with a terrible ferocity.
<name>Beelzebub</name>	Beelzebub	Buck	But the saloon-keeper let him alone, and in the morning four men entered and picked up the crate. More tormentors, [MASK] decided, for they were evil-looking creatures, ragged and unkempt; and he stormed and raged at them through the bars.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Perrault	[MASK] found one with head buried in the grub-box. His club landed heavily on the gaunt ribs, and the grub-box was capsized on the ground. On the instant a score of the famished brutes were scrambling for the bread and bacon.
<name>Sonia</name>	Sonia	Mercedes	[MASK] ceased weeping over the dogs, being too occupied with weeping over herself and with quarrelling with her husband and brother. To quarrel was the one thing they were never too weary to do. Their irritability arose out of their misery, increased with it, doubled upon it, outdistanced it.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Buck	Be a bad dog, and I'll whale the stuffin' outa you. Understand?” As he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly pounded, and though [MASK]'s hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the hand, he endured it without protest.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Buck	[MASK] to mastery, so that when he bristled and showed his teeth they got out of his way. Best of all, perhaps, he loved to lie near the fire, hind legs crouched under him, fore legs stretched out in front, head raised, and eyes blinking dreamily at the flames.
<name>John Thornton</name>	John Thornton	Buck	As they swung on the turn the sled went over, spilling half its load through the loose lashings. The dogs never stopped. The lightened sled bounded on its side behind them. They were angry because of the ill treatment they had received and the unjust load. [MASK] was raging.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Buck	He whined placatingly, squirmed and wriggled to show his good will and intentions, and even ventured, as a bribe for peace, to lick [MASK]'s face with his warm wet tongue. Another lesson. So that was the way they did it, eh?
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Buck	The man struck the shrewd blow he had purposely withheld for so long, and [MASK] crumpled up and went down, knocked utterly senseless. “He's no slouch at dog-breakin', that's wot I say,” one of the men on the wall cried enthusiastically.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Buck	He lay where he had fallen, and from there he watched the man in the red sweater. “'Answers to the name of [MASK],'” the man soliloquized, quoting from the saloon-keeper's letter which had announced the consignment of the crate and contents.
<name>Long John Silver</name>	Long John Silver	Hans	“Py jingo! I t'ink so mineself,” [MASK] affirmed. They saw him marching out of camp, but they did not see the instant and terrible transformation which took place as soon as he was within the secrecy of the forest. He no longer marched.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Buck	She never regained them, This was what the onlooking huskies had waited for. They closed in upon her, snarling and yelping, and she was buried, screaming with agony, beneath the bristling mass of bodies. So sudden was it, and so unexpected, that [MASK] was taken aback.
<name>humans</name>	humans	Francois	But he circled just beyond the range of the club, snarling with bitterness and rage; and while he circled he watched the club so as to dodge it if thrown by [MASK], for he was become wise in the way of clubs.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Buck	[MASK] was no less eager, and no less cautious, as he likewise circled back and forth for the advantage. But it was then that the unexpected happened, the thing which projected their struggle for supremacy far into the future, past many a weary mile of trail and toil.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Buck	Then the rope tightened mercilessly, while [MASK] struggled in a fury, his tongue lolling out of his mouth and his great chest panting futilely. Never in all his life had he been so vilely treated, and never in all his life had he been so angry.
<name>someone</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	someone (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	Buck	He made it clear to [MASK] that he was to come, and they ran side by side through the sombre twilight, straight up the creek bed, into the gorge from which it issued, and across the bleak divide where it took its rise.
<name>Perrault</name>	Perrault	Hal	“An' of course the dogs can hike along all day with that contraption behind them,” affirmed a second of the men. “Certainly,” said [MASK], with freezing politeness, taking hold of the gee-pole with one hand and swinging his whip from the other.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Charles	one of the men asked. “Why shouldn't it?” [MASK] demanded rather shortly. “Oh, that's all right, that's all right,” the man hastened meekly to say. “I was just a-wonderin', that is all.
<name>Spitz</name>	Spitz	Spitz	He had lessoned from [MASK], and from the chief fighting dogs of the police and mail, and knew there was no middle course. He must master or be mastered; while to show mercy was a weakness. Mercy did not exist in the primordial life.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Buck	Twice his teeth clipped together, like the steel jaws of a trap, as he backed away for better footing, with lean and lifting lips that writhed and snarled. In a flash [MASK] knew it. The time had come. It was to the death.
<name>John</name>	John	Buck	Day after day, for days unending, [MASK] toiled in the traces. Always, they broke camp in the dark, and the first gray of dawn found them hitting the trail with fresh miles reeled off behind them.
<name>Spitz</name>	Spitz	Manuel	Ere he landed on his feet, he saw the white camp spread out before him and knew where he was and remembered all that had passed from the time he went for a stroll with [MASK] to the hole he had dug for himself the night before.
<name>Louise</name>	Louise	Mercedes	[MASK] nursed a special grievance--the grievance of sex. She was pretty and soft, and had been chivalrously treated all her days. But the present treatment by her husband and brother was everything save chivalrous. It was her custom to be helpless. They complained.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Buck	He even went out of his way to bully [MASK], striving constantly to start the fight which could end only in the death of one or the other. Early in the trip this might have taken place had it not been for an unwonted accident.
<name>James</name>	James	Buck	But the man, shifting the club from right to left, coolly caught him by the under jaw, at the same time wrenching downward and backward. [MASK] described a complete circle in the air, and half of another, then crashed to the ground on his head and chest.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Buck	Three days passed, by which time [MASK] and his mates found how really tired and weak they were. Then, on the morning of the fourth day, two men from the States came along and bought them, harness and all, for a song.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Buck	And always they pitched camp after dark, eating their bit of fish, and crawling to sleep into the snow. [MASK] was ravenous. The pound and a half of sun-dried salmon, which was his ration for each day, seemed to go nowhere.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Morning	[MASK] found him too weak to travel. At harness-up time he tried to crawl to his driver. By convulsive efforts he got on his feet, staggered, and fell. Then he wormed his way forward slowly toward where the harnesses were being put on his mates.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Buck	They scattered far and wide over the country, and it was not till a week later that the last of the survivors gathered together in a lower valley and counted their losses. As for [MASK], wearying of the pursuit, he returned to the desolated camp.
<name>they</name>	they	Buck	Watching his chance, he darted away, and the chase was resumed. Time and again he was cornered, and the thing repeated, though he was in poor condition, or [MASK] could not so easily have overtaken him.
<name>Little Red Riding Hood</name>	Little Red Riding Hood	Buck	But in the end [MASK]'s pertinacity was rewarded; for the wolf, finding that no harm was intended, finally sniffed noses with him. Then they became friendly, and played about in the nervous, half-coy way with which fierce beasts belie their fierceness.
<name>The overseer</name>	The overseer	Buck	“You poor, poor dears,” she cried sympathetically, “why don't you pull hard?--then you wouldn't be whipped.” [MASK] did not like her, but he was feeling too miserable to resist her, taking it as part of the day's miserable work.
<name>Spitz</name>	Spitz	Lissen	Buck I know for sure. [MASK]: some dam fine day heem get mad lak hell an' den heem chew dat Spitz all up an' spit heem out on de snow. Sure. I know.” From then on it was war between them.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Billee	Their business was to toil, and toil mightily, in the traces. So long as that were not interfered with, they did not care what happened. [MASK], the good-natured, could lead for all they cared, so long as he kept order.
<name>Mercedes</name>	Mercedes	Thornton	He would lie by the hour, eager, alert, at [MASK]'s feet, looking up into his face, dwelling upon it, studying it, following with keenest interest each fleeting expression, every movement or change of feature.
<name>Matador</name>	Matador	Buck	Unable to turn his back on the fanged danger and go on, the bull would be driven into paroxysms of rage. At such moments he charged [MASK], who retreated craftily, luring him on by a simulated inability to escape.
<name>George</name>	George	Thornton	The boat flirted over and snubbed in to the bank bottom up, while [MASK], flung sheer out of it, was carried down-stream toward the worst part of the rapids, a stretch of wild water in which no swimmer could live.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Buck	he cried, when his eyes lit upon [MASK]. “Dat one dam bully dog! Eh? How moch?” “Three hundred, and a present at that,” was the prompt reply of the man in the red sweater.
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Dub	Not only did they not know how to work dogs, but they did not know how to work themselves. The first to go was [MASK]. Poor blundering thief that he was, always getting caught and punished, he had none the less been a faithful worker.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Buck	At such moments, panting with red lolling tongue and with eyes fixed upon the big bull, it appeared to [MASK] that a change was coming over the face of things. He could feel a new stir in the land.
<name>Dawson</name>	Dawson	Dawson	Two hours of cursing and exertion got the harnesses into shape, and the wound-stiffened team was under way, struggling painfully over the hardest part of the trail they had yet encountered, and for that matter, the hardest between them and [MASK].
<name>Billie</name>	Billie	Buck	[MASK] duplicated the manoeuvre, this time to the left. The crackling turned into a snapping, the sled pivoting and the runners slipping and grating several inches to the side. The sled was broken out. Men were holding their breaths, intensely unconscious of the fact.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Buck	She dropped on her knees before [MASK], with tears in her eyes, and put her arms around his neck. “You poor, poor dears,” she cried sympathetically, “why don't you pull hard?--then you wouldn't be whipped.”
<name>Mush</name>	Mush	MUSH	The crackling turned into a snapping, the sled pivoting and the runners slipping and grating several inches to the side. The sled was broken out. Men were holding their breaths, intensely unconscious of the fact. “Now, [MASK]!”
<name>John</name>	John	Buck	It was an old song, old as the breed itself--one of the first songs of the younger world in a day when songs were sad. It was invested with the woe of unnumbered generations, this plaint by which [MASK] was so strangely stirred.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Buck	When he watched the hairy man sleeping by the fire, head between his knees and hands clasped above, [MASK] saw that he slept restlessly, with many starts and awakenings, at which times he would peer fearfully into the darkness and fling more wood upon the fire.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Buck	Then came the search for a place to descend, which descent was ultimately made by the aid of the rope, and night found them back on the river with a quarter of a mile to the day's credit. By the time they made the Hootalinqua and good ice, [MASK] was played out.
<name>Thor</name>	Thor	Buck	He was in a savage temper, and, standing over six feet from the ground, was as formidable an antagonist as even [MASK] could desire. Back and forth the bull tossed his great palmated antlers, branching to fourteen points and embracing seven feet within the tips.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Spitz	He rushed, as though attempting the old shoulder trick, but at the last instant swept low to the snow and in. His teeth closed on [MASK]'s left fore leg. There was a crunch of breaking bone, and the white dog faced him on three legs.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Mercedes	He doubled it. And to cap it all, when [MASK], with tears in her pretty eyes and a quaver in her throat, could not cajole him into giving the dogs still more, she stole from the fish-sacks and fed them slyly.
<name>Akela</name>	Akela	Buck	Then an old wolf, gaunt and battle-scarred, came forward. [MASK] writhed his lips into the preliminary of a snarl, but sniffed noses with him, Whereupon the old wolf sat down, pointed nose at the moon, and broke out the long wolf howl.
<name>Mac</name>	Mac	John	“Though it's little faith I'm having, [MASK], that the beast can do the trick.” The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test. The tables were deserted, and the dealers and gamekeepers came forth to see the outcome of the wager and to lay odds.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Spitz	Once off his feet and under that mass of huskies, there was no hope for him. But he braced himself to the shock of [MASK]'s charge, then joined the flight out on the lake. Later, the nine team-dogs gathered together and sought shelter in the forest.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Buck	At such times [MASK] did not attempt to stay him, but loped easily at his heels, satisfied with the way the game was played, lying down when the moose stood still, attacking him fiercely when he strove to eat or drink.
<name>the man</name>	the man	Thornton	The suck of the water as it took the beginning of the last steep pitch was frightful, and [MASK] knew that the shore was impossible. He scraped furiously over a rock, bruised across a second, and struck a third with crushing force.
<name>don't know</name>	don't know	Buck	He took his head in his two hands and rested cheek on cheek. He did not playfully shake him, as was his wont, or murmur soft love curses; but he whispered in his ear. “As you love me, [MASK].
<name>the man</name>	the man	Buck	The leaders lifted the yelp of the pack and sprang away into the woods. The wolves swung in behind, yelping in chorus. And [MASK] ran with them, side by side with the wild brother, yelping as he ran. * * * * *
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Buck	From the bull's side, just forward of the flank, protruded a feathered arrow-end, which accounted for his savageness. Guided by that instinct which came from the old hunting days of the primordial world, [MASK] proceeded to cut the bull out from the herd.
<name>Billie</name>	Billie	Buck	But the hunger-madness made them terrifying, irresistible. There was no opposing them. The team-dogs were swept back against the cliff at the first onset. [MASK] was beset by three huskies, and in a trice his head and shoulders were ripped and slashed.
<name>Death</name>	Death	Buck	He saw the silent circle, with gleaming eyes, lolling tongues, and silvery breaths drifting upward, closing in upon him as he had seen similar circles close in upon beaten antagonists in the past. Only this time he was the one who was beaten. There was no hope for him. [MASK] was inexorable.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Buck	The vision of the short-legged hairy man came to him more frequently, now that there was little work to be done; and often, blinking by the fire, [MASK] wandered with him in that other world which he remembered. The salient thing of this other world seemed fear.
<name>White Fang</name>	White Fang	Buck	And with the coming of the night, brooding and mourning by the pool, [MASK] became alive to a stirring of the new life in the forest other than that which the Yeehats had made, He stood up, listening and scenting.
<name>Jack London</name>	Jack London	Perrault	He broke from a mournful contemplation of it to look over his wounded dogs. “Ah, my frien's,” he said softly, “mebbe it mek you mad dog, dose many bites. Mebbe all mad dog, sacredam! Wot you t'ink, eh, [MASK]?”
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Hal	[MASK] was a youngster of nineteen or twenty, with a big Colt's revolver and a hunting-knife strapped about him on a belt that fairly bristled with cartridges. This belt was the most salient thing about him. It advertised his callowness--a callowness sheer and unutterable.
<name>Yukon</name>	Yukon	Thornton	Mush on!” [MASK] went on whittling. It was idle, he knew, to get between a fool and his folly; while two or three fools more or less would not alter the scheme of things. But the team did not get up at the command.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Buck	They, too, were silent, their eyes only gleaming and their breaths drifting slowly upward. To [MASK] it was nothing new or strange, this scene of old time. It was as though it had always been, the wonted way of things.
<name>He</name>	He	Thornton	[MASK] did not reply. He did not know what to say. He glanced from face to face in the absent way of a man who has lost the power of thought and is seeking somewhere to find the thing that will start it going again.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Buck	And over this great demesne [MASK] ruled. Here he was born, and here he had lived the four years of his life. It was true, there were other dogs, There could not but be other dogs on so vast a place, but they did not count.
<name>Frona</name>	Frona	Curly	Two minutes from the time [MASK] went down, the last of her assailants were clubbed off. But she lay there limp and lifeless in the bloody, trampled snow, almost literally torn to pieces, the swart half-breed standing over her and cursing horribly.
<name>Skeet</name>	Skeet	Buck	[MASK] led the pack, sixty strong, around bend after bend, but he could not gain. He lay down low to the race, whining eagerly, his splendid body flashing forward, leap by leap, in the wan white moonlight.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Mercedes	“Undreamed of!” cried [MASK], throwing up her hands in dainty dismay. “However in the world could I manage without a tent?” “It's springtime, and you won't get any more cold weather,” the man replied.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Buck	And at such times that money passed between them the strangers took one or more of the dogs away with them. [MASK] wondered where they went, for they never came back; but the fear of the future was strong upon him, and he was glad each time when he was not selected.
<name>Jack London</name>	Jack London	Perrault	And [MASK] nodded. He was ahead of the record then, and gaining day by day. The trail was in excellent condition, well packed and hard, and there was no new-fallen snow with which to contend. It was not too cold.
<name>Ethan</name>	Ethan	Buck	[MASK] felt vaguely that there was no depending upon these two men and the woman. They did not know how to do anything, and as the days went by it became apparent that they could not learn. They were slack in all things, without order or discipline.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Thornton	[MASK] had been hurried into the wager, heavy with doubt; and now that he looked at the sled itself, the concrete fact, with the regular team of ten dogs curled up in the snow before it, the more impossible the task appeared.
<name>He</name>	He	Buck	He could feel a flush of warm blood creeping up his face. His tongue had tricked him. He did not know whether [MASK] could start a thousand pounds. Half a ton! The enormousness of it appalled him.
