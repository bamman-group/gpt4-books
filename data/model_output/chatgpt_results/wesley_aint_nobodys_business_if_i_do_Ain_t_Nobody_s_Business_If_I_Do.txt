<name>her</name>	her	Raye	But he wasn't ready to tell him the truth as he saw it; yet things had gone too far for him to do anything else. "I care about [MASK] as much as I do you. You were destroying her, man, killing her spirit.
<name>the family</name>	the family	Steven's	Well, I certainly hope you two will work things out. You are such a lovely couple. Such a nice family. And it was certainly nice of that young man—I guess he is a friend of [MASK]—to help out around the house.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Eva	"No. I don't think so." "Go ahead." Self-consciously, [MASK] brought the mouthpiece to her lips again, and cautiously blew through it. "Did you blow?" "Nothing happened." "Try it again."
<name>Joey</name>	Joey	Hutch	Summers go fast, but that Hawk flying around the comer in the middle of winter will knock you flat on your natural, grownup behind if you're not careful." "I know that, too," [MASK] said.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Steven	But he didn't know what the hell he was going to say. He picked up the remote, snapped on the TV and watched CNN for a while, then switched to Headline News and called [MASK] again, vaguely wondering where he could be on a rainy Saturday afternoon.
<name>him</name>	him	Hutch	When she had heard [MASK] come in, she rushed downstairs to confront him and followed him back upstairs, ranting and raving, demanding some answers. “Can we just live with it for a while to see what happens, to see what we should do?
<name>Cheshire</name>	Cheshire	Bama	They had named her [MASK] for the obvious reason. It was hard to see any trace of that scraggly kitten in the overfed cat who now stretched beside her, snagging her claws into the woven white bedspread. There is no joy between us. Where had their joy gone?
<name>Annabelle</name>	Annabelle	Raye	[MASK] smiled the way she always did, as if she «:.*• ..b.jr'. b..;.... a: Am were on the verge of teasing him but with an understanding that belonged just to her. "Yesterday, as a matter of fact.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Eva	[MASK], on the alert for any hint of sarcasm, decided to take the woman at her word and tell her the truth. "Frankly, I'm hoping she'll forget about all this foolishness and go to law school," she said. "
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Precious	"What happened?" She heard [MASK] sigh heavily on the other end of the line. "Last night. About four in the morning he—" "Four in the morning? What was he doing up at four in the morning?"
<name>Miss Maudie</name>	Miss Maudie	Money	"I always liked books too. Good way to make a living. They were hiring colored librarians back then. [MASK] was okay. Respectable job, kind of like being a teacher. You could learn stuff, too. That's where I learned to invest.
<name>he</name>	he	Donald	I'll buy some ridiculous expensive nothing that I don't and never will need, and when I come back, [MASK] will be attentive, pamper me, tell me how much he loves me, and I zvon't catch him in a lie, so I let down my guard, allow myself to trust him.
<name>The speaker</name>	The speaker	Hutch	She waited so long before she said anything that he was surprised by her answer when it came. "No. I never have." "Why?" [MASK] was genuinely curious. "I don't know why.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Hutch	Did he go to his office? That was one place he always ran when he needed somewhere to go. But there was barely enough room for a couch in the reception area, and [MASK] had taken his suitcase, so that was out. Maybe a hotel?
<name>She</name>	She	Eva	[MASK] knew that his eyes were watering. She also knew him well enough to know that he was trying to hide it. Suddenly she wanted to to pull him close to her, to feel the solid strength of his body against her.
<name>John</name>	John	Charley	The look on [MASK]'s face made her wish she'd lied. "That's right! Smack me down like you always do. Trample on my ideas! Rain on my parade! I knew you weren't going to support me. I knew it!
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Precious	Why did this woman have her elderly father up at that time of night? "He wasn't up at four in the morning. We were in bed." [MASK]'s voice was firm but patient, as if she were speaking to an upset but spoiled child.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Hutch	"I don't know." "You started this mess, getting me out of bed at this time of night with this foolishness, and you're saying you don't know why you're going? [MASK], what in the hell is wrong with you?"
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Hutch	"I am speaking to him," she said as she took the gifts out of the bag and put those on the floor beside her. "He's not speaking to me!" [MASK] said. They looked at each other and started to laugh.
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Eva	Those whites who stayed were good neighbors, and some had become friends, hesitant and uneasy at first but closer as the years passed. [MASK] had been happier in this house than she had ever been anywhere in her life.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Hutch	There was never any joy between us. Now that I know what real joy is!" "And you think joy is what you have with that asshole of a musician?" His voice came out in a squeak, but [MASK] didn't care.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Charley	"I have given you everything I can of my life, and now I want something back for myself," she said. The anger in [MASK]'s eyes was replaced with astonishment. "I'm going to tell you this once and for all.
<name>you</name>	you	Eva	He let the coat drop to the floor. "All this time, [MASK], you knew? Why ... ?" "You are the one who betrayed me, who lied to me," she interrupted him, her voice triumphant.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Eva	She couldn't form any thoughts. The only thing she felt was fear, and that was overwhelming. "[MASK]? Are you there?" "Is he still alive?" From somewhere she found her voice. "Yes. He's alive.
<name>she</name>	she	Eva	Everything is fine, just him complaining like he always does, next thing you know, poof! Twenty years down the goddamn drain! You didn't have a clue, did you?" "No," [MASK] had said, which was a lie.
<name>Isadora</name>	Isadora	Eva	The case was made of well-worn brown leather and lined in plush maroon velvet. The horn gleamed as if it were made of gold. Hesitating for a moment, [MASK] touched it with her fingertips, as if it posed some threat or would snap at her hand.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Eva	But the chin that she'd seen him thrust out with arrogance when he played eclipsed any girlishness that might creep into his face. And then there were those lips. [MASK] was glad nobody at the table could read her thoughts, even though she suspected everybody assumed the worst about their relationship.
<name>Harry's</name>	Harry's	Raye	He closed his eyes for a moment and then opened them. He made himself breathe in and then out. Taking it slow. Relaxing. Forcing himself to take in his surroundings. This room, which he'd never been in before, was unmistakably [MASK]'s.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Hutch	It was strange how that hand hadn't changed. It was bigger, stronger, definitely a man's hand, but it was the same. [MASK] thought about how he'd held his father's hand the night before he died as he listened to him babble.
<name>someone</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	someone (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	Donald	I opened the package intending to dry it off and put it on his desk, but there it was, [MASK]'s last will and testament, spelling everything out, in that stupid legalese. I thought I was going to be sick. I was sick for a while.
<name>Karen</name>	Karen	Eva	"You used to go out with one of her friends, she said. Was she white?" [MASK], realizing the question made her sound like a bigot, regretted it the moment it left her mouth. "Not that it matters," she stammered out.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Raye	"She is one of the finest-looking fifty-year-old women I've ever seen." "Fifty! You've got my birthday mixed up with your own," [MASK] added with a smirk passed off as a smile.
<name>she</name>	she	Eva	Now if she had walked out on you—then things would be different. Then you'd hold all the cards. Then she'd be coming back to you." "I'll give it a few days, see if maybe [MASK] and me can talk, see if . . .
<name>honey</name>	honey	Charley	And they've told you that you have what it takes to become a stand-up comedian?" "Yes." "[MASK], they're lying to you. They don't want to hurt your feelings. Listen to me. I'm your mother.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Hutch	Her voice was shy, like a little girl begging for a favor, but there was a teasing light in her sparkling eyes. "Yeah, sure. Let me put on some clothes first," [MASK] said, suddenly conscious that he was in his underwear and robe.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Eva	"Just tell me what you think." "You really don't want to know what I think," [MASK] said solemnly. "Say it. Better now than later." "She's not your type.
<name>She</name>	She	Charley	She was embarrased. For some strange reason she felt humiliated. [MASK] studied her mother's face for a while and then answered like a hurt, pouting little girl, "I don't want to tell you how I feel." "Just say it.
<name>he</name>	he	Roscoe	She couldn't remember the last time she and her father had argued. It had been years, she realized. She suddenly felt like crying. "Well, you've said your piece," [MASK] paid. "Thanks for nothing."
<name>she</name>	she	Charley	She had learned that life was better and happier when everything was planned out safely. She had learned to leave nothing to chance because both of their lives depended upon it, "I just want to live my life to its fullest," [MASK] said, a dreamy look in her eyes.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Charley	"We didn't go out, I told you that." "But you went to a club with him, right?" "[MASK], you're not still interested in the man, are you?" "Come on. Mother, get real!"
<name>his mother</name>	his mother	Eva	The important thing was that he would get to see her again. Talk to her. He was sure she would let him in—even [MASK], as angry as she was, couldn't possibly turn him down laden with gifts.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Eva	After gagging down a bowl of the woman's lousy potato salad and some salty barbecued spareribs her father had bought at a nearby Pathmark, [MASK] made her excuses and left as soon as she could, so upset she'd forgotten to borrow some money.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Helena	" ain't ackealjr'a baaiaasa SI i J* [MASK] patted her hand reassuringly. "Listen, these things take time. I'm just happy you-all have worked things out. But if you need a good marriage shrink, I have one.
<name>He</name>	He	Eva	Would you like me to take you somewhere, maybe to a phone booth or garage or something?" [MASK] nodded that he could and without saying anything else checked the car locks on her car and turned on the alarm system (not that it mattered).
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Hutch	[MASK] could fix it when he came home. After dinner or breakfast. After they had talked. She went back to the kitchen and poured herself a bowl of cornflakes and another cup of coffee and settled by the window, sipping, munching and watching the rain.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Raye	"You don't have to worry about betraying [MASK]'s trust anymore. It's over now. She's not coming back. She's out to destroy me, and there's nothing I can do about it."
<name>E</name>	E	Irene	She had always been fascinated by [MASK], a late-blooming civil-rights lawyer. "She got that funny grin on her face that she always gets when I mention him. Then she shook her head and sighed and asked if I knew how E was taking it."
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Roscoe	"I don't feel like going into it." The last thing she needed was [MASK]'s opinion about her parenting skills. "Feel like some coffee? The waiter says they serve coffee until the bar closes, so we have about forty minutes.
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Raye	Sixteen summers? Maybe thirty if I'm lucky?" "You've only got tomorrow if you're lucky," [MASK] said with a slight smile. "How many years does anybody have?" "I don't want to settle anymore." "
<name>Janice</name>	Janice	Precious	She has some church stuff to do early tomorrow morning." "She doesn't strike me as the churchgoing type." "[MASK] is a very spiritual woman. One of the most spiritual I've ever known. Come on, let's talk.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Hutch	Yes, he is younger than me. But that makes it very interesting. [MASK]. You should know that better than anybody else, don't you agree?" "I have no idea what you're talking about!"
<name>Cersei</name>	Cersei	Donald	A wise woman like me." He hesitated before he answered, knowing he was about to step into a minefield and wondering how much if any of this he should be discussing with her, how much was [MASK]'s business and had nothing to do with her.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Hutch	" It came out sounding more harsh than he'd meant it to, and he wished for a minute that he hadn't said it, but then was glad that he had. It was the most honest thing he could say in a dangerously dishonest conversation. "Right, [MASK].
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Hutch	We settle for little things all the time. [MASK]. We settle for chicken if they're out of steak. We settle for a blue car when we really want red. We settle and compromise and try to be happy with what we've got.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Hutch	"[MASK], you really shouldn't have." "Maybe not, but he's always been like a father to me. I—" -;- i ..k.jy*. i.;i i a, "I mean you shouldn't have gotten him booze!
<name>her</name>	her	Irene	Leaving them like this in the middle of the night with no warning, out of the blue like this?" "You know that's not what happened. I didn't leave that woman out of the blue. Don't bring [MASK] into it.
<name>She</name>	She	Eva	But [MASK] found his lackadaisical attitude disturbing too. How much do I really mean to this man? she wondered. Each time they made love she became more conscious of the dangers and pitfalls of a middle-aged woman involved with a man nearly the age of her daughter.
<name>he</name>	he	Louisa	I have given you everything I can of my life, and now I want something back for myself. The words had a primeval ring to them, as if spoken by someone else. But there had been truth there, too. Had [MASK] ever said those words to her?
<name>Yara</name>	Yara	Steven	That was the only way he would survive. He picked up the gift that [MASK] had given him and held it to his heart for a moment, almost as if it were his son. There was a note attached to it and he opened and read it quickly.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Steven	He also noticed [MASK] was avoiding his eyes, but then, as if getting courage from somewhere, he looked straight into them, smiling uncomfortably. He drew in a breath. "I knew this wouldn't be easy." "Take your time, son."
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Well"—Eva	"[MASK] cleared her throat—"I can still probably get that cab if—" "Hey, we're all going to grab something to eat. But if you want, I can still drive you home now. Your choice." "You don't mind if I go?"
<name>she</name>	she	Charley	The full weight of her words settled down on her. Her own mother had once said similar words to her, and she too had left her house, slamming the door behind her, not seeing her mother again until [MASK] was four.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Raye	"I'm not that much of a fool. Sooner or later. I'll get mine too." They didn't sound like [MASK]'s words, but he knew that this was what she probably told herself when the pain got too deep to handle.
<name>He</name>	He	Hutch	Ask him to have some patience with you while you work through your stupid bigotry. Tell him how much you love him." [MASK] knew she was right, and after he hung up, he tortured himself with should-haves.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Hutch	You can get out of paying the big money if she leaves you. But on the other hand, your kids are grown, so that puts a different light—" "Shut up, man." [MASK] said. His eyes showed he meant it.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Eva	How many times in her life since her mother's death had that question haunted her? [MASK] brought the sweater to her nose to smell the scent once more before she packed it away. What her mother would say about the choices she made filled her dreams sometimes and occasionally her nightmares.
<name>her</name>	her	Eva	He heard the familiar chime, and leaned toward the door to see if he could hear anyone inside. He heard [MASK]'s footsteps coming into the foyer from the living room. She paused at the door as she checked the peephole, and his heart jumped when he heard her turn the lock.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Steven	"[MASK] thinks you're dishonest. Admit to him that you have mixed feelings about the fact that he is gay. Ask him to have some patience with you while you work through your stupid bigotry. Tell him how much you love him."
<name>Blair</name>	Blair	Eva	"Hey, come upstairs." He nodded toward his room, ignoring her question. "No. Not tonight," [MASK] said, raising her voice slightly, like a weary mother telling a toddler she didn't want to play his favorite game.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Donald	"Let's act civilized about this," he said more gently. He noticed that [MASK]'s eyes were watering too, and he tried to think of a way that they both could save face. "I wish this hadn't happened," he said at last.
<name>Stanley</name>	Stanley	Criticism	"I guess he loved me, but God knows, he was never able to say it. [MASK], yeah. He knew how to dish it out. And how to make me take responsibility. Or how to work until you dropped dead."
<name>Darry</name>	Darry	Steven	But maybe it was for the best. Maybe. "You've got to know why you left before you can go back." [MASK] broke the silence, and his voice was forgiving, momentarily kind, like that of a parent giving a child much-needed advice.
<name>her</name>	her	Eva	He always chuckled appreciatively when she gave her advice, and the give and take between the two of them had always delighted [MASK]. The memory of it tonight made her feel sad. He dropped his eyes for a moment, and then shyly glanced back up at her.
<name>Bob Marley</name>	Bob Marley	Charley	" They passed the joint between them for a moment, bobbing their heads to the Peter Tosh CD blasting from [MASK]'s oversize speakers. "So what you doing for the Fourth?" "Friday? Nothing much.
<name>her ex-partner</name>	her ex-partner	Donald	He felt that he had to defend her against her own self-doubt and find ways to reassure her about how appealing and desirable she was. Each time he touched her and saw the sadness that lay so deep in her eyes, he was reminded how much [MASK] had hurt her.
<name>Mrs. Baker</name>	Mrs. Baker	Eva	"I've decided to become a comedian. A stand-up comic." "A what?" It took [MASK] a minute and a half to find her voice. "A stand-up comedian." "A stand-up comedian?"
<name>He</name>	He	Hutch	[MASK] found that he missed her less and less. He thought of her only when he crawled into bed between her luxurious sheets or showered in the morning with the lemon soap. He smiled whenever she crossed his mind, but she was no longer essential.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no clear indication or context in the passage to suggest a specific name.)	unknown (There is no clear indication or context in the passage to suggest a specific name.)	Irene	"Thank you, [MASK]," he said. "I haven't given it to you yet!" she teased as she handed him a cup. 'It was my pleasure," she said. Her eyes and nod of acknowledgment told him that she understood and accepted his thanks.
<name>He</name>	He	Hutch	Transfixed, he had watched the man climb into his car and drive away. For a moment. [MASK] considered pursuing him, catching him, exusing him out, beating him up. He could almost feel the man's flesh go flat and bloody against his fist as he pummeled him to the ground.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Eva	[MASK] closed her eyes. Her head was throbbing, and the cheap wine on her empty stomach was making her nauseous. She was sure she was going to be sick. She picked up her head and quickly glanced around the room, looking for the restroom.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Cara	And there was [MASK]. He'd been so sloppy with his stuff, so careless and indiscreet with his whispered phone conversations, stray credit card receipts, secret meetings. It was almost as if he were daring her to find out.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Eva	"This isn't coming out like I expected it to. I don't know what I expect you to say. Why I even came in here, except. . . ." She shook her head in frustration. [MASK] jumped in quickly.
<name>her</name>	her	Isaiah	More than once she wondered if she should save time by simply sleeping in [MASK]'s bed, nude and ready to go in the morning when they woke up. But she realized she needed the separation and space her own bed provided.
<name>John</name>	John	Dana	He picked up the coffee cup again. He noticed that his hand was shaking. [MASK] noticed it too. His eyes widened slightly, but then he smiled. "I'm not the one you should be telling," he said.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Raye	I got that place in the city, you know the one over on West Seventy-second. You can stay there if you make yourself scarce when I need it and keep your mouth shut about it. [MASK] thinks I got rid of it six years ago.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Steven	Grinning, [MASK] waved a cracker in front of her nose and when she snapped at it handed it to her and got another one out for himself. "What do you think he's going to say?" "Who?"
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Eva	[MASK] rolled her eyes when she thought about that one. " 'Let yourself be happy.' 'There is no joy between us.' Maybe I should just roll over and fucking die of feeling sorry for myself," she said to the cat.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Hutch	"Well, he said he wanted to get away. He was anxious to surprise you. I assume—" "Don't you start too. [MASK], lying like he does. You're too good for that.
<name>someone</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	someone (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	Eva	God knew it wasn't the first time he'd hugged her to make her feel better. In an odd way, he knew her body almost as well as he knew [MASK]'s. But this time it was different, and they both knew it.
<name>she</name>	she	Raye	She has never felt anything but contempt for you because of the way you treat women. And if you start lying about her, [MASK] won't be the only woman who'll be hauling your ass into court."
<name>he</name>	he	Isaiah	When [MASK] tried to pull her into his bedroom in the morning, she claimed she had a mandatory meeting or dry cleaning to pick up, promising they would "talk" on the weekend. He'd simply shrug, smile and amble back into his room.
<name>Blues</name>	Blues	Eva	I play music, [MASK]. It is the only thing in my life I've ever been able to depend upon, so it is the only thing that counts. The only thing. Not women, not love, not money." He grinned.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Donald	I want the answer." "I told you that you got the only answer you are going to get. Now get out of my way!" "Well, tell me this, then. Why?" [MASK]'s voice was an anguished whisper.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Steven	Should he take the gifts back to the car? he wondered. He could donate money too. And time as well. He'd make time to do it. But it was too late. The elevator opened, and they walked toward [MASK]'s door.
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Eva	"Thanks," [MASK] muttered back, completely confused. "The separation obviously did you two some good. You look like a woman in love! You positively glow in the morning . . . and those late lunches!"
<name>he</name>	he	Isaiah	Neither of them said anything for a while after that. They just passed the Sprite can back and forth until it was empty. Then [MASK] glanced at his watch and said it was time to go to work, and he'd catch her later on that night.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Hutch	" She shook her head slowly now, as if trying to shake some bad thought out of it. "I sold my soul. [MASK]. I sold my soul to live the way I did so I would never be poor again.
<name>Orpheus</name>	Orpheus	Isaiah	Opening his eyes, [MASK] ran the tip of his tongue within and around the spot on her neck and down between her breasts and around her nipples and then the length of her spine, and they made love again. "I wrote a song for you," he said when they had finished.
<name>Max</name>	Max	Isaiah	She liked to feel her muscles flex and relax, to sense her own power. Breathe in, breathe out—[MASK] had said something like that the first time they were together, and she smiled now when she thought about it. She wondered where he was tonight.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Hutch	"No," [MASK] said, realizing again that the truth was all he had to give. "I have never been close to any gay men. I know I have a lot of prejudices and stupid assumptions about a lot of different things. About women.
