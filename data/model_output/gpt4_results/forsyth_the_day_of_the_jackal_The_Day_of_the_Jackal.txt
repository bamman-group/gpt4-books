<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Bouvier	[MASK] took up the cudgels on his behalf. “My colleague is searching, virtually without clues and without any sort of lead, for one of the most elusive types of men in the world. Such specimens do not advertise their professions or their whereabouts.”
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Lebel	The room brightened. “He will probably wrap a scarf round his dog-collar, or take it off, and register as “Mister Whatever-his-name-is,” said [MASK]. Several people glowered at him.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Caron	It’s him all right.” He hung up. “A parson this time,” he said bitterly to [MASK], “a Danish parson. Name unknown, the CRS man couldn’t remember the name on the passport. The human element, always the human element.
<name>Leamas</name>	Leamas	Kowalski	There were several references to a foreigner over whom [MASK] seemed to have mixed feelings. Sometimes he used the word abon,” meaning good, to refer to this man; at other times he called him a “fdcheux ” an annoying or irritating type.
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Duggan	For this day, the note described the only customer expected to call, a tall Englishman of well-to-do appearance who called himself [MASK]. It was just a form of insurance. The Englishman watched him calmly. “I thought so,” he said.
<name>Jean</name>	Jean	Benoit	The peasant nodded again to the woman who took two full bottles over to the group round the big table. “[MASK], go and get the van,” ordered the peasant, and one of the men, gulping down his wine in one swallow, went outside.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Claude	Without exception the reply was the same. Yes, of course. We’ll go through all the files for you. I’ll try and get back to you before the day is out. Oh, and, [MASK], good luck.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Rodin	“Has he really done those jobs?” “I was surprised myself,” said [MASK]. “So I spent extra time on this one. As regards absolute proof, there is none. If there were, it would be a bad sign.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Lebel	You have to assume you are working full speed until he has been caught, or at least identified and located. From then on I think the Action Service boys can take care of things.” “Bunch of thugs,” murmured [MASK].
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Thomas	Shortly after nine o’clock, as they reported to their offices and learned of their redeployment to [MASK]’s force, the men started to trickle in. When the last had arrived, he briefed them. “All right, we’re looking for a man.
<name>Rebus</name>	Rebus	Super	Out of the jumble the detective inspector grabbed a small blue book, walked to the window, and started to flick through it by the light of the rising sun. “[MASK], have a look at this.” His finger jabbed at one of tiie pages in the passport in front of him.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Thomas	It’s tying up a lot of the provincial police, and the Yard’s just been on to say that they’re complaining.” [MASK] thought for a moment. “Call it off,” he said. “I’m pretty certain he’s gone.”
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Grzybowski	It had a bell-push with a little white card in a slot beside it, with the word “[MASK]” typed on it. The door stood at the end of the corridor, flanked by the doors of apartments 22 and 24. He pressed the bell.
<name>Artemis</name>	Artemis	Frey	“If we are not allowed to act, what can we do?” “I did not say we were not allowed to act,” corrected [MASK]. “I said we were not allowed to act publicly. The whole thing must be done secretly.
<name>Vivian</name>	Vivian	Colette	There had been a soft click on the line soon after he had picked up the receiver. That had not happened during the phone calls over the past three days. There was an extension phone in the bedroom, but surely [MASK] had been fast asleep when he left her.
<name>Galbraith</name>	Galbraith	Casson	“What is to prevent you from taking the first quarter of a million and disappearing?” asked [MASK]. “I told you, messieurs, I wanted to retire. I do not wish to have half an army of ex-paras gunning for me.
<name>Alleyn</name>	Alleyn	Thomas	But does it not occur to you that we’re holding his passport in our hands?” “Oh, the sod . . .” breathed the inspector when he saw the point. “As you say,” said [MASK], whose chapel upbringing caused him only very occasionally to use strong language.
<name>Colonel</name>	Colonel	Rolland	[MASK] then did the same by introducing into the first sentence of his conversation the correct prearranged word. A listener would have learned that he had received information that his car, which had been under repair, was mended, and could be collected at the Colonel’s convenience.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Lebel	Then they’re going to visit every one.” There was a pause; then the man’s voice said, “Merci.” He hung up, and the woman did the same. [MASK] stared at the slowly turning tape spool. “You know the number she rang?”
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Goossens	Each one fitted perfecdy. “How was the target practice?” he enquired as he worked. “Very satisfactory.” [MASK] noticed as he handled the telescopic sight that the adjustment screws had been fixed into place with a blob of balsa wood cement.
<name>Drummond</name>	Drummond	Rodin	The eyes of the Englishman were open and stared back with frank candor. Except for the irises, which were of flecked grey so that they seemed smoky like the hoar mist on a winter’s morning. It took [MASK] a few seconds to realise that they had no expression at all.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Thomas	“About three hundred to go,” said the voice on the phone. “Leave the others to continue checking the remainder, just in case there is another phoney among the bunch,” instructed [MASK]. “Hand over the team leadership to the other fellow.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Lloyd	“I see, [MASK]. I see. In view of your evident desire to assist the Special Branch, a most laudable desire of course, do you think it too much to expect you to consult a little before throwing yourself into the breach?”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Caron	Although it was only twenty-four hours since he had waked from his last sleep, he looked tired, like [MASK]. “Nothing,” he said. “I’ve been through the lot over the past ten years.
<name>Leiter</name>	Leiter	Kowalski	What he could not follow was how die bodyguard outside the door had known his code-name, or what he had been hired to do. Perhaps the French police had worked that out for themselves. Perhaps [MASK] had sensed what he was, for he also had been a killer, but oafish and clumsy.
<name>Inspector</name>	Inspector	Jackal	Studying the effect of thirty minutes working on the [MASK]’s face with makeup, he suddenly dived into the chest and produced a wig. “What do you think of this?” he asked. The wig was of hair coloured iron-grey and cut en brosse.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Louis	“There is a little more,” went on his visitor as though he had not been interrupted. “You will make no further attempt to contact [MASK] or ask him or anyone else who I am or what my true identity is.
<name>Hardy</name>	Hardy	Caron	Until further notice I have been taken off all routine duties and given a rather special job. You’ve been assigned to be my assistant.” He did not bother to flatter [MASK] by revealing that he had asked for the young inspector to be his right-hand man.
<name>Macomber</name>	Macomber	Viktor	The head sagged back until the chin touched the chest again. As it did so the shaggy hair shook from side to side in answer. The voice from behind the table began again. “[MASK], ecoute-moi. You’re a hard man.
<name>Poirot</name>	Poirot	Lebel	A small Renault. The gardener discovered the body, but not until this afternoon. He thought she must have been sleeping. Then he climbed through the window and found her.” “Have you got the number and description of the car?” asked [MASK].
<name>Korchnoi</name>	Korchnoi	Kowalski	The men in the hotel had established a routine for keeping in touch with the r outside world three weeks previously (“see R 3 Rome report of June 30”), and this was being maintained. The courier remained Viktor [MASK]. End of message.
<name>Thibault</name>	Thibault	Lebel	Thank you.” He waited patiendy. [MASK] blinked rapidly several times and rose from his seat. He bobbed his head at the assembly of powerful men who commanded thousands of underlings and millions of francs. They smiled back at him. He turned and left die room.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Lebel	We can work it out from the length of the delay while the dialling disc spins back to zero. The number was Molitor fifty-nine-o-one.” “You have the address?” The man passed him a slip of paper. [MASK] glanced at it.
<name>Dracula</name>	Dracula	JoJo	“If he can, he will come. For the girl’s sake.” “Good. Then your part is done.” “Then get out of here,” shouted [MASK]. “Leave us alone.”
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Francois	[MASK] had been very gentle with her. As a man he was hard as the earth of the colonial province in whose four years of war he had been forged as a professional soldier. But he was very gende with the sister of one of his platoon.
<name>Quigley</name>	Quigley	Montclair	We do not pay half a million dollars for a man who needs the same amount of mollycoddling our own shooters need.” “What I would like to know,” muttered [MASK], “is how we can raise so much money so quickly.”
<name>Stangerson</name>	Stangerson	Kowalski	Then he called in every copy of the [MASK] confession and locked them all in his safe. Finally he sat down to write a report, which had only one listed recipient and was headed “for your eyes only.”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Kowalski	Were they really missing, gone for all time since the message by phone at three in the morning had told him [MASK] would never be questioned again because he was dead? Or were they hidden somewhere in the jumbled text that had come out of the deranged brain as the final reserves of strength failed?
<name>Lastly</name>	Lastly	Goossens	Lastly, when [MASK] needed to acquire a firearm for a customer, the client who presented himself at the gunsmith’s with a neatly forged I.D. card was never himself but always an out-of-work and out-of-jail petty crook or an actor resting between conquests of the stage.
<name>Cholmondeley</name>	Cholmondeley	Duggan	The Jackal idly turned over the pages in the parish register of births, marriages, and deaths for 1929, and for the month of April the name of [MASK], written in a crabbed and clerkly hand, caught his eye.
<name>Stratton</name>	Stratton	Bouvier	There were some in die PJ who suspected that [MASK], bogged down for a lot of the time with administrative details, appreciated a retiring subordinate who could handle the big, headline-making cases quietly, without stealing his superior’s thunder. But perhaps they were just being uncharitable.
<name>Poirot</name>	Poirot	Valentin	“Yes,” said [MASK], “he drove away this morning in the Baroness’s car. A small Renault. The gardener discovered the body, but not until this afternoon. He thought she must have been sleeping. Then he climbed through the window and found her.”
<name>Costello</name>	Costello	Trujillo	He mentioned a rumour that [MASK]’s car was stopped, for the ambushers to blow it open and kill the man inside, by a single shot from a marksman with a rifle. It was a hell of a shot—from one hundred and fifty yards at a speeding car.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Bernard	[MASK] looked very put out, but concealed it while they were still in the bar. Outside on the pavement he protested, “I don’t like you in that stuff. It makes you look like all those nasty pansies back in there.
<name>Levasseur</name>	Levasseur	Charrier	The other bore the name “M. et Mme. [MASK].” He listened for a moment but there was no sound from either of the flats. He examined the locks; both were embedded in the woodwork, which was thick and strong.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Ducret	The man was enraged by security measures if they obtruded on his privacy. This was one of the heaviest crosses [MASK] had to bear, and no one envied him the task of protecting a man from whom all forms of personal protection were an indignity he did not appreciate.
<name>René</name>	René	Touche	“ [MASK]. The point is, monsieur, we do not have half a million dollars cash.” “I am aware of that,” replied the Englishman. “If you want the job done you will have to make that sum from somewhere.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Gaston	He stood in the doorway in his nightshirt, pointedly refusing to invite the detectives in. From his hand the paraffin lamp cast flickering splashes of light over the group. “Come on, [MASK], you drive along that road to market pretty often.
<name>She</name>	She	Julie	This individual had become wary of crossing legionnaires, even old veterans with gammy legs, so he obscenely foreswore his former source of income and looked elsewhere. [MASK] was brought to bed in late 1955 and produced a girl, blue-eyed and golden-haired.
<name>Julian</name>	Julian	Casson	There’s a lot at stake, for all of us, including him. It depends how confident he feels of his own planning.” “Do you think he has a chance now—now that this has happened?” asked [MASK].
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jules	It makes you look like all those nasty pansies back in there. You’re a very good-looking young boy. You don’t need all that stuff.” “Sorry, [MASK], I thought it would improve things for you.
<name>Valmy</name>	Valmy	Lebel	The voice on the other end was flat, toneless. “Ici Chacal.” [MASK] thought furiously. “Ici Valmy” he said. There was a pause. He did not know what else to say. “What’s new?” asked the voice at the other end.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Ernestine	At that moment he heard [MASK] knock at the door. He made no sound. She knocked again. “T a vot cafe, madame,” she shrilled through the closed door. Making up his mind, the Jackal called out in French, in a tone half asleep.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Casson	To inform him of the transfer of the money at this stage, [MASK] reasoned, would be to encourage him to go into action prematurely. Whenever the man intended to strike was obviously his own choice, but a few extra days would make no difference.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Lebel	“I have already made it plain, there was no gallivanting before twelve-fifteen, and die man was already seventy minutes gone,” said [MASK]. “All right, we have been unlucky, very unlucky,” cut in the Minister.
<name>Chameleon</name>	Chameleon	Duggan	But to become [MASK] he could have changed his appearance. Indeed, he had probably changed it even for his first meeting with the OAS chiefs, and remained with changed appearance ever since, including the period when he applied for the false passport.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Rodin	[MASK] shrugged. “It has been a long process getting this information. The less time wasted from now on the better. If we are going to go ahead, let us now move fast.” He rose and the other two got up with him.
<name>Blondlot</name>	Blondlot	Duggan	But he looks like a pale blond.” “That’s true, sir. But hair habitually looks darker in photographs. It depends on the light, where it is placed and so forth. And then again, he could have tinted it paler to become [MASK].”
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Lebel	It was at this point that the call came through for [MASK]. This time he was gone for over twenty minutes. When he came back, he spoke to a completely silent assembly for a further ten minutes. “What do we do now?”
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Rolland	Natural enough, thought [MASK]. Had he then been wasting his time with the whole Kowalski operation? There was one word the legionnaire had mentioned twice, or rather mumbled twice, in answering these eight identical questions. The word was “secret.” As an adjective?
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Kowalski	Je vats demander” he said loftily. The Italian’s brow did not uncrease. “Demander; demander” repeated [MASK], pointing upwards through the ceiling. The Italian saw the light. “Ah, si. Domandare.
<name>Sanchez</name>	Sanchez	Valentin	Most of the flats were empty, their occupants away on holiday at the seaside or in the mountains. In short, the area of the Place du 18 Juin was sealed off, as [MASK] would say, “tighter than a mouse’s asshole.”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Lebel	How can he get a gun inside the circle of crowd barriers?” [MASK] stopped pacing and faced the Minister. He shrugged. “I don’t know. But he thinks he can, and he’s not failed yet, despite having some bad luck and some good.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Kowalski	Another was on his knees, rocking slowly back and forward, hand thrust deep into the torn groin. The last lay facedown on the carpet not far from the Pole, a dull bruise discolouring his left temple where one of [MASK]’s haymakers had caught him at full force.
<name>Poirot</name>	Poirot	Lebel	[MASK] finished reading the last of the reports from the file in front of him. When he looked up it was to find fourteen pairs of eyes on him, most of them cold and challenging. cAlors, rien?”
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Rodin	The third he kept in his own hand, but did not bother to read it. He knew the contents of all three files intimately. There was little enough to read. [MASK]’s reference to a “brief” dossier was depressingly accurate.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Lucien	“Yes, [MASK], I know. There’s nothing I can do. I’ve been given the job. So, from now we just have to do it.” “Where on earth do we start?”
<name>Hardy</name>	Hardy	Rodin	As you said there must be some action, or we shall be finished for lack of funds. One cannot run this kind of thing on love and kisses.” [MASK] nodded grimly. “I thought so. We have to raise some money from somewhere.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Lebel	He chose the place himself. If construction goes ahead according to plan, it may be the last Liberation Day that the old facade of the station remains untouched.” “What about crowd control?” asked [MASK]. “Well, we’ve all been working on it.
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Rodin	The important thing is that he be able to get in, unspotted and unsuspected. That is something which at the moment not one of us can do.” Both his listeners were silent, each gazing into his private thoughts as [MASK]’s plan took shape in their minds also.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Rodin	“Frankly, no,” said [MASK]. “But he is a professional. So am I, in my way. It is a frame of mind. One does not like to stand down an operation one has planned personally.”
<name>Max</name>	Max	Rodin	The Englishman started to walk. [MASK] ushered him inside the bedroom. It had been arranged like an office for a recruiting board. The escritoire served for the chairman’s desk and was littered with papers. Behind it was the single upright chair in the room.
<name>James</name>	James	Louison	A van from the village was parked there, the rear doors open. Two men were at the back taking something down from the tailboard. [MASK] was walking across from where he had been weeding one of the ornamental lawns to help carry the load.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Valremy	“What do you want to go down there for?” “I live there,” said the old man. “I’m retired on my pension. I have an attic.” [MASK] snatched the cards back.
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Kowalski	The return flight would be the next day. One booking? Single or return? Certainly, and the name? [MASK] gave the name on the papers he carried in his pocket. With passports abolished within the Common Market, the national identity card would be good enough.
<name>Stanton</name>	Stanton	Charles	“I’m afraid so. The hell of it is, there’s no time schedule for this operation. You’ve just got to find this assassin before he gets legrand [MASK]. We don’t know whether the man himself has a timetable, or what it could be.
<name>Stanislas</name>	Stanislas	JoJo	“Bastards,” said [MASK] with venom. “Shits.” “Is he coming?” asked one of the men. “He didn’t say. He just hung up on me,” said the Pole. The black, flat eyes of the Corsican stared back at him.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Calthrop	“Let’s run through it again,” he ordered the senior inspector seated beside him. “Ready?” “Sir.” “[MASK]: height, five feet eleven inches. Check?” “Sir.”
<name>Maigret</name>	Maigret	Lebel	[MASK]’s office was no more than twelve feet by fourteen, with two windows on the south face looking out over the river towards the lively honeycomb of the Latin Quarter clustering round the Boulevard St. Michel. Through one of the windows the sounds of the night and the warm summer air drifted in.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Widi	[MASK] the idea of an assassination once revealed, he would be attacking a fortress of security that was on its guard. The question was, could his plan for carrying out the killing beat the security screen. On balance, he was confident that it could.
<name>Callan</name>	Callan	Thomas	[MASK] could only think of one thing he had been up to, but he was surprised it had got so high in such a short time. Still, if the P.M. did not wish to take his own security man into his confidence for once, that was his business.
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Calthrop	The Chief of Police had gone white, and left immediately for his private estate where his aircraft and pilot were permanently waiting for him. Within a few hours mobs were rampaging through the streets seeking adherents of the old regime. [MASK] had to bribe a fisherman to sail him out of the island.
<name>Leiter</name>	Leiter	Rodin	“The extent and quality of the protective screen [MASK] and his two henchmen have built round themselves, according to the reports of my agents who have them under permanent surveillance, rule this out from the practical standpoint also,” he said.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Viktor	As he started to talk, or rather ramble incoherently between whimpers and squeaks, the calm voice from the man in the centre cut across the maunderings with incisive clarity. “Why are they there, [MASK] ... in that hotel . . .
<name>Drummond</name>	Drummond	Rodin	[MASK] had played his cards shrewdly. His last sentence, to which he already knew the answer, brought a flicker of expression to the grey eyes. “There is no man in the world who is proof against an assassin’s bullet,” said the Englishman.
<name>Llewellyn</name>	Llewellyn	Thomas	“It could be that there is an Englishman who does this kind of work,” suggested one of the inspectors. “But he’s not in our files.” “They’re all in our files, look you,” growled [MASK].
<name>Maigret</name>	Maigret	Lebel	“It would seem, gentlemen”—the Minister quietly used the plural form to take in both the police commissaires— “that we are back where we started. Square one, so to speak?” “Yes, I’m afraid so,” replied [MASK].
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Lebel	Then it was quieter, more concerned. [MASK] had no illusions that the heads of the Homicide departments of the major police forces of the Western world would fail to understand what he was hinting at but could not say.
<name>him</name>	him	JoJo	He turned to find die two men from the Action Service still where they had been, each with his Colt .45 Police Special in his hand. One was trained on [MASK], the other on his wife, who sat ashenfaced in the corner of the sofa.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Valremy	Several of the crowd by the barrier cast him glances full of pity. These old codgers always kept their medals, [MASK] thought, like it was the only thing they had in life. Well, maybe it was the only thing left for some of them.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Valentin	You can stand your boys down now. He’s in our territory now. We’ll have to handle it from here.” “You’re sure it is the Danish pastor?” asked [MASK]. “It could be coincidence.”
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Kowalski	Disbelievingly, [MASK] stared at the mouthpiece in his hand. Without a word he replaced it on the cradle and blundered out of die booth. After paying the cost of the call he collected the mail, snapped the steel case on his wrist tight shut, and walked back to the hotel.
<name>Poirot</name>	Poirot	Lebel	There’s been a murder.” “Where?” asked [MASK] with quickened interest. “At a chateau in the neighborhood. The report just came in from the village constable.” “Who’s the dead person?” “The owner of the chateau.
<name>Gregory</name>	Gregory	Rolland	“We must get a better description than that,” protested the head of the Records Office. “Was any name mentioned?” “No,” said [MASK]. “What you have just heard is the outcome of three hours spent interrogating the clerk.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Claude	If he ever gets wind of what you know before you catch him, and changes his identity again, [MASK] my boy, he thought, you are going to be up against it in a big way. Aloud, he said, “Really up against it.”
<name>professionals</name>	professionals	John	Not, repeat not, run-of-the-mill gangland thugs who either have or are known to be capable of knocking off somebody in a feud in the underworld. Political killers, [MASK], men or a man capable of assassinating a well-guarded politician or statesman for money.”
<name>Crutch</name>	Crutch	Lebel	“Allons, enfants de la patrie, le jour de gloire est arrive...Several of the crowd took up the familiar chant of the “Marseillaise.” “Crutch?” To himself, [MASK]’s voice seemed a small thing, very far away.
<name>Poirot</name>	Poirot	Lebel	“Have you fingerprinted the car?” asked [MASK]. “Of course, and the room at the chateau. Hundreds of them, all matching.” “Get them up here as fast as you can.” “Right, will do.
<name>Thibault</name>	Thibault	Francois	Only a handful of conscripts scuttled out of barracks and made the rendezvous at the Prefet’s office. The professionals let them go. Fighting broke out between the mutineers and the loyal regiments within a week. Eatly in May [MASK] was shot in a skirmish with a loyalist Army unit.
<name>Jeannot</name>	Jeannot	Valremy	“Je peux passer?” he asked timidly. “Come on. Dad, let’s have a look at your papers.” The old war veteran fumbled inside his shirt, which could have done with a wash. He produced two cards which [MASK] took and looked at.
