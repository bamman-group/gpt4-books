<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jefferson	I never got nothing I wanted in my whole life. Now I’m go’n get a whole day?” I didn’t know what to say. He looked at me awhile, then he turned to the window again. “Do you like fruit, [MASK]?”
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Vivian	Do I know what a man is? Do I know how a man is supposed to die? I’m still trying to find out how a man should live. Am I supposed to tell someone how to die who has never lived?” [MASK] lowered her head.
<name>Miss Maudie</name>	Miss Maudie	Paul	He had on a pair of faded denims and brogans with no laces. He was dragging his feet to keep the shoes on. “Here he is,” the deputy said. “See y’all at three.” “[MASK]’s not here today?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sid	“Yes, it’s passable, [MASK]. You won’t get your brown and white shoes dirty.” They sentence you to death because you were at the wrong place at the wrong time, with no proof that you had anything at all to do with the crime other than being there when it happened.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Farrell	She would return late in the evening, and we would hardly see her again until the next Sunday, when she would climb into the back of the car to go to mass. I supposed it was her husband, [MASK], who got her out tonight, because she had never come before.
<name>Jefferson</name>	Jefferson	Sheriff	“[MASK] saying he don’t like the idea at all. Saying nobody can make that thing a man. Saying might as well let him go like he is.” “I hope that’s his final word,” I said. “It sure would relieve my mind.”
<name>Missy</name>	Missy	Vivian	He grunted. “Just keep on vexing me,” he said. “I bet you I say something ’bout that old yellow woman you go with.” “You’re speaking of [MASK]?” “Just keep on vexing me,” he said.
<name>Chiron</name>	Chiron	Guidry	“What you plan on doing when you come up there—if I let you come up there?” [MASK] asked me. “I have no idea, sir,” I told him. “You’re not trying to play with me, now, are you?”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Jefferson	[MASK] had filled three quarters of the first page. The letters were large and awkward, the way someone would write who could barely see. He had written across the lines instead of above them. He had used the eraser so much that in some places the paper was worn through.
<name>Miss Honey</name>	Miss Honey	Vivian	“She’s waiting at that school right now for me to bring her news about you. That’s a lady you spoke of, boy. That’s a lady. Because it’s she who keeps me coming here. Not your nannan, not my aunt. [MASK].
<name>James Joyce</name>	James Joyce	Joyce	He told about [MASK]’s family, his religion, his education, his writing. He spoke of a book called Dubliners and a story in the book titled “Ivy Day in the Committee Room.” Regardless of race, regardless of class, that story was universal, he said.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Vivian	I tried wiping that away. I wanted to see nothing but miles and miles of clear, blue water, then an island where I could be alone. Or [MASK] and me, just the two of us, and absolutely no one else. No one else.
<name>Blue</name>	Blue	Jefferson	I smiled at him. “Will you be her friend? Will you eat some of the gumbo? Just a little bit? One spoonful?” He made a slight nod. I smiled at him again. “[MASK],” I said. We had started walking.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Vivian	I know we can do better someplace else.” “I’m still married,” [MASK] said. “A separation is not a divorce. I can’t go anywhere until all this is over with.” “That’s not what’s keeping you here.
<name>Chigurh</name>	Chigurh	Paul	“You can’t ever tell,” the deputy said. “Take them on up, [MASK].” “Follow me,” the young deputy said. We followed him down a long, dark corridor, passing offices with open doors, and bathrooms for white ladies and white men.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Vivian	“That’s what I want too,” she said. “I love you, [MASK],” I said. “I want you to know that. I love you very much.” “I hope you love me half as much as I love you.”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Claiborne	I raised my hand for [MASK] to bring me another beer. He gave me the bottle and looked into my eyes, and he could tell that I didn’t feel like talking. So he went back down the bar to where the old men were still talking baseball.
<name>he</name>	he	Guidry	The fat man didn’t like that quick maneuver. I could see it in his face. “You’re smart,” [MASK] said. “Maybe you’re just a little too smart for your own good.” I was quiet. I knew when to be quiet.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Paul	And with the food it was the same. The chief deputy sat behind the desk, watching everything. To him, this was how things were supposed to be and how they would be. [MASK] and I left the office and walked down the narrow, dark corridor.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Vivian	I had just finished eating and was washing the plate in the pan of soap water when I heard someone come up on the front porch. [MASK] was at the door. We stood there looking at each other a moment, then she came in and took off her coat and galoshes.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Vivian	Why not let the hog die without knowing anything?” [MASK] raised her head to look at me, and she was crying. I took one of her hands in both of mine. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to do this to you.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jefferson	Cooked for you, washed for you, taken care of you when you were sick? She is sick now, [MASK], and she is asking for only one thing in this world. Walk like a man. Meet her up there.”
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Primer	He looked over the classes from one side of the aisle to the other, as though he was trying to catch someone doing something improper. “[MASK], on your feet,” he said. They stood up, seven or eight of them.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Jefferson	“It would mean so much to her if you would eat some of the gumbo.” I stopped when we came to the corner of the room. He stopped too, his head still down. “Look at me, [MASK], please,” I said.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Vivian	I cut two slices from the chocolate cake my aunt had in the safe, then we sat down at the table, facing the yard and the field. “It’s really peaceful,” [MASK] said. “Sunday is the saddest day of the week.”
<name>Rusty</name>	Rusty	Claiborne	Out of the comer of my eye I could still see [MASK] wrestling with the fat one, while continuing to holler at me and the tall one to stop. But since the tall one was not paying any attention to him, I wasn’t about to drop my guard.
<name>[MASK]</name>	[MASK]	Lucy	Without looking around, the woman told him to go and find it himself. When he came back to pay her, she told him to have [MASK] send the money some other time. My aunt did not sleep at the house the night before.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Inez	“No’m, I got everything under control,” [MASK] told her. “Well, in that case, I may as well help myself to another quick shot.” She poured about two ounces of bourbon into her glass and added ice cubes.
<name>Officer</name>	Officer	Paul	“A nice little pine tree.” His head was bowed. He didn’t answer. His hair had begun to grow back, but you could still see the big bones of his skull. A half hour later, [MASK] came in to return him to his cell.
<name>Boo</name>	Boo	Jefferson	get me a whole gallon. That’s what I want—a whole gallon. Eat it with a pot spoon.” “I can bring you some ice cream anytime, [MASK],” I said. “I’m go’n wait,” he said.
<name>John</name>	John	Jefferson	“I brought you some food,” I said. His body took up the bunk, so I set the bag of food on the floor near his head. I went to the wall and stood under the window. “You need anything, [MASK]?”
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Jefferson	“No, you’re not sorry.” “I just couldn’t help it.” “Yes, you could.” “I couldn’t.” “You could have walked out of there.” “Can [MASK] walk out of where he is?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Vivian	People were leaving church and coming out into the road. “You think your aunt has made it home?” [MASK] asked. “She is usually the last one to leave.” “You want me to go before she gets home?”
<name>Reverend</name>	Reverend	Reverend	“Mine is reading, writing, and arithmetic, yours is saving souls.” “He don’t need no more reading, writing, and ’rithmedc.” “That’s where you come in, [MASK].”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Fee	[MASK] could hear the man with the cowboy hat talking to another man through the window. He was asking the man did everything reach okay, and the man out on the truck said yes, everything did. Out in the corridor, more people were coming in for work.
<name>He</name>	He	Vivian	“Of course you do,” I said. “It’s the same old story. People want to keep a local boy for themselves, because they have so little.” “I’m not talking about the people,” [MASK] said.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Jefferson	They asked me for money, and I gave them the change I had. There was an empty cell between [MASK] and the rest of the prisoners. He was at the end of the cellblock and was lying on his bunk when we came up.
<name>Michelle</name>	Michelle	Vivian	This was [MASK]’s first time back here, and I told her that my people had worked these fields ever since slavery, and many of them were buried in the cemetery behind us. I asked her if she wanted a piece of cane, and she said yes.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Higgins	I need more paper to write on, I need more chalk for the blackboards, I need more pencils, I even need a better heater.” “We’re all in the same shape, [MASK],” he said. I didn’t answer him.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Estelle	Well, does it?” No one answered. Most averted their eyes. I noticed that the girl whom I had criticized at the blackboard had lowered her head and was crying. “[MASK], leave the class if you can’t control yourself,” I ordered her.
<name>Tituba</name>	Tituba	Jefferson	But you can be better. Because we need you to be and want you to be. Me, your godmother, the children, and all the rest of them in the quarter. Do you understand what I’m saying to you, [MASK]? Do you?”
<name>Boon</name>	Boon	Jefferson	“Chicken, dirt, it don’t matter,” he said. “Yeah, it do, [MASK]. Yeah, it do. Dirt?” “All the same,” he said. “It don’t matter.” “My chicken?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Frank	“What you say, [MASK]?” the sheriff asked the fat man. The fat man shrugged his shoulders. “I’m just standing here.” “I’ll go to him, and I’ll leave it up to him,” the sheriff said to me.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Thelma	I ate the food hungrily because I had not had dinner, and I sopped up the gravy with the light bread. [MASK] watched me all the time. When I was finished, she put a wrinkled ten-dollar bill on the counter by my plate.
<name>John</name>	John	Vivian	[MASK] said. “I think—” “Just be quiet.” “You taking over my house?” my aunt said. “No, ma’am,” I said. “But we drank the coffee. And this is the woman I’m going to marry one day.
<name>Rosa</name>	Rosa	Emma	“[MASK]. The Lord is merciful.” “What I done done?” She was shaking her head and crying now. “What I done done my Master?” “Have patience,” my aunt said, patting her on the shoulder.
<name>Antoine</name>	Antoine	Jefferson	In case I wanted to leave before then, I could call a trusty, and the trusty would come to get him. “[MASK],” I said. He didn’t look up. “Your nannan couldn’t make it today,” I said.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Reverend	“I’m sure he needs to hear that, [MASK].” “You sure you sure?” “Maybe not. Maybe I’m not sure about anything.” “I know I’m sure,” he said. “Yes, I know I’m sure.”
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Irene	“I can name about a dozen younger than [MASK], and about that many old as my aunt, who are in love with me,” I said. “But I love only one woman.” “Don’t you think she loves you?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Vivian	“Another round,” I told her. She left. “I want you to go up there,” [MASK] said. “They make those decisions, sweetheart, I don’t.” “If they say yes, I want you to go for me.”
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Paul	My aunt and the minister walked behind her, and I followed. [MASK] was not there, and the chief deputy, after searching the food and us, led us out of the office, into the corridor. He walked several paces ahead of us, as if we were not with him.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Paul	I moved into the ditch as [MASK] came up even with me and stopped. We looked at each other, and I knew he had come to bring me the news. I didn’t go up to the car, as I was supposed to do; I waited for him to make his move.
<name>With</name>	With	Dora	“I couldn’t have wished for anything more. But why today?” “I don’t know,” she said. “I just missed you. I wanted to see you. “Where are the children?” “[MASK],” she said.
<name>Boo</name>	Boo	Jefferson	I didn’t look at her; I didn’t want to see her face. “The children sent you some more pecans and peanuts,” I said to [MASK]. “Did you eat the others I brought you?” “Some,” he said.
<name>George</name>	George	Claiborne	“I’m all right.” “Get him out of here,” [MASK] said. “I don’t give a shit if he’s all right or not. ’Fore you know it, the law’ll be here. Get him out of here.”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Inez	“That’s for sure,” [MASK] chipped in. “A pretty young lady. Good manners. Quality is what you have. Quality.” They were quiet again. Maybe they didn’t have any more to say.
<name>She</name>	She	Vivian	By the time she had finished, enough coffee had dripped and I was pouring it into the cups. [MASK] put a fork on each plate and placed cake before the women. They said thanks, but they said it quietly.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Inez	Saying might as well let him go like he is.” “I hope that’s his final word,” I said. “It sure would relieve my mind.” “Why don’t you sit down,” [MASK] said. “You’ll feel better.”
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Jefferson	I put the rest of the pork chop and the slice of light bread on the napkin before me. “[MASK], do you know what ‘moral’ means?” I asked him. He looked at me, knowing that I knew what he was thinking about.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Irene	[MASK] left to get in line, but she looked back at me over her shoulder. She was right; I was not happy. I had heard the same carols all my life, seen the same little play, with the same mistakes in grammar.
<name>Andrei</name>	Andrei	Paul	r WHEN I CAME INTO the office, [MASK] looked me straight in the face. He knew it was unnecessary to search me and the food, but he knew he had to do it. He also knew that he should not even think about not doing it.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Peggy	“She’s still inside.” “Having a drink later?” “A couple,” [MASK] said. As we walked up to the entrance of the school, I saw two boys taking in the flag.
<name>Biglow</name>	Biglow	Jefferson	Those who were not at church were told what the others had decided, that he, [MASK], should have all their respect this one day. Now, except for the sound of the tractor back in the field, the rest of the plantation was quiet.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Claiborne	“Usual?” [MASK] asked me. He knew what I drank, but he would always ask. I nodded. “What you doing here on Monday?” he asked, while pouring me a brandy. “I needed a drink,” I said.
<name>help</name>	help	Guidry	Go on and scream for [MASK], if that’s what you want.” We looked at each other, and I could see in those big reddened eyes that he was not going to scream. He was full of anger—and who could blame him?—but he was no fool.
<name>hammer</name>	hammer	Westcott	He still held the piece of chalk. “Put that chalk down. I can’t afford to break it.” He passed the piece of chalk to his left hand and held out the right hand to me again. I brought the [MASK] down into his palm.
<name>Boo</name>	Boo	Y’all	“Some,” I said. “[MASK] talked?” Her mind was still far away. “A little,” I said. Now her focus became closer, much closer. She was looking at me now. “What y’all talked about?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Grant	“What is the matter, [MASK]?” she asked. “I just had to see you.” “Is something the matter?” “When was the last time I told you I loved you?” “A second ago.”
<name>Janelle</name>	Janelle	Irene	Because if he does not, she knows that she will never get another chance to see a black man stand for her. “And for my aunt and [MASK] it is the same. Who else does my aunt have? She has never been married.
<name>Miss Maudie</name>	Miss Maudie	Pichot	All that other stuff I went through was to lead up to this day. Going up to [MASK]’s house, meeting the sheriff, the three visits to the jail with her—all that was nothing but preparation for today.
<name>Miss Dove</name>	Miss Dove	Jefferson	My faith is in you, [MASK]. The children returned from dinner as I had asked them to do, and at ten minutes to twelve, I lined them up before the door. When the last one had marched into the church, I went to my desk to face them.
<name>Artie</name>	Artie	Claiborne	They were probably out of work, and it was just plain frustration that made them go on like that. Just cool it, I told myself. You just cool it now. But when I looked down the bar, I could see that [MASK] was listening to them too.
<name>Mask</name>	Mask	Guidry	“You can come anytime you like. Not before ten in the morning, not after four in the evening. Any other questions?” “Any idea how much time he has left?” “That’s entirely up to the governor, not me,” [MASK] said.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Claiborne	After walking her to the car and kissing her good night, I went back inside and stood at the bar. [MASK] wiped glasses and did not talk to anybody. He served you when you raised your glass for another drink or your botde for another beer, then he went back to wiping glasses.
<name>me</name>	me	Vivian	“But I have to live my own life.” “You go to church?” “I’m Catholic.” My aunt looked at [MASK] and nodded her head, as if she was thinking, What else could you possibly be?
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Jefferson	“[MASK]?” But he was not listening. I looked around the cell—at the seatless brown-stained commode, the washbowl whose faucet never stopped dripping, the little metal shelf over the bowl, which held his pan, tin cup, and spoon.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	INEZ	[MASK] WAS IN THE KITCHEN when I came up the back stairs, and she opened the door before I had a chance to knock. I could tell she had been crying. She had wiped the tears from her cheeks, but I could see the marks under her eyes.
<name>Jefferson</name>	Jefferson	Jefferson	“He ain’t got time for nothing else, that’s what’s wrong with that.” “[MASK] needs something in that cell,” I said. “Yes, he do,” the minister said. “You hit the nail on the head, mister.
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Bird	One of them said, “Don’t let [MASK] hang us up in that ditch, now. I don’t feel like unloading all this wood ’way out here and got to put it on that wagon again.” “She go’n pull,” the other one said.
<name>Thelma</name>	Thelma	Vivian	“I don’t give a shit if he’s all right or not. ’Fore you know it, the law’ll be here. Get him out of here.” “Can you stand up, honey?” [MASK] asked again. “I can stand up.”
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Vivian	I said. “You know what I’m talking about,” [MASK] said. “Don’t tell me you’re jealous of that child.” “Well?” “Well, what?” “Is she in love with you?”
<name>24</name>	24	Paul	Cool, dead weight. I squeezed his hand with both of mine. I must have had that grin still on my face when [MASK] opened the door to let me out. “Everything’s okay?” he asked. “Yes,” I said. 24
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jefferson	That was his story. The prosecutor’s story was different. The prosecutor argued that [MASK] and the other two had gone there with the full intention of robbing the old man and then killing him so that he could not identify them.
<name>John</name>	John	Jefferson	But I was the only one. And I soon realized why. “May we bow our heads,” the minister said, after I had put down my spoon. [MASK]’s head had been bowed from the moment he sat down. I lowered my eyes.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Vivian	When I came back to the room, I asked [MASK] to lie on the bed beside me. We lay on our sides for a while, then we lay on our backs, looking up at the ceiling. The room’s only light came from the fireplace.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Vivian	“You don’t love your mama? You don’t love your daddy?” “I love both of them,” [MASK] said, and looked at me. “But I have to live my own life.” “You go to church?”
<name>Sykes</name>	Sykes	Jefferson	“Like coming here vexing me?” he asked. “Am I vexing you, [MASK]?” He grunted. “Just keep on vexing me,” he said. “I bet you I say something ’bout that old yellow woman you go with.”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Clark	“My sentiments exactly,” the sheriff said. “But if we put him in handcuffs and leg chains?” “I wouldn’t even bother,” [MASK] said. “I wouldn’t either,” the sheriff said. “But you got these women.”
<name>Lucynell</name>	Lucynell	Vivian	“You went to church today?” “I went to nine o’clock mass,” [MASK] said. “You going next Sunday?” “Yes, ma’am.” “Sunday after that?” “I hope so.”
<name>Love</name>	Love	Honey	Who are you? Who are we? Tell me.” “All I know is I love you,” I said. “That’s not enough,” she said. “What is love?” “[MASK]—” “What is it?”
<name>Miss Honey</name>	Miss Honey	Vivian	“Sounds like a good idea,” [MASK] said. She put some papers into a briefcase and stood up. “I have to see the principal before she leaves. Do you know how to clean a blackboard?” “I’ve done a few.”
<name>Woolsey</name>	Woolsey	Guidry	“You and I are in accord there,” he said. “But my wife thinks different. Now, which one you think is right, me or her?” The fat man snorted. He thought [MASK] had me.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Jefferson	I went to the washbowl and got a handful of water to drink. I tried turning the faucet off completely, but it continued to drip. The water had left a brown stain from the top of the bowl to the drain. I turned to [MASK] again.
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Guidry	Not mine.” “That was not the question,” [MASK] said. “Make him a man for what?” “To die with some dignity, I suppose. I suppose that’s what she wants.” “You think that’s a good idea?”
<name>Boomer</name>	Boomer	Jefferson	Most had gone. To southern cities, to northern cities, others to the grave. Had [MASK] ever hit a home run? He was as big as anyone else, stronger than most, but to hit a home run off a ragball was a feat.
<name>Strawberry</name>	Strawberry	Gable	He looked at me, not as he had done in the past, in pain, with hate. He looked at me with an inner calmness now. Was it the ice cream? “He favor [MASK]?” he asked.
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Thelma	I kept moving back, maneuvering, so that I could land a good punch when he came in. I felt something heavy and soft behind me, and as I glanced around at [MASK], with that damned broom, the bricklayer hit me solidly on the arm, and down I went.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Jefferson	He looked down at his hands and rubbed them together. For a man his size, he had really big hands. He rubbed them again before raising his eyes to me. “There ain’t much time.” “[MASK]?” “Yes.”
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Peggy	“Come on, let’s go find [MASK] and them and have a drink.” “Not until I get another kiss.” “What is the matter?” she said, after we had kissed. Maybe it was the way I had held her.
<name>Boo</name>	Boo	Guidry	He unwrapped two or three pieces of candy, checked out the bag of sweet potatoes, then, finished, he wiped his hands on a pocket handkerchief. “Still think you can get something into that head of his?” [MASK] spoke across the tips of those cowboy boots.
