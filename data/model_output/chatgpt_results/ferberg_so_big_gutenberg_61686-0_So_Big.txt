<name>Isabelle</name>	Isabelle	Dallas	he said. [MASK] never irritated him. She rested him, he told himself. He would arm himself against her, but one minute after meeting her he would sink gratefully and resistlessly into her quiet depths. Sometimes he thought all this was an assumed manner in her.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dirk	She had it lighted always on winter evenings and in the spring when the nights were sharp. In [MASK]’s absence she would sit before it at night long after the rest of the weary household had gone to bed.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Paula	Empty shelves gaped from the wall on all sides. The room was meant to hold hundreds of volumes. Perhaps fifty or sixty in all now leaned limply against each other or lay supine. [MASK] laughed. “They do look sort of sparse, don’t they?
<name>Mr. Gatsby</name>	Mr. Gatsby	Dirk	[MASK] did not spend much time in the place. Sometimes he did not sit in a chair in the sitting room for days at a time, using the room only as a short cut in his rush for the bedroom to change from office to dinner clothes.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Dirk	In the _world_!” “Yeh?” [MASK] would reply, absently. There was nothing absent-minded about his tone this afternoon as he talked to his mother on the telephone. “Sure you don’t mind? Then I’ll be out next Saturday.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Pa’ll	Well, now, [MASK] be out to-morrow and I’ll probably come with him. I’ve got a committee meeting, but I can easily——” “You said—did you say your father would be out to-morrow! Out where?”
<name>Pa</name>	Pa	Jan	How hot his head is! Listen! Is that [MASK] with the doctor? No. No, it isn’t. Mustard plasters. Are you sure that’s the right thing?” It was before the day of the omnipresent farmhouse telephone and the farmhouse Ford.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Selina	The sweet heavy scent of the fruit filled the room. [MASK] brought the parlour lamp into the kitchen, the better to see. It was a nickel-bellied lamp with a yellow glass shade that cast a mellow golden glow. “You didn’t go to the meeting,” primly.
<name>Beatrice</name>	Beatrice	Theodore	In something in the way you carry yourself. It’s what they call force, I suppose. Anyway, you’ve got it.” “Has your husband got it?” “[MASK]! No! That is——” “There you are.
<name>She</name>	She	Paula	What did you think?” “I thought: ‘She’s bored with her husband and she’s trying to vamp me. I’ll have to be careful.’” [MASK] laughed delightedly. “That’s nice and frank . . . What else?”
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Selina	Hothouses. Coldframes. The farm. It looked very trim and neat. The house, white with green shutters ([MASK]’s dream realized), smiled at them from among the willows that were already burgeoning hazily under the wooing of a mild and early spring.
<name>Herb</name>	Herb	Pervus	She wanted suddenly to kiss him, knew he would hate it with all the boy and all the Holland Dutch in him, and did not. She made up her mind to drive east and then south. [MASK] had sometimes achieved a late sale to outlying grocers.
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Dirk	One doesn’t despise them as food, knowing that. . . . Come, climb down, [MASK]. Here’s a lady mother used to know—oh, years and years ago, when she was a girl. Thousands of years ago.”
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Kennedy	“What did you do to-day? Did you have a good day? . . . Why didn’t you call me? . . . Did you follow up that suggestion you made about [MASK]? I think it’s a wonderful idea, don’t you?
<name>Ethan</name>	Ethan	Pervus	But in the morning [MASK] might have noted (if he had been a man given to noting) that the fine jaw-line was set as determinedly as ever with an angle that spelled inevitably paint, drainage, humus, potash, phosphoric acid, and a horse team.
<name>he</name>	he	Selina	“I haven’t seen her,” [MASK] said, “since she went away to school the first year. She must be—let’s see—she’s a year older than you are. She’s nineteen going on twenty. Last time I saw her
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Dallas	But oh, he wished she didn’t want to do portraits in oils. He wished—— It was after eleven when they emerged from the Art Institute doorway and stood a moment together at the top of the broad steps surveying the world that lay before them. [MASK] said nothing.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Pervus	[MASK] took the stone, weighed it in his great palm, blinked as he always did when discussing a subject of which he was ignorant. “How much could you get for it? Fifty dollars, maybe. Five hundred is what I would need.”
<name>Mrs. Hopewell</name>	Mrs. Hopewell	Roelf	She had finished the supper dishes and was busy with a huge bowl, flour, a baking board. “Sure go up. I got my bread to set yet and what all.” “If I could have some hot water——” “[MASK]!
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Selina	Slowly, inch by inch, that bedroom window crept down, down. Then, too, the Pools objected to the icy blasts which swept the open stairway and penetrated their hermetically sealed bedrooms below. Often the water in the pitcher on her washstand was frozen when [MASK] awoke.
<name>John</name>	John	Selina	[MASK] leaned toward him. “I’ll teach you. I’ll teach you.” “How do you mean, teach me?” “Evenings.” He looked down at his great calloused palms, then up at her. “What would you take for pay?”
<name>Black George</name>	Black George	Pat	She looked boyish and young standing beside the sturdy bulk of [MASK], the head stableman. She wore tan whipcord breeches, a coat of darker stuff, a little round felt hat whose brim curved away from her face. She greeted him. “I’ve been out two hours.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Dirk	That’s why men won’t do it.” She would often take the boy [MASK] with her into the fields, placing him on a heap of empty sacks in the shade. He invariably crawled off this lowly throne to dig and burrow in the warm black dirt.
<name>Aunt Dahlia</name>	Aunt Dahlia	Maartje	pickles . . . watch how you don’t spill . . . plum preserves . . .” [MASK]’s own basket was of gigantic proportions and staggering content. Her sandwiches were cubic blocks; her pickles clubs of cucumber; her pies vast plateaus.
<name>Ethan</name>	Ethan	Pervus	Knowing well that the entire community was urging him toward this profitable match with the plump, rich, red-lipped widow, [MASK] set his will like a stubborn steer and would have none of her. He was uncomfortable in his untidy house; he was lonely, he was unhappy.
<name>he</name>	he	Selina	The boy was a plump hardy infant who employed himself cheerfully in whatever spot [MASK] happened to deposit him. He had his father’s blond exterior, his mother’s brunette vivacity. At two he was a child of average intelligence, sturdy physique, and marked good humour.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Selina	It was a sultry night, with flashes of heat lightning in the west. “I should think if you opened the windows,” [MASK] said to the old High Prairie doctor over and over, emboldened by terror, “it would help him to breathe.
<name>Mrs. Graves</name>	Mrs. Graves	Julie	Oh, I don’t believe I’d like _that_. You did! Well, I’ll have it for you next week when you come home. I’ll get the recipe from [MASK].” He didn’t think he’d be home next week.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Dirk	“[MASK]! Come, now. Come up here with mother.” Grumbling, he climbed to the seat, yawned, smacked his lips, rubbed his knuckles into his eyes. “What are we here for?” “So we can sell the garden truck and earn money.”
<name>no answer</name>	no answer	Dirk	She had been invited to dinners and luncheons and dances, but their doings, she told [MASK], had bored her. “They’re nice,” she said, “but they don’t have much fun. They’re all trying to be something they’re not.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Selina	It isn’t for women.” [MASK] had regained health and vigour after two years of wretchedness. She felt steel-strong and even hopeful again, sure sign of physical well-being. Long before now she had realized that this time must inevitably come.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Dirk	I worked in the sun and cold for. I’m not reproaching you; I didn’t mind the work. Forgive me for even mentioning it. But, [MASK], I don’t want my son to be known as one of the _jeunesse dorée_.
<name>her</name>	her	Selina	When he told [MASK] she flushed like a girl, as she sometimes still did when she was much excited. “Yes, I saw it in the paper. I wonder,” she added, quietly, “if I shall see him.”
<name>John</name>	John	Bouts	The child, too, had died. A girl. He was unlucky, like that. It was the same with the farm. “Spring, half of the land is under water. My piece, just. [MASK]’s place, next to me, is high and rich.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Chris	The last truckster coming in at night for a beer or a cup of coffee and a sandwich was greeted by [MASK], white-aproned, pink-cheeked, wide awake, swabbing the bar’s shining surface with the thirsty cloth, swishing it with the sly rubber-tipped board.
<name>Mr. Oak</name>	Mr. Oak	Dallas	I’ve a feeling she’ll be there, exactly the same. She will, won’t she?” “She’ll be there.” It was early spring; the busiest of seasons on the farm. [MASK] emerged in greatcoat and a new spring hat.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Dirk	Her abundant hair was neatly braided in two long plaits. She looked somehow girlish there in the dim light, her great soft eyes gazing up at him. “[MASK], sit down here at the side of my bed the way you used to.”
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Selina	His little eyes gleamed. His wooden sceptre pounded for silence. High in one hand, balanced daintily on his finger tips, he held [MASK]’s little white shoe box, with its red ribbon binding it, and the plume of evergreen stuck in the ribbon.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Dirk	In her French-heeled slippers and her filmy silk stockings she went out into the rich black furrows of the fields, [MASK] carrying the basket. “Asparagus,” she ordered first. Then, “But where is it? Is _that_ it!”
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Selina	Then, too, the gaze of a man who talks little is always more effective than that of one who is loquacious. [MASK], in her black silk dress, and her plain black hat, and her sensible shoes was rather a quaint little figure amongst all those vivacious, bevoiled, and beribboned mammas.
<name>Doris</name>	Doris	Selina	It was ugly. It hurt you to look at it, just. Certainly, the boy was different. [MASK], none too knowledgeous herself, still recognized that here was something rare, something precious to be fostered, shielded, encouraged.
<name>She</name>	She	Selina	Who?——” He looked about, apishly. [MASK]’s cheeks matched her gown. Her eyes were wide and dark with the effort she was making to force back the hot haze threatening them. Why had she mounted this wretched soap-box!
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Selina	The profession of architecture was put definitely behind him. There had been no building in all the months of the war; probably would be none in years. Materials were prohibitive, labour exorbitant. He did not say to [MASK] that he had put the other work from him.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Selina	For her flashes of flame he had a mingled feeling of uneasiness and pride. In the manner of all young brides, [MASK] started bravely out to make her husband over. He was handsome, strong, gentle; slow, conservative, morose.
<name>unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Roelf	“They came home last night. I have got some books that belong to you.” He made as though to open the suitcase. “No, no! Keep them.” “Good-bye.” “Good-bye, [MASK].”
<name>Edie</name>	Edie	Selina	[MASK] rummaged for the shoe box, lined it with a sheet of tissue paper, rolled up her sleeves, got out mixing bowl, flour, pans. Cup cakes were her ambition. She baked six of them. They came out a beautiful brown but somewhat leaden.
<name>Tommy's</name>	Tommy's	Dirk	She wore an old gray sweater buttoned up tight, for the air was still sharp. On her head was a battered black felt soft hat (an old one of [MASK]’s) much like the one she had worn to the Haymarket that day ten years ago.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Selina	Again. Again. Footsteps up the hall. The door opened to disclose a large woman, high cheek-boned, in a work apron; a cook, apparently. “Good morning,” said [MASK]. “Would you like some fresh country vegetables?”
<name>house</name>	house	Dirk	I can’t!” cried all the prim dim Vermont Peakes, in chorus. “All right. Starve to death and let them take the farm and [MASK], then.” At that she pulled the knob hard. Jangle went the bell in the hall.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Dallas	In the cruel spring sunshine you saw that the black hair was sprinkled with gray. “On days like this I refuse to believe that I’m forty-five. [MASK], tell me I’m not forty-five.”
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Paula	At the bottom of the steps she turned. “Why can’t you two stay to supper? You can quarrel comfortably right through the meal and drive home in the cool of the evening.” “I’ll stay,” said [MASK], “thanks.
<name>Madame Ratignolle</name>	Madame Ratignolle	Beauty	“Desert who?” He was startled. “[MASK]! Self-expression. Whatever you want to call it. You wait! She’ll turn on you some day. Some day you’ll want her, and she won’t be there.”
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Surprised	They got in the way of walking out of the classroom together, across the campus. She told him something of herself. “Your people farmers!” [MASK], she looked at his well-cut clothes, his slim, strong, unmarked hands, his smart shoes and cap.
<name>Madame Ratignolle</name>	Madame Ratignolle	Dirk	You said——” She interrupted him with a little cry. “I know I did. I know I did.” Suddenly she raised a warning finger. Her eyes were luminous, prophetic. “[MASK], you can’t desert her like that!”
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Dirk	A great skylight formed half the ceiling and sloped down at the north end of the room. A man and a girl sat talking earnestly on the couch in another corner. A swarthy foreign-looking chap, vaguely familiar to [MASK], was playing softly at the piano.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Dallas	A mixture of grandeur and cheapness; of tawdriness and magnificence; of splendour and ugliness. “Nice,” said [MASK]. A long breath. She was a part of all this. “Yes.” He felt an outsider. “Want a sandwich?
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Theodore	[MASK] never rides. He never takes any sort of exercise. Sits in that great fat car of his.” They went into the coach house, a great airy whitewashed place with glittering harness and spurs and bridles like jewels in glass cases.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Dirk	[MASK] looked up then, quickly. “If I get it all picked can I go?” “It’s a day’s job.” “But if I do pick the patch—if I get through early enough—can I go?”
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Dirk	[MASK] turned sideways to look at her. It was as though he saw her for the first time. She looked brittle, hard, artificial—small, somehow. Not in physique but in personality. The picture was finished and delivered within ten days.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Selina	Wasted, [MASK] said as she touched them with a fond forefinger, when a girl would have been so glad of them. He had developed, too, a slightly aquiline nose, probably a long-jump inheritance from some Cromwellian rapscallion of the English Peakes of a past century.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Selina	He rarely showed temper. [MASK] often wished he would. Sometimes, in a sort of hysteria of hopelessness, she would rush at him, ruffle up his thick coarse hair, now beginning to be threaded with gray; shake his great impassive shoulders.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Pervus	Then a cascade of smothered giggles. [MASK] had been to town, evidently, for he now took from his coat pocket a bag containing half a dozen bananas—that delicacy of delicacies to the farm palate. She half peeled two and brought them in to the pigtails.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Selina	Usually he went home on Friday nights to stay until Monday morning. His first Monday-morning class was not until ten. [MASK] was deeply interested and stirred. “Do you think she’d spend some Saturday and Sunday here with us on the farm?
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Selina	[MASK] waited while he tended the horse. The night-watchman had been paid another twenty-five cents for watching the wagonload through the night as it stood in a row with the hundreds of others in the Haymarket. It was scarcely dawn when the trading began.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Pervus	Supper was over by six-thirty in the Pool household. [MASK] was there by seven, very clean as to shirt, his hair brushed till it shone; shy, and given to dropping his hat and bumping against chairs, and looking solemn.
<name>Eugene</name>	Eugene	Eugene”—he	But I bet my grandson [MASK] repeated it, stressing the name so that you sensed his dislike of it—“Eugene, if he comes into the business at all when he grows up, won’t go within smelling distance of the yards.
<name>Pa</name>	Pa	Roelf	“What else are you going to do when you grow up?” She waited, certain that he would say something delightful. “Drive the team to town alone to market.” “Oh, [MASK]!” “Sure.
<name>Chie</name>	Chie	Dirk	[MASK] was grateful. Her notes were always copious, perfect. She never hesitated to let him copy them. They got in the way of walking out of the classroom together, across the campus. She told him something of herself. “Your people farmers!”
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Selina	[MASK] abandoned the pink porker simile for that of a great Persian cat, full-fed and treacherous, its claws all sheathed in velvet. The widow stepped agilely into her own neat phaeton with its sleek horse and was off down the hard snowless road, her head high.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Dallas	“I’d rather,” [MASK] said, slowly, “plan one back door of a building that’s going to help make this town beautiful and significant than sell all the bonds that ever floated a—whatever it is that bonds are supposed to float.”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Selina	He should have gone to market to-day; would certainly have to go to-morrow, starting early in the afternoon so as to get a good stand in the Haymarket. By the light of his lantern the wagon seemed to [MASK] to be a symbol.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Dirk	“You will make a softy of him with your always babying.” So from time to time he undertook to harden [MASK]. The result was generally disastrous. In one case the process terminated in what was perilously near to tragedy. It was during the midsummer school vacation.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Selina	[MASK] began to remove the wrappings that swathed her—the muffler, the shawl, the cloak. Now she stood, a slim, incongruously elegant little figure in that kitchen. The brown lady’s-cloth was very tight and basqued above, very flounced and bustled below.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Dirk	You never knew whether you were going to meet the gamin of the rumpled smock and the smudged face or the beauty of the little fur jacket. Sometimes [MASK] thought she looked like a Swede hired girl with those high cheek bones of hers and her deep-set eyes and her large capable hands.
<name>Miss Furr</name>	Miss Furr	Dirk	These females of forty with straggling hair and a bundle of drawings under their arm. The female of forty with straggling hair and a bundle of drawings under her arm was announced at four-thirty to the dot. [MASK] let her wait five minutes in the outer office, being still a little annoyed.
<name>Aunt Dahlia</name>	Aunt Dahlia	Selina	“Yes, but how about hogs? Do you feel that way about hogs?” “Certainly!” said [MASK], briskly. She pushed toward him a little blue-and-white platter that lay on the white cloth near her elbow.
<name>Mrs. Harriet Pullman</name>	Mrs. Harriet Pullman	Selina	[MASK] was a member of the High Prairie school board now. She often drove about the roads and into town in a disreputable Ford which she manipulated with imagination and skill. She was on the Good Roads Committee and the Truck Farmers’ Association valued her opinion.
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Pervus	The old woman who tended the house for [MASK] slopped about all day with a pail and a wet gray rag. There was always a crazy campanile of dirty dishes stacked on the table, and the last meal seemed never to catch up with the next.
<name>Mrs. Vivian</name>	Mrs. Vivian	Dirk	“They’ve run away,” she explained to [MASK], “from the elaborate programme that was arranged for them this afternoon. I don’t know where the French got their reputation for being polite. The General is a perfect boor, aren’t you?
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Johnny	He had already given thirty millions to the university and still the insatiable maw of this institute of learning yawned for more. When oil went up a fraction of a cent they said, “Guess Coal-Oil [MASK]’s fixing to feed us another million.”
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Celeste	(Early influence of the _Fireside Companion_.) “What time is it, [MASK]?” “It is now eleven o’clock, madame.” “Is that all!” “Would madame like that I prepare her bath now, or later?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Roelf	[MASK] had placed the pail of hot water on the little wash-stand, and had lighted the glass lamp. He was intent on replacing the glass chimney within the four prongs that held it firm. Downstairs, in the crowded kitchen, he had seemed quite the man.
<name>her husband's name</name>	her husband's name	Dirk	Fear shook her. She told herself she was tired, nervous. That terrible week. And now this. The heat. Soon they’d be home, she and [MASK]. How cool and quiet the house would seem. The squares of the kitchen tablecloth.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Selina	“She is dead,” [MASK] would reply, politely and composedly. “Oh, my poor little dear!” Then, with a warm rush, “Don’t you want to come and play with my little girl? She loves little girls to play with.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Paula	On coming into the room he had gone immediately to the long mirror and had looked at himself carefully, searchingly, not knowing that [MASK], in her room, had done the same. He ran a hand over his close-shaved chin, looked at the fit of his dinner coat.
<name>Elsa</name>	Elsa	Selina	[MASK] was in a sort of panic now. She wanted to be out of the room. But the boy Roelf, with quiet swiftness, had taken a battered tin pail from its hook on the wall, had lifted an iron slab at the back of the kitchen stove.
<name>Mr. DeJong</name>	Mr. DeJong	Pervus	[MASK] had protested miserably, though the vegetables were spoiling in the ground. “Let them rot,” he said. “Better the stuff rots in the ground. DeJong women folks they never worked in the fields.
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Maartje	“But what’s in it?” she said again. Suddenly life in the kitchen hung suspended. The two men frowned. [MASK] half turned from her dishpan. The two little girls peered out from behind the stove.
<name>The Daimler</name>	The Daimler	Dirk	Its sides shone. Its steps glistened. [MASK], looking up at it, laughed outright. It seemed too splendid, too absurd. With a sudden boyish impulse he swung himself up the three steps that led to the box and perched himself on the fawn cushioned seat.
<name>Mammy</name>	Mammy	Selina	“How big is baby?” [MASK] would demand, senselessly. “How big is my man?” The child would momentarily cease to poke plump fingers into the rich black loam. He would smile a gummy though slightly weary smile and stretch wide his arms.
<name>James</name>	James	Dirk	He found excuses for himself. “Selling bonds that make that building possible isn’t so dull, either.” But she waved that aside almost contemptuously. “What nonsense, [MASK]. It’s like selling seats at the box office of a theatre for the play inside.”
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Selina	Violets, buttercups, mandrakes, marsh-marigolds, hepatica. The air was soft and cool from the lake. [MASK] had never known spring in the country before. It made her ache with an actual physical ache. She moved with a strange air of fatality.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Roelf	Together she and [MASK] used to pore over this fascinating periodical. Terraces, lily-pools, leaded casements, cretonne, fireplaces, yew trees, pergolas, fountains—they absorbed them all, exclaimed, admired, actually criticized.
<name>Abel</name>	Abel	Pervus	[MASK]’s market wagon was standing in the yard, shafts down. He should have gone to market to-day; would certainly have to go to-morrow, starting early in the afternoon so as to get a good stand in the Haymarket.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	G’wan	“Got any beans? No, don’t want no cauliflower. Beans!” “Tough!” “Well, keep ’em. I don’t want ’em.” “Quarter for the sack.” “[MASK], them ain’t five-pound heads.
<name>John</name>	John	Dirk	A thousand other thoughts might be racing through her mind during the day—plans for the farm, for the house—but always, over and above and through all these, like the steady beat of a drum penetrating sharper and more urgent sounds—was the thought of [MASK].
<name>mother</name>	mother	Selina	Aren’t you? My [MASK]. I’m driving out to see her this afternoon. She’s one of my reasons for being here. Why, I’m——” He was laughing, talking excitedly, like a boy.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Dirk	It’s like selling seats at the box office of a theatre for the play inside.” [MASK] had made many new friends in the last year and a half. More than that, he had acquired a new manner; an air of quiet authority, of assurance.
<name>Tracy</name>	Tracy	Updike	He talked little; looked at her dumbly, worshippingly. When he brought her a withered bunch of trilliums, the tears came to her eyes. He had walked to [MASK]’s woods to get them because he had heard her say she loved them, and there were none nearer.
<name>Abner</name>	Abner	Bouts	[MASK], he don’t even need deep ploughing. His land is quick land. It warms up in the spring early. After rain it works easy. He puts in fertilizer, any kind, and his plants jump, like. My place is bad for garden truck.
