<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Dorothy	And he told her that he had made up his mind to begin selling them off of the sidewalk and work his way up. Well, suddenly they heard everybody calling “[MASK]” in a loud tone of voice, because it was getting late for train time.
<name>Louise</name>	Louise	Dorothy	Well, when she reached the salon, it seems that [MASK] decided to do a dance of some new step she had learned in the Follies. I mean, nobody had even asked her, but strange to say, instead of everybody being annoyed, they were all delighted.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Dorothy	dollars and it seems it is not diamonds but it is a thing called “paste” which is the name of a word which means imitations. So [MASK] said “paste” is the name of the word a girl ought to do to a gentleman that handed her one.
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Dorothy	So then we saw a jewelry store and we saw some jewelry in the window and it really seemed to be a very very great bargain but the price marks all had francs on them and [MASK] and I do not seem to be mathematical enough to tell how much francs is in money.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Dorothy	And I began to become quite worried. But nothing could stop [MASK] and she went right on, and ordered steel engraved invitations from Cartiers and sent them out to not only everybody in the Social Register, but to all of her personal girl friends in the Follies besides.
<name>She</name>	She	Rudolf	and then he bought her a large size box of chocolates that were full of liqueurs, and took her to the matinee. So after the first act [MASK] got hungry and they had to go and stand in the lobby and gewTUMew <p(H£'Fen 'blo’nvcs 87 have some sandwitches and beer.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Henry	So [MASK]’s mother thinks I am nothing but sunshine and she will hardly let me get out of her sight, because she hates to be by herself because, when she is by herself, her brains hardly seem to work at all.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Dorothy	Well, the second thing the French lawyer told [MASK] to do, was to find an apartment to be her residents in a legal way. And he sent them to a French business partner friend of his who rented apartments. Well, the apartment they found belonged to a famous French actress.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Dorothy	Well, after they got past the third door, the butler started to lead them through quite a long, hollow hallway that had nothing to relieve it but some life size crockery baby elephants that only made [MASK] feel more unimpressive.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Dorothy	but [MASK] and I do not seem to be mathematical enough to tell how much francs is in money. ’ dollars and it seems it is not diamonds but it is a thing called “paste” which is the name of a word which means imitations.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Dorothy	So [MASK] and I were getting dressed and we were in our negligay as usual when there was quite a loud knock on the door and before we could even say come in he jumped right into the room. So it seems that he is of French extraction.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Lulu	I mean I really believe she could not care any more for me if she was light and not colored. [MASK] has had a very sad life because when she was quite young a pullman porter fell madly in love with her.
<name>Phileas</name>	Phileas	Dorothy	But they learned that he was on a trip around the world with no forwarding adress. Well, the only thing for them to do, was to hunt up a French lawyer themselves, to get [MASK] a divorce.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Charlie	I mean, he is the kind of a gentleman who has never done anything in his life, either one way or another. And the Breene family were always holding him up to [MASK] as an example of what he could keep from doing if he would only concentrate his mind on it.
<name>Mr. Gatsby</name>	Mr. Gatsby	Lester	Because [MASK] began to wonder what good all that money was, when he was watched like a hawk, and was not allowed to entertain socially without a third party in the shape of a detecktive looking on. So he began to get nervous.
<name>Napoleon</name>	Napoleon	Soloman	And he gave me his uncle’s Masonic ring, which came down from the time of [MASK] and which he never even lets his wife wear, for our engagement ring, and this afternoon a lady friend of his is going to bring me a new system she thought up of how to learn French.
<name>Louise</name>	Louise	Dorothy	Well, when [MASK] came down for dinner, she seemed to note that she was the center of regard. So she says she gave them all a large “dirty” look for being so rude as to stare at a girl merely because she is well dressed.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Henry	I mean I do not mind boyish models on girls, if *[MASK]’s sister and I have practically nothing in common. * ‘BUT g£‘NTL£M£'N M3‘R!RT (B‘RU‘N£TT£S 133 they copy some well groomed fashion plate, like “What the Young Man will Wear,” for instants.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Charlie	And he never knew that it was only so that she and a saxaphone player could gaze at one another. But [MASK] is such a sweet boy that he hardly ever seems to notice what is going on, even when he is not drinking.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Dorothy	I mean I would really be embarrassed, but the gentleman did not seem to understand [MASK]’s english. So it really makes a girl feel depressed to think a girl could not tell that it was nothing but an imitation.
<name>Plato</name>	Plato	Claude	But there was not enough Sacrafishal wine to go around, so they put it in a bowl and added some gin they had. And they all had another drink, in the spirit of Sacrafice. Well, then [MASK] started to give them another talk about his Philosaphy.
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Dorothy	But from the time that the Deputy Sherif came back from his spin, he really was quite changed in his attitude toward [MASK]. I mean, he behaved as if he had some great mental strain on his mind and all his good cheer had practically vanished.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Dorothy	So then he stopped squealing and he put it in his pocket, but then he got out quite a large size handkerchief with purple elefants on it and he started in to cry. So [MASK] really got discouraged and she said.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Dorothy	So I told him in my letter that I had to leave in five minute’s time because I found out that [MASK] was just on the verge of getting very unreformed, and if I did not get her away, all I had done for her would really go for nothing.
<name>Mr. Mayer</name>	Mr. Mayer	Henry	And it has really been a very, very great success, because there is not much work going on at the other studios at present so all of the extra girls have nothing better to do and they all know that [MASK] will not give them a job at our studio unless they belong.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Lulu	So she said she showed him the pearls and she said that after I had bought them, I was sorry I did not get pink ones because white ones were so common, so I was going to have [MASK] unstring them and sew them on a negligay.
<name>Jay Gatsby</name>	Jay Gatsby	Dorothy	and I went down to the Grand Central Station to meet [MASK]'s Father. And he got off of the train with four valises that it took two “red caps’* apiece to even lift off the side walk, on account of the heavy pacific gravity of the liquor that was practically all they contained.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Americans	And it was all furnished in the French period of decoration. I mean, wherever we [MASK] would have a chair, this French actress would have a couch. And wherever we would have a couch, she would have a large size double bed.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Dorothy	Because when the room clerck notes that a girl with a maiden name is in the same room with a gentleman, it starts quite a little explanation, and makes a girl feel quite promanent before everybody in the lobby. But [MASK] said I had better be careful.
<name>Chatty Cathy</name>	Chatty Cathy	Gerry	So it really made me feel quite depressed. I mean [MASK] likes to talk quite a lot and I always think a lot of talk is depressing and worries your brains with things you never even think of when you are busy.
<name>Ellie</name>	Ellie	Emma	Because the Deputy Sherif loved nothing so much as giving imoral girls a new start, and keeping in touch with their cases. But [MASK] said that some day he was going to keep in touch with her case just once to often!
<name>the victim</name>	the victim	Claude	Well, then the instigater of the whole thing spoke up, in quite a pointed way, and asked, “How about that time he hit you with a hair brush?” So then [MASK] spoke up and said, “It was not a hair brush.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Fanny	Because I and [MASK] have known each other for about five years but I really feel as if I knew her better because mama knew her 45 years ago when she and mama used to go to school together and mama used to always follow all her weddings in all the newspapers.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Dorothy	So [MASK] said for me to take one of the things called a one million kronens and she would uke one of them called a one million kronens and I would give him mine first and if he gave me quite a dirty look, she would give him hers.
<name>Aunt Augusta</name>	Aunt Augusta	Henry	So I sat in my drawing room on the train and I decided that the time had come to get rid of [MASK] at any cost. So I decided that the thing that discouradges gentlemen more than anything else is shopping.
<name>Harpo</name>	Harpo	Dorothy	Because [MASK] always seems to want to make a broker laugh, which is fatal in itself. I mean the only time that brokers really want to laugh, is at a show, or when they are telling each other riskay stories on the stock exchange.
<name>he</name>	he	Piggie	So [MASK] became quite intreeged. So we looked at all the silver picture frames. But then I told him that I really did not think a silver picture frame was good enough for a picture of him because I forgot that they had gold picture frames until I saw them.
<name>me</name>	me	Dorothy	I mean she took [MASK] and I into the back parlor and tried to sell us some shell flowers she seems to make out of sea shells for 25 pounds. So we asked her how much it was in money and it seems it is 125 dollars.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Dorothy	And when they put the “Little Mouse” in my arms that afternoon, I felt repayed for giving up everything. But I called up [MASK] at the tea party to break her the news that it turned out to be a boy.
<name>Dorothy</name>	Dorothy	Dorothy	But [MASK]’s poverty always seems to consist in not worrying about bills, so she went right on, as usual, spending most of her time in the lobby of the Algonquin hotel, becoming more and more of a chum to the elevater boy.
<name>Henry James</name>	Henry James	Tony	It really seems that the more I see of everybody, the more I realize that you never know who you are talking to. Because [MASK] told me that a man's body may only be a Greek waiter, but his soul may be full of all of the culture of the antient Greeks themselves.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Henry	So I finally got dressed and she threw the empty box away and I helped her down stairs to the Dining room. So [MASK] was waiting in the dining room with his sister and that was when I met his sister.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Piggie	So I wanted to cheer [MASK] up so I told him that I did not think the lady saw us and if she did see us, she really could not believe her eyes to see him in a jewelery store.
<name>John</name>	John	Henry	I mean, in the first place I am full of ambitions and I think that practically every married girl ought to have a career if she is wealthy enough to have the home life carried on by the servants. Especially if a girl is married to a husband like [MASK].
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Dorothy	And [MASK] became quite an expert, so she would mix up with the crowd and throw some rings and be the One that won the knife. And then she would go around and give the knife back to the gentleman that ran the knife game. ”
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Gerry	He is a sweet boy but he never gets anywhere and I am not going to waste my time on such as him, after meeting a gentleman like [MASK]. Sftpril 2nd: I seem to be quite depressed this morning as I always am when there is nothing to put my mind to.
<name>she</name>	she	Dorothy	Well, [MASK] lost all her endurants and gave him a slap. And to say that he was out-raged would put it quite mildly. But finally all of “The French policemen were very polite and wanted to help one of we Americans in distress. ”
<name>Abdul</name>	Abdul	Fred	I mean they really had their pictures in all the newspapers and everybody was talking about them. So my steward, whose real name is [MASK], was very very proud to be in the same cell with such famous burglars.
<name>John</name>	John	Henry	I mean, [MASK] is quite broad minded like all great Reformers have to be in order to look at both sides of the same thing at once. And he really does not mind what a girl has been through, as long as she does not enjoy herself at the finish.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Henry	and she has always really felt that she could do it better. So I do not discouradge her, but I let her go ahead and enjoy herself. But I am not going to bother to speak to the electricians about [MASK]’s mother.
<name>he</name>	he	Charlie	And if they except presents from her in adition, her admiration is complete. But [MASK] took the wrong way to her heart and showered her with orchids, and delightful love notes, always writing something poetic like, “Oh, you wonderful girl,* for instants.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Henry	Well after it was all over, of course [MASK] wanted me to stay at 'but gemumw 9Aa%%y (B%urNeTTes 137 home and be nothing else but a Wife and Mother. And I really did not mind so long as I had to stay in bed anyway.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Henry	And I told him that if he thought that every string of white beads were pearls, it was no wonder he could make such a mistake in judging the character of a girl. So then I began to cry because of all of [MASK]’s lack of faith.
<name>Robert Cohn</name>	Robert Cohn	Henry	But 1 called out to him to go to his Hotel and I would telephone the result as soon as the train arrived. So then I went through the train, and there was [MASK] with a look on his face which I shall never forget.
<name>her</name>	her	Lulu	So she finally found out that she had been deceived and she really was broken hearted and when she tried to go back home she found out that it was to late because her best girl friend, who she had always trusted, had stolen her husband and he would not take [MASK] back.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Dorothy	[MASK] is up on the deck wasting quite a lot of time with a gentleman who is only a tennis champion. So I am going to ring for the steward and have some champagne which is quite good for a person on a boat.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Dorothy	9Aay 17th: So now we are on an oriental express and everything seems to be quite unusual. I mean [MASK] and I got up this morning and we looked out of the window of our compartment and it was really quite unusual.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Gloria	For [MASK] was very, very ashamed to think that an American girl would slap a French gentleman. I mean, it is things like that that give we Americans the reputation among the French of not having any manners.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Dorothy	And then he told [MASK] that she would probably turn out to be an Artist herself, as soon as she got her temprament developed and found out about Life. And he said that he himself would be willing to teach her about Life and give her all his ade.
<name>Dick</name>	Dick	Piggie	and I told him he would have to look out because he was really so good looking and I was so full of impulses that I might even lose my mind some time and give him a kiss. So [MASK] really felt very very good to be such a good looking gentleman.
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Claude	So they did not break down, but they all bore up, and then [MASK] brought out a bottle of very very rare old wine, and said that they were all to drink, in the spirit of Sacrafice.
<name>Amory</name>	Amory	Dorothy	But his brain still retained the ideas of a street car conducter, and although he constantly conversed, he really said so little that [MASK] would finally have to tell him to save his breath for his saxaphone. And then words would pass between them.
<name>he</name>	he	Charlie	And when she got her there, she would be very, very sweet, and draw her out in conversation about Literature, and Music and Art, so that [MASK] could see how well she would fit into such a cultured envirament.
<name>Franklin</name>	Franklin	Gerry	April ist: I am taking special pains with my diary from now on as I am really writing it for [MASK]. I mean he and I are going to read it together some evening in front of the fireplace.
<name>Dr. John Watson</name>	Dr. John Watson	Gerry	I mean he always wants me to have food which is what he calls “nourishing,” which most gentlemen never seem to think about. So then we took a hansom cab and drove for hours around the park because [MASK] said the air would be good for me.
<name>he</name>	he	Piggie	But I really wish [MASK] would not tell so many storys. I mean I do not mind a gentleman when he tells a great many storys if they are new, but a gentleman who tells a great many storys and they are all the same storys is quite enervating.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Dorothy	So after the performance when they envited her to accompany them to a champagne supper, she gave them the slip to go out with the property man. And [MASK] says that running out on millionaires has been her specialty ever since.
<name>Prince</name>	Prince	Piggie	And now I must get ready to see [MASK] because he and I seem to be getting to be quite good friends even if he has not sent me any flowers yet. SQpril 19th: Last night we really met the Prince of Wales.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Dorothy	But [MASK] really did not pick up either Truth or Honesty, for the very first day in school she got into trouble, because a girl who sat in front of her asked her for the loan of a led pencil.
<name>he</name>	he	Claude	Well, it was quite a few moments before [MASK] could believe his own ears. But when he finally found his tongue, he spoke up and said, “I resent this!* So then quite a few resented it, and it really began to look like trouble.
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Gerry	March 31st: Last night [MASK] and I had dinner at quite a quaint place where we had roast beef and baked potato. I mean he always wants me to have food which is what he calls “nourishing,” which most gentlemen never seem to think about.
<name>myself</name>	myself	Henry	And so I gave [MASK] a supscription to the Book of the Month Club that tells you the book you have to read every month to make your individuality stand out. And it really is remarkable, because it makes over 50,000 people read the same book every month.
<name>Mme. Loisel</name>	Mme. Loisel	Dorothy	So [MASK] got her pocket book and she gave him 2y francs. So then he stopped squealing and he put it in his pocket, but then he got out quite a large size handkerchief with purple elefants on it and he started in to cry.
<name>Maître d'</name>	Maître d'	George	For they also have a more unexclusive dining room for the benefit of the masses. Well, I told [MASK] that we wished to sit near the famous literary Round-Table, where we could overhear them say something, or other.
<name>Lulu</name>	Lulu	Goldmark	[MASK] thought that she was only using business methods, so he offered her more. But she refused. So then he offered her more, in franks, than all the tips she would receive for all of her natural life.
<name>D.W. Griffith</name>	D.W. Griffith	Henry	But when they wrote the scenario we had quite a little trouble, because the scenario writer wanted it to be full of nothing but “Psychology." And the director wanted it to be full of mob scenes and ornamental sets. And [MASK] wanted it to be full of a great moral lesson.
<name>the caterer</name>	the caterer	Reubens	I mean people kept coming in, and coming in, and I had to keep telephoning to [MASK] to send over more sandwiches. But the nurse would only give us a small glimps of the “Little Mouse,” because noise and cigarette smoke are not good for little babies the day of their arrival.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Claude	“And now,” spoke up the instigater, “you have got to have seven years of misfortune!" Well, [MASK] really had to admit that it was no gesture to make with a mirror, at a person who was superstitious in the first place.
<name>her</name>	her	Dorothy	and then he had to hurry to their country estate, to see his father, who was very, very low with pnewmonia. But he apologized to [MASK], and told her he would be back at ten o’clock in the evening, to escort her to the party he was giving in her honor.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Dorothy	Well, [MASK] did not even have to bother to run away from home. Because the Deputy Sherif convalessed, but his spirits never came back, and he obeyed everything his bleach blonde Secretary told him to the letter.
<name>Robber</name>	Robber	Dorothy	So [MASK] and 1 have quite a lot of delightful hand bags and stockings and handkerchiefs and scarfs and things and some quite cute models of evening gowns that are all covered with imitations “So then Robber started in to squeal once more. ”
<name>Winnie-the-Pooh</name>	Winnie-the-Pooh	Tony	But [MASK] is different, and he listens with all his ears, and he hears even more than the geniuses do themselves, because they are so busy thinking up some cute remark to make next, that they never have time to do any listening.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Dorothy	For he had his Mother escort her to a very exclusive school, for girls only, where she could get educated up to what she was going to become.

<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Claude	But finally [MASK] found his tongue and spoke up, and said, “What do you mean—I make you sick?” Well, then this guest took another large drink, and started in to tell what he really thought about the deseased, in no plain terms.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Dorothy	Because [MASK] is the kind of a girl that makes gentlemen presents. But I really try not to blame her, because I have a very broad mind, and I always use Psychology, so I understand that there are some people in the world who cannot help it if their in-stincks are unnatural.
<name>me</name>	me	Dorothy	So then his papa talked quite a lot and then he pointed at I and [MASK]. So then his son looked at us and then his son let out quite a large size squeal, and he said in French “May papa, elles sont sharmant.”
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Dorothy	So then [MASK] got to talking with a young gentleman who seemed to be a German gentleman who sat back of her, who she thought was applauding. But what he was really doing was he was cracking a hard boiled egg on the back of her chair.
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	Dorothy	And then the polo team began to sit up and take an interest in the drama. Well, their enthusiasm for [MASK] rose by leaps and bounds, and by the time she made her exit they would not even let the performance preceed.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Robber	and I had had about all we could stand, I told them all about it. I mean I really felt sorry for [MASK] so I told him not to cry any more because it was nothing but paste after all. So then I showed it to them.
<name>the woman</name>	the woman	Dorothy	But finally all of “The French policemen were very polite and wanted to help one of we Americans in distress. ” . —»fcj his manhood came to his assistance, and he hit [MASK] in the jaw and knocked her down.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Henry	But [MASK] says that that is just the trouble, because some girl is always winning his father over, and they hardly dare to let him go out of their sight, and they hardly dare let him go to church alone.
<name>Estelle</name>	Estelle	Dorothy	and I put on quite a simple little organdy gown that I had ripped all of the trimming off of, and I had a pair of black lace mitts that [MASK] used to wear in the Follies and I had a pair of shoes that did not have any heels on them.
<name>David</name>	David	Dorothy	Well, he came over to the table shaking quite a lot. And he was so upset at seeing [MASK] at last, that he practically broke down. And it always makes me feel so sentamental to watch a gentleman break down, that I almost believe my eyes became moist.
<name>Lady Bracknell</name>	Lady Bracknell	Dorothy	Because he spent all of his time telling her that she was wonderful, and that he was nothing at all. And [MASK] prefers gentlemen who think that nothing is ideal except themselves, and let her know it. And if they except presents from her in adition, her admiration is complete.
<name>Mrs. Hopewell</name>	Mrs. Hopewell	Dorothy	And [MASK] said that the way he went on about a "Mother’’ would have made an Irish tenor sound like an ungrateful son. And it turned out that the whole Carnaval Company were more than delighted with her, because nothing touches the heart of a Carnaval Company like somebody’s Mother.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Leon	Because French gentlemen are very very gallant, but I really do not think a girl can trust one of them around a corner. So, when I get a chance, I am going to ask [MASK] what they said.
<name>Os-mer</name>	Os-mer	Claude	But while he was giving it, an Art dancer called Os-mer came in with a bottle of absente, so they decided to put that in the bowl and try it. And after they tried it, [MASK] wanted to go on with his talk.
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Dorothy	But, much to her surprise, it shocked the girls very much to make light of such a subjeck. So 'BUT gemLEMCN MA'R.'RJ 'B%U’M7T£S 171 they reported [MASK] to the teacher for removing the bloom off of things that young girls ought not to mention.
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Dorothy	But I almost have to shudder when I think of poor [MASK] starting out all alone for a large size city full of cuter girls than she was, with less than $1000 in her pocket and practically the wrong ideas about everything.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Dorothy	And I think that when literary people wish to hold a musical evening, it is more artistic to buy tickets to some good opera. But I should have known enough to have my doubts about the literature of any lit- erary gentlemen who have friendships with an unmental girl like [MASK].
