<name>Marisol</name>	Marisol	Mimi	“[MASK] is babysitting now,” she cried out from the kitchen, as if catching my thoughts. “Very lucrative, she says. Better than hiding in the room all day and praying to the Virgin.”
<name>Kavita</name>	Kavita	Rameeza	I wondered where [MASK] was. Was she all alone in the company of the muscle-bound kabbadi man? I had a sudden urge to push out through the huge crowd and find her. But the next speaker was on the stage, tall and thin, her lean body covered in a black sari.
<name>Amma</name>	Amma	Ramu	I knew her a little. From time to time she mended my chappals. [MASK] did not slow down at all, and I was coughing and gasping for breath before we reached the open space where the Gowliguda police station stood.
<name>Jessie</name>	Jessie	Ramu	Down below the bicycle boys were giggling over a film magazine. Their heads were polished, almost metallic in the street lights that shone down on them. “I’m sure she’s there.” “But why, [MASK], why would they keep her there?
<name>Nurse</name>	Nurse	Durgabai	Once after her day’s work [MASK] told me her story. It was one of those days when she had been up for forty-eight hours at a stretch. She was almost sixty, but she still persisted without sleep. “Dysentery cases, child.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Chandrika	[MASK] leaned forward and announced in a clear, loud voice that for her study group she was doing an analysis of the Limca film clip. in a longed-for myth. We forgot thepeefing~theater, “He’s making myth of himself You know that, don’t you?”
<name>Kamala</name>	Kamala	Rameeza	His logic was taking us away from the only world we have, the very world of us all. If the struggle for justice was illusion, what were we? Was [MASK] nothing? Was her suffering to be emptied out, all of it relegated to mere avidya?
<name>Rukmini</name>	Rukmini	Mira	I could tell by the flush on her face. But she kept quiet. The old swamiji was not put out. If anything he seemed kinder than before. “I told you, [MASK]. Here, come and sit down.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Ramu	The stench of urine was intense at the foot of the stairs. We hurried out. Directly ahead of us the college lay utterly dark. There was no one we knew in sight. ☆ ☆ ☆ That night I decided to stay with [MASK] in his hotel room.
<name>Dr. Aziz</name>	Dr. Aziz	Savitribai	Over and over in my mind I had pondered that meeting, those great eyes blackened with despair, with incomprehension. “It was a son, almost born dead. The cord was noosed around its throat. It was the most difficult labor [MASK] had seen.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Ramu	Rewards were offered for the capture of suspicious people. The radio broadcast was worrisome. The official word was out, and soon the streets would be filled with plainclothesmen. When [MASK] arrived a few hours later looking worn out and sleepless, I was so relieved.
<name>Antoine</name>	Antoine	Bakshi	Is there any connection at all?” [MASK] was stirring in his seat. He started to roll up his shirt sleeves in a slow, lazy fashion. “Or is there a world, indeed, apart from our seeing it?” I stopped short.
<name>Conch</name>	Conch	Ramu	He’s an island now. We race around him and leave him where he is. When he’s picked up it’s to embellish our own tales.” [MASK]’s voice took on another edge. He was mimicking a child in school, then the schoolmistress.
<name>Babita</name>	Babita	Mumu	[MASK] was still best known for her role several decades ago as a hennaed dancing girl in the “Typewriter tick-tick-tick-tick” song-and-dance routine, where skimpily clad she danced on the giant keys of a make-believe typewriter.
<name>Gandhi</name>	Gandhi	Gandhi	The pedestal and the surrounding high platforms were all fixed. The stage was painted in the colors of the flag, green, white, and orange. There was a tall palm tree and a model of the charka. Someone had wheeled in a giant cutout of [MASK].
<name>Elise</name>	Elise	Vanessa	Often he lost himself for hours in his playing, and the fact that his grant was running out did not deter him in the slightest. He’d met [MASK] at a local concert he’d given and she had clung to him ever since.
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Ramu	There was a small girl not far from where I sat. She was just in front of [MASK], her feet crossed neatly on the matting. I saw her fist raised with everyone else’s. But when she turned for an instant I saw the milky whiteness of her pupils.
<name>Ravi</name>	Ravi	Rani	I had to repeat myself over and over. There were chaotic sounds in the kitchen, the ungoverned clatter of pots and ladles, a tinny sound as if a knife were scraped against a stainless-steel dish. “[MASK], the swamiji is here.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Rameeza	It was an unusual time but with a daughter-in-law about to give birth she was worried about making it in the next morning. Hearing a commotion she had hidden behind a gooseberry bush a little to the right of the main entrance. She had watched as [MASK] was dragged up the steps.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Rosamma	She might have been [MASK]’s sister. She had the same proud bearing, the same set to her shoulders. She was young, very young, though. She was the last to climb in. Her blouse was half open. She knotted it at the waist.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Bakshi	I had smiled in a tight, embarrassed fashion, though I was pleased too. Now the young woman was staring at me. Next to her was [MASK], cocksure, his cloth cap thrust back on his head. “Theme of lecture, madam?”
<name>Swamiji</name>	Swamiji	Rani	I could tell that a visit from the swamiji pleased her. [MASK] was known to have metaphysical urges, and one of the swami’s sermons had helped her a great deal. As I called out for her, I could almost hear her voice in my ear explaining the effect of his words.
<name>Bao-yu</name>	Bao-yu	Rani	Her body was drenched in sweat. The lamplight shone into her hair as it lay tangled on the pillow, a great mass of darkness shot through with silver. The length of jasmine rope [MASK] had given her that morning lay suppurating, petals sickly with sweat.
<name>Ali Akbar Khan</name>	Ali Akbar Khan	Siddharth	It was not his intelligence that was in doubt, rather his application. For each morning on waking, [MASK] sat cross-legged at his sarod, positioned its brown globe against his bare feet, and started tuning the ivory-colored strings.
<name>Briony</name>	Briony	Durgabai	I could sniff their hot scent from where I stood. I led the old man into the drawing room. I was weary from a day’s teaching. [MASK] was nowhere to be seen and I could not leave him alone, half deaf brooding.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Saab	I set a little of the beer to my mouth. It tasted flat, salty—Golconda beer. But he was angry now and ignored the bartender who came out with a filthy bit of paper on which he had scribbled the bill. “OK, [MASK]. OK?
<name>Rikki</name>	Rikki	Ramu	Where had I seen that face before? In a dream? I thought I heard a creature snapping behind us. “It’s only a mongoose,” [MASK] reassured me. The man pulled us into a doorway. He had to stoop almost double to enter.
<name>Indira</name>	Indira	Maitreyi	I felt the grandeur of his vision. But I could not see where it could lead. I saw the old woman again, [MASK], in her crumpled blue sari, hunched before the microphone, then her body shrinking into the great crowd.
<name>Maya</name>	Maya	Rani	Listening to him I felt just like the white-winged swan painted on the street wall of the ashram. I could have kissed his tiny foot. He was so good, better even than a swamiji in a movie!” [MASK] fed herself a heavy diet of movies.
<name>Emmett</name>	Emmett	Rameeza	By the time the hundreds of reserve police and the gangs of Ever Ready men arrived on the scene, there was nothing much to do except watch the police station burn. [MASK] had been carried away to a safe house, and most of the people had dispersed.
<name>Danny</name>	Danny	Ramu	She looked at me quizzically. “[MASK] was just here looking for you. He was covered in oil and blood.” That’s all she said. She asked no questions. Tears flowed out of my eyes. So he was still alive.
<name>Leighton</name>	Leighton	Siddharth	I pointed out the bold orange lettering that ran across the bottom, “On India Government Service.” “I’m legit now!” I sang to [MASK], a brilliant, shy lad, a few years older than me.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Ramu	We live with turmoil and disturbance, with the abuse of law. But as a young man he knew a little about that too. Let me tell you.” I never finished the remark. [MASK] ran in through the door. His face shone with sweat.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Siddharth	Though [MASK] had hinted at her professional life, he had given me no details, and I was amazed that she worked as hard as she did. She was obstetrician, gynecologist, and pediatrician all rolled into one. On some days her job was to deliver babies.
<name>him</name>	him	Ramu	I wanted to melt into [MASK], to curl up with him forever and ever in a nest of skin and bone. I wanted to draw him into me, and have us born again and again, in one life after the next, holding each other.
<name>Aunt Polly</name>	Aunt Polly	Siddharth	[MASK] had already written to her saying I’d be arriving. She drew me into the living room, delighted that I had come with news of her eldest son. “Of course you must live here, child,” she insisted.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Ramu	In less than a minute or two he was out again, and behind him were two policemen arguing noisily. [MASK] shouted something at them, waved his arm, and headed back toward the road. He did not want the policemen to see me.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Chandrika	Some have plastic rims, some metal rims, some bone rims. The lenses are all kinds of colors, pink, purple, blue, green, gray. See how we can transform the world?” I smiled, relaxing a little. I noticed that [MASK] was frowning at my humor.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Maitreyi	Sometimes one has to speak, lest the space be filled with falsity. “[MASK] has a very sick woman with her. Perhaps she thought you could help her. I think she’s a rape victim.” “Why didn’t she bring her to me child.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Vbu	[MASK] know that don’t you? Unsuitable family, a slight history of madness there. But the girl would have nothing but marriage with this man. How fierce she was. I can see her standing in this courtyard arguing with her mother.
<name>you</name>	you	Raniamma	She drew me into the living room, delighted that I had come with news of her eldest son. “Of course you must live here, child,” she insisted. “Look at this great house all empty now except for me and [MASK].
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Vbu	Perhaps she thought you could help her. I think she’s a rape victim.” “Why didn’t she bring her to me child. Of course I’ll help her. '[MASK] know me. Why should she fear?”
<name>science</name>	science	Limca	Was she right? Was there some link I had missed between [MASK] and the kinds of poetry I loved? I dismissed the thought. I would start from where I was. I would say what I) wanted to say, and they would listen me out.
<name>Yog-Sothoth</name>	Yog-Sothoth	Advaita	He was fond too of the old man. From time to time they had had long debates concerning the ontological status of the disparate body sheaths proposed by [MASK] or, in a somewhat different but not wholly unrelated vein, the nature of true dialectical materialism.
<name>Judas</name>	Judas	Laura	There was gold foil set behind the dark neck of the Virgin. As if in supplication to some unseen god, her fingertips were folded under her pointed chin. The paint had smeared over the nails so that they resembled [MASK]’s own well-stained ones.
<name>Max</name>	Max	Isaac	Most of the space on the poster was taken up by a triangle made of blocks of irregular shapes latched together. The whole thing was printed in black, and near the top left-hand side was the image of a small boy, [MASK], clutching a rock for dear life.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Durgabai	[MASK] was as weak as a baby, and I spent a great deal of time with her indoors. The uncertainty in the air invaded me. I seemed to myself to be a small stick insect suspended on a surface of clear ice, ignorant of whether what held me up might melt.
<name>Civil Rights</name>	Civil Rights	Quitjndia	I tell you the old lady was worth her salt. Sat in her armchair, under an umbrella, taking it all in, not flinching. Recognized a bit of herself in the girl, I think. It was the height of the [MASK] movement.
<name>unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Mira	But the Gowliguda affair is more urgent still. We have to rush to the police station now or else they’ll finish her off She’s half dead as it is. She’s a witness, [MASK]. She can tell us what really happened.”
<name>Amjad</name>	Amjad	Siddharth	Each morning after playing his sarod, [MASK] used to go to take darshan. It hardly fazed him when the child-guru was caught by the Indian customs service and charged with smuggling in watches and minute electronic parts used to create instant vihbuti in his oversize waistcoat.
<name>my brother</name>	my brother	Ramu	Please read ‘Tintem Abbey’ over again.” Then I ran along the balcony with [MASK]. The leaves of the neem trees that grew in the garden were level with our faces. I saw the small hairs on his forearms.
<name>Little Mother</name>	Little Mother	Laura	Better than hiding in the room all day and praying to the Virgin.” In my hurry to get back to Little Mother’s with the katori full of precious dahi I tripped over a rug and [MASK] had to rush forward on her high heels to steady me.
<name>him</name>	him	Siddharth	So I said nothing and let [MASK] continue. “In any case you won’t miss the peepul tree. Just behind it is an immense iron gate. The gate is cut into three parts. Three sections swing open depending on the size of the traffic.
<name>the Chief Minister</name>	the Chief Minister	Limca	Did everyone know that the Chief Minister was planning a huge birthday celebration, complete with a cardboard city, replica of the ancient inner city? Did everyone know that [MASK]’s birthplace in the city was to be picked out in red lights in the cardboard replica?
<name>an aristocrat</name>	an aristocrat	Nehru	To the right was a portrait of [MASK], erect, handsome, his cap pointed, polished on his head. His teeth gleamed in the photograph, clearly brushed each morning, an aristocrat lacking a phone line with the future. Her sari was stiff with blood.
<name>Swami Prabhavananda</name>	Swami Prabhavananda	Rani	Offering tea and biscuits, sitting at the old man’s feet and drawing him out. I felt the swami was in good hands. He could defend himself if need be. In any case he had known [MASK] a long time. Twenty-five years.
<name>Leela</name>	Leela	\bu	I could see that she had added turmeric and a dash of salt, the simplest possible accompaniment for a meal. “[MASK] found me out then?” Her voice cut me to the quick. I felt ashamed for having followed her. “No need to explain.
<name>William James</name>	William James	Wordsworth	“The use of‘the picture of the mind,’ as he calls it so elegantly, is that it clarifies the world. Our world even. And [MASK] is quite truthful about doubts and dismays, the slow workings of consciousness.”
<name>Gopal</name>	Gopal	Amma	We hurried to cross by the Gandhi statue. There was a slight break in the traffic. As we raced, I heard the voice of the blind beggar behind us. He seemed to be running too. “[MASK], paise do,” he called.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Vanessa	“About us you mean?” [MASK] lisped. “Well that too.” “Promise!” He was pleased then and drew me down to look at the map he was drawing on a folded sheet of paper torn from an old calendar.
<name>Edmund</name>	Edmund	Mira	He seemed a little nervous now, as if the act of drawing the map had drawn him closer to his own home and all the expectations lodged there. After all, he was the eldest son and his father had long been dead. “You won’t get lost, will you, [MASK]?
<name>Emmeline</name>	Emmeline	Rosamma	Her face was cut with lines. She was introduced as [MASK] from the hill country. She led the great cry that swept the room: “Overcome oppression, down with chains.” She spoke of knives and bombs, of a great cleansing that was necessary.
<name>he</name>	he	Ramu	“What business has [MASK] with her? How extraordinary. You know,” she was addressing the swamiji now, “they tell me she keeps snakes.” Gesturing to the swamiji to sit down, she pulled up the chair she had used the night before, and set it by the window.
<name>dictator</name>	dictator	Limca	Still it was one country, and the ironfisted lady provided a clear model for [MASK]. She in turn saw in him an ally she might well manipulate to consolidate her own rule. The notion of unquestioned power vested in a single man pleased him enormously.
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Ramu	I wanted to be finished with my speech. I wanted to sit close to him, saying nothing, nothing at all. “[MASK], I’m here, that’s all there is to it. Can’t you accept that? I too am part of it all.
<name>him</name>	him	Ramu	If we had been born into another lifetime, all this might have been like paradise. I couldn’t resist a feeling of pleasure as I sat by him. Sometimes I felt I wanted to live with [MASK] and have children and all that.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Ramu	“[MASK] told me something about it. I stopped the car on my way home. I passed by the cafe, you know. I saw him there. The road looked bad.” I could see she was trying to help me on.
<name>lamp</name>	lamp	Rani	Fireflies circled the tulasi bush. They made tiny sparks of light, a nocturnal version of the flame [MASK] lit each morning by the stone pedestal where the bush grew, part of her daily ritual. In the stillness I could smell the musk from the rose flesh.
<name>her</name>	her	Ramu	The roses in her plastic bucket were pocks of sheer color, pink and yellow and a stale, burnt white. I wished I could sit closer to [MASK]. Behind us was the clatter of tin spoons and plates. Suddenly platefuls of steaming idlis were thrust forward.
<name>Mrs. Watts</name>	Mrs. Watts	Aai	“ ‘The times are changing, [MASK],’ I can hear her say. ‘A hot wind will blow.’ I tell you the old lady was worth her salt. Sat in her armchair, under an umbrella, taking it all in, not flinching.
<name>Dev</name>	Dev	Ramu	[MASK] went in to take a shower. When he came back he had a lungi wrapped around him. His body was wet with the shower water. We sat together at the edge of the narrow metal bed and looked out over the balcony. It was growing dark.
<name>James</name>	James	Laura	[MASK]? Myself?” “Shh-shh.” He held his fingers to his lips. The men at the next table were listening. “Be warned,” he whispered. There was an odd quality to his voice almost as if he wished the whole world to hear.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Durgabai	Sometimes they passed [MASK] in the street or on the steps of a grocery store, or at a rich man’s wedding. Each time they felt a slight unease. She in turn was troubled by their “show,” as she called it.
<name>Nietzsche</name>	Nietzsche	Chandrika	I had to keep them listening. “Of course, [MASK], you would argue that was foolish, no? Even a pernicious question? Of course the world exists. The question is, how does it form us? How does history make us?”
<name>Bheem</name>	Bheem	Ramu	Someone peered out from behind a wall. Then a figure appeared, waving at [MASK]. It was the great-chested muscleman, the kabbadi master I had glimpsed at the police station. He sported a huge mustache, and a red bandana was wrapped around his head.
<name>Liesel</name>	Liesel	Ramu	Her hair had been cut short by the old woman. I think there had been too much blood and dirt caught in it. [MASK] told me later that her hair had been singed by the fire in the police station and the ends were still smouldering when she was lifted to safety.
<name>Ali</name>	Ali	Ramu	The barber flung his windows open, the bicycle boys giggled at the apothecary, schoolchildren tossed orange pips in the air. I could see a kite in a brilliant saffron color flying over the tamarind trees in the abandoned graveyard. I saw it catch [MASK]’s eye.
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Laura	[MASK] was terribly thin, and her habit of dressing in black lace for those infrequent visits to holy places, brought out her pallor all the more, made her bones stick out, until her very body seemed an insult to health.
<name>Mahatma</name>	Mahatma	Limca	How carefully she worked. Just for an instant she looked up as the first of the trucks with its load of cheering villagers drove by. “[MASK] is our father,” they sang out in tired voices. Some of them had been travelling all night.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Siddharth	He who opens doors all over the universe, and shuts them too in people’s noses. “If the boys ever return and need anything, it’s all stored there. Safe and sound. I used to hope that [MASK] would wear those spectacles one day.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Fatima	The exhaustion was starting to catch up with her. After all, the labor had gone on for a day and a half Dry labor too, HER FEVER * 71 for [MASK]’s waters had burst as she lay on the tiger skins being fanned by her attendants. '
<name>Radha</name>	Radha	Laura	I smiled. I did not want to be rude. As politely as I could, I held out the katori for the small amount of dahi I needed. [MASK] relaxed. She didn’t have to prove herself to me. She could be gracious to a fault.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Rosamma	What did we have to do with it? I thought I felt [MASK]’s thin fingers on my shoulder. It was uncanny. Down on the street below was a truck full of women. They were women construction workers who had been brought in from the villages.
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Ramu	End of Lesson.” The two men had returned to their drinks. They were laughing out loud at some joke. Had they heard [MASK] to the end? He was hot and flushed. The bartender was impatient.
<name>Persephone</name>	Persephone	Rameeza	Finally the padlock gave way and several arms reached in and lifted up [MASK]. I saw her pupils dilate as they carried her out, irises rimmed with night, so black, whole cities might have plunged in them and remained intact, flooded by ruin on the other side of hell.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Ramu	Twice I tried to call [MASK]’s home, but the lines were out of order. I told myself what in any case was forced on me, that it would be the better part of wisdom to wait for him to call. Waiting did not become me.
<name>Dean</name>	Dean	Ramu	I wanted to draw him into me, and have us born again and again, in one life after the next, holding each other. Next morning we were up before sunrise. I hastily put away my little odds and ends. [MASK] wanted me to leave before anyone arrived on the scene.
<name>Maya</name>	Maya	Child	“[MASK], I don’t even know what became of my sari, so hard I ran.” Why was she running? I asked her. She had no idea. “It may have just been delirium, but I don’t think it was just that.”
<name>him</name>	him	Rameeza	He gave it to me and I held both out to [MASK]. She tried to push herself up, and I moved closer to her and arranged the old sheet on which she was lying so that it made a small mound on which she could rest her back.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Wordsworth	In writing it seemed to me that memory was essential. Only memory, I argued, and the continuity it provided could pull the voice together. One of the poets I read very closely on those cold winter nights back then was [MASK].
<name>Gandhi</name>	Gandhi	Limca	The policemen were staring at me now. Behind us, a jeep pulled into the drive and a man in a white shirt and starched dhoti jumped out. The policemen jumped to attention. It was obviously a politician, one of [MASK]’s followers, but why was he here?
<name>Ambedkar</name>	Ambedkar	Durgabai	“\bu mean people don’t think like that now? Of course they do!” I was appealing to [MASK]. “And what of the Brahminhood part? That huge system of hierarchies, it chokes out life. Meanwhile people are being beaten and molested all around us.
<name>Parvati</name>	Parvati	Ramu	She asked no questions. Tears flowed out of my eyes. So he was still alive. Then I sensed someone in the dark corner by the Ganapati statue. Who was it? Not [MASK] surely? As I moved forward the figure advanced. A woman.
<name>a Brahmin</name>	a Brahmin	Brahminhood	There was a ferocity in my voice that he could not mistake: “ ‘For all beings a human birth is difficult to obtain, more so is a male body; rarer than that is [MASK]; rarer still is the attachment to the Vedic religion.’ ”
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Mira	“Its because you’re so immersed in this writing thing, [MASK],” he complained. “It doesn’t let you turn right or left. And what do you do with it, after all? Look at all those notebooks under the bed!”
<name>Red</name>	Red	Mira	As for the two small jail cells behind the main room, who could be there? Or were they empty? “[MASK], there’s some talk a woman is being held here. In the smaller of the two cells.” “Why?”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Pithulbhai	Perhaps [MASK]’s daughter knows her. Knows where she is.” I had just composed the words of a response in my mind, when something I sensed in her tone stopped me. She was still very frail. I did not want to drag her into the turbulence of the world.
<name>Yasukichi</name>	Yasukichi	Ramu	In any case, those who heard of my poetical ambitions thought this writing business a great eccentricity in me. And I must confess I felt slightly ashamed, as if back in my own country I had been caught eating with my left hand. Once [MASK], in a curious mood, tried to console me.
<name>Gerasimos</name>	Gerasimos	Gandhi	Look at that poor old man. [MASK], I mean. Turn around and look, for god’s sake. He’s an island now. We race around him and leave him where he is. When he’s picked up it’s to embellish our own tales.”
<name>maid</name>	maid	Raniamma	I have barely had any sleep. A C-section late last night. Did you hear me come in?” She did not wait for a reply. “Will you do me a favor? Our [MASK] deliberately left the lid off the dahi pot to spite me.
