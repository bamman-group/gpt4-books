<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Miles	“Wondering,” she said patiently, “if I don’t suspect.” Then she held out her hand, and I took it. “You’ve helped me, [MASK], whether you know it or not, and I don’t want you to worry too much about me.”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Becky	Stooping, my arms moving fast, I began yanking great handfuls of weeds loose, snapping their brittle stems, gesturing violently at [MASK] to do the same. Then we had, each of us, a huge armload of weeds, like sheaves of wheat.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Becky	I heard the crackling of underbrush; it continued for a time, then faded away, and I reached carefully for [MASK]’s hand and held it. CHAPTER TW|NJY We lay for a long time—motionless, terribly uncomfortable at first, then painfully uncomfortable, but never moving, never changing position.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Becky	[MASK] was clinging to my arm, unaware of how much of her weight she was making me carry, and her face was bloodless, her eyes half closed, her lips parted, and she was sucking in air through her mouth.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Jack	What’s the trouble, [MASK]?” He didn’t answer, but walked forward to hold the outer doors open for us, and I knew he didn’t want to talk in the lobby, so we walked on out the sidewalk, and he followed.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Wilma	“It’s all right; she’s upstairs. Just be sure he doesn’t hear.” I sat chewing my lip, trying to think. “What about his habits, [MASK]?” I said then. “Little mannerisms?”
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Wilma	Between this and—[MASK]’s case?” I glanced at her quickly, but she was staring straight ahead through the windshield. “What do you think?” I said casually. “You think there’s a connection?” “Yes.”
<name>George</name>	George	Becky	He had a pretty good second-hand billiard table in there, I knew; he’d told me he used it a lot, just knocking the balls around by himself, doing a lot of his writing in his head. Now he looked at [MASK], glancing at his wife, too.
<name>Miss Maudie</name>	Miss Maudie	Miles	“Not a thing.” He stood there, across the porch, a middle-aged man smiling benignly. “Would like you to come down to the station, though—my office, that is—if you don’t mind, [MASK].”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Miles	“Why not, [MASK]; why can’t I?” She paused for an instant, then said, “I can. You’ll be beaten up, you’ll have a bad minute or so, but then . . .
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Jack	“All right”—I nodded. “No harm trying him, at least; I’ll phone him.” I lifted my cup to my mouth, and took a sip of coffee. [MASK] watched, scowling, the impatience rising up in him till it burst out.
<name>Leinster</name>	Leinster	Budlong	We shook our heads, and he lighted his own. “The things he showed me”—Professor [MASK] exhaled cigarette smoke—“simply looked to me like very large seed pods, as they’d have looked to anyone, I’m sure.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Becky	She did, too; she had on a gray suit with a sort of spray of flowers worked into the material in silver, and running up onto one shoulder. “Thanks.” [MASK] got into the car, then grinned at me, sort of lazily and happily.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Jack	Watching, as [MASK] shifted fast into second, and then into high, I saw the flames drop quickly and subside into a score of inch-high, blue-and-red flickering tongues, the smoke blood-pink once again.
<name>Eddie</name>	Eddie	Billy	And if you ever showed up with a cheap pair of shoes, his silence gave conviction to his compliments of the past. With [MASK], the shoeshine man, you had the feeling of being with that rarest of persons, a happy man.
<name>Uncle Ira</name>	Uncle Ira	Miles	The words, the gestures, the tones of voice, everything else—but not the feeling.” Her voice was suddenly firm and commanding: “[MASK], memories or not, appearances or not, possible or impossible, that is not my Uncle Ira.”
<name>Bella</name>	Bella	Miles	“I love you, [MASK].” I heard a tiny sound from the locked door behind us, familiar, yet for an instant I couldn’t recognize it; it was the snapping sound a dry, brittle leaf makes.
<name>Bella</name>	Bella	Becky	But you won’t get a call through.” [MASK]’s head swung toward me, and she buried her face on my chest, her hands clutching my lapels; and, my arms around her, I felt her shoulders heave in a dry and soundless sob.
<name>Dr. Crawford</name>	Dr. Crawford	Jack	“No rigor mortis,” [MASK] said. “Right?” “That’s right,” I said, “but rigor mortis isn’t invari- able. There are certain conditions—” I stopped talking; I didn’t know what to make of this.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Becky	And that salesman, and the way the town looks—” “It’s impossible, [MASK]; it’d take a whole town to do that, every soul in it. It’d have to be absolutely unanimous in decision, and action. And that would include us.”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Jack	Then I nodded my head, and deliberately spoke in a normally loud tone: “She’ll sleep for several hours at least, [MASK]; maybe even till eight or nine in the morning. Then she’ll wake up hungry, and she’ll be all right.”
<name>He</name>	He	Budlong	The life form on it must reckon with and prepare for that fact—to survive.” [MASK] sat forward in his chair, staring at me, fascinated by what he was saying. “A planet dies,” he repeated, “slowly and over immeasurable ages.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Becky	We could only take every least chance we could give ourselves, not giving up, yielding nothing, fighting to the very last instant of time we had left. We each wore one of my shoes; [MASK] couldn’t keep both of them on, they were far too large.
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Nick	[MASK] staggered sideways, and went down, to his knees. Then I had an arm around his neck, standing at his back, pulling his chin up in the crook of my elbow over my hip, and he had to stumble to his feet to ease the pressure on his throat.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Miles	They’re after us, all of them, and they’ll get us. [MASK], we’ve got to leave; we’ve got to run.” I took her by both arms, just above the elbows, staring down into her face, and I nodded.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Becky	I’d hoped you might find one, when [MASK] told me you were here—that you’d see some sort of difference. But of course you can’t, because there isn’t any to see. Look at him.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Nick	We were through with the car, and anyone finding it with the motor on might just possibly waste time waiting for us to come back. There was simply no way I could carry [MASK]’s pistol without it showing, and after a moment I threw it into the weeds.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Mannie	He was silent for a moment, and we stared at the silent, unchanging surface of the moon. “Well, it wasn’t always,” [MASK] said softly. “Once it was alive.” He turned away, back to the chesterfield.
<name>doctor</name>	doctor	Jack”—I	I was get- ting more and more irritated. I didn’t like this; there was something strange about this dead man on the table, but I couldn’t tell what, and that only made me angrier. “Come on, [MASK] looked at him again.
<name>her</name>	her	Becky	I don’t know how long we stood looking up at the sky. Presently the tiny dots became specks and a moment later, blinking my eyes against the strain, I stared again, and they were gone. For a time I simply held [MASK], squeezing her to me.
<name>Borges</name>	Borges	Miles	“[MASK], these are lies, most of them, for all I know. Some are most certainly hoaxes. And maybe most of the rest are distortions, exaggerations, or simple errors of judgment or vision; I have sense enough to know that.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Dave	But it quickly thinned, and I saw women again trundling wire shopping carts inside the market, people sitting down at the counter of [MASK]’s Diner, others sauntering into or out of the various stores. Cars moved slowly along the streets once more.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jack	You already said that early this evening, and I agree, I agree! But what? We can’t sit around forever till the one correct move is finally revealed to us!” I was glaring at [MASK], then I forced myself to behave.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Mannie	You can’t explain them all away, perpetually and forever!” For a moment he sat glaring at me, then he smiled. “So is [MASK] right? Should what happened last night be explained away, too?”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Beekey	[MASK] tried to interest me in the fact that several objects in the trash pile on which the pods had fallen seemed very much alike, attributing this fact to the pods. He pointed out two empty Del Monte peaches cans, I remember, which looked identical.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Becky	I’ll get some clothes on.” Upstairs, me in my bedroom, [MASK] in the bathroom a step or two down the hall, we each got dressed, and calling quietly to each other, were able to talk.
<name>partner</name>	partner	Miles	He shook his head, hands outspread helplessly. “Don’t you see? There’s nothing we can do, [MASK], but wait; and try to explain, make you understand and accept this, try to make this as easy on you as we can.
<name>Doc</name>	Doc	Miles	I pulled to the edge of the road, set the brake, and turned to him, leaving the engine running. He took a deep breath, and said, “[MASK], there are certain things a doctor has to report when he runs into them, aren’t there?”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Miles	You can’t really do two things at once, though, and he noticed. “You worried or something, [MASK]? Seem a little absent-minded tonight.” I smiled and shrugged. “Just taking my work home with me, I guess.”
<name>Truman</name>	Truman	Jack	They waved at me, smiling, and upstairs from an open window, as I slammed the car door, I could hear [MASK]’s typewriter, and the house seemed alive once again with people I liked, and I felt wonderful.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Jack	In that same second or so of thought, I was finding excuses, telling myself that there wasn’t time to go up there now; that we had to act, had to do something. And I took my anger and shame out on [MASK].
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Ben	Don’t you know anyone here who could really—” “No, damn it! I’d be talking to them if I did! [MASK], it has to be somebody who knows me, and knows I’m not crazy.
<name>Darry</name>	Darry	Becky	He swallowed the last of his coffee, tossed the dregs on the lawn, and got up from the porch rail. “See you in the morning,” he said to [MASK] and me. “’Night.” I didn’t say anything to stop them.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Becky	What the hell are you fighting?” After a moment he turned, and walked back to the chesterfield. CHAPTER SEVENTEEN My hand was moving, stroking [MASK]’s hair, gently massaging her neck, comforting her, or trying to, in the only way I could.
<name>he</name>	he	Theodora	“Would you care to come upstairs,” I said politely, “and be seduced?” “Love to,” she murmured, and took a sip of her coffee, “but I’m too hungry just now.” “So sweet,” [MASK] said.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Miles”—he	“I’m not sure what she saw, [MASK] glanced over at me—“though I can guess, and so can you. But I couldn’t take time to go see for myself; I knew I had to get her out of there.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Jansek	The salesman straightened, slammed the door of his car, and a sheaf of leaflets in his hand, turned toward the store he’d come out of. [MASK] spoke to him, the salesman stepped onto the walk, and they stood there talking.
<name>Adolf Hitler</name>	Adolf Hitler	Becky	The nose was narrow, flaring into a sudden wideness at the bridge, and I saw that if it widened only a fraction of an inch more, this nose would be a duplicate, precise as a wax cast, of [MASK]’s.
<name>David</name>	David	Jack	But that’s all that’s real. [MASK], if you’d found that body a month ago, you’d have recognized it for what it was, a puzzling, possibly very strange mystery, but a perfectly natural one, too.
<name>Hazel</name>	Hazel	Becky	And now I understood a lot of things I hadn’t before. “I love you, [MASK],” I said, and she looked up at me to smile, then leaned her head back against my arm.
<name>myself</name>	myself	Becky	“The skeletons,” I said, pointing at them, standing hollow-eyed and grinning in my closet. “They did live.” Suddenly I was talking rapidly and excitedly, almost as though convincing [MASK] were all I need do.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Mannie	“Oh, you saw it, all right. In every tiny detail. Exactly as you described it. You saw it as vividly and absolutely real as anyone has ever seen anything. But you saw it only in your mind.” [MASK] frowned at me.
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Miles	For an instant, mouth open, she stared at me in absolute horror; then, if you can scream in a whisper, that’s what she did. “Oh, my God, [MASK], am I going crazy?
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Becky	The two men straightened. I lay there motionless, staring and fascinated, and for a moment we all stood, knelt, or lay in a frozen tableau. They stared at [MASK], then looked down at me. “What are you doing?”
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Becky	We were out of sight, completely sheltered from the street by the big old trees and high shrubbery of the lawn. “. . . like some more coffee?” we heard a voice, [MASK]’s father, saying.
<name>Claire</name>	Claire	Becky	I moved around the bed in two strides and grasped [MASK]’s shoulder, my other hand holding the light. I shook, and she moaned a little but didn’t waken, and now I got my arm under her shoulder and lifted.
<name>Operator</name>	Operator	Jack	“What number are you calling, please?” [MASK] told her, and she said, “Just a moment, please.” Then the ringing began; and it continued—ring, then a pause, ring, then a pause, for half a dozen times.
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Jack	After a few minutes [MASK] murmured, “Been downstairs lately?” “Yeah,” I said, then answered his unspoken questions. “Don’t worry; they’ve each had a hundred cc’s of air, intravenously.” “Dead?” I shrugged.
<name>Aunt Alexandra</name>	Aunt Alexandra	Wilma	[MASK] just shook her head again, turning to stare across the porch at nothing. “Why not?” She turned slowly back toward me; for a moment her eyes stared into mine, then suddenly the tears were running down her plump, twisted face.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Jack	It’s a well-built, healthy body; those are good muscles. But it never played football or hockey, never fell on a cement stair, never broke a bone. It looks . . . unused. That what you mean?” [MASK] nodded.
<name>Montgomery</name>	Montgomery	Budlong	And now I turned to [MASK], trying to think of something, anything, to say, to keep us awake, to find some point of attack, hoping for I didn’t know what. “How did it happen?” I said conversationally.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Becky	With anyone else, I knew we’d have been building toward some sort of inevitable climax: marriage, or an affair, or a bust-up. But [MASK] was just what the doctor ordered, and driving along now through the cool fall evening, I felt fine.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Mannie	Then the clarity of that mental image broke and faded, and I told myself irritably that there were a dozen perfectly possible and natural explanations, if I wanted to bother taking the trouble to think of them. I said it aloud. “[MASK] is right.
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	Billy	You had them shoes—lemme see, now!—fifty-six years come Tuesday, and they still takes a lovely shine!” The voice was [MASK]’s, the words and tone those the town knew with affection, but—parodied, and a shade off key.
<name>the patient</name>	the patient	Jack	But I didn’t see what else it could be, and that’s what I advised treatment for, starting at once. I had to tell [MASK], though, that I’d never seen a case before, and that if he wanted other opinions he must feel free to get them.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Mannie	“Well, do you think he can help her?” Sometimes there’s a limit to how truthful you should be, and I said, “Yes. If anyone can help her, [MASK]’s the boy to do it. I think he can help her.”
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Becky	[MASK] looked at me for a moment, then shivered suddenly; the night air was cool, and her nightgown was nylon. She tightened her grip around my neck and snuggled close, closing her eyes. “Too bad,” she murmured.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Becky	He nodded in the same way, and then we had passed him; I felt [MASK]’s arm, under mine, trembling. We passed a short, plump little woman, carry- ing a shopping bag, who didn’t glance at us.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Jack	I smiled a little. “It’s a big house; pick out a room and stay; bring your typewriter down, [MASK], and work. I’d love to have you. I rattle around in this house, and I could use some company.”
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Jack	I shrugged, and sat back on the chesterfield. “There you are. That far out enough for you?” “Yeah,” [MASK] said, slowly and emphatically nodding his head, the women silently watching us. “That’s exactly nutty enough for me.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Becky	On operating days especially. And every patient has to have one with me—how about it?” The glass nearly slipped through my fingers, because [MASK] sobbed, a dry, down-in-the-throat gasp, her breath sucking in convulsively.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Jack	I thought of something, turned to cross the room rapidly, winking at [MASK] to let him know I was okay now. Then I picked up the downstairs phone and dialed a number. The ringing began, and I had to grin; I was getting a little malicious pleasure out of this.
<name>Doc</name>	Doc	Miles	I backed out like a cat in a doghouse; got a hell of a bump on the head”—he touched his scalp. “Then I went back and pulled him out. I thought he might still be alive, I couldn’t tell. [MASK], how soon does rigor mortis set in?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Becky	Right now, I just couldn’t care. There’s a long, wide chesterfield in the waiting room, and I put [MASK] on it, her shoes off. I got a couple sheets, and the pillow from the examining-table, and tucked her in carefully.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Miles	“No.” His voice was casual. “Ten, fifteen minutes maybe.” “All right. Take my car?” “Rather use mine, [MASK], if you don’t mind. I’ll run you back when we’re through.”
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Mannie	[MASK] smiled. “None,” he said, “none at all,” and grinned as our heads swung to stare at him. “Listen,” he said quietly, “you’ve got a mystery on your hands, all right, and a real one.
<name>Partner</name>	Partner	Miles	He shrugged. “I won’t argue with you, [MASK]. You seem to have guessed pretty well how things are.” “No emotion.” I said it aloud, but wonderingly, speaking to myself.
<name>Jennifer</name>	Jennifer	Mannie	[MASK] smiled. “He found absolutely nothing wrong with her; nothing. She was sent home, another call came in, and the second woman was rushed to the hospital, examined, and again there was nothing wrong with her. All night long that happened.
<name>Mr. Tagomi</name>	Mr. Tagomi	Jack	Things in direct contradiction to what we know to be true. Something falls up, instead of down.” Reaching out to the toaster on the drainboard of the sink, [MASK] touched a finger tip to a crumb, and lifted it to his tongue.
<name>John Coffey</name>	John Coffey	Mannie	His forearms on his knees, hands clasped, [MASK] sat staring down at the town. “The human mind is a strange and wonderful thing,” he said reflectively, “but I’m not sure it will ever figure itself out.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jack	So I respected him; he knew how to make a decision; and I waited, now, till he was ready to talk. We passed the black-and-white city limits sign, and [MASK] pointed ahead.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Becky	“Couldn’t we stay with her?” [MASK] said. I shrugged. “I don’t know. But I don’t think so. I think just the people who live here ought to be here; I’m not sure it’ll work otherwise.
<name>she</name>	she	Theodora	Oh, no”—Jack shook his head smiling—“you must never admit for a moment that anything we don’t understand may nevertheless have occurred.” As I believe most wives, even the wisest, do with any real conviction held by their husbands, [MASK] accepted this and made it her own.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Miles	I’ll run you back when we’re through.” He nodded toward the side of the house. “I parked in your garage, next to your car, [MASK]; you left the doors open.” I nodded as though that were natural, but of course it wasn’t.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Miles	And when you look at it after die number one, the face isn’t finished. It’s all there, all right, but the details that give it character aren’t.” He stared at me. “[MASK], that’s what this face looks like.
<name>her</name>	her	Becky	I know you, I’d said, and now she replied, and her voice was infinitely remote and uncaring. “Do you?” she said, then turned on her heel and walked away. I gestured at [MASK] and we walked on out of the library.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Becky	There was a mole on the left hip, and a pencil-line white scar just below the right kneecap; and although I didn’t know it of my own knowledge, I was certain that [MASK], too, was marked in these very same ways.
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	Becky	I turned to [MASK], my mouth opening to say something, and my heart stopped, then began to pound, and I took two fast steps to her chair, grabbing her shoulders and shaking hard, and her eyes flew open.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Mannie	Isn’t that right, [MASK]?” He smiled wryly, tiredly. Then he stood, walked to the windows, and pointed. There, in the afternoon sky, hung a crescent moon, pale and silvery in the daylight, but very clear.
<name>Stanley</name>	Stanley	Fred	[MASK] is a nicely polished, completely articulated skeleton, and I keep it in my closet, together with a smaller, female skeleton; can’t have them standing around the office frightening the customers. My father gave them to me one Christmas, my first semester in medical school.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Mannie	“It’s a new hobby over our way,” I said, leaning an arm on the open door. “A cinch to replace jogging.” “Well, it’s the first contagious neurosis I ever ran into,” [MASK] said; he was half laughing, half mad.
<name>Cherry</name>	Cherry	Becky	“A few.” Watching the asphalt street in the headlight beams, I watched [MASK], too, from the comers of my eyes. But she didn’t react, or say anything, for nearly a block.
<name>Petunia</name>	Petunia	Aleda	“He’s not.” For a moment I was stuck, rattled; I couldn’t think of anything else to say. “Where’s your Aunt [MASK]?” “It’s all right; she’s upstairs. Just be sure he doesn’t hear.”
<name>Janine</name>	Janine	Becky	I stood up, then walked to the little wall cabinet and took out a wide roll of adhesive tape. At the instrument cabinet I gathered up everything else we needed; then, at my desk, I unbuttoned [MASK]’s sleeves at her wrists, pushed back my coat sleeves, and went to work.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Jack	[MASK] rattled the ice idly in his glass and, staring down at it, said slowly, “I have a feeling that this is a time to do something more than call the police. That this isn’t a time to pass the buck, and let someone else do the worrying.
<name>His wife</name>	His wife	Theodora	He turned to his wife. “Have we?” “A what?” “An ink pad. The kind you use for rubber stamps.” “Yes.” [MASK] got up and crossed the room to a desk. “There’s one in here somewhere.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Professor	Then it continued, in a suddenly strange and altered tone. “’Momin’, [MASK],” it said with a queer, twisted heartiness. “’Momin’!” it repeated. “Man, just look at those shoes.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Miles	“Of course, [MASK].” “I don’t think you really feel it any more, but if you can still remember anything of how it was, then leave us alone in here. Lock us in my office, and you’ll have just the one hall door to guard.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Becky	[MASK] gestured to indicate the length of the semideserted street behind and ahead of us. “A little at a time,” I said, and shrugged. “We’re just realizing it now; the town’s dying.”
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Becky	Behind us, the front door opened, and now I unlatched the gate, and holding [MASK]’s elbow tightly, I walked with her—quickly, but not running—along the sidewalk, and down two houses.
