<name>Eppie</name>	Eppie	Mag	His truthful reply would have been, I'm glad. "Anything to eat in the house?" continued he. "No," replied [MASK]. "Too bad!" again, orally, with the same INWARD gratulation as before.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	James	She resolved to persevere. She said nothing on the subject, unless asked. It was evident to all her mind was deeply exercised. [MASK] longed to speak with her alone on the subject. An opportunity presented soon, while the family were at tea.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Jack	A small half window furnished light and air. [MASK] returned to the sitting room with the remark that the child would soon outgrow those quarters. "When she DOES, she'll outgrow the house," remarked the mother. "What can she do to help you?"
<name>Mr. Jaggers</name>	Mr. Jaggers	John	How could she meet this case? She resolved to make her complaint to [MASK]. Strange, when she was always foiled in this direction, she should resort to him. It was time something was done; she had begun to read the Bible openly.
<name>Miss Ophelia</name>	Miss Ophelia	James	"Yes; if you won't let me be whipped tomorrow." "You won't be whipped. You must try to be a good girl," counselled [MASK]. "If I do, I get whipped," sobbed the child.
<name>Tabitha</name>	Tabitha	Frado	It was now certain [MASK] was to become a permanent member of the family. Her labors were multiplied; she was quite indispensable, although but seven years old. She had never learned to read, never heard of a school until her residence in the family.
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Frado	[MASK] walked towards the house, her mistress following with the wood she herself was sent after. She did not know, before, that she had a power to ward off assaults. Her triumph in seeing her enter the door with HER burden, repaid her for much of her former suffering.
<name>Mrs. Flint</name>	Mrs. Flint	James	"Yes, but who ever thought of having a nigger go, except to drive others there? Why, according to you and [MASK], we should very soon have her in the parlor, as smart as our own girls.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	[MASK] felt abashed for a moment. He knew well what were her objections. "You's had trial of white folks any how. They run off and left ye, and now none of 'em come near ye to see if you's dead or alive.
<name>John</name>	John	Nig	It was her favorite exercise to enter the apartment noisily, vociferate orders, give a few sudden blows to quicken [MASK]'s pace, then return to the sitting room with SUCH a satisfied expression, congratulating herself upon her thorough house-keeping qualities.
<name>Mammy</name>	Mammy	Frado	As he was thus sitting one day, after the family had finished dinner, [MASK] seated herself in her mistress' chair, and was just reaching for a clean dessert plate which was on the table, when her mistress entered.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bridget	"She came just in the right time, didn't she? Just the very day after [MASK] left," continued she. "I'll see what she can do in the morning," was the answer.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Walker	But her feelings on her way thither, and after her arrival, can be given better in her own language; and I trust it will be no breach of confidence if I here insert part of a letter she wrote her mother [MASK], concerning the matter.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Frado	They had climbed fences and walls, passed through thickets and marshes, and when night approached selected a thick cluster of shrubbery as a covert for the night. They were discovered by the person who now restored them, chatting of their prospects, [MASK] attempting to banish the childish fears of her companion.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Frado	There will never be any sickness or sorrow there." [MASK], overcome with grief, sobbed, and buried her face in his pillow. She expected he would die; but to hear him speak of his departure himself was unexpected. "Bid me good
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Alfrado	"TRUTH is stranger than fiction;" and whoever reads the narrative of [MASK], will find the assertion verified. About eight years ago I became acquainted with the author of this book, and I feel it a privilege to speak a few words in her behalf.
<name>Doctor</name>	Doctor	Frado	Oh, let me go and be at rest!" As if waiting for this petition, the Angel of Death severed the golden thread, and he was in heaven. At midnight the messenger came. They called [MASK] to see his last struggle.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Jack	"[MASK]! what do you want to bring such a poor being into the family, for? You'd better stay here, at home, and let your wife go. Why couldn't you try to do better, and not disgrace your parents?"
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Mary	He was a man who seldom decided controversies at home. The word once spoken admitted of no appeal; so, notwithstanding [MASK]'s objection that she would have to attend the same school she did, the word became law.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Frado	No," she replied, and stepped to the window to conceal her emotion. "Come here, and sit by me; I wish to talk with you." She approached him, and, taking her hand, he remarked: "How poor you are, [MASK]!
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	James	then she did not wish to go. If she should be near [MASK], even, she could not be happy with those fiery eyes watching her ascending path. She resolved to give over all thought of the future world, and strove daily to put her anxiety far from her.
<name>St. Clair</name>	St. Clair	James	[MASK] called her to him, and inquired the cause of her sorrow. She was afraid to expose the cruel author of her misery, lest she should provoke new attacks. But after much entreaty, she told him all, much which had escaped his watchful ear.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Mag	[MASK] had lived an outcast for years. She had ceased to feel the gushings of penitence; she had crushed the sharp agonies of an awakened conscience. She had no longings for a purer heart, a better life. Far easier to descend lower.
<name>Blackie</name>	Blackie	Nig	When she had none of the family around to be merry with, she would amuse herself with the animals. Among the sheep was a willful leader, who always persisted in being first served, and many times in his fury he had thrown down [MASK], till, provoked, she resolved to punish him.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jack	She was first up in the morning, doing what she could towards breakfast. Occasionally, she would utter some funny thing for [MASK]'s benefit, while she was waiting on the table, provoking a sharp look from his mother, or expulsion from the room.
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Henry	He would sacrifice everything but his inheritance to secure his betrothed. "And so you are the cause of her late coldness towards me. Leave! I will talk no more about it; the business is settled between us; there it will remain," said [MASK].
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	James	She would tell her she could not go where [MASK] was; she need not try. If she should get to heaven at all, she would never be as high up as he. HE was the attraction. Should she "want to go there if she could not see him?"
<name>the punching bag</name>	the punching bag	Nig	She was under her in every sense of the word. What an opportunity to indulge her vixen nature! No matter what occurred to ruffle her, or from what source provocation came, real or fancied, a few blows on [MASK] seemed to relieve her of a portion of ill-will.
<name>Uncle Tom</name>	Uncle Tom	Jack	The knowledge of her innocence, the perfidy of his sister, worked fearfully on [MASK]. He bounded from his chair, searched every room till he found the child; her mouth wedged apart, her face swollen, and full of pain.
<name>religion</name>	religion	Christianity	She had ceased to feel the gushings of penitence; she had crushed the sharp agonies of an awakened conscience. She had no longings for a purer heart, a better life. Far easier to descend lower. She entered the darkness of perpetual infamy. She asked not the rite of civilization or [MASK].
<name>gardening</name>	gardening	Mag	Industrious, and fond of [MASK], he was determined she should not regret her union to him. Time levied an additional charge upon him, in the form of two pretty mulattos, whose infantile pranks amply repaid the additional toil.
<name>Ichabod</name>	Ichabod	James	If she makes her appearance again, I'll take the skin from her body," replied his wife. [MASK], a fine looking young man, with a pleasant countenance, placid, and yet decidedly serious, yet not stern, looked up confounded.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Nab	When the good man's voice ceased, she returned to her toil, carefully removing all trace of sorrow. Her mistress soon followed, irritated by [MASK]'s impudence in presenting herself unasked in the parlor, and upbraided her with indolence, and bade her apply herself more diligently.
<name>Aunt Chloe</name>	Aunt Chloe	Jack	"Don't bump your head," said [MASK], and stepped before to open the door leading into her apartment,--an unfinished chamber over the kitchen, the roof slanting nearly to the floor, so that the bed could stand only in the middle of the room.
<name>Topsy</name>	Topsy	Nig	I have let [MASK] go out to evening meetings a few times, and, if you will believe it, I found her reading the Bible to-day, just as though she expected to turn pious nigger, and preach to white folks.
<name>Miss Temple</name>	Miss Temple	Susan	[MASK] was delighted to witness her progress, and some little book from her was a reward sufficient for any task imposed, however difficult. She had her book always fastened open near her, where she could glance from toil to soul refreshment.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	James	Such perfect contrast in the melody and prayers of these good people to the harsh tones which fell on her ears during the day. Soon she had all their sacred songs at command, and enlivened her toil by accompanying it with this melody. [MASK] encouraged his aunt in her efforts.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Jane	[MASK] begged her to follow her so soon as she should be released; but so wearied out was she by her mistress, she felt disposed to flee from any and every one having her similitude of name or feature. CHAPTER XI. MARRIAGE AGAIN.
<name>Mariah</name>	Mariah	Frado	"What experience?" asked she, quickly, as if she expected to hear the number of times she had whipped [MASK], and the number of lashes set forth in plain Arabic numbers. "Why, you know she is serious, don't you?
<name>Booker</name>	Booker	Want	I can give you a better home than this, and not let you suffer so." He prevailed; they married. You can philosophize, gentle reader, upon the impropriety of such unions, and preach dozens of sermons on the evils of amalgamation. [MASK] is a more powerful philosopher and preacher.
<name>Lucretia</name>	Lucretia	Frado	Excited by so much indulgence of a dangerous passion, she seemed left to unrestrained malice; and snatching a towel, stuffed the mouth of the sufferer, and beat her cruelly. [MASK] hoped she would end her misery by whipping her to death.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Frado	When he offered prayer, [MASK] stole to the door that she might hear of the heavenly bliss of one who was her friend on earth. The prayer caused profuse weeping, as any tender reminder of the heaven-born was sure to.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Frado	His wife entered, and interpreting the scene, gave him some restoratives, and withdrew for a short time. It was a great effort for [MASK] to cease sobbing; but she dared not be seen below in tears; so she choked her grief, and descended to her usual toil.
<name>she</name>	she	Samuel	One so well known would not be wholly neglected. Kind friends watched her when [MASK] was from home, prevented her from suffering, and when the cold weather pinched the warmly clad, a kind friend took them in, and thus preserved them.
<name>him</name>	him	Jane	His kindness she received, and by it was almost won. Her mother wished her to encourage his attentions. She had counted the acres which were to be transmitted to an only son; she knew there was silver in the purse; she would not have [MASK] too sentimental.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Mag	[MASK] felt sure her fears were realized, and that she might never see her again. Before her anxieties became realities, both were safely returned, and from them and their attendant they learned that they went to walk, and not minding the direction soon found themselves lost.
<name>Uncle Tom</name>	Uncle Tom	Frado	He kindly greeted her, took her to the parlor to see his wife and child, and said many things to kindle smiles on her sad face. [MASK] felt so happy in his presence, so safe from maltreatment! He was to her a shelter.
<name>Fagin</name>	Fagin	Nig	"Thought you were getting handsome, did she? Same old story, is it; knocks and bumps? Better times coming; never fear, [MASK]." How different this appellative sounded from him; he said it in such a tone, with such a rogueish look!
<name>Xantippe</name>	Xantippe	Mag	She was not as susceptible of fine emotions as her spouse. [MASK]'s opinion of her was not without foundation. She was self-willed, haughty, undisciplined, arbitrary and severe. In common parlance, she was a SCOLD, a thorough one.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jim	"All gone; and no more to cut, any how," was the reply. "Too bad!" [MASK] said. His truthful reply would have been, I'm glad. "Anything to eat in the house?" continued he. "
<name>Sara</name>	Sara	Frado	[MASK] waited for the close of day, which was to bring back her mother. Alas! it never came. It was the last time she ever saw or heard of her mother. CHAPTER III. A NEW HOME FOR ME. Oh! did we
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Jane	But she was restrained by an overruling Providence; and finally decided to stay contentedly through her period of service, which would expire when she was eighteen years of age. In a few months [MASK] returned home with her family, to relieve her parents, upon whom years and affliction had left the marks of age.
<name>Miss Caroline</name>	Miss Caroline	Frado	The most agreeable sound which ever meets the ear of sorrowing, grieving childhood. Example rendered her words efficacious. Day by day there was a manifest change of deportment towards "Nig." Her speeches often drew merriment from the children; no one could do more to enliven their favorite pastimes than [MASK].
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Nab	Is she YOUR prisoner?" "No! I have just told you I did not know where she was. [MASK] has her hid somewhere, I suppose. Oh, dear! I did not think it would come to this; that my own husband would treat me so."
<name>he</name>	he	James	If she should get converted she would have to go to meeting: at least, as long as [MASK] lives. I wish he had not such queer notions about her. It seems to trouble him to know he must die and leave her.
<name>He</name>	He	Jenny	It was very doubtful if he ever came for her. [MASK] would feel pained by her unwelcome gossip, and, glancing at her child, she decided, however true it might be, she had a pledge which would enchain him yet.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Nig	And if SHE dared to interfere in the least, she was ordered back to her "own quarters." [MASK] would creep slyly into her room, learn what she could of her regarding the absent, and thus gain some light in the thick gloom of care and toil and sorrow in which she was immersed.
<name>his daughter</name>	his daughter	Frado	He shielded her from many beatings, and every day imparted religious instructions. No one, but his wife, could move him so easily as [MASK]; so that in addition to her daily toil she was often deprived of her rest at night.
<name>Meg</name>	Meg	Jane	She was indeed the idol of her mother, and more nearly resembled her in disposition and manners than the others. [MASK], an invalid daughter, the eldest of those at home, was reclining on a sofa apparently uninterested.
<name>God</name>	God	James	But he had told them to repent; "what was that?" she asked. She knew she was unfit for any heaven, made for whites or blacks. She would gladly repent, or do anything which would admit her to share the abode of [MASK].
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Mag	After a time, work failed; their means were reduced. How [MASK] toiled and suffered, yielding to fits of desperation, bursts of anger, and uttering curses too fearful to repeat. When both were supplied with work, they prospered; if idle, they were hungry together.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jack	"Looks well to me," was the laconic reply. "Was her FATHER rich?" "Not worth a copper, as I know of; I never asked him," answered [MASK]. "Hadn't she any property?
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	George	She felt dissatisfied with her relation to him. His calls while [MASK] was there, brought their opposing qualities vividly before her, and she found it disagreeable to force herself into those attentions belonging to him. She received him apparently only as a neighbor.
<name>Mr. Flint</name>	Mr. Flint	Seth	She remembered the conversation of her mother with [MASK], the words "given away" which she heard used in reference to herself; and though she did not know their full import, she thought she should, by remaining, be in some relation to white people she was never favored with before.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Frado	While this conversation was passing below, [MASK] lay, revolving in her little mind whether she would remain or not until her mother's return. She was of wilful, determined nature, a stranger to fear, and would not hesitate to wander away should she decide to.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Nig	Now, while I stay, she is going to sit down HERE, and eat such food as we eat." A few sparks from the mother's black eyes were the only reply; she feared to oppose where she knew she could not prevail. So [MASK]'s standing attitude, and selected diet vanished.
<name>Nell</name>	Nell	Nig	[MASK], weeping, knew not what to do. She had carried the smallest; none left would suit her mistress; of course further punishment awaited her; so she gathered up whatever came first, and threw it down on the hearth.
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	James	As she heard her cross the entry below, to ascend the stairs, she slipped out and held the latch of the door which led into the upper entry. "[MASK] does not want to see you, or any one else," she said.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Mag	Such was [MASK]'s experience; and disdaining to ask favor or friendship from a sneering world, she resolved to shut herself up in a hovel she had often passed in better days, and which she knew to be untenanted.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Mag	As they were some miles from home, they were kindly cared for until morning. [MASK] was relieved to know her child was not driven to desperation by their intentions to relieve themselves of her, and she was inclined to think severe restraint would be healthful.
<name>ISABELLA</name>	ISABELLA	NIG	He guessed their cause, and longed for returning health to take her under his protection. CHAPTER VII. SPIRITUAL CONDITION OF [MASK]. "What are our joys but dreams? and what our hopes But goodly shadows in the summer cloud?"
<name>who</name>	who	Jack	He was no stranger to his mother's nature; but years of absence had erased the occurrences once so familiar, and he asked, "Is this that pretty little Nig, [MASK] writes to me about, that you are so severe upon, mother?"
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Seth	"They're none of mine," said [MASK]; "what you growling about?" "Nobody will want any thing of mine, or yours either," she replied. "We'll make 'em, p'r'aps," he said.
<name>John</name>	John	Mary	She engaged herself, yielding to her mother's wishes, because she had not strength to oppose them; and sometimes, when witness of her mother's and [MASK]'s tyranny, she felt any change would be preferable, even such a one as this.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Frado	Their conversation we will omit; suffice it to say, a storm raged which required many days to exhaust its strength. [MASK] was becoming seriously ill. She had no relish for food, and was constantly overworked, and then she had such solicitude about the future.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Fido	Quickly looking about, she took the plate, called [MASK] to wash it, which he did to the best of his ability; then, wiping her knife and fork on the cloth, she proceeded to eat her dinner.
<name>Topsy</name>	Topsy	Frado	"You seem most pleased with the little nigger, so you may introduce her to her room." He went to the kitchen, and, taking [MASK] gently by the hand, told her he would put her in bed now; perhaps her mother would come the next night after her.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Aunt	He inquired the cause of her absence, and SHE told him all. After the family returned he sent his wife for her. When she entered, he took her hand, and said, "Come to me often, [MASK]. Come any time,--I am always glad to see you.
<name>Bentley Drummle</name>	Bentley Drummle	Mary	But it could not be so generally. She must return to school, to her household duties. He resolved to do what he could to protect her from [MASK] and his mother. He bought her a dog, which became a great favorite with both.
<name>her</name>	her	Mag	I'll help you, if nobody else will." A tear stood in [MASK]'s faded eye. "I'm glad," she said, with a softer tone than before, "if there is ONE who isn't glad to see me suffer.
<name>her father</name>	her father	Jack	She did not fear but she should have ample opportunity of subduing her when they were away. Three months of schooling, summer and winter, she enjoyed for three years. Her winter over-dress was a cast-off overcoat, once worn by [MASK], and a sun-bonnet.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Nig	"Bring me some wood, you lazy jade, quick." [MASK] rested the broom against the wall, and started on the fresh behest. Too long gone. Flushed with anger, she rose and greeted her with, "What are you gone so long for?
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	James	[MASK] found her, upon his return, sobbing; but fearful of revenge, she dared not answer his queries. He guessed their cause, and longed for returning health to take her under his protection. CHAPTER VII.
<name>New Year's Day</name>	New Year's Day	BYRON	" [MASK]. WITH what differing emotions have the denizens of earth awaited the approach of to-day. Some sufferer has counted the vibrations of the pendulum impatient for its dawn, who, now that it has arrived, is anxious for its close.
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Seth	Soon followed scenes familiar and trying. "It's no use," said [MASK] one day; "we must give the children away, and try to get work in some other place." "Who'll take the black devils
<name>SHAME</name>	SHAME	DEATH	She has descended another step down the ladder of infamy. CHAPTER II. MY FATHER'S [MASK]. Misery! we have known each other, Like a sister and a brother, Living in the same lone home Many years--we must live some Hours or ages yet to come.
<name>Moll Flanders</name>	Moll Flanders	Providence	In one of her tours, [MASK] favored her with a friend who, pitying her cheerless lot, kindly provided her with a valuable recipe, from which she might herself manufacture a useful article for her maintenance. This proved a more agreeable, and an easier way of sustenance.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jane	He begged to know if his affections were reciprocated, or could be; if she would permit him to write to her; if she was free from all obligation to another. "What would mother say?" queried [MASK], as she received the letter from her aunt.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Frado	As she took her accustomed seat, he asked, "Are you afraid to stay with me alone, [MASK]?" "No," she replied, and stepped to the window to conceal her emotion. "Come here, and sit by me; I wish to talk with you."
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Mag	"I can do but two things," said she, "beg my living, or get it from you." "Take me, [MASK]. I can give you a better home than this, and not let you suffer so."
<name>Old Sally</name>	Old Sally	Jack	She was shown how it was ALWAYS to be done, and in no other way; any departure from this rule to be punished by a whipping. She was then accompanied by [MASK] to drive the cows to pasture, so she might learn the way.
<name>Mr. Knightley</name>	Mr. Knightley	Henry	He then conferred with [MASK] at his home. It was not a pleasant subject to talk upon. To be thus supplanted, was not to be thought of. He would sacrifice everything but his inheritance to secure his betrothed. "And so you are the cause of her late coldness towards me.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Mary	screamed [MASK], one of her sickest days, "come here, and sweep these threads from the carpet." She attempted to drag her weary limbs along, using the broom as support. Impatient of delay, she called again, but with a different request.
<name>John</name>	John	John	"I do mean it. The child does as much work as a woman ought to; and just see how she is kicked about!" "Why do you have it so, [MASK]?" asked his sister. "How am I to help it?
<name>Phillis</name>	Phillis	Frado	[MASK] was called early in the morning by her new mistress. Her first work was to feed the hens. She was shown how it was ALWAYS to be done, and in no other way; any departure from this rule to be punished by a whipping.
<name>Emmaline</name>	Emmaline	Frado	"Nobody will want any thing of mine, or yours either," she replied. "We'll make 'em, p'r'aps," he said. "There's [MASK]'s six years old, and pretty, if she is yours, and white folks'll say so.
<name>his sister</name>	his sister	Mary	But, alas! it was not in his power; so, after listening to his wishes and arrangements for his family and business, he decided to return home. Anxious for company home, he persuaded his father and mother to permit [MASK] to attend him.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Frado	What seemed so light and easy to others, was too much for [MASK]; and it became necessary to ask once more where the sick should find an asylum. All felt that the place where her declining health began, should be the place of relief; so they applied once more for a shelter.
<name>David</name>	David	Frado	pointing to [MASK]. It was soon all told. She then reminded them of their duties to the poor and friendless; their cowardice in attacking a young innocent child; referred them to one who looks not on outward appearances, but on the heart.
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Frado	He was a fine, straight negro, whose back showed no marks of the lash, erect as if it never crouched beneath a burden. There was a silent sympathy which [MASK] felt attracted her, and she opened her heart to the presence of love--that arbitrary and inexorable tyrant.
