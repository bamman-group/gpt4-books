<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Handback	It asked him why he had maneuvered [MASK]’s cotton down the river, and why he was sitting thus in the filth of this cell to hold the money he had obtained by fraud? The man in the lamplit cell could not answer this question. He did not know.
<name>Ratan</name>	Ratan	Miltiades	The postmaster walked with head down and hands behind him. Now he looked up and around. “Yes,” he said, “what is it?” He stood looking across the creek at [MASK], as if he were completely at sea why anyone had called him.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Miltiades	They drove away and left him in the hot Square under the westering sun. The show was over. The mob had become a crowd again, and some of them were going home. A sprinkling of men flowed away in all directions. [MASK] had no heart to return to the Crowninshield manor.
<name>Jake</name>	Jake	Alex	“You might ’a’ knowed you wouldn’t git nothin’ out of the Colonel, [MASK],” they twitted. “Nobody knows what the Colonel’s goin’ to do tull he does it. . . . If you don’t believe that, go ast ol’ man Han’back!”
<name>Mrs. Compson</name>	Mrs. Compson	Drusilla	The Colonel nodded in the direction of the old Lacefield place. “I’m sorry for that—that last. I wish it hadn’t happened- It was really his own fault ... to give up and quit like that.” [MASK] continued shaking her head hopelessly.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Sydna	He said if my character permitted a little runt to kick me around like that, he didn’t want to have anything more to do with me. . . . Well, I can see how he felt that way.” “So can I,” nodded [MASK].
<name>Siddhartha</name>	Siddhartha	Jerry	None of them understood him; none of them could understand what he had set his heart upon. Following his resolution, [MASK] meant to give up all thought of worldly goods, of honor, of place, of the desire for women, everything.
<name>Edison</name>	Edison	Sydna	At last his fingers and toes ached so he had to give it up, but he considered his experiment, taken as a whole, a success. Then he had run over to [MASK] as the solitary human being to whom he could mention such a thing.
<name>Mother</name>	Mother	Jerry	The youth got out of bed with a long sigh. “I think I’ll take a walk,” he said. “In the rain?” “If you think it won’t hurt you, it won’t,” said [MASK].
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Sydna	“All right. . . . Tell me.” Ordinarily the Colonel would have put his palm over the girl’s hand, but now he did not. “[MASK],” he said seriously, “I am a middle-aged man.
<name>Vaiden</name>	Vaiden	Miltiades	It was a high name, a noble name. The queer part of this was that, so far as [MASK] knew, no Vaiden had ever been high or noble. They were all very ordinary folk. But this affected not in the slightest degree the glory of the Vaiden name.
<name>Clyde</name>	Clyde	Jerry	... I shouldn’t think you’d want to!” she ejaculated on the impulse. “W-well,” stammered [MASK], “I thought . . .” He was reduced to silence by a confused desire to sacrifice himself for her happiness.
<name>the sheriff</name>	the sheriff	Mayhew	The thought of being arrested in the street was disagreeable to him, and he hurried his steps toward home. As he did so he became aware that somebody just behind him was adjusting his pace to his own. A suspicion that it was [MASK], the sheriff, disturbed the Colonel.
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Frierson	He tingled to do some terrible violence to her. For a Vaiden nigger . . . one his own family had raised . . . the Colonel reached in his pocket and fingered [MASK]’s revolver. He turned, walked back up the hallway, and opened the woman’s bedroom door.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Gracie	rrre “Can you put it up in the loft? . . . It’s heavy.” “I don’t know. . . .” [MASK] came forward to take the bag, but she was so shaken she could hardly lift it.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Jerry	did you say that?” “Why! Why, me and [MASK] got to squabbling,” explained the boarder nervously. “If I said it I didn’t mean it. I don’t know what-all I said.”
<name>him</name>	him	Jerry	The hobbledehoy moved along in the crowd, pondering some way of speaking to the girl ahead of him, when a redheaded man brushed past [MASK], walked up beside the girl, took her parasol out of her hands, and said: “I’ve been looking for this blue sunshade everywhere.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Gracie	“He loses his whole place,” said [MASK], “every cent he paid for it.” “And if I wait till fall to sell my mules and stuff, even if they should not be levied on, the prices will be low then.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Jerry	I—I’m not cold. . . .” “I came down to see you, [MASK]. Both of us are wet already. Suppose we walk on a little way and talk, if you don’t mind.” “No, I—I don’t mind.”
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Jerry	she repeated, and with the question turned toward the manor as if the answer lay somewhere in the house. [MASK] was shaken at the intangible thing that had happened to him. “I got to go,” he said, and moved bemazed among the box borders toward the gate.
<name>The Colonel</name>	The Colonel	Cady	“Somebody’s goin’ to haff to take ’em down,” opined [MASK]. The tenant sat in his cabin cutting lumps from a stick which was wrapped in a greasy red paper. “What’s that you’re haggling at?” inquired the Colonel after a space.
<name>Colonel</name>	Colonel	Miltiades	[MASK] leaned against the general delivery window. His mouth went dry. “So . . . it’s been taken out,” he said in a low tone. “Why, I suppose so.” The postmaster moved out of sight of the Colonel.
<name>she</name>	she	Gracie	That was as honorable an offer as [MASK] had ever had. The merchant had walked out of the dining room maddened when he learned that she had betrayed him. But, even then, if she had said she would go with him, she believed he would have taken her back.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sydna	“Right away?” “Next trip of the Rapidan.” “Not before school quits?” “That doesn’t make any difference, the teachers are going to fail me anyway.” [MASK] drew a breath.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Sandusky	Colonel!” begged [MASK] desperately. “Won’t you make each other some reasonable offer? Five hundred dollars is no offer! To say you are going to charge fifty per cent and keep it all is no offer! Be reasonable!”
<name>the person's name cannot be determined from the given context</name>	the person's name cannot be determined from the given context	Klem	“My wife says your troubles are going to be little ones purty soon.” He gave a respectful laugh. “Oh . . . well, I don’t know,” said the Colonel, not much relishing the subject with [MASK].
<name>he</name>	he	Sandusky	It was a very formal note, which he had copied straight out of the Complete Letter Writer's Guide. That invitation became its recipient’s prize possession. She showed it to all of her girl friends and to some of the women teachers. When [MASK] found this out he was furious.
<name>Eppie</name>	Eppie	Sydna	At times [MASK] thought of what she would say if she should speak to him; she would try to thank him for his care over her, for being a kind of invisible guardian over her . . . here her thoughts lost the form of words and became a feeling of sweetness and gratitude.
<name>Clytie</name>	Clytie	Gracie	“[MASK], you . . . didn’t really . . . mean that?” he asked with a sickened feeling. “I meant . . . some—some girl as—as white as he is,” stammered the quadroon.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Sydna	It seems trivial, somehow. I just want to be near you, where I can look at you and hear your voice. . . .” “You love me, don’t you, [MASK]?” asked the man, with concern.
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Sydna	They’re Vaiden niggers.” From where they were [MASK] could see the manor, a gaunt, solitary pile between the blue sky and the brown fields. The girl looked at it for several seconds. “Is that the manor?” she asked in a shocked voice.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Lucius	... At that moment a large negro caught the youth from behind. The pistol fired through the skylight. [MASK] was now cursing and trying to shoot the negro who had him in his arms. The colored man, frightened in his turn, was yelling:
<name>Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley</name>	Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley	Ponny	“Oh, they haven’t even got a doctor!” Just then they saw the bulk of [MASK] fill the kitchen door and wring out a dish rag. The fat woman saw who was in the buggy and stared in amazement.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Miltiades	“You mean have two parties and let the niggers vote?” inquired [MASK] sharply. The real-estate agent came to a pause. “No . . . no,” he said slowly, “I wouldn’t advocate that.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Sam	He looked up and saw a dark form coming up the box-lined path. He thought it was [MASK], his negro of all work, coming back after his scare. The figure paused in front of the piazza and called in a hillman’s voice: “Hello! Hello!”
<name>Undine</name>	Undine	Gracie	He was on the road to the home of his runaway mistress. When he had started from town he was not quite sure that he was going to [MASK], but as he rode forward in his hunting coat and leggins, his destination grew upon him.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Miltiades	“Oh, yeh,” nodded the jailer; “he’s in as big a lather to take you up as you are to take him up. They want to call ever’thing off.” [MASK] walked to the door and down the steps with the jailer.
<name>John</name>	John	Landers	“And you think that is love?” “I think the force that matter feels when it is being drawn to serve life is love.” The Colonel stood looking curiously at the man in the grating. “You stay too much by yourself, [MASK].
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Lucius	he shouted. The officer strode over and struck the negro on the head with his billy. “You black hound, fighting a white man! Come on with me!” [MASK] wheeled to fire, but the policeman grabbed his arm. “Don’t kill him!
<name>He</name>	He	Miltiades	she asked in a pinched tone. [MASK] suddenly perceived that the girl was suffering. A feeling of helplessness came over him. “Why, no . . . she doesn’t . . . she said she didn’t,” he returned uncertainly.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Miltiades	With this [MASK] began moving slowly away from the hand on his shoulder so that its removal would appear unplanned. The man took down his hand and began to look around. “There’s some buggies yander,” he said in the flatted voice of a man whose friendly advances have been declined.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Lucy	The two women had not stood on the edge of the old pit for many minutes before the tan girl began cleaning off the bricks and putting them in the wagon bed. There was something attractive about [MASK] as she stooped and scraped and piled the bricks in the wagon.
<name>Brett</name>	Brett	Ponny	As the Colonel stepped across a gully in the neglected street he rewarded her loyalty by thinking in a kind of annoyed fashion: “I should have asked her to go with me . . . damn it . . . [MASK]’s a good girl. . . .”
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Lucy	The white negro said nothing but rode the jingling mules just behind the Colonel. At the manor the two colored women and the white girl were waiting anxiously the return of the men. [MASK], the tan girl, was stationed far down the road.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Nun	she asked gently. The youth became embarrassed anew. “[MASK]-nobody . . . Well, myself ... I mean my—my soul.” “Your . . . what?” “I—I’ve been reading about souls in a book. , . .
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Landers	When he entered his office a tall man stepped into his door behind him and caused the Governor to whirl around. “Hell, you gave me a start, [MASK]. . . . What do you want?” The postmaster stood shaken in the doorway.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Cady	“What do you suppose he’ll try?” asked the quadroon in alarm. “Oh, I dunno . . . somep’n . . . somep’n. . . .” The woman peered down the dark road in the direction of [MASK]’s shack.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Jerry	“What’ll he do with it?” “Correct it.” “Oh ... I see,” breathed [MASK], who perceived the indictment was an academic exercise. Then he recalled the actual role he had played in the episode.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Love	“I won’t,” promised [MASK], and the papers passed out of his mind even as he promised to remember them. The merchant squatted on his heels looking into his safe for a minute or two longer.
<name>Brigid</name>	Brigid	Ponny	“My God, [MASK], do you want me to turn blackmailer?” “Would that be blackmail—making him take you in as partner ?” “Of course! A partnership would be one sort of pay!” The woman blinked her eyes.
<name>Uncle Hammer</name>	Uncle Hammer	Jerry	The boy came running to the fence. “Let me look through it.” “It’s not that sort.” [MASK] put down the heavy pack. “It’s a telescope suitcase to put my clo’es in.” The boy looked at the suitcase.
<name>Cassie</name>	Cassie	Toussaint	As he went he called back: “I’ll git ye fer this, nigger! Hittin’ a white man with a rock! Yore day’s a-comin’, nigger!” And he staggered down the road and out of sight. [MASK] stood in the stable yard, sick with fright.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Handback	“You come such a tune as that, and I’ll send you to the coal mines as sure as you’re a foot high!” [MASK] was turning back toward the steps. “Wait! Wait!”
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Augustus	We’re going to set a precedent,” pronounced the chief executive sharply. “What are we going to do about this particular case?” pressed [MASK]. “Answer the injunction. I was just standing here framing my defense when you gentlemen came in.”
<name>Chick</name>	Chick	Miltiades	As he ran he glanced back over his shoulder to see if [MASK] was drawing a pistol. Full wrath filled the Colonel. “You shoot anybody!” he derided. “You haven’t got the guts to shoot a fattening hog!
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Handback	[MASK]! You minding that he gets every minute coming to him after what he’s done to you!” The Colonel felt an impulse to tell his wife what he really had done. He wanted to talk about it.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Miltiades	What earthly dif’runce does it make to him if I keep you in jail tonight or let you go home so long as I’ve got you to show in the morning?” “I don’t know,” said [MASK] absently, overlooking the question in the gray fact that he was in jail.
<name>Uncle Gavin</name>	Uncle Gavin	Jerry	He knocked again, more loudly; then, after a pause, moved across the porch to where he could see the window. It was still illuminated. When he returned to the door a voice said: “Is that you, [MASK]?”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Sydna	He wished [MASK] would come out so that he could ask her frankly if she would mind seeing him and talking to him again. He would tell her that he was very lonesome, but if she did not want to see him, he would bless her and think tenderly of her always.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sandusky	It made him uneasy. Now and then the notion of penal labor in the state coal mines flickered in and out of his head. ... It would be worth, [MASK] had said, more than two thousand a year to keep out of them.
<name>the bride</name>	the bride	Sydna	All were excited, and they talked in flatted tones on account of pins held in the corners of their mouths. They fluttered around [MASK], making imperceptible adjustments in her billowing train. Now and then they gave the bride little hugs and pats.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Mayhew	We was just set-tin’ here talkin’ about what ort to be done to a nigger like that, when he got a telegram and jumped up and run off like you seen him.” “[MASK], you mean?” “Sure . . .
<name>Uriah</name>	Uriah	Ponny	“[MASK]!” snapped the man, “you breathe a word of what I told you . . .” “Oh, don’t bother! I’ll keep the old hypocrite’s secret for him. I never see anybody to tell it to, anyway.”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Sydna	The moonlight rounded the other three with its soft radiance. The Colonel smoked his cigar in slow, meditative puffs. [MASK], disrobing in their boudoir, was quite near and intimate to him at one moment, and then seemed to recede at a great distance the next.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Milt	The mother smiled back at him but grew serious. “I . . . I’m afraid I can’t tell you my real reason, [MASK],” she said in an odd voice. “Then you do have one!”
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Landers	Out of habit he stepped into the lobby and went to his box. A circular of some sort was in it. He tapped on the little glass window, the yellow envelope vanished from sight, and a moment later [MASK] poked it under the general delivery grille.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Miltiades	He reflected again that he was thirty-five hundred dollars short. But the great advantage of having a full-bodied shortage is that small extravagances have no influence on it. “I believe I’ll suggest fifty dollars,” said [MASK].
<name>Abner</name>	Abner	Sydna	“Is that lots?” “For the last ten years this land has been running from three quarters to half a bale.” “Maybe I’ve brought you good luck?” smiled [MASK]. “Of course you have . . . spiritual luck.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Sarah	“Why—why—I read it in the book in the library,” said [MASK], equally disturbed. “We girls watched you. We saw you were always reading the same book, so we went to see what it was. We had a right to ...
<name>Colonel</name>	Colonel	Miltiades	An odd thing was, the mute reproach of the collection did not in the faintest degree move [MASK] to alter his design. It was as if some second person in the Colonel stood shocked and dismayed at the height from which he had fallen; but these emotions were entirely cut off from his actions.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Jerry	“But do you think that was just exactly . . . courteous ?” “I didn’t at first . . . but I guess it’s all right.” “[MASK], I wish you’d get some really nice girl to coach you in algebra . . .
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Toussaint	“I ought to have just let him talk.” The girl came over and touched his hand. “They tell me what is without help should be without regard,” she quoted philosophically. While the maxim was sober enough, her faint touch on his hand was pleasant to [MASK].
<name>Maxim</name>	Maxim	Jerry	If he got her to the door he could call her the rest of the way. He had hardly begun his concentration when he heard a sound toward the house. [MASK] was surprised at himself. His heart began beating. He peered toward the manor.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Sydna	[MASK] sat completely at sea. She did not know what to do. On the preceding night she had engaged herself to marry the hardware salesman and now here he had walked out and had a fist fight at her gate and had been chased away by a boy.
<name>Ruth</name>	Ruth	Gracie	“Where does she live?” “At de house wid de gate.” This abbreviated description fitted the shack so well that the Colonel remembered it. He was sharply astonished. “What in the world is [MASK] doing living with your mother!” he ejaculated.
<name>Elisa</name>	Elisa	Lucy	[MASK] gave a breath of relief. “It’s in the field,” she said. “Somebody must be burning the old corn stalks or something like that ... I smell it.” The girl stooped to pour the water with an easy mind.
<name>he</name>	he	Miltiades	She was unconscious, however, of this last reason as the basis of her rapid walking. As for [MASK], he kept alongside his sister-in-law, accepting her silence and quick motion as characteristic of her.
<name>Miss Emily</name>	Miss Emily	Love	[MASK] had gone to thff lynching, of course. The merchant took out his key and let himself into the hot dark interior. It smelled of bacon and calico and coal oil. There were some bolts of cloth on one end of the dry-goods counter.
<name>Sherburn</name>	Sherburn	Miltiades	[MASK] regarded the Northern man with one of those sudden inexplicable sympathies. “You should have married,” he smiled: “it would have given you much better reasons for death.” The banker laughed. “That doesn’t sound like Southern gallantry. . . .
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Jerry	However, he thought he had learned enough of the situation to go to the dean of the college and have [MASK] readmitted to his classes. “What have you been doing with yourself while you’ve been out of school?”
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Handback	Iked to you if I’d known who you were. You asked me, and I’m telling you.” “I see,” said [MASK]. He pondered a moment, and then asked, “How did you learn so much about me ?”
<name>the client</name>	the client	Handback	Don’t it sound pretty good? I made it up myself, some of it, and some I got out of the Legal Guide and Advisor.” The Colonel paid no attention to the pride of the author. “You are sure [MASK] is willing to sign that?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ponny	His brain twitched to get at the complicated problem of the cotton, and here was [MASK] going on about his clothes. “I’ll have all the clothes I need . . . both of us will . . . before long.”
<name>he</name>	he	Sydna	because her mother was in love with me before [MASK] was conceived by another man . . . that’s nonsense.” “I wouldn’t be sure of that,” answered the postmaster. “A great many races believe in telegony. The Jews made laws on the subject.”
<name>him</name>	him	Toussaint	When a colored person becomes educated there is no place for him. An educated man doesn’t want to do day labor in the fields. And where could [MASK] be a doctor, or a lawyer, or ever run a store bigger than a peanut stand.
<name>Dill</name>	Dill	Jerry	He stood at the fence until the boy in the yard stopped jumping and called out: “What you got in that box?” “It’s not a box,” said [MASK], “it’s a telescope.” The boy came running to the fence.
<name>Grandpa</name>	Grandpa	Miltiades	ever read ... if the hero doesn’t . . . marry his sweetheart when . . . when she’s young ... he ... he does when she’s old. . . .” [MASK] took the girl’s two hands and patted them.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Milt	“I know all that, [MASK],” said the woman softly; “in fact, I’ve seen you once or twice. I have always been a kind of symbol to you of the manor and the station you wanted.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Miltiades	He walked back down the street, astonished at himself, thinking it over, wondering if it were possible. What he suspected was this: it might be that his uncle [MASK] had taken the cotton, that his friends had withdrawn from him as a preordained test.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Miltiades	The real-estate man drew a cheroot out of his vest pocket and slipped it into [MASK]’ vest pocket. As he did so he said: “Know the very house you want. Some folks living in it now, but I think I can turn ’em out and let you have it.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Jerry	“I mean you pretended to think I could do something with my exercises, but you really never did.” “[MASK], I do believe in you . . . but what is there to believe?” A faint irony colored the hobbledehoy’s voice.
<name>Roskus</name>	Roskus	Col’l	“I imagine, so, but that’s not what I’m here for. What do you do with the manure in your stable, Luster?” “What do I do wid hit? Why, [MASK], mainly, I scrapes hit off’n my foot.”
<name>Miss Emily</name>	Miss Emily	Ponny	He described the rich rewards of a Christian life, extolling the patience, the charity, the faith and loving-kindness of the dead woman who lay in her coffin at the end of her empty existence. The interment of [MASK] was to take place at the family burial ground on the old Vaiden plantation.
<name>Man</name>	Man	Miltiades	For a space [MASK] ate in silence. The greater portion of his thought was a cold, conscious disregard for what the women about him were thinking. He asked himself silently, what difference did it make to him what the women thought?
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Sandusky	“Wh-why, th-th’ woman ’at got k-killed . . .” The drunk man wobbled his head vaguely to indicate the direction. At that moment [MASK] came up the corridor again. He was in a greater hurry than ever.
<name>Uncle Remus</name>	Uncle Remus	Miltiades	Then [MASK] saw a little black boy struggling with a preternaturally long musket, trying to level it at the squirrel by resting it in the fork of a bush. The white man remained quiet for upward of half a minute when a disconcerting thought entered his head.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Ponny	The Colonel paused once more on the very edge of telling [MASK] the whole matter. She really ought to know. She was involved in the uncertainty of the situation as completely as he himself. It would be better that he told her rather than someone else.
<name>Elijah</name>	Elijah	Colonel	“Three rolls of plow lines and a dozen assorted mule collars.” “We-ell . . . I’ll give it in just as you said it to me.” “Thank you very much, [MASK]—very much,” said the merchant gratefully.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Frierson	and he struck his horse. The animal shot down the back street, followed by [MASK]’s mount. They dashed arouijd a corner, and the Colonel could hear their hoofbeats receding toward the river. He stood looking blankly at the jail and at the fire station.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Buck	. would have threatened me with the gun.” The little negro remained paralyzed with fright. He wondered why he had ever spoken to it, why had he impressed his identity on its mind by talking to it? “Who is your father?” he asked. “[MASK].”
