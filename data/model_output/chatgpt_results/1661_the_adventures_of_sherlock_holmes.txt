<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Holmes	"No doubt you think me mad?" said he. "I see that you have had some great trouble," responded [MASK]. "God knows I have!--a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so sudden and so terrible is it.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Lestrade	Do you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he is innocent?" "I think that it is very probable." "There, now!" she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly at [MASK].
<name>Mr. Windibank</name>	Mr. Windibank	Holmes	"What! Had he lost his wife?" "You can understand," said [MASK] suavely, "that I extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in yours." "Of course! Very right!
<name>friend</name> (There is no proper name given in the sentence, so the answer is a guess based on the context.)	friend (There is no proper name given in the sentence, so the answer is a guess based on the context.)	Arthur	"Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more. It is so dreadful to think of our dear [MASK] in prison!"
<name>Wilson</name>	Wilson	Toller	My friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face. "Is [MASK] still drunk?" he asked. "Yes.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Boots	[MASK] had then run down the lane, and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to the highroad at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Holmes	In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes. "Let me see!" said [MASK]. "
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Whitney	I felt, however, that when [MASK] was once confined in the cab my mission was practically accomplished; and for the rest, I could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his existence.
<name>he</name>	he	James	she cried, glancing from one to the other of us, and finally, with a woman's quick intuition, fastening upon my companion, "I am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to tell you so. I know that [MASK] didn't do it.
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Jones	"Your red-headed idea was very new and effective." "You'll see your pal again presently," said [MASK]. "He's quicker at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies."
<name>Miss Mary Sutherland</name>	Miss Mary Sutherland	Watson	"Ah yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time, [MASK]. I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I did to that of your friend.
<name>Gregson</name>	Gregson	Lestrade	Good-afternoon, [MASK]! You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are cigars in the box." The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Holmes	I had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room." "My dear [MASK]!" "I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked before, which were quite as prompt.
<name>Baskerville</name>	Baskerville	Arthur	Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room. I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door. "'[MASK]!'
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Watson	The pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of shag which I had seen upon the previous night. "Awake, [MASK]?" he asked.
<name>Thoreau</name>	Thoreau	Thoreau	My whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote [MASK]'s example." "But I have heard all that you have heard."
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Holmes	All well." "Thank you!" said [MASK], folding up the paper and returning it to our visitor. "And now you must on no account lose another instant. We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me.
<name>Sarah</name>	Sarah	Julia	"You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister [MASK] and I had no great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a long time we did all the work of the house.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Holmes	"Done about the same time as the bell-rope?" remarked [MASK]. "Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time." "They seem to have been of a most interesting character--dummy bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate.
<name>Samuel</name>	Samuel	Bill	"It's merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But I'll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate." The salesman chuckled grimly. "Bring me the books, [MASK]," said he.
<name>Mr. Bingley</name>	Mr. Bingley	Holmes	"You interest me extremely," said [MASK]. "And since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way.
<name>Mr. Wopsle</name>	Mr. Wopsle	Windigate	This year our good host, [MASK] by name, instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you.
<name>her</name>	her	James	"It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or should you rather that I sent [MASK] off to bed?" "Oh, no, no!
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	China	But the writing?" "What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk?" "Well, but [MASK]?"
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Holmes	I could see that [MASK] was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching fashion, and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger-tips together, to listen to her story.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Holmes	Nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him. "Here we are!" said [MASK] cheerily as we filed into the room.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Holmes	"At least," said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the stairs, "she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself." "And she would need to be," said [MASK] gravely.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Holmes	"Indeed, Doctor," said [MASK] blandly. "Pray take a seat." "I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I have traced her. What has she been saying to you?"
<name>St. Clair</name>	St. Clair	Holmes	The furniture was scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight. [MASK] rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Holmes	There was no maker's name; but, as [MASK] had remarked, the initials "H. B." were scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Watson	Then he lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling. "I think, [MASK]," he remarked at last, "that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this."
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Holmes	"Well, I have drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found." "I think I could lay my finger on it," said [MASK] quietly.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Breckinridge	Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man [MASK]; but he had sold the lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone.
<name>Bob Cratchit</name>	Bob Cratchit	Peterson	And, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of [MASK]'s fire.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Holmes	This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him." "My dear [MASK]!" "He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect," he continued, disregarding my remonstrance. "
<name>Mr. Holmes</name>	Mr. Holmes	Holmes	[MASK] moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It was headed, "March, 1869," and beneath were the following enigmatical notices: "4th.
<name>Mr. Bingley</name>	Mr. Bingley	Holmes	"Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure." He put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him. "I had hoped," suggested [MASK], "that you would have joined us in a friendly supper."
<name>Deadman's</name>	Deadman's	Paul	There is a trap-door at the back of that building, near the corner of [MASK]'s Wharf, which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights." "What! You do not mean bodies?"
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Holmes	There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more obvious." "We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no doubt it is a little worn," our visitor answered, glancing keenly at [MASK] with his bright little eyes.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Holmes	asked [MASK], glancing up. "I should wish to." "Just look it up, then." "There is a train at half-past nine," said I, glancing over my Bradshaw.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Frank	"Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from the time when I saw [MASK] here again I just didn't know what I was doing or saying.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	HOLMES:--I	[MASK] am very anxious to consult you as to whether I should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I do not inconvenience you.
<name>Crocker</name>	Crocker	Peterson	By Jove, [MASK]!" said he, "this is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you have got?" "A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though it were putty."
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Holmes	He stood," said [MASK], "to the left of the door--that is to say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?" "Yes, he did." "And he is a man with a wooden leg?"
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	I bought this estate, which chanced to be in the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money, to make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too, and though my wife died young she left me my dear little [MASK].
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Lestrade	I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do not think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night." [MASK] laughed indulgently.
<name>The King</name>	The King	Irene	"[MASK]'s photograph!" he cried. "Certainly, if you wish it." "I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter. I have the honour to wish you a very good-morning."
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Square	And this? Ha, ha! What have we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! [MASK], too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go, they come again--of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they come from?"
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Holmes	"What on earth can be the matter with him?" I asked. "He is looking up at the numbers of the houses." "I believe that he is coming here," said [MASK], rubbing his hands. "Here?" "
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Holmes	Then he tried the various keys in the lock, but without success. No sound came from within, and at the silence [MASK]' face clouded over. "I trust that we are not too late," said he.
<name>Mr. Henry Baker</name>	Mr. Henry Baker	Watson	And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would not have missed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell, [MASK], and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client.
<name>Grim</name>	Grim	Carlo	"I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness. "'Don't be frightened,' said my employer, laughing at the start which I had given. 'It's only [MASK], my mastiff.
<name>Japan</name>	Japan	China	That trick of staining the fishes' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to [MASK]. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple."
<name>John</name>	John	Toller	I call him mine, but really old [MASK], my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as keen as mustard.
<name>Sherlock Holmes</name>	Sherlock Holmes	Holmes	"The law cannot, as you say, touch you," said [MASK], unlocking and throwing open the door, "yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Hatherley	"That's it!" cried [MASK], in intense excitement. "There is the gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That second window is the one that I jumped from."
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Holmes	"It has been in some points a singular case," said [MASK], flicking the horse on into a gallop. "I confess that I have been as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all."
<name>the old man</name>	the old man	Holmes	"Well, it is not for me to judge you," said [MASK] as the old man signed the statement which had been drawn out. "I pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation." "I pray not, sir.
<name>Murray</name>	Murray	Jones	I thought it as well to have [MASK] with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Holmes	"I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It would break her heart--it will break her heart when she hears that I am arrested." "It may not come to that," said [MASK]. "What?"
<name>Irene</name>	Irene	Holmes	And why did you wish to see me?" He looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered. "Yes," said [MASK], answering the look rather than the words. "It is so.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Holmes	[MASK] shook his head gravely. "It would cease to be a danger if we could define it," said he. "But at any time, day or night, a telegram would bring me down to your help." "That is enough."
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	McCarthy	Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past. All was going well when [MASK] laid his grip upon me.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Watson	The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord. "What do you make of that, [MASK]?"
<name>Mr. Holmes</name>	Mr. Holmes	Holmes	We called at the door, when the maid, at [MASK]' request, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the son's, though not the pair which he had then had.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Hullo	[MASK]! Colonel! Let me out!' "And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Holmes	[MASK] shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied. "These are very deep waters," said he; "pray go on with your narrative." "Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever.
<name>she</name>	she	Alice	There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew worse as [MASK] grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Holmes	"Pray compose yourself, sir," said [MASK], "and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you." "My name," answered our visitor, "is probably familiar to your ears.
<name>Stangerson</name>	Stangerson	Lestrade	What do you mean?" "Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other." [MASK] shot an angry glance at my companion. "I suppose you know all about it," he snarled. "
<name>The lawyer</name>	The lawyer	Holmes	The banker's dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. [MASK] went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock. "Which key was used to open it?"
<name>Mrs. Hudson</name>	Mrs. Hudson	Holmes	"You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented a position." "I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have been shamefully used." "I think that I heard a ring," said [MASK].
<name>someone</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	someone (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	Holmes	So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them." "And your father?" asked [MASK]. "Was he in favour of such a union?" "No, he was averse to it also.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Helen	[MASK]! It was the band! The speckled band!' There was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor's room, but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words.
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Holmes	I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered. "Good-morning, madam," said [MASK] cheerily.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Holmes	My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month. Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol." [MASK] rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him. "
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Watson	We have a housekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way." "Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, [MASK]?" "By no means." "Then we shall both come.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Watson	Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey. Briefly, [MASK], I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as I have done before now.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Frank	[MASK] said that he would go and make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Holmes	"I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime." "It was very nice and complimentary of you," [MASK] answered. "It is entirely a question of barometric pressure."
<name>George</name>	George	Jove	By [MASK]!" he continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man's face, "it is not part of my duties to my client, but here's a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treat myself to--"
<name>someone</name>	someone	Flora	It is thought that [MASK] decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her." "Well, it is a possible supposition." "You think so, too?" "I did not say a probable one.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Holmes	It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly finished when [MASK] returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse. "I want to test a little theory of mine," said he, pulling on his boots.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Holmes	I rose to go, but [MASK] caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair. "It is both, or none," said he. "You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me."
<name>John</name>	John	Ryder	Then, when he had left, you rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man arrested. You then--" [MASK] threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion's knees.
<name>her</name> (Note: There is no proper name in this sentence, the answer is a pronoun)	her (Note: There is no proper name in this sentence, the answer is a pronoun)	Holmes	With a few grateful words to [MASK] she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her way. "At least," said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the stairs, "she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself."
<name>John</name>	John	Norton	But to whom?" "To an English lawyer named [MASK]." "But she could not love him." "I am in hopes that she does." "And why in hopes?" "Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Lestrade	"I have ordered a carriage," said [MASK] as we sat over a cup of tea. "I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime."
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Holmes	We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic." "A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect," remarked [MASK].
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Jem	But the creature flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others. "'Whatever were you doing with that bird, [MASK]?'
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Holmes	I have been at work upon it all day." "And very wet it seems to have made you," said [MASK] laying his hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket. "Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine." "
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Rucastle	There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle buried in [MASK]'s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the ground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck.
<name>he</name>	he	Hosmer	Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him, there might be some reason, but [MASK] was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what could have happened?
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Holmes	interjected [MASK]. "Yes, only one." "Did you observe the colour?" "Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the carriage. It was a chestnut." "Tired-looking or fresh?"
<name>Baskerville</name>	Baskerville	Watson	He was in a pitiable state of reaction, with every nerve in a twitter. "I say, [MASK], what o'clock is it?" "Nearly eleven." "Of what day?" "Of Friday, June 19th." "Good heavens!
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Holmes	This is very interesting. You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is." "How very absurd! I never noticed that before." "Very strange!" muttered [MASK], pulling at the rope.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Holmes	Pray tell me in what way I can reward you. This ring--" He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand. "Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly," said [MASK].
<name>Sherlock Holmes</name>	Sherlock Holmes	Holmes	" "No crime, but a very great error has been committed," said [MASK]. "You would have done better to have trusted your wife." "It was not the wife; it was the children," groaned the prisoner.
<name>John</name>	John	Arthur	I sent the house-maid for the police and put the investigation into their hands at once. When the inspector and a constable entered the house, [MASK], who had stood sullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft.
<name>Dr. Livesey</name>	Dr. Livesey	Holmes	"Your own deathbeds, when they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine." Tottering and shaking in all his giant frame, he stumbled slowly from the room. "God help us!" said [MASK] after a long silence.
