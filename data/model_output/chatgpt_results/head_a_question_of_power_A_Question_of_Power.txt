<name>the young girl</name>	the young girl	Elizabeth	Like the young girl opposite her, [MASK] had no experience of love, but she had powerful imaginings about it; it’s quality and beauty were like a deep, hidden symphony in her heart. ‘There’s something haunting me,’ she said, slowly.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Africans	You never really liked [MASK]. You only pretended to. You have no place here. Why don’t you go away She was choking for air. The clerk told her to sit down opposite him. A loud wail of counter-protest was arising in her.
<name>her</name>	her	Elizabeth	She looked at [MASK] and said calmly: ‘You know you are going to die. The day you die you must take your son with you, because we don’t want him here either.’ They stared at each other, lost in a death-grip struggle.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Jimmy	She heard the other small boy set up a loud argument with his mother in the kitchen. He was very domineering. He moaned: ‘You haven’t any lunch for me, and I’m so hungry.’ ‘Lunch will be ready in a few minutes, [MASK],’ his mother said.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Eugene	But a borehole for underground water had been drilled for the local-industries project, and since the gardeners were racing ahead with their work, [MASK] had spent the whole day digging a trench that would bring a water-pipe into the garden.
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Dan	She was a specialist in sex. A symbol went hand in hand with her, a small sewing machine with a handle. ‘She can go with a man the whole night and feel no ill effects the next day, provided you stimulate her properly,’ [MASK] explained.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Dan	It seemed as though, now, she spent hours and hours undoing the links that bound her to [MASK], whereas at one time it had been a fierce, forever relationship with wonderful music and fantastic thrills and sensations.
<name>The woman</name>	The woman	Elizabeth	She says she will bring the child with her, so I’ll give you your injection after visiting time. Eat your food now.’ [MASK] moved to sit up. Her head exploded with pain. ‘Do you have any Aspro?’ she asked.
<name>Atlantis</name>	Atlantis	Sello	[MASK] had admitted to a thousand evils, but in a dim past, in civilizations of which there were no records left, because the order of that day had been a state where the power of the spirit had been openly used and misused and everything had ended in explosions.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Batswana	A loud wail of counter-protest was arising in her. The insistent hissing was mean, stifling, vicious. Whom could she accuse, to end it? She sprang to her feet, slamming the chair back against the wall and shouted: ‘Oh, you bloody bastard [MASK]!
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Elizabeth	I want to bring up my children.’ He looked at [MASK], with a sudden flash of humour. ‘I’m very old, you know, in my soul. I have completed a billion cycles in my destiny. You are only two.’
<name>her</name>	her	Elizabeth	He leaned forward, his hands on his knees, his head bent deep in thought. Then he said, aloud to himself: ‘How can I draw her?’ He stood up and looked quietly at [MASK].
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Elizabeth	She raised a hand to her mouth to stifle a loud giggle. [MASK] was ten years older than he. Suddenly she could place him. He looked exactly like the small boy who harassed her life with questions about goats falling off the edge of the earth.
<name>Trisha</name>	Trisha	Elizabeth	Don’t you think that’s charming?’ [MASK] struggled to switch off the endless battery of chatter hitting her head and thought with adoring longing of the young boy, Small-Boy, who had started imparting information with an air of quiet, authoritative, manly calm.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Elizabeth	Then she shaped her mouth into a yap: ‘Here’s the last of them,’ and the black bolt came hurtling towards [MASK]. It was about to explode in her face. She put both hands before her and jerked wide awake with a scream.
<name>God</name>	God	Africans	People in her daily life were vividly reintroduced through imagery at night. In almost every way she had sighted somebody. In almost every way she had to be aware of [MASK] as a special holy entity and deep mystery he alone understood. He too was a deep mystery she would never fathom.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Tom	That whole day, work had moved on a high tide. The local-industries project had suddenly burst out into a hive of activity. She stood by the sink and laughed: ‘You know, [MASK],’ she said.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Camilla	[MASK] had to be included even though she was a pain in the blessed neck. She pushed open the small gate at the entrance to the garden. Three students tended it, bent down, silently absorbed in their work. They wore green overalls.
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Elizabeth	All day long, [MASK] had brooded. There was a blinding sense of light and liberation in her head. She had hung over a cliff of death and obliteration and had been flung back into life again. It was a life that flowed softly, with its own slow, weaving, gentle pattern.
<name>God</name>	God	Sello	Something was giving way. The pain in her chest subsided. The storm in her head subsided. She actually felt a sensation of being lifted and flung clear out of purgatory. In one jubilant shout of joy she swung around to [MASK] with outstretched hands: ‘Thank you!
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Medusa	That’s why I broke down. It’s [MASK]. She scared me from the first moment I saw her. She’s unlike any other woman I’ve seen in my life before. She’s haughty, arrogant, and there’s some awful things unfolding here ...
<name>she</name>	she	Birgette	That will be my magical formula. I’ll hear you and turn away from the darkness. Will you do that for me?’ Without pausing to consider the matter, [MASK] nodded her head and said: ‘I will.’
<name>he</name>	he	Tom	His was the sort of friendship where anything had been and could be discussed without creating embarrassment and so demented was she by the torture of these obscene hisses that when [MASK] next called around she actually turned to him and asked:
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Sello	[MASK] said to her at that time: ‘They took you and threw you into a deep pit of cockroaches and left you to die. So I took hold of one of them and threw him alive to the worms.’ Something had been churning over in his mind.
<name>The narrator</name>	The narrator	Sello	She raised one hand wearily and said: ‘This is a terrible country to live in. You just dry up and die inside. I feel as if I had died a long time ago.’ [MASK] was never explicit about this ‘killing’ business.
<name>Joshu</name>	Joshu	Sello	As she tried to stand, they wobbled like rubber. She fell down on her knees and began crawling across the floor. The chair on which [MASK], the monk, eternally sat, was in her son’s room. She crawled to the chair and looked up.
<name>Carlyle</name>	Carlyle	Tom	I went out and talked it over with a man who was greater than I and he said to me: “[MASK], take that feeling into life among people. It serves on good purpose in a mystery. You test its strength in the battlefield.”
<name>Patrick</name>	Patrick	Dan	She lay staring at the point she dozed off. [MASK]’s hand moved towards her head again. He held in his hand the broken off end of a bottle. He lifted it and bashed it again and again into her head with a wild frenzy.
<name>spark</name>	spark	Hitler	He looked down at her surprised: ‘Of course,’ he said. ‘That’s the slogan.’ ‘I don’t like it,’ she said, angrily. ‘It only needs a [MASK] to cause an explosion.’ ‘What!’
<name>she</name>	she	Elizabeth	‘You don’t seem to get along with the local people,’ he observed. ‘It’s not that,’ [MASK] said, anxiously. ‘People don’t care here whether foreigners get along with them or not. They are deeply absorbed in each other.’
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Elizabeth	Some of the cool drops fell on [MASK]. She could feel them like icy drops on her feverish body and soul. That was supposed to heal her. A part of her mind which was still a free observer of all this laughed with silent contempt.
<name>Leo</name>	Leo	Sello	He said to himself that evening: ‘I might have died before I found this freedom of heart.’ That was another perfect statement, to him - love was freedom of heart. The man’s name was [MASK]. A woman in the village of Motabeng paralleled his inner development.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Tom	He stretched out his bowl: ‘Any more of this delicious stew?’ he asked anxiously. Without any interruption in his eating, [MASK] hurled a spoonful of stew from his plate into the boy’s bowl. The boy did not budge.
<name>Dr. John</name>	Dr. John	Sello	For she thought that the nurse had left the room some time ago, yet there was still a white form standing beside her bed. She raised her head a little. It was [MASK]. There was a still, remote look in his face.
<name>strangers</name>	strangers	Kenosi	The footsteps, the anxious whispers topped at the gate. She heard them. ‘What shall we do? What shall we do?’ they said. Like [MASK], they stared in silent indecision at the house and retreated.
<name>He</name>	He	Sello	She sat up half the night. The insects brooded to themselves outside about the summer that was over now and the provisions they had made for winter. [MASK] kept on saying something. His voice sounded like the brooding insects because he talked so softly.
<name>black</name>	black	African	He jumped like that to the universal all-embracing past of love where, apparently, it had not mattered if they were separate races or not, as they were now - he was [MASK], she was mixed breed. What a plague that was!
<name>Sello</name>	Sello	Elizabeth	A coffin was carried into her room. In it was the Sello of the brown suit with his narrow, mean eyes. Six people carried the coffin. Four of them were women who kept their faces turned away from [MASK].
<name>Persephone</name>	Persephone	Dan	[MASK] shouted and dragged him away. She made a comparison between the two scenes. The man who had declared to her that he was the King of the Underworld had said it with the triumph of one who had brought all evil under his control.
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Sello	That captured and riveted my attention. It was [MASK]. It seemed to me that his job was religion itself, because he moved towards me like that, then right in front of my eyes did a slow, spiritual strip-tease act.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Elizabeth	They just walk in and smash everything up and then they grin .. ‘Why don’t you find a husband, [MASK]?’ he asked. ‘It would be a defence. You are attacked because you are too alone.’
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Elizabeth	He’s from farmer’s side. One of the farmers told me he was sleeping in the dormitory with them. He came on Christmas day.’ ‘Won’t you come in for some tea first?’ [MASK] asked.
<name>Voldemort</name>	Voldemort	Medusa	‘I’ll strangle it to death with evil,’ he seemed to say throughout that long year. Because at the end of it - the hideous display of [MASK]’s power - he sat in death, incapable of thought, feeling, movement.
<name>God</name>	God	Sello	She felt as normal and ordinary as other people, yet she had nearly been killed in this rigmarole of hell. Funny thing, though, she really adored [MASK], as though they were two companions who shared a permanent joke.
<name>Siddhartha</name>	Siddhartha	Dan	By contrast, [MASK] bent humbly down, he folded his hands softly in front of him, his face wore a sad, still expression: ‘You see,’ it said. ‘That’s the essence of me. In my soul I am the monk.
<name>Mrs. Danvers</name>	Mrs. Danvers	Medusa	By night she lay back, a pinned down victim of approaching death. [MASK] had the air of one performing a skilled and practiced murder. She seemed to say to herself: ‘I’ll let loose another bolt here. I’ll let loose another bolt there.
<name>Medusa</name>	Medusa	Elizabeth	She had a way of shaping them into round balls, raising her arms in a wide, swinging movement, and hurling them straight at [MASK]. They exploded against her like lightning bolts. She often slipped into black unconsciousness and awoke later with a roaring headache.
<name>HAL</name>	HAL	Sello	‘Come on,’ he said wildly. ‘Let go of him. You’re holding on to his self-control. Let go. Let go.’ A filament-like umbilical cord suddenly appeared. Attached to the other end was [MASK].
<name>her</name>	her	Medusa	He kept on looking hopefully at [MASK]. Oh no, she simply wanted to be the manager of the African continent with everyone she found disagreeable - out. He fell back on a haggard pose, shrinking and shrinking in size until his monk’s cloth began to flap on his person like a scarecrow’s rags.
<name>she</name>	she	Dan	My whole life is my pissing vehicle. You’re like that too. You’re just pretending.’ It was as if people, ordinary normal people, lost their privacies to her. Two men gave her a lift that day into town when [MASK] turned on his homosexual record.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Elizabeth	He looked at [MASK] with intense sadness and said: ‘From now onwards your comings and goings are your own affair,’ then he turned aside and said in a voice full of tears: ‘I can still count my treasures.’
<name>Patrice Lumumba</name>	Patrice Lumumba	Sello	‘I am not a tribal African. If I had been, I would have known the exact truth about [MASK], whether he was good or bad. There aren’t any secrets among tribal Africans. I was shut out from the everyday affairs of this world.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Elizabeth	It was like falling into deep, warm waters, lazily raising one hand and resting in a heaven of bliss. Then she looked at [MASK] and smiled, a mocking superior smile: ‘You haven’t got anything near that, have you?’
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Elizabeth	There was a little clearing ahead, then the protection of the shady trees. She couldn’t endure the nature walk with Rattle-tongue. The whole front area of the house seemed deserted. She started across the clearing. Half way across she heard a shrill cry: ‘[MASK]!’
<name>Someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Tom	They were not mad enough to start working for no money; poor people liked money. [MASK] had started digging out the trench-beds of the garden. They had to be dug down to a depth of two feet and then refilled with a blending of manure, soil, and fertilizer.
<name>Houdini</name>	Houdini	Dan	A beautiful pale pink blossom lay in it. It seemed to create the atmosphere for his next move (She was to find that [MASK] was a great one for the right atmosphere and lighting effects). He grasped her firmly and sped away back along the path of the meteor.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Tom	Soon she returned and said: ‘He refuses to go. He says he must see you. He say she can bring you anything you need. He says he is your friend.’ Suddenly getting rid of [MASK] seemed to be a life and death issue to her.
<name>religion</name>	religion	Sello	And over the centuries, throughout all his incarnations, he had worked at science, till he became expert in his chosen field. Then the same process applied to [MASK]. He had chosen religion. It provided as well, a tentative solution for the prophecies that appeared to have accompanied him, even here.
<name>Peter</name>	Peter	Tom	[MASK] always did that so that the door would open and he could fly straight into the house. He never really seemed to walk, he was so light on his feet that his boots barely touched the ground, and he was always in a tremendous hurry.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Elizabeth	Who knows everything around here? I do. Who’s wearing the pants in this house? I am.’ She seemed to fill all their requirements. Then he turned and showed [MASK] a small, round, deep opening in the earth from which her soul had emerged.
<name>The narrator</name>	The narrator	Elizabeth	She said: ‘If you want to show me where you keep the things, I’ll make the tea. Don’t you worry. You just sit down. You look so poorly.’ [MASK] sat back. Nothing was the same.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Elizabeth	‘Here’s my Landrover,’ she said, pointing to the vehicle under a big tree. ‘I can do all that for you in half an hour.’ [MASK] looked at her with anguish. Human relationships with her were starkly black and white.
<name>dear</name>	dear	Eugene	‘Your son isn’t here. He’s out playing in the fields or somewhere with our son. They’ll be home about twelve and you can wait here if you like.’ ‘I’ll make some tea, [MASK],’ his wife said, rising.
<name>justice</name>	justice	Sello	Other nations, harsh climates, high peaks of endeavour and suffering had shaped her soul. Their soul-communication to her and [MASK] was terribly important - that people who have suffered from the wanton cruelty of others prefer the truth at all times, no matter what it might cost them.
<name>Albert</name>	Albert	Tom	[MASK] had been a permanent fixture in her life since the first day they’d met. They soon began imagining they were solving all the problems of the universe together, and it was their habit to sit for hours, heads bent, working away at deep philosophical problems.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Camilla	It was [MASK]. ‘Anyone playing dice around here?’ she shrilled. She came speeding towards them, her eyes, her hands, her walk creating a turmoil of distraction, shattering the sleepy, murmuring peace of the garden. All life had to stop and turn towards her.
<name>Donnie</name>	Donnie	Sello	I don’t know so well. And you know [MASK]? He has a terrible Medusa hidden away in his subconscious. She’s so real to me that I live in terror of her all my days. That’s why I broke down.
<name>flasher</name>	flasher	Dan	In the early morning, she sped down a dusty road, greeting any passer-by with an exuberant shout of joy. So infectious was her happiness that they responded with spontaneous smiles. The panic-stricken [MASK] pulled up his pants too late.
<name>a panther</name>	a panther	Sello	He was laughing and happy at the same time, as though he were saying silently: ‘Fancy meeting you here, Comrade.’ There was a feeling of restless energy about him, and like [MASK] he had an unconscious habit.
<name>The Womb</name>	The Womb	Dan	There was [MASK]. His soul needed something ethereal. In sailed The Womb. She walked with her pelvis thrust forward and her feet shuffled in a jazzy rhythm along the floor. The ethereal part of it was that he was standing this time behind a curtain of light to welcome her.
<name>Mma Ramotswe</name>	Mma Ramotswe	Elizabeth	‘Where’s your nose?’ [MASK] asked, smiling. The odour of the herbs and spices in the stew filled the whole house. People made unlikely friendships on the Motabeng projects. First they were thrown together through work. Then, everyone talked English of some kind.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Blabbermouth	I’ll show you. It’s quite easy.’ And how important their secret rituals were to them! They said: ‘Who dunnit? Who spilled the beans?’ And someone always said: ‘[MASK].’
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Elizabeth	Out of the corner of one eye [MASK] watched, utterly fascinated, as she ate her food. She broke it up into small pieces and put it daintily into her mouth with the fork. Then she made distinct, sucking noises as she chewed, the way cats do.
<name>Nipper</name>	Nipper	Elizabeth	‘I’m just waiting for my date,’ she said. The date dimmed the lights. He seemed to think this was getting a bit too much, even for the Coloured dog, [MASK], because the next morning he turned on a softer record.
<name>darling</name>	darling	Elizabeth	‘You are bad,’ she commented crossly. ‘He read your letter and started to cry. Here’s his letter.’ ‘I’ll see you again, [MASK],’ it said, defiantly. She pushed her face into the pillow and howled.
<name>fire</name>	fire	Dan	People always died in the bush, at the rate of two or three a month. It was full of wild animals and dangerous snakes. But this? She began to believe her own nightmare. It was a combination of [MASK] and the hidden, molten lava.
<name>the tap</name>	the tap	Elizabeth	It was a garden that watered itself the whole day long, once the central tap was turned on. Next to [MASK] was a bed of the most gigantic cabbage she had ever seen in her life before. She stared in wonder at the nearest, full-moon face.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Dan	The persistent picking on people she met in her daily life totally demoralized her, as though [MASK] were saying: ‘You see, your eyes are my eyes, but I know and see more than you.’ He was the great informant on hidden things.
<name>darling</name>	darling	Tom	‘When?’ ‘I don’t know, [MASK]. I don’t feel well.’ ‘You’ll be all right soon. You’ll find a day when everything looks fine. You needn’t care a damn about what people think. They forget.
<name>Max</name>	Max	Dan	But how much more often have I?’ No details were ever to unfold of her past relationship with [MASK], but they had already unfolded of her relationship with ‘the Father’. This had made no direct, possessive impact on her mind because of his basic personality.
<name>her</name>	her	Elizabeth	She glanced at his companion, briefly. He had pretty eyes, large, luminous, black, with a thick cluster of lashes. His eyes gave his face a wonderful expression of innocence and friendliness. He immediately bowed his head to [MASK] in silent greeting.
<name>Clinton</name>	Clinton	Elizabeth	‘The people’ are never going to rise above the status of ‘the people’. They are going to be told what is good for them by the ‘mother’ and the ‘father’. And she made the wrong kinds of attacks on [MASK].
<name>speechless</name>	speechless	Tom	But you know. What about the arrogance of the soul, its wild flaring over its overwhelming lust for dominance and prestige? Don’t you know all that, the spring, then the river, then the ocean of horror?” I was stunned, [MASK].
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Elizabeth	‘It’s a particular dream of a particular man, catering for freaks. People who think of others before themselves are freaks. The world is full of hatred ...’ Almost blindly [MASK] moved to set the food and plates on the table.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Sello	Just at this time, too, a man sidled up to her and put the most impossible question of all: ‘Can you tell me something about [MASK]?’ he said. ‘He doesn’t like his own nation at all. He likes your kind of nation.’
<name>Gollum</name>	Gollum	Buddha	He said of [MASK]: ‘He refused to live again. I had to use evil to draw him back to life again. I had work to do, and there was no one who could work with me like you can. We shared everything.
<name>prejudice</name>	prejudice	Dan	She simply meant she wanted parents who did not believe in prophecies. They boiled down to bugger all, and they made a normal, happy person, who loved birds, insects, vegetable gardens, and people, the victim of [MASK]. He was laughing.
<name>Pink Sugar-Icing</name>	Pink Sugar-Icing	Elizabeth	He told [MASK] he supported a lot of poor relatives, and the girl’s income from her rich parents would ease his burden. Pink Sugar-Icing had no physical specialties, except that to go with her was like eating sponge cake with pink sugar-icing; that was her symbol.
<name>Meg</name>	Meg	Elizabeth	‘The water will run down the drain instead of through the garden.’ ‘I can do it,’ she said. She sat looking at [MASK] with her inscrutable expression. ‘What’s wrong with you?’ she asked at last.
<name>Kagome</name>	Kagome	Kenosi	As the sun set, like a blaze of hellfire on the horizon, they parted. [MASK] turned once, clasped both hands together, made a short curtsey and said: Thank you for the food,’ then padded away quietly to her home in the distance.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Elizabeth	At this point, she’d begin to doze, nodding and nodding her head until a particularly violent nod jerked her wide awake again. She’d look at [MASK], slap her hands on her knees, throw back her head and roar with laugher.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Tom	‘[MASK]!’ she shouted. In a second life swirled around her. The heavy boots twinkled up the pathway. He paused at the door, beaming. ‘I’d just heard you were back and came rushing over,’ he said. She burst out laughing.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Africans	From that moment her eyes remained riveted to his face and she began pitching and heaving mentally in a crescendo of torture. The insistent hiss, hiss of horror swamped her mind: ‘You see,’ it said. ‘You don’t really like [MASK].
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Elizabeth	She had an exciting way of walking. Her thighs rubbed against each other like the rustle of silk against silk. She stopped a few paces from [MASK] and rose into the air. She said: ‘I am greater than you in goodness.’
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Elizabeth	If you’re not careful you’ll get insane just like your mother. Your mother was a white woman. They had to lock her up, as she was having a child by the stable boy, who was a native.’ [MASK] started to cry, through sheer nervous shock.
<name>Ed</name>	Ed	Elizabeth	He stopped abruptly and looked up at the laughing women, then he turned eagerly towards [MASK] and said: ‘Hell, Ed like to learn that job. I don’t know how to thatch.’ He shouted back at the women: ‘Em coming.’
<name>Migraine</name>	Migraine	Elizabeth	She had a lot more thunderbolts in reserve, none as painful and deadly as her first blast, but each time they hit her, [MASK] would topple over, collapse, and remain in bed for two days on end. Even if she wanted to, she could not retaliate in any way.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Sello	That was really the beautiful thing about him - he loved children. Neither did his racialism extend to a black man who was also the father of children. He turned to her and said: I don’t like what you said about the man, [MASK].
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Shorty	‘I’ll be here every day.’ The odour of frying kidneys filled the house. He sliced up the salad and tomatoes into a bowl. [MASK] opened the door and crept into the house. They were both hungry after their outdoor chores.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Elizabeth	He was made to expose everything. The flesh of her private parts had a raw, red look as though the surface skin had been rubbed off by many hands. Like a small child wetting her pants, she had an orgasm right on top of [MASK].
