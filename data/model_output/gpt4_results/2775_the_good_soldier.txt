<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Edward	Her aunt said incessantly: "You must save [MASK]'s life; you must save his life. All that he needs is a little period of satisfaction from you. Then he will tire of you as he has of the others. But you must save his life."
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Leonora	And, since these dinners were rather expensive (you had to take the Grand Duke and a good many of his suite and any members of the diplomatic bodies that might be there)--Florence and [MASK], putting their heads together, didn't see why we shouldn't give the Grand Duke his dinner together.
<name>Don Quixote</name>	Don Quixote	Lohengrin	There would not be room for it--along those lines." "Well," I said, "then he must really be [MASK] and the Cid in one body. For there are not any other lines that count." Again she looked at me for a long time.
<name>Thérèse</name>	Thérèse	Nancy	And, since this rule appeared to be idiotic and arbitrary, she broke it on purpose day after day. In the evening the children were all asked if they had committed any faults during the day, and every evening [MASK] confessed that she had broken this particular rule.
<name>Mrs. Gummidge</name>	Mrs. Gummidge	Florence	For [MASK], if you please, gaining in time a more composed view of nature, and overcome by her habits of garrulity, arrived at a frame of mind in which she found it almost necessary to tell me all about it--nothing less than that.
<name>success</name>	success	Florence	They told me, I think, almost more than I have ever gathered at any one moment--about myself. I don't think that before that day I had ever wanted anything very much except [MASK]. I have, of course, had appetites, impatiences...
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Leonora	You can be. I have no use for him." That was really a calamity for [MASK], because, once started, there was no stopping the talking. She tried to stop--but it was not to be done.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Edward	At any rate, it was over the question of the chapel that they had their first and really disastrous quarrel. [MASK] at that time was not well; he supposed himself to be overworked with his regimental affairs--he was managing the mess at the time.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Leonora	But of more than that he had been totally unconscious. Had he been conscious of it, he assured me, he would have fled from it as from a thing accursed. He realized that it was the last outrage upon [MASK]. But the real point was his entire unconsciousness.
<name>Godfrey</name>	Godfrey	Edward	I have told you, I think, that [MASK] spent a great deal of time, and about two hundred pounds for law fees on getting a poor girl, the daughter of one of his gardeners, acquitted of a charge of murdering her baby.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Florence	That would be just like [MASK]. In all matrimonial associations there is, I believe, one constant factor--a desire to deceive the person with whom one lives as to some weak spot in one's character or in one's career.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Leonora	There was dimly to be seen, above a mantelpiece encumbered with spurs, hooves and bronze models of horses, a dark-brown picture of a white horse. "If you think," [MASK] said, "that I do not know that you are in love with the girl..."
<name>Susy</name>	Susy	Leonora	PART III I THE odd thing is that what sticks out in my recollection of the rest of that evening was [MASK]'s saying: "Of course you might marry her," and, when I asked whom, she answered: "The girl."
<name>Tristram</name>	Tristram	Edward	With [MASK] it was fatal. For, such was his honourable nature, that for him to enjoy a woman's favours made him feel that she had a bond on him for life. That was the way it worked out in practice.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Edward	worked out in the extinction of two very splendid personalities--for [MASK] and the girl were splendid personalities, in order that a third personality, more normal, should have, after a long period of trouble, a quiet, comfortable, good time.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Leonora	"That man," said [MASK], with an extraordinary bitterness, "would give the shirt off his back and off mine--and off yours to any..." She could not finish the sentence. At that moment she had been feeling an extraordinary hatred and contempt for her husband.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Florence	For peace I never had with [MASK], and hardly believe that I cared for her in the way of love after a year or two of it. She became for me a rare and fragile object, something burdensome, but very frail.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Leonora	Well, it was just that look that I noticed in his eyes: "It might," I seem even now to hear him muttering to himself, "just be done." I looked round over my shoulder and saw, tall, smiling brilliantly and buoyant--[MASK].
<name>Fleur</name>	Fleur	Leonora	All these things, and the continuance of them seemed to him to be his duty--along with impossible subscriptions to hospitals and Boy Scouts and to provide prizes at cattle shows and antivivisection societies.... Well, [MASK] saw to it that most of these things were not continued.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Florence	For my experiences there were vivid and amusing. It was exactly as if I had come out of a museum into a riotous fancy-dress ball. During my life with [MASK] I had almost come to forget that there were such things as fashions or occupations or the greed of gain.
<name>Odette</name>	Odette	Florence	But, if I never so much as kissed [MASK], she let me discover very easily, in the course of a fortnight, her simple wants. And I could supply those wants.... She wanted to marry a gentleman of leisure; she wanted a European establishment.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Leonora	You may not believe it, but he really had such a sort of respect for the chastity of [MASK]'s imagination that he hated--he was positively revolted at the thought that she should know that the sort of thing that he did existed in the world.
<name>Millicent</name>	Millicent	Florence	[MASK] had her own sitting-room. She could ask to it whom she liked, and I simply walked into that apartment. I was as timid as you will, but in that matter I was like a chicken that is determined to get across the road in front of an automobile.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Leonora	It was as if she had grown up so quickly that there had not been time to put her hair up. But she added: "We're no good--my mother and I." [MASK] said, with her fierce calmness: "No. No.
<name>Milly</name>	Milly	Florence	[MASK] once said about a very similar position--she was a little too well-bred, too American, to talk about mine--that it was a case of perfectly open riding and the woman could just act on the spur of the moment.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Leonora	Round this hall there ran a gallery upon which [MASK]'s doorway gave. And even when she had the worst of her headaches she liked to have her door open--I suppose so that she might hear the approaching footsteps of ruin and disaster.
<name>me</name>	me	Edward	In that silent watching, again, I think she was a Catholic--of a people that can think thoughts alien to ours and keep them to themselves. And the thoughts passed through her mind; some of them even got through to [MASK] with never a word spoken.
<name>moment</name>	moment	Edward	I will belong to you to save your life. But I can never love you." It was a fantastic display of cruelty. She didn't in the least know what it meant--to belong to a man. But, at that [MASK] pulled himself together.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Edward	She wanted a certain satisfaction of her appetites and [MASK] had appealed to her the night before. Now that was done with, and, quite coldly, she said that she wanted money if he was to have any more of her. It was a perfectly reasonable commercial transaction.
<name>Rosa</name>	Rosa	Florence	And it was pleasant to get out in the great big spectacular Prussian station with the hammered bronze ornaments and the paintings of peasants and flowers and cows; and to hear [MASK] bargain energetically with the driver of an ancient droschka drawn by two lean horses.
<name>With</name>	With	VI	This is all nonsense." They were baffled, those two women. And then I came on the scene. [MASK] MY coming on the scene certainly calmed things down--for the whole fortnight that intervened between my arrival and the girl's departure.
<name>Stavrogin</name>	Stavrogin	Jimmy	He was really going to ingratiate himself with me. "Do you know who that is?" he asked. "The last time I saw that girl she was coming out of the bedroom of a young man called [MASK] at five o'clock in the morning.
<name>She</name>	She	Leonora	Still, he may have had five hundred pounds a year English, for his menus plaisirs--for his regimental subscriptions and for keeping his men smart. [MASK] hated that; she would have preferred to buy dresses for herself or to have devoted the money to paying off a mortgage.
<name>John</name>	John	Edward	The fare she had provided at the dinners they gave had been much less bountiful and not nearly so costly as had been the case in preceding years, and [MASK] began to perceive a hardness and determination in his wife's character.
<name>Heinrich</name>	Heinrich	Florence	Of course, I spoke German much more correctly than [MASK], though I never could rid myself quite of the accent of the Pennsylvania Duitsch of my childhood. Anyhow, we were drawn in a sort of triumph, for five marks without any trinkgeld, right up to the castle.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Edward	She herself had never talked of the matter with either her father, her mother, or her husband. When at last her father had let drop some words leading her to believe that that was the fact, she tried desperately to extort the promise from [MASK].
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Florence	I don't mean to say that she was doing a wrong thing. She was certainly doing right in trying to warn me that [MASK] was making eyes at her husband. But, if she did the right thing, she was doing it in the wrong way.
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Florence	She drank the little phial of prussic acid and there she lay.--Oh, extremely charming and clear-cut--looking with a puzzled expression at the electric-light bulb that hung from the ceiling, or perhaps through it, to the stars above. Who knows? Anyhow, there was an end of [MASK].
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Leonora	Neither did [MASK]. I don't mean to say that this state of things continued, but there it was. I dare say it had a good deal of influence on their mentalities. At any rate, they never had a child.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Edward	And [MASK] just once tripped up, and that was his undoing. Perhaps he had had too much whisky that afternoon. She asked him perpetually what he wanted. What did he want? What did he want? And all he ever answered was: "I have told you".
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Leonora	And even when I look back, knowing the circumstances, I can't remember a single thing any of them said that could have betrayed them. I can't remember, right up to the dinner, when [MASK] read out that telegram--not the tremor of an eyelash, not the shaking of a hand.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Nancy	It is not the law of the land...." "Oh yes," [MASK] said, "the Brands are Protestants." She felt a sudden safeness descend upon her, and for an hour or so her mind was at rest.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Edward	Isn't that the queer thought? And yet, I must add that poor dear [MASK] was a great reader--he would pass hours lost in novels of a sentimental type--novels in which typewriter girls married Marquises and governesses Earls.
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Florence	I had really forgotten all about that exclamation of [MASK]'s until this moment. She treated me so very well--with such tact--that, if I ever thought of it afterwards I put it down to her deep affection for me.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Edward	She could not see why he should continue to write her long letters after their separation. After that, indeed, she had a very bad time. She had at that period what I will call the "monstrous" theory of [MASK].
<name>Lucia</name>	Lucia	Leonora	For five minutes, then, I entertained the possibility that [MASK] might be jealous; but there was never another flicker in that flame-like personality. How in the world should I get it? For, all that time, I was just a male sick nurse.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Leonora	For the trick was pretty efficiently done. [MASK], with panic growing and with contrition very large in her heart, visited every one of the public rooms of the hotel--the dining-room, the lounge, the schreibzimmer, the winter garden.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Leonora	We found her dead when we got back--pretty awful, that, when you come to figure out what it all means.... At any rate the measure of my relief when [MASK] said that she was an Irish Catholic gives you the measure of my affection for that couple.
<name>Christopher</name>	Christopher	Leonora	That had been a quite passionate affair with quite a nice woman. It had succeeded the one with the Grand Ducal lady. The lady was the wife of a brother officer and [MASK] had known all about the passion, which had been quite a real passion and had lasted for several years.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Edward	She talked to [MASK] as if she had been a solicitor with an estate to sell--perfectly quietly and perfectly coldly without any inflections in her voice. She did not want to be unkind to him; but she could see no reason for being kind to him.
<name>Heyst</name>	Heyst	Leonora	It is too little to say that the girl would have laid her life at [MASK]'s feet. Well, she laid there the offer of her virtue--and her reason. Those were sufficient instalments of her life.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Leonora	Yes, I know they have a number. I have been in communication with them before." "He is going to telephone to your mother," [MASK] said. "He will make it all right for her." She got up and closed the door.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Leonora	If there was a fine point about [MASK] it was that she was proud and that she was silent. But that pride and that silence broke when she made that extraordinary outburst, in the shadowy room that contained the Protest, and in the little terrace looking over the river.
<name>Maisie</name>	Maisie	Florence	He certainly did: he was most useful to us afterwards. But the point that came out--that there was no mistaking--was that [MASK] was coldly and calmly determined to take no look at any man who could not give her a European settlement.
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Florence	And that touching of hands, she knew, would give that woman an irrevocable claim--to be seduced. And she so despised [MASK] that she would have preferred it to be a parlour-maid. There are very decent parlour-maids.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Leonora	That he had never had to do for [MASK]. Perhaps, also, she was at first too obedient. I do not mean to say that she was submissive--that she deferred, in her judgements, to his. She did not.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Florence	It was like that--I saw [MASK] running with a face whiter than paper and her hand on the black stuff over her heart. I tell you, my own heart stood still; I tell you I could not move. She rushed in at the swing doors.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Edward	She appeared to him to be wanting in imagination--to be cold and hard. I don't exactly know what part her priests played in the tragedy that it all became; I dare say they behaved quite creditably but mistakenly. But then, who would not have been mistaken with [MASK]?
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Maisie	"Oh, I'm fond enough of you," she said. "Fond enough to say that I wish every man was like you. But there are others to be considered." She was thinking, as a matter of fact, of poor [MASK].
<name>Soames</name>	Soames	Edward	The lights from that place of entertainment must have reached them through the tree-trunks, since, [MASK] said, he could quite plainly see the girl's face--that beloved face with the high forehead, the queer mouth, the tortured eyebrows, and the direct eyes.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Leonora	" "She had better," [MASK] answered, "not say one single word against my people or my faith." It struck me at the time, that there was an unusual, an almost threatening, hardness in her voice.
<name>He</name>	He	Ashburnham	Such young things ought to have been left alone. Of course [MASK] could not leave her alone. I do not believe that he could. Why, even I, at this distance of time am aware that I am a little in love with her memory.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Leonora	Well, she left a lasting wheal, and her words cut deeply into the girl's mind.... They neither of them spoke about that again. A fortnight went by--a fortnight of deep rains, of heavy fields, of bad scent. [MASK]'s headaches seemed to have gone for good.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Leonora	She said that she quite favoured my suit; that she could not desire for the girl a better husband; but that she considered that the girl ought to see a little more of life before taking such an important step. Yes, [MASK] used the words "taking such an important step".
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Edward	And, of course, [MASK] himself had helped her a little on the financial side. He was a fellow that many men liked. He was so presentable and quite ready to lend you his cigar puncher--that sort of thing.
<name>Doolittle</name>	Doolittle	Mumford	He got to know it because it was the habit of his steward to look in on them every morning about breakfast-time to report any little happenings. And there was a farmer called [MASK] who had only paid half his rent for the last three years.
<name>Granite</name>	Granite	Steel	All the world was mad around her and she herself, agonized, took on the complexion of a mad woman; of a woman very wicked; of the villain of the piece. What would you have? [MASK] is a normal, hard, polished substance.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Nancy	And suddenly [MASK] found that she was crying. She was crying quietly; she went on to cry with long convulsive sobs. It seemed to her that everything gay, everything charming, all light, all sweetness, had gone out of life.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Leonora	She was in a white silk kimono that covered her to the feet. The clothes that she had taken off were exactly folded upon the proper seats. Her long hands were one upon each arm of the chair that had a pink and white chintz back. [MASK] told me these things.
<name>Milverton</name>	Milverton	Edward	Well, that is the end of the story. And, when I come to look at it I see that it is a happy ending with wedding bells and all. The villains--for obviously [MASK] and the girl were villains--have been punished by suicide and madness.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Leonora	That was how she figured it out to herself. She really thought that.... So [MASK] said patiently: "Very well, just put it that I killed her and that it's a painful subject. One does not like to think that one had killed someone.
<name>Quilty</name>	Quilty	Edward	The half-opened door opened noiselessly to the full. [MASK] was there. His devouring, doomed eyes were fixed on the girl's face; his shoulders slouched forward; he was undoubtedly half drunk and he had the whisky decanter in one hand, a slanting candlestick in the other.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Leonora	He shook hands smilingly with every farmer in the market-place. He addressed two political meetings; he hunted twice. [MASK] made him a frightful scene about spending the two hundred pounds on getting the gardener's daughter acquitted. Everything went on as if the girl had never existed.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Leonora	I'm sure he finds it interesting!" And [MASK] would look reflectively at her husband and say: "I have an idea that it might injure his hand--the hand, you know, used in connection with horses' mouths...."
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Leonora	I daresay ten thousand dollars covered the bill. Anyhow, there was a pretty solid hole in a fortune of a hundred thousand pounds or so. And [MASK] had to fix things up; he would have run from money-lender to money-lender.
<name>Adela</name>	Adela	Leonora	And, at hearing of the miseries her aunt had suffered--for [MASK] once more had the aspect of an aunt to the girl--with the swift cruelty of youth and, with the swift solidarity that attaches woman to woman, the girl made her resolves.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Florence	And since I could not see any special reason, they would give the verdict: "Better not, then." I daresay they were honest enough, as things go. They probably imagined that the mere associations of the steamer might have effects on [MASK]'s nerves.
<name>Therese</name>	Therese	Edward	And her confessor approved of her life, and [MASK] let her give little treats to the girls of the convent she had left, and the Reverend Mother approved of him. There could not have been a happier girl for five or six years.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Edward	And the great thing was that there should be no scandal before the congregation. So she had clung to the idea of getting [MASK] back with a fierce passion that was like an agony. She had looked the other way; she had occupied herself solely with one idea.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Leonora	She was, it was true, tall, dark, with soft mournful voice and a great kindness of manner for every created thing, from punkah men to flowers on the trees. But she was not so well read as [MASK], at any rate in learned books.
<name>she</name>	she	Florence	Yet that was the impression that I really had until just now. When I come to think of it she was out of my sight most of the time. You see, that fellow impressed upon me that what [MASK] needed most of all were sleep and privacy.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Leonora	And [MASK]'s feet she would have kissed--those two were for her the best man and the best woman on earth--and in heaven. I think that she had not a thought of evil in her head--the poor girl....
<name>Lucienne</name>	Lucienne	Leonora	"I know it," she said. "And I am dying for love of him." [MASK] uttered an "Ah," that, in spite of herself, was an "Ah" of horror and of grief.
<name>She</name>	She	Leonora	She seemed to have got hold of the clue to the riddle. Yes, [MASK] seemed to have got hold of the clue to the riddle. She imagined herself to have been in the wrong to some extent in the past.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Leonora	Precisely like one of the damned. Well, if a pretty period in hell on this earth can spare her any period of pain in Eternity--where there are not any periods--I guess [MASK] will escape hell fire.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Edward	It is true that [MASK] gurgled and raved about the girl in a way that she had never yet experienced. But that, too, was almost a relief. I think she would really have welcomed it if he could have come across the love of his life.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Edward	"I should like to go on living with you and [MASK]. I don't think I am in the way or that I am really an expense. If I went you would have to have a companion. Or, perhaps, I ought to earn my living...."
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Nancy	"I thought," [MASK] said, "I never imagined.... Aren't marriages sacraments? Aren't they indissoluble? I thought you were married. .. and..." She was sobbing. "I thought you were married or not married as you are alive or dead."
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Florence	I had no possible guide to the idea of suicide and the sight of the little flask of nitrate of amyl in [MASK]'s hand suggested instantly to my mind the idea of the failure of her heart. Nitrate of amyl, you understand, is the drug that is given to relieve sufferers from angina pectoris.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Nancy	Nevertheless, she sat in the darkness behind her half-closed jalousies, looking over the street and the night and the trees until, very late, she could hear [MASK]'s clear voice coming closer and saying: "You did look an old guy with that false nose.
<name>himself</name>	himself	Leonora	So that, when he spoke of her as being the person he cared most for in the world, she naturally thought that he meant to except [MASK] and she was just glad. It was like a father saying that he approved of a marriageable daughter...
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Florence	Now I wonder what had passed through [MASK]'s mind during the two hours that she had kept me waiting at the foot of the ladder. I would give not a little to know. Till then, I fancy she had had no settled plan in her mind.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Florence	So that that was the first knowledge I had that [MASK] had committed suicide. It had never entered my head. You may think that I had been singularly lacking in suspiciousness; you may consider me even to have been an imbecile. But consider the position.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Edward	That was how it presented itself to her. These things are a little inscrutable. I don't know why the getting back of [MASK] should have represented to her a victory for all wives, for Society and for her Church. Or, maybe, I have a glimmering of it.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Leonora	And, from that moment, that girl appeared desirable to him--and [MASK] completely unattractive. He began to indulge in day-dreams in which he approached the nurse-maid more tactfully and carried the matter much further.
<name>Millicent</name>	Millicent	Leonora	[MASK] says that she had that flask, apparently of nitrate of amyl, but actually of prussic acid, for many years and that she was determined to use it if ever I discovered the nature of her relationship with that fellow Jimmy.
<name>Trigorin</name>	Trigorin	Edward	But I think [MASK] had no idea at all of corrupting her. I believe that he simply loved her. He said that that was the way of it and I, at least, believe him and I believe too that she was the only woman he ever really loved.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Edward	She was being kissed by a gentleman. She screamed, tore herself away; sprang up and pulled a communication cord. [MASK] came fairly well out of the affair in the public estimation; but it did him, mentally, a good deal of harm.
<name>Laura</name>	Laura	Nancy	Of course you have the makings of a situation here, but it is all very humdrum, as far as I am concerned. I should marry [MASK] if her reason were ever sufficiently restored to let her appreciate the meaning of the Anglican marriage service.
<name>Stevenson</name>	Stevenson	Edward	Conventions and traditions, I suppose, work blindly but surely for the preservation of the normal type; for the extinction of proud, resolute and unusual individuals. [MASK] was the normal man, but there was too much of the sentimentalist about him; and society does not need too many sentimentalists.
