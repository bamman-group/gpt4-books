<name>Lady</name>	Lady	Cleo	the Duchess said. [MASK] sat down dumbly, though she had meant to stand, as befitting her position as a man’s wife when faced with a sporting woman. But despite herself, she was impressed by this woman’s superior status. The Duchess appraised her.
<name>Caterina Sforza</name>	Caterina Sforza	Bart	[MASK]’s centerpiece on a silver tray was a tumble of polished fruit, balanced with exquisite precision to form a horn of plenty. A large boiled lobster, its meat removed and replaced, was dramatically couched on a silver platter edged with lettuce.
<name>Jamie</name>	Jamie	Cleo	Down she went into her well of remembering . . . down . . . “[MASK]?” His voice was soft, with the little hunger behind it. His body rolled toward her. She raced like a deer for the darkness. And slept. CHAPTER 15
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Simeon	Her defense was to shut out of her mind the didactic sound of their voices. “Whatever else your father is, he’s a perfect gentleman,” she said tartly. “I don’t want to hear your specious reason,” [MASK] said agreeably.
<name>John</name>	John	Bart	She turned away from [MASK] and looked into the fire, her hands again outstretched to it, its warmth pervading her iciness, her body beginning to yield with her heart. “He had gray eyes. I guess they were the kindest eyes I ever saw.
<name>Holly</name>	Holly	Thea	“You’ll be over that feeling before Wednesday.” “I have nothing to wear Wednesday,” [MASK] said, and felt surprised at saying it. She had never been interested in clothes. She had worn the best when there was money.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Bart	“Everybody eats fish, and I don’t know another soul in this town but me a minute ago who ever put his teeth in a banana.” [MASK] let his eyes roll around in his head. His tongue darted out and made a persuasive circle of his lips.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Judy	“You see that man? Go ask him nicely to lend your mother a pencil. Tell him I want to write an address before I forget it.” [MASK] rose eagerly, feeling important, and started down the aisle.
<name>Christopher</name>	Christopher	Simeon	They were silent. They did not know whether they wanted to tell this odd boy their names or not. [MASK] stuck out his hand. He had been taught to do that. And he was used to hearing delighted murmurs at this charming display of grown-up manners.
<name>Della</name>	Della	Charity	How could I live with my conscience if I sent my own sister into a cage of lions?” [MASK]’s hand fell away. She said dully, “I’ll get me a job soon’s I can.
<name>Mr. Gatz</name>	Mr. Gatz	Victor	She asks you to give me whatever message you have for her.” [MASK] dug in his overcoat pockets, then in his suit coat pockets, and finally in the pockets of his trousers. His look was owlish.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Cleo	“I declare,” she said between gasps, “once I got through the door, I’d sure be arrested for blocking the sidewalk.” [MASK] whirled. Her eyes were no longer luminous gray. They were green. She said roughly: “Stop making fun of yourself.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Cleo	I’m her.” Behind her she heard [MASK]’s faint hiss. She knew what it meant. Who does that white man think he is coming to my house to look for a cook? Why do you want to say “sir” to white trash?
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Cleo	In a moment or two a colored maid responded to her ring. She looked at [MASK] with open-mouthed surprise, then her look became sly and secret. “Y’all come see about the house?” she asked in a conspiratorial whisper.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Cleo	“Let’s go,” he said eagerly, clapping and rubbing his hands as he did when excited. In a way he was going to show his store to his son. [MASK] looked bored and bit her lip.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Simeon	That was more of [MASK]’s odd male talk. Living here in the South End he was getting to think just like these poor darkies. Why, the South End was no longer the colored population at all. All the nice people were moving away along with all the whites.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Simeon	He half-turned. “Is there anything more to say?” “I am a Catholic, [MASK].” “Are you reminding me of your Irish grandmother? Are you going to tell me next about your Anglo-Saxon father?”
<name>Miss Fanny</name>	Miss Fanny	Judy	She had found him nodding in the easy-chair by the open window where he was on watch. [MASK] was asleep on his lap, her plump hand cupping the emblem of his trade, a gold banana that dangled from his watch chain.
<name>Undine</name>	Undine	Charity	With a fierce protective strength flowing into her, she followed swiftly after [MASK]. As she bent over her lacerated sister, a great swell of love and pity restored her heart to pulsing fife. Her voice was like a ’cello, deep, rich, dramatic.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Cleo	He felt stiff and old. “You’re my wife, [MASK]. Who else a woman got to turn to time of trouble but her husband? She was made of man’s rib. She’s part of him.” “You go on up.
<name>Lord Byron</name>	Lord Byron	Thad	Her marriage had elevated her to her husband’s higher station. White antecedence was only exploited when the daughter of bluebloods eloped with her coachman. The Duchess said: “[MASK] made my mother his mistress. He defiled her the day he sent his carriage to fetch her to his house.
<name>He</name>	He	Pennywell	But it stood to reason [MASK] wasn’t in business for his health. With goods getting scarcer and scarcer, he was selling where he’d get the most for it. These new groups could pay more for one common pin than an independent could pay for a package.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Bart	It took me these months of easy living to learn that I wish I was back down home working steady in the white folks kitchen, knowing at night I was coming home to my husband.” “A woman and man ain’t nothing apart. You mighty right,” said [MASK].
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Cleo	“Ill miss you,” she said gently, and laced the gnarled fingers in her own. [MASK] wanted to snatch her child away from this childless woman who stood among the Victorian relics of her meaningless life, and had no hope of anything but heaven.
<name>telegram</name>	telegram	Simeon	She would sleep away her sins, and rise the next morning, like a child, with a clear conscience. “There’s nothing for you to worry about. I’m sending you a message by [MASK].” She put the receiver back on the hook.
<name>Mayella</name>	Mayella	Lily	He said it was a hundred dollars.” [MASK] freed the money from the rubber band with the greatest difficulty, and began a slow and halting count, for the money kept rolling back up in her nervous hands. “Ninety-five dollars,” she finally announced.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Cleo	[MASK] was thoroughly disconcerted, for she was unprepared for the dignity of the West End Duchess. She had come for a fishwives’ brawl, and the woman before her was patrician. There was breeding in every fragile bone. “Won’t you sit down?”
<name>Father</name>	Father	Simeon	It would distress her.” She moved to the door. “Will you pick up the telephone, [MASK]? I must go.” He picked up the telephone. She heard him ask Information for the nearest Catholic Church. She opened the door and went out.
<name>Undine</name>	Undine	Cleo	There is a marble bowl in the master bedroom. The bathtub is porcelain, and so is the — ah — box. But if thirty dollars is all you can afford, I hope you will make up the difference in appreciation.” “Indeed I will,” [MASK] promised fervently.
<name>Aunt Polly</name>	Aunt Polly	Charity	But her faith was not steadfast. In a few moments smoke began to seep from around the rims of the lids. [MASK] coughed and backed away. “I declare,” she said amiably, “it’s first one thing and then another.
<name>John</name>	John	Simeon	For two years now [MASK] had struggled to keep the paper in circulation. The people who read it were not the people who could pay for subscriptions. There were only occasional ads for church socials and rooms for rent. His bills were mounting. His single helper was underpaid.
<name>home</name>	home	Serena	I’m not pretending to be a poor man. I can feed all your family for a week, two weeks, for that matter. Ill foot the bill for their stay.” “I’ll write [MASK] tomorrow,” she said dreamily.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Cleo	[MASK] fell ill. Her illness was not feigned. She, who had been so alive, lay listless in bed, her hot dry hands twitching on the sheet, the vibrant voice a thin whimper. She could neither eat nor sleep.
<name>Meg</name>	Meg	Cleo	They were always dropping down her back, scaring a scream out of her, which startled everyone else. “I’m ready,” she said hastily. “Your braid’s coming loose,” said [MASK] patiently. “Where’s your rubber band?”
<name>her mother</name>	her mother	Cleo	And once in a while in the movies or on a trolley they pressed her knee or stood too close. She was wholly revolted. Because she had no interest in school, [MASK] supposed that all of her interest was in boys.
<name>the editor</name>	the editor	Simeon	Nothing else in the paper met with their approval. Every other word was colored. That this was [MASK]’s concession to their sensibilities did not make it any more palatable. Had he used the word Negro, they would have refused to read the paper altogether.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Charity	“[MASK], pass your plate,” she said resignedly. CHAPTER TThe cousins sat at the dining-room table, too excited and too full of fruit and forbidden-before-breakfast candy to want their cereal and eggs and bacon.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Judy	That poor girl had had to leave her dying father to come here to beg me to buy her a black dress.” “Is that what [MASK] was trying to tell me? She said you bought some kind of dress. Wasn’t black, the way she was telling it.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Robert	And [MASK] was leaving town. That job hadn’t turned out as steady as the boss had promised it would. He was going to get a better one some place where folks didn’t know him and what he was used to working for.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Judy	Their diversions were so watery. What was the sense in [MASK]’s taking delight in a dog’s wagging tail if she was going to miss the greater eloquence of that woman’s wagging rear, and then look shocked when her mother talked back at it?
<name>Herbert</name>	Herbert	Simeon	The Duchess paled. She had not been unaware of the motorcar in the carriage house. She had simply had no knowledge of the direction [MASK]’s pride would take. It was a moment or two before she could trust her voice.
<name>Cassie</name>	Cassie	Simeon	He would have made a race issue out of it, and taken it to court.” “It was a race issue,” said [MASK] stolidly. “They said, ‘Nigger, let go that white woman.’ * His father looked racked.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Judy	After five years he was still enchanted with him. “Were going to live in a great big house,” said [MASK], excited by all the eyes upon her, and eager to say something important. “You got it all right?”
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Cleo	“Please,” the Duchess pressed her. “I have heard that your husband is rich, but isn’t there some small service that I am able to do for you?” “You’ve received a somewhat false impression of my husband,” [MASK] corrected gently.
<name>Ray</name>	Ray	Simeon	This description did not trouble her conscience in the least. She was determined to get a rise out of [MASK]. He was almost amused. “There are so few people who are good enough for Thea that one more hardly increases the problem of her speaking acquaintances.”
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Charity	You got a raft of people coming tonight, and a mess of cooking ahead of you. Why don’t you let us eat and get it over, so you and the girls can start?” “Bread’ll be ready time we sit down,” said [MASK].
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Cleo	[MASK] would enter softly enough, and start to bank the coal fire for the night. But the little pot-bellied stove was giving out so much cheerful warmth that it seemed a shame to leave it and go to bed.
<name>accelerate</name>	accelerate	Lily	He was trying to rid himself of the impulse before he reached her. He had never touched a woman, and he didn’t want to start now. To [MASK] his slow-paced step was the sound of doom.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Charity	You want me to come in a Mother Hubbard?” “I want you any time and any way. There’s nobody coming tonight is as good as your little finger.” But [MASK] did not hear her or did not heed her.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Cleo	All of [MASK]’s zest for life, her insatiable love of conspiracy were roused to search behind the imperial eyes. “If I had known you were colored, I wouldn’t have hit you from so many sides.
<name>him</name>	him	Simeon	They would boycott his paper. But as his wife, you would have their respect. You could help [MASK] become a great man.” “If he will have me, I will be honored to share his beliefs,” the Duchess said, with humility.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Ben	Her voice was like a ’cello, deep, rich, dramatic. “I won’t watch one of my sisters cry for any man on earth. [MASK]’s a bad lot. I say good riddance. You’ve always got a home with me.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Mary	When he was ten, he knew exactly the line his life should follow. He borrowed a word from the Bible — beget. He liked the sound of the saying, money begets money. He and [MASK] counted their savings and rented an eating house in the center of town.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Cleo	I got a good mind to call that man and tell him we’ve changed our minds.” [MASK] thought of the pickings in her purse, and of her sisters, who were waiting, unknowingly, to be sent for. “No,” she said violently.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Cleo	“What are you going to tell your lady tomorrow?” “I guess I won’t go back. I kinda hate to face her. I guess I’ll go to the agency tomorrow.” Her eyes implored [MASK] not to be harsh.
<name>Macy</name>	Macy	Bart	She was not working anywhere. In the last slow years in [MASK]’s store her skills had slowed down, too. She made mistakes in totaling, garbled messages, mislaid mail. She lost the assurance of being indispensable that a successful business had given her.
<name>Carraway</name>	Carraway	Cleo	I guess she saw I was a fool, too, and made up her mind not to be like me.” “Well, all I ask you,” said [MASK] briskly, “is not to be a fool tonight. Not a soul coming is going to bite.”
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Serena	Writing wore him out, and with the house well-nigh his, he didn’t want to lose it sleeping on the job. [MASK] had been torn between believing him and knowing he was lying. Knowing there was shame and torment in every line.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Cleo	“I thought I was all alone with a dead man.” “You take the cake,” [MASK] admitted, with a weary shake of the head. “What are you going to tell your lady tomorrow?” “I guess I won’t go back.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Serena	[MASK] was not herself. She did not even look the same. The dimples never showed in her too thin cheeks. The smudges under her eyes, the deepening lines from nose to mouth, the hollow in her throat were an unlikeness to her old self.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Serena	All of her sisters were as blind as bats when it came to their husbands. They loved them. What could they find in them to love? Not a man among them was a decent provider; [MASK] and Charity worked in service whenever times were harder than usual.
<name>Matilda</name>	Matilda	Charity	“I’m not going to stir till you eat every scrap.” As [MASK] reluctantly ate the huge breakfast, sometimes stopping for a sob, sometimes lying back to keep her stomach steady, the hot food was like a heating pad on her pain.
<name>fighting</name>	fighting	Vicky	In the first few weeks of the tremendous adventure of three little colored girls walking unattended in a largely Irish neighborhood, there was a daily battle. It began the moment the marching children left their formation outside the school gate and coalesced into a circle for [MASK] and whatever bigger girl or boy had made her maddest.
<name>Mrs. Hudson</name>	Mrs. Hudson	Cleo	I’m really reluctant to walk in my neighborhood. There is drunkenness everywhere and vulgar talk. We’d like to move in as soon as possible.” “The flat is quite ready whenever you are,” [MASK] said graciously. “We live very quietly.
<name>Dinah</name>	Dinah	Simeon	A time must come when the needs of the poor would take precedence over his pride. [MASK] was converting her. And there was beginning to grow in her the tremulous hope that she might convert him. She would wait until he had learned to love her.
<name>strangers</name>	strangers	Cleo	They had almost forgotten what it was like not to live together. As young as they were, five months had seemed like five years. They had decided, after giving the matter much thought, to bring up themselves. They did not want to be brought up by teachers and [MASK].
<name>John</name>	John	Simeon	In this strange room, with this woman who was almost a stranger, he felt a peace he had never before experienced. He felt close to something he could not identify. In the weeks since their marriage, [MASK] had come to look forward to his quiet evenings with his wife.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Cleo	At least he thought he did. Or did he? A wild hope began to pound in his heart. It was foolish, of course. He could count on one hand, and have fingers to spare, the number of times that [MASK] had let him approach her.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Cleo	And [MASK] was his eldest. A man who loved his wife couldn’t help loving his first-born best, the child of his fiercest passion. When that first-born was a girl, she could trample on his heart, and he would swear on a stack of Bibles that it didn’t hurt.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Cleo	She would put her mind on a way to get it. These were the tears she shed for her dead who were beyond her remorse. He rose and seized her roughly by the shoulders, swinging her around to face him. “[MASK], was there a telegram?
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Simeon	“Of course, you’re not,” said his father soothingly. “Those young men were the first to say so when they sobered.” He patted [MASK]’s shoulder. “Let’s go home now. Your face needs attention. You need rest.
<name>the Duchess</name>	the Duchess	Cleo	It would be a happy day for women if both could be cut out. “Tell me about yourself,” said [MASK] richly. The imperial eyes widened and darkened. The Spode cups cooled. The Duchess gave a little sigh and began her story.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Victor	“Sounds like she’s washing her carcass,” said [MASK] insultingly. “I seen her scoot upstairs through the glass. Is she trying to wash off where she brushed past me? My color don’t come off.”
<name>Ma Joad</name>	Ma Joad	Lord	“[MASK],” she said, bending forward in her chair to button her shoes and struggling upright again with a grunt and a groan and the hard rush of breath, “I could eat a horse. Up till near morning like we was.
<name>you</name>	you	Lily	“Never mind about what I’m doing for [MASK]. You know I don’t want you or the child to go without as long as I’m able to see that you don’t. You know it’s my pride to be a good provider.”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Cleo	“Hold on to your hat,” [MASK] said coolly. “I never knew a man who got so hurt in his pocketbook. Don’t think I want the care of a three-story house. I wasn’t bom to work myself to the bone.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Lily	For what had changed her, who was still untouched by time or tribulations? — [MASK] started running, her hairpins slipping out of place, her hat dipping crazily, and a garter going pop as it left its moorings.
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Cleo	You see, I’m a tired old man, quite unused to being a landlord. I’d hate to be called out of bed in the middle of the night to see about a frozen water pipe.” The matter was settled at once and [MASK] handed over the money.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Bart	“They’re borrowing trouble,” [MASK] said promptly. “Those chains will stick to tea and canned goods. Some of them tried to sell people potatoes, and people complained about the quality. Quality counts. Those chains can’t compete with the independents.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Cleo	If young folks lived in that big house, I wouldn’t half sleep for worrying whether they’d keep us awake with loud parties.” She paled. She had talked too much. She turned away from the window. Her doe eyes searched [MASK]’s face with the pleading expression of a child.
<name>Lily</name>	Lily	Cleo	The last years in the West End house and the end toward which she had lived them seemed a nightmare and herself a dreamer slowly struggling awake. As she stood in [MASK]’s hall, her smile did not extend beyond her hostess.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Judy	[MASK] was five, and her legs were fat, but she got up steam and propelled her small stout body along like a tired scow straining in the wake of a racing sloop. She peeped at her mother from under the expansive brim of her leghorn straw.
<name>Yank</name>	Yank	Cleo	There was nothing in the big, battered icebox in the back vestibule either. It had not been in use since summer. Even then it was chiefly a depository for chunks of ice until the iceman stoppered his ears to [MASK]’s promissory poor-mouth stories.
<name>She</name>	She	Cleo	His look was owlish. For a moment [MASK] almost believed her own lies. Perhaps he really was fishing for his razor. She sat up straighter, filled her face with a queenly disdain that would cower the heart of the commoner.
<name>Mayella</name>	Mayella	Lenore	[MASK]’s never said more than two words at a time to anybody. Therell be plenty of hindsight witnesses to say she did act doped. And where are the friends who will help you prove that she’s colored?
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Charity	Presently [MASK] entered with her ponderous walk. The weight of her body was vast, and her small feet steadily ached. Her bloated face was beet-red and a little moist from the effort expended on her slightest movement. She had long since given up trying to find a becoming dress.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Cleo	Nobody ever offered me a living like [MASK]’s for me to chose between it and mine. But what I have is part of me, is blood and bone. I couldn’t no more wish I had different than I could wish I’d never been born to love you.”
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Lily	[MASK] had never called him “black nigger” in all their married life. He knew what it was with her now. The sum of it was this sister of hers had taught her to hate her dark husband.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Robert	[MASK] had shut his mind to remembering. He would not look back. Only the now of his nothingness occupied him. He stayed within his wall of silence, forswearing all but the meager speech of assent or denial.
<name>306</name>	306	Penny	“You call yourself so grown-up. And look at you.” Her impulse was to take the child in her arms. But she did not know why [MASK] 306 was crying. If her pain could be endured, she must learn to endure it.
<name>Nora</name>	Nora	Vicky	“The Irish children are going to get everything new,” [MASK] said smartly. “They brag, and we have to brag back. If we don’t get everything we told them we were going to get, they’ll make fun of us.”
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Simeon	She gave a little start. [MASK] had no respect for any woman’s intelligence. He had never wanted anything a woman had to offer. Well, he might as well get ready to climb off his high horse and let the Duchess sit in the saddle.
<name>her</name>	her	Judy	She’d do the work of a dozen to be free of him for good. She’s got a little girl, and I hate to think of that poor child with a father who’ll never be worth any more than he is right now. She’s around [MASK]’s age.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Charity	A colored mother bears a child, she’s got no time for wringing and twisting in bed. She’s got to put her whole mind on raising that child right.” “You can talk,” said [MASK] bitterly.
<name>Johnsy</name>	Johnsy	Charity	I never said it when you were alive. And I’m sorry, sorry, I waited to say it after you were gone. “You hold my copper, [MASK]. And if I die, you can have it.”
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Cleo	The maid’s broad back seemed to swell the seams of her uniform. “That’s what I’m paying good money to your governess for,” [MASK] added impressively. “So you won’t have to wear an apron.”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Simeon	When they arrived at her tea-table to still the suspicions of their friends, she sat superbly composed. At the frequent parties [MASK] requested for the purpose of making her betray her recognition of his immorality on a wanton face, she gave him no sign of knowing.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Victor	She sat up straighter, filled her face with a queenly disdain that would cower the heart of the commoner. A banded roll of bills appeared in [MASK]’s hand. “Money talks,” he said elaborately, and held it out to her.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Cleo	“Would he accept my money?” asked the Duchess earnestly. “It’s the money of white men, and he despises them.” “Why, that’s all the better,” said [MASK] quickly. “It’s using their money against them.
<name>Mammy</name>	Mammy	Cleo	“[MASK],” he said, “you got more to do besides talk. You got a raft of people coming tonight, and a mess of cooking ahead of you. Why don’t you let us eat and get it over, so you and the girls can start?”
