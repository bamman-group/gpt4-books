<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Bond	If only ...’ She buried her face in her hands. ‘That’s all right,’ said [MASK] comfortingly. ‘It’s no good crying over spilt milk. It’s all over now and thank heavens they let you alone.’ He patted her knee.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Bond	And the other spectators. This crowd of jabbering idiots. Couldn’t someone see what was happening? The chef de partie, the croupier, the huissier? ‘Cinq.’ The croupier was tidying up the pile of notes. The chefde partie bowed smilingly towards [MASK].
<name>Capstan</name>	Capstan	Caporal	He smiled with the satisfaction of a friendly rival. ‘And now to business, before our good “Compagnons” run out of breath. ‘First of all,’ and he inhaled a thick lungful of [MASK], ‘you will be pleased with your Number Two.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Bond	‘Silence.’ [MASK] doubled over with the pain and to shield himself from another blow, only to get a rabbit punch on the back of the neck which made him arch back again, the breath whistling through his teeth.
<name>Tatiana</name>	Tatiana	Vesper	At the other end was [MASK]’s toothbrush and one or two small bottles and a jar of face-cream. He glanced at the bottles and was surprised to see that one contained nembutal sleeping-pills. Perhaps her nerves had been more shaken by the events at the villa than he had imagined.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Bond	The banker slowly turned his own two cards face up. He had a count of three - a king and a black three. [MASK] softly exhaled a cloud of tobacco smoke. He still had a chance. Now he was really faced with the moment of truth.
<name>He</name>	He	Bond	‘Don’t look so worried.’ She leaned forward and put her hand over his. ‘I was only being sentimental. Anyway, my island feels very close to your island tonight.’ She took a sip of champagne. [MASK] laughed, relieved.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Bond	He passed a double strand across his chest, under the arm-pits and through the chair-back. He made no mistakes with the knots and left no play in any of the bindings. All of them bit sharply into [MASK]’s flesh.
<name>Leamas</name>	Leamas	Bond	There was the man, leaning forward close behind him, smiling broadly under his black moustache as if he was wishing [MASK] luck, completely secure in the noise and the crowd. The discoloured teeth came together. ‘Deux,’ said the grinning mouth.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Vesper	By juggling with the emphasis, he made the kidnapping sound much more Machiavellian than it had been. He praised [MASK]’s coolness and composure throughout the whole episode without saying that he had found some of her actions unaccountable.
<name>Drummond</name>	Drummond	Bond	I shall be gone. Withdraw your bet before I count ten. If you call for help I shall fire.’ The voice was confident. [MASK] believed it. These people had shown they would unhesitatingly go the limit. The thick walking-stick was explained.
<name>Stein</name>	Stein	Bond	He supposed one got used to it. ‘It is indeed very sad,’ said [MASK]. ‘You also have been unlucky,’ he gestured to the proprietor’s empty sleeve. ‘I myself was very fortunate.’ For a time they talked about the war.
<name>Ratchett</name>	Ratchett	Bond	‘There has been a terrible accident. Madame . ..’ [MASK] hurled himself out of bed and through the bathroom, but the communicating door was locked. He dashed back and through his room and down the corridor past a shrinking, terrified maid.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Bond	The croupier slipped some counters through the slot in the table which receives the cagnotte and announced quietly: ‘ Un banco d’un million.’ ‘Suivi,’ murmured the Greek, meaning that he exercised his right to follow up his lost bet. [MASK] lit a cigarette and settled himself in his chair.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Bond	[MASK] drove it hard and well and with an almost sensual pleasure. It was a battleship-grey convertible coupe, which really did convert, and it was capable of touring at ninety with thirty miles an hour in reserve.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Bond	He turned to examine the crowd behind him. There was no trace of the gunman, but the huissier was looking for someone to claim the malacca stick. It seemed undamaged. But it no longer carried a rubber tip. [MASK] beckoned to him.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Bond	Or something like that, thought [MASK] as he pushed his way through the swing doors of the salle privee and nodded to the bored man in evening clothes whose job it is to bar your entry and your exit with the electric foot-switch which can lock the doors at any hint of trouble.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Bond	8 / PINK LIGHTS AND CHAMPAGNE [MASK] walked up to his room, which again showed no sign of trespass, threw off his clothes, took a long hot bath followed by an ice-cold shower and lay down on his bed.
<name>She</name>	She	Bond	Can’t we go back to the beginning again? What is this dreadful nightmare that is killing us?’ At first she said nothing, then a tear rolled slowly down her cheek. ‘You mean you would have married me?’ [MASK] nodded.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Bond	‘It sounds a childish trick,’ she looked penitently at [MASK], ‘but it’s really frightfully effective. One’s a complete prisoner and although I screamed I don’t expect any sound came out from under my skirt.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Vesper	You get to it through the public rooms. It looks quite cheerful.’ ‘I think I’d love to,’ said [MASK]. ‘I’ll tidy up while you put your winnings away. I’ll meet you in the entrance hall.’
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Bond	[MASK] made up his mind. When he had finished, he followed her. Both her doors were locked and when he made her let him in, he saw that she had been sitting in the shadows by the window, watching, he presumed.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Bond	Against the background of this luminous and sparkling stage [MASK] stood in the sunshine and felt his mission to be incongruous and remote and his dark profession an affront to his fellow actors. He shrugged away the momentary feeling of unease and walked round the back of his hotel and down the ramp to the garage.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bond	There’s a bus that takes me there and back with only a short walk over the dunes, and I’ve managed to get over the fact that it’s on the way down that road to the villa.’ Her voice faltered. The mention of the villa had made [MASK]’s eyes flicker.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Bond	You see, my dear [MASK], with a man it is quite unnecessary to indulge in refinements. With this simple instrument, or with almost any other object, one can cause a man as much pain as is possible or necessary.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Vesper	‘[MASK],’ he called, thinking she must have had some urgent message which might concern them both. She turned quickly, a hand up to her mouth. For a moment longer than necessary she stared at him, her eyes wide.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Bond	She seemed to be listening carefully to the music. One elbow rested on the table and her hand supported her chin, but on the back of her hand and not on the palm, and [MASK] noticed that her knuckles showed white as if her fist was tightly clenched.
<name>James</name>	James	Bond	[MASK] liked to make a good breakfast. After a cold shower, he sat at the writing-table in front of the window. He looked out at the beautiful day and consumed half a pint of iced orange juice, three scrambled eggs and bacon and a double portion of coffee without sugar.
<name>He</name>	He	Bond	He took a step towards her and then realized that there was nothing to say between them then. ‘My love,’ he said. Then he went out and shut the door. [MASK] walked along to his room and sat down on the bed.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Bond	There was a ring of sweat drops on the floor round [MASK]’s chair. ‘We must certainly keep your tongue lubricated.’ He laid the handle of the carpet-beater down on the floor between his thick legs and rose from his chair.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Bond	The odds are so nearly divided between to draw or not to draw. [MASK] let the banker sweat it out. Since his nine could only be equalled by the banker drawing a six, he would normally have shown his count if it had been a friendly game.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Mathis	Felt pretty clever and got a reputation for being good and tough. A Double O number in our Service means you’ve had to kill a chap in cold blood in the course of some job. ‘Now,’ he looked up again at [MASK], ‘that’s all very fine.
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Mathis	There’s still plenty for you to do. And you’ll do it. And when you fall in love and have a mistress or a wife and children to look after, it will seem all the easier.’ [MASK] opened the door and stopped on the threshold.
<name>Leiter</name>	Leiter	Leiter	Shake it very well until it’s ice-cold, then add a large thin slice of lemon-peel. Got it?’ ‘Certainly, monsieur.’ The barman seemed pleased with the idea. ‘Gosh, that’s certainly a drink,’ said [MASK].
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Bond	[MASK]’s heart thumped. He took the heavy anonymous envelope below the level of the table and slit it open with his thumbnail, noticing that the gum was still wet on the flap. Unbelieving and yet knowing it was true, he felt the broad wads of notes.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Bond	Only her black hair showed above the sheet and her body under the bedclothes was straight and moulded like a stone effigy on a tomb. [MASK] fell on his knees beside her and drew back the sheet. She was asleep. She must be. Her eyes were closed.
<name>Stalin</name>	Stalin	Bond	I can already feel the ice-floes on the two rivers breaking up.’ He smiled, ‘I don’t think [MASK] has ever been melted. It will be a new experience for him. And for you.’ She did not answer him directly.
<name>Wilmot</name>	Wilmot	Mathis	‘I’d certainly like to have [MASK], sir.’ ‘Well, we’ll see. Try and bring it off. We’re going to look pretty foolish if you don’t. And watch out. This sounds an amusing job, but I don’t think it’s going to be.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Bond	The caviar was heaped on to their plates and they ate for a time in silence. After a while [MASK] said: ‘It’s very satisfactory to be a corpse who changes places with his murderers. For them it certainly was a case of being hoist with their own petard.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bond	The fashionable part of the restaurant was beside the wide crescent of window built out like the broad stern of a ship over the hotel gardens, but [MASK] had chosen a table in one of the mirrored alcoves at the back of the great room.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Bond	The bomb-crater had disappeared and only a few passers-by had paused to gape. [MASK] assumed that similar face-lifting had already been carried out at the Hermitage and to the shops and frontages which had lost their windows.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Bond	‘Here’s your cheque,’ he said to [MASK]. ‘I’ve rather enjoyed walking around with forty million francs in my pocket, but I suppose you’d better sign it and I’ll put it to your account with the Credit Lyonnais.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Bond	The idea was to destroy you and the bomb-throwers without trace. Presumably there were other plans for dealing with the third man.’ ‘Go on,’ said [MASK], full of admiration for the ingenuity of the double-cross.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Bond	Un banco de huit millions.’ ‘Suivi,’ said [MASK]. And lost again, to a natural nine. In two coups he had lost twelve million francs. By scraping the barrel, he had just sixteen million francs left, exactly the amount of the next banco.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Bond	He unhooked the velvet-covered chain and let it fall. The spectators opened a way for him. They looked at him curiously and rather fearfully as if he carried the smell of death on him. Then he vanished from [MASK]’s sight.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Vesper	Finally he took her hand. ‘Something’s on your mind, [MASK],’ he said. She gave him a taut, bright smile. ‘It’s nothing. Absolutely nothing. I had a silly idea we were being followed. It’s just nerves, I suppose.
<name>Leopold</name>	Leopold	Bond	[MASK] reached out a steady right hand and drew the cards towards him. Would it be the lift of the heart which a nine brings, or an eight brings? He fanned the two cards under the curtain of his hand. The muscles of his jaw rippled as he clenched his teeth.
<name>him</name>	him	Bond	‘A promise is a promise,’ she said. This time they both knew what the promise was. She picked up her bag from the bed and walked to the door. ‘ Shall I come tomorrow? ’ She looked at [MASK] gravely.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Bond	It was a nine, a wonderful nine of hearts, the card known in gipsy magic as ‘a whisper of love, a whisper of hate’, the card that meant almost certain victory for [MASK]. The croupier slipped it delicately across.
<name>Estella</name>	Estella	Vesper	He slipped his feet into a pair of dark-blue leather sandals and went downstairs and out of the house and across the terrace to the beach. As he passed across the front of the house he thought of [MASK], but he refrained from looking up to see if she was still standing at the window.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Bond	Before leaving the Casino, [MASK] deposited his total capital of twenty-four million at the caisse, keeping only a few notes of ten mille as pocket money. As they walked across to the Splendide, they saw that a team of workmen was already busy at the scene of the explosion.
<name>Lara</name>	Lara	Bond	‘I like doing everything fully, getting the most out of everything one does. I think that’s the way to live. But it sounds rather schoolgirlish when one says it,’ she added apologetically. The little carafe of vodka had arrived in its bowl of crushed ice and [MASK] filled their glasses.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Animation	‘I’m mad. Now we’ll be there in a second. I do hope you’re going to like it.’ They both leant forward. [MASK] was back in her face and the incident left only the smallest question-mark hanging in the air.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Bond	[MASK] replied politely. He turned to examine the crowd behind him. There was no trace of the gunman, but the huissier was looking for someone to claim the malacca stick. It seemed undamaged. But it no longer carried a rubber tip.
<name>Trente</name>	Trente	Zero	He kept off the table for the eighth throw. [MASK] turned up. This piece of luck cheered him further and, accepting the thirty as a fingerpost to the last dozen, he decided to back the first and last dozens until he had lost twice.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Bond	He dipped the knife into the glass of very hot water which stood beside the pot of Strasbourg porcelain and reminded himself to tip the waiter doubly for this particular meal. 7 / ROUGE ET NOIR [MASK] was determined to be completely fit and relaxed for a gambling session which might last most of the night.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Bond	[MASK] shook himself. He hastily paid the bill, not waiting for the change. He pushed back his table and walked quickly through the entrance without acknowledging the good-nights of the maitre d’hotel and the doorman. He hurried through the gaming-room and looked carefully up and down the long entrance hall.
<name>Leamas</name>	Leamas	M	She had had to speak guardedly and the agent had rung off without comment. She had been told to do this whatever the result. [MASK] had asked for the information to be passed on to him personally at any time of the day or night.
<name>Shaddam</name>	Shaddam	SMERSH	The sleeves were wide and short, ending just above the elbow. The result was cool and comfortable and now when he slipped the coat on over his hunks, all his bruises and scars were hidden except the thin white bracelets on wrists and ankles and the mark of [MASK] on his right hand.
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Bond	There was something rather disquieting about their appearance. They were both small and they were dressed alike in dark and, [MASK] reflected, rather hot-looking suits. They had the appearance of a variety turn waiting for a bus on the way to the theatre.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Vesper	[MASK] put out a hand and touched one of his. Her eyes filled with tears. ‘It’s horrible,’ she said. ‘The things they did to you. And it was all my fault. If only ...’ She buried her face in her hands.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Bond	[MASK] borrowed the chefs card and studied the run of the ball since the session had started at three o’clock that afternoon. He always did this although he knew that each turn of the wheel, each fall of the ball into a numbered slot, has absolutely no connexion with its predecessor.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Bond	16 / THE CRAWLING OF THE SKIN As [MASK] hurtled round the bend, caressing the great car against the camber with an easy sway of body and hands, he was working out his plan of action when the distance between the two cars had narrowed still further.
<name>James</name>	James	Bond	I’m just used to it.’ ‘I think it’s a fine name,’ said [MASK]. An idea struck him. ‘Can I borrow it?’ He explained about the special martini he had invented and his search for a name for it.
<name>He</name>	He	Bond	‘You really don’t know much about me,’ she said suddenly. [MASK] was surprised by the undertone of seriousness in her voice. ‘Quite enough,’ he said laughing. ‘All I need until tomorrow and the next day and the next.
<name>Chet</name>	Chet	Bond	Sure enough, a quarter of a mile away, a black saloon was coming after them at a good pace. [MASK] laughed. ‘ We can’t be the only people using this road,’ he said. ‘Anyway, who wants to follow us?
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Vesper	He led her to the bed and drew her down beside him. They sat stiffly, like people in a railway carriage. ‘[MASK],’ he said, holding her cold hands in his, ‘we can’t go on like this. We must finish with it.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Bond	With the thin vertical scar down his right cheek the general effect was faintly piratical. Not much of Hoagy Carmichael there, thought [MASK], as he filled a flat, light gunmetal box with fifty of the Morland cigarettes with the triple gold band.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Bond	Can I have it?’ ‘So long as I can try one first,’ she promised. ‘It sounds a drink to be proud of.’ ‘We’ll have one together when all this is finished,’ said [MASK]. ‘Win or lose.
<name>Flambeau</name>	Flambeau	Bond	It was not tied with a tape across the eye, but screwed in like a monocle. Otherwise he seemed a friendly middle-aged man, with dark brown hair brushed straight back, and, as [MASK] had seen while he was talking to the patron, particularly large, white teeth.
<name>Aliens</name>	Aliens	Czechs	They may be part of the team. Their papers are in order — stateless [MASK] apparently — but one of our men says the language they talk in their room is Bulgarian. We don’t see many of those around.
<name>James</name>	James	Bond	‘Are you all right?’ ‘Yes, quite.’ ‘I’m glad. Please take care of yourself.’ She rang off. [MASK] shook himself, then he picked up his knife and selected the thickest of the pieces of hot toast.
<name>She</name>	She	Vesper	Inquiries could be pursued if there was a charge against him. [MASK] had shrugged her shoulders at the information. This time when the man appeared she left her lunch in the middle and went straight up to her room.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Bond	I hope it was some use.’ [MASK] nodded. ‘It was rather instinctive. I just thought you’d have no idea what had happened to me and I was terrified. I did the first thing I could think of.’
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Bond	She was excited and some of her laughter sounded brittle, but [MASK] was determined to fall in with her new mood and it was only at the end of dinner that he made a passing remark which made her pause. She put her hand over his.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Bond	But above all, he admitted to himself, he shirked the answer to a more painful question. The doctor had talked often to [MASK] about his injuries. He had always told him that there would be no evil effects from the terrible battering his body had received.
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Vesper	But with [MASK] there could be none of this. In the dull room and the boredom of his treatment her presence was each day an oasis of pleasure, something to look forward to. In their talk there was nothing but companionship with a distant undertone of passion.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Vesper	Then he got quietly out of bed and in his pyjama-coat he crept past [MASK]’s door and out of the house to the beach. The sea was smooth and quiet in the sunrise. The small pink waves idly licked the sand.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Bond	They were a four and a five - an unbeatable nine. There was a little gasp of envy from the table and the players to the left of [MASK] exchanged rueful glances at their failure to accept the two million franc bet.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Quatre	‘[MASK].’ And the other spectators. This crowd of jabbering idiots. Couldn’t someone see what was happening? The chef de partie, the croupier, the huissier? ‘Cinq.’ The croupier was tidying up the pile of notes.
<name>Annabel</name>	Annabel	Vesper	Under the water he imagined the tranquil scene and wished that [MASK] could just then come through the pines and be astonished to see him suddenly erupt from the empty seascape. When after a full minute he came to the surface in a froth of spray, he was disappointed.
<name>He</name>	He	Bond	They were sweating and filthy with dust and oil by the time they had him lying in the road. The thin man felt his heart and then slapped his face hard on either side. [MASK] grunted and moved a hand. The thin man slapped him again.
<name>Mathis</name>	Mathis	Bond	‘Mais n ’enculons pas des mouches,’ he added in an aside to the barman. The barman grinned. ‘ That’s a vulgar way of saying “ we won’t split hairs ”, ’ explained [MASK].
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Bond	‘I shouldn’t have let it come to you,’ she said. ‘Directly the cards were dealt I kicked myself.’ ‘It’s only the beginning of the game,’ said [MASK]. ‘ You may be right the next time you pass it.’
<name>Max</name>	Max	Bond	'Attention,' he said sharply to the man beside him. The man’s hand tightened on the lever. A hundred yards from the cross-roads he slowed to thirty. In the mirror [MASK]’s great headlights were lighting up the bend.
<name>Solitaire</name>	Solitaire	Vesper	In the back seat was the tall thin gunman. He lay back relaxed, gazing at the ceiling, apparently uninterested in the wild speed of the car. His right hand lay caressingly on [MASK]’s left thigh which stretched out naked beside him.
<name>Flashman</name>	Flashman	Bond	Will you marry me?’ She snorted. ‘You need a slave, not a wife.’ ‘I want you.’ ‘Well, I want my lobster and champagne, so hurry up.’ ‘All right, all right,’ said [MASK].
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Bond	[MASK] turned back to the friendliness of his room. After the crowded arena of the big table and the nervous strain of the three horns’ play, he was glad to be alone for a moment and be welcomed by his pyjamas on the bed and his hairbrushes on the dressing-table.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Bond	For a while they ate in silence, then they talked of other things while the coffee was served. They smoked. Neither of them drank brandy or a liqueur. Finally, [MASK] felt it was time to explain the actual mechanics of the game.
<name>Christine</name>	Christine	Mathis	He smiled. ‘I’m glad there’s something the stupid English can teach the clever French.’ [MASK] laughed delightedly. ‘I suppose you think that’s paid me back for knowing what the Muntzes were up to. Well, I’ll call it quits.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Bond	He got up and stood behind the inert, dripping body. There was no colour in [MASK]’s face or anywhere on his body above the waist. There was a faint flutter of his skin above the heart. Otherwise he might have been dead.
<name>Leamas</name>	Leamas	Bond	[MASK]’s flesh cringed as the cane surface just touched him. ‘But you, my dear fellow, can only hope that I shall spare you further pain and spare your life. There is no other hope for you but that. Absolutely none. ‘Well?’
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Bond	‘ Un banco de dix millions,’ he announced. He slapped down their equivalent in ten plaques of a million each. This is the kill, thought [MASK]. This man has reached the point of no return. This is the last of his capital.
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Vesper	When the lobster had come and gone and the second bottle of champagne was half-empty and they had just ladled thick cream over their fraises des bois, [MASK] gave a deep sigh of contentment. ‘I’m behaving like a pig,’ she said happily.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Bond	A chunky malacca cane with a rubber tip hung on the rail beside him. He must have had permission to bring the cane into the Casino with him, reflected [MASK], who knew that neither sticks nor any other objects were allowed in the rooms as a precaution against acts of violence.
<name>him</name>	him	Bond	For a moment he lay there, all the breath knocked out of him. Then the thin man came and hauled him up against the wall by his collar. He had a gun in his hand. He looked [MASK] inquisitively in the eyes.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Bond	‘It’s the man in the car,’ she said in a stifled voice. ‘The man who was following us. I know it is.’ [MASK] looked again over his shoulder. The patron was discussing the menu with the new customer.
<name>Gordon</name>	Gordon	Gordon	‘Oui, monsieur.’ ‘Just a moment. Three measures of [MASK]’s, one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it very well until it’s ice-cold, then add a large thin slice of lemon-peel.
<name>Le Chiffre</name>	Le Chiffre	Vesper	He sat up in bed and wrote his report to M. He made light of what he still considered amateurish behaviour on the part of [MASK]. By juggling with the emphasis, he made the kidnapping sound much more Machiavellian than it had been.
<name>Soames</name>	Soames	Bond	But for the high-lights on the satin of the shawl-cut lapels, he might have been faced by the thick bust of a black-fleeced Minotaur rising out of a green grass field. [MASK] slipped a packet of notes on to the table without counting them.
