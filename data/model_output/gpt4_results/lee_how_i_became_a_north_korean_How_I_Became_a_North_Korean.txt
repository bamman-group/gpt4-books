<name>Jun</name>	Jun	Yongju	“Entire villages of women are bought and sold. There’s even a house church pastor who turned in the North Korean refugees in his congregation and collected the Chinese government’s cash reward.” The cake was the other boys’ universe; only [MASK] and I were really listening.
<name>broth</name>	broth	dwenjang	She marched up and down past the dozen of us. Utensils disappeared, so we began eating rice and kimchi with our hands and drank our soup straight from plastic bowls. Sometimes a piece of kimchi or a spoonful of savory [MASK] helped me escape.
<name>Amos</name>	Amos	Cheolmin	[MASK]’s eyes were hard and cold. The missionary set him back down. “No dinner today for you. No verse, no food. We’ll stick to this every day until you conform fully to my rules.
<name>Yara</name>	Yara	Cheolmin	“Pretty nuna.” [MASK]’s voice was so sharp it could have honed knives. “When was the last time we saw you? Oh, I remember! When you betrayed us!” “What’s she doing here?”
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Yongju	Then [MASK] smiled and roughed up my hair, and everything else fell away, and I only felt shame and longing. A few days later we had our first visitors, a couple wearing the brightest shades of spring between them. Their church meant something to me.
<name>Enrique</name>	Enrique	Cheolmin	I wasn’t surprised when the missionary said gently, “Let him sleep.” He patted [MASK]’s buzzed hair, recently doused with lice-killing chemicals like all of ours. “He probably didn’t get any rest last night.” “I don’t understand.”
<name>Yunior</name>	Yunior	Eomeoni	Salt filled my mouth. The baby’s cries became two slender arms that curled around my lungs, and my breathing slowed and thinned. Only then did I ask [MASK] what I couldn’t forget, the only question that mattered to me. “I’m his son.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Cheolmin	[MASK] spat into the air and caught the descending blob in his fist. “Those Bible stories are a load of shit. Everyone knows that.” “Everyone?” I said. “Have you talked to the entire world’s population and checked?
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Jangmi	Now more questions. What had happened to her? Did I really care about her, about anyone, or were my expressions of interest merely a way of escaping myself? One thing was certain: No doctor could repair what was broken inside [MASK].
<name>Smoke</name>	Smoke	Arirang	“[MASK]” continued to undulate through the room. The image enchanted me and from the door I watched the material curl in the wastebasket, until my father’s and mother’s glossy faces turned to ash and I began to understand. My stomach seized up.
<name>Jackson</name>	Jackson	Seongsik	I’m such a babo\ I never listen.” His words churned deep in my lower stomach and sickness overwhelmed me. The world tipped from one side to another, then righted itself again. I needed [MASK]. But how to convince him that he needed me?
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Dongmu	Without warning, she added, “[MASK], don’t do anything you can’t reverse. It’s best you not say anything more.” I weighed whether to return home or run away, though how and to where was beyond my ken.
<name>Yun</name>	Yun	Jangmi	[MASK] A week after I left the mountains I was betrayed by a Joseon-jo\ woman who promised to help me, then sold me to a local gang. In the crowded city that seemed large enough to hide in, the woman had given me a job with actual pay at her eatery.
<name>Asa</name>	Asa	Yongju	I crawled out from under the blanket, trying to believe that yesterday was merely the past and everything before that even more distant from me. When [MASK] leaned toward me, his face as slender as candlelight, I drew back onto the yo.
<name>Adoma</name>	Adoma	Yongju	[MASK]’s eyes lingered on hers for a little too long. “I’ve considered it myself. But we don’t have national identity cards if the police catch us on the way, and then there’s the terrain we’ve never seen and the language, and so much more.
<name>Waldo</name>	Waldo	Namil	“[MASK], I’ve been meaning to tell you,” I said. “I thought you might like to know, in all probability, you’re wearing a woman’s sweater.” He was also wearing bobby socks, but I let that one go.
<name>Yan</name>	Yan	Adam	That was probably mainly behind my move to the streets a few nights later, though I told myself it was to save my yuan for emergencies. It was as if I was onstage and [MASK] and his friends, the kids at Bible camp, were my audience.
<name>God</name>	God	Yongju	Everything is an exchange. I asked myself: What does [MASK] want from me? The missionaries continued to talk. I tried and failed to sleep. Their sounds continued from down the hall as I felt my limbs, my hair against my shoulders. I was all there.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Jangmi	Let me help you.” Though he was my senior in all ways, I set my hand down on the journalist’s shoulder so that he couldn’t lean in any closer to [MASK]. “Can’t you see she doesn’t want to talk to you?”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Jangmi	I chopped fresh ginger the way my eomeoni had once done for me and made her tea. As I walked to [MASK]’s room, a mighty hand seemed to seize a gun’s barrel and aim it at my chest. I saw the red leather jacket.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Byeol	I considered beating her head in with a heavy pan. [MASK] was at her piano lesson. If she had been at home, maybe she would have pleaded for me, maybe the possibility of yet another new woman in her life would have finally driven her to me.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Seongsik	He would have a baby soon enough. I waited for a safe number of days to pass until I could make my announcement. Meanwhile, [MASK] followed me to the common room, which was always a remarkable late-spring temperature due to the heated floors, then to the bathroom.
<name>Eomeoneem</name>	Eomeoneem	Seongsik	“And what exactly is wrong with someone like me?” I smiled sweetly. The old rag of a woman wouldn’t have survived five minutes of my former life. “Eomeoneem, you promised,” [MASK] whined to his eomma, suddenly sounding like a ten-year-old.
<name>He</name>	He	Seongsik	The smell was too strong for me. [MASK] retrieved a large black book and placed it in my hands as if offering me a letter signed by the Great Leader himself. “It’s the Bible,” he said. “It’s the only book we need.”
<name>They</name>	They	Sponsors	“[MASK] want evidence. There’s not a thing we can do about it.” He took several photographs and encouraged us to look solemn through the camera’s clicking. Late that night after we had our first baths, he took another set of photos of us cleaned up and told us to smile.
<name>Amira</name>	Amira	Jangmi	“Thanks to [MASK], I was able to help a number of other girls to my shelters, but she needed special attention—medical attention.” He meant the Christian doctor he trusted who lived in the area.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Daehan	Her right leg was swollen above the plaster; mottled yellowed bruises banded around her forearm and disappeared up the sleeve of her baggy dress. [MASK] dropped the Bible flash cards he was trimming into perfect rectangles, scattering them like paper rain.
<name>Blue</name>	Blue	Daehan	“You’re all grown up, [MASK].” He seems determined not to acknowledge our most recent encounter, when I found him six years ago curled up boomerang-style in my mom’s wardrobe. “We’re so glad you finally came.”
<name>Beatrice</name>	Beatrice	Daehan	I wanted to . . . apologize.” I clap for him. “And now you’ve apologized.” “I’m a hypocrite, [MASK]. I’m a sinner. We all are.” “I’ve figured out that much myself by now.”
<name>James</name>	James	Yongju	His cap was pulled down low over his face, and his voice crackled with the same awkward change I had suffered a few years ago. The young man I’d call [MASK] considered me, then told me to lift up my foot. I did as he said.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Cheolmin	The smaller one I’d learn was [MASK] lifted up his cap to have a closer look at me. I saw that part of his forehead and cheeks had been burned, giving his skin an uneven, blistered texture. His inflamed gums showed when he smiled.
<name>Minho</name>	Minho	Daehan	As we passed in the distance a farmer working in a cornfield, [MASK] said, “You have a hyeong, too?” “No.” I swallowed. “Only the dongsaeng you already know about.” I was grateful when he pressed no further.
<name>Despair</name>	Despair	Daehan	The smoky octopus came up and invaded my lungs, and [MASK] followed me as I fled the city, my hand tight around the plastic case in my pocket that held a razor blade, the one I had crossed the river with to use in case we were caught.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Jangmi	Water surrounded us. We were drowning together. Then I was dragged back from drowning. I gagged. The kitchen scissors were in [MASK]’s hands and my hands were around hers. Our hands were dark and wet and smelled of fresh liver. Voices erupted.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Daehan	His breath was shallow, his forehead sticky with sweat. [MASK] said, “He needs a doctor!” “I’m perfectly fine, no need for the fuss.” The missionary rubbed at his chest. Within minutes I heard the front door open and the stairs echo with footsteps.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Byeol	He bribed [MASK] with sweets and successfully lured her to a yo spread out on the common-room floor, then he stood by the bed and stripped off his slacks and striped sweater, finally ready to claim his reward. Clothed, he had looked like the shabby men from my hometown.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Dongmu	I asked, “How did it feel on ... on the last day of your life?” “[MASK]! You’re so morbid, thinking about death already.” “I don’t mean dying—not exactly. But when your family ... left.
<name>Yona</name>	Yona	Cheolmin	“Look, I’m a good guy, really.” She sought my other hand, laying hers lightly across mine. “Do people like me get to go to your country?” Her question made even [MASK] freeze. “My country?”
<name>Glenn Gould</name>	Glenn Gould	Abeoji	When [MASK] plays the piano, each time he plays, the phrasing is more or less the same. Recognizable, is what I mean. You can listen to one recording and compare it to another, but it’s the same composition.
<name>David</name>	David	Yongju	I was exposed again in a circle of boys and there was nowhere to hide. I prepared myself, curled up roly-poly on the floor to protect myself from his fists, but they never came. Instead, [MASK] asked, “Who’s your real enemy?
<name>Deacon</name>	Deacon	Daehan	He said, “[MASK].” “I can explain,” my mom said, as if there were any possible legitimate explanations for our church deacon hiding in her closet. I ran out of the bedroom. The hypocrisy, it was too much for me.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Christian	I’d practically grown up in the church and I was determined to stay inside the maps I understood, reliable black-and-white ones of [MASK] and heathen, the right route and the wrong. My maps didn’t include school or family anymore.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Daehan	“Do something!” [MASK] screamed at me, assuming it was the work of the others. He hurled himself at my back; I shook him off. He said, “You’re sabotaging yourself! I’m getting you help, I promise!”
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Eomeoni	[MASK] screamed as they pinned my arms behind me. The red leather sleeve arced slowly, then it was over. The black butt crunched down on my nose and the burning spread across my face. Coppery blood perfumed the air; I tasted it on my tongue.
<name>Lin</name>	Lin	Seongsik	She reminded me of my mother. I entered into the amber light. “Please.” I gestured at the bowl of half-eaten noodles on one of the creaky plastic tables. I wanted to save [MASK]’s mother’s money, the little I had.
<name>Stevo</name>	Stevo	Namil	You’ll get older, and if the police catch you, as they inevitably will, you won’t get a kid’s treatment when you get sent back.” [MASK] pulled up his canvas pants and scratched at his legs, the skin cracked into dry cobweb patterns.
<name>She</name>	She	Myeonghui	Were traitors actually traitors, or were they wronged, betrayed, or just unlucky? My laugh grew into painful, unstrung sounds. [MASK] pulled away. “Someone might hear,” she said with the same pleasant, even tone.
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Daehan	[MASK] was standing just outside the lantern’s ring of light, and though his dislike of me was clear, I was grateful not to be alone. He hunched down to my level and cupped his hand to my ear. “They’re talking about you.”
<name>Yong</name>	Yong	Namil	You heard what [MASK] said last night, it would help to have a Joseon-yo^ with us.” He turned to me. “You’d be a good scout?” “How can we trust him?”
<name>They</name>	They	Fish	It became silent. Only then I blinked, astonished to find myself conscious again. [MASK] were investigating my dream legs, my dream body that had landed in their watery garden. I bounced in slow motion across a bedrock littered with broken glass and cigarette butts.
<name>Oppression</name>	Oppression	China	The blank face of [MASK] that made us the hunted. I gazed at the men who were destroying our lives; they looked the same. A swift blur of red leather passed me. The man opened the back door to the van and invited the women to step up.
<name>Meiling</name>	Meiling	Yongju	It was such a terrible night in the rain—I didn’t know where to go.” [MASK] flushed again. “You must be hungry, dongmu.” She looked swiftly from the trees as gnarled as gnomes to our ragtag assembly emerging from the dugout.
<name>Enrique</name>	Enrique	Kwon	[MASK] was the actual God that filled our days. He had our rotten teeth pulled and ragged fingernails cleaned up, the loamy smell thick on our skin scrubbed away, until he disappeared to manage another dozen shelters. I knew power, had grown up around its black suits and unhurried air and tinted car windows.
<name>Yul</name>	Yul	Cheolmin	our numb thighs—“and your hands flat on the saang as we start our lesson.” He was full of empty threats. We weren’t twenty minutes into the lesson when [MASK] slumped onto the table and erupted into snores. I wasn’t surprised when the missionary said gently, “Let him sleep.”
<name>Yuki</name>	Yuki	Byeol	I decided to worry about that later. The days went by slowly, and as he was often not there, I was left with [MASK] and her relentless questions. “Why can’t you eat fish?” or “Why can’t you eat bean sprouts?”
<name>Methuselah</name>	Methuselah	Abraham	Why didn’t any of you tell me he was here? There are important things we have to discuss.” His multiple chins tucked into his chest. The shaggy-haired sheepdog of a man who looked as old as [MASK] was appallingly bad at hiding his hurt feelings.
<name>James</name>	James	Myeonghui	I waited for [MASK]. The wind chilled my sweaty skin as I watched the few out by the riverbank striding back and forth for exercise. This daily life was something that might no longer be mine. My hands knotted tightly together.
<name>Yossi</name>	Yossi	Daehan	The rain stopped, but the moon and the stars were hooded by clouds and were useless guides. I scrambled in the dark behind [MASK], who took to the mountain slope the way I imagined a goat would. My hand groped around a prickly tree, then around boulders.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Yongju	At lunch the next day, I raced between the kitchen and the common room and, being twice as fast as the others, ended up doing over a quarter of the prep duties. “You’re a rocket!” [MASK] said, which made me sprint even faster.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Jangmi	Rain stippled my perspective, but I thought I saw a human smudge and pressed my face against the plastic. It was [MASK], kicking up puddles of water with her feet, holding her nightdress up high from the sludge. I was alarmed and amazed that she had somehow freed herself.
<name>Yeonmi</name>	Yeonmi	Yongju	she said, though the sweetness of her voice reminded me of blooming cherry blossoms. She’d learned the night before as we walked back that I was a Joseon-yo^. [MASK]’s eyes followed her hand stirring from her swollen belly to her too-perfect equation of a face.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Yongju	The day I’m to meet [MASK], I wake up early. The missionary’s sightless eye hovers outside the window where the moon should be. My breath draws sharply in. It’s just an image, I tell myself. An image that sometimes compels me to church.
<name>Yuna</name>	Yuna	Jangmi	To be beyond hunger, I thought, must be a place beyond desire. A colony of parasites nested inside [MASK]. She ate bowls of rice, soybean-paste stew, spicy pork when it was available, as if eating would stave off thinking.
<name>Yejide</name>	Yejide	Yongju	I should have returned home, but I didn’t. I couldn’t. I didn’t want to. How could I when [MASK] squatted beside the tub and began wordlessly scrubbing my back with a sandpapery ttaeh sugeon, stripping off layers of dead skin?
<name>Tae</name>	Tae	Seongsik	I thought about my eomma and sank to the couch as far from [MASK] as I could manage. He was as nervous as I was and gripped his teacup as if it were a crowbar. He gulped down the tea. “Everything in here’s quality.
<name>She</name>	She	Abba	I had seasoned and cooked mixed vegetables while she was at school, checking my reaction to the different root vegetables. “I want fish. [MASK] told you my favorite food is fish.” She kicked her tiny schoolbag across the floor and looked prepared to kick me next.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Seongsik	So this was the real American! [MASK] took in all his belongings, including me, and rubbed his stomach as if he were full. “And this is our drinking water,” he said in front of a plastic tank standing on four legs.
<name>Giorgio</name>	Giorgio	Seongsik	This man named [MASK] said, “You really do believe me now, don’t you? I’m a person who can make these kinds of meetings happen. I know everyone, and everyone knows me. Money? Who needs money? You need connections.”
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Seongsik	It was as if she had slapped me. I understood she was threatened by me, but I couldn’t even reprimand her; I had no such power. All I could do was wait and see what my new husband would do. [MASK] looked from me to his daughter.
<name>An-Mei</name>	An-Mei	Seongsik	I knew this much: I would be sent to jail or, worse, the camps in the far north if I was caught. The authorities would assume my baby was of impure Chinese blood and murder her. I moved closer to [MASK].
<name>Mara</name>	Mara	Jangmi	When I closed my eyes that night, I saw the man’s bleeding mouth, the frightened pits of his eyes. In the morning my wish had come true. [MASK] was gone. She had taken every lightweight, useful item in our shelter with her.
<name>Youssef</name>	Youssef	Daehan	I saw walls that I shouldn’t broach: a nuna four years my senior who was once with child, my desire in search of an object. “She’s dangerous,” said [MASK], his words as wild as weeds.
<name>his</name>	his	Yongju	She clearly spelled trouble, and I found myself praying that he was only giving her hair a final cleaning. He murmured something and she looked like a queen speaking to her audience when she responded. That was when I squeezed in between them and slung my arm around [MASK]’s shoulders.
<name>Yuri</name>	Yuri	Cheolmin	[MASK] said, “I know. I killed one when I was a kid just for fun and I pulled it all apart. I tell you, nothing but feathers.” I passed around a plastic bag of sunflower seeds given to me by a market vendor I’d run favors for.
<name>Yossi</name>	Yossi	Yongju	Most important, [MASK]’s back was inches from me. Like every morning during our month in the safe house, his warm, nutty smell enveloped me before I opened my eyes. Sure, you could have built another Mount Sinai with the total sum of our discomforts.
<name>Cherry</name>	Cherry	Miyeon	You’re only servicing them online.” She unlocked one of the cubicle rooms. A baby-faced girl with a turned-up nose, introduced as [MASK], emerged in a robe of scarlet and vermilion, her legs bare. She crossed her arms over her thin chest.
<name>Vasily</name>	Vasily	Cheolmin	“That’s rough. How did it happen?” [MASK] told the same story he recounted each time he got drunk, but with every telling the number of guards at the river, the water’s depth and temperature as his foot broke through the ice, changed.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Daehan	But when the clouds blew in another direction and the moon was bright again, [MASK] clapped his hands. “No, no, it’s a woman,” he said. “A pregnant woman, I think, from the silhouette.”
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Daehan	Tie him up,” I said. “Make him call a broker and get us out of this country. One of us can stay and watch him while the others leave—maybe [MASK]? “Or I’ll stay.” My thoughts spun beyond me.
<name>Delilah</name>	Delilah	Jangmi	He’d said that [MASK] reminded him of his mother. He’d said that he admired strong women. The way he made any excuse to be near her reminded me of me. “You look like you need a drink.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Eonni	If I opened my mouth a scream would come out. “Do you know what a computer is?” I nodded. “The man I was first sold to had one.” “There are some real perverts out there, [MASK]. I’m sorry.”
<name>Yoko</name>	Yoko	Jangmi	I find [MASK]’s letter in my neglected mailbox. The plain white envelope is the sort sold in twenty-four-hour convenience stores, and my address, a smudge of blue ink, as if she half-hoped that I would not receive it.
<name>Unni</name>	Unni	Nuna	He has known and experienced too much, but still I want to walk, to run to him, toward my real life. I take a step back. “[MASK],” he says, looking up, the vowels in “Older Sister” made long and sinuous by his slow speech.
<name>Yuna</name>	Yuna	Abeoji	All I have are her words. I wanted to know who was this “they” that my eomeoni's many alliances had saved us from. Who was always this “they”? My head filled with thoughts of [MASK] and the endless tomb of distances between us.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Suhyeon	“Go back inside, [MASK]!” said a woman with brassy dyed-red hair coiled up into a bird’s nest. Her voice crackled with displeasure, and she yanked the girl into a private room near the entrance. I never saw the girl again.
<name>Yara</name>	Yara	Brambles	He forced me to continue. When he spotted a hut inside the fold of mountains, we made a long arc around it. People were dangerous, and their grunting, barking animals more dangerous still. [MASK] grabbed at my pants. The mountain was alive.
<name>Jackson</name>	Jackson	Daehan	I turned away. Caring about someone was another weakness and I couldn’t afford to be weak again. I hobbled out of the room alone, avoiding the arm he offered me. [MASK] darted in once I left, as if he had been outside listening.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Cheolmin	A man’s head served on a platter. An ark floating while all of humanity drowned. When the rest of us sat down for lunch, [MASK] stood like a soldier and announced, “I couldn’t memorize my verse.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Seongsik	How could I be afraid when I had always taken care of myself with so little help? But I found myself jumping at a branch tapping against the windowpane. After what felt like hours, [MASK] switched on the light.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Danny	I flapped my arms and clung to the straps of the life vest. “Isn’t that [MASK]?” said some faraway voice. “What’s he doing this time?” Air bubbles rose in front of my stinging eyes. The sun became a distant spot.
<name>Yejide</name>	Yejide	Seongsik	The girl lurched backward as [MASK] struggled to hold her. I remembered being eight again and became afraid. I had licked the last of the ground-up cornmeal and bark from my bowl, then ate from my eommas bowl as well. She had let me.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Daehan	The yard of weeds as thick as a vagabond’s stubble. Then we were shuttled up exposed cement blocks that served as stairs into a common room, down a narrow corridor, and into the few unfinished rooms that we would live in. i39 [MASK] said, “Wait for me!”
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Bakjun	“I’m not eating at a table with a long-nose,” [MASK] said, standing to his full height, at age sixteen no bigger than ten-year-olds I would see in the South. “Nonsense.”
<name>Yonas</name>	Yonas	Seongsik	How could I not be? [MASK] was as slight as the orphans who snatched corn doughnuts from the hands of customers back home and ate as they were beaten—but he had saved my unborn baby. I’ve lived an unusual young life, some would say an extraordi- 2 8
<name>Nya</name>	Nya	Byeol	I’d been when I quit school as the famine swept through our country. That first day when he tried to show me the bedroom, [MASK] stretched her arms and legs across the width of the door frame and blocked me from passing. “Where are you going?”
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Daniel	“There wasn’t enough room at the saang,” she said. While she ate, I tried to read the Bible. The words of [MASK] walked in front of me. One tiny black leg of each letter ahead of the next, then the next.
<name>Quarantine</name>	Quarantine	August	“All three? And the rest of you let this happen? Do the Lord’s words mean anything to you? Do you know why you’re here and not out on the street?” “It’s [MASK]. We’ve been stuck inside for months.”
<name>Jericho</name>	Jericho	Bakjun	[MASK] held his up like a squirrel guarding an acorn in winter. “I remember the first time I had one of these after crossing. Never had anything so good.” If junk food was the height of their pleasure, I wondered if it was truly possible to imagine their world across the river.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Cheolmin	We’ve been stuck inside for months.” [MASK] scraped at his cheeks and flicked away the dead skin. “We’re living the same day over and over again and nothing’s changed. You haven’t kept your promises.” “Listen to that rain.”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	hyeong	He tilted his head my way, though I was taking every precaution and gripping the cold stair rail with both hands. “Stay still, [MASK].” I wrapped my striped scarf around his neck as he had once done for me, then tugged my ski hat over his head.
