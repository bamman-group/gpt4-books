<name>Mom</name>	Mom	David	My evenings are filled with dinner with friends, bad television movies, and planning dream vacations in sunnier climes. [MASK] dutifully calls me three times a day, as regular as three square meals. Our conversations are brief during the day, longer at night.
<name>Darcy</name>	Darcy	Parker	“I am glad for it. You are a fine-looking man even though you are an infuriating one.” [MASK] didn’t know what to say though he felt a stirring of vanity and smiled. He stretched his legs and cracked his knuckles.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Rebekah	He looked up at the fluorescent lights, shaking his head, then returned his attention to [MASK]’s mouth. And not for nothing, she smelled sublime. Most of the time, he was around old people who smelled of ointments and cheap eau de toilette
<name>John</name>	John	Parker	Women had sacrificed too much in the war and they weren’t going to stand on the sidelines, never again. During that meeting, [MASK] stood, and everyone turned to look at him, the General’s youngest son, the one who bore the General’s name.
<name>Willy</name>	Willy	Ben	“I thought you said I couldn’t.” His face stretched into what has become his smile. “We can’t live in this house.” [MASK] nodded. “We can’t live in this city, nowhere near.” “I know.”
<name>Cinnamon</name>	Cinnamon	Sierra	He likes [MASK]’s routine—how she points to the window, to the wall, and mimics the sweat dripping down her proverbial balls. He visits her at the club three times a week, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. He stays for two hours.
<name>Casey</name>	Casey	Magnus	“You should eat something,” he says. I extricate myself from the cat and walk into the galley area. [MASK] invites me to sit at the table and he sets a plate of dry scrambled eggs and a mug of coffee in front of me.
<name>Mold</name>	Mold	Bianca	The ceiling was replaced. [MASK] continued to grow, and new stains formed, traveling across the nursery ceiling late at night in deep arcs. After the third time they replaced the ceiling, her parents gave up. It was their daughter or their sanity, their marriage.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Anna	[MASK] set her eyeliner pencil, contraband from her family in the North, on the lip of the sink. “Have I ever not stood by you?” She scowled, shook her head at his reflection, and stalked out of the bathroom.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Bennett	The coarse sheets make my skin raw. I grip the headboard with one hand and hold the wall with the other, my eyes closed. [MASK] buries his head in my shoulder. Eye contact bothers him—he never wants to reveal too much of himself.
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Jacob	He wasn’t being nostalgic. I worry about the day when he leaves me, torn apart on our bed, waiting for him to put me back together again. My husband has an identical twin, [MASK]. Sometimes they switch places for days at a time.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Bennett	I’m not dissatisfied. I know who I married. And I have secrets of my own. There’s a poet, [MASK], who lives in a cabin on the other side of town. He has no telephone, lives nearly off the grid.
<name>Edie</name>	Edie	Anna	At six, sharp, [MASK] was at his parents’ home, wearing a blue dress, her hair piled on top of her head, her lips thickly covered in the bright red lipstick her mother-in-law hated.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Carolina	He ran out to greet his friend. They hugged, pounding each other’s backs in the violent way men show affection. They jumped onto the hood of the truck and cracked open beers. I turned to my sister. “What the hell are we doing here, [MASK]?”
<name>Svetlana</name>	Svetlana	Nadia	I said, “I know.” The receptionist shrugged. Soon after, I was escorted into the back. I heard interesting sounds. [MASK] had a thick Russian accent but spoke English well. “You want massage? Candles? What?” she asked.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Carolina	Our parents were long accustomed to [MASK] and me chasing after each other. Once they were assured we were safe, they sent us text messages every few days to remind us they loved us, to call if we needed anything. They didn’t understand us.
<name>Miss Daisy</name>	Miss Daisy	Elsie	A few weeks later, [MASK] was driving her golf cart to the clubhouse for Ladies Golf, slowly bouncing along the cobbled street, when she saw a light-skinned brown woman standing at the edge of her driveway, one hand shielding her eyes from the sun.
<name>Doug</name>	Doug	Darryl	For a long time, we refused to spend it. Every night, I went online and checked my account balances and thought, This is what my life was worth. My sister and I went to work with [MASK]. We sat in the backseat as he drove.
<name>she</name>	she	Milly	Her forced her thighs apart with his and started fucking her. He stared at the spot on the wall just above her headboard and then he stared into her eyes, which made her uncomfortable so [MASK] put on a good show, bouncing in rhythm enthusiastically, making the appropriate noises, feigning ecstasy.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Brad	This confuses him. Someday I’m going to become [MASK]’s boss. The very first thing I will do is fire him. My father refused to let me play basketball when I was in high school, even though I wanted to, desperately.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Jacob	On the drive home, I trace [MASK]’s knuckles and the tiny scars on his fingers, all from architecture school, making miniature models of grand ideas with sharp knives. I tell him how I wish every night could be like this night.
<name>Livingston</name>	Livingston	William	She smells like cocoa butter. When she showed up at the Livingston manse, she was hired on the spot. [MASK] promptly installed a series of surveillance cameras and microphones throughout her apartment that recorded to a hard drive he could access anywhere.
<name>Aunt Alexandra</name>	Aunt Alexandra	Teresa	It was nice that someone did. I went to visit [MASK] the first Saturday after my father died. I was driving then, almost on my way to college. At the crack of dawn, I knocked and waited, shifting from foot to foot.
<name>he</name>	he	Garrison	We are not holding hands. “This was a mistake,” [MASK] says. “I’m done with this.” I roll my eyes, open my own door, slouch in my seat as we drive away from a hope that never was.
<name>Theon</name>	Theon	Milly	“I don’t care,” [MASK] replied. He was a hairy man, his body covered in a thick mat of dark hair. Later, when he fell asleep as he lay on top of her, the whorls of hair on his chest would tickle her uncomfortably and she would say nothing.
<name>Darry</name>	Darry	Parker	She kissed his forehead and told him, “You be good for your grandparents. Don’t you forget us. Don’t forget me.” And then she went to the car to wait, telling [MASK], “I’ll leave this to you now.”
<name>He</name>	He	Joshua	I wore the pink ribbon, mostly worn to a thin shine, braided through my hair and a long white dress, no sleeves, a dress that swirled around my legs when I walked. [MASK] wore his best suit, a fine cut with clean lines.
<name>Dad</name>	Dad	Caleb	Then he notices the arc of broken blood vessels beneath my eye. His hands clench into tight fists as he approaches me. When he places soft kisses along the edges of the hurt, my face starts to ache more deeply than it ever did beneath [MASK]’s fist.
<name>Kit</name>	Kit	Ben	What we did, the way we sounded, was untamed. After, I said, “Please get me away from here,” and [MASK] said, “Say our child’s name.” I held his face and wiped away some of the soot beneath his eyes with my thumbs.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	David	“Are you cold?” [MASK] asks, with a shy smile. I nod and he pulls me close, wrapping his arms around me. His body feels narrow, almost frail against mine, as if his bones have lost some of their density.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	David	They don’t know the man I married, how betrayal comes so easily to him, so they can afford to look at him like that. [MASK] looks like he’s trying to slide out of this girl’s embrace. It’s a sad little scene.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Carolina	The detectives talked. We did not blink. They told us about the tapes; they had watched. I leaned forward, my forehead against my knees. [MASK] put her hand in the small of my back. Our parents stood to the side, slowly shaking their heads.
<name>Connor</name>	Connor	Joshua	“He didn’t mean to do a bad thing.” I nodded. “I know that, too.” [MASK] turned to look at me. “Why are you talking to me?” For once, I decided to be comfortable with a small lie.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Carolina	I have spent the best and worst moments of my life looking my sister in the eye. “You brought us here to hide,” I said. “You should have told me the truth.” [MASK] leaned down and dried my tears with her hair.
<name>Hope</name>	Hope	Joshua	We used powerful telescopes and long-abandoned instruments from the past to stare into the sky, to find some slow-burning memory of the sun. Even though our days and nights were dark and cold, I felt bright and warm everywhere. [MASK] was my sun.
<name>Death</name>	Death	Death	[MASK] makes them more beautiful. It’s something about their bodies on display in final repose—eyes wide open, lips blue, limbs stiff, skin cold. Finally, it might be said, they are at peace.
<name>Father Tim</name>	Father Tim	Mickey	She remained coy, quickly finished her beer, reapplied a fresh coat of lipstick, and hurried to the rectory, her heels echoing against the pavement. She found [MASK] kneeling next to his bed and she smiled when he looked up at her.
<name>Alaska</name>	Alaska	Joshua	The older I got, the closer we became, the more I wanted to fill everything hollow inside him. When [MASK] was sixteen and I was fifteen, a council was convened to consider ways to bring back the sun.
<name>letter</name>	letter	Anna	He thought about the lines of her body, how she was so smart it scared him, the letters she wrote—short, almost terse, but letting him know she was waiting, and still loved him. In one [MASK] said, “Don’t make me undone by loving you.”
<name>Willy</name>	Willy	Hiram	The weight of them tired him but he had important business to attend to. He needed to fill the impossible emptiness inside him. [MASK] listened as the salesman tried to sell him a fancy air machine with linen seats and slick lines but that’s not what he needed.
<name>Cheryl</name>	Cheryl	Caridad	[MASK] walked the length of the studio, picking up discarded water bottles. “How are you enjoying the neighborhood?” she asked. The woman offered a small smile, waving her hands in front of her. “This all takes a little getting used to.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Parker	[MASK] approached his father slowly, squeezed the older man’s shoulder. “I don’t want you to say anything. I am just telling you where things stand.” The General grunted and the men stood, together, in silence for quite a long time.
<name>He</name>	He	Garrison	Here we are, with scores of other people who have also chosen to ignore these facts. We are all arrogant assholes. “Maybe we don’t deserve to have kids,” I say. [MASK] turns to me. “What makes you say that?”
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Ben	He did. I went slack and hoped he would beat me until my bones finally softened. When he was done, he said, “There’s something wrong with you.” Later, [MASK] called as the baby wailed lustily like an old sorrowful woman.
<name>Baby</name>	Baby	Volver	She thinks about the food he had gone to pick up and his sweet voice when he serenades her with “[MASK].” She doesn’t have time for this. She says, “If you don’t leave, I’m going to call the police.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Hanna	He screamed so softly it made the hairs on her arm stand on end. [MASK] still sees that boy around town once in a while. He’s not a boy anymore but he walks with a hitch and always crosses to the other side of the street when he sees her coming.
<name>Dill</name>	Dill	Dennis	We had been in the courthouse three years earlier seeking something but we didn’t speak of it that day. We pretended we had every reason to celebrate. [MASK] reached into a backpack and pulled out two warm beers.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Joshua	If there had been sun, there would have been hundreds of tiny prisms of light. His hands shaking, red and probably numb, [MASK] grabbed that man from where he sat, that man’s lips curling into an ugly smile.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Maker	He was in the front seat, drinking [MASK]’s Mark from a bottle wrapped in a brown paper bag. He and my mother had just had another heated argument and he had dragged me out of the house as if I would ever choose his side.
<name>she</name>	she	Carolina	“Don’t make trouble. Me and your sister are going to be good friends.” “Like hell,” [MASK] said, rushing at him again. He swatted her away and tossed a box of Fruit Roll-Ups on the floor and left us alone.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Carolina	After we heard him walk away, [MASK] told me to untie her. I stood in the corner, wanted to wrap the walls around us. My sister studied me for a long time. “What did he do?” I looked at my shoes.
<name>Alaska</name>	Alaska	Carolina	It did not matter. [MASK] pulled the letter out of her pocket and held the corner to the open flame of a lighter before tossing the burning letter into the air. We lay down on the runway, holding hands. The flame burned white, then extinguished.
<name>she</name> (Note: The prompt specifies that the answer must be a proper name, but in this case, the sentence does not provide any context clues to suggest a specific name.)	she (Note: The prompt specifies that the answer must be a proper name, but in this case, the sentence does not provide any context clues to suggest a specific name.)	Bianca	She would sit in the middle and throw her arms back, her face open to the wet sky. “I haven’t been on one of these in years,” [MASK] said, walking around the contraption slowly, touching each of the handrails.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Bianca	He felt all the strength he had ever possessed seep from his pores. [MASK] moaned louder, stopped moving, planted her hands against his chest. “What’s wrong?” she asked. She kissed his chin, nipped at his lower lip with her teeth, tickled his neck.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Carolina	“A couple hours.” [MASK] set her crossword down and led me back to my room. She helped me out of my jeans and pulled a clean T-shirt over my head. She washed my face with a cool washcloth and crawled into bed with me.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Ben	“Say his name.” “Harder,” I said. The baby giggled. She grabbed his shirt and mine, like she was trying to pull us into each other. [MASK] stilled and looked down at the baby. He let go of me.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Gus	Our hands are scraped but shiny and slick. We smile at each other. This is the most I will ever love another person. When [MASK] comes over a few nights later, he is holding a chubby baby thigh. He has shaved his beard.
<name>Darry</name>	Darry	Ben	We’d listen to it all night, pretending we were asleep, pretending sleep was possible. It was hot in there, smelled like motor oil and dirt and grass clippings. [MASK] kept his arms wrapped around me, never let me go.
<name>Abigail</name>	Abigail	Anna	[MASK] wasn’t a cold woman, nothing of the sort. When they first met, at a town meeting, she was bold, making eyes at him in such a way there could be no misunderstanding her intentions.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Amelia	I returned to my office, accepted the postdoc position, and never looked back. I would have named our daughter [MASK]. She would have been beautiful despite her father. She would have been four months old when I left. Snow has been falling incessantly.
<name>Jeff</name>	Jeff	William	He used to think his wealth was a burden but quickly realized what he could get away with. [MASK] rents office space so he has a reason to leave the house. Other than monitoring his investments online, he doesn’t work.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Carolina	As we turned onto our street, our father cleared his throat and tried to sound happy. “At least this is over.” An ugly sound came out of [MASK]’s mouth. My father gripped the steering wheel tighter. The new hotel was much nicer.
<name>Janice</name>	Janice	Nadia	She pulled her purse closer to her body and looked away. I pressed my hand against my neighbor’s shoulder as we passed. She still refused to look at me but she leaned into my touch. Now [MASK] stares at me when she’s on her lanai
<name>the priest</name>	the priest	Mickey	She gave very little thought to his spiritual obligations. They were minor details and if there was guilt to be had on the subject, she left that to [MASK], who did, after all, deal in such things.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Carolina	As we drove to the airfield, I sat in the backseat, staring at the freckles on his neck pointing toward his spine from his hairline in a wide V When [MASK] leaned into him like they had never separated, I looked away.
<name>Zitkala-Ša</name>	Zitkala-Ša	Joshua	When [MASK] walked to the front of the classroom, they hissed. The ones who thought they were clever called him a Son of a Sun Stealer. He kept on holding his head high, always, just like his mother, because he came from good people worth minding.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Kate	“Can I buy you a drink?” I look at the pathetic tomatoes in my basket and maybe it’s the overwhelming brightness of the fluorescent lighting or the easy listening being piped through the store speakers but I nod. I say, “My name is [MASK].”
<name>June</name>	June	Marcy	She liked how for an hour, there was a precise set of instructions she was meant to follow, a clear sense of direction. The other wives were quietly fascinated by [MASK] in that she was a rare species in the wealthy enclave—a first wife.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Anna	He had a sturdy home and a warm bed. His wife, [MASK], lay next to him, sleeping soundly or, he suspected, pretending to sleep soundly so he wouldn’t paw at her the way he typically did when he couldn’t sleep.
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Elsie	“I imagine you’ll want to invite the new family over, perhaps dinner, something from home.” [MASK] took a careful sip of her wine, then twisted the heavy diamond on her finger as she sank into her seat. “Why would you imagine that?”
<name>The woman</name>	The woman	Caridad	“How are you enjoying the neighborhood?” she asked. The woman offered a small smile, waving her hands in front of her. “This all takes a little getting used to.” [MASK] arched an eyebrow. “I can imagine.”
<name>he</name> (Note: There is no proper name that fits the context of the sentence)	he (Note: There is no proper name that fits the context of the sentence)	Carmen	He almost fucked the maid once. It was late at night and he went to her room, his bathrobe cinched tightly around his waist. When [MASK] answered her door, it was clear he had woken her up. She crossed her arms across her chest, shifted nervously.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Ben	He started clapping her hands together and singing a silly song. I felt the scar across my stomach stretch tightly. I ran to the bathroom and reached the toilet just in time, heaving until my back ached. [MASK] appeared in the doorway. “Are you okay?”
<name>She</name>	She	Mara	She went to the kitchen and prepared him a sandwich with thick sliced meat and tomato, a glass of cold milk. She smelled him everywhere, felt him everywhere. When he was of a certain mind, the weight of him was inescapable. [MASK] loved that about her husband.
<name>Hannibal</name>	Hannibal	Mickey	[MASK] willed the muscles in his throat to pull each carefully cut piece of meat into his stomach. He paused only to take sips of wine, cheap, red. He paused often. By the end of the meal, his stomach ached.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Steven	“I found her wandering in the woods while I was looking for my dog,” [MASK] said. “I wish I could have found her sooner.” My parents grew silent, took a hard look at me, said they hardly recognized me.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Teresa	“He loved spending Saturdays with you,” she finally said. I shook my head. “He loved spending Saturdays with you.” [MASK] smiled sadly. “It’s not that simple.” I shrugged, slid lower in my seat, lit another cigarette.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Magnus	He places his hands over mine and I learn how to milk a cow. Nothing makes sense here. Hunting season starts. [MASK] shows me his rifle, long, polished, powerful. He refers to his rifle as a “she” and a “her.”
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Garrison	When [MASK] chases after his nieces and nephews on Sunday afternoons, he smiles so widely that his features rearrange themselves to accommodate the stretch of his lips. He laughs from somewhere deep and when he finally catches one of them, he throws them over his head, their legs tangling with his arms.
<name>Destiny</name>	Destiny	Sierra	He uses a condom. He doesn’t know where the stripper has been. He practices some of the lingo he has learned from years of listening to rap music. “I’ve wanted to get all up in that since the day I first saw you, [MASK].
<name>Destiny</name>	Destiny	Sarah	At first, [MASK] was a mess of a stripper. She couldn’t dance. She didn’t like being watched. She didn’t want to be touched. She hated the pretense of the gowns that quickly hit the floor when she was onstage or giving a lap dance.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Ben	He said he always knew he would love a woman with a three-syllable name. I wasn’t sure which [MASK] I was looking at and then he came to me and pressed his nose in my hair and told me I smelled like the night air.
<name>Pinkie</name>	Pinkie	Jack	She used to try, to change the world, but she learned better. [MASK] is a troubled man. He has done time in county lockup, not hard time, but enough time where he has learned things about how to be the best kind of bad man.
<name>Hannibal</name>	Hannibal	Spencer	“I need to be with a man I understand.” [MASK] cleared his throat. “Pay strict attention to what I say because I choose my words carefully and I never repeat myself. I’ve told you my name: that’s the who.”
<name>John</name>	John	Magnus	The world feels too big. “I’d better get back to my colleagues,” I say, standing up. As I walk away, he shouts, “My name is [MASK]!” I throw a hand in the air but don’t look back.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Steven	[MASK] flashed his perfect smile but could no longer look me in the eye as he leaned in, held my wrist, kissed my cheek. I moaned softly and hunched over, vomiting into the bed of yellow daisies surrounding the mailbox.
<name>he</name>	he	Garrison	The long line of cars waiting to enter the fairgrounds begins to move and [MASK] edges forward in his seat, his forehead practically pressed against the hot windshield. I cannot believe how many people are here—I whisper the prison-pressed license plate numbers from all over the country.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Garrison	We are saved from making such a fateful decision when the mechanic interrupts our staring contest, wiping his hands clean. “That should get you back to where you’re going,” he says. [MASK] pays for the repairs with money we don’t have
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Bianca	She looked up, held her stride. A new stain slowly spread across the panel. She continued running. Later, at work, [MASK] sat at her desk and ate a sensible lunch— a turkey sandwich with mustard, lettuce, and tomato.
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Brad	It is an ordeal. [MASK] always manages to sit next to me at these retreats. He draws vulgar little pictures on his legal pad and then nudges it toward me until I look down and show some interest in his sad little drawings.
<name>he</name>	he	Hiram	She tried to ignore the soft ache in her chest that bloomed, slowly, into a nervousness she couldn’t quite make sense of. When [MASK] finished, he stood and took his plate to the sink, washed it clean, dried it carefully, set it on the counter.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Natasha	“That really is it, [MASK].” He unstrapped the baby from his chest and handed her to me. “Stay here.” “Don’t,” I said, grabbing his arm. He shook his head and ran out of the house.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Caridad	Each morning before work, [MASK] stared at her reflection in the mirror and practiced not rolling her eyes so she could smile politely at the ladies in her classes. One of the community’s newest residents lingered in the studio after the Zumba class.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Gus	I hold the baby arm and marvel at how small and perfect it is, how each finger is exactly where it is supposed to be, slightly curled toward the wrist. I use the baby arm to trace my sort-of boyfriend’s arm. His name is [MASK].
<name>John</name>	John	Parker	I thought to myself, This boy will be able to carry the weight of my name. I was right about that.” The General’s voice cracked and he held on to [MASK]’s arm. “I was right,” he said, again, softly.
<name>John</name>	John	Parker	Long after the train had departed, [MASK] stayed on the platform, his legs locked stiffly. He didn’t know how to stop crying, didn’t want his woman to see how broken down he was. She did, eventually, because she came and found him.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Ben	We’d wake up on Saturday mornings and say, “We are doing yard work today.” We’d giggle because our fathers do yard work, raking their yards in sandals and knee-high socks. [MASK] rushed to me and rubbed my back.
<name>Tyler</name>	Tyler	Ben	I said, “Please, if you love me, hit me.” My voice was so ugly and hungered. If [MASK] would break the broken places in me a little more, if he would break whatever was left of me beneath my skin, I could finally break all the way down.
<name>John</name>	John	Anna	“And foolish pride is worse yet.” “Am I a foolish proud man?” [MASK] pulled away. “We will not fall asleep tonight listening to the breathing of our son. You are not a foolish man but you are proud.”
<name>He</name>	He	Darryl	I pretended to be deeply absorbed in the menu and its array of cheap meats and fried food. [MASK] kicked me beneath the table. I set my menu down. “Must you?” He slapped the table. “The gang’s together again.”
