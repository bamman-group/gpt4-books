<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Leamas	“Get back,” [MASK] hissed. “Get your hand away. How the hell can I see if you wave your hand around like that?” Slamming the car into first gear he drove fast across the wide road.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Ashe	“It’s bloody good of you—” he made an awkward gesture with his hand, “—all this.” [MASK] gave him a pat on the shoulder, picked up his army macintosh, and left.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Leamas	It meant nothing to [MASK] that he was watched, but as he walked through the improvised doorway from the lodge to the hut, and stood in the guards’ bedroom, he had the distinct feeling that something was wrong. The lights in the annexe were controlled from some central point.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Alec	[MASK], why is he letting us go?” “He’s letting us go because we’ve done our job. Get into the car, quick!” Under the compulsion of his extraordinary will she got into the car and closed the door.
<name>Leamas</name>	Leamas	Peters	They’re not fools; they’d know who to look for. For all you and I know they’re on to us now.” [MASK] nodded: “You could, of course, come somewhere ... safer, couldn’t you?” “Behind the Curtain?”
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Peters	Broken service of course—reduction of pension rights and the usual crabbing. Am I going too fast?” “Not for the moment,” [MASK] replied, pouring him some more whisky; “we’ll discuss it again of course, with names and dates.”
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Leamas	You’ll have to sit on top and pull the girl up. Do you understand?” “We understand,” said [MASK]. “How long have we got?” “If you drive at thirty kilometres we shall be there in about nine minutes.
<name>Olga</name>	Olga	Liz	She turned to the woman again and asked: “Why are we waiting here?” The wardress pushed the plate aside and stood up. “For instructions,” she replied. “They are deciding whether you must stay.” “Stay?” repeated [MASK] blankly.
<name>Strasser</name>	Strasser	Fiedler	You’re not a country at all, you’re not a government, you’re a fifth-rate dictatorship of political neurotics.” Jabbing his finger in [MASK]’s direction, he shouted: “I know you, you sadistic bastard; it’s typical of you.
<name>Leamas</name>	Leamas	Leamas	“And that justifies, for instance, the taking of human life? That justifies the bomb in the crowded restaurant; that justifies your write-off rate of agents—all that?” [MASK] shrugged. “I suppose so.”
<name>Leiter</name>	Leiter	Peters	It was an old Mercedes 180 and he got in without a word. [MASK] sat beside him in the back. As they pulled out they overtook a small DKW with two men sitting in the front. Twenty yards down the road there was a telephone kiosk.
<name>He</name>	He	Mundt	She noticed that [MASK] hesitated, drew back even, when they came upon other corridors, would go ahead and confirm that no one was coming, then signal her forward. He seemed to assume that she would follow, that she knew the reason.
<name>Leamas</name>	Leamas	Leamas	“I know he is.” “This morning you said he’d come across with the workmen.” [MASK] turned on him. “Agents aren’t aeroplanes. They don’t have schedules. He’s blown, he’s on the run, he’s frightened.
<name>Strike</name>	Strike	Leamas	“Oh no.” He smiled. “Oh no, you haven’t. You have told us all you are conscious of knowing.” “Bloody clever,” [MASK] muttered, pushing his food aside and lighting a cigarette—his last.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Fiedler	The steep wooded hills on either side gradually yielded their colours to the gathering dusk until they stood grey and lifeless in the twilight. “Whatever happens,” [MASK] said, “don’t worry. It will be all right, do you understand?”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Leamas	“Yes,” said the man; “but I can’t give it to you; he said I shouldn’t give it to you ... that you were sure to ask for it.” [MASK] laughed quietly. “He would,” he said.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Alec	“But that night, the night before it happened, we talked together. We had supper, a sort of special one; [MASK] said we should and I knew that it was our last night. He’d got a bottle of red wine from somewhere; I didn’t like it much.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Mulligan	It was [MASK] who’d proposed it—“Our young, vigorous, and attractive comrade—” He’d thought she’d sleep with him if he got her made secretary. The others had voted for her because they liked her, and because she could type.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Leamas	[MASK] asked, “you’d have time then. If you’re pushed you can work another half-hour in the evening. If you’re pressed.” She stayed for some moments, just watching him and obviously thinking of something to say.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Fiedler	Then like the touch of mercy itself, a cool cloth was laid across his forehead, and kindly hands carried him away. He woke on a hospital bed, and standing at the foot of it was [MASK], smoking a cigarette. 18
<name>Prentice</name>	Prentice	Leamas	He listened for a minute or two and then drifted towards the bookshelves. He noticed a girl in one of the alcoves standing on a ladder sorting large volumes. “I’m the new man,” he said, “my name’s [MASK].”
<name>Hitler</name>	Hitler	Mundt	We planned the thing as if it was all a bit of a game ... it’s hard to explain now. We knew we had our backs to the wall: we’d failed against [MASK] and now we were going to try and kill him.
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Leamas	It has the virtue of an apparent accident, in which the prisoner’s mess tin is upturned, and its contents spilt on his uniform. [MASK] was barged from one side, while from the other an obliging hand descended on his forearm, and the thing was done.
<name>Hastings</name>	Hastings	Peters	I can’t remember much about that part—I began hitting the bottle a bit. Had rather a bad patch.” He lit a cigarette. [MASK] nodded. “That was why they gave me the push, really. They didn’t like me drinking.”
<name>Poirot</name>	Poirot	Fiedler	I would have known, d’you see? How many times do I have to say that? I would have known!” “Quite so,” said [MASK] softly, “of course you would.” He stood up and went to the window.
<name>Max</name>	Max	Leamas	[MASK] took a key from his pocket. “You’ll want somewhere to stay,” he said. His voice sounded flat. “There’s an apartment in the Albrecht-Durer-Strasse, next to the Museum. Number 28A. You’ll find everything you want.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Fiedler	“You all know why we are here. The proceedings are secret, remember that. This is a Tribunal convened expressly by the Praesidium. It is to the Praesidium alone that we are responsible. We shall hear evidence as we think fit.” She pointed perfunctorily towards [MASK].
<name>himself</name>	himself	Alec	There was a very long silence and the little man looked more worried than ever. Finally he asked her: “Do you believe that?” “I don’t know.” She was suddenly terrified for [MASK], and she didn’t know why.
<name>Leamas</name>	Leamas	Leamas	[MASK] said nothing, just stared through the window of the checkpoint, along the empty street. “You can’t wait forever, sir. Maybe he’ll come some other time. We can have the polizei contact the Agency: you can be back here in twenty minutes.”
<name>She</name>	She	Liz	That you would always love him?” “Yes,” [MASK] replied simply. “Did he say he would send you money?” “He said ... he said things weren’t as bad as they seemed . .. that I would be . .
<name>Stavrogin</name>	Stavrogin	Mundt	It was a very peculiar sensation!” “That’s one way of putting it.” “No, no; not physically. Physically it was a nightmare, but you see [MASK] had a special interest in beating me up. Apart from the confession.”
<name>Alfie</name>	Alfie	Leamas	This was heresy beyond bearing, since it was true. “I don’t know you,” the grocer repeated thickly, “and I don’t like you. Now get out of my shop.” And he tried to recover the parcel which unfortunately [MASK] was already holding.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Kiever	“Take them,” [MASK] repeated, angry again. “It’s disgusting, leaving dirty crockery there like that.” The waiter just turned and walked away. He didn’t go near the service counter and he didn’t order their coffee.
<name>Leiter</name>	Leiter	Leamas	With a nod the elder man accepted it, half filled each coffee mug and topped them up with black coffee. “Where’s the American gone?” asked [MASK]. “Who?” “The CIA boy. The one who was with me.”
<name>He</name>	He	Fiedler	They went for a walk that afternoon, following the gravel road down into the valley, then branching into the forest along a broad, pitted track lined with felled timber. All the time, [MASK] probed, giving nothing.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Liz	It was a foul, foul operation. But it’s paid off, and that’s the only rule.” As he spoke his voice rose, until finally he was nearly shouting. “You’re trying to convince yourself,” [MASK] cried.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Liz	“Oh God,” thought [MASK], “if he’s dead I don’t think I can touch him,” but she went to him and he was alive. Drawing the curtains, she knelt beside the bed.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Leamas	But there was an endurance, a defined purpose in his manner which [MASK] could sense and admire. “You have presented us with an intriguing problem,” he observed. “I’ve told you all I know.” “Oh no.” He smiled.
<name>Bourne</name>	Bourne	Peters	“What do you suggest?” “A new identity. Scandinavian passport perhaps. Money.” “It’s very academic,” [MASK] replied, “but I will suggest it to my superiors. Are you coming with me?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Leamas	The sooner it’s all done, the sooner you can go home. Have some food and go to bed.” “You know perfectly well I can’t go home,” [MASK] retorted. “You’ve seen to that.
<name>Wainwright</name>	Wainwright	Control	Do you see any objection to that?” “It might work. It depends on whether [MASK] has been corresponding with the bank independently, over my forged signature. It might not fit in.” “I do not see that we have much to lose.”
<name>Hardy</name>	Hardy	Leamas	And then he added: “Are you taking the car back?” “As soon as you get out of the car I shall drive it away. It is a danger for me, too,” the man replied. “Too bad,” said [MASK] drily.
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Leamas	If so, what were they talking about?” “They weren’t talking at all when I came back.” “Thank you. You may sit down.” [MASK] returned to his seat at the back of the room.
<name>Dorothy</name>	Dorothy	Elizabeth	“No.” “Did he know you were a Communist?” “Yes. I told him.” “What did he say when you told him then, [MASK]?” She didn’t know whether to lie, that was the terrible thing.
<name>He</name>	He	Leamas	\ 22 The President She entered the court slowly, looking around her, wide-eyed, like a half-woken child entering a brightly lit room. [MASK] had forgotten how young she was. When she saw him sitting between two guards she stopped.
<name>Goldstein</name>	Goldstein	Mundt	I’d have killed [MASK] if I could, I hate his guts; but not now. It so happens that they need him. They need him so that the great moronic mass that you admire can sleep soundly in their beds at night.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Liz	[MASK] shook her head. She must show interest, she must make the woman talk. “He said it would never have happened if a couple of writers had been shot in time.” “Who will they shoot now?”
<name>Tanner</name>	Tanner	Leamas	“Yes. Fifteen thousand pounds to be drawn on a Bern bank.” “Yes.” “He said you might have follow-up questions during the next year,” said [MASK], “you would pay another five thousand if I kept myself available.”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Leamas	He would direct his mind towards her briefly like the shutter of a camera, recall for a moment the softhard touch of her long body, then put her from his memory. [MASK] was not a man accustomed to living on dreams.
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Leamas	My bloody head’s ...” “And after that where did you go? Why did you shake off your followers, why were you so keen to shake them off?” [MASK] said nothing: he was breathing in sharp gasps, his head buried in his hands.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Peters	He had three strings to his bow: the Praesidium, straightforward internal political and economic reporting, and access to the files of the East German Security Service.” “But only limited access. They’d never give an outsider the run of all their files,” [MASK] insisted.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Control	He sees the necessity but he wants no part in it. His fever,” [MASK] added with a whimsical smile, “is recurrent.” “He didn’t exactly receive me with open arms.” “Quite. He wants no part in it.
<name>Banking</name>	Banking	Leamas	Most of the jobs in Banking could have been done by an office boy were it not for the high degree of secrecy involved, and thus Banking was one of several Sections of the Service which were regarded as laying-out places for officers shortly to be buried. [MASK] went to seed.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Liz	She didn’t trust the caressing voice and the good-fairy face. “I don’t know.” “But you thought about it?” ipi “Yes.” “Well, what conclusion did you come to?” “None,” said [MASK] flatly.
<name>She</name>	She	Liz	“Good-bye,” and then: “Don’t follow me. Not again.” [MASK] nodded and muttered: “Like we said.” She was thankful for the biting cold of the street and for the dark which hid her tears.
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Elizabeth	“How much money do you earn, [MASK]?” “Six pounds a week.” “Have you any savings?” “A little. A few pounds.” “How much is the rent of your flat?” “Fifty shillings a week.”
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Peters	“Your people must be laughing themselves sick. Or did they give the tip-off themselves?” “You overrate your own importance,” [MASK] said sourly. “Then why do you have me followed, tell me that? I went for a walk this morning.
<name>Werner</name>	Werner	Smiley	Now everyone was shouting, English, French, and German mixed; he heard [MASK]’s voice from quite close: “The girl, where’s the girl?” Shielding his eyes he looked down at the foot of the wall and at last he managed to see her, lying still.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Mundt	You’ll have to lie low over here while the chemistry works itself out; but you won’t mind that I’m sure. I’ve agreed to keep you on operational subsistence until [MASK] is eliminated: that seemed the fairest way.” And now this.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Karden	“Yes, indeed,” [MASK] declared, “it was masterly. I may take it, then, that you have no money at all?” “You may.” “Have you friends who would lend you money, give it to you perhaps?
<name>Haydon</name>	Haydon	Alec	Peculation was the one sin Personnel would never let you forget—and they never forgot it themselves. If it was true that [MASK] had robbed the Circus, he would take the wrath of Personnel with him to the grave—and Personnel would not so much as pay for the shroud.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mundt	He even knew about that lease—amazing really. I mean, how could he have found out; she didn’t tell anyone. I know that girl; I understand her ... she wouldn’t tell anyone at all.” He glanced towards [MASK].
<name>Stone</name>	Stone	Fiedler	“What is your age?” “Fifty.” “Are you married?” “No” “But you were.” “I’m not married now.” “What is your profession?” “Assistant librarian.” [MASK] angrily intervened.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Control	“Fascinating.” “Where do I go now? On ice?” “Better let [MASK] tell you, old boy.” “Do you know?” “Of course.” “Then why the hell don’t you tell me?”
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Leamas	Did they really let him cross borders on his own passport with a forged one in his pocket? I doubt it,” said [MASK]. It was time he clouded the issue, let him chase a hare. “What do you mean?”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Mundt	Nothing at all. Nothing to think about, just the savage pain. He must have lain there hours before they came. It grew hot from the light, he was thirsty but he refused to call out. At last the door opened and [MASK] stood there.
<name>Werner</name>	Werner	Leamas	“You’ll have to move away from here,” he said. “It’s forbidden to obstruct the crossing point.” [MASK] half turned. “Go to hell,” he snapped. The German stiffened, but the woman said: “Get in.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Leamas	I’ll tell you why—he was their man; they turned him, they caught him, don’t you see and that was the price of his freedom—that and the money he was paid.” “I tell you you’re out of your mind!” [MASK] hissed.
<name>James</name>	James	Control	Would you care for a drink?” “No. I want to get away tonight, [MASK]. Go down to the country and get some exercise. Is the House open?” “I’ve arranged a car,” he said.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Liz	They’re the poor sods who try to keep the preachers from blowing each other sky high.” “You’re wrong,” [MASK] declared hopelessly; “they’re more wicked than all of us.” “Because I made love to you when you thought I was a tramp?”
<name>Reggie</name>	Reggie	Karl	Mind you, he had every right to snigger—it was a pretty ridiculous performance. We laughed about it together a bit, as a matter of fact. There wouldn’t have been any point in pricking [MASK]’s vanity; the whole meeting was supposed to give him a shot in the arm.”
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Leamas	“I say, a cheque is all right by you, isn’t it?” Colouring a little, [MASK] replied: “I haven’t got a bank at the moment—only just back from abroad, something I’ve got to fix up.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Control	[MASK] had done it—he was sure. The terms had been too generous, he’d known that all along. They didn’t throw money about like that for nothing—not unless they thought they might lose you.
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Liz	But it’s nothing, nothing at all besides other wars—the last or the next.” “Oh God,” said [MASK] softly. “You don’t understand. You don’t want to. You’re trying to persuade yourself.
<name>He</name>	He	Peter	we’d sent him packing. Afterwards we found out we’d made a mistake. [MASK] had the idea of fitting that in—as if we’d turned it down because we already knew. That was clever. “You can imagine the rest.
<name>Querell</name>	Querell	Fiedler	I can see them working it out, they’re so damned academic; I can see them sitting round a fire in one of their smart bloody clubs. They knew it was no good just eliminating [MASK]—he might have told friends, published accusations: they had to eliminate suspicion.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Leamas	As they pushed their way through the revolving glass door, [MASK] looked back. Standing at the newspaper kiosk, deep in a copy of the Continental Daily Mail, stood a small, froglike figure in glasses, an earnest, worried little man. He looked like a civil servant.
<name>Mrs. Hudson</name>	Mrs. Hudson	Ginnie	“Such a silly girl,” he said, almost to himself. “It seems extraordinary they can’t find good ones anymore. I do wish [MASK] wouldn’t go on holiday at times like this.” He stirred his coffee disconsolately for a while.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Smiley	“Yes.” Sound and sight were becoming confused in the mad throbbing in his brain. His eyes were hot and painful. He felt sick. “Well, when did you last see [MASK]?” “I don’t remember ... I don’t remember.”
<name>he</name>	he	Peters	There [MASK] hesitated a second, standing beneath the light over the door, then put his suitcase on the ground beside him, deliberately removed his newspaper from beneath his arm, folded it, pushed 107 it into the left pocket of his raincoat and picked up his suitcase again.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Leamas	“Twenty of the best,” he said, and filled in the date on the cheque form. Then he looked up at [MASK], all wide-eyed and accommodating. “I say, a cheque is all right by you, isn’t it?”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Leamas	[MASK] was lost. He’d heard the man talked a lot of drivel before getting the knife in, but he’d never heard anything like this before. “I mean you’ve got to compare method with method, and ideal with ideal.
<name>Quilp</name>	Quilp	Leamas	They were beginning to know [MASK] there. They were beginning to know him elsewhere too, the grey, shambling figure from the Mansions. Not a wasted word did he speak, not a friend, neither man, woman, nor beast did he have.
<name>He</name>	He	Leamas	When the evening came she walked home and cried herself to sleep. The next morning she arrived early at the library. She somehow felt that the sooner she got there, the sooner [MASK] might come; but as the morning dragged on her hopes faded, and she knew he would never come.
<name>Mathilde</name>	Mathilde	Liz	[MASK] did not turn round to look at him as he got in. She was staring stiffly forward, down the street at the falling rain. Drive at thirty kilometres,” the man said. His voice was taut, frightened. “I’ll tell you the way.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alec	She was becoming frightened for herself; these questions which proceeded from charges and suspicions of which she knew nothing. They must know she wanted to help [MASK], that she was afraid, but no one helped her—why would no one help her?
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Fiedler	[MASK] shook his head. “You are a very proud man,” he observed, “but never mind. Eat your supper and go to bed.” One of the guards came in with a tray of food—black bread, sausage, and cold green salad.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Leamas	“I’m no prude, mind, just rational. If I want a woman I know cheaper ways of finding one; if I want to dance I know better places to do it.” [MASK] might not have been listening.
<name>Leiter</name>	Leiter	Peters	Until you have I am not expendable?” “That is roughly the position.” “When you have completed the interrogation, what will you do with me?” [MASK] shrugged. “What do you suggest?” “A new identity. Scandinavian passport perhaps.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Leamas	She always knew that there was something deeply wrong with [MASK], and that one day, for some reason she could not understand, he might break and she would never see him again. She tried to tell him she knew; she said to him one evening:
<name>Leamas</name>	Leamas	Leamas	And there she was, out there in her car, knowing everything, the whole network, the safe house, everything; and [MASK] swore, not for the first time, never to trust an agent again. He went to the telephone and dialled the number of his flat.
<name>Miss Marple</name>	Miss Marple	Liz	A man in a brown overall and grey trilby hat looked round the door and said: “Girl?” “There’s someone seriously ill in the top flat,” said [MASK], “he can’t get to the front door to open it.
<name>Leiter</name>	Leiter	Kiever	They walked from the Customs shed along the corridor to the reception hall on the other side of the airport buildings. [MASK] led the way to the main exit, between the little groups of travellers staring vaguely at kiosk displays of scent, cameras, and fruit.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Liz	He looked at her in astonishment for a moment, then laughed. “Oh, [MASK] ... oh no. You’re not a bloody Communist?” She nodded, blushing like a small girl at his laughter, angry and relieved that he didn’t care.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Mundt	The trim, agile figure, the clear line of the cheek and the short fair hair just touched by the light behind him. “It’s [MASK],” he said, “Come with me, at once.”
<name>Kafka</name>	Kafka	Leamas	I always assumed someone else took care of the correspondence.” “But you never did actually know of such correspondence?” [MASK] shook his head: “You’ve got it all wrong,” he said; “you’ve got it all out of proportion.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Mundt	“He packed it up after the Fennan case.” “Ah—the case in which [MASK] was involved. Have you ever seen him since?” “Once or twice.” “Have you seen him since you left the Circus?”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Leamas	They shoot on sight within the area of the wall. You must get over.” “We know,” [MASK] repeated; “he told me.” “From the moment you get out of the car you are in the area.” “We know.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Leamas	“I was followed till lunch time,” [MASK] said. They went into the little drawing-room. There were books everywhere. It was a pretty room; tall, with eighteenth-century mouldings, long windows, and a good fireplace.
<name>Renzo</name>	Renzo	Fiedler	“Are you offering me a woman?” he asked. “Yes.” “No, thank you. Unlike you, I haven’t reached the stage where I need a pimp.” [MASK] seemed indifferent to his reply. He went on quickly.
