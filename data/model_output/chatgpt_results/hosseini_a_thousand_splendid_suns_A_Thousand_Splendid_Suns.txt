<name>someone</name>	someone	Mariam	She was stooped over and was grunting, trying to reach for the paper bag of belongings that she had put down in order to open the door. Her face was grimacing with effort. She looked up and saw [MASK].
<name>the concierge</name>	the concierge	Sayeed	There is a lounge area to the right of the reception desk, with several chairs and two couches upholstered in beige suede. In the corner, facing the couches, is a television, and [MASK], the concierge, and several guests are gathered in front of.
<name>Shahrazad</name>	Shahrazad	Shari’a	His companions nodded and looked at him with admiration. “Something tells me you are not a wicked woman, hamshira. But you have done a wicked thing. And you must pay for this thing you have done. [MASK] is not vague on this matter.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Mariam	You don’t want a good life for me. You ’re the one with the wretched heart. There was a lookout, on the edge of the clearing, where [MASK] liked to go. She sat there now, on dry, warm grass.
<name>Maya</name>	Maya	Mariam	As he dried with a towel, she put before him a steaming bowl of daal and a plate of fluffy white rice. This was the first meal she had cooked for him, and [MASK] wished she had been in a better state when she made it.
<name>Fatima</name>	Fatima	Laila	She gave [MASK] a nod and a slow, sad, close-lipped smile. From a cassette player, a man’s nasal voice chanted verses from the Koran. In between, the women sighed and shifted and sniffled.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Rasheed	[MASK] sighed again, more irritably this time, turned down the volume once more. He rubbed his forehead wearily. “What now?” “I’ve been thinking, that maybe we should have a proper burial. For the baby, I mean.
<name>their</name>	their	Wakil	“Stay close,” he said. They sat on the bench adjacent to [MASK] and his family’s. It was a sunny, warm morning, the sky streaked only by a few wispy clouds hovering in the distance over the hills.
<name>Hope</name>	Hope	Rasheed	“Let them come,” he said. “I, for one, will shower them with rose petals.” They went out that day, the four of them, [MASK] leading them from one bus to the next, to greet their new world, their new leaders.
<name>someone</name> (There is no clear indication or context to suggest a specific name.)	someone (There is no clear indication or context to suggest a specific name.)	Laila	The sky is blue, and [MASK] sees no clumps of clouds in the horizon. Holding hands, the three of them make their way to the bus stop. The streets are busy already, teeming with a steady stream of rickshaws, taxicabs, UN trucks, buses, ISAF jeeps.
<name>he</name>	he	Laila	She would find it increasingly exhausting to conjure up, to dust off, to resuscitate once again what was long dead. There would come a day, in fact, years later, when [MASK] would no longer bewail his loss. Or not as relentlessly; not nearly.
<name>Laila</name>	Laila	Laila	As [MASK] reached for the curtains, she saw a car pass by on the street tailed by a cloud of dust. It was the blue Benz with the Herat license plate finally leaving. She followed it with her eyes until it vanished around a turn, its back window twinkling in the sun.
<name>Junior</name>	Junior	Naghma	[MASK] would hand-wrap the live wire around the base of the lightbulb then to make a circuit. The toilets were closet-sized, the cement floor cracked. There was a small, rectangular hole in the ground, at the bottom of which was a heap of feces.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Mariam	As a result, [MASK] gained some notoriety among them, became a kind of celebrity. The women eyed her with a reverent, almost awestruck, expression. They offered her their blankets. They competed to share their food with her.
<name>Norma</name>	Norma	Mariam	The front of his pants was wet. She saw his forehead. Then she saw the shovel. A groan came out of her. “Oh,” she said, tremulously, barely able to make a voice, “Oh, [MASK].”
<name>Jonas</name>	Jonas	Afsoon	Her eyes traced the sleek shape of the table’s legs, the sinuous curves of its corners, the gleam of its reflective, dark brown surface. She noticed that every time she breathed out, the surface fogged, and she disappeared from her father’s table. [MASK] escorted her back to the room upstairs.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Mariam	His eyes were closed. He wasn’t humming. [MASK] reclined her head and closed her eyes too. She wanted out of her cold socks, out of the damp wool sweater that was prickly against her skin. She wanted away from this bus.
<name>she</name>	she	Laila	“So what is today?” he said now, smiling coyly. “Day five? Or is it six?” “What do I care? I don’t keep count,” [MASK] lied, shrugging, loving him for remembering.
<name>Tonya</name>	Tonya	Jalil	The three of them were sitting outside the kolba, in a patch of shade thrown by the willows, on folding chairs arranged in a triangle. “For my birthday ... I know what I want.” “You do?” said [MASK], smiling encouragingly.
<name>she</name>	she	Mariam	“So how long will you stay here?” “I don’t know.” “My mother says you’re not really my sister like you say you are.” “I never said I was,” [MASK] lied. “She says you did.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Laila	“It’s nice,” he said. [MASK] hoped she wasn’t blushing. ‘You changed the subject.” “From what?” “The empty-headed girls who think you’re sexy.” ‘You know.” “Know what?”
<name>She</name>	She	Mariam	A long sigh. “Maybe someone there—” “There’s a groundskeeper here. I think he’s lived here all of his life.” “Yes, ask him, please.” “Call back tomorrow.” [MASK] said she couldn’t.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Mariam	Now, if you don’t mind, I’m trying to listen.” He turned up the volume again, leaned his head back and closed his eyes. One sunny morning that week, [MASK] picked a spot in the yard and dug a hole.
<name>doctor</name>	doctor	Mariam	“You can buy the medicine yourself, but—” “Write the name,” [MASK] said. “You write it down and I’ll get it.” Beneath the burqa, the doctor shook her head curtly. ‘There is no time,” she said.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Khodaya	Because the girl’s face twisted, and she was on all fours then saying she was going to be sick. “Wait! Hold on. I’ll get a pan. Not on the floor. I just cleaned . . . Oh. Oh. [MASK].
<name>Ma Joad</name>	Ma Joad	Rasheed	“[MASK]! Can you bring the bottle? It’s sitting on the almari. She won’t feed. I want to try the bottle again.” The baby’s screeching rose and fell like a cleaver on meat.
<name>Yasir</name>	Yasir	Salim	He befriended an older man in prison, he said, a fellow named [MASK], a Pakistani, a former field hockey player who had been in and out of prison for years and who was serving ten years for stabbing an undercover policeman.
<name>Offred</name>	Offred	Mariam	“I don’t want this. Don’t make me.” She hated the sniffling, pleading tone of her voice but could not help it. “Now, be reasonable, [MASK],” one of the wives said.
<name>the referee</name>	the referee	Zaman	Above them, over the mountains, the morning sun is rising. It catches the metallic rim of the basketball hoop, the chain link of the tire swings, the whistle hanging around [MASK]’s neck, his new, unchipped spectacles.
<name>Harper</name>	Harper	Mariam	A puff of his smoky breath hit [MASK]’s face. “I won’t take that personally. This time.” Again, he took her by the elbow, and led her upstairs. There was a narrow, dimly lit hallway there and two bedrooms.
<name>Marmee</name>	Marmee	Laila	There is a flurry of high-pitched greetings, of shrill voices, of patting, clutching, tugging, groping, of jostling with one another to climb into her arms. There are outstretched litde hands and appeals for attention. Some of them call her Mother. [MASK] does not correct them.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	hamshira	“You’ll have to forgive me, [MASK]," he said, adjusting his loose collar and dabbing at his brow with a handkerchief. “I still haven’t quite recovered, I fear. Five more days of these, what are they called . . .
<name>someone</name>	someone	Tariq	She sensed that [MASK] was observing her—one eye on the kiss, the other on her—as she was observing him. Was he listening to the air whooshing in and out of her nose, she wondered, waiting for a subtle faltering, a revealing irregularity, that would betray her thoughts?
<name>he</name>	he	Mariam	I want it! I want it!” his voice rising and becoming more shrill with each word. “It was just here,” [MASK] said, and he cried, “No, it’s lost, I know it. I just know it’s lost!
<name>Lena</name>	Lena	Laila	and I’ll go. I’ll never trouble you again. I’ll—” “No!” [MASK] said more sharply than she’d intended to. She saw that she’d reached for his arm, that she was clutching it. She dropped her hand.
<name>Zainab</name>	Zainab	Rasheed	“Useless,” he said, snatching the phone from her. “Like daughter, like father.” On their way out of the lobby, [MASK] walked briskly to the coffee table, which was now abandoned, and pocketed the last ring of jelabi.
<name>Amir</name>	Amir	Rasheed	For what came next, [MASK] put down the ball of rice he’d made back on the plate. His hands dangled idly over his meal, as he looked down with a sober, thoughtful expression. “One mustn’t speak ill of the dead much less the shaheed.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Mariam	He blinks again. Then he puts a palm to his cheek and his face lights up with a smile that reveals missing and rotting teeth. “Oh!” he says. It comes out sounding like Ohhhhhh, like an expelled breath. “Oh! [MASK]!
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Noor	They smiled at each other when they heard her voice for the first time, a cry that started like the mewl of a cat and exploded into a healthy, full-throated yowl. [MASK] said her eyes were like gemstones.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Laila	[MASK] spotted an unnatural, almost rehearsed, quality to the way she said “Well” and to this folding of hands. She feared a speech was coming. “It was one thing when you were little kids running around. No harm in that.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Laila	It’s olive green, with fading gilt scrolls all around the hinged lid. There is a litde rust on the sides, and two tiny dents on the front rim of the lid. [MASK] tries to open the box, but the latch is locked.
<name>He</name>	He	Jalil	Most striking, he was thinner, much thinner, than she remembered, the coat of his dark brown suit drooping over his shoulders, the trousers pooling at his ankles. [MASK] had seen her too, if only for a moment.
<name>He</name>	He	Rasheed	“Unless it was done unintentionally on a Friday,” he said. “And did you know it’s supposed to be a bad omen to tie shoes together and hang them from a nail?” [MASK] himself believed none of this.
<name>her twin</name>	her twin	Tariq	It was selfish and irrational, but she was furious with him for abandoning her, [MASK], who was like an extension of her, whose shadow sprung beside hers in every memory. How could he leave her? She slapped him.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Laila	[MASK] whimpered. When the doctor was done, she gave the glove to a nurse, who rinsed it and pinned it back on the string. “Your daughter needs a caesarian. Do you know what that is?
<name>Natasha</name>	Natasha	Laila	[MASK]’s eyes snap open. She gasps, and her body pitches forward. She stardes the bat, which zips from one end of the kolba to the other, its beating wings like the fluttering pages of a book, before it flies out the window.
<name>Moira</name>	Moira	Laila	The sands sang on. Screaming now. A sound like ... a tinkling? Not a tinkling. No. A whistling. [MASK] dropped the books at her feet. She looked up to the sky. Shielded her eyes with one hand. Then a giant roar.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Laila	The orphanage playground has a row of apple saplings now along the east-facing wall. [MASK] is planning to plant some on the south wall as well as soon as it is rebuilt. There is a new swing set, new monkey bars, and a jungle gym.
<name>Mr. Bell</name>	Mr. Bell	Rasheed	“There now, girl. There. There,” he said. He was squinting out the window as he said this, as though something more interesting had caught his eye. 9 It was early evening the following day by the time they arrived at [MASK]’s house.
<name>Ali</name>	Ali	Tariq	It was after the sofrah was cleared and the plates were stacked in the kitchen, when the frenzy of tea making and remembering who took green and who black started, that [MASK] motioned with his head and slipped out the door.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Mariam	On her way to the kitchen, [MASK] nearly tripped over something. There was a shape at her feet. When her eyes adjusted, she made out the girl and her baby lying on the floor on top of a quilt. The girl was sleeping on her side, snoring.
<name>him</name>	him	Rasheed	She waited anxiously for [MASK] to finish talking, to crush his cigarette, and take his leave. Only when she’d heard him cross the hallway, heard his door open and close, only then would the metal fist gripping her belly let go.
<name>Amir</name>	Amir	Mariam	She grew up in a kolba made of mud outside the village. Her father put her there. Have you told her, [MASK], have you told her that you are a harami? Well, she is. But she is not without qualities, all things considered.
<name>Hermione</name>	Hermione	Laila	Three days before, [MASK] had gone outside for a breath of air. She’d stood by the front gates, leaning against them, when she’d heard a loud crack and something had zipped by her right ear, sending tiny splinters of wood flying before her eyes.
<name>Abdullah</name>	Abdullah	Mariam	“I’m on to you both. I won’t be made an ahmaq, a fool, in my own house.” He threw [MASK] one last, murderous stare, and gave the girl a shove in the back on the way out.
<name>her</name>	her	Mariam	She had feared that she might scream or vomit or even wet herself, that, in her last moments, she would be betrayed by animal instinct or bodily disgrace. But when she was made to descend from the truck, [MASK]’s legs did not buckle.
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Mariam	In the end, [MASK] knew that there would be no beating, not that night. He’d made his point. He stayed that way a few moments longer, arm raised, chest heaving, a fine sheen of sweat filming his brow.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Mariam	Everything she said used to please him, intrigue him, make him look up from his plate and nod with approval. The strange thing was, the girl’s fall from grace ought to have pleased [MASK], brought her a sense of vindication. But it didn’t.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Tariq	“Anyway, this isn’t about me or the bra. It’s about you and [MASK]. He’s a boy, you see, and, as such, what does he care about reputation? But you?
<name>Alina</name>	Alina	Aziza	“I’m making a point,” he said. “You’re just like them.” “It’s an interesting eye color she has, [MASK]. Don’t you think? It’s neither yours nor mine.”
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Mariam	But it didn’t. It didn’t. To her own surprise, [MASK] found herself pitying the girl. It was also over dinner that the girl let loose a steady stream of worries. Topping the list was pneumonia, which was suspected with every minor cough.
<name>The neighbor</name>	The neighbor	Laila	They mostly stick to the woods, the wolves do, but a bleating goat, one that likes to go wandering, that can draw them out. So the fence. The stake.” [MASK] asked him which foothills.
<name>him</name>	him	Tariq	And wouldn’t have felt even now but for one fundamental fact: She had fallen for [MASK]. Hopelessly and desperately. When he was near, she couldn’t help but be consumed with the most scandalous thoughts, of his lean, bare body entangled with hers.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Tariq	They left him with a clumsy left hand and a slight slur to his speech. When he was agitated, which happened frequently, the slurring got worse. [MASK] outgrew his leg again and was issued a new leg by the Red Cross, though he had to wait six months for it.
<name>Grandfather</name>	Grandfather	Babi	“It’s what I always remember about being up here,” [MASK] said. “The silence. The peace of it. I wanted you to experience it. But I also wanted you to see your country’s heritage, children, to learn of its rich past.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Tariq	“Good days. Bad ones too. The same.” ‘Yes,” [MASK]’s mother said thoughtfully, lowering her spoon into the bowl. “How hard it must be, how terribly hard, for a mother to be away from her sons.”
<name>Mrs. Jones</name>	Mrs. Jones	Mammy	“What a first-rate teacher he was,” [MASK] said. “His students loved him. And not only because he wouldn’t beat them with rulers, like other teachers did. They respected him, you see, because he respected them.
<name>Ali</name>	Ali	Ahmad	He had deep-set, brooding eyes, and his face was more thoughtful, more solemn, than his younger brother’s, a face as suggestive of early maturity as his brother’s was of lingering boyishness. Around [MASK]’s neck was a glittering allah pendant.
<name>Mr. Okada</name>	Mr. Okada	Rasheed	She would retreat back to her room, sit on the bed, and watch the snow falling. [MASK] took her to his shoe shop one day. When they were out together, he walked alongside her, one hand gripping her by the elbow.
<name>he</name>	he	Tariq	So now she asked him how they were doing, his parents. But she regretted the question when [MASK] looked down and said, a bit distractedly, “Passed on.” “I’m so sorry.” “Well. Yes. Me too. Here.”
<name>the sickly Talib</name>	the sickly Talib	Mariam	“It’s the truth.” “Do you have witnesses? Other than your ambagh?” “I do not,” said [MASK]. “Well, then.” He threw up his hands and snickered. It was the sickly Talib who spoke next.
<name>Darry</name>	Darry	Babi	“I miss the boys too, you know,” [MASK] said. His eyes had welled up a tad. His chin was trembling. “I may not... With your mother, both her joy and sadness are extreme. She can’t hide either.
<name>Isaac</name>	Isaac	Nana	Almost two days you made me lay on that cold, hard floor. I didn’t eat or sleep, all I did was push and pray that you would come out.” “I’m sorry, [MASK].” “I cut the cord between us myself.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Mariam	The face was there for only an instant, a flash, but long enough. Long enough for [MASK] to see the eyes widen, the mouth open. Then it snapped away from view. A hand appeared and frantically pulled at a cord. The curtains fell shut.
<name>he</name>	he	Mariam	The girl’s voice, underneath his, was tentative and shrill. Soon the baby was wailing. Then [MASK] heard their door open violently. In the morning, she would find the doorknob’s circular impression in the hallway wall.
<name>He</name>	He	Rasheed	[MASK] did not wave her over, did not introduce her. He asked her to wait outside an embroidery shop. “I know the owner,” he said. “I’ll just go in for a minute, say my salaam."
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Laila	Though he could hardly afford it on his salary, he’d hired a driver for the day. He wouldn’t disclose anything to [MASK] about their destination except to say that, with it, he was contributing to her education. They had been on the road since five in the morning.
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Laila	You’ll see.” On the third morning, [MASK] began moving the piles of things to the yard and depositing them by the front door. They would fetch a taxi then and take it all to a pawnshop.
<name>Lysandra</name>	Lysandra	Laila	[MASK] told her of his aptitude for solving riddles, his trickery and mischief, his easy laugh. “He had the prettiest lashes, thick like yours. A good chin, a fine nose, and a round forehead.
<name>Mrs. Havisham</name>	Mrs. Havisham	Nana	She sat quietly on a chair across from him, hands folded on her lap. She did not look at him directly and never used coarse language around him. When she laughed, she covered her mouth with a fist to hide the bad tooth. [MASK] asked about his businesses.
<name>Auntie</name>	Auntie	Mariam	It ought to have felt exhilarating, but the girl’s eyes had teared up and her face was drooping, and what satisfaction [MASK] found from this outburst felt meager, somehow illicit. She extended the shirts toward the girl. “Put them in the almari, not the closet.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Rasheed	And when the bus pulled away, she did not look back to see him receding, to see him disappear in the cloud of exhaust and dust. [MASK], who took up the window and middle seat, put his thick hand on hers. “There now, girl.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Mariam	But she did not look up to see whether they were shaking with disapproval or charity, with reproach or pity. [MASK] blinded herself to them all. Earlier that morning, she had been afraid that she would make a fool of herself, that she would turn into a pleading, weeping spectacle.
<name>He</name>	He	Tariq	“I knew already. Of course I knew,” [MASK] said. “He said that if I got caught, I was on my own, that I should remember that he knew where my mother lived. But the money was too good to pass up.
<name>John</name>	John	Rasheed	She dragged herself to the door, slapped her palms against it. ‘Just one glass, [MASK]. Not for me. Do it for her. You don’t want her blood on your hands.” He walked past. She began to plead with him.
<name>Cholera</name>	Cholera	TB	Do you have any idea what those camps are like?” He gazed at her from behind a column of smoke. “People living under scraps of cardboard. [MASK], dysentery, famine, crime. And that’s before winter. Then it’s frostbite season.
<name>They</name>	They	Babi	But in your free time, ifyou wanted to, you could help out, take orders, fill water pitchers, that sort of thing.” [MASK] said they would hold birthday parties at the restaurant, engagement ceremonies, New Year’s get-togethers.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Laila	He tested the doors, then went around the back of the shed and fetched a ladder. A few minutes later, his face was in [MASK]’s window, nails tucked in the corner of his mouth. His hair was disheveled. There was a swath of blood on his brow.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Laila	This was [MASK]’s first time out of the house in weeks, discounting the short trip to the pawnshop the day before—where she had pushed her wedding ring across a glass counter, where she’d walked out thrilled by the finality of it, knowing there was no going back.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Mariam	“Most of them were ash. The rest were looted, I’m afraid.” He helped [MASK] watch over the girl that first week. One day, he came home from work with a new blanket and pillow. Another day, a bottle of pills.
<name>Kurtz</name>	Kurtz	hamshira	They’d operated three dmes already. Took out sections of intesdnes, I don’t remember what else. And he was burned. Quite badly. That’s all I’ll say about that. I’m sure you have your fair share of nightmares, [MASK].
<name>her</name>	her	Tariq	The disbelief at their own boldness, their courage. The strange and indescribable pleasure, interlaced with the pain. And the look, the myriad of looks, on [MASK]: of apprehension, tenderness, apology, embarrassment, but mostly, mostly, of hunger.
<name>Stanley</name>	Stanley	Zalmai	In grocery stores, he carefully pocketed canned ravioli, which they split five ways, [MASK] getting the lion’s share. They ate raw turnips sprinkled with salt. Limp leaves of lettuce and blackened bananas for dinner. Death from starvation suddenly became a distinct possibility.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Khadim	[MASK] was the first to see him. His grin faded, and he pushed himself off the wall. He unhooked his thumbs from the belt loops and made himself more upright, taking on a self-conscious air of menace. The others followed his gaze.
<name>see</name>	see	Mariam	When the money ran out, hunger began to cast a pall over their lives. It was stunning to [MASK] how quickly alleviating hunger became the crux of their existence. Rice, boiled plain and white, with no meat or sauce, was a rare treat now.
<name>she</name>	she	Mariam	She turned it so the sharp edge was vertical, and, as she did, it occurred to her that this was the first time that she was deciding the course of her own life. And, with that, [MASK] brought down the shovel.
<name>the window</name>	the window	Mariam	Through it [MASK] could see that it, like the rest of the house, was sparsely furnished: bed in the corner, with a brown blanket and a pillow, a closet, a dresser. The walls were bare except for a small mirror.
<name>She</name>	She	Laila	Until his hand was around her throat. Until she was lifted off her feet and slammed against the wall. Up close, his sneering face seemed impossibly large. [MASK] noticed how much puffier it was getting with age, how many more broken vessels charted tiny paths on his nose.
<name>John</name>	John	Tashakor	It’s good. You can have it if you’re hungry. I don’t mind.” “No. [MASK], brother.” He nodded, looked at her benignly. “Are you afraid, mother?” A lump closed off her throat.
<name>Bob Marley</name>	Bob Marley	Mecca	They sit on the floor in a sparsely furnished room. There is a Herad rug on the floor, beaded cushions to sit on, and a framed photo of [MASK] on the wall. They sit by the open window, on either side of an oblong patch of sunlight.
