<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Max	“Obviously.” Their eyes met again, over the old man’s head. There was a silence, in which the cat suddenly purred. “ ‘Things to discuss’ ” [MASK] quoted it softly, but with a new note in his voice that I found frightening.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Adoni	No, hush, they’ll hear you. . . .” “We’ve got to get him now. We’ve got to make sure of him.” “We will, I promise you we will. I know all about it now, [MASK].
<name>who</name>	who	Godfrey	“Did it happen as recently as that? Could you tell, [MASK]?” “I’m not an expert. I don’t know. I don’t think he’s been there long. However, it shouldn’t be hard to find out when he was last seen.”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Spiro	Meanwhile I must make do with what crumbs I had. “Nothing had changed.” We could presumably expect him on the late ferry, but if nothing had changed it didn’t sound as if a police escort was likely, so he might not bring [MASK] back with him, either.
<name>Rainsford</name>	Rainsford	Godfrey	“Another? Rather too common, these accidents, wouldn’t you say? How did it happen?” “Are you a yachtsman?” “No.” “Then don’t ask stupid questions.” [MASK] gave him a brief, cold look.
<name>Caliban</name>	Caliban	Max	“Very much. And when all four play at the same time, it really is something.” “The leitmotiv for your Tempest, [MASK],” said his father, stroking the white cat. “ ‘The isle is full of noises.’ ”
<name>God</name>	God	Heaven	“She’d say anything. She’s got some bee in her bonnet over her brother, and she’d invent any tale to see me in trouble. [MASK] knows why, or where the boy’s got this incredible idea of his from.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Adoni	There was just the faintest lift of curiosity in her voice. I noticed then how bright her eyes were, and that the flush was back in her cheeks, and for a moment I wondered if [MASK] had given her some hint of the truth.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Godfrey	They had apparently got to the cave and the packages, which were, according to [MASK], radio sets. He was explaining, wearily yet civilly, how the “sets” had been packed and stored. I put a cautious hand in through the broken pane, and began to ease the window catch open.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Godfrey	[MASK] hadn’t spoken or moved. He was leaning on the desk now as if for support. He was very pale, and the bruised side of his face stood out blacker as the blood ebbed from the rest.
<name>Dr. John Watson</name>	Dr. John Watson	Max	The terrace was empty, but one of the long windows stood open, and [MASK] led the way in through this. The room was lit only by one small shaded lamp on a low table, and looked enormous and mysterious, a cave full of shadows.
<name>Jamie</name>	Jamie	Godfrey	“Two in a week?” I said. It came out as a query, asked quite as if [MASK] could supply the answer. I hadn’t meant even to say it aloud, and could have bitten my tongue with vexation as soon as it was out.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Max	A small, fluting voice said, “Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo,” and clicked back into silence. “That damned clock!” said [MASK] explosively, then began to laugh. “It always frightens me out of my wits.
<name>the man</name>	the man	Godfrey	I tiptoed back to the window. It was just possible that the man had found the package, and if so, I might as well wait a little longer and hear what [MASK]’s defence would be before I went in to blow it apart.
<name>The Godfather</name>	The Godfather	Adoni	You won’t know this, but over here it’s a relationship that’s taken very seriously. The godfather really does take responsibility—he has as much say in the kids’ future as their father does, sometimes more.” “I gathered that from [MASK].
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Adoni	The names were all there, hidden deep in the rampant leaves, where some predecessor of [MASK]’s had lovingly attached them a century ago. The white cat, posing in front of an elegant background of dark fern, watched benevolently as I hunted for them, my hands filling with plundered roses.
<name>Godfrey</name>	Godfrey	Godfrey	We got drenched in the process.” “You mean to tell me”—Godfrey sounded frankly incredulous—“that you brought your boat out at this time of night to rescue a dolphin?” “Wasn’t it good of him?” I put in eagerly. “Very,” said [MASK].
<name>me</name>	me	Spiro	I felt the jerk of the gun against my waist and smelled the acrid tang of singeing cloth. He may have been aiming at [MASK], but the light still reeled as if in an earthquake, and off balance as I was, I spoiled his aim.
<name>Fitzgerald</name>	Fitzgerald	Leo	“Peasants?” Mildly intrigued, I gave her the lead I thought she wanted. “It does seem a bit odd to find those names here. Who was this well-read father of theirs, then? [MASK]?”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Godfrey	“What’s this?” [MASK]’s voice altered sharply. “My coat.” I paid very little attention to his tone; I was shivering freely now, and engaged in the very unpleasant struggle to get my sandals on over wet and sandy feet.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Godfrey	I was wondering if the neck was broken, but I don’t think so.” [MASK]’s eye met mine. I stood up. “Well, when the boat’s found, there may be something there to show how it happened.”
<name>Tempest</name>	Tempest	Miranda	I told you, we found the proof today!” “Proof that The Tempest is true?” It was my turn to stare blankly. Somehow, after the mounting excitement of [MASK]’s narrative, this came as a climax of the most stunning irrelevance.
<name>Wolfe</name>	Wolfe	Yanni	You aren’t beginning to think there was more in [MASK]’s death than met the eye?” “Oh, no. Let’s just say it’s curiosity, and a little natural human resentment at having things taken out of my hands.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Maria	Stay to lunch if you like. [MASK]’s done the vegetables, thank goodness—how I hate potatoes in the raw!—and the rest’s cold. Won’t you stay?” “I’d like to, but I want to get back to the telephone.
<name>Aleister</name>	Aleister	Godfrey	There wasn’t—I knew this—much hope of their finding the Aleister in the darkness, but at least I might have a card or two I could play if [MASK] found me. Under the circumstances, he could hardly expect to get away with my disappearance as well.
<name>Queen Victoria</name>	Queen Victoria	Pete	And for [MASK]’s sake, are you going to bathe with that Koh-i-noor thing on?” “Heavens, no!” She slipped the enormous marquise diamond off her finger, dropped it into the plastic bag that held her cosmetics, and zipped the bag shut.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Max	I followed more slowly, hampered by my icily clinging clothes, my sandals leaving horrible wet marks on the treads. He paused to wait for me, eying me curiously. “What happened to you and [MASK]?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Miranda	At length I put the receiver back. “That’s that. He’s out, so it’s all right.” I looked at her. “Will you, [MASK]? Please? Just show me where the cave is, and you can come straight back.”
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Max	“That’s the stuff,” said [MASK] cheerfully. “Now, you go to sleep, and very soon I’ll get you away.” He stooped, and dropped a hand for a moment on the boy’s shoulder.
<name>Will</name>	Will	Godfrey	As he turned, I drew back into the shade of the trees, and just in time, for he! glanced up briefly before he vaulted up to the path and out of sight. “Tired?” asked [MASK], just behind me. I started.
<name>Rainsford</name>	Rainsford	Max	Oh, [MASK] . . .” “Steady, my dear, I’ll come. Hold him, we’ll float him first. Say when.” “Nearly . . . Right! Stop!” The engine shut off, as suddenly as if a soundproof door had slammed.
<name>Nice</name>	Nice	Corfu	Someone tried to sell me a sponge the size of a football, and someone else to convince me that I must need a string of onions and a red plush donkey, but I managed to stay unburdened, and presently found my way to the Esplanade, which is [MASK]’s main square.
<name>Poirot</name>	Poirot	Max	“Murder! Oh, no, here it is.” The great marquise flashed blue in the starlight.“Oh, [MASK], seriously, thank you most awfully—you were so wonderful . . . I’ve been such a fool!
<name>God</name>	God	Max	I hardly noticed. I was watching the dark, starry sea where, far out, a trail of sea fire burned and burst in long, joyous leaps and curves, and vanished into the blackness. . . . “Oh, [MASK] . . .
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Lucy	Much the same general shape, wouldn’t you say?” “You’ll be all right. He doesn’t wear yellow.” “Seriously, there isn’t anyone watching, is there, [MASK]? I’d just as soon not have an audience.”
<name>Mr. Jaggers</name>	Mr. Jaggers	Godfrey	He looked as if he’d be capable of anything, and anyway, he was quite foully rude, and it wasn’t a bit necessary!” “You were trespassing,” said [MASK] dryly. “Even so, it couldn’t have been him!” said my sister positively.
<name>Wolfe</name>	Wolfe	Godfrey	I stood up. “Well, when the boat’s found, there may be something there to show how it happened.” “For all we know,” said [MASK], “that’s been done and the hue and cry’s on already.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Godfrey	That it was [MASK]’s car there could be no manner of doubt: he switched on her lights, and they swept round in a wide curve, lancing through the trees and out into space, to move on and vanish in the blackness over the headland as the engine’s note receded through the woods.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Leo	But—from its shallow shape and my memory of [MASK]’s boat—I imagined that this was only because it held the liquor; there was none elsewhere, and it was hardly big enough to store the packages I was looking for.
<name>Ice</name>	Ice	Godfrey	[MASK], at any rate, remained unmelted, so I abandoned the attempt and made do with a quivering little smile, and a hand, genuinely none too steady, brushing my eyes. “I’m sorry,” I said, “I truly am.
<name>Simon</name>	Simon	Godfrey	The torch beam started its swing towards him. I said sharply, “Please put the torch out, [MASK]! I don’t feel decent in this sopping dress. Give me the coat, please. Yes, it’s blood . . .
<name>her</name>	her	Adoni—“even	“You’re sure, naturally.” The boy nodded. “And it didn’t need a genius with engines to know there was nothing wrong. Even you”—a glint at [MASK] you would have known, my pretty one.”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Godfrey	But that wouldn’t work either. Whatever [MASK] was or wasn’t, he didn’t kiss like a rather nice boy. . . . I opened my eyes and watched, over his shoulder, the lovely heavy lamp swinging about a foot away from his head.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Pellekas	I said aloud, “I’ll hold you to that one day, and I’ll eat the crayfish! I can’t feel strongly about fish. I’m afraid! Where are we going then, [MASK]?”
<name>Godfrey</name>	Godfrey	Adoni	I suppose you took it?” “Yes. And the police took it from us.” “Well, here we go.” I took a shaky little breath. “Oh, [MASK] . . .” “You are afraid?” “Afraid?”
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Phyllida	Something in her expression roused my curiosity, just as something else told me she had meant to; so I—who can be every bit as provoking as [MASK] when I try—said merely, “Well, in that case hadn’t you better have a change?
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Phyllida	“Well, dearie, knowing you,” said [MASK], “when I woke up and found you’d vanished, I knew you’d be straying along here, poking around in the rock pools, and heaven knew how far you’d get.”
<name>God</name>	God	Spiro	“Evil, be thou my good. . . .” And the instinct that had allowed him to create those pictures wasn’t even incongruous: no doubt it had given him much the same pleasure to destroy [MASK] as it had to photograph him.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Godfrey	[MASK] leaned back in his chair, regarding him coolly. You’d have thought there was nobody else in the room. “With your man down there searching my boat it’s not much use pretending I have been taking photographs, is it?
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Godfrey	[MASK] staggered, recovered as his shoulder met the window frame, and with an obscene little grunt in my ear, fired down at the boy. I felt the jerk of the gun against my waist and smelled the acrid tang of singeing cloth.
<name>me</name>	me	Spiro	“He knows where she is! He has killed her! Do not listen to him! He has killed her! I know she went to the boat! He took her and killed her, as he tried to kill [MASK], my brother!”
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Phyl	If he’d looked there first . . .” He lifted his shoulders, letting the sentence hang. “Well,” said [MASK], with an attempt at briskness, “I honestly don’t see why you should reproach yourself at all.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Adoni	I should have been quite safe.” He paused, and stirred in the bed, as if the leg were hurting him. [MASK] slipped to the floor and padded across to where a bottle stood on a box beside two empty glasses.
<name>Hercule</name>	Hercule	Leo	How exciting.” “Only, shrimps and things kept coming in, which was discouraging, and once a baby squid.” “It must have been.” “So [MASK] stopped it. It was supposed to be terribly healthgiving, but there are limits.”
<name>Mrs. Hudson</name>	Mrs. Hudson	Heaven	There was a whole world of relief in the long- drawn syllable. Then his voice changed; it was brisk, easy, normal. “I mustn’t keep you any more. [MASK] knows what the time is, and you must get home with that treasure trove of yours.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Adoni	Well, when you see [MASK], will you thank him for bringing these things? And for the message. That was all, that all was well?” “Yes.” “That’s fine,” I said heartily. “I did wonder.
<name>Aunt Lily</name>	Aunt Lily	Phyl	“What? What on earth’s that?” “An ancient Baedeker I found on [MASK]’s shelves. It was my grandfather's—date 1909. It’s really rather sweet. Listen to the bit at the beginning about the history of the island.
<name>he</name>	he	Spiro	Let’s just say it’s curiosity, and a little natural human resentment at having things taken out of my hands. The man was drowned on my doorstep—as [MASK] was from my boat—and I think I should have been kept in the picture.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Max	amended [MASK] quickly. The older man hesitated. “The thing was, I had to ask him in. When he came in for petrol and saw me there, you might say he had to offer the lift, but all the same, one has to be civil.
<name>the stranger</name>	the stranger	Godfrey	He paused as if a vague sense of something wrong was filtering through the fog of alcohol. His eyes came uncertainly back to [MASK], peering through the shaft of light thrown by the window. “There’s the telephone. Someone’s ringing up.” He frowned.
<name>James</name>	James	Lolita	Another dazzling smile, and the door shut gently. I was alone with [MASK]. You had to climb three steps to the bath, which was about the size of a swimming pool, and fairly bristling with gadgets in blackened brass.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Adoni	You told me earlier that [MASK] had said these books were 'proof.’ Did he say proof of what?” She knitted her brows. “What could he have meant, but proof of the story?” “I see,” I said.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Adoni	Perhaps—” I stopped her with a touch, my lips at her ear. “That won’t be [MASK]. We mustn't be found here, we’ve got to hide. Quickly. . . I took her arm, pulling her deeper into the cave.
<name>Uncle Axel</name>	Uncle Axel	Max	He looked pale, and—in the pyjamas—young and unprotected-looking. [MASK] pulled a box forward for me to sit on. “How do you feel?” he asked the boy. “Is it hurting?”
<name>Manuel</name>	Manuel	Max	The dolphin had got a cut from a stone, or something; it bled all over me before I saw it. I’ll be lucky if I ever get the stain out.” “Hurry up,” said [MASK] brusquely, “you’re shivering.
<name>Byron</name>	Byron	Adoni	And his worry in case his father might have “talked” hadn’t just been worry; it had been fear. As for [MASK]—I had few illusions as to what my young Byzantine saint would be capable of. . . .
<name>darling</name>	darling	Corfu	He’s away, staying the night at a friend’s house.” “How far away?” “If it’s anything to do with you, [MASK].” “You must think I’ve a scream like a steam whistle,” I said dryly.
<name>John</name>	John	Max	Or cheese, perhaps?” “Oh, no, thank you. That was wonderful.” “Some more coffee, then?” “Is there some?” “Of course.” [MASK] poured it, and pushed the sugar nearer. “Cigarette?”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Adoni	Certainly he would not share her beliefs, and she would have accepted an explanation from him, whereas from me, now . . . [MASK]. The name stabbed through the haze in my mind like a spearpoint going through butter muslin.
<name>Mac</name>	Mac	Gale	He said suddenly, “Didn’t you see him go back to the body after we’d left it?” “What? See who?” “[MASK], of course.” “Oh, yes . . . sorry, I was looking at the view.
<name>unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Godfrey	Something had happened that had changed the whole pitch of the scene; in place of the slightly pleasurable bitchiness of the previous exchange, there was now something urgent, hard, and yes, threatening. And it was [MASK]’s name that had done it.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Godfrey	“Okay,” said my sister amiably, and went to silence the telephone. I had no intention of going down to the beach, as it happened, it being more than likely that [MASK] would see me there and come down.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Godfrey	Then froze, staring with horror at the foot of the berth. Even in the almost-darkness I could see it, and [MASK], in the matchlight, must have seen it quite clearly—my toe, clad in a light yellow canvas shoe, protruding from the huddle of blankets.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Max	[MASK] wants to go out this afternoon. Perhaps I shall see you there soon?” “Thank you, but I— No, I doubt if you will.” “That would be a pity. While you are here, you should see the orange orchards; they are something quite special.
<name>Enrique</name>	Enrique	Phyl	“[MASK] told me.” “I was lucky to have him. He was a clever mechanic, and that’s something not so easy to find in these parts. In most of the villages the only ‘machines’ are donkeys and mules, and there’s no work for a mechanically minded boy.
<name>Miss Fairfax</name>	Miss Fairfax	Max	Ah, thank you, [MASK]; and here are your roses, too. That’s my own copy; it’s a bit ancient, and I’m afraid it’s been scribbled in, but perhaps you can ignore that.” I had already seen the pencilled notes.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Spiro	There is no dowry, but that’s no matter, [MASK] was my friend, and one has obligations. He had saved to provide for her, but now that he is dead her mother must keep it; I can’t take it.”
<name>the Greek</name>	the Greek	Miranda	I did not know, then, that the Greek takes the most intensely personal questions serenely for granted, just as he asks them himself, and I had begun to stammer something, but [MASK] was already answering: “Many years ago my father left us.
<name>Rainsford</name>	Rainsford	Godfrey	Nobody’s going to know if a dozen rifles or so go missing!” “Now isn’t that nice?” said [MASK]. “Look,” I said forcibly, “one minute more of this, and I shall scream. What’s all the mystery?
<name>her</name>	her	Leo	She just knew what you told [MASK], that he’d been ill, and in a nursing home. Does it happen often?” “If you’d asked me that yesterday,” he said, a little bitterly, “I’d have said it probably wouldn’t happen again.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Lucy	It’s something he’d have no reason to invent. He's as stunned by it as you are.” He added, more gently, “I’m sorry, [MASK], but I’m afraid it’s true.”
<name>Dr. Sartorius</name>	Dr. Sartorius	Max	His hands lay motionless now on the cat’s fur, and there, again, you could see the controls being switched on. The same with [MASK], who had himself well in hand now, but I could hear the effort that the patient tone was costing him.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Spiro	“I see. And your own wrist—was that the coastguards?” “Yes, a stray bullet, and a spent one at that. It’s honestly only a graze; I’ll get it looked at when I get [MASK]’s leg seen to.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Max	I shout—not loudly, you understand, because I am full of water and too cold, gasping for air. But he must have heard me.” He shot a look up at [MASK], all of a sudden vivid, alive with pure hatred.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Godfrey	I licked my lips. “Even so ... You wouldn’t suggest that that there could be any connection—that he was killed because of this? Is that what you’re getting at? That—that would make it murder, [MASK].” “No, no.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Miranda	“Keep very still. I heard something. Listen.” Through the drip of water on limestone it came again: the sound of a careful footstep somewhere in the passage above. Here he came. Dear God, here he came. [MASK] stirred.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Adoni	“Did you get the message from [MASK]?” “Yes. Just that all was well, so I assumed you’d got away safely. I hope it still is?” “So far, a bit discouraging, but I’m still hoping.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Phyl	“An hour ago—three quarters, perhaps. He wasn’t in, so I thought you might be out with him. Are you?” “No. Listen, [MASK], will you do something for me?” “What? What is all this?”
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Max	“Good heavens! But surely, with children of his own—” “He managed.” [MASK]’s voice was suddenly grave. “We’re not rich, heaven knows . . . and an actor’s life’s a darned uncertain one at best . . .
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Hullo	“[MASK], there. I hope you don’t mind a stowaway?” The wick caught, and the light spread. I got the globe fitted back at the third try, but perhaps he hadn’t noticed my shaking hands. He had moved to draw the curtains.
<name>Lorelai</name>	Lorelai	Phyllida	“If that was all I thought would happen,” said [MASK], with a spice of her usual self, “I’d probably enjoy it. But it’s his mother.” “I know. And the aunts. And the Cardinal.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Godfrey	I glanced up at [MASK]. “When I was down in the bay, there was somebody up in the woods above, with a rifle, taking potshots. If I hadn’t been there and shooed the dolphin away, he’d probably have got it.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Adoni	“Serve him right. What’s more, I’m certain that the meeting at the garage was an accident. If [MASK] and I had been suspected, we’d have been watched, and perhaps followed ... or intercepted on our way home.”
<name>Rainsford</name>	Rainsford	Pm	[MASK] afraid my reactions were a bit rough. I’m sorry for that. But if someone suddenly breaks out of the dark and runs straight into you, you—well, you act according.” “According to what? Jungle law?” I was still smarting.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Max	“Not badly at all. I think it’s only a graze, for all it bled a lot. Don’t worry, [MASK] is sensible, he’ll take all the care he should.” “And you?” I said. He looked surprised.
<name>Mr. Brown</name>	Mr. Brown	Maria	I thought as much. . . . Oh, yes, I knew all about it, [MASK] told me. Believe me, they were terribly grateful for the work you gave him, and for the way you paid, always so generous.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Godfrey	I never thought. . . the idea wasn’t even raised . . . but if I’d thought, with the children coming here for their holidays and everything—” “Look,” said [MASK] briskly, “you’re making altogether too much of this, you know.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Shirley	“Do you call her a woman?” “Well... I suppose you’re right.” “I’m right in telling you not to blame yourself over [MASK]. What comes next?” I hesitated. “Like that, is it?” he said.
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Miranda	I caught [MASK]’s name again, and something about a dowry, and difficulties now that the brother was dead; but I wasn’t really listening. I was still caught up unhappily in the news I had just heard. We do not take easily to the displacing of our idols.
<name>Meggie</name>	Meggie	Phyllida	The player switched itself off. In the silence that followed I heard sounds from [MASK]’s room. She was up and busy. I glanced at the clock. Twenty past twelve. She should have been asleep long ago. I went across the hallway to her door.
