<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Razia	She looked around now to see if the door was closed. The girls were in their bedroom attending to homework, and she did not want them to hear [MASK] poking fun at their father. “A serious thing, though, the business with the machine work.
<name>Yevgeny</name>	Yevgeny	Nazneen	And I have engaged in literary debate. All these are fine things, but everything in its proper place. I shall, let’s say, pay a home visit.” A petition? What petition is this? [MASK] had not seen any petition.
<name>God</name>	God	Allah	July Sister the money you sent have arrive thanks be to [MASK]. Do not be angry I took to the hospital and pay for Monjufor clean dressings on the body. It hurt the nose to smell her. It hurt the eye to see her.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Chanu	After a week or so, she said, “Is he sick or something?” Finally, she said, “It’s going to happen, isn’t it? He’s going to kidnap us.” [MASK] sat on the floor reading a newspaper.
<name>Yvonne</name>	Yvonne	Chanu	They poked around a bit and then cleared off. “Got yourself a problem there, sweetheart. Shouldn’t’a left it so long.” The suitcase stood on its little smart wheels at the bottom of the wardrobe, on top of [MASK]’s certificates.
<name>James</name>	James	Karim	She elicited no response. For a while, as she watched [MASK], she lost track of his words and witnessed only the tension in his body as he traced and retraced a path across the stage. It was supposed to be her.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Chanu	He sat up straight, as if his entire body wa: two glasses of water. “Next time,” said [MASK], “you must bring “Of course,” said the doctor. “She is well? I hope she is very well.
<name>Estha</name>	Estha	Lovely	These secret things will kill us. Do you have any secret? You want to tell to me? I keep it safe for you! I think she try for smiling. Next day I go for telling her newspaper man come make photograph with [MASK].
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Nazneen	She stood by his shoulder and demanded his attention silently. After a few minutes he spoke again without turning his head. “You know, it could be like a mela.” “Oh, but do you think so?” said [MASK].
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Chanu	“Doctor’s orders,” he said, waving an arm. ‘You stay there and follow the orders. I will fetch and carry.” He bustled out of the room, forgetting the dirty plates. The girls came in as [MASK] left.
<name>Rukmani</name>	Rukmani	Razia	“What did she say? How did she look?” ‘We must send some money. Will you send to her?” The first wage that [MASK] paid was not much. All month they ate rice and dal, rice and dal.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Raqib	There was a time when it disgusted her, this flaking and scraping, but now it was nothing. Time was all it took. She looked up and saw the photograph of [MASK] on the bedside table. The glass needed dusting.
<name>Satan</name>	Satan	Satan	She would pray later. “Glory and praise be to You, O God; blessed is Your name and exalted is Your majesty. There is no God other than You. I come, seeking shelter from [MASK], the rejected one. ”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Razia	She never knew what she would say then, but the phrase kept coming to her. With narrowed eyes and her sideways look, [MASK] attempted to tease it from her. The most astonishing thing of all . They did not speak of him. It was not possible.
<name>Shamita</name>	Shamita	Nazneen	[MASK] cleared the sofa and the visitor lay down. She tugged her sari at the hip, applied the Ralgex, and moaned. She sprayed her stomach, inserted the tin into the sleeve of her cardigan, and sprayed again. Then she sprayed a handkerchief and placed it over her face.
<name>Antoinette</name>	Antoinette	Nazneen	Better escape from this madwoman while there is still a chance. Having descended from her high wire, [MASK] spent the next few days stamping along on the ground, and the ground—to her surprise— appeared to be solid.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Chanu	She was sitting at the table, not working or tidying, but just sitting. “Well,” said [MASK], “I will do it myself” “No. I don’t believe this survey. What kind of professors are these?”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Chanu	Or he read, watched television, and talked. Only his eyes were unhappy. What are we doing here, they said, what are we doing on this round, jolly face? It was when he talked about promotion that [MASK] grew serious.
<name>Anila</name>	Anila	Mumtaz	Yet her husband still wanted to sleep with her and make more mouths, more empty bellies. What should she do? How could she deny her husband? And how could she magic more food from her cooking pot? [MASK] gripped the fish guts and pulled.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Shahana	“As you are all aware.” He noticed [MASK]’s dress. She had hitched up her uniform at school so that it bloused over the belt and rode up towards her thigh. Without changing her expression she began to inch it slowly downwards.
<name>Allah</name>	Allah	Allah	Who is he? Abruptly the singing stopped. The assistants vanished and the fakir threw his arms wide and bellowed. “O evil jinni, leave that woman’s body! By the command of [MASK], leave her. Sky! Water! Air! Fire!”
<name>Belinda</name>	Belinda	Nishi	[MASK], strong on forward-planning skills, was taking evasive action: she was going on a holiday of her own and she would return when she was twenty-five. At that ancient age the danger of marriage was over.
<name>Trinket</name>	Trinket	Nazneen	The whiskered man with the flat, blank eyes of a bandicoot rat, who came alone and slept beneath the chairs, slowly licked his lips. [MASK] ate and ate. She scraped the tins clean and put them on the floor.
<name>James</name>	James	Chanu	It was the usual. ‘ how many signatures have you succeeded in from the new dawn of a mobile library?” [MASK] leaned his wrists on the edge of tin the tip of one finger after another, all on the right. “Only seven this week.”
<name>Shafiq</name>	Shafiq	Ruku	“I don’t need very much. Just enough for the Dhaka house and some left over for [MASK]’s education. I don’t want him to rot here with all the skinheads and drunks. I don’t want him to grow up in this racist society.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Abba	The bird learned another bad word. It called out to everyone that passed and it had a new laugh, a chuckle at the back of its throat, and when [MASK] laughed as well they sounded like brothers. A table had been brought out into the big yard.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Karim	She heard it often enough from [MASK] that she came to understand it and know that it was simply another word for “right.” She observed him more openly now, and when he saw her looking at him she did not look away immediately.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jorina	“Well, [MASK]’s boy is in trouble. I heard that he drinks alcohol every day, even for breakfast. He can’t get out of bed unless he has a drink first, and then he’s good for nothing.”
<name>Messages</name>	Messages	Jeans	He spoke lightly, as if they were just fooling around. “Places to go, people to see.” “No,” she said. “Don’t.” “Things to do. [MASK] to deliver.” But he didn’t get up.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Chanu	The baby opened his eyes and looked ready to make some urgent inquiries into the situation. But he was kidnapped suddenly by sleep and seemed to make a willing hostage. A smile twitched his cheeks. “What is it?” said [MASK]. “He’s sick.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Razia	[MASK] opened her purse and looked inside, holding it practically at eye level. Then she began removing pieces of paper, receipts, photographs, tickets, and coins. When the purse was empty she conceded, “There’s only two pounds here.”
<name>Rincewind</name>	Rincewind	Raqib	[MASK] was awake. “Bah,” he said. Enough of this nonsense. He lifted his hands in front of his face and regarded them sternly. He made pincers, tested them for strength and flexibility and was satisfied. They were released.
<name>Amma</name>	Amma	Amma	She sat cross-legged on a choki and [MASK] sat behind her and plaited her hair. Hands that smelled of garlic and ginger tugged at her hair and lifted her scalp till it pinched. “When you were born, I put you to my breast and you did not feed.”
<name>Shoba</name>	Shoba	Nazneen	It was us. All the Dutch and Portuguese and French and British queuing up to buy.” He got up now and retied his lungi. [MASK] watched him stride around the sofa and knew he was rehearsing for this evening’s lesson with the girls.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Chanu	[MASK] ignored her and played to the gallery. “No. This is not what they teach. All flood here and famine there and taking up collection tins.” He used the book to scratch inside his ear.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Nazneen	A shopkeeper came out on the pavement and emptied a bucket of foul-smelling water into the gutter. [MASK] turned her head. Through an open door, down a flight of concrete stairs, she glimpsed a row of sewing machines beneath a low yellow ceiling.
<name>Aladdin</name>	Aladdin	Mumtaz	[MASK] covered the bottle with cheesecloth and smashed it with a hammer, crying, “O jinni, I give you freedom and you will give me wisdom.” At first it had seemed that the jinni had not kept its end of the bargain.
<name>Asma</name>	Asma	Chanu	It is not us who like to degrade women by showing their body parts in public places. ‘We always kept quiet,” said [MASK]. “The young ones don’t want to keep quiet anymore.” The return of fire took a few days.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Chanu	They won’t take long. They’ll give him back to us soon.” [MASK] blinked. His eyes seemed more beleaguered than ever. “Will you wash him? I don’t think I can wash him.” “I always give him his bath.”
<name>Monsoon</name>	Monsoon	Hemanto	[MASK] brought jasmine, lotus, water lilies and hyacinth, krishnachura, kadam, and magnolia, and everywhere the smell of drying rice stalks. That year one of the cows gave birth to three calves and it was taken as an auspicious sign and many marriages were hurried through even before their proper season.
<name>Meera</name>	Meera	Chanu	Even then it was good. This rice was superb. Just the rice would be enough for her. But fresh coriander made her swoon for the chicken. The deeply oily aubergine beckoned lasciviously. She wanted to stick her tongue in the velvety dal. [MASK] could cook.
<name>Nazneen</name>	Nazneen	Nazneen	“I’ve got so much work to do.” On her way back [MASK] recognized four Bangla lads who had turned up halfway through the meeting. They had driven a car, silver, flashy-looking, into the courtyard. The doors were open and the music hammered out.
<name>Amma</name>	Amma	Mumtaz	Four weeks later, just as suddenly, she went. She was never mentioned again. “Your mother was wearing her best sari,” said [MASK]. “It’s strange. It wasn’t a special day after all.”
<name>Olga</name>	Olga	Razia	Everything else may be altered, but not that.” [MASK] leaned back on the sofa. She made the sofa look small, and she knocked one of the plastic headrests to the floor. “What can we say against fate?”
<name>Arjie</name>	Arjie	Nazneen	He played the table like a tabla. His head swayed to the tune so that [MASK] had to stop cutting. When he opened his eyes he shook himself like a wet dog. “So,” he said. “Well. Let’s get on.”
<name>Yura</name>	Yura	Nazneen	What are you wobbling around there for? Sit down. Or go and make some tea.” “Let me massage him,” said [MASK]. “I can do it.” ‘You don’t do it hard enough. Look! He likes it.
<name>He</name>	He	Nazneen	A shadow passed over his face. Wasn’t it obvious enough long ago that she had left? [MASK] bit into her tongue. “No,” he said softly. “She is still there. In a manner of speaking.”
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Chanu	She looked at [MASK]. The doctor gripped his seat. His feet and knees pressed together. His helmet hair held a circle of light. He would never let go of that chair. It was the only thing holding him up. The girl tucked the money into her blouse pocket.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Nazneen	Tears gathered in the corners of her eyes and escaped down the bridge of her nose. “Come on. Tell me. Take my mind off—other things.” So [MASK] began the conversation she had already rehearsed by herself, and still she played both parts.
<name>Nazneen</name>	Nazneen	Razia	[MASK] looked at the price tag. She shook her head and sighed as if the evils of the world had been revealed to her. “Look how much these English are paying for their kameez. And at the same time they are looking down on me.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Nazneen	Her plaits hung around her face; rope ladders to the roof of her head. [MASK] pulled laundry from the wooden clothes rack and began a campaign of vigorous folding and sorting. Activity, ordinary and domestic and cheerful, was needed. The clothes were still damp.
<name>Nasreen</name>	Nasreen	Nazneen	“We paid what we owed,” said [MASK]. Her voice clogged up her ears. “We paid at least three hundred pounds on top of that. I am not going to pay any more ...” She hesitated. “Any more riba.”
<name>David</name>	David	Nazneen	Out of the dark, a woman with a microphone ran up to him. He lowered the megaphone. A white man shouldered a camera and swung it in his direction. The woman spoke to the Questioner and the Questioner replied, but [MASK] could no longer hear him.
<name>Melinda</name>	Melinda	Nazneen	He knew a great deal about it. “See those kids down there?” He stood at the window but [MASK] would not go and stand with him. She did not want to stand in view with him. “Those kids, they’re all users.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Hasina	It was because of [MASK]. It was because of the Home Fund, which was not growing quickly enough. It was because of the girls, who did not want to go home. She sat up now and looked at the clock.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Nazneen	[MASK] decided on nine o’clock as the time to tell him. It would give them an hour to talk things over, to say goodbye. “Sometimes things don’t turn out so badly. Sometimes the bad things that you think are coming don’t come at all.
<name>Lara</name>	Lara	Shahana	He pushed his back against the massager and circled his ankles. “How is school? Still top of the class? Clever girl, eh?” [MASK] turned her head a little. “It’s OK,” she said in English.
<name>Men</name>	Men	Mankind	For once she felt calm. None of her Lord’s blessings would she deny. She began to read again. [MASK] and jinn, We shall surely find the time to judge you! Which of your Lord’s blessings would you deny?
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Chanu	“I can’t stay,” said [MASK], and they clung to each other inside a sadness that went beyond words and tears, beyond that place, those causes and consequences, and became a part of their breath, their marrow, to travel with them from now to wherever they went.
<name>Rosa</name>	Rosa	Jorina	The children ask for things. Everything they see, they want. And I don’t have money. [MASK] can get me a sewing job, but my husband will come to the factory and slaughter me like a lamb.” “Talk to him.”
<name>She</name>	She	Nazneen	They stay on their feet as they watch it a second, a third time. The image is at once mesmerizing and impenetrable; the more it plays, the more obscure it becomes until [MASK] feels she must shake herself out of a trance.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Chanu	“How did they do that?” [MASK] expelled whatever it was that was sticking in his windpipe. He coughed as well, to be on the safe side, and then he began. “You see, it was largely a matter of tariffs.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Nazneen	“Here,” he said to [MASK], and held out the dish. “Do you want this?” “It was bad enough when it was alcohol,” said the doctor. “Now I wish it was only alcohol. We need two things.
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Shahana	“I did not know. And what is ‘chromosome’?” [MASK] was offended. “Well, it’s something to do with biology. But aren’t you interested that we have less than the chickens?”
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Razia	“You hear all sorts of things about the sons,” [MASK] said. “But for all I know, those things are just rumor.” The boy rolled his head on the pimpled stalk of his neck and settled back.
<name>Abdul</name>	Abdul	Chanu	[MASK] chuckled and slapped his stomach. ‘You think your mother has an easy job? How many times do I tell you to help your mother? It’s not easy. Not easy at all.” He ate slices of bread spread with ghur and saw no necessity for a plate.
<name>Ayoola</name>	Ayoola	Hasina	[MASK], also. Because she was grateful for her safety, for the letter safely delivered. The baby she could not forget because he was scrambling around her belly, looking for footholds just beneath her ribs. She could not get her forehead down to the mat.
<name>Aslam</name>	Aslam	Jorina	[MASK] said that police had been to the mosque and questioned the imam for two hours. No one had any idea why, although many predicted trouble and everyone doubted that a church had ever been treated with such flagrant disrespect.
<name>Who</name>	Who	Wflio	Who wrote it? [MASK] authorized it? "Who distributed it?” He made a show of looking around the hall, being careful not to look at the Questioner. “I shall ask the secretary. Is this a Bengal Tigers leaflet?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Karim	What kept her tied to the corner of the room? “The children are not going.” “All right,” [MASK] said again. We can talk again after the march. I’ve got ten thousand things to do.” “I know.
<name>she</name>	she	Chanu	After a while, when [MASK] began an answer and she laughed again, he stopped and looked at her with his head to one side. “Are you feeling well? Too much sun, perhaps?” She flushed, and she laughed again.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Raqib	And she squeezed [MASK] from her mind. That way lay the abyss. So she swallowed hard and prayed hard, and she used prayer, in defiance of her vows, to dull her senses and dull her pain.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Chanu	[MASK] had been to work this morning. The first time in over a week. Here he was. Scuttling along, turning at a right angle to pass a trolley and moving sideways like a big, soft-shelled crab. He came up next to her and leaned on the radiator.
<name>Albert</name>	Albert	Chanu	Thin dark arms, a cluster of pimples over the right elbow. Shoulders that are slender, correctly held, almost graceful. Above, a round, plump face. On another man, such a face would look content. [MASK] was thinking. His mouth twitched.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Chanu	She wanted to get up from the table and walk out of the door and never see him again. “He might be a patient. I do not know him.” It was nearly a whisper. “No,” said [MASK]. “I see.”
<name>He</name>	He	Nazneen	“And what’s he ringing up for anyway? Hasn’t got anything to say to me, man.” “He is worrying. Perhaps.” “Yeah, man. Worrying and nerves. Out of his mind with worrying and nerves.” [MASK] sat.
<name>Obi</name>	Obi	Abba	[MASK] finished and another man began to speak, another joined in and another until soon they all struggled to be heard. A scream from the women’s quarters scattered their words like a handful of seed; they fell and were lost and if anything grew from them it would be later.
<name>Clare</name>	Clare	Nazneen	“Ish,” said [MASK], narrowing her eyes at the thought. She rubbed her stomach and pressed on it firmly to feel around the curve of the baby’s head, or his bottom. She put her feet up on a footstool.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Karim	He covered his mouth for yet another yawn. “Hope you don’t mind.” “Why should I mind?” [MASK] shrugged. He looked at his fingernails. ‘When I was a young man like you, do you know what I wanted to be?
<name>Marina</name>	Marina	Shahana	Of course, [MASK] was a bundle of nerves and she is very highly strung and it’s not surprising that she decided, as it were, to show her heels, but look where it got her and where we are going. ...”
<name>Amma</name>	Amma	Abba	Do you remember [MASK] take us one time in boat to watch jute harvest? Mens stay down so long we cannot hold breaths until they come again to surface. These ones tell biggest story. One say I have dive twelve feet down to cut the jute.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Nazneen	It whizzed through the air and exploded with a dull thud. From behind the black municipal bins, out of doorways, around corners, and up from car bonnets, more and more people appeared, ejected by this simple purgative. [MASK] ran past the car.
<name>us</name>	us	Islam	He paused and looked over the whole audience, taking his time, making everyone feel his power to do this, to make them wait. “When we march, we’ll show them how wrong they are about [MASK]. They’ll see we are strong.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Amma	How quick she go again. If only [MASK] know how quick she go. That is way with men. Why she did not know it? March 1995 Do not be angry I have not kept word but I writing now and you must forgive.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Nazneen	Every few seconds he caught one around his neck and his assistant passed him another. “But I am not going,” said [MASK]. It occurred to her that she could have done this before. What kept her tied to the corner of the room?
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Nazneen	On her face was written grandeur and weariness, and the knowledge that whatever happened she would be the one called to preside over it. The receptionist, who had a cigarette tucked behind her ear, called [MASK]’s name.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Chanu	It was ten past five and all she had done was chop two onions. She had not heard about the accident. [MASK] had mentioned nothing. She wanted to know who this woman was who had died so terribly. She formed some questions in her mind, phrased and rephrased them.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Raqib	[MASK]! What’s happened? Why does he not wake? Why doesn’t he wake?” Chapter Six The city shattered. Everything was in pieces. She knew it straightaway, glimpsed it fjom the painful-white insides of the ambulance. Frantic neon signs.
<name>She</name>	She	Razia	“You are the only friend I have.” [MASK] looked at her. “You don’t have to tell me. Just because I am in trouble, you don’t have to make trouble for yourself as well.” They walked together in silence.
<name>Adichie</name>	Adichie	Jimmy	The opposition party give gun and money and student have not one second for looking at book. Is big problem for business. All boils down is instability. Then he talk- ing this and that about business [MASK] making rice ball and sticking to underneath table.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Amma	I hope I can be a good wife, like [MASK].” But as she turned to go she noticed, without meaning to, where her father put the photograph. She just happened to see it. These things happen.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Nazneen	Am I a moneylender? A usurer? Is this how I am repaid for helping a friend in need?” “No?” said [MASK]. She thought she might be shouting, but she really could not help it. “Not interest? Not a usurer?
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Shahana	He was offered a job washing dishes in a restaurant. He went back to bed, but he was in some way galvanized. Some vestige of fight was reignited within him and he began setting tasks for his daughters. “[MASK],” he would call.
<name>Rajesh</name>	Rajesh	James	He shares all his thought with me. Thats why I know he is so worried about money and share price and election. Many husbands dont tell wife anything at all. It so sweet of [MASK] really. ”
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	Bibi	It was not her birthday. “Early birthday present.” “It is what I wanted.” They never celebrated their own birthdays, only the girls’. “Let’s try it,” said [MASK].
<name>Case</name>	Case	Nazneen	[MASK] imagined cramming the money inside that black hole. “So you are going back.” The geriatric voice had vanished. Overhead, a vacuum cleaner was switched on. The bed next door had stopped moving against the wall. “I don’t know.”
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Tariq	Just let me out. Come on, Ma, let me out.” It was not of her making. It was not of her making. “One five-pound wrap,” screamed [MASK]. “That’s all I need. You bitch.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sister	“[MASK], did you just jump off the boat? Let’s see. Some people say that she is self-conscious about her nose. You know she has a wart. They say she began by using the hankies to cover it up whenever she thought someone was staring.
<name>Jennifer</name>	Jennifer	Nazneen	Yes, he definitely inferred that a malpractice had taken place. That is not on. It simply isn’t on.” [MASK] handed him pajamas. She slung his trousers on a hanger, without folding them properly, and put them in the wardrobe.
<name>Amara</name>	Amara	Nazneen	She was tired. Even her shoulders were too heavy for her today. “In love, ” she said. “It is the English style.” [MASK] lost a sandal and slid off the stool to retrieve it. She felt her friend looking at her
