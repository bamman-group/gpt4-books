<name>Syme</name>	Syme	Syme	He smiled, sympathetically he hoped not trusting himself to speak. [MASK] bit off another fragment of the dark-colored bread chewed it briefly, and went on: “Don’t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought?
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	VIII From somewhere at the bottom of a passage the smell of roasting coffee—real coffee, not Victory Coffee—came floating out into the street. [MASK] paused involuntarily. For perhaps two seconds he was back in the half-forgotten world of his childhood.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	It was early, and the place was not very full. The queue edged forward till [MASK] was almost at the counter, then was held up for two minutes because someone in front was complaining that he had not received his tablet of saccharine.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	“Except—” began [MASK] doubtfully, and then stopped. It had been on the tip of his tongue to say “Except the proles,” but he checked himself, not feeling fully certain that this remark was not in some way unorthodox.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	[MASK] lay silent. His breast rose and fell a little faster. He still had not asked the question that had come into his mind the first. He had got to ask it, and yet it was as though his tongue would not utter it.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	In his childish way [MASK] grasped that some terrible thing, something that was beyond forgiveness and could never be remedied, had just happened. It also seemed to him that he knew what it was. Someone whom the old man loved, a little granddaughter perhaps, had been killed.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	All three had written long, abject articles in the Times, analyzing the reasons for their defection and promising to make amends. Some time after their release [MASK] had actually seen all three of them in the Chestnut Tree Cafe.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Winston	You can stop being a servant for the next ten minutes.” The little man sat down, quite at his ease, and yet still with a servantlike air, the air of a valet enjoying a privilege. [MASK] regarded him out of the comer of his eye.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	“And do you consider yourself a man?” “Yes.” “If you are a man, [MASK], you are the last man. Your kind is extinct; we are the inheritors. Do you understand that you are alone?
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	A morning came, and he was missing from work; a few thoughtless people commented on his absence. On the next day nobody mentioned him. On the third day [MASK] went into the vestibule of the Records Department to look at the notice board.
<name>Raffles</name>	Raffles	Winston	“That is not only my own opinion. I was talking recently to a friend of yours who is certainly an expert. His name has slipped my memory for the moment.” Again [MASK]’s heart stirred painfully.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	Or even ten years? A chap like me could make himself pretty useful in a labor camp. They wouldn’t shoot me for going off the rails just once?” “Are you guilty?” said [MASK]. “Of course I’m guilty!”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	Today’s issue contained a statement of the actual output, from which it appeared that the forecasts were in every instance grossly wrong. [MASK]’s job was to rectify the original figures by making them agree with the later ones.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	The little man was sprawling on all fours, his tray had gone flying, two streams of soup and coffee were flowing across the floor. He started to his feet with a malignant glance at [MASK], whom he evidently suspected of having tripped him up.
<name>O'Brien</name>	O'Brien	O’Brien	The grip on his limbs tightened again, but the pain had ebbed away and the trembling had stopped, leaving him merely weak and cold. [MASK] motioned with his head to the man in the white coat, who had stood immobile throughout the proceedings.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	You will be hollow. We shall squeeze you empty, and then we shall fill you with ourselves.” He paused and signed to the man in the white coat. [MASK] was aware of some heavy piece of apparatus being pushed into place behind his head.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	“You are a flaw in the pattern, [MASK]. You are a stain that must be wiped out. Did I not tell you just now that we are different from the persecutors of the past? We are not content with negative obedience, nor even with the most abject submission.
<name>O'Brien</name>	O'Brien	O’Brien	All her rebelliousness, her deceit, her folly, her dirty-mindedness—everything has been burned out of her. It was a perfect conversion, a textbook case.” “You tortured her.” [MASK] left this unanswered. “Next question,” he said.
<name>Syme</name>	Syme	Syme	“It was a good hanging,” said [MASK] reminiscently. “I think it spoils it when they tie their feet together. I like to see them kicking. And above all, at the end, the tongue sticking right out, and blue—a quite bright blue.
<name>Katharine</name>	Katharine	O’Brien	He tried to think of [MASK], for whom, or to whom, the diary was written, but instead he began thinking of the thing that would happen to him after the Thought Police took him away. It would not matter if they killed you at once.
<name>Victoria</name>	Victoria	Katharine	[MASK] was a tall, fair-haired girl, very straight, with splendid movements. She had a bold, aquiline face, a face that one might have called noble until one discovered that there was as nearly as possible nothing behind it.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	[MASK] was alone, and had been alone for hours. The pain of sitting on the narrow bench was such that often he got up and walked about, unreproved by the telescreen. The piece of bread still lay where the chinless man had dropped it.
<name>Ostrog</name>	Ostrog	Winston	“It isn’t very important about the top hats,” said [MASK] patiently. “The point is, these capitalists—they and a few lawyers and priests and so forth who lived on them—were the lords of the earth. Everything existed for their benefit.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	It was the alert, cold face of a man of about five-and-thirty. It occurred to [MASK] that for the first time in his life he was looking, with knowledge, at a member of the Thought Police. THR€€ He did not know where he was.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	The thing that impressed [MASK] in looking back was that the speaker had switched from one line to the other actually in mid-sentence, not only without a pause, but without even breaking the syntax. But at the moment he had other things to preoccupy him.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	O’Brien	“If you ever want to see me, this is where I can be found,” was what [MASK] had been saying to him. Perhaps there would even be a message concealed somewhere in the dictionary. But at any rate, one thing was certain.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	And of course—” She had a habit of breaking off her sentences in the middle. The kitchen sink was full nearly to the brim with filthy greenish water which smelt worse than ever of cabbage. [MASK] knelt down and examined the angle-joint of the pipe.
<name>Parsons</name>	Parsons	Parsons	“Of course I’m guilty!” cried [MASK] with a servile glance at the telescreen. “You don’t think the Party would arrest an innocent man, do you?” His froglike face grew calmer, and even took on a slightly sanctimonious expression.
<name>Asiatic</name>	Asiatic	Mongol	Nor did one know what became of them, apart from the few who were hanged as war criminals; the others simply vanished, presumably into forced-labor camps. The round [MASK] faces had given way to faces of a more European type, dirty, bearded, and exhausted.
<name>Katharine</name>	Katharine	Katharine	And so far as the women were concerned, the Party’s efforts were largely successful. He thought again of [MASK]. It must be nine, ten—nearly eleven years since they had parted. It was curious how seldom he thought of her.
<name>Goldstein</name>	Goldstein	Goldstein	When public trials were happening she had taken her place in the detachments from the Youth League who surrounded the courts from morning to night, chanting at intervals “Death to the traitors!” During the Two Minutes Hate she always excelled all others in shouting insults at [MASK].
<name>Chichikov</name>	Chichikov	Newspeak	He had brightened up immediately at the mention of [MASK]. He pushed his pannikin aside, took up his hunk of bread in one delicate hand and his cheese in the other, and leaned across the table so as to be able to speak without shouting.
<name>O'Brien</name>	O'Brien	O’Brien	Until he had said it, he did not know which word he was going to say. “No,” he said finally. “You did well to tell me,” said [MASK]. “It is necessary for us to know everything.”
<name>Syme</name>	Syme	Tillotson	Once again he glanced at his rival in the opposite cubicle. Something seemed to tell him with certainty that [MASK] was busy on the same job as himself. There was no way of knowing whose version would finally be adopted, but he felt a profound conviction that it would be his own.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	“There is no difference between night and day in this place. I do not see how one can calculate the time.” They talked desultorily for some minutes, then, without apparent reason, a yell from the telescreen bade them be silent. [MASK] sat quietly, his hands crossed.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	Lower, please! That’s better, comrade. Now stand at ease, the whole squad, and watch me.” A sudden hot sweat had broken out all over [MASK]’s body. His face remained completely inscrutable. Never show dismay! Never show resentment!
<name>Hardy</name>	Hardy	O’Brien	[MASK]’s manner became less severe. He resettled his spectacles thoughtfully, and took a pace or two up and down. When he spoke his voice was gentle and patient. He had the air of a doctor, a teacher, even a priest, anxious to explain and persuade rather than to punish.
<name>O'Brien</name>	O'Brien	O’Brien	You are lying. You still think there are four. How many fingers, please?” “Four! Five! Four! Anything you like. Only stop it, stop the pain!” Abruptly he was sitting up with [MASK]’s arm round his shoulders.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Winston	The little girl took hold of it and looked at it dully, perhaps not knowing what it was. [MASK] stood watching her for a moment. Then with a sudden swift spring he had snatched the piece of chocolate out of his sister’s hand and was fleeing for the door.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	It was a steel engraving of an oval building with rectangular windows, and a small tower in front. There was a railing running round the building, and at the rear end there was what appeared to be a statue. [MASK] gazed at it for some moments.
<name>Syme</name>	Syme	Syme	It had been on the tip of his tongue to say “Except the proles,” but he checked himself, not feeling fully certain that this remark was not in some way unorthodox. [MASK], however, had divined what he was about to say.
<name>O'Brien</name>	O'Brien	O’Brien	But what use was it to say so? His mind shriveled as he thought of the unanswerable, mad arguments with which [MASK] would demolish him. “I think I exist,” he said wearily. “I am conscious of my own identity.
<name>O'Brien</name>	O'Brien	O’Brien	And yet, in the sense in which he intended the word, he had not betrayed her. He had not stopped loving her; his feeling toward her had remained the same. [MASK] had seen what he meant without the need for explanation.
<name>Pierre</name>	Pierre	Julia	“It is necessary for us to know everything.” He turned himself toward [MASK] and added in a voice with somewhat more expression in it: “Do you understand that even if he survives, it may be as a different person?
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	Bang over’ead! Lay down quick!” “Steamer” was a nickname which, for some reason, the proles applied to rocket bombs. [MASK] promptly flung himself on his face. The proles were nearly always right when they gave you a warning of this kind.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	[MASK] was just taking his place in one of the middle rows when two people whom he knew by sight, but had never spoken to, came unexpectedly into the room. One of them was a girl whom he often passed in the corridors.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	“Not one!” said [MASK] with a sort of guilty haste. “I’ve tried all over the place. They don’t exist any longer.” Everyone kept asking you for razor blades. Actually he had two unused ones which he was hoarding up.
<name>He</name>	He	Winston	It was just names of churches. All the London churches were in it—all the principal ones, that is.” [MASK] wondered vaguely to what century the church belonged. It was always difficult to determine the age of a London building.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	Someone had picked up the glass paperweight from the table and smashed it to pieces on the hearthstone. The fragment of coral, a tiny crinkle of pink like a sugar rosebud from a cake, rolled across the mat. How small, thought [MASK], how small it always was!
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Parsons	[MASK] went on triumphantly: “My kid made sure he was some kind of enemy agent— might have been dropped by parachute, for instance. But here’s the point, old boy. What do you think put her onto him in the first place?
<name>Connell</name>	Connell	Julia	“We’re not dead yet,” said [MASK] prosaically. “Not physically. Six months, a year—five years, conceivably. I am afraid of death. You are young, so presumably you’re more afraid of it than I am.
<name>trout</name>	trout	dace	Somewhere near at hand, though out of sight, there was a clear, slow-moving stream where [MASK] were swimming in the pools under the willow trees. The girl with dark hair was coming toward him across the field.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	X	He fell asleep murmuring “Sanity is not statistical,” with the feeling that this remark contained in it a profound wisdom. [MASK] When he woke it was with the sensation of having slept for a long time, but a glance at the old-fashioned clock told him that it was only twenty-thirty.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	How easy it was, thought [MASK], if you did not look about you, to believe that the physical type set up by the Party as an ideal—tall muscular youths and deep-bosomed maidens, blond-haired, vital, sunburnt, carefree— existed and even predominated.
<name>Ylla</name>	Ylla	O’Brien	Some of them are a million light-years away. They are out of our reach forever.” “What are the stars?” said [MASK] indifferently. “They are bits of fire a few kilometers away. We could reach them if we wanted to.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Winston	[MASK] watched it with a sort of vague reverence. For whom, for what, was that bird singing? No mate, no rival was watching it. What made it sit at the edge of the lonely wood and pour its music into nothingness?
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	All the confessions that are uttered here are true. We make them true. And, above all, we do not allow the dead to rise up against us. You must stop imagining that posterity will vindicate you, [MASK]. Posterity will never hear of you.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	With a sort of faded enthusiasm he would finger this scrap of rubbish or that—a china bottle-stopper, the painted lid of a broken snuffbox, a pinchbeck locket containing a strand of some long-dead baby’s hair—never asking that [MASK] should buy it, merely that he should admire it.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	Just think what they have to put up with. Now try again. That’s better, comrade, that’s much better,” she added encouragingly as [MASK], with a violent lunge, succeeded in touching his toes with knees unbent, for the first time in several years.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Julia	It was thinkable that the razor blade might arrive concealed in his food, if he were ever fed. More dimly he thought of [MASK]. Somewhere or other she was suffering, perhaps far worse than he. She might be screaming with pain at this moment.
<name>Syme</name>	Syme	Syme	The voice from the other table quacked rapidly on, easily audible in spite of the surrounding din. “There is a word in Newspeak,” said [MASK]. “I don’t know whether you know it: duckspeak, to quack like a duck.
<name>O'Brien</name>	O'Brien	O’Brien	He heard himself promising to lie, to steal, to forge, to murder, to encourage drug taking and prostitution, to disseminate venereal diseases, to throw vitriol in a child’s face. [MASK] made a small impatient gesture, as though to say that the demonstration was hardly worth making.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Syme	Quite likely the person at the next table was a spy of the Thought Police, and quite likely he would be in the cellars of the Ministry of Love within three days, but a cigarette end must not be wasted. [MASK] had folded up his strip of paper and stowed it away in his pocket.
<name>Parsons</name>	Parsons	Parsons	He had hoped to be alone for a little while during the lunch hour, but as bad luck would have it the imbecile [MASK] flopped down beside him, the tang of his sweat almost defeating the tinny smell of stew, and kept up a stream of talk about the preparations for Hate Week.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	People were shooting into the doorways like rabbits. A young woman leapt out of a doorway a little ahead of [MASK], grabbed up a tiny child playing in a puddle, whipped her apron around it, and leapt back again, all in one movement.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	He could still remember the smell of the damp cardboard. It was a miserable outfit. The board was cracked and the tiny wooden dice were so ill-cut that they would hardly lie on their sides. [MASK] looked at the thing sulkily and without interest.
<name>O'Brien</name>	O'Brien	O’Brien	[MASK] had wrenched the loose tooth out by the roots. He tossed it across the cell. “You are rotting away,” he said; “you are falling to pieces. What are you? A bag of filth. Now turn round and look into that mirror again.
<name>O'Brien</name>	O'Brien	O’Brien	In this place, he knew instinctively, the lights would never be turned out. It was the place with no darkness: he saw now why [MASK] had seemed to recognize the allusion. In the Ministry of Love there were no windows.
<name>Lenina</name>	Lenina	Julia	It was the hottest, sleepiest hour of the afternoon. The sun blazed down upon them, the sweat tickled his face. And the thought struck him.... “Why didn’t you give her a good shove?” said [MASK]. “I would have.”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	Someone was climbing through the window. There was a stampede of boots up the stairs. The room was full of solid men in black uniforms, with iron-shod boots on their feet and truncheons in their hands. [MASK] was not trembling any longer.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	Do you know what I’m going to say to them when I go up before the tribunal? ‘Thank you,’ I’m going to say, ‘thank you for saving me before it was too late.’ ” “Who denounced you?” said [MASK].
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Julia	He told [MASK] the story of his mother’s disappearance. Without opening her eyes she rolled over and settled herself into a more comfortable position. “I expect you were a beastly little swine in those days,” she said indistinctly. “All children are swine.”
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Winston	II [MASK] picked his way up the lane through dappled light and shade, stepping out into pools of gold wherever the boughs parted. Under the trees to the left of them the ground was misty with bluebells. The air seemed to kiss one’s skin.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Julia	When he suggested it to [MASK] she had agreed with unexpected readiness. Both of them knew that it was lunacy. It was as though they were intentionally stepping nearer to their graves. As he sat waiting on the edge of the bed he thought again of the cellars of the Ministry of Love.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	The largest section of the Records Department, far larger than the one in which [MASK] worked, consisted simply of persons whose duty it was to track down and collect all copies of books, newspapers, and other documents which had been superseded and were due for destruction.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	Already our control over matter is absolute.” For a moment [MASK] ignored the dial. He made a violent effort to raise himself into a sitting position, and merely succeeded in wrenching his body painfully. “But how can you control matter?” he burst out.
<name>O'Brien</name>	O'Brien	O’Brien	Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood. [MASK] had tortured him to the edge of lunacy, and in a little while, it was certain, he would send him to his death. It made no difference.
<name>O'Brien</name>	O'Brien	O’Brien	“As you lie there,” said [MASK], “you have often wondered—you have even asked me—why the Ministry of Love should expend so much time and trouble on you. And when you were free you were puzzled by what was essentially the same question.
<name>O'Brien</name>	O'Brien	O’Brien	He could evade its pangs if he was quick-witted enough; it was chiefly when he showed stupidity that [MASK] pulled the lever. Sometimes they got through a whole session without use of the dial. He could not remember how many sessions there had been.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	By sitting in the alcove, and keeping well back, [MASK] was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen, so far as sight went. He could be heard, of course, but so long as he stayed in his present position he could not be seen.
<name>Jennings</name>	Jennings	Winston	At the heart of it, magnified by the curved surface, there was a strange, pink, convoluted object that recalled a rose or a sea anemone. “What is it?” said [MASK], fascinated. “That’s coral, that is,” said the old man.
<name>Peabody</name>	Peabody	O’Brien	Then suddenly the grim face broke down into what might have been the beginnings of a smile. With his characteristic gesture [MASK] resettled his spectacles on his nose. “Shall I say it, or will you?” he said.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	“Thirty to forty group! Take your places, please. Thirties to forties!” [MASK] sprang to attention in front of the telescreen, upon which the image of a youngish woman, scrawny but muscular, dressed in tunic and gym shoes, had already appeared.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	[MASK] was good at this kind of thing. On occasion he had even been entrusted with the rectification of the Times leading articles, which were written entirely in Newspeak. He unrolled the message that he had set aside earlier.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	It was the lonely hour of fifteen. A tinny music trickled from the telescreens. [MASK] sat in his usual corner, gazing into an empty glass. Now and again he glanced up at a vast face which eyed him from the opposite wall.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Winston	Your especial fear is that it will be your backbone. You have a vivid mental picture of the vertebrae snapping apart and the spinal fluid dripping out of them. That is what you are thinking, is it not, [MASK]?”
<name>Dorothy</name>	Dorothy	Winston	From time to time [MASK] caught some such remark as “I think you’re so right, I do so agree with you,” uttered in a youthful and rather silly feminine voice. But the other voice never stopped for an instant, even when the girl was speaking.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	“How can I help seeing what is in front of my eyes? Two and two are four.” “Sometimes, [MASK]. Sometimes they are five. Sometimes they are three. Sometimes they are all of them at once. You must try harder.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Julia	There were no sheets, but the blanket they lay on was threadbare and smooth, and the size and springiness of the bed astonished both of them. “It’s sure to be full of bugs, but who cares?” said [MASK].
<name>Prendick</name>	Prendick	Winston	“Shall I say it, or will you?” he said. “I will say it,” said [MASK] promptly. “That thing is really turned off?” “Yes, everything is turned off. We are alone.”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	But at any rate he had the appearance of being a person that you could talk to, if somehow you could cheat the telescreen and get him alone. [MASK] had never made the smallest effort to verify this guess; indeed, there was no way of doing so.
<name>Arty</name>	Arty	Ark	“And what in hell’s name is a pint?” said the barman, leaning forward with the tips of his fingers on the counter. “ ’[MASK] at ’im! Calls ’isself a barman and don’t know what a pint is!
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	[MASK] started to his feet. The shock of the sight had driven all caution out of him. For the first time in many years he forgot the presence of the telescreen. “They’ve got you too!” he cried.
<name>Men</name>	Men	Men	But we create human nature. [MASK] are infinitely malleable. Or perhaps you have returned to your old idea that the proletarians or the slaves will arise and overthrow us. Put it out of your mind. They are helpless, like the animals.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Julia	Feeling slightly ashamed of himself, he sat up against the bedhead. [MASK] got out of bed, pulled on her overalls, and made the coffee. The smell that rose from the saucepan was so powerful and exciting that they shut the window lest anybody outside should notice it and become inquisitive.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Winston	“When you were a young man we were all living in the tree-tops,” said the barman, with a glance at the other customers. There was a shout of laughter, and the uneasiness caused by [MASK]’s entry seemed to disappear.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Withers	One could assume that [MASK] and his associates were now in disgrace, but there had been no report of the matter in the press or on the telescreen. That was to be expected, since it was unusual for political offenders to be put on trial or even publicly denounced.
<name>Inspector</name>	Inspector	Comrade	The man had actually flung himself on his knees on the floor, with his hands clasped together. “[MASK]! Officer!” he cried. “You don’t have to take me to that place! Haven’t I told you everything already?
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	They wrenched off the boots with which she had been trying to kick them, and dumped her down across [MASK]’s lap, almost breaking his thighbones. The woman hoisted herself upright and followed them out with a yell of “F-----bastards!”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Winston	Big Brother Is Watching You, the caption said, while the dark eyes looked deep into [MASK]’s own. Down at street level another poster, tom at one comer, flapped fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the single word INGSOC.
