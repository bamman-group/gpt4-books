<name>Chalmers</name>	Chalmers	Coe	I had an uncle who wintered there.” “You surprise me, doctor,” said [MASK]. “The Spanish climate can be beastly.” “He didn’t go for the climate,” replied my father, warmed up a little and returned to his natural self.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Sunday	This is luxurious to behold after such a long journey through such an inhospitable and barren wilderness. We kill antelope, energy much recruited by fresh meat. [MASK] traded dried fruit for % side bacon—no sugar. April 29: Ready for the ascent.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Shep	the glare seemed to fade in his eyes, and he toppled forward on his face. At almost the same instant, [MASK] flung out of the tap, beet-red with drink, but when he spied the boy he went all to pieces.
<name>Phileas</name>	Phileas	Bridger	Once, rolling along a perfectly straight, well-marked trail, in what seemed like the middle of the desert, [MASK] stopped and glanced to the right and left, as if checking his bearings. Then he uncorked his spyglass and had a careful look around.
<name>Virgil</name>	Virgil	Horace	I topped this assertion with a ringing jibe from [MASK], in the native Latin, of which he knows nothing, unless he has familiarized himself with the E Pluribus Unum on coins, and he left in disorderly retreat. As to the storm, it has shaken the nerves of even the sturdiest.
<name>Victory</name>	Victory	Fortune	So we kept quiet and waited. The miserable part was that his pomp and bluster were gone. He’d lost most of that bubbling-up confidence, the real honest feeling that [MASK] lay just round the corner. I hated to see him so.
<name>Barlow</name>	Barlow	Kissel	His hatchet is missing, likewise one of my pistols, with several rounds of shot, together with a plug of [MASK]’s tobacco, and other articles that can only point to a selfish, whimsical frolic among the scented rushes.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Reverend	Then he took a snap, though perfectly mannerly, at that bread and it disappeared from the public view forever. Watching him carefully, my father said, “[MASK], what happens to the money you take up in collecting?”
<name>Death</name>	Death	Sioux	The result is that they try constantiy to trade. After facing their horses toward us, the chief, with what I took, to be a fleeting smile (for their reputation as fighters is fierce) made the sign for ‘ [MASK] — the edge of his hand across the throat.
<name>Finally</name>	Finally	Altogether	The old man came right on, then pitched into the same tirade he’d given me, pointing at the girl, who stood aside, waiting, as if she’d done it often before. [MASK], I guess, he unloaded about ten thousand words.
<name>Stevenson</name>	Stevenson	Reverend	Was he joking? I saw my father start then, looking at him, recover and fall into the same vein. “You surprise me, [MASK].” “As you remarked, sir, tonight’s was a meeting to remember.
<name>Ne'er</name>	Ne'er	Ne’er	He just potters around. I suppose you might say he’s a farmer by trade.” My father shook his head in sympathy. “[MASK]-do-well, is he? I know the breed, if you don’t mind my saying so.
<name>Slade</name>	Slade	McBride	Even at that, he was easier about them than his “protege,” who was itching to kill a few and notch up his guns. “A man orta put the smelly devils in their place, once he gets the chance,” [MASK] told us.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Kennedy	Will he bite you?” [MASK]’s breathing became increasingly difficult in the late evening. This together with insane excitement while threshing in our grip—screaming, spitting and, finally, snapping, giving forth doglike howls that chilled the blood-marked the last hours of the victim.
<name>Miss</name>	Miss	Sister	Two Number Three steel buttons? Certainly, [MASK]. That will be three cents. And we thank you. It’s warm for this time of year.” He bowed her out, and I left. I’d heard all I cared to for one day.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Coulter	[MASK] came over at one point and looked on from a distance, but he went away again shaking his head as if he’d been watching a pack of lunatics. And I can’t much say I blame him.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jennie	It’s pine selfishness.” “You poor ninny,” said [MASK], blushing, “don’t you know anything?” As usual, she’d dodged the issue. That was one of the main troubles with this schemer; she never could stick to the point.
<name>Hagrid</name>	Hagrid	Coulter	I probably shouldn’t mention it, but his pants were so far gone that he was completely exposed, you might say. And with a man the size of [MASK], he was more exposed than most. But nobody appeared to mind or take any notice.
<name>Raffles</name>	Raffles	Slater	I’d never known [MASK] to be so happy and outgoing. He acted more like a man about to have a monument unveiled to him, and I had to shake myself to remember that all the merriment was because he was in danger of being hung.
<name>McGillicuddy</name>	McGillicuddy	Bridger	[MASK] pointed back. “It’s that pesky road-block—a mountain of pure glass. You can’t see it unless you get right on top, almost.” “Where?” cried my father. “Surely you can’t be serious.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Coulter	The next one raises his voice or hand against you”—he turned and looked around slowly—“is going to have me to whip.” [MASK] gave a dry kind of chuckle that ended in a cough; then he said, “I wouldn’t envy him, I sure wouldn’t.”
<name>Shadow</name>	Shadow	Coulter	With one foot, roughly. [MASK] rolled him over; it was one of the young men in Sick from Blackberries’ wigwam. He’d been very uppity once, kicking and slapping me around, but he didn’t cut much of a figure now.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Opportunity	But they already had a bank here. Sleeping and cooking in the shed, picking up work on the streets, but not enough, and making the rounds the rest of the time, we hung on, but I still failed to see any signs of [MASK] turning up.
<name>Jupiter</name>	Jupiter	Jerusalem	It almost looks like—1” I got up and went over. “Holy, jumping [MASK]!” My head spun around so I got almost faint, out of excitement. There were crevices there that had hunks of gold, solid gold, in them, as big as marbles.
<name>Rinaldo</name>	Rinaldo	Coulter	You may well believe, dear wife, that this swarthy fellow often seems one of the greatest charlatans alive, besides being uniquely offensive. The thought struck us at the same moment—[MASK] was no more hunter than the callowest child among us, but had deceived us when hiring out as guide.
<name>He</name>	He	Thomas	And when somebody requested a yard of muslin or half a pound of tea, how he spread himself. No stranger could have told him from the owner. [MASK] sort of took a back seat, being entirely willing to do so because my father was a born salesman.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Coulter	Inspecting him with an air of pity, [MASK] said, "I’d almost forgot what an ugly old squirrel you are. It’s always a shock. Why in hades don’t you shave? It might help some.”
<name>Trumbull</name>	Trumbull	Coulter	[MASK] said that was the way he got his amusement, and my father added later that what he was, at heart, was “a first-rate working humorist, a rose wasting his fragrance on the desert air.” When we went inside.
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	Coe	It had to do with drinking wine to keep your stomach from getting out of whack. “So you see, scriptural authority exists,” my father added, and grabbed the little crystal tumbler that [MASK] held out.
<name>Calpurnia</name>	Calpurnia	fife	As I walked through the twilight toward the kitchen, brooding on [MASK]’s injustices, she called out, “Might be I put by a plate of chicken along with grits and combread and salat in the warming oven—for the cat.”
<name>Thatcher</name>	Thatcher	Lynch	“There’s been a lot of loose talk about old Judge [MASK] around here, but no man, and I repeat, no man, be he white, black, green or striped, is going to be hung in this county without a trial beforehand.”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Reverend	“Sounds interesting,” said my father, "but there isn’t much nourishment in it.” Then he added, “See here, [MASK], you’ll have to buy yourself some proper food now and then if you wish to keep up your strength.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Coulter	A few were unconscious but others were moaning or screaming in pain. Somebody said that a lot more would be screaming, except that the burned cases were still in shock, and couldn’t feel a thing, the way [MASK] had been, I guess.
<name>Jove</name>	Jove	George	“While here, let us observe and annotate. We have a priceless opportunity to document this curious movement for the world.” “By [MASK], you’ve hit it,” cried my father, sitting down and looking more satisfied.
<name>Mac</name>	Mac	Coulter	There was nothing to be done except go on, so we plodded ahead slowly, over the faint ruts visible through the weeds. The sun sailed up high—it was hot today—and making it worse we “Anything to be done, doc?” asked [MASK].
<name>hero</name>	hero	Coulter	Employing an old plains trick, our rascally [MASK] merely set up shop on a likely knoll two miles distant, thrust his sapling into the ground with the flannel tied to the free end, concealed himself in the bush, and awaited developments. They were not long forthcoming.
<name>Caesar</name>	Caesar	Agricola	“What they’d say would be, ‘The Indian the rifle fired.’ You may take my word for that; I’ll get affidavits if necessary. Now let us consider a sentence in the actual language, in Latin itself. Listen carefully. [MASK] in horto est.
<name>Chub</name>	Chub	Muller	Sidling around, I peered up the street into the darkness. Then I saw something move across the street, a shape blacker than the shadows. I said to myself, what if [MASK]’s got somebody watching the house? We’d never get out.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Shep	I wondered where he was, and if he reached home. Evidently [MASK] had the same idea, because he said, “We’d better hump ourselves—that boy’ll be back soon, and he’ll bring help.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Melissa	So, [MASK], I have been obliged to recount a tragedy of the trail, the terrible reward of one hopeful who will never see any gold fields but those he mentioned in his letter. His memorial lies before me as I write.
<name>Grey</name>	Grey	Coulter	Now what do you say?” I couldn’t do any more than nod again. “You may be making a mistake, doctor,” said [MASK]. “An Indian’s ways ain’t necessarily your ways. Even a kid this age.”
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Coulter	Now she was beginning to recover a little, she was handsome and lively. And since she’d been married, she was different, somehow. She had lost her sharp look and was softer and rounder. But there wasn’t much improvement in her manner toward [MASK].
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Coe	Saturday last, very late in the evening, when only [MASK] and I remained awake of our several families, and on a day when the weather—cold, blustery, spitting occasional snow—was so unpleasant that nobody stirred abroad, there came another tapping at our door, very different this time.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Kissel	It’s happened to me more than once. I figure that next year we’ll work up a better system—maybe fix a hook and chain for pulling. That ought to serve very well. What do you think. [MASK]?”
<name>Wilmot</name>	Wilmot	Bridger	"I’ve got a fair knowledge of it,” said [MASK]. “I’ve been out three times, and enjoyed it, but wouldn’t care to live there.” “Why not?” demanded my father, bridling slightly. “Well, sir.
<name>horses</name>	horses	Jaimie	In buying our provender we were warned to allow for an appetite on the road of almost twice that at home, and such has proved the case. The sight of our [MASK] in the early morning, at “catch-up” time, would warm your heart.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jennie	This girl [MASK] is as fresh and sparkling as a rosebud, now that her spirit is mended, but I must add in fairness that the lovely petals are protected by a thorn. Masked over by an innocent smile, she has a caprice of steel.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Coe	Then he gave every appearance of alarm, as if the Fort was under attack. It set my father and the others back a notch, especially [MASK], who had a pretty stiff notion of manners, even after all these weeks on the trail.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	John	[MASK] went on: “You probably ort to know that your train ain’t to say on fire to regain you. They’re sick of you—that was proved last night.” “What do you know about it?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	This was disappointing, but it wasn’t certain we had a good place, so we killed another hour mov- ing farther up, skipping two ravines because a bunch of Chinamen were working a cradle in the first one and some people had a Long [MASK] going in the second.
<name>Wolf</name>	Wolf	Coulter	What happened next remains blurred in my mind. [MASK]’s actions were performed with such rapidity that they confused us all. I was strongly reminded of the classic notion of a wolf striking at the throat of the slow-moving moose.
<name>Snuffy</name>	Snuffy	Coulter	[MASK] was a sight. Nearly all of his black hair had burned off, his forehead was cracked and purple, he hadn’t any more eyelashes than a snake, what little clothing was left still smoked, and his hands were dripping blood.
<name>Max</name>	Max	Coe	“I’m glad you didn’t get away,” said my father, “though I must admit it’s tempting. Let’s go back to bed. Maybe something will happen before noon.” “I hope not, doctor,” said [MASK].
<name>Ulysses</name>	Ulysses	Louisville	Full recovery indicated. The main trouble with doctoring was, nobody really felt inclined to pay their bill. It was the last thing on their list. And just like [MASK], my father hadn’t any stomach to send out statements.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Coulter	he came out, weaving back and forth, his hands working in the air, not unlike a swimmer’s pawing through water, and suddenly aimed a heavy, unsporting kick at the vulnerable area of [MASK]’s crotch. Had it landed, it might well have crippled him for life.
<name>Revere</name>	Revere	Kay	On the day when I first learned of my father’s journey, I had come back with two companions from a satisfactory afternoon in the weeds near [MASK]’s Bell Foundry, shooting a slingshot at the new bells, which were lying out in the yard and strung up on rafters.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Todd	[MASK] and I used tablespoons; they were equally as good as picks, better for this work, which people around the diggings called “crevicing.” We estimated we took out about eight hundred and fifty dollars that first day, and we hadn’t got started yet.
<name>Wickson</name>	Wickson	Brice	In addition to that—” “Yes,” said [MASK], again, remembering things better now, “it was a nice little business. We would pack the cakes deep in the sawdust, and through the hottest summer there wasn’t enough shrinkage to notice.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Spot	But I don’t recollect ever being so played out. We’d been 338 keyed up and nervous for days, and now we had gone all night without sleep. Off and on, I rode [MASK] a little, but mostly I walked to keep him fresh.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Slater	“I’ll look after you till you find your pa.” We talked awhile, then, and agreed that I should visit [MASK] in jail, to see if we could make things easier for him. “He was an honest man once,” she said.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Shep	“Leave me do all the talking,” he said, aiming his remarks mostly at [MASK], who, with his horse, was looking impatient. “There won’t be any trouble— nobody knows us around here. Only don’t say anything you don’t have to.
<name>Hastings</name>	Hastings	Ware	The oxen are refreshed, the equipment can be patched up, and folks just seem to get back their strength generally. Several of you set such a store by [MASK] and his guidebook, I’m surprised you haven’t taken his word.
<name>Rooster</name>	Rooster	Joe	Them last two bunches couldn’t a raised enough cash for a basket of turnips. All we got was the pleasure of knocking them on the head and this girl here, and that only because of [MASK]’s fastidity notions.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Coulter	[MASK], horseback, arrived a few seconds later. He took the news on the run, then spun himself off the saddle and right through the burning canvas. Everybody stood talking, and one of the men who was so outspoken against him before, said, “It was the bravest act I ever witnessed.
<name>Yancey</name>	Yancey	Kissel	Strapped on, the gun made no noticeable bulge under his coat. This was handy, for our other pistols were ruined in the firing of [MASK]’s wagon. Just the same, I spoke up; I couldn’t help it.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Brice	My father now got me aside to inquire if I didn’t think [MASK]’s condition was a little worse, because he talked so, and said, “It isn’t natural, it has a compulsive quality that I, as his physician, find alarming.
<name>God</name>	God	Providence	Where I live now, writing our story, I don’t much keep up with events, but I’d like to bet that that same operation was done not long afterwards, just as he promised. “[MASK] has answered my prayers, bpy,” he said, wiping his eyes.
<name>Satan</name>	Satan	Satan	“Get thee behind me, [MASK]. Or come out and fight in the open.” Everybody cried “A-a-a-amen,” and “If you’re aiming to fight the Reverend, fight fair,” relishing every word.
<name>Absalom</name>	Absalom	Joab	I wailed and took on and begged him not to do it, but he quoted four or five verses from the Bible, mostly having to do with a man named [MASK], who had a fight in a tree, and told me to shut my trap.
<name>Pa</name>	Pa	Coulter	She did a man’s work to keep us fed and growing.” “Us?” He snapped the reins at the oxen, and said, “Camp time, soon. Time I was back in the saddle.” “How many in the family, [MASK]?”
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Coulter	They called them wagon-dogs, because the owners had formerly been cart drivers, you see, and the dogs were trained to trot along underneath, and not stray. Anyhow, [MASK] had made a few grouchy remarks, but the dogs hadn’t caused anybody any fuss.
<name>Numbers</name>	Numbers	Micah	An ingestion of the spilled contents by the Kissel children, Deuteronomy, [MASK], Leviticus and Lamentations, appears to have had no ill effect; on the contrary, they are filled with crackling good spirits being somewhat more vocal than formerly.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Coulter	“This is some better,” said [MASK], running his hand over her shiny black hair. “But it isn’t all that bad. I’ll own up that arm got in my way. I do everything better with my right, and the other was jealous.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Kissel	They meant to make this University the finest anywhere, and the handsomest. [MASK] pitched in first at a big square given over for an athletic field and equestrian ring. I went out with him the first day, and it was jolly to see how he relished getting back in harness.
<name>Emmeline</name>	Emmeline	Jennie	It would only produce argument, and if there’s one thing I can’t stand, it’s wrangling with females. Even my father had lately commented on the uppity ways of women, after [MASK] made some kind of statement about “equality.”
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Coulter	Over the uproar, I could hear [MASK] bawling for the dozenth time, “Pick a horse, pick a horse—forget the man.” By now I was no longer firing, but had quit by request to tend wounded.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Spot	Our adobe house was warm and snug, we were saving up our money; the mules and [MASK] had been hired out to a farmer; and the wagons stashed in a safe place. Our impatience to wait for spring was almost forgotten.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Baggott	“Now what might you be doing out here?” said [MASK]. “Come to try your hand with a bow and arrer?” This seemed to strike him as funny, for he gave a rude laugh before going on.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Jaimie	It is painful to recount that only last night, before supper, she announced that she felt it time to wash both [MASK]’s and my underwear; moreover, she stood flintly by until we had gone in and handed them out.
<name>Shane</name>	Shane	Jennie	“I reckon I’m done roaming,” he said. “I never heard of any one-handed trail scouts.” “Oh, you’ll roam,” [MASK] said, “when you get the itch.”
<name>Peewee</name>	Peewee	Jaimie	“Only if you sell me to another.” “Great jumping Jupiter, child! I’m not planning to sell you. I’m not going to own you, either. All right. I’ll sell you to [MASK]. How much do you offer?
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Todd	In a few days, we planned to move camp up nearer, but for now we would sleep at the diggings overnight and come back for supper tomorrow. [MASK] and I waited on the bank overlooking the site. Everything looked the same; the claim signs were in place; all was ready.
<name>George</name>	George	Jupiter	Talk up, or by [MASK], I’ll—” Seizing my jacket, he gave me a yank that put a crick in my neck, and I began to blubber. “I couldn’t stood it any longer. I was black and blue the whole first year.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Shep	He didn’t look so good, all bundled up in oily bandages, with his black hair gone. I was sorry for him, all right, but I couldn’t get out of my mind about him backing off from [MASK]. But I heard more about that soon.
<name>Francis</name>	Francis	Coulter	He was always bragging about things I did, whenever I did something. “But there wasn’t time for woolgathering, for the leaves gave a rustle, his antlers poked into view and I let drive—” He stopped. “Go ahead, [MASK].
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Kennedy	Who knows—these jottings, upon the possible maturity of rabies, may play a small part in the understanding of cases yet to come. Seated on robes by our campfire (the others having retired) [MASK] discussed his emotions, an astounding revelation.
<name>He</name>	He	Jaimie	There wasn’t any sense in it. By the time I got out, I’d be too old to do anything except retire, and you didn’t need an education for that. “[MASK]’s not the type,” said my father.
<name>Joad</name>	Joad	Slater	[MASK]’s horse, which might have brought seventy-five cents for glue, now had a lame front leg, along with mange, colic, coughing fits, heaves, saddle sores, fistula, and a sway-back, so we had to go slow.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Brice	He said he was prepared to go as high as three dollars for anybody that didn’t look like a false face.” She boxed my ears sort of playfully, but it stung all the same. “I’ve had enough of your sass about [MASK], the poor addled man.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Coe	Both of my uncles in exactly the same boat, and most of my cousins.” He shook his head again, then roused himself to observe, “However run-down your family, [MASK], nobody could ever call you, personally, a loafer.
<name>Flanagan</name>	Flanagan	Brice	Enjoying this repast that evening, and foregoing the usual dinner of “salt junk,” or pork, we looked at her with something akin to tenderness. And I must say that in [MASK]’s glance, as he filled his mouth with breast and dripping drumstick, was a glint of speculation.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Bridger	[MASK] was the last through, and he caused offense by shaking out on a paper a pile of brown shreds, measuring it with great solemnity, adding a few particles, taking some away, and generally showing concern over the amount.
<name>Quatermain</name>	Quatermain	Coulter	Twenty minutes later, [MASK] scrambled rapidly around the enclosure, passing out hand weapons of every variety-axes, knives, his own tomahawk—gained God knows where— mallets, hammers, clubs, anything to repel the concerted rush we all now expected.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Coulter	and the camp, silent before, turned into a perfect cyclone of noise and confusion. It couldn’t have been over a minute before [MASK] came riding down, but by then three or four men had run out with lanterns. “Over there!
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Bridger	Then a forehead rose very cautiously and a voice bellowed out: “Flag of truce!” “If you’re surrendering, lay down your guns and step out one by one,” [MASK] called down. “We’re claiming flag of truce for burial.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Matlock	Hearing these remarks, the sufferers appeared to brighten. But I am disturbed about our prospects for harmony. The train seems in danger of being rent by factionalism. The group which abandoned the sawmill, headed by [MASK], the big farmer, clings stolidly to itself.
<name>Drummond</name>	Drummond	Coulter	I’ve met in the course of a lifetime devoted to the study of such creatures. I don’t believe anything about him. I don’t even think he’s an Indian fighter.” “Well,” observed [MASK], “you can’t say I didn’t warn you.
<name>Tristram</name>	Tristram	Bridger	1594-1794. Rest in Peace.’ “However—” [MASK] paused and squinted sideways at my father. “Yes, of course. I quite understand,” said my father in disgust, as if he was talking to an idiot.
<name>Quiller</name>	Quiller	Shep	Then [MASK] brought out his right arm from behind him, holding a pistol, so the sentence he hadn’t finished was a lie, of course, and a piece of trickery, and tried to bring it up level. But he sat down in the street instead, feeling himself in bewilderment.
<name>Chingachgook</name>	Chingachgook	Shoshone	“I believe it’s [MASK],” I said. “The women I saw seldom ever wash their bodies, and the only shift they make in the wigwam is to pull a person out when he’s died. The stench gets so fierce it commonly tans the hide walls.”
