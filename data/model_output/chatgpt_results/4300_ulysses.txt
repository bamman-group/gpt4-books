<name>Bloom</name>	Bloom	Truelock	What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can’t always save you, though. If I had passed [MASK]’s window that day two minutes later would have been shot.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Bloom	(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oakframe a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown artcolours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews stands over [MASK].)
<name>Croker</name>	Croker	Monks	The foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly, saying: —Wait. Where’s the archbishop’s letter? It’s to be repeated in the Telegraph. Where’s what’s his name? He looked about him round his loud unanswering machines. —[MASK], sir?

<name>Herod</name>	Herod	Herod	Pshaw, I tell thee! He is a mule, a dead gasteropod, without vim or stamina, not worth a cracked kreutzer. Copulation without population! No, say I! [MASK]’s slaughter of the innocents were the truer name. Vegetables, forsooth, and sterile cohabitation!
<name>Bloom</name>	Bloom	Pompedy	Wonder how it first struck him. Sitting at home after pig’s cheek and cabbage nursing it in the armchair. Rehearsing his band part. Pom. [MASK]. Jolly for the wife. Asses’ skins. Welt them through life, then wallop after death.

<name>The priest</name>	The priest	Bell	There he goes. Funny little beggar. Wonder where he lives. Belfry up there. Very likely. Hanging by his heels in the odour of sanctity. [MASK] scared him out, I suppose. Mass seems to be over. Could hear them all at it.
<name>Prince Hohenlohe</name>	Prince Hohenlohe	Antichrist	Well, it was in the papers about [MASK]. O, my foot’s tickling. (Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patter past, yelling.) THE NEWSBOYS: Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Alf	Talking about hanging, I’ll show you something you never saw. Hangmen’s letters. Look at here. So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket. —Are you codding? says I. —Honest injun, says [MASK].
<name>Bloom</name>	Bloom	BLOOM	Me see. [MASK]: Simply satisfying a need I... (With pathos.) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn’t play... (High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping currants.)
<name>Guy</name>	Guy	Bloom	(Invests [MASK] in a yellow habit with embroidery of painted flames and high pointed hat. He places a bag of gunpowder round his neck and hands him over to the civil power, saying.) Forgive him his trespasses.

<name>Whittington</name>	Whittington	Leopold	That is to say he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life! (Midnight chimes from distant steeples.) THE CHIMES: Turn again, [MASK]!
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Stephen	but it’s a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God. —O that, [MASK] expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several of the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial evidence.
<name>Geryon</name>	Geryon	Blake	And yet it was in some way if not as memory fabled it. A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of [MASK]’s wings of excess. I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry, and time one livid final flame.

<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Messenger	[MASK] took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar.
