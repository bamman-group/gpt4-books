<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Tommy	"I think you ought to stay out of it. She'll have the baby, and go home to them. If she has a problem, she can always call us. I'm sure [MASK] will stay in touch with her. He's crazy about the girl.
<name>his sister</name>	his sister	Maribeth	So much seemed to be happening at once. Much of it was happy. But some of it was painful. But his mother was happier than he'd seen her all year, and when he saw [MASK], she was serious and quiet.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Maribeth	And he was like a raging bull as he stormed around the living room, telling [MASK] how she was just like her aunts, and had behaved like a whore, and dishonored them all. And then he demanded to know who had gotten her pregnant.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Tommy	[MASK] suddenly looked very guarded, and when his father came into the room, he saw an odd look pass between his parents. The hostility between them had lessened a little bit since his mother had gone back to work, but the distance seemed greater than ever.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Maribeth	She was a tall girl, but her hips were narrow, and she had always been thin. [MASK] was beginning to panic every time she thought about giving birth to a baby. She admitted it to him that night, and he felt sorry for her.
<name>Cinderella</name>	Cinderella	Cinderella	He sounded intrigued, and looked gorgeous. "Who are you?" "I'm [MASK]. My Buick just turned into a pumpkin, and my date turned into a drunk, and I came out here looking for my glass slipper. Have you seen it?"
<name>the person being referred to is not specified</name>	the person being referred to is not specified	Annie	He grinned, looking sheepish, and she noticed freckles on the bridge of his nose for the first time. They were tiny and almost golden in the bright sunlight. "She'd have been right too. Usually she wasn't." But [MASK] would have sensed immediately how much he liked her.
<name>the doctor</name>	the doctor	Tommy	My parents won't even let me come home, unless I come home without it." She had tears in her eyes as she explained her situation, and by then [MASK] had come back again, and the doctor patted her hand, sorry for her.
<name>West</name>	West	Danielli	He figured she was probably a senior. "I'm going to be doing some work on my own, 98 [MASK] Stul until I go back after Christmas." She said it defensively, and he wondered why she had dropped out, but he decided not to ask her.
<name>Chris</name>	Chris	Maribeth	"You've got your college education now, [MASK]. The rest is up to you. I don't think it's going to be easy at home, your father's not an easy man, but I think he's done some thinking too.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Maribeth	She could hardly manage her own, let alone someone else's. She was only sixteen. "Wow, [MASK]. You've got your hands full." He moved closer to her, and put an arm around her again, and pulled her close to him.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Maribeth	[MASK] felt her heart crash to the floor, and didn't see him face-to-face until Wednesday. He was very kind to her, and stopped to say something to her, as she tried to avert her face from him while she put something in her locker.
<name>her husband</name>	her husband	Annie	She had forgotten how rewarding it was, and how much she enjoyed it. She had been at home for so long that the pleasures of teaching had somehow faded. But now, with [MASK] gone, it filled a void she couldn't fill otherwise.
<name>her husband</name>	her husband	Tommy	“Shell be fine. I promise." They brought her down to her room an hour later, still half asleep and very woozy, but she saw [MASK] instantly and clung to his hand, telling him how much she loved him, and how pretty the baby was.
<name>she</name>	she	Liz	"I love you," he whispered from the other side, and [MASK] nodded and mouthed the same back to him. She loved him too, and she realized now with terror and gratitude that they almost hadn't made it.
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Bert	Her teachers had filled her head with ideas about how smart she was. And there was nothing wrong with a girl getting an education, to a point, as far as [MASK] was concerned, as long as she knew when to stop, and when to use it.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Tommy	At eight-fifteen she and [MASK] ate, and at nine, his father walked in, obviously having had a few too many drinks, but in very high spirits. "Well, well, the little woman cooked dinner for a change!"
<name>her</name>	her	Liz	"They're so young," he smiled as he talked to her, and then said he thought it was too bad she was giving up the baby, but he didn't want to say more. He didn't want [MASK] to think he was intruding.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Liz	They baked cookies and bread and biscuits together in the afternoons, or [MASK] read to her for hours as they sat together in the big cozy kitchen. Their lives were a warm place, where all four of them felt safe from the kinds of things that happened to other people.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	John	They were too desperately distraught themselves to ever help him. "I guess it doesn't matter anymore, does it, [MASK]? None of it does. None of the little niceties that used to seem so important. We've all given up."
<name>Katie</name>	Katie	Maribeth	" [MASK] could hardly squeeze the words out. She was breathless with the grief of leaving her little sister. "Tell her you're going away to school. Tell her anything but the truth. She's too young to know about this."
<name>someone</name>	someone	Liz	In some ways, I envy them." There was something about starting out again that appealed to him, about having a new life and a clean slate. He would have loved to start fresh with [MASK]. But for them, in some ways, it was too late now.
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Maribeth	He had been a mystery to them ever since he'd started coming in the previous winter. He never said anything to them, he just came in and ordered dinner. But with [MASK], he had really come alive and he never seemed to stop talking.
<name>Elvis</name>	Elvis	Tommy	Talk to her sometimes when you're alone . . . she'll hear you . . . you'll hear her . . . you'll never lose her." [MASK] looked at him strangely for a minute, wondering if he was crazy, and then nodded.
<name>she</name>	she	Annie	He took the tree out of the back of the truck, and she carried the box of decorations. They were the smallest ones, the ones [MASK] had loved, with little teddy bears, and toy soldiers blowing horns, and tiny angels.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Maribeth	oh God . . . oh [MASK] . . ." And then as he returned slowly to earth, he looked at her, as she stared at him in shock, unable to believe what they'd done, and he gently touched her face with his fingers.
<name>he</name>	he	Tommy	his mother asked, looking disapproving. "She has to work. She can't go back to school till she goes home, after the baby." "And then what?" His mother was pressing him, and even [MASK] didn't have all the answers.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Annie	She touched the prickly branches then, like a little friend, and whispered her name . . . just the sound of it touched her heart like baby fingers. "I love you, little girl ... I always will . . . sweet, sweet [MASK] . . .
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Liz	You have to give it so much, you have to be there for your kids . . . you have to be someone I'm not yet . . . you have to be grown up," she said with eyes filled with tears, as [MASK]’s heart went out to her.
<name>God</name>	God	Maribeth	Her mother was too weak, her father too stubborn to ever listen, her brother too self-centered and too foolish. She only had [MASK] to listen to her problems, and now she would have no one at all.
<name>She</name>	She	Maribeth	he asked, when he took her home, trying to seem casual. "Being married I mean.” He looked so young and innocent when he said it. But [MASK] had already promised his mother, and herself, that she wouldn't let him do it.
<name>her</name>	her	Annie	He couldn't bear sitting at their kitchen table without [MASK], couldn't bring himself to go home in the afternoon and not share milk and cookies with her. He just couldn't stand being in his house with- out her.
<name>her</name>	her	Annie	She had made him feel better about [MASK] for the first time in months, and he would have liked to return the favor. "Nothing . . . just daydreaming, 1 guess . . . there's nothing special . . .
<name>he</name>	he	Tommy	The doctor looked at her pointedly, and she looked sheepish. "I promise." And when [MASK] left to get the car, she reminded him again that she was not planning to keep the baby, and she wanted him to find a family to adopt it.
<name>Rachel</name>	Rachel	Maribeth	And then as he returned slowly to earth, he looked at her, as she stared at him in shock, unable to believe what they'd done, and he gently touched her face with his fingers. "Oh God, [MASK], I'm sorry . . .
<name>Mrs. Compson</name>	Mrs. Compson	Liz	[MASK] kept looking down at her, and smoothing the blond hair back from her face. She kissed her forehead once or twice, and the white heat of her child's head horrified her as her lips touched her.
<name>Meg</name>	Meg	Maribeth	She was breathless with the grief of leaving her little sister. "Tell her you're going away to school. Tell her anything but the truth. She's too young to know about this." [MASK] nodded, numb finally, too grief-stricken even to answer.
<name>her</name>	her	Maribeth	He smiled, thinking about her, and moved closer to [MASK] on the warm sand, laying his pole down beside him. In a funny way, it felt good talking about her now, as though it brought her back to him for the briefest of moments.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Paul	But it would have seemed so odd to hang on to [MASK]'s child, and start out so wrong. She wondered if she ever could have managed it. But she didn't have to think about it now. All she had to do was let go, and leave.
<name>she</name>	she	John	She didn't look thrilled, but [MASK] nodded agreement. It had gone as well as it could have, given the circumstances. But they seemed pleased, and there was a festive atmosphere between them for the rest of the evening.
<name>someone</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	someone (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	Annie	all the soft- ness and warmth he had known had hardened to stone, and all he saw in her eyes now was despair, and pain, and sorrow. It was obvious that none of them were going to survive the death of [MASK].
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Maribeth	"Come on, [MASK]. We won't get another chance. They go away about once every five years." "I don't think your mom would want us sleeping in her bed," she said primly. "Okay, then sleep in mine.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Maribeth	Maybe one day, when she was grown up, if she needed to know, they would tell her. But in the meantime, [MASK] had no need to tell her the truth, and she didn't want to hurt anyone, not them, or the baby.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Maribeth	Thank you, [MASK]." He knew she really wanted to make an effort to meet his parents. She knew it was important to him, and she didn't want to embarrass him. It was bad enough that she was almost seven months pregnant.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Jimmy	"You can do anything you want, you know. [MASK] doesn't mind. He's a cute kid, and he really likes you." "He's just a friend, that's all. He says his mom hates to cook so he comes in here for dinner."
<name>Wheaton</name>	Wheaton	Liz	He had blond hair like [MASK], and sharp blue eyes like his father. He had a good sense of humor and a fine mind, and after the initial shock, he seemed to adjust to the idea of having a baby sister.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Debbie	He nodded, unable to say much of anything for the moment. "I'm getting married in six weeks. [MASK] would kill me if she knew. I told her everything she heard about you were lies and rumors." "What did she hear?"
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Maribeth	You know, my mom could still flunk you if she wanted. She might too, she's really tough on seniors." They were all in high spirits, even the baby that night. It had gotten its energy back with a vengeance and was kicking [MASK] visibly every five minutes.
<name>Mark</name>	Mark	Maribeth	I don't want you to stay away if we do this. No one has to know the baby is yours . . . the baby wouldn't have to know . . . just us. . . . We love you, [MASK], and we don't want to lose you."
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Noelle	"She's really pretty.” The two women cried for a few minutes and then [MASK] got on the phone and sounded starved to hear her. The conversation was a jumble of exclamations and irrelevant bits of information.
<name>her ex-boyfriend</name>	her ex-boyfriend	Liz	"And what did my father say?" She still couldn't get over the fact that [MASK] had met them. They'd driven two hundred and fifty miles to see the parents who had rejected her completely for the last six months.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Annie	He was at home, and she explained that [MASK] had a fever. She didn't want to risk waking her up by taking it, but she had had a hundred and one when she went to bed, which wasn't dangerous.
<name>Aunt Pittypat</name>	Aunt Pittypat	Liz	Her big green eyes made her look like a little girl, and in spite of her vast girth, she looked incredibly pretty. [MASK] had worn a bright blue dress, and a touch of rouge, which no one had seen in a long time.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Maribeth	"I probably wouldn't have made it either, you know," [MASK] said, sliding out on the ice with him, and wondering if she shouldn't. "Especially now. She'd probably have thought I was an elephant.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	John	the gift of life that she couldn't bear . . . the gift of another baby. [MASK] stirred slightly as she got into bed next to him, and she almost wished he would wake up so she could ask him, but he didn't.
<name>Dad</name>	Dad	Noelle	She had called home a couple of times, but her mom just cried, and they wouldn't let her speak to [MASK]. And the last time she called, her mother said that maybe it would be better if she wrote and didn't call them.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Tommy	Bed, or at least a chair. [MASK], push your friend into a chair, please. And no, you may not take her out skating again tomorrow." They both grinned at her like naughty children, and she handed them each a freshly baked chocolate cookie.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucy	All he knew of pregnancy was what he had seen of his mother in voluminous clothes, six years before, and could still remember, and what he'd seen of I Love [MASK] on TV the year before, when she announced that she was expecting.
<name>He</name>	He	Maribeth	No one special." But it was a lie, and she sensed that. [MASK] was more than a friend to him. He was head over heels in love with her, trying to help her keep up with school, and deeply concerned about her baby.
<name>she</name>	she	Maribeth	And suddenly going back to her family seemed so wrong. She had to remind herself it wouldn't be for long. But then her father surprised her. "Your mother and I will come to pick you up," he said gruffly, and [MASK] was stunned.
<name>he</name>	he	Tommy	He was a white-haired gentleman of distinguished years, but his ideas and techniques were considerably more modem than his manners. He was courtly, and formal in some ways, but he was extremely up to date in all the modem practices, and [MASK] knew how much his mother liked him.
<name>her brother</name>	her brother	Ryan	She didn't care if she didn't talk to [MASK], he was just like their father. "He thinks he's protecting them from your mistakes. He doesn't understand. He's probably embarrassed by what happened."
<name>someone</name>	someone	John	"He doesn't seem to understand the difference, or what a rare gem you are." She smiled at the girl who had given her so much. And they wanted to do the same for her. But she and [MASK] had already talked about that.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tommy	They were friendlier again, and they talked more openly about things now. There wasn't the same deafening silence in their bedroom. '[MASK] feels sorry for her too,'' he said. "It's a damn shame she got pregnant.''
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	John	[MASK] was asleep on the bed with all his clothes on when she walked into the room, and she stood and looked at him for a long moment, and turned and closed the door behind her. Maybe it didn't matter anymore what happened between them.
<name>her</name>	her	Maribeth	He nodded tentatively. His knowledge of sex was as sketchy as hers was, possibly more so. And unlike [MASK], he had never done it. He looked at her very oddly then, and she could see he was dying to ask her another question.
<name>Susie</name>	Susie	Maribeth	Maybe he has no mom. Something happened there. He's got the saddest eyes I've ever seen. Why don't you go wait on him and make his day." She gave [MASK] a little push in his direction, down toward his end of the counter.
<name>Auntie</name>	Auntie	Jimmy	There were little booties and a sweater set one of the girls had knitted for her, a pink and blue blanket with little ducks on it, a teddy bear, some toys, a box of diapers from one of the busboys, and [MASK] had bought her a high chair.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Tommy	And no football," he added with a small smile, and [MASK] chuckled. "You have to behave yourselves," he said, and then added another sport they were not supposed to indulge in. "And no intercourse again until after the baby.
<name>job</name>	job	Liz	She wanted to get all the credits she could before she went back to school. And the work [MASK] was giving her was going to be her ticket to freedom. She had every intention of finishing high school in June, and then trying to work her way through college.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Maribeth	We could have eight kids by then, at the rate I'm going." She always had a sense of humor about herself, and about him, but this time she knew he wasn't joking. "Be serious, [MASK]." "I am.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Maribeth	Take care of yourself, [MASK]," he smiled, and she smiled back at him with a wave, as she closed the door softly behind her. And as she got into bed, she thought about how lucky she had been to ever meet him.
<name>Monica</name>	Monica	Maribeth	"I've done a lot of thinking about this," [MASK] said anxiously. "I don't know what you'll think, or say, but ... I ... I want to give you my baby." She almost held her breath after she said it.
<name>the son</name>	the son	Ryan	They were going to be good girls, and marry nice boys. There were to be no tarts in his house, no illicit sex, no wild goings-on, and he had never made any bones about it. Only [MASK] was allowed to do whatever he wanted.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Liz	He could hardly wait for the spring to use it. It was a warm, enjoyable afternoon, and they had a quiet dinner that night, after everyone had gone. [MASK] had made turkey soup, and they ate leftovers from lunch, and some of the goodies people had brought them.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Willie	And for her, it was a heady experience just being with him. "Do you want to go for a little drive? It's only eleven." They had left the dance so early, they'd had plenty of time to talk and dance at [MASK]'s.
<name>she</name>	she	Maribeth	He was a boy, [MASK] wasn't. "If you want to go out, you'll wear a decent dress, or you can stay home and listen to the radio with your mother." The temptation to stay home was great, but then again, her sophomore prom would never come again.
<name>cookies</name>	cookies	Tommy	If this keeps up, you won't even be able to find the pond," he said, munching on one of his mother's delicious cookies. They were mouthwatering, and they were all [MASK] could think of, as his mother carefully took off her apron.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Tommy	She looked sleepy, and she closed her eyes for an instant again, and then opened them slowly, and smiled. "I love you," she said so softly they could hardly hear her. '[MASK]? . . "He's here too.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Tommy	She was too young to shoulder such burdens. "I'll see what I can do," he said quietly, and then told [MASK] to put her to bed for two days. No work, no fun, no sex, no skating.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Tommy	oh God . . . ," he agonized as he ran a hand through his hair and looked panicked. "I can explain. It's not what it looks like." "She's just fat?" his father asked hopefully, and [MASK] looked rueful.
<name>she</name>	she	Maribeth	He asked them where they lived, where they were both from, and then finally how long they'd been married. And [MASK] looked at the doctor for a long moment and then shook her head. "We're not . . . 1 am . . .
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Tommy	"Six and a half months? When did this start?" She tried desperately to count backwards, and was too upset to do it. "When did what start?" [MASK] looked confused. "I told you, I met her this summer.
<name>June</name>	June	Maribeth	"But 1 don't think you should stay there. They'll bury you alive if you let them." [MASK] smiled at the accurate description. Being with her parents was like drowning. "I know they'll try. But they can't do much now, thanks to you.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Maribeth	"He won't change his plans," [MASK] said softly. She was the classic one-night stand, a girl he didn't even know, though he had told her he'd be around if she needed him. Well, she did now.
<name>she</name>	she	Maribeth	She hadn't cared about anything in a long time, and he was glad in a way that [MASK] had sparked that in her again. She had sparked a lot of things, in all of them. In some ways, he felt fatherly toward her. "
<name>Blair</name>	Blair	Annie	It was like visiting a shrine, and it told her just how much they all missed her. But she was laughing, listening to him now, as he told her stories about the girls [MASK] had scared off, mostly because she thought they were too dumb or too ugly.
<name>Allyson</name>	Allyson	Tommy	"I'll bet she can hear you, [MASK]. I'll bet she watches you all the time. Maybe she's happy now . . . maybe some people just aren't meant to be in our lives forever. Maybe some people are just passing through . . .
<name>Mammy</name>	Mammy	Liz	"Please tell him how much I want this," she said, clinging to [MASK]'s hands. "Please ... I don't want my baby to go to strangers. It would be so wonderful if it were here with you . . .
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Liz	It was all she wanted and she couldn't believe he would ever understand that. She knew that if he didn't let her do it, she would die. "All right, [MASK]," he said softly, taking her hands in his own.
<name>Aunt Alexandra</name>	Aunt Alexandra	Julie	"Too bad you and your husband didn't have kids,'1 [MASK] said gently, as if she were reading her thoughts. "But you're young. You'll get married again. How old were you when you got married anyway?" "Seventeen.
<name>he</name>	he	Tommy	It was hard to believe that she would wake up at any moment, giggling and laughing, and yet he wanted to believe that that could still happen. "How did she get so sick so fast? She was fine last night," [MASK] said, looking shocked and confused.
<name>Janine</name>	Janine	Liz	"You mean the delivery?" He sounded surprised, [MASK] had never complained much about childbirth. "No, 1 mean giving the baby up. That won't be easy." He nodded, sorry for her.
<name>Ms. Johnson</name>	Ms. Johnson	Liz	It was her day off, and she had even helped [MASK] correct some simple sophomore papers. "My mom never went to college. I think she should have. She loves to read, loves to learn about things.
<name>the baby</name>	the baby	Julie	They had all made her promise to call and tell them what sex the baby was, and she had said she would. And knowing that she had lied to all of them made it all the harder to say goodbye, especially to [MASK].
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Liz	"I love you, [MASK]," he whispered into her neck, as she felt her desire for him mount, and his hands run smoothly over her naked shoulders to her waiting breasts and his lips came down on hers firmly.
<name>the protagonist</name>	the protagonist	Tommy	Both hated themselves for having made love while she slipped into a coma in her bed. And [MASK] was unsure why he felt that way, but he blamed himself for her death too. He should have been able to make a difference. But none of them had.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	David	It felt good just to be there, away from all of them, [MASK], the kids in her class, and the ones she didn't know, the ones drinking and throwing up. It felt good to be away from her parents too.
<name>him</name>	him	Tommy	I know ... 1 lost my sister when I was twenty-one, and she was fifteen ... it stinks ... it really stinks. Just hang on to the memories . . . she was a cute little thing," he said, crying along with [MASK].
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Maribeth	[MASK] seemed to be hesitating as she stood there and waited. "1 was wondering if ... I ... I saw the sign ... I was wondering about the job. 1 mean . . ." "You mean you want work," the other woman smiled. "
