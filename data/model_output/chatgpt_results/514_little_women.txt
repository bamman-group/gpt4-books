<name>Madame Bovary</name>	Madame Bovary	Jo	No, you won't. You hate hard work, and you'll marry some rich man, and come home to sit in the lap of luxury all your days," said [MASK]. "Your predictions sometimes come to pass, but I don't believe that one will.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jo	Please don't!" "I will, and you must hear me. It's no use, [MASK], we've got to have it out, and the sooner the better for both of us," he answered, getting flushed and excited all at once.
<name>Lily</name>	Lily	Meg	"I've got my new pink silk for Thursday and don't want a thing." "Nor I..." began [MASK], but stopped because it occurred to her that she did want several things and could not have them. "What shall you wear?"
<name>dear</name>	dear	Jo	I don't feel so forlorn, and will try to bear it if it comes." "Keep hoping for the best, that will help you, [MASK]. Soon your mother will be here, and then everything will be all right."
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Amy	They got on excellently, for [MASK]'s chief care was soon set at rest by learning that the gentleman would leave first, and she was chatting away in a peculiarly lofty strain, when the old lady got out.
<name>Mr. Knightley</name>	Mr. Knightley	Fred	You may be sure of that, and though [MASK] is not my model hero, he does very well, and in time I should get fond enough of him if he was very fond of me, and let me do just as I liked.
<name>darling</name>	darling	Jo	I came to make it up, and can't go away till I have." "It's all right. Get up, and don't be a goose, [MASK]," was the cavalier reply to her petition. "Thank you, I will.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Jo	"Indeed you should. How splendid it will be to have you doing what you like, and be able to see you often, and the boys!" cried [MASK], clinging to the lads as an excuse for the satisfaction she could not help betraying. "
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	Meg	[MASK] looked very like a rose herself, for all that was best and sweetest in heart and soul seemed to bloom into her face that day, making it fair and tender, with a charm more beautiful than beauty. Neither silk, lace, nor orange flowers would she have.
<name>Jo March</name>	Jo March	Meg	So I'll comfort myself with that, and when I'm ready, I'll up again and take another." CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT DOMESTIC EXPERIENCES Like most other young matrons, [MASK] began her married life with the determination to be a model housekeeper.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Jo	"I'm not! And if turning up my hair makes me one, I'll wear it in two tails till I'm twenty," cried [MASK], pulling off her net, and shaking down a chestnut mane.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Jo	Her father stood leaning his head on the mantelpiece and did not turn as she came in, but her mother stretched out her arms as if for help, and [MASK] went to comfort her without a word. CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN NEW IMPRESSIONS
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Laurie	I wash my hands of the dinner party, and since you have asked [MASK] on your own responsibility, you may just take care of him." "I don't want you to do anything but be civil to him and help to the pudding.
<name>Clare</name>	Clare	Amy	I thought you'd never come!" cried [MASK], dropping the reins and holding out both hands, to the great scandalization of a French mamma, who hastened her daughter's steps, lest she should be demoralized by beholding the free manners of these 'mad English'.
<name>Louisa</name>	Louisa	Jo	"Do you say she makes a good living out of stories like this?" and [MASK] looked more respectfully at the agitated group and thickly sprinkled exclamation points that adorned the page. "Guess she does! She knows just what folks like, and gets paid well for writing it."
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Meg	"Think about something pleasant, and you'll soon drop off." "I tried it, but felt wider awake than ever." "What did you think of?" "Handsome faces--eyes particularly," answered [MASK], smiling to herself in the dark.
<name>Beth</name>	Beth	Laurie	"Don't you wish for anything else?" asked [MASK]. "Since I had my little piano, I am perfectly satisfied. I only wish we may all keep well and be together, nothing else."
<name>someone</name>	someone	Sallie	She answered, "I'll take it," and it was cut off and paid for, and [MASK] had exulted, and she had laughed as if it were a thing of no consequence, and driven away, feeling as if she had stolen something, and the police were after her.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Laurie	"Do you? Shall I come?" he asked, looking down at her with an eager expression which she did not see. "Yes, come next month. [MASK] graduates then, and you'd enjoy commencement as something new." "
<name>Edgar</name>	Edgar	Laurie	It was good practice, he said, and when the beginners improved, anyone would pay. So I let him have the two stories, and today this was sent to me, and [MASK] caught me with it and insisted on seeing it, so I let him.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Jo	Poor dear, just wait till I make my fortune, and you shall revel in carriages and ice cream and high-heeled slippers, and posies, and red-headed boys to dance with." "How ridiculous you are, [MASK]!"
<name>Sara</name>	Sara	Amy	The letter went very soon, however, and was promptly answered, for [MASK] was homesick, and confessed it in the most delightfully confiding manner. The correspondence flourished famously, and letters flew to and fro with unfailing regularity all through the early spring.
<name>Aragorn</name>	Aragorn	Minna	I must go away and do my work alone. I must help my boys first, because, even for you, I may not break my word to [MASK]. Can you forgif that, and be happy while we hope and wait?"
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Laurie	A flock of our fellows are going to drive over by-and-by, and I'll be hanged if I don't make them buy every flower she's got, and camp down before her table afterward," said [MASK], espousing her cause with warmth.
<name>Beth</name>	Beth	Beth	I never made any plans about what I'd do when I grew up. I never thought of being married, as you all did. I couldn't seem to imagine myself anything but stupid little [MASK], trotting about at home, of no use anywhere but there.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Laurie	A restless movement from [MASK] suggested that his chair was not easy, or that he did not like the plan, and made the old man add hastily, "I don't mean to be a marplot or a burden.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	John	I'm rather proud of my wife's feet, and don't mind if she does pay eight or nine dollars for her boots, if they are good ones." That had been one of her last 'trifles', and [MASK]'s eye had fallen on it as he spoke.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Demi	Mornin' now," announced [MASK] in joyful tone as he entered, with his long nightgown gracefully festooned over his arm and every curl bobbing gayly as he pranced about the table, eyeing the 'cakies' with loving glances. "No, it isn't morning yet.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Laurie	[MASK] drew his hand across his eyes, but could not speak till he had subdued the choky feeling in his throat and steadied his lips. It might be unmanly, but he couldn't help it, and I am glad of it.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Meg	I'd have told my part of the scrape, if I could without bringing [MASK] in. As I couldn't, I held my tongue, and bore the scolding till the old gentleman collared me. Then I bolted, for fear I should forget myself."
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Meg	I'm proud to shake this good, industrious little hand, and hope I shall not soon be asked to give it away." If [MASK] had wanted a reward for hours of patient labor, she received it in the hearty pressure of her father's hand and the approving smile he gave her.
<name>Mr. Pickwick</name>	Mr. Pickwick	Polly	I poked it out, and it ran under the bookcase. [MASK] marched straight after it, stooped down and peeped under the bookcase, saying, in his funny way, with a cock of his eye, 'Come out and take a walk, my dear.'
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Susie	They sat still as mice, and [MASK] cried quarts, I know she did. I didn't envy her then, for I felt that millions of carnelian rings wouldn't have made me happy after that. I never, never should have got over such a agonizing mortification."
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Jo	"No, thank you. I'd rather not. I shall drop it or smash it, as sure as fate." "Then you shan't see your nevvy," said [MASK] decidedly, turning as if to go. "I will, I will!
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jo	Finding the door locked again, she left the note to do its work, and was going quietly away, when the young gentleman slid down the banisters, and waited for her at the bottom, saying, with his most virtuous expression of countenance, "What a good fellow you are, [MASK]!
<name>dear</name>	dear	Jo	I'm all at sea." "Well, don't make a porcupine of yourself, it isn't becoming. Settle your wig, [MASK], and tell me if I shall telegraph to your mother, or do anything?"
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Jo	Grief is the best opener of some hearts, and [MASK]'s was nearly ready for the bag. A little more sunshine to ripen the nut, then, not a boy's impatient shake, but a man's hand reached up to pick it gently from the burr, and find the kernal sound and sweet.
<name>Mr. Wilson</name>	Mr. Wilson	Laurie	He forgot himself still further when [MASK] said, in his most gracious manner, at parting... "My wife and I are very glad to meet you, sir. Please remember that there is always a welcome waiting for you over the way."
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Jo	and I could do as well as that if we tried," returned [MASK], amused at his admiration of the trash. "I should think I was a pretty lucky chap if I could. She makes a good living out of such stories, they say.
<name>Beth</name>	Beth	Beth	[MASK] kept on, with only slight relapses into idleness or grieving. All the little duties were faithfully done each day, and many of her sisters' also, for they were forgetful, and the house seemed like a clock whose pendulum was gone a-visiting.
<name>Laurie</name>	Laurie	Amy	returned [MASK] indignantly, for the two still jangled when such questions arose. "The girls do care for me, and I for them, and there's a great deal of kindness and sense and talent among them, in spite of what you call fashionable nonsense.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Laurie	Feeling stronger than ever to meet and subdue her Apollyon, she pinned the note inside her frock, as a shield and a reminder, lest she be taken unaware, and proceeded to open her other letter, quite ready for either good or bad news. In a big, dashing hand, [MASK] wrote...
<name>Meg</name>	Meg	Marmee	Mother is always ready to be your confidant, Father to be your friend, and both of us hope and trust that our daughters, whether married or single, will be the pride and comfort of our lives." "We will, [MASK], we will!"
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Jo	"I don't want you to do anything but be civil to him and help to the pudding. You'll give me your advice if I get in a muddle, won't you?" asked [MASK], rather hurt. "
<name>Sara</name>	Sara	Jo	"Don't go to school, I'm a businessman--girl, I mean. I go to wait on my great-aunt, and a dear, cross old soul she is, too," answered [MASK].
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Jo	[MASK], dear, we all have our temptations, some far greater than yours, and it often takes us all our lives to conquer them. You think your temper is the worst in the world, but mine used to be just like it."
<name>himself</name>	himself	Meg	He received no stars or bars, but he deserved them, for he cheerfully risked all he had, and life and love are very precious when both are in full bloom. Perfectly resigned to his discharge, he devoted himself to getting well, preparing for business, and earning a home for [MASK].
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Meg	"I didn't mean to, but you looked so funny I really couldn't help it," replied [MASK], passing over the first part of his reproach, for it was quite true that she had shunned him, remembering the Moffat party and the talk after it.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Jo	"Any more than it's proper to wear all your bonnets and gowns and ribbons at once, that folks may know you've got them," added [MASK], and the lecture ended in a laugh. CHAPTER EIGHT
<name>Aunt Alexandra</name>	Aunt Alexandra	Jo	"Bad boy, be quiet! Sit down and think of your own sins, don't go making me add to mine. If I get your grandpa to apologize for the shaking, will you give up running away?" asked [MASK] seriously. "
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Laurie	[MASK] spoke excitedly, and looked ready to carry his threat into execution on the slightest provocation, for he was growing up very fast and, in spite of his indolent ways, had a young man's hatred of subjection, a young man's restless longing to try the world for himself.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Amy	"I am sure of that. [MASK] and you never did quarrel as we used to. She is the sun and I the wind, in the fable, and the sun managed the man best, you remember.
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Laurie	"One usually does at a ball." Her amazed look and quick answer caused [MASK] to repair his error as fast as possible. "I meant the first dance. May I have the honor?" "I can give you one if I put off the Count.
<name>Meg</name>	Meg	Meg	"Well, I have a bad trick of standing before the fire, and so I burn my frocks, and I scorched this one, and though it's nicely mended, it shows, and [MASK] told me to keep still so no one would see it.
<name>Jo March</name>	Jo March	Jo	" "The good and dear people always do die," groaned [MASK], but she stopped crying, for her friend's words cheered her up in spite of her own doubts and fears. "Poor girl, you're worn out. It isn't like you to be forlorn.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Jo	If you loved me, [MASK], I should be a perfect saint, for you could make me anything you like." "No, I can't. I've tried and failed, and I won't risk our happiness by such a serious experiment.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Jo	My pretty, tender hearted girl! I hope things will go happily with her." "Hadn't you rather have her marry a rich man?" asked [MASK], as her mother's voice faltered a little over the last words.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Jo	"You are going, then?" "I haf no longer any business here, it is done." "Successfully, I hope?" said [MASK], for the bitterness of disappointment was in that short reply of his.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Meg	"No, I'm sure I can't. How much has happened since I said that! It seems a year ago," answered [MASK], who was in a blissful dream lifted far above such common things as bread and butter.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Jo	Your airs are funny now, but you'll grow up an affected little goose, if you don't take care. I like your nice manners and refined ways of speaking, when you don't try to be elegant. But your absurd words are as bad as [MASK]'s slang.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Beth	What shall I do? I don't know anything about them, thought [MASK], and forgetting the boy's misfortune in her flurry, she said, hoping to make him talk, "I never saw any hunting, but I suppose you know all about it."
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Jo	[MASK] sat still, looking as if the fire had come to her, for her cheeks burned long after the cocked hat had turned to smoke and gone harmlessly up the chimney. "I should like much to send all the rest after him," muttered the Professor, coming back with a relieved air.
<name>Sara</name>	Sara	Jo	[MASK] remembered the kind old gentleman, who used to let her build railroads and bridges with his big dictionaries, tell her stories about queer pictures in his Latin books, and buy her cards of gingerbread whenever he met her in the street.
<name>Louisa</name>	Louisa	Meg	"It isn't made or trimmed," sighed [MASK], faintly, for a sudden recollection of the cost still to be incurred quite overwhelmed her. "Twenty-five yards of silk seems a good deal to cover one small woman,
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Amy	She missed her mother's help to understand and rule herself, but having been taught where to look, she did her best to find the way and walk in it confidingly. But, [MASK] was a young pilgrim, and just now her burden seemed very heavy.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Meg	"Begin to do something now by not plaguing his life out," said [MASK] sharply. "How do you know I do, Miss?" "I can always tell by his face when he goes away. If you have been good, he looks satisfied and walks briskly.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Marmee	Merry Christmas, [MASK]! Many of them! Thank you for our books. We read some, and mean to every day," they all cried in chorus. "Merry Christmas, little daughters! I'm glad you began at once, and hope you will keep on.
<name>Tess</name>	Tess	Meg	I won't see him, and you two can laugh at me and my jelly as much as you like. You won't have anything else here." and having delivered her defiance all on one breath, [MASK] cast away her pinafore and precipitately left the field to bemoan herself in her own room.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Jo	You know it's impossible for people to make themselves love other people if they don't," cried [MASK] inelegantly but remorsefully, as she softly patted his shoulder, remembering the time when he had comforted her so long ago.
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Laurie	Out upon you, fie upon you, Bold-faced jig!" It was impossible to help laughing at the funny conflict between [MASK]'s chivalrous reluctance to speak ill of womankind, and his very natural dislike of the unfeminine folly of which fashionable society showed him many samples.
<name>Laurie</name>	Laurie	Meg	She could not roam about and amuse herself, for the burned breadth would show, so she stared at people rather forlornly till the dancing began. [MASK] was asked at once, and the tight slippers tripped about so briskly that none would have guessed the pain their wearer suffered smilingly.
<name>Dick</name>	Dick	Brooke	[MASK] couldn't understand why your mother was so kind to him, asking him over with me and treating him in her beautiful friendly way. He thought she was just perfect, and talked about it for days and days, and went on about you all in flaming style.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Meg	Thank you very, very much!" [MASK] spoke earnestly, and forgot herself entirely till something in the brown eyes looking down at her made her remember the cooling tea, and lead the way into the parlor, saying she would call her mother.
<name>unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Meg	I needn't, it's too soon and I'd rather not." "Mayn't I hope you'll change your mind by-and-by? I'll wait and say nothing till you have had more time. Don't play with me, [MASK].
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Amy	He tried to resume his former easy, indifferent air, but it was an affectation now, for the rousing had been more effacious than he would confess. [MASK] felt the shade of coldness in his manner, and said to herself... "Now, I've offended him.
<name>Meg</name>	Meg	Jo	As twilight fell, dewy and still, one by one they gathered on the porch where the June roses were budding beautifully, and each groaned or sighed as she sat down, as if tired or troubled. "What a dreadful day this has been!" began [MASK], usually the first to speak.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Jo	She hes the liking for it, and gits the hang of things surprisin quick. [MASK] doos beat all for goin ahead, but she don't stop to cal'k'late fust, and you never know where she's like to bring up.
<name>Mr. Brooke</name>	Mr. Brooke	Jo	But he exulted in private and longed for the time to come when he could give [MASK] a piece of plate, with a bear and a ragged staff on it as an appropriate coat of arms. For a fortnight, the Professor came and went with lover-like regularity.
<name>Cyril</name>	Cyril	Petrea	It was not big nor red, like poor '[MASK]'s', it was only rather flat, and all the pinching in the world could not give it an aristocratic point. No one minded it but herself,
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Jo	She beckoned, and [MASK] reluctantly followed her into a side room, where she found her on a sofa, holding her foot, and looking pale. "I've sprained my ankle. That stupid high heel turned and gave me a sad wrench.
<name>child</name>	child	Meg	No toys in this first chest remain, For all are carried away, In their old age, to join again In another small [MASK]'s play. Ah, happy mother! Well I know You hear, like a sweet refrain, Lullabies ever soft and low
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Laurie	You'll see that I'm right, by-and-by, and thank me for it..." she began solemnly. "I'll be hanged if I do!" and [MASK] bounced up off the grass, burning with indignation at the very idea.
<name>Persephone</name>	Persephone	Jo	She wondered still more if her sister really guessed the hard truth, and what thoughts were passing through her mind during the long hours when she lay on the warm rocks with her head in [MASK]'s lap, while the winds blew healthfully over her and the sea made music at her feet.
<name>the Professor</name>	the Professor	Jo	It never was a fashionable school, and the Professor did not lay up a fortune, but it was just what [MASK] intended it to be--'a happy, homelike place for boys, who needed teaching, care, and kindness'. Every room in the big house was soon full.
<name>Fritz</name>	Fritz	Fritz	"Boys. I want to open a school for little lads--a good, happy, homelike school, with me to take care of them and [MASK] to teach them." "That's a truly Joian plan for you! Isn't that just like her?
<name>her father</name>	her father	Jo	She could not say, "I'm glad to go," for life was very sweet for her. She could only sob out, "I try to be willing," while she held fast to [MASK], as the first bitter wave of this great sorrow broke over them together.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Jo	Just fancy how horrid!--and led her to the recitation platform, and made her stand there half an hour, holding the slate so everyone could see." "Didn't the girls laugh at the picture?" asked [MASK], who relished the scrape. "Laugh?
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Amy	[MASK] was in her element now, and out of gratitude, if nothing more, was as spritely and gracious as possible, coming to the conclusion, about that time, that virtue was its own reward, after all.
<name>Georgia</name>	Georgia	Amy	From fire to oil was a natural transition for burned fingers, and [MASK] fell to painting with undiminished ardor. An artist friend fitted her out with his castoff palettes, brushes, and colors, and she daubed away, producing pastoral and marine views such as were never seen on land or sea.
<name>Jack's</name>	Jack's	Jo	I thought there was something in the dimple that didn't quite suit you. Not being a dog in the manger, but the happiest fellow alive, I assure you I can dance at [MASK]'s wedding with a heart as light as my heels.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Jo	The commander in chief and his aides soon spread the tablecloth with an inviting array of eatables and drinkables, prettily decorated with green leaves. [MASK] announced that the coffee was ready, and everyone settled themselves to a hearty meal, for youth is seldom dyspeptic, and exercise develops wholesome appetites.
<name>Fred</name>	Fred	Laurie	Well, he was a great man, and when he couldn't have one sister he took the other, and was happy." [MASK] did not utter the words, but he thought them, and the next instant kissed the little old ring, saying to himself, "No, I won't!
<name>he</name>	he	John	It was dreadful, and the worst of it was [MASK] went on so quietly afterward, just as if nothing had happened, except that he stayed in town later, and worked at night when she had gone to cry herself to sleep.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	John	She ran to him and held him close, crying, with repentant tears, "Oh, [MASK], my dear, kind, hard-working boy. I didn't mean it! It was so wicked, so untrue and ungrateful, how could I say it!
<name>Beth</name>	Beth	Jo	You've behaved sweetly, and I respect you with all my heart," said [MASK] warmly, as they brushed their hair together late that night. "Yes, we all do, and love her for being so ready to forgive.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Jo	said [MASK], with a sudden change from perversity to lamblike submission. "You're a perfect cherub! Now put on all your best things, and I'll tell you how to behave at each place, so that you will make a good impression.
<name>Mrs. Gardiner</name>	Mrs. Gardiner	Jo	It does my heart good to see them forget business and frolic for a day," answered [MASK], who now spoke in a maternal way of all mankind. "Yes, I remember, but the life I wanted then seems selfish, lonely, and cold to me now.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Jo	She started when spoken to, blushed when looked at, was very quiet, and sat over her sewing, with a timid, troubled look on her face. To her mother's inquiries she answered that she was quite well, and [MASK]'s she silenced by begging to be let alone.
<name>Marmee</name>	Marmee	Amy	"I know what I mean, and you needn't be statirical about it. It's proper to use good words, and improve your vocabilary," returned [MASK], with dignity. "Don't peck at one another, children. Don't you wish we had the money
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Meg	"Could you spare me some of your cake? I really need some, I have so much company, and I can't make such delicious stuff as yours," asked [MASK] soberly. "Take it all.
