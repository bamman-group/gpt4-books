<name>Chichikov</name>	Chichikov	Satan	[MASK] dropped it there, I take it, intending a scurrilous jest against your reverence. But, indeed, he was blind and foolish, as he ever and always is. A pure hand needs no glove to cover it!"
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	Hopefully, but a moment ago, as [MASK] had spoken of drowning it in the deep sea, there was a sense of inevitable doom upon her as she thus received back this deadly symbol from the hand of fate. She had flung it into infinite space!
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	I know thee, [MASK], for I behold the token. We may all see it in the sunshine! and it glows like a red flame in the dark. Thou wearest it openly, so there need be no question about that. But this minister!
<name>Providence</name>	Providence	Providence	"Better to fast and pray upon it; and still better, it may be, to leave the mystery as we find it, unless [MASK] reveal it of its own accord. Thereby, every good Christian man hath a title to show a father's kindness towards the poor, deserted babe."
<name>Pearl</name>	Pearl	Pearl	Nor did she put the question altogether idly, but, for the moment, with a portion of genuine earnestness; for, such was [MASK]'s wonderful intelligence, that her mother half doubted whether she were not acquainted with the secret spell of her existence, and might not now reveal herself.
<name>Pearl</name>	Pearl	Pearl	The child bent her chin upon her breast, and contemplated this device with strange interest, even as if the one only thing for which she had been sent into the world was to make out its hidden import. "I wonder if mother will ask me what it means?" thought [MASK].
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	Little accustomed, in her long seclusion from society, to measure her ideas of right and wrong by any standard external to herself, [MASK] saw--or seemed to see--that there lay a responsibility upon her in reference to the clergyman, which she owned to no other, nor to the whole world besides.
<name>Dupin</name>	Dupin	Hester	The minister had inquired of [MASK], with no little interest, the precise time at which the vessel might be expected to depart. It would probably be on the fourth day from the present. "This is most fortunate!" he had then said to himself.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	she repeated, over and over again. "Wilt thou not frown? Wilt thou forgive?" "I do forgive you, [MASK]," replied the minister at length, with a deep utterance, out of an abyss of sadness, but no anger.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	It was the last expression of the despondency of a broken spirit. He lacked energy to grasp the better fortune that seemed within his reach. He repeated the word--"Alone, [MASK]!" "Thou shall not go alone!" answered she, in a deep whisper.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	So the minister had not fallen asleep and dreamed! In order to free his mind from this indistinctness and duplicity of impression, which vexed it with a strange disquietude, he recalled and more thoroughly defined the plans which [MASK] and himself had sketched for their departure.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	and here again was the scarlet misery glittering on the old spot! So it ever is, whether thus typified or no, that an evil deed invests itself with the character of doom. [MASK] next gathered up the heavy tresses of her hair and confined them beneath her cap.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	It was debated whether or no, with safety to the commonweal, yonder scarlet letter might be taken off your bosom. On my life, [MASK], I made my intreaty to the worshipful magistrate that it might be done forthwith."
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	Her nature appeared to possess depth, too, as well as variety; but--or else [MASK]'s fears deceived her--it lacked reference and adaptation to the world into which she was born. The child could not be made amenable to rules.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Hester	Wilt thou give up that only privilege? Wilt thou reject that priceless benefit?" "Peace, [MASK]--peace!" replied the old man, with gloomy sternness--"it is not granted me to pardon. I have no such power as thou tellest me of.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	My home is where thou art and where he is. But betray me not!" "Wherefore dost thou desire it?" inquired [MASK], shrinking, she hardly knew why, from this secret bond. "Why not announce thyself openly, and cast me off at once?"
<name>Pearl</name>	Pearl	Pearl	Else I must come to thee!" But [MASK], not a whit startled at her mother's threats any more than mollified by her entreaties, now suddenly burst into a fit of passion, gesticulating violently, and throwing her small figure into the most extravagant contortions.
<name>Chillingworth</name>	Chillingworth	Pearl	Weeks, it is true, would sometimes elapse, during which [MASK]'s gaze might never once be fixed upon the scarlet letter; but then, again, it would come at unawares, like the stroke of sudden death, and always with that peculiar smile and odd expression of the eyes.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	The child turned her eyes to the point indicated, and there lay the scarlet letter so close upon the margin of the stream that the gold embroidery was reflected in it. "Bring it hither!" said [MASK]. "Come thou and take it up!"
<name>Pearl</name>	Pearl	Pearl	Hereupon, [MASK] broke away from her mother, and, running to the brook, stooped over it, and bathed her forehead, until the unwelcome kiss was quite washed off and diffused through a long lapse of the gliding water.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	In such emergencies [MASK]'s nature showed itself warm and rich--a well-spring of human tenderness, unfailing to every real demand, and inexhaustible by the largest. Her breast, with its badge of shame, was but the softer pillow for the head that needed one.
<name>Pearl</name>	Pearl	Pearl	In the afternoon of a certain summer's day, after [MASK] grew big enough to run about, she amused herself with gathering handfuls of wild flowers, and flinging them, one by one, at her mother's bosom; dancing up and down like a little elf whenever she hit the scarlet letter.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	"[MASK]," said the clergyman, "farewell!" "Shall we not meet again?" whispered she, bending her face down close to his. "Shall we not spend our immortal life together? Surely, surely, we have ransomed one another, with all this woe!
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	Let him live! Let him hide himself in outward honour, if he may! Not the less he shall be mine!" "Thy acts are like mercy," said [MASK], bewildered and appalled; "but thy words interpret thee as a terror!"
<name>Pearl</name>	Pearl	Pearl	And [MASK], overhearing the ejaculation, or aware through some more subtile channel, of those throbs of anguish, would turn her vivid and beautiful little face upon her mother, smile with sprite-like intelligence, and resume her play.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	The minister's own will, and [MASK]'s will, and the fate that grew between them, had wrought this transformation. It was the same town as heretofore, but the same minister returned not from the forest.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	"It lies not in the pleasure of the magistrates to take off the badge," calmly replied [MASK]. "Were I worthy to be quit of it, it would fall away of its own nature, or be transformed into something that should speak a different purport."
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	Not improbably he had never before viewed himself as he did now. "Hast thou not tortured him enough?" said [MASK], noticing the old man's look. "Has he not paid thee all?" "No, no! He has but increased the debt!"
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	At last, her shot being all expended, the child stood still and gazed at [MASK], with that little laughing image of a fiend peeping out--or, whether it peeped or no, her mother so imagined it--from the unsearchable abyss of her black eyes.
<name>Perdita</name>	Perdita	Pearl	"I have a strange fancy," observed the sensitive minister, "that this brook is the boundary between two worlds, and that thou canst never meet thy [MASK] again. Or is she an elfish spirit, who, as the legends of our childhood taught us, is forbidden to cross a running stream?
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	Why does he do so, mother?" "He remembers thee a little babe, my child," answered [MASK]. "He should not nod and smile at me, for all that--the black, grim, ugly-eyed old man!"
<name>Legrand</name>	Legrand	Hester	"Never know him! Believe me, [MASK], there are few things whether in the outward world, or, to a certain depth, in the invisible sphere of thought--few things hidden from the man who devotes himself earnestly and unreservedly to the solution of a mystery.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	Pray hasten her, for this delay has already imparted a tremor to my nerves." "Come, dearest child!" said [MASK] encouragingly, and stretching out both her arms. "How slow thou art! When hast thou been so sluggish before now?
<name>Pearl</name>	Pearl	Pearl	But then--by a kind of necessity that always impelled this child to alloy whatever comfort she might chance to give with a throb of anguish--[MASK] put up her mouth and kissed the scarlet letter, too. "
<name>Wamba</name>	Wamba	Pearl	"If the message pleases me, I will," answered [MASK]. "Then tell her," rejoined he, "that I spake again with the black-a-visaged, hump shouldered old doctor, and he engages to bring his friend, the gentleman she wots of, aboard with him.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	Lonely as was [MASK]'s situation, and without a friend on earth who dared to show himself, she, however, incurred no risk of want. She possessed an art that sufficed, even in a land that afforded comparatively little scope for its exercise, to supply food for her thriving infant and herself.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Pearl	[MASK] punishes me, too! See ye not, she is the scarlet letter, only capable of being loved, and so endowed with a millionfold the power of retribution for my sin? Ye shall not take her! I will die first!"
<name>Priscilla</name>	Priscilla	Pearl	One afternoon, walking with [MASK] in a retired part of the peninsula, she beheld the old physician with a basket on one arm and a staff in the other hand, stooping along the ground in quest of roots and herbs to concoct his medicine withal. XIV.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	Methought--oh, [MASK], what a thought is that, and how terrible to dread it!--that my own features were partly repeated in her face, and so strikingly that the world might see them! But she is mostly thine!" "No, no! Not mostly!
<name>Beatrice</name>	Beatrice	Pearl	At home, within and around her mother's cottage, [MASK] wanted not a wide and various circle of acquaintance. The spell of life went forth from her ever-creative spirit, and communicated itself to a thousand objects, as a torch kindles a flame wherever it may be applied.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	The exception indicated the ever relentless vigour with which society frowned upon her sin. [MASK] sought not to acquire anything beyond a subsistence, of the plainest and most ascetic description, for herself, and a simple abundance for her child.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	"I see what ails the child," whispered [MASK] to the clergyman, and turning pale in spite of a strong effort to conceal her trouble and annoyance, "Children will not abide any, the slightest, change in the accustomed aspect of things that are daily before their eyes.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	[MASK] could not but ask herself whether there had not originally been a defect of truth, courage, and loyalty on her own part, in allowing the minister to be thrown into a position where so much evil was to be foreboded and nothing auspicious to be hoped.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	it?--still	Its result, on earth, could hardly fail to be insanity, and hereafter, that eternal alienation from the Good and True, of which madness is perhaps the earthly type. Such was the ruin to which she had brought the man, once--nay, why should we not speak [MASK] so passionately loved!
<name>Providence</name>	Providence	Providence	It was, indeed, a majestic idea that the destiny of nations should be revealed, in these awful hieroglyphics, on the cope of heaven. A scroll so wide might not be deemed too expensive for [MASK] to write a people's doom upon.
<name>Pearl</name>	Pearl	Pearl	But then the elf-child sighed, and gave up her sport, because it grieved her to have done harm to a little being that was as wild as the sea-breeze, or as wild as [MASK] herself.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	XV	It is our fate. Let the black flower blossom as it may! Now, go thy ways, and deal as thou wilt with yonder man." He waved his hand, and betook himself again to his employment of gathering herbs. [MASK].
<name>Pearl</name>	Pearl	Pearl	The pine-trees, aged, black, and solemn, and flinging groans and other melancholy utterances on the breeze, needed little transformation to figure as Puritan elders; the ugliest weeds of the garden were their children, whom [MASK] smote down and uprooted most unmercifully.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	Must I sink down there, and die at once?" "Alas! what a ruin has befallen thee!" said [MASK], with the tears gushing into her eyes. "Wilt thou die for very weakness? There is no other cause!"
<name>Matilda</name>	Matilda	Pearl	But [MASK], who was a dauntless child, after frowning, stamping her foot, and shaking her little hand with a variety of threatening gestures, suddenly made a rush at the knot of her enemies, and put them all to flight.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	XX	And the melancholy brook would add this other tale to the mystery with which its little heart was already overburdened, and whereof it still kept up a murmuring babble, with not a whit more cheerfulness of tone than for ages heretofore. [MASK]. THE MINISTER IN A MAZE
<name>Robin</name>	Robin	Satan	"And, since [MASK] saw fit to steal it, your reverence must needs handle him without gloves henceforward," remarked the old sexton, grimly smiling. "But did your reverence hear of the portent that was seen last night?
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	In this little lonesome dwelling, with some slender means that she possessed, and by the licence of the magistrates, who still kept an inquisitorial watch over her, [MASK] established herself, with her infant child. A mystic shadow of suspicion immediately attached itself to the spot.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	The thought occurred to [MASK], that the child might really be seeking to approach her with childlike confidence, and doing what she could, and as intelligently as she knew how, to establish a meeting-point of sympathy.
<name>Una</name>	Una	Pearl	And [MASK], stepping in mid-leg deep, beheld her own white feet at the bottom; while, out of a still lower depth, came the gleam of a kind of fragmentary smile, floating to and fro in the agitated water.
<name>Pearl</name>	Pearl	Pearl	answered the child. But while she said it, [MASK] laughed, and began to dance up and down with the humoursome gesticulation of a little imp, whose next freak might be to fly up the chimney. "Art thou my child, in very truth?"
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	He turned towards the scaffold, and stretched forth his arms. "[MASK]," said he, "come hither! Come, my little Pearl!" It was a ghastly look with which he regarded them; but there was something at once tender and strangely triumphant in it.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	Yes, I hate him!" repeated [MASK] more bitterly than before. "He betrayed me! He has done me worse wrong than I did him!" Let men tremble to win the hand of woman, unless they win along with it the utmost passion of her heart!
<name>Pearl</name>	Pearl	Prithee	But that was in the old land. [MASK], young one, who art thou, and what has ailed thy mother to bedizen thee in this strange fashion? Art thou a Christian child--ha? Dost know thy catechism?
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	Shouldst thou fail me in this, beware! His fame, his position, his life will be in my hands. Beware!" "I will keep thy secret, as I have his," said [MASK]. "Swear it!" rejoined he.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	Over and over again, the tempter of souls had thrust this idea upon [MASK]'s contemplation, and laughed at the passionate and desperate joy with which she seized, and then strove to cast it from her. She barely looked the idea in the face, and hastened to bar it in its dungeon.
<name>Pearl</name>	Pearl	Pearl	With these she decorated her hair and her young waist, and became a nymph child, or an infant dryad, or whatever else was in closest sympathy with the antique wood. In such guise had [MASK] adorned herself, when she heard her mother's voice, and came slowly back.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Pearl	[MASK]!" "I see the child," observed the minister. "Yonder she is, standing in a streak of sunshine, a good way off, on the other side of the brook. So thou thinkest the child will love me?"
<name>Pearl</name>	Pearl	Pearl	"Oh, brook! Oh, foolish and tiresome little brook!" cried [MASK], after listening awhile to its talk, "Why art thou so sad? Pluck up a spirit, and do not be all the time sighing and murmuring!"
<name>Gerda</name>	Gerda	Pearl	"Come along, [MASK]," said she, drawing her away, "Come and look into this fair garden. It may be we shall see flowers there; more beautiful ones than we find in the woods."
<name>Pearl</name>	Pearl	Pearl	And there was [MASK], too, lightly dancing from the margin of the brook--now that the intrusive third person was gone--and taking her old place by her mother's side. So the minister had not fallen asleep and dreamed!
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	"I have greatly wronged thee," murmured [MASK]. "We have wronged each other," answered he. "Mine was the first wrong, when I betrayed thy budding youth into a false and unnatural relation with my decay.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	"Thou knowest," said [MASK]--for, depressed as she was, she could not endure this last quiet stab at the token of her shame--"thou knowest that I was frank with thee. I felt no love, nor feigned any." "True," replied he.
<name>Satan</name>	Satan	Satan	Verily, the woman hath been like a possessed one; and there lacks little that I should take in hand, to drive [MASK] out of her with stripes." The stranger had entered the room with the characteristic quietude of the profession to which he announced himself as belonging.
<name>Pearl</name>	Pearl	Pearl	The unlikeliest materials--a stick, a bunch of rags, a flower--were the puppets of [MASK]'s witchcraft, and, without undergoing any outward change, became spiritually adapted to whatever drama occupied the stage of her inner world.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	And the shame!--the indelicacy!--the horrible ugliness of this exposure of a sick and guilty heart to the very eye that would gloat over it! Woman, woman, thou art accountable for this!--I cannot forgive thee!" "Thou shalt forgive me!" cried [MASK], flinging herself on the fallen leaves beside him.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	When strangers looked curiously at the scarlet letter--and none ever failed to do so--they branded it afresh in [MASK]'s soul; so that, oftentimes, she could scarcely refrain, yet always did refrain, from covering the symbol with her hand.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Pearl	Forth peeped at her, out of the pool, with dark, glistening curls around her head, and an elf-smile in her eyes, the image of a little maid whom [MASK], having no other playmate, invited to take her hand and run a race with her.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	"Wilt thou come across the brook, and own thy mother, now that she has her shame upon her--now that she is sad?" "Yes; now I will!" answered the child, bounding across the brook, and clasping [MASK] in her arms "Now thou art my mother indeed!
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	Stand you here, and let me run and catch it. I am but a child. It will not flee from me--for I wear nothing on my bosom yet!" "Nor ever will, my child, I hope," said [MASK]. "
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	To say the truth, there was much need of professional assistance, not merely for [MASK] herself, but still more urgently for the child--who, drawing its sustenance from the maternal bosom, seemed to have drank in with it all the turmoil, the anguish and despair, which pervaded the mother's system.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	"It is for the same reason that the minister keeps his hand over his heart!" "And what reason is that?" asked [MASK], half smiling at the absurd incongruity of the child's observation; but on second thoughts turning pale. "
<name>Pearl</name>	Pearl	Pearl	He did not send me!" cried she, positively. "I have no Heavenly Father!" "Hush, [MASK], hush! Thou must not talk so!" answered the mother, suppressing a groan. "He sent us all into the world.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	I dare not quit my post, though an unfaithful sentinel, whose sure reward is death and dishonour, when his dreary watch shall come to an end!" "Thou art crushed under this seven years' weight of misery," replied [MASK], fervently resolved to buoy him up with her own energy.
<name>Dimmesdale</name>	Dimmesdale	Hester	Canst thou deem it, [MASK], a consolation that I must stand up in my pulpit, and meet so many eyes turned upward to my face, as if the light of heaven were beaming from it!--must see my flock hungry for the truth, and listening to my words as if a tongue of Pentecost were
<name>Ramona</name>	Ramona	Hester	Even the Indians were affected by a sort of cold shadow of the white man's curiosity and, gliding through the crowd, fastened their snake-like black eyes on [MASK]'s bosom, conceiving, perhaps, that the wearer of this brilliantly embroidered badge must needs be a personage of high dignity among her people.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	Will he continue, then, to keep our secret? What will now be the course of his revenge?" "There is a strange secrecy in his nature," replied [MASK], thoughtfully; "and it has grown upon him by the hidden practices of his revenge.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	and why does the minister keep his hand over his heart?" "What shall I say?" thought [MASK] to herself. "No! if this be the price of the child's sympathy, I cannot pay it." Then she spoke aloud--
<name>Pearl</name>	Pearl	Pearl	cried [MASK], with a naughty smile. "If thou callest me that ill-name, I shall tell him of thee, and he will chase thy ship with a tempest!" Pursuing a zigzag course across the marketplace, the child returned to her mother, and communicated what the mariner had said.
<name>Pearl</name>	Pearl	Pearl	The light lingered about the lonely child, as if glad of such a playmate, until her mother had drawn almost nigh enough to step into the magic circle too. "It will go now," said [MASK], shaking her head. "See!"
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	"Thou must dwell no longer with this man," said [MASK], slowly and firmly. "Thy heart must be no longer under his evil eye!" "It were far worse than death!" replied the minister. "But how to avoid it?
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	inquired [MASK]. "Yea, forsooth," replied the bond-servant, staring with wide-open eyes at the scarlet letter, which, being a new-comer in the country, he had never before seen. "Yea, his honourable worship is within.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	There had been a period when [MASK] was less alive to this consideration; or, perhaps, in the misanthropy of her own trouble, she left the minister to bear what she might picture to herself as a more tolerable doom.
<name>Pearl</name>	Pearl	Hester	" asked [MASK]. "Not that I remember," said the child. "If thou fearest to leave me in our cottage, thou mightest take me along with thee. I would very gladly go! But, mother, tell me now!
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	"Never, never!" whispered she. "What we did had a consecration of its own. We felt it so! We said so to each other. Hast thou forgotten it?" "Hush, [MASK]!
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Hester	Thou to whom I dare not lift mine eyes, wilt Thou yet pardon me?" "Thou wilt go!" said [MASK] calmly, as he met her glance. The decision once made, a glow of strange enjoyment threw its flickering brightness over the trouble of his breast.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	At that epoch of pristine simplicity, however, matters of even slighter public interest, and of far less intrinsic weight than the welfare of [MASK] and her child, were strangely mixed up with the deliberations of legislators and acts of state.
<name>Pearl</name>	Pearl	Pearl	This phantasy was probably suggested by the near proximity of the Governor's red roses, as [MASK] stood outside of the window, together with her recollection of the prison rose-bush, which she had passed in coming hither.
<name>Satan</name>	Satan	Satan	speaking!--and then look inward, and discern the black reality of what they idolise? I have laughed, in bitterness and agony of heart, at the contrast between what I seem and what I am! And [MASK] laughs at it!"
<name>Annie</name>	Annie	Pearl	Little [MASK], who was as greatly pleased with the gleaming armour as she had been with the glittering frontispiece of the house, spent some time looking into the polished mirror of the breastplate. "Mother," cried she, "I see you here.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	Nor were it an inconsistency too improbable to be assigned to human nature, should we suppose a feeling of regret in [MASK]'s mind, at the moment when she was about to win her freedom from the pain which had been thus deeply incorporated with her being.
<name>Pearl</name>	Pearl	Hester	Taking a handful of these, she arranged them along the lines of the scarlet letter that decorated the maternal bosom, to which the burrs, as their nature was, tenaciously adhered. [MASK] did not pluck them off.
<name>Satan</name>	Satan	Satan	And may she feel, too--what, methinks, is the very truth--that this boon was meant, above all things else, to keep the mother's soul alive, and to preserve her from blacker depths of sin into which [MASK] might else have sought to plunge her!
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hester	Lo, the scarlet letter which [MASK] wears! Ye have all shuddered at it! Wherever her walk hath been--wherever, so miserably burdened, she may have hoped to find repose--it hath cast a lurid gleam of awe and horrible repugnance round about her.
<name>Pearl</name>	Pearl	Pearl	"For the Governor and the magistrates are to go by, and the ministers, and all the great people and good people, with the music and the soldiers marching before them." "And will the minister be there?" asked [MASK]. "
