<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Johnnie’d	It was one of those little four-bit voice recordings, like you’ve just about got time to sneeze on before it’s used up. [MASK] sent it to his folks the time he visited the Dallas Fair.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Joyce	Buy you some kind of business; you and [MASK] can run it together. When it’s going good, get in touch with your dad. He’ll see that you’ve made a darned smart move, and you won’t have any trouble squaring things.”
<name>Cherry</name>	Cherry	Joyce	I’d started crapping out of pure fright. And, now, here I was— I poured another drink_ — Here I was, now, but it wouldn’t be like this much longer. [MASK] was bound to die if she wasn’t dead already.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Johnnie	“Yes, [MASK].” It was a statement, not a question. “Y-you m-mean I — I should take the rap for you? I —” “No,” I said. “Yes.”
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Bob	He wasn’t exactly right about that, but I knew what he meant. There was other work I’d have liked a lot better. “I don’t know, [MASK],” I said, “there’s a couple of kinds of laziness.
<name>Godot</name>	Godot	Amy	Why’d they all have to come to me to get killed? Why couldn’t they kill themselves? I cleaned up the broken dishes in the office. I went upstairs and lay down and waited for [MASK]. I didn’t have long to wait.
<name>Rocky</name>	Rocky	Rah	You’re gonna smile, boy, you’re gonna show ’em the of fightin’ smile. And then you’re gonna get out there an’ hit ’em hard and fast and low, an’—an’ Fight!” [MASK].
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Lou	“Yeah...” He shifted his cigarette from one side of his mouth to the other. He pushed it across with his tongue, his eyes narrowed on my face. “But the money, [MASK]. That still doesn’t explain about the money.”
<name>Claire</name>	Claire	Lou	I—I didn’t hurt—” He laid a hand on my arm. “You need not tell me that, [MASK]. I do not know why—what—but—” “He felt lost,” I said.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Joe	I reckon not,” I said. “I guess I don’t know what you’re driving at, [MASK].” “Let it go. It’s not really relevant.” “I suppose the boys don’t have it too easy,” I said.
<name>Sugar</name>	Sugar	Lou	“What are you thinking about, darling?” “Well, I was thinking we’ve always had to do kinda like people expected us to. I mean—Well, what were you thinking about?” “You tell me first, [MASK].”
<name>Amir</name>	Amir	Max	“I aimed to be his friend,” I said. “There weren’t many things I wanted much more. Somehow, I slipped up; I couldn’t help him right when he needed help worst. But I want you to know one thing, [MASK].
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Joyce	I started the motor and killed it. I started it and killed it again. Finally, it stayed running, it just wouldn’t die, so I drove off. I drove up the lane to [MASK]’s house and parked at the end of it.
<name>partner</name>	partner	Howard	For a while, anyway, it wasn’t a good idea to have anyone sore at me. And a guy that’s got something on his conscience can’t afford to get riled. “I guess were a pretty stiff-necked lot out here, [MASK],” I said.
<name>Danny</name>	Danny	Howard	He glared at me, redfaced, in the rearview mirror. “I’ve got quite a few more questions. And I’m still waiting for the answer to the last one I asked. Who was the—” “Drop it, [MASK]!”
<name>me</name>	me	Joyce	The stories had been more than fair to me, but it hadn’t cost ’em anything; they had to fill space some way. And I didn’t care too much about a number of the details; what they said about [MASK], for example.
<name>her</name>	her	Amy	I’d never had any control even before I met her. No control — only luck. Because anyone who reminded me of the burden I carried, anyone who did what that first her had done, would get killed_ Anyone. [MASK].
<name>who</name>	who	Howard	I mean, I’d have prosecuted her to the hilt.” He was leaning backwards to be friendly since our brush the day before. I was his old pal, and he was letting me know his innermost feelings. “I wonder, [MASK]...”
<name>her</name>	her	Mike	It would have been bad enough if I hadn’t known what he’d done to [MASK]. I kept my hands in my pockets, pretending like I didn’t see him when he started to shake hands. He opened the screen, then hesitated a moment.
<name>The Chief</name>	The Chief	Conway	We could have her pinched, of course, but she was bound to talk if we did and it wouldn’t be pretty talk. [MASK] nodded irritably. “Understand all that. Can’t have a lot of dirty publicity.
<name>probably</name> (There is no proper name that fits in this context, so "probably" is a guess based on the surrounding dialogue.)	probably (There is no proper name that fits in this context, so "probably" is a guess based on the surrounding dialogue.)	Johnnie	“That’s all right,” I said. “Don’t worry about it.” “Are we—uh—can I —?” “In just a little,” I said. “You’ll be leaving in a few minutes, [MASK].
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Lou	He did a terrible thing like that—made you so we can never have children—just because he thought something! Why, it’s terrible! It makes me sick!... When was it, [MASK]?” “What’s the difference?” I said.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Johnnie	Are you catching cold?” I bit down on my cigar. I didn’t say anything. “These lads equipped themselves with a couple of piss-elm clubs, or reasonable facsimiles thereof, and went calling on [MASK].
<name>him</name>	him	Elmer	No matter what you did it wouldn’t be enough, it wouldn’t bring [MASK] back. An’...I never got to know him real well, but in a way kinda I felt like I did. I reckon it must’ve been because he looked so much like you.
<name>partner</name>	partner	Howard	How can—” I shrugged. “Somebody has to keep their heads, and it sure looks like you can’t. You got some more questions, [MASK]?” “Yes,” he nodded slowly. “I’ve got one.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Lou	Why, [MASK]?” “Oh, I was kind of run down and nervous, and he thought—” “Why, you were not! You were never that way!” “Well,” I said, “he thought I was.”
<name>partner</name>	partner	Lou	That was about his speed. But this had him thrown for a loop. “You know what this means, [MASK]?” “Well, it doesn’t necessarily mean that,” I said, and I gave him an out.
<name>partner</name>	partner	Lou	We’d gone on for years, and you seemed to be growing more and more indifferent; you seemed to keep drawing away from me and taking pleasure in making me follow. (Seemed, [MASK]; I don’t say you did do it.)
<name>Brett</name>	Brett	Lou	She turned away from me and lay on her back, picking at the quilt with her fingers. I got up and found a cigar, and sat down on the bed again. “You don’t want to marry me, do you, [MASK]?”
<name>Saul</name>	Saul	Rothman	In other words, [MASK] was saving two necks—his and mine— with one lawyer. “Perhaps you won’t need him,” he went on. “But it’s best to have him alerted. He’s not a man who can make himself available on a moment’s notice.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Mike	And up overhead in the loft, where the rats now scampered and scurried, [MASK] had found me with the little gi— A rat screamed suddenly on a high note. I got out of the car and hurried out of the big sliding door of the barn, and into the backyard.
<name>tell me</name>	tell me	Lou	I said. “I appreciate your sentiments—your interest—but I’ll have to ask you to come to the point. What did you wish to tell me, anyway?” “Oh, it wasn’t any—” “Please, [MASK]!”
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Johnnie	“You mean they’ll be sore?” He grunted. “To hell with ’em. They don’t mean anything to me, but you’re a square joe.” “Am I?” I said. “How do you know I am, [MASK]?
<name>Cherry</name>	Cherry	Amy	And even with the way I felt about her, the nod came easy. On the surface, [MASK] had everything plus. She was smart and she came from a good family— which was a mighty important consideration with our people. But that was only the beginning.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bob	“No,” I said. “It didn’t seem to me like a very good time to do much talking.” “Well, I talked to him, [MASK], I did. Rather he talked to us. And he’s really raring and tearing.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Lou	“Back in the bedroom. Why don’t you go on back? I’ll bet she won’t say no if you try to slip it to her.” “Aw,” he blinked foolishly. “Aw, you shouldn’t talk like that, [MASK].
<name>one thing</name>	one thing	Amy	well, it wasn’t just [MASK]. There wasn’t anything I could put my finger on, but I had the feeling that things were closing in on me. And I couldn’t talk myself out of it. Every day that passed, the feeling grew stronger.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Morally	[MASK]— perhaps even legally—I share the responsibility for any untoward action you might take. At any rate, we’ll say, I and the unions I head could be placed in a very unfavorable light.” “You said it,” I said.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Amy	I was glad [MASK] didn’t bring up the subject of marriage; she was afraid of starting a quarrel, I guess. I’d already been right in the middle of three deaths, and a fourth coming right on top of ’em might look kind of funny.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Max	Who else?” My heart gave a little jump. Maybe... But, no, it was no good. I couldn’t do that. I couldn’t bring myself to try it. “I don’t have any idea, [MASK],” I said.
<name>it</name>	it	Elmer	“At ten o’clock,” I nodded. There were twenty-five twenties in the roll. Five hundred dollars. Now that I had it, it was welcome; I could always use a little extra money. But I hadn’t planned on touching [MASK].
<name>Ed</name>	Ed	Lou	I waited and everything got pretty quiet. “Well,” I said, finally, “that’s sure too bad. All four tires, huh?” “Too bad? You mean it’s funny, don’t you, [MASK]?
<name>Margie</name>	Margie	Bob	I knew you’d feel a lot more hurt about it than I did. That’s the way you are, and you wouldn’t know how to be any other way....” “[MASK],” I said.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Hendricks	“Well” — [MASK] swallowed heavily—“ten this morning, he thought. He wanted to—he’s chartering one of the airline’s twin-motor jobs, and they’ve got to fit it up with oxygen and a—” “Uh-huh.
<name>who</name>	who	Lou	He had accepted it as suicide?” “I can’t say that he was resigned to it,” I said. “He was wondering whether someone—if someone was in the cell after I left, and.. “And, [MASK]? And?”
<name>Biff</name>	Biff	Lou	I don’t mind for myself, but you can’t say it about her, get me? You can’t say that the girl I’m going to marry would sleep with a guy who plays around with whores!” “Let me go, [MASK]!
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Amy	“What are you saying, [MASK]?” “You screwed her. You’ve been doing it all along. You’ve been putting her dirty insides inside of me, smearing me with her. And I’m going to make you pay for it.
<name>Stark</name>	Stark	Howard	Not with that shrapnel you got in you. I got an idea about that shrapnel, [MASK]—what you could do with it. You could get you some X-rays taken and print ’em on the back of your campaign cards.
<name>He</name>	He	But”—he	“[MASK] turned slowly and tried to look at me, to see my face. “You’d better do that,” I said. “The air gets kind of bad with both of us sitting up.” “Oh,” he said.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bob	“No, sir, [MASK],” he drawled. “Been kind of studyin’ things over, and I reckon I ain’t going to do no spying no more. Ain’t going to do it a-tall.” “You got your mind made up, huh?
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Lou	“Did you notice the remodeling he’s doing? Do you know how much all that will cost? Right around twelve thousand dollars. Where do you suppose he got that kind of money?” “How the hell do I—” “[MASK].”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Johnnie	“You know me better than that, [MASK].” “Sure, I do,” he smiled, warmly. “I’ve got plenty of nagging from people, but no one but you ever really tried to help me.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Bob	I told you to use your own judgment, and she was a mighty cute little trick from all I hear. I’d probably have let her stay myself if I’d been in your place.” “I’m sure sorry, [MASK],” I said.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Honey	“But I don’t know as that had anything to do with it.” “[MASK].. “Yeah?” “Why do you suppose people... ?” “It beats me,” I said. “I never have been able to figure it out.”
<name>friend</name>	friend	Lou	I see, I see,” he said, and he stood up and held out his hand. “I’m sorry I troubled you for nothing, [MASK], but I’ve certainly enjoyed our talk. I hope we can get together again sometime.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Johnnie	“I’m saying that—that—goddammit, [MASK] wasn’t anywhere near the scene of the murders! He was stealing tires at the time they were committed!” “Is that a fact?” I drawled.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Lou	You’re going to have to move, [MASK]. Fast. Before someone... before you upset yourself.” “I was kind of figuring on leaving town,” I said. “I haven’t done anything, but—” “Certainly you haven’t.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Ford	“Oh, no you’re not. I’m warning you here and now, [MASK], don’t you even attempt to leave.” “Who’s going to stop me?” “I am.” “On what grounds?”
<name>Phyllis</name>	Phyllis	Bob	I should have known better.” “Say,” I said, letting it dawn on me at last. “You don’t mean you thought I—” “Of course, we didn’t think so,” said [MASK], warmly.
<name>her</name>	her	Amy	I knew I had to kill [MASK]; I could put the reason into words. But every time I thought about it, I had to stop and think why again. I’d be doing something, reading a book or something, or maybe I’d be with her.
<name>Doctor</name>	Doctor	Lou	She picked up her panties and began putting them on, still standing behind the chair. “There’s no use arguing about it, [MASK],” she said, wearily. “I suppose I can thank my lucky stars that I haven’t caught some terrible disease.”
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Elmer	“It seems so—oh, so complicated! I mean it looks like we could have got the money without dragging [MASK] into it.” “Well...” I glanced at the clock. Nine thirty-three. I didn’t need to stall any longer.
<name>Ed</name>	Ed	Conway	[MASK] had been the big man in town before the oil boom. He’d always been able to deal with others on his own terms. He’d gone without opposition for so many years that, by this time, he hardly knew it when he saw it.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Mike	This man—” “I know. The guy was an iron tramp, working on a permit. He blew into town without a dime. Three days after [MASK]’s death he left in a new Chevy which he paid cash on the line for.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Johnnie	Yes, it was [MASK], speaking in that sharp smart-alecky way he used a lot. I jumped up from the bunk and started turning around and looking up and down and sideways. And here his voice came again: “Hello, you lovely people.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Joe	It’s not really relevant.” “I suppose the boys don’t have it too easy,” I said. “But here’s the way I look at it, [MASK]. There’s no law says they have to stick to one line of work.
<name>Andy</name>	Andy	Lou	“I just about would have.” “You want to come over and set a spell, [MASK]? Play a game of checkers or somethin’? I ain’t supposed to be up or I’d offer to come over there.”
<name>he</name>	he	Mike	“No one knows anything. There was never any proof.” “The girl identified him.” “A girl less than three years old! She’d have identified anyone they showed her.” “And [MASK] admitted it. And they dug up some other cases.”
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Lou	“I’ll tell you what I always do,” I said. “I take the water from a boiled onion, and squeeze a big lemon into it. Well, maybe a middling-size lemon and a small one if—” “[MASK]!”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Joe	It’s a good act but it’s easy to overdo.” “You kind of asked for it, [MASK],” I said. “And now you know why. And I’m not very bright or I wouldn’t be a labor skate.”
<name>she</name>	she	Mike	Everything would fall into place, right back to the time when [MASK] and I were kids. As things stood now, she wouldn’t let herself think things through. She wouldn’t even let herself start to think.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Amy	I don’t suppose you’d... No, you wouldn’t do that. I don’t expect no man in his right mind would give up [MASK].” I nodded a little, like I was acknowledging a compliment; agreeing that I couldn’t give her up.
<name>Cowboy</name>	Cowboy	Lou	He said it like that, all run together, without waiting for me to reply. He opened the door and slid into the seat beside me. “Come out this way often, [MASK]?” “Whenever I feel like it,” I said.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Bob	Come on in and sit a minute.” I went in, nodding to his secretary, and pulled a chair up to the desk. “Just talked to [MASK]’s wife a little while ago,” I said. “He’s not feeling so good.”
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Conway	All we can do is sit tight; just be available in the event that [MASK] starts tossing his weight around. I imagine he’ll become resigned to the situation before too long.” “It was too bad about the girl dying,” I said.
<name>he</name>	he	Mom’ll	He says I should bring this babe to the house and [MASK] make some ice cream, an’ we’ll all play cards or somethin’! For Christ’s sake!” He shook his head bewilderedly. “How stupid can a person get?” I laughed gently.
<name>asked</name>	asked	Amy	and I whispered into hers: “Bread and butter... “Bad luck, stay ’way from my darling. ” H e showed up on, well, I guess it was the following Tuesday. The Tuesday after the Saturday the bum had shown up and [MASK]
<name>George</name>	George	Johnnie	I looked over the work and had him explain things to me, and I’d offer him a lift when he had to go someplace. I’d say it was sure going to be one up-to-date restaurant and that [MASK] would sure like it—that he did like it.
<name>Rocky</name>	Rocky	Joe	“All right, [MASK],” I said. “And thanks for—for—” “For what?” He opened the door. “For you, I haven’t done a thing.” “I’m not sure I can make it in two weeks.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Lou	“Give you any trouble, [MASK]?” “No,” I said, “he was real peaceful. I think we’ve broken the case.” “He’s gonna talk, huh?” “They’ve talked before,” I shrugged.
<name>partner</name>	partner	Lou	“Sure, I will.” And I went back into the living room with him. He flopped down into a chair, and he drained his drink at a gulp. “Let’s do something, [MASK]. Let’s go out and paint old cow town red.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Lou	“[MASK]!” She stood back from the door, startled. “I couldn’t imagine who—where’s your car? Is something wrong?” “Nothing but a flat tire,” I grinned. “I had to leave the car down the road a piece.”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Amy	“My!” she said, after a moment; and her chin began to edge outward. “Such enthusiasm!” “Oh,” I said, giving my head a shake. “I’m sorry, [MASK]. I had something on my mind.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Lou	If he’d have had an alibi for the time of the murders, he’d have told me so, wouldn’t he? He wouldn’t have hanged himself.” “He liked you, [MASK]. He trusted you.” “For damned good reasons.
<name>unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name.)	unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name.)	Lou	“I’m sorry, [MASK]. You have every right to be angry with me.” She lay back down again, turning on her stomach, spreading her arms and legs. She stretched out, waiting, and whispered; “Very, very angry...”
<name>Children</name>	Children	Lunatics	[MASK] can’t vote, so why should the legislature vote a lot of money for them? “As a matter of fact—uh—” It was just beginning to soak in on him. “I think I’d better—” “Stick around,” I said.
<name>did not appear in the given passage</name>	did not appear in the given passage	Johnnie	If you’ve got that, you can put up with almost anything.” “Yes,” I said. “It makes a lot of difference, and—That’s that. You didn’t tell ’em you got that twenty from me, [MASK]?”
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Bob	“You trying to get rid of me, [MASK]?” I said. “Kind of looks as though, don’t it?” he grinned. “Guess I did too much thinkin’ while I was laying around the house.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Amy	I changed into some fresh clothes, and made some scrambled eggs and coffee. As I sat down to eat, the phone rang. I supposed it was the office, or maybe [MASK] checking up on me; she’d have to call early or wait until four when her school day was over.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Johnnie	“They were just doing their duty, [MASK]. Have a cigar and I’ll smoke one with you.” We sat down side by side on the bolted-down bunk, and I held a match for our cigars.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Lou	He wanted to—he’s chartering one of the airline’s twin-motor jobs, and they’ve got to fit it up with oxygen and a—” “Uh-huh. Well, that ought to be all right. [MASK] and me’ll have time to scrub up a little and pack a bag.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Lou	Last night’s events—these recent events—I don’t like them a bit, [MASK].” “Well,” I said, “that’s natural enough. Don’t hardly see how you could like ’em. I know I sure don’t.”
<name>darling</name>	darling	Lou	Sometimes I get the crazy, wonderful notion that you have been, that you were even as happy as I was (though I don’t see how you could be!) and at others I tell myself... Oh, I don't know, [MASK]!
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Rothman	“He could have had it, a big enough part, anyway, so’s they’d wait on the rest. It didn’t need to be in a bank. He could have had it salted away around his house.” “Yeah,” said [MASK], slowly.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	T’hell	“[MASK] with him. He’s got some business here; stayin’ over for a few days. We’ll check our bags somewheres, so’s we won’t have to run into him again, and then we’ll have a party.”
<name>Miss Emily</name>	Miss Emily	Bob	He said it was a plumb purty day out, and a man’d have to be plain out of his mind to claim different. “I reckon a man hadn’t ought to ask you a question about all the hocus-pocus around here, now had he, [MASK]?
<name>Darry</name>	Darry	Lou	He took the blame for me. So if you should do your talking around town, it would be a lot worse than you realized. People would start thinking, and before it was all over...” “But, [MASK]. I’m not going to say anything.
<name>Brenda</name>	Brenda	Amy	I went home and fixed myself a whopping big meal, and ate every bite of it. That B-complex was really doing its job. So was the other stuff. I began to actually look forward to seeing [MASK]. I began to want her bad.
<name>Chigurh</name>	Chigurh	Hendricks	You’re kind of a newcomer out this way—been here eight years now, ain’t you? — but you still ought to know better’n to ask a man a question like that.” “What the hell?” said [MASK]. “It’s my job.
<name>the others</name>	the others	Conway	They, [MASK] and the others, still weren’t positive about that piece of evidence they had; and, like I say, they preferred to have me crack up and confess. So, on the evening of my second night in the asylum, there came the stunt.
