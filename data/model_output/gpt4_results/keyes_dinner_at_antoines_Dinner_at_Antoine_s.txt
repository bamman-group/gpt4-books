<name>Henrietta</name>	Henrietta	Ruth	Indeed, in the latter case, [MASK] would have dismissed the idea of such a possibility almost indignantly. The same delicacy which precluded her from a deliberate attempt to draw mental conclusions also prevented her from asking any questions, and no apt comment came quickly to her mind.
<name>George</name>	George	Sabin	“I suppose so,” [MASK] answered absently. “I wouldn’t know. The sight of those two shadows coming together and making one shadow drove me nuts. Of course, I’d been drinking anyway, so it isn’t all too clear in my mind, outside of that one sharp picture.
<name>Drummond</name>	Drummond	Amelie	Of course, I’ve got that in a safe, along with half a million dollars’ worth of other gems. It’s the finest collection of its kind I’ve ever seen.” Again he paused and this time [MASK] made a vague sound, resembling a soft purr.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Caresse	“Don’t you think any third person would spoil an idyl like that? Can’t you guess now why I was pleased that [MASK] had an opportunity that would take her in a different direction—why that was something else I created, if you must have the whole truth?”
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Francisco	I f I had, of course 1 should have indignantly silenced the speakers. One does not permit one’s friends to be slandered in time of trouble.” “Thank you, [MASK]. For—for saying that. For—for feeling that way."
<name>Thurstan</name>	Thurstan	Amelie	“Tell me about it,” he urged. "You will feel better afterwards." "It was not another loss by death. But many tragedies are greater than that,” [MASK] said, so dramatically that the ancient cliche took on fresh vitality. "
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Clarinda	But while he was grappling with this problem, [MASK] herself solved it. "1 told you that if you would let me have my way at first, afterwards it would be all yours, didn’t I?” she asked softly.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Amelie	He paused long enough to give weight to his words. [MASK] moved slightly so that she would be able to look at him while he talked, but she did not withdraw from his encircling arm or interrupt him. "Just wait till you see it,” he went on. "
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Clarinda	Dey ain’ gwine need no weddin’ veils.” "Well, we’ll hope I’ll have boys and girls both,” [MASK] informed her. "Anyway, we’ve got to take care of the veil.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Sabin	“I’m sure this is only one of those misunderstandings that can easily be cleared up. If you’ll just sit down so that we can all try to . . . .” Mockingly, [MASK] interrupted her. “Sorry, I really haven’t a thing fit to wear.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Odile	Well, he was. But he wasn’t trying to get to [MASK]’s room. He—he was—he said he wanted to talk to me. That he had to talk to me.” “And did he? Talk to you, I mean?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Caresse	“Why don’t you do that, [MASK]? I’ve got lots of confidence in you. I believe you could make good, when you want to so much. But 1 honestly don’t know that I’m qualified to advise you.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Ruth	This time [MASK], slightly startled because he had divined her previous surmise, made a conscious effort not to guess what was passing in his mind, and he went on, “Not that it matters. Would you give me still another cocktail?
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Caresse	A large linen napkin, still slightly damp, unfolded to reveal as its contents tomato sandwiches, cheese sandwiches, sandwiches with a filling of rare roast beef. [MASK] devoured them all. Then she went into the bathroom and turned on the water.
<name>Mildred</name>	Mildred	Caresse	That connection [MASK] has with The Fashion Plate Dress Shop is certainly a help at a time like this. It would be pretty hard getting the necessary things together on such short notice if it weren’t for that. Everything’s difficult to manage on a Monday.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Amelie	But he had not considered her primarily and personally as his good companion, his prudent counsellor, or his dearly beloved. He had never before thought of a woman as a companion or sought one as a counsellor; and he had assumed, for years, that [MASK] was his beloved.
<name>Mac</name>	Mac	Rockefeller	“I don’t think so much of these Oysters [MASK]. 1 don’t see why we didn’t order tomato soup instead.” “Well, about a million other people like them, even if you don’t. Presidents and folks like that too!
<name>She</name>	She	Ruth	“I hope it was all right to call.” “Of course. Unless it’s to give me the bad news that you’ve changed your mind about our date.” The tension was already gone, the pleasant persuasive timbre sounding again. [MASK] felt unaccountably relieved.
<name>George</name>	George	Joe	“1 couldn’t have, if it hadn’t been for you, [MASK].” “All right, I’ll accept that for this time, because it fits in with what I’m going to say next.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Caresse	1 guess you know how he would do it. I could tell, just from reading it, that he is the exciting type." [MASK] nodded. "I’m sure if he were running on all cylinders he’d start rushing you right away.
<name>Maria</name>	Maria	....	If ever there was an angel on earth [MASK] And to think that she was given such a heavy cross that she couldn’t bear it!” “Would you mind if I asked you to repeat what you just said? I mean your daughter’s exact words.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Judith	“No, I couldn’t. Not feeling the way I do inside, even if all the rest were possible. And it sounds to me as if you were just dreaming things up, [MASK].” "I’m not dreaming things up.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Odile	Probably, because it’s as far as he ever goes, except maybe for one chaste kiss on the brow, so he has to concentrate on it. When [MASK] gets home, she’ll be exhausted from the strain of accepting such tender proofs of eternal devotion, and she’ll go straight to bed.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Uncle	Everything’s difficult to manage on a Monday. But I advised against waiting over another day. No use prolonging the agony." "You’d like me to go to the funeral, wouldn’t you, [MASK]?”
<name>Giuseppe</name>	Giuseppe	Roy	“This is the room where [MASK] staged the celebration of the restaurant’s centennial,” he told her. “And believe me, that was a party—an archbishop—supreme court judges—high ranking officers—all the big shots!
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Leonce	She walked around the car and climbed in beside [MASK], who quickly put it into gear. Then, without loss of time, he began to plead his case. "Don’t let’s fight, chere. There’s something I want you to know.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Joe	You could get on the telephone and—” And you could take that long lean arm of yours off from around my girl’s waist, he added mentally, wishing he dared say it aloud. Meanwhile, [MASK] had settled back more firmly on the sofa, shaking his head.
<name>Wolfe</name>	Wolfe	Murphy	"That’s nonsense,” he declared cheerfully. “This is the sort of thing that doesn’t call for ceremonial procedure. Technically, you’re right, of course. You don’t have to prove your innocence. [MASK] and Company have to prove your guilt.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Odile	As her physician he persuaded [MASK] to go right ahead. He practically ordered her to do it. Said it would be the best thing in the world to take her mind off the bad news. It wasn’t easy, getting her to go, but finally she did.
<name>Felicity</name>	Felicity	Caresse	[MASK] looked down at it with the same amazed appreciation which she had felt ever since first seeing it; she still found it hard to understand how a real garden could have been created in a nook of this sort and how it could give an effect of such refreshment and beauty.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	“Hail [MASK], full of grace, the Lord is with Thee,” she began, over and over again, very softly, so that she would not disturb her husband, who was slumbering beside her. Yet she could not complete the simple formula.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Odile	For now that [MASK] is dead, I love you more than anyone else in the world. And because my love for you and my love for her have been interwoven so many years, I feel you are the one to whom this letter about her should be sent.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ruth	No place like an automobile for a quiet conversation that no one can overhear or interrupt. I wouldn’t like to leave [MASK] for all day, until she gets going under her own steam; but she has a date of her own for this afternoon, and she won’t miss us.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Ruth	So I rigged up a rather elaborate set of precautions to keep my whereabouts secret. I sent word to [MASK] I wasn’t feeling fit, and that I was going up to my rooms to catch up on some badly needed rest.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Amelie	and I’m right, but you win. I’ve got to have you, so I’ll take you on your own terms. Now that’s settled, when do we have the wedding?" For a moment [MASK] stared at him, almost stupidly.
<name>Waldo</name>	Waldo	Odile	Of course, you won’t be seeing him running on all cylinders, right now. He’s had a knockout blow himself.” There was no use trying to avoid it; they kept reverting, directly or indirectly, to [MASK].
<name>her</name>	her	Odile	But as 1 was saying, she keeps looking over towards our table I know she can’t hear us, with the orchestra blaring the way it is, but just the same she makes me uneasy. So let’s not talk about [MASK] any more, cher.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Abraham	But every dish quite an achievement in its own way. ... I remember the first time 1 ever had this particular version of shrimp in aspic,” he continued as [MASK] reappeared and placed a glistening, ruby-colored serving before each of the diners.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Odile	And besides ....’’ “Yes? And besides?” "Well, it may not mean a thing, of course. But two little baby pillows, blue ones, lace-covered, have disappeared from [MASK]’s room.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Tossie	[MASK]’s frame of mind was doubtless rendered the more rosy because she not only served champagne during the course of the reception, but had taken a sip herself, every time she carried the tray back to the kitchen to be refilled.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Caresse	He was quick on the uptake, she could see that, and she also saw what [MASK] had meant in describing him as exciting. Without being handsome, he was extremely striking in appearance, slight and dark and given to quick sudden movements which had an almost uncanny grace.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Craig	[MASK]’s is right up yonder, across the road from the cemetery gate.” He maneuvered his car around a traffic light standard, drew up at the curb, and reached for his billfold. “Get something for me too, will you, .Caresse?
<name>Archer</name>	Archer	Odile	Says she’s too old and feeble to be kept in jail and wants me to have one of our lawyers get her out. He doesn’t believe she killed [MASK] either, of course.” “On what grounds was she arrested at all?"
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Tossie	1 don't dare put on the tiara or have either of you do it. We might tear the lace. And, after all, that’s got to be saved for the brides in the next generation.” [MASK] tittered.
<name>Miss</name>	Miss	Ellen	Now she saw that the maid was standing before her, with an air of patient resignation. “Oh—I’m sorry, [MASK]. Ask him if I may call him back, in about half an hour.” “He isn’t on the telephone, miss.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Joe	The abrupt command seemed to recall the girl to herself, almost as though some physical impact had halted her speech. She looked at [MASK] uncertainly for a minute, shook her head, and spoke with almost complete composure. “That was silly of me, wasn’t it?”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Vance	I’ll send you something that will pep you up.” The translucent hands moved again, ever so slightly. The tired eyes half opened. "If I could just be sure you’d be here, [MASK], when—at the end.
<name>Elrond</name>	Elrond	Tossie	"Of course I’ll give him the message. If he hasn’t reached home by the time I do. I’ll leave a note on his door marked ‘URGENT’ in big red letters.” “Good. As I said, I wanted to talk with him about [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Caresse	I can’t thank you enough for everything!” "I wish you wouldn’t try. It makes me feel silly as all get out. Not that 1 could possibly be more pleased that everything’s turning out so well for you, [MASK].
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Schaefer	“It kind of gets you, at that, don’t it?” [MASK] mused. “Think I’ll take a run to town tonight. The military band’ll be giving a concert in the plaza. How’s for siding me?” "B’lieve not.”
<name>Hitler</name>	Hitler	Peter	You think you don’t now, because you’re all worn out, because you’ve just been through a dreadful experience. But as soon as you’re rested again, as soon as your job’s given you a new outlook and a new interest, [MASK] and his cohorts will come in very handy.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Amelie	This has been a strain on them also .... [MASK], my dear, please go and lie down. I promise you 1 won’t leave the house. I’ll be waiting for you, right here, when you come back ....
<name>John</name>	John	Perrault	It would mean so much to her if she could only know, and I have a feeling she does. I’m doubly touched at your sympathy and thoughtfulness because not once since the funeral has her own heartless sister—” [MASK] put his arm around her.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Caresse	“There,” he said soothingly. “There. Don’t, [MASK]. I wouldn’t have said that to you if I could have helped it. But I couldn’t seem to make you see how serious this all is.
<name>Belinda</name>	Belinda	Tossie	Belatedly, she thrust her feet into her mules, drew her dressing gown about her, and knotted it at her waist as she rose. "We haven’t been talking about them long, darling,” she said pleasantly. “And [MASK] didn’t really mean what she said, anyway.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Joe	"I’m awfully glad to see you both. Can 1 hear the wonderful news right away, before I get involved with supper?” She shook hands with both girls and then, declining a chair for herself, sat down on the arm of [MASK]’s.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Ruth	Occasionally mule trains would pass by, the men who drove them carrying drinking gourds slung over their shoulders and sheathed machetes at their belts. And all day long oxcarts with disk wheels of solid wood would go creaking along. From her walled garden, [MASK] watched all these with fascination.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Caresse	1 came early, as [MASK] told you I would, so that we’d be sure to have seats in the very front row.” It did not take them five minutes to reach the Auditorium, and the doors were just opening as they went swiftly up the steps.
<name>Hagrid</name>	Hagrid	Tossie	Less harshly, he added, “Well, it’s too late to worry about that now. And you two have got to keep up your strength, you know. I better tell [MASK] to make some coffee, hadn’t I? Or what about a drink?”
<name>Millie</name>	Millie	Judith	And then what happened? Right out of the blue, along came [MASK]. And look at me now!” "1 don’t think 1 could wait for years and years for something like that to happen. I wouldn’t have the courage or the endurance.”
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Sabin	“Ain’t it enough for you?” “Plenty!" There was unfeigned relief in [MASK]’s voice. “And 1 do mean plenty. Let me ask you just one thing more. What time was it when you ran into me?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sabin	Because, being the kind of a girl you are, you could be afraid it might, and in that case you wouldn’t mention it.” “I would have been afraid, if you hadn’t told me. Thanks, [MASK], for everything.
<name>Pat</name>	Pat	Judith	“But good grief, [MASK]! Cranberry juice—Scotch oatmeal—curried eggs—walnut muffins—” "I said, don’t eat any more than you want. I see you have made away with all the sandwiches though.” “Yes, and were they ever good!
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Ruth	“Why, yes, if you’d like to have me,” [MASK] replied, slightly startled by the unexpectedness of this approach. “All right. My things are out in the hall. I’ll just pick them up as we go along.”
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Caresse	There was something fearsome in its very spontaneity and its strength. It rang true. For a moment after she had silenced herself, [MASK] stared at him with anguished eyes. Then she crumpled forward in her chair, hiding her face in her hands.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Huntington	And he arrived at eight twenty-three.” “That’s about as I remembered it. Must have been a fast boat, at that. And now the second point. What was the timing of the return trip?” Again [MASK] consulted his typed report.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Bud	So 1 did it. Next thing you know, a guy comes up to me there and says he’s the one who has the skiff, so we go down the steps from the gallery—[MASK]’s camp is built way out at the end of a long pier.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Bonham	"Nope,” [MASK] said. “I forgot to tell you. I checked him at the station. He was dead to the world, but he didn’t have to be sober for me to take his prints.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Toe	And neither does [MASK]. He didn’t really think so before, but those blood spots and that unreported accident were bothering him. Now that you’ve explained—and it took real guts to do that too—I expect you haven’t a thing to worry about.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Raichac	But [MASK] was already giving them glare for glare. "Nuts to you!” he jeered. "You guys said we’d have a roll of jack like a saw-log; and what did we get out of that cash register? A lousy twenty-two bucks.
<name>Wolfe</name>	Wolfe	Murphy	This whorl-and-arch pattern is so plain that 1 can tell just by looking at the fingers if they're likely to check. That way we can eliminate some of them.” “That’s all right, for a starter,” agreed [MASK].
<name>Rosie</name>	Rosie	Lucita’d	You are the captain of your soul or what have you. Me, I’m going to see if [MASK] like to let me make a little time tonight. See you tomorrow in the wild blue yonder." “Hasta manana.
<name>Judy</name>	Judy	Ruth	Ask him if I may call him back, in about half an hour.” “He isn’t on the telephone, miss. He’s in the library.” [MASK] glanced down at her wrist watch. It was not quite nine-thirty.
<name>Prosser</name>	Prosser	Francisco	“[MASK] and I see eye to eye in this matter,’’ he announced triumphantly. “I told you I’d been dining with him and his daughter. No, I’m not sure that I mentioned his daughter before, but she was there, too.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Caresse	A week has now passed since I killed her to save her from committing this terrible sin and to save myself from betraying all the ideals which have guided me throughout my career. You do not understand either, [MASK]? Well, I must try to make you do so.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Orson	I hear the orchestra they’ve got there now really sends the cash customers, and dancing’s the best exercise in the world.” “[MASK], you gay and giddy creature! That’s a marvelous idea.”
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Judith	[MASK] laid down her knitting. “That’s a nice old quilt, isn’t it?” she asked. “The pattern’s called the wedding ring design. My grandmother gave it to my mother when she got married. Then my mother gave it to me.
<name>Millicent</name>	Millicent	Amelie	Your dear, dead sister wouldn’t have done such a thing. She was a lady, in every sense of the word, and she considered me first of all.” [MASK] brought the chiffon handkerchief into play, but she did so briefly, aware that time was really pressing.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Caresse	They think of it as exotic, romantic, and all the rest.” “Well then, you intended all along that [MASK] wouldn’t be coming with us, but you didn’t actually begin to plan to get her out of the way until Saturday morning?”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Leonce	Then, as she sprang lightly into the blue sedan, she inquired rather pettishly, “How did you expect me to recognize you on the double when you drove up in this poor ramshackle bus, [MASK]? You might have told me beforehand, instead of making all that racket.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Caresse	“Do you know what this means too?” she faltered. “I’m afraid so,” he said with unwonted gentleness. “If I were you, [MASK], I wouldn’t read the rest of that letter until you get on the train.
<name>Harley</name>	Harley	Sabin	“Well, that clears up one part of it for me,” [MASK] said thoughtfully, as though speaking to himself. “Little by little I might .... But hold on a minute. You said I’d made a deal to go in with you on this Llorando play, or whatever it is?”
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Tossie	Her slip showed the same red stain, and feeling no need for further instructions, [MASK] whipped this off too. Then she bent over, examining the bared breasts with anxious eyes and searching hands, making vague sounds as she did so.
<name>Constance</name>	Constance	Clarinda	"I have been rather crowding the calendar. And circumstances over which I’ve had no control have crowded it for me still further. Now just today—” "Yes?” inquired [MASK], opening her fan and looking at him encouragingly.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Joe	But she was injured by a bomb, or something, during the war and she has to wear high-necked dresses and do her hair just a certain way, in order to hide the scars. Believe it or not, [MASK] dreamed up the kind of clothes she wears and the hairdo for her.”
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Clarinda	For the first time since entering the house he was uncomfortable; [MASK] was not the sort of girl for whom a man vaguely offered to “do things.” But if his speech struck her in the same light that it had him, there was nothing in her rejoinder to betray this.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Aldridge	“Something of the sort,” [MASK] admitted imperturbably. “Weren’t you afraid of such a blind date?” “On the contrary. What could be more appropriate for an explorer? Isn’t he always deliberately seeking the unknown?
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Caresse	“But—but I don’t seem to have more than about six dollars and a little change with me. Could you—that is, if you’ll be good enough . . . .” Disdainfully [MASK] passed him her smart afternoon bag.
<name>John</name>	John	Perrault	Then he found the garage attendant lounging around the parking space, chewing gum; the idea that a physician might want his car in a hurry did not seem to enter the man’s thick head. When [MASK] spoke to him sharply, the attendant simply stopped chewing and stared at him in astonishment.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ruth	Her mother confided in me while we were at the Blue Room. You and I’ll talk about it later. But first I feel impelled to remind you that though you haven’t said anything derogatory about anyone, there are some very conspicuous omissions in your comments.” [MASK] colored.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Murphy	You have told me. And if, after you leave, it seems to be indicated that [MASK] should be told, I will tell him. Do you think you can trust me to do that?” ‘,‘Of course, I can.
<name>She</name>	She	Ruth	"That’s mighty white of you. Especially as you took such a dislike to me, almost the moment you met me. Not that I blame you.” [MASK] opened her lips to protest, but decided against it and closed them again.
<name>Lucia</name>	Lucia	Amelie	And in this room the floor and the coiffeuse match. I think it’s quite effective.” This time [MASK] found it possible to frame actual words, or rather found it quite impossible to refrain from doing so. “It must be beautiful,” she said.
<name>John</name>	John	Foxworth	And you’ve given me a glimpse of it! I’ve never been so thrilled in my whole life as I have in this last hour!” She pushed the tea table away from her and rose. [MASK] was already on his feet.
<name>Wemmick</name>	Wemmick	Foxworth	"But I told you how that was,” retorted [MASK]. “You had your own insinuations about a latchkey in my possession, if you’ll remember. And I told you I had knocked and rung the bell, but received no answer.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Odile	But never again would she deliberately embark on such a scurvy adventure. She would hold out for the narrow band—preferably diamond set—and the center aisle. She was even more truly her mother’s daughter than [MASK], when it came to showy externals.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Tossie	Except that I’d be very grateful if you would take [MASK] home with you. You needn’t keep her there, if you don’t want to—you can settle that part with her later, without any help from me.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Caresse	But he can still show a girl a pretty tall time. And he’s got no end of young reporters cluttering up his office who’d jump at the chance of taking you out.” “I don’t want—” [MASK] began.
<name>him</name>	him	Foxworth	And I’m not—that is, not completely.” She paused, still looking [MASK] full in the face and when she went on, a note of anxiety had crept into her voice. “I’m afraid I shouldn’t have said that.
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	Orson	“I suppose you thought if you went sneaking down to [MASK]’s office and wound him around your little finger, you could get around me too," she said. “Well, you can’t. In fact, you chose the worst possible way to do it.
