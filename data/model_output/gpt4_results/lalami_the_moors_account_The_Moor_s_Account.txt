<name>Zaynab</name>	Zaynab	Caftan	The sultan s mekhazniya fell upon her and, beating her this way and that, threw her out of the palace. [MASK] in tatters, feet bare, hands broken, the girl returned home, where her aunt tried to nurse her back to health.
<name>Heavens</name>	Heavens	Castillo	The reason he did this was because all of them—grandfather, father, mother, and three boys—were blind. All of them? I asked. How can that be? It was the pox that made them blind. Heavens, [MASK] said.
<name>the viceroy</name>	the viceroy	Mendoza	The viceroy was sitting on an armchair, his leg in the lap of an Indian servant, who was tightening the buckle of his shoe. The heavy mgs that covered the floors muffled any sound we made when we entered the room, so that neither [MASK] nor his servant heard us.
<name>Rodrigo</name>	Rodrigo	Dorantes	He looked like a proper Castilian gentleman now, with doublet and cape, breeches and buckled shoes. [MASK] looked on with undisguised envy. It would be awhile before he heard back from his father and, until then. he had to subsist on what remained of his money.
<name>Everest</name>	Everest	Narvaez	A feeling of fellowship, which could not have existed between us on that raft bound us together now. We both wanted the same thing: to make our entire journey in reverse, return home to what remained of our families, and try to forget about [MASK] and his expedition.
<name>Atahualpa</name>	Atahualpa	Kamasha	A butterfly had landed on his arm, just below the couter of his armor, but he paid it no attention. Instead, he held out the golden ring, lifting it up closer to [MASK]’s face, as if the cacique were half-blind.
<name>Shadow</name>	Shadow	Abejorro	I patted his neck and checked behind me for what might have scared him, but all I could see was an oak tree, its leathery leaves weighed down by the heat. Sshh, [MASK], I said. Sshh.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Castillo	All the fiddles in our company, including the friars, had been stripped of their strings, which had been used to tie the sails. He missed music the most, he said. [MASK] was about to say something too, when a rock landed on his hand.
<name>John</name>	John	Dorantes	I am fine, [MASK] said. He ran his hand on his forehead, wiping away his sweat, and stood up. See, I am fine, he said, just before a bout of nausea seized him and he bent down again. Come now, I said.
<name>Amara</name>	Amara	Ramatullai	I did not know why [MASK] insisted on following the conversation at the masters’ dinner table. I myself found it too painful to hear about the drudgery of their daily lives, for it only reminded me of my loved ones and how much I missed them.
<name>Rodrigo</name>	Rodrigo	Dorantes	What an incredible opportunity! It is, he sighed. And if the friar and I manage to reach them, just imagine what we will find. You would have a claim to all those riches. The thought of the Seven Cities silenced [MASK] for a long while.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Yusuf	But [MASK] caught on soon enough and he cried out. No! He snatched the money from my hands and tried to give it back to the Portuguese clerk, but the clerk watched us with dispassionate eyes, eyes that had grown used to such displays in his office.
<name>Yongzheng</name>	Yongzheng	Dorantes	Even if the viceroy sends a mission to the north, no one can be declared governor of a province without an order from the king. [MASK] replied: But are we just going to sit here and wait while others take the territory from us?
<name>Capitan</name>	Capitan	Dorantes	He waved the servant away and stood up. Ah, Capitan, he said. It is so kind of you to come. Thank you for inviting me, [MASK] said. But I hear you are already leaving us? the viceroy asked. In a few weeks.
<name>Thane</name>	Thane	Ahku	That afternoon, when we arrived at his gates, [MASK] came out to greet us. He was an older man and his hair was streaked with white, but he walked about with the posture and vigor of a youthful warrior.
<name>Yitzhak</name>	Yitzhak	Mustafa	Suddenly I felt certain that I was the cause of my fathers latest bout of melancholia, and the shame of it filled me with despair. [MASK], my mother said. She put down her embroidery. Answer me. When are you going to take a wife?
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Tekotsen	He stood, silhouetted against the candlelight from the bedroom, looking like a man who had gotten lost on his way home. When he saw me in the hallway, the confusion on his face gave way to relief. [MASK], he whispered.
<name>Althea</name>	Althea	Ruiz	and I realized then that I had spoken to her in a foreign tongue, though it was not any tongue I had heard or known before. The sound of chatter woke me up. [MASK] had found a clear spring nearby and brought water for everyone in the company.
<name>Leila</name>	Leila	Amna	(By then, as I said, I had lost interest in my masters trade and did not pay close attention to what happened in the shop.) Why do you ask? My daughter [MASK]—she was sold to a man like that. You have a daughter?
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Dorantes	And what did you say? I asked. I refused, of course, [MASK] said. Outside, the shadows of the orange trees had begun to lengthen; it would be dark soon. The lavender bushes swayed in the wind. Dead leaves eddied across the courtyard.
<name>Esteban</name>	Esteban	Beaset	From the beginning, that had been our agreement: we would share all of our earnings. In the morning, as my companions and I were packing up our belongings to return home, [MASK] came to tell us that the Coachos had sent for us.
<name>Alonso</name>	Alonso	Rodriguez	At church, he sang with a clear voice and offered an unburdened Amen to the priests prayer. [MASK] had two unforgivable habits, however, and it was because of his unquenchable desire to satisfy both that he sold me. But I must not get ahead of myself.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Ramatullai	[MASK] kept repeating these words like an incantation that could break any curse. Her comportment was less reserved than usual, I noticed; she touched my arm and leaned in close to me as she told me about her day. And she was distracted, too.
<name>Emilio</name>	Emilio	Miralos	[MASK]! There was much hugging and crying. The soldiers looked relieved to see their countrymen in this Indian town and one of them finally stopped pointing his musket and instead slung it across his chest. Names were exchanged; inquiries were made about hometowns; details were traded.
<name>Gideon</name>	Gideon	Miruelo	This might be the only way we have of leaving the bay. [MASK] said that we were only fifteen leagues by sea from the port. If we sail westward, we cannot fail to reach it. We have carpenters, do we not?
<name>humans</name>	humans	Castilians	They make some music, but it is very primitive, of the sort that a child could make if he were given a drum. They have no painting, no drawing, no sculpture, no architecture of any sort, none of the things that we [MASK] take for granted.
<name>Who</name>	Who	Torres	What had happened in the world during our absence? What news was there of all those we had left behind? So many questions pressed themselves against my lips that I did not know where to begin. But who are you? [MASK] asked us.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Diego	I had a gash just above the elbow; a long stream of blood flowed freely from it onto my hand. You should tie it, [MASK] said. It is not as bad as it looks, I said, I just need some oak bark for it.
<name>She</name>	She	Ramatullai	I stopped eating and waited. Eventually [MASK] spoke up again, though her voice was merely a whisper: His wife told him he needed to sell one of his slaves to pay back his debt. Not this, I thought. Not this.
<name>Amos</name>	Amos	Ruiz	[MASK] said. No one did anything. That is just how the heathens are. Look what they did to me. He pointed to the dark socket where his left eye had been, oblivious to the role he had played in his own predicament.
<name>Francis</name>	Francis	Castillo	The friar took a sip of the water himself and licked his lips thoughtfully. It tastes fine, he said. Holding out a cup, [MASK] said: Let me try it. Then, with finality: It tastes rotten. Are you sure?
<name>Thorn</name>	Thorn	Narvaez	Before I could formulate a question, he replied: She was promised to one of the settlers, but she said she did not want to marry him. That she wanted me. Then [MASK] decided to split the expedition, and she had to remain behind.
<name>David</name>	David	Dorantes	What are you doing? [MASK] repeated. Breaking up these canoes. We can use the wood as gunwales. You should not have done that. It is one thing to take food from them and another to destroy their property. They will come after us now.
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Rodriguez	He put the earring in his pocket and said: But do yourself a favor and give up the game of cards. It is too risky for a man like you. He laughed at his own joke, and [MASK] joined him with relief.
<name>Atalanta</name>	Atalanta	Behewibri	We get headaches, too. Do you know how to cure them? No, I said. [MASK] looked incredulous. You say you come from wondrous lands in the sunrise, with massive villages and many peoples, but you cannot help this boy?
<name>him</name>	him	Behewibri	The night before, at dinner, he had sat beside the cacique and listened attentively to all our stories without offering comments or questions. But now he asked me: What did you give your brother? I showed [MASK] the zaatar. Ah, he said.
<name>Youssef</name>	Youssef	Ahku	I came to this country with them. [MASK] ran a thumbnail on his lips, removing flecks of dry skin in one smooth stroke. His eyes traveled from me to my wife, and back again; I felt as if he were scrutinizing every gesture, every breath, every word.
<name>Alonso</name>	Alonso	Affonso	They looked at me uncomprehendingly. Yes, I said. I am sure. Then come with me, [MASK] said. We followed him across the quay to one of the merchant stations. A bald man, his head as smooth as an egg, stood up.
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Oyomasot	and I wondered what it would feel like under my neck once again. After a few moments, I left the sergeants house to go see [MASK] at the military barracks. The sentinel raised his musket when I approached, but immediately lowered it again when he saw that it was I.
<name>Alonso</name>	Alonso	Diego	You look about the same age as [MASK] here. Seventeen or eighteen, maybe? I am about twenty. Did you not think of all the good things you could never have if you joined the order? It is a calling, Capitan.
<name>Alvarado</name>	Alvarado	Alcaraz	So we split our numbers and, each in our own way, we instructed our guides to tell the Indians that [MASK] could not be trusted. We told them that we could not guarantee their safety and that they should all go back to their lands, where no harm would come to them.
<name>Corrine</name>	Corrine	Experience	[MASK] had taught me that these kinds of conversations, with personal questions, friendly questions even, were dangerous, that they fed the master new ways of tormenting you later on, when you let down your guard. So I remained quiet, hoping the moment would pass.
<name>English</name>	English	Tamazight	I had trouble speaking to them, on account of the fact that they spoke a different variety of [MASK] than I did, but by and by I gathered that they were the daughters of farmers who had suffered great hardship during the drought.
<name>Cabeza</name>	Cabeza	Coronado	They were all venturing into the unknown, unaware of the landscape, unfamiliar with the people, and ignorant of the languages. Except for the forty horses [MASK] had brought and the mules the friars rode, most of our company trudged on foot, burdened by baskets of provisions.
<name>Yuri</name>	Yuri	Leons	We gave them the last things we owned—what remained of our clothes, the ax, [MASK] gloves—in the hope that they would treat us better. We played with their children. We even tried to join in one of their dances.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Castillo	The look on his face confirmed [MASK] s judgment. At the Bay of Oysters, we had stripped the skin from the horses’ legs, dried it, and made water containers with it. But we had had no means to seal these pouches and now they had begun to turn rancid.
<name>Lucien</name>	Lucien	Castillo	I almost fell over him, but was pulled back just in time by [MASK]. Then a trumpet was sounded and the entrance slowly cleared of all the devout and the curious. My companions and I advanced toward the front steps.
<name>Flies</name>	Flies	Flies	The odor wrapped itself around my throat like a noose and made it impossible for me to breathe. Some of the bodies had been mutilated, I noticed, their noses, ears, or fingers cut out by the soldiers and hung from strings as keepsakes. [MASK] hovered around in a constant and unnerving drone.
<name>Alonso</name>	Alonso	Albaniz	I did not, the page replied. The savages did. [MASK], the governor said, you can have one of the packhorses. But, like all the other horsemen, the notary was greatly attached to his animal and the offer did nothing to quell his anger.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Castillo	Having caught up to us, my companions stopped to take their breath. [MASK] pressed his thumb on the sore that had been growing under his heel; clear pus drained from it. So pitiful was our condition that the Avavare boy made up his mind quickly.
<name>Almásy</name>	Almásy	Diego	I could not know. But it was my desire to know and my yearning for them that dictated everything I did in those days, everything I saw, but chose not to notice or reflect upon. Where is [MASK] now?
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ramatullai	The more his business prospered, the more my master seemed to find ways to waste his money, a fact that his wife, with the unimpeachable common sense of a butchers daughter, found profoundly distasteful. He does not have the money to pay back his debts, [MASK] said.
<name>Don Juan</name>	Don Juan	Beaset	A warm wind blew, rattling the feather-and-bone vestment that had been used in a dancing ceremony the night before and that still hung on a pole nearby. And who are the Coachos? I asked. Allies of mine, [MASK] replied.
<name>Alonso</name>	Alonso	Castillo	We have been here three weeks, [MASK], the governor said. How can we trust what the cacique is telling us? He wants us out of his capital, he will say anything to make us leave. His deputy said the same thing.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Senor	[MASK], I said, shaking him. The Indian men have returned. He shot to his feet—his hair was disheveled and his shirt wide open, but his eyes were alert. I helped him put on his armor.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Yahya	It was a story of courage and determination and it sounded so simple, the way he told it: round up all the soldiers and throw out the intruders. I was about to reply when [MASK] found a wishbone.
<name>his</name>	his	Dorantess	These faces were, I knew, reflections of my own. I awoke early one morning to find the space beside me empty— only the impression of [MASK] body remained on the bedding. Instantly, I knew something was wrong, because he never left the hut before me.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Yusuf	He snatched the money from my hands and tried to give it back to the Portuguese clerk, but the clerk watched us with dispassionate eyes, eyes that had grown used to such displays in his office. [MASK], who had always been the more sensitive one, started to cry.
<name>Elara</name>	Elara	Castillo	I knew he would find a way out of their camp. And you made it here safely, did you not? That is not what troubles me, and you know it. I have heard quite enough of your accusations, [MASK]. Besides, this tribe is not much better.
<name>Esteban's</name>	Esteban's	Leons	Again, I said to myself. He has stolen food again. My anger burned through me like a brushfire and, without considering the consequences of my actions, I signaled to three passing Carancahua boys and pointed them to [MASK] hiding place.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Velazquez	Why had he not listened to the advice of the carpenter and waited until morning? He had been in too much of a rush to cross the river. If only he had given the order to wait, [MASK] would still be alive.
<name>Joseph</name>	Joseph	Herrera	How good it is to see you. When did you arrive? Only this evening. We had many delays on the road because of the rain. They inquired after each other and discussed their health and ailments for a while before [MASK] asked what was new in the shop.
<name>Thalia</name>	Thalia	Castillo	If it was arduous work, at least it did not require as much skill with a bow and arrow. [MASK] and I managed to hit a young stag and the taste of its meat over the fire that evening made up for the labor it had cost.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Balsehekona	We all followed [MASK] to the camp square, where his pregnant wife stood, her hands resting on the mound of her belly. Her face was wet with tears. One of her sisters stood beside her, with an arm wrapped around her shoulder.
<name>Alaric</name>	Alaric	Narvaez	The horses are all they have. Is it fair that five of them tried to desert me? [MASK] replied sharply. The treasurer, whose contingent had been home to two of the deserters, lowered his gaze and did not reply.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Dorantes	She would be held and kissed and nursed and swaddled and sung to for days on end, but by the festival of the Resurrection, [MASK] would send her to live in a Spanish convent ten leagues north of the city. It was an early spring that year.
<name>he</name>	he	Abejorro	But when I thought of what might happen if [MASK] fell ill—and what might happen to me as a result—I relented. Gingerly, the ration master put his finger on the blade, and when it cut a sliver of his skin, he whistled in admiration.
<name>Quanah</name>	Quanah	Balsehekona	Take it and give us some of that meat. He pointed to the doe. The earring had been put in [MASK]’s hand, and eventually he stopped resisting. Without further comment, he and the other Caranca-huas picked up their weapons and began to walk.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Ramatullai	And in my closet the air was still and the walls were damp. I had taken off my shirt and was lying on my pallet in my breeches when [MASK] appeared at my door. In her hands were bowls of the leftover bean soup that was to be our dinner.
<name>Alonso</name>	Alonso	Senor	It is nothing, [MASK]. Nothing? Just a pebble. Let me see. He scratched at the pebble with a fingernail, revealing, under the layer of dirt, a brighter shade of yellow. He was an inquisitive man, my master, always asking questions about everything.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Dorantes	No, [MASK] replied. If we stay here, we will die, I said. I will go. You will not, he said. I was almost startled by his order. Did he think he could still impose his will upon me?
<name>Alonso</name>	Alonso	Albaniz	We found [MASK] wandering through the village, trailed by two scrawny dogs, faithful in the way of mangy animals. His beard had grown bushy and he was thinner now, but otherwise he looked much the same as before. He wore a blue cotton doublet and black breeches.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Diaz	No sooner was I alone with her than I reported to her all the arguments with [MASK] about our followers. Silently, she closed the door of our lodge and leaned back against it, as if she could not trust it to remain shut.
<name>Alonso</name>	Alonso	Dorantes	All I hear is their endless talk, [MASK] said. Can they just tell me what they want and save me all the chatter? These complaints were discreet, spoken in Castilian, and only when the four of us were alone, for fear that our hosts might overhear them and doubt our talents.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Ramatullai	I could see the pink soles of her feet as they went up and down, up and down, up and down. Though the pots rattled and the master heaved, [MASK] heard the door creak open. She turned her face toward me.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Oyomasot	How beautiful she was. A round-faced girl with a tiny mouth and long-lashed eyes that surveyed our messy world with astonishment. I kept my gaze averted, but I knew that, like [MASK] s, it was filled with envy.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Diego	It was dark outside, the only fight coming from the torches that the men had placed to light the path to the necessary. We could see the shapes of the men as they pulled the women away, but we could not make out their faces. Who are they? [MASK] asked.
<name>He</name>	He	Coronado	Go, he said. Go, before I change my mind. Before the day was over we encountered another group. [MASK] did not give the order to stop this time, and the horsemen moved their slaves to the side of the road so that our procession could pass.
<name>Alfonso</name>	Alfonso	Dorantes	One of them balanced a ball on his nose, while juggling seven metal rings at once. Another lay on his back and juggled a long, thick log with the soles of his feet. Your Highness is very kind, [MASK] said.
<name>Unfortunately</name>,	Unfortunately,	Oddly	From there, we beckoned the others to cross. [MASK], both of the pad-dlers on the second raft sat at the fore of the vessel, which made it difficult for them to maintain a good balance.
<name>Instantly</name>	Instantly	Instandy	He pointed upstairs. And look, he said. He pulled out a knife and, by way of demonstrating its sharpness, he pricked his thumb with it. [MASK] a bead of blood appeared; he licked it. But what do you do here? I asked.
<name>Thaddeus</name>	Thaddeus	Castillos	Which is why I want to reiterate that it is possible to establish imperial settlements through peaceful means. [MASK] face was already flushed from the effect of the wine and, when he spoke, his voice was high. I agree, he said.
<name>Robinson</name>	Robinson	Ruiz	But four men, all of them soldiers, sided with [MASK]. They left the very next morning, taking with them their weapons and some of the tools we still had and said they would return to the beach in the spring so that we could all leave the island on the same raft.
<name>Alonso</name>	Alonso	Alvar	I did not know the governor took such interest in your luggage. Friendship. Loyalty. You should try them sometime. A blinkered horse is loyal, too, [MASK]. The sun had reached its zenith now and there was a great stillness in the air.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Guzmans	In it, I saw a stranger—an older version of me, without the reserve that I had worn like a garment for many years. Our clothes were brought in: undershirts, breeches, doublets, capes, shoes, handkerchiefs. The servant said they came from [MASK] personal wardrobe.
<name>Portuguese</name>	Portuguese	Portuguese	My fathers tale ended at the moment when his arm was being severed and he lost consciousness. Now he smiled grimly and pointed the stem of his pipe toward me. My son, he said, this country is besieged by Castilians in the north and [MASK] in the west.
<name>Goodbye</name>	Goodbye	Dorantes	As soon as the spring rains ceased, he began to make preparations to leave. He had fashioned himself a small satchel from scraps of deerskin, and this he filled with nuts, dried strips of meat, and other provisions for the road. [MASK], I said.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Ruiz	He nudged his horse forward on the trail, and we resumed the march. But only a moment later, a scream of pain cut through the air like a knife, and [MASK] reemerged from the bushes, without his weapon and with his hands covering his bloodied face.
<name>Nantai</name>	Nantai	Tahacha	I pointed behind me, in the direction of the sunrise. We come from lands far away, I said. How far? On the other side of the ocean. [MASK] exchanged a surprised glance with his shaman, a lanky old man with an impressive array of tattoos.
<name>them</name>	them	Le6n	It is not as bad as it looks, I said, I just need some oak bark for it. (I was trying to sound braver than I really was; I did not want to give [MASK] the satisfaction of looking weak.)
<name>Atahualpa</name>	Atahualpa	Dulchanchellin	The soldiers looked everywhere. There is no gold. No gold at all? No. Not even copper. But this is the town the cacique—what was his name? [MASK]. Yes, him. This is the city he told us about.
<name>Alonso</name>	Alonso	Estebanico	For me he reserved a less humble tone. [MASK], he said, you have been given an important mission, and I trust you will execute it faithfully. I am ready. If you find the Seven Cities, you will be treated well and receive many rewards.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Dorantes	After my brother died of consumption, [MASK] suggested I come with him to the Indies. He said that I would become very rich or at the very least I could be made a mayor of a new town. But my father did not want me to go.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Dorantes	I went out to tether the dogs, but they kept barking and jumping and running around in circles, as if they sensed what was happening inside, so I relented and brought them with me into the living room. I found [MASK] sitting by himself, wrapped in a Spanish blanket.
<name>He</name>	He	Guzman	How far past the mountains is the first Indian town? Five days? Seven? Fourteen? I am not sure, I said. I did not pay attention to time. [MASK] stared at me for a long time. Then he put down his cup.
<name>Chingachgook</name>	Chingachgook	Leon	How do you know? This morning I saw them bathe and adorn the maiden. You saw her naked? As naked as the day she was born. What did she look like? Very pretty. For an Indian. Are you married, [MASK]? Aye.
<name>Talisa</name>	Talisa	Kewaan	[MASK] was a great beauty, and her sudden marriage caused some grumbling, for there were two youths among the Susolas who had wanted her for a wife. She was also known for her crafts, particularly her basket designs and the bracelets and anklets she fashioned out of deerskin.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Dorantes	Yes, me. You will hurt yourself. You heard what the cacique said. One of us has to go on the hunt. For a long moment, the two brothers stared defiantly at one another. Then [MASK] walked away, shaking his head.
<name>Uqbar</name>	Uqbar	Aute	We feared the swamps, the water lizards, and the berries of unfamiliar bushes. We feared not finding [MASK] and we feared finding it. At least the sick man no longer had such varied and constant reasons to worry: he could lose himself to the disease and forget everything else.
<name>Kunta</name>	Kunta	Guzman	Whoever heard of a slave who can read or write, much less draw maps? [MASK] heaved a sigh. Come now. I know you cannot read or write, but I am sure you know more than you are letting on. Here is a map of the province.
