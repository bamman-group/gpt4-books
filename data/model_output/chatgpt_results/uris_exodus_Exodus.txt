[MASK] assumed control of the ghetto and disposed of the Jewish Council.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Karen	The door was closed behind her and a soldier stood near. He opened a slot in the wall measuring a few inches wide and a few inches high. “You’ll talk to him through that slot there, girlie,” the guard said. [MASK] nodded and looked into it.
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Bruce	Yet when you see what they have done with this land you are not a realist if you do not believe in miracles.” “Oh, [MASK] ... if I only could believe that way.”' “What an army these Jews have!
<name>he</name>	he	Ari	The quiet from the village baffled them. More of them began to scream and point down at the village. Their curses and their anger rose in hysterical crescendo. “They’re trying to work themselves into a heroic lather,” [MASK] said.
<name>The miller</name>	The miller	Ari	He was spotted the instant he entered the village by a dozen Arab boys who were lying around near the coffeehouse. They waited till he turned the comer, then trailed him to the miller’s. [MASK] went about his business, flushed with his own importance.

<name>a child</name>	a child	Sandra	get. She planned to give birth to [MASK] in the springtime and that had been sensible too. She stifled spur-of-the-moment impulses in favor of planned decisions. These past two days seemed to make no sense to her at all.
<name>James</name>	James	Mark	Nine-forty. The Exodus passed between the lighthouse and the castle, through the narrow opening of the two arms of the sea wall, and into the Kyrenia harbor. Nine-fifty. “[MASK], please sit down. You’re making me nervous.”
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Kitty	It is going to be a long time before we know anything.” [MASK] finished her brandy and stretched back on the cot and closed her eyes. In her mind she saw that long line of men being lowered by rope with the sleeping children dangling from their backs.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Tom	He was another American tradition. [MASK] was the crew-cut kid with the boyish grin who could run the hundred in ten flat, sink a basket from thirty feet out, cut a rug, and put a Model A together blindfolded.
<name>Roark</name>	Roark	Jordana	She returned to the command-post bunker to find that [MASK] had gone. She stretched out on the cot again and covered her legs with a blanket. The vision of the men inching down the mountainside came to her once more. The day had left her spent She began to doze.
<name>Holly</name>	Holly	Kitty	ready to run?” [MASK] regarded him steadily for a moment. “Maybe because I don’t live by your simple, uncluttered standards of I-like-you-and-you-like-me-so-let’s-go-to-bed.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Karen	He felt he must not contaminate [MASK] with himself, yet he did not wish to cut off his only link with humanity. The times he would sink back again into bitterness he often stared at the blue tattoo number on his arm by the hour.
<name>the captain</name>	the captain	Fawdzi	The disguised Aliyah Bet agents then produced pistols and locked up [MASK] and the Arab crew. Later that day, when they had made further distance, the crew was given a compass, a map, and a rowboat and set adrift.
<name>Reuven</name>	Reuven	Sutherland	I know all that,” [MASK] said. “You men forget that the only thing that keeps those refugees from turning into a wild mob is the fact that these Palestinians are there. They run the schools, hospitals, kitchens, and everything else at that camp.
<name>David</name>	David	Joab	[MASK] sat cross-legged with his tambour before him. It was a clay drum with goatskin head. With his fingertips and the heels of his hand he beat a rhythm to a reed flute playing an ancient Hebraic melody.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Dov	The lights went out and the bunker became black and 130 silent. There was a knock in code. The door opened and closed and the lights were turned on again. “[MASK]! For God’s sake! What are you doing here?"
<name>María</name>	María	Mussa	“He has been badly wounded,” [MASK] said. “You will come?” “Yes,” she said. “Do not take medicine. We must be cautious. There are many British roadblocks and if they find medicine they will be suspicious.
<name>Zorro</name>	Zorro	Jossi	They were all too stunned to move. Never had they seen a man so powerful and fearless and angry. Showing utter disdain for their rifles, [MASK] turned his back on them, walked to his horse, mounted, and rode off.
<name>Sikes</name>	Sikes	Ari	[MASK] led five men with the captured turnkey to the death cells and the hanging room. The turnkey began to open the door. Inside the four guards who kept constant watch on the condemned pair began to fire at the iron door.

<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Ari	She had worked for thirty-five straight hours and her mind was muddled and dazed. [MASK] poured her a stiff brandy. “Go on and drink,” he said. “You aren’t on strike.” She swallowed it down, and a second drink brought her to her senses.
<name>Wyatt</name>	Wyatt	Dov	“There is a curtain in front of you,” a voice said. “Put your hands through it.” [MASK] pushed his hands through the cloth. One of his hands 398 was placed on a pistol and the other on a Bible.
<name>Mark</name>	Mark	Kitty	[MASK] had to change some currency, purchase a few things, and satisfy a lot of curiosity. Beyond the Mograbi Theater and plaza the road was filled with small shops, the honking and rushing of buses, cars, and people.
<name>Mrs. Jorgensen</name>	Mrs. Jorgensen	Karen	Once her children were calmed, [MASK] had more to think about. Many of them were becoming quite sick from the lack of air. She went topside and inched her way through the tangle of arms, legs, and knapsacks up to the captain’s bridge.
<name>Ben-Gurion</name>	Ben-Gurion	Jossi	[MASK] refused to be rattled. “We came in peace. We have purchased our land legally. We have built our settlements without disturbing anyone. Now if we start to arm, it will be a compromise with the basic idealism of Zionism and don’t pretend there is no risk in that.”
<name>She</name>	She	Kitty	“I’m going to poke around. It’s going to hurt.” “Go ahead.” He grunted and broke out in a cold sweat as she felt the lump. He gripped the brass rungs and shook the bed. [MASK] took her hand away quickly.
<name>partner</name>	partner	Bruce	“I’m getting out, [MASK].” “Then you’d better do it quickly. If you believe you can stay on much longer the way you have then you are living in a fool’s paradise.” “I can’t bring myself to it just yet.
<name>Patton</name>	Patton	Ari	[MASK] made a quick decision. “Driver. Can you drive through the fields here and get past that British unit?” “We’ll find out.” They careened off the road and banged and rattled through a field to encircle the area of action.
<name>Bin Laden</name>	Bin Laden	Kammal	His father had ignored his pleas to provide medical care for the girl; she was suffering from trachoma. [MASK]’s father reasoned that his son could have four wives and innumerable concubines, so why trouble himself with one miserable fellah woman.
<name>Ali</name>	Ali	Ari	You know right from wrong.” “I am a dirty ArabV’ “It is you who thinks that of himself.” “Are you going to tell me I am your brother?” “You always have been,” [MASK] said.
<name>Dr. Seward</name>	Dr. Seward	David	“He is such a strange man. He expects miracles ... he doesn’t tell anything.” “On the contrary,” [MASK] said, “he does not believe in miracles. That is why he works so hard.
<name>Mac</name>	Mac	Mandria	Broomsticks were rifles, rocks were grenades, bedsprings were bayonets. He set up courses in hand-to-hand fighting and stick fighting. Mostly he instilled tremendous spirit into the spiritless refugees. The hour grew very late. [MASK] began pacing nervously.
<name>I</name>	I	Kitty	Then it became quiet again with a stillness that [MASK] had never experienced. The bells from the carillon in the YMCA tower over the street played a hymn and the tones flooded the hills and the valleys. And then—again it became still.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ari	“Now listen,” [MASK] said, “I didn’t dream this up. The finish of this thing is less than four days off. That boy has us by the throat and he knows it. We can’t move unless he fixes those papers.”
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Avidan	“Something personal, maybe?” “Good Lord, no. Now turn your Jewish curiosity somewhere else.” The room was stuffy. [MASK] pulled out a large blue kerchief and mopped the sweat from his bald pate.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Taha	“That was a long time ago.” “Maybe I’ve got a long memory. We used to talk about it during the riots, how ridiculous it was for everyone else to fight. We took blood vows to be eternal brothers. [MASK] . . .
<name>Max</name>	Max	Ari	[MASK] spread a blanket on the grass at the edge of the auditorium and the two of them lay back and looked up into the sky and watched the enormous Lag Ba Omer moon grow smaller and higher and make room for a billion stars.
<name>He</name>	He	Barak	“I’ll make some tea,” she said, fondly mussing his hair. [MASK] took her wrist and pulled her down on his lap. She rested her head on his shoulder and then looked at him ques-tioningly, and he turned his eyes away.
<name>David</name>	David	Kitty	“There are some Palmach troops training at the Ein Or kibbutz.” “I’ve heard something about it,” [MASK] said. “We have a shortage of instructors. We have a shortage of everything, anyhow.
<name>Prisoner</name>	Prisoner	Dov	[MASK] could often look into the sky and see Russian bombers, and the secret radio began reporting German defeats. Hope, however dim, found its way through the muck and torture. Each new Allied victory sent the German guards into a murderous frenzy until the prisoners almost dreaded word of German defeats.
<name>Lenin</name>	Lenin	Art	We want to fight it out to the last man. We have decided.” “Good. I am glad.” “Give us more arms.” [MASK] leaped to his feet angrily. Twenty times a day he heard “give us more arms.”

<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Kitty	He cried out and bolted up to a sitting position and then gasped and sank down. “The sonofabitch is killing me!” He clutched the sheets and rolled over on his face and shook. He convulsed in pain for ten minutes, then fell limp. “[MASK] . . .
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Kitty	It seemed a natural step that she become personally involved in the cases of some of the more disturbed children from the Exodus.

<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Ari	The taxi stopped. [MASK] was quickly led into a house and into a room and was told he could remove the kerchief. The room was bare except for a Single chair, a single table which held a single flickering candle and a bottle of brandy and two glasses.
<name>The Mufti</name>	The Mufti	Kawukji	Nothing the Mufti could say or do could make them attack. [MASK] could not make them attack. In that first night three Haganah boys and one girl were killed in the fighting. One of them was the commander.
<name>Patton</name>	Patton	Ari	I have known you since you were a baby. You have been a fighter since you were fifteen years old. We haven’t enough men of your caliber. In all those years I’ve never known you to disobey an order.” [MASK] turned from the window.
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Karen	“I didn’t give them an answer,” he said. “I wanted to talk it over with you.” “Two years isn’t forever,” [MASK] said. “Why, by the time you get back the kibbutz will all be built up.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Kitty	“I told you ten times she wasn’t.” “They aren’t strong children to begin with and they’ve been cooped up on that ship for two weeks. They have no stamina 180 left.” [MASK] pulled nervously at a cigarette and tugged at her hair.
<name>She</name>	She	Kitty	[MASK] felt her stomach turn over. Then resentment took over and she fired back, eyes watering with anger. “You’ll stop at nothing.” “I’ll stop at nothing to show you how desperate we are.” They glared at each other wordlessly.
<name>Jumana</name>	Jumana	Ari	“Yes,” she said. “Do not take medicine. We must be cautious. There are many British roadblocks and if they find medicine they will be suspicious. [MASK] says to get the truck filled with children. Tomorrow there is a Druse wedding.

<name>Irgun</name>	Irgun	Kawukji	He would set up a road ambush after first having made certain of an avenue of retreat. When a bus, unarmed vehicle, or party small enough not to fight passed by, the Arabs would spring, loot, and flee. Soon [MASK] and the Mufti’s gangs had the entire country terrorized.
<name>John</name>	John	Barak	She limped slightly as she led him into the cottage. A scrappy, strapping, bright-eyed three-year-old boy looked up at him curiously. [MASK] knelt before the boy and held him up in his powerful hands.
<name>Solomon</name>	Solomon	David	tell me, tell me.” [MASK] whispered with his lips touching her ear, “Behold thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou has doves' eyes within thy locks . . . thy lips are like a thread of scarlet. .
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Dov	Many women threw their children over the rail beds and screamed to the curious onlooking peasants to take them and hide them. The dead were removed and stacked in six new cars added on at the end of the train. [MASK], though in very bad condition, was keen and alert.
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Dov	Of course, everyone in the Redeemers would be aunt and uncle to the baby but [MASK] would be the real one. There had been many marriages in the group and there were already three babies— all new Redeemers.
<name>people</name>	people	Yemenites	The line of [MASK] seemed endless. “Hey! What’s the score? How many of them do you think that plane will hold?” “We have a hundred and forty listed.” “What! You crazy? We won’t get that thing into the air.
<name>Lila</name>	Lila	Kitty	Did she have the right to take them up and just drop them, or did she have a further duty to them beyond her own personal desires? [MASK] quickly shut her mind to this line of thought. She opened her desk drawer and took out her passport.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Ari	what you must have suffered. Can I ever be forgiven for hurting you?” [MASK] was exhausted, drained. He walked along the edge of a stall. “I am not myself,” he mumbled. “Please do not let the others know about this.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Mark	After the divorce [MASK] moved East and began banging around from job to job, having matriculated from the world’s worst journalism student to the world’s worst newspaperman. He became one of those drifters who inhabit the newspaper world.
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Karen	[MASK] asked. “He had to go out on business. He’ll see us later this morning.” “What are we going to do today?” “Oh, a little of this and a little of that.”
<name>George</name>	George	Mark	“They have an unlimited capacity for getting into trouble. It’s their favorite sport,” [MASK] said, spinning off the bed and rubbing his temples. “Well . . . one way or the other we might as well eat and I’m hungry.”
<name>James Bond</name>	James Bond	Caldwell	He selected a GBD pipe from the rack and dipped it into a humidor of Dunhill mix. [MASK] thanked the brigadier for a cigar and the two men soon clouded the room in smoke. The Greek houseboy appeared in answer to a buzz. “Gin and tonic twice.”
<name>Ari</name>	Ari	Ari	What else is there to see?” “I saved the children’s compound for last. We have Pal-mach headquarters there.” As they entered the children’s compound [MASK] was once again pounced upon by a Palmachnik.
<name>Theodor</name>	Theodor	Herzl	They had to have a universal spokesman—they had to command respect and dignity as equals through a recognized government The paper in which he set down these ideas was called “The Jewish State.” Galvanized into action by this sudden calling, [MASK] drove himself unmercifully to gather support for his ideas.
<name>John</name>	John	Ari	We want to stay this time. We aren’t going to run again. Not even the old ones. This time they won’t have it easy, believe me ... but, [MASK], there is a limit to what can be asked of us.”
<name>He</name>	He	David	He folded the letter tenderly and carefully placed it in'his breast pocket to be read again and again, for it might be months before she could send another. “How is she?” [MASK] asked. . “I don’t see what my sister sees in you.
<name>Johnnie</name>	Johnnie	Kitty	The vision of the men inching down the mountainside came to her once more. The day had left her spent She began to doze. The hours passed. Midnight—one o’clock. [MASK], thrashed about on the cot. Her brain was filled with nightmare.
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Foster	she said. “They’re all throwing up in there.” [MASK] shut off the heat in the main cabin. “Get in there and open the air vents. I’ll try to get a little higher. The cold air will straighten them out.”
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Kammal	The girl went blind of the dread disease and died before her eighteenth birthday. This event made [MASK] a hater of his own class. It cut a scar so deep in his heart that he developed a social conscience.
<name>Two-Bear</name>	Two-Bear	Karen	You know what to expect and what to do. [MASK], and you other two chiefs with children . . . better wait here for special orders. Any questions?” There were none. “Any arguments?” There were none. “I’ll be damned.
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	MINNA	All that she had to do was to put them in the cabinet, close the drawer, and walk out of the door—forever. She opened the first folder and picked up the top paper and looked at her notes. [MASK] (SURNAME UNKNOWN), AGE 7.
<name>George</name>	George	Sutherland	He touched the roll of fat about his waist. Not too bad for a man of fifty-five. He still had plenty of punch left [MASK] had come up fast in World War II by comparison to the slow tedious advancements in the peacetime service.
<name>Maria</name>	Maria	Dov	They both leaned the rifles they carried against the wall and embraced and kissed. “Oh, [MASK]! At last!” “I’ve almost died from missing you,” he said. They kissed again and again ignoring the burning midday desert sun, ignoring everything but each other.
<name>Blackwood</name>	Blackwood	Maccabees	“It is not very slim. It is nil. Of course I know you [MASK] pride yourselves on being dead heroes. Unless you set up better getaway plans, that is what you’re going to become.”
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Karen	Aside from the fact that she was just plain stubborn, [MASK] clung to two great hopes. Her father had been a prominent man, and the Germans had kept one “prestige” camp where prisoners were neither tortured nor killed.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Karen	He would lie on his cot all day and wait anxiously for the sound of her footsteps coming down the cat-walk. He would sneak to the tent door and steal a glance in her direction. Often, [MASK] would glance at his tent, too, and their eyes would meet for a brief instant.
<name>Moses</name>	Moses	Avidan	The time has come to test these bloody heathens. Hebrews, that’s what I want . . . Hebrew soldiers. You arrange an appointment with [MASK] for me at once. Englishmen are too stupid to understand my methods.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Kitty	[MASK] asked. “I don’t know. Nothing like that has ever happened to me. I was listening to you and all of a sudden I couldn’t hear you or see you. It turned dark and a cold chill passed through me.”
<name>Jean Louise</name>	Jean Louise	Karen	Don’t go back to the way you were because of this.” “No,” he said. “I thought about it. I cannot hate them, because [MASK] could not hate them. She could not hate a living thing. We . . .
<name>but</name>	but	Ari	You have been good for her. I have been worried about this restlessness of hers.” “She is a very unhappy girl. No one can ever really know how much she loved that boy.” “When will it end?” “I don’t know, [MASK]
<name>she</name>	she	Kitty	He was glad that [MASK] couldn’t get to the airport to meet him. So much time had passed and there was so much to say and so much to remember. He felt a surge of excitement pass through him at the thought of seeing her again.
<name>he</name>	he	Ari	That is why he works so hard. It seems to me that there is more to this than [MASK] is telling us. I have a feeling that the escape of three hundred children is only part of what is in his mind.”
<name>Yusef</name>	Yusef	Kitty	With a final exertion of strength she gripped it and wiggled it loose from his leg. She sat on the floor and held the bullet up and looked at it and began laughing. All the Druse men started laughing too. [MASK] sobbed half hysterically.
<name>Dan</name>	Dan	Foster	boys, I said ... if you want a first class operation, you have to have a first-class chief pilot and I got the best goddam chief pilot any goddam airline . . .” “I’ll see you around,” [MASK] said, standing up quickly.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Mark	She reached into the night stand and took out a couple of sleeping pills, turned off the light, and lay back. [MASK] sat by the window and watched the surf slap against the shore. Twenty minutes passed.
<name>Israel</name>	Israel	Kitty	We have outlived everyone who has tried to destroy us. Can’t you see it, [MASK]? . . . this little land was chosen for us because it is the crossroads of the world, on the edge of man’s wilderness.
<name>him</name>	him	Karen	The finish of this thing is less than four days off. That boy has us by the throat and he knows it. We can’t move unless he fixes those papers.” “Talk to him . . . promise anything, but keep [MASK] here!”
<name>Bruno</name>	Bruno	Ari	He looked over at a blond boy, undersized and tense and suspicious at the sudden intrusion. [MASK] knew the look—the eyes filled with hate. He studied the turned-down mouth and the snarling lips of the youngster: the ex-38 pression of viciousness that stamped so many of the concentration-camp people.
<name>Lawrence</name>	Lawrence	Jossi	[MASK] knew that it would be only a matter of time until trouble broke out. As soon as the Bedouins learned they had lost their jobs they were certain to strike. He concocted a plan designed to avert trouble.
<name>Hannah</name>	Hannah	Sarah	The Zionist Settlement Society had been forced to close its offices and most Jewish activity had stopped. “How soon, darling?” [MASK] asked. “We must be gone by daybreak. You are only to pack one small handbag. We must leave everything behind.”

<name>Che Guevara</name>	Che Guevara	Barak	“What do you think, [MASK]?” “We will know when they come to the next three South American countries.” “I think we shall have to start pulling away. We are near the halfway mark and we show no decided strength,”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Dov	[MASK] obeyed. He felt the presence of two men behind him. A blindfold was tied over his eyes and two pairs of hands led him down the stairs to a waiting car where he was shoved on the back floor and covered and driven from the Old City.
<name>Hemingway</name>	Hemingway	Mark	At the time I was covering: war, revolution, insurrection. That particular night I had a: blonde, brunette, redhead (or maybe that broad with two heads). The man stood nose to nose with [MASK], gushing on all eight cylinders now.
<name>Thor</name>	Thor	Ari	Moments passed until the quaking within her abated and her breathing became normal. [MASK] stood over her and stared down. “You must hate me,” she said at last. He did not speak. She looked up at his towering figure and saw the hurt on his face.
<name>David</name>	David	Jossi	The elders of the ghetto met and came to a decision. “We have reason to fear that you two were spotted,*’ the rabbi said when he returned. “Your red hair, [MASK], was seen by some students.”
