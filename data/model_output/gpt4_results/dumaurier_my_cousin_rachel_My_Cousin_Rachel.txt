<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Seecombe	Presently - the time seemed endless but it may not have been more than ten minutes or so — the voices grew louder and they passed into the hall, and I heard [MASK] opening the front door, bidding them good night, and the wheels drive away, and the clanging and bolting of the door.
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Louise	Not ever.’ I put the drawing back upon the bureau, and the letter too. ‘If there is no proof,’ said [MASK], ‘you cannot condemn her. She may be innocent. She may be guilty. You can do nothing.
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Tamlyn	I have the lists here with me, and where he wished them to go, and I thought it would save time if I talked over the fist with [MASK], and explained what everything was. I may be gone when the carrier brings the load.’
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Louise	There should have been someone in the house, a housekeeper, a distant relative, anyone. You have grown up ignorant of women, and if you ever marry it will be hard on your wife. I was saying so to [MASK] at breakfast.’
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Seecombe	And after dinner, when my godfather summoned [MASK] and the servants to tell them of the various bequests, I went and sat with her in the drawing-room. ‘My godfather is displeased with me,’ I said, and told her the story.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Louise	The vapour from the boggy valley rose in a white cloud, and I realised, with a shudder, how cold I had been the livelong day, since I had sat with [MASK] in the church, and all the while in the fireless parlour at the Rose and Crown.
<name>Giuseppe</name>	Giuseppe	Giuseppe	But it was not to be. ‘You went to the villa,’ she said, as though talking to herself. ‘[MASK] must have let you in. He would open up the gates and see you standing there, and he would think...’
<name>He</name>	He	Rachel	[MASK] past the byre and the midden and through the gates at all, up on the stubble of the west hills. The Barton lands form a peninsula, the beacon fields forming the further end of it and the sea running into bays, east and west, on either side.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Rachel	I held out my hands to her. ‘[MASK]. Come here,’ I said. She came across the room to me, and she put her hands in mine. ‘There is no bitter feeling in this house,’ I said to her.
<name>Marianne</name>	Marianne	Rachel	My footsteps crunched slightly on the gravel path. I heard a voice call down to me, ‘Do you often go walking in the woods at night?’ It was my cousin [MASK]. She was sitting, without a light, at the open window of the blue bedroom.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Philip	‘I wasn’t angry, [MASK].’ ‘But you were. I thought you were going to hit me.’ She looked up at me. ‘Sometimes you are so stupid,’ she said, ‘that I think one day I shall.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Ambrose	It came upon me strongly and with force, and for the first time since I had learnt of [MASK]’s death, that everything I now saw and looked upon belonged to me. I need never share it with anyone living.
<name>Jenkins</name>	Jenkins	Wellington	I took the envelope from the bag and sent the boy on home. As [MASK] whipped up the horses I drew out the scrap of paper and held it to the window for light. The words were scrawled, almost illegible.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Heaven	[MASK] knows I could have done with less of you at times.’ I looked back at her, and slowly smiled. ‘Did you make pictures too?’ I asked her. ‘I never stopped,’ she said.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Louise	I don’t know why I say this to you, but I feel I must.’ And then he witnessed my signature on the long scroll of paper. ‘I suppose,’ he said, ‘you will not wait to see [MASK]?’
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Louise	The hood concealed her face, but the blue eyes looked out at me, though the rest was hidden. ‘A wife,’ said [MASK], ‘cannot send her husband’s money from the country, nor return to the place where she belongs.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Rainaldi	Then, with a word or an action, all is lost again. I will come down to the terrace and find [MASK] there. At sight of me, both fall silent. I cannot but wonder what it is they have been discussing.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Louise	We never had visitors, and it was connected in my mind with some game of hide-and-seek, long since, when [MASK] had come over with my godfather one Christmas. I could remember creeping into the silent room and hiding beneath the bed, amongst the dust.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Seecombe	I went and sat on my chair in the office. I wrote no letters, I saw no one. Some time after midday [MASK] came to find me to tell me that the ladies were awaiting luncheon. I said I wanted none.
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Philip	Her voice sounded quite different. Oddly strained. ‘Doing?’ I said. ‘Nothing. Why?’ ‘Don’t He, [MASK]. You don’t know how.’ I stood most wretchedly before the fire, staring anywhere but in those searching accusing eyes.
<name>Travers</name>	Travers	Madam	‘Well?’ I said. He wore his new-found look of self-importance, and his voice was hushed. ‘[MASK] has come,’ he said. ‘So I would suppose,’ I answered, ‘it must be nearly seven.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Ambrose	As a lad I had always wished to be called [MASK], and the wish had remained with me, I think, until the present. Now I was glad that my name went back even farther into the past than his had done.
<name>him</name>	him	Ambrose	Sometimes she read a passage out to me and told me how this paragraph had pleased [MASK]; or she showed me a picture, an engraving, and I saw her smiling at some well-remembered page. She came upon a volume of drawings of the lay-out of gardens.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Philip	Would you like to see the coverings, [MASK], or does it not interest you?’ She put the question to me half hopefully, half anxiously, as though wishing for my opinion, yet fearing I should be bored.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Rachel	If he cannot stand upon his own feet, he must learn to do so. Am I not right?’ he asked me. ‘Perfectly.’ ‘Women, especially [MASK], act always from emotion. We men, more usually though not always so, with reason.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Ambrose	She suddenly looked very tired. She leant back in her chair, and resting her head against the cushion closed her eyes. ‘Finding religion does not always improve a person,’ she said, ‘waking to the world did not help [MASK]. His nature changed.’
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Louise	Already I was looking through the bureau, more thoroughly than I was able to do the night before by candlelight. ‘Why did you not warn my father?’ said [MASK]. ‘If she is guilty, he could accuse her with greater force than you?’
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Louise	She nodded. ‘That was terrible,’ she agreed, ‘he must have felt so lonely.’ My heart warmed to [MASK]. Perhaps it was because she was young, my own age, that she seemed to have so much more perception than her father.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Louise	I hope you apologised for your bad manners on Saturday.’ ‘Yes, I apologised,’ I said, ‘but it did not seem to make much difference. I have never met [MASK] in so vile a humour. By the way, she thinks you are beautiful.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Louise	She ran on and on, going over in her mind a whole fist of improvements, until I lost patience with her and said roughly, ‘For heaven’s sake, [MASK], leave the subject alone. I’m sick and tired of it.’
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Louise	It will look better.’ ‘Excellent,’ I said, ‘and I will go to the bank. Thank you, uncle.’ ‘Don’t forget to see [MASK] before you go,’ he said; ‘I think she is somewhere in the house.’
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Louise	[MASK] was sheltering beneath the porch. I opened the heavy door and we went in together, to the church itself. It seemed dark and peaceful, after the bluster of the day without, yet with it too that chill so unmistakable, oppressive, heavy, and the mouldering churchy smell.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Rachel	I wanted to tell him there and then that [MASK] and I were to be married, I was so bursting with delight and happiness, but a certain hesitation held me back; the matter was too solemn and too delicate to thrust upon him unawares, and maybe we should tell him together.
<name>I</name>	I	Wellington	When we had eaten luncheon she would go upstairs to rest, or if it was a Tuesday or a Thursday I might order the carriage for her, and [MASK] would drive her about the neighbourhood to return the calls that had been made upon her.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Seecombe	The blue bedroom should live up to its name. At present it is grey, not blue at all. And the quilting to the bed has moth, but don’t tell [MASK]. The moth of years. I have chosen you new curtains and new quilting.’
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Seecombe	‘I am sorry,’ I said. ‘Since entering by window I have grown casual about doors. In fact, my manners have forsaken me.’ ‘You had better go,’ she said, ‘before [MASK] comes up to take my tray.
<name>She</name>	She	Heaven	[MASK] only knew, I wished the girl no harm, and that she might find herself a husband. ‘I think,’ she said, ‘that your godfather disapproves of me, which he has a perfect right to do, but by the end of luncheon I think we understood one another very well.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Rachel	‘My promise?’ she said. ‘What promise?’ ‘To marry me, [MASK],’ I answered. She had her candlestick in her hand. She raised it, so that the naked flame showed on my face.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Fie	[MASK] moved about, mysterious and solemn, with hushed footsteps — he had even bought himself a pair of soft-soled slippers - and bits of silver I had never seen in my life before were borne into the dining-room and placed on the table, or on the sideboard.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Rachel	Therefore it was out of my hands. It was the responsibility of my godfather. He was trustee to the estate, and my guardian. Therefore it was for him to approach my cousin [MASK] and make some sort of provision for her out of the estate.
<name>London</name>	London	Pelyn	‘To [MASK],’ she said, ‘to see your godfather.’ All the worries and perplexities, safely buried in the depths, came rushing to the fore-front of my mind, and with a sharp misgiving I wondered what they could do, between them, to make havoc of my plans.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Seecombe	‘Why yes,’ I said, ‘who could help but like them?’ ‘Then they are yours,’ she told me, ‘they are a present to you, from me. Take them away, [MASK].
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Rachel	Just as well. The money can be better spent on other things. She tells me much has been already done about the grounds, since my last visit. Knowing [MASK], I can well believe it. But I must see first, before I give approval.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Seecombe	‘Come,’ she said, ‘shall we open the clothes trunk first?’ Her voice was purposely hard and practical. I handed her the keys, which she had left in [MASK]’s charge on her arrival. ‘Just as you will,’ I said.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Seecombe	I shaved and dressed and went down to my breakfast, which was now cold upon the sideboard — [MASK] thinking I had long descended — but hard-boiled eggs and ham made easy fare. I could have eaten anything that day.
<name>Clarence</name>	Clarence	Ambrose	‘Tell me,’ I said, ‘supposing that [MASK] had made a will leaving the property to you for your lifetime, with the proviso that during that lifetime I looked after the estate and ran it for you, what would you have done?’
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Philip	‘I see. And do I sit alone here in the drawing-room, or do you sit with me, [MASK]?’ ‘You sit alone. They will call upon you, not me. Receiving the county is not part of a man’s work.’
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Rachel	‘I never found it so,’ said [MASK]. ‘The shutters would be closed early in the morning, which kept the villa cool throughout the day. We adapt ourselves to the climate. Anyone who stirs without in the middle of the day asks for disaster; so we stay within, and sleep.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Rachel	‘They wouldn’t think it right to do so.’ ‘What nonsense! Why should women suffer?’ said my cousin [MASK]. Sometimes, in the afternoons, she would be called upon by the county, as I had warned her.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Seecombe	Outside the sun beat down upon the lawns. It was very warm. A lazy bumble-bee droned against one of the windows. The visitors sat down, languid, and content to rest. [MASK] brought cake and wine.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Seecombe	As I rubbed myself dry with the towel I noticed that on the table beside my bed was a bowl of flowers. Sprigs from the woods, orchids and cyclamen amongst them. No one had ever put flowers in my room before. [MASK] would not have thought of it, or the boys either.
<name>disappointment</name>	disappointment	Sunday	I only rode over to see my godfather on a business matter.’ ‘Oh,’ she said, ‘I see.’ Her expression, that had been cheerful and natural at sight of me, turned back to the stiff look of [MASK].
<name>Lucien</name>	Lucien	Louise	Flow much longer was he going to stay? How many more days and nights of this must I endure? Eventually, on the last evening of his visit, my godfather, with [MASK], came to dine. The evening passed off well, or so it seemed.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Philip	‘There you are, [MASK],’ he said, ‘it’s what we all come to in the end. Some upon a battlefield, some in bed, others according to their destiny. There’s no escape. You can’t leam the lesson too young.
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Seecombe	Both the ladies are in the drawing-room now.’ ‘No, [MASK]. I slept badly last night. I shall be better in the morning.’ ‘I will tell the mistress,’ he said, ‘she will be much concerned.’
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Seecombe	She took hers, and I lighted the candle for her. It was dark in the hall but above, on the landing, [MASK] had left a light to the further corridor. ‘That will do,’ she said. ‘I can find my way alone.’
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Rachel	There was little in the letter that I can’t say now to your face. It was merely thanking you, for [MASK]’s sake, and assuring you that I would take great care to see there was no great loss to you in the transaction.
<name>He</name>	He	Ambrose	Perhaps he suffered too. [MASK], those eighteen years ago, went striding down the avenue, and I in wake of him. He may well have worn the jacket I am wearing now. This old green shooting jacket, with the leather padding on the elbows.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Philip	The prospect of this interview was not as pleasing as that of the morning had been; nevertheless, I was undaunted. My godfather was at home, and in his study. ‘Well, [MASK],’ he said, ‘if I am a few hours premature, no matter.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Rachel	Eventually, you will find we shall hand the property back to you with double value. However, that’s in the distant future. And you by that time, no doubt, with grown sons of your own. [MASK] and myself, old people in wheeled chairs.’
<name>Olga</name>	Olga	Rachel	Yet as I looked at them, not liking to touch them even with my finger, I remembered, with disappointment, that [MASK] was in mourning, and wore no coloured stones. If I presented her with these, it would be pointless; she would have no use for them.
<name>Veronica</name>	Veronica	Ambrose	I did not return at once to the house. I climbed up through the woods to a path that runs above that part of the estate, bordering the Trenant acres and the wooded avenue. [MASK] had been fonder of this walk than any other.
<name>Williams</name>	Williams	Seecombe	I went in, through the back entrance across the court, and as my feet sounded on the flags [MASK] came out to me from the steward’s room, with consternation on his face. ‘I am glad you have come, sir,’ he said.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Ambrose	And there are [MASK]’s things to go through and sort.’ ‘I thought you could do that by yourself,’ she said. ‘Why,’ I said, ‘when we could do it both of us together?’
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Rachel	I think only [MASK] and myself noticed his tone of voice. She glanced at my godfather, puzzled, and from him to me, and was about to speak when I moved forward. ‘I think the carriages have come,’ I said.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Rachel	We had dined there once or twice, and my godfather had sparkled in a way unknown to me. But he had been a widower for ten years. Surely he could not entertain so incredible an idea as to fancy his chance with my cousin [MASK]?
<name>She</name>	She	Louise	Perhaps she was two persons, tom in two, first one having sway and then the other. I did not know. [MASK] would say that she had been the second always. That from the very first every thought, every move, had some premeditation.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Seecombe	‘Perhaps [MASK] doesn’t consider them high society,’ she said. ‘I’m very flattered. I like my tea. You can eat the bread and butter.’ This too was an innovation. Pieces of thin bread, rolled like small sausages.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Philip	‘No,’ I said, ‘why the devil should you do so?’ ‘Please, [MASK],’ she said. She took off the collar and gave it to my godfather. He had the grace to look uncomfortable, yet relieved too.
<name>he</name>	he	Ambrose	It is not a happy one.’ I was about to say, ‘No, [MASK] was more reserved than you ever knew. If there was something that hurt him, that shocked him, he would pretend it was not there, that it had not happened.
<name>Sebastian</name>	Sebastian	Ambrose	Putting out my pipe, rising to my feet, making an effort at conversation, drilling myself to the rigours and tedium of feminine society. And watching [MASK], my god, behaving like a ninny, so that I should have to leave the room from sheer embarrassment.
<name>Stevenson</name>	Stevenson	Ambrose	This was his chair.’ He pointed, almost with reverence, to a tall high-backed chair beside the table. I watched him in a dream. None of this held reality. I could not see [MASK] in this house, or in this room.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	1	The matter is a delicate one, of course. I must have time to think this out, how to approach the business.’ [MASK] became impatient. I knew his cautious legal frame of mind. He would fiddle-faddle with the job for days.
<name>kleptomania</name>	kleptomania	kleptomania	I reached for a dictionary, and looked up [MASK]. ‘An irresistible tendency to theft in persons not tempted to do it by needy circumstances.’ That was not his accusation. His accusation was one of prodigality, of extravagance. How could extravagance be a malady?
<name>Albertine</name>	Albertine	Louise	My godfather came to see me, also [MASK]. They too assumed an unaccustomed manner, a blend of cheerfulness and sympathy, suited to a child who had been sick; and I felt they had been warned not to touch upon any subject that might cause me concern.
<name>James</name>	James	Seecombe	I scribbled my letter, and went into the hall to place it in the post-bag for the morning. [MASK] had left the bag for me, as was his custom, upon the table in the hall, with the key beside it.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Lord	Scratching away there with his pen at sums and figures, reckoning up shillings and pence, how much the estate could afford. [MASK]! how I hated money. ‘Hurry, sir,’ I said, ‘and write your letter. Then I can take it back with me.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Philip	‘Surely,’ he said, ‘you don’t begrudge her the books and clothes? Hang it all, [MASK], it’s all she has.’ ‘How do you mean,’ I asked, ‘it’s all she has?’
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Ambrose	‘[MASK] had described it all so well to me,’ she said, ‘from the entrance hall to every room in the house. He even sketched them for me, so that to-day, I well believe, I could find my way blindfold.’
<name>Forster</name>	Forster	Ambrose	In the letter, buried beneath the granite, [MASK] had said, ‘With a woman, these things go deeper.’ As I scratched upon the piece of paper I saw that I had written the words, ‘It made no odds... it made no odds.’
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Rachel	I handed my cousin [MASK] into the carriage and took my place beside her. She had a dark mantle around her shoulders, and the veil from her hat concealed her face. ‘The people will want to see your face,’ I said to her.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Philip	I am glad of the opportunity to have a word with you, [MASK].’ I crossed over to the fireplace and stood there, with my hands behind my back. ‘Yes?’ I said. ‘What is it?’ He did not answer for a moment.
<name>Lucia</name>	Lucia	Rachel	Tonight, [MASK] and I would walk the passages alone. I came downstairs and waited in the drawing-room. I felt some trepidation, as I stood there, for never in my life had I given a present to a woman.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Philip	That boy who understands him, when I fail. That boy who holds three-quarters of his heart, and all the best of him. While I hold one-third, and all the worst. Oh, [MASK]...’ She broke off, and smiled again at me.
<name>Godmother</name>	Godmother	Louise	‘You will behave yourself to-day, or I shall walk out of the church,’ she said to me. ‘Then everyone would think you had the vapours,’ I said, ‘and my godfather and [MASK] would come rushing to your assistance.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Philip	I wanted the matter over, done with. My ears were awake for the sound of footsteps on the stairs. ‘Another thing,’ he said, uneasily. ‘You had no right, [MASK], to take that collar from the bank.
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Louise	Sufficient flowers were brought in first thing from the walled garden.’ ‘I can arrange them, then,’ said [MASK]; ‘your men will only break the vases. I suppose you have vases. Or have they been cramming the flowers into jam-pots?’
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Philip	‘When,’ she said, ‘I entertain your friends, I look to have a little support from you. What was wrong, [MASK]? You sat there scowling, with a mulish face, and never addressed a word to either neighbour. Those poor girls...’
<name>Flora</name>	Flora	Gypsy	We were more sheltered here, but scarce had gone a hundred yards before [MASK] suddenly hobbled and went lame, and rather than go into the lodge and have the business of removing the stone that had cut into her shoe, and having gossip there, I decided to dismount and lead her gently home.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Dobson	‘If you do not wish to seem mixed up in the affair,’ he said to me, ‘you had better not take the letter. [MASK] has to go your way this afternoon. He can take the letter for me. It will look better.’
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mary	‘It was an odd day to choose to go out riding. The carriage was nearly blown from the road when I went down to call at the Rectory. As you see, we have the good fortune to have [MASK] here as visitor. She is already quite at home.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ambrose	I wished suddenly that I could remember her. Why was it that a child’s mind could not return beyond a certain limit? I had been a little boy, staggering after [MASK], shouting to him to wait for me. Nothing before that. Nothing at all...
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Ambrose	Above all, write not a word in answer, only come. ‘One thought possesses me, leaving me no peace. Are they trying to poison me? - [MASK].’ This time I did not put the letter back into the pocket book.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Solomon	It caused quite a pother and excitement, the choice of the saddle; this one was too worn, the next too narrow for [MASK]’s broad back, and the lad was scolded because the third had a cobweb across it.
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Wellington	We shall be about two hours, [MASK].’ And taking the bridle I set off with her to tour the Barton acres. The wind of the day before had blown itself up-country, taking the rain with it, and at noon the sun had broken through and the sky was clear.
<name>Despard</name>	Despard	Ambrose	I felt in my pockets for some money. I might have been anyone, a casual traveller upon the continent, visiting a villa from curiosity with a view to purchase. Not myself. Not looking for the first and last time on the place where [MASK] had lived and died.
<name>Forbes</name>	Forbes	Ambrose	‘Quite so,’ I answered, ‘but it is in [MASK]’s hand, is it not?’ ‘Why, yes,’ he replied, ‘undoubtedly. What I do not understand is why he never had it witnessed and sent to me.
<name>Albertine</name>	Albertine	Rainaldi	After dinner we went up to her boudoir. She prepared the tisana, as usual, and set it down in its cup on the table by my side, and hers as well. On the bureau lay [MASK]’s letter, half covered by her handkerchief.
<name>George</name>	George	Ambrose	When they had left the room I did something that I very rarely did. Only after extreme exhaustion, after riding perhaps, or a hard day’s shoot, or buffeting about in a summer gale in the sailing boat with [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Tamlyn	‘There is plenty of time to decide about these things,’ she said. ‘First, you must get well and strong.’ I looked at her, puzzled. Then [MASK] had not been entirely in error.
