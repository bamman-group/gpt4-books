<name>Alice</name>	Alice	America	[MASK] pulled on my arm. “C’mon. Let’s go." She didn’t waste time tugging me to her car. When she put the gear in drive, I grabbed her wrist. “Wait! Where are we going?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Parker	[MASK]’s cheeks flushed a faint red. “I suppose I’m really not invited, now.” "No! Of course you are!” I said, holding his hand on top of the table. Twelve pairs of eyes zeroed in on our hands.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Mare	"You’re going to call me tomorrow, right?” he said, touching the windshield. "Just go, [MASK],” I said, refusing to meet his eyes. The night was long. I kept looking at the clock and cringed when I saw that another hour had passed.
<name>Finnick</name>	Finnick	Trenton	The room darkened, and a loud popping noise sounded from another side of the room. The other lanterns were igniting and adding to the fire in small explosions. [MASK] grabbed my arm, pulling me behind him as he tried to force his way through the crowd.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Parker	He hummed in his amazing deep voice and gripped me so tight that it was difficult to breathe. He pulled back, breathless. "Call [MASK]. Tell him you don’t wanna see him anymore. Tell him you’re with me." I closed my eyes.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Pidge	"That’s a lot of money, [MASK].” "No." His head jerked in my direction. "This is my decision. I don’t think you're looking at the big picture.” "I think you’ve lost your damn mind.”
<name>Elvis</name>	Elvis	Travis	The whole room chanted in harmony. [MASK] jerked his hips, and a few whistles and squeals from the girls in the room fired off. He walked by me again, singing the chorus to the other side of the room, the football players his backup singers.
<name>Bella</name>	Bella	Travis	I was gushing, and it wasn’t like me to gush. I kept thinking about how perfect he had been since the moment we’d met. He was exactly what I needed: the polar opposite of [MASK]. “Rendered you speechless?” she giggled.
<name>him</name>	him	Travis	I should just get used to it, now, right?" I shrugged and he shook his head. "All right, were already late. Let’s go.” I huddled next to [MASK] for warmth as we walked from the car to the Sigma Tau house.
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Mare	"[MASK], don’t leave early. We’re fine.” "I have to see you. I have to hug you so I’ll know you’re all right,” she cried. "We're fine. You can hug me on Friday.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Parker	[MASK] lifted my wrist. "You wore it.” "I said I would. Wanna dance?” He shook his head. "Uh ... I don’t dance.” "Oh. Well, you wanna witness my sixth shot of Patron?”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	America	"We’ll be making our money back now. We don’t appreciate being hustled.” “Do your worst.” I smiled. “You have ten minutes,” [MASK] whispered. “I know,” I said.
<name>Big Dan</name>	Big Dan	Benny	But I’m in love with this girl, and I can’t let you hurt her.” [MASK] burst into a loud cackle. “I gotta hand it to you, son. You’ve got the biggest balls of anyone that’s come through those doors.
<name>him</name>	him	Travis	I'll see you there.” “You want me to ask someone else? And you’re going with [MASK]. Do you not see how completely absurd that is?” I crossed my arms, ready for a fight. “I told him I would go before you
<name>her</name>	her	Parker	He wanted to prove to [MASK] that I was still his. His. “I’m nobody's,” I said to the empty room. As the words sunk in, I was overwhelmed with the grief I’d felt from the night before.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Mick	But when I do, I want you to leave me the hell alone. I won't do this again, [MASK]. From now on, you’re on your own, do you hear me? Stay. Away.” He pressed his lips together and then nodded.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Travis	I clenched my teeth together, forbidding myself to cry. “I can’t.” [MASK]’s face crumpled. I took the opportunity to walk around him, but he sidestepped to stand in my way. “I haven’t slept, or ate ...
<name>Becky</name>	Becky	America	[MASK] shot him a warning glare and his laugh turned into a nervous chuckle. "I mean ... what an asshole." We laughed at his regretful expression as he watched her stomp to the buffet line, following quickly after.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Travis	“What do you need, [MASK]?” I tried to make my tone sharp, but it was softened by my relief to hear his voice. "I wanna go bowling tomorrow. I need my partner.” "Bowling? You couldn’t have called me later?”
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Travis	I walked slowly to the cafeteria, in no hurry to suffer the stares of those at the tables. The entire school was abuzz with the breakup, and [MASK]’s volatile behavior didn't help. Just when the lights of the cafeteria came into view, I saw a dark figure approach.
<name>Darling</name>	Darling	Travis	Tell him you’re with me." I closed my eyes. "I can’t be with you, [MASK]." “Why the hell not?” he said, letting go. I shook my head, afraid of his reaction to the truth.
<name>me</name>	me	Benny	"So you’ll come? You’ll help me?" I shrugged. "Sure.” His attention was diverted from the intoxicating lights below, and I allowed myself to hope that he would see how wrong he was about [MASK] after all.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Travis	[MASK] took several drags from his cigarette, and when it was obvious that he wasn’t going to explain, my patience ran out. “Why did you do that?” I asked. "Why? Because he was mauling you in front of my apartment!”
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Mare	"He’s miserable, [MASK]. He loves you.” Her eyes filled with tears and her bottom lip quivered. "I don’t care." "Yes, you do." “I know," she whimpered, leaning against my shoulder.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Travis	“I have to uh ... I have to call my dad,” [MASK] said, his eyebrows pulling together as he opened his cell phone. I took a breath, hoping my voice would sound stronger than I felt.
<name>Hardin</name>	Hardin	Travis	My mouth fell open. "Great! So I’m the school slut now?” [MASK]’s eyes darkened and his jaws tensed. "This is my fault. If it was anyone else, they wouldn’t be saying that about you.”
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Travis	I've never had a girl sleep with me to get me to leave her alone,” he said, keeping his back to me. “That’s not what it was, [MASK],” I lied, ashamed that he had guessed my intentions without realizing how right he was.
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	TRAVIS	"[MASK]!” I cried. I scrambled off the desk and ran across the floor to where he stood, exhausted and filthy. I slammed into him, and he wrapped his arms around me, coughing as he gasped for air. His hands grabbed my cheeks.
<name>he</name>	he	Travis	“That’s my point. I was pissed because I took that as him wanting to sleep with you.” After processing what [MASK] meant, I grabbed the sides of his shirt and pressed my forehead against his chest. "You know what?
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	America	When we returned to the apartment, every surface had been covered with bouquets of roses. Reds, pinks, yellows, and whites—it looked like a floral shop. "Oh my God!” [MASK] squealed when she walked through the door.
<name>Heather</name>	Heather	Travis	It was hard to focus on the topic at hand with the diamonds of my bracelet creating tiny dots of light on the ceiling of the car, reminding me of the choice I was suddenly faced with. [MASK] wanted an answer, and I didn’t have one.
<name>Asher</name>	Asher	Travis	I shook my head. “No, thanks. I’m here with my—” "Boyfriend,” [MASK] said, appearing out of nowhere. He glared at the men standing in front of us, and they backed away a bit, clearly intimidated.
<name>Heather</name>	Heather	Parker	Don't let him fuck you in a car like a cheap prom date.” “I wasn't going to have sex with him!” He gestured to the empty space where [MASK]'s car sat. "What were you doing, then?”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Benny	“The usual.” "I wish I could help. We go way back, and you know I respect your dad, but you know I can't let you stay." I grabbed his arm and squeezed. "He owes [MASK] money."
<name>Bella</name>	Bella	Pigeon	“You’ll see, [MASK]. It’s going to be great.” He pushed off the bed, walked over to me, and kissed my fingers. “I’m starved. You hungry?” I shook my head and he kissed my forehead before making his way to the kitchen.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	AMERICA	[MASK] AND I SPENT THE AFTER-noon downtown, primping and indulging. We had our nails and toes done, errant hairs waxed, skin bronzed, and hair highlighted. When we returned to the apartment, every surface had been covered with bouquets of roses.
<name>Teddy</name>	Teddy	America	Those ten or so members would text ten members on their list, and so on, until every member knew exactly where the floating fight ring would be held. "Here we go," [MASK] said, smiling. "We’d better freshen up!”
<name>he</name>	he	Travis	My eyes traveled upward; jeans spattered with blood, a set of finely chiseled abs, a bare, tattooed chest drenched in sweat, and finally a pair of warm, brown eyes. I was shoved from behind, and [MASK] caught me by the arm before I fell forward.
<name>Ross</name>	Ross	Shepley	"In his defense,” [MASK] began, "he really didn’t think you guys were gonna break up. He thought you'd come around. It was too late by the time he figured out that you were serious."
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Travis	"Do you know how many humiliated girls I’ve taken home from parties after they've spent a few hours alone in a room with him? He's going to hurt you." [MASK]'s fingers tightened in reaction, and I rested my hand on his until he relaxed.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Travis	" I pulled my coat around me and pulled at the handles of the French doors. I was too upset to slow down long enough to coordinate pushing down the handles while pulling at the doors at the same time. Just as frustrated tears fell down my frozen cheeks, [MASK]’s hand covered mine.
<name>Connor</name>	Connor	Pidge	“No one thinks were together, [MASK]. You don’t have to quit talking to me to prove a point.” We engaged in a tug-of-war with the tote, and when he refused to let go, I growled loudly in frustration.
<name>he</name>	he	Ethan	My back slammed into the wall once more. "I wasn't finished talking to you,” [MASK] said, scanning my wet shirt. I pulled his hand from the back of my jeans, digging in my nails. “Let go!”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Travis	When I sat down, the leather felt cold beneath me, and I wondered how many people had sat in that same chair, moments from their death. I reached over to grab [MASK]’s hand, and he gave me a reassuring squeeze.
<name>Timothy</name>	Timothy	Shepley	I love him! You got me a puppy!” "It's a cairn terrier. I had to drive three hours to pick him up Thursday after class.” "So when you said you were going with [MASK] to take his car to the shop ...’’
<name>any name</name> (There is no specific name given in the passage)	any name (There is no specific name given in the passage)	Parker	It wasn’t fair, and I’m sorry.” "I’m not interested in dating, [MASK]," I warned. He chuckled. "I’m not trying to take advantage. Were still friends, and I want to make sure that you’re okay.
<name>him</name>	him	Travis	After a few moments of shocked silence, he hung up in my ear. My eyes still focused on the pavement, I handed [MASK] his phone and then reluctantly peered up at his expression. A combination of confusion, shock, and adoration scrolled across his face.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Pidge	“What's wrong, [MASK]? Hard day?” "No, I’m thoroughly disgusted.” "With me?" He was smiling. I should have known that he expected the conversation. It only made me less inclined to hold back.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Parker	“Do you live in the House?’’ [MASK] nodded. "The last two years. I need to get an apartment, though. I need a quieter place to study.” “Let me guess ... Business major?” “Biology, with a minor in Anatomy.
<name>Mr. Porter</name>	Mr. Porter	FINCH	I had no right to be angry, but it didn't help me to ignore the pain. [MASK] SHOOK HIS HEAD WHEN I SAT IN THE DESK BESIDE him. I knew that I looked awful; I barely had the energy to change clothes and brush my teeth.
<name>probably</name> (There is no clear proper name in this sentence, so this is a guess based on the context.)	probably (There is no clear proper name in this sentence, so this is a guess based on the context.)	Parker	I had a hard time meeting his glare. "I can’t do that to him, [MASK], I’m sorry.” “Do you understand what a date party is? It’s something you go to with your boyfriend.” His patronizing tone made any empathy
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Travis	"I do. He was arrested last year for sexual battery, but the charges were dropped.” I crossed my arms. "Oh, so you have something in common?" [MASK]’s eyes narrowed, and the muscles in his jaws twitched under his skin.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Mick	What in the hell were you ...” I took a breath; there was no point. "I don’t have that kind of money, [MASK]." He smiled. "Something tells me you do." “Well, I don't!
<name>Jasper</name>	Jasper	Adam	The bed concaved when he finally crawled onto the mattress beside me, and I stiffened when his hand rested on my hip. “I missed a fight tonight," he said. “[MASK] called. I didn't go.” “Why?"
<name>hers</name>	hers	America	"He’s a good friend, too.” She seemed disappointed, and I giggled at the fallen expression on her face. It had always been a dream of [MASK]’s for us to date friends, and roommates-slash-cousins, for her, was hitting the jackpot.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Travis	[MASK] yanked his shirt off as we both shoved our legs under the covers, pulling the blanket up to our necks. He tightened his arms around me as we shivered, waiting for our body heat to warm the small space between our skin and the covers.
<name>Tyler</name>	Tyler	Travis	[MASK] appeared from the bathroom with a towel around his waist, the only evidence of his scuffle a small red mark on his cheekbone below his right eye. "One of the guys I knocked out had a fight tomorrow night.
<name>He</name>	He	Finch	"I’m sorry, I..." "I don’t want you to be sorry. I don't want you to be any-thing,” he snapped, shoving away from the table and storming out the door. [MASK] looked over at me with raised eyebrows.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Adam	My name is [MASK]. I make the rules and I call the fight. Betting ends once the opponents are on the floor. No touching the fighters, no assistance, no bet switching, and no encroachment of the ring.
<name>him</name>	him	Parker	He’s starting to piss me off." "He has quite an imagination." I glanced at [MASK], and when he met my eyes and smiled, I glared at him. “Would you get mad if I embarrassed you one more time!1''
<name>psychopath</name> (Note: The prompt is asking for the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token, which in this case is "psychopath". It is not asking for the name of the person being referred to as a psychopath.)	psychopath (Note: The prompt is asking for the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token, which in this case is "psychopath". It is not asking for the name of the person being referred to as a psychopath.)	Travis	"This is a tired, worn-out conversation. Let's just have dinner, okay?" "Okay, let's talk about your new man. What's his name? [MASK]?" I nodded. "What are you doing with that tattooed psychopath?
<name>He</name>	He	Parker	He was maddeningly confident that I was going to change my mind. "I didn’t want to go at all.” [MASK]'s patience had run out. "I just want to be clear; you don’t want to go to the date party.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Finch	“You’re going to be sorry you didn’t open the door, because I just crawled along that piss-covered floor and now I'm going to hug you." I laughed once, and then my face compressed around my smile as [MASK] pulled me into his arms.
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Travis	"If it feels this good to have this on my arm, I can’t imagine how it’s going to feel to get a ring on your finger.” "[MASK]...” "In four or maybe five years,” he added. I took a breath.
<name>Midas</name>	Midas	Travis	Open it." I touched it with one finger, feeling the lush velvet under my fingertip. I grasped the golden seal with both hands, slowly pull- ing the lid open. A glimmer caught my eye and I slammed the lid shut. “[MASK]!”
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Parker	I’m curious about your friendship, though.” "It is what it is,” I shrugged. "We hang out, eat, watch TV, study, and argue. That's about it." [MASK] laughed out loud, shaking his head at my honesty.
<name>Roman</name>	Roman	Travis	Ten minutes later, the water shut off, and the floor creaked under [MASK]’s steps. He strolled across the room with a towel wrapped around his hips. He had tattoos on opposite sides of his chest, and black tribal art covering each of his bulging shoulders.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	America	I should have minded my own business, I... please don't leave. I don't know what I’d do without you." [MASK] took his face in her hands and smiled. "You're an arrogant ass, but I still love you.”
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Adam	[MASK]’s voice came over the horn, and then a pair of warm, familiar hands were on each side of my face. "I love you,” he said. He wrapped his arms around me and lifted me off the floor, squeezing me to him as he kissed me.
<name>Bella</name>	Bella	Happy	Not a big deal.” He took my chin in his hands and wiped the remaining smeared mascara from under my eyes with his thumbs. “It was a big deal to me." “Fine, I won't do it again. [MASK]?"
<name>Bella</name>	Bella	Pidge	"I didn’t mean it, [MASK]. If he hurts you—if he even makes you feel uncomfortable—you let me know.” The anger subsided, and my shoulders fell. "I know you didn’t.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Parker	I huffed in frustration. "Thanks.” "No ... you look beautiful. I meant that. I was talking about what I said in my room. I’m not going to lie. I enjoyed pulling you from your date with [MASK]...”
<name>him</name>	him	Travis	I kept my hands on [MASK], inserting clever quips at precise moments of conversation, and joked with him about his new tattoos. “Dude, you got your girl's name on your wrist? What in the hell possessed you to do that?”
<name>him</name>	him	Ethan	“I don’t wanna let go.” I scanned the crowd for a familiar face, trying to push [MASK] away at the same time. His arms were heavy, and his grip was tight. In a panic, I couldn’t distinguish State students from Easterners.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Trent	He watched it disappear into a deep footprint in the snow and then cupped his hand around mine, pulling me toward the parking lot. “Have you talked to [MASK]?" I asked. He shook his head. “I’m waiting for him to call me back.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Travis	“He’s going to end up getting arrested or something," she said. She ran down the hall and I watched her rush across the parking lot from the window, getting in her car just as [MASK] pulled up on his bike beside her.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Shepley	I loaded the dishwasher and swept and mopped, and then wiped the counters down. When the kitchen was sparkling, I grabbed the basket of clean clothes and sat on the couch, folding until there were a dozen or more piles surrounding me. Murmuring came from [MASK]'s room.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Finch	His full lips were dry under his red nose, and I laughed when he put an imaginary cigarette to his mouth and blew out a puff of misty air. “You could save a lot of money this way, [MASK]," he smiled.
<name>Chip</name>	Chip	Finch	"He’s cute, huh?" I asked, unable to stop smiling. "Hell, yes. In that preppy, missionary-position kind of way." “[MASK]!" I cried, smacking him on the shoulder.
<name>her</name>	her	America	I breezed through the test and sat on the steps outside the building, waiting for [MASK]. When she slumped down beside me in defeat, I waited for her to speak. "That was awful!” she cried. "You should study with us.
<name>Seagull</name>	Seagull	Pigeon	I said, closing the door behind me. "Abs’? What are you, a workout video?” he sneered. '“[MASK] ?” I said with the same amount of disdain. "An annoying bird that craps all over the sidewalk?”
<name>John</name>	John	Parker	[MASK] shook his head. "This place is going to be destroyed in the morning. The cleanup crew is going to be busy." "You have a cleanup crew?” "Yeah," he smiled, "we call them freshmen.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Travis	This ain't fucking right. He shoulda never been there.” "It was an accident, [MASK]. You couldn't have known something like this was going to happen,” I said, touching his cheek. His face compressed, his eyes shutting tight.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Finch	“Well, since you were tipped off, we had to make some last minute changes to surprise you. Surprised?” “Very!” I said as [MASK] hugged me. "Happy birthday, baby!”
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Pigeon	he said, shaking his head. He turned for the door and grabbed the knob, his knuckles white. “You’re turning me into a fucking psycho. [MASK]," he growled over his shoulder. "I don’t think straight when I’m around you.”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Travis	"What’s going on?" she said, noting the seriousness of the situation by my expression. I glanced behind me to see [MASK] jogging down the stairs and across the grass to where we stood. "What are you doing?"
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Pigeon	I nestled my cheek against his chest, and he tightened his arms, sighing. “You don't need an excuse, [MASK]. All you have to do is ask." I CRINGED AT THE SUNLIGHT POURING THROUGH THE window and the alarm blaring into my ear.
<name>Abby</name>	Abby	America	"She's got this,” [MASK] assured him. I tipped my head and let the tequila flow down my throat. My teeth and lips had been numb since shot number eight, and the kick of the eighty proof had long since lost its edge.
<name>her</name>	her	Brad	he said, gesturing to [MASK]. "And to girls that break your heart,” he bowed his head to me. His eyes lost focus. "And to the absolute fucking horror of losing your best friend because you were stupid enough to fall in love with her."
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Travis	[MASK] rounded the corner in a pair of boxer shorts and yawned. He looked at his guest and then patted her backside. "My company’s here. You’d better go.” She smiled and wrapped her arms around him, kissing his neck.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Travis	[MASK] pulled me past his still-shocked cousin and kicked the door shut behind us, pulling me into his arms and kissing me without a second thought, as if we had done it a million times before. I pulled his shirt over his head, and he slipped my jacket off my shoulders.
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Travis	[MASK] begrudgingly removed his ring, slammed it into the guard's hand, and then sighed when he walked through the doorway. He didn’t set off the alarm, but he was still annoyed. I walked through without event, handing over my ring as well.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Trav	"Thanks, [MASK]. I won’t make you babysit me again.” He leaned against his pillow. "Whatever. No one can hold your hair back like I can.” I giggled and closed my eyes, letting myself sink into the darkness.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Travis	"I’ve never hit a girl in my life,” he said, surprised at my words. "And I’m not about to be the first one!” I said, tugging on the door. "Move, damn it!” [MASK] nodded, and then took a step back.
<name>the government</name>	the government	Benny	I can sock it away until it’s time for us to buy a house. I can’t make this kind of money anywhere else.” "What about your Criminal Justice degree? You’re going to be seeing your old classmates quite a bit working for [MASK], I promise you.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Shep	“Don’t tell her!” he said, trying to subdue his smile. “What the hell do you think you’re doing, [MASK]?” He shrugged, still proud of himself. "I love her. I can’t let other guys dance with her.”
<name>him</name>	him	Shepley	She cupped my hands around it and nudged me. I tipped back my head, letting the liquid flow down my throat. My face compressed as the whiskey burned its way to my stomach. "Thanks,” I said, handing the glass back to [MASK].
<name>Bella</name>	Bella	Pigeon	“What in the hell is wrong with you?" I asked, alarmed. He put one of my hands in his and kissed it, pressing his forehead against my neck. "Just go back to sleep, [MASK]. Please?” "Did something happen?
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	ABBY	We’re going the wrong way!” I cried. My feet slid across the concrete as he pulled me along, and when the smell of smoke grew stronger, I yanked away, running in the opposite direction. “[MASK]!
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Travis	"I’ve heard you’re the only person who’s allowed to put [MASK] in his place. That's an honorable title." "Whatever that means. He's not as bad as everyone makes him out to be.”
