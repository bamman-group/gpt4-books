<name>Sherry</name>	Sherry	Maggie	Although she was a small-town Jewish girl, who had once had small-town Jewish values, [MASK]’s sexual adventures with stars never seemed to her to violate anything she had learned at home. They had nothing to do with love or commitment or caring.
<name>Sally</name>	Sally	Valentine	“Listen, darling, if you won’t say yes and you won’t say no, can you give me a definite maybe?” Unwillingly, but unable to maintain her position entirely, [MASK] said, “Only an indefinite maybe, and that is absolutely all.
<name>Orson</name>	Orson	Vito	[MASK] had to find local movie houses that were empty in the afternoon, make deals with managers, borrow prints, arrange for their delivery and return, and see to rounding up projectionists. “How’s it going, darling?”
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Maggie	[MASK] always felt that professionalism was all important when engaged in white-collar crime. She opened the envelope for Best Picture last. “Oy, gevaltl” Her shout was so heartfelt, so fervent, so stunned, that her guard dog barked wildly outside the house.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Vito	If she wanted to stay married to [MASK], and she did, without too much resentment, without too much jealousy and without more than the normal strain and pain of any marriage, she had to establish an abiding interest in life that did not depend on him in any way.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alan	He knew dimly that he was going to disappoint the guy inside. He was so ready, after that tongue-lashing of [MASK]’s, that he came in less than a minute in a series of wildly relieving jerks.
<name>Lucien</name>	Lucien	Billy	The fact that no one saw the unhappy girl under [MASK]’s facade except himself made the prospect all the more tempting. He was enchanted by her big feet, her long bones. The lusciousness of her body when she took off her ridiculously beautiful clothes astounded him.
<name>Norma</name>	Norma	Melanie	All you’ll get are requests for interviews—and maybe somebody will recognize you in the street or in a store, but otherwise—-you’re just the new girl in town, [MASK]. What did you imagine actresses do be- tween pictures? The best of them?
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Melanie	Classics. The poetic, impenetrable beauty of the model lent each dress a dimension it had never had, except perhaps in the designer’s first inspiration. During the late spring and short summer that followed, [MASK]’s career was in a state of suspended animation.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Dolly	“I just hope they’re insured.” “Gee, I never thought to ask—maybe I shouldn’t wear them if it’s important.” [MASK] looked like an eleven-year-old offering to give up her favorite doll.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lilianne	There could be no question of his marrying for love alone unless he were prepared to badly disappoint his entire family—he is the only son, you know. What am I to tell [MASK]? I’m quite distraught over this matter.
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Spider	Her irises were the clear, warm color of a glass of rich, sweet sherry held up to the light, and her look seemed to be seeking some ultimate truth with a yearning yet gentle anguish. “Tell me what you’re thinking right this minute,” [MASK] implored.
<name>Stuart</name>	Stuart	Wilton	David Hicks carpet, and furniture of polished steel and glass, an office as severely masculine and strictly organized as the man himself. But when [MASK] answered her ring he led her into a duplex that combined fantasy and fine art in bewildering profusion.
<name>Trimalchio</name>	Trimalchio	Ellis	But would she have married him if he had been poor? This was basically a meaningless speculation. [MASK] was the man he was because he was immensely rich. Or perhaps he was immensely rich because he was the man he was. Without money he would have been someone else entirely.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Vito	[MASK] was, according to his calculations, within the budget. However, it would be months before the business-affairs people and their creative Accounting Department would or could prove whether he was actually over budget. And by that time, it would be too late.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Valentine	“[MASK]?” He went around the bed and bent close to listen to her breathing. He inspected her face carefully. She was not asleep, he was almost certain, but she wouldn’t or couldn’t open her eyes.
<name>she</name>	she	Pm	“Please—please, leave me alone. I swear [MASK] not sick.” “Then what are you? Come on, baby.” “I don’t know,” she muttered and then fell into a heaving contortion of tears, the first she had shed.
<name>Lucien</name>	Lucien	Josh	Her love for [MASK] was all the sweeter for being unknown, like a secret garden blooming away in the middle of a city. Their only quarrel had been over his offer, his expectation, actually, that he would pay her rent. “Ah, pa jamais!”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Spider	He was as unprepared for passion as a schoolboy. They ate without banter. Everything [MASK] wanted to say seemed, even before he said it, to go against her rules. She was not at all bothered by the silence between them.
<name>Rockefeller</name>	Rockefeller	Prince	After the business day, [MASK] held court in his town house in the East Seventies. It had originally been two large town houses built side by side. When he bought them, he had the wall separating them tom down.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Alan	She met [MASK] at his home for a drink, they went out to eat, they had a brandy or two in a bar after strolling a while, and then he took her home in a taxi, insisting on seeing her all the way up to her door.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Sergio	[MASK] recognized an important menswear buyer, a Puerto Rican stock boy, the vice-president of a major department store, a blond male model, and a young wrapper for a dress manufacturer. He didn’t greet any of them nor did they greet him.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Vito	She tried to hold them back, but it was impossible. A convulsion of loss was contracting her chest. It was several seconds before [MASK] noticed, and then he was holding her tightly, kissing her dark hair, rocking her in his arms until she was able to speak.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Dolly	He was a monster of depravity, no doubt about that, but he felt like a member of the Now Generation at last Why had he been so nervous about everything, he wondered? [MASK] stirred in her deep. He jiggled her a little.
<name>Helene</name>	Helene	Valentine	Why did men fitters always work on anything that was tailored, and women fitters work the softer designs? Most of her questions H61£ne found easy to resolve, but the one question that interested [MASK] the most was one she could not answer.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Valentine	He looked at his watch. ‘Tm late, see you tomorrow.” As he retreated hastily, closing the door behind him, [MASK] sat motionless in her chair, stunned, puzzled, shaken by the intensity of the gust of emotion that had been released into the air.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Spider	It was his form of love, but their sex life, as elegant as a saraband, which had first been so soothing, and his lack of curiosity about her began to make her feel that she existed less and less. It was then that she started to make tentative phone calls to [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Susan	But I won’t come here. [MASK] might join us. She reminds me of the headwaiter at the Moulin de Mougins. I’ll take you to the Colombe d’Or. I’ll call tomorrow night to let you know if it’s on or off.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Spider	“Hey, hold on!” said [MASK], his suspicions newly aroused. “Who have you told?” “How could I tell what I didn’t know? I’m talking about your mother and your sue sisters—they knew— everything, I think, the day they met me.”
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Valentine	[MASK] stared at him incredulously. “You’re wondering how much to tip the man from the Savoy and how much to tip the porter. Don’t bother, I’ve taken care of them.” “What are you doing here?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Vito	The only time I think [MASK] knew I was really there was when we were making love. I wonder if he’d even recognize me if he couldn’t see my pussy—the rotten son of a bitch.” “Well then, get a divorce if it’s that bad.”
<name>Marilyn</name>	Marilyn	Valentine	He worried furiously that she might resent the fact that he couldn’t dare take her to a really good restaurant because of the risk of being seen together. If they didn’t eat at the 94th Aero Squadron or some obscure place in the Valley, [MASK] cooked for him in her kitchen.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Billy	Being “Gibbs Material” meant that you were expected to reach certain degrees of proficiency that struck [MASK] as outrageous. Were they seriously expecting her to be able to take one hundred words a minute in shorthand and type faultlessly at a minimum of sixty words a minute by the time she had completed her course?
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Billy	It would be the height of cruelty, and he wouldn’t be able to tell you how he felt.” [MASK] nodded. She had heard what he said and she knew he was right, but it didn’t seem important.
<name>Luc</name>	Luc	Elliott	Thank God she was French and knew how to protect herself from this kind erf man. “You look hungry, [MASK]. It so happens that I made a blanquette de veau, which is too much for one person. And it goes with champagne.”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Spider	But [MASK] knew he had never been in love. His bittersweet sensitive heart was stubbornly his own. He had turned into an intelligent feeling man and he understood perfectly that he loved women genericaUy, as a group, a species.
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	Lester	“Fuck—Best Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium—cock-suckers, Best Foreign-Language Film—damn it to hell, Best Original Song Score and Its Adaptation—who the hell gives a flying shit—” “[MASK], I think I hear somebody coming.”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Spider	She wouldn’t do a thing, she thought, not a single thing, just lie there and let him have his fun. [MASK] bent tenderly over her, all his weight bn his knees and his elbows, staring at her composed wide-eyed face.
<name>Yves</name>	Yves	Valentine	For five years, from 1967 to 1972, [MASK] progressed steadily, from midinette to second hand to first hand, making, in only a few years, a leap that usually takes twenty years if it is ever made at all.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Billy	Then her wild Irish spirit took over. “A hundred thousand. Who knows if there will be any profits?” “Well, in that case it would be straight salary, no profit participation,” [MASK] answered.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Melanie	“I’ll be here for the next hour, [MASK]. If you want to come over for a few minutes, OK, but that’s it. I have to be out at the beach by dinnertime.” “Just tell me how to get there.
<name>Valentin</name>	Valentin	Elliott	She’s beautiful enough—” “Enough!” he said savagely. “More, far more than enough. It is strange, is it not, how an accident of a millimeter here, a millimeter there, makes one face so important. Think about it, [MASK].
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Spider	She had been so engrossed in the conversation that she hadn’t paid any attention to [MASK]. Now she was afraid to face him. His silence was accusing. How had she dared to make such decisions for him? Why didn’t he say anything?
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Billy	None of this being crept up on and shaken by the scruff of the neck by nature. [MASK] did not accept being bossed around by life. But, in that case, why hadn’t she married one of the tame, decorative, amusing, caponish men available to women with money?
<name>John</name>	John	Sergio	The stranger in the cubicle had barely started to really work on [MASK]’s prick when his mouth was filled with sperm. He gulped it frantically, trying to hold the pumping cock in his mouth as long as possible.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Billy	[MASK] accepted only a few of the invitations that came to her, going only to the homes of women who were not, she felt, using her as an attraction, almost as a sideshow, to satisfy the curiosity of the other guests.
<name>Tracy</name>	Tracy	Elliott	No one really knew what direction to go in, but anything that looked new and fresh had to be wrong. “[MASK], I’ve been turned down cold by twenty-nine designers in three weeks. If you tell me not to get discouraged I’ll throw this dead chicken at you.”
<name>Jeremy</name>	Jeremy	Spider	/n the two weeks that followed his call home, [MASK] needed all his resilience, all his trained eye for detail, all his leaping sense of taste, all his imagination and sense of what works visually and what doesn’t quite make it.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Melanie	He had loved [MASK] too much once to turn away from her now when she was in some sort of trouble, he told himself, knowing perfectly well that the real reason was not humanitarian but simply that he couldn’t resist her.
<name>Archer</name>	Archer	Vito	How would that be possible? Even if we signed twenty prenuptial agreements that I would never touch your money, we’d still be living in the style to which you’re accustomed, on your money.” “[MASK]—I can’t stand not having you!”
<name>Shakespeare</name>	Shakespeare	Fellini	She was a woman of such hard, sharp style that she seemed to have a cutting edge. Her feeling of authority was so genuine that it inspired equally genuine fear in her entire staff, and her creative imagination had as few limits as [MASK]’s.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Billy	So we’re both going to lose, aren’t we, for the rest of our lives?” “[MASK]—” “But I told you I didn’t have the essential argument, didn’t I? It’s just such a waste—I hate waste.”
<name>Griffin</name>	Griffin	Vito	“Maybe I’ll get die anti-blockbuster vote,” [MASK] answered dreamily. “People in the industry know that every blockbuster that fails means six or eight or even ten other pictures that don’t get a chance to get made—thousands of jobs lost.
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Spider	I don’t believe it.” “Fm a designer. It doesn’t hurt to know how to sew— or did you not know that?” “I never thought about it,” [MASK] answered. “Did you design what you’re wearing?”
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Dolly	“Oh no,” said [MASK], looking stricken. “I bet it was in an orphan asylum or a maternity hospital.” “Aw, hell,” the Chief grinned, “I shouldn’t have brought it up at all, but there’s no harm—just between us.
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	Dolly	This could ruin the whole big Oscar night—don’t you see, it’s got to be a surprise. Oh, shit on a stick, why did I take those envelopes? I must have been temporarily insane.” “We could bum them,” [MASK] said helpfully.
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Vito	“Since I was eleven—hasn’t everybody?” she said, giggling, in a sudden change of mood. “No,” [MASK] said patiently, “I mean today.” “What day is today? Wait—no—don’t tell me—it’s Friday.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Spider	Her shrewd, measuring eyes were trained to miss nothing of the workings of seduction; if a performer is not also a seducer of some sort or another, he or she will never become a star. Certain obvious things were in [MASK]’s favor, she thought.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Spider	The building in which [MASK]’s loft was located was a musty, old business structure, not legally meant for people to live in. It had an ancient elevator with doors like folding iron gates, and the lower floors were occupied by a jumble of dusty mail-order
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Spider	She watched the relationship between [MASK] and the girl and observed, almost as soon as it happened, the moment when he became her lover. She was used to being a spectator of heterosexual romance; she had cultivated a leaden indifference toward it, but this time she felt pain.
<name>Eileen</name>	Eileen	Harriet	Until the September issue of the magazine appeared, in late August, [MASK] had advised her not to do any commercial work, so that when she burst upon the fashion scene, she would be a completely new face.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Spider	“I had to see you. [MASK]—maybe you can explain things to me.” “Explain!” “I’m so confused about things—and you used to ask me all kinds of questions about myself—maybe you could figure out what’s going on.”
<name>Sammy</name>	Sammy	Cope	[MASK] decided that if he was ever going to make any money for himself, this was the time to leave, since the history of the survival of a studio production head is somewhat less reassuring than that of a Mafia hit man.
<name>John</name>	John	Spider	I’ve never told a woman I loved her before, not until you walked in here. Please! I don’t blame you for looking that way but try to believe me.” [MASK] took her hand and placed it on his chest.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Spider	“Do you have any idea how much I resent finding out that I’m wrong?” she asked [MASK], in tacit surrender. He didn’t let his exultance show. This was the first time he had ever verbalized his hazy ideas about fashion.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Dolly	[MASK] maneuvered herself down to sit beside him. He definitely needed a haircut Why was he counting on his fingers? He looked smarter than that. He looked very sweet, steady, reliable but fun. Just as she had known he would.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Josh	Please, [MASK], I warn you, don’t think it’s more because it isn’t And don’t make any plans that involve me and don’t speak to anyone, anyone—or I will say no, I promise you.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Billy	Her Pygmalion impulses, disappointed by self-assured paying guests who had rejected her hints or advice, had never entirely withered. She felt an impulse of her old kindness. “Just look, [MASK], how well this gray-flannel skirt hangs.
<name>John</name>	John	Spider	Suddenly she went very still, all her muscles rigid. Finally she was shaken by contractions and she shouted. As he felt tMs climax, [MASK]’s cock had been excited beyond endurance from the friction of the sheets as he worked on her.
<name>John</name>	John	Vito	First of all, she just didn’t feel ready to be a mother. Once she was a mother she would never again be a carefree woman without any absolutely irrevocable responsibility. Second, she wanted to be [MASK]’s honeymoon bride for a long, lovely while.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Vito	She had to risk another rejection, no matter what humiliations it would cost her in the middle of the night for as many years as it took for it to become a memory. She felt obstinate, urgent, awkward —even brutal—and she didn’t care. “[MASK].”
<name>Lucia</name>	Lucia	Valentine	But look, [MASK], they grew up in a very secure home, they’re good kids, they’re formed already, they’ve passed the most vulnerable stages of their lives; I can’t live the rest of my life without you just because of teenagers.
<name>pathetic</name>	pathetic	OK	Then she looked at herself from one side, turned awkwardly and looked at the other side. Finally she arranged the panels of the mirror so that she could see herself in a back view. Tears flooded her eyes, blurring the miraculous vision. She looked [MASK].
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Melanie	If they’re married they can fix up the house or be with the kids, and wait. If they’re on television they can do game shows and wait.” “I can always take up needlepoint,” [MASK] muttered, tears of chagrin and deception in her eyes.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Joe	He was making great progress down in his little lab, but he needed all of his time, every minute. “Merely that you let me take over in certain areas, [MASK]. I have tried before, as you may remember, but you always rebuffed me.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Vito	The biggest part of her rage came from another source. She was angry at [MASK] who was neglecting her, as he had to in order to do his work. She was angry at his work, which, necessarily, made her an outsider.
<name>Annabel</name>	Annabel	Melanie	She couldn’t merge again into that figure on the screen. She found herself still sitting in the projection room, just [MASK] being—what? She began searching her eyes in the mirror again. More and more often she fell into daydreams of being another.
<name>Daphne</name>	Daphne	Billy	” Neither of them showed the faintest surprise. They had lived with a parade of voiceless, speechless strangers all their lives and they only bothered to speak to them to show a polite interest. If [MASK] had answered them they would have been amazed.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Lilianne	She would do anything short of murder to own either number five, fifteen, or twenty-five. But all three! “Look at it this way, [MASK], either you do it my way or you’re in big trouble with me.
<name>Lucia</name>	Lucia	Billy	True, he’d warned her that their house, one of the few available at the height of the tourist season, was simple, on the verge of falling apart. But [MASK] was sure that it couldn’t be all that bad, and anyway, what did it matter?
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Joanne	In six years they’ll all be finished with college and going their own ways— why, in only two years they’ll all be in college and only home for vacations anyway. And [MASK] is still young enough and attractive enough to remarry.”
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Harriet	She had pushed herself away from the cushions as she spoke and now she was bending emphatically toward the older woman. [MASK] was dimly aware of danger, great danger, but she didn’t hold herself back. She put her arms around the girl, pulled her forward, and held her close.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Jake	Now she was tasting the thrill of a fresh and almost excruciating pleasure in becoming the one who sought, who demanded, who explored, who drained. When [MASK] arrived at the pool house she was always there, hungry for him.
<name>Jeff</name>	Jeff	Spider	Almost no makeup, bare brown legs and feet in thin, low-heeled sandals and she had completed the effect she had set out to project: unspoiled, childish, almost countrified, and, above all, vulnerable. As she drove to [MASK]’s house her hands shook on the wheel.
<name>Lucasta</name>	Lucasta	Dolly	and then the moving man said that with knockers like mine I didn’t need to see where I was going, so why did I bother with the glasses?—it’s sort of hopeless,” [MASK] sighed, like a mournful Druid.
<name>Alvy</name>	Alvy	Billy	I never understand what the hell they’re all about. I’ve only made one other movie and I get kind of totally confused. Hey, what’s so funny about that? After all, you’re the produc—[MASK], you’re getting hysterical—hey, come onl
<name>Jonas</name>	Jonas	Billy	“But what can they do to it?” [MASK] asked in baffled, innocent anguish and ignorance. “It’s all on film, the work print’s finished, the whole movie is made—why do they want it now?”
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Vito	She heard the shrill, complaining echo of her own words and realized that she’d gone too far. She had forgotten how entirely his own man [MASK] was. She walked over to him and took his hand, magically reassuming her familiar huntress quality.
<name>Griffith</name>	Griffith	Vito	No matter how thin [MASK] spread himself all day long, busy with other people, she could hardly fault him at night. He kept her so blaz-ingly and so thoroughly fucked that she generally made her observations of the tiresomeness of movie making through a haze of sensual anticipation.
<name>Artemis</name>	Artemis	Spider	His confidence infuriated her, particularly since she knew he was right and she had been unforgivably blind not to figure it out all by herself. “Modesty forbids—” [MASK] started to answer. She picked up a large bunch of grapes and advanced on him menacingly.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Billy	He looked at her helplessly. He had no answer. It was not a question to which any man has an answer if he loves his work and puts his best energies into it “[MASK], darling, you knew I was a producer when we got married.”
<name>Rebus</name>	Rebus	Ikehom	[MASK] had never been interested in birthdays, but, at almost sixty, he reflected, they seem to start to mount up, whether they interest you or not. In principle he had nothing against the idea of indulging himself. He just didn’t know where to start.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Valentine	“Just think,” he said, pulling back her curls so that he could see all of her small, splendid face, “how surprised everybody is going to be.” “All but seven women,” said [MASK] with pure mischief now spilling out of her great, green eyes.
<name>Spots</name>	Spots	Elliott	“I am allergic to them—I break out in spots just at the thought. Such a name. Truly it is too much! I shall call you “[MASK].’ ” “Swell. Whatever,” he grinned. What was with this cute nut?
<name>Steve</name>	Steve	Elliott	What a typical American he was. No gastronomic imagination, taste buds half alive. Still—she felt a curiously warm swell of gratitude toward the big barbarian. “I’m sorry if I have offended you, [MASK]. I didn’t realize you were so hungry.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Billy	There was even something gratifying, no matter how painful, in finding out that she was right about life. She was thin and she was beautiful, [MASK] told herself fiercely. Those were the important things. The necessary things. The rest she would have to get for herself.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Melanie	what’s the difference? You make it sound as if I’m hiding something. Would a blow-by-blow description of my first high-school dance make you happy? It was a genuine Gothic horror story.” [MASK] wasn’t impatient.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Elliott	“I still don’t know what happened—when I get mad I don’t think. But, [MASK], I’ve been lying in bed thinking now, and I just realized that we’re a couple of complete fakers, both of us.
<name>John</name>	John	Melanie	She was simple, sad, wondering, denuded of her mystery, a state that she conveyed as if it were a last surrender. “I know why I was happy then, [MASK], but I was never sure about you.”
<name>Mrs. Ramsay</name>	Mrs. Ramsay	Lilianne	It was a shame she did not profit by the occasion. However, the expenditure of money was not a subject that [MASK] felt she had the right to discuss with her paying guests, even so dear a one as this.
