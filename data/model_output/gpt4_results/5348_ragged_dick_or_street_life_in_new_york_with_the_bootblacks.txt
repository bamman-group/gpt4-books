<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Dick	[MASK] always had an eye to business, and this remark was addressed to a young man, dressed in a stylish manner, who was swinging a jaunty cane. "I've had my boots blacked once already this morning, but this confounded mud has spoiled the shine."
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Dick	but I will," said [MASK], after some irresolution. "I guess I won't lose much." "You can't lose anything," said the stranger briskly. "Only be quick, for I must be on my way to the cars.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Fosdick	he asked, complacently. The time was when [MASK] would have thought it untidy and not particularly attractive. But he had served a severe apprenticeship in the streets, and it was pleasant to feel himself under shelter, and he was not disposed to be critical.
<name>Arnold</name>	Arnold	Dick	Perhaps he had devoted too much time to study, for he was not naturally robust. All this, however, fitted him admirably for the office to which [MASK] had appointed him,--that of his private instructor. The two boys drew up their chairs to the rickety table, and spread out the paper before them.
<name>Rudolph</name>	Rudolph	Fosdick	He could not help thinking his chances the best. "The man can see I'm a gentleman, and will do credit to his store," he thought. At length it came to [MASK]'s turn. He entered with no very sanguine anticipations of success.
<name>Ragged</name>	Ragged	Dick	"Such as what?" "Well, there's a silver pitcher worth twenty dollars." "And you sell it for a dollar. That's very kind of you," said [MASK], innocently. "Walk in, and you'll understand it."
<name>Dorothy</name>	Dorothy	Frank	I'll make 'em shine so you can see your face in 'em." And he was as good as his word. "Thank you," said [MASK]; "now you had better brush your own shoes."
<name>Snorkey</name>	Snorkey	Dick	but my money's in it," said the lady, sharply. "Conductor, will you open that wallet, and see what there is in it?" "Don't disturb the valooable papers," said [MASK], in a tone of pretended anxiety.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Dick	"If I lived in the city, you might come every evening to me, and I would teach you." "Would you take so much trouble about me?" asked [MASK], earnestly. "Certainly; I should like to see you getting on.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Dick	said [MASK]. "You'd ought to see me with my Washington coat on. You'd think I was the biggest villain ever you saw." "I've no doubt you are," said the lady, scowling in the direction of our hero.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Dick	He seized [MASK]'s hand, and shook it with so much energy that our hero began to feel rather alarmed for its safety. "'Pears to me you take my arm for a pump-handle," said he. "Couldn't you show your gratitood some other way?
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Frank	His fancy was tickled by the anticipation of his friend's surprise. Then the thought of the valuable gifts he had received occurred to him, and he looked gratefully at [MASK]. "You're a brick," he said. "A what?" "A brick!
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Fosdick	"I'll keep mum unless I lose something more, and then I'll kick up a row, and haul her over the coals. Have you missed anything?" "No," said [MASK], answering for himself, as he could do without violating the truth.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dick	asked [MASK], looking interested. "How did he do it?" "Why, you see, a rich merchant took pity on him, and gave him a home in his own house, where he used to stay with the servants, being employed in little errands.
<name>Lenina</name>	Lenina	Frank	"There aint much to see now but rocks. We will take a walk over it if you want to." "No," said [MASK], "I've seen as much of it as I want to. Besides, I feel tired."
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Dick	Here's fifty cents." "Thank you, sir," said [MASK]. "You're very kind. Don't you want some more bills changed?" "Not to-day," said he with a smile. "It's too expensive."
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	"Wouldn't [MASK] let you have any of the money he had won to pay for a lodging?" "No; I axed him for five cents, but he wouldn't let me have it." "Can you get lodging for five cents?"
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Dick	But he had served a severe apprenticeship in the streets, and it was pleasant to feel himself under shelter, and he was not disposed to be critical. "It looks very comfortable, [MASK]," he said.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dick	[MASK], on the contrary, thought it a capital joke that such a charge should have been made against his companion. Though he had brought himself up, and known plenty of boys and men, too, who would steal, he had never done so himself.
<name>Titus</name>	Titus	Dick	To tell the truth, [MASK] was quite ashamed of his appearance, and, on opening the chamber-door, looked around to see that the coast was clear, not being willing to have any of his fellow-boarders see him in his present attire.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Fosdick	It was generally desired that the boy wanted should reside with his parents. When [MASK], on being questioned, revealed the fact of his having no parents, and being a boy of the street, this was generally sufficient of itself to insure a refusal.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dick	asked the clerk, who had by this time found the letter. "Yes," said [MASK]. "I know a chap that's at boardin'-school there." "It appears to be in a boy's hand. I think it must be yours."
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Dick	[MASK] was so elated that he hardly restrained himself from some demonstration which would have astonished the merchant; but he exercised self-control, and only said, "I'll try to serve you so faithfully, sir, that you won't repent having taken me into your service."
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Fosdick	"Where did you learn them? Did you ever go to school?" "Yes; I went two days." "Why did you stop?" "It didn't agree with my constitution." "You don't look very delicate," said [MASK].
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Frank	[MASK], who had always possessed a good home of his own, found it hard to realize that the boy who was walking at his side had actually walked the streets in the cold without a home, or money to procure the common comfort of a bed.
<name>He</name>	He	Dick	He took his station on the sidewalk, and began to look about him. Just behind him were two persons,--one, a gentleman of fifty; the other, a boy of thirteen or fourteen. They were speaking together, and [MASK] had no difficulty in hearing what was said.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Dick	"When are you going to answer it?" "I don't know," said [MASK], dubiously. "I never writ a letter." "That's no reason why you shouldn't. There's always a first time, you know."
<name>Jorrocks</name>	Jorrocks	Dick	"A bad character!" muttered the lady. But it was quite evident that the sympathies of those present were against the lady, and on the side of the boys who had been falsely accused, while [MASK]'s drollery had created considerable amusement.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dick	He crowded in here on purpose to rob me, and I want you to search him right off." "That's a lie!" exclaimed [MASK], indignantly. "Oh, you're in league with him, I dare say," said the woman spitefully.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Dick	[MASK] tried them on, and surveyed himself in the cracked glass; but the reflection did not please him. "They don't look 'spectable," he decided; and, forthwith taking them off again, he put on the new suit of the day before.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Dick	There seemed to be no way out of his present business, for which he felt unfitted. "I don't know but I shall have to black boots all my life," he said, one day, despondently, to [MASK].
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Fosdick	[MASK] took the letter, and read it over carefully. "Yes, there are some mistakes," he said; "but it sounds so much like you that I think it would be better to let it go just as it is.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dick	He threw himself upon him, and strove to bear him to the ground; but [MASK], avoiding a close hug, in which he might possibly have got the worst of it, by an adroit movement, tripped up his antagonist, and stretched him on the side walk.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dick	"Say seventy-five cents, and I'll take it," said [MASK]. "Every week in advance?" "Yes." "Well, as times is hard, and I can't afford to keep it empty, you may have it.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dick	You know I've got more money than you. No, I haven't, either," said [MASK], the memory of his loss flashing upon him. "I thought I was rich this morning, but now I'm in destitoot circumstances."
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dick	"It's a bully name." [MASK] turned red as soon as he had said it, for he felt that he had not used the right expression. The little girl broke into a silvery laugh. "What a funny boy you are!" she said.
<name>Jorrocks</name>	Jorrocks	Frank	"Oh, I understand," he said. "He means 'glass put in.'" [MASK]'s mistake was not a singular one. The monotonous cry of these men certainly sounds more like "glass puddin'," than the words they intend to utter.
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Frank	"It isn't so new as it might be," said [MASK], surveying an old felt hat, which had once been black, but was now dingy, with a large hole in the top and a portion of the rim torn off. "
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dick	I've had pretty hard work to do that. I don't know what we'll do. I haven't any place to go to, and I'm afraid mother'll get cold in her arm." "Can't you borrow the money somewhere?" asked [MASK].
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dick	He waited, therefore, until he heard the boys come out, and then opened his own door. "Morning, gents," said he, sociably. "Going to business?" "Yes," said [MASK].
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Dick	This view seemed reasonable, and [MASK] resolved to adopt it. On the whole, he began to think prospects were brighter than he had at first supposed, and his spirits rose a little. "How'd he know I had any bank-book?
<name>Si</name>	Si	Dick	He discovered on trial that [MASK] had not exaggerated his deficiencies. Words of two syllables he seldom pronounced right, and was much surprised when he was told how "through" was sounded. "Seems to me it's throwin' away letters to use all them," he said.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Frank	"I have heard of it very often," said [MASK]. "It is said to be very elegant. Suppose we go in and take an ice-cream. It will give us a chance to see it to better advantage."
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dick	"Stop a minute," said [MASK]. "Don't you keep your money in the Washington Bank?" "I don't know any such bank. I'm in a hurry, young man, and I can't stop to answer any foolish questions."
<name>Wiggins</name>	Wiggins	Dick	"What did you do next?" "I went into the match business," said [MASK]; "but it was small sales and small profits. Most of the people I called on had just laid in a stock, and didn't want to buy.
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Dick	Somebody opened it with a key that fitted the lock, and then locked it ag'in." "That must have been the way." "It's rather hard on a feller," said [MASK], who, for the first time since we became acquainted with him, began to feel down-hearted.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Frank	"Wait a minute. There must be a large sum inside. I shouldn't wonder if there might be a thousand dollars. The owner will probably give you a hundred dollars reward." "Why don't you stay and get it?" asked [MASK].
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dick	This cost him considerable, for [MASK] was rather fastidious about his cigars, and wouldn't smoke the cheapest. Besides, having a liberal nature, he was generally ready to treat his companions. But of course the expense was the smallest objection.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Frank	asked [MASK], as they went on. "All his articles are numbered, and he makes you pay a dollar, and then shakes some dice, and whatever the figgers come to, is the number of the article you draw. Most of 'em aint worth sixpence."
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Dick	"I'll bag the money to-day, and then they may whistle for it." Having no further object to serve in accompanying the boys, he bade them good-morning, and turned down another street. "He's mighty friendly all of a sudden," said [MASK].
<name>Barnum</name>	Barnum	Barnum	"I'm in luck," thought our hero complacently. "I guess I'll go to [MASK]'s to-night, and see the bearded lady, the eight-foot giant, the two-foot dwarf, and the other curiosities, too numerous to mention."
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Dick	"Yes," said [MASK]; "but I give it up after a while." "What for?" "Well, they didn't always put news enough in their papers, and people wouldn't buy 'em as fast as I wanted 'em to.
<name>Ragged</name>	Ragged	Dick	"I don't know as it would be good enough for you," said the woman, with a glance at [MASK]'s clothes. "I aint very partic'lar about accommodations," said our hero. "I guess I'll look at it."
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Dick	The last, not being considered worth keeping, [MASK] dropped on the sidewalk, from which, on looking back, he saw it picked up by a brother boot-black who appeared to consider it better than his own.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Frank	"I shall know where to come for clothes next time," said [MASK], laughing. "I had no idea the city was so much cheaper than the country. I suppose the Baxter Street tailors are fashionable?" "In course they are.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dick	When fairly equipped, [MASK] surveyed himself in the mirror,--if the little seven-by-nine-inch looking-glass, with which the room was furnished, deserved the name. The result of the survey was not on the whole a pleasing one.
<name>Merlin</name>	Merlin	Fosdick	If it had been sent to him a year before, he would not have been able to read it. But now, thanks to [MASK]'s instructions, he could not only read writing, but he could write a very good hand himself.
<name>Jerry</name>	Jerry	Dick	"Wait a minute till I get my handkercher," and [MASK] pulled from the pocket of the pants a dirty rag, which might have been white once, though it did not look like it, and had apparently once formed a part of a sheet or shirt.
<name>Alcott</name>	Alcott	Fosdick	You shall be my perfessor; only you must promise not to be very hard if my writin' looks like a rail-fence on a bender." "I'll try not to be too severe," said [MASK], laughing.
<name>Dick</name>	Dick	Dick	"I don't succeed very well at blacking boots. You make a great deal more than I do." "That's cause I aint troubled with bashfulness," said [MASK]. "Bashfulness aint as natural to me as it is to you.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Frank	Accordingly he stepped up to the two just as [MASK]'s uncle was about leaving, and said, "I know all about the city, sir; I'll show him around, if you want me to." The gentleman looked a little curiously at the ragged figure before him.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dick	"Couldn't do it," said [MASK], coolly. "I'm go'n' to restore it to the owner. The contents is so valooable that most likely the loss has made him sick, and he'll be likely to come down liberal to the honest finder."
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Frank	Do you think I can get the money now?" "Will you show me the check?" asked [MASK], who had listened attentively to the countryman's story, and suspected that he had been made the victim of a swindler.
<name>Jabez</name>	Jabez	Dick	"Be they a-payin' out money inside there?" he asked, indicating the interior by a motion of his hand. "I guess so," said [MASK]. "Are you a-goin' in for some?" "Wal, yes.
<name>Snipes</name>	Snipes	Dick	I knowed one of the pressmen, and he let me set down in a corner, where I was warm, and I soon got fast asleep." "Why don't you get a room somewhere, and so always have a home to go to?" "I dunno," said [MASK].
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Fosdick	He determined to be as economical as possible, and moreover to study as hard as he could, that he might be able to follow [MASK]'s example, and obtain a place in a store or counting-room.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Johnny	These were promptly brought, and [MASK] attacked them vigorously. Now, in the boot-blacking business, as well as in higher avocations, the same rule prevails, that energy and industry are rewarded, and indolence suffers.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Dick	Here he is," he exclaimed, hurrying back. "Can't you hide me somewhere? I don't want to be seen." The cashier understood at once how the land lay. He quickly opened a little door, and admitted [MASK] behind the counter.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Frank	asked [MASK], after a pause. "Ever since I can remember." "I wish you'd tell me a little about yourself. Have you got any father or mother?" "I aint got no mother. She died when I wasn't but three years old.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dick	"You don't catch me stealin', if that's what you mean," said [MASK]. "Don't you ever steal, then?" "No, and I wouldn't. Lots of boys does it, but I wouldn't." "
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dick	You've more than paid me. Who was it took my part when all the other boys imposed upon me? And who gave me money to buy clothes, and so got me my situation?" "Oh, that's nothing!" said [MASK].
<name>Jerry</name>	Jerry	Dick	I hope I'll be able to do somethin' for you sometime." "All right," said [MASK]. "I'd ought to help you. I haven't got no mother to look out for. I wish I had."
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Dick	The thought was a pleasant one to our young vagrant, who hitherto had seldom known when he rose in the morning where he should find a resting-place at night. "I must bring my traps round," said [MASK] to himself.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Dick	"By the time you get to be a gray-headed veteran, you may get a chance to run errands for some big firm on the Bowery, which is a very cheerin' reflection." So [MASK] by his drollery and perpetual good spirits kept up
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Dick	"How are ye, to-night?" he said, sinking into one of the two chairs with which the room was scantily furnished. "Jolly," said [MASK]. "How are you?" "Tired as a dog," was the reply.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Dick	he said. "How's your mother?" "She's better, [MASK], thank you. She felt worried about bein' turned out into the street; but I gave her that money from you, and now she feels a good deal easier."
<name>He</name>	He	Dick	This is an enclosure of about ten acres, which years ago was covered with a green sward, but is now a great thoroughfare for pedestrians and contains several important public buildings. [MASK] pointed out the City Hall, the Hall of Records, and the Rotunda.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Dick	I haven't risen very high myself," he added, with a smile, "but have met with moderate success in life; yet there was a time when I was as poor as you." "Were you, sir," asked [MASK], eagerly.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Frank	Now, for the first time, he began to reflect that he could not black boots all his life. In seven years he would be a man, and, since his meeting with [MASK], he felt that he would like to be a respectable man.
<name>Jerry</name>	Jerry	Dick	* That man in the brown coat was the man that got me the place, and I'm afraid he'd want to send me back." * A fact. "Well," said [MASK], reflectively, "I dunno as I'd like to live in the country.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Dick	[MASK] heard the shout, and it put fresh strength into him. He battled manfully with the treacherous sea, his eyes fixed longingly upon the approaching boat. "Hold on tight, little boy," he said. "There's a boat coming."
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Dick	Like most active boys [MASK] did not enjoy the prospect of spending half a day in bed; but his confinement did not last as long as he anticipated. In about an hour the door of his chamber was opened, and a servant appeared, bringing a new and handsome suit of clothes throughout.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dick	In [MASK]'s profession as in others there are lucky days, when everything seems to flow prosperously. As if to encourage him in his new-born resolution, our hero obtained no less than six jobs in the course of an hour and a half.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Tom	"Oh, it's all right, [MASK]. Don't be afraid." "But you may need it yourself." "There's plenty more where that came from." "Any way, one dollar will be enough. With that we can pay the rent."
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dick	After various preparations, he at last got settled down to his task, and, before the evening was over, a letter was written. As the first letter which [MASK] had ever produced, and because it was characteristic of him, my readers may like to read it.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Dick	Though [MASK] was somewhat startled at discovering that the bill he had offered was counterfeit, he stood his ground bravely. "Clear out of this shop, you young vagabond," repeated the clerk. "Then give me back my bill."
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dick	so I let her have them. I don't see why rich folks should be so hard upon a poor boy that wants to make a livin'." "There's a good deal of meanness in the world, I'm afraid, [MASK]."
<name>Dick</name>	Dick	Dick	To make a long story short, the captain, seeing how matters stood, brought [MASK]'s cat ashore, and she soon made the rats and mice scatter. The king was highly delighted when he saw what havoc she made among the rats and mice, and resolved to have her at any price.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Dick	"That wouldn't be very convenient," said [MASK]. "I aint fond of lacin' to show my elegant figger. But I say," he added with a sudden thought, "how much money have we got in the savings' bank?"
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Frank	[MASK] sat down beside a middle-aged woman, or lady, as she probably called herself, whose sharp visage and thin lips did not seem to promise a very pleasant disposition. When the two gentlemen who sat beside her arose, she spread her skirts in the endeavor to fill two seats.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Dick	he asked. "A good deal worse sometimes," said [MASK]. "I knowed a young man once who waited six hours for a chance to cross, and at last got run over by an omnibus, leaving a widder and a large family of orphan children.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Dick	"That brave boy shall be rewarded, if I sacrifice my whole fortune to compass it." "You've had a pretty narrow escape, young chap," said one of the boatmen to [MASK]. "It was a pretty tough job you undertook."
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Fosdick	That'll be better than sleepin' in a door-way,--won't it?" "Yes, indeed it will," said [MASK]. "How lucky I was to come across you! It comes hard to me living as I do.
<name>Edmond</name>	Edmond	Dick	The merchant listened attentively to [MASK]'s statement, and, when he had finished, placed a sheet of paper before him, and, handing him a pen, said, "Will you write your name on this piece of paper?"
<name>She</name>	She	Bridget	"I left it on my bureau a day or two since. I've missed one or two other little matters. [MASK] don't look to me any too honest. Likely she's got 'em." "What are you goin' to do about it?"
<name>Aladdin</name>	Aladdin	Dick	"Does it?" said [MASK]; "he must have had plenty of money." "He had an old lamp, which he had only to rub, when the Slave of the Lamp would appear, and do whatever he wanted." "
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dick	"Are you? So is my cousin [MASK]. He's going to college this year. Are you going to college?" "Not this year." "Because, if you did, you know you'd be in the same class with my cousin.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dick	but I forgot all about it till this mornin'." "It had quite slipped my mind also. But you don't look like the boy I employed. If I remember rightly he wasn't as well dressed as you." "No," said [MASK].
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Dick	"No, sir, I want to leave some here." "Then go to the next desk." [MASK] followed directions, and presented himself before an elderly man with gray hair, who looked at him over the rims of his spectacles.
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Dick	"Your blacking-box and old clothes are upstairs. You may want them." "In course," said [MASK]. "I couldn't get along without my best clothes, and my stock in trade."
