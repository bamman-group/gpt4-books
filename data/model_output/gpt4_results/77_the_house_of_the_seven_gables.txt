<name>Tabitha</name>	Tabitha	Phoebe	After partly closing the door, the child turned back, and mumbled something to [MASK], which, as the whale was but half disposed of, she could not perfectly understand. "What did you say, my little fellow?" asked she.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Hepzibah	She then muffled the bell in an unfinished stocking, and put up the oaken bar across the door. During the latter process, an omnibus came to a stand-still under the branches of the elm-tree. [MASK]'s heart was in her mouth.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Phoebe	It is my idea that the dust and continual decay of these old houses are unwholesome for the lungs." "There is the garden,--the flowers to be taken care of," observed [MASK]. "I should keep myself healthy with exercise in the open air."
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Hepzibah	Now let [MASK] turn the old Pyncheon portraits with their faces to the wall, and take the map of her Eastern territory to kindle the kitchen fire, and blow up the flame with the empty breath of her ancestral traditions! What had she to do with ancestry?
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Ned	answered [MASK], sobbing. "They won't open the door; and I can't get my elephant!" "Go to school, you little scamp!" said the man. "There's another cent-shop round the corner.
<name>Maule</name>	Maule	Maule	The wrinkled note-shaver will have taken his railroad trip in vain. Half an hour later, in the street next to this, there was to be an auction of real estate, including a portion of the old Pyncheon property, originally belonging to [MASK]'s garden ground.
<name>Chanticleer</name>	Chanticleer	Chanticleer	Shortly after, there was a prodigious cackling and gratulation of [MASK] and all his family, including the wizened chicken, who appeared to understand the matter quite as well as did his sire, his mother, or his aunt.
<name>Paulina</name>	Paulina	Phoebe	"It is handsome!--it is very beautiful!" said [MASK] admiringly. "It is as sweet a face as a man's can be, or ought to be. It has something of a child's expression,--and yet not childish,--only one feels so very kindly towards him!
<name>Clifford</name>	Clifford	Clifford	But you were to be given back to me! Do you think, then, dear [MASK]," added she, with a wretched smile, "that I have brought an irretrievable disgrace on the old house, by opening a little shop in the front gable?
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Clifford	Children came running with their mothers' scissors, or the carving-knife, or the paternal razor, or anything else that lacked an edge (except, indeed, poor [MASK]'s wits), that the grinder might apply the article to his magic wheel, and give it back as good as new.
<name>Ilbrahim</name>	Ilbrahim	Maule	help!--his conscience never doubted it;--and, little more than a whisper to his ear, it was a dismal shriek, and long reechoed so, in the region round his heart! But this time the father did not turn. After a further interval, [MASK] spoke.
<name>Clifford</name>	Clifford	Clifford	But, as the sunlight left the peaks of the Seven Gables, so did the excitement fade out of [MASK]'s eyes. He gazed vaguely and mournfully about him, as if he missed something precious, and missed it the more drearily for not knowing precisely what it was.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Phoebe	Yes; and my words of wisdom, that you and [MASK] tell me of, are like the golden dandelions, which never grow in the hot months, but may be seen glistening among the withered grass, and under the dry leaves, sometimes as late as December.
<name>Priscilla</name>	Priscilla	Hepzibah	Before they left the breakfast-table, the shop-bell rang sharply, and [MASK] set down the remnant of her final cup of tea, with a look of sallow despair that was truly piteous to behold. In cases of distasteful occupation, the second day is generally worse than the first.
<name>Hepzibah</name>	Hepzibah	Hepzibah	I'm sure of it!" [MASK] fancied that there was something peculiar in her venerable friend's look and tone; insomuch, that she gazed into his face with considerable earnestness, endeavoring to discover what secret meaning, if any, might be lurking there.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Phoebe	You, who love everybody else in the world!" "Good-by, then," said [MASK] frankly. "I do not mean to be angry a great while, and should be sorry to have you think so.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Clifford	[MASK] is not now insane; but the interview which you insist upon may go far to make him so. Nevertheless, knowing you as I do, I believe it to be my best course to allow you to judge for yourself as to the improbability of his possessing any valuable secret.
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Malbone	There he seemed to sit, with a dim veil of decay and ruin betwixt him and the world, but through which, at flitting intervals, might be caught the same expression, so refined, so softly imaginative, which [MASK]--venturing a happy touch, with suspended breath--had imparted to the miniature!
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Alice	[MASK] complied, She was very proud. Setting aside all advantages of rank, this fair girl deemed herself conscious of a power--combined of beauty, high, unsullied purity, and the preservative force of womanhood--that could make her sphere impenetrable, unless betrayed by treachery within.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Phoebe	It really seemed as if the battered visage of the House of the Seven Gables, black and heavy-browed as it still certainly looked, must have shown a kind of cheerfulness glimmering through its dusky windows as [MASK] passed to and fro in the interior.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Phoebe	[MASK] put one of her small hands on each elbow of his chair, and leaned her face towards him, so that he might peruse it as carefully as he would. It is probable that the latent emotions of this parting hour had revived, in some degree, his bedimmed and enfeebled faculties.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Hepzibah	said [MASK] to herself, gulping down a very bitter emotion, and, since she could not rid herself of it, trying to drive it back into her heart. "What does he think of it, I wonder? Does it please him? Ah!
<name>Clifford</name>	Clifford	Clifford	Not to speak it harshly or scornfully, it seemed [MASK]'s nature to be a Sybarite. It was perceptible, even there, in the dark old parlor, in the inevitable polarity with which his eyes were attracted towards the quivering play of sunbeams through the shadowy foliage.
<name>Valentine</name>	Valentine	Alice	"I forbid your proceeding further!" "Pray, my dear father, do not interrupt the young man," said [MASK], without changing her position. "His efforts, I assure you, will prove very harmless."
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Phoebe	She went in quest of the miniature already described, and returned with it in her hand. Giving it to [MASK], she watched her features narrowly, and with a certain jealousy as to the mode in which the girl would show herself affected by the picture.
<name>Phileas</name>	Phileas	Clifford	"Then, sir," said the old gentleman, getting anxious to drop the subject, "you are not to blame for leaving it." "Within the lifetime of the child already born," [MASK] went on, "all this will be done away.
<name>Hepzibah</name>	Hepzibah	Clifford	The pitiable mockery of it, which the world might have been ready enough to offer, coming so long after the agony had done its utmost work, would have been fit only to provoke bitterer laughter than poor [MASK] was ever capable of.
<name>Heaven</name>	Heaven	Heaven	[MASK] help me!" she groaned mentally. "Now is my hour of need!" The door, which moved with difficulty on its creaking and rusty hinges, being forced quite open, a square and sturdy little urchin became apparent, with cheeks as red as an apple.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Phoebe	If I read your character rightly, [MASK]," he continued, fixing his eyes on hers with stern anxiety, intermixed with tenderness, "gentle as you are, and seeming to have your sphere among common things, you yet possess remarkable strength.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Phoebe	She would speak sharply to her; then, throwing aside all the starched reserve of her ordinary manner, ask pardon, and the next instant renew the just-forgiven injury. At last, when their mutual labor was all finished, she took [MASK]'s hand in her own trembling one.
<name>Providence</name>	Providence	Providence	"For what end," thought she, giving vent to that feeling of hostility which is the only real abasement of the poor in presence of the rich,--"for what good end, in the wisdom of [MASK], does that woman live?
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Hepzibah	"But perhaps you wish to speak with my cousin [MASK]. Shall I call her?" "Stay a moment, if you please," said the Judge, again beaming sunshine out of his face. "You seem to be a little nervous this morning.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Phoebe	In fact (not to attribute the whole gloom of sky and earth to the one inauspicious circumstance of [MASK]'s departure), an easterly storm had set in, and indefatigably apply itself to the task of making the black roof and walls of the old house look more cheerless than ever before.
<name>Clifford</name>	Clifford	Phoebe	Therefore, the Italian boy would not be discouraged by the heavy silence with which the old house seemed resolute to clog the vivacity of his instrument. He persisted in his melodious appeals; he still looked upward, trusting that his dark, alien countenance would soon be brightened by [MASK]'s sunny aspect.
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Phoebe	"I never did, but have a great curiosity to do so. And you judge favorably of the face?" "There never was a sweeter one," said [MASK]. "It is almost too soft and gentle for a man's."
<name>Heaven</name>	Heaven	Heaven	But there certainly is truth in what you have said. Most of my likenesses do look unamiable; but the very sufficient reason, I fancy, is, because the originals are so. There is a wonderful insight in [MASK]'s broad and simple sunshine.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Phoebe	" asked [MASK] with less reserve; for, in spite of prejudice, her own youthfulness sprang forward to meet his. "I don't much like pictures of that sort,--they are so hard and stern; besides dodging away from the eye, and trying to escape altogether.
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Phoebe	They both exist by you." "I should be very sorry to think so," answered [MASK] gravely. "But it is true that my small abilities were precisely what they needed; and I have a real interest in their welfare,--an odd kind of motherly
<name>Godfrey</name>	Godfrey	Clifford	Suspicion, unless averted, might fix upon the real offender. In the very presence of the dead man, therefore, he laid a scheme that should free himself at the expense of [MASK], his rival, for whose character he had at once a contempt and a repugnance.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Maule	It was not that he intended any rudeness or improper neglect,--which, indeed, he would have blushed to be guilty of,--but it never occurred to him that a person in [MASK]'s station had a claim on his courtesy, or would trouble himself about it one way or the other.
<name>Nello</name>	Nello	Phoebe	Neither was there any possibility of satisfying the covetous little devil. [MASK] threw down a whole handful of cents, which he picked up with joyless eagerness, handed them over to the Italian for safekeeping, and immediately recommenced a series of pantomimic petitions for more.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Clifford	The conductor now applied for their tickets; and [MASK], who had made himself the purse-bearer, put a bank-note into his hand, as he had observed others do. "For the lady and yourself?" asked the conductor.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Hepzibah	Finally, he made a long pause at the threshold of the parlor. He took hold of the knob of the door; then loosened his grasp without opening it. [MASK], her hands convulsively clasped, stood gazing at the entrance.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Dixey	said his friend. "I don't call it a very good stand. There's another shop just round the corner." "Make it go!" cried [MASK], with a most contemptuous expression, as if the very idea were impossible to be conceived.
<name>Dimmesdale</name>	Dimmesdale	Clifford	There was no free breath to be drawn, within the sphere of so malevolent an influence. The first effect of freedom, as we have witnessed in [MASK]'s aimless flight, was a tremulous exhilaration. Subsiding from it, he did not sink into his former intellectual apathy.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Hepzibah	How wonderfully responsive to every emotion of the human soul! In [MASK]'s tone, at that moment, there was a certain rich depth and moisture, as if the words, commonplace as they were, had been steeped in the warmth of her heart.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Phoebe	At any rate, [MASK] soon felt that, if not the profound insight of a seer, yet a more than feminine delicacy of appreciation, was making her heart the subject of its regard. A moment before, she had known nothing which she would have sought to hide.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Phoebe	It would have been kept in check, however, and even converted into an accomplishment, and one of the thousand modes of intellectual culture, had his more ethereal characteristics retained their vigor. But as it existed now, the effect was painful and made [MASK] droop her eyes.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Clifford	A moment before, she had known nothing which she would have sought to hide. Now, as if some secret were hinted to her own consciousness through the medium of another's perception, she was fain to let her eyelids droop beneath [MASK]'s gaze.
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Clifford	"Very great wrong! But I forgive it, and will study to make you think better of me. Of course, our poor [MASK] being in so unhappy a state of mind, I cannot think of urging an interview at present.
<name>Clare</name>	Clare	Hepzibah	If he does nothing worse, he may set the house on fire!" "Why, sometimes," answered [MASK], "I have seriously made it a question, whether I ought not to send him away.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Clifford	She knocked a third time, three regular strokes, gentle, but perfectly distinct, and with meaning in them; for, modulate it with what cautious art we will, the hand cannot help playing some tune of what we feel upon the senseless wood. [MASK] returned no answer.
<name>Clarence</name>	Clarence	Hepzibah	"It was not kind to say so, [MASK]! What shame can befall me now?" And then the unnerved man--he that had been born for enjoyment, but had met a doom so very wretched--burst into a woman's passion of tears.
<name>Phileas</name>	Phileas	Phoebe	"The secret is," said [MASK], smiling, "that I have learned how to talk with hens and chickens." "Ah, but these hens," answered the young man,--"these hens of aristocratic lineage would scorn to understand the vulgar language of a barn-yard fowl.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Clifford	[MASK] had not laughed, pointed, beckoned her away with him; but she had merely been afflicted--as lonely sleepers often are--with a great deal of unreasonable misery, in a morning dream! "Now--now--I shall certainly awake!"
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Clifford	Here and there, amid the rumble and the tumult, sat one asleep. Sleep; sport; business; graver or lighter study; and the common and inevitable movement onward! It was life itself! [MASK]'s naturally poignant sympathies were all aroused.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Phoebe	The butter must not be forgotten,--butter which [MASK] herself had churned, in her own rural home, and brought it to her cousin as a propitiatory gift,--smelling of clover-blossoms, and diffusing the charm of pastoral scenery through the dark-panelled parlor.
<name>Satan</name>	Satan	Satan	To be the sport of boys, who, when old enough to run about the streets, have no more reverence for what is beautiful and holy, nor pity for what is sad,--no more sense of sacred misery, sanctifying the human shape in which it embodies itself,--than if [MASK] were the father of them all!
<name>Hepzibah</name>	Hepzibah	Hepzibah	But, taking the inward and outward history of the first half-day into consideration, [MASK] began to fear that the shop would prove her ruin in a moral and religious point of view, without contributing very essentially towards even her temporal welfare.
<name>Chanticleer</name>	Chanticleer	Chanticleer	The chicken crept through the pales of the coop and ran, with some show of liveliness, to her feet; while [MASK] and the ladies of his household regarded her with queer, sidelong glances, and then croaked one to another, as if communicating their sage opinions of her character.
<name>Priscilla</name>	Priscilla	Phoebe	Do you know of any new trouble hanging over my poor relatives? If so, tell me at once, and I will not leave them!" "Forgive me, [MASK]!" said the daguerreotypist, holding out his hand, to which the girl was constrained to yield her own.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Phoebe	[MASK], just at the critical moment, drew back; so that her highly respectable kinsman, with his body bent over the counter and his lips protruded, was betrayed into the rather absurd predicament of kissing the empty air.
<name>He</name>	He	Clifford	Had [MASK] attained the balcony, he would probably have leaped into the street; but whether impelled by the species of terror that sometimes urges its victim over the very precipice which he shrinks from, or by a natural magnetism, tending towards the great centre of humanity, it were not easy to decide.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Phoebe	At such a crisis, there is no death; for immortality is revealed anew, and embraces everything in its hallowed atmosphere. But how soon the heavy earth-dream settled down again! "Hark!" whispered [MASK]. "Somebody is at the street door!"
<name>Clive</name>	Clive	Clifford	Their voices, also, were very pleasant to him, heard at a distance, all swarming and intermingling together as flies do in a sunny room. [MASK] would, doubtless, have been glad to share their sports.
<name>Edmund</name>	Edmund	Clifford	The latter might probably have been won for him, had those on whom the guardianship of his welfare had fallen deemed it advisable to expose [MASK] to a miserable resuscitation of past ideas, when the condition of whatever comfort he might expect lay in the calm of forgetfulness.
<name>Eustacia</name>	Eustacia	Phoebe	Let us allow him integrity, also, forever after to be confided in; since he forbade himself to twine that one link more which might have rendered his spell over [MASK] indissoluble. He made a slight gesture upward with his hand.
<name>Clifford</name>	Clifford	Clifford	"A visitor, my dear cousin!--do you call me so?" cried the Judge, whose sensibility, it seems, was hurt by the coldness of the phrase. "Nay, then, let me be [MASK]'s host, and your own likewise.
<name>Hepzibah</name>	Hepzibah	Phoebe	You shall see that I am as nice a little saleswoman as I am a housewife!" The old gentlewoman stole behind [MASK], and peeped from the passageway into the shop, to note how she would manage her undertaking. It was a case of some intricacy.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Phoebe	When [MASK] was quite dressed, she peeped out of the window, and saw a rosebush in the garden. Being a very tall one, and of luxuriant growth, it had been propped up against the side of the house, and was literally covered with a rare and very beautiful species of white rose.
<name>Clifford</name>	Clifford	Clifford	Your poor cousin [MASK] is another dead and long-buried person, on whom the governor and council have wrought a necromantic miracle. I should not wonder if he were to crumble away, some morning, after you are gone, and nothing be seen of him more, except a heap of dust.
<name>Hannah</name>	Hannah	Hepzibah	A foot was heard scraping itself on the threshold, and thence somewhat ponderously stepping on the floor. [MASK] delayed a moment, while muffling herself in a faded shawl, which had been her defensive armor in a forty years' warfare against the east wind.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Phoebe	[MASK] soon saw it likewise, and gave him the sort of confidence which such a certainty inspires. She was startled, however, and sometimes repelled,--not by any doubt of his integrity to whatever law he acknowledged, but by a sense that his law differed from her own.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Holgrave	After a little while, the twilight, deepened by the shadows of the fruit-trees and the surrounding buildings, threw an obscurity over the garden. "There," said [MASK], "it is time to give over work!
<name>Tradition</name>	Tradition	Tradition,--which	As none such is on record, it is safe to assume that none existed. [MASK] sometimes brings down truth that history has let slip, but is oftener the wild babble of the time, such as was formerly spoken at the fireside and now congeals in newspapers,--tradition is responsible for all contrary averments.
<name>Hepzibah</name>	Hepzibah	Hepzibah	She had come forward,--our poor, gaunt [MASK], in her rusty silks, with her rigid joints, and the sad perversity of her scowl,--ready to do her utmost; and with affection enough, if that were all, to do a hundred times as much!
<name>Clifford</name>	Clifford	Clifford	But it came not, that awakening moment! It came not, even when, just before they left the house, [MASK] stole to the parlor-door, and made a parting obeisance to the sole occupant of the room. "What an absurd figure the old fellow cuts now!
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Clifford	"Angry!" she repeated; "angry with you, [MASK]!" Her tone, as she uttered the exclamation, had a plaintive and really exquisite melody thrilling through it, yet without subduing a certain something which an obtuse auditor might still have mistaken for asperity.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Phoebe	And then, while the yellow richness of the declining sunshine still fell into the open space of the garden, [MASK] brought out a loaf of bread and a china bowl of currants, freshly gathered from the bushes, and crushed with sugar.
<name>Miles</name>	Miles	Holgrave	"Oh, I am pursuing my studies here; not in books, however," replied [MASK]. "The house, in my view, is expressive of that odious and abominable Past, with all its bad influences, against which I have just been declaiming.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hepzibah	A powerful excitement had given him energy and vivacity. Its operation over, he forthwith began to sink. "You must take the lead now, [MASK]!" murmured he, with a torpid and reluctant utterance. "Do with me as you will!"
<name>Clifford</name>	Clifford	Phoebe	At the first glance, [MASK] saw an elderly personage, in an old-fashioned dressing-gown of faded damask, and wearing his gray or almost white hair of an unusual length. It quite overshadowed his forehead, except when he thrust it back, and stared vaguely about the room.
<name>Goodman</name>	Goodman	Maule	"Here I am!" said [MASK] sternly. "Show me the way to your master's parlor." As he stept into the house, a note of sweet and melancholy music thrilled and vibrated along the passage-way, proceeding from one of the rooms above stairs.
<name>Hilda</name>	Hilda	Phoebe	Thus the artist, whatever he might judge of [MASK]'s capacity, was beguiled, by some silent charm of hers, to talk freely of what he dreamed of doing in the world. He poured himself out as to another self.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Phoebe	And especially now, while, with her crested teaspoons and antique china, she was flattering herself with ideas of gentility, she felt an unspeakable disinclination to confront a customer. "Do not trouble yourself, dear cousin!" cried [MASK], starting lightly up.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Clifford	It is not probable, be it said, that he acted with any set purpose of involving [MASK] in a charge of murder. Knowing that his uncle did not die by violence, it may not have occurred to him, in the hurry of the crisis, that such an inference might be drawn.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dixey	And one of the Judge's hired men has been in, this morning, to make inquiry about him. He's a kind of person, they say, that seldom breaks his habits, or stays out o' nights." "Oh, he'll turn up safe enough!" said [MASK].
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Phoebe	It was strangely indistinct, however, and less like articulate words than an unshaped sound, such as would be the utterance of feeling and sympathy, rather than of the intellect. So vague was it, that its impression or echo in [MASK]'s mind was that of unreality.
<name>Ida</name>	Ida	Phoebe	It pleased him best, however, when she sat on a low footstool at his knee. It is perhaps remarkable, considering her temperament, that [MASK] oftener chose a strain of pathos than of gayety. But the young and happy are not ill pleased to temper their life with a transparent shadow.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Phoebe	He saw [MASK], however, and caught an illumination from her youthful and pleasant aspect, which, indeed, threw a cheerfulness about the parlor, like the circle of reflected brilliancy around the glass vase of flowers that was standing in the sunshine.
<name>Clifford</name>	Clifford	Clifford	She grew more thoughtful than heretofore. Looking aside at [MASK]'s face, and seeing the dim, unsatisfactory elegance and the intellect almost quenched, she would try to inquire what had been his life. Was he always thus?
<name>Pauline</name>	Pauline	Phoebe	"O [MASK]!" murmured she, "that man has been the horror of my life! Shall I never, never have the courage,--will my voice never cease from trembling long enough to let me tell him what he is?" "Is he so very wicked?"
<name>Providence</name>	Providence	Providence	It smote her with the wretched conviction that [MASK] intermeddled not in these petty wrongs of one individual to his fellow, nor had any balm for these little agonies of a solitary soul; but shed its justice, and its mercy, in a broad, sunlike sweep, over half the universe at once.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Hepzibah	"Now--now--I shall certainly awake!" thought [MASK], as she went to and fro, making her little preparations. "I can bear it no longer I must wake up now!" But it came not, that awakening moment!
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Holgrave	[MASK] took his departure, leaving her, for the moment, with spirits not quite so much depressed. Soon, however, they had subsided nearly to their former dead level. With a beating heart, she listened to the footsteps of early passengers, which now began to be frequent along the street.
<name>Georgiana</name>	Georgiana	Hepzibah	At the head of the stairs, however, she met [MASK], who, it being still early, invited her into a room which she would probably have called her boudoir, had her education embraced any such French phrase.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hepzibah	Through dreary years [MASK] had looked forward--for the most part despairingly, never with any confidence of hope, but always with the feeling that it was her brightest possibility--to the very position in which she now found herself.
<name>Lucetta</name>	Lucetta	Hepzibah	Looking somewhat chagrined, he put the coin into [MASK]'s hand, and departed, sending the second Jim Crow in quest of the former one. The new shop-keeper dropped the first solid result of her commercial enterprise into the till. It was done!
<name>Weller</name>	Weller	Clifford	"You are a strange man; Sir!" said the old gentleman, bringing his gimlet-eye to a point on [MASK], as if determined to bore right into him. "I can't see through you!" "No, I'll be bound you can't!"
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Clifford	He is a determined and relentless man, with the genuine character of an inquisitor; and had he any object to gain by putting [MASK] to the rack, I verily believe that he would wrench his joints from their sockets, in order to accomplish it.
