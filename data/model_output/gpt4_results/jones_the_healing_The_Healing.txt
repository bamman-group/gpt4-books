<name>Calder</name>	Calder	Nicholas	And he’s got all these security guards. He’s a paranoid fool, but he’s a likable man. When the television camera panned the Fasig-Tipton sales arena, you know the tent where they have the sales, in the background, near a post, stood [MASK].
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Joan	Tufts of curly hair peeked out from his broad chest. His skin was a wine-colored brown and he wore a mustache, like I told you, and had the look of a man I can only describe as being of another generation, though he’s [MASK]’s and my generation.
<name>Arturo</name>	Arturo	Jimmy	[MASK]’s always excellent, he’s like caviar, she says. How’d I do? How’d I sing? Did you like the new songs? Did you like the corrido? He’s teaching me a canto hondo. Yes. Very much.
<name>Orpheus</name>	Orpheus	Joan	She went to a tall, brown-skinned man standing near the edge of the stage, his arms folded, sullen. I’d noticed him when I’d been peeking through the curtain. He was sitting there watching [MASK] but looking like he felt himself superior to the music.
<name>Biggie</name>	Biggie	Josef	Not to win, just to show. [MASK] ain’t say who he bet on, ’cause he ain’t bet on them horses. He owns thoroughbreds, but he don’t usually bet on none of them horses. He just mostly likes to watch them run.
<name>Orleans</name>	Orleans	Nicholas	Is it you and him? But I shake my head. And N’Orleans, that ain’t my true name, that just his sometimes name for me. Then he whispers, He’s free. Who’s free? [MASK]?
<name>Yolanda</name>	Yolanda	Joan	[MASK] likes to read shit like that. Me I’m watching the Comedy Channel. A show called Politically Incorrect. Say what? I said I can’t remember my dreams anymore. When I was a little girl I used to remember my dreams all the time.
<name>John</name>	John	Norvelle	Tell me some more about that ex-husband of yours. Seem like you got a good memory for everything but that. My husband, [MASK], like I told you, is a medical anthropologist who collects medical folklore.
<name>she</name>	she	Joan	African-American Association of Research Scientists. Of course, there aren’t as many of us. And fewer women than men. I lift another green bean. I think he’s going to say something about [MASK] wasting her talents, her intelligence.
<name>Europeans</name>	Europeans	Brazilians	And then she said something again about colored people’s fragile hair. I guess it take them [MASK] to discover something like that for us hair. You come and help me wash out my brushes, she said, when I stayed seated at the counter.
<name>John</name>	John	Josef	He gotta be taciturn ’cause he don’t have the disposition of a shy man. And that probably in his job description, that he supposed to be taciturn. Will he disappear again? I ask. When we want him to, says [MASK].
<name>Chico</name>	Chico	Jamey	You only get me third-rate gigs, and [MASK]. . . . he don’t believe in me. He don’t owe you his belief. And I have gotten you some first-rate gigs, they just ain’t in the States, and you think only the States is first- rate.
<name>Billie</name>	Billie	Joan	I dig into a bowl of pomegranates on the night table, lean back on the pillow and listen to more [MASK]. The lampshades looks like they’s stain-glassed windows. At one moment her voice is a porcupine, then it’s butter.
<name>Salinger</name>	Salinger	James	Then she picked up one of [MASK]’ half-used cigarettes, lit it with one of them antique cameo-type lighter, one of them real expensive-looking lighter, and puffed. So what’s the story? I asked. What do you mean?
<name>Europeans</name>	Europeans	Europeans	Of course, I speak good English. It’s only you Americans who don’t want to learn anybody’s language but your own. You celebrate that in yourselves, but to us [MASK] it’s a flaw in the American character, one of the many flaws in the American character.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Josef	Ain’t he cute? I asked. Naw, he ain’t cute. I mean [MASK], not the yearling. He ain’t cute. He’s beautiful. She sulked and bit into her croissant. How’d you meet him anyway? I told you.
<name>She</name>	She	Josef	Then she pencil something onto a folded newspaper, onto the racing form. Look like one of them types who addicted to gambling. One of them prime candidates for Gamblers Anonymous. Which one did you bet on this time? [MASK] ask when I come from the window.
<name>Darwin</name>	Darwin	Josef	[MASK] too watching me. With that cold-type curiosity. Somebody say that the curiosity of a rational man. Then he hold out his hand and I enter the river again. Do you want to go horseback riding? he ask when he come out the bathroom.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Abio	[MASK]—that’s my husband—and I, we both love your music. We love it. Of course I love it more than he does, because.. . . Well, you know how men are. There are things that a woman sings, and only a woman knows the full meaning.
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Josef	He dressed in dark trousers and a beige shirt, and wearing a tie but no jacket. He as dark-skinned as [MASK], like I said, but his eyes and eyebrows slant up kinda like an Asian’s, at least the stereotype of them
<name>He</name>	He	Joan	To tell the truth I wanted to wipe that bit of banana bread from his lip myself, or lick it from his lip, or kiss it from his lip, and then, Say what? I asked. [MASK] told me you’re a good manager, he said.
<name>Forrest</name>	Forrest	Italian	Lotta Americans think of that pizza as American food as much as they do [MASK]. But he say he ain’t never had none of that pizza. So I’d ordered us some. Eating his he said he knew why he’d never had pizza.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Josef	He’s rode in a coupla races, nothing spectacular. He wouldn’t tell me the name of the jockey, though. [MASK]’s car is waiting. The driver puts the bag in the trunk and opens the door for me.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Grandmother	When [MASK] finished putting them new beauty products on the shelves, she braided my hair. In the long mirror, I could see her. I could see her hunched shoulders that looked as if they had really gotten hunched like that from wearing a fake turtle shell.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Joan	How can you listen to that shit? I asked. I don’t know about people like you, you know. These are real people, said [MASK]. This is how the world really is. That Josef of yours he’s a right to be paranoid.
<name>Ray</name>	Ray	Joan	Say what? [MASK] was standing in the doorway watching us. Your ex-wife was watching us. I don’t know why I call her his ex-wife, ’cause he know that. Unless I’m telling myself she his ex-wife.
<name>John</name>	John	Nicholas	He ain’t had that in his witnessing before. Least he ain’t said I’m trying to heal everybody. I come forward and take his hand again. I’m considered a tall woman, but beside [MASK] I just look average height. Yes! someone shout.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Sandovar	[MASK]! I yelled. We hugged and hugged. Now, he said, with his winnings, he could take his wife and children to another country. He said he didn’t like his country and wanted to emigrate to another one.
<name>Ulysses</name>	Ulysses	Jamey	We couldn’t compete with that promised land or that ideal of a woman. I don’t know. But I think a man like [MASK] could love a woman just the way she is. Or how it pleases herself to be.
<name>Steppenwolf</name>	Steppenwolf	Savage	She ain’t told me that her middle name. Or maybe that her maiden name, but I think that her middle name. I know there’s a Hermione in her favorite book—that’s Steppenwolf. Her husband name [MASK], so she use that for her stage name.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Joan	I sat as far back as possible from the screen, but [MASK] pulled her armchair up to the screen, as close as she could get while the eyewitnesses spoke of their terrors. They crowded us into a room, and then tossed a canister of some contagion.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Cayenne	[MASK]’s hair’s in spit curls; she wears a white sweater and a blue, flared skirt. On her feet are tennis shoes. Pink ones. I can walk you home when you’re ready, I say. No, no, no, no.
<name>Ring</name>	Ring	Joan	[MASK] apologized for something, but I didn’t understand it—some private matter. I thought of the Ring Lardner story in which the man can’t go to bed without apologizing for something; he apologizes even to his shaver before shaving.
<name>Mouse</name>	Mouse	Possum	She said again this was her first time in a beauty shop, that she’d never had her hair professionally done before. Her timidity reminded me of me at her age, when they used to call me [MASK]. This your first time in a beauty parlor?
<name>Scotch</name>	Scotch	Rocks	Scotch? Scotch, with some soda. She was up and at the oak bar. It was rough-hewn like the table, but well stocked. [MASK]? She glanced over her shoulder. Yeah. He’s handsome, I said. She gulped her bourbon.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Harlie	It was only until someone else came into the outer office, a demure-looking young woman, that he rushed us into his. Have a seat, gals, he said. He rushed out the terms of the contract. So what do you think, [MASK]?
<name>Elvis</name>	Elvis	Elvis	But then in some of them documentaries you got the King saying that his style of singing was influenced by listening to black people’s music. Of course they don’t mention the colored people every time they mention [MASK].
<name>Yoko</name>	Yoko	Joan	Ike, I mean her husband ain’t in show business, you know. He some kinda scientist. But [MASK] a rock star. Well, she ain’t exactly a star. And ain’t exactly a bitch. She just likes to call herself a bitch, you know.
<name>Guido</name>	Guido	Joan	He wanted to come here. Mi sono uniformato ai suoi voleri. Ha un talento enorme. He has an enormous talent, so I simply conformed to his will. The heat in the dressing room made [MASK]’s zebra stripes begin to look like zebra swirls.
<name>Clayton</name>	Clayton	Josef	I believed in you. I sip the Screwdriver. And now I will tell you the truth of it. [MASK] has gone out to check on one of his Thoroughbreds, like I told you, and left us alone together with drinks. But it is not intoxication.
<name>Chameleon</name>	Chameleon	Nicholas	I just pull my dress down and climb out. [MASK] comes with us as far as the betting windows. I place a bet and when I turn he ain’t there. Finally, I puzzle him out, like a chameleon at the edge of the crowd.
<name>Me</name>	Me	Onore	A game they enjoy to play, and we’re the pawns. All women. [MASK]. You, though, you look like you’re fortunato in amove. You look like you have a man who really loves you. But men, we’re pawns to them.
<name>She</name>	She	Joan	Read the book too. It’s based on her auto- biography. The book moves back and forth in time, though, more than the movie. You think you’re in one time and the next chapter you’re in another. [MASK] says it’s
<name>Hemingway</name>	Hemingway	Shakespeare	He knows what a man wants, and what a man thinks a woman wants, even the best of women. He’s good at portraying bitches, but even they’re a man’s idea of a bitch. You know, even [MASK]’s sweet bitches are still a man’s idea of a sweet bitch.
<name>McDunn</name>	McDunn	Jaboti	Then how that any different from [MASK]’s logic. But truth from truth can’t be the fallacy of contrary propositions, can it? Ain’t truth and truth the same thing? What the opposite of the fallacy of contrary propositions? The fallacy of equivalent propositions?
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Joan	I’m still laying in the bed, looking like a fool and rubbing my shoulder, then I get up and get dressed. Unhurriedly. When I go downstairs, [MASK] in the living room, sitting with her long legs thrown over the arm of the sofa and still looking nonchalant.
<name>Watusi</name>	Watusi	Watusi	He remind me of a man I seen once at a carnival, though. They had him advertised as the tallest man in the natural world. The poster advertising him say he the tallest man in the natural world. Look like one of them [MASK].
<name>Corrie</name>	Corrie	Joan	Yeah, [MASK] is enough to manage, isn’t she? And then I’m thinking, he every man I know. He ain’t just hisself, he every man I know. But then men, they’s supposed to talk like that.
<name>Shug</name>	Shug	Joan	That new book I told you about: Symmetry, Matrices, and Molecular Orbital Theory, he say, and that [MASK] looking at him like she know exactly what symmetry, matrices, and molecular orbital theory mean. He start to say something else about that book he working on, but he don’t.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Joan	He put out the new cigarette. I’ve stocked the refrigerator and the bar, he say swiftly to [MASK], but still looking at her feet. He pick up a brass tray from the mantelpiece, look at its content of butts, put it down.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Joan	Un poco. Molto poco. Non lo pronuncio molto bene. Oh, yes you do, very well. You’ve got a very good Italian accent. Che belleza! You’re a great beauty, [MASK] commented. I can understand why the men fought over you.
<name>Shakespeare</name>	Shakespeare	Freud	I think it’s got something to do with sex, but it ain’t. It’s got something to do with wit. I mean the title of that book says something about wit not sex. I didn’t know that [MASK] wrote about wit.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jamey	I remember when I had my first date, this guy says, You know, your complexion isn’t so flawless up close. So what did that have to do with anything? You know. And then [MASK]. My first line in my forehead he notices.
<name>Seabiscuit</name>	Seabiscuit	Nicodemus	The one come telling me [MASK] free. Well, I’d come to the racetrack five o’clock in the morning ’cause they say you gotta come that early to watch them walk the horses and then most people have breakfast at the track restaurant.
<name>Ygritte</name>	Ygritte	Joan	Outside, the stable boy leads out his stallion and my mare. So is this the monster mare? I ask. So what do I do first? First you get on, he replies. I peek over his shoulder to see [MASK] standing in the doorway.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Darling	But we’re divorced. Why shouldn’t he have other women? Why shouldn’t he have younger women even? I don’t own him, but sometimes I think he still thinks he owns me, though. Did you hear him call me [MASK]? Yes?
<name>Elvis</name>	Elvis	Nicholas	The base of them is stovepipe-shaped and then at the top they’s what looks like a dunce cap. And he got one of his security people sitting inside that dunce cap. And I think [MASK]’ room somewhere up in that turret.
<name>Gran</name>	Gran	Martha	Must tire you out so them healings, says [MASK]. Although she’s made all that strawberry pie and all them sweet cakes, she’s only got a little corn pudding on her plate. I healed her colitis years ago, but she still just nibbles.
<name>Amalia</name>	Amalia	Abio	But we both love your music very much, [MASK] and I. Thank you. You were good, you know. I thought you were a professional yourself. You should be onstage. I’m very aggressive, no? But I’ve never had the desire for show business.
<name>Blue</name>	Blue	Harlan	I’m about to call him some paranoid fool, again, but he reach over and touch my jaw, his horse trotting sideways. Mine nibble grass. What are you? he ask. Who are you? A spy in the house of love. Who are you? I’m just [MASK].
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Joan’ll	I couldn’t get tickets. I say nothing. I think [MASK] say something about getting him tickets, but she don’t. Maybe the three of us could have lunch tomorrow? he asks. There’s a nice little French restaurant I saw around the corner.
<name>Elvis</name>	Elvis	Jack	Reminds you of [MASK], don’t it? Certain things don’t belong in no song, my mother said. There’s certain things that just don’t belong in songs, whether it’s rap or rock ’n’ roll. Where is all the intelligent music that people usedta sing?
<name>He</name>	He	Josef	I ain’t no experienced rider, y’all know. [MASK] reach out and steady her, and make that clicking sound. Naw, I ain’t no spy, I say. Then I imagine lighting up a cigarette and blowing rings of smoke in the air above him.
<name>Tracy</name>	Tracy	Joan	You were great, I’d say again. Don’t toady me. I really fucked up tonight. I’d poured myself a glass of bourbon and her a glass of a weird favorite, a combination of tomato and pineapple juice. They love you out there, [MASK].
<name>Zora</name>	Zora	Peacocking	Ah got more intelligence than Ah need, and more intelligence than you think Ah got, but less intelligence than Ah want. I manage my own career now, boy, she added, strutting about the room. [MASK].
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	James	She got up, danced over to the bar, carried the bottle of bourbon back and set it on the table. She gave me a sullen look. Then she reached for another of [MASK]’ unfinished cigarettes, lit it and puffed.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Norvelle	But it was only when the group was about ready to leave—still talking of the cave fish—that [MASK] spoke to me. I enjoyed our stay very much, he said, as we stood together in the supply room where rows and rows of cosmetics and hair care products were stored.
<name>Ulysses</name>	Ulysses	Sandovar	I’ll consider your proposal, he said. At least, I might know some other people you can submit it to. Had he invited her here or had she invited herself? Was she still on that old chestnut about trying to free [MASK]?
<name>Ray</name>	Ray	Joan	I know that ni hao, that the only Chinese I know. And what’s that other Chinese I picked up from [MASK]? Ni shi neiguo ren? That mean, Where do you come from? Seem like people need to know that in everybody language.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Joan	No, a sloe gin fizz. And a bowl of pretzels. Lady. . . . He handed me my drink and a bowl of pretzels and I went back to the table. So who was he? [MASK] asked when I sat down, saying nothing.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Joan	I mean, he’s still his own man. I mean, he works for me but he’s still his own man. [MASK] grabs my arm as I enter the recording studio. I wink at the guitar player who’s leaning against the wall.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Joan	Even our writers don’t write tales of invisible women, at least none I’ve read. Anyway, [MASK] started singing at a local nightclub rather than be anyone’s work-study assistant. I don’t think it was harassment, though.
<name>Nettie</name>	Nettie	Martha	Why don’t y’all come back and help me pack the cakes and my strawberry pie, says [MASK]. I thought we’d have us light ham and potato soup—for her—before we go on account of all that healing she be doing.
<name>Caravaggio</name>	Caravaggio	Bastards	I don’t have any disillusions about it, because I’ve never had any illusions. [MASK] everywhere. He wanted to come here. Mi sono uniformato ai suoi voleri. Ha un talento enorme. He has an enormous talent, so I simply conformed to his will.
<name>Billie</name>	Billie	Joan	Come to my dressing room, come with me, will you? asked [MASK]. Is it okay if I bring my husband? asked the woman. Sure. She went to a tall, brown-skinned man standing near the edge of the stage, his arms folded, sullen.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Joan	And you’re his moglie? asked [MASK]. She glanced at me. I love the Italian word for it. It sounds just like what we are. What they want us to be. It sounds more like that than the word wife, doesn’t it?
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Norvelle	I asked [MASK], as we lay on mats in a curtained-off corner of the hut. She’s a treasure chest of medical folklore, he said. She’s a treasure. Why, I could write a whole book about her.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jimmy	Yes. Very much. You sounded real good. You know you always sound good. And your songs are always intelligent. You’re just saying that. You know I like to hear you tell me that I’m good. [MASK]’s always excellent, though.
<name>Lila</name>	Lila	Joan	She played with them like fingerpaints, first her knee and then her elbow. Though she looked distracted, she was listening intently. I could always tell. 11 paese dell’abbondanza, [MASK] said wryly. I don’t know what she meant. Abandoned country?
<name>Granny</name>	Granny	Nicholas	Fle’s on a roll. . . . And him? Perhaps he’s merely looking like a man who knows the truth of it. I thought she were a witch or something at first, says [MASK]. Even she didn’t know what she were.
<name>Yoko</name>	Yoko	Jamey	I think you’re ambivalent about fame. You want to be a rock star. A rock singer. Stardom is your game. Well, whatever you want to be you always sabotage yourself. When you and [MASK] don’t sabotage me. How do I sabotage you?
<name>Moira</name>	Moira	Joan	He bends and kisses [MASK]’s cheek, nods to me, and leaves. There is an odor like lavender and brandy. Not a heavy odor, a light one. And a hint of tobacco. He still presents a fine figure, doesn’t he?
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Josef	They don’t bet on the winning horses, they bet on the winning jockeys. When my horse— runs with a steady speed, but always follows the winners—show, [MASK] held my waist and laugh. Do you always win? he ask.
<name>Shaquille</name>	Shaquille	Nadine	We ain’t nothing alike to me, don’t even look alike, but a lot of people say we kinda alike, you know. We kinda talk alike, but we ain’t nothing alike. People say I’m a big woman, but [MASK]’s sorta a giant compared to me.
<name>Savage</name>	Savage	Miss	and he never called me by my first name, like the other professors. He called me [MASK], well my name wasn’t Savage then, but it might as well have been, the way he said it. But I liked the way he said it.
<name>Myrtle</name>	Myrtle	Grandmother	Every time they got dusty, she’d diligently take them down and clean and polish them. [MASK] called them whatnots. My mother attended church regularly and believed in the Bible passage which said: Whatever you do to the least of my brethren, you do to me.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Joan	The nerds. Of course, we scientists have a range of personality types like anyone else. But [MASK]’s more spontaneous and witty than most of the so-called rational types. Maybe it’s just her ego. Or I guess she prefers the limelight.
<name>Shakespeare</name>	Shakespeare	Shakespeare	I mean, the poet. Naw, not [MASK]. He knows what a man wants, and what a man thinks a woman wants, even the best of women. He’s good at portraying bitches, but even they’re a man’s idea of a bitch.
<name>Seabiscuit</name>	Seabiscuit	Josef	She gave me a fierce look, as if she were not yet broken in, but I knew she was. I’d seen her maiden race, and I had the autograph of the jockey who rode her. She’s top-class, said [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Norvelle	What’s going on? I asked [MASK]. She claims that he put love magic in it. That he put some sort of love magic in it so that you’d love him more than anyone else in the world. Did he put love magic in it?
<name>Chappelle</name>	Chappelle	Joan	I don’t think she’s a tramp, though. Maybe she satirizes the tramp ideal or the ideal tramp. I think she just, you know, satirizes pop American culture, and people think that’s her. Like maybe [MASK] satirizes pop African-American culture.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Josef	You won’t be as pretty with your hair all bleached out. He patted her. She’s a good girl. Someone came up behind me. Thinking it was [MASK] and without turning around, I grabbed at his hands and caressed them.
<name>Nettie</name>	Nettie	Joan	Seem like that one of them Anais Nin books. I think she mighta even published that book her ownself, ’cause seem like [MASK] say a lot of them books she collect the authors have to publish they ownself, you know. But it’s also a song title.
<name>Rosa</name>	Rosa	Hush	[MASK]. And then there’s that smallish woman from the bus. I ain’t think she believed, but she come up. She ain’t got no visible ailment either, but she got what them psychiatrists refer to as “incipient insanity.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Joan	It was good to meet you, he muttered, staring at me finally. But then he looking at me like he ain’t so sure we know each other. I’ll probably see you before you leave, he says. Stay for dinner, [MASK] say.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Carolina	That’s what you mean. That’s what you mean. I thought you meant that. What? I do not understand, said [MASK]. What do I mean? Should I excuse myself? What’ll you do if your university can’t help you?
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Josef	This is really something, I say. What? ask [MASK]. I explain that I ain’t never been in one of the boxes with the celebrities and the rich and famous. You mean you haven’t charmed your way in? I say nothing.
<name>Jamey</name>	Jamey	Joan	I still have a great allegiance to my Jamey. But I ain’t a pawn in no man’s game. You others can be, but not this bogger. In the hotel room, while [MASK] is sleeping, I turn on the videotape.
<name>fuck</name>	fuck	Jane	I don’t know if I can say screw on TV. Can I say screw on TV? Yeah, sure. I don’t think you can say [MASK] on TV, though. I’m just kidding ya.
<name>Prince</name>	Prince	Miles	On the wall, a tapestry of birds of paradise. I awoke, curled up on somebody’s sofa. There were people in the room. Partying people, show business people, holding drinks and paper plates and some near the stereo dancing. A couple near the stereo dancing to [MASK].
