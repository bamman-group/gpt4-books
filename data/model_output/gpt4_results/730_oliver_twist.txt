<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Oliver	The blessing was from a young child's lips, but it was the first that [MASK] had ever heard invoked upon his head; and through the struggles and sufferings, and troubles and changes, of his after life, he never once forgot it. CHAPTER VIII
<name>Nancy</name>	Nancy	Nancy	'Good-night, [MASK],' said the Jew, muffling himself up as before. 'Good-night.' Their eyes met, and the Jew scrutinised her, narrowly. There was no flinching about the girl.
<name>Fagin</name>	Fagin	Fagin	'Don't mind me, my dear,' said [MASK], drawing his chair closer. 'Ha! ha! it was lucky it was only me that heard you by chance. It was very lucky it was only me.'
<name>Fagin</name>	Fagin	Fagin	As he arrived at this apostrophe, he again rolled upon the door-step, and laughed louder than before. 'What'll [MASK] say?' inquired the Dodger; taking advantage of the next interval of breathlessness on the part of his friend to propound the question.
<name>Fagin</name>	Fagin	Fagin	he said; 'or if you don't, it shall be for want of breath. Open your mouth and say wot you've got to say in plain words. Out with it, you thundering old cur, out with it!' 'Suppose that lad that's laying there--' [MASK] began.
<name>Tod</name>	Tod	Toby	I went up there and see it with my own eyes--is filled with traps.' 'This is a smash,' observed [MASK], biting his lips. 'There's more than one will go with this.'
<name>Fagin</name>	Fagin	Fagin	'[MASK],' said the jailer. 'That's me!' cried the Jew, falling instantly, into the attitude of listening he had assumed upon his trial. 'An old man, my Lord; a very old, old man!'
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Rose	'But why,' said the young man, 'why run the chance of that occurring which so nearly happened? If [MASK] had--I cannot utter that word now--if this illness had terminated differently, how could you ever have forgiven yourself!
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Sikes	'True.' They were silent again. 'Damn you all!' said [MASK], passing his hand across his forehead. 'Have you nothing to say to me?' There was an uneasy movement among them, but nobody spoke.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Chitling	'He's drunk it all up, every drop,' said [MASK] after watching the dog some time in silence. 'Covered with mud--lame--half blind--he must have come a long way.' 'Where can he have come from!'
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Sikes	'Keep back the dog; he'll tear the boy to pieces.' 'Serve him right!' cried [MASK], struggling to disengage himself from the girl's grasp. 'Stand off from me, or I'll split your head against the wall.'
<name>Toby</name>	Toby	Toby	You can't do it without me, I know; but it's best to be on the safe side when one deals with you.' 'As you like, my dear, as you like' replied the Jew. 'Is there no help wanted, but yours and [MASK]'s?'
<name>Monks</name>	Monks	Rose	'You will,' said [MASK], after a pause, 'take some money from me, which may enable you to live without dishonesty--at all events until we meet again?' 'Not a penny,' replied the girl, waving her hand.
<name>Rose</name>	Rose	Rose	said the doctor: his face brightening, as if some new thought had occurred to him. 'Oh! to be sure!' exclaimed [MASK], eagerly. 'You shall have it immediately, if you will.' 'Why, thank you, miss!'
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Oliver	A hackney-cabriolet was in waiting; with the same vehemence which she had exhibited in addressing [MASK], the girl pulled him in with her, and drew the curtains close. The driver wanted no directions, but lashed his horse into full speed, without the delay of an instant.
<name>Rose</name>	Rose	Rose	From your own lips, let me hear it!' 'The prospect before you,' answered [MASK], firmly, 'is a brilliant one. All the honours to which great talents and powerful connections can help men in public life, are in store for you.
<name>Nell</name>	Nell	Nancy	It's a poor trade, [MASK], and no thanks; but I'm fond of seeing the young people about me; and I bear it all, I bear it all. Hush!' he said, hastily concealing the key in his breast; 'who's that?
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Oliver	But, for many days, [MASK] remained insensible to all the goodness of his new friends. The sun rose and sank, and rose and sank again, and many times after that; and still the boy lay stretched on his uneasy bed, dwindling away beneath the dry and wasting heat of fever.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Nancy	[MASK] remained, pale and almost breathless, listening with quivering lip to the very audible expressions of scorn, of which the chaste housemaids were very prolific; and of which they became still more so, when the man returned, and said the young woman was to walk upstairs.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Oliver	'I won't be ten minutes, sir,' said [MASK], eagerly. Having buttoned up the bank-note in his jacket pocket, and placed the books carefully under his arm, he made a respectful bow, and left the room.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Oliver	With the first ray of light that struggled through the crevices in the shutters, [MASK] arose, and again unbarred the door. One timid look around--one moment's pause of hesitation--he had closed it behind him, and was in the open street.
<name>Fagin</name>	Fagin	Fagin	'Am I!' said the girl. 'Take care I don't overdo it. You will be the worse for it, [MASK], if I do; and so I tell you in good time to keep clear of me.'
<name>Phileas</name>	Phileas	Rose	It is growing late, and I have to reach home without suspicion of having been on such an errand as this. I must get back quickly.' 'But what can I do?' said [MASK]. 'To what use can I turn this communication without you?
<name>Chitling</name>	Chitling	Chitling	But where can he have come from first, and how comes he here alone without the other!' 'He'--(none of them called the murderer by his old name)--'He can't have made away with himself. What do you think?' said [MASK].
<name>Nancy</name>	Nancy	Nancy	Accordingly, with a clean white apron tied over her gown, and her curl-papers tucked up under a straw bonnet,--both articles of dress being provided from the Jew's inexhaustible stock,--Miss [MASK] prepared to issue forth on her errand.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Oliver	For one brief moment, [MASK] cast a hurried glance along the empty street, and a cry for help hung upon his lips. But the girl's voice was in his ear, beseeching him in such tones of agony to remember her, that he had not the heart to utter it.
<name>Monks</name>	Monks	Monks	She stole from the corpse, when it had hardly turned to one, that which the dead mother had prayed her, with her last breath, to keep for the infant's sake.' 'She sold it,' cried [MASK], with desperate eagerness; 'did she sell it?
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Lord!--to	Lord, [MASK] think of it; it's as good as a play--as good as a play!' As the wretched creature mumbled and chuckled in her hideous merriment, the undertaker turned to go away. 'Stop, stop!'
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Oliver	But you teach me my duty, notwithstanding. I had forgotten it for a moment, [MASK], but I hope I may be pardoned, for I am old, and have seen enough of illness and death to know the agony of separation from the objects of our love.
<name>Kit</name>	Kit	Oliver	[MASK] roused himself, and made his best obeisance. He had been wondering, with his eyes fixed on the magistrates' powder, whether all boards were born with that white stuff on their heads, and were boards from thenceforth on that account. '
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Oliver	'Ha! you're a clever one, my dear: the sharpest girl I ever saw!' said the Jew, patting her on the neck. 'It WAS about [MASK] I was going to speak, sure enough. Ha! ha! ha!'
<name>Unwin</name>	Unwin	Unwin	The last was a S,--Swubble, I named him. This was a T,--Twist, I named _him_. The next one comes will be [MASK], and the next Vilkins. I have got names ready made to the end of the alphabet, and all the way through it
<name>Fagin</name>	Fagin	Fagin	angrily pursued the poor half-witted dupe. 'A word from me would have done it; wouldn't it, [MASK]?' 'To be sure it would, my dear,' replied the Jew. '
<name>Noah</name>	Noah	Noah	His breast heaved; his attitude was erect; his eye bright and vivid; his whole person changed, as he stood glaring over the cowardly tormentor who now lay crouching at his feet; and defied him with an energy he had never known before. 'He'll murder me!' blubbered [MASK].
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Sikes	'Hear you!' repeated [MASK] turning round in his chair to confront her. 'Aye! And if I hear you for half a minute longer, the dog shall have such a grip on your throat as'll tear some of that screaming voice out.
<name>Phileas</name>	Phileas	Noah	'Ah! something of that sort,' replied [MASK]. 'What do you think would suit me now? Something not too trying for the strength, and not very dangerous, you know. That's the sort of thing!'
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Oliver	After a short return of the stupor in which he had been so long plunged, [MASK]: urged by a creeping sickness at his heart, which seemed to warn him that if he lay there, he must surely die: got upon his feet, and essayed to walk.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Barney	'Where? Strike me blind, if I don't honour that 'ere girl, for her native talents.' 'She's bid havid a plate of boiled beef id the bar,' replied [MASK].
<name>Robinson</name>	Robinson	Jacob	In [MASK]'s Island, the warehouses are roofless and empty; the walls are crumbling down; the windows are windows no more; the doors are falling into the streets; the chimneys are blackened, but they yield no smoke.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Oliver	The assistants were paralysed with wonder; the boys with fear. 'What!' said the master at length, in a faint voice. 'Please, sir,' replied [MASK], 'I want some more.'
<name>Fagin</name>	Fagin	Fagin	'I'm doubtful about it,' replied [MASK], with a sigh. 'If they don't get any fresh evidence, it'll only be a summary conviction, and we shall have him back again after six weeks or so; but, if they do, it's a case of lagging.
<name>Nancy</name>	Nancy	Nance	'Why, [MASK]!' exclaimed the Jew, starting back as he put down the candle, 'how pale you are!' 'Pale!' echoed the girl, shading her eyes with her hands, as if to look steadily at him.
<name>He</name>	He	Fagin	'Not that infernal hole we were in before,' she could hear the man say as they went upstairs. [MASK] laughed; and making some reply which did not reach her, seemed, by the creaking of the boards, to lead his companion to the second story.
<name>Fagin</name>	Fagin	Fagin	That's right, that's right,' said [MASK]. 'That'll help us on. This door first. If I shake and tremble, as we pass the gallows, don't you mind, but hurry on. Now, now, now!'
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Bill	Say another word, and I'll do your business myself with a crack on the head. That makes no noise, and is quite as certain, and more genteel. Here, [MASK], wrench the shutter open. He's game enough now, I'll engage.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Nancy	Show him a light.' [MASK] followed the old man downstairs, with a candle. When they reached the passage, he laid his finger on his lip, and drawing close to the girl, said, in a whisper. '
<name>Fagin</name>	Fagin	Fagin	Don't put on an injured look at the question; you've done it many a time. Jerk the tinkler.' These words, in plain English, conveyed an injunction to ring the bell. It was answered by another Jew: younger than [MASK], but nearly as vile and repulsive in appearance.
<name>Sikes</name>	Sikes	Sikes	'Mean!' cried the Jew, stamping furiously on the ground. 'Where are they? [MASK] and the boy! Where are they? Where have they been? Where are they hiding? Why have they not been here?'
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Blathers	said [MASK]. 'Nothing at all,' replied the doctor. 'One of the frightened servants chose to take it into his head, that he had something to do with this attempt to break into the house; but it's nonsense: sheer absurdity.'
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Oliver	With the view of diverting the attention of the company, he turned to [MASK]. 'So you wanted to get away, my dear, did you?' said the Jew, taking up a jagged and knotted club which law in a corner of the fireplace; 'eh?'
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Oliver	You're a rough speaker, my friend, but you look an honest, open-hearted man,' said the old gentleman: turning his spectacles in the direction of the candidate for [MASK]'s premium, whose villainous countenance was a regular stamped receipt for cruelty.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Sikes	'Open the door of some place where I can lock this screeching Hell-babe,' cried [MASK] fiercely; running to and fro, and dragging the boy, now, as easily as if he were an empty sack. 'That door. Quick!'
<name>Monks</name>	Monks	Monks	There is a blank left for the surname; and then follows the date; which is within a year before the child was born. I found out that.' 'And this is all?' said [MASK], after a close and eager scrutiny of the contents of the little packet.
<name>Nancy</name>	Nancy	Nancy	Why not have let me speak to you, above there, where it is light, and there is something stirring, instead of bringing us to this dark and dismal hole?' 'I told you before,' replied [MASK], 'that I was afraid to speak to you there.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Oliver	How should you like to grow up a clever man, and write books, eh?' 'I think I would rather read them, sir,' replied [MASK]. 'What! wouldn't you like to be a book-writer?' said the old gentleman.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Fang	'I knew he was shamming,' said [MASK], as if this were incontestable proof of the fact. 'Let him lie there; he'll soon be tired of that.' 'How do you propose to deal with the case, sir?'
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Monks	'Will _he_ be here to-night?' asked the Jew, laying the same emphasis on the pronoun as before. '[MASK], do you mean?' inquired the landlord, hesitating. 'Hush!' said the Jew. 'Yes.'
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Oliver	He bent over [MASK], and repeated the inquiry; but finding him really incapable of understanding the question; and knowing that his not replying would only infuriate the magistrate the more, and add to the severity of his sentence; he hazarded a guess. '
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Noah	'Why, that she couldn't very easily get out of doors unless he knew where she was going to,' said [MASK]; 'and so the first time she went to see the lady, she--ha! ha! ha!
<name>Monks</name>	Monks	Monks	'That's the second,' observed the woman with much deliberation. 'The first is, what may the communication be worth?' 'Who the devil can tell that, without knowing of what kind it is?' asked [MASK].
<name>Riderhood</name>	Riderhood	Fagin	'Dear!' said [MASK]. 'A man need be always emptying a till, or a pocket, or a woman's reticule, or a house, or a mail-coach, or a bank, if he drinks it regularly.'
<name>Rose</name>	Rose	Rose	The youngest and fairest are too often its chosen victims.' 'But, can you--oh! can you really believe that this delicate boy has been the voluntary associate of the worst outcasts of society?' said [MASK].
<name>Rose</name>	Rose	Corney	'The one little, little, little word, my blessed [MASK]?' 'Ye--ye--yes!' sighed out the matron. 'One more,' pursued the beadle; 'compose your darling feelings for only one more.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Oliver	'Amen to that, my child!' said the old lady, wringing her hands. 'Surely there is no danger of anything so dreadful?' said [MASK]. 'Two hours ago, she was quite well.' '
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Oliver	[MASK] did as he was desired. Immediately afterwards he felt himself gently lifted on to one of the sacks; and then he sunk into a deep sleep. CHAPTER IX CONTAINING FURTHER PARTICULARS CONCERNING THE PLEASANT OLD GENTLEMAN, AND HIS HOPEFUL PUPILS
<name>Sikes</name>	Sikes	Fagin	One pound,' said [MASK], wishing to interest him in the scent as much as possible. 'And that's what I never gave yet, for any job of work where there wasn't valuable consideration to be gained.' 'Who is she?'
<name>Sikes</name>	Sikes	Sikes	'What fancy have you got in your head now?' 'Oh! you've thought better of it, have you?' growled [MASK], marking the tear which trembled in her eye. 'All the better for you, you have.'
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Oliver	'We'll cure you of that, my young master.' The Jew inflicted a smart blow on [MASK]'s shoulders with the club; and was raising it for a second, when the girl, rushing forward, wrested it from his hand.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Rose	I hardly thought he would; but it was better for us both.' And here [MASK] dropped the pen, and turned away, as though the very paper which was to be her messenger should not see her weep.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Oliver	And with this, the old lady applied herself to warming up, in a little saucepan, a basin full of broth: strong enough, [MASK] thought, to furnish an ample dinner, when reduced to the regulation strength, for three hundred and fifty paupers, at the lowest computation.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Nancy	cried [MASK], springing before the door, and closing it, as the Jew and his two pupils darted out in pursuit. 'Keep back the dog; he'll tear the boy to pieces.' 'Serve him right!'
<name>Fagin</name>	Fagin	Fagin	'It's as dark as the grave,' said the man, groping forward a few steps. 'Make haste!' 'Shut the door,' whispered [MASK] from the end of the passage. As he spoke, it closed with a loud noise.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Oliver	[MASK] walked a few paces after them; and, not knowing whether to advance or retire, stood looking on in silent amazement. The old gentleman was a very respectable-looking personage, with a powdered head and gold spectacles.
<name>Fagin</name>	Fagin	Oliver	For a long time, [MASK] remained motionless in this attitude. The candle was burning low in the socket when he rose to his feet. Having gazed cautiously round him, and listened intently, he gently undid the fastenings of the door, and looked abroad.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Bill	A dog growled as he touched the handle of a room-door; and a man's voice demanded who was there. 'Only me, [MASK]; only me, my dear,' said the Jew looking in.
<name>Monks</name>	Monks	Monks	'I have been prompt enough this time. Let me have a word with you.' The girl drew closer to the table, and made no offer to leave the room, although she could see that [MASK] was pointing to her.
<name>Sikes</name>	Sikes	Sikes	she--ha! ha! ha! it made me laugh when she said it, that it did--she gave him a drink of laudanum.' 'Hell's fire!' cried [MASK], breaking fiercely from the Jew. 'Let me go!'
<name>Sikes</name>	Sikes	Sikes	'Come; you should know her better than me. Wot does it mean?' 'Obstinacy; woman's obstinacy, I suppose, my dear.' 'Well, I suppose it is,' growled [MASK]. 'I thought I had tamed her,
<name>Monks</name>	Monks	Monks	'Whose turn would that have served, my dear?' inquired the Jew humbly. 'Mine,' replied [MASK]. 'But not mine,' said the Jew, submissively. 'He might have become of use to me.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Oliver	[MASK] knew this too well; but thinking it might be dangerous to express his feelings more openly, he only sighed, and went on with his boot-cleaning. 'Go!' exclaimed the Dodger. 'Why, where's your spirit?'
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Rose	'No other, take my word for it.' 'Then my aunt invests you with full power,' said [MASK], smiling through her tears; 'but pray don't be harder upon the poor fellows than is indispensably necessary.'
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Oliver	[MASK] sat huddled together, in a corner of the cart; bewildered with alarm and apprehension; and figuring strange objects in the gaunt trees, whose branches waved grimly to and fro, as if in some fantastic joy at the desolation of the scene.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	OLIVER	If fervent prayers, gushing from hearts overcharged with gratitude, be heard in heaven--and if they be not, what prayers are!--the blessings which the orphan child called down upon them, sunk into their souls, diffusing peace and happiness. CHAPTER XXXII OF THE HAPPY LIFE [MASK] BEGAN TO LEAD WITH HIS KIND FRIENDS
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Oliver	This was rather too violent exercise to last long. When they were all wearied out, and could tear and beat no longer, they dragged [MASK], struggling and shouting, but nothing daunted, into the dust-cellar, and there locked him up.
<name>Planchet</name>	Planchet	Oliver	too, joined in the pursuit like good citizens. Although [MASK] had been brought up by philosophers, he was not theoretically acquainted with the beautiful axiom that self-preservation is the first law of nature. If he had been, perhaps he would have been prepared for this.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Nolly	'I don't know what comes over me sometimes,' said she, affecting to busy herself in arranging her dress; 'it's this damp dirty room, I think. Now, [MASK], dear, are you ready?'
<name>Nancy</name>	Nancy	Monks	The Jew: perhaps fearing she might say something aloud about the money, if he endeavoured to get rid of her: pointed upward, and took [MASK] out of the room. 'Not that infernal hole we were in before,' she could hear the man say as they went upstairs.
<name>Monks</name>	Monks	Monks	'There she died,' said [MASK], 'after a lingering illness; and, on her death-bed, she bequeathed these secrets to me, together with her unquenchable and deadly hatred of all whom they involved--though she need not have left me that, for I had inherited it long before.
<name>Charley</name>	Charley	Charley	'Hold your noise,' remonstrated the Dodger, looking cautiously round. 'Do you want to be grabbed, stupid?' 'I can't help it,' said [MASK], 'I can't help it!
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Sikes	'Could you give my boy and me a lift as far as there?' demanded [MASK], pushing the ale towards his new friend. 'If you're going directly, I can,' replied the man, looking out of the pot.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Brittles	Much comforted by this assurance, [MASK] opened the door to its full width, and confronted a portly man in a great-coat; who walked in, without saying anything more, and wiped his shoes on the mat, as coolly as if he lived there.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Oliver	The old servant looked up at the speaker, as she turned away, with a glance as proud and admiring as if she had been his own child. Then, bending over [MASK], he helped to carry him upstairs, with the care and solicitude of a woman.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Oliver	In fact,' he said, 'it would be little short of a miracle, if she recovered.' How often did [MASK] start from his bed that night, and stealing out, with noiseless footstep, to the staircase, listen for the slightest sound from the sick chamber!
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Noah	The angry flush had not disappeared, however; and when he was pulled out of his prison, he scowled boldly on [MASK], and looked quite undismayed. 'Now, you are a nice young fellow, ain't you?'
<name>Barney</name>	Barney	Barney	He won't stir till it's all safe. Depend on it, they're on the scent down there; and that if he moved, he'd blow upon the thing at once. He's all right enough, [MASK] is, else I should have heard of him.
<name>Giles</name>	Giles	Giles	I was soon too many for him.' 'Hush!' replied the young lady; 'you frighten my aunt as much as the thieves did. Is the poor creature much hurt?' 'Wounded desperate, miss,' replied [MASK], with indescribable complacency.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Kags	He can't be coming here. I--I--hope not.' 'If he was coming here, he'd have come with the dog,' said [MASK], stooping down to examine the animal, who lay panting on the floor. 'Here!
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Brass	'[MASK] can do better than the gold what has stood the fire,' said the second. The third contented herself with wondering 'what ladies was made of'; and the fourth took the first in a quartette of 'Shameful!'
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Oliver	Grind him to ashes! He'd start up from a stone coffin, to come in my way!' 'I am sorry,' stammered [MASK], confused by the strange man's wild look. 'I hope I have not hurt you!'
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Oliver	For many days, [MASK] remained in the Jew's room, picking the marks out of the pocket-handkerchief, (of which a great number were brought home,) and sometimes taking part in the game already described: which the two boys and the Jew played, regularly, every morning.
