<name>the protagonist</name>	the protagonist	Syme	As they were looking round wildly for any trace of their wild quarry, a keeper in uniform came running along the path with a man in plain clothes. “Has it come this way?” gasped the keeper. “Has what?” asked [MASK].
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Syme	[MASK] sat watching him with some respect in his large, blue eyes. “You took me in,” he said. “It is really a smart dodge.” Then after a pause he added-- “What do you call this tremendous President of yours?”
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Syme	[MASK] stood up before any of the others. The instant of choice had come at last, the pistol was at his head. On the pavement before he could hear the policeman idly stir and stamp, for the morning, though bright, was cold.
<name>Mr. Ferguson</name>	Mr. Ferguson	Gregory	“Excuse me if I enjoy myself rather obviously!” he said to [MASK], smiling. “I don’t often have the luck to have a dream like this. It is new to me for a nightmare to lead to a lobster.
<name>God's</name>	God's	Sunday	Yet when I walked a little farther I found that there was no face, that the window was ten yards away, the lamp ten hundred yards, the cloud beyond the world. Well, [MASK]’s face escaped me; it ran away to right and left, as such chance pictures run away.
<name>Carton</name>	Carton	Syme	No one except [MASK] seemed to have any notion of the blow that was about to fall. As for him, he had merely the feeling of a man mounting the scaffold with the intention, at any rate, of making a good speech.
<name>The Lone Ranger</name>	The Lone Ranger	Syme	They all moved feverishly in their seats, except [MASK]. He sat stiff in his, with his hand in his pocket, and on the handle of his loaded revolver. When the attack on him came he would sell his life dear.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Syme	[MASK] did not flinch, but he put up a pale and polite hand. “Don’t be such a silly man,” he said, with the effeminate dignity of a curate. “Don’t you see it’s not necessary?
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Syme	[MASK] drained his last glass of sparkling wine. “I am,” he said, pointing across to the Marquis and his companions, “that meeting. That meeting displeases me. I am going to pull that meeting’s great ugly, mahogany-coloured nose.”
<name>Straker</name>	Straker	Syme	“I was speaking with strict accuracy when I said that the ‘Soleil d’Or’ was the only place where one can get horses within twenty miles.” “No!” said [MASK] violently, “I don’t believe he’d do it.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Syme	The Professor then resumed his merely verbal monologue addressed to the Doctor. “Perhaps I should rather say,” said [MASK] on his fingers, “that it resembles that sudden smell of the sea which may be found in the heart of lush woods.”
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Bull	“I have piles of money on me.” “That will never do,” said the Colonel; “he will never have any respect for you unless you drive a bargain.” “Oh, if he haggles!” began [MASK] impatiently.
<name>West</name>	West	Renard	cried the Colonel, stamping. “[MASK] shall explain it. He shall explain it to me,” and he strode forward. “Don’t be in such a hurry,” drawled the smoker. “He will very soon explain it to all of us.”
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Bull	There is a crowd or an army or some such thing across the end of that street.” “Well, if there is,” said [MASK] impatiently, “it must be something else--a sham fight or the mayor’s birthday or something.
<name>Nietzsche</name>	Nietzsche	Nietzsche	Then I tried being a major. Now I am a humanitarian myself, but I have, I hope, enough intellectual breadth to understand the position of those who, like [MASK], admire violence--the proud, mad war of Nature and all that, you know.
<name>Ichabod</name>	Ichabod	Syme	They had come to an open space of sunlight, which seemed to express to [MASK] the final return of his own good sense; and in the middle of this forest clearing was a figure that might well stand for that common sense in an almost awful actuality.
<name>Archer</name>	Archer	Syme	Now in the pause his lips of clay parted, and he said, with an automatic and lifeless distinctness-- “You damnable hypocrite!” [MASK] looked straight into those frightful eyes with his own pale blue ones, and said with dignity--
<name>The Little Prince</name>	The Little Prince	Bull	[MASK] said-- “I understand nothing, but I am happy. In fact, I am going to sleep.” “I am not happy,” said the Professor with his head in his hands, “because I do not understand.
<name>Napoleon</name>	Napoleon	Sunday	It never occurred to him to be spiritually won over to the enemy. Many moderns, inured to a weak worship of intellect and force, might have wavered in their allegiance under this oppression of a great personality. They might have called [MASK] the super-man.
<name>Beowulf</name>	Beowulf	Sunday	Still [MASK] said nothing, but only sat with his mighty chin upon his hand, and gazed at the distance. Then at last he said-- “I have heard your complaints in order. And here, I think, comes another to complain, and we will hear him also.”
<name>Mark Twain</name>	Mark Twain	Syme	“Well,” said [MASK], “I can understand your putting on his dirty old beard for a night’s practical joke, but I don’t understand your never taking it off again.” “That is the rest of the story,” said the impersonator.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Syme	“With pleasure,” resumed [MASK]. “In all your present acts and surroundings there is a scientific attempt at secrecy. I have an aunt who lived over a shop, but this is the first time I have found people living from preference under a public-house.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Syme	“So unless you or I can get on his track--” The Doctor was still smiling in the most friendly way, and his protected eyes were still impenetrable. The Professor signalled to [MASK] that he would resume his explanation, and he began again with the same elaborate calm.
<name>Long John Silver</name>	Long John Silver	Syme	[MASK] snatched a sword, and took it in his teeth; he stuck two others under his arm-pits, took a fourth in his left hand and the lantern in his right, and leapt off the high parade on to the beach below.
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Syme	I would destroy the world if I could.” A sense of a pathos far under the earth stirred up in [MASK], and he spoke brokenly and without sequence. “Oh, most unhappy man,” he cried, “try to be happy!
<name>Conklin</name>	Conklin	Syme	“How?” asked the staring Professor. “Why?” “Because I am afraid of him,” said [MASK]; “and no man should leave in the universe anything of which he is afraid.”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Sunday	He had hardly the shred of a doubt that in some silent and extraordinary way [MASK] had found out that he was a spy. He looked over the edge of the balcony, and saw a policeman, standing abstractedly just beneath, staring at the bright railings and the sunlit trees.
<name>Uriah</name>	Uriah	Gregory	The room was so small and dark, that very little could be seen of the attendant who was summoned, beyond a vague and dark impression of something bulky and bearded. “Will you take a little supper?” asked [MASK] politely.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Anarchy	“[MASK],” he said, shrugging his shoulders, “it is childishness!” “Et ca,” cried out the Colonel suddenly, pointing over the other’s shoulder, “and that is childishness, isn’t it?”
<name>the group</name>	the group	Wednesday	There was a singular silence, and then the Secretary said-- “We are wandering, however, from the point. The only question is how [MASK] is to strike the blow. I take it we should all agree with the original notion of a bomb.
<name>Wyatt</name>	Wyatt	Syme	Inside the doorway the passage gleamed as if it were lined with a network of steel. On a second glance, [MASK] saw that the glittering pattern was really made up of ranks and ranks of rifles and revolvers, closely packed or interlocked.
<name>the protagonist</name>	the protagonist	Syme	We are keeping it rather dark from the educated class, because that class contains most of our enemies. But you seem to be exactly in the right frame of mind. I think you might almost join us.” “Join you in what?” asked [MASK].
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Syme	On the contrary, it frightened me because it was so beautiful, because it was so good.” “[MASK],” exclaimed the Secretary, “are you ill?” “It was like the face of some ancient archangel, judging justly after heroic wars.
<name>Monday</name>	Monday	Syme	Only the individual examples will express this half-concealed eccentricity. [MASK]’s original cicerone bore the title of Monday; he was the Secretary of the Council, and his twisted smile was regarded with more terror than anything, except the President’s horrible, happy laughter.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Ducroix	“And your other reason for coming here?” “My other reason for coming here,” said [MASK] soberly, “is that it is just as well to see a good man or two when one is possibly near to death.”
<name>Mr. Wrenn</name>	Mr. Wrenn	Syme	“What do you mean?” “The fact is,” said [MASK] serenely, “the truth is I am a Sabbatarian. I have been specially sent here to see that you show a due observance of Sunday.”
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Syme	[MASK] almost tore the glasses out of his hand, and looked through them. Most men in the advancing mob really looked ordinary enough; but it was quite true that two or three of the leaders in front wore black half-masks almost down to their mouths.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Syme	“No, but it isn’t that,” said [MASK], knitting his brows. “I hear the most horrible noises, like devils laughing and sneezing and blowing their devilish noses!” “His dogs barking, of course,” said the Secretary.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Syme	Half mad, he thrust again, and made what should have been a bloody scar on the Marquis’s cheek. But there was no scar. For one moment the heaven of [MASK] again grew black with supernatural terrors. Surely the man had a charmed life.
<name>Lestrade</name>	Lestrade	Ducroix	“Yes,” answered [MASK], “you may be quite certain that I gave orders the moment I came in. Those enemies of yours gave no impression of hurry, but they were really moving wonderfully fast, like a well-trained army.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Syme	This scrap of hair almost seemed a mere oversight; the rest of the face was of the type that is best shaven--clear-cut, ascetic, and in its way noble. [MASK] drew closer and closer, noting all this, and still the figure did not stir.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Syme	They were led out of another broad and low gateway into a very large old English garden, full of torches and bonfires, by the broken light of which a vast carnival of people were dancing in motley dress. [MASK] seemed to see every shape in Nature imitated in some crazy costume.
<name>Rainsford</name>	Rainsford	Syme	“And you think,” said [MASK], “that this unique monster will be soothed if I play the piano to him?” “Don’t be an ass,” said his mentor. “I mentioned the piano because it gives one quick and independent fingers.
<name>Monte Cristo</name>	Monte Cristo	Syme	If you will take upon yourself this awful abnegation if you will consent to burden your soul with a vow that you should never make and a knowledge you should never dream about, I will promise you in return--” “You will promise me in return?” inquired [MASK], as the other paused.
<name>Long John Silver</name>	Long John Silver	Syme	I feel as if my own hand might fly up and strike me.” “When my hand flies up,” said [MASK], “it will strike somebody else,” and he strode along the pier towards the Colonel, the sword in one hand and the lantern in the other.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Syme	Then he strolled back again, kicking his heels carelessly, and a companionable silence fell between the three men. “Well,” said [MASK], “it seems that we have all the same kind of morality or immorality, so we had better face the fact that comes of it.”
<name>someone</name> (There is no clear indication of a specific name in this passage)	someone (There is no clear indication of a specific name in this passage)	Syme	It may have been merely a crescendo of nervous fancy that had gone before, but those black discs were dreadful to [MASK]; they reminded him of half-remembered ugly tales, of some story about pennies being put on the eyes of the dead.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Syme	The Colonel said quietly, “Engage!” and the two blades touched and tingled. When the jar of the joined iron ran up [MASK]’s arm, all the fantastic fears that have been the subject of this story fell from him like dreams from a man waking up in bed.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Syme	Clapping a brisk bowler on his head and resuming his goblin glasses, the Doctor moved so quickly towards the door, that the others instinctively followed him. [MASK] seemed a little distrait, and as he passed under the doorway he suddenly struck his stick on the stone passage so that it rang.
<name>Syme</name>	Syme	Syme	“What can you mean by all this?” cried [MASK]. “They can’t be running the real world in that way. Surely not many working men are anarchists, and surely if they were, mere mobs could not beat modern armies and police.”
<name>Gwendolen</name>	Gwendolen	Syme	“What branch do you represent?” he asked sharply. “I should hardly call it a branch,” said [MASK], laughing; “I should call it at the very least a root.” “What do you mean?”
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Syme	“No,” said [MASK], “I do not feel fierce like that. I am grateful to you, not only for wine and hospitality here, but for many a fine scamper and free fight. But I should like to know.
<name>Karellen</name>	Karellen	Syme	“Yes,” he said slowly, “there is a spy in this room. There is a traitor at this table. I will waste no more words. His name--” [MASK] half rose from his seat, his finger firm on the trigger.
<name>him</name>	him	Syme	The inside of the wood was full of shattered sunlight and shaken shadows. They made a sort of shuddering veil, almost recalling the dizziness of a cinematograph. Even the solid figures walking with him [MASK] could hardly see for the patterns of sun and shade that danced upon them.
<name>Simeon</name>	Simeon	Syme	cried [MASK] in a terrible voice. “Do you see the cross carved on it, and the flame inside? You did not make it. You did not light it. Better men than you, men who could believe and obey, twisted the entrails of iron and preserved the legend of fire.
<name>Philosophers</name>	Philosophers	Bigamists	They merely wish the property to become their property that they may more perfectly respect it. But philosophers dislike property as property; they wish to destroy the very idea of personal possession. [MASK] respect marriage, or they would not go through the highly ceremonial and even ritualistic formality of bigamy.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Syme	His fine face was so emaciated, that [MASK] thought it must be wasted with some disease; yet somehow the very distress of his dark eyes denied this. It was no physical ill that troubled him. His eyes were alive with intellectual torture, as if pure thought was pain.
<name>He</name>	He	Gregory	Superbly careless of the slanders that represent us as assassins and enemies of human society, we shall pursue with moral courage and quiet intellectual pressure, the permanent ideals of brotherhood and simplicity.” [MASK] resumed his seat and passed his hand across his forehead.
<name>Professor</name>	Professor	Syme	But wine and companionship had always the effect of inspiring him to a farcical ingenuity, and the Professor soon found himself struggling with the too vast energy of the new language, as it passed through the heated brain of [MASK].
<name>Lady Chiltern</name>	Lady Chiltern	Syme	Well, you said that you were quite certain I was not a serious anarchist. Does this place strike you as being serious?” “It does seem to have a moral under all its gaiety,” assented [MASK]; “but may I ask you two questions?
<name>David</name>	David	Syme	[MASK] was galvanised with an energy that was something between bitterness and a burst of boyish derision. He made a wild gesture as if to knock the old man’s hat off, called out something like “Catch me if you can,” and went racing away across the white, open Circus.
<name>Isaiah</name>	Isaiah	Syme	[MASK] was subject to spasms of singular common sense, not otherwise a part of his character. They were (as he said of his impulse about the spectacles) poetic intuitions, and they sometimes rose to the exaltation of prophecy. He had correctly calculated in this case the policy of his opponent.
<name>Polaris</name>	Polaris	Sunday	So I say to you, strike upwards, if you strike at the stars.” The other looked at the ceiling, one of the tricks of his pose. “[MASK] is a fixed star,” he said.
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Syme	From each the innumerable roofs of slate looked like the leaden surges of a grey, troubled sea after rain. [MASK] was increasingly conscious that his new adventure had somehow a quality of cold sanity worse than the wild adventures of the past.
<name>Colonel</name>	Colonel	Bull	“He will never get anything out of that old heathen. I vote we drive bang through the thick of them, bang as the bullets went through [MASK]’s hat. We may all be killed, but we must kill a tidy number of them.”
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Syme	You should hear me say, ‘Buck up, old cock!’ It would bring tears to your eyes.” “It does,” said [MASK]; “but I cannot help thinking that apart from all that you are really a bit worried.”
<name>him</name>	him	Syme	After all, it was only one night’s discussion, and only one detective who would know of it. He would let out as little as possible of their plans that night, and then let [MASK] go, and chance it.
<name>Azathoth</name>	Azathoth	Sunday	It may be my literary fancy, but somehow I feel that it ought to mean something.” “It means everything,” said the other, “and the end of everything. [MASK] has us now in the hollow of his hand.” “Us!”
<name>David</name>	David	Syme	“Insulted you?” cried the gentleman with the red rosette, “when?” “Oh, just now,” said [MASK] recklessly. “He insulted my mother.” “Insulted your mother!” exclaimed the gentleman incredulously.
<name>Don Gately</name>	Don Gately	Sunday	“Have you noticed an odd thing,” he said, “about all your descriptions? Each man of you finds [MASK] quite different, yet each man of you can only find one thing to compare him to--the universe itself.
<name>Syme</name>	Syme	Syme	He looked down for a moment modestly. “It is almost a settled thing that I am to be Thursday.” “My dear fellow.” said [MASK] heartily, “I congratulate you. A great career!”
<name>Nietzsche</name>	Nietzsche	Syme	But philosophers hate life itself, their own as much as other people’s.” [MASK] struck his hands together. “How true that is,” he cried. “I have felt it from my boyhood, but never could state the verbal antithesis.
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Gregory	“I am not a madman,” reiterated [MASK], with a frightful sincerity which for a moment staggered the room, “but I give you a counsel which you can call mad if you like. No, I will not call it a counsel, for I can give you no reason for it.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Syme	The sky, indeed, was so swarthy, and the light on the river relatively so lurid, that the water almost seemed of fiercer flame than the sunset it mirrored. It looked like a stream of literal fire winding under the vast caverns of a subterranean country. [MASK] was shabby in those days.
<name>Moriarty</name>	Moriarty	Gogol	But he felt that he would have laughed as loudly if a pepperpot had fallen over. The false Professor drank and wiped his false beard. “Did you know,” he asked, “that that man [MASK] was one of us?” “I?
<name>Wordsworth</name>	Wordsworth	Bradshaw	No, take your books of mere poetry and prose; let me read a time table, with tears of pride. Take your Byron, who commemorates the defeats of man; give me [MASK], who commemorates his victories.
<name>Gregor</name>	Gregor	Bull	And so his face has made me, somehow, doubt whether there are any faces. I don’t know whether your face, [MASK], is a face or a combination in perspective. Perhaps one black disc of your beastly glasses is quite close and another fifty miles away.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Syme	“Talk sense,” said [MASK] shortly. “Into what sort of devils’ parliament have you entrapped me, if it comes to that? You made me swear before I made you. Perhaps we are both doing what we think right.
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Syme	there was never a man who had to seek long. These gentlemen will perhaps act for me. There are still four hours of daylight. Let us fight this evening.” [MASK] bowed with a quite beautiful graciousness.
<name>Oscar</name>	Oscar	Syme	“Do you understand,” said the other, “that this is a tragedy?” “Perfectly,” replied [MASK]; “always be comic in a tragedy. What the deuce else can you do? I wish this language of yours had a wider scope.
<name>Beowulf</name>	Beowulf	Syme	Anyhow, this was certain, that three times had a human sword been driven into him and made no mark. When [MASK] had that thought he drew himself up, and all that was good in him sang high up in the air as a high wind sings in the trees.
<name>Mr. Wopsle</name>	Mr. Wopsle	Syme	“What is there queer about a captive balloon?” “Nothing,” said [MASK], “except that it isn’t captive!” They all turned their eyes to where the balloon swung and swelled above the Exhibition on a string, like a child’s balloon.
<name>him</name>	him	Sunday	because he’s such a Bounder.” There was a long silence, and then the Secretary said in a curious, strained voice-- “You do not know [MASK] at all. Perhaps it is because you are better than I, and do not know hell.
<name>John</name>	John	Gregory	“Which is founded upon love,” repeated [MASK], grinding his teeth, “there will be no difficulty about the aims which we shall pursue as a body, or which I should pursue were I chosen as the representative of that body.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Syme	do you remember his face?” “I grant you,” answered [MASK], “that I have never been able to forget it.” “Well,” said the Secretary, “I suppose we can find out soon, for tomorrow we have our next general meeting.
<name>Syme</name>	Syme	Syme	He thought that with care he could succeed, in spite of all the people around him, in conveying an impression of the institution, subtly and delicately false. [MASK] had once thought that anarchists, under all their bravado, were only playing the fool.
<name>the Sabbath</name>	the Sabbath	Sunday	There was complete silence in the starlit garden, and then the black-browed Secretary, implacable, turned in his chair towards [MASK], and said in a harsh voice-- “Who and what are you?” “I am the Sabbath,” said the other without moving.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Syme	exclaimed [MASK]. “Does he live round the corner?” “No,” answered his friend. “As a matter of fact he lives some way off, on the other side of the river, but we can tell from here whether he has gone to bed.”
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Sunday	Bad is so bad, that we cannot but think good an accident; good is so good, that we feel certain that evil could be explained. But the whole came to a kind of crest yesterday when I raced [MASK] for the cab, and was just behind him all the way.”
<name>April</name>	April	Nature	There is a kind of gaiety in the thing, as if he were bursting with some good news. Haven’t you sometimes felt it on a spring day? You know [MASK] plays tricks, but somehow that day proves they are good-natured tricks.
<name>Selden</name>	Selden	Syme	And in some strange way, though there was not the shadow of a shape in the gloom, [MASK] knew two things: first, that it came from a man of massive stature; and second, that the man had his back to him.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Syme	Again and again [MASK] strove to pull together his common sense in their presence. Sometimes he saw for an instant that these notions were subjective, that he was only looking at ordinary men, one of whom was old, another nervous, another short-sighted.
<name>the Time Traveler</name>	the Time Traveler	Bull	“Nonsense!” said [MASK] desperately; “there must be some people left in the town who are human.” “No,” said the hopeless Inspector, “the human being will soon be extinct. We are the last of mankind.”
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Syme	You are not in the British police?” He leant his angular elbow far across the table, and put up his large loose hand like a flap to his ear. “I am not in the British police,” said [MASK] with insane calm.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Syme	Why must I be a policeman? Do, do let me be a postman.” The old Professor shook his head with a gravity that gave no hope, but [MASK] ran on with a feverish irony. “But perhaps I misunderstood the delicacies of your German philosophy.
<name>Oscar</name>	Oscar	Gregory	“I have never doubted that you were perfectly sincere in this sense, that you thought what you said well worth saying, that you thought a paradox might wake men up to a neglected truth.” [MASK] stared at him steadily and painfully.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Syme	And he clasped his hands. [MASK], who had sat down once more with his usual insolent languor, got to his feet with an unusual air of hesitation. “Why is it,” he asked vaguely, “that I think you are quite a decent fellow?
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Syme	There comes a certain point in such conditions when only three things are possible: first a perpetuation of Satanic pride, secondly tears, and third laughter. [MASK]’s egotism held hard to the first course for a few seconds, and then suddenly adopted the third.
<name>Mr. Pooter</name>	Mr. Pooter	Syme	His further attempts at conversation, somewhat disorganised in themselves, were cut short finally as by a thunderbolt by the actual appearance of the lobster. [MASK] tasted it, and found it particularly good. Then he suddenly began to eat with great rapidity and appetite.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Gregory	Then he could collect his thoughts, formulate his policy, and decide finally whether he should or should not keep faith with [MASK]. He strolled away through the dancing snow, turned up two or three streets, down through two or three others, and entered a small Soho restaurant for lunch.
