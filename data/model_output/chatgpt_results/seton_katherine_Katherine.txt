<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Katherine	But if might goes before right then is the mill misadight. “’Tis gibberish,” said the sergeant contemptuously. “No sense to ut.” As he spoke the intent crowd became aware of [MASK]. There was a murmuring as heads were turned.
<name>Doctor</name>	Doctor	Gibbon	“Ay,” she said, “I’ll go to bed. That would be best.” She could not think for herself, and [MASK]’s words brought her relief. “The pains’re not sc bad,” she added, trying to smile.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Milburga	[MASK], bound on her errand to the rectory, paused in the kii chen below to regale the other servants with their mistress’s shocking behavior. They clustered around exclaiming, the cook, and the servitor and the dairy maid.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Robin	[MASK] brought food and drink to the door, and she took a little. Sometimes she rested, far on the outer edge of the bed so as not to disturb him. And she thought long and hard about this secret thing that had so deeply troubled him.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Plush	In the moments during which she did not answer, the voices of the children in the nave rose louder until one cried “[MASK]!” in a frightened voice; there was a scamper of feet and the west door banged, leaving silence.
<name>the Duke</name>	the Duke	Katherine	So this was the natural time for a bridal trip. These practical arguments deceived nobody. Everyone from the page boys to [MASK] herself could see the jealousy that possessed him, and the fever to get the girl alone away from everyone.
<name>Theon</name>	Theon	Cob	He had been dragged behind the horse for several miles, sometimes on his feet, more often on the ground. His jerkin and leather trunks had been torn off him, his dirty little body, bruised and bleeding, was quite naked. “[MASK]!”
<name>She</name>	She	Katherine	To be sure, why should they? thought [MASK]. She saw from the twinkle in the sergeant’s eye that he thought she was being silly and womanish and that whatever misgivings he had had earlier were now gone. “Very well,” she said with a smile.
<name>Jon Snow</name>	Jon Snow	Nenni	“[MASK] — I think not yet. Something seems to hold him back. A moody man and broods much, unless he’s fighting.” “He needs a woman,” said the captal shrugging his massive shoulders.
<name>Robin</name>	Robin	Jack	His sharp questing eyes had seen the friar and recognized him. [MASK] charged down the courtyard, flourishing his pike. “Ho!” he shouted, his yellow teeth bared in a wolf grin, his freckled face twisted like a devil mask.
<name>Lancelot</name>	Lancelot	John	She wove them into garlands while [MASK] lay on the velvet greensward beside her, pelting her lazily with the flowers, or content to watch her. Sometimes they sang together, and he often recited to her poems and ballads he had learned in his youth.
<name>Althea</name>	Althea	Katherine	“His Grace is in good spirits, 1 hear. ’Twas not his mood last night in the Hall, by corpus!” She enveloped [MASK] in a chamber robe, encased the slim feet in embroidered kid slippers. “How do you know that?”
<name>Long John Silver</name>	Long John Silver	Nirac	l ire Duke said you were better, are you?” She glanced at the bandaged leg, which was propped on a straw pillow. “For sure ’e’s better!” cried [MASK] heartily, coming forward to the bed and bowing.
<name>Lancelot</name>	Lancelot	Katherine	Dull red crept up from his mailed gorge!. “[MASK] — I had to see you — I — I bring you this.” He opened his clenched hand, holding it out stiffly, his eyes or the rush-strewn floor.
<name>Ben</name>	Ben	Hugh	“’Twould be fitting.” [MASK] had come back into the Hall and crouched in his high-backed chair, his knees drawn up to ease the cramps. His dull eyes lifted now to his brother-in-law’s face, and he frowned.
<name>Robin</name>	Robin	Percy	The moment after the Duke had ridden through the gates into English territory, he lifted the visor on his brass battle helm and looked down at [MASK]’s tool, the cringing, bowing warden. “Where is your master?”
<name>Edric</name>	Edric	Katherine	She glanced rather anxiously at the Mortimer Gate Tower, “No sign yet of my lord father?” “No,” said [MASK], making room for the girl on the bench. “Didn’t you think to wear the new crimson gown he had sent you?”
<name>Sara</name>	Sara	Katherine	The loft above the fish shop was dank and gray when [MASK] opened her eyes. She lay quietly for a time on the feather bed looking up at the rafters and wondering exactly where she was, aware at first only of hunger and weakness and that there was a sore place on the back of her head.
<name>Lucie</name>	Lucie	Katherine	His joy could not help but lighten [MASK]’s heavy heart for a time, but when they had parted and she took up her pilgrimage again, night fell on her spirit as inexorably as it fell on the darkening ridges of the Essex hills.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Wat	Her eyes moved unseeing over the faces of the other men, who had turned to watch. “But I can tell you who I’ll be — ” She nodded three times slowly, and she laughed low in her throat. [MASK] swallowed.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Katherine	It’s all arranged for Saturday morning — [MASK] — ” He put hi:, hand out towards her again, but on seeing her stony profile, he let it drop He knew not how to woo her, he knew only that with her he became even more harsh and clumsy than usual.
<name>Tyrion</name>	Tyrion	Pieter	“Did you think that the King’s son would kill you as you hung there trussed like a fowl on a spit, my poor [MASK]? Nay, ’tis not so you shall die — though how you shall die I’ve not yet decided.”
<name>Renly</name>	Renly	Katherine	Here was a small wooden door which he unlocked. “But the privy apartments are in the Inner Ward,” protested [MASK] nervously as he motioned her up narrow stone steps that were hollowed from the thickness of the wall.
<name>Constance</name>	Constance	Katherine	He picked up his sharpest knife and on the worn chopping block began to slice the old sheep’s entrails for a mortrewe. The initial good will [MASK] had aroused on the manor by reason of her beauty, youth and the promptness with which she had done her duty in conceiving an heir had soon died down.
<name>Thom</name>	Thom	Katherine	He waited on her with his usual smooth efficiency, and [MASK] felt that she had been unduly nervous. She did however summon the sergeant once more. “Can you find out about these gleemen?” she said to him. “I have, m’lady,” answered the sergeant complacently.
<name>Louisa</name>	Louisa	Blanchette	So you may free the bird yourself, as you love to do.” “Perhaps it’s happy in its cage, after all,” said [MASK] slowly. She looked out of the window towards the line of trees across the river where the rooks were circling.
<name>Robin</name>	Robin	Richard	Had he not given them their freedom? Had he not shown himself their friend? [MASK] wheeled his horse and started off up along the Fleet towards the open farmlands, past the smoking ruins of the treasurer’s priory that they had fired.
<name>Malfoy</name>	Malfoy	Elizabeth	A high jeering singsong shattered the peace of the courtyard. “Scaredy cats! Scaredy cats! Cowardy cowardy custard, go get thyself some mustard — Ye durstrit do what I do — ” That was [MASK], of course.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Hugh	She started to pour for him, then stopped. “Your potion, [MASK],” she smiled and shook her head, “first you must have your draught.” She gave him the clay cup. He took it grumbling but swallowed nearly all the contents.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Katherine	The Duchess was small and young. She was not ugly as they had said. [MASK], like one who cannot cease from pressing on an aching tooth, strained her eyes down the Hall. Young. Four years younger than I!
<name>the Duke's</name>	the Duke's	Nirac	“Ay, the widow, you said, Brother. I shall attend to that myself,” and now as the Duke turned, the astounded Gray Friar saw what [MASK] had seen — the face of joy — the young, eager, tremulous face of joy.
<name>his mistress</name>	his mistress	Alice	I knew there’d be no trouble. The people love me and do my bidding.” He rose and glanced towards the arras. He wanted his dinner, which would be served him in a privy chamber with [MASK], and he wandered towards the stair.
<name>my own son</name>	my own son	Katherine	The Duke’s voice shook with fury, he crushed the parchment between his hands and flung the ball violently away from him over the parapet. “That I should live to see [MASK] treat me like this! Dismiss me like a thieving scullion, with rantings about morality!
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Blanchette	[MASK] was unaccustomed to talking, and her deafness, result of the scarlet fever, had increased her withdrawal into an interior world which satisfied her. She made this clear: the convent life contented her, she wished for no other, there was no doubt that she had a true vocation.
<name>Robin</name>	Robin	Katherine	He’s been panting for you like a thirsty dog, this age past.” “I didn’t know — at least I never thought much about it,” said [MASK] ruefully. “Half the young squires’re sighing and languishing after somebody, it’s the fashion.”
<name>Robin</name>	Robin	Courtenay	Or [MASK]?" “Ay — mayhap — he had gold rings on his fingers — but the nub of the matter is — shall I go with this tale to the Duke?” The baron pondered. “Not now.
<name>Macbeth</name>	Macbeth	Hugh	“Give me back my child! Show me the way to forgiveness. Lady, Lady, you who are all-merciful, tell me how [MASK]’s murder may be forgiven. Tell me where is my child!” And there was no answer.
<name>Bath</name>	Bath	Kettlethorpe	“But I’ve no money, until I get to [MASK]!” “So I’ve guessed. I’ve silver enow put by to get us there, ye can pay me later, so ye needna look high-nosed about it.”
<name>George</name>	George	John	[MASK], who has brought you this letter, will remain with you until I arrive, about the first of the year. He is a son to be proud of. You have done well with him, and with the others too.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Katherine	The girl had grown beautiful. That fact the convent perhaps could not lay claim to, except that they had obviously fed her well; but her gentle manners, her daintiness in eating — tiese would please the Queen as much as [MASK]’s education might startle her.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	John	“I haf as much right to her as you — changeling.” [MASK] jerked his head back from the hateful face — while the falcon again bated her wings — and he felt his heart begin a slow hard thumping. “What do you mean?”
<name>the</name> (There is no proper name that fits in this context. The sentence is describing a generic white monk, not a specific individual.)	the (There is no proper name that fits in this context. The sentence is describing a generic white monk, not a specific individual.)	Katherine	She stirred as [MASK] and the white monk came to her bed, and when she saw the cowled head and the crucifix the monk held out to her as he said “Pax vobiscum, my daughter” she gave a long sigh and her hand fluttered towards him.
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Sutton	She had run the manor entirely alone, but they struggled through to modest profit again. [MASK]’s outraged feelings had eventually been soothed by marriage with the daughter of a wealthy knight. And it all seemed very long ago.
<name>Dickon</name>	Dickon	Katherine	The children turned from gaping at her and gaped at the horseman. He reined his mount before the drawbridge to the manor, and [MASK] with a great leap at her heart saw that he wore on his tunic the Lancaster badge. She ran across the court and greeted him fearingly.
<name>he</name>	he	Katherine	Pity it wasn’t one or more of the bastards died, he thought. Ah well, one must take the rough with the smooth. As [MASK] did not speak but gazed into the fire, he said on a brisker note, “You must forget the past.
<name>the priest</name>	the priest	Katherine	A runny-nosed lit le acolyte darted out from the vestry, and the priest turned to start the celebration of Mass. [MASK] heard a commotion in the nave, the sound of footsteps on the stone floor, the clink of metal, the rustle of garments.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jack	[MASK] was not the merry hobbledehoy he’d been five years ago on May Day. His years in the army had changed him, he had become rough-tongued and brutal, a malcontent, disinclined for steady work.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Katherine	“Not since the day I came there, madam, and I fear I ate a great deal,” said [MASK] apologetically. “The convent is very poor.” The Queen sat up straighter and spoke with something of her old energy.
<name>Edmund</name>	Edmund	John	Conciliate them — listen to them. Hold this kingdom together for my son!” Tears suddenly spurted down his cheeks and a convulsion shook his body. [MASK] knelt by the couch. His own eyes were moist, while he silently kissed his brother’s swollen hand.
<name>his place</name>	his place	May	She spoke more gently, though in truth she could not imagine how it would be in [MASK], and longed to have him go. It seemed to her that it would be bliss to be alone in bed, and freed from the importunities of this hairy, naked man.
<name>Julian</name>	Julian	Katherine	“She believes you well enough to come to her today.” [MASK] had thought much about the anchoress during these days of recovery, and been astonished to find a longing to speak with her again. She went back that afternoon to the little churchyard and knocked at the cell window.
<name>Shadow</name>	Shadow	Gibbon	His claret-colored robes overflowed his chair and from them rose a pungent odor of hound dog. Her eyes dropped to the last of the three men, and [MASK] was looking up at her, though as always she could see little of the expression beneath the sunken lids.
<name>you</name>	you	Ellis	I hurried straight to you and have missed [MASK].” His hand clung to hers, it was hot and dry. His unshaven face was haggard between the matted wisps of his crinkled hair, and in his voice she had heard the querulous note of ill health.
<name>Baron</name>	Baron	Stafford	A poor tenant, and a poor knight also, since it was well known the Duke had not called him back into service. [MASK] broke the seals and cords on the parchment, read it slowly while a deep mauve tint traveled up his flabby cheeks.
<name>Andrei</name>	Andrei	Katherine	She understood her mistress’s heartache and frantic desire for action, but she was uneasy. When she sent [MASK] forth with a quick hard kiss, she crossed herself and on rare impulse went into the palace chapel for a prayer.
<name>unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name.)	unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name.)	Pieter	“Why, [MASK], you know you may not touch her,” he said in all seriousness, and w th a hint of pity. “She’s a royal gerfalcon. You must get yourself a sparrow hawk.” The narrow rat face glinted, for now the opportunity had corre.
<name>Mr. Earnshaw</name>	Mr. Earnshaw	John	“The poor child’s not to blame.” It was then that [MASK] saw her sitting below his wife’s chair. Her gray eyes with their long shadowing lashes were gazing out over the lists towards the distant oaks.
<name>Trabb's Boy</name>	Trabb's Boy	Katherine	she cried sharp and loud. ‘ Get up!” The lad jumped to his feet, knuckling sleep out of his eyes. “What’s your name?” [MASK] surveyed him with disgust — his filthy hair, dangling red hands and torn dung-spattered smock.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Katherine	“Ay —” she said after a while, “it was He and His love that held me, when all other love was twisted into hate.” She got up and kneeling down by [MASK] looked up into her face.
<name>her</name> (Note: There is no proper name that fits the description in this sentence. The [MASK] token refers to the woman who was just kissed and carried downstairs.)	her (Note: There is no proper name that fits the description in this sentence. The [MASK] token refers to the woman who was just kissed and carried downstairs.)	Palamon	He laughed exultantly and kissed her on the mouth until she ceased to struggle; still holding her pinioned he walked downstairs with her and, mounting [MASK], placed her in front of him on the saddle, half covered by the folds of his cloak.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Katherine	[MASK] thought of the coming meeting w th the sister whom she had not seen in all these years and gave a sudden bounce of joy, which the old white horse instantly resented. He stumbled in a muddy rut, recovered himself, then stood stock still, his long lips thrust out.
<name>D'Artagnan</name>	D'Artagnan	Nirac	You don’t look well. You must rest till 1 return. Here —” and he gave him a gold noble, “a little reward for your many services.” “For my services, mon due,” [MASK] repeated in a peculiar tone.
<name>Doctor</name>	Doctor	Robin	Her face had gone pale as the plaster wall. “Call [MASK], quick!” The dame obeyed. The squire had been tugging at the malmsey keg but he heard the frightened voice, ran up to the court and into the kitchen.
<name>Albert</name>	Albert	Hotspur	With lances braced and horizontal the two horses pounded down the field from opposite directions. As they crossed each other the Duke negligently parried the boy’s wild thrust and on this first course forbore to take advantage of [MASK]’s unguarded left flank.
<name>Vronsky</name>	Vronsky	Robert	“Oh yes, the floods — a great pity,” [MASK] looked at her with kindling eyes, “but you must get more sheep on your demesne farms, take land from your serfs if need be. Wool’s the only crop to bother with!
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Mab	She summoned a serving wench, a taciturn Lancashire lass called [MASK], and told her not to leave the girl alone a moment. She stationed a man-at-arms outside the door, telling him to enter if the servant should call.
<name>Daenerys</name>	Daenerys	Katherine	Through every fiber in her body she had felt that light touch on her hair. His gaze slid slowly over her face, then rested on the cream and umber tiles which floored the chamber. “I sent for you, [MASK], that I might thank you.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	John	Now for a moment she saw his face but it was far away, tiny and warning, then a hand holding a threatening crucifix thrust up as barrier before [MASK]'s face, blocking it off. Her head throbbed agonizingly. She moaned a little, and closed her eyes.
<name>the pilgrim</name>	the pilgrim	Katherine	A man passing behind [MASK] on the street saw the brooch drop, picked it up and lumbered after her, as she wandered blindly along the outside of the abbey walls. “Good pilgrim dame,” said the man, “you dropped this nouche.”
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Katherine	This happened in June when the King was obviously failing and there was a great deal else to be thought of besides the chastisement of one fat bishop. [MASK] was interested to hear of these various clement measures and gradually began to understand something of the conflicting ambitions and turbulence which made difficult any clearcut policy.
<name>York</name>	York	Lancaster	She looked at the Lancastrian arms on the herald’s tabard, at the blue and gray of his trunks, at the falcon badge embroidered on his blue cap — the familiar panoply of [MASK] — and thought how long it was since she had seen it.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Katherine	Even at this distance, one could see that they were large and brilliant, and they seemed to gaze out with brooding intensity from the long narrow face, even when the little head tilted towards the Duke. [MASK], watching in anguish, saw that they spoke but seldom together.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Hugh	He bent close and spoke in a tone he had not used to her since the night of [MASK]’s death. “My child,” he said earnestly, “rouse yourself before it’s too late. I believe you have the strength!” “Rouse myself?”
<name>Sam Gamgee</name>	Sam Gamgee	Hawise	“Seems strange too,” said [MASK], adjusting the clasp, “what coffers full o’ jewels I used to rummage in afore we’d find one to your liking — and now there’s naught to wear but this thing.”
<name>Robin</name>	Robin	Wat	[MASK] pulled his dagger, and kicking his horse, charged — not at the King as it might seem — but past him towards the squire, who ran. The mayor had been waiting for a chance. He spurred his horse crying, “So ribaud, you’d draw steel against your King!”
<name>Esmeralda</name>	Esmeralda	Katherine	It seemed strange to [MASK] to live without the sound of bells. She must learn now to guess at the time, but it mattered little, for here there were no regular hours for anything. All was haphazard. She mounted the stairs and entered the tower’s ancient guardroom.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	John	She was shushed by a hundred whispers, but [MASK] felt a contented glow. He thought that the temper of the London crowd was for him as it never had been before, and he thought that his poor brother had been right to counsel moderation in the handling of the Commons.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Percy	The King’s Council, much pleased with his handling of earlier Scottish disorders, had commissioned him to ride north and negotiate for a prolongation of the truce and cessation of the new hostilities. [MASK]’s touchy sensibilities would have to be soothed.
<name>Dany</name>	Dany	Hawise	[MASK] was a person of consequence now, and not sure that she liked it. She had four waiting women under her, besides a score of maidservants, and her new position required that she dress in heavy flowing woolen robes no matter the temperature.
<name>Beaufort</name>	Beaufort	Joan	There were four Beaufort bastards now, the last, a year-old girl, christened [MASK] for her father. The Duke appeared to dote on all these babes as wholeheartedly as though they had been fair-born.
<name>Conrad</name>	Conrad	Michael	“In what condition is the Savoy, [MASK]?” he said carefully. The baron bowed his head and plucked with a blunt finger at a loosened thong on his greave. “There is nothing left, my lord, nothing.
<name>Tess</name>	Tess	John	[MASK] was silenced. The girl’s poise showed almost aristocratic breeding, though she came of yeoman stock. And it was true that she could not run down to the leech’s tent amongst all the disrobing men and find out for herself.
<name>Khal Drogo</name>	Khal Drogo	damoiselle	“I don’t want to marry you.” His hand closed again over the ring; she saw the muscles o: his neck quiver, and the scar on his cheek go white, but he spoke with control. “It is arranged, [MASK].
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Katrine	“[MASK],” he said touching her shoulder, “it is necessary that we be married first, you know. I trust this is not too great a hindrance. Have you any thought for me — as well as the children?”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Katherine	He offered some to [MASK], but she merely wet her lips, and gave him back the cup. She had become very still, and stood by the tiny window, gazing out into the twilight towards the abbey.
<name>too</name>	too	Michael	The Duke pressed his signet ring slowly into the hot wax, and raising his head, stared into his old friend’s watchful eyes. “Do you suggest that because I’m so often called a traitor, I should now become one, [MASK]?”
<name>Lord Nelson</name>	Lord Nelson	Neville	[MASK] had just been appointed Admiral of the Fleet and as a man of fifty and an arrogant one, it irked him to await the decisions of a man of twenty-nine, though it was his feudal overlord.
<name>Sara</name>	Sara	Katherine	You’re as dearworthy a child of His as anyone.” [MASK]’s gaze cleared and she recoiled. Now she saw what manner of man it was who was speaking to her. A hideous little man with a hump, whose head was twisted deep into his shoulders.
<name>Cambridge</name>	Cambridge	Katherine	With the slapping of oars, sounds more melodious than the rooks floated to [MASK] from a wherry filled with young folk. A shock-haired lad in scarlet jerkin tootled on his pipe while the others caroled merrily, Oh Lenten is come wi’ love to town — sing hi!
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Ellis’ll	“There’s naught in them worth knowing. Damn the man — he should have thought to wait and help me to bed. I grow weary.” “[MASK] be back soon,” she said soothingly, “or maybe I can manage if you lean on my shoulder.
<name>the Prince</name>	the Prince	John	That rightful anointed kings should find themselves in such desperate plight must move every royal heart to valorous response and to arms! That was the gist of the Prince’s letters, and certainly [MASK]’s own heart had responded at once. He burned to distinguish himself in battle as his elder brothers did.
<name>her</name>	her	Blanche	“Well, my dearest lady,” he said, “did you enjoy the tournament?” He looked very boyish with his ruddy gold hair touseled by the helmet, streaks of dirt on his cheeks and a happy look in his brilliant blue eyes, which gazed only at [MASK].
<name>Kurtz</name>	Kurtz	Kawtherine	Then her hand was loosed and the curtain dropped. “[MASK],” said the voice, “you are ill. Before you coom to me again, you must rest and drink fresh bullock’s blood, tonight, at once — and for days — ”
<name>the Duchess</name>	the Duchess	Costanza	She reached the Duchess’s chair and curtsied low, touching the small cold hand extended to her, but she did not kiss it. She raised her eyes as [MASK] said something quick and questioning in Spanish, and she heard the Duke answer, “Si.”
<name>Robin</name>	Robin	King	Ay — shout ye now for [MASK]’s men, sure they be near — string me up at once, and ha’ done wi’ it. See, here’s the noose — all ready.” He pounded his fists on the rope about his waist.
<name>Morgaine</name>	Morgaine	Katherine	“I couldn’t. My soul was eaten up with fear, fear and hate. Mother—” she took a sharp breath and looked deep into [MASK]’s eyes, “did I hear wrong that day in the Avalon Chamber?”
<name>Monte Cristo</name>	Monte Cristo	Nirac	“Halte!” she shouted, “au nom du due!” [MASK]’s grasp loosened, he shook his head in a dazed way, trying to free his hair. She pulled harder so that his face was forced upward and he saw hers.
<name>he</name>	he	Wat	All around him men were leaping, laughing, crying, so that it was hard to hear what else [MASK] said, but the tall ploughman passed it on. “’Twill take a little time to get our charters, the parchment what’ll prove we’re free.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Geoffrey	he asked, having puzzled for some time over the looks of the inscription, and this being the first letter he had ever seen close. “Yes, yes,” she said, tearing at the seal. “Why it’s from [MASK]!”
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Lord	“Nay — only that you were near me, and most patient. And that I love you, sweet heart.” He pinched her cheek and grinned at her. “I shall prove it soon — but not in this gloomy bed. [MASK], what a dismal room.
