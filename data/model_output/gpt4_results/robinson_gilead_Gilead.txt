<name>Romans</name>	Romans	Romans	This morning I read from one of those old sermons your mother keeps leaving around for me. It was on [MASK] I: “They became vain in their reasonings and their senseless heart was darkened, professing themselves to be wise they became fools,” and so on.
<name>Glory</name>	Glory	Glory	The grandfather said, “Her lot was very hard,” and [MASK] slapped him. He threatened to press charges, but I guess he never got around to it. He let the Boughtons bury the little girl in their family plot, since they agreed to pay the expenses and a little more beside.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Boughton	We sat on the steps a good while in the dark and the silence, watching them. Finally [MASK] said, “Man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upward.” And really, it was that night as if the earth were smoldering.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Tobias	My mother said they tasted like furniture, and I’m not sure anyone disagreed. But she always had them, so she used them. You and [MASK] are on the porch steps sorting gourds by size and color and shape, choosing favorites, assigning names.
<name>Jameson</name>	Jameson	Edward	[MASK] cleared his throat and replied, “I am afraid I could not do that in good conscience, sir,” and the color drained out of my father’s face. I knew there had been letters I was not given to read, and there had been somber words between my parents.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Glory	I said, “I take it you’ve talked to [MASK].” “No. I can’t do that. She’d just break her heart over it. She can tell there’s something on my mind. She probably thinks I’m in trouble.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Louisa	So I took his pulpit for that first year. And then they never did come back, except twice to visit, the first time when I lost [MASK] and the second time to talk me into leaving with them.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Reverend	So I said, “You are a good man,” and he gave me a look, purely appraising, and laughed and said, “You can take my word for it, [MASK], there are worse.” But then he said, “What about this town?
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Jack	“Seems to me the stars were brighter in those days. Twice as bright.” “And we were twice as clever.” “Oh, more than that,” he said. “Much more than that.” [MASK] came out and sat down with us.
<name>Polacks</name>	Polacks	Lutheran	“So they’re all gone now.” “Yes, they are. It’s a pity. We have several new Lithuanian families. Of course they’re [MASK].” He laughed. He said, “It is a pity that they’re gone.”
<name>He</name>	He	Glory	You asked if he was not coming along on the birthday jaunt. You were disappointed. [MASK] made some sort of excuse, and your mother said nothing. The tact was audible. I have to wonder what they know, what they have talked about.
<name>John Ames</name>	John Ames	Jack	I assume that if I’d had another father entirely the Lord would still have called me.” I’ll admit I’m a little touchy on that point. [MASK] was quiet for a minute, and then he said, “I always seem to give offense.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Edward	Besides those books I mentioned, [MASK] also gave me the little painting of a marketplace that hangs by the stairs. I must be sure to tell your mother it belongs to me and not to the parsonage. I doubt it’s worth anything to speak of, but she might want it.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Wei	We don’t want to kill him.’ [MASK] It’s true, though. I don’t want to kill him. So I thought I might be able to speak with you. This will be my last attempt, I promise.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Edward	Now that I am become a man, I have put away childish things.” My father left the table, my mother sat still in her chair with tears streaming down her face, and [MASK] passed me the potatoes. I had no idea what was expected of me, so I took some.
<name>Moses</name>	Moses	Sennacherib	Most of them took me to mean they were spared the trenches and the mustard gas, but what I really meant was that they were spared the act of killing. It was just like a biblical plague, just exactly. I thought of [MASK].
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Reverend	So I couldn’t admit to myself that I simply wanted to see her, to hear her voice again. She said, “Good morning, [MASK],” that was all. But I re- member trying to retain the sound of it, trying to hear it again in my mind.
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	John	And on that walk he said to me, “[MASK], you might as well know now what you’re sure to learn sometime. This is a backwater—you must be aware of that already. Leaving here is like waking from a trance.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	T.	I suppose I should be expecting another visit from [MASK]’s father shortly. All the children play at war now. All of them make those sounds of airplanes and bombs and crashing and exploding. We did the same things, playing at cannon fire and bayonet charges.
<name>unappetizing</name>	unappetizing	Presbyterian	There was even a bean salad, which to me looked distinctly [MASK], so anxiety had overspilled its denominational vessel. You’d have thought I’d died. We saved it for lunch. We had a fine time, we three, watching television.
<name>Dorothy</name>	Dorothy	Jack	We fly forgotten as a dream, certainly, leaving the forgetful world behind us to trample and mar and misplace everything we have ever cared for. That is just the way of it, and it is remarkable. [MASK] brought gourds, a whole sack of them.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	T.	You and [MASK] are running up the street to meet him. He has set his glove on top of your head and you think that is a very good thing. You are holding it on with both hands and striding straight-legged along beside him, barefoot and bare-bellied like some primordial princeling.
<name>Lincoln</name>	Lincoln	Reverend	Or maybe it said, Why, [MASK], what in this grieving world are you doing here at a sporting event? My mother said once that he attracted terrible friendship—using “terrible” in the old sense, of course, and meaning only respect.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jack	He’d chuckle a little if anything interesting happened. I believe he had been there most of an hour before he started to speak. Then he said, “You know, [MASK]’s not right with himself yet. Still not right.” And he shook his head.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Boughton	I remember j when they played in those gardens with their cats and kites and bubbles. It was as pretty a sight as you’re likely to see. Their mother was a fine woman, and such a one to laugh! [MASK] says, “I miss her something dreadful.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Glory	It was the kind of thing only his father would forgive him for. So I said, “[MASK] talked to me about all that. I told her not to judge, that there might be more to the situation.” “Thank you.”
<name>McKinley</name>	McKinley	Eisenhower	It didn’t set well with me. He couldn’t stay for coffee. Things went well enough. Then he was off. If I live, I’ll vote for [MASK]. How I wish you could have known me in my strength. I was speaking of visions.
<name>John</name>	John	Reverend	Peace is its own justification.” My grandfather said, “And that’s just what kills my heart, [MASK]. That the Lord never came to you. That the seraphim never touched a coal to your lips-—” My father stood up from his chair.
<name>Owen</name>	Owen	Boughton	I bet they just didn’t like the question. [MASK] says he has more ideas about heaven every day. He said, “Mainly I just think about the splendors of the world and multiply by two. I’d multiply by ten or twelve if I had the energy.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Louisa	It was beautiful to watch you two in the flickering shade. I remember watching [MASK] skipping rope in that street in a bright red coat with her pigtails jumping in the cold. It was early spring, so she didn’t raise any dust to speak of.
<name>Artie</name>	Artie	Tobias	Of course [MASK] can’t watch television, either. Your mother promised his mother we’d see to that whenever he comes over, which is often enough to make you miss the Cisco Kid a lot more frequently than you would like.
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	Edward	I fell to thinking about a sermon my father gave, after the breach with [MASK] had become known and he had had a little while to reflect on it. It was not at all like him to refer to anything private or personal except in the most abstract terms.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Edward	He still had a decent arm for a man his age. I, being very young at the time, believed they would never reconcile, and I was surprised that [MASK] could take the whole situation as calmly as he seemed to.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Adam	“There are people here now who don’t know me from [MASK]. It’s wonderful.” Then he put his hand to his face, his eyes. It was dark, but I could recognize that gesture. He has made it his whole life, I believe.
<name>He</name>	He	T.	You are holding it on with both hands and striding straight-legged along beside him, barefoot and bare-bellied like some primordial princeling. I can’t see the Popsicle streaks down your belly, but I know they’re there. [MASK] is carrying the bat.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Glory	On the way there [MASK] told me how I must try to persuade the family to let the girl and her baby come into town and live in a nice Christian family. I tried that, but her father spat on the floor and said, “She’s already got a nice Christian family.”
<name>Methuselah</name>	Methuselah	Lucretius	You’d have thought a bad argument could be put beyond question by its supposed novelty, for heaven’s sake. And a lot of the newness of this new thinking was as old as [MASK], which he knew as well as I did.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Jack	He has suggested that we out-antiquate the Presbyterians by modeling our new building on the catacombs. I believe I’ll propose it. [MASK] said, “It’s an enviable thing, to be able to receive your identity from your father.”
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	Boughton	Since it is, in a word, Christlike. He has not replied to the note I sent him. I wrote another note, telling him how deeply I felt any fault lay with me, and so on, and carried it over to [MASK]’s myself.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Louisa	Every one of us had bolted out of a barn or a woodshed when a shadow moved or there was a thump of some kind, so there were always more stories to tell. I remember once [MASK] said we ought to pray for the man’s conversion.
<name>Boo</name>	Boo	Tobias	[MASK] isn’t allowed to go to movies, so you brought him almost half your box of Cracker Jacks, which I thought was decent of you. I wonder whether you should go to movies. But with television in the house, there seems no point in forbidding them.
<name>polite</name>	polite	Christian	They brought in some supper. I thought maybe things were improving, but they were all just being [MASK]. In the evening her father told me it would be best if I went away. He said, ‘This time I make no appeal to your honor.’
<name>Lucien</name>	Lucien	Reverend	It must be said, however, that they buried them not very deeply, and perhaps more as one would bank a fire than smother it. They had a particular way of addressing each other when the old bitterness was about to flare up. “Have I offended you in some way, [MASK]?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Boughton	This morning I strolled over to [MASK]’s. He was sitting in the screened porch behind the trumpet vines, dozing. He and his wife were fond of those vines because they attract hummingbirds. They’ve pretty well taken over now, so the house looks sort of like a huge duck blind.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Glory	“I’ll go find [MASK]. She’ll tell me how to make myself useful. You always said that was the best way to keep out of trouble.” “No, stay,” your mother said. And he did.
<name>He</name>	He	Jack	Then he said, “To conclude is not in the nature of the enterprise.” [MASK] smiled at your mother as if he was looking for an ally, someone to share his frustration, but she just sat very still and studied her hands.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Jack	[MASK] smiled and handed the magazine back to me. “True,” he said. That was the first I’d seen of him since Sunday, since the service. He went out through the chancel and the side door, to avoid shaking hands with me, I believe.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Louisa	That was the first time in my life I ever knew what it was to love another human being. Not that I hadn’t loved people before. But I hadn’t realized what it meant to love them before. Not even my parents. Not even [MASK].
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Glory	When I left I saw [MASK] standing in the hallway, looking in on all the quiet talk there was in the parlor, her brothers and sisters and their wives and husbands and their children, grown and half grown. Trading news and talking politics and playing hearts.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Boughton	[MASK] owns his house. I used to think that was an enviable thing, but there’s been no one but him to see to it, and things have gotten a little out of hand these last years. He seemed in excellent spirits.
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Edward	This construction of the matter would certainly have forbidden, or at least discouraged, any impulse he might have felt to blame [MASK]. The thoughtlessness of any individual, when it is seen to be in service to the mindfulness of the Lord, cannot justify anger.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Boughton	One of [MASK]’s boys traveled to the Mediterranean for some reason, and he sent back that big shell I have always kept on my desk. I have loved the word “susurrus” for a long time, and I had never found another use for it.
<name>Ernest</name>	Ernest	Edward	That has been the fashion for the last hundred years or so. My brother [MASK] gave his book to me, The Essence of Christianity, thinking to shock me out of my uncritical piety, as I knew at the time. I had to read it in secret, or so I believed.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Reverend	And I am not a gentleman.” He wouldn’t let me object to that. “I know what the word means, [MASK]. Though I can now say that the influence of my wife worked a change in me for the better, at least temporarily.”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Boughton	And he said, “Anywhere else.” He smiled and cleared his throat and said, “I got that letter I’ve been waiting for.” My heart was very heavy. There was [MASK] sitting in his Morris chair staring at nothing.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Edward	Remembering my youth makes me aware that I never really had enough of it, it was over before I was done with it. Whenever I think of [MASK], I think of playing catch in a hot street and that wonderful weariness of the arms.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lorraine	“And I said, ‘Now I will have to walk you back to your door.’ “And she laughed and said, ‘Of course you will.’ “So I did. And then the other woman came home, [MASK], the one who shared her rooms.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Edward	You might show some respect for them.” And [MASK] replied, and this was very wrong of him, “When I was a child, I thought as a child. Now that I am become a man, I have put away childish things.”
<name>Hitchens</name>	Hitchens	Feuerbach	[MASK]* is a famous atheist, but he is about as good on the joyful aspects of religion as anybody, and he loves the world. Of course he thinks religion could just stand out of the way and let joy exist pure and undisguised.
<name>John</name>	John	Boughton	That feeling of a baby’s brow against the palm of your hand—how I have loved this life. [MASK] had christened her, as I said, but I laid my hand on her just to bless her, and I could feel her pulse, her warmth, the damp of her hair.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Della	I thought that [MASK]’s standing with her family might be helped if I impressed him as a plausibly decent man, and my only chance of doing that was by going away. And I could see what a very good life she had.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Glory	Finally, I was hesitant to go to the house at all, fearing that my mere presence might be an irritant or a provocation, as I feared my staying away might be also. Then [MASK] came by to say hello. She seemed in fine spirits.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Tobias	Then I came home and your mother made me lie down and sent you off with [MASK]. She lowered the shades. She knelt beside me and stroked my hair for a while. And after a little rest I got up and wrote this, which I have now read over.
<name>Bernanos</name>	Bernanos	Bernanos	Besides, what else did I know in those days but texts and priestliness and static? And what else did I love? There was a book many people read at that time, The Diary of a Country Priest. It was by a French writer, [MASK].
<name>Stendhal</name>	Stendhal	Edward	What need had an old soldier like me to defend himself even from mockery, if that was what he was up to? There was no question of need, there was only habit. I believe I have tried never to say anything [MASK] would have found callow or naive.
<name>Abraham</name>	Abraham	John	Once he told us at supper, “This afternoon I met the Lord over by the river, and we fell to talking, you know, and He made a suggestion I thought was interesting. He said, ‘[MASK], why don’t you just go home and be old?’
<name>Balaam</name>	Balaam	Balaam	Like [MASK]’s ass, it’s seen the angel I haven’t seen yet, and it’s lying down in the path. And I must say, too, that my mind, with all its deficiencies, has certainly kept me interested.
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Institution	Normally I would not preach on the Words of [MASK] themselves when the Sacrament is the most beautiful illumination of them there could be. But I have been thinking a great deal about the body these last weeks. Blessed and broken.
<name>John Ames</name>	John Ames	Calvin	We know nothing about heaven, or very little, and I think [MASK] is right to discourage curious speculations on things the Lord has not seen fit to reveal to us. Adulthood is a wonderful thing, and brief. You must be sure to enjoy it while it lasts.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Boughton	A remarkable thing to consider. There’s a sermon here. The Prodigal Son as the Gospel text. I should ask [MASK] if he has noticed this. But of course he has, of course he has. I must give that more thought.
<name>Isaiah</name>	Isaiah	Isaiah	(I hope you are familiar with the prophets, particularly [MASK].) Now, your mother never talks about herself, really, and she never admits to having felt any sort of grief in her life at all.
<name>Casey</name>	Casey	Edward	You had his mitt, a fine new fielder’s mitt that reached almost to your elbow, and he had that old glove of [MASK]’s that I keep on my desk. No webbing at all, no pocket to speak of.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Boughton	Dust and grasshoppers are fine in their way, too, within limits. Whatever is coming, I’d be sorry to miss it. [MASK] was on his porch, “listening to the breeze,” he said. “Feeling the breeze.”
<name>Stonewall</name>	Stonewall	Iowa	He thought he should go as a regular soldier, but they told him he was too old. They told him [MASK] had a graybeard regiment he could join, for old fellows, which wouldn’t go into combat but would guard supplies and rail lines and so on.
<name>James</name>	James	Reverend	Then the band struck up, and my father went to him and put his hand on his left shoulder, and brought him down to us. My mother said, “Thank you, [MASK],” and my grandfather shook his head and said, “I doubt it did much good.”
<name>Bible</name>	Bible	Feuerbach	I doubt it’s worth anything to speak of, but she might want it. I’m going to set aside that [MASK] with the books I will ask your mother to be sure to save for you. I hope you will read it sometime.
<name>Finch</name>	Finch	Edward	I read it the first time under the covers, and down by the creek, because my mother had forbidden me to have any further contact with [MASK], and I knew that would include my reading an atheistical book he had given me.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Boughton	Still not right.” And he shook his head. I said, “We’ve talked about that.” “Oh yes, he talks,” [MASK] said. “But he’s never told me why he’s come back here.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Boughton	I believe that plague was a great sign to us, and we refused to see it and take its meaning, and since then we have had war continuously. I’m not entirely sure I do believe that. [MASK] would say, “That’s the pulpit speaking.”
<name>Shakespeare</name>	Shakespeare	Edward	That was a good deal longer than two months ago. I believe it was last year. I thought at the time it might have puzzled a few people, but I was pleased with it. I even wished [MASK] could have heard it.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Boughton	When I look at [MASK], I see a funny, generous young man, full of vigor. He’s on two canes now, and he says if he could sprout a third arm there would be three. He hasn’t stood in a pulpit these ten years.
<name>John</name>	John	Glory	But she cut her foot somehow and died of the infection. The last time they visited her, they saw she was in bad shape. So [MASK] went and found a doctor, but by then there was nothing to be done.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Glory	I went out to help them look around a little, and darned if those sunflowers hadn’t been pulled back, bent over the fence so their heads were hanging down on the other side of it. [MASK] said, “It could have been the wind that did that.”
<name>Emmett</name>	Emmett	Boughton	[MASK] was slow getting his growth. Then, after a short childhood, he was taller than me for about forty years. Now he’s so bent over I don’t know how you’d calculate his height. He says his spine has turned into knuckle bones.
<name>T</name>	T	Tobias	You and [MASK] came trudging home at dawn and spread your sleeping bags on your bedroom floor and slept till lunchtime. (You had heard growling in the bushes. T. has brothers.) Your mother had fallen asleep in the parlor with a book in her lap.
<name>Prufrock</name>	Prufrock	Augustine	It’s humiliating to have written as much as [MASK], and then to have to find a way to dispose of it. There is not a word in any of those sermons I didn’t mean when I wrote it.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	T.	I believe my heart would prefer that I stay here in this chair, at least for the time being. You three have come out in the side yard. He’s batting fungo. You and [MASK] are running hither and yon as if to catch the ball.
<name>Ames</name>	Ames	Boughton	We had some very pleasant evenings here in my kitchen. [MASK] is a staunch Presbyterian—as if there were another kind. So we have had our disagreements, though never grave enough to do any harm. I don’t think it was resentment I felt then.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Della	He cleared his throat. “If you can really spare me the time, I will explain. Thank you. You see, I met [MASK] during a fairly low point in my life. I won’t go into that.
<name>Crusader</name>	Crusader	Sparkle	She called her cat [MASK], for the white patch on its forehead. It disappeared finally. I suspect it got caught stealing rabbits, a sin to which it was much given, Christian cat that we knew it to be, stiff-jointed as it was by that time.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Louisa	I got his meaning, though, and I did no more baptizing until I was ordained. Two or three of that litter were taken home by the girls and made into fairly respectable house cats. [MASK] took a yellow one. She still had it when we were married.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Herbert	Wherefore each part Of my hard heart Meets in this frame, To praise thy Name: That, if I chance to hold my peace, These stones to praise thee may not cease. Yet awhile. Well, if [MASK] is right, this old body is as new a creation as you are yourself.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Boughton	Last Sunday when we went to [MASK]’s for supper, I saw you looking at his hands. They are so full of arthritis now that they’re all skin and knuckles. You think he’s terribly old, and he’s younger than I am.
<name>John Ames</name>	John Ames	Augustine	[MASK] says the Lord loves each of us as an only child, and that has to be true. “He will wipe the tears from all faces.” It takes nothing from the loveliness of the verse to say that is exactly what will be required.
<name>He</name>	He	Jack	“You should have seen him thirty years ago.” “I did.” “Well,” his father said, “you should have been paying attention.” [MASK] shrugged. “I was.” Now, that got to me a little.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Glory	After a while we went on back to the car and came home. [MASK] said, “I do not understand one thing in this world. Not This came to my mind because remembering and forgiving can be contrary things. No doubt they usually are.
<name>John</name>	John	Boughton	I walked over to [MASK]’s to see what he was up to. I found him in a terrible state of mind. Tomorrow would have been his fifty-fourth anniversary. He said, “The truth is, I’m just very tired of sitting here alone.
<name>Reggie</name>	Reggie	Boughton	And I’d made a little experiment with hair tonic. [MASK] met me in the road, as he often did in those days, and he looked at me and chuckled, and I thought, What an utter and transparent fool I am.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Jack	People clearly knew the car was stolen, but they couldn’t resist owning it for a little while, even though they didn’t have the nerve to keep it—which kept the price very reasonable and the temptation that much greater. It was [MASK] himself who told me what he had done.
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	Tobias	From time to time, you have seemed so lonely to us, and here is [MASK], an estimable chap, an answer to our prayers, and you let him sit on the porch until some cartoon is over. But I’m not inclined to do much forbidding these days.
