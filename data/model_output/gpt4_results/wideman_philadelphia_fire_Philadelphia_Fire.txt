<name>He</name>	He	J.B.	Pinned it if he’d owned a pin. I am a vet. Lost voice in war. Please help. Shit like that not really funny. [MASK] knows better. He’d been educated. Brought up right. Bad luck to laugh at another’s misfortune.
<name>Archimedes</name>	Archimedes	Sam	Tongues of light flicked at the sun. This old man still counting, still worried about measuring up. His eyes are invisible behind thick lenses. Moon focals. A basset hound’s droopy dewlaps. Why was [MASK] still so hard on himself?
<name>Straw</name>	Straw	King	Just talk. You ask anybody around here, the ones still here or the ones burnt out, if you can find them. Ask them if [MASK] or his people ever laid a hand on anybody. You find one soul say he been hurt by one of us
<name>He</name>	He	J.B.	Nobody’s property. [MASK] could make what he wished of them. He took some home. Pieced them together even now on this street comer, squeezed a scene into focus, fine-tuning his slide projector till an image freezes bright and precise on this screen.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Timbo	Shit. He had closed his eyes, exhausted. The nap lasted three hours. Sleep at last. Sleep at last. He bolts up. Checks his watch. Time, but none to spare. He figured [MASK] for at least a half hour late.
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Caroline	He had returned to bed, masturbated, careful not to wake [MASK], his back inches from hers, miles from her in a place with different weather, his face turned up to drink warm rain. Out of a misty dream Our path emerges for a while, then closes Within a dream.
<name>Grady</name>	Grady	Papers	They come in where I work. Smiling and grinning and falling over each other to pay when I bring the check. You think they going to hang one their own? Watch. Commission will claim some poor blood lit the match. [MASK] been spreading that lie already.
<name>Who</name>	Who	Simba	Certain things had to have happened for any of it to make sense. What I’m left with, what I’m certain of is not very much at all. But indelible. Real. The singing. The broken neck and slumped body. The weight. [MASK]?
<name>Jerry</name>	Jerry	Timbo	Hey. I’m just trying to help, good buddy. I want to see the play happen. But I agree with [MASK]. It can’t be the girl. Wait. I think I see a way.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Simmie	A book people have to buy. You want [MASK]’s story so you can sell it. You going to pay him if he talks to you? It’s not about money. Then why you doing it? The truth is, I’m not really sure.
<name>Entropy</name>	Entropy	Tempestas	Another piece of himself he’ll quickly forget until one day, at another intersection he’ll fall prey to whatever it is making him giddy, nearly sick at the stomach today. He’ll be remembering. It will all come back. None of it. [MASK] also means time.
<name>Neil</name>	Neil	Cudjoe	Kids played rough and loud in the pools below the fountain. No adults in sight. Kind of place [MASK] had only seen from a distance when he was growing up. Not nice. Not safe. White bodies rare. Lines were drawn in his family.
<name>Rastas</name>	Rastas	Rastas	When every day them monkeys making a monkey out of me. You wouldn’t believe the ordinance brought to bear To drive them [MASK] out their 1 air Dreads didn’t falter, they fought toe to toe But the odds were too heavy, they had to go
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Cudjoe	News teams, mobile cameras, pretty boy and girl reporters with clipboards and remote microphones. Activity onstage. Respectable citizens have taken charge. [MASK] watches the event stagger into place; he’s a spy, a noncombatant. An insta-cam helicopter buzzes over once, high above the action.
<name>He</name>	He	Cudjoe	No clue anybody will play here today, tomorrow, ever. Was the court dead or just sleeping? Best action migrated all over the city. Years ago [MASK] knew where they’d be playing any night of the week, they being the bad dudes, the cookers, superstars.
<name>Obama</name>	Obama	Cat	Tell the truth. Leave the mayor alone, youall. [MASK]’s doing his best. Hate to hear people bad-mouthing him. Specially black people. Finally voted in a black man, and now nothing he does good enough for you. Ain’t about black.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	J.B.	Don’t know what hit you till you’re coughing and gagging and puking and everybody in a funky black stew rolling round on the floor. [MASK] dies frustrated, wondering how his life would have been different if he’d availed himself of the opportunity to open that last box.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Cudjoe	[MASK] a big boy now, but still a city boy, with a city boy’s fears. The gloomy interior of the bam, its smells, ghostly animals ruminating, bumping around below the loft bothered him. Large, moist-breathed beasts had inhabited this space.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	J.B.	We do have a chance to unfold our days one by one and piece together a story that shapes us. It’s the only life anyone ever has. Hold on. PART THREE T -L he old town’s dying behind [MASK]’s back.
<name>Slothrop</name>	Slothrop	Nodding	Dropped thirty thousand feet from the 747, the hands spin, bells chatter, then it raises a salty geyser in the gray ocean. [MASK] on his feet, weary as a whipped dog. For better or worse he is up for the day. Barely day.
<name>Langston</name>	Langston	Cudjoe	[MASK]’s program doesn’t mention them. Invited or not, they become as necessary, as natural as a heartbeat to the event. The first speaker, a tall, fiftyish, elegantly brown man in a gray suit, glances over his shoulder at the drummers.
<name>Chancy</name>	Chancy	Gulls	I heard him say those words, ma’am. No doubt about it. Just as plain as I’m telling you now. Teach me is what he said. Sure of it. Thought you might want to know, ma’am. [MASK] floated over the dump.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Cudjoe	No kids playing in the hollow, no dog walkers strolling on the path, just the two of us, [MASK] had thought as he stopped and ambled down the green slope, lower than she was, so he could check out her face.
<name>Zeppelin</name>	Zeppelin	Chopper	Drums rumble behind him again till he looks at his watch and raises his arm for silence and begins the countdown. [MASK]’s over the house now... cop in a flak vest riding shotgun with a Uzi in his lap is the bombardier...
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Darnell	He tastes earth as he drains a can of beer. O.T. smoking a dgarette. [MASK] sucking on a joint. Or was it the other way round? Too dark to tell. If the lips opened to sing, to kiss, to tell a story.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	J.B.	Poor boy long way from home. [MASK] knows what goes round comes round and what goes up must come down. And what comes down comes down sometimes a whole lot faster than it goes up. And when you least expect it.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Cudjoe	The founders were dead now. Buried in their wigs, waistcoats, swallowtail coats, silk hose clinging to their plump calves. A foolish old man flying a kite in a storm. [MASK] decides he will think of himself as a reporter covering a story in a foreign country.
<name>Chigurh</name>	Chigurh	Cudjoe	Shit yeah. We gots a budget for that. Ain’t that many ofyouall. We can afford it. [MASK] had showered, then flopped across the bed for a few minutes to catch his breath, soothe his pounding head, sneak up on the long morning.
<name>Arturo</name>	Arturo	Sam	So scared he turned the trip to [MASK]’s island into a nightmare, found ways to positively, personally put a hurt on his sons and the woman he loves. That first night on the island he couldn’t sleep.
<name>He</name>	He	Cudjoe	Her thin mouth curls into a smile. He picks a candle from the box she extends. Each pale candle wears a pale paper cup impaled on its shaft. [MASK] grasps his so its collar rests on his fist. He wonders if the lady purchased the candles.
<name>Leopold</name>	Leopold	J.B.	He was a child, lying in his blood on the sidewalk They were old, old men tottering away. The handwriting’s too tiny. Light’s too poor. It’s been a long day and two or three attempts to decipher the manuscript are enough for [MASK]
<name>Jerome</name>	Jerome	Cudjoe	They got that part right. Been awhile. [MASK] is thinking, and that’s why he missed. On line but not enough arch. He’d returned to the park to find a game and now he was trying to guide the ball rather than shoot it.
<name>Beloved</name>	Beloved	Caliban	Gingerbread houses and little mind-ing-their-own-business cottages with nobody home. [MASK]’s blueprint for the future: First, gimme. Then I’ll be much obliged, he says. Flesh today. Word tomorrow is the proper order of business.
<name>Boogie</name>	Boogie	tom	Lemme see. It was the Carousel when we were in school, then the Sunset Grill, then the Hi Hat Lounge, then it didn’t have a name. Just a trifling little comer joint. Back part where we boogied [MASK] down.
<name>Deliverance</name>	Deliverance	Caliban	Her father needs her to comer the future, her loins the highway, the bridge, sweet chariot to carry his claim home. Her womb perpetuates his property. Signs, seals, delivers. Spirit needs flesh. Word needs deed. And [MASK] understands the connections.
<name>Moses</name>	Moses	Moses	So he shakes his head and moves on, a wave of pedestrians parting before him like he’s brandishing [MASK]’s rod. A few blocks farther on, in the alley behind the golden arches, sits the best Dumpster for half a mile in any direction.
<name>Callum</name>	Callum	Sam	Barely large enough to fit a bed. One oval window with a crack in the glass. This room’s on the side of the house away from the sea, faces scrubby pinewoods that are part of a forest belt [MASK] had said bisects the island.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Timbo	He’d lunched with his old pal [MASK] and whatever it was destroying the city gorged itself upon them and shit them out even as ice cubes dinged in crystal goblets and silver coffee spoons chimed against the edges of bone-china cups. Not so much a thought as a sensation.
<name>Viola</name>	Viola	Miranda	I’ll look it up. Or maybe we’ll look it up in the dictionary together. The more you learn about [MASK] the better you’ll be at playing her. She lived four hundred years ago but try and think of her being somebody you know.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Caroline	She could draw the shades and treat him as if he didn’t exist. Feast and famine. Like those extremes that were the predictable beat of his life with [MASK], extremes substituting for dependable, easy, common ground they’d never been able to establish.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	J.B.	A few lines at the top of a page. A block of black writing cramped into a space not much larger than a postage stamp. Rest of the page untouched. Waste of paper, [MASK] thinks. He tries again. Lets the pages flutter.
<name>Bloom</name>	Bloom	Corey	Would he understand one word? Maybe they could start all over again. Both of them with time to spare. He had no pressing engagements before noon. And this floater dunning him the very image of idleness. [MASK] could tell the long version of his tragic history.
<name>Rasputin</name>	Rasputin	Caliban	She descended upon him like the New England schoolmarms with their McGuffey’s Readers, the college kids with books and ballots. [MASK], witches’ whelp that he was, had a better idea. Her need, his seed joined.
<name>Jefferson</name>	Jefferson	Cudjoe	Philly folks were sharp. Thousands of young ladies looking good, piling out of gray buildings between 4:00 and 5:00. Botded up all day then free to strut their stuff. A special time. Like the moment the 2:30 bell released [MASK]’s students from school.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Corey	I am a vet. Lose voice in war. Please help. [MASK] contemplates stopping here and now, reciting his own gory story. Would the black derelict listen? Would he laugh? Take pity? Be outraged and angry? Would he understand one word?
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Caroline	Letters to [MASK] and the boys I never sent. A boring life really. Like a spectator from a distance watching my country kill itself. Watching and waiting for my old life to disappear. And take me with it. Some things never change, I guess.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Sesame	A sense of cheating. Of being more and less to her than I wish to admit to myself Did I have to ask the right questions in order to free the name? Free myself. Open, [MASK], the magic formula must be relex-ified precisely.
<name>Vito</name>	Vito	rust	Avoids eyes. He’s busy panning the huge room, missing nothing. Lots of Liberace hair, shining, every strand in place. Humble, my ass. Pulls in a fortune daily. Each and every day. More on weekends. This dago like [MASK].
<name>God</name>	God	Greed	When you want something you go to [MASK]’s pocket. It stinks, it’s pukey down in there. Dead babies and disease and children starving with flies and maggots in the pus draining out their sores and assholes.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Timbo	You know who I mean. The guy. The chick. C’mon. You know who I’m talking about. What’s the cat’s name? A shooting gallery of faces as [MASK] ticks off their signs: bad breath, big tits, the stuttering, dickhead motherfucker.
<name>Alia</name>	Alia	Cudjoe	Then [MASK] had leaned closer, tried to sneak a whiff of her. Scent of the sacred residue. Was a portion of her body unwashed since the holy coupling? She had looked upon the King’s face and survived.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sam	motionless in an instant, slamming the door on any possibility of nighttime, bedtime reconciliation. He’d boozed himself into feeling better about everything. Flirted with [MASK]’s wife and daughter, and their smiling approval, the teasing back and forth had reaffirmed for him the charm he believed he exercised over womankind.
<name>Tre</name>	Tre	Skeets	I’m in shape. I can run. But it’s been awhile since I’ve played. Not much ball where I was. Ain’t nothing out there on the court. We’ll win a few and you be cooking like the old days. [MASK] grown up.
<name>Easy</name>	Easy	Cudjoe	Beaucoup casualties. Bump into some of them downtown every day. Walking round like ghosts of they own goddamned selves. So what’s different now? Maybe nothing, [MASK]. I wonder why we ever believed it was spozed to get better. Who fed us that lie?
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Cynthia	Mind love. Perfect because unrequited, impossible. The idea of him ravished me, though of course I preferred nights with [MASK]. It’s just that one needs a friend these days. Gender bonding. A gang.
<name>He</name>	He	Simmie	His mother died in the fire. All dead. All of them dead. But he escaped. She pushed him and two the other kids out the basement window. [MASK] said he was scared, didn’t want to go.
<name>Stavrogin</name>	Stavrogin	Sam	One fell short, bounced off the pile, tumbled, burst, disgorged its contents on the clear space in front of the mound. Had [MASK] known he was dying? In less than two years paramedics would find him on the parquet floor of his kitchen, unconscious.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Sam	[MASK] wouldn’t dare give the script only a cursory, drunken reading. Of course he’d be his meticulous, conscientious self. Another read-through tomorrow. Up at dawn, crisp, sober as morning, as the sea breeze that worried the front porch swing.
<name>Oyeronke</name>	Oyeronke	Cudjoe	Scent of the sacred residue. Was a portion of her body unwashed since the holy coupling? She had looked upon the King’s face and survived. [MASK] sees a rat-gnawed, bug-infested mattress spotted with the blood of insects, of humans.
<name>Rucker</name>	Rucker	Clark	Don’t care what college you play for. On the neighborhood courts no coaches, no referees, no scholarships, nothing but you and what you can do and a whole lot of bad brothers who could play some ball. Some Sunday afternoons the action came to [MASK].
<name>James</name>	James	Cudjoe	They are separated and locked together by her gaze. Both figures larger than life, greener than the britde grass. Both blind. In a notebook somewhere [MASK] had recorded the inscription carved into the pedestal. For his story about people who frequent the park.
<name>Rastaman</name>	Rastaman	Dreads	Bout some dreadlocked bloods trying to do their thing And a evil Empire with a evil King Not the kind of story I like to tell [MASK] was seeking heaven, all they caught was hell Didn’t eat no meat, let their kids run naked
<name>Llewelyn</name>	Llewelyn	Simmie	You going to pay him if he talks to you? It’s not about money. Then why you doing it? The truth is, I’m not really sure. You mean you’ll do your thing and forget [MASK]. Write your book and gone.
<name>Nighttime</name>	Nighttime	Trick	Part of being in the game is anticipating, knowing who’s on the court with you and what they’re likely to do. It’s darker. Not everything works now that works in daylight. [MASK] is knowing what does. And staying within that range.
<name>There</name>	There	Mosdy	He won’t be able to walk tomorrow. [MASK] players around the bench, men who’ve just finished the last game of the evening, each one relaxing in his own funk, cooling out, talking the game, beginning to turn it into stories.
<name>Anger</name>	Anger	Bitterness	Maybe what it is is working for them damned peckerwoods any kind of way. Taking their shit. [MASK] got to settle somewhere don’t it? Naturally it run down to your feet. Anyway, I’m tired and hassled. Ain’t ready for no more nonsense.
<name>him</name>	him	Cudjoe	He edges around the fountain’s rim, closer to others in the audience so his candle can be touched. Share your light, brother. He hears someone say that. A fingernail of flame gutters in the cup a man holds up for [MASK] and two others.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Sam	Sturdy calf muscles jump like animals foraging under her skin. A spidery delta of blue veins on the back of one thigh. He looks away as he climbs after her. She wants to show him a picture she’s painted of the island. A surprise intended for [MASK].
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Cudjoe	A great passion replayed, only this time he wouldn’t fuck over his woman. No lies. No cheating. A better Sam, reborn penitent, wiser for having sinned grievously. Capable of unconditional love. He’s screaming at [MASK]. Leave her alone.
<name>Godot</name>	Godot	Prospero	[MASK] still the boss. Master of ceremonies. Spinning the wheel of fortune. Having the last laugh. Standing there thinking he’s cute telling everybody what to do next. And people can’t wait to clap their hands and say thanks. Aw, man.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	J.B.	[MASK]’s revenge. Honk, hoot, and ohhh, ahhhh. Ooop-poop-a-doop. The jumper sure gave them something to talk about. Bet he makes the six o’clock news. White, well dressed, a gentleman caller dropping in unexpectedly.
<name>Arctor</name>	Arctor	Cassy	This out-of-sync van that plummets forever against a tourist-bureau poster of mountainous Mexican scenery would be full of hippies, boiling, squealing like gulls. [MASK] naked in the moonlight on his first trip to the island. She’s gone second time around.
<name>Beatty</name>	Beatty	Lawd	[MASK]. He jumps like the spirit got holt to him. Hopping on one leg. Then the other. Hippy-hop down the bunny trail. And then there is a commercial break. And then a tape of his own screaming he lip-syncs.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Calibans	Later, afterwards, we’ll rap in that postcoital snuggle and baby-babble each to each, coo-coo like pigeons, our own aboriginal, lovey-dovey tongue and that talk elaborated by generations of [MASK] will grow up to be a full-fledged voting member of the United League of languages.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Judy	We’re both riveted. The channel riveted. We are all set in stone. [MASK] stops telling me, Don’t touch that dial. She’s having it her way this once without a fuss or fight. We both wonder what the fuck’s going on.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Cudjoe	Maybe this is a detective story, [MASK] says to himself. Out there the fabled city of hard knocks and exciting possibilities. You could get wasted out there and lots did. His job sleaze control. Bright lights, beautiful people, intrigue, romance.
<name>Jerome</name>	Jerome	Cudjoe	Water sputters, teasingly hot then cold then a little of each. [MASK] wipes away the last gobs of soap from his body with a washcloth, steering clear of the spray, cursing it and the landlord’s mammy.
<name>Jerome</name>	Jerome	Cudjoe	Changed gears when he wanted to. Let the other team stay close enough to believe they had a chance. Then blew them away—steals, slams, blocked shots. [MASK] did his bit. Hit a lay-up and a couple jumpers from the wing.
<name>James</name>	James	Cudjoe	[MASK]’s offered a candle by a pasty-faced woman. She’s walked a good ways to reach him, around the fountain to the periphery of the small crowd where he’s stationed himself She is his mother’s age. She’s overdressed for the heat.
<name>Milford</name>	Milford	King	[MASK]’s people demanding this and demanding that. Letting their kids run around naked, sassing the police and getting their heads busted, cussing out the neighborhood on loudspeakers, dumping shit in their backyard, demanding the release of their so-called brothers and sisters from the slam.
<name>Reilly</name>	Reilly	J.B.	They all looked like patients to [MASK] Love at first sight. Love among the ruins. Paramedic and pretty lady would name their firstborn after the dead guy. What was his name anyway? Was his identity embossed in the asphalt? A death mask Xeroxed there?
<name>Indians</name>	Indians	Indians	Horses snorting and spurs jingle-jangling the blue men gallop down a hill, toward the snowy riverbank where [MASK] sleeping peacefully cause they don’t know what’s dropping out the sky on their heads. Cannon fire. Snow churned blood red. She thinks of that.
<name>Jonas</name>	Jonas	J.B.’d	More or less. If a shoe’s not perfect, [MASK] learned to wear it anyway. Shoes tougher to come by than feet. If the shoe don’t fit, it will soon enough. The crowd had dispersed.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Puzzled	[MASK]. Appalled by the unforeseen consequences of his good intentions. In the stillness of our bedroom her breast registers as deep silence. She sighs, extension of the breast, the breast under which she hides in a cage of ribs her heart.
<name>Atkinson</name>	Atkinson	Sam	The island’s in your painting. I can see it. [MASK] would see more. Much more. Of course he’d love it. It’s beautiful. Thank you. It was important to finish it. Even after. The island started me painting again.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Rachel	Crying for them. Spying on them. Waiting for the lights of the city to come on. [MASK] led him by the hand up to a ladder at one end of the bam. She mounted first. Tail of her pleated skirt bobs as she climbs.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Pharaoh	[MASK] content to be buried in the monument he’d constructed because that’s what he’d settled into doing, dying by inches. He mopes around all day in his robe and slippers. Won’t dress. Barely eats no matter what I cook for him.
<name>Words</name>	Words	Decorative	Words between us have become useless. [MASK]. They can’t furnish the empty rooms of our conversation. But the phone rings and he’s two thousand miles away so all we have to work with are words. I can’t hug him. Smile at him.
<name>Macbeth</name>	Macbeth	Shakespeare	This is a play featuring skinny black kids. Point of the whole thing is for them to master [MASK]. To leam from putting on the play. To teach their teachers and families. Maybe teach this whole neanderthal city what kids are capable of.
<name>They</name>	They	Mize	[MASK] well have been mounted on horseback when they trotted past you on those spindly spike heels. If you pinned a bushy tail on their high, tight behinds it would have sashayed back and forth, working hard as a windshield wiper in a storm. More ghosts.
<name>Sportcoat</name>	Sportcoat	Cudjoe	[MASK], my man. How long’s it been, brother? How long? Too long. Don’t shake my hand, nigger. Come round here and hug me. Men's is lowed to hug and squeeze each other these days. Mmmmm. Yessir.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	J.B.	Probably popping litde greenies or reds or yellows with her savior, whooping and bounc- ing while he cries giddyup, giddyup, slapping her trim thigh as he prongs her in the ass. Only [MASK] mourns the shadow drawn by a man with a big stick.
<name>Lolita</name>	Lolita	Becky	So easy. The name I couldn’t squeeze out, no matter how hard I tried. Was I compromised by the sexuality of that moment. Seeing [MASK] as female / woman though she was just a child. One I am bound to protect as a daughter.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	J.B.	[MASK] chose a spot where he could ignore them conspicuously, self-important as any of these chumps, absorbed by his business, part of which was paying them no mind. Let the chumps wonder. Let them dig. More to life than slaving in some office.
<name>Hitler</name>	Hitler	Hider	He knows the ache of absence, the phantom presence of pain that tricks him into reaching down again and again to stroke the emptiness. He’s stopped asking why. His identification with the boy persists like a discredited rumor. Like [MASK]’s escape from the bunker.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Cudjoe	Night when the balloons will return, shrunken to black specks in the black sky, each speck heavy as a galaxy. Wind can’t lift the heat but it teases and strokes, a promise of fall coolness dashed across [MASK]’s sweaty face.
<name>Trout</name>	Trout	J.B.	Gone again, the yo-yo wailing of its siren crashes against brick and stone, shatters them, brings down the walls. As plate glass explodes around him and clouds of black dust boil higher and higher, [MASK] sings the blues: Poor boy long way from home.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Prospero	He’ll read [MASK] to his ducklings and they’ll cue up behind him, all in a cute line, a dragon’s tail, kite tail, string of letters on a page. A word for what they must do, Imprint.
<name>Four</name>	Four	King	Wasn’t any trouble till people started coming at us. Then [MASK] start to woofing to keep folks ofFour case. Just woofing. Just talk. You ask anybody around here, the ones still here or the ones burnt out, if you can find them.
<name>Ulysses</name>	Ulysses	Caliban	So it’s [MASK] who gets moved out, exiled, dispossessed, stranger in his own land, who gets named just about every beast in the ark, the bestiary, called out his name so often it’s a wonder anybody remembers it and maybe nobody does.
