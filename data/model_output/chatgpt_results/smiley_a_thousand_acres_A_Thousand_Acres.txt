<name>him</name>	him	Jess	It was remarkable how my state of mind had evolved over the last five days. I could distinctly remember the strength I felt as I walked away from [MASK], ducked under the rosebushes and trotted toward my house. I’d wanted to put distance between us.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Harold	[MASK] grinned. “He called me, I didn’t call him.” “Did you know where to call him?” “The thing was, I wasn’t going to call him and he knew it.”
<name>partner</name>	partner	Ginny	This isn’t a question of right and wrong, it’s a question of what he wants to do.” “I don’t see that, [MASK], but I’ll think about it, okay? I’ll come along and hang around, and we’ll see, okay?
<name>his ex-girlfriend</name>	his ex-girlfriend	Harold	It was a complicated squash soup that we’d made together, and he didn’t get home till eight, and I was annoyed, but I didn’t think that much of it, until he started acting sheepish and guilty. Well, it turned out he’d been to see [MASK]!
<name>the farmer</name>	the farmer	Ty	There is always too much of everything at harvest. Starting about the fifteenth of September, and every day after that, [MASK] took the portable moisture tester out into the fields, hoping against hope that with good weather he could start harvesting early.
<name>Luce</name>	Luce	Rose	I thought instead of that cell dividing in the dark and then living rather than dying, subdividing, multiplying, growing, [MASK]’s real third child (“her only third child,” a voice whispered in my head), the one who would not be parted from her.
<name>Sarah</name>	Sarah	Rose	I was worried that [MASK] would get hurt, would count too much on someone who would have to leave her behind. Then he announced he was tired of the road, and even of music, that he wanted to settle down and learn how to farm, and they got married
<name>She</name>	She	Rose	I said, “What was that?” Our gazes locked. Finally, she said, “Oh, I don’t know. Nothing really.” I found myself a touch disconcerted, so I said, “[MASK] went to college.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Rose	[MASK] turned on the TV as if she were more interested in the progress of the storm than what we were going to do, or think, or be after this, but her hand was shaking so much she could hardly manipulate the dial. I turned back to the window.
<name>the deserter</name>	the deserter	Harold	Who the hell are you to tell me a goddamn thing, you deserter? This joker ain’t even got the guts to serve his country, then he comes sashaying around here—” At this point, the minister had managed to get behind [MASK] and grab him.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Rose	[MASK], on the other hand, looked invigorated. I said, “It must be still in your cellar, then.” “Everything else is. But that house has been boarded up since I moved across the road.” I felt a surprising flush of relief.
<name>my husband</name>	my husband	Ty	And the dog in me was one of those other, less alert but still excitable animals who couldn’t help joining in and barking with equal frenzy. I read the papers and put them on the dining-room table for [MASK], weighted down with his coffee cup.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Ty	“Well, I think one of them is that he’s afraid of his daughters.” ‘That’s a good one.” I folded the blanket at the end of the bed. I doubted that we would need it. [MASK] slipped under the sheet.
<name>the painting</name>	the painting	Ty	The other, the more you looked at it, the more it escaped you. Its very features seemed elusive, seemed to promise a meaning, or even a truth, that was more complex and interesting than anything you had ever before imagined. I kept staring at [MASK].
<name>her</name>	her	Ty	All the way through the dress rehearsal, her dancing was awkward and her voice pitched every line high at the end, as if she were asking a question no matter what she was saying. I dreaded opening night and was glad that I’d kept her project a secret even from [MASK].
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Pete	“Oh, sure.” Now we stood together in true awkwardness, [MASK] rolling stones in his hand and looking over the water, me not knowing what to do with my hands, looking at the distant white roof of my car.
<name>the enemy</name>	the enemy	Harold	Living and dying! I was her child! What ideal did she sacrifice me to? Patriotism? Keeping up appearances in the neighborhood? Peace with [MASK]? Maybe to you it looked like 1 just vanished, but I was out there, this ignorant farm kid!
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Roberta	“Let me see it.” “It’s in my wallet. I’ve got plenty. It’s okay.” I saw [MASK]’s feet go by my curtained booth, pause, turn, pause, proceed.
<name>Ohio</name>	Ohio	Johnston	She dressed to look good, and 1 dressed for obscurity. I knew I seemed hostile. I said, “There’s a kerosene heater in the bam. I could set that up.” “Some couple in [MASK] died from one of those last year.”
<name>Adrienne</name>	Adrienne	Mommy	It’s my besetting sin. I’m grabby and jealous and selfish and [MASK] said it would drive people away, so I’ve been good at hiding it.” I’m sure I spoke as bitterly as I felt. “You sound like you forgive yourself completely.”
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Rose	They understand that all [MASK] could bequeath them was her view of things. Her honesty has given them some confidence. They are also cautious, and I doubt they will ever throw that caution to the winds. They are closer and more protective of one another than they ever were as children.
<name>Draco</name>	Draco	Pete	I always imagined that [MASK] was well-intentioned, that even when he did lose control, he still hoped nothing bad would happen. I wanted time, too, not because I expected it to solve an iota of our problems, but because I would have done anything to put off the future.
<name>Dad</name>	Dad	Loren	He shouted, “Who told you to leave the sprayer in that field?” and then something unintelligible. [MASK] came around the comer of the house, and I realized I was standing and staring. I smiled, and he smiled sheepishly back at me.
<name>she</name>	she	Rose	It had been a long time since I’d realized what fun he was (when I mentioned this to [MASK], she said it had been a long time since he’d had fun or been fun, actually), but it was more than that, more a realization that he had certain powers.
<name>Murchison</name>	Murchison	Harold	When he saw me move, he bent down beside me and said, “Your father’s at [MASK]’s. They don’t know I’m here,” and that said everything I needed to know about secrecy, conspiracy, danger.
<name>Uncle Axel</name>	Uncle Axel	Rose	I stepped back. All at once I had a distinct memory of a time when [MASK] and I were nine and eleven, and we had kept him waiting after a school Halloween party that he hadn’t wanted us to go to in the first place.
<name>he</name>	he	Larry	I’m going to take your dad to the church supper on Sunday. And you kids are going to show up there and have a nice meal. Fact is, I think you should work this out. You got your side and [MASK]’s got his.
<name>whoever</name>	whoever	Rose	“And that, in most cases, once the transition has been made, and the older generation is taken care of, things can go back to normal for twenty years or so.” “God forbid,” said [MASK].
<name>Darry</name>	Darry	Rose	We haven’t done anything wrong except try our best with you.” [MASK] said, “It’s going to storm. Why don’t I take you home and we can talk about this in the morning?” “I don’t care about the storm.
<name>him</name>	him	Marv	He was careful not to look at us, full of his role as “expert witness.” But I realized right then that by watching [MASK], just by watching him, you could tell where the money was, and where it was going to go.
<name>Earl</name>	Earl	Ty	They reminded me of mushrooms that suddenly appear after a wet night, uncannily white and fully formed, miraculous but ominous. [MASK] got a lot of backslapping, and I could hear the words “hog operation” over and over like an incantation.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Rose	I said, “[MASK], don’t you think we should talk some more? What’s next?” “We’ll see.” “I’m afraid to see.” “What are you afraid of?”
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Ty	[MASK] drove smoothly and silently. The car breasted the gravel roads, seeming, like a moldboard plow, to roll the fields and the ditches to either side of us. I shook my head to get rid of the illusion, but I could not.
<name>Ma Joad</name>	Ma Joad	Harold	“A farm isn’t everything, [MASK].” “Well, it’s plenty, isn’t it? It’s more than one person is. One person don’t break a farm up that lots of people have sweated and starved to put together.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Caroline	When my father turned his head to look at [MASK], his movement was slow and startled, a big movement of the whole body, reminding me how bulky he was—well over six feet and two hundred thirty pounds.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ty	[MASK] was standing, watching them go. He took off his cap and wiped the sweat off his face with his sleeve, then he put the cap back on. He stood looking after them for a long time.
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	Harold—“but	People always act like they’re going to live forever when the price of land is up”—here he threw a glance at [MASK] if you get a heart attack or a stroke or something, then you got to sell off to pay the government.”
<name>Mrs. Dubose</name>	Mrs. Dubose	Rose	It frightened me, but it didn’t frighten [MASK]. She would stand back, her arms crossed over her chest, slowly shaking her head, saying, “You should hear yourself, you really should hear yourself.” Cool, dismissive, inviting punishment.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Ty	“How much did he spend on that?” asked [MASK]. “He said that wasn’t any of my business. I only know about the couch because I saw the salesman’s card on the kitchen table and I asked him about it.
<name>Raymond</name>	Raymond	Jess	[MASK] laughed and I laughed and for a moment everything seemed remote and not very important. I wondered if maybe that wasn’t the right way to look at things after all, stand- ing in the dump, smelling the wild roses, and taking the long perspective.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Jess	There weren’t any lightning bugs, yet, but I could see one or two cabbage moths pale and dim against the dark greenery around the porch. “This is nice,” said [MASK]. “This is exactly what I was looking for.”
<name>Stephanie</name>	Stephanie	Rose	“You get to take credit for that luck, legally, just like if your luck is bad and somebody does get hurt, you have to—” [MASK] planted herself in the center of the doorway to the living room, and fisted her hands on her hips.
<name>Blanche</name>	Blanche	Rose	He doesn’t say what he means.” “He says what he means. You two always read something into it, whatever it is. [MASK] does it more than you.” I put on a short cotton nightgown and buttoned one of the buttons.
<name>him</name>	him	Jess	My arms and legs, stiff and stalklike, thumped against the wheel well, the truck bed, poked [MASK] in the ribs, the back. My skin looked glaringly white, white like some underground sightless creature. When he leaned forward to untie his sneakers, I felt my cheeks.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Harold	As soon as I sat down my heart began to pound. Some people we didn’t know began to pull out chairs, then they saw [MASK] looking at them and they backed away. Though we were uncomfortable enough to trade a few uncertain smiles, we settled ourselves, addressed our plates.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Caroline	That, it seemed, would be one way to stop missing her. The cold beat against me in rhythmic blows. A headache pushed up from beneath the aspirin and swelled to fill my skull. I went back down the stairs. [MASK]’s face met mine as soon as I entered the kitchen.
<name>Hemingway</name>	Hemingway	Jess	“Listen to this,” said [MASK], and he told about confiding to an American woman in a Vancouver saloon that he was evading the draft. She asked him to order her another drink, and when he lifted his arm to hail the waitress, he felt her poke him in the side.
<name>George</name>	George	Marv	“Well, then, sit down or go out. You’re making me nervous standing there.” I poured myself a cup of coffee and sat down. He said to [MASK], “Something the matter with the food?” “It’s delicious.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Rose	I pushed them farther into the shade and spilled a little water over the dirt they were rooted in. I had been a little hard with him, maybe. On the other hand, my own mother had died when I was fourteen. [MASK] and I nursed her for two months, in the living room.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Ty	“Well, then, don’t tell me what to do.” “I wasn’t—” But she caught my eye and shut up, as if I had cast her a glance of some kind. [MASK] said, ‘These potatoes look great.”
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Harold	He took a sip of coffee and said, “I think I’m good at seeing wider perspectives, but mostly I’d like you to talk to me.” 1 allowed, “The church supper was embarrassing.” “Not everyone thought [MASK] was right to speak out like that.”
<name>acetone</name>	acetone	Raid	Arsenic is around, in the form of old rat poison. There were plenty of insecticides we used in the hog houses. There was kerosene and diesel fuel and paint thinner and [MASK]. There were aerosol degreasers and used motor oil.
<name>the husband</name>	the husband	Ty	Though we were uncomfortable enough to trade a few uncertain smiles, we settled ourselves, addressed our plates. I glanced at [MASK]’s face, at his plate, the wife habitually noticing what the husband was eating. He, too, had some of the carrot slaw.
<name>Flora</name>	Flora	Linda	She said, “Never.” [MASK] was just bom when I had my first miscarriage, and for a while, six months maybe, the sight of those two babies, whom I had loved and cared for with real interest and satisfaction, affected me like a poison.
<name>her husband</name>	her husband	Jess	We made pickles and canned tomatoes and I drove the girls places for her. I noticed her fleeting little smiles. We talked, in a way. She alluded to [MASK] only tactfully, and gave me little hugs from time to time, or compliments.
<name>The Joker</name>	The Joker	Ty	What will make me feel good now that I’m feelin’ so bad?’ He’s like a farmer, you see, only the big pieces of equipment he’s got access to are weapons, that’s the difference.” [MASK] was smiling.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Pete	For some reason, when a man’s figure stepped up to the edge of the water and threw a handful of stones into it (I could hear the plinkety-plunks even from that distance), I was not surprised by the fact that it was [MASK].
<name>John</name>	John	Ty	I got married to [MASK] when I was nineteen, and the fact was that even after seventeen years of marriage, I was still pleased to see him every time he appeared. I wasn’t the first in my high school class to go, nor the last.
<name>him</name> (Note: There is no proper name that fills in the [MASK] token in this passage. The answer is a pronoun.)	him (Note: There is no proper name that fills in the [MASK] token in this passage. The answer is a pronoun.)	Ty	I let my gaze travel over his face. I saw that its measure of hope—the feature by which I always used to recognize [MASK] as my husband—had given way to something more mysterious and remote. I said, “Did you agree with him?
<name>Rambo</name>	Rambo	Rose	He can hold out longer than I can. lesson of the whole Vietnam War! You said, ‘[MASK], every Vietnam vet you see is proof of how far they’re capable of going!’ You said that!” He said, “I know.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Ty	But that was one thing about [MASK]. He knew how to make up his mind, and to keep it made up. I jammed the clothes farther down among the strawberry hulls and the turkey giblets with my foot. There was a difference in me, too.
<name>the man</name>	the man	Mel	Twenty years before, a man could have paid them without thinking about it. Those times are sure to return again. They shake hands all around, and, a little warmed by the last coals in the kitchen range, [MASK] sets out for home.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Rose	But of course, it hadn’t been their bodies, it had been ours, or [MASK]’s, rather. But mine, too, if he entered my room, even if he just closed the windows, even if he only checked to see if I was asleep.
<name>her</name>	her	Rose	He told me that the resurgence of her cancer was already far advanced. The second radical mastectomy had been performed in July, during the summer lull in farm work. Radiation and chemotherapy into August had bought [MASK] another harvest. Now the harvest was over.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Ty	I said, “Will you be back after the Fourth, then?” “Naw. I was just telling [MASK], here, we’ve got to wait at least four days, so I’m giving everybody a couple of days off.”
<name>Mrs. Watson</name>	Mrs. Watson	Rose	The orderly progress of cooking something put me in the usual serene mood. I was finished and cleaned up by two. At five-thirty, I carried a box of twelve full jars down the road to [MASK]’s. It was hot and dusty.
<name>Miss Rachel</name>	Miss Rachel	Harold	I was just teasing you.” He smiled. I looked around. The rosebushes were nearly as high as my head and hid the dump from the view of my house, though you could see [MASK]’s house and bam through the trees.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Mommy	“They want to make it.” She shrugged and finished her Jell-O cubes. Finally, she said, “I’m all right with them. I didn’t just leave everything unsaid with them the way [MASK] did with us. I wasn’t enigmatic, either.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Ginny	“Say the words, [MASK]! If he hadn’t fucked us and beat us we would think differently, right?” “Well, yeah.” “But he did fuck us and he did beat us. He beat us more than he fucked us.
<name>him</name>	him	Caroline	I said to [MASK], “Well, we asked him at Sunday dinner whether he’d been down there, and he wouldn’t tell us. He’s as stubborn and close-mouthed as always. What your receptionist said just doesn’t seem to fit, as far as I’m concerned.”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Rose	[MASK], take your turn. I’ve heard enough about this goddamned wedding to last me the rest of my life.” He was winning. He had all the green properties and Boardwalk, plus all the railroads. The dice were working for him, and we kept landing on his properties.
<name>Heather</name>	Heather	Pam	She said, “[MASK] has a history report due tomorrow, but 1 can help you.” “You don’t have homework?” “I did my geometry in study hall. I have to read some chapters in a book.” “What book?”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Buddha	We had carrot bread and oatmeal from their own oats for breakfast, and carrot juice, too, and he had twenty different apple varieties in his orchard. 1 mean it was like meeting [MASK]. They were so happy! I wish you’d come.”
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Harold	An hour later I received [MASK], though the sight of him hopping, almost dancing, from his truck to my back door, the sight of his glee, incensed me. “You got a problem, girlie,” he exclaimed as soon as he saw me.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Ty	There was a picture of her and their four children in a silver frame on his desk. [MASK] had taken the papers to him and asked him to handle them for us. Late in July, he called and asked the four of us to come for a consultation.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Rose	I’m thirty-seven. It shits, doesn’t it?” I said, “It’s hard to bear.” At the moment it seemed nearly impossible to bear. I exclaimed, “Oh, [MASK].” She sniffed, dismissing this upsurge.
<name>Darry</name>	Darry	Mommy	At any rate, he ran from the house to the truck. [MASK] was behind him, at the door, holding it open and shouting something, and then we were careening across fields and I was huddled down, bouncing in the corner of the box.
<name>Danny</name>	Danny	Caroline	He turned to look at the judge. “You’re a judge. I’ll swear to that. I swear that maybe they killed her and buried her.” [MASK] said, “I’m right here with you.
<name>Pennywise</name>	Pennywise	Grandpa	I said, “Does [MASK] scare you?” “Sort of.” “You should have seen what it was like when we were kids. We had all sorts of hiding places, but if he called our names, we had to answer within ten seconds.
<name>Margot</name>	Margot	Rose	“And then, that Christmas, we moved into separate rooms. He said it was time we had separate rooms.” It was true that we had had separate rooms. Mine had been yellow, our old room, and [MASK]’s pink, the former guest room.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Caroline	31 When [MASK] was about fourteen and I was twenty-two, already married for almost three years, she came over after supper one evening, and said that she’d been given the lead in the high school play, over all the other girls.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Mary	Your own endurance might be a pleasant fiction allowed you by others who’ve really faced the facts. The eerie feeling this thought gave me made me shiver in the hot wind. [MASK] said, “We might not see you before we leave.
<name>my lawyer</name>	my lawyer	Ty	The judge banged his gavel, my face flushed hot, and my throat seared. I whispered to [MASK], “But it was.” He shushed me. 1 felt icy shakes descend in waves through my body. The hearing went forward as if 1 hadn’t spoken.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Harold	And then [MASK] lets drop some detail, about money, or bushels per acre, that shows that in spite of his foolishness, he outdid everybody. That he’s such a good farmer that he has a whole lot more leeway than the average guy.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Linda	and [MASK] was asleep when I got home. She had dropped off over her economics text. I marked her place and set it on the floor, then turned out her bedside light and pulled the comforter over her shoulders.
<name>presumably</name> (Note: There is no proper name that fits in this context. The word "presumably" is the best guess based on the context.)	presumably (Note: There is no proper name that fits in this context. The word "presumably" is the best guess based on the context.)	Ginny	He smiled. “But the exceptions are extremely rare. I know I’m a conservative on this score, [MASK], and that hasn’t always been to my advantage. But in all my years in the ministry, I’ve only seen one divorce I agreed with.
<name>Aunt Alexandra</name>	Aunt Alexandra	Rose	We dressed in our nicest casual clothes, baked our noodle-hamburger casserole and our brownies, and went together, the two families. [MASK] made us stand up straight so she could survey us before we got in the car. “Respectable to the core,” she declared.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Caroline	All he has to do is turn up mysteriously in [MASK]’s office, and she’s on the phone, asking questions. Most of the time, I forget the transfer even took place.” “He doesn’t.” “Well, then, he should untransfer it.
<name>The waitress</name>	The waitress	Ty	I ordered a Coke. [MASK] asked for another cup of coffee. We sat by the window, fronting the Perkins lot across the street. There were no pickups at all in the lot. I said, “What are you driving?” “That Chevy.”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Ginny	Kindness wasn’t freely given with him, [MASK], it was a way to get where he wanted to go.” “I guess we differ.” “The difference is that I loved him without caring whether he was good.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ty	I shook my head to get rid of the illusion, but I could not. It came of driving so low to the ground. [MASK] rolled down his window an inch or two and the wind carried fear right into my face.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Mommy	I wonder about whether they were happy. Whether she liked him. Or he liked her. Though everybody liked [MASK]. I think different things.” She cleared her throat, and 1 took this as my cue to fall silent.
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Pammy	Your grandfather always thought his chair facing the window and a stack of magazines within reach was a good enough way to decorate.” They sat together on the couch. They smiled at my remark. [MASK] reached for a remote control, then turned off the television.
<name>Sorry</name>	Sorry	Rose	And I’ve kept my eyes peeled. And we were in our teens.” “It didn’t happen to me. [MASK].” She shrugged a little. I spoke angrily all of a sudden, surprising myself, “I don’t know what to say!
<name>Marlene</name>	Marlene	Interfering	[MASK]. Asking for something, though I didn’t know what. And then her office didn’t like her to get personal calls. The phones were monitored because clients were billed for telephone consultations. I pushed the phone button down again, then put the receiver on the cradle.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Harold	Two weeks ago, [MASK] was saying things like, ‘Who said you should spray those beans?’ Now it’s, ‘You aren’t putting anything over on me! I know what you’re up to.’ ” “How weird.”
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Mommy	First their wives collapse under the strain, then they take it out on their children for as long as they can, then they just reach the end of their rope. I used to fantasize that [MASK] had escaped and taken an assumed name, and someday she would be back for us.
<name>Darry</name>	Darry	Harold	“Hmm.” I must have sounded preoccupied. She looked at me sharply as I turned from the counter, and said, “Those Clark boys should know that [MASK]’s all talk. They shouldn’t be counting any chickens.
<name>Janine</name>	Janine	Ginny	You should see her. Frankly, she’s your dad all over.” I felt my face get hot. He said, “I know what she says, [MASK], about your dad. She told me. She’s told everybody by now.”
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Dawson	“Yeah,” said the one. “Maybe I’ll get time to take a shower.” “You are getting pretty ripe, [MASK]. Phew!” shouted one of the others as they rumbled out. “Thanks for the supper, ma’am.
