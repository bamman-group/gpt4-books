<name>Holly</name>	Holly	Frederick	The street is empty, the windows dead, the electric signs switched off. Innumerable shops, millions sleeping in beds around them, and yet where are they all? As they reach [MASK]’s block, a woman in a dress, leaning against a building, bends over and vomits on the sidewalk.
<name>The Professor</name>	The Professor	Hublin	Then he lifts his basket into his lap. He points to the chair. His voice is gentle. “Sit, Professor. You will be more comfortable.” [MASK] does not sit. Two o’clock out in the city, and bells toll in a hundred churches.
<name>Casey</name>	Casey	Werner	[MASK] crosses the square and tunes the second transceiver himself. When they speak again, he triangulates and plugs the numbers into the equation, then looks up and sees with his naked eyes what looks very much like a wire antenna trailing down the side of an apartment house flanking the square.
<name>stadium</name>	stadium	Volkheimers	No one stops him. No shells come whistling in. Sometimes the eye of a hurricane is the safest place to be. What They Have When is it day and when night? Time seems better measured by flashes: [MASK] field light flicks off, flicks on.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Werner	Then we heard about you. Worth a try, right? She”—he nods at the woman—“is desperate to hear her program. News bulletins too, of course.” He says this in such a way that [MASK] understands the woman does not really wish to listen to news bulletins.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Volkheimer	Love? Nothing will be healed in this kitchen. Some griefs can never be put right. [MASK] pushes back from the table. “It was not my intention to upset you.” He hovers, dwarfing them.
<name>Wilfred Owen</name>	Wilfred Owen	Etienne	Out here the prisoners see the shells smash into the city before they hear them. During the last war, [MASK] knew artillerymen who could peer through field glasses and discern their shells’ damage by the colors thrown skyward. Gray was stone. Brown was soil.
<name>Gene</name>	Gene	Static	Clouds of gnats buzzing. The march of jack-boots and the full-throated shouts of boys. [MASK], then the guns. But was it decent to leave him out there like that? Even after he was dead? What you could be.
<name>Mademoiselle</name>	Mademoiselle	Marie	“Madame?” “Yes, [MASK].” “What is a pseudonym?” “It is a fake name, an alternate name.” “If I were to have one, what sort of name could I choose?”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Cat	Someone could have found out about the bread, the numbers, the transmitter. Bakery in flames. He hurries downstairs and peers out the kitchen door into the alley. [MASK] sleeping. Trapezoid of sunlight on the east-facing wall. This is all his fault.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Etienne	My angel is leaving, so if I can get this to you, I will. I do not worry about you because I know you are very smart and keeping yourself safe. I am safe too so you should not worry. Thank [MASK] for reading this to you.
<name>Dragon</name>	Dragon	Frederick	[MASK] whispers: “Do you know about them? They’re really rare. Big as gliders. This one was probably a young male looking for new territory. He was in one of the poplar trees beside the parade ground.”
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Frederick	She embraces her son and holds him back with straight arms while she runs a fingertip over a mostly healed cut along his forehead. [MASK] looks off over her shoulder with a trace of panic on his face. Is he afraid that she’ll see he was looking at the forbidden book?
<name>Albert</name>	Albert	Volkheimer	Every night. Even Sundays.” “Yes, sir.” “Start tomorrow.” “Yes, sir.” “[MASK] here will keep an eye out for you. Take these biscuits.” The professor produces a tin with a bow on it.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Mademoiselle	“[MASK], you made me drop my newspaper. I am just a lowly sergeant major here to ask a question. One simple question and then I will leave.” The tide murmurs; the snails teem. Is the ironwork too narrow for him to squeeze through?
<name>him</name>	him	Fredde	Male 1. Female 2. Two birds on a stalk of Indian turnip. She peers back into the envelope for a note, an explanation, but finds none. The day she bought that book for [MASK]: the bookseller took so long to wrap it.
<name>Casey</name>	Casey	Werner	Then, from somewhere deep inside the earpiece, a stream of consonants issues forth. [MASK]’s heart pauses; the voice seems to echo in the architecture of his head. The sound fades as quickly as it came. He shifts the pin a quarter inch.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Werner	You have your studies to think of.” [MASK] clenches his eyes. A memory of his attic bedroom swamps him: clicking of mouse feet in the walls, sleet tapping the window. The ceiling so sloped he could stand only in the spot closest to the door.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Madame	house?—now [MASK]’s voice is calling, “Mademoiselle,” and she is taken by the hand, led back into the room in which she woke, and seated on the edge of the bed. “Do you need to use the toilet?
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Werner	In the other room the woman twists the dial, and voices sermonize from the speaker. She listens awhile, then applauds, kneeling there in her bare feet. The stern faces in the tintypes stare down. [MASK] eats one piece of cake, then another, then takes a third.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Etienne	At ten a.m. her father starts wheeling loads to the rue de Chartres, one trip, two trips, three, and when he comes back and loads the dolly with the last radio, [MASK] still has not appeared.
<name>August</name>	August	Etienne	Then she feels her way back to the gate and locks it behind her. That winter the electricity is out more than it is on; [MASK] links a pair of marine batteries to the transmitter so that he can broadcast when the power is off.
<name>Thor</name>	Thor	Volkheimer	He raises a palm to block it. [MASK] approaches; his big solicitous face presses close. Broad, familiar, deep-sunk eyes beneath the helmet. High cheekbones and long nose, flared at the tip like the knobs at the bottom of a femur.
<name>Gwen</name>	Gwen	Werner	A great gust of static shears past. The voice is like something from a long-ago dream. A half dozen more words flutter through [MASK] in that Breton accent: Next broadcast Thursday 2300. Fifty-six seventy-two something. . .
<name>Zero</name>	Zero	Marie	“Can’t you feel how lightweight we are, [MASK]? You can move by hardly twitching a muscle!” He sets her in his wheeled desk chair and pants as he whirls her in circles until she cannot laugh anymore for the pain of it.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Werner	“A girl,” [MASK] says in French, “did you see—?” but the interpreter only smirks and says something to the clerk in English, as though every German soldier he has interviewed has asked about a girl.
<name>Uncle Enos</name>	Uncle Enos	Volkheimer	They reach the edge of a frozen pond, where a pine grows as tall as a cathedral. His greatgrandfather goes to his knees like a penitent, fits the saw into a groove in the bark, and begins to cut. [MASK] stands.
<name>Abbe</name>	Abbe	Uncle	He sighs. “You are not safe, and I am here to help.” “[MASK] says our cellar is safe. He says if it has lasted for five hundred years, it will last a few more nights.” The perfumer clears his throat.
<name>him</name>	him	Werner	Somewhere above him, the voice of a young man starts speaking in French about coal. Out For a split second, the space around [MASK] tears in half, as though the last molecules of oxygen have been ripped out of it.
<name>Dr. Mimi A. R. Koehl</name>	Dr. Mimi A. R. Koehl	Etienne	At her feet, the snails go about their work: chewing, scavenging, sleeping. Their mouths, [MASK] has taught her, contain something like thirty teeth per row, eighty rows of teeth, two and a half thousand teeth per snail, grazing, scratching, rasping.
<name>Peter</name>	Peter	Etienne	All morning [MASK] crawls along the attic floor with cables and pliers and tools her fingers do not understand, weaving himself into the center of what she imagines as an intricate electronic net. He murmurs to himself; he fetches thick booklets or electrical components from various rooms on the lower stories.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Werner	The boy sits up. Both of his forearms are bent at nauseating angles. He blinks at them curiously for a moment, as if scanning his memory for a clue that might explain how he got there. Then he starts to scream. [MASK] looks away.
<name>Desdemona</name>	Desdemona	Werner	For miles, out the open door, [MASK] sees no sign of humans save the occasional railcar capsized beside the tracks, twisted and scarred by some kind of explosion. Soldiers clamber on and off, lean, pale, each carrying a pack, rifle, and steel helmet.
<name>be</name>	be	Werner	But the fastest boys are greyhounds, harvested from all over the nation for their speed and eagerness to obey, and they seem to [MASK] to be running more fervently, more conclusively, than they have before. They are impatient to find out what will happen if someone is caught.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Etienne	The latrine is apocalyptic. Food comes irregularly, carried out from the citadel by the guardian’s wife across the quarter mile of rocks at low tide while shells explode in the city behind her. There’s never enough. [MASK] diverts himself with fantasies of escape.
<name>Klaus</name>	Klaus	Werner	Then they hear his accent, notice the German tunic beneath the antique shirt, and decide they have a spy, a fabulous catch. Then they realize [MASK]’s youth. They hand him off to an American clerk in a requisitioned hotel transformed into a disarmament center.
<name>Miller</name>	Miller	Hauptmann	“I have him, sir.” [MASK] starts smiling in earnest. The dogs caper and sneeze with excitement. From his coat he produces a grease pencil. “Just do it on the radio. Teams won’t always have paper, not in the field.”
<name>Will</name>	Will	Werner	“Maybe it’d be better if we aren’t friends anymore, [MASK].” Too loud, dangerously loud. “I know it’s a liability, walking with me, eating with me, always folding my clothes and shining my boots and tutoring me.
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Madame	There’s the dining room, the foyer, a hutch full of antique dishes in the hall that tremble whenever anyone walks past, and a door off the kitchen that leads to [MASK]’s room: a bed, a sink, a chamber pot.
<name>The first boy</name>	The first boy	Frederick	“I couldn’t see him,” he whispers, “but I heard him perfectly.” “Shut your face!” says a second boy. “You’ll get us thrashed.” [MASK] says nothing more.
<name>Hertz</name>	Hertz	Werner	Hertzs theories are interesting but what he loves most is building things, working with his hands, connecting his fingers to the engine of his mind. [MASK] repairs a neighbor’s sewing machine, the Children’s House grandfather clock.
<name>David</name>	David	John	The first was a visiting scientist who never returned, and the second was a Canadian named [MASK] who scattered things—ties, coins, socks, breath mints—around any room he entered. They met in graduate school; he flitted from lab to lab with a prodigious curiosity but little perseverance.
<name>Marie-Laure</name>	Marie-Laure	Jutta	“We all grew up before we were grown up. Did he—?” [MASK] says, “He died.” Of course. In the stories after the war, all the resistance heroes were dashing, sinewy types who could construct machine guns from paper clips.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Volkheimer	He’d ignite their fuses just to light this place up, just to see again. [MASK] has taken to switching on his field light and focusing its frail beam into the far corner, where eight or nine white plaster heads stand on two shelves, several toppled onto their sides.
<name>pliers</name>	pliers	Werner	Gently now. It will be in here somewhere. It is just like the locksmith to repeat himself. The model—it will be inside the model. Making the Radio One end of wire [MASK] crimps around a shorn pipe standing diagonally up from the floor.
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Werner	He raises two huge fingers to his forehead, pushes his helmet back, and [MASK] can see that it is not ink. “Set the house afire,” he says. “Quickly. Don’t waste diesel.”
<name>John James Audubon</name>	John James Audubon	Frederick	Then he’d shoot it and prop it up with wires and sticks and paint it. Probably knew more than any birder before or since. He’d eat most of the birds after he painted them. Can you imagine?” [MASK]’s voice trembles with ardency.
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Volkheimer	[MASK] turns his bleeding palms up as though to catch the air, to let it seep into his skin like rainwater. Only two walls of the hotel stand, joined at the corner, bits of plaster attached to the inner wall. Beyond it, houses display their interiors to the night.
<name>John Keating</name>	John Keating	Frederick	Some boys talk in whispers, some sit alone, some gulp food as if they have not eaten in days. Through three arched windows, dawn sends a sheaf of hallowed golden rays. [MASK] flutters his fingers and asks, “Do you like birds?”
<name>Who</name>	Who	Etienne	What do they hope to find? She imagines the radio equipment high above her: microphone, transceiver, all those dials and switches and cables. [MASK] says, “You may.” They go into every room. Third floor fourth fifth.
<name>The reader</name>	The reader	Frederick	Two white falcons swoop over each other, beaks open. A bloodred flamingo holds its black-tipped beak over stagnant water. Resplendent geese stand on a headland and peer into a heavy sky. [MASK] turns the pages with both hands. Pipiry flycatcher. Buff breasted merganser.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Volkheimer	Sometimes, in the slow heat of summer, long before dawn, [MASK] paces in the harsh dazzle of the billboard lights and feels his loneliness on him like a disease. He sees tall ranks of firs swaying in a storm, hears their heartwood groan.
<name>Orpheus</name>	Orpheus	Veronika	The music stops, and [MASK] vanishes. He sits up. The model at the foot of the bed bleeds away and is a long time restoring itself. Somewhere above him, the voice of a young man starts speaking in French about coal.
<name>Martine</name>	Martine	Madame	“You are thinking of your father,” she finally says. “You have to believe your father will return.” “Don’t you ever get tired of believing, [MASK]? Don’t you ever want proof?”
<name>Ornithologist</name>	Ornithologist	Frederick	and I said, You’re going to catch hell and he looked down at his clothes like he’d never seen them before! [MASK] knows all the birds just by hearing them. Above the lake we heard skylarks and lapwings and plovers and a harrier hen and probably ten others
<name>Will</name>	Will	Werner	This one was probably a young male looking for new territory. He was in one of the poplar trees beside the parade ground.” “Oh,” says [MASK]. Greek letters move across the undersides of his eyelids: isosceles triangles, betas, sine curves.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Marie	“I won’t be long, [MASK]. A week. Ten days at most.” “When?” “Tomorrow. Before you wake.” She leans over her knees. Her back is long and white and split by the knobs of her vertebrae.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Etienne	Slip out of the house and hurl it into the sea. [MASK] climbs the ladder to the attic. She can hear him cross the floorboards above her and turn on the transmitter. She puts the stone in her pocket and picks up the model house and crosses the hall.
<name>Hemingway</name>	Hemingway	Werner	[MASK] imagines the American artillerymen: spotters with scopes balanced on rocks or tank treads or hotel railings; firing officers computing wind speed, barrel elevation, air temperature; radiomen with telephone receivers pressed to their ears, calling in targets. Right three degrees, repeat range.
<name>Daniel</name>	Daniel	Berlin	The afternoon is bright enough, but [MASK] seems not to want to accept the sunlight, as though its buildings have become gloomier and dirtier and more splotchy in the months since he last visited. Though perhaps what has changed are the eyes that see it.
<name>He</name>	He	Michel	Beneath her fingernails, the frost makes billions of tiny diadems and coronas on the slats of the bench, a lattice of dumbfounding complexity. [MASK] presses against her side and becomes very quiet. Only his hands are moving. Little clicks rising, buttons being pressed.
<name>Bees</name>	Bees	Bees	He heard his sister inhale. Then, as though some retaining cord had reached its limit, something yanked him back into the cellar beneath the Hotel of [MASK]. The floor has stopped shaking, but the sound has not diminished. He clamps his palm to his right ear.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Werner	[MASK]’s body seems to have gone weightless under his blanket, and beyond the flapping tent doors, the trees dance and the clouds keep up their huge billowing march, and he swings first one leg and then the other off the edge of the bed.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Werner	All these flats?” “That’s the window,” says [MASK]. They go in. He does not hear any shots. Five minutes later, they call him up into a fifth-floor flat wallpapered with a dizzying floral print.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Rodel	In some other context, he might be encouraging a reluctant boy to step into cold water. “Do him some good.” [MASK] looks down at the hose: black, three feet long, stiff in the cold.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Jutta	[MASK] hears about boys, sixteen- and seventeen-year-olds, terrified, homesick, with trembling eyes, who show up on the doorsteps of their mothers only to be hauled howling out of attics two days later and shot in the street as deserters.
<name>Manny</name>	Manny	Etienne	They go slowly; maybe it’s dark. Could it already be night? Four or five or six or a million heartbeats roll by. She has her cane, [MASK]’s coat, the two cans, the knife, the brick. Model house in her dress pocket.
<name>Schnee</name>	Schnee	Werner	To assess his hair color, the man snips a lock of hair from [MASK]’s head and compares it to thirty or so other locks clipped to a board, arrayed darkest to lightest. “Schnee," the man mutters, and makes a notation. Snow.
<name>he</name>	he	Werner	Tiny snow crystals sift down through the moonlight. Soon the school and its outbuildings look like toys on the white plain below. The moon slips lower, a half-lidded eye, and the dogs stick close to their master, mouths steaming, and [MASK] sweats.
<name>the subject</name>	the subject	Werner	Her eyes said, You are betraying me, but wasn’t he protecting her? On the second morning, there are raciological exams. They require little of [MASK] except to raise his arms or keep from blinking while an inspector shines a penlight into the tunnels of his pupils.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Werner	He is tipsy, animated, almost pratding. Never has [MASK] seen him like this. “It’s the instant when one thing is about to become something else. Day to night, caterpillar to butterfly. Fawn to doe. Experiment to result. Boy to man.”
<name>The Conductor</name>	The Conductor	Etienne	“Oh, it’s a long journey this time,” [MASK] will say in an entirely new voice, smooth, velvety, a conductors drawl. “That’s the Atlantic Ocean far below, it’s shining under the moonlight, can you smell it?
<name>he</name>	he	Etienne	She will wait. At any moment [MASK] could be making his way toward her, fighting with his last breath to reach her. Or he is crouched somewhere, cradling his head. Seeing demons. Or he is dead.
<name>Boyle</name>	Boyle	Volkheimer	[MASK]’s technique, apparently, is this: he crouches beneath the buckled ceiling, panting, holding a piece of twisted rebar in one hand. He switches on his flashlight and scans the packed stairwell for anything he might drag out of it. Memorizing positions.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Werner	He raises a pair of trousers against the light and seems disappointed that they are not remotely his size. After he closes the bag, he throws it over his shoulder; whether to keep or merely carry it, [MASK] cannot guess.
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Volkheimer	He is fifty-one years old. April rain falls slantwise through the billboards spotlights and [MASK]’s television flickers blue and he ducks habitually as he passes through the doorway between his kitchen and the main room. No children, no pets, no houseplants, few books on the shelves.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Henri	We had a dream together, [MASK] and I, to make recordings and sell them. He had the voice and I had the brains and back then everyone wanted gramophones. And hardly anyone was making programs for children.
<name>Eleven</name>	Eleven	Marie	March the dead in a single-file line, and for eleven days and eleven nights, they’d walk past our door. This is not rearranging street signs, what we’re doing, [MASK]. This is not misplacing a letter at the post office.
<name>LeBeau</name>	LeBeau	Levitte	Or [MASK] might have walked her right out of the city while she carried it in her ratty knapsack; or the old man could have jammed it up his rectum and is just now shitting it out, twenty million francs in a pile of feces.
<name>Her</name>	Her	Werner	Sometimes she looks at the eyes of her older colleagues and wonders what they did when the electricity was out, when there were no candles, when the rain came through the ceiling. What they saw. Only rarely does she loosen the seals enough to allow herself to think of [MASK].
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Etienne	The first policeman says, “You told the museum he has managed to smuggle out two letters?” The second: “May we see them?” Off goes [MASK], content to believe that someone is on the job.
<name>Godot</name>	Godot	Madame	It doesn’t appear that [MASK] will be back tonight.” Neither of them moves. He reads another page. They have been kept for years in pill boxes, and yet on subjecting them to moisture, have crawled about appearing as well as ever. . .
<name>Werner</name>	Werner	Bernd	[MASK] twists his face away, panic in his eyes, and tries to examine his leg. The flashlight switches off and the darkness rushes back. In Werners duffel, he has his childhood notebook, his blanket, and dry socks. Three rations.
<name>the enemy</name>	the enemy	Americans	Any moment they will be seen, by either [MASK] or his own army, and made to do something. Work, join, confess, die. From somewhere comes the sound of fire: the sound of dried roses being crumbled in a fist.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Werner	[MASK] counts twenty-six others in his age group. All but two are taller than he is. All but three are blond. None of them wear eyeglasses. The boys spend that entire first morning in their new white outfits, filling out questionnaires on clipboards.
<name>John</name>	John	Werner	“Do you know about hooded crows?” [MASK] shakes his head. “Hooded crows are smarter than most mammals. Even monkeys. I’ve seen them put nuts they can’t crack in the road and wait for cars to run over them to get at the kernel.
<name>Amir</name>	Amir	Werner	The three huge wooden beams have cracked, but none has given way entirely. Between them the stucco is spiderwebbed, and pipes poke through in two places. The light veers behind him and illuminates the capsized workbench, the crushed case of their radio. Finally it finds [MASK].
<name>Natasha</name>	Natasha	mademoiselle	A boy in pants meant for a younger child follows, beret thrown back on his head, some kind of shiny jacket on. “There are civilians leaving, [MASK]. Shall I call to them?” “I need only a moment.”
<name>Truong</name>	Truong	Werner	Cold fog hangs in the budding trees, and [MASK] sits in the back of the truck and shivers. The place smells to him of carnage. For five days he hears nothing on his transceiver but anthems and recorded propaganda and broadcasts from beleaguered colonels requesting supplies, gasoline, men.
<name>probably</name> (Note: There is no clear proper name in this sentence, so this is a guess based on the context.)	probably (Note: There is no clear proper name in this sentence, so this is a guess based on the context.)	Marie	“It will be cooler on the train, [MASK]. The director has arranged tickets for us.” “Can we go in?” “The gates are locked.” The crowd gives off a nauseating tension.
<name>birds</name>	birds	Paris	No one else here: too cold or too early or both. She listens to the wind sift through the filigree of the crown of the gazebo, and the walls of the maze hold steady around them, [MASK] murmuring below, the drowsy purr of a Saturday morning.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Jutta	Three times by helping her out of the city. “No,” she says. “It was not,” says [MASK], reaching the limits of her French, “very easy to be good then.” “I spent a day with him.
<name>he</name>	he	Werner	Are they wearing uniforms? Many sit with their backs against the sacks at the front of the car: they look like scarecrows shipping west to be staked in some terrible garden. Some of the prisoners, [MASK] sees, are sleeping.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Werner	Fight bravely and die laughing. Schoolwork, chores, exercise. [MASK] stays up late listening to his radio or driving himself through the complicated math he copied out of The Principles of Mechanics before it was confiscated. He yawns at meals, is short-tempered with the younger children.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Gunners	She says, “Come and get me.” Beneath the stars over the city, everything sleeps. [MASK] sleep, nuns in a crypt beneath the cathedral sleep, children in old corsairs’ cellars sleep in the laps of sleeping mothers.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Frederick	From the hall come the clicking boot heels of the bunk master. [MASK] tips back onto his bunk. “I couldn’t see him,” he whispers, “but I heard him perfectly.” “Shut your face!” says a second boy.
<name>Marie-Laure</name>	Marie-Laure	Werner	She approaches [MASK] for a second time, her lips working softly, counting to herself— deux trois quatre—coming so close he can count the freckles on her nose, smell the loaf of bread in her knapsack.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Werners	A young Canadian in a medics helmet shines a penlight into [MASK] eyes and loads him into a truck, and he is driven some distance and set in a tent full of dying men. A nurse puts fluid into his arm. Spoons a solution into his mouth.
<name>Old Man</name>	Old Man	Bernd	A dozen people watch. Sentries, a handful of townspeople. Many with hands over their mouths. “Tread carefully, boy!” [MASK] is yelling. “There are mines! Didn’t you read the signs?”
<name>the</name>	the	Volkheimers	But to use a grenade down here, in such close quarters, beneath rubble presumably littered with live 88-millimeter shells, would be suicide. Then there’s the rifle: [MASK] bolt-action Karabiner 98K, loaded with five rounds.
