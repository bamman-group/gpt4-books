<name>Chet</name>	Chet	Compton	—I been watching him twenty minutes, more, man. Are you... ? This phone just rang and I— —He can see him! [MASK] slaps his hands against the desk, takes out his pocket protector, and flings it across the room.
<name>Vogue</name>	Vogue	Vogue	Art dealers tried to doorstep us. [MASK] profiled him. Their photographer had him dress in nothing but a long strategic scarf. We lapped up the praise, but if you stand in the same river for too long, even the banks will trickle past you.
<name>Salvatore</name>	Salvatore	Harry	There’s probably twelve, thirteen counts against him. —All the more reason. He could be my sous chef. He could prepare the steamers. Strip the lentils. Dive into the soup from high above. [MASK] pulled deeply on a cigar and blew the smoke to the ceiling.
<name>MacMurrough</name>	MacMurrough	Compton	In the middle of the wire? —Near the edge. —How near? —Not too near. Near enough. —Like what? Five yards? Ten yards? Is he steady? —Steady as shit! Who wants to know? What’s your name? —[MASK].
<name>Bushe</name>	Bushe	Solomon	The correct elevator. —Of course, ma’am. —Thank you. She leans her head against the cool of the wall. She shouldn’t have said anything at all about a correct or incorrect elevator. A bushe, [MASK] would have said.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Lara	Not our fault. Lighten up. And keep your fucking voice down, [MASK], in here, for crying out loud. He reached across and took my hand, his eyes narrow and intent: Not our fault, not our fault, not our fault.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Corrigan	“Under the statute that I’ll kick your ass if you don’t.” “All I want is an answer.” “The answer’s seven,” the female cop said, staring [MASK] down. “The answer’s always seven. Get it?”
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Solomon	it was as if she could travel through the electricity to see him. She could look at any electronic thing—television, radio, [MASK]’s shaver— and could find herself there, journeying along the raw voltage. Most of all it was the fridge.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Tom	She feels as if she has been nailed to the floor, but one of the nephews strides across the room. He has something of the petulant college boy about him, chubby face, a white shirt, a blue blazer, a red handkerchief in the breast pocket. —[MASK], he says.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Blaine	[MASK] took out the paintings from the backseat, propped them against the side of the hut, pulled open the huge wooden doors where we kept the Pontiac. He parked the car and locked the hut with a padlock and then swept the car tracks with a broom.
<name>Leopold</name>	Leopold	Janet	I should have just gone along the water. But I’m running, running. That’s my boy up there and he’s come to say hello. Everyone silent, even [MASK]. —I kept darting around comers, thinking I’d get a better view.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Claire	That he was vulgar somehow? Something about ashes? Or fashion? Or wires? —What is it, [MASK]? —I’m just thinking about that poor man, she says. She wants to kick herself for saying it, for bringing him up again.
<name>Chitra</name>	Chitra	Corrigan	I found a gig as a telemarketer but I needed a dedicated phone line in [MASK]’s apartment, and it was impossible to get a technician to visit the housing complex: this was not the America I had expected.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Joshua	[MASK] never smoked. Maybe on his way to heaven he asked for one. Here’s my thumb and here’s my leg and here’s my throat and here’s my heart and here’s one lung and, hey, let’s bring them all together for a final Lucky Strike.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Blaine	It had been a while since I had done anything with charcoal. Things took shape on the page. I recalled that, when we got married, [MASK] had raised a glass in front of our guests and said with a grin: ’Til life do us part.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Claire	[MASK] settles on the arm of the sofa again. No matter that she didn’t take care of the flowers. No matter that there’s no water reboiling. No matter that there’s no vase in her hands. She leans forward with the rest of them.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Claire	“So he pleaded guilty and I charged him a penny per floor.” “I see.” “Penny per floor, [MASK]. I charged him a dollar ten. One hundred and ten stories! Get it?
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Corrigan	He laid the planks parallel to each other and guided the chairs up. The wood lifted in the air with the weight of the wheelchairs, and for a moment they looked like they were bound for the sky. [MASK] pushed them forward and the planks slapped back down.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Joshua	Enough chairs? How could she have made such a mistake? Should she bring out the beanbag chair from [MASK]’s room? Put it on the floor so that her body can spread itself out in his old impression? This walking man, she can’t shake him.
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Blaine	Paintings that nobody wanted. Still, we had carefully arranged them so they wouldn’t get scratched. We had even placed bits of styrofoam between them to keep them from rubbing one another. If only we had been so careful with ourselves. [MASK] was thirty-two.
<name>She</name>	She	Melvyn’ll	[MASK] be down there, paralyzed, and then he’ll put them in the wrong one. The elevator there to your right, ladies. In you go. She feels a flush of shame to her cheeks. But she used the word dining, didn’t she?
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Jose	Check this shit out. —Huh? —You know, kneeling. —He’s what? —He's sitting now, man. —What d’you mean he’s sitting? —He’s sitting on the wire. This guy is sick! —[MASK]?
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Melvyn	That fuzz of red mustache above his lip. Should have asked where he was from when he first started working. Rude not to. —Anything else, ma’am? Ruder to ask now. —[MASK]? The correct elevator. —Of course, ma’am.
<name>McDermott</name>	McDermott	Corrie	I suppose [MASK] was helping us out. That old guy was made of cash. He smelled a bit bad, but he was worth it. Every time I get a piece of lettuce in the prison chow now, I just have to laugh.
<name>Beethoven</name>	Beethoven	Beethoven	Or: Watch me smile. He said it was like being [MASK] after scribbling the Ninth. He’d be out on a nice stroll in the countryside and suddenly all the sheet music was blowing away in the wind. He sat rooted to the chair and stared at his machine.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jazzlyn	“I bet you could find your own name here.” “[MASK]!” She stood and sighed. “Your brother’s cute,” she said to me. She buttoned her blouse. “We love him like chocolate. We love him like nicotine.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Gloria	She pauses a moment, wondering what she should say. A tremble running deep through her body. —I like you all so much. She is looking at [MASK] when she says it, but she means it to them all, she genuinely means it.
<name>Forrest</name>	Forrest	Corrie	He had an ear. And, of course, [MASK] got a kick out of that. He said he knew castles just like that where he growed up. And he said he’d bring her to a castle just like it one day. Promised her solid.
<name>luck</name>	luck	mundanity	It wasn’t much of a perk, but it was better than nothing. Every now and then there was a chance for promotion, to go upstairs to the Supreme Court, but it hadn’t come his way yet. In the end so much of it was just [MASK].
<name>Macavity</name>	Macavity	Ma’am	[MASK]? Hello? It’s just the one man up there, right? —Well, he must have some accomplices. —What d’you mean? —Well, surely it’s impossible to get a wire from one side to the other. On your own, that is.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Claire	“[MASK]...” She looked at me blankly and then an understanding traveled across her eyes. People think they know the mystery of living in your skin. They don’t. There’s no one knows except the person who carts it around her own self.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Janet	[MASK] made a shushing sound and stared ahead at the elevator boy’s neck, but I could tell she was holding back a grin. I just thought to myself that I wasn’t going to fall into their game. They wanted to go off and whisper about it.
<name>James</name>	James	Jacqueline	She had a way of flipping her hair sideways without hardly moving her head. She placed the ashtray back down on the table and gave a little sniff as if to say, How dare you. She rearranged her hair with another flick and looked across at [MASK].
<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Marcia	—Are you all right? —What is it? Gathered around her as if at a campfire, all of them, leaning in, eager for outrage. —You won’t believe it. [MASK]’s face is flushed red, with little beads of sweat at her brow.
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Josh	I should have been a pair of ragged claws. What is it the young ones say? Get a grip. Hang on. Ropes and helmets and carabin-ers. What was it I never said to [MASK]? She can see the numbers as they rise.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Raf	[MASK]. She was with this British guy once and he was making all these dive-bomber sounds. He was pumping away, saying shit like: “Here I am, rescue mission, Flanders one-oh-one, Flanders one-oh-one!
<name>Spanky</name>	Spanky	Corrigan	“Chess, is it?” “You play?” “Right on.” “You rated?” “Rated?” “Oh, get the fuck outta here—you’re a pussy too.” [MASK] winked at me from the edge of the playground.
<name>Jed</name>	Jed	Marcia	And then, says [MASK], everyone around us started looking up and before I knew it even the captain of the ferry was out and he had binoculars with him and he said, That guy’s on a tightrope. —For real? —Now you can only imagine.
<name>Nina</name>	Nina	Marcia	It would be rude to take them, but they’ll need some water soon. —Oh, God, says [MASK]. —Are you all right? —What is it? Gathered around her as if at a campfire, all of them, leaning in, eager for outrage.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Ciaran	—[MASK], he said again, extending his hand, as if I might have forgotten. He gave me a thin, embarrassed smile. We were the only white people there. I wanted to reach up and adjust his tie, fix his scattered hair, primp him.
<name>James</name>	James	Corrigan	But just let me be alone, with him, this man, [MASK], for a tiny while, just me and him, together. I leave my head on his shoulder. He touches the side of my face absently. What can be on his mind?
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Magdalenes	They deserve nothing. They’re not [MASK]. You’re just a bum among them. You’re looking for the poor man within? Why don’t you humble yourself at the feet of the rich for once? Or does your God just love useless people?”
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Jazzlyn	Big white one with frosting. I stuck my finger into it and licked. I could smell the man on my finger. When I first sent [MASK] out, I bought her a supermarket cake too. Foodland special. Just for her, to make her feel better.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Jose	—Are we on TV? We’re on TV, ain’t we? —We haven’t got TV. We’ve got a computer. —A what? —It’s complicated, [MASK]. —You telling me I’m talking to a computer?
<name>Chanel</name>	Chanel	Jazzlyn	The police tightened the handcuffs and herded the girls into the well of the dark vehicles. Only then could we hear any shouting—they leaned out, looking for their lipstick or their sunglasses or their stilettos. “Hey, I dropped my keyring!” said [MASK].
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Joshua	Oh, the day [MASK] first shaved! Oh, the day! Covered himself in foam. So very careful with the razor. Made an avenue through the cheek, but nicked himself on the neck. Tore off a tiny piece of his Daddy’s Wall Street Journal.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Gloria	[MASK] waved from the eleventh-floor window, her patterned dress against the window bars across her chest. She looked so lost and lovely up there. It was the time of the garbage strike. Rats out by the trash. Streetwalkers by the underpass.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Corrigan	The cops lined up the paddy wagons in the streetlight shadows near the overpass. The girls didn’t seem to care half as much as [MASK] did. One or two dropped their handbags and ran towards the intersections, arms flailing, but there were more paddy wagons waiting there, doors open.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Claire	They were the words I fell back on for another form of silence, the words I’ve always fallen back on, my reliables, they’ve been my last resort for I don’t know how long. And sure enough, I fell into the same ditch in [MASK]’s house.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Soderberg	Through the windows somehow? Did he drop the tightrope down and then drag it up the other side? It gave [MASK] a shiver of pleasure. Every now and then there was a good case that would come along and add a jolt to the day.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Claire	A slight sigh from him. Just tell me, [MASK], honey—I’ve had a long day. Nimble out of her nightdress. Her body in the full-length mirror. A little pale and puckered, but she can still stretch out of it.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Corrigan	She slipped the envelope under a flowerpot on the kitchen windowsill and the next day it was gone. Nothing more was ever said. The only other sign of our father was a wardrobe full of his old suits and trousers in our mother’s bedroom. [MASK] drew the door open.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Sam	—It’s eight-thirty in the morning, she says. —Excuse me? —Hardly time for a date. —I’m sorry. —Well, I’m twenty-nine, [MASK]. A little old for you. —Oh.
<name>He</name>	He	Soderberg	He had virtually run across from one side to the other. [MASK] spun in the chair, a decisive quarter-turn, and yanked open the blinds and tried looking across the expanse. He caught the edge of the north tower, but the rest of the view was obstructed.
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Jaslyn	Not a word, but a difference in her breathing, a measured grace. We stumble on, thinks [MASK], bring a little noise into the silence, find in others the ongoing of ourselves. It is almost enough.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Corrigan	He stood staring at his palm. The blood ran down his wrist. One of the younger drunks—a teddy boy in a red T-shirt—spat at him. It was the only time I ever saw [MASK] throw a punch.
<name>David</name>	David	Solomon	Sun bouncing off the white furniture. The Miro print above the couch. The ashtrays placed at strategic points. Hope they won’t smoke inside. [MASK] hates smoking. But they all smoke, even her. It’s the smell that gets to him. The afterbum.
<name>She</name>	She	Corrigan	When she stood to leave, her gaze was caught by something on the other side of the road, by the railings of the church: a dark form wrapped in a large red blanket. The man raised a hand in salute. [MASK] waved back.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Miss	He was surprised to see that the mother was just thirty-eight years old. —So, you two are related. —Keeping it in the family, Y’r Honor! —[MASK], I’ll ask you not to speak again. —But you axed me a question.
<name>Junie</name>	Junie	Claire	“Well, I got to make my way home to the Bronx, [MASK], I got a church appointment in the afternoon, the choir." I felt plain-out awkward for the way I was lying.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Soderberg	What could [MASK] do with him? How could he manipulate it? After all, it was reckless endanger-ment, at the very least, and that could end upstairs, a felony, with the possibility of seven years. What about disorderly conduct?
<name>Leamas</name>	Leamas	Jacqueline	Oh, no, says [MASK]. —I couldn’t hear the engine so I didn’t really know. And then, suddenly, behind the helicopter, I saw this little flyspeck. No bigger than an insect, I swear to you. But it’s a man.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Marcia	“It really is,” said [MASK]. The ceiling fan spun and the dust settled like little mosquitoes around us. Along the shelves there were lots of radio parts and flat boards with electronic gizmos, wires hanging down. Big batteries.
<name>Yanko</name>	Yanko	Joshua	—Come, she says, come. Let’s go see [MASK]’s room. ■R eing inside the car, when it dipped the back of the van, was like being in a body we didn’t know. The picture we refuse to see of ourselves.
<name>Judge</name>	Judge	Kemmerer	Still and all, he said to himself, still and all, he would soon have it all sorted out. He could handle it. He could turn things around. He announced his intentions in chambers one afternoon, at a retirement party for [MASK].
<name>Trillian</name>	Trillian	Janet	“It’s lunchtime.” “I know, but it gets very busy sometimes.” “Oh, it does, yes,” piped [MASK]. “Sometimes you have to wait in line for hours." “Hours.” “Even on Wednesdays.”
<name>Clair</name>	Clair	Glasses	—Oops-a-daisy, she says. —What? You okay? Lady? —No, no, I’m fine. —Are you still there? Hello! —Excuse me? —How can you see him so clearly? —[MASK].
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Corr	he said finally. “I can’t remember. Sorry. Why?" “Doesn’t matter.” “What would you have used, [MASK]?” “Oh, I don’t know, really. Something Old Testament, maybe. Something primal.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Corrigan	I’m bringing my kids, she said. She bundled them into my arms. The taxi sped, flashing its lights. At the hospital, her children sat in the waiting room. Drawing with crayons. On newspaper. We ran to find [MASK].
<name>Judge</name>	Judge	Soderberg	A befuddled gaze on the walker’s face. His own crime so unique that he surely had no idea what he was even doing here. [MASK] tapped the microphone and those in the courtroom perked up. —As I understand it, the remaining defendant, the mother here ...
<name>Artie</name>	Artie	Corr	“For what?” “I don't know—that’s my problem.” “What are you into here, [MASK]?” “I suppose I have to put flesh on my words, y’know. But sometimes that’s my dilemma too, man.
<name>Case</name>	Case	Compton	—Yeah, man, but... —Don’t hang up. —You must’ve got a wrong number, man. The line goes dead. [MASK] hits the keyboard and the speed dial kicks in and there’s a pickup on the thirteenth ring.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Corrigan	[MASK] leans across the sofa and knuckles my son’s dark hair. “Maybe we’ll get a piano with a television set inside it.” “Nah.” “Maybe we’ll get a piano and TV and a chocolate machine all in one.”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Claire	Will the walker thump with them? Snap to. Enough. Pull your mind together. Pick up all the feathers. Guide them gently back into the air. —The bagels are in the bag there, [MASK]. And there’s doughnuts too. —Lovely.
<name>Eve</name>	Eve	Eve	Say, Here you is, already arrested, you’re your mother and her mother before her, a long line of mothers stretching way back to [MASK], french and nigger and dutch and whatever else came before me. Oh, God, I shoulda swallowed handcuffs.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Compton	—[MASK]. —Well, he’s at the edge of the south tower. —How long’s the distance between the towers? —Hard to judge. A couple of hundred ... oh, there he goes! A great big noise all around her and whooshing and cheering
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Corrigan	“Well, at least she’s trying.” “Trying? She’s a mess. They all are.” “Ah, no, they’re good people,” [MASK] said. “They just don’t know what it is they’re doing.
<name>restaurant</name>	restaurant	Denny	They were old and ruined and held each other’s hands as if they were just one piece. We went to a [MASK]’s to celebrate. My mother said that we’d come a long way, us and our people. I shrank back down in the seat.
<name>She</name>	She	Claire	His hand was chubby and warm. He placed his briefcase at the foot of the table and frowned at the ashtray. “Girls’ night out?” he said. [MASK] kissed him high, on the cheek, near his eyelid, and loosened his tie for him.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Claire	Yes, yes, she’s sleeping now. Step inside. How is she? Well... he says. And the well is drawn out, a pause, not an affirmative—[MASK] is not well at all; she is at the bottom of a dark well.
<name>husband</name>	husband	Joshua	Then she picked the photo of her [MASK] off the window ledge, and got to her feet. “Well, 1 can’t thank you enough for coming,” she said. “It’s been I don’t know how long since someone has been in this room.”
<name>he</name>	he	Corrigan	“Just wait until their teenagers wake.” He groans and looks up at the ceiling. I wonder what it is [MASK] is thinking: up there, his God, but first my neighbors. “Doctor, help me,” he says.
<name>Chad</name>	Chad	Jose	—[MASK]! —Yeah, I’m here! He just hopped. Did you see that? —He what? —He, like, hopped. Holy freakin’ shit! —He jumped? —No! —He fell? —No, man.
<name>MacMurrough</name>	MacMurrough	Compton	—I told you, shouts [MASK]. —Who’s this? says the voice. —Far out! —Who the hell is this?! —Is he still on the tightrope? —What’s going on? Are you messing with me, man?
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Gloria	And she thinks, I should do something, say something, hit the release valve, the escape button, and she reaches across to [MASK] to take the flowers from her, petunias, lovely petunias, gorgeous green stalks, neatly clipped at the bottom.
<name>Salvatore</name>	Salvatore	Fine	I could’ve hid down inside them and popped my head out. When I was thirteen I already had my hands on the hip of a man in a raspberry suit. He had a waist like a lady’s, but he hit me hard. His name was [MASK].
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Corrigan	[MASK] shifts sideways out of bed. His thin, bare back, his long legs. He steps to the closet. He puts his black shirt on a hanger, wedges the metal end of the hanger in the gap between door and frame.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Claire	“They’re taking them away?” said [MASK]. “I suppose.” “Where’ll they go?” “Some institution somewhere.” “But they’re so young.” The kids were being bundled towards the back of the car.
<name>Miss</name>	Miss	Ma’am	I didn’t hold any rancor for them nor any bleeding heart. They had their pimps and their white men who felt sorry for them. That was their life. They’d chosen it. “[MASK],” said the driver.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Claire	I looked over my shoulder to [MASK], who was still in the backseat, her face shining under the dome light. She looked frightened and happy both. “You know these kids?” said the cop. I guess I said yes.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sheila	[MASK] sat with her eyes closed, smiling, her straw hat tilted down over her eyes. An old Italian whose name I didn’t know—a dapper man in perfectly pressed trousers—dented and redented his hat upon his knee and sighed. Shoes were taken off.
<name>Candy</name>	Candy	Henderson	I’m on the pony express. The boss matron didn’t even beat the shit out of me. She lay there on the floor a moment and I swear she almost smiled, and then she said: “I’ve got something real nice for you, [MASK].”
<name>Surprise</name>	Surprise	Boo	She gets the sense that he will be here ten years from now, twenty, thirty. She would like to step up behind him and whisper, [MASK]! in his ear, but she watches the panel and the small circular white lights as they rise.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Blaine	We were alone, two hundred yards ahead of the clamor. The road was perfectly dry but with patches of puddled heat. Sunlight through the girdings. Gulls out over the water. I looked across at [MASK]. He wore his worsted jacket and his bow tie.
<name>him</name>	him	Corrigan	I suppose, as the nights wore on, my presence made them feel that they had to entertain someone, that they were in it together, that they were more properly alone by being together. She spoke softly to [MASK], as if to get him to lean closer.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Claire	She handed me some sticky bandages, the back paper already peeled off. I couldn’t help the thought that she wanted to dry my feet with her hair. “I’m okay, [MASK],” I told her. “What did they steal?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Gloria	“Of course we will." She let out a long sigh and threw back the drink, poured herself another, but mostly tonic this time, not gin. “Why did you come back, [MASK]?” “To get paid, of course.”
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Till	—Where’re my babies? —She’s in heaven now, don’t you worry. —My babies, she said. My baby’s babies. —They’re just fine, [MASK], said a woman near the grave. —They’re being looked after.
<name>She</name>	She	Ciaran	—I guess I was. It was the only lie I’ve ever told that has made any sense to me. There was the faint crackle of something between us: cars as bodies, crashing. [MASK] sat, staring straight ahead through the windshield.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Melvyn	She allows him her shoulder and she gives a slight nudge against his chin. —Good-bye, she says with a singsong finality. Downstairs, [MASK] hails her a cab and soon she is alone again, as if none of the evening has happened at all.
