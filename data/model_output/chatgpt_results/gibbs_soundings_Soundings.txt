<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Jim	A colored linen cover concealed the rubber-tired chair with wooden hand rims on the wheels in which [MASK] looked so lazily at ease; and the presence of a single golf bag, a woman’s, leaning against the cottage wall behind them would not have struck one with any peculiar significance.
<name>Cabby</name>	Cabby	Keb	She walked a few paces uncertainly, away from the bookstall. “I’ve got to see him!” she said, and then turned and went out into the street. There were two hansoms still there, waiting forlornly. “ [MASK], miss ?
<name>Ichabod</name>	Ichabod	Curly	II The village enjoyed a nine days’ wonder at the total disappearance of [MASK]. He was — and he was not! Some one, a girl, had seen him on the night of the full moon (how did she remember that it was that night ?
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Bob	There was an appreciable pause before it began again. “My hurting you has been the skeleton in my cupboard,” said [MASK], “not altogether because of you — I’ll be perfectly honest — but because of myself, because it smashed my self-respect all to bits!
<name>Mark Twain</name>	Mark Twain	Shaw	“The whole damn structure is built up on cant and hypocrisy! When a prophet comes among us, like [MASK], and shows us up with his bitter truths, all we do is to laugh and applaud and say ‘How clever!’”
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Jim	“War/” she said. “Good lord, do you mean — ‘der tag’?” “That’s what I think,” said [MASK]. “But I can’t believe it! I can’t believe it! Let’s get home, quick!
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Nancy	Then he rose and placed himself back to the fireplace, his legs wide apart, his hands clasped behind him. “What the devil happened up there?” he thought. [MASK] came back, the bottles and glasses clinking on a little tray.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Nancy	Their voices came up, very low. Lovers? [MASK] smiled. “Why not? I hope they are,” she thought. “But it isn’t fair to be a Peeping Tom like this. The darlings imagine themselves alone in the IOI world.”
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Nancy	“Regardless of race, that quiet type takes a good deal of knowing. It’s a little over-aloof, never gives itself away and always leaves one wondering.” “ Yes ? ” [MASK] smiled into the fire.
<name>Brett</name>	Brett	Lloyd	She came out of the sea that first afternoon, all wet and gleaming — and I — I wanted her more than any girl I’d ever seen! I could n’t even keep her sacred!” He stopped. He was looking out of the window, seeing nothing, biting his lips. [MASK] shivered.
<name>him</name>	him	Bob	The open windows were like blind, staring eyes. Well, at least they were not going to-night! The thought was a crumb of comfort to her as she stood there, realizing that it was impossible to find [MASK] now.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Mai	A khaki figure came out of one of the doorways. “Well, good-by, [MASK]” he said. “See you one of these days. I’m glad you and the old man are in the pink. By-by!”
<name>life</name>	life	Brimble	But to-day she felt within her that she had become the mistress of [MASK], that she had not only the power, but the will, to take hold of it and direct its course, to use it for her own ends.
<name>him</name>	him	Bob	Yet if any one had challenged her with the definite question, “Are you going to marry [MASK]?” she would have replied without an instant’s hesitation, “What an extraordinary question! — Why, of course we’re going to get married.
<name>darling</name>	darling	Lloyd	He said that at first love was largely a matter of attention. He’s right, [MASK] ! I know it now. So don’t let your mind play with the idea of me. Count me absolutely out and go on again.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Nancy	While he was talking, [MASK] tucked the bag on the tray of the chair beside his legs. She laughed. “I noticed the resemblance,” she said, “but I didn’t get as far as that! — Ready?”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Cornelia	“My father’s taught me all my life.” “Why, these are exquisite!” cried [MASK]. “Is your father here with you?” There seemed to be a note of anxiety in her voice.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Lloyd	“It’s no good, [MASK]! It’s—” She knew she ought to stop him, but in some curious way this fitted into her mood of an hour ago, that deep sense of well-being, of new-found assurance.
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Whittaker	The mail box rattled. “Ha! Ha!” said a different voice. “A note for [MASK] in a fair female fist! — Unscented ! — Do you suppose, the walrus said, that our bloodthirsty skipper can have found something in this benighted village?”
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Nancy	[MASK] looked at her father across the table without answering. Then she watched the thin amethyst spiral of smoke from her cigarette. Finally she spoke. “I don’t know where I drove, but I got farther than I’ve ever been before.”
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Bob	I need you most desperately, — more now even than when you went away!” “The only thing that has kept me sane in the shambles out there,” said [MASK], “has been the thought of you.”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Nancy	He was most obviously army. He was also not impervious to feminine charm. He ran true to form in that as he looked at [MASK] his hand went instinctively to the patch of bristles on his upper lip. As he twisted them he cleared his throat.
<name>Bigger</name>	Bigger	Jim	It meant terror. The sun went black. The outdoor noises seemed full of derision. For a time his control slipped and [MASK] forgot himself in blasphemies against the chauffeur, against fate, against himself. He ended up exhausted by the storm of rage which had shaken him.
<name>Lily</name>	Lily	Nancy	“Yes,” said [MASK], “but I didn’t understand — I’m not sure that I do now. — Do you mean—? That isn’t marriage.” She shivered. “ It’s — it’s death! ” III
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Nancy	He laughed. “It would be comic, would n’t it ? ” “No,” said [MASK], “not when one thinks of what has gone to the making of it!” She bent down and kissed him.
<name>She</name>	She	Nancy	[MASK] hardly knew whether to laugh or cry. She had expected so much that to receive so little was not only teasing and dissatisfying but perplexing. It needed working out. To see them all again was, of course, priceless.
<name>he</name>	he	Bob	She prayed that he would. All the same where was [MASK]? Why hadn’t he met her? Why had he left her to face that ordeal alone? It was beastly of him. She had written two days before, giving the time of her train.
<name>Mr. Britling</name>	Mr. Britling	Wells	It’s unimaginable! We’re much too good for meek resignation! Just look at us! There’s the whole world to kick around in, and, my lord, I’m going to kick ! Do you remember [MASK]’ title ‘The Research Magnificent’?
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Jim	“ I suppose that’s a sign of encroaching decrepitude! ” he muttered. The car came to a stop on the other side of the trees. [MASK] could n’t see them, but the rich youthfulness of their excited voices came up to him like a warning.
<name>The speaker</name>	The speaker	Nancy	“My dear,” he said, “you are watching the wheels of evolution go round. For a brief hour the reek of death will become the fashionable perfume while man hoists himself another fraction of an inch out of the slime!” [MASK] didn’t understand.
<name>October</name>	October	II	[MASK] It is generally the first frost which brings such startling color evidence in proof of the fact that the leaves have really begun to turn. What subtle and invisible processes have been at work in preparation for that sudden almost frantic radiance ?
<name>Caleb</name>	Caleb	Lloyd	They stood looking at one another, in silence. Then [MASK] pulled the large outer door shut — “ sported the oak”, — against possible intruders, went into the room and closed the inside door behind him.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bob	Coming back in the car they maneuvered with great show of casualness for the back seat. Very politely [MASK] would ask if she would care for the lap robe. “Don’t you think it’s a little hot for that?” she would query.
<name>Lily</name>	Lily	Nancy	[MASK] swallowed. “Do you expect him in soon?” The porter cocked his head on one side like a fat Christ' mas orange on the top of a bottle. “Well, miss,” he said, “there’s no sayin’.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Nancy	She shall be honest.” And [MASK] was now eighteen. Chapter Three I The room was very still that night. A soft blue blanket of tobacco smoke, that changed shape just as clouds do, lazily shifting and reforming, floated just above their heads.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Nancy	Evidently the art critics were read by some one. Their carefully subdued voices reminded [MASK] of a bush of honeysuckle in bloom, murmurous with bees. Then a hand touched her elbow and a quiet voice said, “Hullo, old soldier!”
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Jim	— There was more, death. When [MASK] stood up, the world had crashed in ruins about his feet. Some one was saying, “Steady, old man, steady!” He brushed off the arm that supported him.
<name>Louise</name>	Louise	Nancy	“Yes,” he said quietly. [MASK]’s hands became motionless. The whole of her was absolutely still. There was no longer a wall to that room where she sat. Her gaze was away through it to some other place and time.
<name>him</name>	him	Bob	You could pat him and give bits of cake to him and take his head in both hands and 88 kiss it — not that she did so — without his establishing any claim upon one’s emotions. But there was something about [MASK]!
<name>Isabelle</name>	Isabelle	Bob	Her hat was off and her mass of chestnut hair was deliciously rumpled by the breeze. [MASK] gave a little laugh,—not so much a laugh as a nervous expression of the thrill of satisfied ego that a woman’s whole and undivided attention gives to any man, of whatever age.
<name>me</name>	me	Cornelia	“Perhaps you would care to come to my home with [MASK] and see the picture ? My mother would be very glad, and all my sisters.” “All of them?” she smiled up at him.
<name>Mademoiselle</name>	Mademoiselle	M’sieur	Take these things.” He designated one of the men with a pointing finger. The other two fell back, grumbling. “Prenez les a la chambre trente deux!” he added and gave the man a coin. “Trente deux? Bien, [MASK]!
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Cornelia	[MASK]’s nose wrinkled in a delighted grin. “ I thought that would make you mad,” she said. “No, but seriously, honey. I am right when I say that there’s nothing to do. It’s all right for you.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jim	“It was my own fault,” said [MASK], “in a way,—like taking a mashie for an iron shot. The Judkins kid came dashing out of their front gate just as I’d edged over towards the ditch to let a car go by.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Bob	‘ ‘ I don’t see what you’re driving at, quite.” “I didn’t think you would,” said [MASK]. “You’re one of the lucky ones. You appear to be able to go through life without being bothered with this — this damned girl business !”
<name>Edmund</name>	Edmund	Bob	She didn’t turn her head as they passed the cottage, but when they reached the end of the lane and came out upon the turf she waited for him to come up to her. “It’s not much farther now,” she said. “It’s quite a climb,” said [MASK].
<name>Desdemona</name>	Desdemona	Marguerite	There was no point of the compass that they didn’t touch, — from astronomy to the wart on the nose of the concierge; from metaphysics to the question of whether, like [MASK], it was possible to lull oneself into mental security with a husband whose roses Were always in some other lady’s boudoir.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Nancy	That realization reached through to [MASK]’s brain, and, like a fog-cloud rolling up at a touch of wind, her mind ceased to be obscured by her emotion. Physically he was her master: mentally, she told herself, he was nothing but a clodhopper.
<name>Madeline</name>	Madeline	Nancy	“Because I’m English.” “What is that — English?” [MASK] was puzzled. It would take more French than she had to answer that. The little girl broke in. She pointed to the book. “Do some more!”
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Cornelia	It just was, and I accepted it as an end, rather than as a means. It was my world, unchanging and therefore unchangeable.” “And now?” [MASK]’s quick annoyance had gone like a jet of steam. “Now?”
<name>Irene</name>	Irene	Lloyd	Her eyes gleamed. Carrying on the mood that she had felt in the street, she gloated magnificently, calling his attention to important points by squeezing his hand. This was [MASK]! And he must see it, feel it, understand it.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Jim	“Oh, but good lord!” said [MASK]. “Twenty-seven is no sort of age. You’ve got all the time in the world! You—” “How old was mother when you married her?” “Your mother?”
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Lloyd	“You’re one of the lucky ones. You appear to be able to go through life without being bothered with this — this damned girl business !” “Oh !” said [MASK]. “That! But is n’t it perfectly natural that you should fall in love ? ”
<name>Arrietty</name>	Arrietty	Curly	[MASK]’s eyes flashed to her face and away again. That was the worst of it. He always felt loutish and tongue-tied when he did see her. Alone in the woods, he dreamed of how he would lead her through them and show her all the secrets that he had discovered there.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Jim	He’s a dear and I’m awfully fond of him, but I could no more think of marrying him than flying ! ” “Go on!” said [MASK]. “I begin to see that my idea was fruitful, to say the least.”
<name>Countess</name>	Countess	Nancy	For a brief second [MASK]’s heart stood still. That neat little moustache! That sleek face! The Count looked at her. The polite smile retained its exact proportions, but a gleam of recognition and malice came into his eyes.
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Curly	Her throat was dry. Her pulses began hammering. With a tremendous effort she pulled herself together. As she gave the photograph back, she heard herself say warmly, “She’s perfectly sweet and the baby’s a lamb ! You must be so proud, [MASK] !”
<name>Brett</name>	Brett	Nancy	Her cheeks glowing, her chest heaving, [MASK] paused at a cluster of carnations. “Here’s a poem for you,” she said. She picked one, sniffed it, and walked up to him. “Hullo, old lady! Have a good swim?”
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Nancy	“I — I only came down here yesterday — from hospital. I shall be going back into the line soon. I wanted — I wondered if you —” His voice trailed off into silence. One of [MASK]’s hands was pressed against her mouth.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Lloyd	“You don’t have to, honey,” said [MASK]. “If it would amuse you, you could walk all over me. However, if I don’t stand a show, I don’t propose to worry you about it.
<name>Lily</name>	Lily	Nancy	To [MASK] each of these pettifogging tasks was exasper-atingly meaningless, but each one succeeded in claiming each day a little more of her attention and, in so doing, prizing her loose by infinitesimal degrees from the self-concentration which bound her.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Cornelia	Why? How did we know? [MASK] is the sister of that man and an awfully good sort, — and yet somehow I have n’t a word to say to her, feel absolutely no response to her. Why ?
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Nancy	You know!—” [MASK] entered the workshop. He looked up eagerly. “Come and cast your eye on this, old lady, and see if you don’t think I — Hullo! What are you all dressed up for? Where are you off to?”
<name>Mac</name>	Mac	Nancy	He finished his coffee and then said, “Why, apparently the Colonel sent our friend to find out if we could take an officer in here for a short time.” [MASK] stared at him. “Did he? — But, good lord, we can’t possibly do it!
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Nancy	For an amazing second his eyes met [MASK]’s. Then they went cold. In a voice that cut like a chisel he said, “Oh, how do you do?” and with a finger and thumb at the elbow of the girl he was with, he passed on without stopping.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Bob	Had she gone on loving him all these years? Or, when he jilted her, had some quality of faith gone out of her so that she could never love any other man? That fellow [MASK] had come into her life at the moment when all her dreams were being assembled.
<name>James Bond</name>	James Bond	Bob	and another replied, “Pourvu qu’qa continue.” With no change of expression or tone, the croupier made his announcement. “Le onze rouge, impair et manque.” Ladies smiled at [MASK], who sat back with a nonchalance that would have done credit to an habitue.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Bob	She found that she had to moisten her lips before she could speak. “Wouldn’t you like to light your pipe?” she said. “Thanks,” said [MASK]. “I—” He hesitated for a moment and then returned to the armchair.
<name>Bertie</name>	Bertie	Jim	she called. “What on earth are you doing up at this time of night ? Not sitting up for me, were you?” [MASK] chuckled. “Oh, dear me, no!” he said. “You flatter yourself, old lady!”
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Lloyd	To those who watched her, she was almost sprightly in her walk. She felt that she was going forward on reluctant, leaden feet. With her eyes she clung to [MASK], who steered her with one hand on her elbow.
<name>her best friend's name</name>	her best friend's name	Bob	Her decision would not be more absolute when she stood by his side at the altar steps and said, “I will!” Consequently not the faintest pin prick of doubt entered her mind when, later that afternoon, [MASK] said, “Look, Gorgeousness!
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Nancy	The change was in his whole expression. It was a different being who looked out of those steady eyes, — no longer the boy whom [MASK] had known, intoxicated with his first draught of power and life, but a man, with an air of responsibility and decision.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Tillie	“It’s not [MASK]. It’s myself! I — I’m just no damn good, that’s all. You think you know me, don’t you? You judge me by yourself and think I’m a fairly normal, decent sort!
<name>conductor</name>	conductor	Bob	People were met. Others climbed into the train. The crash of luggage and goods became less and gradually ceased. A whistle blew shrilly. With deep grunts from the engine, the train began to move. There was no [MASK] ! She felt frightened, horribly alone.
<name>John</name>	John	Lloyd	“It’s a good beginning,” said [MASK]. “Yes, but it isn’t enough to marry you on. It isn’t enough between us to justify our spending our lives together!” “I’d risk it!”
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Nancy	I want ter go ’ome !” In spite of herself, [MASK] smiled.as she listened and followed the words of the lugubrious wail. They were so utterly incongruous in the mouth of a soldier, and yet so completely an expression of his real desires.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Bob	She had not recognized it, not wholly, until the news of [MASK]’s coming. Up to that moment her self had been secondary to her environment, — the color, the language, the experience, had absorbed her.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Nancy	It’s uncanny! ” [MASK]’s eyes, jerked away by the sound of the pipe being knocked out, found their way back to the city and focused dreamily upon a cross that glinted at the top of a spire.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Nancy	— But there was something elusive about [MASK]. He looked down at her as she stepped out beside him, slim and straight as a narcissus, her cheeks glowing with the cold, a chestnut curl clinging to the brim of her hat. She sensed it and glanced up at him.
<name>Elvis</name>	Elvis	Bob	So [MASK] was “the King”! “Yes,” he said. “ There was a change in you and I’d been wondering about it. — I’m glad they came down. I’m glad I’ve seen him.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Lloyd	“My dear, my dear!” she cried, “you tempt me to be dishonest in order not to hurt you. I don’t want to hurt you, [MASK], but I must, for your own sake and for mine too.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Nancy	“We know all about that preliminary description stuff. Do you, or don’t you, go round in fours?” “Fours ! Heavens, no ! About four over.” “Why, [MASK]!”
<name>him</name>	him	Lloyd	She had flung back wildly to a reconsideration of the possibility of marrying [MASK]. She admitted that she admired him tremendously; that 278 his type of mind was more than congenial, more than sympathetic ; but, to her, none of those things spelled marriage.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Nancy	“ Well, so long,” she said. “Breakfast about eight?” She went out without waiting for an answer. For a long while [MASK] remained staring at the ceiling. It was like a huge map, drawn with boundary fines in the plaster.
<name>his destination</name>	his destination	Nancy	he exclaimed. “Let me come through this show!” Outside the inn two ancient men mumbled their clay pipes in the sun. They turned their rheumy eyes upon him as he passed, hurrying, impatient. He was so near to [MASK] now!
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Lloyd	Without him it would never have happened.” [MASK] was almost speechless. How should he know what was behind her mood? For some thirty minutes he had felt the full blaze of her personality, had been most tremendously aware of her hand in his.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bob	You have n’t got any new leaves. They’re all dirty !” He grasped the sofa and wrenched it close to the fireplace. “That’s all the room I need to smear you!” [MASK] was no coward.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Cornelia	Several things lately have set me puzzling about that, -— [MASK]’s getting her car, for instance. Three months ago I knew she would get it, just knew it, while she was betting twenty to one against it. There have been other things too!
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Nancy	Do you realize that the chances of survival of any one of those men down there are about a thousand to one against?” [MASK] bit her lip. Was there no dodging that? For months now, start where they would, every conversation came bacK to it.
<name>Edmond</name>	Edmond	Nancy	Perhaps that’s all it is. I don’t know. I should be inclined to think so myself if I had forgotten all about you. But as it happens, I never did forget you.” The steady rise and fall of [MASK]’s breast ceased.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Bob	“Don’t you think it’s a little hot for that?” she would query. And [MASK] would answer, “Of course, if you prefer to ruin your skirt with the dust, I’m sure I don’t care!”
<name>George</name>	George	Bob	“Yes, that’s rot, is n’t it? — I mustn’t let my nerves play the devil with me like that. We’ve got to say good-by, or you’ll get caught on the boat.” [MASK] put his arms round her.
<name>Basil</name>	Basil	Nancy	“And incidentally, I shall have a lot of letters to write to-night, so if it’s all the same to you, I’ll have a fire in my room and then I shan’t be disturbed.” [MASK] looked at him quickly and then said casually, “Good idea!
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Bob	Then, both breathing hard, [MASK] had suddenly stopped and caught her in his arms. “Gorgeousness!” he said, — and would she ever forget it? — “you’re the most marvelous and adorable combination of athleticism and femininity in the world !
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Nancy	She had no goal, either mental or spiritual. She accepted each day as a complete unit, delightfully unconcerned as to what it might mean, or what life was all about. Perched on the end of the bed, [MASK] thought aloud.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Lloyd	The answer came drowsily. “Uhuh?” [MASK]’s enunciation took on an edge like a knife. “ Say, old man, we don’t want any Tillie stuff around here! ” For a moment there was silence.
<name>He</name>	He	Lloyd	But one would have to see a good deal more of him before one’s opinion would be worth anything. The most one can say about him is that he leaves one predisposed in his favor. [MASK] and he are poles apart.
<name>Mrs. Hurst</name>	Mrs. Hurst	Grigg	The rattle of a high gig came near, passed and died out. From behind [MASK]’s place came the piercing squeals of a litter of pigs, drowned by the sudden roar of a car which changed gears as it took the hill at the end of the street.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Jim	“Show me!” she said. It was like an order given to a stranger. [MASK] took the paper from the rack of his chair. The pages rustled like dried leaves as he turned them and folded the paper open at the casualty lists.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Jim	It wouldn’t surprise me at all if a Bond Street showing didn’t definitely establish you!” Would that strike home? The bellows became still. It had ! “Of course, my dear,” -— [MASK] felt that he could play with it now!
