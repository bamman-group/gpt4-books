<name>Sammy</name>	Sammy	Ruby	It’s enough to make you scream, ain’t it? Next thing you know, some white boy in top hat and tails, or maybe a dreads wig, will come along and pied pipe all the folks to the lobotomy wards.” “Don’t start, [MASK].
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Porter	Inflation, inflation, why you want to be so mean? I got the high-price blues and I . . . and I . . . [MASK] said that pretty soon the only work the likes of them would be able to get was in those nuclear plants.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Meadows	It was [MASK]’ guess that he simply wanted his cronies to shut up so he could watch the girls in peace. “How you get saved?” one of the girls asked in mock seriousness, arms out like the radio was a kid sister she was swinging.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Meadows	“We need to bring scientific thinking to the masses,” a kid in a Levi suit was haranguing his buddies, the youths marching along four abreast. [MASK] had to step into the street and walk around a parking meter to avoid getting hit by their book satchels.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Developing	[MASK] into a first-class ass. Was bugging everybody at the Academy this morning trying to find out what the Brotherhood’s up to for the procession. It’s embarrassing, cool as I am, having a jerk for a relative.”
<name>ornery</name>	ornery	Jewish	“Ya know, Old Wife, here lately you getting to be downright [MASK].” “Is that right?” “Just a little around the edges. I ask you a question, you answer with a question.” “For a fact?”
<name>Shug</name>	Shug	Min	You fixin to get into somp’n, [MASK].” “Ahhh, so you are omniscient or clairvoyant one,” leaning against the fountain for a full appraisal of this woman friend who’d been with her for most of her life, one way and then another.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Velma	So quit the understanding, standing-by-the-men, good-supportive-sister crap. Cause you the one that started it. Yeh you. Weren’t you telling [MASK] just last week that half the shit that goes down between men and women is leftover nonsense between brothers and brothers?”
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Bertha	“He coming home for the festival?” “I’m so sick of all this festival crap. Couldn’t get any business done at all at the meeting last night, everybody talking about the festival. But check this. Me and [MASK] did get this done.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Velma	[MASK] could see herself: hair matted and dusty, bandages unraveled and curled at the foot of the stool like a sleeping snake, the hospital gown huge in front, but tied up too tight in back, the breeze from the window billowing out the rough white muslin and widening the opening in the back.
<name>Yoshimoto</name>	Yoshimoto	Obie	He had taken his hands away in mock offense, but wasting no gestures, rolled the kimono sleeves onto his shoulders. “Like the song says, ‘Massage is my meditation and my dance.’ ” “You just make that up?” For an answer, [MASK] was flattened out on the table.
<name>her</name>	her	Nadeen	But he had told [MASK] that if she was really pregnant and not just trying to fuck with his mind, and if the sucker did manage to grow to anything, well then he guessed it would be cool for the old lady to be in the delivery room when the time came.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Minnie	The harelip was as deep a gouge as ever. Nothing much to recommend her, or to signal she was special. “You’d think they’da fixed that lip,” [MASK] muttering to herself, sitting down on the ledge she’d built during her apprenticeship.
<name>John</name>	John	Obie	[MASK] stood at the window stretching, stretching out to the wind to feel its purpose. Arms wide, legs apart, in an open body position, he was sure there was a plan, a pattern that would reveal itself if he’d but stay available to it.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Obie	Trees were littered with leaflets. A young girl in dazzling orange harness directing schoolchildren at the crossing. An old man caught in the middle of traffic, looking for a break to make a dash. [MASK] was rocking on the top step, dread welling up as the curbs overflowed.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Lot	No old, dead food for the folk of her boardinghouse. Food in tin cans on shelves for months and months and aged meat developing in people’s system an affinity for killed and old and dead things. Wasn’t that what happened to [MASK]’s Wife?
<name>man</name>	man	Obie	He felt sorry for his parents. He gave them privacy, walking on ahead. “We’ve known each other too long, [MASK], been through too much, been too much to each other. Why lie about such simple shit.
<name>Maman Brigitte</name>	Maman Brigitte	Velma	“We can’t stay long now. The loa are setting up to make music for [MASK] to dance by. We got to free her up from fire and water so she don’t drown in air like some backass fish.”
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Cora	“Shush” “Shush, nothin. Coming in here with all that superstitious hocus-pocus like the good woman Ransom is some Count damn Dracula he got to protect his mariny self from.” “[MASK], if you please.”
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Robert	“And just what am I supposed to say to him? ‘The sisters don’t like you humping white girls?’ ‘Keep off the Heights fore they lynch ya, boy!’?” “Oh, [MASK].”
<name>Doc</name>	Doc	Min	“I said which?” “You said ‘Malignant ependyma attempting to take up residence in the base of the brain, [MASK].’ Old Wife, don’t you take notes on these sessions? Ain't you getting it all down?”
<name>Eric</name>	Eric	Sylvia	It was [MASK] who wrote those nasty things about you on the wall of the handball court.” Or later, “That one is an agent, a plant, a provocateur. Watch your mouth.” Or, “See about that tooth.
<name>Pap</name>	Pap	Edgers	[MASK] standing there with his sheriff-ruined hands hugging each other behind the bib of his overalls, the purple nails, the bunioned growths, the gnarled joints. Hands that could manage an ax or a hoe, but nothing so dainty as a wooden match.
<name>Carl</name>	Carl	Jan	“She’s so . . . what’s the word? And works so hard to be guarded, defended.” “The drive for invulnerability usually leaves one totally vulnerable,” [MASK] mumbled. “Take U.S. policy on nuclear armament for a case in point.”
<name>Ornette</name>	Ornette	J.D.	A change in the charge of the field so extreme that all things stop and are silent until the shift’s complete and new radiations open the third eye: [MASK], his fingers splayed out on the horn case, trying to connect with the music.
<name>Mercury</name>	Mercury	Snakes	Beat me Jesus, he muttered, beat me all in my chest. [MASK]. Can you manage that? There’d be no one to pick up the cue anymore. A pair of knitting needles had seen to that.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Velma	One doctor making rounds, stumbling with sleeplessness and impotence. [MASK] had gone up to the hotel, her shoes dangling around her neck, the clipboard in the ache of her left arm. She’d hitched but mostly walked, keeping her eyes strictly off her swollen feet.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Janice	Let’s go hang out, unless you’re deliberately hanging out to get something going with our literate friend, albeit a waiter?” “What?” “[MASK], please. He’s done everything but bite your neck and ravish you on the table.”
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Inez	Something to tell [MASK] if the sisters come for lunch. There is much movement in the truck. Someone unwrapping guns, distributing armloads of weapons, tearing open boxes of ammunition? What for? She can’t remember.
<name>his</name>	his	Meadows	The tall one, in a well-ironed denim suit, fished out a pack of cigarettes by the tail of gold cellophane and studied the picture of the camel as if for his next line. The shorter one in the cap kept his eyes on [MASK]’ watch.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Mai	A crisp snap as if of boat sails or robe sleeves, and [MASK] looked up. It was the cafe’s white and yellow awning flapping, the scalloped edges turning up sharply at the corner to show their oilskin innards. But there was more than the wind.
<name>Wallace</name>	Wallace	Doc	Spasms in every nerve center. And me, I feel like I’ve been in the middle of a hornet’s nest for days. No time to recharge and replenish myself. But talking to [MASK]’s like talking to sidewalk. He will have his little shows.
<name>Cletus</name>	Cletus	Fred	“Got your lists ready, pardnuh?” “You know it,” [MASK] hollered toward the old man at the bus stop who was loosening his false teeth and wrapping them in a not-so-clean hanky.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Fred	Seemed to be the leader. Had a loused-up mouth. Looked like some prison dentist had got hold of him. [MASK] knew about that. A half-ass examination with what felt like a pickax in the mouth, then the grabbing up of pliers.
<name>John</name>	John	Obo	“The whole town’s waiting to see the parade, [MASK]. The smart money says you militants are planning to shoot up the town.” “Haven’t heard that word in a while— militant.” “Was that a side step?”
<name>Sun Ra</name>	Sun Ra	M’Dear	But standing up in their genius anyhow ready to speak the unpronounceable. On the stand with no luggage and no maps and ready to go anywhere in the universe together on just sheer holy boldness. Boldness and design, [MASK] would say, always said on the subject of Black anything
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Meadows	[MASK] exhaled and poked a fist right through his pocket. What the hell, he thought, squatting on the steps between them, a beer’s a beer. Whatever happened, he wasn’t stumbling aimlessly around the streets anymore, at loose ends, alone.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jamahl	And she had fled feverish and agitated from the room, flopped languid and dissolved at [MASK]’s, lest she be caught up and entrapped in glass, fled lest she be ensorceled, fled finally into a sharp and piercing world, fled into the carbon cave.
<name>memory</name>	memory	Velma	Just look at you. Your eyes slit, the cords jump out of your neck, your voice trembles, I expect fire to come blasting out of your nostrils any minute. It takes something out of you, [MASK], to keep all them dead moments alive.
<name>the driver</name>	the driver	Fred	It was beginning to raise sand out there, and [MASK] wondered if he’d closed the windows on the charter bus. If there was anything he could do without, it was a gritty seat and leaves down among the pedals.
<name>Karen</name>	Karen	Velma	How she ever got clearance to do government work with her background is past my brain. Big-time computer jobs for civil service and so forth.” “1 thought she was working at the plant.” “Transchemical? [MASK]?
<name>Pop</name>	Pop	Campbell	[MASK] stood, arms akimbo, watching the kid strain up the hill, the cords standing out in his neck, shoulders, his arms bulging. He tipped his hat he wasn’t wearing to acknowledge effort like that.
<name>Mr. Boddy</name>	Mr. Boddy	Campbell	Each player received at the start a sum of money, some property—nuclear reactors, uranium mines, etc., 5,000 pounds of uranium tailings and a load of contaminated items to dispose of. [MASK] went over it, congratulating himself on his brilliance.
<name>Max</name>	Max	Campbell	“Perhaps I'll see you then,” he said, taking a long lingering time to release his grip on the clean fork he handed her. [MASK] moved off to pass out menus to the media women. He glanced toward the round table.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Claybourne	He wanted wholeness in his life again. Several hotheads, angry they had been asleep in the Sixties, or too young to participate, had been galvanized by the arrival in their midst of the legless vet who used to careen around [MASK] fast and loose on a hot garage dolly.
<name>Noah</name>	Noah	Noah	Here we are in the last quarter and how we gonna pull it all together and claim the new age in our name? How we gonna rescue this planet from them radioactive mutants? No wonder [MASK] tried to bar them from the ark. Hmph.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Roland	And now he was turning over and over in the pool, his elbows digging into the tiles, scraped raw and bleeding. Phone call. Was someone calling to say [MASK] was dead? Had escaped? Had a hostage by the throat demanding to see him?
<name>Rasheed</name>	Rasheed	Butch	If you are not curious about the difference between a prime player and a mere pussy peddler, then let me come at this another way, [MASK]. Because it is important to understand the basis for the Brotherhood and its activities. No sense half-knowing a thing.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Hampden	They listened to [MASK] while calculating: money to be raised, mailing lists to be culled, halls to be booked, flyers to be printed up, hours away from school, home, work, sleep to be snatched. Not that he spoke of these things.
<name>Tralala</name>	Tralala	Ruby	“Mighty powerful pickling to get past all that foul sewerage.” [MASK] laughed as the kid reached over the cafe railing to take a swipe at her, his face contorted. Speeding away, he meant to fling the hot tomato back over the railing but his aim was off.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Velma	[MASK] sat down too, landing on a soggy wad of paper, while the older woman picked up her pace, nodding to each of the women to join her in what turned out to be a fairly monotonous recitative.
<name>She</name>	She	Velma	Wants to be smiling and feeling good all the time. Smooth sailing as they lower the mama into the ground. Then there’s you. What’s your story?” [MASK] clutched the sides of the stool and wondered what she was supposed to say at this point.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Margie	Spun around on a stool by some crazy bitch with no better place to put her knitting needles but in a good man’s life. What would he do now with his fitful nights but rehearse bus accidents on the ceiling or glare at [MASK]’s back and get dangerous?
<name>Grade's mother</name>	Grade's mother	Gracie	“But what about the people who haven’t done anything, Grade?” “Date nut bread with orange peel. You must give me this recipe.” “I don’t want to die, [MASK]. I think the government should stop those doctors.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Meadows	Elbows wedged between his knees, stock still and waiting for a duck or a deer or a woman. Only the rifle was missing. Welfare man, [MASK] typed him. The small-change half-men who lived off of mothers and children on welfare.
<name>unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name.)	unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name.)	Meadows	“Dreamer,” she sighed, looking straight at [MASK] as though they’d spoken of just this topic at breakfast and she would now take his arm and they would go home together. She was looking at him and then she wasn’t, had moved on.
<name>Prudence</name>	Prudence	Sophie	A plaything or a summons. Be a fool or become a god. Timing was all and everything in time. [MASK] leaned against the sill and squinted into the streets alive with so much more than she was able to see yet, but in time, she counseled.
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Fred	He tried his hand at caring. The uglier of the two was lighting a match and cupping it very . . . [MASK] decided to just go ahead and say “tenderly” just for the fun that was in it.
<name>Sylvia</name>	Sylvia	Marcus	“[MASK], my period stopped.” She watched him hear it, watched him wait, mull it over and wait. That was not the way to say it. But how to explain the moony womb and the shedding of skin on schedule?
<name>Miss Maudie</name>	Miss Maudie	Min	We need to get her back into circulation.” “I know this. Trouble is, [MASK], she got piss-poor guardians.” “Well, don’t look at me. I ain’t fixin to die yet just to be her guardian ...
<name>Casey</name>	Casey	Ruby	“Yeh, I know there’s a connection,” [MASK] sighed, releasing her hands and dropping forward. “Pass the carafe.” “Has the executive committee decided to take on the nuclear issue?” “I voted it down. Wait!
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Obie	But he leaned over him, his sleeves falling in [MASK]’s face, and opened the window. “Breathe deep, really deep, and I’ll have you weeping in no time. Breathe deep. Too bad the air’s so bad in this town.
<name>Cheryl</name>	Cheryl	Jan	Add to that the fact that you never do a bit of work, put up a bit of money, or ever are prepared to do or be anything but a garden-variety ambitious careerist.” “Plus, you're not even a resident,” [MASK] inserted.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Campbell	“[MASK] will want to check the fact sheet. He’s a bug about documentation.” “I know. I’ve typed that up on the blue sheets.” The older brother took the opportunity to lift his brows and dart his eyes in the direction of the informer.
<name>he</name>	he	Buster	Now he was lifting his pocket watch up like a yo-yo. Maybe it wasn’t as late as [MASK] had thought. Maybe the wrist watch was just a piece of jewelry, something he wore to complete his ensemble and the vest pocket timepiece the functional piece.
<name>her</name>	her	Velma	Not that her talents ran in the peace-making vein. But there’d been fewer opportunities for splinterings with her around, popping up anywhere at any time to raise a question, audit a class, monitor a meeting, confront or cooperate. It was all of a piece with [MASK] around.
<name>Mrs. Long</name>	Mrs. Long	Min	Cause love won’t let you let’m go.” “But they want to go, that’s the hurting part.” “Like you tole the lap sitter this morning, [MASK], when you hurt, hurt.
<name>Ignatius</name>	Ignatius	Meadows	The trumpeteer carried a beaded evening bag that looked antique. He might be somebody’s father. [MASK] had never been to a Mardi Gras, maybe this was how one dressed for it. The mannish mix- matched socks, though, relieved him. Surely this was a joke.
<name>Eurydice</name>	Eurydice	Y’Bird	But lying there on her back she was upright in the wet street, a Babel of paths before her, but her choice made long ago. The fork in the road. The wishbone. The switch. The water witch wand. The slingshot. [MASK].
<name>Yippie</name>	Yippie	Velma	“You seem the same, [MASK]. Crazy as ever.” Looking at the tables tumbled down with leaflets and pamphlets, the boxes of rolled-up posters, the mimeo machine in the middle of the living room. “Same o same o, hunh?”
<name>Dirk</name>	Dirk	Obie	[MASK] had been bobbing around in the whirlpool when the thunder struck, shaking the building. Bobbing around in the swirling waters, breathing along with the water’s pulse, with the pumping jets that throbbed against the back of his shoulders and the soles of his feet.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Buster	And his father’s sun tan, like a carnival mask with loose stringing, slipped a bit to the side of his face and [MASK] thought it might be time to check his prescription. That wasn’t exactly the like. But to hell with like.
<name>her ex-husband</name>	her ex-husband	Sonny	He did not embrace her closely and whisper any of the men-comforting things guaranteed to set her teeth on edge, remembering [MASK], her ex-husband: “Don’t worry about it” or “You’re overreacting, woman” or “Let’s talk about this calmly, baby.”
<name>Edy</name>	Edy	Cynthia	Because it was all right now. And this was the real thing. And she was about to know or maybe already knew something her smart-ass friend [MASK], for all her knowing, would probably never know.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Palma	and she blew her turn, someone else taking up the “And who chartered buses for . . matriarchal currency, the sign on the table had read. And she’d purchased the cowrie-shell bracelets for [MASK] less as a memento more as a criticism.
<name>Sal</name>	Sal	Obie	[MASK] squinted. “What?” “A good cry, man. Good for the eyes, the sinuses, the heart. The body needs to throw off its excess salt for balance. Too little salt and wounds can’t heal.
<name>he</name>	he	Donaldson	He’d almost blown it, so anxious to pull from the joker in the Pit Stop diner who had seemed to know a lot about the vets who ran the Academy’s sports programs for the kids, and the vets being prime suspects, [MASK] had aroused suspicion.
<name>Warren</name>	Warren	Baby	“We’re talking about trust, the loss of trust, breakdowns on the afrophone, misleadings and misreadings. [MASK]. I’m sorry.” He kissed her before the light changed but it didn’t help any. It was too late for anything but war.
<name>Jake</name>	Jake	Bloods	And when the white boy quit lynching niggers and became a nigger, that was the beginning of the Wild Bill Dogget revival and the beginning of [MASK] wearing Blues Brothers emblems. When O when will confusion end, my sistuh.
<name>Don Juan</name>	Don Juan	Doc	[MASK] listened to the smart click click of his Spanish boots on the tiles. He nodded toward the maintenance crew in such a way as to signal he didn't much appreciate their lollygagging around the juice bar. He bowed deeply whenever he met one of the women workers he thought needed his special brand of attentiveness.
<name>Rasheed</name>	Rasheed	Ruby	It’s embarrassing, cool as I am, having a jerk for a relative.” “And what is the Brotherhood up to?” “You know better than me.’’ [MASK] shrugged and once again their eyes bounced away.
<name>Severus</name>	Severus	Jan	Not only natural but mutagenic.” “You’re not suggesting—no, of course he’s not suggesting, is he, [MASK], that this is toasted pluto buns, just correcting my faulty mutually exclusive formula.”
<name>Napoleon</name>	Napoleon	Napoleon	Good for the eyes, the sinuses, the heart. The body needs to throw off its excess salt for balance. Too little salt and wounds can’t heal. Remember [MASK]’s army? Those frogs were dropping dead from scratches because their bodies were deprived of salt.
<name>Meadows</name>	Meadows	Dreamer	[MASK]? The dream is real, my friends. The failure to make it work is the unreality.’’Meadows was out of earshot, but the words still resonated. His city and his country mind drew together to ponder it all.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Velma	“Who saved your ass—and never got reimbursed for toll calls, postage or gas?” Who trudged through dust, through rain, through mud, through the corridors of the Chinese pajamas. [MASK] rubbed her forehead and leaned back in her chair . . .
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Wanda	And near the crater that had been their home was the pit that had been the elevator shaft down which he’d dropped Sen-Sen wrappers and matchbooks with phone numbers on them lest [MASK] jump salty with him. And down at the bottom of the shaft the other dumpage.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Ruby	“Got zapped by the microwave?” she asked, suspicious. [MASK] swiveled the plate a bit, reared back and screwed up her face. “Is it organic?” She poked the cake with the tip of her fork. “Or carcinogenic or what?”
<name>Clay</name>	Clay	Harden	Bake. [MASK]. Cure.” “Oh, clay.” The women clamped their mouths shut, waiting for the hot pepper to register. The kids in on the joke hunched the others. “Mighty powerful pickling to get past all that foul sewerage.”
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Ruby	All four legs of [MASK]’s chair thudded down against the tile. “1 think she’s lost her marbles. Know what she asked me the other night? Suicide. When is it appropriate to commit suicide. Appropriate, I remember that was how she put it.
<name>He</name>	He	Obie	She might catch fire any minute, break the vessel, and all he knew of her drain off, become ignited, burn away. [MASK] held on to the window jamb and tried to exhale his chest and stomach flat. five
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Roger	“Don’t pay’m no mind, mister.” A woman in housecoat and slippers grabbed the beast by his collar, dragging him back from the gate, mashing his head down between her knees. “Shush, [MASK], shush.” She was holding a bag of garbage.
<name>He</name>	He	Cecile	It had sounded so loud, so ominous. “This place so ramjam with people, how can I work out without an elbow in my neighbor’s ribs?” [MASK] was studying the menu, wondering whether the oysters could be trusted.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Fred	The other passengers shrugging back in answer, satisfied it was just birds, and that they flew their own way, but baffled by the outburst of the woman standing up. [MASK] eyed her in the mirror, his stomach settled for a moment.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Velma	Her lips soft against each other, [MASK] was searching for a way to finish the sentence, wondering if indeed it was already complete. “Well,” she said, and this time she was dumping cigarette case, lighter, address book and pen into her bag and rising to go.
<name>Benny</name>	Benny	Cecile	And she was falling, coming up out of her shoes, leaning toward the clouds of too-purple smoke from the chemical plants’ stacks. And then he was there, helping her into a cab and [MASK] shouting something at her as she stumbled, cracking on her shoes.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Velma	“[MASK]?” She stood up again, certain that she was leaving a red-brown smear on the chair. “Who’s called in every time there’s work to be done, coffee made, a program sold?
<name>Assata</name>	Assata	Roland	Mopping up her own blood when the police arrived. A Black woman, forty-six years old, four children, her husband in the reserves for nine days. [MASK] climbing in the window, stepping over bikes, skateboards, stacks of comics, a burnt-out TV.
<name>Marlena</name>	Marlena	Velma	“Testing my tolerance before you come clean?” They walked in silence to the corner and [MASK] noted how different things looked and felt now that it had been said. A subtle rearrangement of the world. For a while she had begun to doubt her perception of everything.
<name>God</name>	God	Lord	Hope you see how your humble servant got her hands overfull with both the quick, not so quick and the dead. So when I petition you, [MASK], with feeble praise and bold requests, don’t turn me down now, gotta help me and answer my prayers.”
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Nadeen	[MASK] held a chair and steadied herself. The baby, rushing from the front of her, had slammed into her back, turned and was now shifting around trying to distribute its weight. She closed her eyes and panted one two, one two.
