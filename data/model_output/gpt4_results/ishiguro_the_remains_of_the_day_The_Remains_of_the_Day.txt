<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Stevens	His glass, in any case, was empty and so I started towards him. He seemed greatly cheered at the prospect of my arrival and held out his glass. 'I think it's admirable that you're a nature-lover, [MASK],' he said, as I served him. '
<name>Reggie</name>	Reggie	Stevens	'Jolly grateful to you, [MASK]. Let me know how you get on.' I was, as you might imagine, a little taken aback by this request and ordinarily the matter might have been one I would have spent some time pondering.
<name>Stevens</name>	Stevens	Stevens	And it was then, I believe, that his lordship said as he looked down again into his volume and awkwardly fingered an entry: 'These errors may be trivial in themselves, [MASK], but you must yourself realize their larger significance.
<name>Stevens</name>	Stevens	Stevens	Beyond this, however, I had little chance to gain any impression of the atmosphere, for no sooner had I entered than his lordship was taking the tray from me, saying: 'Thank you, [MASK], I'll see to it. That'll be all.'
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	He must not be asked to perform tasks in any area where an error might jeopardize the success of our forthcoming conference.' 'Indeed not, sir. I fully understand.' 'Good. I'll leave you to think about it then, [MASK].'
<name>Rosa</name>	Rosa	Lisa	I excused myself and proceeded to make my exit. Now that I have recalled this episode of the dismissing of the Jewish employees, I am reminded of what could, I suppose, be called a curious corollary to that whole affair: namely, the arrival of the housemaid called [MASK].
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	It must be most trying under the present pressures.' 'Of course, this is far beyond the call of duty, [MASK].' 'I will do my best, sir. I may, however, have difficulty finding the appropriate moment to convey such information.'
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	Why, you may as well ask a committee of the mothers' union to organize a war campaign.' There was open, hearty laughter at this remark, during which his lordship muttered: 'Thank you, [MASK],' thus enabling me to take my leave.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Stevens	Then, as I passed him, he would say: 'Oh, [MASK], there was something I meant to say to you.' And with that, he would wander back into his study, to all appearances still thoroughly engrossed in the volume held open in his hands.
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Stevens	'[MASK], are you all right?' 'Yes, sir. Perfectly.' 'You look as though you're crying.' I laughed and taking out a handkerchief, quickly wiped my face. 'I'm very sorry, sir.
<name>Stevens</name>	Stevens	Stevens	I found myself making my way through the guests, a bottle of port upon my tray. I had just finished serving a glass to a gentleman when a voice behind me said: 'Ah, [MASK], you're interested in fish, you say.'
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	I mean to say, he's been like a second father to me. I hardly need to tell you, [MASK].' 'No, sir.' 'I care deeply for him.' 'Yes, sir.' 'And I know you do too.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	Thank you, madam.' 'And you and your staff did well also.' 'Thank you most kindly, madam.' 'At one point during dinner, [MASK], I would have sworn you were at least three people,' she said and laughed.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Stevens	I'm not proposing anything, [MASK]. Quite frankly, I don't know what's to be done. But you might at least be curious.' He was silent for a moment, during which time he seemed to be gazing emptily at the area of carpet around my feet.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	Now, [MASK], I don't suppose the Prime Minister is presently in the drawing room, is he?' The Prime Minister, sir?' 'Oh, it's all right, you don't have to tell me. I understand you're in a tricky position.'
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Catherine	It was a shock to come out here and find myself married. For a long time, I was very unhappy, very unhappy indeed. But then year after year went by, there was the war, [MASK] grew up, and one day I realized I loved my husband.
<name>Stevens</name>	Stevens	Giffen	As I remember, [MASK]'s appeared at the beginning of the twenties, and I am sure I am not alone in closely associating its emergence with that change of mood within our profession - that change which came to push the polishing of silver to the position of central importance it still by and large maintains today.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Stevens	We're always the last, [MASK]. Always the last to be clinging on to outmoded systems. But sooner or later, we'll need to face up to the facts. Democracy is something for a bygone era. The world's far too complicated a place now for universal suffrage and such like.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	He put it rather well.' 'I believe, sir, he compared the present parliamentary system to a committee of the mothers' union attempting to organize a war campaign.' 'Exactly, [MASK]. We are, quite frankly, behind the times in this country.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stevens	He seated himself at his desk and, as usual, resorted to holding open a book - this time it was Who's Who - turning a page to and fro. 'Oh, [MASK],' he began with a false air of nonchalance, but then seemed at a loss how to continue.
<name>Hastings</name>	Hastings	Stevens	A heavy air of preoccupation hung over him for days after his return, and I recall once, in reply to my inquiring how he had enjoyed his trip, his remarking: 'Disturbing, [MASK]. Deeply disturbing. It does us great discredit to treat a defeated foe like this.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	Yes, sir.' 'I do wish you'd sit down, [MASK]. I want us to talk as friends, and you're standing there holding that blasted tray looking like you're about to wander off any second.' 'I'm sorry, sir.'
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Stevens	As I went past, muttering a quiet 'excuse me, madam,' she turned and said: 'Oh, [MASK], perhaps you're the one to tell me. This arch here looks seventeenth century, but isn't it the case that it was built quite recently?
<name>Rose</name>	Rose	Lisa	[MASK] had been with us for some eight or nine months -and I had largely forgotten her existence by this point -when she vanished from the house together with the second footman. Now, of course, such things are simply part and parcel of life for any butler of a large household.
<name>Inspector</name>	Inspector	Stevens	'Just a minute.' The young gentleman reached down into the attach^ case at his feet and brought out a notebook and pencil. 'Fire away, [MASK].' I coughed again and set my voice into as impersonal a tone as I could manage.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	Awfully decent of you. Look here, there's no need to make a song and dance of it. Just convey the basic facts and be done with it. Simple approach is the best, that's my advice, [MASK].' 'Yes, sir.
<name>God</name>	God	Goodness	Quite trivial in themselves - at least so far. But they're of the sort I would never have made before, and I know what they signify. [MASK] knows. I've tried and tried, but it's no use. I've given what I had to give.
<name>Stevens</name>	Stevens	Stevens	This was why, then, I decided it appropriate to put the fork down on to the table with a certain emphasis, causing my employer to start a second time, look up and mutter again: 'Ah, [MASK].'
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Stevens	He barely glanced up from his volume as he asked: 'Your father feeling better now, [MASK]?' 'I'm glad to say he has made a full recovery, sir.' 'Jolly pleased to hear that. Jolly pleased.'
<name>Wigan</name>	Wigan	Mursden	Perhaps '[MASK]' will ring a bell for you, as it did for me upon my first spotting it on the road atlas yesterday. In fact, I must say I was even tempted to make a slight detour from my planned route just to see the village.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	However, in view of the fact that you have your column to complete, I wonder if it is entirely wise to partake further.' 'My column will be fine, [MASK]. Do get me a little more brandy, there's a good fellow.'
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	His lordship is in deep waters. I've watched him swimming further and further out and let me tell you, I'm getting very anxious. He's out of his depth, you see, [MASK].' 'Is that so, sir?'
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Stevens	'I'm sorry, sir, I don't fully understand what it is you're referring to.' 'You don't understand, [MASK]. Well, we're friends and so I'll put it to you frankly.
<name>Inspector</name>	Inspector	Stevens	If you will indulge me by listening, I would be most grateful. But I am afraid this will have to wait for another occasion.' 'Well, I shall look forward to it, [MASK]. Though I'm more of a fish man myself.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Harry	Having strong opinions and such.' 'Ah, yes, dignity. I was forgetting. Yes, so [MASK] was trying to tackle philosophical definitions. My word. I take it it was a lot of rot.' 'His conclusions were not necessarily those that compelled agreement, sir.'
<name>Hastings</name>	Hastings	Stevens	I believe I was collecting my thoughts for a renewed effort when the young gentleman suddenly rose to his feet, and clutching his attache case to his person, said: 'Well, I think I'll go and take a little fresh air. Thanks for your help, [MASK].'
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Stevens	But we could still have chaps like you taking messages back and forth, bringing tea, that sort of thing. Otherwise, how would we ever get anything done? Can you imagine it, [MASK]? All of us rooted in the soil? Just imagine it!'
<name>Wemmick</name>	Wemmick	Butler	'[MASK],' he said, once we were in the hall, 'I wonder if I could have my feet changed. They are giving me so much discomfort now, I can hardly listen to these gentlemen.'
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	At one point, the German countess emerged from the midst of the gentlemen and before I had had a chance to serve her, began helping herself to some port from my tray. 'You will compliment the cook for me, [MASK],' she said.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stevens	His lordship has worked wonders to bring this meeting about, and he believes - faithfully believes - he's doing something good and honourable. Do you know why his lordship has brought these gentlemen here tonight? Do you know, [MASK], what is going on here?'
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	His lordship paused and went on studying his page. 'Do I understand, sir,' I said, 'that you wish me to convey the information to the young gentleman?' 'If you don't mind, [MASK]. Be an awful lot off my mind.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	But you might at least be curious.' He was silent for a moment, during which time he seemed to be gazing emptily at the area of carpet around my feet. 'Sure you won't join me in a drink, [MASK]?' he said eventually.
<name>Education</name>	Education	Dignity	You'll excuse me, sir, but like I said before, we don't stand on ceremony here when it comes to expressing opinions. And that's my opinion for what it's worth. [MASK]'s not just something for gentlemen.'
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	The few people qualified to know what's what are talked to a standstill by ignorant people all around them. What do you make of it, [MASK]?' The nation does seem to be in a regrettable condition, sir.' 'I'll say.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	He really believes there's a terrible misunderstanding on the Prime Minister's part concerning the present German regime.' 'I cannot see what there is to object to in that, sir. His lordship has always striven to aid better understanding between nations.' 'And that's not all, [MASK].
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	'Indeed, sir?' 'Indeed, [MASK]. I'd told her you were the real thing. A real old English butler. That you'd been in this house for over thirty years, serving a real English lord.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	I may, however, have difficulty finding the appropriate moment to convey such information.' 'I'd be very grateful if you'd even try, [MASK]. Awfully decent of you. Look here, there's no need to make a song and dance of it.
<name>Stevens</name>	Stevens	Stevens	'But dammit, [MASK], why did you tell her such a tale?' I considered the situation for a moment, then said: 'I'm very sorry, sir. But it is to do with the ways of this country.'
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	'Look here, [MASK], the first of the delegates will be arriving here in less than a fortnight.' 'We are well prepared, sir.' 'What happens within this house after that may have considerable repercussions.' 'Yes, sir.'
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lisa	She seemed to take particular pleasure in assigning [MASK] some task or other that required a little extra responsibility, and if I were watching, she would be sure to try and catch my eye with her rather mocking expression.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	Made me look pretty much a fool, as you can imagine.' 'It's most regrettable, sir.' 'I mean to say, [MASK], this is a genuine grand old English house, isn't it? That's what I paid for.
<name>Wodehouse</name>	Wodehouse	Stevens	'Hate to bother you, [MASK],' he said. 'But I couldn't trouble you to fetch a little more brandy, could I? The bottle you brought in earlier appears to be finished.' 'You are very welcome to whatever refreshments you care for, sir.
<name>Henrietta</name>	Henrietta	Nellie	Passing me, she swooped up the hen in her arms and proceeded to cradle it as she apologized to me again. When I assured her no harm had been done, she said: 'I do thank you for stopping and not running poor [MASK] over.
<name>Timothy</name>	Timothy	Stevens	Thank you, sir.' 'Look here, [MASK], have there been any - well - signs at all? I mean signs to tell us your father may be wishing his burden lightened somewhat? Apart from this business of him falling, I mean.'
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	The young gentleman seemed to find this an amusing thought. He gave a laugh, then on further thought laughed some more. I joined him in his laughter. Then he nudged me and said: 'Can you imagine it, [MASK]?' and laughed again.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	The last time I was here, I think it was winter then too. I say, [MASK], are you sure you're all right there?' 'Perfectly all right, thank you, sir.' 'Not feeling unwell, are you?'
<name>Hastings</name>	Hastings	Stevens	Initially, he made rather general conversation, inquiring if all was well around the house and so on. Then he said: 'I've been doing a great deal of thinking, [MASK]. A great deal of thinking. And I've reached my conclusion.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	Have you noticed this. [MASK]? Have you noticed this is what has been happening for the last three or four years at least?' 'I'm sorry, sir, I have failed to notice any such development.' 'Haven't you even had a suspicion?
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	'You know, [MASK],' he said, 'we've been friends for some time now, haven't we?' 'Indeed, sir.' 'I always look forward to a little chat with you whenever I come here.' '
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	'Sir?' 'It's just that one has so much of importance on one's mind just now.' 'I would be very glad to be of assistance, sir.' 'I'm sorry to bring up a thing like this, [MASK].
<name>Albus</name>	Albus	Stevens	How could you not have seen it? The way they've used it, manipulated it, turned something fine and noble into something else - something they can use for their own foul ends? You must have seen it, [MASK].'
<name>Equality</name>	Equality	Dignity	[MASK]'s something every man and woman in this country can strive for and get. You'll excuse me, sir, but like I said before, we don't stand on ceremony here when it comes to expressing opinions. And that's my opinion for what it's worth.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Stevens	The man in the street can't be expected to know enough about politics, economics, world commerce and what have you. And why should he? In fact, you made a very good reply last night, [MASK]. How did you put it?
<name>Orwell</name>	Orwell	Harry	I'd say. People do have a political conscience of sorts here. They feel they ought to have strong feelings on this and that, just as [MASK] urges them to. But really, they're no different from people anywhere. They want a quiet life.
<name>Grindelwald</name>	Grindelwald	Hitler	If [MASK] had had things his way, we'd just be slaves now. The whole world would be a few masters and millions upon millions of slaves. And I don't need to remind anyone here, there's no dignity to be had in being a slave.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	That I was making it up about all these features going back centuries.' 'Indeed, sir?' 'She kept asserting everything was "mock" this and "mock" that. She even thought you were "mock", [MASK].'
<name>Albus</name>	Albus	Stevens	And you must have seen it, [MASK]. How could you not have seen it? The way they've used it, manipulated it, turned something fine and noble into something else - something they can use for their own foul ends?
<name>Stevens</name>	Stevens	Stevens	Are you content, [MASK],' he said finally, 'to watch his lordship go over the precipice just like that?' 'I'm sorry, sir, I don't fully understand what it is you're referring to.'
<name>Stevens</name>	Stevens	Stevens	It is worth pointing out, furthermore, that his lordship had by that time severed all links with the 'blackshirts', having witnessed the true, ugly nature of that organization. 'Oh, [MASK],' he had said to me. '
<name>Poirot</name>	Poirot	Dupont	Last thing we wanted really.' 'M. [MASK] has arrived here at this house, sir?' 'About half an hour ago. He's in the most foul temper.' 'Excuse me, sir. I must attend to him straight away.'
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Harry	Then turning back to me, he added: 'So we can have our talk after all. Though [MASK] here won't have the satisfaction of witnessing my humiliation.' There was laughter, and another exchange of good nights before I was at last allowed to ascend to the sanctuary of this room.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	'No, sir.' 'I care deeply for him.' 'Yes, sir.' 'And I know you do too. Care deeply for him. Don't you, [MASK]?' 'I do indeed, sir.' 'Good.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	'Very well, sir.' 'Tell me, [MASK], we have a few on the staff at the moment, don't we? Jews, I mean.' 'I believe two of the present staff members would fall into that category, sir.'
<name>Reggie</name>	Reggie	Stevens	'Yes, I'm sure the grounds are not at their best just now. But to be perfectly frank, [MASK], I wasn't paying much attention to the glories of nature. It's all rather worrying.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Stevens	I'm afraid I have not noticed any such development.' 'But I suppose you wouldn't, [MASK], because you're not curious. You just let all this go on before you and you never think to look at it for what it is.'
<name>Stevens</name>	Stevens	Stevens	Coming out of the blue as it did, I did not quite know how to reply to such a suggestion. I recall thanking him for his consideration, but quite probably I said nothing very definite, for my employer went on: 'I'm serious, [MASK].
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	Would you believe it, [MASK]?' 'Indeed, sir.' 'We're really so slow in this country to recognize when a thing's outmoded. Other great nations know full well that to meet the challenges of each new age means discarding old, sometimes well-loved methods.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	'Oh, just some tea for now, [MASK]. Who's his lordship expecting tonight?' 'I'm sorry, sir. I'm afraid I am unable to help you.' 'No idea at all?' 'I'm sorry, sir.'
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Stevens	'I'd never have figured you for such a lady's man, [MASK],' he went on. 'Keeps the spirit young, I guess. But then I really don't know it's right for me to be helping you with such dubious assignations.'
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	'I'm afraid not, sir.' 'You're afraid not. Tell me, [MASK], don't you care at all? Aren't you curious? Good God, man, something very crucial is going on in this house.
<name>Wemmick</name>	Wemmick	Stevens	'I'm sorry, sir?' 'Nature, [MASK]. We were talking the other day about the wonders of the natural world. And I quite agree with you, we are all much too complacent about the great wonders that surround us.' '
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Nellie	It's so good you stopped for [MASK], sir. If you'd care to come in for a cup of tea, now that you've got out and everything, you'd be most welcome. It would set you on your way.' '
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Harry	As you probably guessed, that's all nonsense, of course. [MASK]'s always going around trying to work everybody up over issues. But the truth is, people are happier left alone.' We were silent again for a moment or two.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	'About half an hour ago. He's in the most foul temper.' 'Excuse me, sir. I must attend to him straight away.' 'Of course, [MASK]. Well, kind of you to have come out to talk to me.'
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	Quite a little aquarium it was. I say, [MASK], are you all right?' I smiled again. 'Quite all right, thank you, sir.' 'As you so rightly pointed out, I really should come back here in the spring.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Stevens	You've seen it yourself, haven't you, [MASK]? The way they've manipulated something fine and noble. You've seen it yourself, haven't you?' 'I'm sorry, sir, but I can't say I have.'
<name>Stevens</name>	Stevens	Stevens	It was then, gazing up at me, that he said: 'You realize, [MASK], I don't expect you to be locked up here in this house all the time I'm away. Why don't you take the car and drive off somewhere for a few days?
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Harry	They want a quiet life. [MASK] has a lot of ideas about changes to this and that, but really, no one in the village wants upheaval, even if it might benefit them. People here want to be left alone to lead their quiet little lives.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	'Ah.' His lordship paused for a moment, staring out of his window. 'Of course, you'll have to let them go.' 'I beg your pardon, sir?' 'It's regrettable, [MASK], but we have no choice.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	There is a similar custom as regards our profession, sir.' 'Well, I only wish I'd known about your custom before, [MASK],' my employer said, leaning back in his chair. 'It certainly made me look like a chump.'
<name>Stevens</name>	Stevens	Stevens	'I suppose it wasn't you making that crowing noise this morning, [MASK]?' My employer was referring, I realized, to a pair of gypsies gathering unwanted iron who had passed by earlier making their customary calls.
<name>Prendick</name>	Prendick	Andrews	Then he came towards the table and stopped, standing to attention before me as though reporting to an officer in the army. The name's [MASK], sir,' he said. 'A very good evening to you.
<name>tortoise</name>	tortoise	Nellie	'I'm so grateful you didn't run over our [MASK], sir. Three years ago a tortoise of ours got killed like that and on just about this very spot. We were all very upset over that.' 'How very tragic,' I said, sombrely.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	As it happened, I emerged a little late and I fear I rather startled the young gentleman, who immediately pulled his attache case away from me and clutched it to his chest with both arms. 'I'm very sorry, sir.' 'My goodness, [MASK].
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	'OK, [MASK], so you don't wish to divulge past confidences. But does that extend to you actually denying having worked for anyone other than me?' 'It does seem a little extreme when you put it that way, sir.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	That's very kind of you, sir. But no, thank you, I won't.' 'I say, [MASK], are you all right there?' 'Perfectly all right, thank you, sir,' I said with a small laugh.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Lisa	Very interesting you should have been so pessimistic about her. Because [MASK] is a pretty girl, no doubt about it. And I've noticed you have a curious aversion to pretty girls being on the staff.' 'You know perfectly well you are talking nonsense.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Kenton	I can recall spotting from some distance - long before reaching the steps where my father had once fallen -Miss [MASK]'s figure moving about inside the summerhouse. When I entered she had seated herself on one of the wicker chairs scattered around its interior, evidently engaged in some needlework.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stevens	'Tell me, [MASK], aren't you struck by even the remote possibility that I am correct? Are you not, at least, curious about what I am saying?' 'I'm sorry, sir, but I have to say that I have every trust in his lordship's good judgement.'
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Lindsay	Well, I can tell you, sir, he soon learnt otherwise. A lot of hard thinking and talking goes on in this place. There's plenty of good strong opinion around and people here aren't shy about expressing it. That's something your Mr [MASK] learnt quickly enough.'
