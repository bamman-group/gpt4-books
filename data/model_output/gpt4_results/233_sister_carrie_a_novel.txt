<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Drouet	The scene was one in “The Covenant,” in which the wife listened to the seductive voice of a lover in the absence of her husband. “Served him right,” said [MASK] afterward, even in view of her keen expiation of her error.
<name>Dexter</name>	Dexter	Hurstwood	“I thought she just bought one,” he said. “That was just something for evening wear,” returned his wife complacently. “It seems to me,” returned [MASK], “that she's spending a good deal for dresses of late.”
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Carrie	In due time they reached the depot, and after helping her out he handed the man a five-dollar bill and hurried on. “You wait here,” he said to [MASK], when they reached the waiting-room, “while I get the tickets.”
<name>She</name>	She	Carrie	Other things followed from time to time, little things of the same sort, which in their cumulative effect were eventually equal to a full revelation. [MASK] was not dull by any means. Two persons cannot long dwell together without coming to an understanding of one another.
<name>Snipes</name>	Snipes	Hurstwood	“You all go in together.” “Humph!” ejaculated [MASK], who had been so sturdily displaced. “This here Single Tax is the thing,” said another. “There ain't going to be no order till it comes.”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Hurstwood	They went out, and at the corner the commonplace Irish individual was standing, eyeing him. [MASK] could scarcely refrain from showing that he knew of this chap's presence. The insolence in the fellow's eye was galling.
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Hurstwood	The mental effect of the thing had not gone, however, and never would entirely. She had an ideal to contrast men by--particularly men close to her. During all this time--a period rapidly approaching three years--[MASK] had been moving along in an even path.
<name>Harley</name>	Harley	Carrie	“It is for you to say whom you want with you. As I say, all that can be arranged to suit yourself.” He bowed and backed toward the door. “At four, then, we may expect you?” “Yes,” said [MASK].
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Carrie	The muscles so held irritated a few nerves, and now a vague scene floated in on the drowsy mind. She fancied she and [MASK] were somewhere beside an old coal-mine. She could see the tall runway and the heap of earth and coal cast out.
<name>Harney</name>	Harney	Hurstwood	said the latter, with a volume of affected shrewdness and assurance. “Yes,” said [MASK] calmly. He knew the type so thoroughly that some of his old familiar indifference to it returned. Such men as these were of the lowest stratum welcomed at the resort.
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Carrie	No round of amusement. Her sister carried with her most of the grimness of shift and toil. “Why, how are all the folks at home?” she began; “how is father, and mother?” [MASK] answered, but was looking away.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Carrie	Why had she lost it? “I know why you should be a success,” he said, another time, “if you had a more dramatic part. I've studied it out----” “What is it?” said [MASK].
<name>Carraway</name>	Carraway	Hurstwood	“Oh, I don't know,” returned [MASK]. “He's got the money, all right,” and a little twinkle passed over his eyes. “I don't go much on those things, do you?
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Carrie	Rent day gave him his opportunity. “Well,” he said, as he counted it out, “that's about the last of my money. I'll have to get something pretty soon.” [MASK] looked at him askance, half-suspicious of an appeal.
<name>She</name>	She	Carrie	“It won't be so very long now,” he said, remembering her in his relief. “We get there the first thing in the morning.” [MASK] scarcely deigned to reply. “I'll see if there is a dining-car,” he added.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Carrie	[MASK] noticed this, and it did not appeal to her. She wanted to be good-natured and sympathetic, but something about the man held her aloof. Toward evening he looked so badly in the weak light that she suggested he go to bed.
<name>John</name>	John	Hurstwood	If you want to reverse the car you turn it over here. If you want to send it forward, you put it over here. If you want to cut off the power, you keep it in the middle.” [MASK] smiled at the simple information.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Lola	Oh, wasn't it just fine! At last! The first, the long-hoped for, the delightful notice! And they called her clever. She could hardly restrain herself from laughing loudly. Had [MASK] seen it?
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Carrie	Being of a passive and receptive rather than an active and aggressive nature, [MASK] accepted the situation. Her state seemed satisfactory enough. Once in a while they would go to a theatre together, occasionally in season to the beaches and different points about the city, but they picked up no acquaintances.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Hurstwood	She sat down in one of the rocking-chairs, while [MASK] waited for the boy, who soon knocked. “Soap, towels, and a pitcher of ice-water.” “Yes, sir.”
<name>He</name>	He	Drouet	“It isn't true. Who told you that?” She was flushing scarlet to the roots of her hair, but [MASK] did not catch the full hue of her face, owing to the modified light of the room.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Carrie	I don't care. You needn't tell me that, though.” “I couldn't,” said [MASK], her colour rising. Then, seeing that he looked as if he said “I know,” she exclaimed: “Oh, all right.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Carrie	He was an exceedingly genial soul, this young man, and wholly free of affectation. It seemed to [MASK] he was as yet only overcoming the last traces of the bashfulness of youth. He did not seem apt at conversation, but he had the merit of being well dressed and wholly courageous.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Carrie	“Won't you come?” he said, beginning over and with a more reverent feeling. “You know I can't do without you--you know it--it can't go on this way--can it?” “I know,” said [MASK].
<name>Clarence</name>	Clarence	Carrie	At five the attorneys would have gone home. He still had the morrow until noon. Even as he thought, the last fifteen minutes passed away and it was five. Then he abandoned the thought of seeing them any more that day and turned to [MASK].
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Carrie	Accordingly he agreed to enter into partnership, and made over his thousand dollars, preparing to enter the next day. His first inclination was to be elated, and he confided to [MASK] that he thought he had made an excellent arrangement. Time, however, introduced food for reflection.
<name>Theron</name>	Theron	Hurstwood	This majesty of passion is possessed by nearly every man once in his life, but it is usually an attribute of youth and conduces to the first successful mating. [MASK], being an older man, could scarcely be said to retain the fire of youth, though he did possess a passion warm and unreasoning.
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Hurstwood	[MASK] noticed it, but felt in no position to quarrel with her. Several times she came so late as scarcely to have an hour in which to patch up a meal and start for the theatre. “Do you rehearse in the afternoons?”
<name>George</name>	George	Drouet	I was just looking for you.” “Supposing you get 'em and take 'em out to dinner?” “Sure,” said [MASK]. “Wait'll I go upstairs and change my clothes.” “Well, I'll be in the barber shop,” said the other.
<name>Woot</name>	Woot	Carrie	“I'm almost roasting,” said the girl. [MASK] looked into her pretty face, with its large blue eyes, and saw little beads of moisture. “There's more marching in this opera than ever I did before,” added the girl.
<name>Constance</name>	Constance	Carrie	“Let us go home,” she said. “No,” answered [MASK], her voice assuming for the first time a penetrating quality which it had never known. “Stay with him!” She pointed an almost accusing hand toward her lover.
<name>He</name>	He	Drouet	“Here,” she said, taking them out of the bureau drawer. “Now, come on,” he said. Thus the first hour of misgiving was swept away. It went this way on every occasion. [MASK] did not leave her much alone.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Carrie	The needle of understanding will yet point steadfast and unwavering to the distinct pole of truth. In [MASK]--as in how many of our worldlings do they not?--instinct and reason, desire and understanding, were at war for the mastery. She followed whither her craving led.
<name>She</name>	She	Carrie	For the moment all doubts were cleared away. “Yes,” she answered, frankly and tenderly. “Well, then you'll come, won't you--come to-night?” [MASK] shook her head in spite of her distress.
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Carrie	When she came to her own rooms, [MASK] saw their comparative insignificance. She was not so dull but that she could perceive they were but three small rooms in a moderately well-furnished boarding-house. She was not contrasting it now with what she had had, but what she had so recently seen.
<name>Archer</name>	Archer	Drouet	She wandered through the whole scene between herself and the intruding villain, straining the patience of the audience, and finally exiting, much to their relief. “She's too nervous,” said [MASK], feeling in the mildness of the remark that he was lying for once.
<name>He</name>	He	Hurstwood	She kept him at a distance in a rather earnest way, and submitted only to those tender tokens of affection which better become the inexperienced lover. [MASK] saw that she was not to be possessed for the asking, and deferred pressing his suit too warmly.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Drouet	She could not resist the glow of his temperament, the light of his eye. She could hardly keep from feeling what he felt. And yet she was not without thoughts which were disturbing. What did he know? What had [MASK] told him?
<name>Hurstwood</name>	Hurstwood	Hurstwood	She looked for no refuge in that direction. Nothing but sorrow was brought her by thoughts of [MASK], which would return. That he could have chosen to dupe her in so ready a manner seemed a cruel thing. Tuesday came, and with it appropriate indecision and speculation.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Lola	“Now, I've just enough to get on to the end of the week,” she confided. “Oh, I've got some,” said [MASK]. “I've got twenty-five dollars, if you need it.”
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Carrie	“You do fine, and the manager knows it.” To say the truth, [MASK] did unconsciously move about with an air pleasing and somewhat distinctive. It was due wholly to her natural manner and total lack of self-consciousness.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Carrie	Naturally dark of skin, gloom made him look slightly sinister. He was quite a disagreeable figure. [MASK] set the table and brought in the meal. “Dinner's ready,” she said, passing him for something. He did not answer, reading on.
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Carrie	Those guys out there don't amount to anything. What are you afraid of?” “I don't know,” said [MASK]. “I just don't seem to be able to do it.” She was grateful for the drummer's presence, though.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Carrie	It was blowing up cold, and out of her window [MASK] could see the western sky, still pink with the fading light, but steely blue at the top where it met the darkness. A long, thin cloud of pink hung in midair, shaped like some island in a far-off sea.
<name>Stuart</name>	Stuart	Carrie	he asked one Tuesday morning. “I do the best I can,” said [MASK]. Nothing was added to this at the moment, but the next day he said: “Do you ever go to the Gansevoort Market over here?”
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Lola	Meanwhile their own show closed May 5th. “Those that want to go with the show next season,” said the manager, “will have to sign this week.” “Don't you sign,” advised [MASK]. “I wouldn't go.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Drouet	Then she went back to the rocker to think. It was some time before she could collect her thoughts, but when she did, this truth began to take on importance. She was quite alone. Suppose [MASK] did not come back?
<name>Hurstwood</name>	Hurstwood	Hurstwood	“I believe I will,” she said, and then added: “I'll have to see first, though.” With the idea thus grounded, rent day approaching, and clothes calling for instant purchase, she soon found excuse in [MASK]'s lassitude.
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Hurstwood	When [MASK] returned he was not so elated as when he went away, and now she was obliged to drop practice and get dinner. Here was an early irritation. She would have her work and this. Was she going to act and keep house?
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Julia	“Did you notice,” he said, at last, breaking forth concerning another item which he had found, “that they have entered suit to compel the Illinois Central to get off the lake front, [MASK]?” he asked.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Carrie	His position was secure, his home-life, if not satisfactory, was at least undisturbed, his personal liberty rather untrammelled. [MASK]'s love represented only so much added pleasure. He would enjoy this new gift over and above his ordinary allowance of pleasure.
<name>Jude</name>	Jude	Hurstwood	On the outer rim the piles remained unmelted. [MASK], who could not get in the centre, stood with head lowered to the weather and bent his form. A light appeared through the transom overhead. It sent a thrill of possibility through the watchers.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Carrie	said [MASK], drawing away, but not removing her handkerchief from her eyes. “Never mind about this quarrel now. Let it go. You stay here until the month's out, anyhow, and then you can tell better what you want to do.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Carrie	He had fixed upon that region as an objective point. “Anyhow,” said [MASK], “I shouldn't want to get married as long as he is here. I wouldn't want to run away.”
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Hurstwood	“I think I am,” returned [MASK]. “Well, you'd better go sit down, then.” This he did, but soon grew rapidly worse. It seemed all he could do to crawl to his room, where he remained for a day.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Pearl	“You and [MASK] had no disagreement?” “No--yes; that is, we always have. Our social barometers always stand at 'cloudy' and 'overcast.'” “And whose fault is that?” she said, easily.
<name>Griffin</name>	Griffin	Hurstwood	[MASK] held to his brake and lever, pale and very uncertain what to do. “Stand back,” yelled one of the officers, leaning over the platform railing. “Clear out of this, now. Give the man a chance to do his work.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Hurstwood	They ran the car to the end and both got off. [MASK] went into the barn and sought a car step, pulling out his paper-wrapped lunch from his pocket. There was no water and the bread was dry, but he enjoyed it.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Carrie	The manager who was putting on the summer skit at the Casino had never heard of [MASK], but the several notices she had received, her published picture, and the programme bearing her name had some little weight with him. He gave her a silent part at thirty dollars a week.
<name>Corley</name>	Corley	Carrie	“Well,” he said, “I saw you across the street there. I thought it was you. I was just coming out to your place. How are you, anyhow?” “I'm all right,” said [MASK], smiling.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Minnie	It was difficult to speak to [MASK] about this, but at last she summoned the courage. “I don't know what I'm going to do about clothes,” she said one evening when they were together. “I need a hat.”
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Carrie	It blew up cold after a rain one afternoon when [MASK] was still without a jacket. She came out of the warm shop at six and shivered as the wind struck her. In the morning she was sneezing, and going down town made it worse.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Drouet	[MASK] looked at her wonderingly. For all his lack of dignity in such matters he did not know how to begin. He stared at her in the most flagrant manner until at last she said: “What makes you stare at me so? What's the matter?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Hurstwood	[MASK] made the best of a bad lot by keeping on his clothes and pushing away the dirty covering from his head, but at last he dozed in sheer weariness. The covering became more and more comfortable, its character was forgotten, and he pulled it about his neck and slept.
<name>Harris</name>	Harris	Hurstwood	He wanted some one who wasn't thinking of a choice or something better. Especially not an old man. He wanted some one young, active, and glad to work actively for a moderate sum. [MASK] did not please him at all.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Hurstwood	They had come out of the lobby and made their way through the showy crush about the entrance way. “Say, mister,” said a voice at [MASK]'s side, “would you mind giving me the price of a bed?”
<name>Archer</name>	Archer	Carrie	Nevertheless, his rousing availed him nothing. On Tuesday it was the same way. He did manage to bring himself into the mood to go out to [MASK], but when he got in Ogden Place he thought he saw a man watching him and went away.
<name>Archer</name>	Archer	Carrie	I said those are our regular rates. Like every other hotel we make special ones however. Possibly you have not thought about it, but your name is worth something to us.” “Oh!” ejaculated [MASK], seeing at a glance. “Of course.
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Hurstwood	There was a tenseness in [MASK]'s voice and manner which could but have some effect. She did not want anything to do with him. He was married, he had deceived her once, and now again, and she thought him terrible.
<name>He</name>	He	Hurstwood	I've got to have something.” The porter still gazed, trying to look indifferent. Then, seeing that [MASK] was about to go on, he said: “I've nothing to do with it. You'll have to ask inside.”
<name>She</name>	She	Carrie	[MASK] walked with him. Behold, the whole fabric of doubt and impossibility had slipped from her mind. She could not get at the points that were so serious, the things she was going to make plain to him. “Have you had lunch yet?
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Carrie	He succeeded with many who were not quite schooled in the art of love. He failed dismally where the woman was slightly experienced and possessed innate refinement. In the case of [MASK] he found a woman who was all of the latter, but none of the former.
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Carrie	Such trivialities, such praises of wealth, such conventional expression of morals as sifted through this passive creature's mind, fell upon [MASK] and for the while confused her. On the other hand, her own feelings were a corrective influence.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Carrie	You stay here until the month's out, anyhow, and then you can tell better what you want to do. Eh?” [MASK] made no answer. “You'd better do that,” he said. “There's no use your packing up now.
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Carrie	No further opportunity for conversation occurred, but the next evening, when they were getting ready for the stage, this girl appeared anew at her side. “They say this show is going on the road next month.” “Is it?” said [MASK].
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Carrie	“Do you want to see me?” he asked. “Do you need any help?” said [MASK], already learning directness of address. “Do you know how to stitch caps?” he returned. “No, sir,” she replied.
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Carrie	As for [MASK], she studied over the problem of finding clothes and amusement on fifty cents a week. She brooded over this until she was in a state of mental rebellion. “I'm going up the street for a walk,” she said after supper.
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Carrie	This retort angered [MASK]. She had had a dreary day of it herself. “You needn't talk like that,” she said. “Oh!” he exclaimed, pushing back from the table, as if to say more, but letting it go at that.
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Carrie	The best proof that there was something open and commendable about the man was the fact that [MASK] took the money. No deep, sinister soul with ulterior motives could have given her fifteen cents under the guise of friendship. The unintellectual are not so helpless.
<name>Mulligan</name>	Mulligan	Maitland	“By fours, right! Right, I said, right! For heaven's sake, get on to yourself! Right!” and in saying this he would lift the last sounds into a vehement roar. “[MASK]!
<name>Corley</name>	Corley	Carrie	“He wants to meet you. You play cards, don't you?” “A little,” said [MASK]. “Well, we'll have a game of cards. If your husband comes home bring him over.”
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Carrie	she began, and there was embrace of welcome. [MASK] realised the change of affectional atmosphere at once. Amid all the maze, uproar, and novelty she felt cold reality taking her by the hand. No world of light and merriment. No round of amusement.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Drouet	Yes, she went out just a few minutes ago.” “That's strange,” thought [MASK]. “She didn't say a word to me. I wonder where she went?” He hastened about, rummaging in his valise for what he wanted, and finally pocketing it.
<name>He</name>	He	Hurstwood	She did not move her eyes from the flat, open scene before her. [MASK] waited for a few moments, and then repeated the words. “You must not say that,” she said, weakly. Her words were not convincing at all.
<name>Jennie</name>	Jennie	Carrie	I'll get something again one of these days. Then she can go to the deuce.” He only said this in his anger, but it prefigured a possible course of action and attitude well enough. “I don't care,” thought [MASK].
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Carrie	“I'll not give him the rest of my money,” said [MASK]. “I do enough. I am going to get me something to wear.” As a matter of fact, during this second month she had been buying for herself as recklessly as she dared, regardless of the consequences.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Moy	He had been seen at the theatre with people whom he called [MASK]'s friends; now he was seen driving, and, most likely, would have an excuse for that. Perhaps there were others of whom she did not hear, or why should he be so busy, so indifferent, of late?
<name>Eveline</name>	Eveline	Carrie	“All right,” he said, brightening. He went down the steps and into his cab. [MASK] closed the door and ascended into her room. She undid her broad lace collar before the mirror and unfastened her pretty alligator belt which she had recently bought.
<name>Wilson</name>	Wilson	Hurstwood	“I don't want to get out,” said [MASK]. “When I get ready there'll be nothing to stop me for.” He turned back, and the detective watched him closely. It seemed an intolerable thing. Still he went on and into the room.
<name>John</name>	John	Drouet	[MASK] imagined that he must have misunderstood his friend. He did not attach particular importance to the information, after all. “What did he have to say?” he queried, with slightly increased curiosity. “He said he came because he thought I might be lonely.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Minnie	“She said she was going down to the foot of the stairs,” answered [MASK]. “I guess she just wants to look out a while.” “She oughtn't to be thinking about spending her money on theatres already, do you think?”
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Hurstwood	[MASK] seemed more apathetic than ever. He saw her off mornings to rehearsals and the like with the utmost calm. He read and read. Several times he found himself staring at an item, but thinking of something else.
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Carrie	Again, the business did not pay as well as he thought. It increased a little, but he found he would have to watch his household expenses, which was humiliating. In the very beginning it was a delight to go home late at night, as he did, and find [MASK].
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	George	He looked so disconsolate that it scared her. She began to see that she herself had been drifting. She had felt it all the time. “Well, [MASK],” she exclaimed, “why don't you get out and look for something?
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Carrie	How and wherefore were but indifferently dealt with. All the complications which led up to it were unknown. He was accused without being understood. Sitting in his room with [MASK] the same day, he decided to send the money back.
<name>She</name>	She	Carrie	There's a shadow about your eyes, too, which gives your face much this same character. It's in the depth of them, I think.” [MASK] looked straight into his face, wholly aroused. “You probably are not aware of it,” he added.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Kitty	Several of the men in the room exchanged compliments with the girls at long range. “Say, [MASK],” called one to a girl who was doing a waltz step in a few feet of space near one of the windows, “are you going to the ball with me?”
<name>Miss</name>	Miss	Carrie	You know what our restaurant is.” [MASK] looked at him quietly. She was wondering whether he took her to be a millionaire. “What are your rates?” she inquired. “Well, now, that is what I came to talk with you privately about.
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Carrie	“What is it they're going to play?” “'Under the Gaslight.'” “When?” “On the 16th.” “Well, why don't you?” asked [MASK]. “I don't know any one,” he replied.
<name>Kreisler</name>	Kreisler	Burnstein	How did you come out with that La Crosse man you were telling me about?” “Oh, fine; sold him a complete line. There was another fellow there, representing [MASK], a regular hook-nosed sheeny, but he wasn't in it.
