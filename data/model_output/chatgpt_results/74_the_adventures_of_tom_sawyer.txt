<name>Silas</name>	Silas	Tom	All who got this vague hint were cautioned to “be mum and wait.” About midnight [MASK] arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles, and stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the meeting-place. It was starlight, and very still.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Huck	He hid the lantern in [MASK]'s sugar hogshead and the watch began. An hour before midnight the tavern closed up and its lights (the only ones thereabouts) were put out. No Spaniard had been seen. Nobody had entered or left the alley.
<name>Ulalume</name>	Ulalume	Spirits	It was a lonely place, and an hour made solemn by old traditions. [MASK] whispered in the rustling leaves, ghosts lurked in the murky nooks, the deep baying of a hound floated up out of the distance, an owl answered with his sepulchral note.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Lord	[MASK], I hear 'em say he's the bloodiest looking villain in this country, and they wonder he wasn't ever hung before.” “Yes, they talk like that, all the time. I've heard 'em say that if he was to get free they'd lynch him.”
<name>Sidney</name>	Sidney	Tom	“Oh, auntie, my sore toe's mortified!” The old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little, then cried a little, then did both together. This restored her and she said: “[MASK], what a turn you did give me.
<name>Huck</name>	Huck	Tom	You mustn't be so bad. Water won't hurt you.” [MASK] was a trifle disconcerted. The basin was refilled, and this time he stood over it a little while, gathering resolution; took in a big breath and began.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Joe	[MASK] grumbled awhile; then he agreed with his friend that what daylight was left ought to be economized in getting things ready for leaving. Shortly afterward they slipped out of the house in the deepening twilight, and moved toward the river with their precious box.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Tom	“[MASK], we _got_ to keep mum. You know that. That Injun devil wouldn't make any more of drownding us than a couple of cats, if we was to squeak 'bout this and they didn't hang him.
<name>his son</name>	his son	Tom	He said he meant to look to it that [MASK] should be admitted to the National Military Academy and afterward trained in the best law school in the country, in order that he might be ready for either career or both.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Joe	[MASK] had not had time to get impatient before they were back again with some handsome bass, a couple of sun-perch and a small catfish--provisions enough for quite a family. They fried the fish with the bacon, and were astonished; for no fish had ever seemed so delicious before.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	The beetle lay there working its helpless legs, unable to turn over. [MASK] eyed it, and longed for it; but it was safe out of his reach. Other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in the beetle, and they eyed it too.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	Another tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep brought changes. The children awoke tortured with a raging hunger. [MASK] believed that it must be Wednesday or Thursday or even Friday or Saturday, now, and that the search had been given over.
<name>Aunt Sally</name>	Aunt Sally	auntie	and so I hove a brick through his window--but don't you tell.” “I won't. I couldn't meow that night, becuz [MASK] was watching me, but I'll meow this time. Say--what's that?”
<name>Mrs. Hale</name>	Mrs. Hale	Sid	But the boy's hand shook so that he spilled his coffee. “And you do talk such stuff,” [MASK] said. “Last night you said, 'It's blood, it's blood, that's what it is!' You said that over and over.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	The boys were all eaten up with envy--but those that suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too late that they themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by trading tickets to [MASK] for the wealth he had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	He held his candle aloft and said: “Look as far around the corner as you can. Do you see that? There--on the big rock over yonder--done with candle-smoke.” “[MASK], it's a _cross_!”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	[MASK], what's the matter with you?” “Oh, auntie, I'm--” “What's the matter with you--what is the matter with you, child?” “Oh, auntie, my sore toe's mortified!”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Huck	“What's that you got?” “Dead cat.” “Lemme see him, [MASK]. My, he's pretty stiff. Where'd you get him?” “Bought him off'n a boy.” “What did you give?”
<name>the man</name>	the man	Joe	he said. “It's a dirty business,” said [MASK], without moving. “What did you do it for?” “I! I never done it!” “Look here! That kind of talk won't wash.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Thomas	He said to himself, it is not possible that the boy can answer the simplest question--why _did_ the Judge ask him? Yet he felt obliged to speak up and say: “Answer the gentleman, [MASK]--don't be afraid.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	I believe it's better'n to be a pirate.” “Yes, it's better in some ways, because it's close to home and circuses and all that.” By this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole, [MASK] in the lead.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	At last [MASK] rose slowly and softly, and started alone. But the first step he made wrung such a hideous creak from the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead with fright. He never made a second attempt.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	[MASK] said: “Oh, please, auntie, don't pull it out. It don't hurt any more. I wish I may never stir if it does. Please don't, auntie. I don't want to stay home from school.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Huck	He sprung his secret about [MASK]'s share in the adventure in the finest dramatic manner he was master of, but the surprise it occasioned was largely counterfeit and not as clamorous and effusive as it might have been under happier circumstances.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	And you try and see if you can't be a good boy, for once, and you needn't take any more medicine.” [MASK] reached school ahead of time. It was noticed that this strange thing had been occurring every day latterly.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	She begged to see. [MASK] said: “Oh, it ain't anything.” “Yes it is.” “No it ain't. You don't want to see.” “Yes I do, indeed I do. Please let me.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	So she kept silence, and went about her affairs with a troubled heart. [MASK] sulked in a corner and exalted his woes. He knew that in her heart his aunt was on her knees to him, and he was morosely gratified by the consciousness of it.
<name>Undertaker</name>	Undertaker	Tom	I've always heard that.” “[MASK], I don't like to fool around much where there's dead people. A body's bound to get into trouble with 'em, sure.” “I don't like to stir 'em up, either.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Alfred	I don't care for them!” and burst into tears, and got up and walked away. [MASK] dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her, but she said: “Go away and leave me alone, can't you! I hate you!”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	[MASK] presently began to drift insensibly back into the concerns of this life again. What if he turned his back, now, and disappeared mysteriously? What if he went away--ever so far away, into unknown countries beyond the seas--and never came back any more!
<name>Napoleon</name>	Napoleon	Tom	These two great commanders did not condescend to fight in person--that being better suited to the still smaller fry--but sat together on an eminence and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through aides-de-camp. [MASK]'s army won a great victory, after a long and hard-fought battle.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Huck	He needn't have repeated it; once was enough; [MASK] was making thirty or forty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered. The boys never stopped till they reached the shed of a deserted slaughter-house at the lower end of the village.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Huck	Some of 'em's worth twenty dollars apiece--there ain't any, hardly, but's worth six bits or a dollar.” “No! Is that so?” “Cert'nly--anybody'll tell you so. Hain't you ever seen one, [MASK]?”
<name>Huckleberry</name>	Huckleberry	Tom	“I'm going to buy a new drum, and a sure'nough sword, and a red necktie and a bull pup, and get married.” “Married!” “That's it.” “[MASK], you--why, you ain't in your right mind.”
<name>Sue</name>	Sue	Tom	“It ain't a gal at all--it's a girl.” “It's all the same, I reckon; some says gal, some says girl--both's right, like enough. Anyway, what's her name, [MASK]?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Becky	Then [MASK] reflected a moment and said: “But what will mamma say?” “How'll she ever know?” The girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said reluctantly: “I reckon it's wrong--but--” “But shucks!
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Tom	“Oh, how _could_ I sleep! I wish I never, never had waked! No! No, I don't, [MASK]! Don't look so! I won't say it again.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	He took it up and disclosed a shapely little treasure-house whose bottom and sides were of shingles. In it lay a marble. [MASK]'s astonishment was bound-less! He scratched his head with a perplexed air, and said: “Well, that beats anything!”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Huck	“Could you see the rags by the light of the cigars?” This staggered [MASK] for a moment. Then he said: “Well, I don't know--but somehow it seems as if I did.” “Then they went on, and you--”
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Huck	[MASK] would not explain, further than to say that he already knew too much about one of those men and would not have the man know that he knew anything against him for the whole world--he would be killed for knowing it, sure.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	Monday morning always found him so--because it began another week's slow suffering in school. He generally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening holiday, it made the going into captivity and fetters again so much more odious. [MASK] lay thinking.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Huck	[MASK] waited what seemed a weary long time, but nothing happened. His faith was weakening. Was there any use? Was there really any use? Why not give it up and turn in? A noise fell upon his ear. He was all attention in an instant.
<name>she</name>	she	Amy	He did not hear what [MASK] was saying, and whenever she paused expectantly he could only stammer an awkward assent, which was as often misplaced as otherwise. He kept drifting to the rear of the schoolhouse, again and again, to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there.
<name>Miss Watson</name>	Miss Watson	Tom	[MASK] said. Yet notwithstanding all this, the boy grew more and more melancholy and pale and dejected. She added hot baths, sitz baths, shower baths, and plunges. The boy remained as dismal as a hearse.
<name>Blackbeard</name>	Blackbeard	Tom	He knows that would be a disgrace to a pirate, and [MASK]'s too proud for that sort of thing. He's up to something or other. Now I wonder what?” “Well, the things is ours, anyway, ain't they?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Tom	And she put her small hand upon his and a little scuffle ensued, [MASK] pretending to resist in earnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words were revealed: “_I love you_.” “Oh, you bad thing!”
<name>Bridget</name>	Bridget	Tom	There's no getting round it, you can work when you're a mind to, [MASK].” And then she diluted the compliment by adding, “But it's powerful seldom you're a mind to, I'm bound to say.
<name>Peter</name>	Peter	Tom	The spectacle took the general breath away. All gazed, nobody spoke for a moment. Then there was a unanimous call for an explanation. [MASK] said he could furnish it, and he did. The tale was long, but brimful of interest.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Joe	Misgivings came; they grew troubled and unhappy; a sigh or two escaped, unawares. By and by [MASK] timidly ventured upon a roundabout “feeler” as to how the others might look upon a return to civilization--not right now, but--
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Huckleberry	Somebody pinched his arm. He turned, and his eyes met [MASK]'s. Then both looked elsewhere at once, and wondered if anybody had noticed anything in their mutual glance. But everybody was talking, and intent upon the grisly spectacle before them. “Poor fellow!”
<name>Blackbeard</name>	Blackbeard	Tom	I've had dreams enough all night--with that patch-eyed Spanish devil going for me all through 'em--rot him!” “No, not rot him. _Find_ him! Track the money!” “[MASK], we'll never find him.
<name>Huck</name>	Huck	Tom	[MASK]'s whole structure of faith was shaken to its foundations. He had many a time heard of this thing succeeding but never of its failing before. It did not occur to him that he had tried it several times before, himself, but could never find the hiding-places afterward.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	[MASK] was a free boy again, however--there was something in that. He could drink and swear, now--but found to his surprise that he did not want to. The simple fact that he could, took the desire away, and the charm of it.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	But there was no getting around it--here were the certified checks, and they were good for their face. [MASK] was therefore elevated to a place with the Judge and the other elect, and the great news was announced from headquarters.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Tom	“It's a beautiful man--now make me coming along.” [MASK] drew an hour-glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it and armed the spreading fingers with a portentous fan. The girl said: “It's ever so nice--I wish I could draw.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Joe	There was silence for some time. Then [MASK] said: “What's any more dangerous than that job up yonder--but nothing's come of it.” “That's different. Away up the river so, and not another house about.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	D'you reckon he could see anything? D'you reckon he knowed anything?” “By hokey, that's so, [MASK]!” “And besides, look-a-here--maybe that whack done for _him_!”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jim	It would have been music to his soul to hear the whisperings: “Look at him, [MASK]! He's a going up there. Say--look! he's a going to shake hands with him--he _is_ shaking hands with him!
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Huck	“Well, I didn't neither, but all at once it popped onto me that it was Friday.” “Blame it, a body can't be too careful, [MASK]. We might 'a' got into an awful scrape, tackling such a thing on a Friday.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	TOM	[MASK] dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was well out of the track of returning scholars, and then fell into a moody jog. He crossed a small “branch” two or three times, because of a prevailing juvenile superstition that to cross water baffled pursuit.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Tom	They got scorched out by and by, and drearily set about getting breakfast. After the meal they felt rusty, and stiff-jointed, and a little homesick once more. [MASK] saw the signs, and fell to cheering up the pirates as well as he could.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Tom	At the end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped, and [MASK] slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk, landing fifty yards downstream, out of danger of possible stragglers. He flew along unfrequented alleys, and shortly found himself at his aunt's back fence.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Becky	Every time he stole a glance at the girls' side of the room [MASK]'s face troubled him. Considering all things, he did not want to pity her, and yet it was all he could do to help it. He could get up no exultation that was really worthy the name.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	“There now!” And he moved moodily away and began to dress himself. “Who cares!” said [MASK]. “Nobody wants you to. Go 'long home and get laughed at. Oh, you're a nice pirate.
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Tom	[MASK] was in an agony. At last he was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity begun; he began to doze, in spite of himself; the clock chimed eleven, but he did not hear it. And then there came, mingling with his half-formed dreams, a most melancholy caterwauling.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	“[MASK], what on earth ails that cat?” “I don't know, aunt,” gasped the boy. “Why, I never see anything like it. What did make him act so?”
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Becky	While he was deep in his musings, [MASK] woke up with a breezy little laugh--but it was stricken dead upon her lips, and a groan followed it. “Oh, how _could_ I sleep! I wish I never, never had waked!
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	Every day or two, during this time of sorrow, [MASK] watched his opportunity and went to the little grated jail-window and smuggled such small comforts through to the “murderer” as he could get hold of.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Peter	[MASK] was sure. “Now you've asked for it, and I'll give it to you, because there ain't anything mean about me; but if you find you don't like it, you mustn't blame anybody but your own self.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	By and by the tempest spent itself and died without accomplishing its object. The boy's first impulse was to be grateful, and reform. His second was to wait--for there might not be any more storms. The next day the doctors were back; [MASK] had relapsed.
<name>Long John Silver</name>	Long John Silver	Tom	How'd you feel to light on a rotten chest full of gold and silver--hey?” But it roused only faint enthusiasm, which faded out, with no reply. [MASK] tried one or two other seductions; but they failed, too. It was discouraging work.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	[MASK] hesitated and looked confused. “Speak out, my boy--don't be diffident. The truth is always respectable. What did you take there?” “Only a--a--dead cat.” There was a ripple of mirth, which the court checked.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	You're_ up a stump, ain't you!” No answer. [MASK] surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist, then he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result, as before.
<name>Aunt Polly</name>	Aunt Polly	Auntie	It merely looked mean and shabby now. He hung his head and could not think of anything to say for a moment. Then he said: “[MASK], I wish I hadn't done it--but I didn't think.” “Oh, child, you never think.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Huck	but there's a mighty short cut that they don't anybody but me know about. [MASK], I'll take you right to it in a skiff. I'll float the skiff down there, and I'll pull it back again all by myself.
<name>Cross</name>	Cross	Tom	The point was well taken. It had its effect. “[MASK], I didn't think of that. But that's so. It's luck for us, that cross is. I reckon we'll climb down there and have a hunt for that box.”
<name>Friday</name>	Friday	Becky	He found that it curtained a sort of steep natural stairway which was enclosed between narrow walls, and at once the ambition to be a discoverer seized him. [MASK] responded to his call, and they made a smoke-mark for future guidance, and started upon their quest.
<name>Huck</name>	Huck	Huckleberry	[MASK] whispered: “I wisht I knowed. It's awful solemn like, _ain't_ it?” “I bet it is.” There was a considerable pause, while the boys canvassed this matter inwardly.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	“I'd know it better if you acted more like it.” “I wish now I'd thought,” said [MASK], with a repentant tone; “but I dreamt about you, anyway. That's something, ain't it?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sid	Finally he strode home reluctantly, with his poor head full of visions. All through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wondered “what had got into the child.” He took a good scolding about clodding [MASK], and did not seem to mind it in the least.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	“But they don't.” “Well, if they like it, [MASK], all right; but I don't want to be a king and have only just a given name, like a nigger. But say--where you going to dig first?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	At home [MASK] learned of the Cardiff Hill event; also that the “ragged man's” body had eventually been found in the river near the ferry-landing; he had been drowned while trying to escape, perhaps.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Mary	“There, there, now, don't begin that groaning again. Open your mouth. Well--your tooth _is_ loose, but you're not going to die about that. [MASK], get me a silk thread, and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Huck	“I'll try, but don't you be afeard. They ain't going to hurt us. 'Now I lay me down to sleep, I--'” “Sh!” “What is it, [MASK]?” “They're _humans_!
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Lordy	“[MASK], I don't want to foller him by myself!” “Why, it'll be night, sure. He mightn't ever see you--and if he did, maybe he'd never think anything.” “Well, if it's pretty dark
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	“Hallo, he's stopped!--Look out, he's turning! Don't let him get away!” People in the branches of the trees over [MASK]'s head said he wasn't trying to get away--he only looked doubtful and perplexed. “Infernal impudence!
<name>Sidney</name>	Sidney	Tom	“[MASK], how _could_ you be so noble!” CHAPTER XXI VACATION was approaching. The schoolmaster, always severe, grew severer and more exacting than ever, for he wanted the school to make a good showing on “Examination” day.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	“Goody!... No, [MASK], that ain't it. If it is, it ain't in this one-horse town. They ain't no numbers here.” “Well, that's so. Lemme think a minute.
<name>Injun Joe</name>	Injun Joe	Tom	But won't the widow take it away from us, [MASK]? It's on her land.” “_She_ take it away! Maybe she'd like to try it once. Whoever finds one of these hid treasures, it belongs to him.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	The slow days drifted on, and each left behind it a slightly lightened weight of apprehension. CHAPTER XXV THERE comes a time in every rightly-constructed boy's life when he has a raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure. This desire suddenly came upon [MASK] one day.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Potter	His gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciences before--it cut deeper than ever, this time. They felt cowardly and treacherous to the last degree when [MASK] said: “You've been mighty good to me, boys--better'n anybody else in this town.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	They toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnel, then made their spliced kite-strings fast and moved on. A few steps brought them to the spring, and [MASK] felt a shudder quiver all through him.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Becky	He talked hopefully to [MASK]; but an age of anxious waiting passed and no sounds came again. The children groped their way back to the spring. The weary time dragged on; they slept again, and awoke famished and woe-stricken.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Tom	I wouldn't do that. You must go and learn it again. Don't you be discouraged, [MASK], you'll manage it--and if you do, I'll give you something ever so nice. There, now, that's a good boy.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	He sprang to the corner of the brick store. The next moment two men brushed by him, and one seemed to have something under his arm. It must be that box! So they were going to remove the treasure. Why call [MASK] now?
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	“I won't! You can all go, if you want to. I mean to stay.” “[MASK], I better go.” “Well, go 'long--who's hendering you.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	“No--never mind. It'll be over by and by, maybe. Don't call anybody.” “But I must! _Don't_ groan so, [MASK], it's awful. How long you been this way?” “Hours.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	TOM	[MASK] was a glittering hero once more--the pet of the old, the envy of the young. His name even went into immortal print, for the village paper magnified him. There were some that believed he would be President, yet, if he escaped hanging.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Becky	“Ye--yes--but some other time.” “No, now.” “No, not now--to-morrow.” “Oh, no, _now_. Please, [MASK]--I'll whisper it, I'll whisper it ever so easy.”
<name>Injun Joe</name>	Injun Joe	Huck	“[MASK], I always reckoned we'd get it. It's just too good to believe, but we _have_ got it, sure! Say--let's not fool around here. Let's snake it out. Lemme see if I can lift the box.”
