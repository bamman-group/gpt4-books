<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Sarah	She had left, I thought selfishly, without saying goodbye. She’s left me alone in this God-forsaken place. I looked around and then up at the ceiling as if I expected to see [MASK]’s spirit hovering there.
<name>Olga</name>	Olga	Sarah	—[MASK], we’ll talk about it later, after I’ve packed and sent my trunks to the ship. I’m sorry, truly sorry, but it can’t be helped . . . it’s only temporary.
<name>Henrietta</name>	Henrietta	Reaux	Safely inside, I cowered against the cushions as the baron raced to the carriage. Breathless and panting, he pulled the door of the landau open. —These exhibitions should never be repeated, [MASK]. She’s become quite dangerous. Possibly demented. Watch her carefully.
<name>Leonardo</name>	Leonardo	Tiedeman	The oil lamps and torches cast grotesque black shadows over the entire assembly of anatomists, physicians, functionaries, hospital workers, gravediggers and croque-morts. There was no sound except the silence of the dead. [MASK] wiped away his tears and resumed sculpting.
<name>Heine</name>	Heine	Balzac	He calls forth destruction, death becomes alive; in a kind of retrospective apocalypse, we experience the terrifying resurrection of dead worlds—and the little scrap of life vouchsafed us in the nameless eternity of time, can no longer inspire anything but compassion, as another writer, [MASK], has said . . .
<name>Yorick</name>	Yorick	Europeans	Then he picked up the head of an Egyptian mummy that lay on the instrument table and held it aloft in the other hand. —Look at this head, which I present to you so that as Academicians you can compare it with that of [MASK], Negroes, Hottentots.
<name>He</name>	He	Kx’au	We would make our fire for the night, prepare our meal, read the stars and close the door of our woven mat house. To my great happiness, I conceived a child. [MASK] never lived to see it. He died mysteriously in the bush of gunshot wounds.
<name>Blue</name>	Blue	Sarah	Lost my job at the mill, couldn’t feed my brother. —Come on, [MASK], my master called from the steps. And don’t pick up that beggar! —She’s not begging, I said, it is I who am asking.
<name>Radcliffe</name>	Radcliffe	Hendrick	It’s you they want— [MASK] has found a hall; we are printing up the advertisements and tickets. Everything will go on as planned. I’ll return as soon as I can, but this is a matter of life and death . . .
<name>Lucette</name>	Lucette	Saartjie	I’ve never touched [MASK]. Nor would I allow anyone else to—she’s family! My boys’ nurse. —You’ve never even peeked at this . . . apron of hers? —No, he bed. —Then how do you know it really exists?
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Alice	It’s perfectly legal, an ancient English custom known as wife sale. —What! exploded [MASK]. —Wife sale is illegal and a crime, she shouted from the doorway. You could never make it stick!
<name>Tristan</name>	Tristan	Dunlop	Your contract is a lie and a farce! [MASK] is a lie and a farce. How can you still love him? He deserted you. He’s a liar. He’s a bigamist. Why do you still honor him? Why do you honor the contract?
<name>myself</name>	myself	Hottentots	—You’re angry. —I’m not angry, I want you to behave yourself. —I’m incapable of behaving myself because of the natural imbecility of [MASK]! —Save me your wit. —What else do I have to believe in?
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Sarah	And again, I heard [MASK]’s voice, feebly but with a penetrating effect in the quiet of the room. The enormous discord of her sobs, as if sent from some faraway and remote spot, beyond the reaches of human suffering, crushed every bone in my body.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Cecil	—It is the least I can do for [MASK]. Why, I couldn’t walk past his grave if I didn’t at least try. —He left me ten pounds in his will but it was never paid to me by his family.
<name>Macomber</name>	Macomber	Reaux	He was a simple shepherd like you, it’s so sad . . . —He was a white man, I said in a voice that was sadder by far. —[MASK] wants you locked up at night. He’s afraid you want to escape.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Caroline	We were all exiles: blacks in the kingdom of whites. I saw in [MASK] the child I had lost. I was black in a world hill of white people. She was thirty inches tall in a world of people who were five and three quarters feet high.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Dunlop	You could never make it stick! Besides, [MASK] is a bloody bigamist. —Try me, I said. And you’ll both end up in a whorehouse. This contract gives me, as her husband, complete control of all her worldly goods . . .
<name>animals</name>	animals	Negroes	—Whatever [MASK] lack in intelligence, they make up for in instinct and feeling. They have excellent heart and above all the possibility of all virtue, he concluded. —Hear! Hear! repeated a Belgian naturalist. The Negro has the same possibilities as a European child.
<name>Yvonne</name>	Yvonne	Sarah	I worried, but [MASK]’s attitude had a morbid rigidity, a dull stubbornness that was possibly the stupidity of her race, a dense, angry, dreamy resistance to changing anything until her so-called inheritance, which she equated with her dignity, was restored.
<name>She</name>	She	Saartjie	Her elbows trembled as I clutched them in my fists. —Escape, I concluded without a pause. You’d be a free woman . . . [MASK] still hid her face in her hands. I drew her closer to me and took hold of her wrists gently.
<name>luggage</name>	luggage	Adolph	The porter’s eyes widened and we had a furious discussion about his transport. Finally a cart pulled by a bullock was found to move [MASK] and we three humans walked to the village square, on foot, Indian file, following the porter with the luggage.
<name>Gulliver</name>	Gulliver	Sarah	—Don’t be stupid. —I’m not stupid! I shouted. —No, said my master slowly, just stupid enough to believe a fairy freak... all those so-called X’s—why that’s your own language, [MASK].
<name>Mathilde</name>	Mathilde	Alya	—Oh, about the same, he said, there’s litde difference at all. . . His wife, [MASK], also had her ideas about how far away from her I should stand. All her servants were ordered to keep their distance of ten feet.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Etienne	—Poor wretched creature. How I pity her. —Pity ourselves, dear [MASK], for she has gone perhaps to a better place, and we are stuck here in this desperate metaphysical struggle for survival. —You would change places with her? —
<name>Lucie</name>	Lucie	Sarah	I refused many, but from time to time I accepted and [MASK] obliged me by donning her transparent dress and mask and allowing gentlemen and ladies whom she would never see again to gaze at her person with pity and horror. This was usually manifested by nervous laughter and coarse commentary.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Cuvier	stuffed . . . Poor creature . . . [MASK]’s brain may have weighed twice as much as hers, but he was also her double or triple in body weight. He was twice as tall and I’m sure his kidneys too were twice as heavy.
<name>Zinoviev</name>	Zinoviev	Cuviers	I was sure that my employer resented [MASK] miraculous ability to survive intact three political regimes not only without a hint of a prison cell, exile or death but, on the contrary, with an avalanche of important positions, honors, decorations and powerful responsibilities.
<name>John</name>	John	Saartjie	I loved children. I would take care of the three as if they were my own. —I love children, sir, I said, still speaking Afrikaans. —Is that so, [MASK]. Well, that’s fine. My wife’ll be real pleased.
<name>Mother</name>	Mother	Alice	I clung to [MASK] and wept in longing for that same sweet safety and rest. I was twenty-five years old and as tired as a field slave of sixty. I had learned to drink and I had learned to read, and I had learned to curse my keepers in their own language.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Caroline	—She’s a goddess, said [MASK]. And a planet. —Well, Hottentot is a Dutch word, which means “to stutter.” It is an insult given to my people by the Dutch, who couldn’t learn our language.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Alice	I never asked [MASK] about her former life, although from time to time we exchanged stories about the past. I didn’t know if my governess dreamed of a man, a love, a family of her own . . .
<name>Neanderthals</name>	Neanderthals	Africans	What did the white race have to do with [MASK]? They were two separate and distinct species. —My problem is to establish the scientific relationship between them, not to contemplate white girls .. . The baron turned away. I was sure he didn’t want to talk to the newspapers.
<name>Jean</name>	Jean	Alice	[MASK] told me he was a Breton and played the French bagpipe, to which his bear danced. But it was his appearance that struck me, for he resembled his bear. His face was covered with a thick black beard and mustache, so that his mouth was invisible.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Sarah	Have you forgotten? —I might own you, [MASK], but you don’t belong to me—there’s a difference. I, for example, belong to the theater. I belong to the characters I play—rather badly.
<name>Esmeralda</name>	Esmeralda	Caroline	Of all of the extraordinary people, I had come to love the thirty-inch fairy, [MASK], best. She was a perfect miniature person, who had entered the world of the circus as a small child and was still only twelve years old.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sarah	There was an absence within. [MASK] was gone. Surely, after all our plans, she hadn’t left without me? Would there be a note telling me where to find her? Would there be a rendezvous at an inn, a stable, the mail coach?
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Alice	This is how I learned that [MASK] was only a few years older than me, although she looked twenty years more. She was perhaps five feet five and had sloping shoulders, wide hips and ample breasts that she bound in linen.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Saartjie	They all seemed drowned in a kind of interior silence, deeper than mere absence of sound, the silence of death, as they stood dejected in the shadow of the penitentiary walls. I glanced at [MASK], who had hurried away from them towards the entrance to the building.
<name>Hitler</name>	Hitler	Lincoln	—But getting back to [MASK], he continued, a true leader, like a true scientist, must have the power of reshaping the universally known into what is universal so simply and deeply that people overlook the simplicity in the profundity and the profundity in the simplicity.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Alice	Today, there was no freak show because it was New Year’s Day and it was my birthday. I had been feeling poorly for several days now, enough to alarm [MASK] into sending for the doctor. He explained once more that I had to return home or I would die.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Etienne	—Do you think that man is any more capable of preparing for death just because he sees it coming, [MASK]? Really? —We all go blindly into the unknown, you mean? —I mean we are all blind. We don’t even know what death is.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Henry	Or rather we are married and I am a bigamist. If you don’t know what that means, ask [MASK]. It was hard for me to read the letter because it was written in a trembling hand and my hands shook, but the message was clear.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Sarah	The pamphlets, newspapers, clippings and receipts had all disappeared. All that I salvaged from the sack of [MASK]’s room was her Bible, the red cloak I was wearing, the opal ring and several pairs of the red silk gloves she so adored.
<name>Ota</name>	Ota	Sarah	You are a fake, a myth, a joke, a misrepresentation, a victim used to promote a freakish mythology ... a false blackness ... a grotesque caricature of so-called savagery. Look at the penny pictures of you! Think, [MASK]. Think for yourself.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Sarah	—It’s nothing, [MASK]. I’ll be back in a few months. I promise . . . I sat down slowly, because my knees would not hold me up. —But the . . . show. —. . .
<name>Nettie</name>	Nettie	Saartjie	I stared at it with horror. His organ had two testicles ... I wondered if all white men were so deformed. —What you staring at, [MASK]? Can’t tell me you ain’t never seen a man’s penis before—you a married woman.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Peter	If you say one more word in public, they will surely put your hide in a penal colony and throw away the key! —I’ll keep quiet if you and [MASK] bring a suit against her keeper for kidnapping, contraband and unlawful duress.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Sarah	—[MASK], I whispered again before I flung open the door. Even before kneeling beside the inert body, I knew she was dead. —Lord ’ave mercy, I moaned as I crossed myself. She had left, I thought selfishly, without saying goodbye.
<name>Alonso</name>	Alonso	Peter	He was soon penniless as drought made his lands worthless for grazing and foot-and-mouth disease destroyed his herds. Yellow fever took his wife and children. For several years he drank and gambled. He lost his preserve in a craps shoot and went to work for his brother [MASK].
<name>Xhosa</name>	Xhosa	Khoe	For the first time I repeated the rainmaker’s curse, softly at first, then louder and louder in [MASK], adding the clicks and inhalations, the expulsions and the sound of a cork popping, ending in a whistle of pure terror as the power of the incantation escaped my lips.
<name>Saartjie</name>	Saartjie	Venus	That she became a cause celebre and a paragon of Western ethnology, a living legend and an icon of scientific racism, is incredible ... or at least a fatality.. . and our own fault. We created [MASK].
<name>decay</name>	decay	Dirt	She didn’t want to smell them or touch them and she didn’t want them breathing on her person. This was one of the many ways she fought [MASK]. —What is life, she would say, but stink and shit?
<name>Khoe</name>	Khoe	Sarah	They have freedom of speech in domestic disputes. If a notable dies, his wife can succeed him and lead the tribe. The Khoe word for woman is tarns, which means ruler or mistress. So [MASK] had a tradition of independence . ..
<name>Gilgamesh</name>	Gilgamesh	Ulysses	—No. —That’s sad. —It’s just a story a poet made up . . . The world’s first hero—or the world’s first fool, he said. —The hero, what was his name? —[MASK].
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Alice	Sometimes it would simply hang there, quivering in midair, but sometimes it would descend, on a wall or a piece of furniture, or on [MASK] s neck, nose or stomach. He never beat me because I had to appear unmarked in my cage the next day.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Sarah	The aisles flickered with lit candles, the polished wooden benches reflected in the gloom. At the end of the long hall was a simple altar draped in white linen and a high wooden pulpit on which hung a gold crucifix. —Can you read at all, [MASK]?
<name>Frederick</name>	Frederick	Sarah	You are looking at a free and liberated black man. I’m the first free black man you’ve ever set eyes upon . . . And you don’t even know it! You are still afraid to look white people in the eye—Look up, [MASK]!
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Caesar	I whistled at the size, breadth and beauty of it with its serene landscape of cattle grazing and wheat fields swaying. —No reason to leave all this, I said. —All mortgaged to the hilt, replied [MASK].
<name>you</name>	you	Baartman	What did these men want with me I thought? Was I not unhappy enough as it was? True, my master had returned. But all I had in the world was my contract with him. —We consider [MASK] here your prisoner.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Dunlop	sighed [MASK]. You’ve been so strange lately . . . —What is a contract? —Exactly like a Hottentot marriage contract: a solemn promise to abide by your word of honor. —This is the marriage contract according to the English? I asked.
<name>Lyell</name>	Lyell	Huxley	A few naturalists endowed with some flexibility of mind, like [MASK] for example, may be influenced by my volume; but I look with confidence to the future, to young and rising naturalists, who will be able to view both sides of this question with impartiality.
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Sarah	—Oh yes they do. Otherwise teaching slaves to read wouldn’t be a crime . . . would it. .. Can’t you read, [MASK]? —No. —No? —I wouldn’t when I was little. I won’t now. —
<name>Thackery</name>	Thackery	Cuvier	[MASK] nodded, trying to get to the crux of his lecture, but the anatomists were enthusiastically debating this riveting question, tripping over one another in the stampede to assert their opinions. —The average standard of the Negro race is two grades below our own based on my intelligence chart.
<name>Atlas</name>	Atlas	John	Onstage, a giant struck a pose and [MASK] Ran- dian, the torso man, lit himself a cigar. Irritated and not a little apprehensive, with my walking stick I struck off a filthy gypsy child who was trying to pick my pocket.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Alice	Whores, niggers, sodomites . . . He pulled me up by my hair. The little people scattered, only [MASK] stood her ground, silently, like a lioness. —Oh, you her girlfriend? —I’m her servant. —Her servant!
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Bitch	My heart was racing. I was about to encounter science thanks to the man who was approaching slowly with a stately stiff-legged walk. —[MASK], stand up straight. . . —Yes, Master. We came face-to-face with the two men.
<name>Albertine</name>	Albertine	Sarah	—Either you succumb to their crazy opinions or you massacre them without pity—because, because, [MASK], they believe that if you don’t think like them, you are unfit to live . . . unfit to inhabit this world . . .
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Sarah	There was a note sticking out. I lifted the cover of the book to retrieve it. It was addressed to me in [MASK]’s childish scrawl. I didn’t read it. I couldn’t through my tears. Hurriedly, I slipped it into my coat pocket.
<name>Anais</name>	Anais	Alice	and I’ll go out and try to find some food for both of us—something you can swallow. [MASK] kissed me. Obediently I drank the medicine. I allowed her to undress me and to fill the tub to the brim. She lit all the candles.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Sarah	My eyes sought escape from the bare room. Through the window, I could see the top of the lone leafless tree swaying to and fro as in a nightmare. I thought I might wake and find [MASK] there trying on a new pair of gloves.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Alice	—Me too. —It’s money, [MASK] continued. We are prisoners because we are poor. —I know where the cashbox is, I said. —You won’t break your contract because of a promise, but you’d steal the cashbox!
<name>Victoria</name>	Victoria	Hendrick	Everything is going exactly as I have planned and I have had some success although I may have to stay away longer than I had planned. I regret not to be therefor your triumph, but I am sure [MASK] has everything under control.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Cuvier	Do you know [MASK] himself has a private collection of 11,486 items? You give me any more lip and I’ll smash you one . . . He drew me closer to him and pinched my arm. He rubbed his jaw. —Look how beautiful these grounds are ...
<name>Mathilde</name>	Mathilde	Sarah	Those cheap bastards only want their theories, their experiments, their decorations and academies, their trophies and stipends and publications. Yet we are more honest. The entire world is a voyeur, and that includes our “Napoleon of Intelligence!” —We’re still leaving this time, pouted [MASK] stubbornly.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sarah	Misused, I thought. My fortune was gone, my bride’s dowry spent by my master without marriage, my only means of earning a living the subject of a trial. And here were a posse of white men ready to make a fool of me, [MASK] ...
<name>Babel</name>	Babel	Khoekhoe	Noisily the men filed into the theater. They spoke loudly and jovially, I suppose because of the champagne they had just consumed. Others spoke in serious, hushed tones, all of which blended into an incomprehensible babble that could have been [MASK].
<name>She</name>	She	Alice	She said it so matter-of-factly that I knew she was telling the truth, that last night she would have died if it hadn’t been for me. [MASK] firmly believed this and I believed her. It became a kind of emblem between us.
<name>Panic</name>	Panic	Disbelief	A thick warm liquid filled my throat. It took me a moment to taste blood and realize it was not the small spots I sometimes saw on my handkerchief, but a full-scale hemorrhage. [MASK] more than fright roused me from the rose-tinted water.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Hendrick	—To recuperate her rightful inheritance, she says. —Shouldn’t we be saving this female instead of exploiting her? —Saving her? Come on, [MASK], to all intents and purposes, she is, unlike the prostitute, beyond redemption.
<name>Aeolus</name>	Aeolus	Magahas	Then wind and rain came stampeding across the dark mass of the sea, chasing the ship like the thousand cattle of [MASK]’s secret chamber. Lightning now struck at will, as if it had especially chosen us for its target. The wind howled.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Sarah	It’s killing you. —All I remember is a horde of screaming white monkeys dressed like white people who tried to attack me. I was only trying to escape ... to explain who I was! What did I do? —Read it for yourself, [MASK]!
<name>Reverend</name>	Reverend	Alice	—The Freehouselands are all good Christians. —Perhaps, but also thieves. —You were but a child then. —All the more shame. —Come with me, child. The reverend turned and started towards the church. I was glad [MASK] was with me.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Auni	My father’s sister, [MASK], who, except for selling me to the reverend, had always treated me kindly, like one of her own children, changed completely towards me now that I had been sent back home. She turned harsh and rigid and inflexible, not to say cruel.
<name>James</name>	James	Cuvier	I vowed to ask him later about my unanswered letter of months ago. The orchestra struck up, and for a moment, the Venus thought everyone in the world loved her. [MASK] escorted the Venus to her hosts, the prince and princess. I could not believe my luck!
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Emma	I must have been six or seven. She is as fascinating to me now as she was then ... to my childish eyes. I recall that my mother was disgusted, for she was an abolitionist, like my wife, [MASK]. I have rarely seen her so angry.
<name>Education</name>	Education	Learning	Too much damn trouble—too dangerous. They teach it to the Kaffir children . . . [MASK] spoils the best niggers in the world. —No, I assure you, she can’t read and she can’t write. —How old is she?
<name>Artemisia</name>	Artemisia	Dunlop	She’s a monster of sex and provocation, an insatiable siren! A heartless, shameless savage ... a superstitious man-eating, dirt-eating heathen . . . —Is there no moral deterrent at all in your character, [MASK]? —None at all.
<name>Cyclops</name>	Cyclops	Cyclops	Besides, she would never agree. She’s extremely shy and has the modesty of a white woman. —Actually it doesn’t matter if it exists or not, as long as people believe it does. Do mermaids have tails? Does [MASK] have one eye?
<name>Josephine</name>	Josephine	Sarah	[MASK] looked startled, caught unawares. The violence of the women’s reaction surprised her. Their panic induced a reverie that made her seem to sink downwards before my very eyes. Her head fell onto her breast, her arms hung slackly, her eyes filled with tears.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Sarah	Never. I’m free. Free! Leave me alone! —I won’t leave you alone. I’ve left you alone too long as it is. For two years I’ve left you alone! —You won’t leave me. —No, [MASK].
<name>Revenge</name>	Revenge	Recognition	The door opened and the African sun burst through, carrying a dulcet scent of blossoms that perfumed my shroud. Sweet laughter rose in my chest and found a home. What did I really want? Respect. What does a wronged woman want after two hundred years? [MASK].
<name>She</name>	She	Saartjie	—Riches and perhaps trouble, I said, you females always give me trouble, I whispered softly. Never fear. I’ve never forgotten any of you. I held out my hand and in the dim light [MASK] stared at the coin lying in my palm.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Alice	At least, I thought, the examination was finished. Never to be repeated. I would never have to see the baron again. I dressed without waking [MASK] and slipped outside. In the hazy blue light of almost-morning, I walked to the monkey pavilion.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Caroline	I drank to forget what the rainmaker had said. I drank to forget the trial. I drank to while away the time. I drank because I was ashamed; I drank because I needed to drink. I thought no one noticed, but [MASK] did.
<name>the Scottish naturalist</name>	the Scottish naturalist	Cuvier	—Race, added a Scottish naturalist, rising from his seat, is everything. Literature, science, art—in a word, civilization. The baron now made a motion to preclude comments and return to his exposition. There was some commotion as an English physician rose to contradict [MASK].
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Saartjie	—-Just want to feel you up a bit, [MASK]. I’m a good Christian, faithful to my wife . . . He opened his breeches, took out his organ wild with red hairs like an orangutan’s posterior. I stared at it with horror.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Dunlop	If you run away from [MASK] now, as his wife, he can send the constables after you to bring you back as his property and no one will lift a finger. No one will help you because you are legally his.
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Reaux	But [MASK] no longer saw or heard me. He had sunk into the quicksand of his own torment. He struggled for several moments and then, as if I had dealt him a blow to the head, sank to his knees; his arms stretched downwards, his hands clasped.
<name>Yambo</name>	Yambo	Englishman	I willed myself not to understand. Not to understand one word he was saying. It was weakness to try to understand him. I saw what whites saw, a crazy nigger in [MASK]’s clothes, hiding . . . waiting to pounce upon them with his poisoned spear.
