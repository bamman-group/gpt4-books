<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Halloa	[MASK]! What’s this?” He was carefully examining the foolscap, upon which the words were pasted, holding it only an inch or two from his eyes. “Well?” “Nothing,” said he, throwing it down.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Mortimer	But how did you know me?” “I have been calling on [MASK], and he pointed you out to me from the window of his surgery as you passed. As our road lay the same way I thought that I would overtake you and introduce myself.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Stapleton	He spoke lightly, but it was evident that he was very much in earnest. [MASK] was guarded in his replies, but it was easy to see that he said less than he might, and that he would not express his whole opinion out of consideration for the feelings of the baronet.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Holmes	“Yes, sir.” “And ask at the station office if there is a message for me.” The boy returned with a telegram, which [MASK] handed to me. It ran: Wire received. Coming down with unsigned warrant. Arrive five-forty.
<name>Moriarty</name>	Moriarty	Stapleton	The face of [MASK] had sprung out of the canvas. “Ha, you see it now. My eyes have been trained to examine faces and not their trimmings. It is the first quality of a criminal investigator that he should see through a disguise.”
<name>Mortimer</name>	Mortimer	Barrymore	One fact which has not been explained is the statement of [MASK] that his master’s footprints altered their character from the time that he passed the moor-gate, and that he appeared from thence onward to have been walking upon his toes.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Baskerville	We had risen to depart when [MASK] gave a cry, of triumph, and diving into one of the corners of the room he drew a brown boot from under a cabinet. “My missing boot!” he cried.
<name>Challenger</name>	Challenger	Holmes	But now from somewhere among the broken ground immediately in front of us there came one last despairing yell, and then a dull, heavy thud. We halted and listened. Not another sound broke the heavy silence of the windless night. I saw [MASK] put his hand to his forehead like a man distracted.
<name>Cartwright</name>	Cartwright	Barrymore	He passes along the same path at the same hour, and to whom should he be going except to the convict?” Here was luck indeed! And yet I suppressed all appearance of interest. A child! [MASK] had said that our unknown was supplied by a boy.
<name>Barrymore</name>	Barrymore	Barrymore	It was thrown by a man who walked softly down the passage with a candle held in his hand. He was in shirt and trousers, with no covering to his feet. I could merely see the outline, but his height told me that it was [MASK].
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Holmes	“When did he say this?” “When he left me.” “Did he say anything more?” “He mentioned his name.” [MASK] cast a swift glance of triumph at me. “Oh, he mentioned his name, did he?
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Holmes	“My dear fellow,” said he, “[MASK], with all his wisdom, did not foresee some things which have happened since I have been on the moor. You understand me? I am sure that you are the last man in the world who would wish to be a spoil-sport.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Holmes	But the manuscript is short and is intimately connected with the affair. With your permission I will read it to you.” [MASK] leaned back in his chair, placed his finger-tips together, and closed his eyes, with an air of resignation.
<name>John</name>	John	Barrymore	That night he went out as usual for his nocturnal walk, in the course of which he was in the habit of smoking a cigar. He never returned. At twelve o’clock [MASK], finding the hall door still open, became alarmed, and, lighting a lantern, went in search of his master.
<name>Providence</name>	Providence	Providence	Nor can it be denied that many of the family have been unhappy in their deaths, which have been sudden, bloody, and mysterious. Yet may we shelter ourselves in the infinite goodness of [MASK], which would not forever punish the innocent beyond that third or fourth generation which is threatened in Holy Writ.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Watson	So it ended by his going off with her, as you saw, and here am I as badly puzzled a man as any in this county. Just tell me what it all means, [MASK], and I’ll owe you more than ever I can hope to pay.”
<name>Stapleton</name>	Stapleton	Stapleton	He has rushed about the moor in a crazy state and eventually fallen over here and broken his neck.” “That seems the most reasonable theory,” said [MASK], and he gave a sigh which I took to indicate his relief.
<name>Barrymore</name>	Barrymore	Barrymore	Between us we soon supplied his wants, and then over a belated supper we explained to the baronet as much of our experience as it seemed desirable that he should know. But first I had the unpleasant duty of breaking the news to [MASK] and his wife.
<name>Stapleton</name>	Stapleton	Stapleton	Thus I had made certain of the hound, and had guessed at the criminal before ever we went to the west country. “It was my game to watch [MASK]. It was evident, however, that I could not do this if I were with you, since he would be keenly on his guard.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Watson	“Excuse the admiration of a connoisseur,” said he as he waved his hand towards the line of portraits which covered the opposite wall. “[MASK] won’t allow that I know anything of art but that is mere jealousy because our views upon the subject differ.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Watson	“No, no, sir, it is nothing--nothing at all!” the butler broke in; “I assure you, sir--” “Move your light across the window, [MASK]!” cried the baronet. “See, the other moves also!
<name>Stapleton</name>	Stapleton	Stapleton	“The baronet himself told him about the family hound, and so prepared the way for his own death. [MASK], as I will continue to call him, knew that the old man’s heart was weak and that a shock would kill him.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Watson	I don’t know that [MASK] and I are much the wiser since we came down.” “I think that I shall be in a position to make the situation rather more clear to you before long. It has been an exceedingly difficult and most complicated business.
<name>Stapleton</name>	Stapleton	Barrymore	We had arranged no plan of campaign, but the baronet is a man to whom the most direct way is always the most natural. He walked into the room, and as he did so [MASK] sprang up from the window with a sharp hiss of his breath and stood, livid and trembling, before us.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Baskerville	[MASK] sat for a long time, his eyes fixed upon it, and I read upon his eager face how much it meant to him, this first sight of that strange spot where the men of his blood had held sway so long and left their mark so deep.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Stapleton	“One cannot always have the success for which one hopes. An investigator needs facts and not legends or rumours. It has not been a satisfactory case.” My friend spoke in his frankest and most unconcerned manner. [MASK] still looked hard at him.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Mortimer	“By the way, [MASK],” said I as we jolted along the rough road, “I suppose there are few people living within driving distance of this whom you do not know?” “Hardly any, I think.”
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Holmes	The air had turned chill and we withdrew into the hut for warmth. There, sitting together in the twilight, I told [MASK] of my conversation with the lady. So interested was he that I had to repeat some of it twice before he was satisfied.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Holmes	We moved cautiously along the track as if we were bound for the house, but [MASK] halted us when we were about two hundred yards from it. “This will do,” said he. “These rocks upon the right make an admirable screen.”
<name>Barrymore</name>	Barrymore	Barrymore	and I tell you the direction of my suspicions, however much the result may have shown that they were unfounded. But whatever the true explanation of [MASK]’s movements might be, I felt that the responsibility of keeping them to myself until I could explain them was more than I could bear.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Holmes	“Then we meet again at two o’clock. Au revoir, and good-morning!” We heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and the bang of the front door. In an instant [MASK] had changed from the languid dreamer to the man of action.
<name>Lestrade</name>	Lestrade	Lestrade	It ran: Wire received. Coming down with unsigned warrant. Arrive five-forty. [MASK]. “That is in answer to mine of this morning. He is the best of the professionals, I think, and we may need his assistance.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Watson	As a matter of course I did the same. “What, are you coming, [MASK]?” he asked, looking at me in a curious way. “That depends on whether you are going on the moor,” said I. “Yes, I am.”
<name>Stapleton</name>	Stapleton	Stapleton	“The recital of these events must be very painful to you, and perhaps it will make it easier if I tell you what occurred, and you can check me if I make any material mistake. The sending of this letter was suggested to you by [MASK]?”
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Holmes	He looked sharply from [MASK] to me. “Dear me! What a very shocking affair! How did he die?” “He appears to have broken his neck by falling over these rocks. My friend and I were strolling on the moor when we heard a cry.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Eliza	Her bulky figure in a shawl and skirt might have been comic were it not for the intensity of feeling upon her face. “We have to go, [MASK]. This is the end of it. You can pack our things,” said the butler.
<name>Godfrey</name>	Godfrey	Barrymore	“That’s the truth, sir,” said [MASK]. “I said that it was not my secret and that I could not tell it to you. But now you have heard it, and you will see that if there was a plot it was not against you.”
<name>Mortimer</name>	Mortimer	Barrymore	I realized it as I drove back and noted how hill after hill showed traces of the ancient people. [MASK]’s only indication had been that the stranger lived in one of these abandoned huts, and many hundreds of them are scattered throughout the length and breadth of the moor.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Holmes	There, outlined as black as an ebony statue on that shining background, I saw the figure of a man upon the tor. Do not think that it was a delusion, [MASK]. I assure you that I have never in my life seen anything more clearly.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Watson	I am not sure that as a conscientious detective my first duty is not to arrest the whole household. [MASK]’s reports are most incriminating documents.” “But how about the case?” asked the baronet. “Have you made anything out of the tangle?
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Holmes	In one of these a staple and chain with a quantity of gnawed bones showed where the animal had been confined. A skeleton with a tangle of brown hair adhering to it lay among the debris. “A dog!” said [MASK].
<name>Lyons</name>	Lyons	Lyons	“Exactly. She married an artist named [MASK], who came sketching on the moor. He proved to be a blackguard and deserted her. The fault from what I hear may not have been entirely on one side.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Watson	She always comes to us when she is in town.” “Thank you; I am afraid I cannot claim her acquaintance. We have established a most important fact by these questions, [MASK],” he continued in a low voice as we went upstairs together.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Watson	Several rolls of paper lay around him. “Caught cold, [MASK]?” said he. “No, it’s this poisonous atmosphere.” “I suppose it is pretty thick, now that you mention it.” “Thick! It is intolerable.”
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Watson	It would have killed my poor wife had he been taken again.” “I guess we are aiding and abetting a felony, [MASK]? But, after what we have heard I don’t feel as if I could give the man up, so there is an end of it.
<name>Stapleton</name>	Stapleton	Stapleton	We are very rich in orchids on the moor, though, of course, you are rather late to see the beauties of the place.” [MASK] had abandoned the chase and came back to us breathing hard and flushed with his exertions.
<name>Beryl</name>	Beryl	Beryl	said he as if in answer to my thought. “And yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy, do we not, [MASK]?” “Quite happy,” said she, but there was no ring of conviction in her words.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Holmes	If he was vulnerable he was mortal, and if we could wound him we could kill him. Never have I seen a man run as [MASK] ran that night. I am reckoned fleet of foot, but he outpaced me as much as I outpaced the little professional.
<name>Stevenson</name>	Stevenson	Stapleton	As I approached the hut, walking as warily as [MASK] would do when with poised net he drew near the settled butterfly, I satisfied myself that the place had indeed been used as a habitation. A vague pathway among the boulders led to the dilapidated opening which served as a door.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Watson	Never have I seen my friend more completely taken aback than by the cabman’s reply. For an instant he sat in silent amazement. Then he burst into a hearty laugh. “A touch, [MASK]--an undeniable touch!” said he.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Halloa	“Your blood would be upon my head. I assure you that there would not be the least chance of your coming back alive. It is only by remembering certain complex landmarks that I am able to do it.” “[MASK]!” I cried.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Holmes	Then my senses and my voice came back to me, while a crushing weight of responsibility seemed in an instant to be lifted from my soul. That cold, incisive, ironical voice could belong to but one man in all the world. “[MASK]!”
<name>Phileas</name>	Phileas	Holmes	“And also,” said [MASK], “that someone is not ill-disposed towards you, since they warn you of danger.” “Or it may be that they wish, for their own purposes, to scare me away.”
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Holmes	“I observed it as you entered the room,” said [MASK]. “It is an old manuscript.” “Early eighteenth century, unless it is a forgery.” “How can you say that, sir?”
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Watson	“My dear [MASK], you were born to be a man of action. Your instinct is always to do something energetic. But supposing, for argument’s sake, that we had him arrested tonight, what on earth the better off should we be for that?
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Frankland	It was on his track, and not upon the convict’s, that [MASK] had stumbled. If I could get his knowledge it might save me a long and weary hunt. But incredulity and indifference were evidently my strongest cards.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Holmes	The moon shone on it, and it looked like a great shimmering ice-field, with the heads of the distant tors as rocks borne upon its surface. [MASK]’s face was turned towards it, and he muttered impatiently as he watched its sluggish drift.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Watson	“It’s moving towards us, [MASK].” “Is that serious?” “Very serious, indeed--the one thing upon earth which could have disarranged my plans. He can’t be very long, now. It is already ten o’clock.
<name>Stapleton</name>	Stapleton	Hugo	Whereat [MASK] ran from the house, crying to his grooms that they should saddle his mare and unkennel the pack, and giving the hounds a kerchief of the maid’s, he swung them to the line, and so off full cry in the moonlight over the moor.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Holmes	“I said, sir, to the precisely scientific mind. But as a practical man of affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone. I trust, sir, that I have not inadvertently--” “Just a little,” said [MASK].
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Watson	“And so could I--from which I gather that in all probability it was a false one. A clever man upon so delicate an errand has no use for a beard save to conceal his features. Come in here, [MASK]!”
<name>Stapleton</name>	Stapleton	Holmes	[MASK] sank to his waist as he stepped from the path to seize it, and had we not been there to drag him out he could never have set his foot upon firm land again. He held an old black boot in the air.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Baskerville	It needed but this to complete the grim suggestiveness of the barren waste, the chilling wind, and the darkling sky. Even [MASK] fell silent and pulled his overcoat more closely around him. We had left the fertile country behind and beneath us.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Holmes	“There is no object in our following them,” said [MASK]. “The shadow has departed and will not return. We must see what further cards we have in our hands and play them with decision. Could you swear to that man’s face within the cab?”
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Watson	I’ll be able to tell you more clearly then how this thing strikes me.” “Is that convenient to you, [MASK]?” “Perfectly.” “Then you may expect us. Shall I have a cab called?”
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Watson	“What do you say, [MASK]?” I shrugged my shoulders. “If he were safely out of the country it would relieve the tax-payer of a burden.” “But how about the chance of his holding someone up before he goes?”
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Holmes	But then I remembered the pile of papers and bills with which his study table was littered. It was certain that I could not help with those. And [MASK] had expressly said that I should study the neighbours upon the moor.
<name>Milverton</name>	Milverton	Stapleton	[MASK] himself seems to have been capable of jealousy, and when he saw the baronet paying court to the lady, even though it was part of his own plan, still he could not help interrupting with a passionate outburst which revealed the fiery soul which his self-contained manner so cleverly concealed.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Watson	“There go two of my threads, [MASK]. There is nothing more stimulating than a case where everything goes against you. We must cast round for another scent.” “We have still the cabman who drove the spy.” “Exactly.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Holmes	“There’s no doubt about the authenticity, for the name and the date, 1647, are on the back of the canvas.” [MASK] said little more, but the picture of the old roysterer seemed to have a fascination for him, and his eyes were continually fixed upon it during supper.
<name>Stapleton</name>	Stapleton	Stapleton	Your interview with the lady has cleared the situation very much. I did not know about a projected divorce between herself and her husband. In that case, regarding [MASK] as an unmarried man, she counted no doubt upon becoming his wife.”
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Stapleton	“Excellent!” said [MASK]. “You are perfectly right to be wary and discreet. I am justly reproved for what I feel was an unjustifiable intrusion, and I promise you that I will not mention the matter again.”
<name>Stapleton</name>	Stapleton	Stapleton	I accepted [MASK]’s invitation, and we turned together down the path. “It is a wonderful place, the moor,” said he, looking round over the undulating downs, long green rollers, with crests of jagged granite foaming up into fantastic surges.
<name>Lord John</name>	Lord John	Holmes	We caught the one clear glimpse of it, and then the match flickered and went out, even as the hope had gone out of our souls. [MASK] groaned, and his face glimmered white through the darkness. “The brute! The brute!”
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Holmes	I was glad enough to agree. First we drove down to the Northumberland Hotel and waited there until two gentlemen came out and took a cab from the rank. We followed their cab until it pulled up somewhere near here.” “This very door,” said [MASK].
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Frankland	It was several miles off, but I could distinctly see a small dark dot against the dull green and gray. “Come, sir, come!” cried [MASK], rushing upstairs. “You will see with your own eyes and judge for yourself.”
<name>Anderson</name>	Anderson	Barrymore	But one false statement was made by [MASK] at the inquest. He said that there were no traces upon the ground round the body. He did not observe any. But I did--some little distance off, but fresh and clear.” “Footprints?”
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Holmes	There was a thrill in the doctor’s voice which showed that he was himself deeply moved by that which he told us. [MASK] leaned forward in his excitement and his eyes had the hard, dry glitter which shot from them when he was keenly interested.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Holmes	Now it burst upon our ears, nearer, louder, more urgent than before. “Where is it?” [MASK] whispered; and I knew from the thrill of his voice that he, the man of iron, was shaken to the soul.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Holmes	“Well, he asked me for anything outside the ordinary routine.” “Exactly,” said [MASK], “however foolish the incident may seem. You have lost one of your boots, you say?” “Well, mislaid it, anyhow.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Lestrade	Already our friend’s eyelids shivered and he made a feeble effort to move. [MASK] thrust his brandy-flask between the baronet’s teeth, and two frightened eyes were looking up at us. “My God!” he whispered. “What was it?
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Watson	You have been inside the house, have you not, [MASK]? Can you tell the position of the rooms? What are those latticed windows at this end?” “I think they are the kitchen windows.” “And the one beyond, which shines so brightly?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lestrade	“Here, [MASK], your brandy-bottle! Put her in the chair! She has fainted from ill-usage and exhaustion.” She opened her eyes again. “Is he safe?” she asked. “Has he escaped?”
<name>Barrymore</name>	Barrymore	Barrymore	“Now, listen to me, [MASK]! I have no interest in this matter but that of your master. I have come here with no object except to help him. Tell me, frankly, what it is that you don’t like.”
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Watson	“And yet, my dear [MASK], there is so very close a connection that the one is extracted out of the other. ‘You,’ ‘your,’ ‘your,’ ‘life,’ ‘reason,’ ‘value,’ ‘keep away,’ ‘from the.’
<name>Gregson</name>	Gregson	Mortimer	What do you make of that?” “[MASK] said that the man had walked on tiptoe down that portion of the alley.” “He only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest. Why should a man walk on tiptoe down the alley?”
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Holmes	Someone, then, cut out the message with a pair of short-bladed scissors, pasted it with paste--” “Gum,” said [MASK]. “With gum on to the paper. But I want to know why the word ‘moor’ should have been written?”
<name>Milverton</name>	Milverton	Barrymore	“[MASK] considers that he has a grievance,” he said. “He thinks that it was unfair on our part to hunt his brother-in-law down when he, of his own free will, had told us the secret.”
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Holmes	“And how much was the residue?” “Seven hundred and forty thousand pounds.” [MASK] raised his eyebrows in surprise. “I had no idea that so gigantic a sum was involved,” said he.
<name>Stapleton</name>	Stapleton	Stapleton	Both of them were smoking cigars, and coffee and wine were in front of them. [MASK] was talking with animation, but the baronet looked pale and distrait. Perhaps the thought of that lonely walk across the ill-omened moor was weighing heavily upon his mind.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Holmes	I married, and so left the hospital, and with it all hopes of a consulting practice. It was necessary to make a home of my own.” “Come, come, we are not so far wrong, after all,” said [MASK].
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Holmes	“I am so very glad,” said he. “I was not sure whether I had left it here or in the Shipping Office. I would not lose that stick for the world.” “A presentation, I see,” said [MASK].
<name>George</name>	George	George	Even in dry seasons it is a danger to cross it, but after these autumn rains it is an awful place. And yet I can find my way to the very heart of it and return alive. By [MASK], there is another of those miserable ponies!”
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Watson	The man is certainly a country practitioner. And he walks a good deal.” “Then I was right.” “To that extent.” “But that was all.” “No, no, my dear [MASK], not all--by no means all.
<name>Rodger</name>	Rodger	Stapleton	There only remains one difficulty. If [MASK] came into the succession, how could he explain the fact that he, the heir, had been living unannounced under another name so close to the property? How could he claim it without causing suspicion and inquiry?”
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Holmes	She broke into passionate sobbing as she spoke. “You bear him no good will, madam,” said [MASK]. “Tell us then where we shall find him. If you have ever aided him in evil, help us now and so atone.”
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Frankland	Then I followed [MASK] into his dining-room. “It is a great day for me, sir--one of the red-letter days of my life,” he cried with many chuckles. “I have brought off a double event.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Holmes	[MASK] shrugged his shoulders. “I have hitherto confined my investigations to this world,” said he. “In a modest way I have combated evil, but to take on the Father of Evil himself would, perhaps, be too ambitious a task.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Stapleton	She would not endeavour to entangle the old gentleman in a sentimental attachment which might deliver him over to his enemy. Threats and even, I am sorry to say, blows refused to move her. She would have nothing to do with it, and for a time [MASK] was at a deadlock.
<name>Thurstan</name>	Thurstan	Holmes	“My God!” he whispered. “What was it? What, in heaven’s name, was it?” “It’s dead, whatever it is,” said [MASK]. “We’ve laid the family ghost once and forever.”
