<name>Nelson</name>	Nelson	Bornfree	It’s nice, the way they are marching, and so we all look at one another and smile. [MASK]’s coffin is draped by a flag with black, red, yellow, and green stripes, with a white heart on the front.
<name>someone</name>	someone	MaMoyo	I hate babies, so I don’t smile when [MASK]’s baby looks at me with his crazy bullfrog eyes. To make it worse, he is an ugly baby; his face looks shocked, like he has just seen the buttocks of a snake.
<name>she</name>	she	Sbho	He looks at the camera like he doesn’t know where to look. A man dressed in khaki stands in front of a field of maize. A man and woman are getting married, surrounded by happy people carrying drinks in their hands. It’s like a museum, [MASK] said.
<name>Lena</name>	Lena	Sbho	She is biting her lower lip and untwisting the wire, which is struggling in her hands. [MASK] emerges from behind a bush carrying a twisted metal cup, half of a man’s brown leather belt, and a purple round thingy I don’t know what it is.
<name>Bonnie</name>	Bonnie	Kristal	I say. Uh-huh, I beg your pardon, my ass, trynna sound like stupid white folk, she says. What did you say? I say. You heard me, shit, [MASK] says. The car slows down a little bit.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Dumi	[MASK] only shakes his head; I can tell from his face that he is embarrassed and doesn’t really know what to do anymore. He had too much candy earlier, he says, his voice explaining-like, and I want to laugh because what has candy really got to do with a spoiled kid?
<name>Kambili</name>	Kambili	Chipo	[MASK] does not waste time, maybe because she’s afraid of dying; she quickly gets on the ntsaro and lies flat on her back, her eyes squinted against the sun. I begin gathering small stones, and after I pick maybe seven I change my mind.
<name>Boris</name>	Boris	Bastard	How do you know? [MASK] says, slapping a poster onto a door. He does it so hard that the tin trembles, and a voice inside says, You, you damage my B2 door and I’ll make you wipe your asses with razor blades, fools!
<name>God</name>	God	Godknows	He has stood up now and has both his hands on his egg-shaped head. Then it starts raining, like maybe [MASK] has made it rain by all his talking. It’s fight rain, the kind that just licks you.
<name>Wendy</name>	Wendy	Godknows	they yell down below. Then the tall one in the red overalls, the one who’s brandishing an ax, goes to the big window. We hear the sound of shattering glass. They have broken the window! [MASK] says. Shhhh, shut up, somebody whispers.
<name>Chris</name>	Chris	Jim	When I first saw their pretty little tents and food piled on tables, I laughed at how they were trying to pretend they knew what suffering was. The parking lot is almost deserted save for [MASK]’s big blue van, a couple of cars, and a red bike.
<name>TV</name>	TV	CNN	Then I begin drying my hands. I mean, I can’t even—I can’t even process it. And all those poor women and children. I was watching [MASK] last night and there was this little girl who was just—just too cute, she says.
<name>her</name> (There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to a female character who is not previously mentioned in the passage.)	her (There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to a female character who is not previously mentioned in the passage.)	Chipo	You forget? Oh, I say. We wait in silence, maybe because neither of us can think of anything to say. I’m picturing [MASK] there all by herself, and I can’t help but feel sorry for her, feel bad for her.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Godknows	It’s fight rain, the kind that just licks you. We sit in it and smell the delicious earth around us. Me, I want my mother, [MASK] says after a long while. His voice is choking in the rain and I look at his face and it’s wet
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Bastard	Besides, what does it matter? [MASK] says. Because you just heard me say I like the house, so you are not supposed to do anything to it. Why don’t you pick another that I don’t care about, they’re many houses here!
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Chipo	[MASK] says when she comes on the phone. What’s happening? I say. I hear another scream from downstairs. A fat fly flies across the living room and sits on a pizza that somebody left lying around. I pick up a newspaper to kill it
<name>her</name> (There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to a female pronoun)	her (There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to a female pronoun)	Kristal	It’s [MASK] who is busy talking but I’m not even listening to her; I’m looking to see where all this is going, and how. At one point the car swerves to the left and I inhale sharply and get ready to scream
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Stupidity	I mean, if it’s not bravery, then I don’t know what it is. [MASK]? Ah, what a waste, and such a fine-ass brother too. But the things people will do for these papers, my sister, I tell you.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Prayer	[MASK] is a parent now? When did it happen, when did all these children have their own children? That is how time went. It flew and we did not see it flying. We did not go back home to visit be-
<name>u</name>	u	Marina	I reach for the Juicy Fruit gum pack on the nightstand, take two pieces, peel the wrappers. I pop the gum in my mouth and chew slowly, the sweet taste exploding on my tongue, u weren’t thr, [MASK] texts, wtevr. guess wht?
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Bastard	We’ll see, [MASK] said, with this look like he knew something I didn’t. When I was in the car and pulling off I kissed my hand and waved like I’d seen an NGO lady do one time and shouted, I’ll write, always, always, always!
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bastard	The bull bellows and bellows, struggling against its captors and trying to charge after the coffin. I look at [MASK] and see he has tears in his eyes, which surprises me. When he sees I’m looking at him he frowns and turns his face away.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Tony	[MASK]’s body was pressed tight behind mine like it would take a saw to separate us, his hands up and down my sides, groping my stomach. He was breathing hot air on my neck and I could feel his hard thing on my butt.
<name>Chang</name>	Chang	Godknows	We stuff ourselves and we stuff ourselves, stuff ourselves until we almost cannot breathe. I want to defecate, [MASK] says, and we all leave the kitchen to hunt for the toilet. Our stomachs are so full they could explode.
<name>she</name>	she	Kate	but I’m just gonna take a shower first, [MASK] says. Her voice sounds far away, like maybe it was detained at the border or something. She follows the father upstairs; I wonder where the mother is, but it’s not my place to ask.
<name>mom</name>	mom	Kyle	I pause to look at the vibrating phone, finish the circle, then pick it up. sowwy, [MASK], hd 2 talk 2 him 4 a min, the text reads, k, I text. On the wall, my letters are large, like how I used to write in grade one.
<name>protesting</name>	protesting	Occupying	Two police cars boil down the street, sirens wailing; now when I see a police car in this neighborhood, I don’t even look surprised. Across the street, at the park with the two-cents grass, the Occupy people are holding up their signs, [MASK].
<name>Bono</name>	Bono	Kunzima	We bought food and clothes for the families left behind; we paid school fees for the little ones. We got messages that said Hunger; that said Help, that said [MASK], and we sent money. When we were asked, You guys work so hard, why do y’all work so hard?
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Sbho	They are going to kill us, [MASK] says. I can’t see her face because she is on a branch right behind me, but I know, just from the tremor in her voice, how tears are already streaming down her cheeks and that they will eventually get into her mouth.
<name>Cheryl</name>	Cheryl	Godknows	My voice rings in the empty street and I laugh and do a hop-step-and-jump. Ah, shut up, you, Bastard says. Let’s just look for guavas and leave this clown alone, [MASK] says.
<name>Joey</name>	Joey	TK	When the microwave says nting again, he takes out the chicken wings. And then it’s the burritos and hot dogs. Eat eat eat. All that food [MASK] eats in one day, me and Mother and Mother of Bones would eat in maybe two or three days back home.
<name>Bimbo</name>	Bimbo	Jim	And I know that clown [MASK] was gonna let her go too because he’s trynna get into her panties, she says. Hmmn, I say. I mean, she only just started working here and already she’s asking for favors. Who does that?
<name>the victim</name>	the victim	Bornfree	But we only laugh and keep hitting. Hitting hitting hitting. In all this, [MASK] doesn’t even make a sound. There is blood everywhere, so much blood, just blood. Then we stop the beating and somebody says, Get up and go.
<name>Baby Suggs</name>	Baby Suggs	MaDube	She is in pain; you can see and hear for yourself that this is proper pain. Pain-pain. Other women are holding on to [MASK] like they heard the lion will leap skyward and rip the sun into bloody chunks. The mourners stop and form a circle.
<name>Uncertain</name>	Uncertain	Godknows	I know from his voice that he is smiling his wide smile. That’s nice, [MASK], I say. Yes, it is nice, he says. There is silence again, but it’s broken by a long scream coming from the basement, followed by giggles.
<name>his</name>	his	Mandla	When he looks at me I give him a serious eye that says, You are just too much and you need to stop that nonsense before something happens. But I know, from [MASK]’s grin, that he doesn’t even get it, that they have not taught him anything about reading eyes.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Sbho	Pee in this, [MASK] says, and hands me the twisted cup. There is a spider and a web inside so I get a stick to squash the spider, but then I just decide to flip the cup and bang it against a rock instead.
<name>Caleb</name>	Caleb	Godknows	It’s the first time we are entering a white people’s house so we pause by the door, like we don’t know how to walk through a door. [MASK], who is at the front, wipes his feet on the mat that says Wipe Your Paws
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Godknows	Now we have to decide if it actually breaks into people’s homes or just ambushes them in the forest, [MASK] says. That doesn’t even make sense. Why does it need to grow fat and strong if it’s a devil? Isn’t it all that already?
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	MotherLove	They look at the tiny packages like they don’t want them, like they are embarrassed and disappointed by them, but in the end they turn and head back to the shacks with the things. It’s [MASK] alone who does not join the line for food.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	TK	I gasp as it connects to the mask, cover my ears when they both crash onto the floor. I don’t look to check the damage, I just get out of my room like the air has been sucked out. I find myself standing in [MASK]’s room, right in front of his bed.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Ncuncu	Maybe [MASK] heard us. Maybe she didn’t. She remained there, right in the middle of the road, head bent toward something we couldn’t see; you would have thought she was praying for the country. The big Lobels lorry came out of nowhere.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Stina	If we don’t make noise, if we just stay here and be quiet, they won’t see us. They’ll just pass, then we’ll go, [MASK] says in a whisper, sounding like he is somebody’s sweet mother.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Bastard	Liar, you’re lying, [MASK] says. You don’t have measles and you’re not sick and you haven’t been sick. He is standing on one leg like a cock and chewing a blade of grass.
<name>Unknown</name>	Unknown	Marina	I don’t recognize it, maybe a European language or something. I stand there for a while, my face pressing against the screen. When I turn the lights back on and look at the phone [MASK] has texted, ????? lol, no.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bastad	It reads [MASK]; he has left out the r but I doubt he even knows this. After a long while, after we are tired from sitting in the tree, the smashing stops and they come out of the house. The boss walks in front, ax dangling at his side.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Ma’am	Now she has scribbled the word angel all over the magazine, and the naked woman with the bra and underwear is all clothed in black ink, the letters like tiny angry insects. [MASK], I’m terribly sorry we’re having these— difficulties.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Mandla	[MASK] snatches the ball, walks back to our table. He is obviously enjoying himself. When he looks at me I give him a serious eye that says, You are just too much and you need to stop that nonsense before something happens.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Marina	Then the knife woman bends toward the girl, teeth digging into the bottom lip, fat fingers wound tight around the knife. When the knife reaches the girl, [MASK] gets up, and we hear her running up the stairs.
<name>Kamala</name>	Kamala	Messenger	She calls everybody my son or my daughter; I think that’s because she cannot remember all the names. Well, your God is listening because the change everybody’s been crying for is finally here, [MASK] says.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Marina	[MASK] says her mother sleeps like she’s dead but if she happens to wake to go to the bathroom, she keeps her eyes shut, staggering and bumping into stuff like a chicken with its head cut off; if she were to go outside, she wouldn’t see nothing.
<name>probably</name>	probably	Stina	I look around to see if there are other people within earshot. It’s like hiding a thing with horns in a sack. One day the horns will start boring through the sack and come out in the open for everybody to see, [MASK] says.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Annamaria	When I wave to him he starts to cry, and [MASK] looks at me with a peppered eye and says, Leave my son alone, ugly, can’t you see you’re scaring him? Inside the shack.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Christopher	Maybe next year, [MASK] and I will go on our wedding anniversary. Oops, speaking of which, I better get my butt up there, she says, and she gets up and starts toward the door, opens it, and disappears like she was never there.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	MotherLove	Look at me when I talk to you, child, [MASK] says. She brings her face close to mine like she wants to kiss me. Her eyes are large, the white part like it’s been dipped in milk.
<name>Pearl</name>	Pearl	Bones	She says it playing-like, laughing-like, but if you knew her well, like I know her, then you would know that she is in fact mad that they got here before she did. Mother of [MASK] likes being the first in everything.
<name>Mr. Antolini</name>	Mr. Antolini	Jim	One glance, and the Miller bottles are shattering at my feet, shards of glass dancing all over the dirty floor. By the time [MASK] rushes out of the office to see what’s happening, I’m standing on the table near the box-crusher thingy, screaming, my feet next to the microwave.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Chipo	I pick up a newspaper to kill it but when I look up it is gone. Yes, outside. What do you see when you look outside? Are there people and what are they doing? [MASK] says. I look outside, through the lace curtain.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Stina	I said. Because you’ll have found some pretty white friends and forgotten us, he said. I’ll have some pretty white friends but that doesn’t mean I’ll forget you, I said. Out of sight out of mind, [MASK] said.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Sbho	We look around, surprised. How is it cold in here when it is so hot outside? [MASK] says in a whisper, but nobody answers her, which means we don’t know. Around us everything is strewn about and bro- ken.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Jim	It comes out of the bottle of Miller in my hands; I’m still standing there looking at [MASK]’s door thinking about what they are doing when I feel something crawling up my arm. One glance, and the Miller bottles are shattering at my feet, shards of glass dancing all over the dirty floor.
<name>Satoshi</name>	Satoshi	Stina	When people die because they are killed they become ghosts and roam the earth because they are not resting in peace, [MASK] says. We turn to look at him; he is standing there and not taking his eyes off the grave, like it’s his.
<name>Reverend</name>	Reverend	Mborro	The jacaranda trees that fine the streets in town—do they still bloom that dizzying purple? Is that crazy Prophet Revelations Bitchington [MASK] still there? He prayed for me to get my visa, can you believe it?
<name>Tyrone</name>	Tyrone	Dumi	I don’t even know what. The tall husband, [MASK], is sitting there beside the bride in his white suit. He has this smile that never goes away, his tinted dreadlocks reach his shoulders, and his body looks like a stick in comparison to his wife’s.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Stina	When I step on a branch and it crackles, [MASK] looks at me and frowns, a finger on his Ups. I frown back to tell him to leave me alone, nobody will see us with all these leaves, or hear us with all the noise.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	MaDube	Maybe if it were not for all this snow lying all over, she would be walking outside, like how a person is supposed to do. [MASK] used to walk like this too, just walk and walk and walk, not really going anywhere in particular.
<name>Sam's</name>	Sam's	Sbho	We’re hungry but we’re together and we’re at home and everything is sweeter than dessert. Are you there? I said, what are you doing? It’s [MASK]’s voice. Nothing, I say. Nothing? You mean nothing-nothing?
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Marina	Maybe I start freaking out, I don’t know, but [MASK] is pulling me away and asking what’s wrong with me. Do you know how much that car costs? she says when we’re out of the parking lot. How much? I say.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	MaDube	but [MASK] thrashes about like a fish out of water, like a possessed snake, screaming and screaming. Screaming screaming screaming. Let me go! Let me go and rescue my son! Why isn’t anybody rescuing my son! Why are you all standing there watching!
<name>him</name>	him	Stina	We clap and cheer for him, then we watch the car like maybe it’s a bride. Unlike [MASK], I don’t know much about cars, like I can’t look at one and tell you what kind it is, but even I can see that this is an interesting car.
<name>her</name>	her	Marina	The ring part is twisted, and the head is made of diamonds that form a cluster like tiny seeds. The price tag says $22,050, and I start to tell [MASK] that her store is crazy when my teeth miss the gum and I bite the inside of my lip.
<name>Augustus</name>	Augustus	Godknows	, but I do it inside my head. It’s my first time ever hearing this word. I try to think what it means but I get tired of grinding my brains so I just give up. And how old are you? [MASK] asks her.
<name>John</name>	John	Hallo	I am the one who speaks better English, so I say, [MASK], how are you, how can I help you this afternoon? Who is this? a voice says on the other end. It is surprised, the way you sound when you find something you were not expecting.
<name>her sister</name>	her sister	TK	she asks, turning back to [MASK] and myself, and we answer her with silence. We were supposed to be at the wedding an hour and a half ago, an hour and a half! Where is my navigator? What did he do with it?
<name>blind</name>	blind	Andy	Who is it? I shout back, even though I don’t like being called cabbage ears. I have soap all over my face so I can’t really open my eyes. Were going to play [MASK]-over, what are you bathing for?
<name>Darling</name>	Darling	Godknows	We Need New Names ?<*A Tool don’t play Find bin Laden or country-game or Andy-over or anything. We just go to sit quietly under the jacaranda all morning and all afternoon. Maybe they’re just not coming back, [MASK] says.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Godknows	Earrings made from colorful seeds. Bright patches of cloth sewn onto a skirt. We haven’t seen the women look like this in a while and their beauty makes us want to love them. What happens when the adults go and vote? [MASK] asks.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Megan	The double doors open and close like a mouth, swallowing him. Yeah, he’s right, [MASK] says. She has put the phone away again and is now just sitting there with legs crossed at the ankles, smoking and looking at the passing cars.
<name>Mark</name>	Mark	Jim	When I feel a hand on my shoulder, I jump. Then I turn around and [MASK] is standing there grinning. He has this thing of just touching my body, like maybe he knows me like that, and I don’t like it.
<name>Rocky</name>	Rocky	Godknows	He puts the rolled-up paper in his mouth, reaches into his tracksuit, and takes out a box of matches. We all watch him light up his cigarette and smoke it. What are you doing? I say. Can’t you see he’s practicing? [MASK] says.
<name>mom</name>	mom	Eliot	I'm not dealing with you, I say inside my head, and I busy myself with the counters even though I’ve already cleaned them. Hey, there, the place looks great, [MASK] says, coming into the kitchen.
<name>Unknown</name>	Unknown	Darling	Who is this? a voice says on the other end. It is surprised, the way you sound when you find something you were not expecting. It’s me, I say. What? Who are you? [MASK].
<name>Pearl</name>	Pearl	Bones	Nobody likes to talk about him, it’s as if he is something that never even happened, but there are times I have caught Mother of [MASK] muttering, and even though she doesn’t say, I always have a feeling she is muttering to him.
<name>Maradona</name>	Maradona	Bornfree	They do not lower their eyes to the ground; they do not cross their hands behind their backs. They do not measure their footsteps. These ones rush after the coffin. They whistle; they raise their fists. They chant [MASK]’s name like they want him to appear from wherever he is.
<name>Maria</name>	Maria	Khayelitsha	Then she puts her hand over her heart and closes her eyes briefly, like maybe she’s listening to the throb of her kindness. I’m surprised by the way she says [MASK], says it so well, like maybe it’s her language even.
<name>Trinculo</name>	Trinculo	MaDube	Better they— And then, right there, a fountain of blood shoots in the air like an arrow and sprays all over. [MASK]’s hands fly to her chest and she faints. But the pounding doesn’t stop. We chant and sing louder and loudest.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Prince	Do you want to go to bed? Do you prefer this or that? Are you sure?—as if I have become a real person. [MASK] is talking to himself more and more, like maybe the people in his head have really come out and he can see them.
<name>Bambi</name>	Bambi	Marina	When [MASK] starts the film again, the man is already inside the woman, so she rewinds a little bit, stops it when the woman is getting up from her knees, licking her lips like she has just kissed some sugar.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Jim	It’s just a cockroach, [MASK] says, turning around to give me a look, his voice sounding like he is really talking about just a cockroach. Now it has parked itself next to a can of Heineken like it’s trying to hear what’s being said.
<name>she</name>	she	Megan	But other than that, it’s not gonna happen, hell to the no. I have seniority, you know what I’m saying? I don’t know what [MASK] is saying but I still nod. Her phone beeps and she rummages inside her purse and fishes it out.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Fostalina	Well, go, go to that America and work in nursing homes. That’s what your aunt [MASK] is doing as we speak. Right now she is busy cleaning kaka off some wrinkled old man who can’t do anything for himself, you think we’ve never heard the stories?
<name>him</name>	him	Forgiveness	Then when I’m beginning to think the pee is really not coming, it comes, so I turn around and give [MASK] a talking eye that says Say something, uh-uh, uh-uh. Afterwards I pick up the cup carefully, it is warm now, and the foam reaches about halfway.
<name>Bernie</name>	Bernie	Bornfree	Yes, it is, you watch, [MASK] adds. He waves his stack of papers and I see the words Change, Real Change at the front. His voice is bright and bold, like the red ink on his posters.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Darling	I don’t say anything because I’m not sure what’s the right thing to say. The last time I spoke to her was maybe two, three weeks ago. Four weeks; I don’t remember. [MASK], am I not talking to you?
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Godknows	[MASK] said. Why wouldn’t I write? I said. Because you’ll have found some pretty white friends and forgotten us, he said. I’ll have some pretty white friends but that doesn’t mean I’ll forget you, I said.
<name>Dee</name>	Dee	Kristal	You don’t know nothin, [MASK] says after a while, turning to give me a look like I’m the one that’s stinking up the car. First of all, it’s called Ebonics and it be a language system, but it be our own, naamean, coz we ain’t trynna front.
<name>Gregor</name>	Gregor	Bornfree	There is blood everywhere, so much blood, just blood. Then we stop the beating and somebody says, Get up and go. Get up. But [MASK] cannot stand. He crawls on the ground, slowly, slooooooowly, like a fat, poisoned cockroach.
<name>Melinda</name>	Melinda	Sbho	Is it painful? [MASK] says. She is looking at me with her head tilted-like, the way a mother is supposed to do when you tell her about anything serious. Yes, it is, I say. And then I add, It itches.
<name>Beowulf</name>	Beowulf	Bornfree	They are wild, chanting and screaming and yelling and baring teeth and waving weapons in the air, and I’m reminded of the gang that came for [MASK]; that is how they did. One group charges in our direction. They kick down the gate, pass right beneath us.
<name>Martin Luther King</name>	Martin Luther King	Prince	There are crowds and crowds of white people and black people and brown people, just people, and they are happy and cheering and clapping. [MASK] looks at it all with tears in his eyes and shakes my hand until I think he wants to break it and says, See?
