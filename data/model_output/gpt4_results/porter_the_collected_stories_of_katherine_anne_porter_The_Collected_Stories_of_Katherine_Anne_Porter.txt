<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Annetje	Sometimes I took [MASK]’s next to youngest child, a baby of two years, in her little wagon, and we would go down through the orchard, where the branches were beginning to sprout in cones of watery green, and into the lane for a short distance.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Tadeusz	Then it passed. “Hell,” he said, aloud, yet to no one, “what of it?” “I think so too,” said [MASK], “I think, hell, what of it?”
<name>Mrs. Verloc</name>	Mrs. Verloc	Ottilie	[MASK], now silent, was doubled upon herself, slipping loosely on the edge of the seat. I caught hold of her stout belt with my free hand, and my fingers slipped between her clothes and bare flesh, ribbed and gaunt and dry against my knuckles.
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Miranda	[MASK], hearing the words one by one, forgot them one by one. “Oh, read it again, what does it say?” she called out over the silence that pressed upon her, reaching towards the dancing words that just escaped as she almost touched them.
<name>Johnsy</name>	Johnsy	Stephen	“When you get through with that one,” said [MASK], gazing at her with the pure bliss of giving added to loving, “you can blow up a blue one and then a pink one and a yellow one and a purple one.”
<name>Rosie</name>	Rosie	Ninette	and when she started to speak to the madam, the madam said, Shut up and get upstairs and dress yourself. So [MASK], this girl, she said, I’ll be down in just a minute. And after that she lived there quietly.
<name>Severian</name>	Severian	Charles	“I was wondering why you came here. Why this city, of all places? You may go where you please, isn’t that so?” “I suppose so,” said [MASK]. “Yes, that’s true.”
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Charles	The barber, sad enough at his gayest, drooped rather more as he tapered [MASK]’ hair almost imperceptibly towards the neck; and to change the whole topic he spoke of the weather. The last day or two had been mild, even milder than anyone thought, for it had deceived the storks.
<name>European</name>	European	Swede	It seems like up in them [MASK] countries a man carries a bottle of wine around with him as a matter of course, at least that’s the way I understood it. Those fellers will tell you anything, though—” He broke off and spat.
<name>popular</name>	popular	Kapital	I only know that with my first land here I made good crops to buy more land, and so I rent it cheap, more than anybody else I rent it cheap, I lend money so my neighbors do not fall into the hands of the bank, and so I am not [MASK].
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Miriam	There was such a special kind of beauty in [MASK]. In certain lights and moods he simply got a clutch in the pit of his stomach when he looked at her. It was something that could happen at any hour of the day, in the midst of the most ordinary occupations.
<name>Lucienne</name>	Lucienne	Miranda	The drifting circle widened, separated, and each figure was alone but not solitary; [MASK], alone too, questioning nothing, desiring nothing, in the quietude of her ecstasy, stayed where she was, eyes fixed on the overwhelming deep sky where it was always morning.
<name>Phoenix</name>	Phoenix	Miranda	It said Weep, weep, weep, three times like that slowly, and it seemed to come from the mound of dirt. “My goodness,” [MASK] asked herself aloud, “what’s that?” She pushed her bonnet off her ears and listened hard.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Juan	She had paid for the license, nearly a year ago, the potent bit of stamped paper which permits people to be married in the church. She had given money to the priest before she and [MASK] walked together up to the altar the Monday after Holy Week.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Miranda	“No,” said [MASK], “and it matters even less if you’re staying at home knitting socks. Give me a cigarette, will you?” They paused at another corner, under a half-foliaged maple, and hardly glanced at a funeral procession approaching.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Harry	His face was sagging, the features had fallen as if the flesh had slipped from the bones, and his eyelids were puffed and blue. “Good-by, [MASK],” he said soberly. “How long you expect to be here?”
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Blanca	It gave her time to dream about life— that is, the future. For of course everything beautiful and unexpected would happen later on, when she grew as tall as [MASK] and was allowed to come home from the convent for good and all.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Dennis	“Whyever,” she asked him, in an ordinary voice, “did ye marry a woman like me?” “Mind you don’t tip over in that chair now,” said [MASK]. “I knew well I could never do better.”
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Andreyev	He hasn’t been director of the Jewel for, oh, ages!” I observed the Failure. He seemed cheerful enough. He was beating time with the handle of his spoon and humming a song to [MASK], who listened, nodding his head.
<name>Wolfe</name>	Wolfe	Bill	“I didn’t mean a thing.” [MASK] had been raging about, chewing his half-smoked cigar, his hair standing up in a brush, his eyes soft and lambent but wild, like a stag’s.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dennis	“With two pairs of socks and the chest protector, for if anything happened to you, whatever would become of me in this world?” “Let’s not think of it,” said [MASK], shuffling his feet.
<name>Michelangelo</name>	Michelangelo	Rivera	He was very sleek and slim-waisted and devoted, he said, to fresco painting, “only modern,” he told me, “like [MASK]’s, the method, but not old-fashioned style like his.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Bill	So I’m stuck, absolutely stuck,” said [MASK], on the edge of weeping again. “I’ve been crying,” he told her, “in my cups.” And he went on to ask her if she realized his wife was ruining him with her extravagance.
<name>he</name>	he	Chuck	While he was reading she watched his face. It was a pleasant face with some kind of spark of life in it, and a good severity in the modeling of the brow above the nose. For the first time since she had known him she wondered what [MASK] was thinking about.
<name>She</name>	She	Miriam	He went on in his pawky way trying to make clear to her his mystical faith in these men who went ragged and hungry because they had chosen once for all between what he called in all seriousness their souls, and this world. [MASK] knew better.
<name>Mrs. Kearney</name>	Mrs. Kearney	Grandmother	The clothes were not even romantic looking, but merely most terribly out of fashion, and the whole affair was associated, in the minds of the little girls, with dead things: the smell of [MASK]’s medicated cigarettes and her furniture that smelled of beeswax, and her old-fashioned perfume, Orange Flower.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Dennis	She tucked [MASK] into bed with great tenderness and sat by him a few minutes, putting cold cream on her face. “It won’t be for long,” she told him, “and you’re well taken care of the whole time.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Adam	“Hold it, as you were,” called [MASK], fetching the basin. He held her head, washed her face and hands with ice water, put her head straight on the pillow, and went over and looked out of the window.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Ottilie	We stood about and ate in silence. [MASK] brought in a fresh pot of coffee, her eyes bleared and fixed, her gait as aimless-looking and hurried as ever, and when she spilled some on her own hand, she did not seem to feel it.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Frances	This was the first real dismay of his whole life, and he aged at least a year in the next minute, huddled, with his deep, serious blue eyes focused down his nose in intense speculation. What could he do to please [MASK] that would not cost money?
<name>he</name>	he	Jaime	“I told her,” said the journalist, “it was because probably he hadn’t got any other shirt.” And why was [MASK] such a glutton, leaning over his plate and wolfing his food? Because he was famished, no doubt.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Charles	No more of those table rugs with their nasty sweet colors. If the corner whatnot should be knocked over, just once, there would be no more of that silly bric-a-brac and a good thing too, thought [MASK], hardening his heart.
<name>Rover</name>	Rover	Kuno	[MASK] was barking, the sheep were baaing and bleating, the horses freed from the ploughs were excited; they whinnied and trotted at the lengths of their halters, their ears laid back. The cows were bawling in distress and the calves cried back to them.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Miranda	They were precisely themselves; their eyes cleared, their voices relaxed into perfect naturalness, they need not weigh their words or calculate the effect of their manner. “It is I who have no place,” thought [MASK]. “Where are my own people and my own time?”
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Miranda	After a short silence, the girl said in a puzzled way, “I don’t know what good it does, really. Some of them wouldn’t take anything at all. I don’t like this, do you?” “I hate it,” said [MASK].
<name>them</name>	them	Blanca	At the sound of her own voice she felt calm and firm and equal to anything. By her tone she tried to shut [MASK] out. They turned and regarded her without interest. “And where may it be, infant?”
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Maria	“Do you take them to the races, actually?” she asked, and her lids flickered towards them as if they were loathsome insects, [MASK] felt. “If I feel they deserve a little treat, yes,” said their father, in an easy tone but with wrinkled brow.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Hatsy	So had all the others. I remembered how [MASK] had spoken her name but had not said she was her sister. Their silence about her was, I realized, exactly that—simple forgetfulness. She moved among them as invisible to their imaginations as a ghost.
<name>Florrie</name>	Florrie	Miranda	They have the prettiest little shapes you ever saw—I’ll show you one some time under the microscope.” “Thank you, ma’am,” [MASK] remembered finally to say through her fog of bliss at hearing the tree frogs sing, “Weep weep . .
<name>Horses</name>	Horses	Burros	All the women seemed to be laughing that night: long after midnight, the high bright sound sparkled again and again from the long row of peon quarters along the corral. [MASK] sobbed and mourned to each other, there was everywhere the drowsy wakefulness of creatures, stamping hoofs, breathing and snorting.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Harry	I had a good time at those parties, even if I wasn’t a belle. And so you are [MASK]’s child, and here I was quarreling with you. You do remember me, don’t you?”
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Charles	“You will find you cannot change your mind for nothing,” said the woman, in a severe, lecturing tone. “Indecision is a very expensive luxury.” “I suppose so,” said [MASK], uneasily watching the notations on the sheet of paper lengthening rapidly.
<name>his parents</name>	his parents	Mommanpoppa	The only people who never seemed to notice there was something wrong with him were [MASK]. They never called him a bad boy, and all summer long they had taken all his clothes off and let him run in the sand beside a big ocean.
<name>Maria</name>	Maria	Anita	A smiling young mother, [MASK], baby at breast, said: “If no one thinks so, how can you accuse her? It was the loss of her child and not of her husband that changed her so.”
<name>Francie</name>	Francie	Miranda	“That is your nest-egg.” “Just so they don’t buy my stockings with it,” said [MASK], who had long resented the use of her Christmas money by their grandmother. “I’ve got enough stockings to last me a year.”
<name>Tim</name>	Tim	Dennis	While they drank she sat fixing the hem of her dress, and began to tell again about the persons without number she’d known who came back from the dead to bring word about themselves, and [MASK] himself would back her up in it.
<name>Seamus</name>	Seamus	Dennis	While the argument went on, they ate nearly all the goose which fairly melted on the tongue, and finished with wedges of cake and floods of tea, and [MASK] had to admit he hadn’t felt better in years.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Kevin	But I don’t.” She knew in her heart no good would come of him running off after that common-looking girl; but it was likely he’d find her out soon, and come back, for [MASK] was nobody’s fool.
<name>Hans</name>	Hans	Kuno	All the Mullers hurried about getting into rubber boots and oilcloth overalls, shouting to each other, making their plan of action. The youngest boy came over the ridge of the hill with [MASK] helping him to drive the sheep down into the fold.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Gabriel	Privately they blessed their luck. “I have been cut off with a dollar,” said [MASK], “and they are all glad of it. I think they feel somehow that this justifies every criticism they ever made against me. They were right about me all along.
<name>Mother</name>	Mother	Grandma	He blew until the beautiful bubble grew and wavered and burst into thin air, and there was only a small colored rag in his hand. This was a fine game. They went on with it until [MASK] came in and said, “Time for supper now.
<name>Pat</name>	Pat	Kevin	“That’s for luck in the new world,” she said, smiling at him. “You might be [MASK] or my own brother, or my own little lad alone in the world, and it’ll surely come back to me if ever I need it.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Miranda	She reached in the other pocket and took out a roundish, rather crushed-looking pink gumdrop with the sugar coating pretty badly crackled. “Now take this, and don’t let me lay eyes on you any more today.” [MASK] hurried away, clenching the gumdrop in her palm.
<name>Brer</name>	Brer	Hosanna	Dat was it. And nary a drop of watah noh a moufful of braid . . . Yassuh, dat’s it. Lawd, dey done it. [MASK]! Now take dis yere tombstone and don’ bother me no more ... or I’ll . . .”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Miranda	[MASK] was crying steadily with an occasional hiccough. A dwarf was standing in the entrance, wearing a little woolly beard, a pointed cap, tight red breeches, long shoes with turned-up toes. He carried a thin white wand.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Dennis	There was a grave, an old one, but with fresh flowers on it, and a name on the headstone cut very clear but as if it was in another language and I couldn’t make it out some way. You came up then and I said, ‘[MASK], what grave is this?’
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Stephen	This is the last time, really the last. I can’t bear it any longer. Say good-by to [MASK]; you’ll never see him again. 3&S You let this happen. It’s your fault.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Gabriel	“[MASK] is dull, Mother—he sulks,” she said. “I could see him sulking every time I passed. It spoils things,” she said. “Oh, I want to go to sleep.”
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Miranda	[MASK] smiled at him gaily because she was always delighted at the sight of him. He was wearing his new uniform, and he was all olive and tan and tawny, hay colored and sand colored from hair to boots.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Miranda	He was twenty-four years old and a Second Lieutenant in an Engineers Corps, on leave because his outfit expected to be sent over shortly. “Came in to make my will,” he told [MASK], “and get a supply of toothbrushes and razor blades.
<name>He</name>	He	Adam	“Do excuse me,” she said, beginning to laugh. “I’m so sorry.” [MASK] without a word and with a very concerned expression washed her face with a wet towel, gave her some cracked ice from one of the packages, and firmly offered her two more pills.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Rosaleen	And never another word for these five years. The wretch, the stump! After he had disappeared down the road with his suitcase strapped on his shoulders, [MASK] had gone back in the house and had looked at herself in the square looking-glass beside the kitchen window.
<name>Shevek</name>	Shevek	Hans	She left him at once, but not before putting a venomous serpent in his bed. However, no harm was done. As he said, it was all okay by him.” [MASK] said, “What are you saying, please?
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Ellie	“Asleep, [MASK]?” After all, he might have got rid of him peaceably, or maybe he might have had to overpower him and put those handcuffs on him and turn him over to the sheriff for disturbing the peace.
<name>Corley</name>	Corley	Dennis	[MASK] growled in his throat a little. “That’s no sign at all,” he said. And to show that he had a grudge against her he laid down his meerschaum pipe, stuffed his old briar and lit it instead.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Miranda	At the head of the stairs her inquisitors had stopped in their fussy pride and vainglory, lighting cigars and wedging their hats more firmly over their eyes. [MASK] turned over in the soothing water, and wished she might fall asleep there, to wake up only when it was time to sleep again.
<name>Macario</name>	Macario	Delgadito	Once he was called [MASK] by all the girls and married women who ran after him; he was so scrawny all his bones showed under his thin cotton clothing, and he could squeeze his emptiness to the very backbone with his two hands.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Frances	“I tell you what,” he said, brightening with a splendid idea, lamely trailing off on second thought, “I know something we can do, I’ll—I . . ” “I am thirsty,” said [MASK] with gentle persistence.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Miranda	“Better take it,” [MASK] told him. “It may be your last.” She thought, This is the beginning of the end of something. Something terrible is going to happen to me. I shan’t need bread and butter where I’m going.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Adam	There was only this one moment and it was a dream of time, and [MASK]’s face, very near hers, eyes still and intent, was a shadow, and there was to be nothing more. . . .
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Adna	“He’d eat it all if I didn’t stop Him. He’d eat up every mouthful from the other two if I’d let Him.” She felt badly about it. He was ten years old now and a third again as large as [MASK], who was going on fourteen.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Stepanov	That kind of thing,” he said, bitterly, “has been happening ever since we got here. Just happens over and over. . . . Now, what was the matter, I wonder?” He stared at [MASK] full of accusation.
<name>Griffith</name>	Griffith	Stepanov	He had spent two early morning hours standing up to his middle in the cold water of the horse fountain, with [MASK] and the camera balanced on the small stone ledge, directing a scene which he was convinced could be made from no other angle.
<name>Werner</name>	Werner	Charles	Almost furtively, [MASK] slipped a mark into the limp hollowed palm, then stepped into the doorway near by, and sheltered by fir trees piled before a shop, their sweet odor in his nostrils, with cold fingers he sketched hastily the stiff figure in its abject garments, surmounted by that skull of famine.
<name>America</name>	America	Bread	[MASK] will win the war. Work will win, sugar will win, peach pits will win the war. Nonsense. Not nonsense, I tell you, there’s some kind of valuable high explosive to be got out of peach pits.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Louise	Anything else led to confusion like this. I was beginning to enjoy my letter to [MASK] when a sturdy boy about twelve years old crossed the platform. As he neared me, he took off his rough cap and bunched it in his thick hand, dirt-stained at the knuckles.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Miranda	She had seen him smash his hat and yell with fury when he had missed his aim. “What I like about shooting,” said [MASK], with exasperating inconsequence, “is pulling the trigger and hearing the noise.”
<name>Macomber</name>	Macomber	Kennedy	Besides, think of the risk of infection from their filthy paws on your luggage handles. It was just damned dangerous, if you asked him. I was thinking that foreigners anywhere traveling were three or four kinds of phonograph records, and of them all I liked [MASK]'s kind the least.
<name>London</name>	London	Louise	Yes, the shingles were stained all the colors she had said. There were the dime novels heaped in the comer. For once, [MASK] had got it straight, and it was homely and familiar, as if I had seen it before.
<name>Stoner</name>	Stoner	Hans	It was there like a change of light, slow and deep, with no perceptible movement of eyelids or face muscles. It rose from within in the mysterious place where [MASK] really lived, and it was amazing arrogance, pleasure, inexpressible vanity and self-satisfaction.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Halloran	“Hey there now, [MASK],” he said, “I mean business this time. You get back upstairs or I’ll run you in. Come along now, I’ll help you get there this time, and that’s the last of it.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Kuno	He and [MASK] did not remember when they had not known each other. Their first recollection was of standing next each other in a row of children like themselves, singing, or some such nonsense—it must have been kindergarten.
<name>Millicent</name>	Millicent	Miriam	[MASK] upset this theory as in time she upset most of his theories. His intention to play the r61e of a man of the world educating an innocent but interestingly teachable bride was nipped in the bud. She was not at all teachable and she took no trouble to make herself interesting.
<name>Blackthorn</name>	Blackthorn	Graylie	Ah, I have seen this fellow before, I know this man if I could place him. He is no stranger to me. She pulled [MASK] up, rose in her stirrups and shouted, I’m not going with you this time—ride on!
<name>Yankel</name>	Yankel	Kennerly	The boy wanted to know what this meant. “The law! the law!” groaned [MASK]. “They can collect money from us for the loss of their daughter. It can be blamed on us.” The boy was fairly baffled by this.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Dennis	She couldn’t help feeling happy all at once at the sight of the lamp and the fire making everything cozy, and the smell of vanilla reminded her of perfume. She set the table with a white-fringed cloth while [MASK] strained the milk.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Miranda	His pride in his youth, his forbearance and tolerance and contempt for that unlucky being breathed out of his very pores as he strolled, straight and relaxed in his strength. “What could you expect of him, [MASK]?” She spoke his name often, and he spoke hers rarely.
<name>Phyllis</name>	Phyllis	Hans	[MASK], the youthful oracle, was ready. “Why, because he always attacks when you are not looking, or when you have put down your arms for an instant. So you are punished for carelessness really, for not troubling to learn the intentions of your enemy.
<name>Trilby</name>	Trilby	Ramon	“That shall be mentioned in its place, never fear, my good friend,” cried [MASK], his voice crumbling with generous emotion. “with the name of your cafe, even. It shall be a shrine for artists when this story is known.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Kennerly	The two small creatures imitated each in his own kind perfectly the gestures of their elders. The baby whacked and shouted, the donkey trudged and flapped his ears at each blow. “My God!” said [MASK] over coffee an hour later.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Carlos	I want to stay here. I want to run away—to kill myself!” “Nonsense!” said [MASK]. “Come with me this minute. What did you expect when you came out here alone with me?” He turned and started away.
<name>Eveline</name>	Eveline	Maria	It was no good trying to talk to her.” Her brothers remembered her tenderly as a sensible girl. After listening to their comments on her character and ways, [MASK] decided that they considered her sensible because she asked their advice about her appearance when she was going out to dance.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Stephen	She spun the car around and dashed forward so sharply [MASK] was almost flung out of the seat. He sat braced then with all his might, hands digging into the cushions. The car speeded up and the trees and houses whizzed by all flattened out.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Cornelia	She seemed to be talking but there was no sound. “Well, are you tongue-tied? Whose birthday is it? Are you going to give a party?” [MASK]’s mouth moved urgently in strange shapes. “Don’t do that, you bother me, daughter.”
<name>him</name>	him	Charles	“So,” she said, smiling and tilting her head at him with what struck [MASK] as a slightly too intimate, possessive gleam. Still smiling, she hurried away to the farther end of the hall and rapped sharply at a closed door.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Violeta	[MASK] opened her eyes wide also and peered up at him. She expected to sink into a look warm and gentle, like the touch of his palm. Instead, she felt suddenly, sharply hurt, as if she had collided with a chair in the dark.
<name>Shevek</name>	Shevek	Miranda	Oblivion, thought [MASK], her mind feeling among her memories of words she had been taught to describe the unseen, the unknowable, is a whirlpool of gray water turning upon itself for all eternity . . . eternity is perhaps more than the distance to the farthest star.
<name>Willy</name>	Willy	Dennis	[MASK] thought maybe it was telling people what to eat and then watching them eat it all those years that had taken away his wish for food. “You know I can’t eat cake,” he said. “It upsets my stomach.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Miranda	[MASK] listened for a moment to the rattle of typewriters above, the steady nimble of presses below. “I wish we were going to spend the whole afternoon on a park bench,” she said, “or drive to the mountains.”
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Mamacita	So be careful.” But [MASK] never stayed annoyed for long, and afterward it was beautiful to curl up near her, snuggling into her shoulder, and smell the nice, crinkled, perfumed hair at the nape of her neck.
