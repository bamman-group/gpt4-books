<name>Joseph</name>	Joseph	Manman	“Don’t do anything rash.” “Everywhere I go, I hear it. I hear him saying things to me. You tenten, malpwop. He calls me a filthy whore. I never want to see this child’s face. Your child looks like [MASK].
<name>Ysabeau</name>	Ysabeau	Blood	Did you have a chance to reclaim your mother line?” “My mother line was always with me,” I said. “No matter what happens. [MASK] made us one.” “You’re telling me you never hated your mother.”
<name>David</name>	David	Marc	It was about lovers, a young girl and her painting instructor. At midnight, I called my mother. She sounded anxious when she answered. “What are you doing?” I asked. “[MASK] is here with me,” she said.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Dada	“[MASK] is such a random sound.” “You’re green with envy and you know it.” I went to the kitchen to make myself some tea. “How was the meeting?” he asked. “Good.” “Your mother called.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Atie	She flashed the new deed for the house. “La terre sera egalement divisee, ” she read from the document. “Equally, my dear. The land is equally divided between [MASK] and me and you and your daughter.”
<name>Esteban</name>	Esteban	Marc	[MASK] decided to stay out of the discussion. The woman continued attacking him, shouting that she was tired of cowardly men speaking against women who were proving themselves, women as brave as stars out at dawn. My mother smiled at the woman’s words.
<name>Didi</name>	Didi	Joseph	She didn’t want to give up a gem like you.” My mother had left two messages on our machine by the time we got home. “We had a nice day, pa vreV she said when I called back. “Did [MASK] enjoy himself?
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Manman	“We used to fight so hard when we saw a star wink. You said it was winking at you. I thought it was winking at me. I think, [MASK], she told us that unpleasant story about the stars to stop the quarrels.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Joseph	There was a large dance floor with pink and yellow lights twinkling from the ceiling. That night [MASK] played the tenor saxophone. There was a whimpering sound to it, like a mourning cry. After the show, we drove over the bridge, into dawn.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Joseph	“Is there money in it?” asked my mother. “I do okay,” [MASK] said. “I play with friends when they need someone, but trust me, I have a little nest egg saved up.” My mother winked for only my eyes to see.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Brigitte	She stretched her body out on the floor and within a few seconds, fell asleep. She woke up at noon with a panic-stricken look in her eyes. “My notebook?” she asked. “You seen it?” I shook my head no. [MASK] was asleep on the bed.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Louise	She walked with her hands supporting her back, as if it hurt her. A panama hat tightly covered her head. On her shoulder was a palmetto sewing basket, flapping against her wide buttocks. “She must have been on the way,” [MASK] said.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Marc	The priest was the last missing pebble in the stream. Then we could take my mother to the hills. [MASK] got up and walked around, impatiently waiting for them to wheel out her coffin. The velvet curtains parted and a tall mulatto man theatrically pushed the coffin forward.
<name>Arturo</name>	Arturo	Marc	“Does she sleep?” I asked. “Less now,” he said. My mother was the heavy luggage that went under the plane. I did not sit next to [MASK] on the plane. There were enough seats so that I did not have to.
<name>Yoshi</name>	Yoshi	Eliab	“I knew, but she never spoke of you.” We decided to have the funeral the next morning, just among ourselves. That night we made a large pot of tea, which we shared with only [MASK] and the other wandering boys.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Brigitte	I shouted back. [MASK] shrieked, trying to scream along. “Is there something you want to say to your mother?” “No!” The recorder clicked to a stop. “Any more you want to say?” asked my grandmother.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Sophie	She looked very young and thin, but for the most part healthy. Because of the roomy size of her jumper, I couldn’t tell whether or not she was wearing her prosthetic bra. “[MASK], walk to your mother,” said my grandmother.
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Rena	The crew team was rowing towards the edge of the river. “During your visit, did you go to the spot where your mother was raped?” [MASK] asked. “In the thick of the cane field. Did you go to the spot?”
<name>Amir</name>	Amir	Eliab	Another kite swooped down like a vulture. There were pieces of glass and broken razors on the other kite’s tail. One of the razors slashed his thread and sent [MASK]’s kite drifting aimlessly into the breeze. The kite drifted further and further out of sight.
<name>John</name>	John	Brigitte	Something I owed to him, now that he was the only person in the world watching over me. That first very painful time gave us the child. When [MASK] and I woke up, I took her to the old rocker on the porch.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sophie	“Age and wedlock tames the beast,” said my grandmother. “Am I looking at [MASK]?” I moved closer, pressing her fingers against my cheeks. “Did you even have breasts the last time I saw you?” asked my grandmother.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Marc	“How’s yours?” “Don’t call it that,” she said. “I haven’t decided if I will follow through. It’s fighting me though. More and more of a fighter every day.” “Is [MASK] there?”
<name>I</name>	I	Eliab	■ , Three days later, my mother came. When I first caught a glimpse of her, she was sitting on the back of a cart being pulled by two teenage boys. [MASK] raced to the yard, grabbed my grandmother’s hand, and yanked her towards the road.
<name>My mother</name>	My mother	Eliab	She did not look the least bit surprised. A plantain green scarf floated in the breeze behind my mother. She skipped through the dust and rushed across the yard. [MASK] circled around her like a wingless butterfly. My mother walked over and kissed my grandmother.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Brigitte	When [MASK] and I came home, there was a large dinner waiting for us. Fried chicken, glazed potatoes, and broiled vegetables. Everything came frozen out of a box, but still managed to retain some flavor.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Brigitte	The old woman nearly tripped over the kite as it crashed to the ground. [MASK] stirred in my arms. She opened her eyes, fluttered her long eyelashes, and then closed them again. A mild breeze rustled the guava trees that now lined the unpaved road.
<name>She</name>	She	Brigitte	She waved good-bye to us as the van pulled away. “Find peace,” she said, chewing the end of an unlit pipe. “Find peace, you too,” answered my mother. [MASK] grabbed my blouse when she woke up.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Bienvenue	She looked a bit disoriented when he raised her out of the seat. “And the child’s mother, does she get a hug?” He pressed his lips down on mine. “[MASK],” he said. “Welcome back.”
<name>Yes</name>	Yes	Wi	For all I know, they might not even have them here.” She ran the card along her cheek, then pressed it against her chest. “Are there still lots of daffodils?” “[MASK],” I said. “There are a lot of them.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Davina	We went to [MASK]’s backyard and watched as she released it in the dark. It was hard to see where the balloon went, but at least it had floated out of our hands. I felt broken at the end of the meeting, but a little closer to being free.
<name>you</name>	you	Sophie	“I am not staying long enough for that,” my mother said. “When I got your telegram, I decided to come and see [MASK] and take care of your affairs at the same time. I plan to stay for only three days.
<name>Rose</name>	Rose	Sophie	Manman, you are still a young woman. “Speaking of young people, I don’t want to trouble your spirits, but I received a telephone call from [MASK]’s husband not too long ago, telling me that he was on some sort of musical tour.
<name>Hollywood</name>	Hollywood	Ginen	“She is going to [MASK],” I said, “or she is going to be a star. She’s going to be a butterfly or a lark in a tree. She’s going to be free.” He looked at me as though he thought me as insane as my mother.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Brigitte	I reached over and tapped [MASK]’s nose. “I need to know. Did you leave on impulse or had you been planning to go for a long time?” he asked. “We weren’t connecting physically.” “Did you find an aphrodisiac?”
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Marc	I’ll deal with this. [MASK] will come and stay here with me.” “Why don’t you just marry him?” “Because you don’t marry someone to escape something that’s inside your head.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Brigitte	“It’s very important, otherwise I wouldn’t lose this time with my daughter and granddaughter.” “We’ll be fine.” I gave [MASK] a bath in the tub while my mother cooked spaghetti for dinner. The cooking smells of the house had changed.
<name>Erzulie</name>	Erzulie	Jezebel	I knew it. She would look like a [MASK], hot-blooded Erzulie who feared no men, but rather made them her slaves, raped them, and killed them. She was the only woman with that power. It was too bright a red for burial.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Brigitte	The woman with the load would answer yes, if she had unloaded her freight without hurting herself. I sat in the shade of a crimson flamboyant tree, at the turn of the forked road. [MASK] quickly tightened her lips around the bottle of milk that I gave her.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Sophie	“Your prayers were answered.” I went to the living room and crashed on the sofa. It suddenly occurred to me that I was surrounded by my own life, my own four walls, my own husband and child. Here I was [MASK]—maitresse de la maison.
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Marc	I was shouting at [MASK]. “I woke up in the middle of the night. Sometimes, I wake up and she’s not there, so I was not worried. Two hours passed and I woke up again, I went to the bathroom and she was lying there.”
<name>Lily</name>	Lily	Sophie	Her voice was muffled, her breathing quickened, as she sobbed loudly. “It is the calm and silent waters that drown you. I never thought it would make me so sad to look in [MASK]’s face.”
<name>Armando</name>	Armando	Marc	[MASK] kept looking at her, as if waiting for my mother to argue on his behalf, but my mother picked up the menu, and ran her fingers down the list of dishes. My mother introduced me to the waiter when he came by to take her order.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Marc	I ate like I had been on a hunger strike, filling myself with the coconut milk they served us in real green coconuts. When they looked up from their plates, my mother and [MASK] eyed each other like there were things they couldn’t say because of my presence.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Sophie	As we waited on line, an old fan circled a spider’s web above our heads. A chubby lady greeted my mother politely when we got to the window. “This is [MASK],” my mother said through the holes in the thick glass.
<name>One</name>	One	Marc	I tried to stuff myself and keep quiet, pretending that I couldn’t even see them. My mother now had two lives: [MASK] belonged to her present life, I was a living memory from the past. “What do you want to be when you grow up?”
<name>Yejide</name>	Yejide	Atie	“For sure, I know [MASK]. We are like milk and coffee, lips and tongue. We are two fingers on the same hand. Two eyes on the same head.” “Do you know where she is? She was supposed to meet me here.
<name>He</name>	He	Marc	We never got a moment alone for her to tell me what she had decided. That night as we said good-bye, she wrapped her arms around my body and would not let go. “She will come back,” [MASK] said, separating us.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Manman	[MASK] thinks it puts a curse on the family. Besides, your husband came to me and I could not refuse him.” “You’ve seen him?” “Oh, the flames in your eyes.” “How is he?”
<name>Olga</name>	Olga	Brigitte	She has promised for a long time to come and arrange the old woman’s funeral and the old woman will place on the cassette words begging her to come, so you can settle this quarrel.” [MASK] got up early the next morning, ready to bounce and play.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Marc	I twirled the ring around my fingers while listening to the saxophone wailing in the dark. My mother rarely spoke to me since she began the tests. When she went out with [MASK], I refused to go and she showed no desire to take me along.
<name>Emmanuelle</name>	Emmanuelle	Brigitte	I nearly dropped to my knees with gratitude when she told me that [MASK] was okay. “We’ll follow the regular schedule for checkups,” she said, filling out her chart. “Only a mountain can crush a Haitian woman,” I said.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Brigitte	she asked. “Almost six months.” She made funny faces at [MASK]. “I got all the pictures you sent me,” she said. “Why didn’t you answer?” “I couldn’t find the words,” she said.
<name>Atie</name>	Atie	Atie	He reached in and folded her hands over it. My grandmother dropped in a few threadless needles and Tante [MASK], one copper penny. My grandmother did not look directly at my mother’s face, but at the red gloves on her hands and the matching shoes on her feet.
<name>Estelle</name>	Estelle	Eliab	She chopped another coconut and brought it over to me. The coconut milk spilled all over my chest as I raised the shell to my lips. My daughter reached up to grab the coconut. My grandmother and [MASK] sat on an old tree stump, sharing the soft mush inside the coconut.
<name>Georges</name>	Georges	Marc	[MASK] asked me. He spoke to me in a tone of voice that was used with very young children or very old animals. “I want to do dactylo,” I said, “be a secretary.” He didn’t seem impressed.
<name>I</name>	I	Brigitte	“This is one of my smaller ones, a recent born.” “Mesi mil fwa, ” I said. How very nice. “It’s a gift, not for money,” she said. [MASK] reached up to grab the pig’s brown eyes.
<name>Phillis</name>	Phillis	Louise	“I was very happy to hear it.” “I always felt, I did, that I knew words in my head. I did not know them on paper. Now once every so often, I put some nice words down. [MASK], she calls them poems.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Joseph	In the bathing room was a metal basin filled with leaves and rainwater. Even though so much time had passed since I’d given birth, I still felt extremely fat. I peeled off [MASK]’s shirt and scrubbed my flesh with the leaves in the water.
<name>Isabelle</name>	Isabelle	Brigitte	Otherwise, my daughter, [MASK], and I would have never made it this far. “A wonderful trip, pa vreV’ asked the driver, as he unloaded my suitcase. “At least we arrived,” I said.
<name>Chinaza</name>	Chinaza	Martine	I have already asked someone to come and drive us to the ayopwo.” She took a sip from the milk in her glass and forced a large smile. “You should not be afraid,” she said. “[MASK] was a wonderful sister.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Marc	I’ll kill myself. [MASK], he saves my life every night, but I am afraid he gave me this baby that’s going to take that life away.” “You can’t say that.” “The nightmares.
<name>She</name>	She	Louise	My grandmother looked up without acknowledging their presence. [MASK] walked into the yard, charged towards the tree, untied her pig, picked it up, and walked away. “Why? What are you doing?” I called after her. She did not turn back.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Brigitte	Fried chicken, glazed potatoes, and broiled vegetables. Everything came frozen out of a box, but still managed to retain some flavor. We decided to start giving [MASK] a few more adventurous solids. I pureed some sweet potatoes and boiled some carrots and fed her small spoonfuls.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Joseph	“You should tell someone.” “You cannot report a ghost to the police.” [MASK]’s hands were creeping up my arm and going through the top of my nightgown. “I tried to get rid of it,” she said. “Today.
<name>Yvette</name>	Yvette	Brigitte	Instead, she had large quilts with bird and fish patterns, over the louvers on her wall. I took [MASK] back to my room for a sponge bath. She giggled as I sprinkled scented talc between her legs. Her body was a bit warmer than usual.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Sophie	She did not even look inside. “Not this year,” she said. “Why not this year?” “[MASK], it is not mine. It is your mother’s. We must send it to your mother.”
<name>the baby</name>	the baby	Brigitte	“A secretary.” “You make money?” “I haven’t worked since I had the baby.” “Had enough for this journey, non}” “I didn’t plan on this journey.” I laid [MASK] on my lap.
<name>Mya</name>	Mya	Brigitte	It had been almost two years since the last time we saw each other. My mother’s skin was unusually light, a pale mocha, three or four shades lighter than any of ours. [MASK]’s body tightened, as though she could sense the tension in mine.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Marc	“Are you still seeing [MASK]?” I asked. “I want him to have dinner with you and your husband soon.” “So you’re still seeing him.” “Very much seeing him.” “Are you going to marry him?”
<name>Joseph</name>	Joseph	Marc	The ones who were supposedly drooling over me afterwards, even though they called me a nasty West Indian to my face. “You keep away from them especially. They are upset because they cannot have you.” Aside from [MASK], we knew no other men.
<name>Sophie</name>	Sophie	Non	“[MASK]. She is rather in the morgue.” I admired the elegance in the way he said it. Now he would have to say it to my grandmother, who had lost her daughter, and to my Tante Atie, who had lost her only sister.
<name>she</name>	she	Marc	“What are you going to do?” I asked. “That’s what I don’t know.” “What does [MASK] want?” “It’s my decision. Supremely, it’s mine. I am very scared. I don’t know.
<name>Rosa</name>	Rosa	Jacqueline	“I’m doing what I can.” [MASK] was wearing large sponge rollers under a hair net on her head. My mother brought some face cream that promised to make her skin lighter. All along the avenue were people who seemed displaced among the speeding cars and very tall buildings.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Joseph	My mother took [MASK] on a tour of the house, the tour he had never gotten. He followed her obediently, beaming. She moved us into the backyard where she had placed her picnic table near her hibiscus patch.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Rena	“Pray to the Virgin Mother for me.” I had a late afternoon session on the bare floor of [MASK]’s office. Through her smoked French doors, the river looked a breathless blue. “How was the visit with your mother?” she asked.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Marc	“If he could get her out of her grave to make him dinner, he would do it.” “My mother was the best,” [MASK] said as he opened the car door for us. There was a tiny lace curtain on the inside of the door.
<name>Julienne</name>	Julienne	Atie	A long string of cars sped along the highway, each like a single diamond on a very long bracelet. “We w’ill be in the city soon,” she said. I still had not said anything to her. “How is your Tante [MASK]?”
<name>Amara</name>	Amara	Davina	The air in our room smelled like candles and incense. We sat on green heart-shaped pillows that [MASK] had made. The color green stood for life and growth. We bowed our heads and recited a serenity prayer.
<name>Ramesh</name>	Ramesh	Marc	“[MASK] is one of those men who will never recover from not eating his manmati's cooking,” said my mother. “If he could get her out of her grave to make him dinner, he would do it.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Brigitte	We ate at the kitchen table, watching through the low windows as a little girl skipped rope under a hanging light in a neighbor’s yard. [MASK] tried to dig her pacifier into my plate. I cut off a strand of spaghetti and put it in her mouth.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Brigitte	My grandmother took her beans to the yard to pick out the pebbles. She fanned a small fire with her hat, washed the beans, then put them to boil in a pot. [MASK] yawned in her sleep as I picked her up.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Brigitte	“I am not having the short breath anymore, but every so often, I do find myself dreaming the bad dreams. I thought it would end, but lately it seems to be beginning all over again.” [MASK] was still awake, even after my grandmother fell asleep.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Manman	“It must have been much harder then but you kept me.” “When I was pregnant with you, [MASK] made me drink all kinds of herbs, vervain, quinine, and verbena, baby poisons. I tried beating my stomach with wooden spoons.
<name>Rosa</name>	Rosa	Brigitte	She had not come home at all the night before. My grandmother made herself some bitter black coffee with a lump of salt to prepare her body for the shock of bad news. I sat out on the porch with [MASK] waiting for the food vendors to come by.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Sophie	She sensed something. “[MASK], walk to your mother.” My grandmother’s voice grew more forceful. My mother looked uncomfortable, almost scared. I did not move. We stared at each other across the yard, each waiting for the other to yield.
<name>She</name>	She	Brigitte	While I changed her diaper, my mother held my back and her head as though she was afraid that we would both crash if she let go. [MASK] slept peacefully through the rest of the trip. “She’s a good child,” my mother said.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Marc	They would probably put me away thinking that I might hurt both myself and this child.” “When you and [MASK] are together, do you have the nightmares then?” “I pretend; it is like eating grapefruit. I was tired of being alone.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Louise	[MASK] placed her hands over its snout and tried to drown out its bawl. “The husband thought she might have come to spend the time with me. I am already having panic attacks about this. Could be she came to her senses, but not to return to me.
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Brigitte	“Tonight, only one story.” The night grew silent under her commanding tone. I lay on the bed with [MASK], the open window allowing us a clear view of the sky. The stars fell as though the glue that held them together had come loose.
<name>Enrique</name>	Enrique	Eliab	[MASK] ran to her and took a heavy bundle from her hand. He pulled out its contents, sniffing the coconuts before setting them down. “Did you have a nice visit to the cemetery?” I asked. “There are two ways to go to the cemetery.
<name>David</name>	David	Marc	“I went to see [MASK].” Her voice cracked. “I had something to tell him.” “Was it good? Was it bad?” “Depends on how you look at it. Did you call your husband?” “Yes.”
<name>me</name>	me	Mommy	Tracing my fingers across my daughter’s spine, I asked her questions that she could not possibly answer, questions that even I didn’t know the answers to. “Are you going to remember all of this? Will you be mad at [MASK] for severing you from your daddy?
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Marc	She didn’t feel as cold as I expected. She looked as though she was dressed for a fancy affair and we were all keeping her from going on her way. [MASK] was weeping into his handkerchief. He reached into his vest pocket and pulled out a small Bible.
<name>Zephyr</name>	Zephyr	Erzulie	“What form of life do you want to take?” asked [MASK]. “Do you want to be a green lush plant in a garden? Do you want to be a gentle animal in the sea? A ferocious beast of the night?”
<name>Lucette</name>	Lucette	Brigitte	We were speaking to one another in English without realizing it. “Oh that ding-clang talk,” interrupted my grandmother. “It sounds like glass breaking.” [MASK] was pulling at my mother’s earrings. My mother took them off and handed them to me.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Sophie	I leaned back in the bed, listening to her snoring. Soon, the morning light came creeping through the living room window. I kept staring at the ceiling as I listened to her heart beating along with the ticking clock. “[MASK],” she whispered.
<name>Artemis</name>	Artemis	Marc	“I really was asking more about your opinion of music,” [MASK] insisted. “We hear you,” said my mother. “He has much of the old ways,” she whispered again in my ear.
<name>goodbye</name>	goodbye	Dada	She was still saying [MASK], even though I knew he had tried to coach her. “One day we’ll all take a trip together,” he said. “This trip I must make alone.” “We are waiting for you,” he said.
<name>Why</name>	Why	Krik	“I call it humiliation,” I said. “I hate my body. I am ashamed to show it to anybody, including my husband. Sometimes I feel like I should be off somewhere by myself. That is why I am here. ” “[MASK]?”
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Brigitte	“I don’t need an aphrodisiac. I need a little more understanding.” “I do understand. You are usually reluctant to start, but after a while you give in. You seem to enjoy it.” I called [MASK]’s pediatrician to make an appointment.
