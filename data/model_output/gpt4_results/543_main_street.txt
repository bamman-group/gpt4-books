<name>Myra</name>	Myra	Carol	[MASK] smiled confidently at him, and peered down the empty road toward town. Only heat-waves and dust and dusty weeds. At half-past three no one had come, and the grocery boy reluctantly got out, cranked his Ford, glared at them in a disillusioned manner, and rattled away.
<name>Myra</name>	Myra	Carrie	Her husband called, “Suppose we could have some eats, [MASK]?” As she passed through the dining-room the men smiled on her, belly-smiles. None of them noticed her while she was serving the crackers and cheese and sardines and beer.
<name>Hardin</name>	Hardin	Carol	Then people can’t say you’re attacking them to excuse your own infractions.” To [MASK] was given a sudden great philosophical understanding, an explanation of half the cautious reforms in history. “Yes. I’ve heard that plea. It’s a good one.
<name>Carol</name>	Carol	Carol	So will you help us with the discussion today?” On her way over [MASK] had decided to use the Thanatopsis as the tool with which to liberalize the town. She had immediately conceived enormous enthusiasm; she had chanted, “These are the real people.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Juanita	“I used to be rather good at bezique.” She knew that bezique was a game of cards--or a game of something else. Roulette, possibly. But her lie was a triumph. [MASK]’s handsome, high-colored, horsey face showed doubt.
<name>Francie</name>	Francie	Carol	The hallway was dismayingly scrubbed; the kitchen was an exercise in mathematics, with problems worked out in equidistant chairs. The parlor was kept for visitors. [MASK] suggested, “Let’s sit in the kitchen. Please don’t trouble to light the parlor stove.”
<name>Helen</name>	Helen	Carol	[MASK] planned for them a simple set with warm color. She could see the beginning of the play: all dark save the high settles and the solid wooden table between them, which were to be illuminated by a ray from offstage.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Carol	In a swirl of flakes which scratched at their eyes like a maniac darkness, he unbuckled the harness. He turned and plodded back, a ponderous furry figure, holding the horses’ bridles, [MASK]’s hand dragging at his sleeve.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Carol	The wrinkled water was like armor damascened and polished. The breeze flowed round the boat in a chill current. [MASK] drew the collar of her middy blouse over her bare throat. “Getting cold. Afraid we’ll have to go back,” she said.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Fern	If I cut loose and danced the way I like to, they’d think I was a perfect hellion--poor harmless me! Oh, I oughtn’t to be talking like this. [MASK], you never could be cagey!”
<name>Carol</name>	Carol	Kennicott	She was embarrassed rather than resentful. She deliberately misunderstood. She talked of [MASK]’s overshoes and medical ideals till they were thoroughly bored. They regarded her as agreeable but green. Till the end she labored to satisfy the inquisition.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Guy	A castle with baths. “This hat is so tight. I must stretch it. [MASK] liked it. “There’s the house. I’m awfully chilly. Time to get out the fur coat. I wonder if I’ll ever have a beaver coat?
<name>Millionaires</name>	Millionaires	Europeans	People who make more than ten thousand a year or less than eight hundred are wicked. [MASK] are still wickeder. It doesn’t hurt any to drink a glass of beer on a warm day, but anybody who touches wine is headed straight for hell.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Carol	“I don’t suppose it will take more than thirty or forty years for the churches to get together?” [MASK] said innocently. “Hardly that long even; things are moving so rapidly. So it would be a mistake to make any other plans.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sam	I CAN’T call him ‘[MASK]’! They’re all so friendly.” She glanced at the houses; tried not to see what she saw; gave way in: “Why do these stories lie so? They always make the bride’s home-coming a bower of roses.
<name>Georgiana</name>	Georgiana	Whittier	I find that onions don’t agree with me, it’s very strange, ever since I had an attack of biliousness one time, I have found that onions, either fried onions or raw ones, and [MASK] does love raw onions with vinegar and sugar on them----” It was pure affection.
<name>Kennicott</name>	Kennicott	Kennicott	She was unable to rhapsodize much over the seven new bungalows and the two garages which [MASK] had made to seem so important. Her intensest thought about them was, “Oh yes, they’re all right I suppose.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Carol	Always he told [MASK] what a charming person she was; always he looked at her knowingly. “Yes. He probably would make a woman fall in love with him. But it wouldn’t last a week. I’d get tired of his confounded buoyancy.
<name>Myrtle</name>	Myrtle	Carrie	Hello, [MASK]. That dress you got on looks kind of low in the neck to me. May be decent and modest--I suppose I’m old-fashioned--but I never thought much of showing the whole town a woman’s bust!
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Maud	Though there’s no need of hurting her feelings. I may just drop in for a second, to tell her I can’t stay. All my fault anyway; ought never to have started in and jollied [MASK] along in the old days.
<name>John</name>	John	Valborg	You always pretend to be so sophisticated and all, but you’re a baby. Just because you are so innocent, you don’t know what evil thoughts may lurk in that fellow’s brain.” “You don’t suppose [MASK] could actually think about making love to me?”
<name>Carol</name>	Carol	Carol	The house was so unsheltered, so battered by the wind, so bleakly thrust out into the harsh clearing, that [MASK] shivered. But they were welcomed warmly enough in the kitchen, with its crisp new plaster, its black and nickel range, its cream separator in a corner.
<name>Doctor</name>	Doctor	Will	Where’s the subscription-list? What cause do I get robbed for, this trip?” “I haven’t any subscription-list, [MASK]. I want to see you professionally.” “And you a Christian Scientist? Have you given that up?
<name>Alfred</name>	Alfred	Erik	‘s become so married and proprietary.” “Well, next time you’ll have better sense.” He patted her head, flumped down behind his newspaper, said nothing more. Enemies leered through the windows, stole on her from the hall. She had no one save [MASK].
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Carol	V The chart which plots [MASK]’s progress is not easy to read. The lines are broken and uncertain of direction; often instead of rising they sink in wavering scrawls; and the colors are watery blue and pink and the dim gray of rubbed pencil marks.
<name>Her</name>	Her	Spitting	She tried to align him with the hairy-chested heroes of the motion-pictures. She curled on the couch a pallid softness in the twilight, and fought herself, and lost the battle. [MASK] did not identify him with rangers riding the buttes; it merely bound him to
<name>Theron</name>	Theron	Cynical	[MASK]. Oh, I do hope I’m not a sentimentalist. But I can’t see any use in this high-art stuff that doesn’t encourage us day-laborers to plod on.” Ensued a fifteen-minute argument about the oldest topic in the world:
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Kennicott	When she was driving with [MASK], in early evening, she saw him on the lake shore, reading a thin book which might easily have been poetry. She noted that he was the only person in the motorized town who still took long walks.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Bjornstam	She was disquieted, but [MASK] did not give her the opportunity to be delicate. He flung out his hand in a welcoming gesture which assumed that she was her own counselor, that she was not a Respectable Married Woman but fully a human being.
<name>Chum</name>	Chum	Carrie	“Tell you, [MASK]: There’s just three classes of people: folks that haven’t got any ideas at all; and cranks that kick about everything; and Regular Guys, the fellows with sticktuitiveness, that boost and get the world’s work done.”
<name>Vida</name>	Vida	Bea	The expanding forces of life within her choked the desire for reforming. She trotted through the house, planning the spring cleaning with [MASK]. When she attended her second meeting of the Thanatopsis she said nothing about remaking the town.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Carol	Telling fortunes or making love? Let me warn you that the doc is a frisky bacheldore, [MASK]. Come on now, folks, shake a leg. Let’s have some stunts or a dance or something.”
<name>Myra</name>	Myra	Vida	When he was not affectionately coercing people into buying things they did not need, he stood at the back of the store, glowing, abstracted, feeling masculine as he recalled the tempestuous surprises of love revealed by [MASK].
<name>McTeague</name>	McTeague	Carol	[MASK] was, without understanding or accepting it, a revolutionist, a radical, and therefore possessed of “constructive ideas,” which only the destroyer can have, since the reformer believes that all the essential constructing has already been done.
<name>Orville</name>	Orville	Sam	Now he bayed: “That’ll be about all from you! I’ve stood for your sneering at this town, and saying how ugly and dull it is. I’ve stood for your refusing to appreciate good fellows like [MASK]. I’ve even stood for your ridiculing
<name>Wendy</name>	Wendy	Carol	Thus [MASK] hit upon the tragedy of old age, which is not that it is less vigorous than youth, but that it is not needed by youth; that its love and prosy sageness, so important a few years ago, so gladly offered now, are rejected with laughter.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Kennicott	She wailed, “I haven’t a single solitary thing that’s fit to be seen in,” and enjoyed herself very much indeed. [MASK] went about casually letting people know that he was “going to run down to the Cities and see some shows.”
<name>Minta</name>	Minta	Carol	It was only from duty that [MASK] dragged him and herself out of the warm hotel, into a stinking trolley, up the brownstone steps of the converted residence which lugubriously housed the dramatic school. V They were in a long whitewashed hall with a clumsy draw-curtain across the front.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Vida	[MASK] speculated, “Do you know that I may not be here next year?” “What do you mean?” With her fragile narrow nails she smoothed the glass slab which formed the top of the round table at which they sat.
<name>He</name>	He	Westlake	He tried to get witnesses; [MASK] spread lies; his friends doubted him; his self-confidence was so broken that it was horrible to see the indecision of the decisive man; he was convicted, handcuffed, taken on a train---- She ran to his room.
<name>Adolph</name>	Adolph	Sam’l	Going to stop and pass the time of day mit [MASK]? Warmer, eh? What’d the doc’s thermometer say it was? Say, you folks better come round and visit with us, one of these evenings. Don’t be so dog-gone proud, staying by yourselves.”
<name>Gloria</name>	Gloria	Guy	[MASK]’s thin maturity was changing in her vision to flushed youth and they were roaming an island in the yellow sea of chatter when she realized that the guests were beginning that cough which indicated, in the universal instinctive language, that they desired to go home and go to bed.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Carol	[MASK] wailed, “Fix the furnace so you won’t have to touch it after supper. And for heaven’s sake take that horrible old door-mat off the porch. And put on your nice brown and white shirt. Why did you come home so late?
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Will	“[MASK], this is--I must get this straight. Some one said to me the other day that in towns like this, even more than in cities, all the doctors hate each other, because of the money----” “Who said that?”
<name>Whom</name>	Whom	Kennicott----What	He shouted to a farmer, as he slowed up to pass the frightened team, “There we are--schon gut!” She sat back, neglected, frozen, unheroic heroine in a drama insanely undramatic. She made a decision resolute and enduring. She would tell [MASK] would she tell him?
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Dave	“I don’t understand.” “Why, [MASK], the darn fool, sent me ether, instead of chloroform like I told him, and you know ether fumes are mighty inflammable, especially with that lamp right by the table.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Carol	They welcomed [MASK], asked about her husband, gave her advice regarding colic in babies, passed her the gingerbread and scalloped potatoes at church suppers, and in general made her very unhappy and lonely, so that she wondered if she might not enlist in the militant suffrage organization and be allowed to go to jail.
<name>Ducks</name>	Ducks	Mark	The brown dusk was still. Behind them were dark marshes. The plowed acres smelled fresh. The lake was garnet and silver. The voices of the men, waiting for the last flight, were clear in the cool air. “[MASK] left!”
<name>Wemmick</name>	Wemmick	Sam	“Maybe I catch a whole lot more than you think I do!” “Yes, perhaps you do.” “And d’ you know why [MASK] doesn’t light his cigar when he’s here?” “Why?” “He’s so
<name>Life</name>	Life	Nature	If you do lose, you feel foolish; and if you win, as soon as you find out how little it is that you’ve been scheming for, why then you lose worse than ever. [MASK] stinging us, as usual.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Kennicott	He was heavy, and smelled of sweat and the stable. But she put her arm about his waist, her sleek head by his chest; she tugged at him; she clicked her tongue in imitation of [MASK]’s cheerful noises.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Kennicott	A letter? It might be found. Go to see him? Impossible. That evening [MASK] gave her, without comment, an envelope. The letter was signed “E. V.” I know I can’t do anything but make trouble for you, I think.
<name>Isabelle</name>	Isabelle	Carol	At various times during Senior year [MASK] finally decided upon studying law, writing motion-picture scenarios, professional nursing, and marrying an unidentified hero. Then she found a hobby in sociology. The sociology instructor was new. He was married, and therefore taboo,
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Carol	[MASK] was amiable. “Yes, so I hear. In fact, he called me up--told me he had been offered a lovely job in the city. So sorry he’s gone. He would have been valuable if we’d tried to start the dramatic association again.
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Oscarina	Damp black iron sink, damp whitey-yellow drain-board with shreds of discolored wood which from long scrubbing were as soft as cotton thread, warped table, alarm clock, stove bravely blackened by [MASK] but an abomination in its loose doors and broken drafts and oven that never would keep an even heat.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Bea	Come on! Food! Eatin’s!” She rushed to him, patted his fur coat, the long hairs smooth but chilly to her fingers. She joyously summoned [MASK], “All right! He’s here! We’ll sit right down!”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Kennicott	She was motoring with [MASK], the car lumping through darkness, the lights showing mud-puddles and ragged weeds by the road. A train coming! A rapid chuck-a-chuck, chuck-a-chuck, chuck-a-chuck.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Carrie	I admit all you say. Certainly. You’ve given me money both freely and amiably. Quite as if I were your mistress!” “[MASK]!” “I mean it! What was a magnificent spectacle of generosity to you was humiliation to me.
<name>George</name>	George	Blausser	Here you been complaining for years about us being so poky, and now when [MASK] comes along and does stir up excitement and beautify the town like you’ve always wanted somebody to, why, you say he’s a roughneck, and you won’t jump on the band-wagon.”
<name>Tinka</name>	Tinka	Bea	Gosh, I’d forgotten it!”) Once she filled a thermos bottle with hot coffee a corn-flakes box with cookies just baked by [MASK], and bustled to his office at three in the afternoon. She hid her bundles in the hall and peeped in.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Bjornstam	‘Well,’ he says, ‘I’ve been looking for a man so useful sweeping floors that I could pay him four dollars a day. Want the job, my friend?’ Ha, ha, ha! Say, you know how lippy [MASK] is?
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Kennicott	She was coaxed from her unhappy mood. But she came out of it unwillingly, and when [MASK] was satisfied that he had corrected all her worries and had opened a magazine of saffron detective stories, she sat upright.
<name>Stuart</name>	Stuart	Will	“Oh, maybe once or twice, when [MASK] has positively known of a case where Doctor--where one of the others has continued to call on patients longer than necessary, he has laughed about it, but----” He still grinned. “No, REALLY!
<name>McAlister</name>	McAlister	Yump	“[MASK], and he’s the undertaker. You’ll like him. Come shake hands with him.” “Oh no, no! He doesn’t--he doesn’t do the embalming and all that--himself? I couldn’t shake hands with an undertaker!”
<name>cranes</name>	cranes	Indians	She appreciated the homely ease of village life. She liked the old men, farmers, G.A.R. veterans, who when they gossiped sometimes squatted on their heels on the sidewalk, like resting [MASK], and reflectively spat over the curb. She found beauty in the children.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Carol	That wouldn’t be wrong of us, WOULD it!” “No, no, course it wouldn’t be wrong. But still, oughtn’t to----” He saw [MASK], slim black and ivory, cool, scornful of intrigue. “All right.
<name>Twilight</name>	Twilight	Cattle	The black road before the buggy turned to a faint lavender, then was blotted to uncertain grayness. [MASK] came in a long line up to the barred gates of the farmyards, and over the resting land was a dark glow.
<name>Snuffleupagus</name>	Snuffleupagus	Juanita	They think you’re showing off when you say ‘American’ instead of ‘Ammurrican.’ They think you’re too frivolous. Life’s so serious to them that they can’t imagine any kind of laughter except [MASK]’s snortling.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Maud	She was relieved, and apologetic to her friend [MASK]. “Of course. I was joking.” “I’ll tell you! Let’s land here and sit on the shore--that bunch of hazel-brush will shelter us from the wind--and watch the sunset.
<name>Rachel</name>	Rachel	Carol	[MASK] had warned herself not to be so “beastly supercilious.” She had insisted that in the belated quest of these work-stained women was an aspiration which ought to stir her tears. “But they’re so self-satisfied.
<name>Carol</name>	Carol	Carol	[MASK] stared at her, felt contemptuous, ready at last to rebel against the trap, and as the rusty goodwife fished again, “Plannin’ some more picnics?” she flung out, “I haven’t the slightest idea! Oh. Is that
<name>Lawrence</name>	Lawrence	Erik	[MASK] smiled at her proudly. She considered him--coatless, in white thin shirt. She was conscious of his male differentness, of his flat masculine sides, his thin thighs, his easy rowing. They talked of the library, of the movies.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Earl	Some shot! He could hit a tree ten feet off.” This was news to the girl from the Cities. “Say, how is she?” continued [MASK]. “Huh? How’s who?” “You know who I mean, smarty.”
<name>Henrietta</name>	Henrietta	Bresnahan	As she heard [MASK] announce, “We’re perfectly willing to talk to any committee the men may choose, but we’re not going to stand for some outside agitator butting in and telling us how we’re going to run our plant!”
<name>Carol</name>	Carol	Kennicott	She had come to the board-meeting singing with a plan. She had made a list of thirty European novels of the past ten years, with twenty important books on psychology, education, and economics which the library lacked. She had made [MASK] promise to give fifteen dollars.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Heh	How’d it strike you? [MASK]? Eagle soaring and soaring all day--big wide sky----” “Don’t! Or I will go with you, and I’m afraid there might be some slight scandal. Perhaps some day I’ll do it.
<name>George</name>	George	Carol	They can talk all they want to about the city, but my idea of a good time is to loaf around and see you boys and catch a gamey bass!” He hustled up the walk and blared at [MASK], “Where’s that little fellow?
<name>John</name>	John	Carol	The olives need not be stuffed. Doughnuts were in some houses well thought of as a substitute for the hot buttered rolls. But there was in all the town no heretic save [MASK] who omitted angel’s-food. They ate enormously.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Fern	“But the school-board won’t act on them?” “Guess we’ll more or less have to.” “But you’ll exonerate [MASK]?” “I’ll do what I can for the girl personally, but you know what the board is.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Juanita	“He’s nothing but a conceited buttinsky. [MASK] and I kind of figured he was trying to run this tennis thing too darn much anyway.” “But you asked him to make arrangements.” “I know, but I don’t like him.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Hugh	[MASK] lay on his stomach, making an earnest business of sleeping. He burrowed his eyes in the dwarf blue pillow to escape the electric light, then sat up abruptly, small and frail in his woolly nightdrawers, his floss of brown hair wild, the pillow clutched to his breast.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Carol	“Would you----” He did not finish it. He picked up a handful of pop-corn, let it run through his fingers, looked at her wistfully. With the loneliness of one who has put away a possible love [MASK] saw that he was a stranger.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Erik	Her fingers tightened about his thumb as she perceived the hot low room, the pounding of pressing-irons, the reek of scorched cloth, and [MASK] among giggling gnomes. His fingertip crept through the opening of her glove and smoothed her palm.
<name>John</name>	John	Erik	“I don’t believe----” “Just a glimpse!” “Well----” She doubtfully led the way to the hallroom-nursery. Their heads close, [MASK]’s curls pleasant as they touched her cheek, they looked in at the baby.
<name>Carol</name>	Carol	Kennicott	But she had delayed so long in finding that seed. Could she do something with this Thanatopsis Club? Or should she make her house so charming that it would be an influence? She’d make [MASK] like poetry. That was it, for a beginning!
<name>Hans</name>	Hans	Barney	From below, half-heard in her drowsiness, a colloquy in the pidgin-German of the farmers who have forgotten the Old Country language without learning the new: “Hello, [MASK], wass willst du?”
<name>Una</name>	Una	Hicks	[MASK] was in the back room. She faced the Greek god who, in a somewhat ungodlike way, was stitching a coat on a scaley sewing-machine, in a room of smutted plaster walls. She saw that his hands were not in keeping with a Hellenic face.
<name>Myra</name>	Myra	Carol	It was cool but [MASK] huddled on the porch, rocking, meditating, rocking. The house was lonely and repellent, and though she sighed, “I ought to go in and read--so many things to read--ought to go in,” she remained.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Fern	You can send the drayman for your trunk. My house has been contaminated long enough. Why the Lord should afflict me----” [MASK] was gone. The righteous widow glared, banged into the house, came out poking at her bonnet, marched away.
<name>Carol</name>	Carol	Kennicott	The lines of roofs and sidewalks sharp and inescapable. The second day of [MASK]’s absence. She fled from the creepy house for a walk. It was thirty below zero; too cold to exhilarate her. In the spaces between houses the wind caught her.
<name>Andy</name>	Andy	Cy	Snow softened her step. She heard voices in the loft above her: “Ah gee, lez--oh, lez go down the lake and swipe some mushrats out of somebody’s traps,” [MASK] was yawning. “And get our ears beat off!”
<name>Jonquil</name>	Jonquil	Hugh	I guess I never appreciated how lucky I was to have a girl with imagination and lively feet to play with. So----Could you maybe run away and see the South with me? If you wanted to, you could just--you could just pretend you were my sister and----I’ll get an extra nurse for [MASK]!
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Hugh	“Will you forgive mummy for going away? Will you?” she whispered. Absorbed in [MASK], asking a hundred questions about him--had he had any colds? did he still dawdle over his oatmeal? what about unfortunate morning incidents?
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Kennicott	She suddenly saw the foot-board of the bed as the foot-stone of the grave of love. The room was drab-colored and ill-ventilated--[MASK] did not “believe in opening the windows so darn wide that you heat all outdoors.”
<name>Wat</name>	Wat	Heard	but i dont get better so i like to heir Wat you tink about it i feel like dis Disconfebil feeling around the Stomac after eating and dat Pain around [MASK] and down the arm and about 3 to 3 1/2 Hour after Eating i feel weeak like and dissy and a dull Hadig.
<name>Ibsen</name>	Ibsen	Brieux	Nor was she thinking of squaws and portages, and the Yankee fur-traders whose shadows were all about her. She was meditating upon walnut fudge, the plays of [MASK], the reasons why heels run over, and the fact that the chemistry instructor had stared at the new coiffure which concealed her ears.
<name>Carol</name>	Carol	Carol	New ideas are first-rate, but not all this criticism. Enough trouble in life without looking for it!” Thus the Chautauqua, as [MASK] saw it. After it, the town felt proud and educated. VIII
<name>Raine</name>	Raine	Carol	He leaped from the buggy, twisted the reins about the whip-socket, swung her out, caught up his gun, slipped in two shells, stalked toward the rigid dog, [MASK] pattering after him. The setter crawled ahead, his tail quivering, his belly close to the stubble.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Kennicott	She flung her arms about [MASK], kissed him. “Like it, old lady?” “It’s adorable. It’s so amusing. I love you for bringing me. You really are a dear!”
<name>Janitor</name>	Janitor	Perrys	A broad stairway led from the street to the upper hall, along which were the doors of a lawyer’s office, a dentist’s, a photographer’s “studio,” the lodge-rooms of the Affiliated Order of Spartans and, at the back, the [MASK]’ apartment.
