<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bashi	She tried to catch up with his long stride; when [MASK] realized this, he slowed down. “Do you know who I saw today?” he asked. “No.” “Do you want to know?”
<name>Yezhov</name>	Yezhov	Baba	“The lesson for you is: Never act against government officials. Don’t think [MASK] is only a drunkard. He knows every rule by heart and he doesn’t make mistakes. Otherwise, he would not have lived till now, with a counterrevolutionary father.”
<name>Yosaku</name>	Yosaku	Bashi	When he was out of sight of townspeople, he sat down on a boulder and wept. “What are you crying here for, first thing in the morning?” asked someone, kicking his foot lightly. [MASK] wiped his face with the back of his hand.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Uncle	“If not for your mother and your sister, I would send for the police. Now take the money and buy some good clothes for your sister.” The boy looked at the money and swallowed hard. “I killed your dog by accident, [MASK],” he said.
<name>John</name>	John	Shan	Ten years were not hard to go through, he said to his wife and daughter, just a small fraction of one’s long life. Things could be worse, he told them. [MASK] was sneering the entire time that he spoke.
<name>John</name>	John	Jialin	“Yes.” “I didn’t know you had done everything by yourself.” [MASK] shook his head and said it had been done with the help of several other friends. “But why did we wait if you had the leaflets ready?”
<name>He</name>	He	Gousheng	“Yes, but I wouldn’t have felt so much pressure if I’d had a brother.” “You and—your wife—don’t have children?” [MASK] shook his head. “Not a trace of a baby anywhere,” he said.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Bashi	She could bolt the gate from the inside, and by the time the men broke it down she and [MASK] would be gone from the yard, the house, and this world of horrors. “But I’m busy tonight. Can I come tomorrow morning?”
<name>John</name>	John	Bashi	“Why should I tell you?” “Because I can pay the same amount to you for not collecting her body.” “Who will, then? You can’t leave a body to rot by itself on the island.” “I will,” [MASK] said.
<name>James</name>	James	Bashi	His father had been a war hero, [MASK] explained, so they were granted more space for their house; however, he added, the construction team hadn’t bothered to make it presentable, building a two-room house like every other house on the street, only twice as big.
<name>John</name>	John	Bashi	What a stupid dog, [MASK] thought; he withdrew his hand from his pocket and clapped. “Sorry, I haven’t got meat for you today. You see, I’m running some other errands today.” The dog circled him for a minute and ran away.
<name>Yasha</name>	Yasha	Tong	She took it, and then tore the flower off 2i8 » The Vagrants the paper stem and squeezed both together into a small ball. When [MASK] raised his voice and asked her why, she put a warm, soft palm over his lips.
<name>Lin</name>	Lin	Nini	“One of these days I’ll take you to a movie.” [MASK] had never been to a movie theater. Once in a while, her parents would go to see a film with their working units; her two sisters went with their school too.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Nini	[MASK]’s father beckoned to her and said, “Come on. If you don’t hurry, we’ll finish yours for you.” Her sisters all giggled, a little nervously at first, more boldly when their mother did not shout and tell them to stay quiet.
<name>Lin</name>	Lin	Bashi	It seemed that [MASK] could sit here talking to her, or to himself, all morning. If she did not return in time to cook before her parents came home for lunch, as she hadn’t the night before for dinner, her mother would let that bamboo broomstick rain down on her back again.
<name>Essie</name>	Essie	Nini	So they’ll eat the ginseng root without thinking and then they’ll get such a fire in their stomachs they will wring themselves to death regretting they took that sweet bite of stolen food.” [MASK] shuddered. She looked at the jar in her hands.
<name>the woman</name>	the woman	Bashi	He dipped the pen into the ink bottle and said to the woman as he wrote, “You know, she is the only one I have and I’m her only one too.” The woman raised an eyebrow and glanced at [MASK] without replying.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Bashi	She was relieved when she found half an orange left next to [MASK]’s pillow. She peeled one slice and sucked it while putting the rest of the orange into the fire. The fire engulfed the half orange and soon the room was filled with a more pleasant smell.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Bashi	“I wasn’t really sleeping. I came back from a walk and thought I would take a rest in bed,” [MASK] said. “In fact, I was dreaming about you when you came in.” “What idiot would believe you?”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Han	But she felt an urge to hug him as a mother would, to comfort a child who had tried hard to act like a brave man. [MASK] broke down again in her arms, and she let him bury his face in her hair, feeling the dampness on her collar.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Nini	[MASK] felt him gently move her legs apart. She was about to ask him what he was doing under there, when a finger tentatively touched her between her legs. She badly felt a need to pee but she held it in and waited.
<name>Maria</name>	Maria	Bashi	“How lucky I am,” [MASK] said. “I am the lucky one.” They lay in each other’s arms. From time to time one or the other would break the silence and talk of plans for themselves and the baby, their future life.
<name>Chen</name>	Chen	Tong	[MASK] stammered and said he had never thought of stealing anyone’s chicken. “Don’t think I didn’t hear that little abacus clicking in your belly when you looked at my chickens,” the old woman said. “A village boy like you!”
<name>Heinrich</name>	Heinrich	Kai	The harmless question, however, seemed to throw both men into instant confusion; they glanced at each other, and when the older man lowered his head, the young apprentice replied that they had been assigned a political task by the city government. [MASK] frowned.
<name>Lin</name>	Lin	Nini	He checked their contents and whistled. “I thought she saved everything in our bank account,” he said. He pulled out two ten-yuan bills and handed them to [MASK]. She shook her head and said she did not want the money.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Tong	“Say, between seven and twelve o’clock?” [MASK] shook his head. He had a vague feeling that they did not believe him, and sooner or later they would reveal his lie to the school and his parents. What would they do with him then?
<name>Rainsford</name>	Rainsford	Bashi	I’m going to the island to see the execution itself.” Once the words were said, [MASK]’s mind was made up. Why should he be one of the marching crowds when he had all the freedom in the world to do what he wanted?
<name>Belisario</name>	Belisario	Gousheng	“My name is [MASK],” the man said, and then, as if apologizing, he explained that his parents were illiterate, and that they had given him the name, a dog’s leftovers, to make sure he would not be desired by devils.
<name>Malala</name>	Malala	Jialin	“Other things? What else did people say?” “They said she must be using the rally to become famous,” [MASK]’s mother said. “But I don’t understand. She’s already famous. Why did she need to become more famous?”
<name>himself</name>	himself	Bashi	She said she would come back the next day after her parents and sisters left the house. “You can prove yourself to me then,” she said, and left without giving [MASK] a chance to defend himself.
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Kwen	he asked. “Why, are you afraid now?” [MASK] said, and bent down to study the body. “I didn’t pay you to tag along.” “Afraid? No, no. Just making sure she has no chance.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Kai	Tell them that we’ll send someone to get you back as soon as we settle things here,” said [MASK]. She won- dered how much the girl understood the situation, and if this lie would be enough to offer her and her parents some comfort and hope.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Tong	She went for the basin first and checked the enamel bottom carefully before she said in a disaproving tone, “[MASK], you’re old enough to know what you shouldn’t do.” He felt the sting of tears but it would be wrong to cry.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Tong	“Why?” “The government wouldn’t have killed the wrong person in the first place.” “Was my grandfather a bad person?” [MASK]’s mother was quiet for a long time and then got up to close the bedroom door.
<name>She</name>	She	Shan	The boyfriend turned the letter in to the city Revolution Committee. [MASK] got a ten-year sentence and her boyfriend was awarded the privilege of joining the army, even though his background—a family of capitalists and counterrevolutionaries—had not been good enough for him to enlist.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Tong	The old woman next to the auntie bowed and thanked [MASK] as if he were another grown-up. Close-up, he recognized her now, the one who had burned the clothes at the crossroad on the day of the execution.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Nini	“Do you have a stomachache?” “What ideas do you have about the baby?” [MASK] said. “I tell you— she’s not yours. She’ll have the best man in the world.” “A man even better than I?”
<name>Arash</name>	Arash	Tong	Regardless of how dismal his life would turn out to be, when [MASK] entered the principal’s office the morning after his father’s arrest, he saw nothing but the blossom of his belief, more splendid than all the flowers, purer than pure gold.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Kwen	“I promise.” “Don’t you want to know what the promise is?” “As long as you don’t want me to kill a person.” “Why would I want you to kill a person?” [MASK] asked.
<name>James</name>	James	Han	Before she had a chance to question the men further, the door to her flat opened and [MASK] smiled at her mysteriously. He had a surprise for her, he said, and told her to close her eyes.
<name>Offred</name>	Offred	Shan	She imagined sneaking the words pioneer and martyr into the announcement of the execution. Would [MASK], who was probably being offered her last breakfast and perhaps a change of clean clothes, hear the voice of a friend she had perhaps long ago ceased hoping for in her long years of imprisonment?
<name>He</name>	He	Kai	“The old witch is playing deaf and mute,” the security patrol said, and added that his companion had gone to fetch the police. [MASK] looked at the top of the old woman’s head, barely covered by thin gray hair.
<name>She</name>	She	Kai	She stared at them, and only when the men exchanged a look between themselves did [MASK] realize that she had fixed her eyes on them for a moment too long. She turned toward the stairs and walked up to the banquet room.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Bashi	He turned to walk away but [MASK] caught up with him, holding the hedgehog in the cup of his two hands. “I’m teaching you a lesson. Sometimes you think your dog is your best friend but you may be wrong.
<name>He</name>	He	Tong	She put dinner on the table and brought out a bottle of rice liquor. [MASK] took the bottle from her and poured some of the liquor into a porcelain cup. When his father was drunk and asleep, he would beg his mother for help.
<name>Antonio</name>	Antonio	Bashi	The neighbors and strangers would all say it was their good fortune that the ugly girl had finally been plucked out of their life. No one would miss her. [MASK] told her again to think about what he could offer.
<name>Yvette</name>	Yvette	Shan	“What is the right thing to do? To applaud the murderers of our daughter?” The unfamiliar shrillness had returned to her voice, and her face took on a harsh expression. “Everybody dies,” he said. “[MASK] is being murdered.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Kai	Her in-laws treated her well, but they would never hesitate to let her know that she was the one to have married up in the family. She had told the nanny that she would be home around lunchtime, [MASK] said.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tong	“I’m not talking about the cat,” the old woman said. [MASK] looked up at the woman, baffled. “I’m talking about you, boy. You thought you could snatch the hen when nobody was around, huh?”
<name>Anastasia</name>	Anastasia	Nini	She had no other choice; he was not a bad one, in any case. “Will you marry me if I agree to marry you?” [MASK] said. “Of course. What do I need other women for if you agree to marry me?”
<name>Baodi</name>	Baodi	Tong	[MASK] read the announcement aloud, skipping the words he did not know how to pronounce but guessing their meanings without much trouble: Counterrevolutionary Gu Shan, female, twenty-eight, was sentenced to death, with all political rights deprived.
<name>Andrei</name>	Andrei	Bashi	The older man coughed and pulled his companion’s sleeve. [MASK] looked at the two and smiled. “Don’t think I’m an idiot,” he said. “You’re here because of the rally, no?” “Who told you this?”
<name>Arvind</name>	Arvind	Tong	Next to him on the brick bed, his parents were asleep, his mother’s hair swirled around his father’s finger. [MASK] tiptoed over his parents’ feet and reached for his clothes, which his mother always kept warm above the woodstove.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bashi	“How old are you?” “Fifty-six.” “But I bet there’s one thing you don’t know,” [MASK] said. With the body secured in the sacks, he felt safe and in good humor again. “That is?”
<name>Ketut</name>	Ketut	Tong	the yard was quiet in an eerie way when [MASK] woke up before daybreak. He opened the gate, hoping to see an eager Ear waiting for him outside, but apart from a few early-rising men loading their bicycles with bamboo boxes of offerings for their outings, the alley was empty.
<name>Grumio</name>	Grumio	Bashi	“They wrap the chicken up in mud and put the whole thing into hot ashes. When the roasting is done, you break the mud shell and eat the tender meat. The same with hedgehog, I heard.” [MASK] rubbed mud onto the hedgehog until it was totally enclosed.
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Tong	“You can’t argue with the police order.” “Don’t fuss, woman,” [MASK]’s father said. “It seems that I have to condescend to a journey tonight. Why are we still standing and wasting our lives, brothers?”
<name>Xiangzi</name>	Xiangzi	Nini	In the front room [MASK] grabbed the bamboo basket for collecting coal and stumbled on a pair of boots. A few steps into the alley, she could still hear the baby’s crying. Someone banged on the window and protested.
<name>Psyche</name>	Psyche	Tong	She replied that she would oblige him on the spot by removing his eyeballs if he really wanted to be blind; the man urged her to do so, saying that he had no use for his eyes now that he had seen her heavenly beauty. [MASK] walked on.
<name>He</name>	He	Bashi	“Yes, you’re perfect for a wife, and of course we will be one day soon.” “Why not now?” [MASK] seemed baffled and unable to answer her question. “People need a wedding ceremony to become husband and wife,” he said finally.
<name>He</name>	He	Bashi	“I’ve known you enough not to suspect you as a bad person, but anyone else who hears you say this will think you crazy.” “Why?” “She’s still a child.” “But she’ll grow up,” [MASK] said.
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Bashi	“Don’t make me lose you again.” the woman’s body was lying facedown on the crystallized snow, her arms wrenched and bound behind her back in an intricate way. Her head, unlike what [MASK] had imagined, was in one complete piece.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Bashi	The dog belonged to a newcomer in town, and [MASK] had studied both the dog and the boy. He thought Ear a strange name for a dog, and believed the boy who had named him must have something wrong with him.
<name>Yolanda</name>	Yolanda	Nini	In those moments the hand was like someone else’s, and she had to touch each finger to know it was there. “Someone has put a curse on us through you, [MASK], and that’s why we never get to have a boy in our family.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Kai	“It’s the same old truth—the one who robs and succeeds will become the king, and the one who tries to rob and fails will be called a criminal.” [MASK] grabbed the edge of the table where she was leaning, and tried to steady herself.
<name>Yasha</name>	Yasha	Tong	“If you have a right heart, you’ll find the right way,” the teacher said of the story’s moral. Since then [MASK] had tried to keep the right heart and had gathered a handful of pencil stumps that other children had discarded.
<name>dead</name>	dead	Gu	He wished it was his duty to read the letters sent back to the [MASK] address, but that job belonged to another colleague, a woman in her late thirties who always sucked hard candy when she read, and the small distracting noise the candy made, clicking against her teeth, annoyed the old man.
<name>Yael</name>	Yael	Tong	“It’s not that I’m not sympathetic,” [MASK]’s mother said. “But what difference would we make? The dead are dead.” “But if we don’t speak up now, there will be a next time, another child maybe.
<name>Lincoln</name>	Lincoln	Tong	The comment had left [MASK] more sad than proud at first, but after a while he learned to cheer himself up: After all, praise from the teacher was praise, and an accumulation of these favorable comments could eventually make him an important pupil in the teacher’s eyes.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Kai	Sometimes the echo of her voice came back with a life of its own, vibrant with energy, and [MASK] knew that she was being watched with admiration and perhaps benign desires, replacing a lover, a wife, or a child in a stranger’s heart, no matter how fleetingly.
<name>Jackson</name>	Jackson	Tong	I tell you, Son, don’t ever do anything less than he did.” [MASK]’s paternal grandfather was, according to his father’s drunken tales, a local legend, with a firecracker temper, ready to fight anyone over the slightest injustice.
<name>Grigory</name>	Grigory	Bashi	He must be coming back from the night shift. “Leave me alone,” [MASK] said. “That’s not the right way to answer a friendly greeting. Would you care for a piece of pig-head meat?”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Tong	His father’s ease and confidence frightened [MASK]. He imagined his father’s shock when he was shown his own name signed on the white cloth. Would his mind be lucid enough for him to point out that the handwriting was not his?
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Kwen	“That suits me fine.” “I’ll die if you don’t tell me.” “Nobody dies from curiosity,” [MASK] said with a smile. “I’ll stop being your friend then.”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Tong	The wind brought a stale smell of old, unmelted snow. [MASK] stripped a layer of pale, starchy bark off a birch tree, and sat down with his stump of pencil. He wrote onto the bark the words he remembered from the announcement: Female.
<name>James</name>	James	Tong	She was the kind of the girl who blushed at every word she said, and [MASK] looked at her crimson face, finding it hard to believe her. Half an hour later, the principal led the teachers into the auditorium.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Nini	Her thin gray hair was coiled in the style of an old woman’s bun, with a few strands escaping the hairnet. She looked like an old woman [MASK] might have liked, but maybe death made people look kind, as none of the old women she met in the marketplace was nice to her.
<name>John</name>	John	Bashi	“What a surprise. What are you doing here?” “I’m here for what you’re here for.” “What am I here for?” [MASK] asked with great interest. “The execution, no?” “Wrong.
<name>she</name>	she	Kwen	He breathed hard, trying to control a bout of nausea. “Thanks for reminding me,” he said. “I’m going there now.” “But you’re walking in the wrong direction,” [MASK] said.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Nini	She put a finger into the baby’s mouth and calmed her. The two younger girls wandered around the yard, checking the pile of firewood at a corner, crushing a few pieces of soft coal into powder. [MASK] peeked out from behind the fence.
<name>Albert</name>	Albert	Bashi	She wondered if it was a present she could hide from her parents and sisters. [MASK] put the box on the table and opened it; then he stepped aside, gave her a great bow, and invited her to step forward, as if he were a master magician.
<name>Antonia</name>	Antonia	Shan	His wife would have simply endured the loss of [MASK] in painful silence, as all illiterate women endured the loss of their children, surrendering them to an indisputable fate and putting their only hope in the next life. The old guardian rang a bell.
<name>He</name>	He	Bashi	She sat up and said it was time for her to go; she moved slowly, as if her body were filled with lazy dreams too heavy for her to carry. She might as well let her parents and her sisters wait. “Are you coming in the afternoon?” [MASK] asked.
<name>Yulia</name>	Yulia	Nini	“What’s there to see? They took her away first thing after the meeting was over. By now she’s probably been shot.” Disappointed, [MASK] told her sisters to stand farther away from the entrance so the crowd would not step on them.
<name>Juan</name>	Juan	Jialin	“Mama, don’t worry,” he said. “Nothing has happened, and people are just indulging their imaginations.” “There must not be a heaven above us,” [MASK]’s mother said, dabbing at her eyes with the corner of her blouse.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Kai	She wondered if he would soon settle for a grandparent’s shoe for the game. “Why did you do it? What is it that you want that you haven’t got?” This question had never been put to [MASK] before. She shook her head.
<name>Amara</name>	Amara	Nini	What if the ghost was watching her? But what kind of a ghost was she if she didn’t come to rescue her own grandson? [MASK] said a low prayer to the old woman and asked her to understand who her real enemies were. “Are you bluffing?
<name>Matilda</name>	Matilda	Tong	“There’s no law that says I can’t walk with you.” “But you don’t follow people if they tell you they don’t want to play with you,” [MASK] said with exasperation. “Whose rule is that?
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Bashi	“At least you remember some?” “Let’s see,” [MASK] thought, and listed the names, some he had seen at the rally, a few others who had, at one time or another, offended him.
<name>Humpty</name>	Humpty	Ear	Perhaps nothing bad would happen, after all, as his father said. This hope cheered him as he walked to school. But what if his father was wrong? Grown-ups made mistakes, as they had said nothing would happen to [MASK].
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tong	“There you go,” one man said, with a short chuckle. “But what did he do, really?” [MASK]’s mother mumbled. “Black words on white paper,” another man said. “You can’t argue with the police order.”
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Jialin	Soon she would have to finish this conversation with him; soon she would be expected onstage, and he, already deemed more than half-deceased by the world, would not be in the audience. “You said something the last time I saw you,” [MASK] said, and then shook his head.
<name>She</name>	She	Kai	The statement was delivered with a cold anger that she had not known existed behind his calm gentleness, and [MASK] had to leave his shack without an apology. He had informed her of his condition when they had first met, six months earlier, but afterward the tuberculosis had never been brought up.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Kwen	“When?” “Last night. This morning. I don’t know. She just died.” “Sorry to hear that,” [MASK] said. “But how old was she?” “Eighty-one.”
<name>Artem</name>	Artem	Bashi	[MASK] waited for her to bring up the topic of marriage again; he believed everything he had told her when he had conducted his bridal check, but he knew that marriage to a twelve-year-old was easier said than done.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Nini	A dog darted across the alley, yelping, chased by a policeman waving his baton. “Quick, they’re coming,” a voice shouted. The man who had been chasing the dog ran back, and [MASK] looked out again. Someone was dragged into the alley.
<name>Lin</name>	Lin	Bashi	Your family didn’t have ancestors buried here,” said [MASK]. “They don’t have a wire service in the mountain for them to send the offerings.” “They just want an excuse to waste all the money and go to to the mountain for fun.”
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Tong	The chair had been placed in the middle of the room, facing the desk and the two chairs behind it. [MASK] tried to fix his eyes on his shoes, but having their own will, his eyes soon wandered to the four legs underneath the desk across the room.
<name>Katya</name>	Katya	Jialin	“I’m protecting you too,” [MASK] said. “Each one of us could be the one to sell out our friends.” “Was it a decision agreed to by all your friends, for you to write to me?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bashi	“Hey, you’re hurting me,” [MASK] said. “What do you want to know?” “All that you know,” the older man said. “As I said, you need to promise to help me first.”
