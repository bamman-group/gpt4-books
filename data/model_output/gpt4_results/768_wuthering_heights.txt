<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Heathcliff	Do come to me, [MASK].' In her eagerness she rose and supported herself on the arm of the chair. At that earnest appeal he turned to her, looking absolutely desperate. His eyes, wide and wet, at last flashed fiercely on her; his breast heaved convulsively.
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Linton	'"A wicked boy, at all events," remarked the old lady, "and quite unfit for a decent house! Did you notice his language, [MASK]? I'm shocked that my children should have heard it."
<name>Hagar</name>	Hagar	Zillah	He stood by the fire, his back towards me, just finishing a stormy scene with poor [MASK]; who ever and anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron, and heave an indignant groan. '
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Heathcliff	'No, that man is not my son,' answered [MASK], pushing me aside. 'But I have one, and you have seen him before too; and, though your nurse is in a hurry, I think both you and she would be the better for a little rest.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Heathcliff	We didn't care whether you kept with us or not; I merely thought [MASK]'s talk would have nothing entertaining for your ears.' 'Oh, no,' wept the young lady; 'you wished me away, because you knew I liked to be there!'
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Linton	'But I couldn't have been hurt by that little push, and I had no idea that you could, either: you're not much, are you, [MASK]? Don't let me go home thinking I've done you harm. Answer!
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Ellen	'Aha, [MASK]!' she cried, gaily, jumping up and running to my side. 'I shall have a pretty story to tell to-night; and so you've found me out. Have you ever been here in your life before?'
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Heathcliff	'It's well the hellish villain has kept his word!' growled my future host, searching the darkness beyond me in expectation of discovering [MASK]; and then he indulged in a soliloquy of execrations, and threats of what he would have done had the 'fiend' deceived him.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Edgar	But there are several other handsome, rich young men in the world: handsomer, possibly, and richer than he is. What should hinder you from loving them?' 'If there be any, they are out of my way: I've seen none like [MASK].'
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Hindley	But it is utterly impossible I can ever be revenged, and therefore I cannot forgive him. [MASK] wanted some water, and I handed him a glass, and asked him how he was. '"Not as ill as I wish," he replied.
<name>Hindley</name>	Hindley	Joseph	In two hours, I called [MASK] to carry him up again; and since then my presence is as potent on his nerves as a ghost; and I fancy he sees me often, though I am not near.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Heathcliff	He thought me too poor to wed his sister,' answered [MASK], 'and was grieved that I got her: his pride was hurt, and he'll never forgive it.' 'That's wrong!' said the young lady: 'some time I'll tell him so.
<name>Linton</name>	Linton	Linton	Each has a bludgeon; and master will, very likely, be watching from the parlour-windows to see that they fulfil his orders.' The gardeners and coachman were there: but [MASK] was with them. They had already entered the court.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Kenneth	observed [MASK], interrogatively. 'Sorry? he'll break his heart should anything happen!' I replied. 'Don't alarm him more than necessary.' 'Well, I told him to beware,' said my companion; 'and he must bide the consequences of neglecting my warning!
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Catherine	She lay still now, her face bathed in tears. Exhaustion of body had entirely subdued her spirit: our fiery [MASK] was no better than a wailing child. 'How long is it since I shut myself in here?' she asked, suddenly reviving. '
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Heathcliff	The next time [MASK] came my young lady chanced to be feeding some pigeons in the court. She had never spoken a word to her sister-in-law for three days; but she had likewise dropped her fretful complaining, and we found it a great comfort.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Hareton	The entire world is a dreadful collection of memoranda that she did exist, and that I have lost her! Well, [MASK]'s aspect was the ghost of my immortal love; of my wild endeavours to hold my right; my degradation, my pride, my happiness, and my anguish-- '
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Catherine	The surprise petrified her an instant: she uttered an inarticulate exclamation, and stood fixed. 'My dear Miss [MASK],' I began, too vividly impressed by her recent kindness to break into a scold, 'where have you been riding out at this hour?
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Zillah	I ran into the yard, sick with terror; and called for [MASK], as loud as I could. She soon heard me: she was milking the cows in a shed behind the barn, and hurrying from her work, she inquired what there was to do?
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Catherine	He struggled long to keep up an equality with [MASK] in her studies, and yielded with poignant though silent regret: but he yielded completely; and there was no prevailing on him to take a step in the way of moving upward, when he found he must, necessarily, sink beneath his former level.
<name>Minny</name>	Minny	Minny	'But I know the park, and I don't know those,' she murmured to herself. 'And I should delight to look round me from the brow of that tallest point: my little pony [MASK] shall take me some time.'
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Heathcliff	It's like a colt's mane over his eyes!' He ventured this remark without any intention to insult; but [MASK]'s violent nature was not prepared to endure the appearance of impertinence from one whom he seemed to hate, even then, as a rival.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Catherine	'No,' said [MASK]; 'unless in dreams. I cannot conceive how you manage to doze out of doors, in the morning.' 'I thought I heard my father,' he gasped, glancing up to the frowning nab above us.
<name>Nelly</name>	Nelly	Nelly	You must come home directly. You're to nurse it, [MASK]: to feed it with sugar and milk, and take care of it day and night. I wish I were you, because it will be all yours when there is no missis!' '
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Catherine	'I promised mamma that I wouldn't say one word to him, and I didn't.' 'Well, don't cry,' replied [MASK], contemptuously; 'you're not killed. Don't make more mischief; my brother is coming: be quiet!
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Catherine	I believe you think me a fiend,' he said, with his dismal laugh: 'something too horrible to live under a decent roof.' Then turning to [MASK], who was there, and who drew behind me at his approach, he added, half sneeringly,--'Will
<name>Linton</name>	Linton	Linton	tell me the meaning of this strange talk, and I will. You contradict your own words, and distract me! Be calm and frank, and confess at once all that weighs on your heart. You wouldn't injure me, [MASK], would you?
<name>Linton</name>	Linton	Linton	I would not strike him with my fist, but I'd kick him with my foot, and experience considerable satisfaction. Is he weeping, or is he going to faint for fear?' The fellow approached and gave the chair on which [MASK] rested a push.
<name>Edgar</name>	Edgar	Nelly	What did I say, [MASK]? I've forgotten. Was he vexed at my bad humour this afternoon? Dear! tell me what I've said to grieve him? I do wish he'd come. I do wish he would!'
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Heathcliff	He fair shaamed to 'bide still and see it.' She did not stay to retaliate, but re-entered in a minute, bearing a reaming silver pint, whose contents I lauded with becoming earnestness. And afterwards she furnished me with the sequel of [MASK]'s history.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Nelly	I expect you to feel flattered. Nay, it's not [MASK]; don't look at her! My poor little sister-in-law is breaking her heart by mere contemplation of your physical and moral beauty.
<name>Hareton</name>	Hareton	Catherine	I won't drink that. Give me another.' [MASK] pushed another to him, and wiped her face. I felt disgusted at the little wretch's composure, since he was no longer in terror for himself.
<name>Joseph</name>	Joseph	Joseph	I hallooed, responsively. 'There's nobbut t' missis; and shoo'll not oppen 't an ye mak' yer flaysome dins till neeght.' 'Why? Cannot you tell her whom I am, eh, [MASK]?' 'Nor-ne me!
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Cathy	And, in the morning, I often feel sick--papa says I grow so fast.' Badly satisfied, [MASK] sat down, and he reclined beside her. 'This is something like your paradise,' said she, making an effort at cheerfulness.
<name>Louisa</name>	Louisa	Linton	She wrote to inform her brother of the probable conclusion of a four-months' indisposition under which she had suffered, and entreated him to come to her, if possible; for she had much to settle, and she wished to bid him adieu, and deliver [MASK] safely into his hands.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Heathcliff	I could not bear the employment. I took my dingy volume by the scroop, and hurled it into the dog-kennel, vowing I hated a good book. [MASK] kicked his to the same place. Then there was a hubbub!
<name>Trantridge</name>	Trantridge	Gimmerton	One of the maids, a thoughtless girl, who had been on an early errand to [MASK], came panting up-stairs, open-mouthed, and dashed into the chamber, crying: 'Oh, dear, dear! What mun we have next?
<name>Blackbird</name>	Blackbird	Minny	I'll not stay here! I'll not stay here!' Then the latch was raised and fell: they did not suffer him to come forth. I mounted [MASK], and urged her to a trot; and so my brief guardianship ended. CHAPTER XXI
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Heathcliff	He was so obstinate in his resolution, that [MASK] deemed it expedient to compel from my lips a recapitulation of what had taken place; standing over me, heaving with malevolence, as I reluctantly delivered the account in answer to his questions.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Catherine	[MASK]! you mustn't go and leave, after all. You _must_ obey my father--you _must_!' 'I must obey my own,' she replied, 'and relieve him from this cruel suspense. The whole night!
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Nelly	She was vexed, but she did not proceed. Apparently taking up another subject, she recommenced in a short time. 'If I were in heaven, [MASK], I should be extremely miserable.' 'Because you are not fit to go there,' I answered.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Nelly	'If you talk so, I won't tell you any more,' she returned, peevishly rising to her feet. 'I accepted him, [MASK]. Be quick, and say whether I was wrong!' 'You accepted him!
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Heathcliff	My master's surprise equalled or exceeded mine: he remained for a minute at a loss how to address the ploughboy, as he had called him. [MASK] dropped his slight hand, and stood looking at him coolly till he chose to speak.
<name>Minny</name>	Minny	Minny	you see you have got into pretty company,' I interposed. 'Nice words to be used to a young lady! Pray don't begin to dispute with him. Come, let us seek for [MASK] ourselves, and begone.' '
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Linton	The whole night! What would he think? He'll be distressed already. I'll either break or burn a way out of the house. Be quiet! You're in no danger; but if you hinder me--[MASK], I love papa better than you!'
<name>Providence</name>	Providence	Hivin	Thank [MASK] for all! All warks togither for gooid to them as is chozzen, and piked out fro' th' rubbidge! Yah knaw whet t' Scripture ses.' And he began quoting several texts, referring us to chapters and verses where we might find them.
<name>Hareton</name>	Hareton	Hareton	I lifted [MASK] in my arms, and walked off to the kitchen with him, leaving the door of communication open, for I was curious to watch how they would settle their disagreement. The insulted visitor moved to the spot where he had laid his hat, pale and with a quivering lip.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Heathcliff	In fact, it formed a little closet, and the ledge of a window, which it enclosed, served as a table. I slid back the panelled sides, got in with my light, pulled them together again, and felt secure against the vigilance of [MASK], and every one else.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Earnshaw	[MASK] was not to be civilized with a wish, and my young lady was no philosopher, and no paragon of patience; but both their minds tending to the same point--one loving and desiring to esteem, and the other loving and desiring to be esteemed--they contrived in the end to reach it.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Ellen	May we not go a little way--half a mile, [MASK], only just half a mile? Do say Yes: to that clump of birches at the turn!' I refused staunchly. At length her suspense was ended: the travelling carriage rolled in sight.
<name>Edgar</name>	Edgar	Edgar	'No, you have not,' said the infatuated girl. 'I love him more than ever you loved [MASK], and he might love me, if you would let him!' 'I wouldn't be you for a kingdom, then!'
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Catherine	You'll get nobody to take that, [MASK],' I said, 'if you write it; and at present I shall put out your candle.' I set the extinguisher on the flame, receiving as I did so a slap on my hand and a petulant 'cross thing!'
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Linton	But my sleep was marred a second time by a sharp ringing of the bell--the only bell we have, put up on purpose for [MASK]; and the master called to me to see what was the matter, and inform them that he wouldn't have that noise repeated.
<name>Hannah</name>	Hannah	Cathy	He must have seen [MASK] and her cousin about the spot before he examined it, for while his jaws worked like those of a cow chewing its cud, and rendered his speech difficult to understand, he began:-- 'I mun hev' my wage, and I mun goa!
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Heathcliff	And you won't write her a little note, sir?' I asked, imploringly. 'No,' he answered. 'It is needless. My communication with [MASK]'s family shall be as sparing as his with mine. It shall not exist!'
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Miss	I've said I did not love her, and rather relished mortifying her vanity now and then: besides, she hurt me extremely; so I started up from my knees, and screamed out, 'Oh, [MASK], that's a nasty trick!
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Linton	Begone wi' ye both!" 'He swore at us, and left [MASK] no time to answer, nearly throwing him into the kitchen; and he clenched his fist as I followed, seemingly longing to knock me down.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Earnshaw	He had a terror of [MASK]'s reputation, and shrunk from encountering him; and yet he was always received with our best attempts at civility: the master himself avoided offending him, knowing why he came; and if he could not be gracious, kept out of the way.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Linton	Tell the truth about it, [MASK]; for I musn't come, if I have hurt you.' 'You must come, to cure me,' he answered. 'You ought to come, because you have hurt me: you know you have extremely!
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Edgar	He would have risen, and unfixed her fingers by the act--she clung fast, gasping: there was mad resolution in her face. 'No!' she shrieked. 'Oh, don't, don't go. It is the last time! [MASK] will not hurt us.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Heathcliff	'Gone to heaven, I hope; where we may, every one, join her, if we take due warning and leave our evil ways to follow good!' 'Did _she_ take due warning, then?' asked [MASK], attempting a sneer.
<name>Nelly</name>	Nelly	Ellen	'He's just like a dog, is he not, [MASK]?' she once observed, 'or a cart-horse? He does his work, eats his food, and sleeps eternally! What a blank, dreary mind he must have!
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Catherine	'I don't mind the conversation,' she answered: 'I wanted to be with--' 'Well?' said [MASK], perceiving her hesitate to complete the sentence. 'With him: and I won't be always sent off!'
<name>Hareton</name>	Hareton	Hareton	I frowned, and then she glanced towards the master: whose mind was occupied on other subjects than his company, as his countenance evinced; and she grew serious for an instant, scrutinizing him with deep gravity. Afterwards she turned, and recommenced her nonsense; at last, [MASK] uttered a smothered laugh.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Hareton	He had not only twitched his shoulder but clenched his fist, as if tempted to use it. 'I know why [MASK] never speaks, when I am in the kitchen,' she exclaimed, on another occasion. 'He is afraid I shall laugh at him.
<name>Cathy</name>	Cathy	Cathy	What do you talk about? You might be dumb, or a baby, for anything you say to amuse me, or for anything you do, either!' 'You never told me before that I talked too little, or that you disliked my company, [MASK]!'
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Catherine	I's gang up to my own rahm. This hoile's neither mensful nor seemly for us: we mun side out and seearch another.' 'Come, [MASK],' I said, 'we must "side out" too: I've done my ironing.
<name>Nelly</name>	Nelly	Nelly	I made him promise he'd never shoot a lapwing after that, and he didn't. Yes, here are more! Did he shoot my lapwings, [MASK]? Are they red, any of them? Let me look.' 'Give over with that baby-work!'
<name>Nelly</name>	Nelly	Nelly	'I'd rayther, by th' haulf, hev' 'em swearing i' my lugs fro'h morn to neeght, nor hearken ye hahsiver!' said the tenant of the kitchen, in answer to an unheard speech of [MASK]'s.
<name>Cathy</name>	Cathy	Cathy	'What ails you, [MASK]?' he was saying when I entered: 'you look as dismal as a drowned whelp. Why are you so damp and pale, child?' 'I've been wet,' she answered reluctantly, 'and I'm cold, that's all.'
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Hareton	'Nonsense!' said I, 'do you imagine he has thought as much of you as you have of him? Hasn't he [MASK] for a companion? Not one in a hundred would weep at losing a relation they had just seen twice, for two afternoons.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Catherine	And [MASK] has a heart as deep as I have: the sea could be as readily contained in that horse-trough as her whole affection be monopolised by him. Tush! He is scarcely a degree dearer to her than her dog, or her horse.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Hindley	'"Let me in by the kitchen door," he said. '"[MASK] will be there before me," I answered: "and that's a poor love of yours that cannot bear a shower of snow!
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Heathcliff	I'll be bound, you are taller and twice as broad across the shoulders; you could knock him down in a twinkling; don't you feel that you could?' [MASK]'s face brightened a moment; then it was overcast afresh, and he sighed.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Hareton	[MASK] says he wakes and shrieks in the night by the hour together, and calls you to protect him from me; and, whether you like your precious mate, or not, you must come: he's your concern now; I yield all my interest in him to you.'
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Catherine	Hush, hush, [MASK]! I'll stay. If he shot me so, I'd expire with a blessing on my lips.' And there they were fast again. I heard my master mounting the stairs--the cold sweat ran from my forehead: I was horrified.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Catherine	[MASK] and I set out on our first ride to join her cousin. It was a close, sultry day: devoid of sunshine, but with a sky too dappled and hazy to threaten rain: and our place of meeting had been fixed at the guide-stone, by the cross-roads.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Heathcliff	'Your land, insolent slut! You never had any,' said [MASK]. 'And my money,' she continued; returning his angry glare, and meantime biting a piece of crust, the remnant of her breakfast. 'Silence!' he exclaimed.
<name>Jude</name>	Jude	Joseph	'No wonder the grass grows up between the flags, and cattle are the only hedge-cutters.' [MASK] was an elderly, nay, an old man: very old, perhaps, though hale and sinewy.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Linton	Two or three months since, were you not in the habit of writing to [MASK]? making love in play, eh? You deserved, both of you, flogging for that! You especially, the elder; and less sensitive, as it turns out.
<name>Nelly</name>	Nelly	Nelly	Let me get off my wet clothes, and I'll tell you all about it, [MASK],' he replied. I bid him beware of rousing the master, and while he undressed and I waited to put out the candle, he continued--'Cathy
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Ellen	'Well, [MASK], you won't cry about it, will you?' she exclaimed, surprised at my earnestness. 'But wait, and you shall hear if he conned his A B C to please me; and if it were worth while being civil to the brute.
<name>Nelly</name>	Nelly	Catherine	'I'm not come too soon, am I?' he said, casting a look at me: I had begun to wipe the plate, and tidy some drawers at the far end in the dresser. 'No,' answered [MASK].
<name>Mrs. Gaskell</name>	Mrs. Gaskell	Kenneth	Oh, these bleak winds and bitter northern skies, and impassable roads, and dilatory country surgeons! And oh, this dearth of the human physiognomy! and, worse than all, the terrible intimation of [MASK] that I need not expect to be out of doors till spring!
<name>Linton</name>	Linton	Linton	On the third day I took courage: at least, I couldn't bear longer suspense, and stole off once more. I went at five o'clock, and walked; fancying I might manage to creep into the house, and up to [MASK]'s room, unobserved.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Heathcliff	It's surely no great cause of alarm that [MASK] should take a moonlight saunter on the moors, or even lie too sulky to speak to us in the hay-loft. I'll engage he's lurking there. See if I don't ferret him out!'
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Cathy	The same conviction had stricken him as me, from the instant he beheld her, that there was no prospect of ultimate recovery there--she was fated, sure to die. 'Oh, [MASK]! Oh, my life! how can I bear it?'
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Catherine	'Delectably!' observed [MASK]. 'They are dove's eyes--angel's!' 'She's her brother's heir, is she not?' he asked, after a brief silence. 'I should be sorry to think so,' returned his companion.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Heathcliff	'Naught, naught,' he said, and broke away to enjoy his grief and anger in solitude. [MASK] gazed after him, and sighed. 'It will be odd if I thwart myself,' he muttered, unconscious that I was behind him. '
<name>Zillah</name>	Zillah	Zillah	I was forced to pass the front windows to get to the court: it was no use trying to conceal my presence. '"Young master is in the house," said [MASK], as she saw me making for the parlour.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Ellen	She appeared to wonder at this speech, and asked,-- 'Does [MASK] like you?' 'Yes, very well,' I replied, hesitatingly. 'You must tell her,' she continued, 'that I would answer her letter, but
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Earnshaw	I was not aware how openly I grieved, till [MASK] halted opposite, in his measured walk, and gave me a stare of newly-awakened surprise. Taking advantage of his recovered attention, I exclaimed--'I'm tired with my journey, and I want to go to bed!
<name>Helen</name>	Helen	Catherine	He followed my example, and left the room; but presently reappeared, bearing half a dozen volumes in his hands, which he threw into [MASK]'s lap, exclaiming,--'Take them! I never want to hear, or read, or think of them again!'
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Nelly	Now, don't wince, and colour up! Though it is something to see you have not white blood. Be a good lad; and I'll do for you. [MASK], if you be tired you may sit down; if not, get home again.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Catherine	The two, to a cool spectator, made a strange and fearful picture. Well might [MASK] deem that heaven would be a land of exile to her, unless with her mortal body she cast away her moral character also.
<name>Linton</name>	Linton	Linton	she returned, laughing. 'No! I tell you, I have such faith in [MASK]'s love, that I believe I might kill him, and he wouldn't wish to retaliate.' I advised her to value him the more for his affection. '
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Kenneth	You needn't laugh; for I've just crammed [MASK], head-downmost, in the Black-horse marsh; and two is the same as one--and I want to kill some of you: I shall have no rest till I do!' '
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Catherine	'Stay to rest yourself,' he replied. 'And, [MASK], don't think or say that I'm _very_ unwell: it is the heavy weather and heat that make me dull; and I walked about, before you came, a great deal for me.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Heathcliff	This spectacle drove me back immediately; I took my hat, and, after a four-miles' walk, arrived at [MASK]'s garden-gate just in time to escape the first feathery flakes of a snow-shower.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Catherine	We made a sad parting; but [MASK]'s tears were more powerful than ours. When I refused to go, and when she found her entreaties did not move me, she went lamenting to her husband and brother.
