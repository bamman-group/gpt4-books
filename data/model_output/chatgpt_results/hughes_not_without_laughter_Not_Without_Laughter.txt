Sandy	She placed them on the kitchen-table in front of [MASK], but they were no longer full and no longer hot. The com had thickened to a paste, and the potatoes were about gone; but there was still a ragged piece of steak left on the platter.
<name>Dinah</name>	Dinah	Harriett	well if you’s livin’ a-tall, de way you chillens runs round now ’days! How come you ain’t out to some party dis evenin’?” “O, there’s no party tonight,” said [MASK] laughing.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sandy	She was always worried if she didn’t know where he was. “Colored boys, when they gets round twelve an’ thirteen, they gets so bad, [MASK],” she would say. “I wants you to stay nice an’ make something out o’ yo’self.
<name>Miss Rachel</name>	Miss Rachel	Hager	Then [MASK], from her seat on the edge of the platform covering the well, broke out: “Here, madam! Stop that prancin’! Bad enough to have all this singin’ without turnin’ de yard into a show-house.”
<name>he</name>	he	Sandy	“It’s fine,” [MASK] lied, as he tried to lift it and place it on the floor as you would in coasting; but it was very heavy, and too wide for a boy to run with in his hands. You could never get a swift start.
<name>Madam</name>	Madam	George	They made no sales other than to guests of the house, but such sales were frequent. Some of the white women who used the rooms collected a commission from [MASK] for the sales they helped make to their men visitors.
<name>his mother</name>	his mother	Hager	And he couldn’t see anybody down on earth, not even [MASK]. When his mother rolled out at six o’clock to go to work, he woke up again, and while she dressed, he lay watching his breath curl mistily upwards in the cold room.
<name>Mrs. Turner</name>	Mrs. Turner	Sandy	“Whee-ee-e! . . . Hab mercy! . . . Moan it, gal!” exclamations and shouts broke loose in the understanding audience. “Just like when papa used to play for her,” said [MASK].
<name>he</name>	he	Sandy	“An old heifer!” said the first little colored girl, whispering loudly. “I’m gonna tell my mama.” But [MASK] felt like crying. And he was beginning to be ashamed of crying because he was no longer a small boy.
<name>Sloane</name>	Sloane	Benbow	And with the utmost nonchalance the drummer struck into time. “Ever’body shake!” cried [MASK], as a ribbon of laughter swirled round the hall. Couples began to sway languidly, melting together like candy in the sun as hips rotated effortlessly to the music.
<name>Bessie</name>	Bessie	Harriett	one of them shouted as [MASK] began to sashay gracefully. Finally she stopped, panting and perspiring, with her bps smiling and her eyes sparkling gaily. Then she went with the white man and the colored piano-player behind the canvas curtains to the stage.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Jimboy	[MASK], to tease the old woman, began to rock and moan like an elder in the Sanctified Church, patting both feet at the same time as he played a hymn-like, lugubrious tune with a dancing overtone: Tell me, sister.
<name>Sandy</name>	Sandy	Lawd	Ay, [MASK]! We sho did dance! . . . Well, come ’long ’bout two o’clock in de mawnin’, niggers all leavin’, an’ we goes out in de yard to git on dis hoss what we had left standin’ at de post. . . .
<name>Jody</name>	Jody	Sandy	“But don’t worry, me and [MASK]’s gonna catch you a mess o’ fish for supper today. How’s that, ma?” “Don’t need no fish,” the old woman answered. “An’ don’t come ma-in’ me!
<name>Telegrams</name>	Telegrams	Flowers	There was a crape on the door, and the shades were kept lowered, and people whispered in the house as though someone were asleep. [MASK] began to be delivered by boys on bicycles, and the lodge members came to sit up again that night.
<name>Gene</name>	Gene	Sandy	“I wish I had a brother,” [MASK] thought as he stood there. “Maybe I could talk to him about things and I wouldn’t have to think so much. It’s no fun being the only kid in the family, and your father never home either. . . .
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Sandy	[MASK] walked towards the ticket-booth to see what the prices were. “Buy me a ticket, will you?” said a feminine voice beside him. This time it was a girl—a very ugly, skinny girl, whose smile revealed a row of dirty teeth.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Jimboy	“Mooning after a worthless nigger like [MASK]. I tole you years ago he were no good, when he first come, lookin’ like he ought to be wearin’ short pants, an’ out here courtin’ you.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Sandy	“Is it that late? I’m due on bells at six o’clock. Wait a minute, [MASK], and I’ll walk up with you as far as the hotel. Boy, I’m behind time!”
<name>Dinah</name>	Dinah	Harriett	Course [MASK]’s a good girl, but she likes to be frisky—wants to run de streets ’tendin’ parties an’ dances, an’ I can’t do much with her no mo’, though I hates to say it.”
<name>he</name>	he	Sandy	The street or the porch for a few minutes of air. Then bed. And the same thing tomorrow. “I’ve got to get out of this,” [MASK] thought. “It’s an awful job.” Yet some of the fellows had been there for years.
<name>Skeeter</name>	Skeeter	Elvira	But I had to laugh.” Her friend laughed too. “He’s a hot one, taking flowers to the women already, and a white girl at that! You’ve got a fastworking son, [MASK], I must say.. . .
<name>James</name>	James	Sandy	Then, from the fifth grade on, they went with the other children, and the teachers were white. When [MASK] arrived on the school grounds with his face shining, he found the yard already full of shouting kids.
<name>he</name>	he	Jimboy	I declare I do!” And then, realizing that [MASK] had never once told her when he was leaving or for what destination, she amended her utterance. “I’ll follow him, though, as soon as he writes.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sandy	[MASK] knew that four children lived there, three boys and a girl, whom he had often watched playing on the lawn. Sometimes he wished he had a brother or sister to play with him, too, because it was very quiet in a house with only grown-ups about.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Jimboy	Working all day in the hot sun with a gang of Greeks, a man was tired at night, besides living in a box-car, where there was no place to write a letter anyway. He was a great big kid, that’s what [MASK] was, cut out for playing.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Sandy	“Listen, lad . . . you . . .” But suddenly the man was no longer beside him—for [MASK] commenced to run. On the brightly lighted avenue panic seized him. He had to escape this powdered face at his shoulder.
<name>Biff</name>	Biff	Jimboy	“Couldn’t he stay with you, mama? And then maybe we’d come back here and live, [MASK] and me, some time, when we get a little money ahead, and could pay off the mortgage on the house. . . .
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Harriett	It was [MASK], home from the country club for the afternoon, cool and slender and pretty in her black uniform with its white collar, her smooth black face and neck powdered pearly, and her crinkly hair shining with pomade.
<name>Judy</name>	Judy	Sandy	“I want to ride on the merry-go-round,” [MASK] insisted. “And go in the Crazy House.” So they did both; then they bought hamburger sandwiches with thick slices of white onion and drank strawberry soda and ate pop-corn with butter on it.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Iimboy	V. GUITAR Throw yo’ arms around me, baby, Like de circle round de sun! Baby, throw yo’ arms around me Like de circle round de sun, An’ tell yo’ pretty papa How you want yo’ lovin’ done! [MASK] was home.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Sandy	Two days before, [MASK] had come home from school and found his grandmother lying across the bed, the full tubs still standing in the kitchen, her clothes not yet hung out to dry. “What’s the matter?” he asked.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Annjee	“Gee, I’ll be glad when he comes!” [MASK] said to herself. “But if he goes off again, I’ll feel like dying in this dead old town. I ain’t never been away from here nohow.”
<name>Mamie</name>	Mamie	Maudel	She gave her nephew a plum she had brought in her pocket. “I was in town, but I didn’t have time to come home. I had to go to [MASK]’s because she’s making me a dress.”
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Sandy	Breakfast has been ready twenty minutes. I can’t come upstairs every morning to call you. You are old enough now to wake yourself and you must learn to do so—you’ve too far to walk to school to He abed.” [MASK] tumbled out.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Sandy	[MASK] noticed a certain harshness in his aunt’s voice. “Smoking so much,” she explained later. “Drinking, too, I guess. But a blues-singer’s supposed to sing deep and hoarse, so it’s all right.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sandy	Bring them clothes on out behind this stove, sir.” “Yes’m.” So with a kick of the feet his covers went flying back and [MASK] ran to the warmth of the little kitchen, where he dressed, washed, and ate.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sandy	Am with a section gang of coloreds and greeks and somehow strained my back on the Union Pacific laying ties so I will be home on Saturday. Will do my best to try and finish out weak here. Love my darling wife also kiss my son [MASK] for me.
<name>Lowdins</name>	Lowdins	John	Den de white man, what’s been drinkin’, jump up on de runnin’-bo’ad an’ bust [MASK] in de mouth fer talkin’ back to him—he a white man, an’ Lowdins nothin’ but a nigger. ‘De very idee!’
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Sandy	“What does that mean, ma—-street-walking?” the child asked, but his grandmother raised her apron to her eyes and stumbled into the house. [MASK] stopped, perplexed at the meaning of the article, at his aunts arrest, at his grandmothers horror.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Harriett	He’ll be back here now, layin’ ’round, doin’ nothin’ fo’ de rest o’ de summer, turnin’ ma house into a theatre with him an’ [MASK] singin’ their rag-time, an’ that guitar o’ his’n wangin’ ever’ evenin’! ’
<name>Bessie</name>	Bessie	Velma	“Boy, you ought to try [MASK],” a mahogany-brown boy yelled. “She sure can go.” “Hell,” answered a whisky voice somewhere in the smoke. “That nappy-headed black woman? Gimme a high yaller for mine all de time.
<name>Pap</name>	Pap	Annjee	“O, I came in with the cook and some of the boys, mama, that’s who! They hired an auto for the dance. What would be the use coming home, when you and [MASK] go to bed before dark like chickens?”
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Harriett	“Here, honey,” she said. “Take this dime and buy yourself a bottle of something cold to drink. I know [MASK] ain’t got you on her mind out there dancin’. This music is certainly righteous, chile!”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jimboy	“We got a half-dollar left for the minstrel show,” said [MASK]. “Come on, let’s go.” And he pulled his son through the crowd that jammed the long Midway between the booths.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Jimboy	“Sure,” said [MASK]. “But didn’t I tell you there wouldn’t be nothin’ runnin’ this early in the afternoon? See! Not even the band playin’, and ain’t a thing open but the freak-show
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Sandy	She was making bangs over her forehead, and the scent of scorching hair-oil drifted by [MASK]’s nose. “Up half de night in town Monday, an’ de Lawd knows how late ever’ night in de country, an’ then you comes home to run out agin! . . .
<name>Claudia</name>	Claudia	Harriett	So from that time on, [MASK] had been uncomfortable in the presence of whiteness, and that early hurt had grown with each new incident into a rancor that she could not hide and a dislike that had become pain.
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Pansetta	He wanted to be friends with [MASK] again. He wanted her to know he still liked her and wanted to walk home with her. But how could he say it? Had she seen him from the window? Maybe he could turn around and go back, and see her Monday at school.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sandy	In at the wide gates and through a vast expanse of tombstones the procession passed, across the graveyard, towards the far, lonesome comer where most of the Negroes rested. There [MASK] saw the open grave. Then he saw the casket going down . . .
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Hager	“You’re the one that says I’m not going—but I am!” Then suddenly something happened in the room—the anger fell like a veil from [MASK]’s face, disclosing aged, helpless eyes full of fear and pain.
<name>the girl</name>	the girl	Sandy	“All right then, stingy!” hissed the girl, flouncing her hips and digging into her own purse for the coins to buy a ticket. “I got money.” Some men standing on the edge of the sidewalk laughed as [MASK] went up the street.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Hager	She was always stayin’ way from home an’ settin’ up in de church, not even cookin’ his meals, an’ de chillens runnin’ ragged in de street.” “She’s a religious frantic, ain’t she?” asked [MASK]. . . .
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Hager	As for the races mixing—ask some of those high yellow women who work there. They know a mighty lot about the races mixing!” “Most of ’em lives in de Bottoms, where de sportin’ houses are,” said [MASK].
<name>Scarlet</name>	Scarlet	MUMPS	With jaws swollen to twice their normal size and a red sign, [MASK], on the house, he was forced to remain at home for three weeks. It was then that the boy began to read books other than the ones he had had to study for his lessons.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Maudel	“[MASK]? . . . Where?” The old woman had begun to wring the clothes dry and pile them in a large dish-pan. “At the Banks Hotel, chambermaid, for pretty good pay.”
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Hager	And I’m going to him!” “You what?” [MASK] gasped, dropping her spoon in her mush-bowl. “What you sayin’?” “I said I’m going to him, ma! I got to!”

<name>Dad</name>	Dad	Sandy	I have been out of work but we both got jobs now and maybe I will be able to send you some money soon. I hope you are well, ma, and all right. Kiss [MASK] for me and take care of yourself.
<name>Celie</name>	Celie	Sandy	She was taller than [MASK] now and had a regular job taking care of a white lady’s baby. She no longer wore her hair in braids. She did it up, and she had a big leather pocket-book that she carried on her arm like a woman.
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	Harriett	“I— But— But I’m with my class,” [MASK] stammered. “We’re all supposed to sit here.” “I can’t help it,” insisted the usher, pointing towards the rear of the theatre, while her voice carried everywhere.
<name>Minnie</name>	Minnie	Annjee	It’s not being black that matters with her, though, it’s being poor, and that’s what we are, you and me and [MASK], working for white folks and washing clothes and going in back doors, and taking tips and insults.
<name>the boy</name>	the boy	Sandy	“Say, lad,” it whispered smoothly, touching the boy’s arm, “listen, I got some swell French pictures up in my room—naked women and everything! Want to come up and see them?” “No,” said [MASK] quickening his pace.
<name>Sylvester</name>	Sylvester	Sandy	“Aw, tell him to cut off his curls,” retorted [MASK], but his grandmother was in no mood for fooling. “Stop talkin’ ’bout that chile’s haid and put yo’ clothes on. Nine o’clock an’ you ain’t up yet!
<name>Mammy</name>	Mammy	Hager	She’s past sixteen now, so I lets her have it. . . . Po’ little thing! . . . She does need to look purty.” [MASK]’s voice softened and her dark old face was half abashed, kind and smiling.
<name>Uncle Remus</name>	Uncle Remus	Hager	And she gave her a big dose of peppermint and water. “I spects it’s from yo’ stomick,” she said. “I knows you et cabbage fo’ dinner!” “Maybe ’tis,” said [MASK].
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Annjee	The com had thickened to a paste, and the potatoes were about gone; but there was still a ragged piece of steak left on the platter. “Don’t eat it all,” said [MASK] wamingly. “I want to take some home to your father.”
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Sandy	[MASK] looked up at him for aid, but his father’s usually amiable face was stem this time. “Come here!” he said. The man towered very tall above the little fellow who looked up at him helplessly.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sandy	said his father as he turned his pants-pockets inside out, showing the little boy a jack-knife, a half-empty sack of Bull Durham, a key, and a dime. But he smiled, and took [MASK] awkwardly in his arms and kissed him.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jimboy	”1 brought you a nice piece o’ steak, [MASK]-sugar, and some biscuits to go with it. Come on in and eat while I get dressed to go to the drill practice. I got to hurry.”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Jimboys	She could see from the little cuts on his face that he had even begun to shave on the chin. And his voice was like a mans, deep and musical as [MASK], but not so sure of itself.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Buster	There was the mingled scent of wet soil and golden pollen on the breeze that blew carelessly through the clear air. [MASK] sat under the green apple-tree with a pile of black mud from the alley in front of him.
<name>the shoeshine boy</name>	the shoeshine boy	Sandy	He turned to the men around him for approbation, while [MASK] still waited uncomfortably to be paid for the shine. But the man kept him standing there, looking at him drunkenly, then at the amused crowd of Saturday-night loungers.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Mingo	I tried to suade grandma to let her go,” the child lied, because he liked [MASK]. “I guess she won’t care about her goin’ to just one dance.” He wanted to make everydiing all right so the young man wouldn’t be worried.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Hager	Platform, steps, pillars, roof, and all had been blown away. Not a semblance of a porch was left and the front door opened bare into the yard. It was grotesque and funny. [MASK] laughed.
<name>Eddie</name>	Eddie	Charlie	When he was off duty, [MASK], the other bell-hop, sold it for him if there were any calls from the rooms above. They made no sales other than to guests of the house, but such sales were frequent.
<name>boy</name>	boy	Sandy	Can’t you read it, [MASK]?” “Sure, I can read it, but I guess they didn’t mean colored,” he answered, as the boy watched the white children going in the gate. “They wouldn’t let us in.”

<name>Bubber</name>	Bubber	Harriett	“Clowns, jazzers, just a band of dancers—that’s why they never have anything. Never be anything but servants to the white people.” Clowns! Jazzers! Band of dancers! . . . [MASK]!

<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Harriett	“Don’t you hear me?” “O, no?” said [MASK] coolly in a tone that cut like knives. “You’re the one that says I’m not going—but I am!”
<name>Mrs. Higgins</name>	Mrs. Higgins	Annjee	When [MASK] came back into the kitchen, she took four custards from the ice-box and placed them on gold-rimmed plates. “They’re about through,” she said to her son. “Sit down and I’ll fix you up.”
<name>Pa</name>	Pa	Sandy	But she was kind of pleased he had hurt it, since it would bring him home. “Ain’t you glad he’s coinin’, [MASK]?” “Sure,” answered the child, swallowing his last mouthful of pie.
<name>Jerry</name>	Jerry	Sandy	“That’s that freckled-faced yellow guy who used to play for dances around here, isn’t it? He could really beat a piano to death, all right!” “Sure could,” replied [MASK].
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Hager	[MASK] pulled a meat skin through her teeth; then she answered: “No, chile, she too young to marry yet! Ain’t but sixteen, but she’s been worldn’ out this summer, waitin’ table at de Stanton County Country Club.
<name>Bigger</name>	Bigger	Harriett	I’d get as tired of travelling all the time, as I do of running this elevator up and down day after day. . . . I’m more like [MASK]—not wanting to be a servant at the mercies of white people for ever. ...
<name>Mrs. Phelps</name>	Mrs. Phelps	Annjee	“Street-cars are slower, but I ain’t got used to them air lines yet,” said [MASK], searching her mind for something to say. “I always think maybe them elevated cars’ll fall off o’ there sometimes. They go so fast!”
<name>Jelly Roll</name>	Jelly Roll	Benbow	Does anybody know—among you high yallers, you jelly-beans, you pinks and pretty daddies, among you sealskin browns, smooth blacks, and chocolates-to-the-bone—does anybody know the answer? “Aw, play it, [MASK]!”
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Annjee	“It’s awful nice, mama!” He took off his coat and sat down on the trunk between the two windows. [MASK] came over and kissed him, rubbing her hand across his crinkly brown hair. “Well, you’re a great big boy now. . . .
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jimboy	once on ’count o’ de white unions.” “O, they’ve got us cornered, all right,” said [MASK]. “The white folks are like farmers that own all the cows and let the niggers take care of ’em.
<name>Mammy</name>	Mammy	Mingo	The perfume, the voice, and the pat, pat, pat of the powder-puff came out to the waiting gentleman. “Yo’ car’s here, madam,” mocked [MASK]. “Step right this way and let’s be going!”
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Hager	The old woman reached for the onions. “But you ain’t never raised no boys, though, has you, [MASK]?” “No, I ain’t. My two boy-chillens both died ’fore they was ten.
<name>Jay</name>	Jay	Sandy	Across the river [MASK] could make out, in the brilliant sunlight, the gold of wheat-fields and the green of trees on the hills. He wondered if it would be nice to live over there in the country. “Man alive!”
<name>Mrs. Moss</name>	Mrs. Moss	Sandy	She was a large good-natured brown-skinned girl who walked hippishly and used too much rouge on her lips. But she always gave [MASK] a dime, and she was always laughing. He went through the crowd towards the soft-drink stand at the end of the hall.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Pansetta	He ran until he was at [MASK]’s house—then came the indecision: Should he go in? Or not go in? He was ashamed of his treatment of her and embarrassed. Should he go on by as if he had not meant to call?
<name>the little boy</name>	the little boy	Sandy	But [MASK] did not move, because his young and slender aunt had gripped him firmly by the collar while she searched fever- ishly in the dresser-drawer for a scarf. She pulled it out, long and flame-colored, with fiery, silky fringe, before she released the little boy.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Sandy	[MASK] found the fifth-grade room upstairs and went in shyly. It was full of whispering youngsters huddled in little groups. He saw two colored children among them, both girls whom he didn’t know, but there were no colored boys.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jimboy	You run to some white person’s back door for every job you get, and then they pay you one dollar for five dollars’ worth of work, and fire you whenever they get ready.” “They do that all right,” said [MASK].
