<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Nanny	“Naw, [MASK], no ma’am! Is dat whut he been hangin’ round here for? He look like some ole skullhead in de grave yard.” The older woman sat bolt upright and put her feet to the floor, and thrust back the leaves from her face.
<name>Sounds</name>	Sounds	Lige	“Sho he did, [MASK]. But he didn’t mean tuh. He wuz satisfied up dere, but de mule wuzn’t. So one mornin’ he got straddle uh de mule and he took and brought ’im on off.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Joe	So she put something in there to represent the spirit like a Virgin Mary image in a church. The bed was no longer a daisy-field for her and [MASK] to play in. It was a place where she went and laid down when she was sleepy and tired.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Nanny	That was before the golden dust of pollen had beglamored his rags and her eyes. In the last stages of [MASK]’s sleep, she dreamed of voices. Voices far-off but persistent, and gradually coming nearer.
<name>Jelly</name>	Jelly	Coodemay	[MASK] wouldn’t take his off the tray like he should have. “Naw, you hold it fuh me, baby, and lemme eat,” he told the waitress. He took the fork and started to eat off the tray.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Logan	And if dat’s what you call yo’self doin’, Ah don’t thank yuh for it. Youse mad ’cause Ah’m tellin’ yuh whut you already knowed.” [MASK] dropped his shovel and made two or three clumsy steps towards the house, then stopped abruptly.
<name>Booker T. Washington</name>	Booker T. Washington	Walter	Ah’m uh educated man, Ah keeps mah arrangements in mah hands, and if it kept me up all night long studyin’ ’bout it, [MASK] ain’t liable tuh be no help to me. Ah needs uh man lak you.” “
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Janie	“Hello, [MASK], how you cornin’?” “Aw, pretty good, Ah’m tryin’ to soak some uh de tiredness and de dirt outa mah feet.” She laughed a little. “Ah see you is. Gal, you sho looks good.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Janie	“First thing, though, us got tuh eat together, [MASK]. Then we can talk.” “One thing, Ah won’t send you out after no fish.” He pinched her in the side and ignored what she said.
<name>Dee</name>	Dee	Janie	Eight or ten white women had come to look at her too. They wore good clothes and had the pinky color that comes of good food. They were nobody’s poor white folks. What need had they to leave their richness to come look on [MASK] in her overalls?
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Janie	He held it up for a joke to tease [MASK] a little. “Looka heah, Brother Mayor, whut yo’ wife done took and done.” It was cut comical, so everybody laughed at it. “Uh woman and uh knife—no kind of uh knife, don’t b’long tuhgether.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Janie	But, don’t care how firm your determination is, you can’t keep turning round in one place like a horse grinding sugar cane. So [MASK] took to sitting over the room. Sit and look. The room inside looked like the mouth of an alligator—gaped wide open to swallow something down.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Sam	It’s nature dat keeps uh man off of uh red-hot stove.” “Uuh huuh! Ah knowed you would going tuh crawl up in dat holler! But Ah aims tuh smoke yuh right out. ’Tain’t no nature at all, it’s caution, [MASK].”
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Joe	Another time she overheard him using [MASK]’s favorite expression for pointing out the differences between himself and the careless-living, mouthy town. “Ah’m an educated man. Ah keep mah arrangements in mah hands.” She laughed outright at that.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Janie	Sick headache that made him lie down for a while. He woke up hungry. [MASK] had his supper ready but by the time he walked from the bedroom to the table, he said he didn’t b’lieve he wanted a thing. “Thought you tole me you wuz hongry!”
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Janie	and it hurt me tuh mah heart tuh be ill treated lak Ah is.” The gun came up unsteadily but quickly and leveled at [MASK]’s breast. She noted that even in his delirium he took good aim. Maybe he would point to scare her, that was all.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Joe	He just stood in front of a chair and fell in it. That made her look at him all over. [MASK] wasn’t so young as he used to be. There was already something dead about him. He didn’t rear back in his knees any longer.
<name>Mr. Dark</name>	Mr. Dark	Lige	If nobody was there to speak of, nothing happened. But if the town was there like on Saturday night, [MASK] would come up with a very grave air. Couldn’t even pass the time of day, for being so busy thinking.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Grandma	Even if you is stingy as you can be wid me. Yo’ [MASK] and me myself done spoilt yuh now, and Ah reckon Ah have tuh keep on wid it.” One morning soon he called her out of the kitchen to the barn.
<name>he</name>	he	Janie	Maybe it’s better tuh stay heah in de wet than it is tuh try tuh—” He stunned the argument with half a word. “Fix,” he said and fought his way outside. He had seen more than [MASK] had.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Janie	Things that didn’t belong in water. As far as the eye could reach, water and wind playing upon it in fury. A large piece of tar-paper roofing sailed through the air and scudded along the fill until it hung against a tree. [MASK] saw it with joy.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Janie	A beating with the fist. [MASK] was halfway down the palm-lined walk before she had a thought for her safety. Maybe this strange man was up to something! But it was no place to show her fear there in the darkness between the house and the store.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Janie	[MASK] wanted to hear the rest of the play-acting and how it ended, but she got up sullenly and went inside. She came back to the porch with her bristles sticking out all over her and with dissatisfaction written all over her face.
<name>Black</name>	Black	Snakes	Some rabbits scurried through the quarters going east. Some possums slunk by and their route was definite. One or two at a time, then more. By the time the people left the fields the procession was constant. [MASK], ratdesnakes began to cross the quarters.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Jody	She had an inside and an outside now and suddenly she knew how not to mix them. She bathed and put on a fresh dress and head kerchief and went on to the store before [MASK] had time to send for her. That was a bow to the outside of things.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Janie	It was a great relief to expel the water from his mouth. He sprawled on the bed again and lay there shivering until [MASK] and the doctor arrived. The white doctor who had been around so long that he was part of the muck.
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	Joe	Then too she noticed how baggy [MASK] was getting all over. Like bags hanging from an ironing board. A little sack hung from the corners of his eyes and rested on his cheek-bones; a loose-filled bag of feathers hung from his ears and rested on his neck beneath his chin.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Janie	She had set six o’clock as her limit. At five-thirty a tall man came into the place. [MASK] was leaning on the counter making aimless pencil marks on a piece of wrapping paper. She knew she didn’t know his name, but he looked familiar.
<name>Della</name>	Della	Janie	She had wanted him to live so much and he was dead. No hour is ever eternity, but it has its right to weep. [MASK] held his head tightly to her breast and wept and thanked him wordlessly for giving her the chance for loving service.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Logan	“[MASK], you ’sleep?” “If Ah wuz, you’d be done woke me up callin’ me.” “Ah wuz thinkin’ real hard about us; about you and me.” “It’s about time.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Janie	And Ah can’t die easy thinkin’ maybe de menfolks white or black is makin’ a spit cup outa you: Have some sympathy fuh me. Put me down easy, [MASK], Ah’m a cracked plate.” There are years that ask questions and years that answer.
<name>Deborah</name>	Deborah	Janie	You don’t know dat woman uh mine. She got ninety-nine rows uh jaw teeth and git her good and mad, she’ll wade through solid rock up to her hip pockets.” “Mah [MASK] is uh high time woman and useter things.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Cake	He done taught me de maiden language all over. Wait till you see de new blue satin Tea [MASK] done picked out for me tuh stand up wid him in. High heel slippers, necklace, earrings, everything he wants tuh see me in.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Prescott	But she sat on in that trial chair until the lawyer told her she could come down. “The defense rests,” her lawyer said. Then he and [MASK] whispered together and both of them talked to the judge in secret up high there where he sat.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Jody	“Naw, [MASK], it jus’ looks lak it keeps us in some way we ain’t natural wid one ’nother. You’se always off talkin’ and fixin’ things, and Ah feels lak Ah’m jus’ markin’ time. Hope it soon gits over.”
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Lawd	You can depend on dat.” “Still and all you went off and left me all day and all night.” “’Twasn’t ’cause Ah wanted tuh stay off lak dat, and it sho [MASK], wuzn’t no woman.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Matt	Folks up dat way don’t eat biscuit bread but once uh week.” There was always a little seriousness behind the teasing of [MASK], so when he got huffed and walked on off nobody minded. He was known to buy side-meat by the slice.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Janie	Every tear you drop squeezes a cup uh blood outa mah heart. Ah got tuh try and do for you befo’ mah head is cold.” A sobbing sigh burst out of [MASK]. The old woman answered her with little soothing pats of the hand.
<name>Henderson</name>	Henderson	Davis	She was worried about his not eating his meals, till she found out he was having old lady [MASK] to cook for him. She knew that she was a much better cook than the old woman, and cleaner about the kitchen.
<name>Dilsey</name>	Dilsey	Janie	But he didn’t feel like fighting today, so he made an attack upon her position backhand. “Ah had tuh laugh at de people out dere in de woods dis mornin’, [MASK]. You can’t help but laugh at de capers they cuts.
<name>Miss Evers</name>	Miss Evers	Logan	She wasn’t even angry. [MASK] was accusing her of her mamma, her grandmama and her feelings, and she couldn’t do a thing about any of it. The sow-belly in the pan needed turning. She flipped it over and shoved it back.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Janie	But you ain’t goin’ off in all dat mess uh commonness. Ah’m surprised at yuh fuh askin’.” He wiped his lips of ham gravy and put on his hat. “Shet de door behind yuh, [MASK].
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Janie	“Don’t think Ah don’t feel wid you, [MASK], ’cause Ah do. Ah couldn’t love yuh no more if Ah had uh felt yo’ birth pains mah-self. Fact uh de matter, Ah loves yuh a whole heap
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Janie	“Yeah, Ah’m nearly forty and you’se already fifty. How come you can’t talk about dat sometimes instead of always pointin’ at me?” “T’ain’t no use in gettin’ all mad, [MASK], ’cause Ah mention you ain’t no young gal
<name>Mrs. Merriweather</name>	Mrs. Merriweather	Janie	“What you mean by dat, [MASK]?” “She was borned in slavery time when folks, dat is black folks, didn’t sit down anytime dey felt lak it. So sittin’ on porches lak de white madam looked lak uh mighty fine thing tuh her.
<name>John</name>	John	Jim	They had already seen him and they were too close to miss him if they shot. Maybe they would pass on by. Maybe when they saw he had money they would realize he was not a tramp. “Hello, there, [MASK],” the tallest one called out.
<name>Miss Brill</name>	Miss Brill	Joe	But he has plenty of competition. A pushing, shoving show of gallantry. They all beg the girls to just buy anything they can think of. Please let them pay for it. [MASK] is begged to wrap up all the candy in the store and order more.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Mouf	He’s kissin’ yo’ foot and ’tain’t in uh man tuh kiss foot long. [MASK] kissin’ is on uh equal and dat’s natural but when dey got to bow down tuh love, dey soon straightens up.” “Yes’m.”
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Jody	Then one day she sat and watched the shadow of herself going about tending store and prostrating itself before [MASK], while all the time she herself sat under a shady tree with the wind blowing through her hair and her clothes. Somebody near about making summertime out of lonesomeness.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Nanny	Then there is a depth of thought untouched by words, and deeper still a gulf of formless feelings untouched by thought. [MASK] entered this infinity of conscious pain again on her old knees. Towards morning she muttered, “Lawd, you know mah heart.
<name>Yen-lo-wang</name>	Yen-lo-wang	Janie	The icy sword of the square-toed one had cut off his breath and left his hands in a pose of agonizing protest. [MASK] gave them peace on his breast, then she studied his dead face for a long time.
<name>Cake</name>	Cake	Cake	You see dese no count niggers come in heah and break up mah place! How kin you set and see yo’ wife all trompled on? You ain’t no kinda man at all. You seen dat Tea [MASK] shove me down! Yes you did!
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Starks	But as soon as his hand closed on the money his face broke into a grin. “Beatyuh tradin’ dat time, [MASK]! Dat mule is liable tuh be dead befo’ de week is out. You won’t git no work outa him.”
<name>Zora</name>	Zora	Mistis	she clashed at me. ‘Look lak you don’t know who is [MASK] on dis plantation, Madam. But Ah aims to show you.’ “By dat time I had done managed tuh unkiwer mah baby enough for her to see de head and face.
<name>Celia</name>	Celia	Janie	There was nothing to do, after they had gathered several bushels of dried beans to save over and sell to the planters in the fall. So [MASK] began to look around and see people and things she hadn’t noticed during the season.
<name>Lucius</name>	Lucius	Starks	Out in the swamp they made great ceremony over the mule. They mocked everything human in death. [MASK] led off with a great eulogy on our departed citizen, our most distinguished citizen and the grief he left behind him, and the people loved the speech.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Joe	“No wonder things ain’t no better,” [MASK] commented. “Ah’m buyin’ in here, and buyin’ in big. Soon’s we find some place to sleep tonight us menfolks got to call people together and form a committee.
<name>Willa</name>	Willa	Jody	Before the store had a complete roof, [MASK] had canned goods piled on the floor and was selling so much he didn’t have time to go off on his talking tours. She had her first taste of presiding over it the day it was complete and finished.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Janie	G’bye.” He almost ran out of the door. [MASK] hung over the newel post thinking so long that she all but went to sleep there. However, before she went to bed she took a good look at her mouth, eyes and hair.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Lum	Anybody seen ’im?” he asked. “Seen ’im soon dis mornin’ over behind de schoolhouse,” [MASK] said. “’Bout ten o’clock or so. He musta been out all night tuh be way over dere dat early.”
<name>she</name>	she	Janie	He steadied himself against the jamb of the door and [MASK] thought to run into him and grab his arm, but she saw the quick motion of taking aim and heard the click. Saw the ferocious look in his eyes and went mad with fear as she had done in the water that time.
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Janie	He flopped over resentful in his agony and pretended sleep. He hoped that he had hurt her as she had hurt him. [MASK] got up with him the next morning and had the breakfast halfway done when he bellowed from the barn.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Jody	Holdin’ me up tuh scorn. No sympathy! ” “Naw, [MASK], it wasn’t because Ah didn’t have no sympathy. Ah had uh lavish uh dat. Ah just didn’t never git no chance tuh use none of it.
<name>Farmers</name>	Farmers	Indians	You couldn’t have a hurricane when you’re making seven and eight dollars a day picking beans. [MASK] are dumb anyhow, always were. Another night of Stew Beef making dynamic subtleties with his drum and living, sculptural, grotesques in the dance.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Janie	“So Ah thought Ah mout as well go see.” He tagged on and swallowed to kill time but [MASK] said nothing except, “Ah’ll cut de p’taters fuh yuh. When yuh cornin’ back?” “Don’t know exactly. Round dust dark
<name>he</name>	he	Janie	Where would such a man be coming from and where was he going? He didn’t look her way nor no other way except straight ahead, so [MASK] ran to the pump and jerked the handle hard while she pumped. It made a loud noise and also made her heavy hair fall down.
<name>Miss Maudie</name>	Miss Maudie	Janie	Go lay down! Ah’ll be too glad tuh be in dere wid yuh de minute de doctor say so. Go lay back down. He’ll be heah wid some new medicine right away.” “[MASK], Ah done went through everything tuh be good tuh you
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Janie	She just measured out a little time for him and set it aside to wait. It got to be terrible in the store. The more his back ached and his muscle dissolved into fat and the fat melted off his bones, the more fractious he became with [MASK].
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Janie	De boogerman liable tuh tote yuh off whilst Ah’m gone.” “’Tain’t no boogerman got me tuh study ’bout. Maybe you think Ah ain’t treatin’ yuh right and you watchin’ me.” “Naw, naw, [MASK]. Ah know better’n dat.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Janie	[MASK] had spent most of the day under a blossoming pear tree in the back-yard. She had been spending every minute that she could steal from her chores under that tree for the last three days. That was to say, ever since the first tiny bloom had opened.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Fear	Four walls squeezing her breath out. [MASK] lest he depart while she sat trembling upstairs nerved her and she was inside the room before she caught her breath. She didn’t make the cheerful, casual start that she had thought out.
<name>Everglades</name>	Everglades	tuhmorrer	“Ah naw, man. Some boys in dere now talkin’ ’bout it. Some of ’em been in de ’Glades fuh years. ’Tain’t nothin’ but uh lil blow. You’ll lose de whole day [MASK] tryin’ tuh git back out heah.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Nunkie	“Naw, never did, and you know it too. Ah didn’t want her.” “Yeah, you did.” She didn’t say this because she believed it. She wanted to hear his denial. She had to crow over the fallen [MASK].
<name>Bessie</name>	Bessie	Janie	He had done found out how rich people feel and he had a fine guitar and twelve dollars left in his pocket and all he needed now was a great big old hug and kiss from [MASK]. “You musta thought yo’ wife was powerful ugly.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Janie	“De mayor of uh town lak dis can’t lay round home too much. De place needs buildin’ up. [MASK], Ah’ll git hold uh somebody tuh help out in de store and you kin look after things whilst Ah drum up things otherwise.”
<name>Squeaky</name>	Squeaky	Janie	“Oh, Ah know you don’t talk. We ain’t shame faced. We jus’ ain’t ready tuh make no big kerflommuck as yet.” “You doin’ right not tuh talk it, but [MASK], you’se takin’ uh mighty big chance.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Janie	[MASK] began to fuss around his face where the dog had bitten him but he said it didn’t amount to anything. “He’d uh raised hell though if he had uh grabbed me uh inch higher and bit me in mah eye.
<name>Dinah</name>	Dinah	Janie	“[MASK], where’s dat last bill uh ladin’?” “It’s right dere on de nail, ain’t it?” “Naw it ain’t neither. You ain’t put it where Ah told yuh tuh.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Boss	Po’ man ain’t got no business at de show.” The very next day he burst into the room in high excitement. “[MASK] done bought out another man and want me down on de lake. He got houses fuh de first ones dat git dere.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Janie	after while,” [MASK] said archly and fixed him back in bed. It was then she felt the pistol under the pillow. It gave her a quick ugly throb, but she didn’t ask him about it since he didn’t say.
<name>Zeke</name>	Zeke	Matt	Ah ain’t after none uh y’alls foolishness now.” “Dat mule uh yourn, [MASK]. You better go see ’bout him. He’s bad off.” “Where ’bouts? Did he wade in de lake and uh alligator ketch him?”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Hicks	Most of them went along to show him the way and to be there when his bluff was called. [MASK] didn’t go far. He turned back to the house as soon as he felt he wouldn’t be missed from the crowd and mounted the porch.
<name>Bigger</name>	Bigger	Janie	Folks don’t do nothin’ down dere but make money and fun and foolishness. We must go dere.” He drifted off into sleep and [MASK] looked down on him and felt a self-crushing love. So her soul crawled out from its hiding place. 14
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Janie	Lemme know when dat ole pee-de-bed is gone and Ah’ll be right back.” Six months of wearing black passed and not one suitor had ever gained the house porch. [MASK] talked and laughed in the store at times, but never seemed to want to go further.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Lawd	[MASK], Ah know dat grassgut, liver-lipted nigger ain’t done took and beat mah baby already! Ah’ll take a stick and salivate ’im!” “No’m, he ain’t even talked ’bout hittin’ me.
<name>Uncle John</name>	Uncle John	Hicks	Soon’s we find some place to sleep tonight us menfolks got to call people together and form a committee. Then we can get things movin’ round here.” “Ah kin point yuh where yuh kin sleep,” [MASK] offered.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Janie	“It almost amounts to dat, [MASK]. He’s got almost no chance to pull through and he’s liable to bite somebody else, specially you, and then you’ll be in the same fix he’s in. It’s mighty bad.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Honey	It’s big pay day dis cornin’ Saturday at de railroad yards. Ah’m gointuh take dis twelve dollars in mah pocket and win it all back and mo’.” “How?” “[MASK], since you loose me and gimme privilege tuh tell yuh all about mahself, Ah’ll tell yuh.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Joe	They didn’t come there for that. They had come to make a welcome. So [MASK] knocked in the head of a barrel of soda crackers and cut some cheese. “Everybody come right forward and make merry. I god, it’s mah treat.”
<name>Calpurnia</name>	Calpurnia	Hezekiah	He ain’t got no business makin’ hissef familiar wid nobody lak you. Ah said Ah wuz goin’ to tell yuh so yuh could know.” “Oh dat’s all right, [MASK]. Thank yuh mighty much.”
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Janie	You oughta be glad, ’cause dat makes uh big woman outa you.” A feeling of coldness and fear took hold of her. She felt far away from things and lonely. [MASK] soon began to feel the impact of awe and envy against her sensibilities.
<name>Miss Watson</name>	Miss Watson	Janie	Had that golded-up spitting pot right handy. But he went further than that. He bought a little lady-size spitting pot for [MASK] to spit in. Had it right in the parlor with little sprigs of flowers painted all around the sides.
<name>Someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Jody	She got up that morning with the firm determination to go on in there and have a good talk with [MASK]. But she sat a long time with the walls creeping in on her. Four walls squeezing her breath out.
<name>Chicago</name>	Chicago	Miami	Yes, he had had an answer. They didn’t have any serum but they had wired [MASK] to send it. She needn’t worry. It would be there early the next morning if not before. People didn’t fool around in a case like that.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Janie	It was time to bury the dead. “[MASK], us been in dis dirty, slouchy place two days now, and dat’s too much. Us got tuh git outa dis house and outa dis man’s town. Ah never did lak round heah.”
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Janie	He meant to git dere whilst de town wuz yet a baby. He meant to buy in big. It had always been his wish and desire to be a big voice and he had to live nearly thirty years to find a chance. Where was [MASK]’s papa and mama?
<name>Mayella</name>	Mayella	Janie	Before the week was over he had whipped [MASK]. Not because her behavior justified his jealousy, but it relieved that awful fear inside him. Being able to whip her reassured him in possession. No brutal beating at all. He just slapped her around a bit to show he was boss.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Janie	“Don’t keer how big uh lie get told, somebody kin b’lieve it!” They fought on. “You done hurt mah heart, now you come wid uh lie tuh bruise mah ears! Turn go mah hands!” [MASK] seethed.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sho	But de symptoms is all there. It’s mighty bad dat it’s gone on so long. Some shots right after it happened would have fixed him right up.” “You mean he’s liable tuh die, doctah?” “[MASK] is.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Janie	Ah started to come git yuh two three times.” “Well, how come yuh didn’t come git me?” “[MASK], would you have come if Ah did?” “Sho Ah would. Ah laks fun just as good as you do.”
