<name>Apia</name>	Apia	Osovae	The woman tensed, flung back her head, and gasped loudly. [MASK] recognised her then. She was one of the young prostitutes who visited the Base every week-end. He turned and stumbled away to the fale. For the rest of the night he couldn’t sleep.
<name>Sione</name>	Sione	Lemigao	They spent a long time enjoying the cool fingers of water stabbing down at their bodies, and [MASK] insisted on turning the tap off and on to see how it worked. That same evening, straight after lotu in the main fale, they experienced the mystery of electric light.
<name>Tui</name>	Tui	Felefele	[MASK] and some of their daughters and grandchildren started to cry, but he ordered them to get out of his fale and said that from then on there would be no more lotu—he didn’t believe in that Christian nonsense any more.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Osovae	He also sent some men fishing. On the way to the plantation [MASK] wondered why his father was treating the old man in this very special way. He couldn’t think of any good reasons for his father’s behaviour but it pleased him.
<name>Tau</name>	Tau	Moaula	Like the rest of his aiga [MASK] didn’t need him any longer, but he still refused to believe that the freedom he thought he had won was only a trap from which he couldn’t escape. Of course they still needed him and he would regain their respect, he told himself.
<name>Larry</name>	Larry	Osovae	‘It was that cripple, wasn’t it? He told you to lie!’ When [MASK] still remained silent his father said, ‘I forbid you to ever see him again. Hear me, I forbid you!’
<name>Kimo</name>	Kimo	Felefele	They all looked at him. Even [MASK] forgot to continue crying. He sat up and—no longer pretending he was insane—said: ‘I don’t want to be examined by any palagi doctor.’ They all sat down and the crowd outside started to disperse.
<name>Zuko</name>	Zuko	Sau	It was late afternoon and a brisk wind was weaving in from the sea, bringing with it the familiar smell of coral, as high tide punched at the foot of the cliffs in an endless swirling smother of waves. Nearly three months had passed since [MASK]’s banishment.
<name>Sina</name>	Sina	Felefele	They were used to her many illnesses, so [MASK] bathed her in warm water and covered her with a blanket. She fell asleep and they didn’t worry about her any more. During the night she woke soaked with a cold sweat and demanded to be taken to the Malaelua medical station.
<name>Fa'amilo</name>	Fa'amilo	Osovae	The old man had brought with him a contagious feeling of generous goodwill which [MASK] had rarely seen between the elders of his aiga, and especially between his parents. Immediately after washing his hands and mouth their guest said that he was still tired and needed to rest again.
<name>Tui</name>	Tui	Osovae	Immediately after washing his hands and mouth their guest said that he was still tired and needed to rest again. While the old man slept everyone gathered in the next fale and [MASK]’s father impressed upon them that their guest was never to be left alone during the day.
<name>he</name>	he	Lemigao	He bought a tin of corned beef, which they opened with a bushknife lent to them by a nearby aiga. They shared the corned beef with the aiga. Shortly afterwards [MASK] stretched out on the grass, with his hands clasped over his well-rounded belly, and began to drift off to sleep.
<name>Mr. Kurtz</name>	Mr. Kurtz	Faleasa	[MASK] asked. ‘Anything,’ the fofo replied, ‘anything, sir!’ ‘When you discuss the case of this helpless old man with his strong aiga tell them that you failed to drive the aitu out of this old man’s entrails.’
<name>Papa</name>	Papa	Felefele	[MASK] accused him of not loving them any more but he only laughed loudly and maniacally, which frightened the children into a shrieking cacophony of tears, and told them to have their ridiculous lotu somewhere else, this fale was his and only his and nobody was to enter it without his permission.
<name>he</name>	he	Faleasa	He then said that before the next meeting it would be his cousin’s fortunate task to-visit all the other elders and persuade them to support his choice of successor. ‘But our candidate,’ his cousin managed to object before [MASK] left, ‘is too young.’
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Lemigao	The old man maintained his motionless position. So [MASK] advanced to within ten yards of him and yelled, ‘Hey, madman, wake up!’ Only the rise and fall of the old man’s chest revealed that he was alive.
<name>Tuiavii</name>	Tuiavii	Osovae	Early the next day [MASK]’s father called another council meeting, this time at the pastor’s house, and told the matai that their guest was responsible for the circles and thefts, but no one, absolutely no one, was to discourage the old man from staying.
<name>Tuiavii</name>	Tuiavii	Malaga	How often in the past had he heard the other matai joking about selling their votes to the highest bidder but he had closed his mind to such cynicism. How [MASK] must have secretly laughed at them for allowing themselves to be bought so cheaply.
<name>Tui</name>	Tui	Felefele	The children of the two factions started arguing with one another at every opportunity; the rest of their aiga, as the positions of the two main factions hardened, started choosing sides, thus leaving only [MASK] to arbitrate.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Lemigao	He stopped, and for a moment nearly went back; but, as he listened to [MASK]'s easy laughter and thought of the uncomfortable heat in the fale, he decided to go on. He paused again when he heard the high-pitched laughter of a woman and the sergeant’s deeper laughter.
<name>Tuli</name>	Tuli	Felefele	He ate hungrily, washed his mouth and hands, and then bent every plate, implement, and cup in half and threw them out on to the paepae. From the kitchen fale he heard [MASK]’s muffled cursing when the women showed her the damaged implements and utensils.
<name>Tauilo</name>	Tauilo	Lemigao	Every Sunday afternoon the Malaelua pastor visited them and they prayed together. Then [MASK] sought the services of healers who were reputed to be able to cure supernatural maladies. These healers too he brought to the ward secretly at night. They too proved ineffective.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Lemigao	Now they had to accept that deformities such as [MASK]’s crooked leg were attractive and even beautiful to some women. As was the custom, a man could take a woman and live with her as his wife without being formally married in either the church or the registry office.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Lemigao	‘Crooked-leg!’ he cursed his friend under his breath. When he returned he found to his dismay that [MASK] had put the pig in one of the large coconut-frond baskets they had brought with them and thrust his wooden yoke through the top of the basket.
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Moaula	He also heard his quicktempered youngest son, [MASK], who was in his late thirties and married to a sullen woman, exclaim: The ungrateful old fool. I should go and knock the insanity out of his head!’
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Osovae	The missionary wore a white jacket and trousers, a white shirt and black tie, and black shoes as shiny as wet river boulders. Perched on his nose was a pair of black-rimmed spectacles. [MASK] promised himself that one day he would own a suit as handsome as the missionary’s.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Manutagi	His father then explained that [MASK] had wasted his life, had been a good-for-nothing weakling who had even allowed two other.men to elope with his two wives. ‘One of these women was my mother,’ his father added.
<name>he</name>	he	Lemigao	Their mouths watered as they watched. ‘Do you want anything?’ asked the man, who exuded a strong smell of dried sweat. Again [MASK] was the first to venture into the unknown. ‘Two of those,’ he replied, pointing at the ice-cream.
<name>rhetoric</name>	rhetoric	Samoan	As he moved through the villages his ability in [MASK] became respected by even the most famous orators. He was trying to find his true soul, he would tell his hosts, but when they asked him to explain further he would talk of something else.
<name>Frank Abagnale</name>	Frank Abagnale	Malaga	‘[MASK] never attended that night school he’s always talking about. He doesn't have the educational qualifications he claims he has. He spent most of his time living off a series of women.' Paused. And then said emphatically, ‘And he was deported back here.
<name>Fa'afafine</name>	Fa'afafine	Felefele	Hence when he failed with [MASK] he blamed her. One Saturday morning, after another frustrating night of trying, he went with her into their plantation on the pretext of getting foodstuffs for their aiga’s Sunday umu. Once hidden in a clump of trees he instructed her to use her mouth on him.
<name>Mulan</name>	Mulan	Malaga	‘Yes, I am well again. And just in time too.’ Sitting up, [MASK] asked, ‘Is my father anticipating trouble in our village?’ ‘Nothing that I can’t solve now that I am well again.'
<name>Leif</name>	Leif	Osovae	[MASK]’s father organised and led the trip. Many of the elders and some of their wives went, and the strongest rowers were picked for the arduous journey, which took them nearly three days. At night they rested in villages along the way.
<name>He</name>	He	Faleasa	some of the most influential elders suggested. [MASK] pondered quickly and decided it wouldn’t be wise to lose their support, not yet anyway, so he said, ‘You have a week to think about a successor. We'll meet again and decide then.’
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Osovae	He never refused any offer of food even if he had just eaten a large meal. He needed to eat a lot, he was fond of telling [MASK], to be able to carry his ‘burden’ (as he called his club-foot) around with him.
<name>Aunt Ada Doom</name>	Aunt Ada Doom	Felefele	He deliberately didn't find the local station but turned up the volume and let the radio buzz and crackle as he tapped his hand on his knee to an imaginary tune. As he had expected, [MASK] was oblivious of everything but the huge helpings of food on her foodmat.
<name>George</name>	George	Faleasa	The large hunk of coral near his feet burst into tiny fragments. Don’t make me do it! [MASK] kept saying to himself as he reloaded the shotgun. Give in, please! Don’t make me kill you!
<name>Doodle</name>	Doodle	Moaula	I should go and knock the insanity out of his head!’ (He wouldn’t dare of course because assaulting one’s parent was taboo.) [MASK] was his favourite son; he possessed much courage, a quality sadly lacking in all his other.,children.
<name>Santiago</name>	Santiago	Osovae	In the morning [MASK] woke before anyone else and found a light mist of rain swirling round outside. He quietly picked his way across the fale and peered through the curtain. The old man wasn’t in his net; only his blanket lay there like a skin which he had shed.
<name>Tui</name>	Tui	Osovae	‘Both of them haven’t got hairs yet, and one’s badly in need of a new leg!' ‘With a burden like that he hasn’t got a hope of catching a pig!' remarked another matai. Most of the matai, even [MASK]’s father, were laughing by then.
<name>Unknown</name>	Unknown	Lemigao	She parted her legs, held the back of his head roughly, pushed his face between her thighs, and then moved her hips in a circular motion while she made a low continuous moaning sound. [MASK], who was now on his knees, watched and clapped out the rhythm again.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Lemigao	As they walked along the ward [MASK] sensed that all the nurses and patients were observing them as if some unbearable tragedy had befallen them already; he would never forget how their eyes flicked away from him in one quick darting movement when he looked at them.
<name>Crooked-leg</name>	Crooked-leg	Osovae	After what happened next [MASK] never again believed that Crooked-leg couldn’t move as swiftly as other boys, bang! Pain exploded in his head and his ears rang as he toppled to his knees. Then more fists jabbed at his head and he was on his back and crying.
<name>Matua</name>	Matua	Osovae	[MASK] watched him. No one offered his father consolation, so he ran out of the fale, stopped on the edge of the paepae, yelled back to his aiga to get up and search for his guest, and then rushed down towards the centre of the village.
<name>Tui</name>	Tui	Osovae	They tied the fautasi to the jetty, and the passengers disembarked. The cargo of copra, bananas, and taro was unloaded, and [MASK]’s father told most of the crew to go with him and carry the copra to a nearby trading store.
<name>no one</name>	no one	Osovae	He then spat a thick gob of phlegm out of the fale, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, blinked repeatedly, and explained that memory that wouldn't leave him alone. Did [MASK] know that his type of memory could devour a person bit by bit, bone by bone?
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Povave	‘I... I love him. I love you too!’ ‘We love him!’ cried [MASK]. ‘How can you accuse us of such a sin ?’ She began weeping too and beating at her knees with clenched fists.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Malaga	‘Is there going to be a ballot?’ [MASK] asked. ‘Not very likely; but, if we find that a ballot is the best way to bring our opponents into the open, then we’ll have a ballot. It will show who voted for who.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Felefele	Do you realise who that spirit was?’ he asked rhetorically. Paused. ‘My mother. And she claims that my illness is more or less permanent and I am to die soon.’ [MASK]’s weeping immediately grew louder.
<name>Sanchez</name>	Sanchez	Osovae	(Nothing was said about the old man’s fit of insanity the previous afternoon.) [MASK] noticed that their guest looked much younger now that his hair had been trimmed and combed and his beard shaven and clean clothes hid his scarred body.
<name>Wang</name>	Wang	Osovae	The next morning, to their desperate amazement, three more circles were found in front of three other homes, from each of which one item had been stolen. The old man insisted on playing suipi every afternoon and he always let [MASK] win.
<name>George</name>	George	Lemigao	No one in sight yet. ‘Well, who’s going to find out?’ repeated [MASK], massaging the animal’s ribs. ‘It’ll be a sad waste if we don’t make use of it. After all I didn’t mean to kill it.’
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Laaumatua	If he’s pretending to be what he isn't I’ll know.’ Just before they returned to the village [MASK] picked up a stone, brushed the dirt off it, scrutinised the veins in it for a moment, and then lobbed it out over the edge of the cliff.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Faleasa	Now, as [MASK] thought about it, he admitted that he hadn’t felt sad at all when his father died; indeed, he had felt as though a fist in which he was imprisoned had unclenched to set him free. He picked at the memories, encouraging them to bleed.
<name>the father</name>	the father	Lemigao	The nurse interpreted for the doctor. Had their son been ill before? Had he suffered any serious accidents? Had there been any cases of serious illness in either of their aiga? To each question [MASK] shook his head.
<name>Tuilaepa</name>	Tuilaepa	Osovae	When more circles appeared the next morning and caused vividly horrible rumours of destruction to scuttle through the village, [MASK]’s father summoned a council meeting and also instructed the pastor to preach against the existence of aitu and to label belief in them as heresy.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Osovae	‘Really beautiful, really beautiful,’ he murmured, licking his lips and gazing at the remainder of his ice-cream. [MASK]’s tongue stabbed out quickly and tasted the sweet running coldness; he nodded his head and bit into the white succulence.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Lemigao	He escaped into the darkness behind their fale, squatted down, and, while he defecated uncontrollably, cried softly. ‘Crooked-leg! Crooked-leg!' he cursed [MASK], as he cried up into the few stars blinking in the sky’s black hide.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Moaula	He looked at the children. Not one of them was bold enough to look at him. He pointed at [MASK]'s eight-year-old son, who smiled victoriously, marched over, brought the transistor radio, and placed it in front of him.
<name>Tama</name>	Tama	Osovae	All the elders and most of the older untitled men went to sleep not long after their meal. But before sleeping [MASK]’s father sent for him, ordered him to stop setting such a bad example to the other young men, and said they were to make a big umu for the evening meal.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Osovae	‘Why does he want to try to ruin everything?’ ‘You'd better think of something to get us out of this,’ [MASK] cautioned him. ‘You ate a lot of the pork too!’ ‘But you killed the pig!’
<name>Rosen</name>	Rosen	Solimanava	There is a better way. We’ll just observe them, wait them out. I’ll continue to pretend I’m insane, you continue to pretend I’m insane, and we’ll watch them closely. Tell [MASK] our plan but no one else.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Lemigao	They looked about quickly; [MASK] discovered the ice-cream counter first and pointed to it. Moving up to the counter through a thick line of customers, they stopped for a minute and watched the middle-aged man behind the counter.
<name>Alii Nui</name>	Alii Nui	Malaelua	‘If I had a father, especially a father like yours, who was [MASK]’s leading alii, I’d go to him and confess everything, and my father—like all good fathers who love and protect their children—would save us from our village’s wrath.’
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Solimanava	He glared and then pointed at [MASK], who— head held up proudly—brought them. He thanked her with a curt nod, and a wink which none of the others saw. When he finished drying his hands there was another scramble to retrieve the basin and towel.
<name>Draco</name>	Draco	Felefele	‘Feel the poison eating into your greedy stomachs and intestines?’ ‘He’s lying,’ [MASK] said apologetically. ‘Please excuse his behaviour; he doesn’t know what he’s saying.' ‘Get out!’
<name>he</name>	he	Faleasa	At first the gogo was a silver speck floating lazily in the brilliant sky; then, as [MASK] watched it, his breath propping it up in the still air, it dropped lower and lower until it was a luminous humming of outstretched wings circling above the heads of the trees he was standing under.
<name>He</name>	He	Faleasa	‘He may query the new leadership we’ve established.' ‘He won’t. I made him our MP. He’ll support us.’ [MASK] paused and then added, ‘He’s a good man as well.’
<name>someone</name>	someone	Filemoni	The wretches, like his aiga, had used him all these years. What a naive, gullible person he must have been. ‘As another human being in need of our help we must help him,’ [MASK] said. ‘But how?’
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Faleasa	No one else was eating. No one spoke; even the children, who were by then all afraid of him, tried to keep still. Everyone tried not to look at him but [MASK] occasionally caught some of the adults glancing at him with concern.
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Vaipaia	[MASK]’s insatiable dissatisfaction with everything became mirrored in her physical appearance. As she aged, her flesh and skin shrank tightly around her skeleton, strangling it, until she was a wizened, toothless gnome, her face a wrinkled fist of bitterness, her rheumy eyes clouded with cataracts.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Faleasa	When they saw he was watching they lowered the fale blinds. [MASK] rested his cunning head on his ali and smiled triumphantly. That evening after he had bathed in the pool he returned home to find that his fale had been tidied and his aiga were gathered in it ready for their evening lotu.
<name>someone</name> (There is no specific name given in the passage)	someone (There is no specific name given in the passage)	Tapu	Her aiga restrained her and brought her back into the fale where she wailed loudly, claiming that no one in her aiga cared enough for her good name and the good name of their aiga to avenge the insult which [MASK]’s aiga had so cruelly inflicted on her.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Sau	[MASK] erased it with his next remarks: ‘We all know, he’s always been slightly odd, arrogant, and too dictatorial—mind you, that doesn’t mean I disliked him. But that’s why this tragedy has happened to him.
<name>Tulifau</name>	Tulifau	Osovae	a matai called to [MASK]’s father. ‘Both of them haven’t got hairs yet, and one’s badly in need of a new leg!' ‘With a burden like that he hasn’t got a hope of catching a pig!' remarked another matai.
<name>Tama</name>	Tama	Osovae	When [MASK] was alone he sat down and gazed into the emptiness which the old man had once filled. He could hear people coming out of the neighbouring fale and joining in the futile search. His mother was the first to return from the search and to find the circle of pebbles in front of their fale.
<name>the son</name>	the son	Lemigao	Paused. And then, to excuse his fear of his father, added: ‘My aiga will also suffer from the disgrace.’ ‘So you’re saying we should keep it hidden?’ [MASK] said. ‘No, but...’ ‘But what?’
<name>he</name>	he	Osovae	Just look at all this meat!’ Sensing that his friend’s appetite was as usual getting the better of him, [MASK] said, ‘No, we’re not going to eat it. If someone finds out we’ll be in serious trouble.’
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Osovae	On this particular afternoon, while they were playing at the side of the fale where the old man slept, [MASK] glanced up at the fale dome and down at his cards again, refusing to believe what he had seen.
<name>La'ei</name>	La'ei	Faleasa	Even their aiga’s children were afraid of her. [MASK] ended by resenting her appearance: he was ashamed to have so ugly a woman for his mother. He washed his face with handfuls of water, climbed to the bank, and sat in the sun to dry himself.
<name>Rooster</name>	Rooster	Malaga	The shotgun roared again and he shuddered momentarily. The row of blinds immediately to his right exploded into scattering fragments and smoke. ‘You’re forcing me to kill you!’ [MASK] called. ‘That’s what you came here to do, so do it.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Faleasa	[MASK] reached out and tugged him down again. ‘No, violence won’t solve anything. There is a better way. We’ll just observe them, wait them out. I’ll continue to pretend I’m insane, you continue to pretend I’m insane, and we’ll watch them closely.
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Sau	Still the monster thrived, rampaging freely through the imaginations of young and old alike, so that [MASK], who by then was really looking his age, dared the council to accuse him openly. When no one did so he claimed that this was overwhelming proof of his innocence.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Faleasa	(Later, when they tried to be friends again, they found they couldn’t.) As [MASK] left the meeting he glanced up at the sky and, as he recreated in his mind the flight of the dazzling gogo he had watched a few days before, he hummed to himself.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Mose	During the two-hour bus trip they didn’t speak; they were even too frightened to look at the student who was sitting across the aisle from them. Just as the bus was turning into the depot beside the town market the student told them that [MASK] had been taken to the hospital the evening before.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Felefele	[MASK] and his daughters were weeping quietly by the end of his speech. Before any of the elders could reply he remembered, and said, ‘While I was ill the spirit who inhabited me—yes, it was a spirit—advised me to relinquish all my worldly responsibilities.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Osovae	Next the missionary shaved with a silver razor and hand-mirror that sparkled in the morning light. He then returned to the house, with [MASK] envying him. The pastor’s school assembled in his house at midmorning to perform for the missionary party.
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	Malaga	So he sat in silence and enjoyed their discomfort. Before long the pickup truck scrunched up the driveway, screeched to a dust-coughing halt before the front door, and [MASK] was out of it and puffing into the sitting room.
<name>Fa'asamoa</name>	Fa'asamoa	Moaula	After all, they were his daughters; they, like [MASK], deserved some worth-while inheritance from him; he was to die soon, he had to show them his alofa; he couldn’t die despising some of the fruit of his own flesh.
<name>Mr. Bingley</name>	Mr. Bingley	Solimanava	He thanked her with a curt nod, and a wink which none of the others saw. When he finished drying his hands there was another scramble to retrieve the basin and towel. He glared at everyone again and pointed at one of [MASK]'s daughters.
<name>Mr. Norton</name>	Mr. Norton	Lemigao	But no one knew where the essay was. Perhaps a clue to his illness lay in that essay. Next morning [MASK] went to the college and got permission to search for the essay in his son’s possessions in the dormitory.
<name>the nurse</name>	the nurse	Solimanava	He pointed at the centre of the fale and they strung up the net there, spread out his sleeping mats, put his ali at the head of the mats, and crept out of the fale. ‘Thank you,’ he said to [MASK] in his most un-insane voice.
<name>Captain Hook</name>	Captain Hook	Filemoni	He had discovered that silence was another effective weapon he could use against them. So, while he lay in his net, waiting for [MASK] and his cohorts to arrive, he rehearsed how he would use that silence.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Osovae	Extending his sticklike arms towards the sky, with his fingers like threatening claws, the old man threw back his head, gazed into the fierce light, and opened his mouth as if he was screaming in terrifying soundless pain. He maintained this posture in absolute stillness until [MASK] had counted to twenty.
<name>One</name>	One	Crooked	Pain exploded in his head and his ears rang as he toppled to his knees. Then more fists jabbed at his head and he was on his back and crying. ‘Don’t ever call me that again!’ [MASK]-leg threatened him.
<name>he</name>	he	Manutagi	But, after his wife—a young buxom girl who needed more satisfying than [MASK] could give her—left him, he started to neglect everything, especially his physical appearance, and to cultivate imaginary illnesses in order to justify his disintegration as a man, his downward transformation into a coward.
<name>Louis</name>	Louis	Osovae	He ate and ate. ‘I hated and despised him,’ [MASK]’s father said. ‘As I watched him deliberately suffering I told myself that a man who could accept all that punishment and demand more was either insane or utterly fearless.’
<name>Em</name>	Em	Elefane	The rest of their aiga and many of their neighbours were now gathered on the paepae, ready to stop them from assaulting each other. ‘You have no right to speak to me that way—Em your older brother!’ [MASK] shouted, his arms akimbo.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Vaipaia	His aiga would not bury [MASK] until he returned from his trek upriver. He took off his lavalava, placed it on the boulder, and waded into the stream until the water was up to his armpits; then he lay back and floated in the almost stationary current.
<name>Lemigao</name>	Lemigao	Laaumatua	Instead of being born a healthy screaming child and during a thunderstorm, [MASK] whimpered club-footedly into the glaring, painful light of midday and the anger of his disgraced aiga, who immediately branded him with the name -Lemigao^—With- who had three .out
