<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jones	[MASK] contented himself however with a negative punishment, and walked off with his new comrades, leaving the guide to the poor revenge of cursing and reviling him; in which latter the landlord joined, saying, “Ay, ay, he is a pure one, I warrant you.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Jones	If he did, however, he had the good fortune to miss his man. [MASK] seeing the fellow fall, guessed the cause of his fright, at which he could not forbear smiling, not in the least reflecting on the danger from which he had just escaped.
<name>Mrs. Western</name>	Mrs. Western	Allworthy	I am very considerably altered since that day when you so kindly gave me that advice, which I had been happy had I followed.” “Indeed, madam,” cries [MASK], “it gave me great concern when I first heard the contrary.”
<name>mother</name>	mother	Sophia	You, my [MASK], was always my superior in everything, and I heartily hope you will be so in your fortune. I shall never forget the wise and matronly advice you once gave me, when I lamented being disappointed of a ball, though you could not be then fourteen years
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Sophia	She immediately repaired to [MASK]'s apartment, who was now, after a day's confinement, released again from her captivity. BOOK VII. CONTAINING THREE DAYS. Chapter i. A comparison between the world and the stage.
<name>Shepton-Beauchamp</name>	Shepton-Beauchamp	Mark	The gentleman then, without any farther preface, began as you may read in the next chapter. Chapter xi. In which the Man of the Hill begins to relate his history. “I was born in a village of Somersetshire, called [MASK], in the year 1657.
<name>Becky</name>	Becky	Jones	“Don't you remember putting your hands in my lady's muff once? I vow I could almost find in my heart to tell, if I was certain my lady would never come to the hearing on't.” [MASK] then made several solemn protestations.
<name>Squire</name>	Squire	Jones	”--“Well,” cries [MASK], “be that as it will, it shall be your own fault, as I have promised you, if you ever hear any more of this adventure. Behave kindly to the girl, and I will never open my lips concerning the matter to any one.
<name>Sir William Blackstone</name>	Sir William Blackstone	Jones	The king then proceeded to express some wonder that there was no such punishment as shame in other governments. Upon which [MASK] assured him to the contrary; for that there were many crimes for which shame was inflicted by the English laws, and that it was indeed one consequence of all punishment.
<name>Tom Jones</name>	Tom Jones	Jones	The tenderness of lovers can ill brook the least jesting with the names of their mistresses. However, [MASK], though he had enough of the lover and of the heroe too in his disposition, did not resent these slanders as hastily as, perhaps, he ought to have done.
<name>Tom Smart</name>	Tom Smart	Partridge	The good people now ranged themselves round the kitchen fire, where good humour seemed to maintain an absolute dominion; and [MASK] not only forgot his shameful defeat, but converted hunger into thirst, and soon became extremely facetious.
<name>Belinda</name>	Belinda	Sophia	Ha! have I not reason to think there is another?--one whose value is above that of the whole world!--I may, I must imagine my [MASK] is not indifferent to what becomes of me. Shall I then leave this only friend--and such a friend?
<name>Sophia</name>	Sophia	Nancy	`Upon my word, madam,' says I, `I know nothing of the matter.' `Then,' says she, turning to her daughter [MASK], says she, `as sure as tenpence this is the very young gentleman, and he agrees exactly with the squire's description.'
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Jones	“Sir,” answered [MASK], “I honour you every moment more and more. To be so easily satisfied, so very moderate on that account, is a proof of the soundness of your understanding, as well as the nobleness of your mind.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jones	The lady presently after quitted the masquerade, and [MASK], notwithstanding the severe prohibition he had received, presumed to attend her. He was now reduced to the same dilemma we have mentioned before, namely, the want of a shilling, and could not relieve it by borrowing as before.
<name>Sally</name>	Sally	Susan	Such prevalence had money in this family; and though the mistress would have turned away her maid for a corrupt hussy, if she had known as much as the reader, yet she was no more proof against corruption herself than poor [MASK] had been.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Partridge	[MASK] immediately declared it was the finest place he had ever been in. When the first music was played, he said, “It was a wonder how so many fiddlers could play at one time, without putting one another out.”
<name>Jerry</name>	Jerry	Jones	“Ay, an acquaintance,” repeated [MASK], “and an honoured acquaintance too. When I do not love and honour the man who dares venture everything to preserve his wife and children from instant destruction, may I have a friend capable of disowning me in adversity!”
<name>Werther</name>	Werther	Nightingale	“As eagerly as I would pursue my happiness,” answered [MASK]: “for I never shall find it in any other woman.--O, my dear friend! could you imagine what I have felt within these twelve hours for my poor girl, I am convinced she would not engross all your pity.
<name>Fanny</name>	Fanny	Graveairs	[MASK], I despise all such slander. No such malice, I assure you, ever gave me an uneasy moment. No, no, I promise you I am above all that.--But where was I? O let me see, I told you my husband was jealous--
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Sophia	but he still kept his hands in it: and then he kissed it--to be sure I hardly ever saw such a kiss in my life as he gave it.”--“I suppose he did not know it was mine,” replied [MASK].
<name>him</name>	him	Jones	He had likewise, as we have observed, omitted many material facts in his present relation. Upon the whole, indeed, everything now appeared in such favourable colours to [MASK], that malice itself would have found it no easy matter to fix any blame upon him.
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Benjamin	“Nay, be not angry,” said [MASK], “for I promise you I am not. You are perfectly innocent of having intended me any wrong; for you was then an infant: but I shall, I believe, unriddle all this the moment
<name>lover</name>	lover	Sophia	”--“I know all, my [MASK],” answered he; “your cruel father hath told me all, and he himself hath sent me hither to you.”--“My father sent you to me!” replied she: “sure you dream.
<name>Shakespeare</name>	Shakespeare	Lud	Who's fool then? Will you? [MASK] have mercy upon such fool-hardiness!--Whatever happens, it is good enough for you.----Follow you? I'd follow the devil as soon. Nay, perhaps it is the devil----for they say he can put on what likeness he pleases.--Oh!
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Jones	One remark, however, I cannot forbear making on her narrative, namely, that she made no more mention of [MASK], from the beginning to the end, than if there had been no such person alive. This I will neither endeavour to account for nor to excuse.
<name>Tristram</name>	Tristram	Hurlothrumbo	Thus the famous author of [MASK] told a learned bishop, that the reason his lordship could not taste the excellence of his piece was, that he did not read it with a fiddle in his hand; which instrument he himself had always had in his own, when he composed it.
<name>Imogen</name>	Imogen	Sophia	It is that thought which gives me resolution to bid you fly from me for ever, and avoid your own destruction.”--“I fear no destruction,” cries he, “but the loss of [MASK]. If you would save me from the most bitter agonies, recall that cruel sentence.
<name>Aunt Norris</name>	Aunt Norris	Allworthy	And are your eyes opened to him at last? And shall I live to see him as happy as he deserves?” “He certainly is my nephew,” says [MASK], “and I hope all the rest.
<name>God</name>	God	George	Did she not, after he was recovered, turn pale again the moment we came up to that part of the field where he stood? And pray what else should be the occasion of all her melancholy that night at supper, the next morning, and indeed ever since?”--“'Fore [MASK]!”
<name>Lady Sneerwell</name>	Lady Sneerwell	Sophia	“Then, madam,” cries his lordship, “I must make the best use of this moment; for I cannot live, nor will I live without you.”----“What do you mean, my lord?” said [MASK]; “I will raise the family.”
<name>him</name>	him	Jones	accident hath happened to me, indeed,” says she, “and I am highly obliged to this gentleman” (pointing to [MASK]) “that it was not a fatal one, or that I am now living to mention it.”--“Whatever
<name>Hippolyta</name>	Hippolyta	Thalestris	This she spoke with so commanding an air, standing with her back to the fire, with one hand behind her, and a pinch of snuff in the other, that I question whether [MASK], at the head of her Amazons, ever made a more tremendous figure.
<name>Squire Allworthy</name>	Squire Allworthy	Jones	The idea of a marriage between [MASK] and his daughter, had never once entered into the squire's head, either in the warmest minutes of his affection towards that young man, or from suspicion, or on any other occasion.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Sophia	The superior merit of [MASK] totally eclipsed, or rather extinguished, all the beauties of the poor girl; but compassion instead of contempt succeeded to love. He was convinced the girl had placed all her affections, and all her prospect of future happiness, in him only.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Jones	Indeed I did not listen, but I was obliged to stay in the outward room. I am sure I wish I had been a hundred miles off, rather than have heard what I have heard.” “Why, what is the matter?” said [MASK].
<name>Sophia</name>	Sophia	Jones	In a word, she soon triumphed over all the virtuous resolutions of [MASK]; for though she behaved at last with all decent reluctance, yet I rather chuse to attribute the triumph to her, since, in fact, it was her design which succeeded.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Betty	“[MASK],” says she, “you are certainly in the right: he is a very pretty fellow, and I don't wonder that my cousin's maid should tell you so many women are fond of him.
<name>the maid</name>	the maid	Honour	I will find him out, and have you discharged this moment.”--“Discharged!” cries [MASK]; “and suppose I am: there are more places in the world than one. Thank Heaven, good servants need not want places; and if you turn away all who do not
<name>Chloe</name>	Chloe	Sophia	Awaken therefore that gentle passion in every swain: for lo! adorned with all the charms in which nature can array her; bedecked with beauty, youth, sprightliness, innocence, modesty, and tenderness, breathing sweetness from her rosy lips, and darting brightness from her sparkling eyes, the lovely [MASK] comes!
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Fortune	Thus [MASK], after having diverted herself, according to custom, with two or three frolicks, at last disposed all matters to the advantage of our heroine; who indeed succeeded admirably well in her deceit, considering it was the first she had ever practised.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Allworthy	“By all this preparation I am to guess that she was a relation of mine,” cried he. “Indeed she was a near one.” At which words [MASK] started, and she continued--“You had a sister, sir.” “A sister!”
<name>Hannah</name>	Hannah	Sophia	At repeating which words he clinched his fist, knit his brows, bit his lips, and thundered so loud, that the poor afflicted, terrified [MASK] sunk trembling into her chair, and, had not a flood of tears come immediately to her relief, perhaps worse had followed.
<name>Nancy</name>	Nancy	Partridge	Have you not betrayed my honour to her?”--Jones fell upon his knees, and began to utter the most violent protestations, when [MASK] came dancing and capering into the room, like one drunk with joy, crying out, “She's found!
<name>Mr. Bingley</name>	Mr. Bingley	Sophia	She eagerly longed to see a place in which she fancied charms short only of those which a raptured saint imagines in heaven. In the next place, as she knew [MASK] to have much more generosity than her master, so her fidelity promised her a greater reward than she could gain by treachery.
<name>Fanny</name>	Fanny	Sophia	cries the squire; “all stuff and nonsense; all maidenish tricks. Kill you, indeed! Will marriage kill you?”--“Oh! sir,” answered [MASK], “such a marriage is worse than death. He is not even indifferent; I hate and detest him.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Jones	Besides, I am grown weary of this part of the town. I want to be nearer the places of diversion; so I am going to Pall-mall.” “And do you intend to make a secret of your going away?” said [MASK].
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sophia	I suppose if she dies to-morrow, she will leave it to somebody else, and perhaps out of the vamily.”--“My aunt, sir,” cries [MASK], “hath very violent passions, and I can't answer what she may do under their influence.”
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Jones	Stay below stairs, I desire you.” But [MASK] at that instant thundered from above, “Let the lady come up,” in so authoritative a voice, that the good man instantly withdrew his hands, and the lady made the best of her way to the chamber.
<name>Mr. Collins</name>	Mr. Collins	Sophia	”--“Yes, madam,” said [MASK]; “but you have had very great proposals from men of vast fortunes. It was not the first, nor the second, nor the third advantageous match that offered itself.” “I own it was not,” said she.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Allworthy	Thus did the affection of [MASK] for his nephew betray the superior understanding to be triumphed over by the inferior; and thus is the prudence of the best of heads often defeated by the tenderness of the best of hearts.
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Partridge	“I think I have sufficiently warmed myself,” answered the lady; “so, if you please, I will go now; I am afraid I have kept people, and particularly that gentleman (meaning [MASK]), too long in the cold already.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Allworthy	I never heard better news in my life--I warrant everything goes to my mind.--Do, prithee, dear [MASK], come and dine with me at the Hercules Pillars: I have bespoke a shoulder of mutton roasted, and a spare-rib of pork, and a fowl and egg-sauce.
<name>Sophia</name>	Sophia	Jones	mother; that's all; she was a little hungry, it seems, and so sat down to dinner before grace was said; and so there is a child coming for the Foundling Hospital.”----“Prithee, leave thy stupid jesting,” cries [MASK].
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Sophia	Containing much clearer matters; but which flowed from the same fountain with those in the preceding chapter. The reader will be pleased, I believe, to return with me to [MASK]. She passed the night, after we saw her last, in no very agreeable manner.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jones	sir,” answered [MASK], “it is as possible for a man to know something without having been at school, as it is to have been at school and to know nothing.” “Well said, young volunteer,” cries the lieutenant.
<name>He</name>	He	Allworthy	[MASK] stared at all this, and declared he was a stranger to every word she said. “Yes, sir,” answered she, “I believe you are.----It is a very different story, I believe, from what those fellows told this lawyer.”
<name>Mrs. Gummidge</name>	Mrs. Gummidge	Bell	“Not as a husband,” said the lady; “I am not married, I promise you, my dear. You know, [MASK], I have tried the comforts once already; and once, I think, is enough for any reasonable woman.”
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Sophia	(for he had not well understood the phrase used by [MASK] of being about her person). “I suppose it is to be under the cook; but I shan't wash dishes for anybody. My gentleman will provide better for me.
<name>Mr. Collins</name>	Mr. Collins	Allworthy	“I am sorry, madam,” said [MASK], “you made so ill a use of your learning. Indeed, it would have been well that you had been possessed of much more, or had remained in a state of ignorance.
<name>the audience</name>	the audience	Nature	None, as I remember, have at all considered the audience at this great drama. But as [MASK] often exhibits some of her best performances to a very full house, so will the behaviour of her spectators no less admit the above-mentioned comparison than that of her actors.
<name>Mr. William Collins</name>	Mr. William Collins	Jones	”--“I do assure you, madam,” said [MASK], “the lady who was here last night, and who staid the latest (for the other only brought me a letter), is a woman of very great fashion, and my near relation.
<name>he</name>	he	Jones	In fact, his behaviour was so different from that of the persons there mentioned, that we chose not to confound his name with theirs. When the good man had ended his speech, [MASK] was the last who deserted the room.
<name>Fanny</name>	Fanny	Jenny	[MASK] replied to this with a bitterness which might have surprized a judicious person, who had observed the tranquillity with which she bore all the affronts to her chastity; but her patience was perhaps tired out, for this is a virtue which is very apt to be fatigued by exercise.
<name>Mr. Pickwick</name>	Mr. Pickwick	Partridge	“No doubt,” answered [MASK], “it is better to take away one's money than one's life; and yet it is very hard upon honest men, that they can't travel about their business without being in danger of these villains.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Jones	“Is it then possible, sir,” answered [MASK], “that you can guess my business?” “If I do guess it,” replied the other, “I repeat again to you, you will lose your labour.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Jenny	Nor were there wanting some, who, after the departure of [MASK], insinuated that she was spirited away with a design too black to be mentioned, and who gave frequent hints that a legal inquiry ought to be made into the whole matter, and that some people should be forced to produce the girl.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jones	children.--Will you please to have your temples--O la! I ask your pardon, I fancy there is _hiatus in manuscriptis_. I heard you was going to the wars; but I find it was a mistake.”--“Why do you conclude so?” says [MASK].
<name>serjeant</name>	serjeant	Jones	“Twenty shillings!” cries [MASK]; “why, you just now asked me twenty guineas.”--“How!” cries the serjeant, “sure your honour must have mistaken me: or else I mistook myself--and indeed I am but half awake.
<name>Robinson</name>	Robinson	Jones	[MASK] being assured that he could have no bed, very contentedly betook himself to a great chair made with rushes, when sleep, which had lately shunned his company in much better apartments, generously paid him a visit in his humble cell.
<name>Captain</name>	Captain	Western	“I don't know the name o' un,” answered [MASK]; “some officer fellow, I suppose, that we are to pay for beating us; but I'll make him pay this bout, if the rascal hath got anything, which I suppose he hath not.
<name>Captain Macmorris</name>	Captain Macmorris	Fitzpatrick	”--“O! upon my soul,” cries [MASK], “you are the very man I wanted to meet.--Upon my soul I will drink a bottle with you presently; but first I will give you a great knock over the pate. There is for you, you rascal.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jones	No, as she hath married for love, let her live on love if she can; let her carry her love to market, and see whether any one will change it into silver, or even into halfpence.”--“You know your own concerns best, sir,” said [MASK].
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Jones	Indeed, when I consider the black ingratitude of this fellow toward you, I think a highwayman, compared to him, is an innocent person.” “Good Heaven!” says [MASK], “is it possible?--I am shocked beyond measure at this news.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Allworthy	[MASK] spoke in very high terms upon this declaration, which, he said, became not a human creature. He expressed, indeed, so much resentment against an unforgiving temper, that the captain at last pretended to be convinced by his arguments, and outwardly professed to be reconciled.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Tom	It is a receipt I must take myself; for, to confess the truth to you--I never liked any girl half so much in my whole life; but I must let you into the whole secret, [MASK].
<name>Mr. Collins</name>	Mr. Collins	Jones	Many more things of this kind she uttered, some of which it would do her no great honour, in the opinion of some readers, to remember; nor are we quite certain but that the answers made by [MASK] would be treated with ridicule by others.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Sophia	For you say truly, madam, we cannot force our inclinations, much less can they be directed by another.” “Oh! sir,” answered [MASK], “every word you speak proves you deserve that good, that great, that benevolent character the whole world allows you.
<name>Tom Jones</name>	Tom Jones	Jones	The bumpers which were swallowed on this occasion soon put an end to the conversation. Here, therefore, we will put an end to the chapter. Chapter viii. In which fortune seems to have been in a better humour with [MASK] than we have hitherto seen her.
<name>Cleopatra</name>	Cleopatra	Sophy	“[MASK], you know I love you, and can deny you nothing. You know the easiness of my nature; I have not always been so easy. I have been formerly thought cruel; by the men, I mean.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Partridge	He spoke these words with so pathetic an accent, that [MASK], among whose vices ill-nature or hardness of heart were not numbered, burst into tears; and after swearing he would not quit him in his distress, he began with the most earnest entreaties to urge his return home.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Nightingale	[MASK], who well knew his uncle to be as headstrong as his father, submitted to attend him home, and then they both returned back into the room, where the old gentleman promised to carry himself with the same decorum which he had before maintained.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jones	Luckily, however, for the poor wretch, he had fallen into more merciful hands; for [MASK] having examined the pistol, and found it to be really unloaded, began to believe all the man had told him, before
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Allworthy	cries [MASK]: “Well, and what were the words? What did my sister say to you?”--“She took me by the hand,” answered he, “and, as she delivered me the letter, said, `I scarce know what I have written.
<name>Robinson</name>	Robinson	Jones	In the morning [MASK] grew a little uneasy at the desertion of his surgeon, as he apprehended some inconvenience, or even danger, might attend the not dressing his wound; he enquired of the drawer, what other surgeons were to be met with in that neighbourhood.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Watson	“The other gamester presently quitted the room, and then [MASK] declared he was ashamed to see me; `but,' says he, `I find luck runs so damnably against me, that I will resolve to leave off play for ever.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Partridge	He did, indeed, himself change colour, and his voice a little faultered while he asked him, What was the matter? “I hope, sir,” said [MASK], “you will not be angry with me.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jones	To say the truth, [MASK] himself was not a little surprized at what he saw; for, besides the extraordinary neatness of the room, it was adorned with a great number of nicknacks and curiosities, which might have engaged the attention of a virtuoso.
<name>Mr. Knightley</name>	Mr. Knightley	Square	He at length concluded with again blaming the action as inconsiderate, and which, he said, was pardonable only in a child. [MASK] had delivered his opinion so openly, that if he was now silent, he must submit to have his judgment censured.
<name>Fanny</name>	Fanny	Graveairs	No, my dear [MASK], however provoked, however ill-treated, however injured in my love, I have firmly resolved never to give the least room for censure on this account.--And yet, my dear, there are some people so malicious, some tongues so venomous, that no innocence can escape them.
<name>Sophia</name>	Sophia	Sophia	With this, he had likewise that distinguishing taste, which serves to direct men in their choice of the object or food of their several appetites; and this taught him to consider [MASK] as a most delicious morsel, indeed to regard her with the same desires which an ortolan inspires into the soul of an epicure.
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Jones	They say that they were at too great a distance to overhear any words that passed between you: but they both agree that the first blow was given by you.” “Then, upon my soul,” answered [MASK], “they injure me.
<name>the stranger</name>	the stranger	Square	He will then summon his priest, when there is none to be found, and will lament the want of that absolution, without which no sinner can be safe.”--“If it be so material,” says [MASK], “why don't you present it him of your own accord?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Western	If there be no law of nature, there is no right nor wrong.” “How!” says the parson, “do you then banish revelation? Am I talking with a deist or an atheist?” “Drink about,” says [MASK].
<name>Tom Jones</name>	Tom Jones	Jones	Did you never hear, sir, of one Partridge, who had the honour of being reputed your father, and the misfortune of being ruined by that honour?” “I have, indeed, heard of that Partridge,” says [MASK], “and have always believed myself to be his son.”
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Sophia	My lord then made another and a longer speech of the same sort. Upon which [MASK], trembling, said, “Am I really to conceive your lordship to be out of your senses? Sure, my lord, there is no other excuse for such behaviour.”
<name>the old man</name>	the old man	Partridge	should not I be a blockhead to lend my money to I know not who, because mayhap he may return it again? I am sure it is safe in my own bureau, and there I will keep it.” The attorney's clerk had taken a great fancy to the sagacity of [MASK].
<name>Don Quixote</name>	Don Quixote	Jones	[MASK] was so confounded with his fears for his lady's reputation, that he knew neither what to say or do; but the invention of women is, as hath been observed, much readier than that of men.
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Jones	I can account too well,” answered [MASK]; “I have sinned against her beyond all hope of pardon; and guilty as I am, my guilt unfortunately appears to her in ten times blacker than the real colours. O, my dear uncle!
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jones	[MASK] paused a moment, and then said, “Since I have trusted you with so much, and since, I am afraid, her name is become too publick already on this occasion, I will not conceal it from you.
