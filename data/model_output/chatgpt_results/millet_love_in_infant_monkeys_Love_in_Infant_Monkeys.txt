<name>Nellie</name>	Nellie	Pia	When I first cleaned his rooms I thought the birds were disgusting. I would avoid the rooms whenever I could and leave them to [MASK]. She was a harder worker and didn’t turn up her nose at anything.
<name>Thornton</name>	Thornton	Carter	A great vaulted hallway held them all, these massive, looming figures of men, and here was one of the monoliths in my office. Coming to me for help. Because no one knocks on a psychologist’s door to sell Girl Scout cookies. [MASK] wanted something.
<name>Peter Singer</name>	Peter Singer	Harry	This is simple scientific method; [MASK] admitted it. The suffering of lesser beings is often the price of knowledge. As he put it, “If my work will save only one million human children, I can’t get overly concerned about ten monkeys.”
<name>John</name>	John	Golakov	Leave me be. I have work before me.” In the months leading up to the incident that brought about [MASK]’s dismissal, the conversations he records become increasingly agitated and hyperbolic. Indeed a sort of rageful ecstasy is manifest: “How you shame me!
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Adamson	Then she leaned down over the foal and sank in her teeth. The movement, said [MASK], was gentle. The foal barely struggled; its legs jerked reflexively but soon it was still. Later, he said, he almost believed he had dreamed the episode.
<name>her</name>	her	K.	His granddaughter set down the dartboard again, a little disappointed. “Say what you like,” said the mother. A coolness came into her voice and it occurred to [MASK] she had a certain steely quality. “Say what you like about anything you want.
<name>Yasmeen</name>	Yasmeen	Pia	Never once did I see a woman in his suite, except for [MASK] cleaning. Her husband beat her so badly she went deaf in one ear; her left eyelid drooped from when he flicked it half off with a knife tip.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Chomsky	"It’s got this crack all the way across the bottom now, from that corner to this one.” “But the gerbils wouldn’t mind,” said the little girl. “Would they?” “They might not,” conceded [MASK].
<name>the experimenter</name>	the experimenter	Bill	Then the boxes where [MASK] had dosed the subjects with reserpine. These monkeys, too, huddled unmoving. Serotonin had been suppressed; this seemed to equate almost uniformly with complete listlessness, complete passivity. Might be other factors, but still: very interesting.
<name>Joey</name>	Joey	Bronstein	And though the keepers’ judgment in allowing the lizard and the barefooted man into such close proximity might have seemed an invitation to litigation, publicly the couple was sanguine about the episode, with [MASK] taking responsibility for his decision to enter the exhibit and joking about the encounter.
<name>the boy</name>	the boy	K.	The other boy followed. “I can’t—I can’t—” said the mother, and [MASK] saw she was on the verge of tears. “Here, let me,” he said, and held open her bag while she rummaged around inside it.
<name>Mr. Pignati</name>	Mr. Pignati	Tesla	I asked her how it had been and she half smiled, which she hardly ever did because it called attention. But she didn’t say much. It was three days later that I knocked on [MASK]’s door with his new bags of birdseed on a handcart.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Marco	I went to visit her after she was sent up the river. She told me the poisoning had been painful and she was sorry for that. She hadn’t wanted [MASK] to suffer, she said, because suffering wouldn’t have changed him.
<name>The stallion</name>	The stallion	Adamson	But abruptly she stopped, pulling up short. Her ears were flat; then they pricked. She and the foal seemed to be studying each other. [MASK] was shocked, bordering on indignant, but he remained in the copse.
<name>Dr. Nolan</name>	Dr. Nolan	Chomsky	Not in theory—because I know my husband would do anything for the baby, in an emergency or whatever— but in practice. Every day. Every hour.” “There are rewards, though, aren’t there?” asked [MASK] with a paternal air.
<name>Black Jack</name>	Black Jack	Guy	“I just want to leave it in peace. I don’t want to desecrate the corpse.” He snorted. “You seen the others? [MASK]? Was he with you?” “Nah. Went off on me own.” He was turning away.
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Chomsky	He watched out the window, still clutching the pig ballerina, as the two of them trudged toward the main garbage pit with their burden. When they reached the pit [MASK] stood at the railing for a long moment, holding the gerbil cage with his thin arms outstretched.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Adamson	You were saying, the German reminded him. Girl and giraffe? Yes, said [MASK] softly. The old man was frail, thought the German, with the ranginess of a hungry dog; his muscles had no flesh between them. He had nothing to spare.
<name>Jimmy</name>	Jimmy	Carter	The president had been unmanned. It was then that I had an inkling of what was going on. The killer rabbit had brought [MASK] to me. “ . . . Never thought of you as the town bully myself,” he was saying.
<name>Bugs</name>	Bugs	Paws	Comic-strip spoofs of the episode appeared, one of them starring “[MASK],” a sharklike rabbit menace. The president had been unmanned. It was then that I had an inkling of what was going on.
<name>Donald</name>	Donald	Lucky	Not as easy as he’d thought it would be. Pulled it together, though. “[MASK]. Always have smart wives to help me with it.” She shot him a look of pity: Everyone knew the second smart wife was on her cancer deathbed.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Girl	The old man was frail, thought the German, with the ranginess of a hungry dog; his muscles had no flesh between them. He had nothing to spare. So [MASK] had lain there on the log in the sun, dozing while the giraffe moved from tree to tree.
<name>Tesla</name>	Tesla	Tesla	[MASK] told me that he chose not to marry. He said love could be all right for working people, and maybe also for poets and artists, but not for inventors like him, who had to use all their passion for invention.
<name>Tracy</name>	Tracy	Guy	You know? I mean, it was really suffering.” “Brain the size of a peanut, yeah? How much suffering could there be?” He was openly contemptuous. Thing about these lager boys of [MASK]’s was, they gave her a reality check.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Adamson	The smoke from [MASK]’s pipe was spicy. The German was disgusted by smoking—frankly, any man fool enough to do it deserved what he got—but he had to admit the pipe smelled far better than cigarettes. You were saying, the German reminded him.
<name>unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Roan	She told him with regret that she had obligations back home, to her career, her fans and above all—remembering in the nick of time a tidbit from the tabloids—her adopted son [MASK]. He was still a toddler and was staying with his grandmother, she added quickly, at the moment.
<name>Levin</name>	Levin	Israel	Around the time of his doctoral dissertation he had changed his last name, not because he was Jewish—for he was not, in fact, Jewish—but because the name [MASK] sounded Jewish, and this made it hard to secure a good job.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Robert	Never thought of you as the town bully myself,” he was saying. “You could be, ah, insistent, and you didn’t always know your own strength, but heck, [MASK], that’s par for the—” “The killer rabbit,” I interrupted.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Adamson	[MASK] stayed seated in the scrub, drank from a flask and puffed on his pipe. There was a silver elegance to the day, which was unusually mild and breezy; he listened to the wind rattle the branches and whisper the dry grass.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	K.	The old scavenger woman had slipped out unnoticed. [MASK], standing over a table, had the odd impression that the light filtering through the dirty gray windows had shifted or been subdued—as though an object of enormous weight and strange design had moved silently in front of the sun.
<name>Chiang</name>	Chiang	Carter	Do not fall prey to [MASK]’s feebleness. For a while he had governed the nation, but weakness toppled him in the end. The rolling gait of the cat came to mind, how quickly it could get where it was going on its less than three legs.
<name>Stephanie</name>	Stephanie	Guy	Gave her the creeps. What [MASK] saw in these losers from the King John with their saggy beer tits . . . Come to think of it, she liked this one even less when he was carrying a gun.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Marco	[MASK] was shaving at the bathroom sink; they used straight razors then. She hung the shirt on a padded hanger and tapped some rat poison into his drink. Then she took the drink into the bathroom to him. Nothing was ever, ever so easy, she told me.
<name>Ezra Pound</name>	Ezra Pound	Mind	[MASK] kept working, working. A powerful machine. Difficult to rein in. The bird once ate the worms, now worms would eat the bird . . . every word filled with light. That was how it should be. Desire to Receive. Which name?
<name>a geisha</name>	a geisha	Stone	She was always glad to moonlight as [MASK], for playing the part entertained her and the money was often good; in this instance the money had been excellent, the seats first-class, the location exotic, and—an unexpected perk—the guy for once halfway good-looking.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Bob	Shooting them was a mercy killing. I mean come on—fly, eat worms, fly, lay eggs, fly, starve to death. “[MASK]’s your uncle.” (You go girl.) Life was not equal for everyone.
<name>Edison</name>	Edison	Golakov	Since the inventor had suffered a partial loss of hearing, it is not impossible that he may have welcomed the silence of a celluloid companion. And while almost certainly not accurate in all regards, [MASK]’s notations clearly have a documentary value in elucidating aspects of the event.
<name>he</name>	he	Carter	What are you going to do?” For a time there was another pause, [MASK] seeming to gaze at me. Before long he stood. “You know, friend,” he said in his gentle voice, “all of Creation is under this blue dome of sky.
<name>Melinda</name>	Melinda	K.	"They won’t even take it now, is the thing. They’ll just think it’s junk, with a crack across the base like that.” “Oh,” said the little girl. She blinked, and again [MASK] thought tears were coming.
<name>Giselle</name>	Giselle	Girl	Possibly she was waiting, pent up and ready. But no. [MASK] straightened; she relaxed. She sniffed around the foal’s long legs. She jumped onto a dry log. She yawned. And the giraffe kept eating, munching and grunting softly.
<name>Marx</name>	Marx	Lenin	Here there were some of those, too, but you had to go down the pub to find them. And at least they didn’t run the country. All history was the history of class struggle, right? [MASK] said that, and he had style.
<name>Barry</name>	Barry	Carter	I needed a second to settle my nerves. I had known [MASK] before, certainly, but back then he was just a skinny kid with big teeth, your basic Young Baptist Next Door. Myself, I already had a deep voice.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Pia	He said, “Please, Mees,” and looked at her solemnly. I was scrubbing the inside of his windows with balled-up newspaper. I said, “Go, go,” and promised I would cover for her. [MASK] never got to walk in the park.
<name>Andy</name>	Andy	Robert	“[MASK], I came to talk about you. And the wrong we boys did in letting you take the fall for us. In letting you alone be punished.” A diversion. It’s hard for any guy to admit to his impotence.
<name>him</name>	him	Pia	Since I knew [MASK], sometimes I have thought: I would have liked to know that love. She thought he was as good as a saint—a saint or even more. She had her own problems. One of them was a harelip.
<name>Churchill</name>	Churchill	Chomsky	But he admired [MASK] for his persistence in politics. “Can I take this?” asked the little girl, and stood up from a pile in the corner with a cobweb on her shoulder, holding up a heavily pocked dartboard.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Chomsky	asked the little girl, and stood up from a pile in the corner with a cobweb on her shoulder, holding up a heavily pocked dartboard. “Are there darts along with the board?” asked [MASK], and went to rummage beside her.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Adamson	There was sun on the log, glancing across the nape of the lion’s neck so that her face was illuminated, the rest of her in shadow. She licked a paw and lay down. [MASK], squatting in the bushes, stayed put.
<name>Smaug</name>	Smaug	Komo	(This was a ritual dance of appeasement aimed at older dragons, who might otherwise eat their offspring.) In captivity [MASK] had quickly become accustomed to his zoo diet of rodents, chicks and rabbits and now only rarely rolled in feces, with a halfhearted shrugging motion.
<name>Yitzhak</name>	Yitzhak	Blackie	He had insisted on walking [MASK] himself when he was submitting to a barrage of chemotherapy that would have felled lesser men. The dogwalker respected the violinist, though it was unpleasant to see him in his wretchedness. A dog in his state would have been euthanized long ago.
<name>it</name>	it	Chrissake	Cot thing?” “Certainly,” said the woman. “There, there. You poor dear.” She leaned close and whispered with obscene intimacy: “How’s she doing?” Wasn’t a baby bird, for [MASK]. No broken wing.
<name>Nadia</name>	Nadia	Reagan	“I know what you’re thinking,” I said. In a session I would never say this, of course, but we were old familiars, after all, and I felt myself homing in. “Maybe [MASK] wouldn’t have won at all.
<name>Chris</name>	Chris	Guy	She should envy the bird, actually. [MASK] said in the wild they died of starvation. Shooting them was a mercy killing. I mean come on—fly, eat worms, fly, lay eggs, fly, starve to death.
<name>Doctorow</name>	Doctorow	Bobby	“Why I came to see you, [MASK],” he offered up when the small talk wound down, “was I’m trying to take a deep look at myself these days. Yesterday and tomorrow. I look back at my life so far and I try to make a moral reckoning.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Tesla	But I think, even then, that she had left it behind. By it I mean the regular world—the Hotel New Yorker and me. She had already gone; she had gone after [MASK]. She had no use for a world without him.
<name>Sean</name>	Sean	Adamson	And never, he said, in his experience, did they lie down at the feet of their predators. And yet this was what the foal did. It had been a good day, said [MASK], and raised his glass.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Steve	Bullshit, but [MASK] was good at that side of it. Spade a spade, goddammit. Saw a garden hose sticking out of a spigot against the side of the house. Turned it on, with some difficulty. Wrestled with the hose till cool water sputtered into his mouth.
<name>Dr. Love</name>	Dr. Love	Harlow	To refute it, [MASK] decided, the value of love would have to be demonstrated in a controlled experimental setting. He worked long hours, seldom leaving his laboratory. With his experiments he made a name for himself, appearing on television programs and traveling the country on speaking engagements.
<name>Thomas Edison</name>	Thomas Edison	Edison	So [MASK] sent his technicians to the site of the execution and had them engineer and film the condemned animal’s fiery death. They attached electrodes to her body, strapped on sandals and set up their camera. The brief filmstrip that resulted still survives, a few grainy, gray seconds.
<name>The bird</name>	The bird	Birds	It was still beautiful. She put her hand on the feathers. You could feel the slight warm frame beneath them. It was light, almost nothing in there. [MASK] were like air. It had been more beautiful when it wasn’t dead, though.
<name>Madonna</name>	Madonna	Novelty	None of them could touch her when it came to transformation. That was the secret to her longevity. She wasn’t one megastar; she was a new one constantly. [MASK] was what people lived for. Skin-deep, maybe, but so what?
<name>He</name>	He	Tesla	He nodded politely. But I happened to know her kitchen had no windows. [MASK] had close women friends, though none were his girlfriends. He believed women were as smart as men and that one day they would be just as educated and maybe even more so.
<name>Don DeLillo</name>	Don DeLillo	Chomsky	So it’s easy for you to be perfectly relaxed, isn’t it?” “Crisis is big,” said [MASK]. “Crisis is not this trivial, daily texture of living.” “Sure. If you’re a robot, that is,” said the harried mother.
<name>Xiao</name>	Xiao	Suandi	Confident that the movie star would be pleased to become his chattel, he charged one of his junior secretaries with her summoning and transportation to the compound. This secretary, [MASK], spoke only rudimentary English and was terrified by the prospect of trying to talk to important Hollywood persons over the transpacific telephone lines.
<name>Topsy</name>	Topsy	Topsy	[MASK], the elephant in question, was a disgruntled circus and work animal who had suffered the pains of forced labor, captivity, neglect and abuse. She had responded by killing three men, the last of whom fed her a burning cigarette.
<name>Jimmy</name>	Jimmy	Carter	“Pardon me?” “It’s about the killer swamp rabbit,” I said. “Isn’t it. Why you’re here.” [MASK] shook his head bemusedly, the vaguest hint of a smile playing about his lips.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Effin	The ones that weren’t gay were often angry about it. It was a trade-off, more or less. OK. The bird was finally chilling out. Lying there. [MASK]’ dead. “Oi. Bag one, then?” She jumped.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Guy	[MASK] was not gay, of course. But he had an edge of anger to him. The ones that weren’t gay were often angry about it. It was a trade-off, more or less. OK. The bird was finally chilling out.
<name>Galahad</name>	Galahad	Madge	[MASK], marksman. That worked too. When the British press gave you a nickname, that meant you were one of their own. Love you or hate you, that was irrelevant. What mattered was being one of them. In the gray steely ranks.
<name>the leaves</name>	the leaves	Girl	She yawned. And the giraffe kept eating, munching and grunting softly. It shifted on its feet; it stooped down, head dipping toward [MASK] and up again to the branches, where it tore and chewed, tore and chewed, with a complacent singularity of purpose.
<name>the father</name>	the father	Chomsky	And here’s where you hang the water bottle. The whole assemblage, of course, approximates the animal’s natural environment. Burrows, et cetera.” “We had a gerbil,” volunteered the little girl. “Mongolian,” elaborated [MASK].
<name>Magnolia</name>	Magnolia	Pity	Their laughter was carrying. She felt annoyed, but then a surge of forgiving. She could not blame them for their alcoholism. They were so small! All of them. [MASK] warmed her, a generous blossoming. It was so hard to be small.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Pia	[MASK] and I wanted to go but we couldn’t get off work; she said a prayer and lit a votive candle. But I think, even then, that she had left it behind. By it I mean the regular world—the Hotel New Yorker and me.
<name>Dad</name>	Dad	Chomsky	She shook her head but refused to cry. “Come on,” said [MASK] gently, and shifted the gerbil condo to hold it propped against his side so he could take her hand. “Let’s go.”
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	K.	In the nineteen-thirties, I believe. ’Course, they were originally exported as research subjects.” “That hamster choked,” said the little girl solemnly to [MASK] “It choked right to death. On a piece of popcorn. My dad buried it.”
<name>Leonardo</name>	Leonardo	Madonna	Must have a leg broken, as well as a wing. Guess she had good aim these days, since she’d really hit it. [MASK], marksman. That worked. Evoked paintings from the Renaissance. (“Re-«<*y-since.” Use frequently.)
<name>Pal</name>	Pal	Harry	Maybe it was the shirt. Was it supposed to be white? He could not remember. Gray, beige or white? What color was the shirt to begin with? “Get you a highball, [MASK]?” It was a hard-to-breathe night.
<name>Phaedrus</name>	Phaedrus	Girl	[MASK] had given him a whole afternoon in which to feel the thorny branches and leaves in his mouth, the sun and shade cross his neck, his heavy lashes blink in the air. It was a free afternoon, because all afternoon the foal had been free of the past and free of the future.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	K.	He extended a forefinger to the baby, which grabbed it. The mother was wiping her own hands now, up and down the fingers. [MASK] looked at the baby’s face: It was a pumpkinhead, he would tell me later.
<name>John</name>	John	Tesla	His first thought when he got back to his room, with three ribs broken, was that someone had to do the day’s feeding for him. He sent out a bellhop with his bag of seed. Anyone else might have gone to the hospital but [MASK] had no truck with doctors.
<name>the chancellor</name>	the chancellor	Harry	No idea who it was. Might be the chancellor, for all he knew. Wished he would disappear. “Huh,” [MASK] muttered. Guy was already veering toward something out the side door, where a fountain was playing. A twinkle of water?
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Carter	“Fix it firmly in your mind. The rabbit is what defeats us in the end, no matter what we do.” I saw a leaden pinpoint shrinking inward; I saw dry motes of dust, the gray hours. Then my eyes glanced across [MASK].
<name>Harry Harlow</name>	Harry Harlow	Harry	When it came to the treatment of research animals, [MASK] was squarely in the mainstream. Only his willingness to speak bluntly was avant-garde. He gathered disciples around him, young women and men who would continue his work, and decades later he would still be revered by psychology.
<name>the client</name>	the client	Carter	Back then I was advising clients to use punching bags for aggression, often with images taped to them. It was an innovative therapy and independently pioneered. But [MASK] was fairly sophisticated, and I felt instinctively it would be better to keep the self-expression abstract.
<name>Mr. Gatsby</name>	Mr. Gatsby	Komo	He took her to meet [MASK] on the second morning but offered no introduction as they walked through the gardens, for he wished it to be a complete surprise. She had been only vaguely aware of the incident at the Los Angeles Zoo.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Harlow	She squeaked at him. Well, not at him, technically. She did not know he was there; she could not see him. She could see no one. She was alone. [MASK] got in the car.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Vincent	With an animal mobile. Has anyone seen a bouncy chair?” “It got took,” said the old scavenger woman. “Right before you got here. A lady in a Beemer.” “Are you kidding? [MASK] said he would keep it for me!
<name>Wolfgang</name>	Wolfgang	Blackie	The poodle had never done anything to hurt the kid. He had guided the frail old man to a ledge where he could sit, and from then on the poodle had been one of his charges. He imagined telling the violinist he could not take [MASK].
<name>now</name>	now	Bob	Yesterday and tomorrow. I look back at my life so far and I try to make a moral reckoning. Where have I been, [MASK]? And where do I want to go?” “Makes sense,” I said, encouraging.
<name>someone</name>	someone	K.	“We actually have one of those we don’t use, I think,” said [MASK] to the harried mother, wanting to help. “My daughter outgrew it. What I don’t know is where it ended up.”
<name>John</name>	John	Suomi	[MASK] had said he’d be there. But first, check the experiments. Walking along the row of vertical chambers, he gave cursory glances inside—one, two, three subjects in a row had given up trying to climb out of their wells of isolation.
<name>Lorelai</name>	Lorelai	Chomsky	Could I have one second of sympathy?” “I get so tired of the constant state of emergency,” said [MASK]. “Everything is a personal crisis. A kid spitting up is a crisis. A baby chair that’s missing is a major injustice.
<name>Lola</name>	Lola	Blackie	The dogwalker handed the poodle’s leash to the attendant and [MASK] jumped up into his owner’s lap. The old man winced but petted the poodle with a bone-stiff hand. “I need to know what will happen to her,” said the violinist.
<name>Thomas Edison</name>	Thomas Edison	Edison	It shows the creature being led, swaying gently, to the place of her doom; there, a white fire rages around her body. She collapses onto her side. [MASK] himself was not present at the electrocution. As always, his attentions were claimed by a busy schedule.
<name>Greg</name>	Greg	K.	“I’ve got a great gerbil house! Up for grabs!” The harried mother, unimpressed, pushed by him and let the door slam behind her, heading purposefully for a pile of used baby objects. [MASK] wanted to tell her, “Hey!
<name>him</name>	him	Blackie	the violinist might ask. “I would like nothing more than to take [MASK] in,” he could say. “But all I can do is help find a new family for him. Allow me to do that, at least.”
<name>Gene</name>	Gene	Carter	I will always be profoundly repentant for what we boys did.” [MASK] was playing hard at deflection. He’d brought out the big guns. “What you may want to do at this point is visualize the rabbit,” I said. My mind was wandering.
<name>Dr. Watson</name>	Dr. Watson	Edison	On the occasion in question, a quiet evening in late September, he had ingested both remedies in some quantity, alternating quite neatly between them. As he sat quaffing a nightcap in [MASK]’s closet (the closet featured a slatted door), he had a good view of the scene in the study.
<name>Elephant</name>	Elephant	Contradiction	I have seen for myself how insensate you are. A pachyderm is not given to flights of fancy . . . There is no God in the Church, no: not there. But I begin to see Him. I see Him nonetheless. . . [MASK]?
<name>the smuggler</name>	the smuggler	Rajaputra	She smiled sadly at us and promised to drop us an email when she reached home safely. Then she was ushered belowdecks into a dark storage room—a cautionary measure, lest a nearby police boat draw close and demand an inspection, for the authorities were in [MASK]’s pocket.
