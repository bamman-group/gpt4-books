<name>Nerds</name>	Nerds	\bu	He set his jaw to offer you no clues. What is an appropriate desire? Not the dainty jewel candies. Laffy Taffy? Too soft. [MASK] put your hand on a small box that features a drawing of a grape dressed for combat. “What’s that?”
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Y)u	She uses her fork to spear a single kernel of corn. “Is somebody sitting here?” The words make it out of your mouth after first passing through your gut. “I don’t see nobody.” She impales another kernel. [MASK] set your tray beside hers.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Bight	He fastened me in a little car built for two kids. Some other cars were filled up because a lot of kids came together. [MASK] before we were ready to get moving, a little white boy came up with his perfect attendance ticket.
<name>Margie</name>	Margie	Octavia	[MASK] rises from her stool, walks to the front of the cafeteria, and dumps her dime lunch into the large trash can without taking care to see that the tray is saved. The cardboard in her shoe is slick and she nearly loses her footing as she walks to the door.
<name>Joey</name>	Joey	Delvis	I kept on with my baby steps. “Why you walking so slow?” [MASK] asked. “It’s freezing out here, and Happy Days on too.” “What your barber said?” I asked him to get his mind off my turtle walking.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Delvis	I didn’t say nothing. I just kept walking in little baby steps. I was worried about losing my Kotex. I didn’t trust that sticky stuff to hold it on. Next time I was going to use safety pins. [MASK] was in a evil mood.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	\bu	[MASK] walk back to your chair on legs as unsteady as spaghetti. 'Vbur classmates look at you with faces splashed with horror. “What he do?” someone asked. “He went off by hisself and almost got snatched.” There were no clucks of sympathy.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Tasha	October was dry and cool; the pine needles, brittle and sharp, blew across the playground, tumbling end over end, erasing footprints. [MASK] leaned carefully against a dull silver pole and watched the boys run races. They crouched like the runners in the Olympics two years past.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Kenny	I tucked my legs tight under my behind and the swing went from front to back. I felt like a baby rocking itself in a cradle. When I was little and my Uncle [MASK] was staying with us, he used to take me to this park.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Tasha	She even breathed half as fast as she regularly did. “We weren’t doing anything,” [MASK] protested, heading to her room. She wanted to hear more about the white killers. What were their names again?
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Tasha	He stopped smiling. “\bu came back for your fishing rod, screwdrivers, and stuff?” “No,” he said. “I came back for you two.” “''ufou’re taking us with you?” [MASK] said, alarmed.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Ayana	but she checked for skinned knees anyway. People were less likely to tease a person if she seemed actually injured. [MASK] looked at the knee. “It’s okay. But lets sit down for a while. This way we can see those cute guys over there.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Delvis	I walked in the street to get around a man laying on the sidewalk. [MASK] stepped right over him. “Drunks are a disgrace to the race,” he said. We went along quietly for a while. The wind wasn’t playing around.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Tasha	[MASK] had said hi to him when she was on her way to the water fountain a couple of weeks ago. He didn’t say hi back, but he lifted his head up and jutted his chin a little bit to show that he had heard her.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Kenny	I showed her [MASK]’s black bag with the zip. I thought that she was going to ask me what I was looking in there for in the first place, but she didn’t. “Get back,” she said, like it was going to explode.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Delvis	Sounds like he didn’t put his things back in their proper place. [MASK] say he hate junkies too. When we see a needle on the sidewalk, he kick it in the street, then wipe his shoe off like he just got through stepping in some dog doo-doo.
<name>ma'am</name>	ma'am	Octavia	Do you understand, [MASK]?” I didn’t have no idea what she was talking about. My mama always gets the light green grapes with the seeds taken out already. “'Yes’m,” I said.
<name>her</name>	her	Octavia	Y>u feel unbearably conspicuous and must get away from [MASK] as quickly as you can. “That policeman today was stupid.” She suddenly changes the subject. Her characterization of the experience is so succinct and comprehensive that there is nothing worthwhile to add to the exchange, so you just shrug.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Abu	If she asks me if I did my homework and I say “yes” when I only did half of it, she has a fit and won’t let me watch TV for a whole week. ‘[MASK] didn’t ask me if I did all of it,” I said.
<name>The announcer</name>	The announcer	Monica	Each boy looked straight ahead at the line scuffed in the red dirt with the toe of a sneaker. The winner would be the one who crossed this line first. [MASK] said, “On your marks, get set, GO!” and the boys pushed themselves forward and ran.
<name>They</name>	They	Granny	Now, why she need to have coffee before she talked to the police, I don’t know. She didn’t look to me like she was about to fall asleep. Maybe coffee makes you brave. [MASK] say that it put hair on your chest.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Delvis	Like the kind on TV when families go to chop their Christmas tree by hand. “What is it?” I said, knowing that the words special report didn’t have nothing to do with the holiday season. [MASK] put his ear to the speaker.
<name>Mrs. Jones</name>	Mrs. Jones	Tasha	“We already finished,” [MASK] said, although she knew the situation was hopeless. “Go and look it over. I’ll be up in a minute to see if you know all your spelling words.”
<name>You</name>	You	Y)u	“Why you so shy?” Did she actually want to know why, or did she merely want you to know that she noticed? But you are not shy. [MASK] simply have nothing to say. But now you are too shy to tell her this.
<name>His</name>	His	Yaur	His body radiates heat and a saltwater smell detectable over the scent of the detergent. Will he expose you? [MASK] fingers are wrapped around a fistful of jewel candies but you don’t put them in your pocket. He nods slightly, freeing you from paralysis.
<name>Heaven</name>	Heaven	Rodney	What was he going to do when he got to [MASK]? Was somebody going to say, “Dead”? Or should I say, “Absent”? Somebody should stand up and say, “Missing, like his chair!” Maybe I would do that.
<name>He</name>	He	Vfou	He looks at you, annoyed. '[MASK] didn’t realize that you had been filling an invoice. “There might be some in there.” “No it ain’t. I looked. I can’t believe you forgot the candy corn.”
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Tasha	[MASK] grinned back as he handed her the dark brown package of M&Ms. She didn’t want to eat them. This was her first gift from a boy and should be put in a scrapbook or a memory box.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Tasha	Hot tears came. She should have just told him that she didn’t want to run a relay race in her good coat. She sat crying and sweating on the concrete when the bell rang calling everyone back into the building. [MASK] was the last one into the cafeteria.
<name>She</name>	She	Y)u	Her smile fades a little bit as she sees that your design is carefully shaded to create an illusion of depth. “Y)u’ll probably win a prize,” she says. [MASK] feel that you should say something nice about her creation. Reciprocity is the cornerstone of good manners.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	\bu	“How long did it take you to make it? I wanted to work on mine longer, but my mama made me go to bed.” [MASK] shrug, feeling vaguely dishonest. “But he might give something for second place,” she muses.
<name>Georgia</name>	Georgia	Ydu	[MASK] dunk your brush, heavy and red, into the paper cup of black paint. The mix of colors is like a beetle squashed underfoot. Her eyes are on you still. “That’s pretty, what you made,” you tell her.
<name>Jess</name>	Jess	Octavia	She looked up from her desk where she was situating her teacher stuff. “'Vfes?” I shook my head in a way that was a question. “Wrong desk, [MASK]. Move up one.”
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Elaine	“I don’t know,” she said, pinching the fabric in at the waist to see how much it would have to be took in to fit me. “I think [MASK] have her in pageants and stuff.”
<name>James</name>	James	Granny	It was like having a daddy in a way. A fun daddy that like to talk to me without having to say so all the time. He used to kiss me too hard, though. But I was so little then.” “What?” [MASK] said.
<name>Darry</name>	Darry	Tasha	Nasty. The whole time I was wishing I was home. I even wanted to hurt my feet on those damn jacks [MASK]’s always leaving on the floor for me to step on. But I had to keep looking. ’fou know? I watch the TV
<name>Samantha</name>	Samantha	Monica	I got to get this hall pass back before I get into trouble.” [MASK], standing by the door, mashed her lips together as if it were taking all of her strength to keep from lying on the floor laughing and banging her fists like kids in cartoons.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Tasha	[MASK] smiled in the gentle orange glow of the night-light. “I mean that whatever is killing those kids might not be a person. It could be a creature or something.” “What kind of creature?” “Oh, any kind of creature.
<name>that</name>	that	Rodney	But also because when your daddy is not around, it look like you and your mama ran him off. Like he just couldn’t stand to be around you no more. But if I had a daddy like [MASK] got, he would have been the one ran me off For real.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Tasha	[MASK] had thought that it was dry cleaning but the package was opaque. And something about the way he handled it made it clear that this was more than just his gray suit. He’d held the garment with its hanger hooked over his index finger, gone into his bedroom and shut the door.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Tasha	As a matter of fact, [MASK] thought that she was really nice and even liked her. She felt guilty listening to the boys discuss hypothetical acts of violence toward the art teacher, even if it was in hypothetical self-defense.
<name>He</name>	He	Demetria	he asked, all nosy. People said boys had ESP about girls and their periods. [MASK] said they could take one look and one sniff and tell who had their cycle. But if he could tell already, then why was he asking me so many stupid questions?
<name>He</name>	He	Ray	“Yes sir.” “Please tell her [MASK] called. She has the number.” As soon as my ears told my heart who was on the phone, it started beating a thousand miles an hour and I had to work to get my air.
<name>I</name>	I	Tasha	“All I’m saying is that you don’t know.” She spoke the words slowly, pronouncing each letter. Yes, you can know; [MASK] felt her pulse accelerate. It knocked hard against her temples.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Tasha	There were seven girls sure to be invited, but six more would have to compete for the remaining three slots. [MASK] put a little star by those names to mean alternate like they did when they listed the girls who would be on the cheerleading team.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Jashante	And to tell the truth, I didn’t mind it so much. It was like me and her were mates, having the same problem and everything. “No,” I told her. “Me and my mama gave [MASK]’s family a pound cake and everything.”
<name>Pony</name>	Pony	Y)u	You try to drink some Coke but your throat is shut. [MASK] hold the stinging bubbles in your mouth. “But now, I thank him for it. Some of the fellas I grew up with ain’t got half of what I got.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	\bu	“Better than mine. But you can still tell that a kid did it.” You smile at the unintentional insult to your mother. [MASK] resolve to sit with her at lunch today, if she asks you.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	DeShaun	She thumped [MASK] behind the ear as they headed down the dark hallway. She’d just have to make do with the information she had. At recess, the fifth-graders had formed a kind of ad hoc discussion group.
<name>Child</name>	Child	Turner	“That’s better.” She smiled. “Put the tooth under your pillow. If the tooth fairy doesn’t leave you anything, tell me in the morning. Sometimes the treats are delivered to my door instead.” [MASK] nodded his head and left.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Tasha	[MASK] suddenly realized that she hated fifth grade. The feeling of revulsion came over her in exactly the same way that she had abruptly realized that a song playing on the radio was absolutely horrible. She had been riding along, thinking private thoughts when this truly unbearable song had forced its way into her consciousness.
<name>Ignatius</name>	Ignatius	Vbu	A long assessing breath detects rubber cement. "[MASK] take another guilty inhalation, savoring the smell in the same way that you enjoy damp ditto sheets held briefly to your face at school. But intoxicating or not, this is no breakfast smell.
<name>John</name>	John	Ray	[MASK] got things. He send money every month. That’s more than a lot of them do and I respect that. But what he really got, he can’t fit in a envelope.” I thought she was talking about hugs, kisses, and mushy stuff.
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Abu	[MASK] wanted to climb on her lap, but her huge stomach rested on her thighs, leaving no space for your narrow bottom. Even hugging was awkward, so she held your hand and kissed your forehead. When you awaken the next morning dark clouds filled with water shroud the sky, obscuring the fading stars.
<name>he</name>	he	Rodney	The casket that [MASK] was in was silver-gray and closed. I knew he was the one in there because, after all, it was his funeral. And the program in my hand had that same photo of him on the cover.
<name>Max</name>	Max	Delvis	We look crazy standing out here in the cold.” And my ears were starting to hurt from all the wind blowing up in them. [MASK] still didn’t move. I was surprised because he is usually the one making other kids do things they know better than to do.
<name>She</name>	She	Ydu	She looks up from her hands, smiles at you and perhaps waves. Maybe she is just wiggling her fingers to stimulate circulation. No. Her second movement is clearly a wave. [MASK] wave back—discreetly, you hope—and look away.
<name>Donna</name>	Donna	Couples	The dee-jay announced [MASK]’ Skate, as the opening notes of her favorite song, “I Call \bur Name,” filled the arena. “You like this song?” he asked. “Yeah. You?” “Um-hum.”
<name>Emmett</name>	Emmett	Jashante	I didn’t know him but I knew where that school was at and I got tied up all over again. When [MASK] got took, I couldn’t get no scareder. As a matter of fact, when he got killed it cooled me down a little bit.
<name>Momma</name>	Momma	Octavia	I turned my face in the right direction but locked my eyes at the Christmas tree behind her head. “[MASK].” She called my given name. I looked at her face for real this time. The hot-comb scar on her forehead was healing up bright pink.
<name>me</name>	me	Kenny	But maybe I was wrong and this man was walking just like [MASK]. He kept walking and popping his fingers to some music playing in his head. Maybe it was him. “Hey!” The swing chain jerked.
<name>Louise</name>	Louise	Delvis	My nails were cHpped short and the cuticle pushed back, just Hke she told me. “No, ma’am,” I said. “I walk with [MASK] and the twins. On Wednesdays, though, I stay late for chorus.” She nodded.
<name>Dad</name>	Dad	\bu	“Wake up,” she sings, shaking you with hands that smell faintly of glue. [MASK] emit a grunting surrender to discourage her from tickling you or covering your face with cold-creamed kisses. Satisfied that you are awake, she leaves you alone.
<name>the baby</name>	the baby	Sister	“It’s alright,” she says. “We don’t have to call her.” She hugs you, and you allow yourself to sink into the space between her arms. This is a guilty pleasure you have not enjoyed since before [MASK] was born.
<name>Momma</name>	Momma	Delvis’ll	“But what about my friend?” I said soft. “What if something happened? How I’m going to know about it?” She made a confused face. “[MASK] be right here when you get back.”
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Rodney	But after a second, I had to melt into her hug. I was tired from being up half the night crying for [MASK] and sitting up listening for weird sounds. Her chest was a good place for me to take a little rest.
<name>Starr</name>	Starr	Octavia	“And anyway, at least the Bat Patrollers is black.” “Calm down, [MASK]. I was just thinking aloud.” She wouldn’t be calm if she was the one people was trying to kill.
<name>Benny</name>	Benny	Rodney	Boy. Black. Dead. [MASK] was what my mama call “good people.” Nice for no reason at all. Sometimes he might leave a Blow Pop on my desk and not say nothing about it. He just wanted me to have it.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Grandmother	And why aren’t baby angels the little ones who die in their cribs, like your two baby aunts [MASK] says she lost? Y)u lie there hoping for a peaceful prenatal memory to assure you that death is nothing to fear.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Granny	The last time he came, he was wearing a pair of brown shorts and a shirt the color of eggshells. When he sat on [MASK]’s brown-and-white couch it looked like he was trying to hide on there like a caterpillar on a green leaf.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Jashante	There has been much conversation lately about finding bodies, as if a person’s physical self could be misplaced as easily as a catcher’s mitt. As if [MASK] might say You found my body? Where it was?
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	DeShaun	She pushed the can of peaches toward her sister in an effort to hold off the gusher until the news was over because [MASK] didn’t cry like regular people; she wailed, and nobody would be able to hear the news over that racket.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Tasha	I think that he could tell that’s how I felt. Sometimes those decent white folks can understand that we can’t forgive them. Especially not at a time like this.” In the hall, [MASK] wondered about herself.
<name>Abur</name>	Abur	Tasha	[MASK] maybe got the message. She nodded. “Abur mama going to carry something over to Rodney people?” I asked her. I figured that all the money-people live nearby to each other. She shook her head. “Our parents don’t know each other.”
<name>Sodapop</name>	Sodapop	Delvis	He got money. Sometimes you see his mama bringing him to school in a long blue car with a tan top.” “That’s him.” [MASK] brought his cheek low to scratch his face without having to let go of his brother.
<name>Andy</name>	Andy	Tasha	“Oh,” he said seriously. “Stuff. Like this.” He went into his back pocket and retrieved a car air freshener shaped like a Christmas tree. “Sold these for fifty cents each.” He held it out to [MASK].
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Forsythia	“I never did like her anyway” she said. “Me either,” agreed [MASK]. “We were just trying to be nice to her, but my mama says that you just can’t be nice to some people.”
<name>You</name>	You	Vou	\bur children’s dictionary (which you hate) does not include this important word, so you consulted the real one in the family room. Asphyxiate is to smother, which is almost the same as drowning. "[MASK] nearly drowned when you were about four.
<name>she</name>	she	Tasha	“I don’t know how old he is,” [MASK] admitted. She didn’t know how old he was, but she was pretty sure how old he wasn’t. Was that enough to make it a lie?
<name>the dead person</name>	the dead person	Rodney	I just didn’t want to talk about it. When somebody die, people like to sit around and say all the things the dead person used to do. Like with Grand-daddy. But I didn’t really have that much to say about [MASK] in that way.
<name>him</name>	him	DeShaun	That’s what he was talking about. I’m just telling you what I know.” The girls lay uneasily in the darkness and almost quiet. The story she had told [MASK] was only half real, like chocolate Easter candy with just air in the middle.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Lewis	[MASK]’s Market is a poorly lit box stuffed with overpriced miniatures of the products your mother buys at the large Kroger near Greenbriar mall. A tiny jar of mayonnaise good for no more than ten sandwiches sits beside an even tinier jar of mustard.
<name>Muhammad</name>	Muhammad	JJ	“Oh, look at your lip.” Then tears started rolling down her face. They kept running into each other and getting bigger and bigger. I got mad again. I’m the one got pimp-slapped twice. My Up was swollen up bigger than [MASK].
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Tasha	And how can you say that you can’t stand to hear it when other people are living it?” [MASK] couldn’t see her father’s face. She heard the strange muffled voice, and for a moment she didn’t believe that it was him.
<name>Darth Vader</name>	Darth Vader	Ray	Don’t get me wrong. I sometimes wish that maybe my daddy, [MASK], would be around here with us. And not just for TV-reasons like taking me to the park or letting me step on his shoes to learn how to dance.
<name>Benny</name>	Benny	Jashante	I was on the same couch in my same pajamas staring at this same TV like I had never seen one before. But last time, my mama was with me. We knew [MASK] was missing because his mama had been all over the neighborhood looking for him.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Rodney	But I know it was him because nobody else in our class say hi to me let alone give me nothing. And [MASK] come from a family with a lot of money. He always had so much candy in his pockets like he must spend two, three dollars a day.
<name>He</name>	He	Tasha	His hair, shaved low to his head, was pomaded and brushed into rows of even waves. There was something grown about him. [MASK] knew he was much older than the average fifth-grader. (Way older than her, since she had a late birthday)
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Abu	“Drain pipe came aloose again. I need you to hold it still while I strap it in place.” The door closes. [MASK] stare at it. It opens again. “When you get home from school today, clean up this snake pit.”
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	\ou	She holds up the wet Hefty bag and shakes it, sending lukewarm raindrops onto your cold face. “Is this all you want out of life?” [MASK] are not quite certain what she is asking, but clearly the appropriate answer is no, so you say it.
<name>Curtis</name>	Curtis	Delvis	“So y’all got black ones?” [MASK] was going to get himself in trouble mouthing off like this to this Angel. “We better hurry up,” I said. “The twins are hungry.”
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Octavia	And besides, the truth was humiliating now. She opened her mouth to say, “I didn’t want to run in the race with my good coat on,” when she noticed [MASK]’s wrists protruding from the sleeves of her turtleneck sweater.
<name>Queenie</name>	Queenie	Darlita	“It’s too early. She don’t be out here till seven-thirty.” “Well, who is the white man?” He took [MASK]’s right hand like me holding her left wasn’t enough. “He just one of the Guardian Angels.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Tasha	By then [MASK] had reached the swinging door. She pushed it and went inside. Inside the warm, safe building, she made an effort to breathe slowly. She felt tingly, itchy, and warm all at the same time, like she was loosely bound in a wool blanket.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Tasha	[MASK] dropped her lunch box and used her free hand to grab her little sisters wrist. The plastic container opened when it hit the porch and an apple rolled out, badly bruised. “Who’s that fooling with my door?”
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Tasha	[MASK] was pulling away from him with all of her strength and suddenly, he released her, causing her to fall backward in the red dirt. There was a rip as the pink thread underneath her arms gave way. She was aware of people laughing at her.
<name>JJ</name>	JJ	Jashante	“My cousin.” “He got killed,” someone shouted. This is the first time since [MASK] was added to the list of Missing and Murdered Children that he is mentioned at school. Now the syllables of his name are everywhere.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Delvis	“Come in and see,” he said. I paused a second. I wasn’t supposed to be in people’s houses if they mama wasn’t home. But [MASK] said, “Come on,” again. So I followed him.
<name>She</name>	She	DeShaun	Maybe there were some people that you just couldn’t be kind to, but she was pretty sure that she hadn’t met any of them. [MASK] wasn’t scared anymore. She could eat an entire plate of spaghetti while the newscaster talked about the Missing and Murdered Children.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Sister	“Wanna hear me sing the Safety Song?” [MASK] asks again. Without waiting for permission, she begins. “Kids don’t go with strangers. . . They never go with strangers . . .” “Did they say whose body it was?”
