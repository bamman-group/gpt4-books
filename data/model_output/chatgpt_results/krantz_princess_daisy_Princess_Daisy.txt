<name>Antoinette</name>	Antoinette	Anabel	She married the first real artist who asked her, only to discover that his was merely a small talent, too, scarcely greater than her own. Their only masterpiece was their daughter [MASK], whom they brought up on a diet of crusts and caviar.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Luke	Were you really too tired?” she asked [MASK], with her bawdiest smile. “Shit—just when you start to coddle me, like a real woman, you turn all aggressive. Wait till after the egg roll, won’t you?”
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Daisy	Why didn’t you ask me before you got involved with the man you work for?” “There was a phone strike,” [MASK] reminded her. “Excuses, excuses. What is the exact status of the relationship, if I may use such a word about something so sacred?”
<name>John</name>	John	Luke	It’s because babies grow up and start to eat like people but pets eat pet food all of their lives.” “You’re not entirely stupid,” [MASK] said, reluctantly. Most people reacted to the pet-food statistics with dependable indignation.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Daisy	I always said he was the best creative director in the world?” “Yeah—but the two of you don't usually work together. You fight all the time,” [MASK] murmured, still dubious. "True.”
<name>God</name>	God	Daisy	“But you worry too much.” “Well, something always does go wrong, doesn’t it?" “Sure—if it didn’t we might as well be making buttonholes. But you know [MASK] will take care of it, whatever it is.
<name>the pilot</name>	the pilot	Valensky	In the blue English sky his first air battle was a maelstrom of diving, swerving, spinning, firing planes, thrusting and striking even as they died.

<name>Prince Philip</name>	Prince Philip	Anabel	Not only had he inherited the London house and its valuable antique contents, with the exception of the Faberg6 animals which had been left to [MASK], along with a certain amount of «(148)* Rolls-Royce stock,
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Kiki	“I wouldn’t go that far,” [MASK] answered in a disobliging voice. “Hate is too strong a word to use—indifferent might be more like it” “Does he bore you?” “Not totally—he just doesn’t fascinate me.
<name>David</name>	David	Halsman	[MASK] found the actress faintly pensive, even remote, although he had photographed her twice before, the second time after she had won an Oscar few her Juliet But it was the laughing child who interested him even more than the mystery of her mother’s mood.
<name>Monte Cristo</name>	Monte Cristo	Shannon	As they walked back, up the steep hill of the Cfite de Grace, [MASK] was thoughtful. He’d never talked as much about his early years. He sensed that he’d left out something, missed some essential connections.
<name>she</name>	she	Kiki	If we wanted ‘real’ we’d do documentaries,” he mumbled, kissing her <327* under her arm. “I think I like morning armpit more than even morning mouth.” “Give me another for-instance,” [MASK] purred.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	North	Only this morning she had come downstairs in man’s white «307)*- pants and a striped purple-and-white soccer jersey. But perhaps it was a new fashion? “You planned this whole thing, didn’t you?” [MASK] gasped, getting control of himself.
<name>Freud</name>	Freud	Jenny	It proves my analyst doesn’t know everything. Oh, shit, if he doesn’t know everything maybe he doesn’t know anything." She opened her mouth in a grimace of worry. “The other day you told me that analysts were only human,’’ [MASK] reminded her.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Francesca	“It would be the worst thing for her.” When he returned from these excursions he told [MASK] that the baby was still in the same condition as before, holding on to life only by each breath she took and that the doctor refused to hold out any false hope.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Theseus	But he eludes mel” She pounded her small fists on [MASK] who licked her hand. He liked pounding. “Do you think I shouldn’t have gone to bed with him... was that a mistake?” “Of course not.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Anabel	She purred and sighed and moaned softly and thought that really it was rather nice. After the death of her first protector, [MASK] found herself, at twenty-nine, in possession of a private income which, though generous, was not quite enough for her needs.
<name>Stephanie</name>	Stephanie	Kiki	But don’t overdo it Be yourself, but don’t come on. Let him try to figure that one outl I thintr they call it “bait and switch.’ ” “I think they call it entrapment,’’ [MASK] murmured, radiant with admiration.

<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Daisy	“No, let me tell you the rest,” [MASK] said, holding herself away stiffly. “Ever since, ever since I got away from him I’ve refused to answer his letters. Finally, I wouldn’t even read his letters—that’s why my money was all lost I think.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Thafs	"[MASK] how you do it!” "You’ve got to be joking. That’s the oldest game in the book. Nobody does that anymore.” “Everybody does that who has the sense she’s bom with.
<name>that</name>	that	Ram	There aren't any stuffy musts or must nots for us—except that we must love each other.” “But not like ... not what you did yesterday ... [MASK], just... sweetness, just being together,” she said, hope and supplication mingled in her voice.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Daisy	“Right. I don’t like leaving the impression that I’m a heavy.” “Would you admit that you're aggressive?” [MASK] asked sweetly. “Aggressive—sure, but not a heavy. Will you be free for dinner sometime this week?”
<name>Isadora</name>	Isadora	Topsy	She sat bade on her heels and devoted herself to gliding her fingertips down [MASK]’s beautiful white thighs and calves all the way to the tip of her rosy toes and then back again, avoiding the pubic curls with absolute discipline.
<name>John</name>	John	Francesca	“She smiled at me. Doctor!” “Of course she did.” [MASK] ignored the remark. ‘Doctor, what’s this nonsense about not leaving me alone with the baby? 1 simply don’t understand." "You have not been well.
<name>Leibovitz</name>	Leibovitz	North	[MASK] would do anything to make a good commercial, and he put his blood and that of everyone else he worked with on the line. He didn't secretly want to make “real” movies, like the majority of commercial directors, nor did he hanker to do the most marvelously artistic still photography.
<name>Driver</name>	Driver	Pat	That’s where they parked those great lorries of theirs.” [MASK] wheeled on him. “Then I could have crane the way they came?” “Ah, certainly—but then you would have missed the Castle, Sir,” the man reproached him.
<name>Aunt Petunia</name>	Aunt Petunia	Kilti	[MASK], who already had him firmly in her grasp, tried to shake him, but he was too big for her to move satisfactorily, so she contented herself with hissing, “No gratitude. No class. No taste.
<name>Brindie</name>	Brindie	Lucy	What’s [MASK]?” “Brindie greyhound with Alsatian but I’m not positive about the rest—more greyhound certainly. She’s a bit of a bastard." “What lurcher isn’t? Do you hunt on foot with her?”
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Kiki	“Weird,” [MASK] whispered, looking at the crowd of people inside the ropes who were frozen in widely separated groups. Two of the groups were made up of conservatively dressed men in dark suits and ties muttering together in low tones. She pointed to them with knowledgeability.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Daisy	[MASK] asked, at last “Now? Not really all that much different The first few months were a bit nasty—drug therapy isn’t much fun, but now I only have to see the doctor once a month and I’m over the sticky part.
<name>Elsa</name>	Elsa	Claire	He did not notice [MASK]’s glance at his crotch, her eyebrows lifting only slightly as her practiced eye told her what had happened. Idly, she played with his earlobe, not moving any closer to him. “So, what is relativity? Can you tell me?
<name>the Marquis</name>	the Marquis	Stash	“I think not,” the Marquise said softly. “You spoke to me most rudely and your darling maman is still very angry with you.” The woman knew well that the only influence to which [MASK] made himself subject was that of his mother.
<name>it</name>	it	Theseus	“Where did you get your lurcher?" She turned toward him, black eyes filled with a disquiet-«373)^ mg gleam, a lively suspicion on her tips. “And just how did you know [MASK] was a lurcher?” she demanded. “Oh, shit!”
<name>Mrs. Peters</name>	Mrs. Peters	Francesca	“She told me ... she said ... she ... ach—the things these crazy people believe! She said that our poor little baby who died—that the baby wasn’t dead at all!” [MASK] went gray.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Daisy	Now he was certain that she was making fun of him. “Well, only... oh, it’s not important, really, it’s just silly of me to have noticed...” [MASK] babbled, trying to avoid his eyes. “The boots?”
<name>Simone</name>	Simone	Pat	she’ll be doing aerobatics in a small plane, we’ll see her weightless, in a pressurized chamber taking training for space flight and racing in the Indy 500 in a special car O.M. is making for us. [MASK] will always wear some sort of uniform and a helmet.
<name>Gyp</name>	Gyp	Theseus	She had decided to let him off the hook. He was not a man who would enjoy being embarrassed again. “Since you ask, [MASK] is Irish wolfhound crossed with greyhound on one side of the family and deerhound with greyhound on the other, with whippet and sheepdog thrown in.
<name>Fellini</name>	Fellini	North	And how come you think you’re such a hot-shot director when all you know is what you’ve seen [MASK] do? Don’t you understand that you don’t know why he does it, or how he gets his ideas?
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Ham	“For every one taste of the new vintages I must have had a bottle of water. We’re looking to buy a big natural source water but the one I liked best wasn’t for sale—belongs to the government.” “No jet lag?” [MASK] asked, with curiosity.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Daisy	Six weeks isn’t very long and I’ll come home as soon as they’re over. Just six Sundays and six Mondays ... it’s not so much.” “And six Tuesdays and six Wednesdays,” [MASK] said sadly.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Jenny	[MASK] finally found the double spread with which the cover story began. The entire right-hand page was one huge black-and-white photograph. She stared at it, read the caption and then looked again at the picture.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Daisy	[MASK], with a terrified force she didn’t know she possessed, pulled away and flung herself as far from him as she could on the loveseat, pointing- frantically in the direction of the footsteps while she pulled down her shirt.
<name>You</name>	You	Td	So I’ll be staying over till next week. Would you like... are you free for dinner tomorrow night? I suppose you’re busy?...” “No. Fm free. [MASK] like to have dinner.” “What time shall I pick you up?”
<name>Mark Twain</name>	Mark Twain	Shannon	The lines on either side of [MASK]’s mouth deepened in amusement “Beats the hell out of me how a man can get a day's work done in a jacket As for the three generations— I’ll never know. You’re looking at a genuine orphan.
<name>darling</name>	darling	Kiki	He’d write himself a memo when he went back to the house. It was worth looking into. And after all, her grandfather was an earl. ]m\. don’t like it, [MASK], cant you understand?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Kiki	“Don’t worry about that food," [MASK] said. “If you’re hungry. I’ll take you out to dinner. If you’re not hungry, we can go to my place and just talk.”
<name>He</name>	He	Danillo	The two were veterans; they knew when [MASK] booked them that they would have to put in at least three horns work on his subject before he started to shoot His work depended on their talents. He needed them in order to achieve his trademark, the more-perfect-than-life face.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Shannon	“I don’t know anything about you!” [MASK] burst out. He felt overwhelmed by jealousy of her mysterious past. What a terrible way to start the evening—reunions, memories, tears. What next? “It isn’t fair, is it?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ram	“[MASK], don’t you realize that we still have a houseful of guests and that it’s time for drinks? At least make yourself useful and run down into town for me and get some ice—the fridge is acting up, as if we hadn’t had enough confusion today...
<name>James Bond</name>	James Bond	Ram	“[MASK]’s a perfect physical specimen, brought up like a little soldier—-that damned British upper-class tradition.” He looked at the photograph again, shaking his head. “However, he’s intelligent and as tough as they make them.
<name>Bertie</name>	Bertie	Corth	/ [MASK] was amused for not quite three minutes. As amused as if a familiar, fluffy pussycat had taken it into its head to snarl at him. Why not let it exhaust itself while he fended it off with a touch of fancy footwork and the casual back of his gloved hand?
<name>Holly</name>	Holly	Daisy	He was licking up her tears. Damn it [MASK], she told herself, you go around as if you have the answers for the whole world, so just stop feeling sorry for yourself. Enough! You’re doing fine... just keep on truckin’.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	North	“Keep him on the leash at all times until [MASK] signals for him. That’ll be when the family’s finally all stuffed into the car—one of the kids is going to whine, ‘We forgot my dog.’ Then let him go.”
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Kiki	She remembered the scene as she had told the strange, sad story, the variety of expressions that crossed [MASK]’s winsome, urchin’s face; disbelief, astonishment, sympathy, indignation and wonder replacing each other in quick succession.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Ram	[MASK] was able only to capture her for a moment or two and he spent the evening dancing with many other girls, observed favorably by mothers and «326> daughters alike. He was almost tempted, that night, to propose to her, but he held back.
<name>Bertie</name>	Bertie	Sally	How can I relax at a time like this?" [MASK]’s voice scaled new peaks of anxiety. “Sit down in a chair and say *viscountess’ over and over for a half-hour ... that should be very relaxing indeed.”
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Daisy	How small she was. How incredibly sweet. Silver blonde hair, curly and fine. A grave face, a bit sad, but so marvelously familiar. And the eyes—the same velvety black, the black of a purple pansy, [MASK]’s eyes.
<name>love</name>	love	Daisy	wanting so great that it lived in a place where no one knew about it but himself, a place so far inside that his sanity was unquestioned because his outward appearance was correct, impeccable. He was to continue to live and function without [MASK] because «{458>>
<name>Artemis</name>	Artemis	Td	‘[MASK] give you the pick of the litter, of course, and split whatever the rest of them went for.” As soon as he said it he felt like a fool Did one discuss money with this sovereign woman?
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Daisy	[MASK] seemed to be utterly comfortable looking idly around the room, without making any attempt to talk to him. Why didn’t she chatter, why didn’t she flirt, why didn’t she try to get him to talk about himself like any other decent, self-respecting woman?
<name>Barack Obama</name>	Barack Obama	Valensky	But for all his poise and pulsing authority, [MASK] was not at ease in front of a camera. He had lived for much of his forty-one years with two phrases somewhere in the back of his mind.
<name>Mr. Todd</name>	Mr. Todd	Daisy	Fll go find her.” He walked quickly toward the entrance to the hotel and bumped into [MASK] who was hurrying back in. “You weren’t trying to escape, were you?” he asked. “Merely cutting off the last route to civilization.”
<name>Eton</name>	Eton	Daisy	Many hundreds of years ago the ownership of these rough-coated, mixed-blood greyhounds was confined to princes. They wore collars of gold, they were indispensable at court, where hunting was the principal pastime, and many an antique tapestry is adorned by their royal presence. [MASK]’s school.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Francesca	[MASK] opened it quickly and drew in her breath in amazement Fitted precisely into the velvet interior of the box lay a crystal pot, three-quarters filled with water. In the pot were three sprigs of thickly clustered flowers on stems of gold.
<name>T. S. Eliot</name>	T. S. Eliot	O'tash	[MASK] had just turned fourteen when he came home, as usual, for the Christmas vacation of 1925. He had reached that age at which the outlines of the man he would become were unmistakably present to an attentive eye.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Daisy	If you would only write to say you forgive me—and that you are now able to understand that you literally drove me crazy, you would relieve me of a great burden.” This letter had struck a chord of terror into [MASK].
<name>Lady Bracknell</name>	Lady Bracknell	Shannon	“Well, then, where would they be having their tea?” [MASK] asked, biting out each syllable politely. The old man pointed out a charming country house at a little distance, surrounded by trees. "The Berkeley Hunt stables and kennels. Sir.
<name>Zelda</name>	Zelda	Matty	The sky-rocket years, [MASK]? The firework years? I’m in love with a real man for the first time, so be happy for me!” She made her demands with an infuriatingly carefree smile.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Daisy	He’d never talked as much about his early years. He sensed that he’d left out something, missed some essential connections. But all he could find to explain himself to [MASK] was his favorite quotation from his durable sage.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Sally	“If* ever so windy out,” she complained to [MASK], the «479> housemaid, “and not a day to go out shooting, not at all. There won’t be any birds about.
<name>Cheryl</name>	Cheryl	Daisy	“Those must be the crew,” [MASK] said, indicating a tangle of men and women in jeans so shabby that they wouldn't have looked out of place on campus, all of whom were drinking coffee from plastic cups and munching leisurely on doughnuts as if they were on vacation.
<name>Chloe</name>	Chloe	Danielle	“[MASK] showed very little reaction to all of these tests. I repeated the examination twice at a three-week interval and the results obtained were no different. There is a paucity of movements, she rarely cries, she has not yet held up her head and she has put on only a little weight ...
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Arnie	“I’ve decided that I decline to be any part of this absurd production. Get yourself another commercial maker.” “No way. [MASK] bid on the job, we accepted the bid, and we’re counting mi you.”
<name>He</name>	He	Vasily	When at length he emerged, he spoke of a minor congestion of the bronchi, of a tendency to overstrain the nerves, of a febrile condition. “What is the treatment?” [MASK] demanded impatiently, interrupting the man’s interminable medical obfuscation.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Mildred	** “Straight through the Castle, Sir. Here, [MASK], you attend to the tickets. Fll show this gentleman to the Bowling Alley,” the man said, glad of a chance to get a glimpse of the goings-on.
<name>Janet</name>	Janet	Ram	But [MASK]’s falsehoods had been printed and no amount of later retraction or clarification would ever change the public’s idea of the truth. But what did it matter? Everyone concerned was dead now, and she was the only person left who cared.
<name>Beth</name>	Beth	Stash	The doctor, after a short pause, continued blandly to answer the unasked questions with which other men would have bombarded him. “One of your daughters is in excellent condition. Sir. As for the other.. [MASK] finally found his voice. “What about the other....
<name>he</name>	he	Stash	After dessert, while [MASK] had his coffee, the waiter, as he did at each table, brought a silver compote on which lay a variety of miniature sweets: fresh strawberries dipped in chocolate, tiny eclairs and cherries iced in frosting.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Daisy	“Too dressy,” [MASK] said regretfully, fingering the pale violet satin dress, cut on the bias and dating from 1926. “What do you think about the striped Lucien Lelong7” <237* ‘To be honest, I’ve never really liked it on you.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Daisy	[MASK] took one more look in the mirror. It was hopeless to make any objections. They’d done so much to her that she hadn’t the faintest idea of where to start to make it less awful. She got up gingerly.
<name>Lily</name>	Lily	Daisy	Oh, all right then. I’ll make it a dozen. We both know you’re spoiled, so why fool around?” In the phone booth [MASK] fumbled frantically in her change purse. It bulged with infuriating pennies and unusable half dollars. No dimes.
<name>Madonna</name>	Madonna	Daisy	As [MASK] approached a bench, two middle-aged women who were sitting there, passing a copy of People back and forth, spotted her. “Oh, look! It's just got to be her!" one of the women said to the other.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Daisy	“Didn’t you promise me you’d be all ready for us on Monday? Didn’t you promise me a special freight elevator open for business at six A.M.?” "But you never said anything about going above the roof level,” he grumbled. “Roof level!’’ [MASK] said indignantly.
<name>Clare</name>	Clare	Stash	[MASK] groaned aloud and she drank in the sound with gourmandise—that was his first groan as a man, die thought, feeling his nipple harden. Now he would never forget her. “Ah, little man, you are «47>
<name>Don Draper</name>	Don Draper	Shannon	Not only did he have a third but, if need be, he’d come up with a thirtieth. Fifteen percent of twenty million was three million dollars; the advertising agency’s commission. [MASK] was entitled to a piss-pot full of concept for that.
<name>Mr. Escalante</name>	Mr. Escalante	Robertson	[MASK], the hairdresser, wearing an expression of exaggerated patience, slumped against the wall, his battery of curling irons and hot rollers unpacked in readiness for a job he wouldn’t start for at least an hour and a half. Featherbedding.
<name>daughters</name>	daughters	Daisy	At fifty-six he had become as conservative where [MASK] was concerned as he was unconventional for himself. Not an uncommon fix for the fathers of beautiful «142> daughters to find themselves in, she ruminated with a touch of inward glee.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Daisy	A grimy little boy stumbled over [MASK]’s legs and fell, crying, into her lap. She comforted him until his mother arrived, in no particular hurry, to collect him. Another baby hung in a sling on the woman’s back.
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Masha	Gossip was one thing, but this was of such vileness, such palpable evil, to speak of her tragedy as if it hadn’t happened, to use her grief as material for a rumor. One look at [MASK]’s face told her there was more.
<name>Irina</name>	Irina	Titiana	“Let him do a penance instead, [MASK] darling. An apology is too easily given. Ah, I have it—he shall take me for a troika ride—that is, if he is old enough to control the horses?"
<name>Sony</name>	Sony	North	[MASK] frowned. If there was anything worse than having a client on the set it was having the client’s daughter, and after that came the client’s daughter's friend. “ID. Sony we don’t have time to (hat today.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Penny	[MASK] looked around quickly to see if her mother could hear. Out of the comer of her mouth, she confided, “It’s only five miles if you ride across country. But Tm not allowed to go there.” “But I am.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	North	Tm not the best-man type,” [MASK] snapped. “I quite agree... but it happens to be one of the burdens of friendship. Why should you escape? I had to do it twice for you.”
<name>Everyone</name>	Everyone	North	Since that scene when she had rebelled against the idea of becoming the Elstree Girl, she had felt at odds with almost everyone in the studio. [MASK] seemed to think that she had gone out of her way to insult an important client, and the atmosphere at work was tense and heavy.
<name>Christian Dior</name>	Christian Dior	Shannon	[MASK] let the glossy fall to the floor before he went on. “I think that the time has come to return to a romantic sell in fragrance, a classy, feminine sell. The working woman hasn’t become any less womanly because she earns money.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Daisy	The man in uniform watched, motionless in surprise, as [MASK] suddenly leapt high and held on to a rung of the railing with one strong hand. With her other hand she took off the sailor hat under which she had tucked her hair and let it blow free.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	North	“No—but I’ve heard he’s tough, rough and smart as hell.” “Perfect,” [MASK] said bitterly. “Just the kind of trouble I don’t want hanging around my production meetings. It’s bad enough with just the two of us.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Anabel	Look, I’ll find out if there’s stOl room and where die can take the exam—all right?” “Could you do it tomorrow—today, I mean. Don’t wait till you get home,” [MASK] pleaded. “Count on me.”
