<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Lexie	[MASK] woke up nestled under a crisp white comforter. It was midafternoon, and the curtains were drawn, but a lamp in the corner had been left on, a towel draped over the shade to mute it, and the thoughtfulness of this pierced her.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Mia	There was [MASK] the second her father got home, his shoes barely off and the grease not yet washed from his hands, begging for two dollars for more film, promising I’llpay it back, I promise, though truth be told, she seldom did.
<name>Steve</name>	Steve	Mia	You take care of that, it’ll be with you your whole life.” And when the Graphic View II arrived, procured secondhand from a classified ad, well loved and packed into its own case like an expensive violin, [MASK] knew this would be true.
<name>John</name>	John	Eric	“[MASK], I don’t need excuses—I just need this done. No, I’ve been waiting for this over a week; I don’t want it to wait another minute. Look, I’ll be right down.”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Mia	[MASK] would slow the car and as the dust settled they would see her hair first, a billow of gold on gold, recognizing that wild hair, that golden wildness, even before they saw her face, even before they could stop and fling the door wide and let her in.
<name>June</name>	June	Lexie	The next morning, [MASK] pretended to be running late, but once everyone had gone, she checked to be sure the house was empty before dialing the number to a local clinic, which she had looked up the night before. “The eleventh,” she told them.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Lexie	“[MASK], I really can’t remember all the odd jobs I’ve done,” she said. “You know, when you’re hard up, you do a lot of things just to try and make ends meet. I wonder if you can imagine what that’s like.”
<name>Ben</name>	Ben	Trip	she wondered. Would she look different somehow? Would everyone see her and read it in her face, what she’d done? [MASK] tossed her her T-shirt and she tugged it over her head, suddenly shy at the thought of his eyes on her body.
<name>Louise</name>	Louise	Mia	It perturbed and perplexed her, but she could not turn away. “I never thought of making a woman into a spider,” she said truthfully. Artists, she reminded herself, didn’t think like normal people, and at last she turned to [MASK] with curiosity.
<name>the car</name>	the car	Trip	By the time she checked the living room, the family room, the rec room, and the kitchen, the smoke had begun to spread, and she ran outside at last to hear the sirens, alerted by their home security system, already approaching. Out in the driveway, she saw that [MASK]
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Mia	Instead she asked the question that ran below all the other questions like a deep underground river. “Was I wanted?” “Wanted where?” With one careful lick of the brush [MASK] supplied a Prussian-blue tire in the empty fork of the bike.
<name>he</name>	he	Mia	He had already paid the bill, which [MASK] had not seen but knew must be appallingly high: they’d had oysters and wine; a tuxedoed man had prepared steak tartare at their table, deftly folding the golden yolk into the ruby-red meat.
<name>the subject of the photograph</name>	the subject of the photograph	Mia	It was clear this photograph held some secret about [MASK], and she promised herself that she would unravel it. As a freshman, she had no free periods, but she devoted several lunch periods to research in the library.
<name>she</name>	she	Mai	“They have no idea what they’re losing out on.” “It’s the state,” [MASK] said. She retrieved the letter and slid it back into its envelope. “They cut funding so the school has to cover more, and scholarships suffer.”
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Mia	Like a miracle. And they’ve been trying to adopt for so long. They’ll be such devoted parents.” She peeled the wrapper from the granola bar and popped it into the garbage can and went upstairs, leaving [MASK] deep in thought.
<name>her</name>	her	Pearl	She had always struck him as a mousy little thing, cute even, but not a girl he’d thought much about, beyond the baseline of teenage hormones that made anything female worth looking at. But today there was something different about [MASK], something about the way she held herself.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Brian	“If you’re not pissed, why are you acting like this?” “I just want some space, that’s all. You don’t have to be pawing me all the time.” “Space.” [MASK] slammed his hands against the steering wheel.
<name>she</name>	she	Izzy	Scorched earth, she had said, and at that moment [MASK] decided what she was going to do. She had spent the night planning and now that it was time, she hardly thought at all. It was as if she were standing outside herself, watching someone else do these things.
<name>Daenerys</name>	Daenerys	Mia	She felt it should be unlawful, allowing someone to conceal the name of a parent. There was something unseemly about it, this unwillingness to be forthcoming, to state your origins plainly. [MASK] had already proved herself to be a liar and capable of more lies.
<name>he</name>	he	Mia	“I could help you,” she said, quietly enough that she thought [MASK] could not hear. Then, a moment later, because this did not seem like enough, “I’m good at stories. I could even write it for you.”
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Warren	And they’re helping me, too. They’ve done so much for me.” “But don’t you think it’s going to be hard to give it up?” [MASK] asked. “I don’t think I could do it.”
<name>her daughter</name>	her daughter	Izzy	As time went on, the concern unhooked itself from the fear and took on a life of its own. She had learned, with [MASK]’s birth, how your life could trundle along on its safe little track and then, with no warning, skid spectacularly off course.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Brian	[MASK] hesitated. His mother had interrupted his father’s tirade-—something she did often, but never with such vehemence. “And what about all those black babies going to white homes?” she had said. “You think that breaks the cycle of poverty?”
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Lexie	[MASK] fell silent. Unconsciously, one hand crept down to her belly, where an ache was beginning to blossom. “I’d better go home,” she said at last. “School’s almost over, and my mom will probably be back now.”
<name>his wife</name>	his wife	Bebe	“Screaming when I left for work in the morning. Screaming when I came home at night.” He had thought about calling the police, but didn’t want to interfere. “I keep to my own business.” (But [MASK] had cried, too.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tim	[MASK] was an idiot, but he wasn’t imaginative. He wasn’t the kind to make things up. A suspicion was beginning to form in his mind. “You don’t know anything about her?” he said. “Nothing.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Izzy	Indeed, staring down that night at the baby’s long lashes, the little rosebud mouth half open in deep and contented slumber, she and her husband had felt nothing could be more appropriate. “When we got our cat from the shelter, we kept her name,” said [MASK].
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Trip	“Why don’t you go ask [MASK]? He’s the one screwing her.” With one hand he took the notebook from his mother’s lap and opened it again, focusing on his own handwriting on the page to keep tears from escaping.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Bebe	And maybe make some tea.” She sat down in the other chair and leaned across the table to take [MASK]’s hand. “You shouldn’t have just gone over there like that. You couldn’t expect them to just let you come right in.”
<name>his</name>	his	Warren	His bed was still unmade; she wondered if her mother would ever make it again, or if she’d simply strip the sheets, strip the room, paint it white, and pretend nothing had ever happened there. What would they do with [MASK]’s things?
<name>Joey</name>	Joey	Warren	[MASK], just turned ten, had himself discovered not only sports but that he was good at them. Baseball in the summer, football in the fall, hockey in the winter, basketball in all the spaces in between.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Bebe	Severe diaper rash on the baby indicated that she had sat in soiled diapers for hours—if not days—on end. (But [MASK] had had no money for diapers. Remember that she had spent her last seven dollars on formula. She had done her best.
<name>The woman</name>	The woman	Mia	The test, it turned out, was complicated. It involved a glass test tube in a special holder, suspended over an angled mirror. [MASK] was to add several drops of her urine and wait for an hour. If a dark ring formed, she was pregnant.
<name>The daughter</name>	The daughter	Mia	They were disappointed in her. And they certainly wouldn’t pay for it. “I thought we raised you to be smarter,” her mother said, her voice laced with disapproval. [MASK] had listened sadly, but it was what she’d expected.
<name>she</name>	she	Pearl	“You promised,” [MASK] said. In the safe cocoon of their home—their real home, as she’d begun to think of it—the tears began to flow, along with a choking rush of fury. “You said we were staying put.
<name>him</name>	him	Trip	“I’m good at lots of things,” she said, and then he kissed her. It was [MASK] who tipped her backward onto the couch, knocking his book to the floor, who put his hands on, then under, her shirt.
<name>Izzy</name>	Izzy	Izzy	Later people would say that the signs had been there all along: that [MASK] was a little lunatic, that there had always been something off about the Richardson family, that as soon as they heard the sirens that morning they knew something terrible had happened.
<name>June</name>	June	Pearl	okay? Did you have fun?” And [MASK], with the caution of the recently singed, would simply nod. For now, she peeled the wrapper from the gum and put it between her lips and felt the mint bloom on her tongue. “Thanks.”
<name>she</name>	she	Moody	Already he thought he saw her growing silent over their fries, prodding the last congealed lump of cheese on the plate; already he was sure her eyes were drifting across the lake to the far shore. This was how [MASK] made a decision he would question for the rest of his life.
<name>her</name>	her	Pearl	Don’t be ridiculous, she told herself. This is what you wanted, wasn’t it? For [MASK] to have friends. By the time the doors of the Explorer opened and the three teenagers piled out, she had turned off the water and greeted them with a smile.
<name>Lily</name>	Lily	Beauty	[MASK] rolled off her in waves, like heat; the very image of her in the photograph seemed to glow. She wasn’t looking at the camera; she was focused, totally and utterly absorbed, on the infant before her.
<name>Miss Froy</name>	Miss Froy	Elizabeth	You had to give her permission for every little thing: to wear lipstick, to buy a pretty dress, to put her hand up in class. Wishy-washy. She needed a firm hand. “This is confidential information.” [MASK] sat up a bit straighten
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Mia	He had wondered this all week, ever since he’d learned about [MASK]’s job. If she took on more hours, he reasoned, she would make enough for them to have a real sofa, real meals, perhaps a TV.
<name>Tracy</name>	Tracy	Lexie	Hairdos fully inflated, they posed, back-to-back, fingers pointed like guns, and surveyed themselves in the mirror in a haze of hairspray. “Perfect,” [MASK] said. “Blond, brunette, and black.”
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Mia	“Congratulations,” she said to [MASK], when she called her a month later. “I’ve sold one of them, the one with the car. Four hundred dollars. Not a lot, but a start.”
<name>Aunt Petunia</name>	Aunt Petunia	Izzy	Yes, you are. You’re the cutest baby in the entire world.” [MASK] rolled her eyes and stood up. “Keep an eye on her,” she said to the baby’s parents. “You never know when someone might steal your baby.”
<name>Jesse</name>	Jesse	Mia	“I just want to learn about what you’re doing. I could mix up your chemicals or file your papers or whatever. Anything.” [MASK] hesitated. “I can’t afford an assistant.” “You don’t have to pay me.
<name>him</name>	him	Trip	If they were up to things—as she euphemistically thought of it—she didn’t need, or want, to know. To stand in front of [MASK] and that girl and say to them, I know what you’ve been doing—it seemed as mortifying as stripping them both naked.
<name>she</name> (Note: There is no proper name that fills in the [MASK] token in this sentence. The pronoun "she" refers back to a previously mentioned person.)	she (Note: There is no proper name that fills in the [MASK] token in this sentence. The pronoun "she" refers back to a previously mentioned person.)	Warren	She wanted to be swallowed up by the house where she and [MASK] had grown up and played and argued and planned, where he no longer waited for her, which he would never enter again. She wanted to sink to her knees at the spot on the cold roadside where he had died.
<name>Arya</name>	Arya	Pearl	She had never said those words aloud, had never even allowed herself to think them, and they tasted strange on her tongue. She said it again: “Your father.” Out of the corner of her eye she saw [MASK] mouthing the words to herself, as if trying them out.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Izzy	Two bedrooms, one for the adults and one for the boys. The girls—for she was still certain [MASK] would be back with them shortly—could sleep on the three-season porch. A bathroom and a half—well, they would have to share.
<name>Bertha</name>	Bertha	Mia	Another part of her—though she was only vaguely aware of it at the moment—-was uneasy, wanted to keep an eye on [MASK], as you might keep your eye on a dangerous beast. “You keep everything so clean,” she said at last, running a finger along the mantelpiece.
<name>her father</name>	her father	Mia	It was something she would have to carry, [MASK] had said to her, and for the first time, she felt that perhaps she could. A hockey chest pad, lying in the dirt, cracked through the center, pep- pered with holes.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Mia	“Sometimes I need to see them up on the wall for a while, before I know whether I’ve got something. Before I know which ones I like.” [MASK] looked around at the photographs, as if they were old friends and she was reminding herself of their faces.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Izzy	She kissed the baby’s palm. “But we couldn’t let her first birthday go by without a celebration.” “How can you know it’s her birthday?” [MASK] asked. “If she was abandoned and all.”
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Mia	Only after he had shut the door, and the taxi was on its way back downtown to [MASK]’s cramped apartment, did she unfold the paper to see that astonishing figure again: $10,000. And below it, a single word:please.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Bebe	After two weeks of this, [MASK]’s milk had dried up. She had spent her last seven dollars on formula and then her wallet was empty, except for a fake million-dollar bill someone had given her at work, for good luck.)
<name>Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose</name>	Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose	Mia	He picked up the receiver. “I’m coming home,” he said, and set it down again and picked up his keys. [MASK], who did not own a television, had not seen the news segment either.
<name>her</name>	her	Pearl	She would find out, once and for all, who this woman was. Those days, it seemed to [MASK] that everything was saturated with sex; everywhere it oozed out, like dirty honey. Even the news was full of it.
<name>the secretary</name>	the secretary	Mia	Back in the main office, a secretary ran the attendance sheets through a machine and a recorded call went out to the parents’ home phone, alerting them about their truant children. “I called you in,” [MASK] said.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Pearl	All the long way, [MASK] cooed from her bassinet beside her, as if she were sure, even at this early age, that they were headed for great and important things, as if she could somehow see all the way across the country and through time to everything that was coming their way.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Lexie	“She probably just doesn’t know how to make friends.” “It’s more than that,” [MASK] mused. “It’s like she’s trying not to be seen. Like she wants to hide in plain sight.”
<name>girls</name>	girls	Richardsons	The paper was like satin under her fingers, the flap carefully fastened but not gummed, and as she pried the fastener open with a fingernail and opened the envelope, the remaining [MASK] clustered around her to see what it contained. There was one for each of them.
<name>her</name>	her	Izzy	Was she the bird trying to batter its way free, or was she the cage? The police would find [MASK], she told herself. They would find her and she would be able to make amends. She wasn’t sure how, but she was certain she would.
<name>he</name>	he	Mirabelle	Were they relieved to have the ordeal over? Yes, of course they were. What were their plans for the next few days? They would take some time to themselves, now that [MASK] was home to stay. They were looking forward to their life together as a family.
<name>Maya</name>	Maya	Izzy	[MASK], who had been watching silently but with interest, said nothing but pulled the plate toward her. In her experience, when someone tried to do something for her, it came from either pity or distrust, but this simple gesture felt like what it was: a small kindness, with no strings attached.
<name>She</name>	She	Lexie	He clicked the unlock button on the car door. “See you around.” [MASK] slung her bookbag over her shoulder and stepped out of the car. They had been parked on a quiet side street, a spot they’d used often when they wanted time alone.
<name>Dr. Smith</name>	Dr. Smith	Betsy	With a click she shrank the spreadsheet and like magic there it was: a window listing the patients in just the period she’d wanted. So [MASK] had changed her mind at the last minute, she thought with a flash of smugness. What had she always said?
<name>She</name>	She	Pearl	Her mother must have understood, for they didn’t sublet again. [MASK] hadn’t complained either, knowing now that she preferred an empty apartment to one filled with someone else’s things. “We move around a lot. Whenever my mom gets the bug.”
<name>use it</name>	use it	Elena	A part of her wanted to stay home, to simply be with her children, but her own mother had always scorned those women who didn’t work. “Wasting their potential,” she had sniffed. “You’ve got a good brain, [MASK].
<name>June</name>	June	Elena	Watching some woman you don’t even know walk away carrying your child. I break out in hives every time the doorbell rings, [MASK]. After they leave, I literally get down on my knees and pray she’ll come back like she’s supposed to.
<name>Spider-Man</name>	Spider-Man	Trip	Most of the smoke had gone, but a mugginess still hung everywhere, like the air in the bathroom after a long, hot shower. The roof of the car was getting hot, and [MASK] stretched his legs down the windshield, poking the wipers with the toe of his flip-flop.
<name>George</name>	George	Pearl	At the Richardson house were overstuffed sofas so deep you could sink into them as if into a bubble bath. Credenzas. Heavy sleigh beds. Once you owned an enormous chair like this, [MASK] thought, you would simply have to stay put.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Pearl	The next afternoon she came into the sunroom just before dinner. Under normal circumstances she left the kids alone, feeling that teens needed their space, that they were entitled to some degree of privacy. Today, though, she was looking for [MASK].
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Moody	“I didn’t think it was a secret.” [MASK] set the can down on the counter. “It’s not like they were subtle about it. And it’s not my job to lie for them.”
<name>She</name>	She	Pearl	“I always thought she didn’t like me.” “Well.” [MASK] considered. She, too, had had this feeling, but could sense now that something had shifted. “I don’t think you knew each other.”
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Lexie	For now, the idea still forming in his mind, he said only, “We’ll see how things shake out.” “I feel bad for her,” [MASK] said suddenly from the far end of the table.
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Mia	[MASK]’s head spun. She dug the points of her keys into the heel of her hand—not for protection now, but to convince her that what she was hearing was real. “You want—” she managed at last. “Why me?”
<name>she</name>	she	Pearl	“Wake up,” she said. “Someone will be home soon.” They put on their clothes quickly, in silence, and only then did [MASK] began to feel embarrassed. Would her mother know? she wondered. Would she look different somehow?
<name>She</name>	She	Izzy	“People are like that, too, you know. They start over. They find a way.” [MASK] nodded and turned to go, then turned back. “Tell her I’m so sorry,” she said.
<name>her</name>	her	Bebe	Only when the bailiff took her arm to escort her out of the room did she realize that the wail was coming from her own mouth. The bailiff, who had a daughter about [MASK]’s age, took her to an anteroom and pressed a cup of lukewarm coffee into her hands.
<name>He</name>	He	Lexie	It would stay with her until the following week, when she would feel cramps beginning and sigh in relief. [MASK] did not look away from the windshield. “I’m sure.” “It’s a big decision, you know.”
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Brian	Without thinking where she was going, she began to walk: down the sidewalk and around the corner and out to the main road, paths she’d driven often but seldom walked before. She and [MASK] had been friends since the eighth grade, had been dating for almost two years.
<name>Daddy</name>	Daddy	Brian	[MASK] would bounce the baby on his hip, toss the baby in the air. They would picnic in the park and the baby would roll in the grass and laugh when the blades tickled his feet. At night they would sleep with the baby between them in a warm, soft, milk-scented lump.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Pearl	It was as if the animal had been reincarnated, older and bolder and wiser. [MASK] had loved watching her mother at work, bent over the kitchen table, laboring with the precision of a surgeon—scalpel, needle, pins—to transform these toys into art.
<name>she</name>	she	Lexie	Probably nothing, not when she walked by with her belly swollen or pushing a stroller—but when she’d gone inside, they’d all talk. Her mother would be mortified. There would be shame and there would be pity, and [MASK] knew she was not equipped to withstand either one.
<name>Voldemort</name>	Voldemort	Bebe	At the same time, a thin snake of disappointment wriggled its way through her chest. She had been looking forward to ferreting out [MASK]’s past, to delivering the secret weapon that would end things for good. But she hadn’t been needed after all.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Lexie	She turned and headed for the farthest stall, by the window, but when she reached it she found that it had no door. “What happened to the door?” she asked stupidly. “It’s been broken forever,” [MASK] said.
<name>Alfred Stieglitz</name>	Alfred Stieglitz	Moody	When the idea was exhausted, she kept a single print of each shot and destroyed the negatives. “I’m not interested in syndication,” she said to [MASK] rather airily, when he asked why she didn’t make multiples.
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Moody	“We’ve been together since junior year and no one gives a crap that I’m white and he’s black.” “You don’t think his parents would rather he was dating somebody black?” said [MASK]. “I honestly don’t think they care.”
<name>Eloise</name>	Eloise	Mia	The building had a doorman, and [MASK], having never encountered one before, was so awestruck she did not listen when he told her which floor, and resorted to pressing each button in the elevator in turn and checking the names on each door before ducking back inside and pressing the next.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Mia	But at 81st, just as [MASK] rose to leave, the door at the end of the car opened and in came the man with the briefcase. He was slightly disheveled now, a few locks of his hair falling into his face, as if he had been hurrying through the cars looking for her.
<name>she</name>	she	Moody	What’s your mom doing in a photo in an art museum? Is she secretly famous?” “The people in photos aren’t famous,” [MASK] put in. “The people who take them are.” “Maybe she was some famous artist’s muse.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Mia	“I’d better go home,” she said at last. “School’s almost over, and my mom will probably be back now.” [MASK] swept crumbs of eraser dust from the table and stood up. “Are you ready?”
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Trip	She toyed with the dial of her combination lock, twisting it this way and that, and decided to be bold again. “Unless you’ve got a better idea?” [MASK] traced his fingers along the blue painted edge of the locker door.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Izzy	“They leave maybe five, ten minutes ago.” [MASK]’s heart went leaden and cold. “Did they happen to say where they were going?” she asked, though she already knew the truth: she had missed them, and they were gone.
<name>Lisa</name>	Lisa	Lexie	“You know why she watches TV all afternoon? Because she can finish her homework in half an hour before bed. Like that.” He snapped his fingers. “[MASK]’s got a good brain. She just doesn’t always use it in real life.”
<name>June</name>	June	Mia	But she felt a twinge of sympathy for [MASK], too, one she hadn’t felt before and had never expected to feel: how excruciating it must have been to think about giving her child away. What would she have done if she’d been in that situation?
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Pearl	“They look cute on you. I’ve got too many clothes as it is.” [MASK] had bundled the shirts into her bag. If her mother noticed, she decided, she would say she got them at the thrift store with everything else.
<name>She</name>	She	Pearl	[MASK] blushed, but pretended she’d heard it before. Everyone seemed so blase about saying words she’d never even dared to whisper. Everyone, it seemed, was fluent in innuendo. It confirmed what she’d always thought: everyone knew more about sex than it appeared, everyone except her.
