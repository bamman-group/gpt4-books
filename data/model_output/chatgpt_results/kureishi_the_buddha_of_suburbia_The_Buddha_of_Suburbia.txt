<name>Geoffrey</name>	Geoffrey	Changez	[MASK] had had his hair cut; his Flaubert moustache had been plucked from under his nose; and he was wearing a large grey boiler suit buttoned up to the throat. 'You look like a motor-mechanic,' I said. He beamed back at me.
<name>he</name>	he	Charlie	These ponderings were interrupted by what I could see and [MASK] couldn't. She extracted two wooden pegs from her bag, and as she bit one nipple she trapped the other with the peg, which I noticed had a large and pretty efficient-looking spring on it.
<name>Madeline</name>	Madeline	Jamila	[MASK] was accompanied by a woman who looked nineteen but I guessed was older, in her late twenties. She had a fresh, open face, with good skin. Her short hair was streaked with blue, and she wore a red and black workman's shirt and jeans.
<name>Mum</name>	Mum	Eleanor	Often we stayed in and she cooked. I was never one for education and vegetables, having been inoculated against both at school, but most nights [MASK] made me cabbage or broccoli or Brussels sprouts, steaming them and dunking them in frying butter and garlic for a few seconds.
<name>Bianca</name>	Bianca	Depression	'What fucking dog? A hot dog? Get out of the way, you bastard, she and I have business to attend to.' 'The black dog, she's got. [MASK]. So - not today, thank you. Come back another time.'
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Hero	She hadn't talked like this before, not with this clarity. The tape was running. The photographer leaned forward and whispered in the journalist's ear. 'Don't forget to ask about [MASK],' I heard him say.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Creamy	'Yes, I s'pose I did say that. I think he loves her. He hasn't exactly said it all over the place.' 'Well, [MASK], love should have its way, shouldn't it? Don't ya believe in love?'
<name>John Thaw</name>	John Thaw	Terry	The ugliness was in the people, too. Londoners seemed to hate each other. I met [MASK] for a drink while he was rehearsing more episodes of his Sergeant Monty series. He barely had time to see me, what with picketing and demonstrating and supporting various strikes.
<name>her</name>	her	Pyke	Did her last boyfriend kill himself in some dreadful way? What way? When did it happen? Why hadn't she told me? Why hadn't anyone else told me? What was going on? I was about to ask [MASK] about all this
<name>Tom Ripley</name>	Tom Ripley	Charlie	After seeing it work for so long, I began to perceive [MASK]'s charm as a method of robbing houses by persuading the owners to invite you in and take their possessions. I was in no doubt: it was robbery; there were objects of yours he wanted.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Karim	'Yes.' 'My, my, [MASK]. I must have made a mistake about you.' 1 tried to be jaunty. 'Maybe you did.' He looked at me seriously and with kindness, as if he were really seeing me. '
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Eva	That night [MASK] put me in her clean little spare room. Before getting into bed I went into the large bathroom beside her bedroom, where I hadn't been before. The bath was in the centre of the room, with an old-fashioned brass spigot.
<name>Max</name>	Max	Charlie	Please remove your watch,' he said. 'In my domain time isn't a factor.' So I put my watch on the floor and climbed the ladder to the attic, which stretched out across the top of the house. [MASK] had the whole space to himself.
<name>goths</name>	goths	Charlie	Some of the kids were as young as twelve; most were about seventeen. They were dressed like [MASK], mostly in black. Some of them had orange- or blue-streaked hair, making them look like cockatoos.
<name>Jimmy</name>	Jimmy	Simon	'What kind of full and complete nudity?' 'There are five girls here, and only [MASK] and I representing the gentlemen's side. And the girls, on the communist principle of having no shame to hide, go completely without clothes, their breasts without brassieres!
<name>her</name>	her	Eva	But I don't want to talk about the past,' I said. 'Don't you?' This stuff about him and [MASK] was really making me uncomfortable. I didn't want to know about it. 'OK,' he said at last.
<name>Meg</name>	Meg	Eva	They watched me. 'How can people just talk because they like the sound of their own voices and never think of the people around them?' 'Please/ [MASK] begged, 'don't be so rude as to not let your father finish what he's started.'
<name>England</name>	England	Indians	He was a pale man and an Englishman. This was a surprise: somehow I'd expected an Indian to be sitting with her, and when there wasn't I felt disappointed in her, as if she'd let us down. She must have had enough of [MASK].
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Karim	Television's the only medium I like.' I screwed up my face. '[MASK], I hate the theatre even more than I hate opera. It's so - ' He searched for the wrong word. 'So make-believe. But listen.
<name>Geoffrey</name>	Geoffrey	Rampage	Unfortunately, if you got too close to him you were tempted to look around for the source of the odour -perhaps there was an overdressed salad in the vicinity? But lately he'd been concealing this whiff with his favourite aftershave. [MASK].
<name>sex</name>	sex	Helen	The gesture cried out. Yes, it shouted, we are together, we touch each other without inhibition in front of strangers. Confused, I turned away, to the matter of [MASK]. 'Well?' she said gently. She desired me.
<name>David</name>	David	Terry	[MASK] was now employed; the call had come. He was playing a police sergeant in a police-station drama. This proved ideologically uncomfortable, since he'd always claimed the police were the fascist instrument of class rule.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Changez	I wanted to stagger him with my soap opera news. But when I want to stagger people I usually can't; staggered is the last thing they are. 'I'm in a soap opera,' I said, in [MASK]'s voice. 'Top pay.
<name>Hugh Masekela</name>	Hugh Masekela	Matthew	He was very talented and sensitive, thin and kind and raunchy, with this beautiful face. He knew a lot about poetry, which he'd declaim wonderfully aloud at parties. And African music was his speciality. He worked with [MASK] once, a long time ago.
<name>Beyoncé</name>	Beyoncé	Jamila	[MASK] was equally fine and fierce that day, explaining just who her damn body belonged to. And anyway, it was none of his business: didn't he have a regular fuck? He could shove his hypocrisy up his fat arse!
<name>Bernardo Bertolucci</name>	Bernardo Bertolucci	Karim	When I was nineteen, [MASK], I swore to dedicate myself to two things: to becoming a brilliant director and to sleeping with as many women as I could.' I was surprised to find him naive enough to boast of such desires.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Eva	That's all it took to get him started. He said, '[MASK] doesn't look after me now. She's too busy. I'll never get used to this new woman business. Sometimes I hate her. I know I shouldn't say it.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Eleanor	I took it for granted that [MASK] spent the evenings at parties with her friends. She often invited me, too, but I'd noticed that after a couple of hours with her crowd I felt heavy and listless.
<name>her</name>	her	Eleanor	But to be truly free we had to free ourselves of all bitterness and resentment, too. How was this possible when bitterness and resentment were generated afresh every day? I'd send [MASK] a dignified note. Then I'd have to fall out of love with her.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Pyke	I put it aside and gave him [MASK]'s cheque. He glanced at it; he looked at me. 'Bloody good work. I thought you were joking. This is terrific. Well done, mate.' 'I only had to ask him.
<name>Dean</name>	Dean	Changez	It was a mouth he wanted to get to know. One day, while we were roaming around junk shops and the Paperback Exchange, [MASK] took my arm and forced me to face him, which was never a pleasant sight.
<name>him</name>	him	Marlene	1 could have talked to him all day, gossiping and chatting as we used to in his car. But once I'd got the money I left; he didn't particularly want me there and I didn't want to get into anything with [MASK].
<name>his daughter</name>	his daughter	Jamila	The one person it didn't seem eccentric to, because he didn't notice it, was her father. He really knew little about [MASK]. If someone had asked him who she voted for, what the names of her women friends were, what she liked in life, he couldn't have answered.
<name>she</name>	she	Eleanor	My love was souring already. I was terrified [MASK] would tell me she had fallen for someone else, or would declare she was bored with me. Or I wasn't good enough for her. The usual. Fear entered my life. It entered my work.
<name>David</name>	David	Eva	At seven o'clock I came downstairs in what I knew were the right clothes for [MASK]'s evening. I wore turquoise flared trousers, a blue and white flower-patterned see-through shirt, blue suede boots with Cuban heels, and a scarlet Indian waistcoat with gold stitching around the edges.
<name>Myra</name>	Myra	Eleanor	I looked at the secretaries' legs down below and [MASK] worked out from the Evening News which play we'd see that night. Back at her place we showered, put sugar-water in our hair so we looked like porcupines, and changed into black clothes.
<name>Bridget</name>	Bridget	Karim	What are you up to?' she said. She came over to me. She brightened then. 'Give us a kiss, [MASK].' She bent forward and closed her eyes. I kissed her lips lightly. She didn't open her eyes. '
<name>Ali</name>	Ali	Allah	'No,' he replied. 'Everything gets worse.' His Muslim fatalism - [MASK] was responsible for everything -depressed me. I was always glad to get away now. I had a far more exciting project heating up over the other side of the river.
<name>Meursault</name>	Meursault	Charlie	'Let's go,' I said. We were numb; we didn't want to speak for fear of returning to our banal selves again. The wild kids bundled out. [MASK] and I elbowed our way through the crowd. Then he stopped.
<name>Marion</name>	Marion	Marlene	'Your wife's name is [MASK], isn't it?' 'Sure. If you want her, she's yours. She wants you.' 'Me? Really?' 'Yes.' 'She wants me? For what?'
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Jamila	And we can take [MASK] with us.' Without glancing at her, but filling his mouth with rice and peas until his cheeks bulged - he really was a greedy gobbler - he said, 'That would be much fun.'
<name>wife</name>	wife	Jamila	What's brought on this ecstasy?' 'But surely you will have guessed, my [MASK] is expecting.' I looked at him blankly. 'We are having a baby.' 'Your baby?' 'You bloody fool, how could that be without sexual intercourse?
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Eva	She was confused for a moment by the three of us arriving at once. And she didn't recognize me at first: I must have changed, but I didn't know how. I felt older, I knew that. [MASK] told me to wait in the hall a minute.
<name>George</name>	George	Creamy	'Oh God.' 'Yeah, but I don't like him too much anyway. He's sadistic. There'll be room in our house for someone else. Everything in our lives is going to change pretty soon. I love your old man. [MASK].
<name>Don</name>	Don	Charlie	Looking at them closely, I reckoned that the men were in advertising or design or almost artistic jobs like that. [MASK]'s dad designed advertisements. But the man in the black corduroy suit I couldn't work out at all.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Anwar	Barnacles are growing on your balls. You think of some China-thing and not the Queen!' 'To hell with the Queen! Look, [MASK], don't you ever feel you want to know yourself? That you are an enigma to yourself completely?'
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Eva	Haven't you noticed it sloshing around the country?' 'Yeah, I noticed it, [MASK], but none of it's sloshing against our house.' 'When we need it I'll draw some of it over here.'
<name>Roger</name>	Roger	Shinko	Irritating him was one of the guaranteed delights of my life. 'Go out, then,' I said. 'There's no guard stopping you, is there?' 'Shhh. Out with my friend [MASK],' he said confidentially. '
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Jean	[MASK] excelled in the business of introductions, both business and romantic. She was a local monitor of love, mediating in numerous affairs, warning, advising, cajoling and shoring up certain marriages while ripping unsuitable liaisons to shreds.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Eva	'[MASK] can be a very difficult woman, you know.' 'Yeah?' I breathed more easily now he'd changed the subject. 'The best women always are,' he went on. 'But she didn't give you the book.
<name>Pablo</name>	Pablo	Pyke	Straight out, I asked her what she'd been doing at [MASK]'s, instead of throwing her body in front of fascists. She threw back her hair, looked around the train as if for an escape and said she could say the same about me.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Charlie	'I hope so/ I said. 'Right on, man.' The girl looked at me wryly. 'Little one/ she giggled. Then she nuzzled her lips in his ear. '[MASK], can't you read to me some more?'
<name>Frank Abagnale</name>	Frank Abagnale	Charlie	This was because one strong feeling dominated me: ambition. As yet it was unfocused. But I was completely impressed by [MASK]'s big con trick, by his having knocked on the door of opportunity and its opening up to him, its goods tumbling out.
<name>Mrs. Ramsay</name>	Mrs. Ramsay	Anwar	If only the women could grasp my points of view. They will begin to understand only when the boy gets here. Then they will see, eh?' I also learned in the store-room-of-secrets that [MASK] was looking forward to having grandchildren.
<name>Beloved</name>	Beloved	Jamila	There is space, there are servants, chauffeurs.' 'But you are my wife.' 'Only legally,' she said gently. 'You will always be my wife. The legal is nothing, I understand that. But in my heart you are my [MASK].'
<name>David</name>	David	Charlie	There were books: it was a classy place, not the usual rock-star's hang-out. But then, I couldn't consider [MASK] a rock-star. It didn't seem of his essence, but a temporary, borrowed persona.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Creamy	[MASK]. You always do what you want anyway. You listen to no one. But myself, I couldn't go to his place. I'm worried that they're taking you over, these people. You're moving away from the real world.'
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Charlie	He waited for me to speak. I never thought he would look at me like this. We went upstairs, where [MASK] had prepared the room. It was dark, illuminated only by candles, one on each side of the bed, and three on the bookshelves.
<name>Mr. Keating</name>	Mr. Keating	Charlie	I was on top of my desk! It was like some weird pagan ritual. You shoulda bin there, man.' I knew immediately from the look on [MASK]'s face that I'd been an animal, a philistine, a child.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Eva	I looked fit and well; it must have been the vegetables. The press-ups and 'I must, I must increase my bust' exercises which [MASK] had recommended were also achieving their aim of sharpening my profile and increasing my confidence.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Heater	'What d'you want. [MASK]! Why don't you fuck off and die of cancer, you fat, ugly, pseudy cunt?' He adjusted his position so that he stood solidly with his feet apart, his weight evenly distributed. He was ready for me.
<name>Mowgli</name>	Mowgli	Kipling	Maybe I can buy it today.' 'Stop being so rational,' he said. 'It's The Jungle Book. [MASK]. You know it, of course.' 'Yeah, I've seen the film.' 'I'm sure.'
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Shadwell	Yes, [MASK] had let her down. But I knew that nothing would ever discourage him; he'd never give up wanting to be a director, and he'd never be any good. So that was it.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Ted	As we moved around the carriage to make way for him - no one joined in - [MASK] stabbed the seats and tore the stuffing out of them. Finally he thrust an unbroken lightbulb at me and pointed at the open window. 'Go on, enjoy yerself, it's Saturday.'
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Eva	This woman I barely knew, [MASK], had stolen my father. But what did I really think of her? I hadn't even looked at her properly. This new part of my life wasn't a woman who would seem attractive straight-on in a passport photograph.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Eva	Why? Why? Don't interfere, [MASK],' he said, as she came into the room, alarmed by our shouting. 'This boy is a complete dead loss. So what will you do, eh?' 'I want to think.'
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Changez	I felt too tired to walk upstairs, so when [MASK] went out I lay down behind the sofa, pulling a blanket over me. The floor was hard; I couldn't sleep. The world was swaying about like a hammock with my body on it.
<name>Andy</name>	Andy	Pyke	I wore an unbuttoned Hawaiian shirt which I sometimes knotted on my stomach. One of the stage-managers almost stopped breathing when she saw me, I'm not kidding. We each sat in what [MASK] called 'the hot seat' with the group arranged in a staring semi-circle around us.
<name>Lillian</name>	Lillian	Carol	There were servants with silver trays, and a black man played 'As Time Goes By' on the piano. I recognized various actors, and was told that agents and journalists and publishers were there too. [MASK] went from person to person introducing herself.
<name>David</name>	David	Pyke	On the fourth day, sitting there at ten in the morning with all of us gathered around him, [MASK] played a game which disturbed me, which made me think there was a shadow side to him. Looking slyly around the group he said he would predict which of us would sleep together.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Eva	[MASK] had hinted that significant events were going to take place. 'What are they?' I asked her all the time. 'I can't tell you unless you're here,' she said, teasingly. I had no idea what she was talking about.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Eva	He came out of the phone-box and I pushed my bicycle beside him through the crowds. I badly wanted to know his opinion on the Anwar business, but obviously he wasn't in the mood for it now. 'How's [MASK]?' I asked.
<name>Jimmy</name>	Jimmy	Terry	[MASK] was confident. 'He'll be over. He's very cold - you know what middle-class people are like. No feelings. I reckon he wants my working-class experience to give his puerile political ideas some authenticity.' 'Say no/
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Shadwell	It was primarily an amateur place, but they did do three professional productions a year, mostly of plays on the school curriculum like The Royal Hunt of the Sun. When I finished, [MASK] started to applaud with the tips of his fingers, as if scared his hands would give each other a disease.
<name>she</name>	she	Eva	He and [MASK] argued about this: she thought him indulgent. But how could it honestly be otherwise? There were occasions when we were watching TV or just eating when waves of regret rippled across his face. Regret and guilt and pain just overwhelmed him.
<name>the makeup artist</name>	the makeup artist	Shadwell	So I kept my mouth shut even as her hands lathered me in the colour of dirt. A few days later I did question [MASK] about the possibility of not being covered in shit for my debut as a professional actor.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Ted	'No,' she said. I kissed her and held her and tried to get out of the house without saying goodbye to anyone. I crept downstairs and was outside and successfully making for the front gate when [MASK] sprinted around the side of the house and grabbed me.
<name>Sebastian</name>	Sebastian	Allie	[MASK] and I loved running among this reeking mob, the air thick with aftershave and perfume. We served cocktails and offered strawberries and cream and gateaux, and cheese and chocolates, and sometimes, in exchange, women pinched our cheeks, and we tried to stick our hands up their daughters' skirts.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Karim	I'd met and the magazines I'd been interviewed for. He ignored me and filled his bulging face. As I went on, he said suddenly, 'You're in bloody shit, [MASK]. And what are you going to do about it?
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Eva	He took to the Cobra position as if it had been designed for him. Unlike me, he seemed to enjoy appearing foolish, thinking he had become a new, open person. [MASK] encouraged us to play, but she was a shrewd boss too.
<name>Mrs. Nakamura</name>	Mrs. Nakamura	Shinko	When he emerged I saw behind him at the door a small, black-haired, middle-aged Japanese woman in a red kimono. 'Her name is [MASK],' he told me happily as we walked back to the flat.
<name>He</name>	He	Eva	But ultimately, it will defeat you.' After this, he said no more. [MASK] and I looked at him and waited, but he'd done. The journalist switched the cassette-player off and put the tapes in her bag.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Charlie	The next thing I saw was [MASK] sprinting through the traffic towards them. He dodged behind a bus and I thought he'd been knocked down. When he re-emerged he was ripping his shirt off - it was my shirt, too.
<name>He</name>	He	Ted	After all, they now had no income. [MASK] used to boast, 'I've got ten men under me,' and now he had none. There was nothing under him but thin air and the abyss of bankruptcy.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Marlene	I looked at [MASK], who was standing behind us, talking to an actor. 'I don't know where to begin.' 'Tell me something you think might interest me.' And he looked at me with full concentration. I had no choice.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Charlie	What d'you mean?' So: I had him. He'd walked right into it. 'What do I mean?' 'Yeah,' he said. 'To go somewhere you gotta be talented, [MASK]. You got to have it upstairs.'
<name>He</name>	He	Changez	Then [MASK] took my arm and looked into my eyes. He became unhappy. What a sentimental creature he was. 'Can I tell you something?' He looked into the distance - through the window and into the next-door neighbour's kitchen. '
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Charlie	Then he stopped. 'What is it, [MASK]?' 'I've got to get backstage and talk to those guys.' I snorted. 'Why would they want to talk to you?' I thought he'd hit me; but he took it well.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Changez	I am beginning to think he is totally perverted too, the way he likes to squeeze my body. I explain to him, what am I, an orange? I say - ' '[MASK], it's late and - ' '
<name>Jamie</name>	Jamie	Charlie	I even reached out and pinched one of them lightly, for scientific confirmation. Warmish! Oh, [MASK]. My heart yearned for his hot ears against my chest. But he had neither phoned since our last love-making nor bothered to turn up here.
<name>Yoko</name>	Yoko	Charlie	The girl dragged at his arm. At last he said, 'I don't know about that. I'm breaking up the band anyway. What you've said isn't relevant.' [MASK] turned and walked out. The next day he disappeared again.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Changez	My father paid the rent on our flat, but those days are gone. You'll have to support yourself.' And she added tentatively, 'You might have to work.' This was too much. [MASK] looked at me anxiously. 'Exciting, huh?'
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Charlie	And it was at this moment, as she blew out a candle, lubricated it and forced it up his arse, that I realized I didn't love [MASK] any more. I didn't care either for or about him. He didn't interest me at all.
<name>the victim</name>	the victim	Anwar	You look like a motor-mechanic,' I said. He beamed back at me. Among other things he was pleased that the assault case against him had been dropped, once it was certain that [MASK] had died of a heart attack. '
<name>Leo</name>	Leo	Ted	[MASK] went in for it all with great, childlike alacrity. He took to the Cobra position as if it had been designed for him. Unlike me, he seemed to enjoy appearing foolish, thinking he had become a new, open person.
<name>James</name>	James	Eleanor	After the kiss, when I stood in the darkened room and looked out on the street, my knees gave way. '[MASK], I won't be able to cycle home,' I said. 'I think I've lost the use of my legs.'
<name>Steve</name>	Steve	Charlie	The rooms' great spaces were interrupted by busted brown furniture. There wasn't even a bed for me; I slept on the sofa in the front room. [MASK], who also had nowhere to go, sometimes slept on the floor beside me.
<name>Shafiq</name>	Shafiq	Jeremy	Try it until you feel comfortable as a Bengali. You're supposed to be an actor, but I suspect you may just be an exhibitionist.' '[MASK], help me, I can't do this.' He shook his head.
<name>Elvis</name>	Elvis	Bowie	He stood out from the rest of the mob with his silver hair and stacked shoes. He looked less winsome and poetic now; his face was harder, with short hair, the cheekbones more pronounced. It was [MASK]'s influence, I knew.
<name>mate</name>	mate	Changez	She was stuck with him now. There was no way out. She said: 'But you'll have to pay your way, [MASK]. That's how I don't see it happening. My father paid the rent on our flat, but those days are gone.
