<name>Chinedu</name>	Chinedu	Nneoma	His mother is my father’s sister, the professor,” [MASK] said. “She is the one that paid my school fees from beginning to end. If not for her, I don’t know where I would be today.” “Wonderful, wonderful!”
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Obinze	The days drained into one another, crisp air turning to freezing air, painful to inhale. [MASK] called many times but she did not pick up her phone. She deleted his voice messages unheard and his e-mails unread, and she felt herself sinking, sinking quickly, and unable to pull herself up.
<name>Obinze</name>	Obinze	Obinze	wey they deport, him don come back get him paper. Na him wey go help me,” another said. [MASK] envied them for what they were, men who casually changed names and passports, who would plan and come back and do it over again because they had nothing to lose.
<name>Justin</name>	Justin	Curt	[MASK] walked in, his blue eyes bluer, and said he wanted to talk to the manager right away. “You are going to fucking do my girlfriend’s eyebrows or I’ll shut down this fucking place. You don’t deserve to have a license.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Ginika	“It’s not as if you are earning much.” “At least I am earning some,” [MASK] quipped. “I really hope I find a job soon.” “You will, don’t worry.”
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Ifemelu	[MASK] was struck by how arresting, how attractive, she was. No longer a ropy mass of gangly arms and gangly legs, but now a big, firm, curvy woman, exulting in her weight and height, and it made her imposing, a presence that drew the eyes.
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Kayode	Ceiling, I don’t even know how to start. I ran into [MASK] today at the mall. Saying sorry for my silence sounds stupid even to me hut I am so sorry and I feel so stupid. I will tell you everything that happened.
<name>Yoko</name>	Yoko	Ifemelu	He lay on his belly, and [MASK] straddled him, massaging his back and neck and thighs with her fingers, her knuckles, her elbows. He was painfully taut. She stood on him, placed one foot gingerly on the back of a thigh, and then the other.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Curtis	I’ll get a copy of my bank statement tomorrow.” “[MASK],” she said, a little sternly, to make him be reasonable, but standing there looking down at the city from so high up, she was already caught in the whirl of his excitement.
<name>Obama</name>	Obama	Princeton	That Nigerian girl, she feels very important because of [MASK]. Look at her food bar, she does not eat real food anymore. They would laugh with derision, but only a mild derision, because she was still their African sister, even if she had briefly lost her way.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Ifemelu	“Girls, please finish the meeting. I am taking my daughter to shop for a dress and I have an afternoon meeting with our distributors.” [MASK] was tired, bored. She thought, again, of starting a blog.
<name>David</name>	David	Emenike	“I’ve never gone abroad but my father has promised that I will go for university. I wish I could just apply for my visa now instead of waiting to finish school,” [MASK] said. After he spoke, a hushed silence followed.
<name>Obinze</name>	Obinze	Blaine	How else will she know what hair like mine feels like? She probably doesn’t know any black people.” “And so you have to be her guinea pig?” [MASK] asked. He expected her to feel what she did not know how to feel.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Curt	Alone in her apartment, she cried and cried, crumpled on her living room rug that was so rarely used it still smelled of the store. Her relationship with [MASK] was what she wanted, a crested wave in her life, and yet she had taken an axe and hacked at it.
<name>He</name>	He	Obinze	I’m going to talk to her about this when you leave. If she wants to talk to anybody, it should be me.” “She said I should never come here again. That I am misleading her son.” [MASK] blinked. “What?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ranyinudo	There was, also, a strained nostalgia in those reunions, some in [MASK]’s flat, some in hers, some in restaurants, because she struggled to find, in these adult women, some remnants from her past that were often no longer there.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Obinze	She could not imagine calling [MASK] to ask him for reduced rent in one of his properties. Still, she did not know why she had not called him at all. She had thought of it many times, often bringing out her phone to scroll to his number, and yet she had not called.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Ifemelu	At least he still did not go to church. [MASK] used to come home from church with her mother and find him sitting on the floor in the living room, sifting through his pile of LPs, and singing along to a song on the stereo.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Chief	“Ever young!” “Ah, my dear, I try, I try.” [MASK] jokingly tugged at the satin lapels of his black jacket. He did look well, spare and upright, unlike many of his peers who looked like pregnant men.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Shan	She had that really unbearable politeness that is worse than any insult, you know? And so she tells me how booksellers love the cover already and blah blah blah. It’s ridiculous,” [MASK] said. “It’s the herd instinct of corporate publishing.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Kimberly	She just got up and went into the bathroom and stayed there,” he said. “I left it on the bed.” “It’s okay, honey, she’ll come around,” [MASK] said, hugging him, rubbing his back.
<name>Obinze</name>	Obinze	Obinze	“Do something for him” meant give him money and [MASK], all of a sudden, hated that tendency of Igbo people to resort to euphemism whenever they spoke of money, to indirect references, to gesturing instead of pointing. Find something for this person.
<name>Amir</name>	Amir	Ojiugo	[MASK] often asked, “But are they treating you well? Are they treating you well?” as though the treatment was what mattered, rather than the blighted reality of it all, that he was in a holding center, about to be deported.
<name>Adichie</name>	Adichie	Halima	“I’ve been here a long time. It doesn’t make much of a difference.” “No,” [MASK] said, suddenly animated, standing behind the woman. “When I come here with my son they beat him in school because of African accent.
<name>Jamal</name>	Jamal	Dike	She closed the novel; it was too hot to concentrate. She ate some melted chocolate, sent [MASK] a text to call her when he was finished with basketball practice, and fanned herself. She read the signs on the opposite wall—NO ADJUSTMENTS TO BRAIDS AFTER ONE WEEK.
<name>Tiffany</name>	Tiffany	Manama	The longer you are here, the more you start to get it. CHAPTER l8 [MASK]’s new customer was wearing jeans shorts, the denim glued to her backside, and sneakers the same bright pink shade as her top. Large hoop earrings grazed her face.
<name>Anya</name>	Anya	Ifemelu	Before, there would have been cooking and bustling, many pots in the kitchen and many relatives in the flat, and [MASK] and her mother would have gone to night mass, and held up lit candles, singing in a sea of flickering flames, and then come home to continue cooking the big Easter lunch.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Obinze	“Seeing him upset you?” “No” “Was he like a boyfriend or something?” “No,” she said, looking out of the window. Later that day she would send an e-mail to [MASK]’s Hotmail address:
<name>Yemi</name>	Yemi	Cleotilde	Did they have a list of young women with European Union passports who needed money? [MASK] pushed at her hair, a mass of tight coils, and adjusted her glasses, as though first preparing herself before she presented her passport and license.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Ifemelu	Her father said, “You must refrain from your natural proclivity towards provocation, [MASK]. You have singled yourself out at school where you are known for insubordination and I have told you that it has already sullied your singular academic record.
<name>us</name>	us	Ginika	“Hi, ladies, how are you? Is there anything I can help you with?” she asked in a tinkly, singsong voice. She pulled clothes off hangers and unfurled them from shelves to show [MASK].
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Kemi	My son sticks out, so how can you tell me that you don’t see any difference? I refused completely that they should put him in a special class. He is brighter than all of them combined. They want to start now to mark him. [MASK] warned me about this.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Kosi	Or we could act. I want to act. I want this to happen. [MASK] is a good woman and my marriage was a kind of floating-along contentment, but I should never have married her. I always knew that something was missing.
<name>Chika</name>	Chika	Ojiugo	But [MASK] was not offended. She shrugged and said, “Then I will just carry my bag and go and stand in front of their house.” It puzzled him that she did not mourn all the things she could have been.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Blaine	But I think for him it was the principle of it. He can be ridiculously high-minded sometimes. Give him a day or two, he’ll get over this.” But a day passed, then two, and [MASK] remained caged in his frozen silence.
<name>Amara</name>	Amara	Ifemelu	There was nothing else to say. They owed rent. Her mother appeared, singing and heavily perfumed, her face dry and bright with powder that was one shade too light. She extended a wrist towards [MASK]’s father, her thin gold bracelet hung unclasped.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Curt	She was burrowing under the covers as though to hide. “It’s not as bad as you think,” he said. “At least you finally accept that it’s bad.” [MASK] laughed. “You know what I mean. Come here.”
<name>Yolanda</name>	Yolanda	Manama	A customer came in, her hair covered in a bright yellow headwrap. “Hi,” she said. “I’d like to get braids.” “What kind of braids you want?” [MASK] asked. “Just regular box braids, medium size.”
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Ifemelu	She had been standing by the door as though waiting to be dismissed, listening in on the conversation. “I am taking the medicine for typhoid.” “You have typhoid?” [MASK] asked. “Didn’t you notice how she looked on Monday?
<name>he</name>	he	Dike	“And I’ll talk to your mom about not making you wear it again.” She cajoled until finally [MASK] agreed, as long as he could wear sneakers, not the lace-ups his mother wanted. “I’m coming up this weekend,” she told him.
<name>Ifemelu</name>	Ifemelu	Kimberly	I love multicultural names because they have such wonderful meanings, from wonderful rich cultures.” [MASK] was smiling the kindly smile of people who thought “culture” the unfamiliar colorful reserve of colorful people, a word that always had to be qualified with “rich.”
<name>Chinedu</name>	Chinedu	Edusco	“The Yoruba man is there helping his brother, but you Igbo people? I ga-asikwa. Look at you now quoting me this price.” “Okay, [MASK], why don’t I give you the land for free?
<name>Yewande</name>	Yewande	Mummy	She wanted to see them, but the thought of their visit exhausted her. She was not sure she would be able to be their daughter, the person they remembered. “[MASK], things are very busy at work now.” “Ahn-ahn.
<name>Aunty</name>	Aunty	Ifemelu	Carry go! Your car is safe!” The fried plantain hawker tried to persuade [MASK] to buy fried sweet potatoes as well. “No, only plantain.” “What about akara, aunty? I make am now. Very fresh.”
<name>David</name>	David	Obinze	But the money was safely in her account. And now, as she walked into the bank, she saw [MASK] at the customer service section. He was standing with his back to her and she knew, from the height and the shape of the head, that it was him.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Blaine	The seat next to [MASK] was the only empty one in that car, as far as she could see, and the newspaper and bottle of juice placed on it seemed to be his. She stopped, gesturing towards the seat, but he kept his gaze levelly ahead.
<name>John</name>	John	Obinze	People who have survived frightful wars must absolutely be allowed in!” She turned to [MASK]. “Don’t you agree?” “Yes,” he said, and felt alienation run through him like a shiver.
<name>Yvette</name>	Yvette	Manama	Her customer said, “It’s cute,” as she paid [MASK], and shortly after she left, a young white woman came in, soft-bodied and tanned, her hair held back in a loose ponytail. “Hi!” she said.
<name>Nina</name>	Nina	Obinze	It amused [MASK], how keenly the men flipped through their newspapers every morning, stopping at the photo of the big-breasted woman, examining it as though it were an article of great interest, and were any different from the photo on that same page the previous day, the previous week.
<name>Ifemelu</name>	Ifemelu	Zemaye	“If you say something he doesn’t like, he will stop talking and start humming. Seriously humming, loud humming. How does a grown man behave so immaturely?” it was Monday morning. IfemeluwasreadingPosthourgie, her favorite American blog. [MASK] was looking through a stash of glossy photographs.
<name>Chinedu</name>	Chinedu	Vincent	“[MASK], my brother here is trying to save money and do his papers. Thirty-five is too much, o rika, btko. Please just try and help us.” “You know that some people take half.
<name>Kambili</name>	Kambili	Obinze	[MASK] had always been struck by how important it was to her to be a wholesomely agreeable person, to have no sharp angles sticking out. On Sundays, she would invite his relatives for pounded yam and onugbu soup and then watch over to make sure everyone was suitably overfed.
<name>Obama</name>	Obama	Obama	His pastor is scary because it means maybe [MASK] is not the Magic Negro after all. By the way, the pastor is pretty melodramatic, but have you been to an old school American Black church? Pure theater.
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	Ifemelu	It felt, to [MASK], like a weak copy, a floundering imitation of what she had imagined it would be. After he pulled away, jerking and gasping and holding himself, a discomfort nagged at her. She had been tense through it all, unable to relax.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Evenings	She wondered whether they were paid on commission. Would his paycheck be bigger if she did switch her phone company? Because she would, as long as it cost her nothing. “[MASK],” she said. “May I ask who I’m talking to?”
<name>Chika</name>	Chika	Ifemelu	She said somebody in her church got promoted after fasting with the handkerchief.” “Is that what that handkerchief on her table was about?” [MASK] asked. “But I believe miracles totally work? I know my aunt was cured of cancer in her church?”
<name>Yasmeen</name>	Yasmeen	Wambui	More people should read this. You should start a blog.” Blogs were new, unfamiliar to her. But telling [MASK] what happened was not satisfying enough; she longed for other listeners, and she longed to hear the stories of others. How many other people chose silence?
<name>Felicity</name>	Felicity	Ifemelu	[MASK] gazed at them. There was a certain luxury to charity that she could not identify with and did not have. To take "charity” for granted, to revel in this charity towards people whom one did not know—perhaps it came from having had yesterday and having today and expecting to have tomorrow.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Emenike	[MASK] sipped his beer. It was his third and he had become looser and louder. All his stories about work had the same arc: somebody would first underestimate or belittle him, and he would then end up victorious, with the final clever word or action.
<name>Okechukwu</name>	Okechukwu	Don	Earlier, on the drive back from the airport, she had said, as she slowed down to sink into, and then climb out of, a large pothole, “I really want [MASK] to change this car. He has been promising for the past three months.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Obinze	And [MASK] swiftly replied, “Yes, but she said I have only an hour.” She liked that he wore their relationship so boldly, like a brightly colored shirt. Sometimes she worried that she was too happy.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Blaine	“Yes” They held each other in the dark, saying nothing, their breathing regular until finally they drifted into a state of half sleep and half wakefulness. In the morning, they went to the high school; [MASK] wanted to be one of the first to vote.
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Ifemelu	It was what she least expected to hear. “I have to lose weight first,” she said. “You’re just afraid.” Before [MASK] left, they sat on the couch and drank malt and watched the latest celebrity news on E!.
<name>Ravi</name>	Ravi	Fred	There was laughter. [MASK] said a good vegetarian place would open soon, now that there was so much new investment in the country; somebody would figure out that there was a vegetarian market to cater to. “A vegetarian restaurant?
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Ifemelu	He went out job hunting every morning, teeth clenched and tie firmly knotted, and [MASK] wondered if he just walked into random companies to try his luck, but soon he began to stay at home in a wrapper and singlet, lounging on the shabby sofa near the stereo.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ifemelu	From the verandah, [MASK] began to cry because she sensed that something had happened, and the woman standing by the fire, splashing in more kerosene as it dimmed and stepping back as it flared, the woman who was bald and blank, was not her mother, could not be her mother.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Ifemelu	She’s been after me since. She won’t leave me alone. She knows I have a girlfriend.” [MASK] stared at one of the photos, a profile shot in black-and-white, the woman’s head thrown back, her long hair flowing behind her.
<name>She</name>	She	Ifemelu	“ I will not pay you what we agreed, no way, because you have not done what we agreed.” The tile man was staring at her, eyes narrowed. “And if you want trouble, trust me, you will get it,” [MASK] said.
<name>Stoner</name>	Stoner	Boubacar	He stood at the door and told [MASK] that he was leaving on a sabbatical and the department was ordering sandwiches the next day as a going-away lunch for him, and he had been told they were fancy sandwiches with such things as alfalfa sprouts.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Fred	[MASK] laughed, too heartily, to let her know he was on her side. “It’s not just about the technical stuff,” the New Haven woman said. “The industry is regressive. I mean, the portrayal of women?
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Obinze	She was pleasant and direct, even warm, but there was a privacy about her, a reluctance to bare herself completely to the world, the same quality as [MASK]. She had taught her son the ability to be, even in the middle of a crowd, somehow comfortably inside himself.
<name>Ifemelu</name>	Ifemelu	Bose	She just called now to tell me that she read online about an eleven-year-old girl who got grade five distinction and did not get into the National Children’s Orchestra. Why would she call just to tell me that negative story?” “Enemy of progress!” [MASK] said.
<name>him</name>	him	Obinze	But a month passed and still she kept [MASK] sealed in silence, gagged her own mind so that she would think of him as little as possible. She still deleted his e-mails unread. Many times she started to write to him, she crafted e-mails, and then stopped and discarded them.
<name>Obama</name>	Obama	Paula	Even that nebulous unease when she was around [MASK], part churlishness and part insecurity had melted away. They gathered at bars and apartments, discussing details of the campaign, mocking the silliness of the news stories. Will Hispanics vote for a black man? Can he bowl?
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Obinze	Sometimes, her friends visited and they would sit in the kitchen talking until they all dashed off to pick up their children. In those weeks of willing the phone to ring, [MASK] came to know their voices well. He could hear clearly from the tiny bedroom upstairs where he lay in bed reading.
<name>Chika</name>	Chika	Ranyinudo	“I can’t remember the last time I watched that stupid station,” [MASK] said. “They he for the government but they can’t even lie well.” “So which Nigerian channel do you watch?” “I don’t even really watch any o. I watch Style and E!
<name>Anastasia</name>	Anastasia	Ifemelu	I am sorry to disappoint you, after everything you have done for me, and I beg you to forgive me. But I will make the best of this situation. The General is a responsible man. He will take care of his child.” [MASK]’s father shrugged wordlessly.
<name>Obinze</name>	Obinze	Curt	It was easier not to tell them about [MASK]. “What are your employment prospects?” her father asked. Her graduation was approaching, her student visa expiring. “I have been assigned to a career counselor, and I’m meeting her next week,” she said.
<name>Chimamanda</name>	Chimamanda	Mwombeki	Many of the internationals understand the trauma of trying to get an American visa and that is a good place to start a friendship.” There was more laughter, [MASK] himself laughing loudly, as though he had not heard his own jokes before.
<name>Pi</name>	Pi	Ifemelu	CHAPTER 55 One day, [MASK] saw the male peacock dance, its feathers fanned out in a giant halo. The female stood by pecking at something on the ground and then, after a while, it walked away, indifferent to the male’s great flare of feathers.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Obinze	It was [MASK]. “How are you?” he asked. “Groggy. Not sure what happened yesterday. Did you seduce me?” “I’m glad your door has a dead bolt. I would have hated to wake you up to lock the door.”
<name>Raj</name>	Raj	Iloba	‘‘Fifteen minutes to go,” [MASK] said. He had appointed himself the organizer. He took pictures, his digital camera held away from his face, saying, “Move closer! Okay, one more!”
<name>Magic</name>	Magic	Obama	He always forgives all kinds of racist shit. He teaches the white person how to break down the sad but understandable prejudice in his heart. You see this man in many films. And [MASK] is straight from central casting. CHAPTER 36
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Ifemelu	“Snack time!” he said, with a teasing grin; he still did not understand why anybody would want to eat both together. While [MASK] ate, he sat on the bed and told her about school.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Obinze	But after she hung up, she thought endlessly of [MASK]. Imagining him at his wedding left her with a feeling like sorrow, a faded sorrow. But she was pleased for him, she told herself, and to prove to herself that she was pleased for him, she decided to write him.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Ojiugo	Can I watch TV? Just for ten minutes?” “Okay, ten minutes.” It was the half-hour break after their homework and before their French tutor arrived, and [MASK] was making jam sandwiches, carefully cutting off the crusts.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Don	Then she noticed a movement on the other end of the deck. It was [MASK]. There was something furtive about him and she felt rather than saw that he had just ended a cell phone conversation. “Great party” he told her.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Obinze	I could give you this bird’s number,” be said once. “I have a girlfriend back home,” [MASK] said. “So what’s wrong with a little shag then?” A few men nearby laughed.
<name>John</name>	John	Ifemelu	“Are your potatoes the frozen imported ones, or do you cut and fry your potatoes?” The waiter looked offended. “It is the imported frozen ones.” As the waiter walked away, [MASK] said, “Those frozen things taste horrible.”
<name>John</name>	John	Bartholomew	“Both of us work. Both of us come home at the same time and do you know what [MASK] does? He just sits in the living room and turns on the TV and asks me what we are eating for (dinner.”
<name>Condoleezza</name>	Condoleezza	Obama	(There is no knowing what her texture will be. It is not unusual for a black woman to have three different textures on her head.) She would totally rock but poor [MASK] would certainly lose the independent vote, even the undecided Democrat vote.
<name>James</name>	James	Nosa	He called other friends. [MASK], who had left right after graduation, picked him up at the tube station and drove him to a pub where other friends soon gathered. They shook hands and slapped backs and drank draft beer. They laughed about memories from school.
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Obinze	They were seated at the very back, in the last row of seats, closest to the toilet. [MASK] sat unmoving throughout the flight. He did not want his tray of food. “No, thank you,” he said to the flight attendant.
<name>Trisha</name>	Trisha	Esther	But developers were renovating and dismantling now, and on the ground floor of a newly refurbished three-story building, heavy glass doors opened into a reception area painted a terra-cotta orange, where a pleasant-faced receptionist, [MASK], sat, and behind her loomed giant words in silver: ZOE magazine.
<name>Obinze</name>	Obinze	Curt	One day, at the farmers’ market, as she stood hand in hand with [MASK] in front of a tray of apples, a black man walked past and muttered, "You ever wonder why he likes you looking all jungle like that?”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Kosi	A multilayered guilt weighed him down, guilt not only for wanting to leave [MASK], but for having married her at all. He could not first marry her, knowing very well that he should not have done so, and now, with a child, want to leave her.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Obinze	Were going to see a play.” She turned to her son and added, “You’re not taking that Game Boy in, you know that.” The boy ignored her, said “Bye” to [MASK], and turned towards the door.
<name>her</name>	her	Ifemelu	writhing to be let free, with a strength that frightened [MASK]. Perhaps the child would end up being a serial murderer, like those women on television crime documentaries, standing half-naked on dark roads to lure truck drivers and then strangle them.
<name>Obinze</name>	Obinze	Coz	“It was so much nicer then,” she told him. He stood looking at the house for a while, until the gateman said, “Yes? Any problem?” and they got back into the car. “Can I drive, [MASK]?”
<name>Chika</name>	Chika	Blaine	Behind her, a woman was pulling along a heavy suitcase and the conductor was announcing that all personal belongings had to be moved from free seats and [MASK] saw her standing there—how could he possibly not see her?—and still he did nothing. So her Mr. Agbo Voice emerged.
