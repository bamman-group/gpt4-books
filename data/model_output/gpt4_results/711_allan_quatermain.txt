<name>Ayesha</name>	Ayesha	Nyleptha	Then came another silence, and [MASK] looked up and caught my eye; it seemed to me that there was meaning in her glance, and I watched it narrowly. From my eye it travelled down to the brazen flooring, on the outer edge of which we stood.
<name>Umslopogaas</name>	Umslopogaas	Macumazahn	With these eyes have I seen it once, and twice also. Ah, [MASK], we shall see this fine place of houses burning yet, and hear the battle cries come ringing up the street. After all, I have not wandered for nothing.
<name>Isaura</name>	Isaura	Sorais	To be heartless--that is to conquer all. Passion is like the lightning, it is beautiful, and it links the earth to heaven, but alas it blinds! ‘And thou thinkest that my sister [MASK] would levy war upon me. So be it.
<name>Flora</name>	Flora	Nasta	‘Oh, surely, [MASK], I will come, and the strange lords in my train, and for every man of thy mountaineers who calls thee Prince, will I bring two from the lowlands who call me Queen, and we will see which is the staunchest breed.
<name>Umslopogaas</name>	Umslopogaas	Belusha	Another mighty lord, named [MASK], who lived in the great horse-breeding district, had come in with twelve thousand cavalry, and so on. Indeed, what between one thing and another, it seemed certain that she would gather a fully armed host of nearly one hundred thousand men.
<name>thyself</name>	thyself	Sorais	That is human nature, which the Positivists tell us is just perfection; so no doubt it is all right. ‘And what art thou going to do with [MASK]?’ I asked her. Instantly her bright brow darkened to a frown.
<name>Umslopogaas</name>	Umslopogaas	Umbopa	Once before we three journeyed thus, in search of adventure, and we took with us a man such as thou--one [MASK]; and, behold, we left him the king of a great country, with twenty Impis (regiments), each of 3,000 plumed warriors, waiting on his word.
<name>Alnaschar</name>	Alnaschar	Incubu	It is not wise to neglect the present for the future, for who knows what the future will be, [MASK]? Let us pluck our flowers while the dew is on them, for when the sun is up they wither and on the morrow will others bloom that we shall never see.’
<name>Umslopogaas</name>	Umslopogaas	Alphonse	Now some fifteen paces back from the kraal wall stood a very ancient tree of the banyan species. So ancient was it that all the inside had in the course of ages decayed away, leaving nothing but a shell of bark. ‘[MASK],’ I called, as I walked down the wall.
<name>Stanhope</name>	Stanhope	Nyleptha	My horse was speedily killed under me, but luckily I had a fresh one, my own favourite, a coal-black mare [MASK] had given me, being held in reserve behind, and on this I afterwards mounted.
<name>Providence</name>	Providence	Providence	‘Adventurer’--he that goes out to meet whatever may come. Well, that is what we all do in the world one way or another, and, speaking for myself, I am proud of the title, because it implies a brave heart and a trust in [MASK].
<name>Sirius</name>	Sirius	Sorais	But now all this had changed; the coy Nyleptha smiled no more in his direction, and he was not slow to guess the cause. Infuriated and alarmed, he turned his attention to [MASK], only to find that he might as well try to woo a mountain side.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Kara	[MASK] here will let out the maids.’ She turned, and selecting two of the crowd of damsels, repeated the words I had uttered, giving them besides a list of the names of the men to whom each should run.
<name>Alonso</name>	Alonso	Umslopogaas	Leaving [MASK] to hold the horses, I hobbled to the spring and drank deep of its sweet waters. I had had nothing but a single mouthful of wine since midday, when the battle began, and I was parched up, though my fatigue was too great to allow me to feel hungry.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Umslopogaas	The unconscious sentry commenced to hum a little tune, and [MASK] crept on. He reached the shelter of the mimosa bush unperceived and there waited. Still the sentry walked up and down. Presently he turned and looked over the wall into the camp.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Nyleptha	He had flatly refused to celebrate it, or to allow any of his priests to do so, whereupon [MASK] became very angry and told him that she, as Queen, was head of the Church, and meant to be obeyed.
<name>Umslopogaas</name>	Umslopogaas	Macumazahn	Listen now, [MASK], thou who art very clever and old in war. What says the maid? These men eat and make merry; let it be their funeral feast. What said the dog whom I hope to hew down at daybreak?
<name>Wolfgang</name>	Wolfgang	Kara	So. Now summon the officer in the ante-room. He is a trusty man.’ I did as I was bid! and the man, a veteran and quiet-looking gentleman of the guard, named [MASK], entered, bowing low.
<name>Alpheus</name>	Alpheus	Good	she said, addressing [MASK], who was standing close to her, in a low, concentrated voice. ‘Thou pale-souled fool, for a reward thou shalt eat out thy heart with love of me and not be satisfied, and thou mightest have been my husband and a king!
<name>Quasimodo</name>	Quasimodo	Alphonse	‘Wouldst thou kill the man? Pull him out of the bush!’ With a savage grunt he obeyed, seizing the wretched [MASK] by the ankle, and with a jerk that must have nearly dislocated it, tearing him out of the heart of the shrub.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Umslopogaas	It is not half won yet. The soldiers would think you were making a bolt of it. Quick now.’ In a moment he was down, and at my bidding [MASK] sprang into the empty saddle. ‘Now farewell,’ I said.
<name>McWhirter</name>	McWhirter	Alphonse	His first step was to get [MASK], who was thoroughly competent in such matters, to trim his hair and beard in the most approved fashion. I think that if he had had some hot water and a cake of soap at hand he would have shaved off the latter; but he had not.
<name>Umslopogaas</name>	Umslopogaas	Umslopogaas	[MASK], too, had his axe, of which no effort had been made to deprive him, and now he whirled it round his head and sent his piercing Zulu war-shout echoing up the marble walls in fine defiant fashion.
<name>Reader</name>	Reader	Alas	The heroic blood of my grandfather boiled up in me. I rushed into the kitchen. I struck my cousin with the old man’s crutch. He fell--I had slain him. [MASK], I believe that I did slay him.
<name>Napoleon</name>	Napoleon	Umslopogaas	I have since seen these statues, which at the time of writing this, six months after the battle, are nearly finished; and very beautiful they are, especially that of [MASK], which is exactly like him.
<name>Varney</name>	Varney	Curtis	[MASK]’ face turned deadly pale and his jaw dropped. ‘At dawn,’ he gasped, ‘and it is now sunset; it dawns before four and we are nearly a hundred miles off--nine hours at the outside. What is to be done?’
<name>Umslopogaas</name>	Umslopogaas	Alphonse	and she choked in her wrath. ‘Ay, and that little coward beside thee,’ she went on, pointing at [MASK] with the silver spear, whereat he looked very uncomfortable; ‘he escaped and betrayed my plans.
<name>Poirot</name>	Poirot	Bougwan	It was the figure of a woman, and in her hand she held a dagger. Behind that figure crept another unseen by the woman. It was [MASK] following in her tracks. His shoes were off, and for so fat a man he followed very well.
<name>Everest</name>	Everest	Kenia	As I gazed at it with that little girl I felt my whole heart lifted up with an indescribable emotion, and for a moment great and wonderful thoughts seemed to break upon my mind, even as the arrows of the setting sun were breaking upon [MASK]’s snows.
<name>Dracula</name>	Dracula	Umslopogaas	I felt that somebody was in the room and looking at me, and instantly sat up, to see to my surprise that it was already dawn, and that there, standing at the foot of my couch and looking peculiarly grim and gaunt in the grey light, was [MASK] himself.
<name>Rowena</name>	Rowena	Nyleptha	There are many, I say, who will shout “[MASK]!” when my pennon runs up on peak and pinnacle, and the light of my beacon fires leaps tonight from crag to crag, bearing the message of my war. I will break her strength and scatter her armies.
<name>Robin</name>	Robin	Macumazahn	Thou wouldst split me to the chin if I stood in thy path tomorrow.’ ‘Thou speakest truth, [MASK], that would I if it came in the way of duty, but I should love thee all the same when the blow had gone fairly home.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Bougwan	she was gone.’ ‘Gone!’ I ejaculated. ‘Ay, gone, and there stood [MASK] staring at the wall like one asleep, and presently he went too, and I waited a while and came away also.’
<name>Zuleika</name>	Zuleika	Macumazahn	‘My songs, [MASK], are not such as to lighten the heavy heart, yet will I sing if it pleases thee,’ she answered; and she rose and went a few paces to a table whereon lay an instrument not unlike a zither, and struck a few wandering chords.
<name>Isolde</name>	Isolde	Sorais	Oh come, my Queen, deny me not.’ ‘It is not seemly,’ she murmured, ‘and tomorrow--’ Just then the music began to die in the last wail of the refrain, and [MASK] slowly turned her round.
<name>Titania</name>	Titania	Sorais	‘I took the Lady of the Night by the White Queen’s bed, and on my breast the dagger broke.’ ‘Who is on my side?’ cried [MASK], shaking her silver spear, for she saw that public sympathy was turning against her.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Nyleptha	One gets over it afterwards, but these sort of partings are trying when one has only been married a week. ‘Here,’ added [MASK], ‘will I greet thee when ye return in triumph. And now, my lords, once more, farewell!’
<name>Espartero</name>	Espartero	Curtis	I raised myself and asked what was the news, and they told me that a large body of cavalry sent by [MASK] to assist the Queen had arrived from the scene of the battle, which they had left two hours after sundown.
<name>Ayesha</name>	Ayesha	Bougwan	Then she stretched out her hand and he kissed it, whereon I gathered myself together to advance and take her, seeing that now had [MASK] become a woman, and no longer knew the good from the evil, when behold! she was gone.’
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Umslopogaas	_’ And seized by a sudden panic, he threw down his spear, and began to fly. I cut short his career with a bullet, and [MASK] brained his man, and then the panic spread to the others. ‘_Bewitched, bewitched!
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Nyleptha	[MASK] was quite calm now; her jealous anger had passed; and putting off the character of a lovely headstrong lady, with a rapidity and completeness that distinguished her, she put on that of a queen and a woman of business. The transformation was sudden but entire.
<name>Umslopogaas</name>	Umslopogaas	Umslopogaas	The room was used as a mess-room for the officers of the guards, and from a cupboard some flagons of wine and some cold flesh were brought forth, and [MASK] and I drank, and felt life flow back into our veins as the good red wine went down.
<name>Umslopogaas</name>	Umslopogaas	Inkosi	The great man rose, stretched himself, and swung [MASK]-kaas round his head. ‘It is well,’ he said. ‘I feel as a young man once more. My strength has come back to me, ay, even as a lamp flares up before it dies.
<name>Almira</name>	Almira	Nyleptha	Last night at sundown, sayest thou, and it is not yet dawn? Surely--’ ‘Throw a cloak around thee, [MASK],’ I broke in, ‘and give us wine to drink; ay, and call thy maidens quick if thou wouldst save thyself alive.
<name>Umslopogaas</name>	Umslopogaas	Alphonse	The spears and shields and other arms we took up to the Mission, where they filled an outhouse. One incident, however, I must not forget to mention. As we were returning from performing the obsequies of our Masai friends we passed the hollow tree where [MASK] had secreted himself in the morning.
<name>Tristram</name>	Tristram	Curtis	I know that thou wilt do thy duty.’ I bowed and explained to her my horror of fighting, and my fear lest I should lose my head, at which she laughed gently and turned to [MASK]. ‘Fare thee well, my lord!’
<name>Alonso</name>	Alonso	Annette	He had drawn a good number, and sympathized when they thumped me. “To thee, my cousin,” I said, “to thee, in whose veins flows the blue blood of our heroic grandparent, to thee I consign [MASK].
<name>Umslopogaas</name>	Umslopogaas	Macumazahn	Thou hast the blood-sickness, hast thou? And the Woodpecker wants a tree. And at thy age, too. Shame on thee! Umslopogaas.’ ‘Ay, [MASK], mine is a red trade, yet is it better and more honest than some.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Good	An hour before the daybreak it became apparent to us that he was sinking, and our distress was very keen. Indeed, [MASK] melted into tears at the idea--a fact that called forth a last gentle flicker of humour from our dying friend, for even at that hour he could be humorous.
<name>Salathiel</name>	Salathiel	Umslopogaas	[MASK] ran to the wall, and, reaching with his long arms to the coping, lifted his head above it and gazed over. ‘I see but one man,’ he said. ‘He is armed, and carries a basket in his hand.’
<name>Death</name>	Death	Death	ay, the power that shall lie in the dust at its ending. So short is our life; yet with space for all things to forsake us, A bitter delusion, a dream from which nought can awake us, Till [MASK]’s dogging footsteps at morn or at eve shall o’ertake us.
<name>Valjean</name>	Valjean	Annette	[MASK] screamed. The gendarmes came. I fled. I reached the harbour. I hid aboard a vessel. The vessel put to sea. The captain found me and beat me. He took an opportunity. He posted a letter from a foreign port to the police.
<name>Alan</name>	Alan	Agon	‘Look out,’ I said, aloud; and as I said it, I saw [MASK] bend forward and touch something on the altar. As he did so, the great white sea of faces around us turned red and then white again, and a deep breath went up like a universal sigh.
<name>Umslopogaas</name>	Umslopogaas	Agon	‘And if I refuse, oh Queen?’ said [MASK] between his teeth. ‘Then will I cut a path with my guards,’ was the proud answer; ‘ay, even in the presence of thy sanctuary, and through the bodies of thy priests.’
<name>Ayesha</name>	Ayesha	Bougwan	At last the “Lady of the Night” came to the curtains that shut off the sleeping place of the White Queen, and put out her left hand to part them. She passed through, and so did [MASK], and so did I.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Curtis	‘Nay, I know not; what is a poor woman to do, when the wooer has thirty thousand swords wherewith to urge his love?’ And from under her long lashes she glanced at [MASK]. Just then we rose from the table to adjourn into another room.
<name>Quatermain</name>	Quatermain	Good	Just then [MASK] spied a school of hippopotami on the water about two hundred yards off us, and suggested that it would not be a bad plan to impress the natives with a sense of our power by shooting some of them if possible.
<name>Abdul</name>	Abdul	Umslopogaas	Laugh not again, lest the hair’s-breadth be wanting. I have spoken.’ ‘What meanest thou by such mad tricks?’ I asked of [MASK], indignantly. ‘Surely thou art mad. Twenty times didst thou go near to slaying the man.’
<name>Alastor</name>	Alastor	Outlander	‘I knew it,’ she cried in triumph. ‘I knew that he would win; and they called him [MASK], and shook their wise heads when I gave him the command! Last night at sundown, sayest thou, and it is not yet dawn?
<name>Jupiter</name>	Jupiter	Sorais	and I pointed to two Court messengers, who were speeding away from the door of [MASK]’ private apartments. ‘Now follow me,’ and I ran up a stairway into an outlook tower that rose from the roof of our quarters, taking the spyglass with me, and looked out over the palace wall.
<name>Ulric</name>	Ulric	Nyleptha	‘Stand back,’ he said in a voice of thunder, at the same time getting in front of the terrified girl. ‘Shame on thee, [MASK]--shame! Thou shalt not kill her.’ ‘Doubtless thou hast good reason to try to protect her.
<name>Umslopogaas</name>	Umslopogaas	Lousta	‘And at the dawning the people came shouting, “[MASK] is slain in the night,” and they came unto the hut of the man, and there he lay asleep and by him was the red axe.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Annette	I am sure the depth of his devotion and the narration of his sufferings in a barbarous country, ‘far, far from thee, [MASK], for whose adored sake I endure such sorrow,’ ought to have touched the feelings of the stoniest-hearted chambermaid.
<name>Waverley</name>	Waverley	Quatermain	‘Send a thousand horsemen with remounts after us in an hour if possible. Stay, despatch a general to the left wing to take over the command and explain my absence.’ ‘You will do your best to save her, [MASK]?’
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Umslopogaas	I said. ‘Yes, I have only just got on to him--when my last was killed, and he has been fed.’ ‘So is mine. Get off him, and let [MASK] mount; he can ride well.
<name>Anscombe</name>	Anscombe	Flossie	There was no need for a signal now. From both sides of the kraal broke out a waving line of fire, in which I myself joined, managing with a snap shot to knock over my Masai by [MASK], just as he was jumping up.
<name>Umslopogaas</name>	Umslopogaas	Mackenzie	Still by now many individuals were fighting with their normal courage and discretion, and this alone was sufficient to defeat us. To make matters worse just then, when [MASK]’s rifle was empty, a brawny savage armed with a ‘sime’, or sword, made a rush for him.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Macumazahn	he asked. ‘’Tis an ill omen for thee and me, [MASK].’ And he laughed. I turned on him angrily, for I dislike these unpleasant suggestions. If people have such ideas, they ought in common decency to keep them to themselves.
<name>Goodwin</name>	Goodwin	Umslopogaas	His words gave me fresh energy. Catching him by the arm, I staggered, followed by [MASK], who reeled after us like a drunken man, through the courtyards, up the great hall, which was silent as the grave, towards the Queen’s sleeping-place.
<name>Kit</name>	Kit	UMSLOPOGAAS	CHAPTER XXII HOW [MASK] HELD THE STAIR We looked at one another. ‘Thou seest,’ I said, ‘they have taken away the door. Is there aught with which we may fill the place? Speak quickly for they will be on us ere the daylight.’
<name>Gagool</name>	Gagool	Sorais	Scarcely had we taken up our positions before [MASK]’ vast army began to swarm on the opposite slope about a mile in front of us, till the whole place seemed alive with the multitude of her spearpoints, and the ground shook with the tramp of her battalions.
<name>Ayesha</name>	Ayesha	Sorais	Low we bowed before her, and then she spoke. ‘I have come,’ she whispered, ‘but it was at great risk. Ye know not how I am watched. The priests watch me. [MASK] watches me with those great eyes of hers.
<name>Cuchulain</name>	Cuchulain	Bougwan	Well was it for [MASK] that he had the skin of iron on him, or he had been pierced. Then for the first time he saw who the woman was, and without a word he fell back astonished, and unable to speak.
<name>Umslopogaas</name>	Umslopogaas	Macumazahn	Women love the last blow as well as the last word, and when they fight for love they are pitiless as a wounded buffalo. See thou, [MASK], a woman will swim through blood to her desire, and think nought of it.
<name>Leo</name>	Leo	Umslopogaas	Then I bethought myself of the others, and, dragging myself towards them with difficulty, I sprinkled them with water, and to my joy they began to recover--[MASK] first, then the others. Next they drank, absorbing water like so many sponges.
<name>Atahualpa</name>	Atahualpa	Agon	There were our friends the priests in force, headed by [MASK], who regarded us with a vindictive eye; and a most imposing band they were, with their long white embroidered robes girt with a golden chain from which hung the fish-like scales.
<name>Dick</name>	Dick	Macumazahn	he said, ‘nigh on a hundred miles and no horses but these, and to be there before the dawn! Well--away! away! man can but try, [MASK]; and mayhap we shall be there in time to split that old “witch-finder’s”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Curtis	So long did we wait that I almost fell asleep resting against the cold marble, but was suddenly aroused by hearing [MASK] give a quick catching breath. Then from far away there came a little sound as though the statues that lined the walls were whispering to each other some message of the ages.
<name>Alphonse</name>	Alphonse	Alphonse	Then, for the first time, I realized what I had suspected before--namely, that [MASK] was an arrant coward. I walked up to him. ‘Come out of that hole,’ I said. ‘Is it finished, monsieur?’
<name>Umslopogaas</name>	Umslopogaas	Good	I determined to wait another five minutes, both to allow the light to increase, so that we could make better shooting, and to give [MASK] and his party--of whom we could see or hear nothing--every opportunity to make ready.
<name>Barbara</name>	Barbara	Nyleptha	The main body of the army reached the neck about dinner-time, and I must say that [MASK]’s judgment had not failed her, it was an admirable place to give battle in, especially to a superior force.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Good	It was melancholy in the extreme, but, as [MASK] said, it might have been worse, for we might have had ‘to bury ourselves’. I pointed out that this would have been a difficult feat, but I knew what he meant.
<name>Umslopogaas</name>	Umslopogaas	Umslopogaas	How is it that thou art far from thine own place, and gathered together with strangers?’ [MASK] leant himself upon the head of his long battleaxe (which was nothing else but a pole-axe, with a beautiful handle of rhinoceros horn), and his grim face grew sad.
<name>Macumazahn</name>	Macumazahn	Macumazahn	but I don’t think that I shall ever learn to understand the ways of you white people. Look there now, I pray thee, they are a pretty pair of doves, but what is all the fuss about, [MASK]?
<name>Zoraida</name>	Zoraida	Sorais	Presently, however, I spied a horseman riding furiously through the northern gate of the city, and in him I recognized the other messenger. ‘Ah!’ I said, ‘[MASK] is a woman of spirit. She is acting at once, and will strike quick and hard.
<name>Longsword</name>	Longsword	Umslopogaas	It was with this punch end, as we afterwards discovered, that [MASK] usually struck when fighting, driving a neat round hole in his adversary’s skull, and only using the broad cutting edge for a circular sweep, or sometimes in a melee.
<name>Atalanta</name>	Atalanta	Agon	‘Of a truth a great honour has been done to me,’ she said, ‘that my poor hand should not only have been asked in marriage, but that [MASK] here should be so swift to pronounce the blessing of the Sun upon my union.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Flossie	Thou canst come and see, an’ thou wilt. I give thee a safe conduct;’ and the fiend laughed aloud as his brutal jest. Meanwhile I had been thinking rapidly, as one does in emergencies, and had come to the conclusion that I would exchange myself against [MASK].
<name>Ayesha</name>	Ayesha	Sorais	‘Pardon me, oh Queen,’ I answered, ‘I said that [MASK] was making love to thy lord.’ ‘Spin me no spiders’ webs of words. Is not the thing the same thing?
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Curtis	But the red sun sinks in blood--the red sun sinks in blood. I only wish that I could write down the music too. ‘Now, [MASK], now,’ I whispered, when she began the second verse, and turned my back.
<name>Yankel</name>	Yankel	Bougwan	he said. ‘Oh, [MASK]! I always thought thee an ugly little man, and fat--fat as the cows at calving time; and now thou art like a blue jay when he spreads his tail out.
<name>Umslopogaas</name>	Umslopogaas	Macumazahn	‘Ay, ay, [MASK],’ he answered. ‘For thirty years have I been a warrior, and have seen many things. It will be a good fight. I smell blood--I tell thee, I smell blood.’
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Nyleptha	Who? ‘Now hand thou over this foreign wolf and those who came hither to prey with him to the doom of fire, for have they not committed the deadly sin against the sun? or, [MASK], I give thee War--red War!
<name>Fate</name>	Fate	Providence	And so at length I gave up wondering, being forced humbly to leave the issue in the balancing hands of [MASK] and the morrow. And at last up came the red sun, and the huge camps awoke with a clash, and a roar, and gathered themselves together for battle.
<name>catholics</name>	catholics	Catholics	One of these silver arrows fell upon the statue of the sleeping Rademas, and of the angel form bent over him, illumining it, and a small circle round it, with a soft clear light, reminding me of that with which [MASK] illumine the altars of their cathedrals.
<name>Henri</name>	Henri	Alphonse	To continue: we loved, and were happy in each other’s love. The birds in their little nest could not be happier than [MASK] and his Annette. Then came the blow--sapristi!--when I think of it.
<name>Alvar</name>	Alvar	Curtis	Listen. In the sitting-chamber get near to her, and whisper to her to meet you at midnight by the Rademas statue at the end of the great hall. I will keep watch for you there. Now or never, [MASK].’
<name>Foulata</name>	Foulata	Sorais	Afterwards I slept the sleep of the just, and a very heavy sleep it must be. As for Good, I don’t know if he went to sleep or if he continued to pass [MASK]’ beauties in mental review, and, what is more, I don’t care.
<name>Smurov</name>	Smurov	Good	One day, indeed, a deputation waited on us and, as usual, [MASK] donned his full-dress uniform for the occasion. This deputation seemed somehow to be a different class to those who generally came to visit us.
<name>Twala</name>	Twala	Nasta	When it was read the trumpets blared and the spears clashed down as usual, but I saw some of the lords turn and whisper to each other, while [MASK] ground his teeth. They did not like the favour that was shown to us, which under all the circumstances was not perhaps unnatural.
