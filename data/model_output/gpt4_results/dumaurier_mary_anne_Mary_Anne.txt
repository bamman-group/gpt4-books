<name>Macgregor</name>	Macgregor	Mackenzie	If the descendant of the clan [MASK] could not crawl in the heather with a dirk between his teeth, he could at least slip out of his mother’s house with loaves in a basket, and receive a shilling for his pains. He reported shock and alarm at home.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Martha	“I shall make my personal maid into housekeeper,” she insisted. “Do you think she’s quite up to the job, dear?” he demurred. “[MASK] knows everything. She is loyal and faithful. Besides, the children love her.”
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Obligations	“Throw him downstairs.” Regrets and protestations were of no avail. [MASK] came first, and dalliance must wait on duty. The bugle called. “Goodbye, my sweetheart. I’ll try and be home by Saturday.”
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Joseph	It did not matter. Once she and [MASK] were married, everything would be all right. What had seemed like deceit would be looked upon with favour. A married woman could do no wrong. Her mother would relent.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Charley	“Don’t worry with me, dears. Get off to bed. You must be as tired as I am—possibly worse. You might see if there are any letters for me, [MASK].” “There was only one. I have it here.”
<name>Olivia</name>	Olivia	Will	She hasn’t a brain to her head, so she’s no danger.” “But the Duke’s in love with her, [MASK]?” “A flash-in-the-pan. A fillip to a jaded palate. He’s working too hard.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	H.R.H.	Therefore she must pretend, show the bold front to the world, the careless shrug, tell the blackest lie, if black lies eased the shame. “[MASK] is up to his neck in debt. (Pepper a fib with truth, it always paid.)
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Dowler	“Why not run the office for me?” “I’ve been doing so, behind the scenes, for the past six months. Tell your tailor he makes these button-holes too small, my nail’s broken.” [MASK]...
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Alone	Cover the falling plaster with a damask sheet—the neighbours saw the frills and not the fissure. [MASK], lying in bed beside a drunken husband, she saw her life merging into that of her mother, repeating the same pattern. A baby every year.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Martha	She crumpled it up in her hand. “I’ll be all right. Tell [MASK] not to disturb me.” They left the room and she opened the letter. Dearest, where are you, and what in the world is happening?
<name>Ronald</name>	Ronald	Applications	“It won’t be easy.” “Why not?” “The reason’s obvious. The son of the woman who broke the Commander-in-Chief isn’t likely to find a welcome in any regiment. [MASK] will be turned down.
<name>Bloom</name>	Bloom	Gordon	[MASK] wouldn’t dare to let it go. He’d have to stump up the cash to squash the story. What other souvenirs would pay their way, lift pious hands and shock the eager eye? A nightshirt back from the laundry-girl, and torn?
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Joseph	[MASK] has really more work than he can manage.” Show visitors upstairs. Show them the rooms, so spick and span, and the well-clad baby daughter, and the respectful serving-maid in the kitchen. Every sign of prosperity, of success.
<name>He</name>	He	Joseph	Easy to mix with them, chat and throw out hints, discover their dingy names, their drab addresses. And while [MASK] rattled dice, talked big and played the gentleman, she learnt the tittle-tattle required, the stuff which fed the market.
<name>Max</name>	Max	Wright	“And who,” she asked, “is going to pay for the house?” “[MASK] will continue to advance you money. He knows you’re a good investment; he’ll get it back.”
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Gordon	“I’ll do my best. Did they mention the compliment?” “Two hundred pounds, I think my patient said.” She had got three hundred and fifty for an exchange, but that had been in the past, before [MASK] took over.
<name>Lucasta</name>	Lucasta	Ogilvie	Gives rather a settled feeling, to stick to one man, who isn’t ill-looking and holds his exalted position. It must whip up your response in remarkable fashion.” Trust [MASK] to smear trust and gratitude, and probe a hidden, unadmitted weakness.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Careless	[MASK], not thinking, she had installed herself in a pew, and had preened and smiled as he entered the church with the Duchess. Black as a cloud, he had looked the opposite way, but that night the anger exploded.
<name>Macdermot</name>	Macdermot	Clarke	A shout of laughter went up from all sides of the House. The Attorney-General lifted his hand for silence. “What is your husband’s name?” “[MASK].” “What is his Christian name?”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Martha	“He says it’s better, and he doesn’t want to go to school today. He wants to watch the Life Guards in the barracks.” “Bless him, so he shall. You take him, [MASK].”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Charley	There was only one thing lacking, of course, with [MASK] gone: a man about the house who knew her moods, not anyone fresh, requiring poise and effort, but a man who did not matter, who understood. But nobody fitted the bill...
<name>Then</name>	Then	Smiling	And her staff had obeyed. This time she stood alone at the top of the stairs. Nobody touched her. [MASK] she bowed to the Duke and, for the last time, curtseyed. “I’m going. But I can tell you one thing first.
<name>Blackbeard</name>	Blackbeard	Sam	She straightened her back, shaking a damp curl from her eye, and answered: “[MASK]—or the pirate’s drapeau, take your choice.” He stalked downstairs, deafened by children’s cries, and picked up his hat and cane. The bulldog snarled.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	John	His had been the advice, taken as expert by the trusting brother. “How much did your brother [MASK] lose?” she asked. “His savings. All he possessed. He leamt of it in the City this morning, and didn’t return home.
<name>Blackwood</name>	Blackwood	H.R.H.	The fifty or sixty letters of [MASK] will give weight and truth to the whole. On Tuesday I have promised to give these up, if I hear nothing further after this last notice; and when once given out of my possession they will be impossible to recall.
<name>He</name>	He	Bill	She was told that night, before she left the House, that until proceedings were closed she must not see or talk to witnesses. [MASK] must not come to her house, she could not see him, no sort of communication would be allowed between them.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Martha	The jeweller could always wait, or retrieve his earrings. “[MASK], it’s the kitchen that eats the meat.” The kitchen was generally scapegoat at these times. “His Royal Highness and I have the smallest appetites. Great joints go down to the basement.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	May	Should she confide in [MASK] and seek her advice? But that would mean an admission of former hes, destruction of the fable built for her family, and for her friends as well, as to how she met the Duke on the first encounter.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Willie	She had spent a whole evening, before leaving town, with [MASK] in tears in the drawing-room, begging assistance. A young lady was in trouble—her condition becoming suspicious; pills had been taken ad nauseam but nothing had happened and the young lady’s husband was due any day from abroad.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Pierson	They bundled him down the steps. The front door closed. [MASK], averting his eyes, led the two footmen back to the kitchen quarters. Turning, she saw the Duke at the head of the stairs. “I’ve got rid of him.”
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Joseph	Or the more lamentable business of the waggoner’s wife? Must he face reproaches, tears, a storming from the room, followed by a slamming of doors and a return to her mother? [MASK] did not know his bride as well as he thought he did.
<name>Septimus</name>	Septimus	Joseph	She put back his brandy glass upon the tray, patted the cushions and blew the candles out. She went upstairs to bed, but didn’t sleep. Another turning-point had come, but there was no [MASK] snoring on the floor to force her hand.
<name>Grigory</name>	Grigory	Sandon	And now, because [MASK] made such a hopeless bungle, they’ve not only had the note read out in evidence but all those other letters as well—and they produced them. That’s where the note’s such a triumph for our cause.
<name>Soames</name>	Soames	Joseph	At half-past seven they went out to dinner. If [MASK]’s idea of a lodging-house was below his station, his idea of where to eat was distinctly above. Not for him a hole-and-corner tavern off one of the alleys.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Charley	“Is that why they’re trying to throw [MASK] out of the regiment?” “Of course. As your brother, he’s in it up to the neck.” “But Will, it isn’t true...” “That doesn’t matter.
<name>Chalmers</name>	Chalmers	Ogilvie	You are not going to get him back. You are going to smash him.” The urbane mask had dropped. The dark eyes glittered. This was another [MASK], hard and ruthless. “Behave like a fool for your brother—you’re wasting your time.
<name>Weyburn</name>	Weyburn	Charley	“The brutes,” exploded [MASK], “putting you through the mill like a common criminal. What has it to do with this present investigation when you were married, and in what church and where you lived? Why didn’t you send the Attorney-General to hell?”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Joseph	“All right. What do you want me to do?” “Give your consent, as my father.” “Who’ll pay the licence?” “[MASK] will. He does as he’s told. I’ll arrange it.
<name>Thursday</name>	Thursday	February	Babes in the gutter? The Lord Chief Justice winced— what a volte-face. How different from [MASK] last, in the House of Commons. His friend the Attorney-General must be slipping. Rhetoric passed to banter, and his Lordship relaxed.
<name>Orpheus</name>	Orpheus	Sandy	And what about this, ‘When [MASK] told his Tale of Love?’ The third verse is a real shocker.” “If you insist, sweet madam, if you insist” She rippled the harp. Their voices filled the air.
<name>Monty</name>	Monty	Cripplegate	“[MASK] gives presents, mostly diamonds. The trouble is, I like to wear them, not put them into pawn. The chaps don’t realize that it’s cash we need, all ready to the hand, to pay the butcher.” He nodded.
<name>Thornhill</name>	Thornhill	Burnell	I would remind you that it is not the first, nor the second time that you have misbehaved in such a fashion, and it was the hope of keeping you out of mischief that caused me to apprentice you to [MASK] in the first place.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Martha	And it was no longer remarkable that [MASK] had his nose and eyes. “So you’ve set your heart on this fellow?” “We’ve set our hearts on each other.” “Prospects good?” “He has a rich father.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bill	The greatest surprise of the spring had been [MASK]’s assistance. Since the argument in the drawing-room a year before she had barely seen him, for he had chosen to keep his distance. And then the invasion scare had caught him too.
<name>Clerval</name>	Clerval	H.R.H.	Those things amount to something serious. He is more within my power than he imagines. Yet I wish for [MASK]’s sake and my own that he will make my request good, as I know full well I should suffer much in exposing him, in my own mind.
<name>Napoleon</name>	Napoleon	Boney	“I’m told that [MASK] manages with far less.” “Less what?” “Less time, and fewer hours in which to sleep.” “He’s only five foot four; you’ve more to carry.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Wardle	That being so, I’d be very much obliged for five hundred pounds on account of a sum outstanding.” The lady in question smiled and looked innocent, murmured something about the House of Commons and a brave new world for all, [MASK] included.
<name>me</name>	me	Isobel	The only thing she did not understand was the sudden reappearance of her own husband, who had chosen to vanish again after the wedding. “How am 1 to live? What is to become of [MASK] and the boys?” “You must continue to take lodgers.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Corri	“Good morning, [MASK]. Have I kept you waiting? I’m always late, I never get dressed in time.” “Dear madam, in this house time has no meaning. To breathe the air you breathe is paradise.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Birkett	he asked. “[MASK], and others... We shouldn’t have bought that silver plate; but it was so tempting to think of breast of chicken lying abandoned on the fleur-de-lys, though it tasted no better than it would off chipped enamel.”
<name>They</name>	They	Honours	All will come right in the end.” All right for whom, you fool? She smoothed her hair and tidied the cushions when he’d left the house. Round five had been attempted, and not much accomplished. [MASK] were still even.
<name>Stiva</name>	Stiva	H.R.H.	Have you seen [MASK]? Not a glimpse. Not even a letter. He’s broken with you for good, and the whole world knows it. Not content with that, he’s put his spies on me, and I’m to be broken, too, kicked out of the service.
<name>Gerty</name>	Gerty	Martha	She sat up and reached for a shawl to put round her shoulders, touched up her face and dabbed some scent on the pillow. “Tell his lordship to come upstairs.” [MASK] departed. She leant back on her pillow, pale and languid.
<name>He</name>	He	Joseph	What was the sense in being married if none of these things was yet hers? There would be a baby in the autumn, too—she was certain of it now. Nothing but the best would do then; [MASK] must understand that. She looked at him closely again.
<name>Her</name>	Her	Hack	It’s one trade like another, the butcher, the baker, the candlestick-maker. We’ve all got to live.” The point was, this way she’d make money. Not money to pinch and save, but money to spend. [MASK] writing never brought in enough.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Ellen	So good with [MASK], fretful in the night... Have you brought me books? I’m lost without books and music.” Then, with the candles lit and the curtains drawn, a man would be a freak of nature if...?
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Joseph	No guineas going to waste in [MASK]’s pockets. A house of her own, with furniture to her taste. New faces, new people, new friends. A raffish enjoyment, begrudged by no one living and earned by herself.
<name>Bagot</name>	Bagot	Charley	The wretched bills had been sent off to [MASK], cashed, and then returned; brought up and discussed in detail at the court martial; forgotten, because he was acquitted on that charge; and then dragged out again in the House of Commons.
<name>Wilmot</name>	Wilmot	McMahon	the humour pleased him. He tossed the note to [MASK], his private secretary. “Go and see what she wants, but don’t go upstairs. If it’s who I think it is, she’ll tear off your breeches.”
<name>husband</name>	husband	Joseph	She put out her hand to touch him. He was cold, unresponsive. “Please leave it all to me. I know my [MASK]. Ten or twenty pounds will keep him quiet.” “I wonder... I don’t care for his language.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Ogilvie	Double the annual sum the Duke had promised her, which came, at the moment, a dribble month by month, enough to pay the servants and no more. She opened the double doors and called to [MASK], “Well, did you hear me sing?”
<name>Stiffy</name>	Stiffy	Wardle	I’m not going to blow the gaff, so keep your head... Now, hadn’t you better go and find his lordship and tell him our tete-a-tete is over and done with?” Anxiety dropped from [MASK]’s shoulders.
<name>Hardcastle</name>	Hardcastle	Clavering	They wouldn’t listen. Besides, I don’t know many Army men. A few nice boys come here to play, that’s all. And one old footling general, who should have been superseded years ago. Calls himself [MASK].”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Charley	“What made you think of that, after all these years?” “God knows...” The post-chaise bumped along the lanes, swaying from side to side. She clung to the strap, and with her other hand held on to [MASK].
<name>Mrs. Piper</name>	Mrs. Piper	Tom	If we suit one another I’ll see about something larger. [MASK] says you have two or three children, and you may want ’em to stay. Now how about walking upstairs, or must you be carried?” She took a long breath, and sank to the ground in a curtsey.
<name>Soapy</name>	Soapy	Walmsley	“Did you know about [MASK]?” “Yes. I heard of the man a dozen times. I heard he was a thief, and I was missing some soup-plates, and my servants thought he had stolen them.
<name>Tristram</name>	Tristram	Mary	She tried to remember. What was it she’d read in a pamphlet, or written herself, soon after [MASK] was born? The Dunkirk fiasco, or round-about then, was the time. “I’m not doubting your courage,” she said.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Adam	She thought, “It isn’t true. It’s all a nightmare. Or [MASK]’s lying, forced him into it. He’ll come tonight and explain; he’ll be here directly. He told me dinner on Friday, he doesn’t break promises.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Martha	“The butcher’s not been paid, ma’am, for three months. He says he won’t supply us any more, not unless he’s paid part of what’s owing.” “[MASK], don’t tease me, I’ve got a painting lesson.”
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Bill	[MASK] came and stood beside her, and took her arm. “The end of an era,” he said. “Forget all about it. An unfortunate side of your life that’s over and done with.” “Not over and done with at all.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Joseph	She had no thought for anyone but [MASK], The day was interminable until he returned from the stoneyard; so interminable that she was forced to pass it two or three times during the course of the day, on invented errands.
<name>McCarthy</name>	McCarthy	Adam	“I wonder... I don’t care for his language. Criminal adultery. I know how these things sound in a court of law. I’d best put [MASK] on to it.” A fine start to the winter. The luck had turned.
<name>James</name>	James	Martha	“Please, sir. You’ll find the mistress in the drawing-room. She said you’d let yourself out, later on.” All well arranged, no doubt. An evening ritual—the caller to the first floor, [MASK] to the basement.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Isobel	Since the argument in the drawing-room a year before she had barely seen him, for he had chosen to keep his distance. And then the invasion scare had caught him too. He admitted the fact at [MASK]’s wedding reception, stung to patriotism and rather pompous.
<name>Nurse</name>	Nurse	Martha	No visits from friends or relatives. That was the doctor’s order, and she’d obeyed it. But she could not rest, with the new accusation of forgery flung upon her. A tap on the door. [MASK] again, she supposed, to smooth the pillow.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Bill	I mean money to run it. It will cost you three or four thousand a year, at the least.” She thought how exactly like [MASK] it was to show caution, to move from room to room and shake his head, raising her doubts, damping her ardour.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Joseph	After nine years with [MASK] the last was really no hardship—a few clumsy embraces, followed by snores on a pillow. The snores of a peer grated less than the snores of a mason, and a peer was lavish with presents, which tipped the scales higher.
<name>he</name>	he	Dodd	Then [MASK] again, “Of course, that’s all in the air, until the Debate is over in the House and we know what’s going to happen. In the meanwhile you’ve everything to gain, and nothing to lose, by getting out a book as soon as possible.”
<name>Harney</name>	Harney	Joseph	It was [MASK] himself, in the end, who forced the decision. Perhaps he had guessed, for all his blurred condition, that it was not only fatigue that turned her dumb; perhaps he had sensed what lay behind the yawn, the averted head, the implied resistance.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Charley	My family’s, and my own. What concerns me at the moment is my brother [MASK]. They’re trying to boot him from the 59th.” “Let him be booted, then. It doesn’t matter.” “It matters to him.
<name>Cleopatra</name>	Cleopatra	Cleopatra	A hot July, of course—he might have been drinking. But what was all this about rats and feminine frailty? Asps at [MASK]’s bosom... venom... ingratitude? Women who gave their all? Babes in the gutter?
<name>Mammy</name>	Mammy	Martha	She did not even say goodnight to him but went at once, drawn like a magnet to the sick child’s room. “How is she, [MASK]?” “Better, I think, ma’am. Not so restless. You get some sleep.
<name>Rawdon</name>	Rawdon	H.R.H.	One thing more: should [MASK] throw up his protection to my boy (and I thank him much for the past), I hope he will place him on the foundation of the Charterhouse, or any other public school; the child is not accountable for my conduct.
<name>James</name>	James	Martha	I always listen for the bell at night.” “Your mistress is very thoughtful.” This time no bulldog, and no other hats. The hall was in darkness save for a single lamp. “And what’s your name?” “[MASK], sir.
<name>Prue</name>	Prue	Mary	She sat and waited. Then, as the day wore on, she pressed through the rooms. The children’s first, tidy, because of their absence. [MASK]’s (now nearly thirteen) sombre, religious, with Bibles and pictures of saints—a passing phase.
<name>Germany</name>	Germany	Kent	I think it’s wonderful.” “What’s the use of resentment now? It’s all too late.” “There’s still a confounded rumour going around—which nobody believes in, by the way—that [MASK] is somehow at the back of us.
<name>Stiva</name>	Stiva	Spedding	I told you I believe that things must be done gradually, his clerks are so cunning. Get [MASK] to write out a list of his services, and send it to me as a private thing to show him, not addressed to anyone. Adieu.”
<name>Geoffrey</name>	Geoffrey	Willie	Was it true she had kept a few scraps of his indiscreet letters, or would she swear faithfully they’d all been returned to his son? As for [MASK], the father was worried; the boy had got into some scrape, had she heard any rumours?
<name>Leopold</name>	Leopold	Tom	He waved them, smiling, at her solemn children. “Who wants a sweetmeat from old uncle [MASK]?” Walk up... walk up... She saw him at a fairground, thumping a loud tattoo upon a drum. Curtains tightly closed, a crimson colour.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ogilvie	That [MASK], that uncle Tom, could dare to spring this thing upon her, unprepared. White gloves... of course... and not this year-old dress but the new one, not yet worn... earrings... brooches.
<name>Trimalchio</name>	Trimalchio	H.R.H.	Less than a week would show, as the word got round. Buzz... buzz... have you heard?... it’s true... [MASK] has sacked her... serve the slut right, it was time he sent her packing... every bitch has its day, and hers was waning.
<name>Smollett</name>	Smollett	Burton	You know [MASK], my landlord? He’s turned patriot, very excited. Says he’ll raise a regiment of builders, in case of invasion, and command them himself. He pretends he’s appalled at the thought, but of course he adores it.”
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Sammy	“What for, ma’am? Where are you going?” “That’s just what I don’t know. But wish it, [MASK].” “Yes, ma’am. I always will.” “Then shut the door.
<name>Georgie</name>	Georgie	Ludovick	[MASK]!” He bawled to the dressing-room. “Your Royal Highness?” “My second pair of boots, not these, I’ve got a bunion. Another cup of tea, darling, and sugar.”
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Charley	[MASK] paced up and down in the small front parlour, biting his nails and peering out of the window. “Any word of my exchange?” “Not yet. I’ve written.” No need to tell him his career was blocked.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	George	He’s still a child. At nine years old he might think anything. I only know he believes the Duke’s his father.” She turned and stared at him, her eyes bewildered. “Who told you so?” “[MASK] did himself.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Charley	Scribbles by candlegrease would never keep them all, nor spare her mother, nor make a man of [MASK]. There were too many people dependent on one woman’s wits, and that one three-and-twenty. She fought a losing batde. The brokers came.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Bill	I promised I would not publish a word about myself and the Duke and our life together. But the promise bound only myself, and not my heirs.” “Do you think the children...” began [MASK]. She shrugged her shoulders.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Will	[MASK] told her all the things she longed to hear. His suggestion stirred her, excited her. A series of pamphlets attacking her world, the world she had known; once more a chance to prove she was not forgotten, that she still had the power to break a man.
<name>Wetherby</name>	Wetherby	Charley	Cash from the fellows who see their names gazetted. The principal to you, the percentage to me. H.R.H. won’t ask you any questions. Try him with favours first, where no money’s concerned.” The first request was easy. Something for [MASK].
