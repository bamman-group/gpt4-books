<name>Boy</name>	Boy	Florrie	“Never mind that! They want licks!” [MASK] shouted. “You got to wash their tail in licks. You remember what the old people home did tell us: hard ears you wun hear, own-ways you’ll feel.”
<name>Mildred</name>	Mildred	Maritze	It’s not like the ones we had years ago . . . They sang the whole living day ...” [MASK]’s eyes were almost demented now, her hand twitched. “It says anybody can afford one. I could get a loan and with what I have saved . . .”
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Silla	and her name rushed out with his exhaled breath. This time her reply was to plunge her hand into the chicken she was cleaning and with one savage wrench lay the viscid clay-yellow entrails into the sink. “[MASK] . . . where
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Selina	He rides in the swellest cars.’ That’s the way a man does do things . . .” His eyes flashed and the trumpet flashed as he gestured with it. Seeing that golden streak in the twilit room, [MASK] imagined that all the things he mentioned would magically appear.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ina	I’d be dead-dead.” When [MASK] returned with the envelope she sprang for it and then hesitated only inches away. An odd expression tightened her face and shaded her eyes. She almost shied away from it.
<name>Amory</name>	Amory	Selina	They watched her until she was seated; then, as if controlled by a single muscle, the hundreds of eyes swept back to the bridal procession that seemed never to end—and all [MASK] could glimpse occasionally was a young dark face amid a froth of colors.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Selina	The mother’s smile had burgeoned into a laugh by now and she sat there holding a slip of paper and laughing with hollow, frightening triumph. But then she must have remembered [MASK] behind her, for the laugh snapped into silence and she turned.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Silla	That’s what I tried to say tonight. It’s just not what I want.” “What it tis you want?” “I don’t know.” Her reply was a frail lost sound and, strangely, it seemed to assuage [MASK].
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Selina	“[MASK]!” “What?” ‘What does your father want you to be?” “He never said I had to be anything.” “Doesn’t he care?” “Of course he cares,” she shouted.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Selina	For a moment it was as if they would rise in one body and chase her from the room. And in that same moment [MASK] asked herself what was there for her to fear when she was all of one piece.
<name>Amory</name>	Amory	Deighton	But still [MASK] remained, staring with exquisite pain at their disdaining backs, transfixed by those piercing voices. Until finally his agony was too great and he staggered back. As if choking, he pulled at the stiff collar, his voice struggled up, “Oh God . . .
<name>Malm</name>	Malm	Selina	Saga-boy, don ’cause me cry Yuh know I want you, stop acting shy. She lured the invisible lover with somnolent eyes and lush arms, with each thrust of her hips. She danced over to [MASK]. “Come, malm, the music too sweet to waste.”
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Selina	He got enough to bear without the look on your face when you see him in that bed . . .” Noiselessly she moved past [MASK] and at the door added tenderly, “Come down nuh and eat. I made coconut bread for your birthday.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Selina	[MASK], behind the mother, paused each time she paused to laugh and waited for the wind to bring the sound back to her. And when it struck it was more penetrating than the cold and filled her with a dread darker than the night. IV
<name>Boy</name>	Boy	Don	“All right, I sorry. [MASK] swell up. Nobody’s to call his name, I know. All I meant was that he cun face those people tongue and neither could I. Besides, the bloody place wun be the way I does remember it anyway.”
<name>Patsy</name>	Patsy	Selina	“And when it was hard times,” she was saying now, “I would put a basket of mangoes ’pon muh head and go selling early-early ’pon a morning. Frighten bad enough for duppy and thing ’cause I was still only a child ...” [MASK] listened.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Selina	And as the familiar faces fell away behind her, she was aware of the loneliness coiled fast around her freedom. “Yuh lie!” [MASK] unpinned the order of the Association, placed it on a shelf and said evenly, her back to the mother, “I was not lying.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Selina	Her chary glance swept from the gown to his face, to [MASK], to the darkened hall where the mother stood, to the dress and back again. Silently she asked their help, but when no one spoke she seemed to give up.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Selina	She gave her a gentle but probing look in farewell. [MASK] had on a bright chiffon scarf instead of her tain, and this, blowing around her face, made her eyes bright and blown somehow, and accented the faint reddish cast to her dark skin.
<name>Tituba</name>	Tituba	Suggie	The laugh became more wanton; [MASK] struggled up, wrapped her naked body in the sheet and trailing it behind her, sauntered into the kitchen. She returned with a small glass of rum. “Come,” she beckoned, “I gon make you a summer woman too, just for your womanishness.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Selina	Nobody’ll say anything.” She pointed to a door marked “Private” behind her. “Just walk down that long hall to the end.” Cautiously [MASK] walked down the long corridor, her footsteps accompanying her until they merged with an ominous current of sound.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Selina	For a moment [MASK] saw someone other than the mother she knew leaning over her excitedly—and remembered with a start the photograph on the buffet: the young woman with the soft smile and the pearls draping her breast.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Selina	It was no use. The mother would know. As soon as [MASK] returned, those eyes would search out the secret; the mother would shout, “Where the letter you just took out the box . . . ?”
<name>Yahoos</name>	Yahoos	Bajan	“I’d never go there.” “The Association. That’s all the talk now. The beautiful-ugly Association! What it tis anyway? Nothing but a bunch of [MASK] running their clapper-mouth!”
<name>She</name>	She	Ina	“Well, he was talking about building a house there.” “Yes? Yes! What else he had to say?” “Not much else but. . .” [MASK] whispered all that she had overheard, and the thick night, the brownstones looming around them joined their conspiracy.
<name>Rosie</name>	Rosie	Come”—she	. It’s just the heat in here and the lot of noise that give me this bad feel. But it gone now. [MASK] managed a smile—“le’we drink.” Still puzzled, they raised the glasses to her and then threw the rum neatly over their tongues.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Silla	“But what kind of woman is you?” he whispered and swayed up, staggering toward her as if he could only answer the question by touching her. [MASK] retreated in disdainful triumph. Silently they paced each other around the table.
<name>Malcolm</name>	Malcolm	Ettie	I mean, you speak so well and have such poise. And it’s just wonderful how you’ve taken your race’s natural talent for dancing and music and developed it. Your race needs more smart young people like you. [MASK] used to say the same thing.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ina	“I guess you won’t be getting married for a while yet,” [MASK] said. “No.” She turned, wondering suddenly as she gazed at her sister’s graceful form and the soft eyes which expressed her immanent mildness if she was still a virgin.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Selina	She wondered at the mother’s power with words. It was never like this with [MASK]. In school she could sense die veil dropping over the other children’s eyes when she recited, and other thoughts crowding out her voice in their minds.
<name>Angie</name>	Angie	Selina	“How come?” [MASK] shouted. “Well, it was like this,” she began, and they hastily formed a tight circle around her while the noise clashed unheeded beyond. “We was in the living room, see. Talking and fooling around.
<name>Estelle</name>	Estelle	Rachel	He paints. We’re going away soon and live together—openly— and to hell with marriage!” [MASK] clutched her shaggy hair, one hand pressed her tiny breasts, her thin voice beat up ecstatically, “Oh, we artists! Where’re you going?
<name>Nettie</name>	Nettie	Ina	She wanted suddenly to send up a loud importunate cry to declare herself, to bring someone running. With the impulse strong in her she burst into the bedroom she shared with her sister. Her sister, [MASK], lay under the sheet, her body limp in sleep and her tight-clustered curls glistening.
<name>Essie</name>	Essie	Selina	It soft, soft. Yuh did tell me once yuh wanted coat and yuh see I got yuh coat. . .” [MASK] posed in hers also, but when her eyes caught the mother’s, her smile disappeared also and she quickly stooped down in her chair.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Selina	“I don’t think you even mean to go away with me,” she said. “You can’t.” He winced but said with an attempt at lightness, “Perhaps, dear [MASK], I’m simply a lost cause.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Beryl	She walked faster. At the park gate [MASK] caught up with her. “I knew you’d be mad. I was gonna come and ask your mother if you could go but I knew she’d of said no. And I knew you’d be mad.”
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Clive	She was unaware of [MASK] until his head dropped lightly to her shoulder in the same odd gesture of obeisance as on their first night. They remained like this for some time, his head bowed to her shoulder and her remote eyes reaching beyond him.
<name>Sweetheart</name>	Sweetheart	Wes	Around them the traffic hurled, laughter and music spewed from the bars, and next door to the bars, from the store-front churches came ecstatic singing, the ringing clash of tambourines and the moans and shouts of the saved. [MASK], honey, start having you some good times.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Beryl	But she made none. Very gently she pushed away [MASK]’s arms and hastened downstairs. Once outside she lifted her face full to the wind, welcoming its brutal but cleansing lash. II “Oh please, not again this morning.”
<name>He</name>	He	Silla	she whispered, apprehension shading her eyes. “He told you he wasn’t coming back?” “No . . .” she whispered. [MASK] waved her aside. “But what he does tell you anyway,” and began pacing again.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Selina	[MASK]’s hands started up and as quickly dropped. She stared wonderingly at the small figure stiffly bowing the way a boy would. All the years she had seen him and never suspected the power and passion in his voice, in his ruined hands.
<name>Francie</name>	Francie	Selina	“What’d she die from?” “I dunno, but she was pretty. I think of her a lot and think of me instead of her in the box and everybody crying.” “Those aren’t good thoughts, [MASK].” “I know.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Selina	“I gon show you the way just-now,” she nodded. Slowly she rubbed the dough from her hands, untied her apron and laid it aside. Then with her mouth fixed in a hard line and her back rigid she strode from the room, past him, past [MASK].
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Clive	Watching those bright windows, she feared for the children and wished suddenly that time would drop away, now, and leave them safe in those warm rooms, with the eager smiles fixed on their dark faces. [MASK] touched her. “Tell me about the club.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Selina	He broke off, his eyes sweeping back to [MASK], alive now with pain. “Try to see her,” he said urgently, his body tense. “She’s the small hard dry type of West Indian who lives endlessly and endures all.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Silla	His whisper held the dark and arid joy of relief. “[MASK], is that what you did always think? All this time?” Her head snapped his way but her eyes were crowded with another face. “Yes, all this time.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Beryl	“Why’re you like this . . . ?” and they might have been on the dim staircase in her house again, the others listening above as [MASK] whispered the same question. She turned to the group now, her smooth face troubled.
<name>Shelly</name>	Shelly	Beryl	With her hand still in his, she suddenly sat on the bed and, leaning close, whispered, “Look, I know you told me not to tell the Sammy-cow-and-Duppy about the land, but might I tell [MASK] since she’s my best friend?
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Selina	“I’ll pick up the paper and boxes and stuff if you want me to . . .” [MASK] called softly. The mother heard and lifted her head. A mist covered her eyes, and her lids were puffed as though she were crying without tears.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Selina	“[MASK], you’re mad about something . . .” “I’m not. Let’s just dance.” On the floor they sidled awkwardly amid the other dancers, clutching each other close. Gradually their bodies gave way to the music, their feet caught the rhythm and they were dancing.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Selina	They felt the cold blade of wind through the hall. Then his voice burst in the dark hall—like a light suddenly beamed across a night sky—gay, teasing, ebullient, shouting, “Where’s everybody? Where’s muh lady-folks? Come, [MASK]!
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Selina	But [MASK] did not see him. In her jarred mind the room suddenly canted to one side, then spun in a wash of sunlight. As quickly it returned, sharp, in focus, and she made to answer his gesture and smile, to plead with the policeman for him.
<name>Prue</name>	Prue	Beryl	The strong light seemed to smooth the grass, to set the earth steaming richly. They were all joined it seemed: [MASK] with the blood bursting each month inside her, the sun, the seared grass and earth—even she, though barren of breasts, was part of the mosaic.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Selina	I’ll be over . . The rest of what he said was blurred in [MASK]’s mind. Only the slight Barbadian accent emerged distinct, and was frightening. The small hope that had nudged a way through her despair fell back.
<name>Velma</name>	Velma	Deighton	Now, at meals, while [MASK] read The New Light she read the “Articles of Religion.” The mother worked overtime at the plant and came home each night, charging with her head like some wary animal, her eyes inflamed with fatigue.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Julian	She almost smiled at him. Then, with her hands relaxed on her crossed knees and her eyes like deep pits which hid her venom, she said very quietly, “I think it stinks,” and exulted at [MASK]’s congealing smile and the others’ stricken eyes.
<name>Selina</name>	Selina	Selina	You got to be something after all that hard learning. But lemme tell you one thing.” Her hand groped for [MASK]’s and pressed it wamingly. “Watch out for this so-called Barbadian Association. They gon want wunna kind that gon be professional and so.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Selina	He’s nothing but a work horse.” [MASK] stood in the dining room now, looking at him where he sat at the head of his table with his six children arrayed around him and his plump anxious wife facing him.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Wunna	[MASK] satisfy? You, Silla-gal?” he turned abruptly to her as if to surprise her dissatisfaction. “You satisfy? Good!” he nodded, “’cause I’s well satisfy.” Walking close to the mother, he made an elaborate bow.
<name>Tea Cake</name>	Tea Cake	muhself	she pleaded. “No, I wrote once telling she to look after it for me, but I promise [MASK] I not gon write again till I make muh first money playing this trumpet. Then I gon write and start making plans. Then I gone.”
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Ina	and [MASK]’s eyes helplessly followed its dazzling arc. Then, as it curved downward, her arms swept out, her whole body lunged in one live motion and she scooped it up before it reached the floor. She held it as if it were a child who had fallen.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Silla	He shrugged and went back to the window and sat down. His fingers beat a gay staccato on the ledge but his gay smile was gone. “[MASK],” he called her softly, “what I did tell you Sat’day night when we did talk so long?”
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Selina	He passed one hand across his eyes, fending off the glare, while the other still fumbled with his tie. “[MASK],” he called, without turning to her, “you think she could of done it some kind of way . . . ?”
<name>Let</name>	Let	Lemma	He flung aside the cloth and, smiling again, stacked the boxes on the table. As he arranged them in a pyramid he talked headlong, laughing constantly, his hands gesturing. “I had a time today, lady-folks . . . Ha, ha, a time! [MASK] tell yuh ...
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Silla	“What wrong with yuh mother, nuh? She like she still sleeping.” And his fingers brushed her skin again. “Come, [MASK], don let’s wait till the subway get crowded and all those people be breathing their germs up in yuh face.”
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Iris	But the way things arrange we can’t, if not we lose out. And another thing, [MASK]. It’s true the roomers is our own color. But if they was white or yellow and cun do better we’d still be overcharging them.
<name>Tea Cake</name>	Tea Cake	wunna	“Here I trying to learn this thing and [MASK] got to get outside the door to fight.” “She was calling me names.” “As for you,” he shook her again, “you does make me shame sometime—always fighting like some boar-cat.
<name>Bigger</name>	Bigger	Selina	And he die!” His voice rose, shrill as a woman’s. His breath fanned [MASK]’s face with its heat. He was wholly possessed. “He die, I tell you, that big-shot white judge die . . .
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Come”—she	“Even the drake’s floating tonight!” she cried. Indeed, as the wind swung the huge sign, the white drake did seem to be floating on the night sky. “[MASK] led him— “let’s look inside. Just for a minute.”
<name>Selina</name>	Selina	Selina	They ain got no more uses for me and they gone. Oh God, is this what you does get for the nine months and tire pain and the long years putting bread in their mouth . . . ?” And although [MASK] listened and felt all the mother’s anguish she remained sure.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Selina	[MASK] averted her face, shaken by the same paroxysm of anguish that seized him, cowering helplessly for a moment as he cowered as though about to be struck. Gradually he fell back limp amid the cushions, his eyes emptying, but the small muscle at his mouth still pulsed.
<name>Rhett</name>	Rhett	Deighton	Monday morning [MASK] sauntered into the kitchen, smiling and darkly handsome in a gray suit, dove-gray hat and gray suede shoes. His skin glowed and the rough hair lay smooth over his head. His assured pose matched his dress.
<name>Cherry</name>	Cherry	Wha’lah	“Me join what? You think I would have any Bajan in my business as deceitful and narrow-minded as they are? Not me. Never no join!” she said with finality and turned to the dancers. “[MASK], look at them.
<name>Sonny</name>	Sonny	Honey	I know you like your music sweet like your women. Huh, baby?” She laughed and lifted his face between her ringed hands. “[MASK], you looks beat,” she said quietly. “C’mon, what you need is a drink.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Beryl	You’re a kid, a silly little kid still. Besides, I saw my mother naked once and she didn’t have any scars on her stomach.” “They had healed.” [MASK] turned away in disgust. “You think you know everything.”
<name>Sula</name>	Sula	Selina	You’s more woman now than she’ll ever be, soul. G’long.” [MASK] folded the funnies and placed them on the table. She did not hurry, afraid that if she did the mother might renege.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Selina	For the first time [MASK] allowed the obscene images to form. She had failed, now she would sin. He’s kissing her, she almost shouted, and there’re shreds of tobacco on his lips. His black hands are tearing the robe.
<name>You're</name>	You're	Selina	A thought cringed in the comer of her mind as she greeted him: he was too big to live among ordinary people. . . . “[MASK] getting big,” he said, and it was like the pronouncement of an oracle.
<name>Life</name>	Life	Bodies	[MASK] crouched in the postures of love at night, children burst from the womb’s thick shell, and death, when it was time, shuffled through the halls. First, there had been the Dutch-English and Scotch-Irish who had built the houses.
<name>Essie</name>	Essie	Sunday	“Now come [MASK] you put on yuh fancy coat and one these pretty dresses and walk the streets with yuh friends like you’s people too ...” As she glanced up from admiring the coat, her eyes caught the mother; her smile fled and she looked very vulnerable in the small fur hat.
<name>Una</name>	Una	Virgie	“You don know?” [MASK] struggled up, incredulous, the blood surging to her face. “You don know . . . Don be a blasted idiot woman,” she roared. “Make him sell it!” “He already say he not selling.”
<name>Annie</name>	Annie	Selina	She returned with a small glass of rum. “Come,” she beckoned, “I gon make you a summer woman too, just for your womanishness.” Despite [MASK]’s struggles she forced open her lips and the rum bit into her tongue and spurted hot down her throat.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Selina	What yuh hanging back for? Come, they’s yours!” he shouted and reeled like someone drunk. [MASK] gave him a quiet look of disapproval, and as he caught it, the gaiety died in his eyes and he stopped his wild spin.
<name>Tituba</name>	Tituba	Hitler	she whispered finally, a profound hurt darkening her already numbed eyes. “[MASK].” “You’s saying I’s the worse person in the world? You think I did want to do it? It was the man made me—the foolish halfcrazy man . . .”
<name>is</name>	is	wunna	and his eyes swept across to her. “Where [MASK] getting the money?” “We’ve been saving what people gave us . . .” Even the smaller children stopped eating while he deliberated. Finally he declared, “All right then.
<name>Dana</name>	Dana	Selina	Quickly she moved into the first phase of the cycle again. Watching her, [MASK] felt the familiar grudging affection seep under her amazement. Only the mother’s own formidable force could match that of the machines; only the mother could remain indifferent to the brutal noise.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Selina	[MASK] nodded gently, understanding. “I felt the same way watching you,” she whispered, “It is frightening. Because you know that if you go on you’ll almost fly out of yourself. That’s what you want but still, in a way, it scares you.”
<name>McGahern</name>	McGahern	Iris	Another voice, heard only by her, might have sounded, for her eyes narrowed and probed the air as if seeking the face. Her own face became taut, her heavy breathing stilled. Suddenly her body convulsed and her voice clashed loud and exultant into [MASK]’ monotonous recital.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Selina	“[MASK]!” he was saying, his effeminate hand hailing her. “You haven’t contributed a syllable to the discussion. At least tell us your impression of our Association.” All around, the eyes reached, as if they were strong arms, to hold her there until she answered.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Chauncey	Hey, we go through the park. I five on [MASK].” “Oh?” “Yes, no Crown Heights yet. We’re always a little behind. But my mother’s working on it.” “What does your father say?
<name>Essie</name>	Essie	Lemme	[MASK] tell you, life ain up in no Father Peace kingdom,” she said gently. “It out here scuffling to get by. And having little something so you can keep your head up and not have these white people push you ’bout like you’s cattle.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Ina	It was as if her heart had been torn from its socket and was lodged there now. She lunged and switched on the chandelier, and yanked open the drapes. [MASK] was almost crying as she turned. “Why don’t you leave me alone?
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Selina	All term in Greek drama I’ve been trying to figure out what it was and now I know. I had one! When you started dying I felt I was dying. I’m drained. Purged. Oh, you were so Greek!” [MASK] laughed into the girl’s hot distended eyes.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Selina	We used to have these long discussions on the race problem and she always agreed with me. It was so amusing to hear her say things in that delightful West Indian accent. . Held down by her hand, drowning in the deluge of her voice, [MASK] felt a coldness ring her heart.
<name>He</name>	He	Selina	Told me I was killing her. First the hair, she said, and now the ring.” “What about the hair?” [MASK] bent over her, feeling a sudden kinship and bond. “I chopped and dyed it,” she said flippantly.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Silla	Walking slowly over to [MASK] he placed his hand comfort- ingly on her shoulder and his voice was comforting. “Woman, I been trying to tell yuh for the last two days and nights that it’s your money. That I ain quarreling with you no more.
<name>Tea</name>	Tea	Suggie	[MASK] snorted. “Mark my words, soul, a time gon come when the body is willing and the mind is weak and before the cat lick it ear your legs gon be cock high.” Their laughter struck the air like a bold wind and died slowly like a wind and the silence flowed back.
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Selina	As [MASK] entered, the chandelier which held the sunlight frozen in its prisms rushed at her, and the mirror flung her back at herself. The mood was broken. The gown dropped from her limp hands. The illusory figures fled and she was only herself again.
<name>She</name>	She	Selina	“I was bom there.” “How nice,” and her hair gleamed palely as she nodded. “Not your parents, I don’t suppose.” “No.” Despite the encouraging smile, [MASK] added nothing more. She was vaguely annoyed.
<name>Sula</name>	Sula	Selina	“What he said? What they said?” Caught in the vise of the mother’s eyes and breath and the hand tightening the collar around her throat, [MASK] fumbled. “He . . . he .. . They said .. . they said . ..”
