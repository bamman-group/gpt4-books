<name>MacDowell</name>	MacDowell	Anthony	If by any chance it did happen to be unsuited, the editor's letter would, no doubt, give him an idea of what changes should be made. "It is, without question, the most abominable piece of writing in existence," said [MASK].
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Anthony	Between paragraphs [MASK] would come and kiss her as she lay indolently in the hammock.... The hammock! a host of new dreams in tune to its imagined rhythm, while the wind stirred it and waves of sun undulated over the shadows of blown wheat, or the dusty road freckled and darkened with quiet summer rain....
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Anthony	"'Sa shame." At half past seven, when they had completed the six rounds, [MASK] found that his intentions were giving audience to his desires. He was happy and cheerful now--thoroughly enjoying himself.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Anthony	It included bedroom, living-room, kitchenette, and bath, in a thin, white-stone apartment house, and though the rooms were too small to display [MASK]'s best furniture, they were clean, new, and, in a blonde and sanitary way, not unattractive.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Gloria	Ouch!" He had inadvertently touched her right shoulder. "It hurts me. I hurt it some way. I don't know--somebody picked me up and dropped me." "[MASK], come home. It's late and damp."
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Anthony	"It's too late," he said coldly; "it's ten o'clock, and I have to be in camp at eleven." "All right." There was so much wretchedness compressed into the two words that [MASK] felt a measure of compunction.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Anthony	He had garnished his soul in the subtlest taste and now he longed for the old rubbish. He was empty, it seemed, empty as an old bottle-- The buzzer rang at the door. [MASK] sprang up and lifted the tube to his ear.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Gloria	[MASK] laughed, torn between delight and derision; she resented his sophistry as at the same time she admired his nonchalance. She would never blame him for being the ineffectual idler so long as he did it sincerely, from the attitude that nothing much was worth doing.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Anthony	They would sit on the lounge. And when the day came they did sit upon the lounge. After a while [MASK] kissed her because it came about quite naturally; he found sweetness sleeping still upon her lips, and felt that he had never been away.
<name>Phyllis</name>	Phyllis	Annie	"I was sitting here to-day thinking about what's lying in wait for us, and somehow I began to remember an afternoon nearly sixty-five years ago, when I was playing with my little sister [MASK], down where that summer-house is now."
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Anthony	Unfortunately, a small and precise doctor decided that there was something the matter with [MASK]'s blood-pressure. He could not conscientiously pass him for an officers' training-camp. THE BROKEN LUTE Their third anniversary passed, uncelebrated, unnoticed.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Gloria	"We broke down," explained [MASK]. "I drove over a fire-hydrant and we had ourselves towed to the garage and then we saw your sign." The man nodded, unable to follow such a sally of spontaneity.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	ANTHONY	Trouble is you're both in the eighteenth century. School of the Old English Squire. Drink quietly until you roll under the table. Never have a good time. Oh, no, that isn't done at all. [MASK]: This from Chapter Six, I'll bet.
<name>Dick</name>	Dick	Dick	"Why, you little idiot!" [MASK] yawned. "Very well. You stay, we stay." He walked out from under the shed and surveyed the heavens. "Rather a nice night, after all. Stars are out and everything.
<name>Corley</name>	Corley	Anthony	And when he rose [MASK] quickly sidestepped and floored him definitely with a crack in the temple. ... He was in court now. The judge had fined him five dollars and he had no money. Would the court take his check? Ah, but the court did not know him.
<name>Maury</name>	Maury	Anthony	It had been a wonderful week, I remember--with the most luscious trees spread like green lather, sort of, all over the valley and a mist rising out of them on October mornings like bonfires lit to turn them brown--" "How about your friend with the ideals?" interrupted [MASK].
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Dot	[MASK]'s, that she had called out to him and made some sort of disturbance. He decided this just previous to the expiration of his sentence, when the cloud that oppressed him had lifted, leaving him in a deep, dispirited lethargy.
<name>Raymond</name>	Raymond	Anthony	Almost every night [MASK] came to town. It was too cool now for the porch, so her mother surrendered to them the tiny sitting room, with its dozens of cheaply framed chromos, its yard upon yard of decorative fringe, and its thick atmosphere of several decades in the proximity of the kitchen.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Anthony	The tendency to run became general, and from little excited groups here and there came the sounds of cheering. He stopped and listened--over the cold country whistles were blowing and the chimes of the Garden City churches broke suddenly into reverberatory sound. [MASK] began to run again.
<name>Gloria</name>	Gloria	Gloria	"Say you love me," she would whisper. "Why, of course, you sweet baby." "Am I a baby?" This almost wistfully. "Just a little baby." She knew vaguely of [MASK].
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Maury	This was so good, so extremely good, to be about to talk to [MASK]--who would be equally happy at seeing him. They would look at each other with a deep affection just behind their eyes which both would conceal beneath some attenuated raillery.
<name>Gloria</name>	Gloria	Gloria	MORNING In the gray light he found that it was only five o'clock. He regretted nervously that he had awakened so early--he would appear fagged at the wedding. He envied [MASK] who could hide her fatigue with careful pigmentation.
<name>Nancy</name>	Nancy	Gloria	Meanwhile you take a piece of paper and write down the names of seven possible towns. And every day this week you take a trip to one of those towns." "Oh, gosh!" protested [MASK], collapsing mentally, "why won't you do it for us?
<name>Gloria</name>	Gloria	Gloria	Six months, perhaps a year. It had grown enormously unreal to them, remote and uncertain as heaven. Throughout the previous winter one small matter had been a subtle and omnipresent irritant--the question of [MASK]'s gray fur coat.
<name>Lee</name>	Lee	Lee	How many of them who think that, at best, appreciation is talking in undertones and walking on tiptoes would even come here if it was any trouble? I want it to smell of magnolias instead of peanuts and I want my shoes to crunch on the same gravel that [MASK]'s boots crunched on.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Pete	He was happy and cheerful now--thoroughly enjoying himself. It seemed to him that the story which [MASK] had just finished telling was unusually and profoundly humorous--and he decided, as he did every day at about this point, that they were "damn good fellows, by golly!"
<name>Scraps</name>	Scraps	Anthony	Only you ought to look sort of like a horse, with a long narrow face--and you ought to be in tatters." "That's all the Patch part, though. How should [MASK] look?"
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Anthony	And then she met [MASK]. On that first evening he had been little more than a pleasantly unhappy face, a voice, the means with which to pass an hour, but when she kept her engagement with him on Saturday she regarded him with consideration.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Gloria	" "[MASK]!" He reached the platform, ran toward her. "Are you all right?" Coming up he knelt and took her in his arms. "Yes." "What was the matter? Why did you leave?" he queried anxiously.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Gloria	She turned a page and learned that a candidate for Congress was being accused of atheism by an opponent. [MASK]'s surprise vanished when she found that the charges were false. The candidate had merely denied the miracle of the loaves and fishes.
<name>Reggie</name>	Reggie	Gloria	And what's more, [MASK], you know I sat up till five o'clock in the morning finishing it." She lapsed into silence, giving him rope. And if he had not hanged himself he had certainly come to the end of it. "
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Geraldine	"This was bad, [MASK], and as the Chevalier, save for this one weakness, this exceeding susceptibility, was a man of penetration, he decided that he would rescue himself once and for all from these drains upon him.
<name>Gladys</name>	Gladys	Gloria	They reached the apartment gratefully, almost hysterically, and [MASK] rushed for a hot bath in the reproachless bathroom. So far as the question of a future abode was concerned both of them were incapacitated for a week. The matter eventually worked itself out with unhoped-for romance.
<name>Quong</name>	Quong	Tana	[MASK] grinned again. "Make typewutta." "Typewriter?" "Yes, sa. I think, oh all time I think, lie in bed think 'bout typewutta." "So you thought you'd make one, eh?" "Wait.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Anthony	His income was slightly under seven thousand a year, the interest on money inherited from his mother. His grandfather, who had never allowed his own son to graduate from a very liberal allowance, judged that this sum was sufficient for young [MASK]'s needs.
<name>Alida</name>	Alida	Geraldine	But [MASK], lost long before, could only smile roguishly, wave her first finger at him, and repeat her bridge-all, her explain-all: "Crazy!" she said, "you cra-a-azy!"
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Anthony	she said suddenly. "Why, I suppose so," replied [MASK] in some surprise. "Don't you?" "Nope. I go on parties sometimes--you know, about once a week, but I only take two or three drinks.
<name>She</name>	She	Gloria	"I guess it expected kindness from somebody, and it got only pain--" He broke off suddenly--[MASK] was sobbing. They had reached home, and when they entered the apartment she threw herself upon the lounge, crying as though he had struck at her very soul.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Anthony	Before [MASK] could scrutinize the other occupants of the section a young second lieutenant blew in at the upper end of the car and wafted airily down the aisle, announcing in a voice of appalling acerbity: "There will be no smoking in this car! No smoking!
<name>McKenna</name>	McKenna	Sammy	I'll tell you what: I'll go down to [MASK]'s and I'll find somebody there who'll lend me something. I hate like the devil to ask them, though...." He snapped his fingers suddenly. "I know what I'll do.
<name>Shakespeare</name>	Shakespeare	Bounds	"No, he's out this evening. Is there any message?" The intonation was cockney; it reminded him of the rich vocal deferences of [MASK]. "Where is he?" "Why, ah, who is this, please, sir?"
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Gloria	"Who's there?" he cried in an awful voice. [MASK] lay very still, wide awake now and engrossed not so much in the rattling as in the rigid breathless figure whose voice had reached from the bedside into that ominous dark.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Anthony	Its macadam became gravel, then dirt--moreover, it narrowed and developed a border of maple trees, through which filtered the weltering sun, making its endless experiments with shadow designs upon the long grass. "We're lost now," complained [MASK].
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Gloria	He held her passionately near, discerning far beyond any criticism of her sentiment, a wise grasping of the minute, if only an indulgence of her desire to cry--[MASK] the idler, caresser of her own dreams, extracting poignancy from the memorable things of life and youth.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Anthony	And [MASK], nervous as a will-o'-the-wisp, restless--he is at rest now. They are engaged in one of those easy short-speech conversations that only men under thirty or men under great stress indulge in.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Anthony	But [MASK], with that facility which seemed so frequently to flow from him, continued, his dark eyes gleaming in his thin face, his chin raised, his voice raised, his whole physical being raised: "Say I am proud and sane and wise--an Athenian among Greeks.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Gloria	[MASK]'s cry was full of anguish. "It was such a cold night," he continued, perversely, keeping his voice upon a melancholy note. "I guess it expected kindness from somebody, and it got only pain--"
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dick	She told her cousin that it was sweet of him to take her riding. "Don't be simple," [MASK] replied disparagingly. "It's nothing." But he did not mean that it was nothing and this was a curious thing.
<name>Undine</name>	Undine	Anthony	A classic," suggested [MASK], "is a successful book that has survived the reaction of the next period or generation. Then it's safe, like a style in architecture or furniture. It's acquired a picturesque dignity to take the place of its fashion...."
<name>Ransom</name>	Ransom	Anthony	So you're writing," he said quickly. "Well, why don't you go over and write about these Germans? Write something real, something about what's going on, something people can read." "Anybody can't be a war correspondent," objected [MASK].
<name>She</name>	She	Gloria	He felt with injured naïvete that [MASK] should not have interrupted such innocent and harmless enjoyment. The whiskey had both soothed and clarified the restless things in his mind. It occurred to him that she had taken this same attitude several times before.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Anthony	Someone had casually passed her on to [MASK], who considered her amusing and rather liked the chaste and fairylike kisses she had given him on the third night of their acquaintance, when they had driven in a taxi through the Park.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Anthony	All the long ride, through the increasing dark of twilight, she sat huddled in her side of the car, her silence broken by an occasional dry and solitary sob. [MASK] stared out the window, his mind working dully on the slowly changing significance of what had occurred.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Anthony	"Yes, you ought to do something," she admitted, being in an agreeable and loquacious humor. This was not the first of these discussions, but as they usually developed [MASK] in the rôle of protagonist, she had come to avoid them.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Anthony	It had reached a high point, tensed and stifled, almost the quality of a scream--then it ceased and left behind it a silence empty and menacing as the greater silence overhead. [MASK] stood by the window a moment longer before he returned to his bed.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Gloria	"How do you do?" he muttered inanely. [MASK], happy, beautiful, and young--with a man he had never seen before! It was then that the barber's chair was vacated and he read down the newspaper column three times in succession.
<name>Archer</name>	Archer	Anthony	The winds outside were stilled; the brass candlesticks on the mantel glowed like tapers before an altar. "What keeps you here to-day?" [MASK] spread himself over a yielding sofa and made an elbow-rest among the pillows. "Just been here an hour.
<name>Aspern</name>	Aspern	Anthony	We must be satisfied with hoping that such fatuous accounts of ourselves as we make to our wives and children and business associates are accepted as true. "It seems to me," [MASK] was saying earnestly, "that the position of a man with neither necessity nor ambition is unfortunate.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	ANTHONY	Yes. We intend to spend the evening doing some deep thinking over of life's problems. The thing is tersely called "The Woman." I presume that she will "pay." [MASK]: My God! Is that what it is?
<name>Dexter</name>	Dexter	Anthony	Except when [MASK] was drinking, his range of sensation had become less than that of a healthy old man and when prohibition came in July he found that, among those who could afford it, there was more drinking than ever before.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Anthony	Two, two-thirty--no, that's evening. By gad, you won't get a train till five-thirty." [MASK] hesitated. "Well," he muttered uncertainly, "we've decided to stay here and wait for it.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Anthony	From here and there in accents of bravado, of mockery, of submissive humor, a few remarks were dropped that soon melted into the listless and pervasive silence. The fourth occupant of [MASK]'s section spoke up suddenly. "G'by, liberty," he said sullenly.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Gloria	He stood here powerless; they came nearer and [MASK], glancing in, saw him. Her eyes widened and she smiled politely. Her lips moved. She was less than five feet away. "How do you do?" he muttered inanely.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Maury	[MASK] gazed helplessly into space. "Well, I can't describe her exactly--except to say that she was beautiful. She was--tremendously alive. She was eating gum-drops." "What!" "It was a sort of attenuated vice.
<name>Rosalind</name>	Rosalind	Gloria	He would be excited already for her warm retarded kisses, for the amazed quietude of the glances she gave him--glances nearer to worship than any he had ever inspired. [MASK] and he had been equals, giving without thought of thanks or obligation.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tana	"I wish he'd use [MASK]'s bathtub." "I can't very well ask him to." "Well, I don't want him in ours." "He seems to be a simple soul." "He's got on white shoes that look like gloves.
<name>Annabel</name>	Annabel	ANTHONY	(_Roguishly_) We have to work to beat the devil most of the time, so we're entitled to a few hours' vacation. (_In an agony of concentration_ [MASK] _tries to recall the name.
<name>He</name>	He	Anthony	"Must you go in so soon?" "I ought to." "Can't you stroll around a little longer?" She regarded him dispassionately. "I don't even know you." [MASK] laughed. "It's not too late."
<name>George</name>	George	Anthony	"Well, we'll have a dog," suggested [MASK]. "I don't want one. I want a kitty." She went thoroughly and with great enthusiasm into the history, habits, and tastes of a cat she had once possessed.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Anthony	And I drove his car all the way." Listlessly [MASK] dropped into a chair, his mind tired--tired with nothing, tired with everything, with the world's weight he had never chosen to bear. He was ineffectual and vaguely helpless here as he had always been.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Gloria	He threw this away with a disturbed grunt and began again: _I don't know what to think, [MASK]. Your last letter, short, cold, without a word of affection or even a decent account of what you've been doing, came two weeks ago.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Dot	You put 'em together so pretty." "I'm sorry. I was talking about you, [MASK]." "Go way from here." He approached her with arms outstretched, but she held him away.
<name>Wolfsheim</name>	Wolfsheim	Bloeckman	Going into the Manhattan bar about seven he was confronted with [MASK]. As it happened, the room was nearly deserted, and before the mutual recognition he had stationed himself within a foot of the older man and ordered his drink, so it was inevitable that they should converse.
<name>Gloria</name>	Gloria	Gloria	"Shall we try it?" With a sigh [MASK] tossed her cigarette out the open door and prepared to follow it; then they had passed under the screaming sign, under the wide portal, and up by a stuffy elevator into this unsung palace of pleasure.
<name>husband</name>	husband	Anthony	There was no vestige of an idea in her stricken sensibilities save that her [MASK] was at grievous fault. ... The night clerk was speaking from the window, his tone half of the servant, half of the teacher reproving a schoolboy.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Dick	every time he missed, and [MASK] was dancing by himself in a fascinated whirl around and about the room. It appeared to her that everything in the room was staggering in grotesque fourth-dimensional gyrations through intersecting planes of hazy blue.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Geraldine	and he's got the remains of some gray hair that always looks as though the wind were in it. He's very moral." "He's done a lot of good," said [MASK] with intense gravity.
<name>God</name>	God	Dana	For instance, suppose he meets a sea captain and thinks he's an original character. The truth is that he sees the resemblance between the sea captain and the last sea captain [MASK] created, or who-ever creates sea captains, and therefore he knows how to set this sea captain on paper.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Anthony	" laughed [MASK] unwittingly, "you can't get what you want ever, can you?" "I can't eat _stuff_!" she flared up. "I'll call back the waiter." "I don't want you to!
<name>Rosemary</name>	Rosemary	Richard	"So many novels are all full of talk and psychology. Of course those aren't as valuable to us. It's impossible to make much of that interesting on the screen." "You want plots first," said [MASK] brilliantly. "Of course.
<name>Christopher</name>	Christopher	Anthony	They found [MASK] sitting in a patch of sunshine on the floor of his bedroom. Before him, open, were spread his three big stamp-books, and when they entered he was running his hands through a great pile of stamps that he had dumped from the back of one of them.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Gloria	"All right, then; by Heaven, you don't have to!" In a sort of rush he left the room. The two women heard his steps in the hall and then the front door banged. [MASK] sank back into her chair.
<name>Evelyn</name>	Evelyn	Gloria	On the wall of this room a pleasing sign announced in large red letters "Ladies' Toilet." At this final blow [MASK] broke down. "I think it's perfectly terrible!" she said furiously, "the idea of letting these people come here!
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Dot--	She had risen and was standing, dry-eyed, picking little leaves from a dark vine. "[MASK]" "Go way," she said coldly. "What? Why?" "I don't want just words.
<name>Dexter</name>	Dexter	Dot	"I'll kill you!" he cried. "If you don't get out I'll kill you, I'll kill you!" There was madness in his eyes now, but, unintimidated, [MASK] rose and took a step toward him.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Anthony	"All right! Hurry!" He hung up the receiver; stood motionless. ... There was a rush and commotion at the door, a knocking--[MASK] went to open it upon an excited night clerk with three bell-boys grouped staring behind him.
<name>Dexter</name>	Dexter	Bloeckman	"Do you come in here much?" inquired [MASK]. "No, very seldom." He omitted to add that the Plaza bar had, until lately, been his favorite. "Nice bar. One of the best bars in town."
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Anthony	He decided this just previous to the expiration of his sentence, when the cloud that oppressed him had lifted, leaving him in a deep, dispirited lethargy. As the conscious mediator, the monitor who kept that fearsome ménage of horror, grew stronger, [MASK] became physically weaker.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Anthony	You dropped a tooth to-night, buddy. You know that?" [MASK] explored his mouth with his tongue, verifying the statement. Then with an effort he raised his hand and located the gap. "I'm agoin' to get you home, friend.
<name>Maurice</name>	Maurice	Anthony	The glow of that strong persuasive mind, that temperament almost Oriental in its outward impassivity, warmed [MASK]'s restless soul and brought him a peace that could be likened only to the peace a stupid woman gives. One must understand all--else one must take all for granted.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Anthony	Passing by a few glittering and formidable bazaars he entered a grocery store. A talkative proprietor told him that before buying any stocks he was going to see how the armistice affected the market. To [MASK] this seemed almost unfair.
<name>Rosemary</name>	Rosemary	Muriel	"Oh ..." [MASK] daringly changed her tack, "why don't you go to work, you la-azy!" "At what?" he demanded abruptly. "Why, at anything, I suppose. You're still a young man."
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Gloria	For answer [MASK] seized his hand with both of hers and raising it to her mouth bit deeply into his thumb. He scarcely noticed the pain; seeing the blood spurt he absent-mindedly drew out his handkerchief and wrapped the wound.
<name>the girl</name>	the girl	Anthony	Several times she had turned and stared at [MASK], with cheerful laughter in the large eyes that seemed the same color as her gown. At the corner she and her companion visibly slackened their pace--he must make his choice between joining them and passing obliviously by.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Anthony	And I want to get married to [MASK]. "What grubworms women are to crawl on their bellies through colorless marriages! Marriage was created not to be a background but to need one. Mine is going to be outstanding.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Gloria	"[MASK]," he whispered very softly. Again she had made a magic, subtle and pervading as a spilt perfume, irresistible and sweet. Afterward, neither the next day nor after many years, could he remember the important things of that afternoon.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Gloria	Her mother knew neither where she had gone nor when she would return. It was somehow at this point that the first wrongness in the case asserted itself. There was an element of callousness, almost of indecency, in [MASK]'s absence from home.
<name>Rosemary</name>	Rosemary	Anthony	" His laughter redoubled, culminating in a succession of pleasant catlike grins. [MASK] hesitated between a smile and a frown. "He looks sort of funny to me. Weird-looking clothes"--he paused--"I've got a sneaking suspicion you two picked him up somewhere last night."
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Anthony	[MASK], shaved and bathed, sat in his most deeply cushioned chair and watched it until at the steady rising of the sun it lay glinting for a moment on the silk ends of the rug--and went out. It was ten o'clock.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Anthony	" Her last words were gentle as fine snow upon hard ground. But for the moment neither was attending to the other--they were each engaged in polishing and perfecting his own attitude. "I have worked--some." This by [MASK] was an imprudent bringing up of raw reserves.
