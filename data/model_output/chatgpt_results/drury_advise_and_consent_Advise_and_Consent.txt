<name>Jake</name>	Jake	Lafe	“No, of course not,” [MASK] said soberly. “It’s what all men ask for. Most get reconciled eventually to not finding it, though. Maybe that’s your trouble. You haven’t really accepted the bargain you made.”
<name>Lula</name>	Lula	Sister	“I’m me.” “[MASK],” her father said with a chuckle, “there’s no doubt of that. No, indeedy. As some young man is going to find out to his eternal fascination, bafflement, and enthrallment someday ...
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dolly	You must be beginning to anticipate that retirement a little.” And then, like the Majority Leader, he realized that this was a delicate subject, flushed a little, and changed it abruptly. “Sorry we missed you at [MASK]’s the other night,” he said.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Hal	The significant thing is that I couldn’t muster a majority against him. And I almost ruined it by trying to make my own motion for an unfavorable recommendation, which would have had just the opposite result.” “What stopped you?” [MASK] asked with a smile.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Seab	He saw [MASK], just entering down the main aisle, gesturing to the clerk to record his name on the tally, a lock of hair falling over one eye, a sleepy, satisfied expression on his face like a great old cat that was about to dine well: and so he would.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mabel	she squealed in ecstatic delight. “What’s all this unseemly noise that’s going on in the bedroom?” [MASK] asked from the doorway, and her husband looked up with a grin. “I’m glad you came along,” he said.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Lafe	“Yes?” he said dryly. “I wasn’t quite sure how I was going to,” [MASK] admitted with a grin, “but since you mention it—are you being fair about the nomination?”
<name>Tickle</name>	Tickle	Dadee	he demanded, as she flew up and down in gurgling excitement. “Isn’t it?” And leaning over with a fist planted firmly in the mattress on each side of her he suddenly ducked his head and pretended to dive into her tummy. “[MASK]!”
<name>Mr. Hinxman</name>	Mr. Hinxman	Howie	“If we set it up too fast they’ll think there’s something in it, and after all, [MASK], we don’t really want them to, do we?” The Secretary looked suddenly sober. “No,” he said, “we don’t.”
<name>Unknown</name>	Unknown	Harley	“[MASK],” he said, “how do you feel about Saturday afternoon press conferences? I think I’m going to take you up on that offer right away, if you’re agreeable.” “Who is this?” the voice on the other end inquired.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Brig	“That’s better,” he said. “Put something in it. We’re all friends here.” “No, I’ll just have ginger ale,” [MASK] said, and the Vice President spoke up suddenly.
<name>Officer</name>	Officer	Seab	The witness gave a small, rather shy smile. “I did and I didn’t,” he said. “Well, sir,” [MASK] told him, “I think you really did. Yes, sir, I think so.
<name>Montgomery</name>	Montgomery	Saturday	For a moment he had thought he was about to be immolated by [MASK]’s hero, but the other had suddenly burst out laughing, reached out and mussed his hair in a friendly way, invited him to come down to the Student Union for a hamburger, and after that he was in.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Hal	“I find myself greatly moved by his predicament. Touched, in fact.” “But after all, [MASK],” the Ambassador said reasonably. “Is there any evidence known to us which associates him directly with this unhappy occurrence?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Brig	“Seriously, [MASK],” he said, “how else should I look at it? I don’t know up to this moment any reason at all why I shouldn’t feel the way I do. You haven’t told me anything yet, have you?”
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Brig	“This is my sinning-in-the-nation’s-capital car. I drive an old black Ford station wagon when I’m home in the state.” “What a cynic,” [MASK] said in a more relaxed and untroubled tone.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Mabel	At this, for which there was no very good answer, [MASK] scooped her up with a half-laugh, half-sob, half some sort of sound she wasn’t quite sure of, and gave her a hug.
<name>Mr. President</name>	Mr. President	Bob	Don’t give up. There are plenty of others that need attention.” “I won’t,” the Vice President whispered. “You can count on me, [MASK].” “Is there some sinister plot against the stability of this Republic?”
<name>Kurtz</name>	Kurtz	Fred	“He’s so far above what we’ve just seen that somehow I just feel in my bones that it will work out all right. He doesn’t have anything to worry about, really, and neither do we. Aside from [MASK], we’re all reasonable men.”
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Mabel	“Oh, [MASK],” he said with a sudden real impatience in his voice. “The President is a nice man as long as it doesn’t interfere with his concept of what he ought to be doing as President. Then he stops being a nice man.
<name>Superman</name>	Superman	Leffingwell	“When the world’s going to hell in a hand basket and [MASK]’s one of the greatest hopes for saving it?” the Baltimore Sun demanded. “Why shouldn’t we throw everything we can at anybody who gets in the way?”
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Lafe	she added, vigorously dabbing at her eyes with a handkerchief. “Damn, damn!” “My goodnessl” [MASK] said with a startled laugh. “That’s strong language for you, lady. What’s been going on here, anyway?”
<name>the Speaker</name>	the Speaker	Orrin	“Mmm,” the Speaker said. “I reckon he was a little upset about that himself.” “Oh, he was,” [MASK] said shortly. “After the fact.” They fell silent again.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Brigham	No, sir, I am not about to be any of those things. So you can count on me, [MASK]. You can surely count on me. I mean it. I do mean it, now.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bob	He imagined [MASK] was having a rough time and he was damned glad of it. He will get to him tomorrow, he thinks now, and he will see then what remains of an old friendship and a close alliance in the face of these somber events.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Dolly	“I said I’d wear blackface.” “Damn you anyway, darling,” [MASK] said lightly. “I’ll see you tonight, and I don’t care about your sense of the ridiculous after all. I’m sorry I asked.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Orrin	“He wasn’t. I’d like to appoint a committee, mostly Cabinet but a few others, to go into that for me. Would you like to serve?” “Anything you say,” [MASK] said. “Any way I can help.”
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Brig	“Probably the Press Club bar,” [MASK] said dryly, and stretched his arms with an air of elaborate unconcern in the sun, though he knew very well that was quite likely exactly where it had come from, and felt suddenly sick inside.
<name>God</name>	God	Pete	I’m grateful, believe me. Why,” he said, “and his tone became much easier and more humorous suddenly, “if it weren’t for you, Senator, I just don’t know how I’d get through the day. Honest to [MASK].”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harley	“Yes, I do,” [MASK] said. “I like him very much.” “Got a lot of spirit,” the President said thoughtfully as the cavalcade drew up under the great portico and the butler came forward quickly to open the door.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Marshall	Inspired by this thought, he changed his attitude abruptly as they got off the car, linked his arm through [MASK]’s, and chatted away with him vigorously as they made their way to the Senators’ elevator and up to the floor.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Orrin	he asked. “I am now,” [MASK] said. “I wouldn’t have been on Sunday.” “Yes,” the President said gravely. “Well, I want you to know that nothing turned out the way I wanted it to.
<name>Reverend</name>	Reverend	Harley	“I had hoped to be able to get a moment with you after the service, but it didn’t work out.” “No, it didn’t,” [MASK] agreed. “We seemed to be in different camps, so to speak.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Orrin	It was not, as his colleagues pointed out kindly but to no avail, [MASK]’s year. This was something he had to learn for himself, and it also marked the occasion when he learned for the first time that national politics are a good deal different from state politics.
<name>Mark Twain</name>	Mark Twain	Brig	And nobody ever knows from day to day which face it is going to put on.” “Write that down,” [MASK] said with a last feeble attempt at humor, “you can use it in an editorial.”
<name>Kennedy</name>	Kennedy	Washington	“Thus as the first day of debate moves toward its close, with a final vote promised for tomorrow night, [MASK] wonders what it was that the President-who-is said to the President-who-would-be.
<name>she</name>	she	Stanley	he asked. “Your beautiful daughter is due here in another five minutes to have lunch with me, and I thought maybe he would like to join us. You too, if you like, of course.” “Thanks,” [MASK] smiled.
<name>unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Arly	“We don’t want you to, either, [MASK],” he said firmly. “This is a closed session, so let’s keep it that way. I don’t want to read about it in the Star an hour from now.”
<name>the President</name>	the President	Orrin	The Secretary, as usual, had remained amiable, forthright, and unimpressed, and [MASK] only now was beginning to regain his normal quick-triggered composure. “I told him that three and one half per cent rate wouldn’t work when he first announced it three months ago,” he said indignantly.
<name>Brett</name>	Brett	Mabel	Did I ever tell you I put on ten pounds in that rest period?” “Did you?” [MASK] asked, and something about her tone made him look up with an odd, haggard expression on his face. “Don’t you believe me?”
<name>Valentine</name>	Valentine	Orrin	Behind him as he waited in the archway under the great stone steps of the deserted House side he heard the revolving door go around, and then a friendly hand gave his elbow a firm squeeze. “[MASK],” the Speaker said, “this is a nice surprise for us lowly characters of the House.
<name>Mr. President</name>	Mr. President	Orrin	“I might as well go,” he said. The President raised again a hand that shook off his control in a way that was painful to see. “Please sit down, [MASK],” he said quietly. “There is one more thing.
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	Hal	he said in some disbelief. “So he tells me.” “Well, well,” [MASK] said. “All of us old rakes are retiring from the competition. But I guess it’s time to leave the field to younger and fresher men.
<name>Bartlet</name>	Bartlet	Orrin	“That really is as far as I’m going to go.” “You mean we’ll have to report the news as it happens. Senator?” the AP spoke up, and once again they laughed, [MASK] and the President this time with them.
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Lafe	“I guess we’d better say hello, anyway.” “Oh hell,” [MASK] said. “Now this will be all over town and everybody will know I’ve been deputized to bring you back onto the reservation. But here we go . . .
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Pidge	“And then a lot after that?” her father asked. “I’ll see,” [MASK] said thoughtfully. “So will I see,” the Senator said. “I’m going to stay right here and watch you until you do.”
<name>him</name> (There is no proper name in this sentence, and "him" is the closest option that fits the description given in the prompt.)	him (There is no proper name in this sentence, and "him" is the closest option that fits the description given in the prompt.)	Brig	“Talk to [MASK] and see what you can work out. I won’t hurt him, even if I could. But try to make him see it a little bit from my standpoint, will you? Try to make him understand what’s at stake here.
<name>Biden</name>	Biden	Powell	“[MASK] called me last night and told me he was after him yesterday morning to run against me,” he said. “Of course that was before he knew I was going to resign, and maybe this is a more genuine expression of his feelings now.
<name>Senator</name>	Senator	Tom	“I know what you meant, [MASK],” the Majority Leader said, unyielding. “I know very well what you meant. Next thing I know, you’ll be calling me a warmonger. I believe that’s the jargon word, isn’t it?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Fred	“I wouldn’t deal with you if you were the most reliable man on earth, and nobody’s ever called you that.” “I tell you what,” [MASK] said with a jeering friendliness. “Suppose you just listen to my speech to the COMFORT rally tonight.
<name>the Senator</name>	the Senator	Orrin	the President asked. “I do,” [MASK] said with equal emphasis. “Do you think you can win over my opposition?” the President asked, and this time the answer came more slowly. “I don’t know,” the Senator said honestly.
<name>Mac</name>	Mac	Bob	“Now look, [MASK],” the voice said, getting the hard-boiled tone it acquired when the talk got down to the business of practical politics, “what’s the situation up there, seriously?”
<name>Evelyn</name>	Evelyn	Orrin	“He’s going to announce it as soon as the arrangements can be worked out.” “Certainly not withdraw the nomination,” [MASK] said positively. “If he told you that, I wouldn’t believe him. Don’t you believe him, either.”
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Howie	“Well, now, [MASK],” the Vice President said comfortably, “I don’t think there’s any reason for you to feel that way. I’m sure it all developed very spontaneously and there probably wasn’t time to invite you.
<name>me</name>	me	Bob	“I don’t know,” the Vice President said cautiously. “He insisted that you and [MASK] come along too,” the President said with a chuckle, “so I guess he must expect he’ll need friends. Do you like him?”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Courtney	Many a time he had discussed an issue earnestly with [MASK], been assured with the greatest sincerity that he was true-blue and steadfast, and then found as the roll call neared that the elocutions rapidly became elaborate to the point of obfuscation.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dolly	“She has been for ten minutes. She said she would wait until you came in.” “Darling,” [MASK] said without preliminaries, “I think that was just wonderful. I am so proud of you.” “Are you really?”
<name>Meg</name>	Meg	Crystal	“I don’t think [MASK] will object.” “Oh, she’ll love it,” her father said. “She can’t get over her father-in-law-to-be. She thinks he’s wonderful.”
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Bee	“That’s an odd statement to make,” he said, and she only laughed in a noncommittal way. “I tell you what, [MASK],” he said with a sudden inspiration, “you come over to see us.
<name>himself</name>	himself	Harley	“Do you really think I didn’t?” he asked, and he would say for [MASK] that he had stopped smiling and looked respectful. “I believe you did,” he said, “but under the circumstances—” and his voice had trailed away.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Harley	At the moment, however, it was a personality that knew it held strong cards. “I’d like to be with you, Senator,” [MASK] said, “but I wonder if I should do it for nothing.”
<name>the protagonist</name>	the protagonist	Orrin	“All I can say is,” the director of the Post told him, “that our check had damned well better show what you say, because it’s sure as hell going to be on page one.” “I’ll take my chances,” [MASK] said.
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Powell	“I can count on you, then?” the President asked calmly, as though the other remark had never been made. “Yes,” [MASK] said. “I’ll see who I can round up right away, and we’ll do some planning.”
<name>he</name>	he	Orrin	If you persist in it.” “I see no reason why I shouldn’t,” [MASK] said shortly. “But,” he added with a note of sarcasm, “I suppose that’s why I’m here. To be shown a reason.”
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Harry	the President would cry happily to some panjandrum of the press; “Damned bastard is out to get my scalp if he can,” he would mutter to the Vice President; “[MASK], it’s great to see you!”
<name>Madam Secretary</name>	Madam Secretary	Brigham	But he told you he had me all softened up, didn’t he? And your lying nominee for Secretary of State joined in and confirmed it, didn’t he?” “You seem determined to turn this into something hostile between us. [MASK],” the President said sorrowfully.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Abe	Hardly anybody noticed that just before he made this final gracious gesture a floor messenger had handed him a folded note which he read and then destroyed after a quick glance and a reviving grin up at his wife, who grinned back. “Come on, [MASK],” the note said.
<name>Senator</name>	Senator	UPI	“Then he did set one,” [MASK] said. “Oh, now,” the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee said with an air of wistful regret that he wasn’t getting his message through, “I didn’t say that, either.”
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	K.K.	“I’m sorry, [MASK],” he said. “I’ve had a long day. You’re entirely right, of course. I don’t think it will accomplish anything, but if you want him here, we’ll have him.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Leffingwell	“Oh, not on this,” the Vice President agreed. “They’re mostly for [MASK]. But on everything else they like him fine, I think.” “Yes,” the President said as they reached the second floor and proceeded toward his study.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Orrin	“Want to come in for a minute and talk it over privately?” [MASK] said. “I don’t want to take your time, but our friends in the press are watching down the hall and big pitchers have big ears.”
<name>the reader</name>	the reader	Crystal	Well, if you were lucky, enough to balance; and she honestly felt, even allowing for a mother’s prejudice, that the balance was sufficient here. She was well satisfied with her son, and she knew—she hoped—that [MASK] would be too.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Fred	Somewhere in the depths of the midnight hours he had attained the fragile hope that [MASK] might not quite dare to go through with it after all; but it was a tenuous hope at best and one he had little faith in.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Arly	Subconsciously that’s what they want, for us to make up our own minds, no matter how hard they try to talk us out of it.” “Well, what about this?” [MASK] demanded, hitting the newspaper.
<name>the doctor</name>	the doctor	Orrin	“Make yourself comfortable and we’ll talk.” “Thank you,” [MASK] said. “How are you feeling, Mr. President?” The President gave him a quick glance from eyes that looked bloodshot and poorly rested. “Not too well,” he admitted.
<name>Mark</name>	Mark	Dolly	I may go back to the White House with him for a little while afterwards, but I ought to be free after that.” “We can always watch the late, late show,” [MASK] suggested dryly.
<name>Alan</name>	Alan	Orrin	You just keep after him and don’t give up. You’re the best safeguard we have against all this economic tomfoolery, that’s what I always believe. I don’t know where we’d be without you, [MASK]. I truly don’t.”
<name>boss</name>	boss	Brig	“I think you’re entirely right in the way you’ve assessed it, [MASK],” he said, “and I could try to call him and confirm it for you if you want, but you know how it is.
<name>Pat</name>	Pat	Lafe	“I don’t think there’d be much point.” “Are you all right?” [MASK] asked sharply. “You don’t sound good at all.” “I’m O.K.,” he said. “Are you sure?”
<name>Mr. President</name>	Mr. President	Howie	“I often wonder.” “Well,” the Vice President said in a businesslike way, “about those Ambassadors, I’ve been thinking, [MASK], that it might be better from my standpoint to see them together.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Lafe	[MASK] added, looking down thoughtfully across the sun-swept fields and hoping this would restore the mood of the drive. It did. “I can’t go against what I feel is right in this situation,” his friend remarked, rather desperately.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Seab	“You heard [MASK] request some time to study the transcript,” he said, “and several members of the subcommittee felt the same way about it. I know I did. It won’t hurt if we go over for a day or two.”
<name>he</name>	he	Brig	Of course I’m with you. This’ll work out, don’t worry. I expect after he’s had time to think about it for an hour or two [MASK] will call and tell me what it’s all about. And then we’ll talk it over
<name>Mr. Smith</name>	Mr. Smith	Brig	I’m glad to know we still have men in the Senate who have the guts to do what they believe to be right. We’d be in quite a fix if we didn’t, wouldn’t we?” “I think so,” [MASK] said simply.
<name>darling</name>	darling	Mabel	“I’m sorry,” he said quietly. “Please don’t worry about me, [MASK]. I’m not alone. I have you and I love you, and everything’s going to be all right.
<name>Chelsea</name>	Chelsea	Hal	She smiled. “I’m sorry,” she said. “Is your father going to run for President next year?” “He hasn’t said,” [MASK] said, “I wouldn’t be surprised.” “Is he going to make it?”
<name>Godfrey</name>	Godfrey	Hal	We don’t even want to do it ourselves . . . So what purpose do we serve in the world any more, in your mind? Any?” “Oh, [MASK]!” the Indian Ambassador exclaimed impatiently. “What purpose do you serve!
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Bob	The press, puzzled by his continuing silence as the eulogies went on, began to speculate. “What’s the matter with [MASK]?” the Times whispered. “Surely he’s going to say something?” “I don’t know,” the Christian Science Monitor whispered back.
<name>the person being referred to is not specified in the given passage</name>	the person being referred to is not specified in the given passage	Orrin	“Let me ask you,” the President said, “were you intending, before you came in here today, to run next year?” “I was,” [MASK] said without hesitation. “And do you still intend to, now that we have talked?”
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Orrin	“I’m glad I’m not under your thumb.” “You’re not under anybody’s thumb, [MASK],” the Speaker said. “Except I hear this afternoon maybe you’re under his thumb. Is that true?”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Orrin	“Here she comes,” the Speaker said, and then as he saw the long, black limousine, “Nope, it’s mine.” He held out his hand. “[MASK], my friend,” he said. “Good traveling, whatever your road.”
<name>The White House</name>	The White House	Congress	“Where does the President work?” some of them will ask when they go through the Capitol. “We’ve seen the Senate and the House, now can you tell us where we can see [MASK]?”
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Khaleel	[MASK]. . . The usual crowd,” he concluded airily, and let some more ginger ale run into his glass with a satisfying fizzz! while the President looked at him closely. “Why should they want to see you?” he demanded bluntly.
<name>he</name>	he	Orrin	The President had not been without precedent in trying to persuade him, for some men might yield; but [MASK] was not some men. “Well,” he had said tartly: “I am as I am.” And so he was, and that concluded the argument.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Orrin	As it was [MASK] just thought impatiently that it served him right, he deserved no charity. “What must I do to persuade you?” the President asked. The Senator made an impatient movement. “There is nothing,” he said.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Orrin	"You think you have, don’t you?” the President asked. “Yes,” [MASK] snapped. “Don’t you?” “As of this moment,” the President said slowly, “perhaps. Perhaps. If you persist in it.”
<name>he</name>	he	Brig	This has aroused a lot of speculation, as you can imagine, and I was wondering if you cared to comment yourself?” “No, I don’t see why I should,” [MASK] said with a laugh.
<name>Antonin</name>	Antonin	Bob----	“I will,” the Justice said meekly. At the door he paused. “[MASK]” he said hesitantly. “Don’t hurt him any more—any more than you feel is necessary to make him get out of the way. It needn’t be anything drastic.
<name>McCarthy</name>	McCarthy	Orrin	Observing this progress as they stood together by the door while the cameramen packed their gear and the crowd dispersed, [MASK] muttered, “Damned troublemaker,” and the Majority Leader grinned. “It never fails,” he said.
<name>him</name>	him	Orrin	“He sometimes gets rather mysterious about these things, presumably to keep me on my toes. Might be another woman, you know.” She laughed. “Can’t you see [MASK] with a painted houri? I can. That’s why I never worry.
