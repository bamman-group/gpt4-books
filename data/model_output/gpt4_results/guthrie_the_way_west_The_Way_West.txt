<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Martin	He imagined [MASK] thinking it over, asking himself weakly, in the manner of an indisposed woman, whether he was strong enough for the day. In sharp annoyance he said, “You were all right last night. You stood your turn at guard.”
<name>Callan</name>	Callan	Evans	Watching them press on, their blues and golds proud in the rising dust, [MASK] had felt easier in his captaincy. Other things were right enough. People were in good spirit and in good health except for the diarrhea that Platte water or too much fresh meat brought on.
<name>Whitefang</name>	Whitefang	Rock	He swung, hammer head on dog head, and swung again while the fight surged around him and teeth ripped his shank. It didn’t take them long, not him and [MASK] together. The two Indian dogs that weren’t killed or crippled ran off growling.
<name>California</name>	California	Laramie	They had slanted out a piece from the river, to upland where the grass ran crisp under the wagon tires. With the thought of [MASK] in their heads the teamsters were popping their whips or punching the oxen with sticks. The oxen didn’t pay much notice.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Evans	The boy cried weakly, “It hurts. Mother.” “Plainest words he’s spoke,” [MASK] said, trying to find the tone of hope. “I know, dear. I know. Do you want a drink?”
<name>He</name>	He	Summers	In the still silver of it. [MASK] could see things plain—the faces of the smoking men, the clean lines of tree trunks rising, the Indian lodges pointing up, the caught moon-glimmer of a blade of grass.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Weatherby	“Was.” [MASK] shook his head, sorrow deep in him, and the sense of inadequacy, and irritation at this rejection of the eternal truth. “Have faith. Sorrow, difficulties, temptations—they are only to test us.”
<name>Johnnie</name>	Johnnie	Patch	No one answered. He heard [MASK] call to him, but he ran on, tripping on the battered sage and calling out. A hump would show him, a hump that had been a horse, or a flat, thin shadow.
<name>Cherokee</name>	Cherokee	Summers	“Well, one of us. Some of us.” “There ain’t any trail to speak of. Remember that. Got to find your own, and no one knows the way, except [MASK] has a good idee.”
<name>Cherokee</name>	Cherokee	Summers	They called this slanted scar ahead a trail! The wagon wasn’t built that wouldn’t lose its balance on it and fall over on its side. While he looked at it, [MASK] turned his horse around. “What you thinkin’, hoss?”
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Curt	Maybe, if we just wait—” and turned over in bed. “I wish I could, [MASK].” “I’ve been wrong,” he said, knowing suddenly it was true. “I’ve fixed the idea of demand in your head.
<name>Wick</name>	Wick	Summers	He waited, squinting, with dread sharpening in him, and saw two figures unlike the rest and one of them like [MASK]. His eyes filmed with straining. He knew what he had to do. He knew what a captain had to do, regardless.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Amanda	I wish you could, [MASK].” “I wish so, too.” ‘‘I understand the fear, but it isn’t fear alone, not just of pregnancy.” “No,” she said and waited for his words.
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Summers	“A handful if any. Light outfits with little stock. But because they’re ahead you think we can let everybody pass!” [MASK] was gnawing on his pipestem. He spoke almost idly. "Camp fever makes the bones ache bad.”
<name>Alby</name>	Alby	Holdridge	“We’ll set the biggest fire south then. And if we got time. 161 we’ll cut some sage, 1 thought, so’s to be sure this wood catches good enough.” “Need a wagon for haulin’,” [MASK] put in.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Fairman	With two wagons and the cattle he expected to trail, he would need two men at least. He had one, a quiet hand who chewed tobacco all day long and had spent his life working with horses and mules and oxen. [MASK] stepped into the house.
<name>Francis</name>	Francis	Patch	“[MASK]! Come on!” He ran south, feeling his shot pouch beat on his middle and his pistol bulky in his belt. A small rain drilled at the side of his face, and lightning blinded him again and thunder boxed his ears.
<name>Cherokees</name>	Cherokees	Blackfeet	we spoke with one tongue and was headed for the big water and would kill any of their enemies we saw, specially [MASK]. Said we had some red earth for their faces and beads and awls and such and maybe a little of the red firewater from the hollow wood, meanin’ whisky from a keg.
<name>George</name>	George	Brownie	They came to the river where the bank was open and sat down by it. [MASK] picked up a piece of dead branch and tossed it in the water. It stayed in sight for a minute, and then the dark roll of the river took it.
<name>Francis</name>	Francis	Lije	It started slow, as if half minded to He down, and picked up speed and flew thudding down the mountainside and tore into the brush, flushing a flock of ducks off the hidden river. “Don’t you wish you had time to roll a rock, [MASK]?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Weatherby	And pretty. Prettier than ever. There was no denying the girl was pretty. [MASK] had done the trick quick, knowing the train must move, but still the knot was likely tight enough—too tight, it might turn out.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Tod	[MASK] lifted his head. “Can’t I go and play with the other children, Mother? They’re all playing.” So they were. One group was down the river, splashing in the shallows, only half watched by their elders.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mercy	She wiped her eyes later, leaning over so as to use the hem of her dress. “I didn’t mean to act the fool.” “You couldn’t act the fool to me, [MASK].” His hand came under her chin and lifted her head and turned it to him.
<name>Jed</name>	Jed	McBee	“We’re going by law. We’ll string him up and let him swing, and these thieves will know what white man’s law is.” “Law?” “Let’s git on with it,” [MASK] put in.
<name>Latour</name>	Latour	Summers	[MASK]’ way was good. Damn the man, anyhow! He was competent—though outwardly modest if somehow insolent— and independent as a hog on ice! Why couldn’t a man of wider view, of greater education, possess that wilderness wisdom?
<name>Preacher</name>	Preacher	McBee	[MASK] had been quiet, which was unusual for him. He spit now and spoke the awful word. “A little shit ain’t going to hurt anyone. Dried out, it ain’t. Let ’em cook over buffalo shit.”
<name>McCarthy</name>	McCarthy	Weatherby	He stepped back, repelled by the sight and sound and smell of sickness. There was nothing he could do, he told himself. What did they think he was? A doctor? [MASK] said, “I think he saw the light.” "Calomel work?”
<name>Slade</name>	Slade	Dick	“Plenty meat, all right.” “The grass is just pinfeathers.” “Well,” [MASK] said, while for a minute the light played in his eyes, “you wanted buffler.” “Damnedest countryl Don’t do nothin’ by halves.
<name>Rawlins</name>	Rawlins	Tadlock	If he could just stand by it, he would count the trip as good as done. He’d be there now except for sickness, deaths and accidents and halts made for repairs and rest. [MASK] was right about one thing: a man ran into enough delays without excusing more.
<name>Chaliko</name>	Chaliko	Buffalo	Hobble every horse before turning them out for their hour or so of grazing! Keep the best oxen close, to shove in the corral with the horses! Best grass was that way, what there was of it. Then 160 come and cut wood for firesl [MASK] might run.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Mercy	Afterwards she wanted nothing but to cry, nothing but to lie and cry while the night and the music and the voices came again. She felt his hand on her, urging her to sit up. “I’m sorry, [MASK].”
<name>Roony</name>	Roony	Dick	“Like doctors,” [MASK] went on. “They figure the less life in you the less disease, never stoppin’ to think the less life you got the less misery you can stand.” “You’re talking about bleeders?” “Bleeders and physickers and all.
<name>Matthias</name>	Matthias	Patch	He grabbed wood from the pile, and sage, and shielded it with his body and poured powder out and reached for flint and steel, until he felt someone at his side and, in the glare of a bolt, saw that it was [MASK] stooping with his firemaker.
<name>McKay</name>	McKay	Mack	It required decision and management. He had shown the qualities it took. He had kept the train in motion. He’d managed. They owed a debt to him—and paid in criticism! Take the day [MASK] shot the Indian, the day that followed the stampede.
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Evans	Fresh meat tasted good, even salmon, after days of chewing on dried stuff, eaten stiff or mushed up in a pot, though [MASK] came to feel he’d just as soon not see a fish again if he could have red meat.
<name>Francis</name>	Francis	Evans	Later, downriver, their fire made just a spark in the dark, put out now and then by a moving body. So here he was, [MASK] thought, lying melted in his bed. Gray-back farmer. Captain. Speechmaker. Speechmaker and show-off.
<name>Kim</name>	Kim	Tadlock	“Meaning what?” asked [MASK]. "If He has left us nothing to cook with except buffalo dung. He means us to cook with buffalo dung.” “Us?” “Those who cook regularly.”
<name>Woodrow</name>	Woodrow	Dick	“How you goin’ to hit back with no horse or anything?” “I got my rifle and flint and steel. I’ll pick up a horse some-wheres.” “Damn it, [MASK], I wish you wasn’t that way!
<name>Stebbins</name>	Stebbins	Evans	“Pizens ’em. You know that.” They didn’t say more until they came to what the sun had left of a lake, each thinking the same thing, [MASK] supposed, while their eyes took in the herds and the west cloud swelling slow.
<name>Chane</name>	Chane	Dick	The cow slowed and stumbled and was lost behind. Five cows he killed, five fat cows while the herd fanned out. He pulled up, his horse in a lather of sweat, and squinted through the dust for [MASK].
<name>Connell</name>	Connell	Evans	Already, with the sun no more than a hand above the eastern sky line, [MASK] felt the touch of it on his back. It would burn later and hurt the eye with its glitter, and the wind out of the west would draw up the skin of the face.
<name>Shane</name>	Shane	Evans	The water climbed fast, up the legs of the leaders, to their bellies, up their bellies, 287 streaming around the little dams that their bodies made. [MASK] wrenched his horse close, so as to be able to use the poke.
<name>Almanzo</name>	Almanzo	Lije	“An’, [MASK], I’m thinkin’ we need a rider at each side, upstream and down. Up man could have a hold-rope on the lead ox nearest him.” “Down man would have a poke, I reckon.
<name>Black</name>	Black	Brother	Give me the strength and wisdom to do Thy bidding, I pray Thee. Help me with the sinners and the savages and the doubters like [MASK] Mack that they may see the 150 greatness of Thy works and fall down and worship Thee.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Mercy	“You don’t have to fetch and carry for me.” Watching the girl’s quick movements, seeing the little smile, she felt again the squeeze of inner tenderness. Whatever [MASK]’s parents were, whatever she had done before, she was a winning thing.
<name>Alanna</name>	Alanna	Rebecca	You remember that.” [MASK] smiled and flicked the water from her hands and went to gather up her things, walking straight and sure and strong. The other women were dumping tubs and collecting the tools of their work and one by one trailing back toward their tents.
<name>Samuel</name>	Samuel	Botter	People called [MASK] a steady man. When he spoke it was about horses or mules or cattle. Those were their names, the names they were known by, but to know a name wasn’t to know a man.
<name>Steinbeck</name>	Steinbeck	Evans	“Like my woman was sayin’ today, you was bound to work up to captain.” “I didn’t work for it.” “Course not.” [MASK] turned on him then and spoke with more than the needed stress because he disliked what he had to say.
<name>Asa</name>	Asa	Evans	[MASK] imagined that was one of the reasons he preached so often; he didn’t have anything. But if you put it up to him that he preached for money, just like a man farmed or traded or kept store, probably he would say he needed the money to do the work of the Lord.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Neighbor	“[MASK] asked me to see if you had some smart ones.” He took off his hat and ran his hand through a thatch of silvery hair. His movements, like his talk, were deliberate and easy, as if he had lived long enough to feel at home in the world.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Byrd	A pigeon, he had thought, and later on a duck, and later on a chicken, a woman mild as milk, with no inner force to fix her in the others’ minds. Even the moaning that brought [MASK] to his feet was a weak moaning.
<name>John</name>	John	Rebecca	The sentinel’s rifle brought him out of bed. “Time to shine.” he said as [MASK] stirred. In the lightening dark of the tent he pulled on his breeches and shirt, and then a jacket against the chill that night brought to this high country.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Charles	[MASK]’ hand touched hers, braced back upon the bank, and she welcomed it but didn’t speak. What was talk, she asked herself, but fumbling for thought? Why speak? Why try to say? Thought and feeling didn’t come in words.
<name>Jody</name>	Jody	Brownie	A man wouldn’t mess with rabbits and coons and possum there. [MASK] wants to go.” “Last time you talked, it was the soil was so good.” "Soil, too. Everything.” “How you know?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Summers	‘At any rate,” he said, “that isn’t the question. Could we pick up enough fuel while traveling—bushes and drift and such?” As if to touch him up [MASK] answered, “It would slow us.”
<name>Let</name>	Let	Le	“That’s all. Let’s go. I done forgot what you told me.” “Didn’t aim to be a baby. It’s just what you said.” “[MASK]’s go!” “And what if there is a baby?”
<name>Old Yeller</name>	Old Yeller	Mattie	She had a right to rest and to be shut of fevers and torments. But things dying jarred against prettiness. Things died ugly, seeping blood and matter, as gut-shot Indians died, or they shrank down to nothing but skull and ribs, as [MASK] had.
<name>She</name>	She	Tadlock	Made up your mind?” “I wouldn’t say I had and I wouldn’t say I hadn’t. My mind kind of makes itself up if I give it some rope.” [MASK] didn’t think that was funny. “Better push it along.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Rebecca	He couldn’t stand to see hope trembling against despair, and her so young and comely and deserving. His eyes went to [MASK], sitting silent, giving in silence of her strength. It came to him that women suffered deeper and endured longer and understood better than any man.
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Evans	The boy answered, “Don’t guess so, Pa. It’s a fishin’ day today.” “It don’t matter,” [MASK] answered, still stroking the dog. “Just thought maybe you was wore out with yourself.”
<name>Ann</name>	Ann	Byrd	Hig’ll know how to make a first-rate cart.” [MASK]’s gaze was still lost in distance. “It’s a long way back.” “Sure is. We got time to do some sawin’ before we eat.”
<name>Shep</name>	Shep	Rock	Sh-h-h. And wait and wait. A dog came up, unseen, and nosed her hand, and she started and calmed and felt him to be [MASK] and held him with her while she waited.
<name>Boo</name>	Boo	Summers	He slid his eyes up to [MASK] and down to the ground. “You got time to talk to me?” “Sure, boy. Time aplenty. Train don’t roll till tomorrow.” “I got no business botherin’ you, I reckon.”
<name>sympathy</name>	sympathy	Mack	Here was a bad thing, and he knew it for a bad thing, and yet, remembering the girl’s grave face and the young and rounded lines of her, he could understand, with [MASK], how the thing had come to be.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Dick	Well, that wasn’t how he was cut. Never, anywhere, had he wanted to be boss. So he would lean on [MASK], and when hard questions came up he would call the council together. They would have solid ideas.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Fairman	Now whare’d he hear that, you reckon?” [MASK] asked, “How much?” "Forty dollars each, two for seventy-five, and take your pick.” “It’s enough.” “Cheap. Cheap as dirt.”
<name>Stoner</name>	Stoner	Summers	That was how [MASK] felt yet, but the movers were different. They traveled to get some place, as they lived life. Chances were they couldn’t enjoy a woman and a bed for thinking what they had to do next. They argued.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Evans	In the high sun the colors made flashes through the dust—the white of the wagon covers, the red and white and black of the critters, the blue of a dress a woman had on. [MASK] saw a man walking along the line.
<name>Almanzo</name>	Almanzo	Evans	[MASK] had put his own wagons first in line, six yoke to the big one, four to the small, thinking it his duty to try the danger first. The other wagons curled behind his, some prepared to go, 285 some waiting for ox teams to come back.
<name>Shane</name>	Shane	Dick	You two all right? They peaceable?” “They won’t rub you out, ’cept in fun.” “What do I do, [MASK]?” “Git your pipe out and act to be loadin’ it. That’s peace sign.”
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Judie	Books would be scarce in a new country. With two wagons he could transport more than some travelers—a cherry chest that [MASK] liked, the best of her dishes, buried in the flour, quilts, extra clothes, dress shoes, jams and jellies.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Judith	“I am.” She reached down for another stick. [MASK] herself was, she thought, content, sad and content, waiting like a hen on eggs for the slow warmth of her to bring the chick out of its shell.
<name>Francis</name>	Francis	Evans	Her eyes looked big and washed-out, and they traveled from face to face as if to ask what she was doing on the ground with people looking down on her. Of a sudden her eyes filled and her face twisted, and [MASK] switched his gaze.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Fairman	Along the shores the bare trees crowded, straining up for room and air, their lower trunks lost in a tangle of vine and bush. It seemed to [MASK] he could see sickness there, could see fever breeding in the breathless overgrowth.
<name>Yeller</name>	Yeller	Purty	She was gone on you. She was now. [MASK] as paint and a gone beaver on you. An’ damn if you didn’t traipse off with her. You was alius kind of a loner, I’m thinkin’. . . . ’
<name>Shane</name>	Shane	Mack	“All quiet?” "Critters are kind of scary.” [MASK] narrowed his eyes and saw the cattle, a darker patch against the dark slope. “Wonder why?” “Injun smell, I figger.”
<name>Elmer</name>	Elmer	Weatherby	The old preacher had put on his rusty coat, though he must have been hot in it. The cracked voice rose: “We had no prayer. We didn’t open with prayer.” Back of [MASK] someone said, “Sit down! Christ sake!”
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Tadlock	It was just that a word wouldn’t stay a thief or make a thief fork over, in red or white crowds either one. But it wasn’t any use to argue so with [MASK], who thought a head man wasn’t head unless the rest obeyed.
<name>Rawlins</name>	Rawlins	Tadlock	Some men, like [MASK] himself, had a big bunch of loose cattle and some had no more than their teams and a milk cow or two. It wasn’t fair, expecting each man to take turn about when some had more than others.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Evans	“And that’s why you’re eggin’ us on?” [MASK] put in. The old man spread his hands as if to show the all of him, heart and gizzard and mind and all. “You’re readin’ the sign wrong, son.
<name>Boone</name>	Boone	Brownie	They ran a bigger circle around the circle of wagons, just the tops of their heads showing or an arm or a leg, or a bow bent sharp and then the arrow streaking. “Rifle!” [MASK] pitched his empty gun back of him.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Becky	Where could that boy be? Blowed away by the tarnal wind that just now was falling off? “He’ll be all right, [MASK],” he called back, setting his face in a smile. “You know how boys are.
<name>Joad</name>	Joad	Tadlock	“This stuff won’t grow anything except grass and cactus. It’s straight sand.” [MASK] spoke slowly, as if coming to a deep answer. “It must be that the island soil is richer.”
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Mercy	[MASK] wasn’t one to point out she’d heard so before. While she worked dough on a board she looked up. “Yes,” she answered. “She’s cornin’ to herself. Once the baby’s here she’ll be all right.”
<name>Cherokee</name>	Cherokee	Dick	I’m makin’ medicine.” The hawk-faced Indian answered him, talking loud and gesturing as [MASK] had done. The carbine was itchy in the young Indian’s hands. It kept waggling as if about to come up and go off.
<name>Snitter</name>	Snitter	Rock	Sun and space had scared it witless, and it had run crazy on the open ground, wanting the close, blind walls of home. [MASK] stopped and growled again, his shoulder hair rising while he sorted the air, his eyes searching for what his nose suspected.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Fair	“You’ll be where you want to be before you know it,” he said, smiling with some good news in him. “How’s the grass, boy?” “[MASK]. We took ’em back a ways.”
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Tadlock	The men didn’t notice him until he spoke. “What you all aimin’ to do?” [MASK] turned around, the rope tight-held in his hand, and a quick displeasure showed on his face. “You’ve got eyes, haven’t you?”
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Tadlock	“No presents.” [MASK] saw thought working in their eyes. He saw what he supposed was disappointment rising from his refusal to make amends with gifts. Now was the time, he knew. Now was the danger. But still he felt no fear.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Shields	The sky was overcast, but without much threat of rain. Through the clouds to the west he could see the bright spot that would be the sun. “First thing to decide is to get away from this goddam fort,” [MASK] said. “Fish!
<name>Chappie</name>	Chappie	Summers	Someone said, “Hello, hoss,” and he knew it was [MASK]. He made him out by the ghost-white of his buckskins and saw he was seated in the clear, where he could watch. “Don’t you ever sleep?”
<name>McWatt</name>	McWatt	Tadlock	He turned and made for the cabin, thinking over what he had said, thinking it wouldn’t have made any difference if he had told them now. It was just that [MASK] graveled him—and perhaps for no good reason at all except his outside manner.
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Nellie	[MASK] wouldn’t hold. She broke before the thrashing push of them, frightened now and unsteady in the tear of water. The line clear back to the wheel yoke skewed to the pull, slanting the wagon below the come-out trail, slanting toward the ripple, slanting off to wicked depths.
<name>Jake</name>	Jake	Weatherby	“In His might.” “It’s mighty, sure enough.” [MASK] wagged his head slow. “I couldn’t have believed it. I can hardly believe it now, seeing it.” “It’s some.”
<name>Antonia</name>	Antonia	Beth	[MASK] came to give her a white rock she had found. “Pretty?” she asked while her fat hand laid it in the open palm. “Very pretty.” “Will you keep it in your house?” “It will be a present from you.”
<name>Frances</name>	Frances	Tod	She knew she was feeling sorry for herself, but for the moment she didn’t care. She bent over and soaped a shirt and began rubbing it on the board that slanted from the tub and asked [MASK] again to stay close to her.
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Summers	It’ll be a damn sight shorter if we let other companies get ahead.” “We ain’t first anyhow,” [MASK] answered. “There’s some beyond.” “A handful if any. Light outfits with little stock.
<name>Strider</name>	Strider	Indians	He’s got his p’ints, though. He tries hard. It ain’t an easy place, with some wantin’ to hurry and some to hold back and some scared of [MASK] and some sorry they set out and some just naturally ornery.”
<name>Francis</name>	Francis	Mercy	“Won’t hurt to put the rice on,” she said and started to get up, but [MASK] beat her to her feet and spilled the rice into the 326 boiling water and thought to move the pot to where it wouldn’t sputter over.
<name>pard</name>	pard	Lije	Even so, it was more than he needed. He could travel from hell to breakfast with no more than a gun and a horse, and would get there in time for dinner without the horse. “It ain’t much, [MASK],” he said.
