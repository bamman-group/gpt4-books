<name>Zaphod</name>	Zaphod	Han	[MASK] kept his ear tuned, for his eyes were still useless. He spoke with reckless disregard, to put the guards at ease—to get them used to his talking and moving, so when the time came for him really to move, they’d be a critical fraction behind his mark.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Luke	He brought her closer still, held her face in his hands. He looked so tender now, so giving. Was he giving her the power? Could she truly hold it? What was he saying? “[MASK], what’s come over you?”
<name>Han</name>	Han	Han	“Okay, what’s going on around here, anyway?” [MASK] was instantly back on track. Here was unbelievably good fortune—here was someone he could make a plan with. And not only someone, but his most loyal friend in the galaxy.
<name>Dr. T. J. Eckleburg</name>	Dr. T. J. Eckleburg	Jabba	A moment of silence, followed by a low, rumbling roar, followed by a terrified shriek was followed once more by silence. [MASK] laughed until he slobbered. A dozen revelers hurried over to peer through the grate, to observe the demise of the nubile dancer.
<name>R2-D2</name>	R2-D2	Artoo	Before he’d even computed the weather codes, though, a laser bolt explosion ripped the entranceway, disengaging [MASK]’s cable arm, spilling him to the dirt. His head began to smolder, his fittings to leak.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Lando	And [MASK] understood. “Thanks, old buddy. I’ll take good care of her. You know I always flew her better than you did, anyway. She won’t get a scratch on her, with me at the stick.”
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Luke	[MASK] flashed with anger at himself, now, to have revealed so much, unwillingly, unwittingly. Anger and self-doubt. He strove to calm himself—to see all, to show nothing; only to be.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Han	[MASK] was thrown roughly into the dungeon cell; the door crashed shut behind him. He fell to the floor in the darkness, then picked himself up and sat against the wall. After a few moments of pounding the ground with his fist, he quieted down and tried to organize his thoughts.
<name>Han</name>	Han	Calrissian	“I’ll take out the other three...” [MASK] steered the Falcon into the complete flip, as his crew fired at the Imperial fighters from the belly guns. Two were direct hits, the third a glancing blow that caused the TIE fighter to tumble into another of its own squads.
<name>Case</name>	Case	Solo	Men had gone mad, in these first minutes following decarbonization, hopelessly, utterly mad—unable ever again to reorganize the ten-billion individual images that comprised a lifespan into any kind of coherent, selective order. [MASK] wasn’t that susceptible.
<name>Yoda</name>	Yoda	Ben	Was it possible for them to distort the Emperor’s vision by their presence? No one was infallible, [MASK] had told him—surely the Emperor couldn’t see everything, couldn’t know every future, twist every reality to suit his gluttony.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Luke	Absurd to think of [MASK] dying, and to think of her being the only hope. Both thoughts were out of the question. She moved away from him, to deny his words; at least to give them distance, to let her breathe.
<name>Chewbacca</name>	Chewbacca	Chewie	The other scout jumped on his speeder bike to escape. But by the time he’d ignited the engines, [MASK] was able to get off a few shots from his crossbow laser. The ill-fated scout crashed instantly against an enormous tree; a brief, muffled explosion followed.
<name>She</name>	She	Leia	He tilted his head in an attitude of keen attention. “What is it?” [MASK] whispered. Something was obviously amiss. Then she heard it: a quiet snap in the bushes beyond, a tentative rustling.
<name>in politics</name>	in politics	Jabba	“We have powerful friends [MASK]. You will soon regret this ...” “I’m sure. I’m sure,” the old gangster rumbled with glee, “but in the meantime, I will thoroughly enjoy the pleasure of your company.”
<name>Rey</name>	Rey	Luke	You’re the last Jedi, now, [MASK]... but she returned to us—to me—to learn, and grow. Because it was her destiny to learn and grow; and mine to teach.” He went on more slowly, each word deliberate, each pause emphatic.
<name>distractions</name>	distractions	Luke	She closed her mind to [MASK], to keep herself from distracting him; yet at the same time she kept it open, ready to receive any sliver of information she might need to act. She felt charged with possibilities.
<name>Winterfell</name>	Winterfell	Jabba	“I’ll believe it when I see it—” he commented, walking stoutly into the wall. “If you’ll excuse the expression.” The iron main gate of [MASK]’s palace scraped open harshly, oiled only with sand and time.
<name>Will</name>	Will	Han	Sometimes I—” “Oh, [MASK]!” she cried, and burst into tears once more. She buried herself in his embrace. His anger turned slowly to confusion and dismay, as he found himself wrapping his arms around her, caressing her shoulders, comforting her.
<name>Yoda</name>	Yoda	Luke	The creature hobbled over to his bed, still chuckling and, with great effort, lay down. “Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have.” [MASK] shook his head. “You can’t die.
<name>Hermione</name>	Hermione	Threepio	“Picking up what?” [MASK] snapped. “Try to be more specific, would you?” The trees became significantly taller as the group pushed on. Not that it was possible to see any higher, but the girth of the trunks was increasingly massive.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Han	He stroked the back of her head. “No, you don’t. You’ve never faltered. When [MASK] and I and the others have doubted, you’ve always been strong. You’ve never turned away from your responsibility. I can’t say the same.”
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Leia	Wires sparked each time he refastened another connection, but the door kept not opening. [MASK] crouched at his back, firing her laser pistol, giving him cover. He motioned her at last. “Give me a hand, I think I’ve got it figured out.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Luke	When the group was hundreds of feet up in the trees, [MASK] finally realized the lights were bonfires—among the treetops. They were finally taken out onto a rickety wooden walkway, far too far off the ground to be able to see anything below them but the abysmal drop.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Threepio	At the center of this clearing, a single tall stake was planted in the ground, from which hung several shanks of raw meat. The searchers stared, then cautiously walked to the stake. “What’s this?” [MASK] voiced the collective question.
<name>Maverick</name>	Maverick	Lando	“And they’ll think we know more!” Bluffing was al- ways dangerous in the last hand: but sometimes, when all your money was in the pot, it was the only way to win—and [MASK] never played to lose.
<name>Emperor</name>	Emperor	Palpatine	He stared directly intc the malign ruler’s hood. [MASK] said nothing for a few moments, returning the young Jedi’s gaze, assessing his strengths and weaknesses. He sat back at last, pleased with this first confrontation.
<name>Chewbacca</name>	Chewbacca	Threepio	[MASK] rose from the mesh trap, feeling himself for dents or rattles. “Oh, my head,” he complained. At the sight of his fully upright body, the Ewoks began squeaking among themselves, pointing and gesticulating.
<name>Gandalf</name>	Gandalf	Solo	“Why don’t you leave that crate and come with us?” [MASK] nudged. “I have a promise I have to keep first...to an old friend.” A very old friend, he smiled to himself in afterthought.
<name>Adrian</name>	Adrian	Luke	It was a momentous act for [MASK]—to address his father, as his father. But he’d done it, now, and kept himself under control, and the moment was past. It was done. He felt stronger for it. He felt potent.
<name>Darth Vader</name>	Darth Vader	Luke	He had the power; the choice was his. And then another thought emerged, slowly compulsive as an ardent lover: he could destroy the Emperor, too. Destroy them both, and rule the galaxy. Avenge and conquer. It was a profound moment for [MASK].
<name>Wedge</name>	Wedge	Lando	The Falcon waited three dangerous seconds longer, then loosed its concussion missiles with a powerful roar. For another second the flash was too bright to see what had happened. And then the whole reactor began to go. “Direct hit!” shouted [MASK].
<name>Therapy</name>	Therapy	Manhood	He was less impulsive now. [MASK] had given him perspective, a framework in which to fit the events of his life—that is, a lattice of spatial and time coordinates spanning his existence, back to earliest memories, ahead to a hundred alternative futures.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Luke	It makes the cold colder and the dark darker; but let it rise and it will dissolve. So [MASK] let it rise past the clamor of the beast above him, and examined ways he might turn the sad creature's rant-ings on itself.
<name>Gollum</name>	Gollum	Vader	[MASK] stumbled with his load to the middle of the bridge over the black chasm leading to the power core. He held the wailing despot high over his head, and with a final spasm of strength, hurled him into the abyss.
<name>Rainsford</name>	Rainsford	Artoo	[MASK] agreed. In a few minutes, they were all in the skiff together, more or less in one piece; and for the first time, they looked at one another and realized they were all in the skiff together, more or less in one piece.
<name>Red Leader</name>	Red Leader	Lando	“I get no reading, are you sure?” “Pull up!” [MASK] commanded. “All craft pull up!” He banked hard to the left, the fighters of the Red Squad veering close on his tail. Some didn’t make it.
<name>Obi-Wan</name>	Obi-Wan	Luke	At the last moment, though, [MASK] stepped aside—with perfect timing, like a master matador facing a rocket-powered bull—and chopped off the bike’s steering vanes with a single mighty slash of his lightsaber. The bike quickly began to shudder; then pitch and roll.
<name>Wedge</name>	Wedge	Luke	Slowly he rose again. Like an automaton, he hoisted his father’s body over his shoulder and stumbled toward one of the last remaining shuttles. [MASK] rested his father on the ground, trying to collect strength one last time, as explosions grew louder all around them.
<name>Persephone</name>	Persephone	Jabba	Where are we?” “[MASK]’s palace. I’ve got to get you out of here quick.” He sat up shakily. “Everything’s a blur... I’m not going to be much help...”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Luke	His body shivered once; and he disappeared. [MASK] sat beside the small, empty bed for over an hour, trying to fathom the depth of this loss. It was unfathomable. His first feeling was one of boundless grief. For himself, for the universe.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Luke	I do what I can—we all do—but I’m of no importance. Without you...I can do nothing. It’s you, [MASK]. I’ve seen it. You have a power I don’t understand... and could never have.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Luke	“Now could you just grow a few inches taller?” The deck gunners on the barge were lining up this human chain in their sights for the coup de grace, when [MASK] stepped in front of them, laughing like a pirate king.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Luke	Regret, he saw most plainly. And shame. Memories could be seen flashing across it... memories of rich times. And horrors. And love, too. It was a face that hadn’t touched the world in a lifetime. In [MASK]’s lifetime.
<name>Admiral Ackbar</name>	Admiral Ackbar	Ackbar	That blast came from the Death Star! Repeat, the Death Star is operational!” “We saw it,” [MASK] answered wearily. “All craft prepare to retreat.” “I’m not going to give up and run!”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Luke	“What are you talking about?” she said. Then she realized what he was talking about. “Oh, no. No,” she laughed, “it’s not like that at all—[MASK] is my brother.”
<name>he</name>	he	Luke	Out in the square, a great party was going on—dancing, squealing, tickling—but [MASK] avoided this, too. He wandered away from the bonfires, away from the gaiety, to a secluded walkway on the dark side of a colossal tree.
<name>Sarah</name>	Sarah	Han	He realized he was still shaking her, and stopped. “I can’t, [MASK]...” Her lip began to tremble again. “You can’t! You can’t tell me? I thought we were closer than that, but I guess I was wrong.
<name>Luke</name>	Luke	Leia	It had been reprogrammed as soon as they’d been caught. “The terminal doesn’t work now,” he muttered. [MASK] stretched for a laser pistol lying in the dirt, just out of reach, beside a felled stormtrooper. Shots were crisscrossing from every direction, though.
<name>Darth Vader</name>	Darth Vader	Vader	This accusation really made [MASK] angry. He could tolerate much from the insolent child, but this was insufferable. He must teach this boy a lesson he would never forget, or die learning. “Once again, you underestimate the power of the dark side...”
<name>Chewbacca</name>	Chewbacca	Paploo	[MASK] had scampered down through the bushes to where the scouts’ bikes were parked. Now, with the sickening horror of inevitability, the Rebel leaders watched the little ball of fur swing his pudgy body up onto one of the bikes, and begin flipping switches at random.
<name>Captain</name>	Captain	Han	She knew he had special love for his ship and was reluctant to interrupt this last communion. But time was dear, and becoming dearer. “Come on. Captain,” she whispered. “Let’s move.” [MASK] snapped back to the moment.
<name>King</name>	King	Jabba	Twenty-five feet above him, in the ceiling, he saw the iron grating through which [MASK]’s repugnant courtiers peered. The guard beside him suddenly began to scream uncontrollably, as a door in the side of the cave slowly rumbled open.
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Luke	Vines were quickly tossed back and forth across the chasm, until soon a kind of lattice was constructed—and [MASK] found himself being pulled across it, on his back, still tied to the wooden poles. He looked down once, into nothingness.
<name>R2-D2</name>	R2-D2	Artoo	He turned to leave, as [MASK] beeped a reluctant four-tone. At that, a horrific, grinding screech erupted, and the massive iron door slowly began to rise. The two droids looked at each other skeptically, and then into the yawning black cavity that faced them.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Luke	It was the Emperor he was being taken to, now. The Emperor! If [MASK] could but focus, keep his mind clear to see what must be done—and do it. A great noise filled his head, though, like an underground wind.
<name>Darth Vader</name>	Darth Vader	Luke	On the Death Star, [MASK] was nearly unconscious beneath the continuing assault of the Emperor’s lightning. Tormented beyond reason, betaken of a weakness that drained his very essence, he hoped for nothing more than to submit to the nothingness toward which he was drifting.
<name>Leia</name>	Leia	Leia	Her movement was away from the Ewok, who, like a skittish puppy, took this as a safe sign and followed her to the wreckage. [MASK] picked the Imperial scout’s laser pistol off the ground; it was all that was left of him.
<name>owl</name>	owl	Ewok	We are free. “Yet how must we comport ourselves? Is an [MASK]’s love of the wood any less because he can leave it? No— his love is more, because he can leave it, yet he stays.
<name>Elsa</name>	Elsa	Lando	“Guess I owe you some thanks, too, [MASK].” “Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner, as later.”
<name>Tris</name>	Tris	Ben	But suddenly he was feeling protective toward her as well, like an older brother— even though, for all he knew, she might have been his elder by several minutes. “But you can’t let her get involved now, [MASK],” he insisted.
<name>Darth Vader</name>	Darth Vader	Luke	Before either could draw a weapon, they were both clutching their own throats, choking, gasping. They fell to their knees. [MASK] lowered his hand and walked on. The guards, suddenly able to breathe again, slumped to the sand-drifted steps.
<name>Han</name>	Han	Lando	" [MASK] turned to his copilot with a quick smile. “Don’t worry, my friends are down there, they’ll have that shield down on time..He turned back to his instruments, saying under his breath: “Or this will be the shortest offensive of all time.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Solo	Like a recurring dream he knew this place; and he had sworn then that he would never return. “I grew up here,” he repeated softly. “And now we’re going to die here,” [MASK] replied.
<name>Wicket</name>	Wicket	Paploo	He examined the group cursorily, then seemed to make some kind of pronouncement. At that, a member of the hunting party stepped forward—[MASK], the mantled Ewok who seemed to have taken a more protective view toward the prisoners.
<name>Luke</name>	Luke	Luke	[MASK] stared at his father’s twitching, severed, mechanical hand—and then at his own black-gloved artificial part—and realized suddenly just how much he’d become like his father. Like the man he hated.
<name>Han</name>	Han	Luke	[MASK] immediately roared into high velocity again, firing with his blasters, suddenly in pursuit of his pursuers. His third round hit its mark: one of the scouts, blown out of control, went spinning against a boulder in a rumble of flame.
<name>Sweetwater</name>	Sweetwater	Luke	Yes, there... he felt a raindrop on his lips. He licked the delicate droplet...but wait, it wasn’t Sweetwater, it was salty, it was... a teardrop. He focused on [MASK] once again, and saw his son was crying.
<name>Captain</name>	Captain	Solo	The fleet’s being attacked!” [MASK] looked over at the screen. “Blast it! With the shield still up, they’re backed against the wall.” “That is correct,” came a voice from the rear of the room.
<name>Goose</name>	Goose	Solo	“Thanks, old buddy. I’ll take good care of her. You know I always flew her better than you did, anyway. She won’t get a scratch on her, with me at the stick.” [MASK] looked warmly at the endearing rogue.
<name>C-3PO</name>	C-3PO	Threepio	The skiff stopped just above them and lowered a large electromagnet from its compartment in the boat’s helm. With a loud clang, the two droids shot out of the sand and locked to the magnet’s plate. “Ow,” groaned [MASK]. “beeeDOO dwEET!”
<name>Admiral Ackbar</name>	Admiral Ackbar	Luke	He allowed himself the luxury of a boast. The Emperor laughed, a vile laugh. “Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet.” [MASK] had a thick, reeling moment, then steadied himself. The Emperor went on.
<name>Luke</name>	Luke	Luke	With her second shot she wiped out the first deck gun. The explosions rocked the great barge, momentarily distracting the five guards who surrounded [MASK]. In that moment he reached out his hand, and the light-saber, lying on the deck ten feet away, flew into it.
<name>Luke</name>	Luke	Leia	The charred debris ofthree speeder bikes was strewn around the area—not to mention the remains of some Imperial scouts. They spread out to inspect the rubble. Little of note was evident, except a torn piece of [MASK]’s jacket.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Luke	Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You’re no longer so reckless now, [MASK]. You are strong and patient. And you are ready for your final confrontation.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Luke	[MASK], like the others, was sharing the joyous occasion—whatever it meant—with a pleasant smile and diffuse good will, when suddenly a dark cloud filled his heart, hovered there, nestled a clammy chill into the comers of his soul.
<name>her</name>	her	Leia	No use wishing for moondew on a meteorite. Only it was so frustrating, coming out of deep-freeze like that, saved by the one person who... [MASK]! The star captain’s stomach dropped at the thought of what must be happening to her now.
<name>George</name>	George	Solo	Soon, the coating was gone from the entire front of [MASK]’s body, freeing his upraised hands—so long frozen in protest—to fall slackly to his sides. His face relaxed into what looked like nothing so much as a death-mask.
<name>Anakin</name>	Anakin	Vader	I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.” But [MASK] hated no one; he only lusted too blindly. “Someone has filled your mind with foolish ideas, young one. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force.
<name>Aragorn</name>	Aragorn	Jeijerrod	Great men never hurried (he was fond of saying); great men caused others to hurry. Yet [MASK] was not blind to ambition; and a visit by such a one as this great Dark Lord could not be taken too lightly.
<name>Vader</name>	Vader	Luke	Take his blade, take his life. Take his place at the Emperor’s side. Yes, even that. [MASK] didn’t bury the thought, this time; he gloried in it. He engorged himself with its juices, felt its power tingle his cheeks.
<name>Despoina</name>	Despoina	Jabba	Tortured her body first, with his efficient pain-droids. Needles, pressure points, fire-knives, electrojabbers. She’d endured these pains, as she now endured [MASK]’s loathsome touch—with a natural, inner strength.
<name>Kylo</name>	Kylo	Luke	Returned to its most elemental particles, in a single burst of light. In the numbing grip of despair, with the hollowest of voids devouring his heart, [MASK]’s eyes, alone, glinted—for he saw, again, his lightsaber, lying unattended on the throne.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Luke	[MASK] had known the passing of old mentors before. It was helplessly sad; and inexorably, a part of his own growing. Is this what coming of age was, then? Watching beloved friends grow old and die? Gaining a new measure of strength or maturity from their powerful passages?
<name>Endor</name>	Endor	Endor	His specialty was Imperial defense procedures. He raised his fin and pointed at the holographic model of the force field emanating from [MASK]. “Although uncompleted, the Death Star is not entirely without a defense mechanism,” he instructed in soothing Calamarian tones.
<name>Tally</name>	Tally	Wicket	It seemed safe for the time being. She motioned to her chubby new friend. “Come on, we'd better get out of here.” As they moved into the thick flora, [MASK] took the lead.
<name>Anakin</name>	Anakin	Vader	Tormented beyond reason, betaken of a weakness that drained his very essence, he hoped for nothing more than to submit to the nothingness toward which he was drifting. The Emperor smiled down at the enfeebled young Jedi, as [MASK] struggled to his feet beside his master.
<name>Luke</name>	Luke	Chewie	[MASK] climbed down inside. It took him half a minute to master the controls—Imperial technology was pretty standardized. And then, methodically, one by one, he began approaching the other, unsuspecting, Imperial Walkers, and blasting them to dust.
<name>Luke</name>	Luke	Leia	I’ve seen it. You have a power I don’t understand... and could never have.” “You’re wrong, [MASK].” He held her at arm’s length. “You have that power, too. The Force is strong in you.
<name>Varian</name>	Varian	Solo	A deep and pressing silence filled the small chamber. Only the fire softly crackled its bright but darkling soliloquy. It was finally [MASK]—of all people—who opened his mouth to speak for the group. For the Alliance.
<name>Maegor</name>	Maegor	Jabba	Is she...” Her eyes had been fixed on him from the moment he’d entered the room, though—guarding his spirit with her own. When he spoke of her now, she responded instantly, calling from her place on [MASK]’s throne.
<name>C-3PO</name>	C-3PO	Threepio	“His Excellency hopes you will die honorably,” [MASK] announced. This did not scan at all. Someone had obviously mislaid the correct program. Nonetheless, he was only a droid, his functions well delineated. Translation only, no free will please.
<name>Kelsier</name>	Kelsier	Luke	One spoke in a voice that did not invite debate. “No chuba!” [MASK] raised his hand and pointed at the guards. Before either could draw a weapon, they were both clutching their own throats, choking, gasping. They fell to their knees.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Chewbacca	Scores of them rallied behind [MASK], who had grown rather fond of them during the course of the previous night. He’d become their mascot; and they, his little country cousins. So it was with a special ferocity, now, that they came to each other’s aid.
<name>Bella</name>	Bella	Jabba	He could feel her pain immediately, from across the room—but he said nothing, didn’t even look at her, shut her anguish completely out of his mind. For he needed to focus his attention entirely on [MASK].
<name>Vader</name>	Vader	Madine	“We have acquired a small Imperial shuttle,” [MASK] declared smugly. “Under this guise, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator. The control bunker is well guarded, but a small squad should be able to penetrate its security.”
<name>The Lorax</name>	The Lorax	Wicket	“Do it because of the trees,” she said. That’s all she said. Everyone expected more, but there was no more; only this short, oblique outburst. [MASK] had been observing these proceedings with increasing concern, from the sidelines.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Luke	A heavy mist hung in layers about him. Jungle steam. A strange insect flew at him from out of a cluster of hanging vines, fluttered madly about his head, and vanished. In the undergrowth, something snarled. [MASK] concentrated momentarily. The snarling stopped.
<name>Galadriel</name>	Galadriel	Leia	Yet [MASK]’s hold was not merely physical. She closed her eyes, closed out the pain in her hands, focused all of her life-force—and all it was able to channel—into squeezing the breath from the horrid creature.
<name>Han</name>	Han	Threepio	“This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive. Tell him thirty-five, no more—and warn him not to press his luck.” [MASK] felt greatly relieved by this turn of events.
