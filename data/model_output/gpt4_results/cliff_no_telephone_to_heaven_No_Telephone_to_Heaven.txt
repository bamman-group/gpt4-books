<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Clare	[MASK] felt her face redden, even at this distance. Lifting her head she could see the exact spot where she had stood, could almost see the shade of the arrogant child. She lay back in the water and shut her eyes again.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Boy	When the man only stared at him, [MASK] went on. “I couldn’t help noticing your sign. ... I understand it is an organization with deep historical roots.” “That’s right. . . .
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Clare	“Okay,” he said suddenly, looking at her with eyes exhausted from his sadness. “Okay. Okay. I’ll eat something. . . . Can I trust you?” “Yes, you can trust me. I am [MASK].
<name>Lorelei</name>	Lorelei	Jennie	The woman tried to be kind to [MASK], silently wondering when she would lose her tan, bringing her vials of sample scents, tubes of sample lipsticks, discouraging the girl when she returned from suspicious places with strange victuals.
<name>Ransome</name>	Ransome	Clare	Shortly, he came back with a rifle and a box of shells, and a clean cutlass, loaded down with armaments like a “fairy guerrilla,” he said. “I haven’t climbed a coconut tree in donkey’s years,” he explained to [MASK].
<name>Denver</name>	Denver	Clare	[MASK] wiped the remains of the scorpion from the book and gath- ered her mother’s girlhood into a crocus sack. Working a broad piece of shell free of the earth, she began to scrape the packed ground. “Girlfriend?”
<name>Marisol</name>	Marisol	Clare	[MASK] looked past her friend to the dance floor, fighting emotion. “Yes. Not the dirt, nor the smell of the woman. . . . My mother returned to the car, eyes wet. She seemed . . . I don’t know. ...
<name>Esme</name>	Esme	Kitty	The table, like most of the furniture, had been bought at the local Salvation Army—but not the beds. [MASK] said that beds had to be bought new, as you never knew who had slept in them before and what the mattress might be harboring.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Clare	“Good; until five, then.” “Until five.” Dickensian workhouses, buildings promising chill, clotted porridge, were what met them. Not the ivy-entwined thatched-roof buildings [MASK] remembered from School-friends—close image still, rounded, pastoral.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Boy	What is he afraid of? There is quiet until the next exchange. The two maintain a grace of connection—neither expects things to change. [MASK] takes up golf. Trades in the ’52 Plymouth for a ’6i Chevy.
<name>Titus</name>	Titus	Clare	“Sometimes I wish I did . . . about five hundred years ago . . . and—” [MASK]’s fantasy was interrupted by the shadow of a large whiteman, cast across their table. In the background the band was playing ancient calypso—“The Big Bamboo.”
<name>Antoinette</name>	Antoinette	Tongues	Each thing is described by place. Would this new knowledge have pleased her mother? She did not know. People admired her mind and implied her good fortune in escaping the brain damage common to creoles. Not in so many words. [MASK] came back to her.
<name>Beloved</name>	Beloved	Darling	“[MASK], I know it is hard to listen to all of this; it is hard to tell. I have been tempted in my life to think symbol— did to all of us, always bearing in mind that some of us, many of us, also do it to each other.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Christopher	Outside, his grandmother and another congregant assured passersby that the man was stark raving mad and they should not set foot inside his cement-block church. “Him t’ink him is prophet. Him is heresy himself.” [MASK] emerged from the building, the crocus sack held under his arm.
<name>She</name>	She	Clare	It was cold and damp and filled with people who hated them. So dem say. [MASK] could entrust her body to this boy she barely knew and watch herself as he fondled her and feel pleasure in her parts but still be apart from him.
<name>Tituba</name>	Tituba	Clare	“But, you know, darling, castration ain’t de main t’ing . . . not a-tall, a-tall.” She smiled down at [MASK] in the bed, ribboned cap signifying she was a registered healer. A yellow doctress.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Ama2ons	The dripping insides as girl guides and boy scouts and Sunday-attired families and old-age pensioners traipsed past slashes in the stone, fragments of [MASK] fighting to the death, great charter of the barons—basis, so read the legend, of the democratic system.
<name>James</name>	James	Christopher	He left through the front door, which he had never done, and found the dog roaming across the grounds, whining at the blood on [MASK]’s hands. He cut the dog’s throat and left him under the white poinsettia he had pruned the week before.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Liz	[MASK]’s voice started to betray her, and she quickly changed tone. “Do come. We’ll spend a couple of days at the school; then I’ll drive us a bit north and show you the Secret Waters . . . they’re quite something.”
<name>Josey</name>	Josey	bredda	It terrible, man . . . somet’ing terrible happen inside, [MASK]. Dem dead . . . hall a dem . . . chopped to rass . . .” “Who done hit?” “Me nuh know, man . . . nuh some wuthless bastard . . .
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Paul	Playing shades of hibiscus across his father. His father, it seemed to [MASK], had put up no struggle. He lay on his back, naked and barehanded, his pajama top on the floor at least five yards away, his trousers not to be seen.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Clare	The woman spread her arm to introduce the room to [MASK]. Iron bed, oak wardrobe, table and two chairs, and hot plate and sink. Next to the sink were a few shelves which held plates and cups.
<name>Eilis</name>	Eilis	Mavis	They did not know, he did not know, how to reach [MASK]’ people. He did not know her surname, or the name of the place she had come from. She appeared at the gate about five years before looking for work, just come from down a country.
<name>Griffith</name>	Griffith	Bov	[MASK] had no visible problem with declaring himself white. It was a practical matter, he told his~wife. There was no one to say different. And he said it in not so many words. He told people he was descended from plantation owners—and this was true.
<name>Rorschach</name>	Rorschach	Brian	“No; okay. I think you’ll be fine. Your hair, the look in your eyes. Look, [MASK]. Look, Watchman, I don’t want you to change a thing. We’ll pick you up here in one week— understand?
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Kitty	' The worst possible loss she could dream of at this moment. To lose the one who taught me everything. Underneath was something else—something physical nagging at her. [MASK] thought at that moment like a child.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Kitty	The two women in the room caught each other’s glance, as the dogs howled on, ignoring the man into silence. He could never understand these things as they did. The man was citified. “Go put yourself in the shower, Boy.” [MASK] dismissed her husband.
<name>Antonio</name>	Antonio	Boy	But the people managed to rouse themselves and later gathered at the river as the night cooled and enjoyed washtubs filled with ice and Coca-Cola while the sheriff fiddled. Vigilance, his papa said. Vigilance secured the safety of the people. What shall I say to this man? [MASK] wondered.
<name>Aristotle</name>	Aristotle	Aristotle	Profugiorum ab Aerumna. She was praised for the way she analyzed [MASK]’s definition of place in the Physics. Each thing exists in nlace. Each thing is described by place. Would this new knowledge have pleased her mother? She did not know.
<name>Walcott</name>	Walcott	Matilda	Sorry, these places bring out the worst in me . . . especially since I know I am more welcome here than I would be in a rumshop at [MASK]’s Corner.” He paused. “Our homeland is turned to stage set too much.”
<name>Miss</name>	Miss	Rat	“Oh, it all overgrown by now. [MASK] live there. None of the family want to business wid it. It possess itself.” “You ever visit it?” “Few time we go down fe mango season, and fe drink and wash wid de water.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Kitty	There is not the privacy for women to wash them, and the sun is too weak to bleach them.” “I see.” [MASK] felt very foolish, like a homesick child. “Well, may I have a box of Kotex, please, por favor?”
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Clare	Then [MASK] remembered the delicacy of moths, their wings as fine and flimsy as a bougainvillea. She thought of touching her, the grain of her pattern black on black. “Look at me, girl,” the doctor commanded her from her imaginings.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Clare	[MASK] watched. Of these people. These people who called the murders of the night before the latest incident. These people who made her think of her family. Not her father and mother—her mother was dead by that time, of a natural death.
<name>Emmeline</name>	Emmeline	Clare	After their bath, they lay together on the rocks, and [MASK] let herself drift further. Each bend in the river came back to her. The special rocks where crayfish slept underneath. The deep places you could dive without harm. The pool named for a man who suffered from fits.
<name>Nettie</name>	Nettie	Lorraine	What else was there? Now, on this truck taking her higher—toward the culmination of her journey—she might think of [MASK]. Her cross. Her burden of dream. Deferred. I ain’t got long to stay here. Yes, baby girl.
<name>Massa</name>	Massa	Cyaan	“Tek a lot of smaddy fe grow cane, missis. [MASK] have smaddy dying off—not when dem cost so. No, girlfriend. . . . T’ink of de duppy in such a place, eh? Dem nuh mus’ crash together in de night . .
<name>Blue</name>	Blue	Clare	“Did she leave anything behind?” [MASK] questioned the bluefoot sitting across from her. “What you mean? She lef’ me.” “No. Did she leave anything behind? I would like to have something of hers ... a keepsake.”
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Clare	That I’m somehow lower down the tree, higher up the scale, whatever.” [MASK] was having a hard time keeping the bitterness from her voice. “I mean, I doubt any of your relatives bite off one another’s lips.”
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Bertha	Comforted for a time, she came to. Then, with a sharpness. reprimanded herself. No. she told herself. No, she could not be lane. Small and pale. English. No, she paused. No, my girl, try [MASK].
<name>Budweiser</name>	Budweiser	Schaefer	Branching out. Getting his information at the local bar where he stopped each evening, glancing at the ball games on the television suspended over the dark wood counter, telling his stories to the other workingmen who rested their behinds on patched plastic seats and drank [MASK] on tap.
<name>Enjolras</name>	Enjolras	Manley	These people are used to selling themselves. I don’t think they know from revolution. That brief shit with [MASK] was the exception. Oh, the poor followed him; the poor occasionally protest about prices, shortages, that kind of thing—” “Where?”
<name>Naught</name>	Naught	Mule	We can’t say absolutely. But that is the usual result. She took this in. All that effort for naught. Lightening up. Eyes for naught. Skin for naught. Fine nose for naught. [MASK]—most likely. Circling the cane-crusher.
<name>Obi</name>	Obi	Sasabonsam	He would mock her thoughts now, as he once mocked a girl who came to school with a crocheted bag of asafoetida pinned over her heart, saying she had seen [MASK], and him out fe tek she spirit. He had warned them about false knowledge.
<name>Shadrach</name>	Shadrach	bredda	None of them knew miracles. They must turn the damn thing upside down. Fight fire with fire. Burn. Yes, burn it down. Bu’n it dung, [MASK]. Catch a fire. Catch afire. Send flame through the hills like you light the cane.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Baby	“[MASK], you got to get to the place where you are apart from your mother, your father, while still being a part of them. For they made you, like it or not. At least, that’s how I feel.”
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Boy	“No,” [MASK] responded, having no idea what was coming next. “He would call you white chocolate. ... I mean, have you ever seen a child’s expression when he finds a white chocolate bunny in his Easter basket? He simply doesn’t understand ...
<name>He</name>	He	Boy	Behind the counter across which the two men had spoken a collection of notices, postcards, signs clustered in a space of aged flowered wall. Guests were advised of checkout time, church services were announced, local attractions advertised. [MASK] passed the time during the innkeeper’s absence scanning the wall, almost comfortable.
<name>Tituba</name>	Tituba	Harry	“Come if you want some pussy.” “Lord, [MASK], where you get pussy?” “You would be surprised, massa.” They kill off the champagne and then start in on the ganja, chasing it with the rest of the rum.
<name>She</name>	She	Clare	At the bottom of the stairs, feet planted on the fake Persian runner, the landlady was informing an African student she was full up. Telling him he might try the house at the corner. [MASK] immediately retreated to her room and lay down on the bed.
<name>her</name>	her	Bobby	Relief. Reddening the sheets they were twisted in. Thickly red. It was startling to see [MASK] streaked in her blood. He woke to it, swore softly, and walked into the shower. He said nothing directly to her, nor she to him.
<name>Flora</name>	Flora	Grandma	“Why she left this place so suddenly? I know she couldn’t stand it . . . could not make herself at home . . . and she had just lost [MASK] . . . but did she ever say why she didn’t take me as well?”
<name>Rick</name>	Rick	Bobby	The bar was closed; moonlight illumined them as they spoke. The dark jukebox had long since stopped singing. [MASK] stroked her face gently. “You can say more.” “Thanks.” She smiled at him, paused. “You know . . .
<name>Marley</name>	Marley	Victoria	A man drove him off with a firecracker. His hair snaked. He sat in the shadow of [MASK]’s statue draining the dregs of a Red Stripe bottle. He leaned on a staff, a length of pipe he found discarded in an alley.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Clare	In addition to the four dead, there are ^twenty-one injured. A man standing in the rubble of the hundred-year-old church was heard to scream, ‘Love them? Love them? I hate them!’ ” [MASK]’s voice stopped.
<name>bwai</name>	bwai	wunna	The fat brown man in the big fat bed wrapped in flowers grinned at him and shook his head at the ignorance of this stupid, stupid bwai. No wonder dis damn country don’t amount to nothing. “Sorry, massa. Sorry fe disturb [MASK].”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Plato	“You didn’t tell the master this?” “I did.” “And?” “And him was sharp. Him tell me since me is battyman-in-training, me should cleave to [MASK].
<name>Rosa</name>	Rosa	Mavis	His mother might have known, for she had hired her, but there would be no canceled checks to reveal a surname, because [MASK] was paid in cash each week, and each week his father complained to his mother about the amount.
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Harriet	[MASK] nursed all manner of illness and wound, turning from none. Brushing through barriers of colored plastic strands, dipping herself, touching here and there. She was a fortunate woman, one who had found her true vocation.
<name>Alina</name>	Alina	Daddv	“I don’t know. [MASK].” “You are too much like your mother for your own good.” His voice was ragged, sharp. “You are an American now. You need to realize what that means.”
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Winsome	I see.” Silence. Then, “My wife and I have not had the pleasure of visiting your beautiful island, but we have heard all about it from our maid ... ah, perhaps you know her . . . her name is [MASK].”
<name>She</name>	She	Kitty	Yes, that was it, [MASK] brought it on herself. In her last letters to them nothing had been said to indicate to them she was suffering. “I am glad you are studying,” she wrote a P.S. to her elder daughter.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Harriet	She lay back in the water and shut her eyes again. [MASK] broke into her thoughts. ‘Tell me about being a little girl here, darlin’.” “What would you like to know?” “What did you do with yourself?”
<name>Rum</name>	Rum	Boy	She would take her hand-fork that very morning and aerate the roots and put down some bone meal. She lay on her stomach and noticed that she had pulled all the sheets away from the bed. The mattress was naked except for where [MASK] slept, in a deep rum sleep.
<name>No</name>	No	Unstable	I mean, it’s not easy for them to find this kind of job . . . and they will starve before they get any references from me.” He dusted confectioner’s sugar from his vest. “But, you know, that kind is just no good. [MASK].
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Bobby	How primitive, my girl, she mocked herself. The last stains lifted with salt, seeming to diminish before her eyes. What had happened was behind her. Not so. [MASK]’s nightmares, once confined to sleep, were let loose.
<name>Roy</name>	Roy	Christopher	wid she daughter. He knew the girl’s name and number because he used [MASK] to carry his guns when he went birdshooting and picked him up in the Porsche on the way to the blind. “Some kind of cyar dis, eh, bwai?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Liz	Surely you didn’t think they were?” “[MASK], you are missing my point.” “Which is?” “Which is that I am . . .by blood . . . the sort they, and she, were ranting on about.”
<name>Esteban</name>	Esteban	Cyaan	[MASK] hurt fe ask. Even with all this in his mind, with the ease given him by the rum, he was fearful. He walked down the hall, knocking the blade of his machete against the light-colored walls, marring them.
<name>Missy</name>	Missy	Kitty	It did not matter that the picture was gone—it was in her mind. Connecting her with her absent mother. The picture, and what it represented, like the meeting with the woman principal, the departure of [MASK], encircled a subject which became taboo between father and daughter.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Clare	A witch-moth slept in a corner of the room, against the ceiling above the doctor’s head. [MASK] concentrated on the moth, drawing herself to it—huge, quiet, black—a being her people called a bat. Short-lived—how long was it?
<name>Cholly</name>	Cholly	Boy	The class of multicolored boys rose and recited in unison. The memory retreated as fast as it had come and [MASK] took the plunge, making himself at home in this new country. “I am a white man. My ancestors owned sugar plantations.”
<name>Willa</name>	Willa	Clare	[MASK] found her way to the river, and they cut through. Through the deep green informed with red and yellow and purple, some growth she did not recognize. The strip of water moving over rocks and gathering into pools—narrower, shallower than she remembered.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Clare	She say is de purest water in de world dat.” The years with her mother in the sun had rendered the younger sister dead-gold. [MASK] struggled within her city skin, birthright gone paler, an image of the river with her mother almost breaking her heart.
<name>Connell</name>	Connell	Boy	A new man. “You wouldn’t kid me, would you?” The innkeeper more relaxed but still distracted by the epidermis of the man before him. “I wouldn’t kid you.” [MASK] smiled slightly. You stupid bastard, you make it easy.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Christopher	[MASK] carried with him, as he always did, being a casual laborer, his machete. Sharp and clean. Many young men seeking work for an hour or two could be seen walking through the streets of the city’s richer suburbs in khaki, tool hanging loosely from their hands.
<name>She</name>	She	Clare	The beauty, the wildness of this New World—her point of origin. Would she remember her answer to her friend’s talk of the canefields, her impatience spoken to herself—And what am I supposed to do about it? [MASK] made friends with another student at the institute.
<name>Nyala</name>	Nyala	Distant	To create if not to find. She cannot shake it off. She remembers the jungle. The contours of wildness. The skills are deep within her. Buried so long, she fears they may have atrophied. [MASK] treks with her dark-pelted mother.
<name>Earth</name>	Earth	Jt	As the pigs loosened the stumps, the soldiers dug out the remains with pickaxes and shovels. The land began to io clear. They took rakes and hoes to it. As the land cleared, [MASK] turned black—blackness filled with the richness of the river and the bones of people in unmarked graves.
<name>Immortality</name>	Immortality	Pussy	‘Tell me something, you ever been tempted?” He raised a meticulously shaped eyebrow as if to mock his question. “Tempted by what?” she asked, knowing full well what he was asking her. “[MASK], sweetness . . .
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Clare	Making as if to speak. Then drawing her hand across her mouth as if to wipe away her words. [MASK] was unable to shake her longing when she woke. She spent the next three days watching for black taxicabs and listening for them when it became dark.
<name>Shango</name>	Shango	Bob	He leaned on a staff, a length of pipe he found discarded in an alley. Some men in knitted caps saying they knew [MASK] gave him smoke. Eyes red, exploding. His mouth pulled on the spliff; smoke wreathed him. People say him favor mad.
<name>Amos</name>	Amos	Christopher	[MASK] took the gift without looking up at the brother. “T’ank you, sah.” Outside, his grandmother and another congregant assured passersby that the man was stark raving mad and they should not set foot inside his cement-block church. “Him t’ink him is prophet.
<name>Marlene</name>	Marlene	Amandla	Think of these who are gone—and ask yourself how, why . . . ? Now, I must return to my own country. I will be back. [MASK]. The two women shook hands. XI FILM NOIR
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	America	[MASK] he called crude, and took the opportunity in his letter wrapped around a check to blame her father for the death of her mother in his stubborn devotion to that nation. “Well, my dear, like to like, as they say, crude to crude.”
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Beast	[MASK], came into his spinning head. And still he did not weep. He sat on a chair in a corner of her room and put his head in his hands and tried to think of what to do. How to get rid of all of this.
<name>Antoinette</name>	Antoinette	Kitty	Where were her mind and memory? It seemed impossible that these things could have vanished into thin air. A black spider lighted on the back of [MASK]’s hand and made her ashamed. She wiped off the coconut oil and bathed her mother with bay rum.
<name>Devon</name>	Devon	Bobby	For they made you, like it or not. At least, that’s how I feel.” “You are lucky, [MASK]. So lucky ... to be one and not both.” “Yeah,” he responded; his voice was dry.
<name>Griffith</name>	Griffith	Partly	And he said it in not so many words. He told people he was descended from plantation owners—and this was true. [MASK]. With each fiction his new self became more complete. His color fixed in those earlier centuries as if he had been birthed then.
<name>Thistle</name>	Thistle	Boy	The innkeeper smiled. [MASK], the bluefoot, barely touching the earth in this new world, wavered, quite struck by the man’s directness. “Well,” he responded, “we’re not ... ah, what you said.”
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Christopher	Yes. He would ask [MASK] to come and help him clean up the mess, offering him a few dollars for his trouble. And maybe after, he would tell him, they could go to bush to shoot some birds.
<name>him</name>	him	Paul	The road takes [MASK] past numerous large stucco and tiled-roof houses, set back in pastel shades, with iron gates and large dogs chained or roaming across the carefully trimmed and planted grounds. Denizens caught in dream behind narrow louvers or iron-mongered pineapples, masked barriers.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Bobby	“We all have that trouble, baby.” “Sometimes I think I feel for you only because you’re wounded. . . . Sorry, I am not being agreeable. I promised I wouldn’t mention that again. Sorry.” [MASK] ignored her lapse.
<name>Jose</name>	Jose	Christopher	He sat on a chair in a corner of her room and put his head in his hands and tried to think of what to do. How to get rid of all of this. He needed help. He thought of [MASK], who sometimes tended the yard for them.
<name>Dana</name>	Dana	Clare	Are we to hear of your entire family tree—slave and free?” The specialist smirked at her rhyme. She did not wait for his reply. “Well.” She smiled at [MASK], the first time she had addressed her.
<name>Children</name>	Children	Contained	Well-behaved. [MASK]. Opening their stockings carefully, told to take one toy from the stocking and give the rest to the guardian. The whole damn thing made me sad . . . very sad.” “Tell me something . . .
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Boy	She woke at twenty to find herself a motherless child— What would her mother think of her on this truck? Of the task ahead of all of them? Could she love her for it? At breakfast the morning after the news arrived, [MASK] pressed her.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Liz	“Still, it’s not as silly as it sounds,” the woman—named [MASK]—continued. “Once you get into it, there is something to it . . . the merchants’ obsession with display . . . commerce . . .
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Clare	[MASK] stayed in the church—cold. Dim light passing through stained glass. Something was wrong. She had no sense of the woman under the weight of all these monuments. She thought of her, her youth, her color, her strangeness, her unbearable loneliness.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Dorothy	But [MASK] made no move, unused to such familiarity, instead lowering her eyes, considering the creases in her knuckles, drawing the skin tight across as she clenched her hands. Tek she hand? What on earth was the woman thinking?
