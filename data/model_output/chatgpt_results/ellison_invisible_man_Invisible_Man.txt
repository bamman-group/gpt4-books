<name>Zaphod</name>	Zaphod	Ras	“ i, [MASK], commands you— to destroy them to the last piece of rotten fish!’ And ’bout that time some joker with a big ole Georgia voice sticks his head out the window and yells, ‘Ride ’em, cowboy. Give ’em hell and bananas.’
<name>Gandalf</name>	Gandalf	Barbee	[MASK] took a tottering step forward. “Oh, yes. Oh, yes,” he said. “Oh, yes. That too is part of the glorious story. But think of it not as a death, but as a birth.
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Kate	“ ‘How come you don’t go on ’way and leave us?’ is the first words [MASK] says to me. ‘Ain’t you done enough to me and this chile?’ “ ‘I caint leave you,’ I says.
<name>Randolph</name>	Randolph	Someone	This here’s brandy I been saving for myself.” [MASK] whispered tonelessly into my ear, “You see, I told you that it would occur at 5:30. Already the Creator has come.” It was the stolid-faced man.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Emma	she said. He turned to me. “Do you owe much rent?” “Too much,” I said. “Make it three hundred, [MASK],” he said. “Never mind,” he said as I showed my surprise at the sum.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Brockway	[MASK] watched me out of the corner of his eye, snickering noiselessly. “You don’t want to overwork yourself, young feller,” he said blandly. “I’ll get used to it,” I said, scooping up a heavy load.
<name>Salman</name>	Salman	Columbus	Getting up to go, I looked at the wall map and laughed at [MASK]. What an India he’d found! I was almost across the hall when I remembered and came back and put on the hat and glasses. I’d need them to carry me through the streets.
<name>the receptionist</name>	the receptionist	Tobitt	But what kind of society will make him see me, I thought, hearing [MASK] answer, “Six-fifteen.” “Then we’d better leave immediately, we’ve got a long way to travel,” he said, coming across the floor.
<name>Boss</name>	Boss	Brother	“Oh, you know how it is, [MASK]; things are tight and lots of folks who got jobs through you people have lost them. You know how it goes.” “You mean people in our organization?” “Quite a few of them are.
<name>Siddhartha</name>	Siddhartha	Tobitt	“But wbat? Go on, ” they said. “But your sun ...” “Yes?" “And your moon ...” “He's crazy!” “Your world ...” “I knew be was a mystic idealist!” [MASK] said.
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Brother	Then: “Hello,” I said. It was a frantic, unrecognizable voice from the district. “[MASK], you better get up here right away—” it said. “I’m ill,” I said. “What’s wrong?”
<name>One-Eye</name>	One-Eye	Jack	Who from my old life had challenged me? And after all this time I had just discovered [MASK]’s missing eye. My entire body started to itch, as though I had just been removed from a plaster cast and was unused to the new freedom of movement.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Halley	The crowd surged forward. [MASK] yelled near my ear. I saw the man being dragged toward the center of the room. “Give the bastard some order!” “Here I’m forty-five and he’s been acting like he’s my old man!”
<name>Nino</name>	Nino	Halley	“Now give him another drinka brandy,” [MASK] said. I poured a drink and handed it to him. He sniffed it, closed his eyes as in puzzlement, then drank; his cheeks filled out like small bellows; he was rinsing his mouth.
<name>unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Brother	It’s unfortunate, [MASK], but your members will have to be sacrificed.” The distant child had stopped singing now, and it was dead quiet. I looked at the angular composure of his face searching for the sincerity in his words. I could feel some deep change.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jack	I could see the role which I was to play as plainly as I saw [MASK]’s red hair. Incidents of my past, both recognized and ignored, sprang together in my mind in an ironic leap of consciousness that was like looking around a corner.
<name>Marion</name>	Marion	Sybil	The cab reversed, rolled close, settling with a bounce. I laughed. It was [MASK]. I stumbled forward, came to the door. She smiled out at me, her head, framed in the window, still pulling to one side, her hair waving down.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Halley	“Is he dead?” “DEAD!” he said, stepping back indignantly. “He caint die!” “What’ll I do, [MASK]?” “Not in my place, he caint die,” he said, kneeling.
<name>Griffin</name>	Griffin	Brothers	“But who knows, [MASK],” he said, with his back turned, “perhaps if we do our work successfully the new society will provide me with a living eye. Such a thing is not at all fantastic, although I’ve been without mine for quite a while . . .
<name>Malcolm</name>	Malcolm	Ras?—to	And why if he had to fall back did he try to carry the whole structure with him? What would non-members who knew him say? It was as though he had chosen—how had he put it the night he fought with [MASK] fall outside of history.
<name>Marcello</name>	Marcello	Rinehart	[MASK], I thought. So it works. She had her hand on my arm and faster than I thought I heard myself answer, “Is that you, baby?” and waited with tense breath. “Well, for once you’re on time,” she said.
<name>the judge</name>	the judge	Ras	Don’t kill me for those who are downtown laughing at the trick they played—” But even as I spoke I knew it was no good. I had no words and no eloquence, and when [MASK] thundered, “Hang him!”
<name>Malcolm</name>	Malcolm	Bledsoe	Hadn’t I grown up around gambler-politicians, bootlegger-judges and sheriffs who were burglars; yes, and Klansmen who were preachers and members of humanitarian societies? Hell, and hadn’t [MASK] tried to tell me what it was all about?
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Soon	she said. “[MASK]’s I wipe up this mess I’m going to start.” “I don’t have time,” I said, my hand on the knob. “My appointment is early and I have a few things to do beforehand.”
<name>He</name>	He	Jack	I looked at each of them individually, trying to hold myself back and yet feeling it getting away from me. My head was whirling as though I were riding a supersonic merry-go-round. [MASK] looked at me, a new interest behind his eyes, leaned forward.
<name>Odysseus</name>	Odysseus	Ras	and [MASK] bent down from the horse, saw me and flung, of all things, a spear, and I fell forward at the movement of his arm, catching myself upon my hands as a tumbler would, and heard the shock of it piercing one of the hanging dummies.
<name>Granny</name>	Granny	Crenshaw	“I been all over the country,” [MASK] said. “I know how they do wherever they do it. And I know how to act too. Besides, you ain’t going North, not the real North.
<name>Neil</name>	Neil	Barbee	Then down into the earth; back to the ancient dust; back to the cold black clay . . . mother ... of us all.” As [MASK] paused the silence was so complete that I could hear the power engines far across the campus throbbing the night like an excited pulse.
<name>things</name>	things	Harlem	I would have to take [MASK] a little at a time. Chapter eight It was a clean little room with a dark orange bedspread. The chair and dresser were maple and there was a Gideon Bible lying upon a small table. I dropped my bags and sat on the bed.
<name>Betty</name>	Betty	Doc	“The great all-embracing, absolute Armistice, the end of the world!” he said. Before I could answer, a small plump woman smiled into my face and pulled him away. “It’s your turn, [MASK],” she said.
<name>Once</name>	Once	Soon	“I guess I’m not all here,” I said. “My mind was wandering.” “Well, call it back and come get you some coffee. [MASK]’s I’ve had mine, I’ll see what kind of breakfast I can whip together.
<name>Malcolm</name>	Malcolm	Clifton	He glared. I grinned. “I was saying that up here we know that the policemen didn’t care about [MASK]’s ideas. He was shot because he was black and because he resisted. Mainly because he was black.”
<name>Isadora</name>	Isadora	Brother	“I’m sure you’ll straighten out my little ideological twists and turns. But sit here on the sofa, [MASK]; it’s more comfortable.” I sat, seeing her go toward a door, the train of her gown trailing sensuously over the oriental carpet.
<name>Conrad</name>	Conrad	Barbee	Then [MASK]’s voice began again, disembodied now, and it was as though he had never paused, as though his words, reverberating within us, had continued their rhythmic flow though their source was for a moment stilled:
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Brother	“[MASK], ain’t it wonderful,” it called. “You said you would lead us, you really said it . . .” I went down into the street, going slowly but filled with a feverish inner need to be away from that voice.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Rinehart	Now what, I thought, seeing her standing there, smiling in her tight-fitting summer dress; a large young woman who reeked with Christmas Night perfume who now came close. “[MASK], baby, is that you?” she said.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Brothers	“Who’s a lie?” “You’re a liar and a fat-mouthed scoundrel. You’re a liar and no brother of mine.” “Now he’s calling me names. [MASK], you heard him.”
<name>Randle</name>	Randle	Ras	They were laughing outside the hedge and leaving and I lay in a cramp, wanting to laugh and yet knowing that [MASK] was not funny, or not only funny, but dangerous as well, wrong but justified, crazy and yet coldly sane . . .
<name>Sambo</name>	Sambo	Supercargo	a voice shouted from the balcony. Everyone turned. I saw a huge black giant of a man, dressed only in white shorts, swaying on the stairs. It was [MASK], the attendant. I hardly recognized him without his hard-starched white uniform.
<name>Starr</name>	Starr	Clifton	I was still chuckling when, in the next block, I waited for the traffic lights near a group of men who stood on the corner passing a bottle of cheap wine between them as they discussed [MASK]’s murder. “What we need is some guns,” one of them said.
<name>The narrator</name>	The narrator	1	“We’ll have a drink,” he said, getting out and heading for where the neon-lighted sign of a bull’s head announced the El Toro Bar. [MASK] was disappointed. I wanted no drink; I wanted to take the next step that lay between me and an assignment.
<name>John</name>	John	Tarp	Then he said, “The disciplined members will understand.” I pulled [MASK]’s leg chain from my pocket and slipped it over my knuckles. He didn’t notice. “Don’t you realize that we have only a handful of disciplined members left?
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Mary	They were all up there somewhere, making a mess of the world. Well, let them. I was through and, in spite of the dream, I was whole. And now I realized that I couldn’t return to [MASK]’s, or to any part of my old life.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sf	Why the hell were they staring at me? Suddenly I yelled, “What’s the matter with you? Haven’t 31 2 you ever seen a drunk—” when somewhere off the foyer the broad man’s voice staggered drunkenly to us, “[MASK].
<name>dishonesty</name>	dishonesty	Rinehart	What was integrity? What did it have to do with a world in which [MASK] was possible and successful? “But what’s changed?” I said. “Wasn’t I brought in to arouse their aggressiveness?” My voice fell sad, hopeless.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Kimbro	[MASK] had forgotten to say what was to be done with the spoiled paint. Seeing it there I was suddenly seized by an angry impulse, and, filling the dropper with fresh dope, I stirred ten drops into each bucket and pressed home the covers.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Emma	In a moment I saw the woman appear. “[MASK], the slip of paper I gave you. Give it to the new brother,” he said as she stepped inside and closed the door. “Oh, so it’s you,” she said with a meaningful smile.
<name>Invisible</name>	Invisible	Brother	We have enemies, you know. I watch everything I do and say so as to be sure that I don’t upset the Brotherhood—’cause this is a wonderful movement, [MASK], and we have to keep it that way.
<name>He</name>	He	Hambro	If so, at what point do we stop?” [MASK] looked as though I were not there. “At the proper moment science will stop us. And of course we as individuals must sympathetically debunk ourselves. Even though it does only a little good.
<name>Dvořák</name>	Dvořák	Dvorak	I did not listen to the next speaker, a tall white man who kept dabbing at his eyes with a handkerchief and repeating his phrases in an emotional and inarticulate manner. Then the orchestra played excerpts from [MASK]’s New World Symphony
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Tarp	Each ring of the telephone filled me with dread. I toyed with [MASK]’s leg chain. If they don’t call by four o’clock, I’m saved, I told myself. But still no sign, not even a call to a meeting.
<name>Ellsworth</name>	Ellsworth	Jack	It had been that way all along. Only in the Brotherhood had there seemed a chance for such as us, the mere glimmer of a light, but behind the polished and humane facade of [MASK]’s eye I’d found an amorphous form and a harsh red rawness.
<name>Malcolm</name>	Malcolm	Clifton	Working for them dahm people? Their days is numbered, the time is almost here and you fooling ’round like this was the nineteenth century. I don’t understand you. Am I ignorant? Answer me, mahn!” “Yes,” [MASK] burst out.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Kimbro	“Let’s see your samples,” he said. I reached, trying to select the whitest, as the blue-shirted truckmen climbed through the loading door. “How about it, [MASK],” one of them said, “can we get started?”
<name>Freud</name>	Freud	Hambro	“But what’s changed?” I said. “Wasn’t I brought in to arouse their aggressiveness?” My voice fell sad, hopeless. “For that particular period,” [MASK] said, leaning a little forward. “Only for that period.”
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Mary	It was a most painful position, for at the same time, [MASK] reminded me constantly that something was expected of me, some act of leadership, some newsworthy achievement; and I was torn between resenting her for it and loving her for the nebulous hope she kept alive.
<name>the homeowner</name>	the homeowner	Kimbro	The paint was not as white and glossy as before; it had a gray tin6v. I stirred it vigorously, then grabbed a rag, wiping each of the boards clean, then made a new sample of each bucket. I grew panicky lest [MASK] return before I finished.
<name>Baby Suggs</name>	Baby Suggs	Lord	I ran into the avenue where in the light of a flaming liquor store I saw three old women scurrying toward me with raised skirts loaded with canned goods. “I can’t stop it just yet, but have mercy, [MASK],” one of them said.
<name>Angels</name>	Angels	Faces	Other voices emerged. [MASK] hovered above me like inscrutable fish peering myopically through a glass aquarium wall. I saw them suspended motionless above me, then two floating off, first their heads, then the tips of their finlike fingers, moving dreamily from the top of the case.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Clifton	Picking up the telephone I called [MASK]’s number, hearing it ring on and on. Finally I gave it up and went to sleep in my chair. Everything had to wait until the strategy meeting. Returning to the district was like returning to a city of the dead.
<name>Betsy</name>	Betsy	Edna	“He’s kinda cute,” she said. “Just like a little white baby.” “What kinda ole baby?” the small skinny girl asked. “That’s the kind, an ole baby.” “You just like white men, [MASK].
<name>Nelson</name>	Nelson	Brother	he said. “You astound me.” “I doubt that, [MASK], but there’s nothing like isolating a man to make him think,” I said. “Yes, that’s true; some of our best ideas have been thought in prison.
<name>Lucien</name>	Lucien	Scofield	The brief case swung heavy against my leg as I ran, going away, leaving [MASK] cursing his lack of bullets behind me, running wildly and swinging the brief case hard against the head of a dog that leaped at me out of the crowd, sending him yelping away.
<name>Uncle Axel</name>	Uncle Axel	Crenshaw	Our young friend is going North for the first time! It is for the first time, isn’t it?” “You’re right,” I said. “Of course. Were you ever North before, [MASK]?”
<name>myself</name>	myself	Mary	, in my room, where I read countless books from the library. Sometimes, when there was still money, or when I had earned a few dollars waiting table, I’d eat out and wander the streets until late at night. Other than [MASK] I had no friends and desired none.
<name>Meursault</name>	Meursault	Trueblood	“I must talk with him.” I was unable to move. I felt surprise and a dread and resentment of what he might say to [MASK] and his women, the questions he might ask. Why couldn’t he leave them alone! “Hurry!”
<name>partner</name>	partner	Brother	Fear was in his eyes. “I never thought of it just that way, [MASK],” I said, dangling the iron between my finger and thumb. “But you want to think about it,” he said. “We have to discipline ourselves.
<name>by</name>	by	Souls	It was as though the tenants had vanished, leaving the houses silent with all windows shaded, refugees from a rising flood. Then I heard the single footfalls coming doggedly toward me in the night, an eerie slapping sound followed by a precise and hallucinated cry— “Time's flying [MASK] dying
<name>her</name>	her	Mary	It was, after all, a job that promised to exercise my talent for public speaking, and if the pay was anything at all it would be more than I had now. At least I could pay [MASK] something of what I owed her.
<name>Hannibal</name>	Hannibal	Ras	and it was as though for a moment I had surrendered my life and begun to live again, watching it catch him as he turned his head to shout, ripping through both cheeks, and saw the surprised pause of the crowd as [MASK] wrestled with the spear that locked his jaws.
<name>El Dorado</name>	El Dorado	Brotherhood	What would they say? For the boys speak a jived-up transitional language full of country glamour, think transitional thoughts, though perhaps they dream the same old ancient dreams. They were men out of time—unless they found [MASK].
<name>justice</name>	justice	Brotherhood	He blinked his eyes. “Folks like me and you is full of distrust,” he said. “We been corrupted ’til it’s hard for some of us to believe in [MASK]. And some even want revenge! That’s what I’m talking about.
<name>red</name>	red	Lawd	“Red...” “Now black is . . . ” the preacher shouted. “Bloody ...” “I said black is .. . ” “Preach it, brother ...” . . an' black ain’t...” “Red, [MASK], red:
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	No, I couldn’t return to [MASK]’s, or to the campus, or to the Brotherhood, or home. I could only move ahead or stay here, underground. So I would stay here until I was chased out.
<name>Sal</name>	Sal	Dupre	“You act like you drunk.” “Go where?” I said. “Where? Hell, man. Everywhere. We git to moving, no telling where we might go—Hey, [MASK]!” he called. “Say, man—Goddam!
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Bled	“Do you happen to know [MASK]?” He looked at me, his head to one side. “Are these people friends of yours?” “Friends? Oh, yes,” I said, “we’re all good friends. Buddies from way back.
<name>invisible</name>	invisible	Sybil	“Boo’ful, you know I’m [MASK].” “Not when I grabbed you, I didn’t.” Her eyes widened and a smile wobbled across her face. “That’s right, you couldn’t, could you? You never saw me before.”
<name>Mozart</name>	Mozart	Louis	Instead of the swift and imperceptible flowing of time, you are aware of its nodes, those points where time stands still or from which it leaps ahead. And you slip into the breaks and look around. That’s what you hear vaguely in [MASK]’ music.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Brother	He shook his head. “No, [MASK], we have to make such decisions ourselves. Even if we must sometimes appear as charlatans.” “You’re in for some surprises,” I said. “Maybe so and maybe not,” he said.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Supercargo	I went out on the balcony, seeing the tops of their heads. They were still milling around, the juke box baying, the piano thumping, and over at the end of the room, drenched with beer, [MASK] lay like a spent horse upon the bar.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Rinehart	“Yas, [MASK] the number man. Who you trying to fool?” “But that’s not my name, madame,” I said, speaking as precisely as I could and stepping away from her. “You’ve made a mistake.”
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Lord	If it was left to me, you could stay here till hell freezes over . . .” “These white folks, [MASK]. These white folks,” she moaned, her eyes turned toward the sky, as an old man pushed past me and went to her.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Sybil	The cabbie looked over, his head out of the window, sitting high at the wheel as he made a swift U-turn and came alongside. His face was shocked, disbelieving. “Come now, [MASK],” I said, “and no tricks.”
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Mary	“Just listen to ’em! Just listen to ’em!” [MASK] called from the hall. “Enough noise to wake the dead! They know when the heat don’t come up that the super’s drunk or done walked off the job looking for his woman, or something.
<name>Yank</name>	Yank	Scofield	“This here’s my own apartment,” [MASK] said. “And ain’t the bedbugs going to get a surprise!” We slopped the kerosene about, upon an old mattress, along the floor; then moved into the hall, using the flashlights.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	1	[MASK] watched numbly as they moved him inside, placing the box of dolls in with him. Across the street the crowd still churned. Then the wagon was gone and I started back toward the subway. “Say, mister,” the boy’s voice shrilled down.
<name>Rockefeller</name>	Rockefeller	Hambro	It was no dream, the possibility existed. I had only to work and learn and survive in order to go to the top. Sure I’d study with [MASK], I’d learn what he had to teach and a lot more. Let tomorrow come.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Shucks	[MASK], you don’t know nothing. That ole white man right there might have him a coupla jackass balls!” The fat man raised up with a quick grin. “As a scientist and a physician I’m forced to discount that,” he said.
<name>the jury</name>	the jury	Brotherhood	You’ll lose your confidence. You won’t believe enough in your own correctness to lead others. You must therefore have confidence in those who lead you—in the collective wisdom of [MASK].” I left in a worse state than that in which I’d come.
<name>he</name>	he	Clifton	Why had I lost my head and spat upon the doll, I wondered. What had [MASK] felt when he saw me? He must have hated me behind his spiel, yet he’d ignored me. Yes, and been amused by my political stupidity.
<name>care</name>	care	Jimcrow	“He’s from the school.” “Well, who’s sick?” “He is.” “He too good to come in? Tell him we don’t [MASK] nobody.” “But he’s sick.” “He can die!”
<name>Taboo</name>	Taboo	Taboo	He must have been sitting there when I came in, for on a table that held a beautiful dwarf tree I saw smoke rising from a cigarette in a jade ash tray. An open book, something called Totem and [MASK], lay beside it.
<name>Ras</name>	Ras	Wrestrum	I left the room and went into a vacant office, boiling with anger and disgust. [MASK] had snatched me back to the South in the midst of one of the top Brotherhood committees and I felt naked. I could have throttled him—forcing me to take part in a childish dispute before the others.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Crenshaw	“Deep down you’re thinking about the freedom you’ve heard about up North, and you’ll try it once, just to see if what you’ve heard is true.” “There’s other kinds of freedom beside some ole white trash women,” [MASK] said.
<name>the party</name>	the party	Harlem	There had been, to my surprise, a switch in emphasis from local issues to those more national and international in scope, and it was felt that for the moment the interests of [MASK] were not of first importance.
<name>me</name>	me	Georgie	I said. “Don’t go, boo’ful,” she said. “Let [MASK] do it. No speeches tonight.” “Come on,” I said taking her arm quite firmly, pulling her along as she sighed, her wistful face turned toward me.
<name>Marcelo</name>	Marcelo	Jack	If even one-tenth of the people looked at the dolls as we do, our work would be a lot easier. The dolls are nothing.” “Nothing,” [MASK] said. “That nothing that might explode in our face.” I sighed.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Huckleberry	Truly, I don’t. But I do know this world you’re trying to contact—all its virtues and all its unspeakables— Ha, yes, unspeakables. I’m afraid my father considers me one of the unspeakables ... I'm [MASK], you see . . .”
<name>Desdemona</name>	Desdemona	Kate	It’s my blood, my face is bleedin’. That gits me to movin’ I gits up and stumbles out to find [MASK], and there she is under the cottonwood tree out there, on her knees, and she’s moanin’.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Maceo	All right, here it is, here’s my back,” he said, turning swiftly on the stool and around again, his arm set to throw the shaker. Customers were turning to look, were moving clear. “What’s the matter, [MASK]?”
