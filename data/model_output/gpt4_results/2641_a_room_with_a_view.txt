<name>Rachel</name>	Rachel	Lucy	“Greece”--and she saw that he was thinking the word over--“Greece; but you were to be married this year, I thought.” “Not till January, it wasn’t,” said [MASK], clasping her hands. Would she tell an actual lie when it came to the point?
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucy	To take you to it will be a real pleasure.” Now, this was abominably impertinent, and she ought to have been furious. But it is sometimes as difficult to lose one’s temper as it is difficult at other times to keep it. [MASK] could not get cross.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Conversation	In what way?” [MASK] had become agreeable to them, and they were pacing up and down the terrace. “I could as easily tell you what tune she’ll play next. There was simply the sense that she had found wings, and meant to use them.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Honeychurch,’”--Freddy	“Nonsense yourself! I’ve this minute seen him. He said to me: ‘Ahem! [MASK] was an indifferent mimic--“‘ahem! ahem! I have at last procured really dee-sire-rebel tenants.’ I said, ‘ooray, old boy!’
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Cecil	They were gone some time, and [MASK] was left with the dowagers. When they returned he was not as pleasant as he had been. “Do you go to much of this sort of thing?” he asked when they were driving home.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	George	[MASK] and I both know this, but why does it distress him? We know that we come from the winds, and that we shall return to them; that all life is perhaps a knot, a tangle, a blemish in the eternal smoothness.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Minnie	She hastened in to her mother, who was rapidly working herself into a Sunday fluster. “It’s a special collection--I forget what for. I do beg, no vulgar clinking in the plate with halfpennies; see that [MASK] has a nice bright sixpence.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	George	I have no time for the tenderness, and the comradeship, and the poetry, and the things that really matter, and for which you marry. I know that, with [MASK], you will find them, and that you love him. Then be his wife.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Lucy	But down here he acts the little god with his gentility, and his patronage, and his sham aesthetics, and everyone--even your mother--is taken in.” “All that you say is quite true,” said [MASK], though she felt discouraged.
<name>Maurice</name>	Maurice	George	[MASK] sat down where the ground was dry, and drearily unlaced his boots. “Aren’t those masses of willow-herb splendid? I love willow-herb in seed. What’s the name of this aromatic plant?” No one knew, or seemed to care.
<name>John</name>	John	Lucy	“Yes, I suppose we ought to be going,” was her reply. “[MASK], I want to ask something of you that I have never asked before.” At the serious note in his voice she stepped frankly and kindly towards him.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Freddy	“Don’t open the window; and you’d better draw the curtain, too; [MASK] or any one might be outside.” He obeyed. “I really think we had better go to bed, if you don’t mind.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Cecil	“Perhaps he had.” “No!” “Why ‘no’?” “He was such a nice old man, I’m sure.” [MASK] laughed at her feminine inconsequence. “Well, I did try to sift the thing.
<name>Wendy</name>	Wendy	Apollo	She frowns a little--not in anger, but as a brave child frowns when he is trying not to cry. In all that expanse no human eye is looking at her, and she may frown unrebuked and measure the spaces that yet survive between [MASK] and the western hills.
<name>It</name>	It	George	[MASK] still dark, all the tussle and the misery without a word from him. Am I justified?” Into his own eyes tears came. “Yes, for we fight for more than Love or Pleasure; there is Truth. Truth counts, Truth does count.”
<name>Timothy</name>	Timothy	Lucia	He left them, carefully closing the front door; and when they looked through the hall window, they saw him go up the drive and begin to climb the slopes of withered fern behind the house. Their tongues were loosed, and they burst into stealthy rejoicings. “Oh, [MASK]--come back here--
<name>She</name>	She	Lucy	Then she saw her brother’s face. Her lips parted, and she took him in her arms. He said, “Steady on!” “Not a kiss for me?” asked her mother. [MASK] kissed her also.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucy	That is the true democracy. Though I am a real Radical as well. There, now you’re shocked.” “Indeed, I’m not!” exclaimed [MASK]. “We are Radicals, too, out and out.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Charlotte	[MASK], with the complacency of fate, led her from the river to the Piazza Signoria. She could not have believed that stones, a Loggia, a fountain, a palace tower, would have such significance. For a moment she understood the nature of ghosts.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Cecil	“Not in that way. At times I could wring her neck. But not in that way. No. It is the same with [MASK] all over.” “By-the-by--I never told you.
<name>Wendy</name>	Wendy	Lucy	[MASK], from a cowardly wish to improve the situation, said: “Why need mother hear of it?” “But you tell her everything?” “I suppose I do generally.” “I dare not break your confidence. There is something sacred in it.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucy	“All the galleries are shut.” “I think I shall go out,” said [MASK]. “I want to go round the town in the circular tram--on the platform by the driver.” Her two companions looked grave.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Charlotte	[MASK], who was practical without ability, knelt by the side of an empty trunk, vainly endeavouring to pave it with books of varying thickness and size. She gave two or three sighs, for the stooping posture hurt her back, and, for all her diplomacy, she felt that she was growing old.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucy	“He told us another day that views are really crowds--crowds of trees and houses and hills--and are bound to resemble each other, like human crowds--and that the power they have over us is sometimes supernatural, for the same reason.” [MASK]’s lips parted.
<name>John</name>	John	George	And he thumped with his fists like a naughty child, and turned to his son, saying, “[MASK], persuade them!” “It’s so obvious they should have the rooms,” said the son. “There’s nothing else to say.”
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Lucy--	She could not understand him; the words were indeed remote. Yet as he spoke the darkness was withdrawn, veil after veil, and she saw to the bottom of her soul. “Then, [MASK]” “You’ve frightened me,” she moaned.
<name>Cecil</name>	Cecil	Cecil	shivered the tranquil air, and reminded her that she had told a lie and had never put it right. Such a senseless lie, too, yet it shattered her nerves and made her connect these Emersons, friends of [MASK]’s, with a pair of nondescript tourists.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Lucy	And [MASK]--she knew not why--wished that the trouble could have come at any other time. “Go and dress, dear; you’ll be late.” “All right, mother--” “Don’t say ‘All right’ and stop.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucy	It lay between the real and the pretended, and [MASK]’s first aim was to defeat herself. As her brain clouded over, as the memory of the views grew dim and the words of the book died away, she returned to her old shibboleth of nerves.
<name>Priscilla</name>	Priscilla	Lucy	” said [MASK], though in her heart she sympathized; “I think that a kind action done tactfully--” “Tact!” He threw up his head in disdain. Apparently she had given the wrong answer. She watched the singular creature pace up and down the chapel.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Cecil	“Does he not matter? That I love [MASK] and shall be his wife shortly? A detail of no importance, I suppose?” But he stretched his arms over the table towards her. “May I ask what you intend to gain by this exhibition?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucy	The rest of the pattern is the other people. Motives are all very well, but the fence comes here.” “We weren’t talking of real fences,” said [MASK], laughing. “Oh, I see, dear--poetry.”
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Lucy	“Let’s leave it all till mother comes back,” suggested [MASK]. “No, dear; your mother may take quite a long drive now that she is not hampered with me. We all have our little foibles, and mine is the prompt settling of accounts.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	George	I trust that you have realized about the ten days’ interval. It does not count that I helped you with the stair-eyes yesterday. It does not count that they are going to bathe this afternoon.” “Yes, go and bathe, [MASK].
<name>Rodin</name>	Rodin	Giotto	he said uneasily. “I saw nothing in it.” “I like [MASK],” she replied. “It is so wonderful what they say about his tactile values. Though I like things like the Della Robbia babies better.” “So you ought.
<name>George</name>	George	Cecil	That will be just the proper thing.” She had bowed--but to whom? To gods, to heroes, to the nonsense of school-girls! She had bowed across the rubbish that cumbers the world. So ran her thoughts, while her faculties were busy with [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Cecil	Only don’t--” She nearly said, “Don’t protect him.” But the bell was ringing for lunch, and, as often happened, [MASK] had paid no great attention to her remarks. Charm, not argument, was to be her forte.
<name>Love</name>	Love	Passion	He considered, with truth, that it had been a failure. [MASK] should believe itself irresistible. It should forget civility and consideration and all the other curses of a refined nature. Above all, it should never ask for leave where there is a right of way.
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Vyse	And before they had gone a dozen yards he jumped out, and came running back for [MASK]’s match-box, which had not been returned. As he took it, he said: “I’m so glad you only talked about books.
<name>Dexter</name>	Dexter	Cecil	“Good-bye, [MASK].” She watched him steal up-stairs, while the shadows from three banisters passed over her face like the beat of wings. On the landing he paused strong in his renunciation, and gave her a look of memorable beauty.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Lucy	“[MASK] used to be nearly as stupid as I am, but it’ll be very different now, mother thinks. She will read all kinds of books.” “So will you.” “Only medical books. Not books that you can talk about afterwards.
<name>George</name>	George	Freddy	“Next week, I gather.” “Did [MASK] say whether he was driving straight back?” “No, he didn’t.” “Because I do hope he won’t go gossiping.” So she did want to talk about her broken engagement.
<name>Millicent</name>	Millicent	Lucy	So [MASK] felt, or strove to feel. And yet--there was a rebellious spirit in her which wondered whether the acceptance might not have been less delicate and more beautiful. At all events, she entered her own room without any feeling of joy.
<name>Heyst</name>	Heyst	Cecil	“I think things are coming to a head,” she observed, rather wanting her son’s opinion on the situation if she could obtain it without undue supplication. “Time they did.” “I am glad that [MASK] is asking her this once more.”
<name>Who</name>	Who	George	“What DO you mean? No, never mind what you mean. Don’t explain. He looks forward to seeing you this afternoon. Do you play tennis? Do you mind tennis on Sunday--?” “[MASK] mind tennis on Sunday!
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Persephone	[MASK], who spends half her life in the grave--she could interpret it also. Not so these English. They gain knowledge slowly, and perhaps too late. The thoughts of a cab-driver, however just, seldom affect the lives of his employers.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Lucy	But unfortunately I have met the type before. They seldom keep their exploits to themselves.” “Exploits?” cried [MASK], wincing under the horrible plural. “My poor dear, did you suppose that this was his first? Come here and listen to me.
<name>Ecco</name>	Ecco	Eccolo	An Italian’s ignorance is sometimes more remarkable than his knowledge. She could not make him understand that perhaps they had missed the clergymen. The view was forming at last; she could discern the river, the golden plain, other hills. “[MASK]!”
<name>Antinous</name>	Antinous	Neptune	The great square was in shadow; the sunshine had come too late to strike it. [MASK] was already unsubstantial in the twilight, half god, half ghost, and his fountain plashed dreamily to the men and satyrs who idled together on its marge.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Charlotte	“I don’t want to make difficulties, but it really isn’t fair on the maids to fill up the house so.” Alas! “The truth is, dear, you don’t like [MASK].” “No, I don’t.
<name>He</name>	He	Cecil	No. How terrible if he did! But he has not told. He will not tell.” She longed to shout the words: “It is all right. It’s a secret between us two for ever. [MASK] will never hear.”
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Freddy	It might exist for [MASK], who still lived and thought straight, but not for one who had deliberately warped the brain. She did not acknowledge that her brain was warped, for the brain itself must assist in that acknowledgment, and she was disordering the very instruments of life.
<name>Valentin</name>	Valentin	Cecil	“Proteges!” she exclaimed with some warmth. For the only relationship which [MASK] conceived was feudal: that of protector and protected. He had no glimpse of the comradeship after which the girl’s soul yearned. “You shall see for yourself how your proteges are.
<name>Soames</name>	Soames	George	For a moment the original trouble was in the background. [MASK] would seem to have behaved like a cad throughout; perhaps that was the view which one would take eventually. At present she neither acquitted nor condemned him; she did not pass judgement.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	George	She had “forgiven” [MASK], as she put it, and she made a point of being pleasant to him. He jumped over the net and sat down at her feet asking: “You--and are you tired?” “Of course I’m not!”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Cecil	I shall only say things that will make me unhappy afterwards. As you say it is all too horrible, and it is no good talking.” But to [MASK], now that he was about to lose her, she seemed each moment more desirable.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Cecil	But [MASK], since his engagement, had taken to affect a cosmopolitan naughtiness which he was far from possessing. “Well,” said he, “I cannot help it if they do disapprove of me. There are certain irremovable barriers between myself and them, and I must accept them.”
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Lucy	There are details--it burnt. I read the book afterwards. She is not frozen, [MASK], she is not withered up all through. She tore us apart twice, but in the rectory that evening she was given one more chance to make us happy.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	George	[MASK] had turned at the sound of her arrival. For a moment he contemplated her, as one who had fallen out of heaven. He saw radiant joy in her face, he saw the flowers beat against her dress in blue waves. The bushes above them closed.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Cecil	He beamed at them knowingly, said, “Aha! young people, young people!” and then hastened to unlock the house. “Hopeless vulgarian!” exclaimed [MASK], almost before they were out of earshot.
<name>Maheu</name>	Maheu	Lucy	He alone had played skilfully, using the whole of his instinct, while the others had used scraps of their intelligence. He alone had divined what things were, and what he wished them to be. He alone had interpreted the message that [MASK] had received five days before from the lips of a dying man.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Lucy	She has never got over it. Of course, I didn’t mean that I played well; I only meant--” “Of course,” said he, wondering why she bothered to explain. “Music--” said [MASK], as if attempting some generality.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Lucy	He saw that the needful fire had been kindled in [MASK]. At last she longed for attention, as a woman should, and looked up to him because he was a man. “So you do love me, little thing?” he murmured.
<name>Smillie</name>	Smillie	Byron	“Are they that sort?” “I fancy they know how to read--a rare accomplishment. What have they got? [MASK]. Exactly. A Shropshire Lad. Never heard of it. The Way of All Flesh. Never heard of it.
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Lucy	He appealed to [MASK]; would not she intercede? He was poor--he sheltered a family--the tax on bread. He waited, he gibbered, he was recompensed, he was dissatisfied, he did not leave them until he had swept their minds clean of all thoughts whether pleasant or unpleasant.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucy	But it has frightened you, and you may not have noticed that I love you. Or would you have told me to go, and dealt with a tremendous thing so lightly? But therefore--therefore I settled to fight him.” [MASK] thought of a very good remark.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Lucy	[MASK] was frightened. “And she agreed that baptism was nothing, but he caught that fever when he was twelve and she turned round. She thought it a judgement.” He shuddered. “Oh, horrible, when we had given up that sort of thing and broken away from her parents.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Lucy	“Good. Now come up to the house.” They conferred in the dining-room for half an hour. [MASK] would never have carried the Greek scheme alone. It was expensive and dramatic--both qualities that her mother loathed.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	George	She was nervous at night. When she talked to [MASK]--they met again almost immediately at the Rectory--his voice moved her deeply, and she wished to remain near him. How dreadful if she really wished to remain near him!
<name>Rosalind</name>	Rosalind	George	I think he puts it well. Man has to pick up the use of his functions as he goes along--especially the function of Love.” Then he burst out excitedly; “That’s it; that’s what I mean. You love [MASK]!”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucy	Indeed, she had little more to learn. With a certain amount of insight she drew her young cousin affectionately to her. All the way back [MASK]’s body was shaken by deep sighs, which nothing could repress. “I want to be truthful,” she whispered.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Cecil	But I cannot see why you didn’t tell your friends about [MASK] and be done with it. There all the time we had to sit fencing, and almost telling lies, and be seen through, too, I dare say, which is most unpleasant.”
<name>Rodney</name>	Rodney	Honeychurch	I have met so few Liberal landowners, and I was anxious to compare his attitude towards the game laws with the Conservative attitude. Ah, this wind! You do well to bathe. Yours is a glorious country, [MASK]!” “Not a bit!”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	George	[MASK] replied: “It happened like this, if it happened at all. I would rather go up to heaven by myself than be pushed by cherubs; and if I got there I should like my friends to lean out of it, just as they do here.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucy	They had given up their attempt--if it was one--to conquer society, and now the father was almost as silent as the son. He wondered whether he would not plan a pleasant day for these folk before they left--some expedition, perhaps, with [MASK] well chaperoned to be nice to them.
<name>Bertolini</name>	Bertolini	Bertolini	Thus entrenched, she emitted a formal bow. It was the pension [MASK] again, the dining-table with the decanters of water and wine. It was the old, old battle of the room with the view.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucy	[MASK] rose from the seat. She moved across the lawn and smiled in at them, just as if she was going to ask them to play tennis. Then she saw her brother’s face. Her lips parted, and she took him in her arms.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Cecil	The too vast orb of her fate had crushed her; and she had seen too many seasons, too many cities, too many men, for her abilities, and even with [MASK] she was mechanical, and behaved as if he was not one son, but, so to speak, a filial crowd.
<name>Everard</name>	Everard	Vyse	“Have you ever talked to [MASK] without feeling tired?” “I can scarcely discuss--” “No, but have you ever? He is the sort who are all right so long as they keep to things--books, pictures--but kill when they come to people.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Lucy	[MASK] bit her lip, for the tone was sneering. On the subject of “church and so on” they had had rather an unsatisfactory conversation. He had said that people ought to overhaul themselves, and she did not want to overhaul herself; she did not know it was done.
<name>Eeyore</name>	Eeyore	Freddy	No, I’ll cross that last bit out--it looks patronizing. I’ll stop at ‘because she tells me everything.’ Or shall I cross that out, too?” “Cross it out, too,” said [MASK].
<name>Don</name>	Don	Cecil	“I have no profession,” said [MASK]. “It is another example of my decadence. My attitude--quite an indefensible one--is that so long as I am no trouble to any one I have a right to do as I like.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucy	The armour of falsehood is subtly wrought out of darkness, and hides a man not only from others, but from his own soul. In a few moments [MASK] was equipped for battle. “Something too awful has happened,” she began, as soon as her cousin arrived.
<name>Miss</name>	Miss	One	[MASK] cannot be too careful.” “Quite so.” “I do implore absolute secrecy. A chance word to a chattering friend, and--” “Exactly.” He was used to these nervous old maids and to the exaggerated importance that they attach to words.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucy	Despise the house that your father built and the garden that he planted, and our dear view--and then share a flat with another girl.” [MASK] screwed up her mouth and said: “Perhaps I spoke hastily.” “Oh, goodness!”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucy	“Oh, I thought they had been libelling me to you. But I suppose it is only their personal charms that makes you defend them.” “I’m not defending them,” said [MASK], losing her courage, and relapsing into the old chaotic methods.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Cecil	“No, not at all. [MASK] was very kind indeed; only--I had better tell you the whole truth, since you have heard a little--it was that he is so masterful. I found that he wouldn’t let me go my own way.
<name>Phidias</name>	Phidias	Phidias	Big enough in all conscience. The ceiling of the Sistine Chapel for me. There the contrast is just as much as I can realize. But not the Parthenon, not the frieze of [MASK] at any price; and here comes the victoria.”
<name>Olivia</name>	Olivia	Lucy	she exclaimed, “I have an idea. How would you like spinsters?” “My dear [MASK], it would be splendid. Do you know any such?” “Yes; I met them abroad.” “Gentlewomen?” he asked tentatively.
<name>Stuart</name>	Stuart	Hullo	“[MASK]!” he called, and leant out of the smoking-room window. He seemed in high spirits. “I was hoping you’d come. I heard you all bear-gardening, but there’s better fun up here.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Cecil	“Are there two ways?” “Perhaps the road is more sensible, as we’re got up smart.” “I’d rather go through the wood,” said [MASK], With that subdued irritation that she had noticed in him all the afternoon.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Lucy	She exclaimed: “How very odd of him!” “Why so?” asked the son and heir. “Why shouldn’t my permission be asked?” “What do you know about [MASK] or girls or anything? What ever did you say?”
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Cecil	[MASK], who had his full share of mediaeval mischievousness, replied that the physique of the lower middle classes was improving at a most appalling rate. She saw that he was laughing at their harmless neighbour, and roused herself to stop him.
<name>Freddy</name>	Freddy	Lucy	Oh, these Honeychurches! Eggs, boilers, hydrangeas, maids--of such were their lives compact. “May me and [MASK] get down from our chairs?” he asked, with scarcely veiled insolence. “We don’t want no dessert.”
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Powell	“I counted on you two keeping each other company. It’s pouring again. The entire congregation, which consists of your cousin, your mother, and my mother, stands waiting in the church, till the carriage fetches it. Did [MASK] go round?”
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Lucy	“Poor girl!” She smiled gravely. A certain scheme, from which hitherto he had shrunk, now appeared practical. “[MASK]!” “Yes, I suppose we ought to be going,” was her reply.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Lucy	“Haven’t I? The wood, then,” said [MASK], startled at his queerness, but pretty sure that he would explain later; it was not his habit to leave her in doubt as to his meaning.
<name>Helen</name>	Helen	Lucy	Three split infinitives.” “Dreadful!” said [MASK], and missed her stroke. When they had finished their set, he still went on reading; there was some murder scene, and really everyone must listen to it.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Freddy	“I vote tennis,” said [MASK], disgusted at the scrappy entertainment. “Yes, so do I.” Once more she closed the unfortunate piano. “I vote you have a men’s four.” “All right.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Charlotte	I warned you about her; I begged you, implored you not to, but of course it was not listened to.” “There you go.” “I beg your pardon?” “[MASK] again, my dear; that’s all; her very words.”
