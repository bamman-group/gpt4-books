<name>McKee</name>	McKee	Almasy	The rifle sight unwavering at the burned neck. Then the sapper swerves it up towards the man’s eyes. Do it, [MASK] says. The eyes of the sapper and the patient meet in this halfdark room crowded now with the world. He nods to the sapper.
<name>Tristram</name>	Tristram	Caravaggio	Otherwise they, walking casually down the street towards you, almost about to wave, would leap over a wall and be gone for months. As an uncle he had been a disappearer. [MASK] would disturb you by simply enfolding you in his arms, his wings.
<name>Saladin</name>	Saladin	Herodotus	But I never imagine [MASK] this way. I see him more as one of those spare men of the desert who travel from oasis to oasis, trading legends as if it is the exchange of seeds, consum- ing everything without suspicion, piecing together a mirage.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Madox	At the front. Here. What is it, does it have an official name? That hollow about the size of an impress of your thumb?’’ [MASK] watches me for a moment through the noon glare. “Pull yourself together,” he mutters.
<name>Case</name>	Case	Hana	Why is that? Because we want to know things, how the pieces fit. Talkers seduce, words direct us into corners. We want more than anything to grow and change. Brave new world. ’’ “I don’t think so,” said [MASK].
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Hana	He reached towards it but couldn’t even nudge it. Light was pouring into the river. He swam up to the surface, parts of which were on fire. When he told [MASK] the story later that evening she said, “They stopped torturing you because the Allies were coming.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Bagnold	She had once received from him a pewter thimble that held saffron. One of the ten thousand things. And if [MASK]—having seen me sitting by the saffron trader—brought up the incident during dinner at the table where she sat, how did I feel about that?
<name>he</name>	he	Singh	“Can you hear me?” he asked. “Yes, it’s fine. ” She rubbed the chalk off her hands onto her skirt and adjusted her glasses. She looked up into the distance and, as [MASK] had done, waved to those she could not see.
<name>Queen</name>	Queen	Clara	The woman my father loved lives out on the lakes, slips into canoes more easily than into a car. I miss thunder that blinks out electricity. I want you to meet [MASK] of the canoes, the last one in my family. There are no others now.
<name>Lawrence</name>	Lawrence	Odysseus	For them I was a bit too cunning to be a lover of the desert. More like [MASK]. Still, I was. Show me a desert, as you would show another man a river, or another man the metropolis of his childhood.
<name>Milton</name>	Milton	Adam	And in that desert she dragged her university days into our midst to describe the stars—the way [MASK] tenderly taught a woman with gracious metaphors. These then, though unbeheld in deep of night, Shine not in vain, nor think, though men were none,
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Almasy	In muted light his hair appeared dark, but now the wild hair lit up, bright, the bags under his eyes washed out in the pink late daylight. He had turned the chair around so he could lean forward on its back, facing [MASK].
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Hana	They declare war, they have honour, and they can’t leave. But you two. We three. We re free. How many sappers die? Why aren’t you dead yet? Be irresponsible. Luck runs out.” [MASK] was pouring milk into her cup.
<name>Tatiana</name>	Tatiana	Alice	He pulled off the locking ring and the locating ring and let them sink into the water. He could feel them roll slowly at his feet. It would all take another four minutes. “[MASK] is marrying one of the guard.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Kip	When he steps forward into the room he realizes everything is larger than life. His own head is no higher than the shoulder of the woman. The angel’s raised arm reaches fifteen feet in height. Still, for [MASK], they are company.
<name>Youssef</name>	Youssef	Almasy	When [MASK] speaks he stays alongside him reordering the events. Only desire makes the story errant, flickering like a compass needle. And this is the world of nomads in any case, an apocryphal story. A mind travelling east and west in the disguise of sandstorm.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Caravaggio	Afternoon sun fills the room, revealing the swimming motes. The Englishman’s dark lean face with its angular nose has the appearance of a still hawk swaddled in sheets. The coffin of a hawk, [MASK] thinks. The Englishman turns to him.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Hana	To [MASK] the wild gardens were like further rooms. She worked along the edges of them aware always of unexploded mines. In one soil-rich area beside the house she began to garden with a furious passion that could come only to someone who had grown up in a city.
<name>Septimus</name>	Septimus	Caravaggio	And she is being open, not quite realizing she is awake and conversing, as if still speaking in a dream, as if his sneeze had been the sneeze in a dream. [MASK] is familiar with this state. He has often met people at the moondial.
<name>Udet</name>	Udet	Esau	In 1941, [MASK] bombs with a new Y fuze had started coming in; this was his second one. It was decided during planning sessions that the only way around the new fuze was to immunize it. It was a huge bomb in ostrich posture.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Kip	The others froze. It could have been a mine. He turned back to the party and said, “It’s all right, it wasn’t a mine. That seemed to come from a cleared area. ” “Turn the record over, [MASK].
<name>Enrico</name>	Enrico	Hardy	People would revive the swing on a grandfather clock, and a glass bomb would blow out half a wall and whoever was nearby. He followed the noise of the piano, rushing up the hill with [MASK], climbed over the stone wall and entered the villa.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Caravaggio	“Not until I’ve taught you, dear worm. ” She looked up at [MASK] strangely; that was her father’s term of endearment for her. He pulled her into his thick grizzled embrace and said “dear worm” again, and began the dancing lesson.
<name>Almásy</name>	Almásy	Madox	I do not believe I entered a cursed land, or that I was ensnared in a situation that was evil. Every place and person was a gift to me. Finding the rock paintings in the Cave of Swimmers. Singing “burdens” with [MASK] during expeditions.
<name>Patience</name>	Patience	Pelmanism	In another box to the right were more shells, seven-millimetre shells this time. Then others. When he was a child he had grown up with an aunt, and on the grass of her lawn she had scattered a deck of cards face down and taught him the game of [MASK].
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Katharine	I'm going for help now, [MASK]. Do you un lerstand? There is an other plane nearby, but there is no petrol, or a jeep, which means I will be back soo. might meet a caravan tier. I don't know.
<name>Kim</name>	Kim	Kim	“Yes.” “Where is it?” “Give me the Kipling book . . . here. ” On the frontispiece of [MASK] was a map with a dotted line for the path the boy and the Holy One took.
<name>He</name>	He	Kip	The eyes of the sapper and the patient meet in this halfdark room crowded now with the world. He nods to the sapper. Do it, he says quietly. [MASK] ejects the cartridge and catches it as it begins to fall.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Hardy	If he cut down directly there was always a chance he would hit the percussion cap that flashed the gaine. It took five more minutes. [MASK] had not moved from the top of the pit, instead was giving him the approximate time left in the freezing.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Hana	me. “It is a strange time, the end of a war.” “Yes. A period of adjustment. ” “Yes.” He raises his hands up as if to cup the quarter-moon. “They removed both thumbs, [MASK].
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Hana	The shush shush replacing the whine and howl, the water flung onto his boots from the front wheel. Everything he saw through the goggles was grey. He would not think of [MASK]. In all the silence within the bike’s noise he did not think of her.
<name>she</name>	she	Kip	And I am beginning to like him. Desert your post. How can [MASK] love you if you are not smart enough to make him stop risking his life?” “Because. Because he believes in a civilised world. He's a civilised man.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Hana	[MASK] sits beside him, her dark brown hair already dry. These are the times he will talk about his family and his brother in jail. He will sit up and flip his hair forward, and begin to rub the length of it with a towel.
<name>Pierre</name>	Pierre	Pierre	He found another, similar title. [MASK], or the Ambiguities. He turned and caught the woman’s eyes on him again. He felt as guilty as if he had put the book in his pocket. She had probably never seen a turban before. The English!
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Caravaggio	“I haven’t seen a dog for years. All through the war I saw no dog.” She crouched and hugged the animal, smelling its hair and the odour of hill grasses within it. She steered the dog towards [MASK], who was offering it the heel of bread.
<name>He</name>	He	Exam	The lights would keep him warm, anyway. When he walked over to the bomb they were still alive in his mind. [MASK]. With the bright light, the porousness of the metal jumped into precise focus. Now he forgot everything except distrust.
<name>Croesus</name>	Croesus	Candaules	Then she began to read from The Histories—the story of [MASK] and his queen. I always skim past that story. It is early in the book and has little to do with the places and period I am interested in. But it is of course a famous story.
<name>Herodotus</name>	Herodotus	Herodotus	You fell into propinquity or distance. Just as, for him, the histories in [MASK] clarified all societies. He assumed he was experienced in the ways of the world he had essentially left years earlier, struggling ever since to explore a half-invented world of the desert.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Hardy	He would just have to remember each step. The sergeant who drove him was a man named [MASK], and he was to remain by the jeep. It was suggested he wait till the next morning, but he knew they would prefer him to do it now.
<name>Enrique</name>	Enrique	Kip	[MASK], talk to me. Now his face is a knife. The weeping from shock and horror contained, seeing everything, all those around him, in a different light. Night could fall between them, fog could fall, and the young man’s dark brown eyes would reach the new revealed enemy.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Hana	In the room there is the thin squawking from the crystal set, the radio still speaking in its underwater voice. He cannot bear to turn and look at the sapper or look towards the blur of [MASK]’s frock. He knows the young soldier is right.
<name>Ennis</name>	Ennis	David	“I still can’t listen to those stories, [MASK]. ” “Fathers die. You keep on loving them in any way you can. You can’t hide him away in your heart. ” “Talk to me when the morphia wears off.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Anna	He opens the window and steps out onto the verandah. A dark, beautiful night. Then he climbs off it and swings onto the verandah one level below. Only now can he enter the room of [MASK] and her general. Nothing more than a perfume in their midst.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Hana	They had even read that book together, [MASK]’s voice slow when wind flattened the candle flame beside her, the page dark for a moment. He squatted in a comer of the clanging waiting-room, rapt from all other thoughts; hands folded in lap, and pupils contracted to pin-points.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Madox	She met me when I had all those labels. Or she could twist a few degrees and see the labels on [MASK]. Yet apart from the Geographical Society we were unknown; we were the thin edge of a cult she had stumbled onto because of this marriage.
<name>Ulysses</name>	Ulysses	Kim	A drug of wonders.) She had turned from the ending of [MASK], with its delicate and holy sentences—and now clean diction—and picked up the patient’s notebook, the book he had somehow managed to carry with him out of the fire.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Hana	Then he would check it for fading power and know where the danger lay. [MASK] was carrying a long mirror in front of her down the hall. She would pause because of the weight of it and then move forward, the mirror reflecting the old dark pink of the passageway.
<name>Lucia</name>	Lucia	Caravaggio	What? Turn it— “I think he’s found a friend,” she said to [MASK]. She walks out into the sunlight and the courtyard. At noon the taps deliver water into the villa’s fountain and for twenty minutes it bursts forth.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Isaiah	No real damage has been done, I suppose.” “Did you see it? The face. Who was it? ‘‘Ah yes, it is a great face.” ‘‘You saw it.” “Yes. [MASK].”
<name>Timer</name>	Timer	Gaine	He breathed out, was still for a few seconds, and with the needle pliers cut the contact in two before he breathed in again. He gasped as the freeze burned part of his hand when he pulled it back out of the circuits. The bomb was dead. “Fuze out. [MASK] off.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Caravaggio	How does he give it to himself? he thinks. He recognizes the eye, the habit of the tongue fluttering at the lip, the clearness of the man’s brain catching all he says. Two old coots. [MASK] watches the pink in the man’s mouth as he talks.
<name>Kali</name>	Kali	Amritsar	For him there were the various maps of fate, and at [MASK]’s temple all faiths and classes were welcome and ate together. She herself would be allowed to place money or a flower onto the sheet spread upon the floor and then join in the great permanent singing.
<name>Vasily</name>	Vasily	Clifton	“Here, take the book and look through it.” I pulled it from my knapsack and handed it to her. After the meal and herb teas [MASK] brought out a bottle of cognac he had hidden from everyone till this moment.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Kip	She could feel those terrible paws on her back against the clean frock, and they moved in the limited space between the bed and the wall, between bed and door, between the bed and the window alcove that [MASK] sat within.
<name>Embers</name>	Embers	Libraries	[MASK] burn. What had our relationship been? A betrayal of those around us, or the desire of another life? She climbed back into her house beside her husband, and I retired to the zinc bars. I’ll be looking at the moon, but I'll be seeing you.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Caravaggio	[MASK] reflected in the black lake of his eye. He goes up and down now like a well bucket. There is blood somehow all over his face. He is flying a rotted plane, the canvas sheetings on the wings ripping open in the speed.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Hana	“Look at us—we sit here like the filthy rich in their filthy villas up in the filthy hills when the city gets too hot. It’s nine in the morning—the old guy upstairs is asleep. [MASK]’s obsessed with him.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Kip	That’s why we get on so well together.” In the kitchen [MASK] stabs two holes into the new can of condensed milk with his bayonet, which, he realizes, is now used more and more for only this purpose, and runs back upstairs to the bedroom.
<name>Amara</name>	Amara	Patrick	Unlike the sapper, her father was never fully comfortable in the world. His conversations lost some of their syllables out of shyness. In any of [MASK]’s sentences, her mother had complained, you lost two or three crucial words.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Kip	Not just in love but always sinking within it. Always confused. Always happy. [MASK]? Do you hear me? I’m so happy with you. To be with you like this.” Most of all she wished for a river they could swim in.
<name>Tristram</name>	Tristram	Tacitus	So [MASK] began his Annals. But novels commenced with hesitation or chaos. Readers were never fully in balance. A door a lock a weir opened and they rushed through, one hand holding a gunnel, the other a hat.
<name>He</name>	He	Caravaggio	To give up these words from an old song. She saw the places they went, where the gang never went, crowded with aspidistra. She looked up and nodded towards them, an acknowledgement that she would stop now. [MASK] did not see all this.
<name>Robinson</name>	Robinson	Herodotus	There is an other plane nearby, but there is no petrol, or a jeep, which means I will be back soo. might meet a caravan tier. I don't know. He pulled out the copy of [MASK] and placed it beside her.
<name>Hitler</name>	Hitler	Hana	They will bury everything except the book. The body, the sheets, his clothes, the rifle. Soon he will be alone with [MASK]. And the motive for all this on the radio. A terrible event emerging out of the shortwave. A new war.
<name>He</name>	He	Hana	By the way, I think this is called looting.” “My country taught me all this. It’s what I did for them during the war.” He went through the bombed chapel into the house. [MASK] sat up, slightly dizzy, off balance.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Singh	Either from this window or from that back door . . . shot right down the aisle—into her shoulder. Splendid shot, actually, though of course reprehensible. The villain was chased onto the moors and had his muscles ripped from his body.” To [MASK] it sounded like a familiar Indian fable.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Uncle	He slams his back against the wall and stops his shaking. Plaster dust in the air around them. I sat at the foot of this bed and listened to you, [MASK]. These last months. When I was a kid I did that, the same thing.
<name>He</name>	He	Caravaggio	So relaxed, as if she had put her arms away for the night, now in simple armless movement. [MASK] was diverted by the startling presence of three bottles of red wine on the table. He walked over and read the labels and shook his head, amazed.
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Almasy	His hair dark again. He leaned back, his shoulder against the foliage. “I suppose it doesn’t matter,” [MASK] murmured. “Do you want morphine?” “No. I’m putting things into place. I was always a private man.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Caravaggio	She sees the buzzard hawks flung up into the sky, looks for [MASK]. He is halfway across when he smells the rain, and then it begins to fall all over his body, clinging to him, and suddenly there is the greater weight of his clothes.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Madox	He came to the desert, [MASK] said. July 1936. There are betrayals in war that are childlike compared with our human betrayals during peace. The new lover enters the habits of the other. Things are smashed, revealed in new light.
<name>John</name>	John	Kip	She stood up, pulled her tennis shoes off and climbed onto the table. There were four snail lights flickering, almost dying, on the table beside her bare feet. “This is for you. This is how you must learn to sing it, [MASK].
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Patrick	Safe as a dove-cot. A sacred place. Like a church in many ways. A comforting place. [MASK] died in a comforting place. At five a.m. he kicked the Triumph to life, and the rear wheel threw gravel in a skirt.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Buddy	He always said "Hi, [MASK]" to me. She swabbed arms that kept bleeding. She removed so many pieces of shrapnel she felt she’d transported a ton of metal out of the huge body of the human that she was caring for while the army travelled north.
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Hana	He enters the house only when invited in, just a tentative visitor, the way he had done that first night when he had followed the faltering sound of [MASK]’s piano and come up the cypress-lined path and stepped into the library.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Caravaggio	I’ll leave you the radio to swallow your history lesson. Don't move again, [MASK]. All those speeches of civilisation from kings and queens and presidents . . . such voices of abstract order. Smell it. Listen to the radio and smell the celebration in it.
<name>Tristan</name>	Tristan	Caravaggio	She sat in the room with her eternally dying man, the small of her back still feeling bruised from an accidental slam against the wall during her dance with [MASK]. Now if he moves towards her she will stare him out, will treat him to a similar silence.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Madox	[MASK] gone. The woman translated into leaves and twigs, the broken glass to the sky like a jaw above him. He slips into the harness of the oil-wet parachute and pivots upside down, breaking free of glass, wind flinging his body back.
<name>Flaubert</name>	Flaubert	Clifton	The vanity of a man to the point where he wishes to be envied. Or he wishes to be believed, for he thinks he is not believed. This was in no way a portrait of [MASK], but he became a part of this story.
<name>He</name>	He	Clifton	Our situation. [MASK] celebrated the beauty of her arms, the thin lines of her ankles. He described witnessing her swim. He spoke about the new bidets in the hotel suite. Her ravenous hunger at breakfast. To all that, I didn’t say a word.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Caravaggio	Earlier, when she saw that he had left the window alcove, she had been enraged. Knowing that he was protecting them like children from the mine. She had clung closer to [MASK]. It had been an insult.
<name>British</name>	British	Sikhs	There were two guns, made up of metal cups and bowls taken from every Hindu household in the city—as jizya, or tax. These were melted down and made into the guns. They were used in many battles in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries against [MASK].
<name>Saladin</name>	Saladin	Madox	Was I a curse upon them? For her? For [MASK]? For the desert raped by war, shelled as if it were just sand? The Barbarians versus the Barbarians. Both armies would come through the desert with no sense of what it was.
<name>Yevgeny</name>	Yevgeny	Caravaggio	It was only necessary not to raise objections or be envious, not to quarrel or take offence, which in accordance with his natural kindliness he never did. I have come to love the tap of your fingernail on the syringe, [MASK].
<name>Heidegger</name>	Heidegger	Bermann	[MASK] blew theory into the embers. And I? I was the skill among them. The mechanic. The others wrote out their love of solitude and meditated on what they found there. They were never sure of what I thought of it all.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Caravaggio	His onions and his herbs— which [MASK] suspected he was taking from the Franciscans’ garden during the time he spent there sweeping the place for mines. He peeled the onions with the same knife he used to strip rubber from a fuze wire. This was followed by fruit.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Caravaggio	There, wrapped in damp cloth, was some dried meat, which [MASK] cut and put into his pocket. “I can get you off the morphine, you know. I’m a good nurse.” “You’re surrounded by madmen. ...”
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Kip	‘‘How is he?” “Asleep. Talked himself out. " “Is he what you thought he was?” “He’s fine. We can let him be. ” “I thought so. [MASK] and I are both sure he is English.
<name>him</name>	him	Caravaggio	He wakes and sees her in the spray of the lamp. He loves most her face’s smart look. Or in the evenings he loves her voice as she argues [MASK] out of a foolishness. And the way she crawls in against his body like a saint.
<name>Almásy</name>	Almásy	Clifton	None of us thought we would see it again. It was another victim of the desert. Within a few months we would pass the northeast gully and see no contour of it. By now [MASK]’s plane, ten years younger, had flown into our story.
<name>Jean</name>	Jean	Bagnold	We knew each other’s intimacies, each other’s skills and weaknesses. We forgave [MASK] everything for the way he wrote about dunes. "The grooves and the corrugated sand resemble the hollow of the roof of a dog’s mouth. ”
<name>Querry</name>	Querry	Kip	That seemed to come from a cleared area”—prepared to wait till the smell of the cordite reached him. Now, hours later, [MASK] sits once again in the window alcove. If he could walk the seven yards across the Englishman’s room and touch her he would be sane.
<name>Briony</name>	Briony	Caravaggio	The sapper sings his Western songs, which [MASK] enjoys but pretends not to. “Pennsylvania six-five-oh-oh-oh,” the young soldier gasps. She learns all the varieties of his darkness. The colour of his forearm against the colour of his neck.
<name>Actaeon</name>	Actaeon	Gyges	Now there is a seat near the entrance of the room and on this she lays her garments as she takes them off one by one; and so you will be able to gaze at her at full leisure. ” But [MASK] is witnessed by the queen when he leaves the bedchamber.
<name>Hal</name>	Hal	Hardy	Will let it bubble for thirty seconds. Then start. Freshen the frost. Okay, I’m going to remove the dam. . . . Okay, dam gone.” [MASK] was listening to everything and recording it in case something went wrong.
<name>Herodotus</name>	Herodotus	Herodotus	We knew power and great finance were temporary things. We all slept with [MASK]. "For those cities that were great in earlier times must have now become small, and those that were great in my time were small in the time before. . . .
<name>Trurl</name>	Trurl	Bauchan	He even wanted a tribe to take his name, and spent a year on the negotiations. Then [MASK] outdid him, having a type of sand dune named after him. But I wanted to erase my name and the place I had come from.
<name>Lucia</name>	Lucia	Hana	He passes the scarecrow for [MASK]’s garden, the crucifix with its hanging sardine cans, and moves uphill towards the villa. He cups the hand held in front of him with the other as if protecting the flame of a candle.
<name>Velázquez</name>	Velázquez	Mary	The palm of his left hand facedown on the concrete. The colour of his turban echoes that of the lace collar at the neck of [MASK]. At her feet the small Indian sapper, in uniform, beside the six slippers. There seems to be no time here.
<name>He</name>	He	Kip	Stays like that and then slowly gets up and moves in a diagonal towards his tent, enters it, and closes the flaps behind him. There is the dry crackle of thunder and she sees her arms darken. [MASK] emerges from the tent with the rifle.
