<name>He</name>	He	Szara	[MASK] expected to recognize the occupant of Seat 47 or 45, but the place to his right was more than filled by a bulky matron in diamond rings while to his left, on the aisle, sat a dark, teenage girl in a print dress.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Seneschal	“What a bumping!” “Look,” the driver said in French, holding his cigar between thumb and forefinger, “don’t make us chase you around all night...” Traffic started to move and [MASK] forced his way between two cars.
<name>John</name>	John	Szara	It stood high above the road, at the edge of a shimmering white meadow that sloped gently toward the edge of an evergreen forest. The ground-floor shutters were closed; behind them was a faint glow, perhaps a single lamp in what [MASK] presumed to be a reception area in the lobby.
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Elizabeth	In the long run it’s just dialogue, open forum, everyone gets to take their turn at bat.” “But is this person actually in a position to know something like that? ” [MASK] was slightly wide-eyed at the possibility.
<name>Max</name>	Max	Baumann	He raced up, [MASK] behind him, and tried the door. On the other side of the curtain he could hear chairs being kicked around and the other windows being broken to a chorus of laughter and cheers. “Jews come out!” roared a drunken voice.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Szara	He carefully placed his straw hat on the marquetry table in the library, folded his hands, and looked expectantly at [MASK]. When told the operation was over, he covered his face with his hands, as though in great fatigue. They sat for some time without speaking.
<name>Protagonist</name>	Protagonist	Goldman	[MASK] will discuss with you the approach to otter and to raven, and you’ll work with him on questionnaires—we want you to guide otter into very particular and specific areas. Questions? ” “One.” “Only one?”
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Szara	She nodded, took them from him, stood, and stuffed the pockets of a long wool coat hanging on a peg. [MASK] now assumed their conversation to be perfectly audible to the “captain” next door. “You’ll take care of your, ah, health.
<name>Lenin</name>	Lenin	Lenin	The country had been freed of Russian rule in 1918—of [MASK]’s dictum “Two steps forward and one step back,” this had been a step back—and had gotten rather to enjoy being a free nation. But its days were numbered and nothing could be done about it.
<name>Victoria</name>	Victoria	Szara	[MASK] raised an eyebrow. “Come upstairs,” she said. He followed her through rooms of oiled walnut furniture and towering emerald draperies, then up a curving marble staircase with gilded banisters. “Well you’ve certainly—” “Shut up,” she whispered urgently.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Szara	Unlike a cavalry officer, however, his uniform jacket was hung over the back of his chair, his collar was unbuttoned and tie pulled down, and his sleeves were folded back. When [MASK] entered his office he was smoking a cigar, and a large metal ashtray held the stubs of many others.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Szara	“It must be avoided,” [MASK] agreed. “At all cost. You’d think we would have come to understand, in 1914, the price of ignorance.” “Sorrowfully, the world doesn’t learn.” “No, you’re right.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Vyborg	[MASK] swore. He was picking broken cigars out of his breast pocket. On the road a woman had gone mad; people were running after her into a field, yelling for her to stop. At dusk the column of refugees thinned, then stopped altogether.
<name>Quin</name>	Quin	Bloch	They had, somehow, in this strange, hidden, broken building, caught the tail of absurdity, and the thrash of it made them laugh. “God forgive me,” [MASK] said, wiping his eyes with his hand, “for enjoying such a life as much as I do.”
<name>John</name>	John	Szara	[MASK] checked his watch, gave her five minutes to get wherever she was going, then threw a bill on the table and departed. Out in the lobby, he hurried onto an elevator just before the door closed and asked to be let off at the fourth floor.
<name>Yevgeny</name>	Yevgeny	Szara	[MASK] wanted to laugh, had the services been panicked into kindness} “My work is difficult, comrade General, but less difficult than that of many others, and I am content to be what I am.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Phooey	“[MASK].” She wrinkled her nose at the glass. “Your pretty little niece, who is no doubt dying to be an actress—tell her it all rests on a tolerance for atrocious white wine.”
<name>Priscilla</name>	Priscilla	Goldman	She was, as promised, fortyish, sexy, rich, foul-mouthed, promiscuous, and, in general, thoroughly accessible; an indefatigable guest and hostess who knew “everybody.” “You will meet her certainly,” said [MASK] primly, “but she has entirely the wrong friends.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Vyborg	Slowly, he got himself turned over and began to crawl for the edge of the woods. The field telephone came suddenly to life, static popping from the earpiece. [MASK] grabbed it and said, “This is your observer position.”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Szara	A man in his late sixties, [MASK] thought. Fleshless, ascetic face below a bald head, deep care lines, mouth a single brief line. Yet the look in his eyes told a slightly different story. At some point, in a life that left his face like stone, something had amused him.
<name>Andrzej</name>	Andrzej	Vyborg	[MASK] took a wallet from his jacket and offered the man a sheaf of zloty notes. The man looked stubbornly at his feet, but the woman stepped forward and accepted the money silently. “What will become of us now?” the man asked.
<name>He</name>	He	Szara	He was a small, serious man, determined, and not inclined toward conversation. He handed over an envelope; [MASK] could feel the waxy paper of the folded flimsy inside. A radio was playing in the press office and when the news forecast came on at noon, all talk stopped.
<name>Whitworth</name>	Whitworth	Olensko	“Well then, shall we . . .” “Pack up our cipher machines and go? Yes, I suppose. I’ve asked [MASK] to organize it. Tell him to begin, will you?” “With you commanding?”
<name>Ron</name>	Ron	Vyborg	They’d had nothing to eat or drink since afternoon of the previous day, and thirst was becoming something it was hard not to think about. [MASK] lit a match and tried to study the map, not at all sure where they were.
<name>John</name>	John	Szara	The building, cold stone to the eye, was alive, full of inquisitive neighbors you couldn’t avoid on the stairs. [MASK] squared his shoulders and scowled—I am a policeman— and left the old lady to deal with the inevitable tongue-wagging.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Szara	[MASK] could imagine them, seated at a table covered with a green baize cloth, flimsies of decrypted signals arranged at every place, smoking nervously at their stubby Troika cigarettes, speaking so very carefully, conscious of nuance in themselves and others, groping toward a protective consensus.
<name>Heinrich</name>	Heinrich	Szara	They were the image of diplomacy, strolling pensively with hands clasped behind their backs, continuing a very deliberate conversation, choosing their words with great care. [MASK] studied their lips through the opera glasses but could not, to his surprise, determine if they were speaking German or Russian.
<name>Leamas</name>	Leamas	Somebody	The operatives had gotten him safely inside. [MASK], shivering in the Berlin mist at dawn, had dug a piece out of the wall with a clasp knife—or however it had been done, by twelve-year-olds for all he knew—anyhow, he was in.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Szara	His fellow traveler was a dark, angry man clutching a wicker hamper in both arms and, using his shoulder, he attempted to push [MASK] off the train—the step belonged to him, it was his place in the scheme of things.
<name>Leamas</name>	Leamas	Goldman	Back in his room at the Adlon he closed the heavy drapes to shut out the dusk, locked the door, and lost himself in ciphering. Using the German railway timetable [MASK] had handed him—a very unremarkable find if he were searched—he converted his plaintext into numerical groups.
<name>Callahan</name>	Callahan	Abramov	There was too much there. Drawn deep inside himself, impervious to the screaming gulls, to the gust of wind that toyed with his beard, [MASK] wore the expression of a man whose brutal opinion of humankind has, once again, been confirmed.
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Poziny	There were several very long seconds of silence; only [MASK]’s graceful inclination of the head summoned applause that resolved the tension in the room. Everyone there knew what the poem meant, in the early days of the revolution and in March of 1938. Or thought they knew.
<name>Leopold</name>	Leopold	Tscherov	“Pfft,” she said, casting her eyes up at the ceiling and springing four fingers from beneath her thumb, flicking [MASK]’s soul up to heaven. “November 1917.” “Difficult times,” he said in sympathy.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Seneschal	“Humans aren’t made of steel, and that includes communists.” [MASK] watched eight new horses being led out into the rain. “Shall we give you a little breathing space? Perhaps a notional journey, something to do with the Foreign Office.
<name>Vronsky</name>	Vronsky	Vyborg	An innocuous detail, but this was not the sort of officer who would be casual about such things. He knew that if [MASK] determined his honor lay in the single shot fired in a forest there was nothing he could say or do to stop it.
<name>Quiller</name>	Quiller	Szara	“This, this, you don’t see every day.” He sat down and flattened the passport out on the table and began removing its photograph by rubbing on chemical solvent with a piece of sponge. When he was done he handed the damp picture to [MASK].
<name>Emerson</name>	Emerson	Goldman	But that was fate. So, instead, he put a bit of his soul into the telegraphy, flying ghostlike across the sleeping continent along with his secret numbers. [MASK] had said, “Be a journalist!”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Szara	He did what had to be done. The linguistics professor was a short, angry man with a few brilliantined hairs pasted over a pink scalp. [MASK] understood him very well—combative, cocksure, vain, bathed in the arrogance of his theories.
<name>Rearden</name>	Rearden	Szara	[MASK] nodded sorrowfully; he understood. “And work?” he asked. “The business? What’s it like there? How do they feel about you, your employees. Still faithful? Or do most of them follow the party line?”
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Szara	“I don’t suppose you actually have much feeling for her.” “It’s curieux, if you want the truth. The fat little Nazi maiden squirming away . . . one closes one’s eyes with passion.” [MASK] smiled.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Baumann	This shattered unbreakable rules of every variety and set the man’s face dancing with bureaucratic horror. He did the best he could under the circumstances: secreted [MASK] in the trunk, first prying back a section of the metal jamb to make an air passage.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	One	[MASK] was young and alert and very efficient. He had a ledger open in front of him and copied out the information from documents and passports. The other seemed rather more an observer, in attendance only in case of some special circumstance beyond the expertise of his partner.
<name>Jimmy</name>	Jimmy	Vainshtok	It was a blued-steel Steyr automatic, an Austrian weapon, compact and heavy in his hand. “You get to play with it for three minutes,” [MASK] said. “But you have to give me five marbles and a piece of candy.”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Vainshtok	“Hello, [MASK],” he said. “So pleased you have chosen to honor us. I have to file on everything, up half the night. Now you’re here maybe I get a break now and then.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Nachman	The door of the shop had disappeared and the interior, a dressmaker’s workroom, had been swirled by a typhoon, bits and pieces of material were everywhere. “Who’s there?” said the voice. “[MASK],” said the carpenter.
<name>Lotte</name>	Lotte	Vainshtok	I thought you needed all the excitement you could get.” “Do you know anything about the Reich Foreign Office?” [MASK] sighed. Went over to an open briefcase, dug around inside for a time, and emerged with a thin, mimeographed telephone directory.
<name>Amélie</name>	Amélie	Szara	Like so many French men, he seemed theatrically suited to his role in life—the spiky hair, acerbic smile, pigskin gloves, and upturned raincoat collar would have quite pleased a film director. [MASK] was drawn to him.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Seneschal	He watched the waver- ing signs in the water, red and blue, recalled what [MASK] had said about his girlfriend, the one who threw nothing away, the one for whom anything could be made to last a little longer. 8 July.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Szara	In fact, [MASK] realized he didn’t have much of a choice: the file was “his,” but not his to dispose of. Sooner or later, they would want to know what had become of it.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Szara	The service revolver dated from prerevolutionary days, a Na-gant, the double-action officer’s model, 7.62mm from a design of 1895. It was well oiled and fully loaded. From certain characteristics, [MASK] determined that the sidearm had had a long and very active life.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Szara	One of the sentries unslung his rifle and walked over to ask him who he was and what he was doing there. [MASK] was about to reach for the badge, then didn’t. Something told him to leave it where it was. Just a Pole, he said.
<name>René</name>	René	Szara	He applied a blotter to the signature, then looked at it critically and blew on the ink to make sure it was dry. He handed the passport to [MASK]. “Now you’re a French citizen, if you aren’t already.”
<name>Desrochers</name>	Desrochers	Szara	[MASK] sensed discomfort. The interrogator took refuge in the notes he’d made to himself to guide him in the interview, but they were all wrong now. His Frenchman, trapped on the wrong side of the lines, had disappeared.
<name>Ulysses</name>	Ulysses	Flaubert	He’d come across the phrase in [MASK] and it had stayed with him; it was all in those four words, the narrow cabin with a light bulb swaying on a cord, the seaweed reek of harbors, slanting rains, a column of black smoke from a funnel on the horizon.
<name>He</name>	He	Szara	I’m writing a story about the workers who built the Gare du Nord. I don’t know where the time goes, I have to finish the piece by noon on the fourth of May. It fooled nobody. Even if the voice did not yet speak, [MASK] feared discovery.
<name>Alvin</name>	Alvin	Szara	“A pretty morning we have,” said the boy. “Would you care to ride a way?” The wagon didn’t actually stop, but [MASK] hauled himself up and perched on the wooden rim next to the driver. The horse slowed perceptibly.
<name>Chigurh</name>	Chigurh	Heshel	The other man didn’t answer. “Maybe you better start the machine.” While [MASK] retrieved the key and unlocked the handcuffs, the other man took a crank that clamped behind the rider’s seat and locked it onto a nut on the side of the engine.
<name>Leopold</name>	Leopold	Khelidze	[MASK] was drunk. He polished his glasses with a handkerchief, his eyes watery and vague. Yes well, he said, one sometimes imagined. For himself, well it was all a matter of taste in this life wasn’t it.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Baumann	Both of them sat still as the sound grew louder, then [MASK] stood suddenly. “They must not see us.” The beginning of panic was in his voice. “Would we be better off out in the street?” “They’re coming here.
<name>Wilkins</name>	Wilkins	Khelidze	[MASK] wasn’t much to look at, a fattish man in his forties with pale hair worn well brushed and pomaded. His hands were small and chubby, endlessly fussing with a pair of silver-rimmed spectacles of which he was very proud.
<name>Lenin</name>	Lenin	Lenin	“I know it’s difficult to understand, but it’s like not having money. [MASK] said that grain was ‘the currency of currencies.’ That was in 1917. For us, it might now be said that information is the currency of currencies.”
<name>Alvin</name>	Alvin	Vyborg	A voice could be heard yelling on the other end. Then [MASK] said, “I don’t know where he is. But he repaired the line and until he returns I will direct your fire. Is there an officer there?”
<name>Jamie</name>	Jamie	Szara	It was foul water, bad-smelling and stale, and [MASK] could taste dirt and rotting wood and God knew what else, but he lapped at it avidly, drinking from cupped hands, not caring that the stream soaked his shirt and trousers.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Vyborg	[MASK] shook his head that he didn’t know and lit another match. “Our little wagon track is not on the map,” he said. “But I’ve estimated we’ll hit the north-south rail line at a switching station somewhere north and east of here.”
<name>Arctor</name>	Arctor	Seneschal	“Any idea where we are?” he said. “The thirteenth.” A shabby neighborhood, unlit; peeling wooden shutters protected the shopfronts. Up ahead, a broad boulevard appeared and [MASK] pulled over and left the car idling as they both lit cigarettes.
<name>Véra</name>	Véra	Szara	The cartography had certainly begun earlier (honorary Bolshevik names were missing), but the printing date allowed [MASK] to write on a piece of hotel stationery “alive in 1919.” Checking the baggage tag once again, he noted “tentative terminal date, 8 February 1935.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Heshel	He turned it hard a few times and the motorcycle coughed, then sputtered to life. [MASK] made a hurry-up motion with his hand, the man climbed on the motorcycle and rode away. As the noise faded, they could hear dogs barking.
<name>Assange</name>	Assange	Molotov	Why do you think anything will happen? [MASK] will say ‘more imperialist lies’ and the world will yawn, all except for one journalist, floating face down in a swamp somewhere so that nobody can see what a noble and superior smile he wore when he died.”
<name>Zelda</name>	Zelda	Szara	“In an hour or so they serve boiled beets. Then, at dinnertime, they serve them again. On the other hand, the china is extremely beautiful, and they’re actually very good beets.” [MASK] slept on a wicker couch on the sunporch.
<name>Quinn</name>	Quinn	Fitzware	“Can you be specific?” [MASK] said at last. “Certificates of Emigration.” “Real ones?” “Yes.” “Above the legal limit, of course.” “Of course.” “And in return?”
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Szara	Horses galloped past them, there were shots and screams and pointless shouted commands, but this man, in cap and overcoat, never stopped smiling. [MASK] crawled on all fours, a horse leapt over him and its rider cursed, but he could gain no ground.
<name>Carlsen</name>	Carlsen	Mierczek	The lieutenant was called [MASK]. Tall and fair and serious, he was somebody’s good son, an altar boy no doubt, and now a soldier. A little overawed at first by the presence of a colonel and a war correspondent, he’d made them as comfortable as he could.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Maltsaev	It took at least two minutes to drag [MASK] down the hall and into the unlocked room, and the trip left a long maroon streak on the tile. The lock on the door was simple enough, it worked on a lever.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Szara	From horseback, [MASK] had ridden down one man, slashed at another with his saber. In the next instant he and his horse were down in the dust, the horse whinnying in pain and terror, its legs thrashing.
<name>Gleb</name>	Gleb	Szara	Something told him to leave it where it was. Just a Pole, he said. His wife had gone into labor and he was off to fetch the midwife. The soldier stared. [MASK] could hear voices inside the cattle cars, speaking Polish, pleading for water.
<name>Stoner</name>	Stoner	Szara	The job he set himself was like adding columns of figures—but it was this very exercise in brainless transposition that raised the answer above the horizon. [MASK] was accustomed to writer’s thinking: the flash of insight or the revealing perspective produced by the persistent mind.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Szara	The car entered a farming village, every window dark, thatched-roof stone barns, then they were again among the fields. [MASK]’s heart pumped hard; he willed his hand not to rise and press against his chest. “What?” he said.
<name>decadent</name>	decadent	Russian	A moment later her hand snaked around the door with a lit cigarette. He took it gratefully. “Smoking in the bath,” she said. “You are truly [MASK].” The borzoi came padding in and lapped enthusiastically at the bathwater.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Szara	A dirt track for farm machines broke away from the road into a field that had been harvested to low stubble. “Ah,” the fat man said. “You better back up.” He looked over the seat at [MASK] as the car reversed.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Mierczek	It seems they’ve cut passages into the woods for the tanks to move around.” “I think you’re right, sir,” [MASK] said. In the midst of communicating this information his face tensed, but he carried his report through to the end.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Dolek	Left alone in the apartment, he copied out, as best he could and with immense effort, the papers the major brought home and left in a desk drawer. He made no distinctions—thus the letter from the sister—if the major treated the paper as private, [MASK] copied it.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Finis	“I looked at her breasts.” “[MASK]?” “Let me tell you, from one who has lived a, a rich and varied cosmopolitan life, there was never again a moment like it.”
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Goldman	He was the new boy in the office, he had to make a decent impression, but he’d known [MASK]’s type before: a genius all right, a genius for self-advancement. “I suppose you’re right,” he said amiably.
<name>Rincewind</name>	Rincewind	Szara	“May I ask where we’re going?” [MASK] opened the envelopes, put his belt on and laced up his shoes. “You certainly may,” said the gnome, peering through the rain, “but it wouldn’t mean anything even if I told you.”
<name>Leamas</name>	Leamas	Abramov	They came around the corner at the back of the hotel and stopped. [MASK], in a dark suit and homburg hat, was trying to run across the snow-covered meadow. It was absurd, almost comic.
<name>Thames</name>	Thames	Havel	He lay amid soaked sheets; saw, when he closed his eyes, the splashing in the moonlit river [MASK] and heard, again and again, the scream for mercy. It was not delirium, it was a sickened memory that refused to heal.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Szara	When the engine was turned off a deep silence descended, broken only by the low, three-note song of a single bird. The forest reminded [MASK] of a cathedral; they sat beneath tall oak trees that filtered and darkened the light until it was like the cool shadow of a church.
<name>Rostov</name>	Rostov	Szara	A few log houses scattered on both sides of a dirt street, a man with shaven head and cavalry mustache, sleeves rolled up on the hot day, thumbs hooked in suspenders as he lounged in the doorway of what [MASK] took to be the Podalki store.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Stollenbauer	[MASK] will be crawling at her feet. And as for you, your only problem will be a woman in triumph, a star of stage, screen, and radio, a princess. Demanding, I think, but not something you can’t deal with.”
<name>Mr. Salamano</name>	Mr. Salamano	Szara	[MASK] seemed to be one of his favorites. “I am so sorry,” he’d say, very real regret in his voice. “No cancellations today. But you will try tomorrow, I hope. One can’t ever tell.
<name>Thurston</name>	Thurston	Baumann	[MASK] nodded his assent, a stiff little bow: a man of dignity and culture had made a decision, taken honor into account, determined that greater considerations prevailed. They went back to the office and chatted for a time.
<name>Murrow</name>	Murrow	Hitler	He was a brilliant orator to begin with, and somehow the dynamics of wireless transmission—static, the light hiss of silence—added power to his voice. [MASK] teased his audience, tiptoeing up to a dramatic point, then hammering it home.
<name>She</name>	She	Szara	They both helped her to sit upright. [MASK] could see no blood. The woman looked curiously at her hand, then wiggled the fingers. “Are you hurt?” the carpenter said. “No,” said the woman, her voice faint and giddy with astonishment.
<name>James</name>	James	Szara	So they sat there and presently heard a second knock, perhaps a bit more insistent than the first. [MASK], not knowing what else to do, walked down the stairs and answered it. To find two Frenchmen waiting politely at the door.
<name>it was</name>	it was	Szara	It rained hard that night, for [MASK] a blessing. It reminded him that there was a world outside his cell, and the steady splash on the high, grilled window muted, if it could not quite obliterate, the sounds of a Gestapo prison.
<name>Andrei</name>	Andrei	Goldman	This was pain he meant to keep. To maintain his cover, he had to write something. “Nothing political,” [MASK] had warned. “Let Tass file on diplomatic developments; you find yourself something meaningless, filler.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Szara	[MASK] joined in, was then unable to stop. People at other tables turned to look at them, smiling nervously, a little frightened to be trapped in a tiny Polish restaurant with a pair of madmen. Neither of them could have explained it.
<name>Grigory</name>	Grigory	Szara	Let [MASK] do the work, he says. Make him truly nasch, our very own. He’s been a journalist who does his patriotic duty and, from time to time, undertakes special work; now he’ll be one of us, and now and then he’ll write something.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Szara	In bureaucratic currency, it was quite costly.” “But there’s more to it than that,” [MASK] said. “Yes. There is. A great deal more. I hope you’ll indulge me and let me come at this in my own particular way.”
<name>Doyle</name>	Doyle	Heshel	If the count reached fifty and you had it, well, too bad. You might have to eat a morsel of dirt, or horse pie. The forfeit varied but the principle never did. And there was always some tough little bastard like [MASK] around to play enforcer.
