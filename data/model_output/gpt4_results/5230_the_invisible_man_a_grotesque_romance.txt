<name>Jurgis</name>	Jurgis	Fearenside	No sooner had [MASK]'s dog caught sight of him, however, than it began to bristle and growl savagely, and when he rushed down the steps it gave an undecided hop, and then sprang straight at his hand.
<name>George</name>	George	Kemp	For the first time in his life [MASK] discovered that the hill-road was indescribably vast and desolate, and that the beginnings of the town far below at the hill foot were strangely remote. Never had there been a slower or more painful method of progression than running.
<name>Silas</name>	Silas	Gibbons	[MASK] had heard nothing of the morning's occurrences, but the phenomenon was so striking and disturbing that his philosophical tranquillity vanished; he got up hastily, and hurried down the steepness of the hill towards the village, as fast as he could go.
<name>Moreau</name>	Moreau	Griffin	"But a man's not powdered glass!" "No," said [MASK]. "He's more transparent!" "Nonsense!" "That from a doctor! How one forgets! Have you already forgotten your physics, in ten years?
<name>Poirot</name>	Poirot	Kemp	"That is certain." "But how?" cried [MASK], and suddenly became full of ideas. "You must begin at once. You must set every available man to work; you must prevent his leaving this district.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Kemp	Rather. Did I kill that fool of a constable?" "No," said [MASK]. "He's expected to recover." "That's his luck, then. I clean lost my temper, the fools! Why couldn't they leave me alone?
<name>Stevenson</name>	Stevenson	One	That seems the most probable refuge for him, for there it was he re-asserted himself in a grimly tragical manner about two in the afternoon. [MASK] wonders what his state of mind may have been during that time, and what plans he devised.
<name>Kemp</name>	Kemp	Kemp	"Listen to me." "I demonstrated conclusively this morning," began [MASK], "that invisibility--" "Never mind what you've demonstrated!--I'm starving," said the Voice, "and the night is chilly to a man without clothes." "Food?
<name>God</name>	God	Gawd	"He'll kill me--he's got a knife or something. For [MASK]'s sake--!" "Here you are," said the barman. "Come in here." And he held up the flap of the bar.
<name>Raffles</name>	Raffles	Adye	"It's cruel, I know. But think of what he may do!" [MASK] drew the air in sharply between his teeth. "It's unsportsmanlike. I don't know. But I'll have powdered glass got ready.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Adye	He has wounded men. He will kill them unless we can prevent him. He will create a panic. Nothing can stop him. He is going out now--furious!" "He must be caught," said [MASK].
<name>Kemp</name>	Kemp	Kemp	Suddenly the house was full of the Invisible Man's resounding blows on the kitchen door. The girl stared towards the kitchen, shuddered, and retreated into the dining-room. [MASK] tried to explain in broken sentences. They heard the kitchen door give. "
<name>Fearenside</name>	Fearenside	Fearenside	" It is stated by an anonymous bystander that his trousers and gloves had been changed. "Was you hurt, sir?" said [MASK]. "I'm rare sorry the darg--" "Not a bit," said the stranger. "Never broke the skin.
<name>Kemp</name>	Kemp	Kemp	He walked sideways to the door. Suddenly the dressing-gown walked quickly towards him. "Understand me!" said the dressing-gown. "No attempts to hamper me, or capture me! Or--" [MASK]'s face changed a little.
<name>Lucifer</name>	Lucifer	Delilah	Ambition--what is the good of pride of place when you cannot appear there? What is the good of the love of woman when her name must needs be [MASK]? I have no taste for politics, for the blackguardisms of fame, for philanthropy, for sport.
<name>Kemp</name>	Kemp	Kemp	The point is, they know there is an Invisible Man--as well as we know there is an Invisible Man. And that Invisible Man, [MASK], must now establish a Reign of Terror. Yes; no doubt it's startling. But I mean it.
<name>Swales</name>	Swales	Marvel	The garrison must help. You must wire for help. The only thing that may keep him here is the thought of recovering some books of notes he counts of value. I will tell you of that! There is a man in your police station--[MASK]."
<name>Adela</name>	Adela	Adye	"I know," said [MASK], "I know. Those books--yes. But the tramp...." "Says he hasn't them. But he thinks the tramp has. And you must prevent him from eating or sleeping; day and night the country must be astir for him.
<name>Griffin</name>	Griffin	Hullo	"[MASK]!" cried the constable. "Here's his feet a-showing!" And so, slowly, beginning at his hands and feet and creeping along his limbs to the vital centres of his body, that strange change continued.
<name>Japp</name>	Japp	Jaffers	"I hope so, sir; but I've got my instructions." "Well," said the stranger, "I'll come. I'll _come_. But no handcuffs." "It's the regular thing," said [MASK].
<name>Mark</name>	Mark	Kemp	Emerging into the hill-road, [MASK] naturally took the downward direction, and so it was he came to run in his own person the very race he had watched with such a critical eye from the belvedere study only four days ago.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Henfrey	Well--there wasn't none. Just blackness. I tell you, he's as black as my hat." "My sakes!" said [MASK]. "It's a rummy case altogether. Why, his nose is as pink as paint!"
<name>Kemp</name>	Kemp	Kemp	"Before we can do anything else," said [MASK], "I must understand a little more about this invisibility of yours." He had sat down, after one nervous glance out of the window, with the air of a man who has talking to do.
<name>Campion</name>	Campion	Cuss	"A general impression first, [MASK], and _then_, you know, we can go looking for clues." He coughed, put on his glasses, arranged them fastidiously, coughed again, and wished something would happen to avert the seemingly inevitable exposure.
<name>Kemp</name>	Kemp	Kemp	said [MASK]. "No," said the Invisible Man. "Nor have I heard what became of him. I suppose he untied himself or kicked himself out. The knots were pretty tight." He became silent and went to the window and stared out.
<name>Cavor</name>	Cavor	Cuss	But did you--are you sure? Suppose a mirror, for instance-- hallucinations are so easily produced. I don't know if you have ever seen a really good conjuror--" "I won't argue again," said [MASK].
<name>Kemp</name>	Kemp	Kemp	What else?" "Bear in mind," said [MASK], "his food shows. After eating, his food shows until it is assimilated. So that he has to hide after eating. You must keep on beating. Every thicket, every quiet corner.
<name>Utterson</name>	Utterson	Kemp	[MASK] read this letter twice, "It's no hoax," he said. "That's his voice! And he means it." He turned the folded sheet over and saw on the addressed side of it the postmark Hintondean, and the prosaic detail "2d.
<name>He</name>	He	Kemp	The blinds of all the villas down the hill-road were drawn, but in one little green summer-house was a white figure, apparently an old man asleep. [MASK] scrutinised the surroundings of the house for a glimpse of the revolver, but it had vanished.
<name>Kemp</name>	Kemp	Kemp	A little child playing near [MASK]'s gateway was violently caught up and thrown aside, so that its ankle was broken, and thereafter for some hours the Invisible Man passed out of human perceptions. No one knows where he went nor what he did.
<name>Griffin</name>	Griffin	Hall	As she was the expert and principal operator in this affair, [MASK] very properly went upstairs for it. On the landing he was surprised to see that the stranger's door was ajar. He went on into his own room and found the bottle as he had been directed.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Fear	They were bolting into houses and slamming the doors behind them, with the news. He heard it and made one last desperate spurt. [MASK] came striding by, rushed ahead of him, and in a moment had seized the town.
<name>St. Petersburg</name>	St. Petersburg	Iping	"He started there. And where he came from, nobody don't seem to know. Here it is: 'Pe-culiar Story from [MASK].' And it says in this paper that the evidence is extra-ordinary strong--extra-ordinary."
<name>Curate</name>	Curate	Huxter	Everyone was running back to the village. He rose again and was hit severely behind the ear. He staggered and set off back to the "Coach and Horses" forthwith, leaping over the deserted [MASK], who was now sitting up, on his way.
<name>Jess</name>	Jess	Jaffers	They had come now armed with a warrant. People shouted conflicting information of the recent circumstances. "'Ed or no 'ed," said [MASK], "I got to 'rest en, and 'rest en I _will_."
<name>Marvel</name>	Marvel	Marvel	Extra-ordinary, _I_ call it. Never heard tell of Invisible Men before, I haven't, but nowadays one hears such a lot of extra-ordinary things--that--" "That all he did?" asked [MASK], trying to seem at his ease.
<name>Kemp</name>	Kemp	Kemp	If he goes too far...." "The man's become inhuman, I tell you," said [MASK]. "I am as sure he will establish a reign of terror--so soon as he has got over the emotions of this escape--as I am sure I am talking to you.
<name>Adela</name>	Adela	Adye	The afternoon was very hot and still, nothing seemed stirring in all the world save a couple of yellow butterflies chasing each other through the shrubbery between the house and the road gate. [MASK] lay on the lawn near the gate.
<name>Griffin</name>	Griffin	Teddy	That marn's a piebald, [MASK]. Black here and white there--in patches. And he's ashamed of it. He's a kind of half-breed, and the colour's come off patchy instead of mixing. I've heard of such things before.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Marvel	Footsteps approached, running heavily, the door was pushed open violently, and [MASK], weeping and dishevelled, his hat gone, the neck of his coat torn open, rushed in, made a convulsive turn, and attempted to shut the door.
<name>Kemp</name>	Kemp	Kemp	And I gave her butter to get her to wash." "And you processed her?" "I processed her. But giving drugs to a cat is no joke, [MASK]! And the process failed." "Failed!" "In two particulars.
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Hall	But [MASK] had hardly run a dozen yards before he gave a loud shout of astonishment and went flying headlong sideways, clutching one of the labourers and bringing him to the ground. He had been charged just as one charges a man at football.
<name>Marvel</name>	Marvel	Jaffers	said [MASK], brought up short by a dim realization of the incongruity of the whole business, "Darn it! Can't use 'em as I can see." The stranger ran his arm down his waistcoat, and as if by a miracle the buttons to which his empty sleeve pointed became undone.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Cuss	indeed. A nautical term, referring to his getting back out of the room, I suppose." "I daresay so," said [MASK]. "My nerves are all loose to-day. It quite made me jump--the door opening like that."
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Hall	[MASK] was still out. She had deliberated over this scene, and she came holding a little tray with an unsettled bill upon it. "Is it your bill you're wanting, sir?" she said. "Why wasn't my breakfast laid?
<name>Kemp</name>	Kemp	Kemp	that died down swiftly to a sound like choking. "Get back, you fools!" cried the muffled voice of [MASK], and there was a vigorous shoving back of stalwart forms. "He's hurt, I tell you. Stand back!"
<name>Kemp</name>	Kemp	Kemp	In the morning he had still been simply a legend, a terror; in the afternoon, by virtue chiefly of [MASK]'s drily worded proclamation, he was presented as a tangible antagonist, to be wounded, captured, or overcome, and the countryside began organising itself with inconceivable rapidity.
<name>Kemp</name>	Kemp	Kemp	"Not me," said his visitor. "Some fool I'd never seen fired at random. A lot of them got scared. They all got scared at me. Curse them!--I say--I want more to eat than this, [MASK]."
<name>Kemp</name>	Kemp	Kemp	"Invisible!" said [MASK], and sat down on a bedroom chair. "I always like to get something about me before I eat," said the Invisible Man, with a full mouth, eating greedily. "Queer fancy!"
<name>Kemp</name>	Kemp	Kemp	The smash?" "Fit of temper," said the Invisible Man. "Forgot this arm; and it's sore." "You're rather liable to that sort of thing." "I am." [MASK] walked across the room and picked up the fragments of broken glass.
<name>He</name>	He	Kemp	The two men stopped in the doorway, contemplating the wreckage. [MASK] swore again, and as he did so the third window went with a snap like a pistol, hung starred for a moment, and collapsed in jagged, shivering triangles into the room.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Hall	"You all right thur?" asked [MASK], rapping. The muttered conversation ceased abruptly, for a moment silence, then the conversation was resumed, in hissing whispers, then a sharp cry of "No! no, you don't!
<name>Adela</name>	Adela	Marvel	"On my honour," said the Voice, "I will kill you." "I didn't try to give you the slip," said [MASK], in a voice that was not far remote from tears. "I swear I didn't.
<name>Kemp</name>	Kemp	Kemp	He stared at this in amazement. It was an empty bandage, a bandage properly tied but quite empty. He would have advanced to grasp it, but a touch arrested him, and a voice speaking quite close to him. "[MASK]!" said the Voice.
<name>Raffles</name>	Raffles	Kemp	[MASK] slapped his brow with his hand. "Am I dreaming? Has the world gone mad--or have I?" He laughed, and put his hand to the locked door. "Barred out of my own bedroom, by a flagrant absurdity!"
<name>Griffin</name>	Griffin	Jaffers	"I'll surrender," cried the stranger, though he had [MASK] down, and in another moment he stood up panting, a strange figure, headless and handless--for he had pulled off his right glove now as well as his left.
<name>Marvel</name>	Marvel	Marvel	"Just escaped and that's all, eh?" "All!" said the mariner. "Why!--ain't it enough?" "Quite enough," said [MASK]. "I should think it was enough," said the mariner. "I should think it was enough."
<name>Griffin</name>	Griffin	Kemp	said [MASK]. "That must be--yes--it's one of the bedrooms. He's going to do all the house. But he's a fool. The shutters are up, and the glass will fall outside. He'll cut his feet."
<name>Kemp</name>	Kemp	Kemp	"Yes?" "You know the red colouring matter of blood; it can be made white--colourless--and remain with all the functions it has now!" [MASK] gave a cry of incredulous amazement. The Invisible Man rose and began pacing the little study.
<name>Kemp</name>	Kemp	Adye	What else is there we can do? Put that stuff down." In another moment [MASK] was leading the way downstairs. They found the front door open and the policemen standing outside staring at empty air. "He's got away, sir," said one.
<name>Kemp</name>	Kemp	Kemp	"Oh!" said [MASK], and then roused himself. "I say!" he said. "But this is nonsense. It's some trick." He stepped forward suddenly, and his hand, extended towards the bandage, met invisible fingers.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Kemp	And the man was in his own house, and you were--well, robbing." "Robbing! Confound it! You'll call me a thief next! Surely, [MASK], you're not fool enough to dance on the old strings.
<name>Kemp</name>	Kemp	Kemp	He rolled over and sat up staring. He saw, staggering down the staircase, [MASK], dusty and disheveled, one side of his face white from a blow, his lip bleeding, and a pink dressing-gown and some underclothing held in his arms.
<name>Kemp</name>	Kemp	Kemp	I don't know what your plans are, but of course I'm anxious to help you." The Invisible Man sat down on the bed. "There's breakfast upstairs," said [MASK], speaking as easily as possible, and he was delighted to find his strange guest rose willingly.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Kemp	"He's expected to recover." "That's his luck, then. I clean lost my temper, the fools! Why couldn't they leave me alone? And that grocer lout?" "There are no deaths expected," said [MASK].
<name>Kemp</name>	Kemp	Kemp	It's only the living tissue I've changed, and only for as long as I'm alive.... I've been in the house three hours." "But how's it done?" began [MASK], in a tone of exasperation. "Confound it!
<name>Poirot</name>	Poirot	Fearenside	"It's a rummy case altogether. Why, his nose is as pink as paint!" "That's true," said [MASK]. "I knows that. And I tell 'ee what I'm thinking.
<name>Joxer</name>	Joxer	Jaffers	shouted [MASK], choking and reeling through them all, and wrestling with purple face and swelling veins against his unseen enemy. Men staggered right and left as the extraordinary conflict swayed swiftly towards the house door, and went spinning down the half-dozen steps of the inn.
<name>Kipps</name>	Kipps	Adye	Then things happened very quickly. [MASK] leapt backwards, swung around, clutched at this little object, missed it, threw up his hands and fell forward on his face, leaving a little puff of blue in the air.
<name>Lord</name>	Lord	Cuss	He turned round in a helpless way and took a second glass of the excellent vicar's very inferior sherry. "When I hit his cuff," said [MASK], "I tell you, it felt exactly like hitting an arm. And there wasn't an arm!
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Adye	In another moment [MASK] was on the doorstep and the bolts were dropping back into the staples. He hesitated for a moment, feeling more comfortable with his back against the door. Then he marched, upright and square, down the steps. He crossed the lawn and approached the gate.
<name>Travers</name>	Travers	Adye	Give a man a chance." "You go back to the house. I tell you flatly I will not promise anything." [MASK]'s decision seemed suddenly made. He turned towards the house, walking slowly with his hands behind him.
<name>Kemp</name>	Kemp	Bunting	Queer thing to see an empty sleeve come at you like that! And then--" "Well?" "Something--exactly like a finger and thumb it felt--nipped my nose." [MASK] began to laugh. "There wasn't anything there!"
<name>Cavor</name>	Cavor	Cuss--"incredible	I cannot of course believe in this absurd invisibility story--" "It's incredible," said [MASK]. But the fact remains that I saw--I certainly saw right down his sleeve--" "But did you--are you sure?
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Kemp	"What do you mean to say?" [MASK]'s face grew a trifle hard. He was about to speak and checked himself. "I suppose, after all," he said with a sudden change of manner, "the thing had to be done.
<name>Featherstone</name>	Featherstone	Fearenside	Then the finer end of [MASK]'s whip reached his property, and the dog, yelping with dismay, retreated under the wheels of the waggon. It was all the business of a swift half-minute. No one spoke, everyone shouted.
<name>Kemp</name>	Kemp	Kemp	And I, a shabby, poverty-struck, hemmed-in demonstrator, teaching fools in a provincial college, might suddenly become--this. I ask you, [MASK] if _you_ ... Anyone, I tell you, would have flung himself upon that research.
<name>Cuss</name>	Cuss	Cuss	"What's happened?" said the vicar, putting the ammonite on the loose sheets of his forth-coming sermon. "That chap at the inn--" "Well?" "Give me something to drink," said [MASK], and he sat down.
<name>Griffin</name>	Griffin	Jaffers	For a space people stood amazed and gesticulating, and then came panic, and scattered them abroad through the village as a gust scatters dead leaves. But [MASK] lay quite still, face upward and knees bent, at the foot of the steps of the inn.
<name>Griffin</name>	Griffin	Griffin	He dodged back. The revolver cracked just too late, and a splinter from the edge of the closing door flashed over his head. He slammed and locked the door, and as he stood outside he heard [MASK] shouting and laughing.
<name>Jaffers</name>	Jaffers	Jaffers	He gripped at the waistcoat; it struggled, and the shirt slipped out of it and left it limp and empty in his hand. "Hold him!" said [MASK], loudly. "Once he gets the things off--" "Hold him!"
<name>Kemp</name>	Kemp	Jaffers	In another moment [MASK], cutting short some statement concerning a warrant, had gripped him by the handless wrist and caught his invisible throat. He got a sounding kick on the shin that made him shout, but he kept his grip.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Kemp	After a time I crawled home, took some food and a strong dose of strychnine, and went to sleep in my clothes on my unmade bed. Strychnine is a grand tonic, [MASK], to take the flabbiness out of a man."
<name>Kemp</name>	Kemp	Kemp	"I'll see what there is to eat downstairs," said [MASK]. "Not much, I'm afraid." After he had done eating, and he made a heavy meal, the Invisible Man demanded a cigar.
<name>Gulliver</name>	Gulliver	Kemp	Presently they could see his crushed chest and his shoulders, and the dim outline of his drawn and battered features. When at last the crowd made way for [MASK] to stand erect, there lay, naked and pitiful on the ground, the bruised and broken body of a young man about thirty.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Tap	The door opened suddenly. Both gentlemen started violently, looked round, and were relieved to see a sporadically rosy face beneath a furry silk hat. "[MASK]?" asked the face, and stood staring. "No," said both gentlemen at once.
<name>Prendick</name>	Prendick	Kemp	"Not quite so badly," said [MASK], "but I can imagine it." "I could have smashed the silly devils. At last, faint with the desire for tasteful food, I went into another place and demanded a private room. '
<name>Kemp</name>	Kemp	Kemp	Burning! I had burnt my boats--if ever a man did! The place was blazing." The Invisible Man paused and thought. [MASK] glanced nervously out of the window. "Yes?" he said. "Go on.
<name>Griffin</name>	Griffin	Griffin	But still I don't see quite ... I can understand that thereby you could spoil a valuable stone, but personal invisibility is a far cry." "Precisely," said [MASK]. "But consider, visibility depends on the action of the visible bodies on light.
<name>Marvel</name>	Marvel	Marvel	"It's enough, ain't it?" said the mariner. "Didn't go Back by any chance?" asked [MASK]. "Just escaped and that's all, eh?" "All!" said the mariner.
<name>Kemp</name>	Kemp	Kemp	There stood the apparatus, the experiments arranged and waiting. And now there was scarcely a difficulty left, beyond the planning of details. "I will tell you, [MASK], sooner or later, all the complicated processes. We need not go into that now.
<name>Kemp</name>	Kemp	Kemp	The doors of the "Jolly Cricketers" stood suddenly wide open. Very little was said. [MASK] felt about, his hand seeming to pass through empty air. "He's not breathing," he said, and then, "I can't feel his heart.
<name>Kemp</name>	Kemp	Kemp	[MASK] stood in the middle of the room staring at the headless garment. "I suppose I must leave you," he said. "It's--incredible. Three things happening like this, overturning all my preconceptions--would make me insane. But it's real!
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Bunting	"We've thrashed that out, [MASK]. And just now there's these books--Ah! here's some of what I take to be Greek! Greek letters certainly." He pointed to the middle of the page.
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Kemp	[MASK] stared at the devouring dressing gown. A ray of candle-light penetrating a torn patch in the right shoulder, made a triangle of light under the left ribs. "What were the shots?" he asked. "How did the shooting begin?"
<name>Heyst</name>	Heyst	Hall	[MASK] did not like him, and whenever he dared he talked of the advisability of getting rid of him; but he showed his dislike chiefly by concealing it ostentatiously, and avoiding his visitor as much as possible. "
<name>He</name>	He	Cuss	unfounded--"but I didn't rightly hear it." She thought it seemed so silly not to know the man's name. [MASK] rapped at the parlour door and entered. There was a fairly audible imprecation from within. "
<name>Kemp</name>	Kemp	Kemp	"No one would know he was a confederate," said the Invisible Man, eagerly. And then suddenly, "Hush! What's that downstairs?" "Nothing," said [MASK], and suddenly began to speak loud and fast.
<name>Heaven</name>	Heaven	Heaven	with such extraordinary violence that he silenced her instantly. "You don't understand," he said, "who I am or what I am. I'll show you. By [MASK]! I'll show you." Then he put his open palm over his face and withdrew it.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Kemp	In spite of all that has happened, in spite of this publicity, of the loss of my books, of what I have suffered, there still remain great possibilities, huge possibilities--" "You have told no one I am here?" he asked abruptly. [MASK] hesitated.
