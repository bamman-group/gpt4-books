<name>Essun</name>	Essun	Dana	I knew it was a title of respect in this culture, and I respected her. But I couldn’t quite manage “Aunt” any more than I could have managed “Mammy.” She didn’t seem to mind. She looked up. “[MASK]!
<name>Alia</name>	Alia	Rufus	I was staring at my hands, trying to think. Every time I got used to one impossibility, I ran into another. “She’s no slave, either,” said [MASK]. “She’s free, bom free like her mother.” “Oh?
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Rufe	Me! I told her I would free both of them.” “She didn’t believe you. You wouldn’t put anything into writing.” “I would have.” I shrugged. “Where are the children, [MASK]?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Rufus	As I had expected, the men led me to a small log cabin in a moonlit clearing in the woods. [MASK] had told me I could reach the Greenwood cabin by way of the road, but he hadn’t told me the cabin sat back out of sight of the road.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Rufus	“This boy and I are liable to have a long association whether we like it or not. I want him to know.” “Good luck.” “Where do you come from?” repeated [MASK]. “You sure don’t talk like anybody I ever heard.”
<name>Tituba</name>	Tituba	Alice	“It’s right,” he said quickly. “And ... is there a black girl, maybe a slave girl, named [MASK] living around here somewhere?” I wasn’t sure of the girl’s last name. The memory was coming back to me in fragments.
<name>Spartacus</name>	Spartacus	Vesey	You know who [MASK] was?” “Yes.” A freedman who had plotted to free others violently. “You know what they did to him?” “Yes.” “Then put that book in the fire.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alice	With [MASK] and I in the house, she knew she could be spared. She had cried with the fear that she would be spared. “You do everything they tell you,” she wept, “and they still treat you like a old dog.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Kevin	Was he going to show a little humanity then? Did he have any left to show? “I told her about you,” he said. “I know. She recognized me.” “I told her everything. Even about you and [MASK] being married.
<name>Jonas</name>	Jonas	Kevin	I’ve got no love at all for that place, but so help me, when I saw it again, it was so much like coming home that it scared me.” [MASK] stroked his beard. “I grew this to come back.”
<name>Henrietta</name>	Henrietta	Luke	[MASK] could be a relative of mine.” “Just make sure you don’t wind up like him.” “I haven’t done anything.” “Don’t go teaching nobody else to read.” “Oh.” “Yes, oh.
<name>He</name>	He	Rufus	He’s in a lot of pain. I think someone should go for the doctor.” “You’re doctor enough for him.” “But ...” I stopped, took a deep breath, made myself calm down. [MASK] was groaning behind me.
<name>Bella</name>	Bella	Dana	I leaned back against him, desperate for any support I could find, and closed my eyes. He didn’t say anything more for a long while—not until we were nearing the house. Then, “You awake, [MASK]?” I sat straight.
<name>Sambo</name>	Sambo	Luke	“[MASK] did his work,” I said. “How could your father sell him?” “He worked all right. And the hands would work hard for him— mostly without the cowhide. But sometimes he didn’t show much sense.”
<name>Job</name>	Job	Job	I had shrugged off my aunt and uncle’s strict Baptist teachings years before. But even now, especially now, the bitter melancholy words of [MASK] could still reach me. “Man that is bom of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Kevin	Then he said I was a damn fool for promising.” He paused. “But that promise was the only thing that made him send for [MASK]. He didn’t do it out of gratitude to you for helping me. He did it because I had given my word.
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Sarah	“It’s over,” he said. “There’s nothing you can do to change any of it now.” “I know.” I drew a deep breath. “I wonder whether the children were allowed to stay together—maybe stay with [MASK].”
<name>Turner</name>	Turner	Rufus	[MASK]. His name brought back all my fear and confusion and longing to go home. Would I really have to go all the way to some northern state to find peace? And if I did, what kind of peace would it be?
<name>Stanley</name>	Stanley	Luke	It was amazing how much misery the man could cause doing the same job [MASK] had managed to do without hurting anyone. “You!” he said to me. He knew my name. “You go do the wash.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Rufus	I think he was bored lying in there with nothing to do.” “I didn’t ask you what you thought,” he said. I said nothing. He walked me farther from [MASK]’s door, then stopped and turned to look hard at me.
<name>Emmett</name>	Emmett	Sarah	I noticed, now, that he was watching the big muscular man who had tried to get me to dance—the same man who had spoken to me at the com husking. I would have to ask [MASK] to tell him not to speak to me again.
<name>Lucius</name>	Lucius	Rufus	There was a tree limb hanging high above us. A broken tree limb. “You know where he lives?” I asked. “Sure. I live there too.” The boy was probably a slave, I realized, the property of [MASK]’s family.
<name>Roger</name>	Roger	Tess	He had to believe. He was my anchor here in my own time. The only person who had any idea what I was going through. “You know what I thought,” I said, “when I saw [MASK] tied into that coffle?”
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Kevin	I didn’t want to find out. So while [MASK] got ready to go to the library, I sat on the bed, fully dressed, stuffing a comb, a brush, and a bar of soap into my canvas bag.
<name>Boo</name>	Boo	Kevin	“I see you and him together sometimes when you think nobody’s looking. You can make him do just about anything you want him to do.” Her smile surprised me. I would have expected her to be disgusted with me—or with [MASK].
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Rufus	“Don’t worry. We arrived together and we’ll leave together.” I didn’t stop worrying, but I smiled and changed the subject. “How’s [MASK]? I heard him screaming.” “Poor kid. I was glad when he passed out.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Kevin	“I’m going to take you to the hospital,” said [MASK]. “I don’t know how I’m going to explain you, but you need help.” “No.” He got up. I felt him lift me.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Rufus	I had probably vanished before the woman’s eyes. What had she thought of that? “I asked her where you went,” said [MASK], “and she got mad and said she didn’t know. I asked her again later, and she hit me.
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	Kevin	He stopped, glared at me as though I was some stranger who had dared to lay hands on him. “[MASK], you can’t come back all at once any more than you can leave all at once. It takes time.
<name>I</name>	I	Alice	When she was tired of hearing me read, she thought of other things for me to do. Her laundry, for instance. She wouldn’t trust anyone else to do it. I wondered whether she had already found out that [MASK] generally did the laundry.
<name>Kevin</name>	Kevin	Kevin	I assumed that meant they couldn’t see us either—or hear us over the distance and their own noise. I spoke to [MASK] again. “You might be able to go through this whole experience as an observer,” I said.
<name>He</name>	He	Rufus	“Can she fix your leg?” [MASK] looked at me questioningly. “I doubt it,” I said, “but let me see anyway.” I moved his hands away and as gently as I could, pulled his pants leg up.
<name>Jake</name>	Jake	Rufus	You got here because you were holding me. I’m afraid that may be the only way you can get home.” 3 [MASK]’s father arrived on a flat-bed wagon, carrying his familiar long rifle—an old muzzleloader, I realized.
<name>Atlas</name>	Atlas	Sarah	“You think you’d want him alive if you was her?” He gestured toward the woman. “Is she your wife?” “Yeah.” He was like [MASK], holding himself back, not killing in spite of anger I could only imagine.
<name>Eva</name>	Eva	Dana	He saw me at once, but still, he looked around—to see whether we were alone? We were. He came over and sat next to me on my pallet. “I’m sorry, [MASK],” he said. Sorry?
<name>Offred</name>	Offred	Nigel	In a more rational society, an ability to write would be of great help to her. But here, the only people who could read her writing would be those who might punish her for being able to write. And [MASK].
<name>I</name>	I	Kevin	I leaned forward and cried into the dirty pink water. The skin of my back stretched agonizingly, and the water got pinker. And it was all pointless. There was nothing I could do. I had no control at all over anything. [MASK] might as well be dead.
<name>Pa</name>	Pa	Kevin	And he was going to learn brand new things about pain. If I could give him any comfort by staying with him, I wanted to stay. But I couldn’t. His father had spoken a few private words with [MASK] and was now climbing back up onto the seat of the wagon.
<name>Peony</name>	Peony	Dana	There, before him, she repeated the face-rubbing gesture, and he nodded. “She means it doesn’t come off, [MASK],” he said quietly. “The black. She means the devil with people who say you’re anything but what you are.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Kevin	I didn’t love the agency now, but, on the other hand, I didn’t kick the furniture in the morning anymore, either. “Quit,” [MASK] told me. “I’ll help you out until you find a better job.”
<name>Toby</name>	Toby	Carrie	I looked at her. “I said what’s it like to be a slave?” “I don’t know.” I took a deep breath. “I wonder how [MASK] is doing-in all that pain, and not even able to scream.”
<name>Kjartan</name>	Kjartan	Rufus	If [MASK] decided to make me run behind his horse, I would be dragged to death. He noticed that I was holding my side as he half-carried me back to his horse, and he stopped to move my hand and look at the wound.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Rufe	I’ll help you get home, though, if you’ll point the way.” “Where did she go?” “I don’t know, [MASK].” He tried to sit up, managed to raise himself about six inches before he fell back, groaning.
<name>Jamie</name>	Jamie	Kevin	“[MASK], get down. I can’t reach you up there.” And he was off the horse and over the laundry yard fence, pulling me to him before I could take another breath. The dull ache in my back and shoulders roared to life.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Nigel	“In the attic?” He lifted her gently, carefully, and carried her up to his bedroom. [MASK] and I followed him up, saw him place the girl on his bed. Then he looked up at me questioningly.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Dana	None of it should have surprised me at all. “[MASK],” he said one afternoon in the library, “I’d have to be crazy to make a will freeing these people and then tell you about it. I could die damn young for that kind of craziness.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alice	“They cut him! They cut off his ears!” I had been hoping she hadn’t seen that. “[MASK]!” I held her by the shoulders and shook her. “I’ve got to get away,” she wept.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Kevin	Not that any kind of knife had been very effective for me so far. Having one just made me feel safer. I dropped the knife into the bag and replaced soap, tooth paste, some clothing, a few other things. My thoughts went back to [MASK].
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Kevin	We don’t need money badly enough for you to put up with whatever she plans to do next.” “No, [MASK]. I had a reason for not telling you about the coffee.” “I’m wondering what else you haven’t told me.”
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Rufus	I was still in the cornfield, still lying in the dirt. “I came to get you,” said [MASK]. “Not soon enough, I guess.” I struggled to my feet. He offered a hand to help me, but I ignored it.
<name>Albus</name>	Albus	Rufus	“What?” “Let me help you with [MASK] as much as I can. Let’s see what we can do to keep him from growing up into a red-haired version of his father.” 5
<name>He</name>	He	Weylin	He was looking back at me, so I frowned and looked perplexed and said, “I think he has a fever as well as broken ribs, sir.” [MASK] made a sound of disgust. “He was sick yesterday, puking all over.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Rufus	But here was [MASK] offering ... Offering what? A bribe? Another apology? “What’s the matter?” he said. “Seems to me, this is better than any offer I’ve made you so far.” “No doubt.”
<name>He</name>	He	Kevin	I don’t think you were really capable of killing him until he attacked you.” And barely then, I thought. [MASK] would never know what those last moments had been like. I had outlined them for him, and he’d asked few questions.
<name>me</name>	me	Nigel	I gave him aspirins—too many, but not as many as he wanted. I made him take broth and soup and fruit and vegetable juices. He didn’t want them. He never wanted to eat, but he didn’t want [MASK] holding him down either.
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Nigel	She looked at me as though she’d just noticed me. “See to the supper,” she said. “I was going to send somebody in to finish cooking, but you can, can’t you?” “Yes.” “Good.” She and [MASK] hurried away.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Sarah	I wasn’t really afraid. Dogs with white men frightened me, or dogs in packs—[MASK] had told me of runaways who had been tom to pieces by the packs of dogs used to hunt them. But one lone dog didn’t seem to be much of a threat.
<name>the woman</name>	the woman	Rufus	The man twisted around to glare at me. “What will they do to the woman if you kill him?” I asked. That seemed to reach him. He released [MASK] and stood straight to face me. “Who’s going to say I did anything to him?”
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Rufe	“Why?” I stared at him. “What’s wrong?” he asked. “Why are you mad?” “Your mother always call black people niggers, [MASK]?” “Sure, except when she has company. Why not?”
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Kevin	“Sent me to the field, had me beaten, made me spend nearly eight months sleeping on the floor of his mother’s room, sold people ... He’s done plenty, but the worst of it was to other people. He hasn’t raped me, [MASK].
<name>Jamie</name>	Jamie	Nigel	He says all the doc knows is bleeding and blistering and purging and puking and making folks sicker than they was to start.” I swallowed, remembered the pompous little man I had disliked so. “Is the doctor really that bad, [MASK]?”
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Dana	I was still in hell. I closed my eyes, not caring what would happen next. “[MASK], get up. You’ll be hurt more if I carry you than if you walk.” The words echoed strangely in my head.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Hagar	No doubt most information about her life had died with her. At least it had died before it filtered down to me. There was only the Bible left. [MASK] had filled pages of it with her careful script.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Weylin	I didn’t think I had said enough to [MASK] for him to make that kind of judgment. I hoped he wasn’t going to make that kind of judgment. I wasn’t good at accents. I had deliberately decided not to try to assume one.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Alice	“[MASK], stop. You’ll make me hurt you.” She was struggling against me with all her feeble strength. “They cut him! They cut off his ears!” I had been hoping she hadn’t seen that.
<name>Keiko</name>	Keiko	Dana	“[MASK].” “Yes?” What now? “Go read a book or something. Don’t do any more work today.” “Read a book?” “Do whatever you want to.” In other words, he was sorry.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Rufus	Which I didn’t do. Finally, I gave up. I looked around to see [MASK] on the floor near me. I didn’t know whether he had sat down or fallen, but I was glad he was sitting now.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Rufus	I went to [MASK]’s time fully clothed, carrying my denim bag, wearing my knife. I arrived on my knees because of the dizziness, but I was immediately alert and wary. I was in the woods either late in the day or early in the morning.
<name>Levi</name>	Levi	Buz	I hadn’t intended to. I was caffeine jittery and surly and perfectly capable of wasting his money. After all, I’d told him not to spend it. But I ate. [MASK] sidled by. “Hey,” he said, low-voiced.
<name>Ron</name>	Ron	Kevin	I was lying on something unbelievably soft and comfortable ... My bed. Home. [MASK]? I could hear regular breathing beside me now. I sat up and reached out to turn on the lamp—or I tried to. Sitting up made me faint and dizzy.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Kevin	The words touched me as no others could have. I knew about loneliness. I found my thoughts going back to the time I had gone home without [MASK]—the loneliness, the fear, sometimes the hopelessness I had felt then.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Kevin	She decided to teach me to sew. I had an old Singer at home and I could sew well enough with it to take care of my needs and [MASK]’s. But I thought sewing by hand, especially sewing for “pleasure” was slow torture.
<name>John</name>	John	Weylin	The rain washed them both fairly clean before we reached the house. Inside, we met [MASK] who was coming down the stairs. He stopped short as he saw us. “You!” he said, staring at me.
<name>He</name>	He	Rufus	I looked back in sudden apprehension and [MASK] laughed. “Not today,” he said. “But someday, if you don’t remember.” “Hell,” I muttered. “How long?” He laughed again.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Kevin	I wasn’t even aware that [MASK] was following me until he spoke. “That’s the game I thought they were playing,” he said. “I’ve seen them at it before. They play at field work too.” I shook my head.
<name>George</name>	George	Kevin	She said ... Oh. She gets her meaning across, [MASK]. Weren’t you around the place long enough to find that out?” “She never tried to get much across to me. I used to wonder whether she was a little retarded.”
<name>Alanna</name>	Alanna	Sarah	But keep out of his way as much as you can.” “Gladly. I plan to fit myself into the cookhouse if I can. I’m going to tell [MASK] you want me to learn how to cook for you.” He gave a short laugh.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Rufus	For the sake of the people whose lives [MASK] controlled, I didn’t wish him dead, but I wouldn’t rest easy until I knew he was. As things stood now, sooner or later, he would get himself into trouble again and call me.
<name>Mark</name>	Mark	Rufus	Maybe that will be enough. I hope so. But if it isn’t, if I do have to come here alone. I’ll have a better chance of surviving if I stay here now and work on the insurance we talked about. [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alice	Actually, he didn’t like working at all. But if he had to do it, he wanted company. I didn’t realize how much he preferred my company in particular until he came in one night a little drunk and found [MASK] and I eating together in her cabin.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Rufus	But she made it sound as though she were saying, “You’re to go straight to hell!” There was something about me that these people didn’t like—except for [MASK]. It wasn’t just racial. They were used to black people.
<name>David</name>	David	Kevin	I tried to think through the drugs, through the distant pain, but there was no honest explanation I could give them—none they would believe. “An accident,” I repeated. “My fault, not [MASK]’s. Please let me see him.”
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Kevin	I got up slowly, cautiously, found that it didn’t hurt any more to stand than it did to lie down. My head was clear now, and I could walk without trouble. “Go to bed,” said [MASK]. “Get some rest.”
<name>Myrtle</name>	Myrtle	Sarah	[MASK] shook her head. “It’s funny. I thought she was finally settlin’ down with him—getting not to mind so much.” “If she was, I don’t think she could have forgiven herself for it.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Rufus	“Matter of opinion,” I said. “Look, if you care what happens to [MASK], you’d better go tell his father to send a ... a wagon for him. He won’t be walking anywhere.” “He could lean on me.”
<name>She</name>	She	Alice	He tottered away. [MASK] and I looked at each other. I thought she would laugh because she took any opportunity she could find to laugh at him—though not to his face because he would beat her when he decided she needed it. She didn’t laugh.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Rufe	“I wish you hadn’t said that, [MASK],” I told him quietly. I went over to him, fighting down anger and disappointment and began putting the things that he had scattered back into my bag. “Wait a minute.” He caught my hand.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Kevin	My cousin came over, and when [MASK] answered the door, she didn’t recognize him. “What’s the matter with him?” she whispered later when she and I were alone. “He’s been sick,” I lied. “With what?”
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Kevin	[MASK] told me. He told me about the books you wrote too. Your own books.” “That’s how he and I earn our living.” “Yeah. Well, I thought you might miss it—writing your own things, I mean.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Kevin	My father will be back by then. He’d want you to stay.” “You can tell your father—!” I dug my fingers into [MASK]’s shoulder, cutting off the rush of words before they became insulting in content as well as in tone.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Kevin	“Nineteen sixty-five,” he read, “nineteen sixty-seven, nineteen seventy-one, nineteen seventy. None of them say nineteen seventy-six.” “None of them say eighteen-anything either,” said [MASK]. “But here.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Dana	he said petulantly. He was panting and holding his side. I watched him, wondering how much he had really grown up. “[MASK], say something!” “I want you to say something.” He squinted at me. “What?”
<name>Clayton</name>	Clayton	Rufus	I asked. She nodded, then made her sign for white people and pushed me toward the door. I went. I found [MASK] at his desk in the library fondling a hand gun. He looked up and saw me just as I was about to withdraw.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Rufus	When [MASK] saw that it was his mother who held him, he clung to her, screaming as loudly as he could. There was nothing wrong with his voice, anyway. Then, suddenly, there was another voice. “What the devil’s going on here?”
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Kevin	“Get away, [MASK]!” He said something, but suddenly, there was too much noise for me to hear him—even if he had still been there. 2 There was water, rain pouring down on me. I was sitting in mud clutching my bag.
<name>Rosemary</name>	Rosemary	Hagar	“I guess so. Anyway, all that means we’re two halves of the same woman—at least in his crazy head.” 11 The time passed slowly, uneventfully, as I waited for the birth of the child I hoped would be [MASK].
<name>Yura</name>	Yura	Rufus	But he was still sick. His fever was still with him. And the doctor didn’t come. [MASK] had fits of coughing now and then, and that seemed to be agonizing to him because of his ribs.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Kevin	He looked up solemnly. “I keep thinking you’re going to go home—that somebody will come and tell me you and [MASK] are gone. I don’t want you to go. But I don’t want you to get hurt here either.”
<name>Yes</name>	Yes	Desperation	“Her husband is prejudiced?” “Her husband would have made a good Nazi. She used to joke about it—though never when he could hear.” “But she married him.” “[MASK]. She would have married almost anybody.”
<name>Colin</name>	Colin	Kevin	“We’ll have to go to the library then,” said [MASK]. “We’ll go today as soon as it’s open.” “If I’m still here when it opens.” He put the books on the floor and got back under the cover.
