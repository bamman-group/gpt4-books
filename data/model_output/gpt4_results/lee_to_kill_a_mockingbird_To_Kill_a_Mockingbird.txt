<name>Boo</name>	Boo	Dill	“Got anything to eat?” In a dream, I went to the kitchen. I brought him back some milk and half a pan of com bread left over from supper. [MASK] devoured it, chewing with his front teeth, as was his custom.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Atticus	“Heck, let’s go out on the front porch. There are plenty of chairs out there, and it’s still warm enough.” I wondered why [MASK] was inviting us to the front porch instead of the livingroom, then I understood.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Atticus	“Stop that noise,” [MASK] said. His curtness stung me. The comb was midway in its journey, and I banged it down. For no reason I felt myself beginning to cry, but I could not stop. This was not my father.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jem	. think I ducked on the ground . .. heard a tusslin’ under the tree sort of. . . they were bammin’ against the trunk, sounded like. [MASK] found me and started pullin’ me toward the road.
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Francis	“What’d you get for Christmas?” I asked politely. “Just what I asked for,” he said. [MASK] had requested a pair of knee-pants, a red leather booksack, five shirts and an untied bow tie.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Jem	“How does a snake feel?” “Sort of rough. Cold. Dusty. Why?” “I think there’s one under my bed. Can you come look?” “Are you bein’ funny?” [MASK] opened the door.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Scout	“Don’t you touch him!” I kicked the man swiftly. Barefooted, I was surprised to see him fall back in real pain. I intended to kick his shin, but aimed too high. “That’ll do. [MASK].”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jem	After that, it didn’t matter whether they went or not. [MASK] said he would take me. Thus began our longest journey together. THE WEATHER WAS unusually warm for the last day of October. We didn’t even need jackets.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Jem	[MASK] giggled. “He’s got a Co-Cola bottle full of whiskey in there. That’s so’s not to upset the ladies. You’ll see him sip it all afternoon, he’ll step out for a while and fill it back up.”
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Jem	“What’s he doin’, trying to catch his tail?” “No, he’s doin’ like this.” [MASK] gulped like a goldfish, hunched his shoulders and twitched his torso. “He’s goin’ like that, only not like he means to.”
<name>I</name>	I	Jem	“Yeah,” I said, “but we never go by here in the summertime.” We went home. Next morning the twine was where we had left it. When it was still there on the third day, [MASK] pocketed it.
<name>Jem</name>	Jem	Jem	One by one, the congregation came forward and dropped nickels and dimes into a black enameled coffee can. [MASK] and I followed suit, and received a soft, “Thank you, thank you,” as our dimes clinked. To our amazement.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jem	[MASK] let me do the honors: I pulled out two small im- ages carved in soap. One was the figure of a boy, the other wore a crude dress. Before I remembered that there was no such thing as hoodooing, I shrieked and threw them down.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Plank	Nothing—it seems with all that you’d be proud of him. Can’t everybody play a Jew’s Harp. Now keep out of the way of the carpenters. You’d better go home, I’ll be in my azaleas and can’t watch you. [MASK] might hit you.”
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Jem	“A lady?” [MASK] raised his head. His face was scarlet. “After all those things she said about you, a lady?” “She was. She had her own views about things, a lot different from mine, maybe .
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Scout	Don’t say nigger, [MASK]. That’s common.” “’s what everybody at school says.” “From now on it’ll be everybody less one—” “Well if you don’t want me to grow up talkin’ that way, why do you send me to school?”
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Atticus	I saw something only a lawyer’s child could be expected to see, could be expected to watch for, and it was like watching [MASK] walk into the street, raise a rifle to his shoulder and pull the trigger, but watching all the time knowing that the gun was empty.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Atticus	“Yes sir. She wants me to come every afternoon after school and Saturdays and read to her out loud for two hours. [MASK], do I have to?” “Certainly.” “But she wants me to do it for a month.”
<name>Wolfsheim</name>	Wolfsheim	Dill	I punched [MASK]. Having passed the judge’s inspection, the cigar suffered a vicious bite. “We come down sometimes to watch him,” I explained. “It’s gonna take him the rest of the afternoon, now. You watch.”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Dill	We watched [MASK] emerge by degrees. He was a tight fit. He stood up and eased his shoulders, turned his feet in their ankle sockets, rubbed the back of his neck. His circulation restored, he said, “Hey.”
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Jem	“If we’d had two of that crowd, we’d’ve had a hung jury.” [MASK] said slowly, “You mean you actually put on the jury a man who wanted to kill you the night before?
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Atticus	“I’ll answer any question you got—get me up here an’ mock me, will you? I’ll answer any question you got—” “That’s fine,” said [MASK]. “There’re only a few more.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Atticus	A curious contest, the nature of which eluded me, was developing between my father and the sheriff. It was [MASK]’s turn to get up and go to the edge of the porch. He said, “H’rm,” and spat dryly into the yard.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Jack	“[MASK]! When a child asks you something, answer him, for goodness’ sake. But don’t make a production of it. Children are children, but they can spot an evasion quicker than adults, and evasion simply muddles ’em.
<name>Jem</name>	Jem	Jem	He was silent for a while, then he said, “When I went back for my breeches—they were all in a tangle when I was gettin’ out of ’em, I couldn’t get ’em loose. When I went back—” [MASK] took a deep breath.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Atticus	“She was too scared to know exactly what went on.” “You’d be surprised,” [MASK] said grimly. “I’m not sayin’ she made it up, I’m sayin’ she was too scared to know exactly what happened.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jem	He set me on my feet, and I made a secret reconnaissance of [MASK]. He seemed to be all in one piece, but he had a queer look on his face. Perhaps she had given him a dose of calomel.
<name>Mockingbirds</name>	Mockingbirds	Mockingbirds	“Your father’s right,” she said. “[MASK] don’t do one thing but make music for us to enjoy. They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in comcribs, they don’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us.
<name>Turtle</name>	Turtle	Dill	“You mean when somebody’s dyin’ you can smell it?” “No, I mean I can smell somebody an’ tell if they’re gonna die. An old lady taught me how.” [MASK] leaned over and sniffed me.
<name>Georgie</name>	Georgie	Jem	They said it ran in her family. I did not miss her, but I think [MASK] did. He remembered her clearly, and sometimes in the middle of a game he would sigh at length, then go off and play by himself behind the car-house.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Shotgun	He was supposed to marry one of the—the Spencer ladies, I think. They were gonna have a huge weddin’, but they didn’t—after the rehearsal the bride went upstairs and blew her head off. [MASK]. She pulled the trigger with her toes.”
<name>Pat</name>	Pat	Scout	if I connived at something like this, frankly I couldn’t meet his eye, and the day I can’t do that I’ll know I’ve lost him. I don’t want to lose him and [MASK], because they’re all I’ve got.”
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Jem	“[MASK]’s all right. He won’t wake up tonight, I hope, so don’t worry. That the knife that killed him, Heck?” “No sir, still in him. Looked like a kitchen knife from the handle.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Francis	“Well, can’t you just see his face when he gets a letter from me with nothing in it? It’ll drive him nuts.” Talking to [MASK] gave me the sensation of settling slowly to the bottom of the ocean.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Atticus	“If you’ll concede the necessity of going to school, we’ll go on reading every night just as we always have. Is it a bargain?” “Yes sir!” “We’ll consider it sealed without the usual formality,” [MASK] said, when he saw me preparing to spit.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Calpumia	“Well, I asked [MASK] cornin’ from church that day what it was and she said ask you but I forgot to and now I’m askin’ you.” His paper was now in his lap. “Again, please,” he said.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Jem	I said did that include the colored folks and Englishmen and he said yes.” “Background doesn’t mean Old Family,” said [MASK]. “I think it’s how long your family’s been readin’ and writin’.
<name>Jem</name>	Jem	Jem	The second grade was grim, but [MASK] assured me that the older I got the better school would be, that he started off the same way, and it was not until one reached the sixth grade that one learned anything of value.
<name>Hitler</name>	Hitler	Hitler	Well anyway, [MASK]’s started a program to round up all the half-Jews too and he wants to register ’em in case they might wanta cause him any trouble and I think this is a bad thing and that’s my current event.”
<name>George</name>	George	Jem	They’re ugly, but those are the facts of life.” “Doesn’t make it right,” said [MASK] stolidly. He beat his fist softly on his knee. “You just can’t convict a man on evidence like that—you can’t.”
<name>George</name>	George	Jem	That kind of thing’s pretty dry to most men.” “How do you know?” “Oh, go on and leave me alone. I’m readin’ the paper.” [MASK] got his wish. I departed for the kitchen.
<name>Stenographer</name>	Stenographer	Aviator	Hurriedly I began choosing my vocation. Nurse? [MASK]? “Well...” “Why shoot, I thought you wanted to be a lawyer, you’ve already commenced going to court.” The ladies laughed again.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Atticus	I followed the top of his head as he made his way to the door. He did not look up. Someone was punching me, but I was reluctant to take my eyes from the people below us, and from the image of [MASK]’s lonely walk down the aisle.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Scout	He said softly, “[MASK], can you take that thing off?” “I think so, but I ain’t got anything on under it much.” “I’ve got your dress here.” “I can’t get it on in the dark.”
<name>Jem</name>	Jem	Atticus	Then he rose and broke the remaining code of our childhood. He went out of the room and down the hall. “[MASK],” his voice was distant, “can you come here a minute, sir?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jem	There’s a little teeny light way off somewhere, though.” “Let’s get away from here,” breathed [MASK]. “Let’s go ’round in back again. Sh-h,” he warned me, as I was about to protest.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Atticus	“Gentle breeding,” he continued, when I had found and scratched it, “and that you should try to live up to your name—” [MASK] persevered in spite of us: “She asked me to tell you you must try to behave like the little lady and gentleman that you are.
<name>Myrtle</name>	Myrtle	Alexandra	The gentle hum of ladies’ voices grew louder as she opened the door. “Why, [MASK], I never saw such charlotte . . . just lovely ... I never can get my crust like this, never can ... who’d’ve thought of little dewberry tarts ...
<name>Grandfather</name>	Grandfather	Jem	When we had five baskets of earth and two baskets of snow, [MASK] said we were ready to begin. “Don’t you think this is kind of a mess?” I asked. “Looks messy now, but it won’t later,” he said.
<name>Jem</name>	Jem	Jem	It was times like these when I thought my father, who hated guns and had never been to any wars, was the bravest man who ever lived. The day after [MASK]’s twelfth birthday his money was burning up his pockets, so we headed for town in the early afternoon.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	He seemed to be a respectable Negro, and a respectable Negro would never go up into somebody’s yard of his own volition. ‘[MASK], what happened to you on the evening of November twenty-first of last year?”
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Dill	“Ah—I won ’em from him,” he said vaguely. “Won them? How?” [MASK]’s hand sought the back of his head. He brought it forward and across his forehead. “We were playin’ strip poker up yonder by the fishpool,” he said.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Dill	[MASK] had seemed to be all right that day, nothing wrong with him, but I guessed he hadn’t fully recovered from running away. “Ain’t you feeling good?” I asked, when we reached the bottom of the stairs.
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Atticus	“Do what? Put him under a peace bond?” “When a man says he’s gonna get you, looks like he means it.” “He meant it when he said it,” said [MASK].
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Atticus	You were lueky not to be killed.” I hushed then and there. At the same time I marveled at [MASK]. This was the first he had let us know he knew a lot more about something than we thought he knew. And it had happened years ago.
<name>I</name>	I	Jem	A small boy clutching a Negro woman’s hand walked toward us. He looked all Negro to me: he was rich chocolate with flaring nostrils and beautiful teeth. Sometimes he would skip happily, and the Negro woman tugged his hand to make him stop. [MASK] waited until they passed us.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Jem	“I’m goin’ around to the side of the house,” said [MASK]. “We looked yesterday from across the street, and there’s a shutter loose. Think maybe I can make it stick on the window sill, at least.”
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Atticus	They persisted in pleading Not Guilty to first-degree murder, so there was nothing much [MASK] could do for his clients except be present at their departure, an occasion that was probably the beginning of my father’s profound distaste for the practice of criminal law.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Jem	[MASK] was rearranging the objects on his dresser. His hair stuck up behind and down in front, and I wondered if it would ever look like a man’s—maybe if he shaved it off and started over, his hair would grow back neatly in place.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Atticus	He looked strangely overweight. “Hurry, hon,” said [MASK]. “Here’re your shoes and socks.” Stupidly, I put them on. “Is it morning?” “No, it’s a little after one. Hurry now.”
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Scout	If there’s just one kind of folks, why can’t they get along with each other? If they’re all alike, why do they go out of their way to despise each other? [MASK], I think I’m beginning to understand something.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Atticus	“I wondered why he had those marks on him. His sleeves were perforated with little holes. There were one or two little puncture marks on his arms to match the holes. Let me see that thing if you will, sir.” [MASK] fetched the remains of my costume.
<name>Jess</name>	Jess	Dill	“I’da got her told,” growled [MASK], gnawing a chicken leg, “but she didn’t look much like tellin’ this morning. Said she was up half the night wonderin’ where I was, said she’da had the sheriff after me
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Jem	We bounded down the sidewalk on a spree of sheer relief, leaping and howling. That spring was a good one: the days grew longer and gave us more playing time. [MASK]’s mind was occupied mostly with the vital statistics of every college football player in the nation.
<name>Jem</name>	Jem	Jem	I felt the sand go cold under my feet and I knew we were near the big oak. [MASK] pressed my head. We stopped and listened. Shuffle-foot had not stopped with us this time. His trousers swished softly and steadily. Then they stopped.
<name>Mac</name>	Mac	Scout	“Ain’t it a long time?” I asked him. “Sure is, [MASK],” he said happily. “Well, from the way you put it, it’d just take five minutes.”
<name>Maycomb</name>	Maycomb	Ken	He won’t wake up tonight, I hope, so don’t worry. That the knife that killed him, Heck?” “No sir, still in him. Looked like a kitchen knife from the handle. [MASK] oughta be there with the hearse by now, doctor, ’night.”
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Atticus	[MASK]’s fingers went to his watchpocket. “No it didn’t,” he said, more to himself than to us. “That was the one thing that made me think, well, this may be the shadow of a beginning. That jury took a few hours.
<name>Jody</name>	Jody	Jem	[MASK] was scowling. It was probably a part of the stage he was going through, and I wished he would hurry up and get through it. He was certainly never cruel to animals, but I had never known his charity to embrace the insect world.
<name>Ghost</name>	Ghost	Angel	“Sometimes they stretch all the way across the road, but if you hafta go through one you say, ‘[MASK]-bright, life-in-death; get off the road, don’t suck my breath.’
<name>Grandfather</name>	Grandfather	Atticus	When I was very small, and if I had been very good during the day, [MASK] would let me pump its bellows while he picked out a tune with one finger. The last note would linger as long as there was air to sustain it.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Atticus	“But [MASK]—” “Besides, I don’t think the children’ve suffered one bit from her having brought them up. If anything, she’s been harder on them in some ways than a mother would have been...
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Calpumia	I was wearing my pink Sunday dress, shoes, and a petticoat, and reflected that if I spilled anything [MASK] would have to wash my dress again for tomorrow. This had been a busy day for her. I decided to stay out. “Can I help you.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jem	She had trusted [MASK] for years, but that night she invaded his privacy and provoked an outburst: “Can’t anybody take a bath in this house without the whole family lookin’?” Next morning she began earlier than usual, to “go over our clothes.”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Dill	That we would be obliged to dodge the unseen from all directions was confirmed when [MASK] ahead of us spelled G-o-d in a whisper. We crept to the side of the house, around to the window with the hanging shutter.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Scout	I must have slept a long time, for when I was punched awake the room was dim with the light of the setting moon. “Move over, [MASK].” “He thought he had to,” I mumbled. “Don’t stay mad with him.”
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Jem	“No sir,” said [MASK], “but she’s so nasty. She has fits or somethin’. She spits a lot.” “She can’t help that. When people are sick they don’t look nice sometimes.” “She scared me,” I said.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Atticus	“Gettin’ on toward eight.” I looked down and saw [MASK] strolling around with his hands in his pockets: he made a tour of the windows, then walked by the railing over to the jury box.
<name>Gene</name>	Gene	Jem’d	“I never thought [MASK] be the one to lose his head over this—thought I’d have more trouble with you.” I said I didn’t see why we had to keep our heads anyway, that nobody I knew at school had to keep his head about anything.
<name>Darry</name>	Darry	Atticus	“You tryin’ to tell me what to do?” “Naw, it’s—he’s got a lot on his mind now, without us worrying him.” “Like what?” [MASK] didn’t appear to have anything especially on his mind.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Atticus	“Easy does it, son,” [MASK] would say. “She’s an old lady and she’s ill. You just hold your head high and be a gentleman. Whatever she says to you, it’s your job not to let her make you mad.”
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Maudie	She spoke, and her voice was flat. “I can’t say I approve of everything he does, [MASK], but he’s my brother, and I just want to know when this will ever end.” Her voice rose: “It tears him to pieces.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Jem	“Okay, you might be right,” said [MASK]. “It must be some little kid’s place—hides his things from the bigger folks. You know it’s only when school’s in that we’ve found things.”
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Calpumia	My replies were monosyllabic and he did not press me. Perhaps [MASK] sensed that my day had been a grim one: she let me watch her fix supper. “Shut your eyes and open your mouth and I’ll give you a surprise,” she said.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Dill	He was slowly talking himself to sleep and taking me with him, but in the quietness of his foggy island there rose the faded image of a gray house with sad brown doors. “[MASK]?” “Mm?”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Atticus	Just picked it up. One of the few things I haven’t read,” he said pointedly. “Read it out loud, please, [MASK]. It’s real scary.” “No,” he said. “You’ve had enough scaring for a while.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jem	The moon was setting and the lattice-work shadows were fading into fuzzy nothingness. [MASK]’s white shirt-tail dipped and bobbed like a small ghost dancing. away to escape the coming morning. A faint breeze stirred and cooled the sweat running down my sides.
<name>Darry</name>	Darry	Jem	“It’s just that I can’t think of a way to make him come out without him gettin’ us.” Besides, [MASK] had his little sister to think of. When he said that, I knew he was afraid.
<name>Jem</name>	Jem	Jem	[MASK] hollered. “Bring it with you! Ain’t you got any sense at all?” When I was able to navigate, I ran back to them as fast as my shaking knees would carry me. “Why didn’t you bring it?”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jem	“So you brought that dirty little sister of yours, did you?” was her greeting. [MASK] said quietly, “My sister ain’t dirty and I ain’t scared of you,” although I noticed his knees shaking.
<name>Jem</name>	Jem	Jem	“It’s not for me to say, but I’ll tell you this much. He was one of your Old Sarum friends ...” “One of the Cunninghams?” [MASK] yelped. “One of—I didn’t recognize any of ’em .
<name>Gregor</name>	Gregor	Cal	She’s a faithful member of this family and you’ll simply have to accept things the way they are. Besides, sister, I don’t want you working your head off for us—you’ve no reason to do that. We still need [MASK] as much as we ever did.”
<name>Jem</name>	Jem	Jem	“Fat in the middle and little-bitty arms.” “I’ll make ’em bigger.” [MASK] sloshed water over the mud man and added more dirt. He looked thoughtfully at it for a moment, then he molded a big stomach below the figure’s waistline.
<name>Jem</name>	Jem	Atticus	There was a brown book and some yellow tablets on the solicitor’s table; [MASK]’s was bare. Just inside the railing that divided the spectators from the court, the witnesses sat on cowhide-bottomed chairs. Their backs were to us.
<name>Calpurnia</name>	Calpurnia	Atticus	Cry about the hell white people give colored folks, without even stopping to think that they’re people, too.” “[MASK] says cheatin’ a colored man is ten times worse than cheatin’ a white man,” I muttered.
<name>Hitler</name>	Hitler	Hitler	I did, and he said he could not possibly answer my question because he didn’t know the answer. “But it’s okay to hate [MASK]?” “It is not,” he said. “It’s not okay to hate anybody.”
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Jem	“[MASK], she’s old and ill. You can’t hold her responsible for what she says and does. Of course, I’d rather she’d have said it to me than to either of you, but we can’t always have our ’druthers.”
<name>Boo</name>	Boo	Boo	I never saw him again. Neighbors bring food with death and flowers with sickness and little things in between. [MASK] was our neighbor. He gave us two soap dolls, a broken watch and chain, a pair of good-luck pennies, and our lives.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Mayella	I ducked and it glanced off.” [MASK] had finally seen the light. “You’re becoming suddenly clear on this point. A while ago you couldn’t remember too well, could you?” “I said he hit me.” “All right.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Atticus	“They c’n go loose and rape up the countryside for all of ’em who run this county care,” was one obscure observation we met head on from a skinny gentleman when he passed us. Which reminded me that I had a question to ask [MASK].
