<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Adam	He must be worn out having to die and get no rest because he has to run somebody else’s life.” “[MASK]’s not managing me.” “No. You managing him. Did you ever feel free of him? Ever?”
<name>Malcolm</name>	Malcolm	Julie	And bomb throwers are not selective or known for precision. If anybody doubted their hatred of me and [MASK] all they had to do was notice how the love of children was posted everywhere—pictures of babies and kids were all over the cell walls.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Queen	Obviously [MASK] sewed, knitted, crocheted and made lace. Curtains, slipcovers, cushions, embroidered napkins were elegantly handmade. A quilt on the headboard of an empty bed, whose springs were apparently cooling outside, was pieced in soft colors and, like everything else, cleverly mismatched.
<name>Thalia</name>	Thalia	Bride	Neither saw the doe and her fawn standing among the trees on the other side of the road. The doe watching the pair of humans was as still as the tree she stood next to. The fawn nestled her flank. “Tell me,” said [MASK].
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Bride	And he, knowing all about how childhood cuts festered and never scabbed over, comforted her while hiding the rage he felt at the idea of anyone hurting her. [MASK]’s complicated relationship with her mother and repellent father meant that, like him, she was free of family ties.
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Bride	[MASK], please. <*> A city girl is quickly weary of the cardboard boredom of tiny rural towns. Whatever the weather, iron-bright sunshine or piercing rain, the impression of worn boxes hiding shiftless residents seems to sap the most attentive gaze.
<name>He</name>	He	Booker	She comforted him, strengthened him and validated the unfairness of the censure he was feeling from his family. Wary of another crisis that might eliminate the soulstretching music his father played, which [MASK] counted on to oil and straighten his tangled feelings, he asked his father if he could take trumpet lessons.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Sally	Had she been interested she would have known that that was what caused the dark dimple on his upper lip. She handed [MASK] the amount owed. “Nice, though, and smart for a country boy,” said the repairman. “Country boy?”
<name>He</name>	He	Bride	“So you ran away.” “No I didn’t. She threw me out. Said ‘Get the fuck out.’ So I did.” “Why? Why would she do that?” Why would anybody do that to a child? [MASK] wondered.
<name>Sula</name>	Sula	Adam	I didn’t want to be anywhere near her after that.” “What’d she lie for?” “To get some love—from her mama.” “Lord! What a mess. And you thought about [MASK]— again.
<name>Zodiac</name>	Zodiac	Roland	[MASK]. Clearly an equal-opportunity killer, his victims seemed to be representative of the We Are the World video. The tattoo artist said he thought they were the names of his client’s children, not those of other people.
<name>Penelope</name>	Penelope	Evelyn	Usually the sound of [MASK]’s weaving at the loom soothed her, but this day the click, knock, click, knock of the shuttle and pedal was extremely irritating. Whatever road her thoughts traveled, the possibility of shame waited at the end.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Adam	He didn’t want an outsider judging his family. That was his job. Everything was smooth and almost cheerful at the family gathering until he went upstairs to his old bedroom, the one he once shared with [MASK]. Looking for what, he was not sure.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Brooklyn	That not good enough for her?” This is going nowhere. How can I expect her to understand? I signal the waiter. “Again,” I say and nod toward my empty glass. The waiter lifts his eyebrows and looks at [MASK].
<name>Easy</name>	Easy	Bride	“No money, no television.” “Means no washing machine, no fridge, no bathroom, no money!” “Money get you out of that Jaguar? Money save your ass? ” [MASK] blinked but was smart enough to say nothing.
<name>Jericho</name>	Jericho	Booker	[MASK] wiped more blood from the side of his face. “Look. Well, see. My brother, he was murdered by a freak, a predator like the one I thought you were forgiving and—” “I don’t care! I didn’t do it!
<name>Callie</name>	Callie	Rain	The berries were bitter, not the wild sweet stuff she expected. “She wouldn’t let me back in. IOI I kept pounding on the door. She opened it once to throw me my sweater.” [MASK] spit the last bit of blueberry into the dirt.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Brooklyn	Today is Monday or is it Tuesday? Anyway, I’ve been in and out of bed for two days. I’ve stopped worrying about my earlobes; I can always get them pierced again. [MASK] telephones and keeps me up to date on office matters.
<name>Prim</name>	Prim	Bride	“I guess. I don’t really know. She never said and I doubt she knows. Her baby teeth were gone when we took her. And so far she has never had a period and her chest is flat as a skateboard.” [MASK] shot up.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Booker	His parents even drove me to the train stop, probably so I wouldn’t have to put up with his failed racist joke on them. I was relieved, even knowing what the mother did with my used teacup. Such was the landscape of men. Then him. [MASK].
<name>Sharon</name>	Sharon	Brooklyn	I lie around all day with nothing urgent to do. [MASK] has taken care of explanations to the office staff: attempted rape, foiled, blah, blah. She is a true friend and doesn’t annoy me like those fake ones who come here just to gaze and pity me.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Steve	Today her car came back with a busted-up door of another color. Before she left she gave me a shaving brush. [MASK] has a beard and doesn’t want it so I use it to brush my cat’s fur. I feel sad now she’s gone.
<name>Usher</name>	Usher	Jeri	Everywhere I went I got double takes but not like the faintly disgusted ones I used to get as a kid. These were adoring looks, stunned but hungry. Plus, unbeknownst to him, [MASK] had given me the name for a product line. YOU, GIRL.
<name>Lucinda</name>	Lucinda	Satan	Exactly the one my mother always talked about— seductive but evil. As soon as I threw her out and got rid of her [MASK]’s disguise, I curled up into a ball on the bed and waited for the police. Waited and waited. None came.
<name>Gerda</name>	Gerda	Queen	His thoughts were stark, skeletal. It never occurred to him that [MASK] would die or even could die. Much of the time, while he tended her feet and listened to her breath he was thinking about his own unease.
<name>They</name>	They	Shock	It reminded her of the reception she got on the first days of school. [MASK], as though she had three eyes. “May I have a white omelet, no cheese?” “White? You mean no eggs?” “No. No yolks.”
<name>Shug</name>	Shug	Mommy	I beat up that black girl who testified against me. Beating her, kicking and punching her freed me up more than being paroled. I felt I was ripping blue-and-white wallpaper, returning slaps and running the devil [MASK] knew so well out of my life.
<name>Brad</name>	Brad	Joey	He’s a lawyer at—” “I’m dating this fabulous film producer—” “[MASK] is CFO at—” “My boyfriend got a part in that TV show—” I shouldn’t have—trusted him, I mean.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Bride	She was laughing, her shoulders rocking. “So many men and all of them the same where it counts.” “Where does it count?” “Ownership.” All those husbands and still all alone, thought [MASK]. “Don’t you have any kids?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Steve	“Really?” “[MASK] and I looked at each other and without talking we decided what to do—get her dry, cleaned and fed, then try to find out where she belonged.” “You said she was about six when you found her?”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Regis	My black lady didn’t turn around but I stuck out my tongue and thumbed my nose at him. One of them was [MASK], a boy I know because he comes to our house sometimes with his father to give us firewood or baskets of corn.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Evelyn	An open door to the rear revealed a room where two beds, one of rope, another of iron, stood. Something meaty, like chicken, roasted in the oven while [MASK] and the girl chopped mushrooms and green peppers at the rough home-made table.
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Booker	“I don’t know,” answered [MASK]. “It was perfect for a while, the two of us.” “What caused the split?” “Lies. Silence. Just not saying what was true or why.” “About?”
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Felicity	but it didn’t last. By the end of summer the relationship with [MASK] had frayed beyond any stitched-up remedy. They had enjoyed being roommate lovers the whole summer before each began to annoy the other with habits they had not previously paid close attention to.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Rain	[MASK] said she didn’t need reminding because once when some really old guy hurt her so bad she bled, her mother slapped him and screamed, “Get out!” then she douched her with a yellow powder.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Steve	I don’t have a daddy, I mean I don’t know who he is because he didn’t live in my mother’s house but [MASK] is always here unless he’s doing some day work somewhere. My black lady is nice but tough too.
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Evelyn	“I’d like to take a bath, please,” she said. “We don’t have a bathroom,” said [MASK]. “I can sponge you for now. When your ankle is ready, I’ll heat water for the washtub.”
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Adam	Each time he imagined her eyes glittering toward him or her lips open in an inviting, reckless smile, he felt not just a swell of desire but also the disintegration of the haunt and gloom in which for years [MASK]’s death had clouded him.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Bride	I ran away, too, [MASK], but I was fourteen and there was nobody but me to take care of me so I invented myself, toughened myself. I thought you did too except when it came to boyfriends.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Booker	But I see them.” She waved to the photographs gazing out from exquisite frames. “And I know how and what they think. [MASK] always stayed in touch with me, though. Here, I’ll show you how and what he thinks.”
<name>She</name>	She	Bride	Just as she turned the ignition key to the withering sound of a dead battery a man appeared. Bearded with long blond hair and slit black eyes. Rape? Murder? [MASK] trembled, watching him squint at her through the window. Then he left.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Booker	[MASK] was three when they let him know he was a twin to the one who did not survive birth, but somehow he’d always known it—felt the warm void walking by his side, or waiting on the porch steps while he played in the yard.
<name>Ronnie</name>	Ronnie	Booker	Nothing! Now I want that word. Whatever it is I want to hear it. Now!” [MASK], wiping blood from the left side of his face with his right hand, snarled, “I don’t have to tell you shit.”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Bride	Three miles on, [MASK] left the highway and turned in to the oasis. The diner she chose was spotless and empty. The smell of beer and tobacco was not recent, nor was the framed Confederate flag that nestled the official American one. “Yeah?”
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Liar	[MASK]. She liked the sex. Addicted to it and believe me I know. When the three of us were together she was different somehow. Confident, not so needy or constantly, obviously soliciting praise. In his company she shimmered, but quietly kind of.
<name>Waldo</name>	Waldo	Booker	You said he sent some writings.” “Uh-huh. He did. Every now and then.” “What were they about?” “Beats me. I’ll show you some, if you like. Say, why you looking for [MASK]?
<name>Alaska</name>	Alaska	Bride	“Everything is about you except the whole world and the universe it floats in.” “Would you stop making fun of me? You know what I mean. You wrote them when we were together, right?” “They’re just thoughts, [MASK].
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Julie	Somehow I survived those fifteen years. Had it not been for weekend basketball games and [MASK], my cellmate and only friend, I wonder if I would have made it. For the first two years we two, sentenced for child abuse, were avoided in the cafeteria.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Sofia	[MASK] stares at the display as though the items might be infected. “What’s all that for?” I wonder if prison has done something to her brain. “It’s okay,” I say. “Just a few things to help you.”
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Regis	My black lady saw him and threw her arm in front of my face. The birdshot messed up her hand and arm. We fell, both of us, her on top of me. I saw [MASK] duck down as the truck gunned its engine and shot off.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Bride	“It took a while to get the whole story,” she said. [MASK] listened intently. Anything. Anything to stop thinking first about how her body was changing and second how to make sure no one noticed.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Queen	“Some ‘dustup.’ She came all this way to beat you up? For what? Love or misery?” “Both, probably.” “Well, let’s get her out of that chair and on the bed,” said [MASK].
<name>John</name>	John	Bald	[MASK]. Normal-looking. Probably an otherwise nice man—they always were. The “nicest man in the world,” the neighbors always said. “He wouldn’t hurt a fly.” Where did that cliche come from? Why not hurt a fly?
<name>Al</name>	Al	Bride	“What about it?” “Just asking, [MASK]. Breakfast conversation, you know?” “I don’t know about my job and don’t care. I’ll get another one.” “Oh, yeah?” “Yeah. And you?
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Bride	I was trying to make up to someone I ruined. You just ran around blaming everybody. You bastard. Here, wipe your bloody hand.” [MASK] threw a dish towel toward him and put down what was left of the bottle.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sweetness	So when I told [MASK] what I’d seen, she was furious. Not about a little crying boy, but about spreading the story. She wasn’t interested in tiny fists or big hairy thighs; she was interested in keeping our apartment.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Bride	“That figures,” said the woman. “I get a lot of his mail— magazines, catalogs, stuff he writes himself.” “Is he here?” [MASK] was dazzled by the woman’s earrings, golden discs the size of clamshells.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Brooklyn	I splash water and rinse my face. The satisfaction that follows is so so sweet. This working from home isn’t as bad as I thought it would be. I have authority still, although [MASK] second-guesses me, even overrides a few of my decisions.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Bride	“No, but when the rain let up and we left the diner, I spotted her hunched up next to a Dumpster in the alley behind the building.” “Jesus,” said [MASK], shuddering as though it were she herself in that alley.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bride	“I don’t know,” said [MASK]. That answer seemed to please. She jumped up smiling and brushing her shorts. “Okay, if you wanna.” The quiet between them was easy at first as each appeared to be deep in her own thoughts.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Bride	Carefully the man eased [MASK]’s foot from under the brake pedal and away from the car’s smashed door. His hair hung forward as he lifted her out of the car seat. Silently, asking no questions and offering no verbal comfort, he positioned her in his arms.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Bride	Sleeping in a house of such deep darkness at night felt to [MASK] like being in a coffin. Outside the sky would be loaded with more stars than she had ever seen before. But in here under a filthy skylight and no electricity she had a problem sleeping.
<name>“Since then,”</name>	“Since then,”	borry	“Well, don’t worry about me.” “But I do.” “Since when?” “Since you broke a beer bottle over my head.” [MASK]. “No kidding. Me too.” They chuckled.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Sally	Exhausted, finally, by their mutual amusement, they turned their attention back to the customer. “Look here,” said [MASK]. “He gave us another address. A forward.” He flipped through his Rolodex. “Ha.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Bride	After being carried back to the house, [MASK] found that her earlier hunger had dissipated as the awareness of being unwashed and soursmelling overwhelmed her. “I’d like to take a bath, please,” she said.
<name>Sparky</name>	Sparky	Boy	The single other thing people remembered most about him was that he always traveled with a cute little dog in his van, a terrier he called “[MASK].” The police withheld what details they could but the families of the murdered boys could not be stopped or silenced.
<name>Yardman</name>	Yardman	Jeri	“See?” said [MASK]. “Black sells. It’s the hottest commodity in the civilized world. White girls, even brown girls have to strip naked to get that kind of attention.” True or not, it made me, remade me.
<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Queen	Get a place where all three were together? A big mobile home? At least until [MASK] could take care of herself, without delving too closely, they assumed the three of them would live together. Slowly, slowly their bright plans for the immediate future darkened.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Jeri	I’ve lost my pearl dots, so I choose one-carat diamonds. Modest, nothing flashy, nothing to detract from what [MASK] calls my black-coffee-and-whipped-cream palette. A panther in snow. Christ. Now what? My earrings.
<name>John</name>	John	Evelyn	“Because I didn’t ask them to take me and they didn’t ask if I wanted to go.” ioo “Then why did you ? ” “I was wet, freezing too. [MASK] gave me a blanket and a box of raisins to eat.”
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Rain	“Because I bit him.” “Bit who?” “Some guy. A regular. One of the ones she let do it to me. Oh, look. Blueberries!” [MASK] was searching through roadside bushes.
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Sweetness	After searching the refrigerator for something to nibble on, I decide to examine the pile—toss out the pleas for money from every charity in the world, the promises of gifts from banks, stores and failing businesses. There are just two first-class letters. One is from [MASK].
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Bride	You should ta\e heartbreak of whatever hind seriously with the courage to let it blaze and burn like the pulsing star it is unable or unwilling to be soothed into pathetic self-blame because its explosive brilliance rings justifiably loud like the din of a tympani. [MASK] put the papers down and covered her eyes.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Brooklyn	Wasn’t she worth something? Anything? She missed [MASK] whom she thought of as her only true friend: loyal, funny, generous. Who else would drive miles to find her after that bloody horror at a cheap motel then take such good care of her?
<name>Stacy</name>	Stacy	Brooklyn	The sample gift bags are in and the ad guys have several really cool ideas for .. She rattles on until I stop her. “Look, I’ll call you later. I’m a bit hung over.” “No kidding.” [MASK] giggles.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Brooklyn	Too much light, too much space, too lonely. I have to put on some clothes and get out of here. Do what [MASK] keeps nagging me about: forget sunglasses and floppy hats, show myself, live life like it really is life.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Booker	The trial itself was not long but the preliminaries seemed eternal to [MASK]. Throughout the days of newspaper headlines, talk radio and neighborhood gossip he struggled to find some way to freeze and individualize his feelings, to separate them from the sorrow and frenzied anger of other families.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Felicity	The three-person fight was more hilarious than lethal, but it was long enough and loud enough to get the attention first of shoppers, then the police. All three were arrested and the little screaming girl given to childcare services. [MASK] had to pay the fine.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Bride	It’s not my fault. It’s not my fault. It’s not. [MASK] I’m scared. Something bad is happening to me. I feel like I’m melting away. I can’t explain it to you but I do know when it started.
<name>Sula</name>	Sula	Bride	[MASK] ignored the dumbstruck children. She knew well what it was to walk into a room and see the exchange of looks between white strangers. The looks were dismissi-ble because, most often, the gasps her blackness provoked were invariably followed by the envy her beauty produced.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Adam	He couldn’t hide the pleasure in his eyes. “I guess good isn’t good enough for you, so you called [MASK] back and made his murder turn your brain into a cadaver and your heart’s blood formaldehyde.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Booker	Questions about personal problems prompted solutions from anyone at the table, and after they were solved or left pending, the children were sent to bathe and dress—the older ones helping the younger. [MASK] loved those Saturday morning conferences rewarded by the highlight of the weekend—his mother’s huge breakfast feasts.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Brooklyn	and I thought she probably has no friends.” “Poor thing. No kiddies to rape in the joint. What a drag.” “You’re not hearing me.” “Damn straight I’m not listening to you.” [MASK] slaps the table.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Queen	Come on, love, come on, come on, lady.” [MASK] was breathing— at least coughing and spitting, major signs of life. As the ambulance parked, the crowd became bigger and some of the onlookers seemed transfixed—but not at the moaning patient being trundled into the ambulance.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Bride	[MASK] probably knows more about love than I do. At least she’s willing to figure it out, do something, risk something and take its measure. I risk nothing. I sit on a throne and identify signs of imperfection in others.
<name>Mayella</name>	Mayella	Sweetness	I glanced at [MASK]; she was smiling like I’ve never seen her smile before—with mouth and eyes. And that wasn’t all. Outside the courtroom all the mothers smiled at me, and two actually touched and hugged me.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Bride	You’ll make it before dark.” Is that what backwoods trash called “not far”? wondered [MASK]. One hundred and fifty miles? She gassed up, had the tires checked and followed the loop away from the oasis back onto the highway.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Bride	She didn’t say so, but it suddenly occurred to her that good sex was not knowledge. It was barely information. [MASK] touched the napkin to her lips again. “We were living together, then he dumped me. Just like that.”
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Bride	Once the driver stopped at the address she’d given him, and after he told her, “Sorry, lady. I can’t wait here for you,” [MASK] stepped quickly toward the door of Salvatore Pon-ti’s Pawn and Repair Palace.
<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Bride	I really could have. I probably shouldn’t have come on so sudden. Maybe if I had eased up a bit, slowed down. Taken it easy. Well, anyway, [MASK] doesn’t know a thing about her used-to-be lover.
<name>Miss O'Shaughnessy</name>	Miss O'Shaughnessy	Sweetness	And I was good at it. I behaved and behaved and behaved. Frightened as I was to appear in court, I did what the teacher-psychologists expected of me. Brilliantly, I know, because after the trial [MASK] was kind of motherlike.
<name>Margo</name>	Margo	Grace	“I’m ruined,” she whispers. I say, “No you’re not. Give it time. Remember what [MASK] looked like after her face tuck?” “A surgeon did her face,” she answers. “A maniac did mine.”
<name>Yoko</name>	Yoko	Queen	“More?” “No thanks, but it was delicious. I don’t remember eating anything that good.” [MASK] smiled. “It’s my United Nations recipe from the food of all my husbands’ hometowns.
<name>Frances</name>	Frances	Sweetness	Best of all was [MASK]. As we walked down the courthouse steps she held my hand, my hand. She never did that before and it surprised me as much as it pleased me because I always knew she didn’t like touching me. I could tell.
<name>Difficult</name>	Difficult	Adam	Just not saying what was true or why.” “About?” “About us as kids, things that happened, why we did things, thought things, took actions that were really about what went on when we were just children.” “[MASK] for you?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bride	I know she abandoned some of them to marry other men. Lots of other men. And she didn’t or couldn’t take the kids with her. Their fathers made sure of that.” “I think she loves them though,” said [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Rain	“Oh, no. Never. This is the best place. Besides there’s no place else to go.” [MASK] yawned and rubbed her nose. “You mean you don’t have a home?” “I used to but my mother lives there.”
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Queen	She thrashed a bit then held her arms raised high, her fingers clawing, reaching over and over for the rungs of a ladder that only she could see. Then all of it stopped. Twelve hours later [MASK] was dead.
<name>God</name>	God	Booker	God damn, he whispered. Their lovemaking from the very beginning was serene, artful and long-lasting, so necessary to [MASK] that he deliberately withheld for nights in a row to make the return to her bed brand-new. Their relationship was flawless.
<name>Effi</name>	Effi	Bride	Whatever the case, [MASK] would track him, force him to explain why she didn’t deserve better treatment from him, and second, what did he mean by “not the woman”? Who? This here woman?
