<name>Lev</name>	Lev	Sondelius	[MASK] ignored him. “Did you see that girl going by? What ankles! What shoulders! Is it good beer at the beer-garden? Have they any decent cognac? Do you know Cour-voisier 1865 cognac? Oof! Lecturing!
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Madeline	Probably they go off and laugh at me!” “They do not! If they did— I’d like to see anybody that tried laughing—” “It’s awfully sweet and dear of you, but I’m not worth it. The poetic [MASK]!
<name>Pater</name>	Pater	Pater	I shall now inoculate the second guinea pig, and the class will be dismissed. Before the next lab hour I shall be glad if you will read [MASK]’s ‘Marius the Epicurean,’ to derife from it the calmness which is the secret of laboratory skill.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Doc	Don’t smoke or booze or anything?” “Absolutely! And look at their perfect health.” “Hm. Better keep an eye on ’em. I won’t spoil your show, [MASK]—we fellows at City Hall had all ought to stick together.
<name>Doc</name>	Doc	Martin	Fine kid. Is he a goner?” the lieutenant begged. [MASK] knelt by the man, felt his pulse, listened to his breathing. Brusquely opening a black bag, he gave him a hypo- dermic of strychnin and held a vial of ammonia to his nose.
<name>himself</name>	himself	Leora	The man meant so much that he could be furious with him as he would have been with [MASK], with his own self. “I’m sorry you think I don’t know anything,” he raged, and departed with the finest dramatic violence.
<name>Muriel</name>	Muriel	Pickerbaugh	He was restless. He threw down his magazine. He demanded: “What’re you going to wear at [MASK]’s snow-picnic to-morrow?” “Oh, I haven’t— I’ll find something.”
<name>Fifty-seven</name>	Fifty-seven	Angus	He had said to [MASK], he had heard nurses say one to another, quite cheerfully, “Well, fifty-seven has just passed out.” Now he raged with desire to do the impossible. She couldn’t be dead.
<name>Antoine</name>	Antoine	Martin	Of course I understand why girls fall for [MASK] here, with his romantic eyes, but a grind like me, I have to go on working without a single person to give me sympathy. Oh, well, I deserve it for being shy of women.”
<name>Frances</name>	Frances	Angus	“Now that’s just what I mean. That kind of phrase. ‘Pull the bunk’! Horrible! “Hell! I’ll use any kind of phrase I want to! I’m not one of your social climbers like [MASK].
<name>John</name>	John	Martin	She was bewildered; she was lonely; she dared not start on her long journey without his hand to comfort her. She listened for him—listened—tense with listening. “You will come! I know you’ll come and help me! I know. You’ll come! [MASK]!
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Pickerbaugh	I meant to orate a lot, but all I can say is—I love you all, I’m mighty grateful. I’ll represent you my level best, neighbors! God bless you!” The train moved out, [MASK] waving as long as he could see them.
<name>Roderick</name>	Roderick	Robert	Among his economies was the reduction of his son’s allowance. [MASK] was a square-rigged, swart, tempestuous boy, arrogant where there seemed to be no reason for arrogance, longed for by the anemic, milky sort of girls, yet ever supercilious to them.
<name>James</name>	James	Leora	There had been, he felt, a rush of admiring patients sufficient to justify them in the one thing [MASK] and he longed to do, the thing about which they whispered at night: the purchase of a motor car for his country calls.
<name>Snell</name>	Snell	Wise	It was lined with pine, pleasant-smelling under the stench of old pipe-smoke. [MASK] winked—he was a confidential, untrustworthy wisp of a man—and murmured, “Think you could stand a little jolt of first-class Kentucky bourbon?”
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Gottlieb	[MASK] was on his feet, a lean fury. “Because you all haf schoolboy minds, golf-links minds, you are twisting my expression, and perfectly accurate expression, of a sound revolutionary ideal, which would personally to me be of no value or advantage whatefer, into a desire to steal promotions.
<name>Wells</name>	Wells	Terry	What I ought to do is to go to Birdies’ Rest right now, and work with [MASK].” “I wish I had some way of showing you— Oh, for a ‘scientist’ you do have the most incredible blind-spots!
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Leora	No good. And I’m hanged if I’ll study calculus this evening. Let’s go to the movies. Won’t even change to regular human clothes. Too tired.” “All right honey,” said [MASK]. “But let’s have dinner here.
<name>Galvani</name>	Galvani	Gottlieb	No X Principle appeared in any of the new boils, and sadly he went to [MASK]. The old man meditated, asked a question or two, sat hunched in his cushioned chair, and demanded: “What kind of a carbuncle was the original one?”
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Madeline	You’ve got a dirty mind. I’m not worthy to touch [MASK]’s hand. I regard her with nothing but respect.” “The hell you do! But never mind, if you say so. Gosh, wish there was something I could do for you.
<name>Elmer</name>	Elmer	Martin	Through the prayer [MASK] sat with his forehead in his hand, feeling foolish, and raving, “I guess this is the proper attitude—they’re all gawping at me—gosh, won’t he ever quit?—oh, damn it, now what was that point
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Martin	Are you in the U. medic school?” To a passing nurse, the two youngsters would have seemed absorbed in hospital business. [MASK] stood at the door, she by her scrubbing pail. She had reassumed her turban; its bagginess obscured her bright hair.
<name>Milly</name>	Milly	Leora	If you get ’em, you become pompous, and then when you’re used to ’em, if you lose ’em you feel foolish. “So I’m not going to be rich. [MASK], poor kid, she won’t have her new dresses and flat and everything.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Martin	My God, am I to spend my life with Dummkdpfe'! I cannot be always alone, [MASK]! Are you going to fail me? Two, three days now you haf not been keen about work.”
<name>Buttercup</name>	Buttercup	Leora	“What’s the matter with [MASK]? It’s fine.” Sound of mating birds, sound of spring blossoms dropping in the tranquil air, the bark of sleepy dogs at midnight; who is to set them down and make them anything but hackneyed?
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Joyce	Desperately, “[MASK], I do love you. I want awfully, just now, to kiss you properly. But I will not have you bringing a lot of people—and there’d probably be a rotten noisy motor launch. Make our lab a joke.
<name>Ann</name>	Ann	Martin	[MASK] was glad that she did not add to his qualms by worrying. Then, after three days, she spoke: “I’m going with you.” “You are not!” “Well. ... I am!” “It’s not safe.”
<name>Arrowsmith</name>	Arrowsmith	Gottlieb	[MASK] spoke nervously: “I do not approve of patenting serological processes. They should be open to all laboratories. And I am strongly against premature production or even announcement. I think I am right, but I must check my technique, perhaps improve it—be sure.
<name>Max</name>	Max	Gottlieb	He played in the laboratory; he spent his time polishing glassware, and when he transplanted cultures from his rabbits, his notes were incomplete. [MASK] was instantly grim. “ Wassgiebt es dann? Do you call these notes? Always when I praise a man must he stop working?
<name>Rivers</name>	Rivers	Holabird	They decided to work with the pneumococcus, and with the animal which should most nearly reproduce human pneumonia. This meant the monkey, and to murder monkeys is expensive and rather grim. [MASK], as Director, could supply them, but if they took him into confidence he would demand immediate results.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Gottlieb	he said cordially. But his eyes said, “Why have you never come back to me?” The boy stammered something, nothing, and when [MASK] had gone by, stooped and moving as in pain, he longed to run after him.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sandy	He muttered, while the steamer whistled, “Quick! You can still go back! You must!” “And leave the pretty launch? Why, [MASK]! Just look at the elegant engine it’s got! . . . Gosh, I’m scared blue!”
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Martin	Still good. Only one drink. If he came into the consultation-room at once, he would be safe. But he was still standing in the bedroom. [MASK] sighed as the washstand doors were hastily opened again, as he heard another gurgle and a third.
<name>Asimov</name>	Asimov	Gottlieb	All strength went out of him and all purpose, and the light of creation faded to dirty gray. “Now of course,” said [MASK], “you could claim to be co-discoverer and spend the rest of your life fighting to get recognized.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Lord	I was going to make about fumigation?—oh. [MASK], he’s winding up and I’ve got to shoot!” Somehow, he was standing by the reading-desk, holding it for support, and his voice seemed to be going on, producing reasonable words.
<name>anecdotes</name>	anecdotes	G.U.	He and his roommates had trustingly bought it from a salesman who came out from a Zenith surgical supply house. He was such a genial and sympathetic salesman; he gave them cigars and told [MASK] stories and explained what prosperous doctors they were all going to be.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Leora	and she look awful and— Could you come right away?” “You bet. Be right there.” Four miles—he would do it in eight minutes. He dressed swiftly, dragging his worn brown tie together, while [MASK] beamed over the first night call.
<name>Wicksteed</name>	Wicksteed	Tredgold	But mind you, [MASK], it’s partly the fault of people like your Manufacturers’ Association. You encourage him to rant. I’m a laboratory man—or rather, I sometimes wish I were. I like to deal with exact figures.”
<name>Alida</name>	Alida	Leora	“I can’t go round singing Healthette Octette Pantalette stuff. Even if it did instruct people, which it don’t. Be almost better to let ’em die than have to live and listen to— “[MASK] said I was a ‘backwoods hick.’
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Leora	“And I might have saved all of them, with phage,” he whispered to himself. His forehead was cold, yet it was greasy with sweat as he babbled to the manageress of rooms and meals, as he prayed that [MASK] might not have seen the Things in that slow creaking wagon.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Angus	Probably I’ll always be jealous. It’s you that have got to trust me. I’m not easy-going; never will be. Oh, trust me—” Their profound and unresisted kiss was the more blind in memory of that barren hour with [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Leora	If [MASK] enjoys it— Me personally, I don’t care two hoots for all this trotting around— Though of course it isn’t so bad to see pretty women in fine clothes, and be dressed as good as anybody— Oh, I don’t know!”
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Bert	[MASK] had been reading fiction. “I object to the use of profanity, but when you come and annoy My Sister a second time, all I can say is, by God, sir, this is too blame much!”
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Orchid	[MASK] sold three hundred and nineteen Y. tags, seven of them to the same man, who afterward made improper remarks to her. She was rescued by a Y.M.C.A. secretary, who for a considerable time held her hand to calm her.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Arrowsmith	Now Stokes of St. Swithin’s was a reticent man and hard, but when they had the last bag up-stairs, he leaned his head against a door, cried “My God, [MASK], I’m so glad you’ve got here,” and broke from them, running. . . .
<name>Waldo</name>	Waldo	Clumsy	“You will stand anything I say! [MASK]! You can take your hat and get out!” “You mean I’m fired as assistant?” “I am glad you haf enough intelligence to understand that, no matter how wretchet I talk!”
<name>Josephine</name>	Josephine	Madeline	I couldn’t help it. I’m engaged to both of you, and I want to know—” [MASK] had sprung up. She had never looked quite so proud and fine. She stared at them, and walked away, wordless.
<name>Arrowsmith</name>	Arrowsmith	Lord	Some day I’ll discover the germ of cancer or something, and then he’ll look foolish in the face! . . . Oh, [MASK], I hope I won’t take sick, first time I go into the dissecting-room. ...
<name>Whitman</name>	Whitman	Terry	[MASK] was rough, he was surly, he was colloquial, he despised many fine and gracious things, he offended many fine and gracious people, but these acerbities made up the haircloth robe wherewith he defended a devotion to such holy work as no cowled monk ever knew.
<name>Una</name>	Una	Orchid	The twins broke test-tubes, and made doll tents out of filter paper. [MASK] lettered the special posters for her father’s Weeks, and the laboratory, she said, was the quietest place in which to work.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Martin	[MASK] yelped the last words from the step at the back of the ambulance as it went bumping and rocking through the factory yard, through the bitter smoke, toward the shrinking crowd. He owned and commanded the city, he and the driver.
<name>He</name>	He	Bissex	The wise banker observed, “You haven’t got anything to take into the courts till they discharge you without cause. [MASK] has a legal right to reduce your salary all he wants to. The city regulations don’t fix the salary for anybody except the Director and the inspectors.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Martin	The old man looked as though he half understood; he peered at him, then shook his head and whimpered, “Versteh ’ nicht. ” His arrogant eyes were clouded with ungovernable slow tears. [MASK] understood that never could he be punished now and cleansed.
<name>David</name>	David	Clif	But these admirable truths did not keep the operation from hurting any more than it would have eased the removal of an appendix to be told that it was a bad appendix, an appendix without delicacy or value. He had loved [MASK]—did love him and always would.
<name>Carol</name>	Carol	Martin	I find that a good many of these farmers think a lot harder and squarer than the swells I meet in the city. Well! I don’t see any reason for feeling superior, or lonely either!” “Hell, I don’t!” [MASK] mumbled.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Leora	He’s such a nice man, and not just a good surgeon but frightfully talented. He sings won-derfully, and he comes from the most frightfully nice family.” “No, I don’t think I’ve met him yet,” [MASK] bleated.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Martin	Before him, supreme joy of the investigator, new mountain-passes of work opened, and in him was new power. 11 For a week [MASK]’s life had all the regularity of an escaped soldier in the enemy’s country, with the same agitation and the same desire to prowl at night.
<name>somebody</name>	somebody	Madeline	“Look here, old socks. If you’ve gotten in debt, I’ll raise the cash, somehow. If it’s— Been going a little too far with [MASK]?” “You make me sick! You’ve got a dirty mind.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Leora	Oh, let’s go back and do some more calculus. . . . Darling, my working nights doesn’t bore you too much, does it?” [MASK] had cunning. When she could not be enthusiastic, she could be unannoyingly silent.
<name>Arrowsmith</name>	Arrowsmith	Sondelius	The carpenter created communistic states, while [MASK], proclaiming that he did not care whether he worked under socialism or an emperor so long as he could bully people into being well, annihilated tuberculosis and by dawn had cancer fleeing.
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	Martin	Glad to see you’re settling down to business.” [MASK] was slightly cocky, and immediately bounded after a fine new epidemic. He was so fortunate as to have a case of small-pox and several which he suspected.
<name>Arrowsmith</name>	Arrowsmith	Holabird	ii They faced [MASK] in his office, sulkily, rather childishly, and they demanded the expenditure of at least ten thousand dollars for monkeys. They wished to start a research which might take two years without apparent results—possibly without any results.
<name>Doc</name>	Doc	Doc	“He’ll come around. Here, you two, getum into the ambulance—husde!” The police sergeant and the newest probationer patrolman sprang together, and together they mumbled, “All right, [MASK].”
<name>George</name>	George	Clif	And, “Oh, maybe it didn’t cost something to furnish this dining-room, oh, not a-tall!” And, “Champagne, heh? Well, you’re certainly doing poor old [MASK] proud.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Slim	I haven’t got a single thing to kick about! [MASK], where’s the catch? You can bet there is one—there always is!” In a year of divine work, the catch did not appear.
<name>Mad</name>	Mad	Leora	She sounded so frightened that his anger at her reflections on [MASK] turned into misery. Incidentally, her thumb was gouging painfully into the back of his hand. He tried to look tender as he protested, “Sure—sure—gosh, honest, Mad, look out.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Clif	“Well, gosh, if you feel that way about it—!” [MASK] was peering over the fatty pads beneath his eyes. He sounded doubtful: “I suppose you have the right to keep other guys from grabbing your own stuff. Well, all right.
<name>Elmer</name>	Elmer	Martin	Together they pointed out that for a person who felt his Zenith training had made him so “gosh-awful’ smart that he sticks up his nose at us poor hicks of dirt-farmers,” [MASK]’s scarf was rather badly tied.
<name>Leavitt</name>	Leavitt	Holabird	Then he had his idea. He began firmly to believe that the Rockefeller investigators had found the cause of flu. He gushed in to [MASK] and told him so. As for himself, he was going back to his search for the real nature of phage.
<name>Snuffy</name>	Snuffy	Martin	You can take your hat and get out!” “You mean I’m fired as assistant?” “I am glad you haf enough intelligence to understand that, no matter how wretchet I talk!” [MASK] flung away.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Martin	“Stay with us as long as you like. Only, in the interests of economy, I reduce your salary to eight hundred dollars a year!” “All right, reduce and be damned,” said [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Leora	I’ll promise to be good. I won’t have any little bellyaches or T.B. or anything, so please don’t lecture me!” Even in his irritability he was gentle, for [MASK] was with child. v Their baby was coming in five months.
<name>Mr. Ramsay</name>	Mr. Ramsay	Pickerbaugh	[MASK] had a way of pressing his thumb into the back of your hand which was extraordinarily cordial and painful. He immediately drowned out even his daughters by an oration on the Home Nest: “Here you’ve got an illustration of Health in the Home.
<name>Leora</name>	Leora	Gottlieb	There’s something wrong with the theories.” “Young man, do you set yourself up against science?” grated [MASK], flapping the papers on his desk. “Do you feel competent, huh, to attack the dogmas of immunology?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Leora	[MASK]! Come on! Here we are!” The veranda, as he ran up on it, was leaf-scattered and dusty, and the front door was banging. His voice echoed in a desperate silence. He was uneasy.
<name>Weyburn</name>	Weyburn	Woestijne	He did not make them understand his mission; he scarce tried to make them understand. His authority, as [MASK]’s alter ego, was imposing on paper but feeble in action, and it was worthless against the stubbornness which he aroused.
<name>John</name>	John	Martin	He stood by the window; he seemed to be avoiding [MASK]’s eyes. He sighed, “Something sort of bad—perhaps not altogether bad—has happened.” “What is it, sir? Anything I can do?” “It does not apply to me.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Joyce	[MASK] had wealth and energy. A week later, flushed, slim, gallant, joyous, she said to him after dinner, “I’ve got a surprise for you!” She led him to the unoccupied rooms over the garage, behind their house.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ed	If we could find your Uncle [MASK], I guess he’d take us in.” “Nobody ain’t going to take us in,” she said. “We’re going on jus’ long as we can.
<name>Martin</name>	Martin	Martin	[MASK] saw rooms for sterilizing glass and preparing media, for glass-blowing, for the polariscope and the spectroscope, and a steel-and-cement-walled combustion-chamber. He saw a museum of padiology and bacteriology to which he longed to add.
<name>creature</name>	creature	Madeline	He had known her as a jacketed outdoor girl, but this was an exquisite indoor [MASK], slender in yellow silk. She seemed to him a miracle of tact and ease as she bullied her guests into an appearance of merriment.
<name>Leora</name>	Leora	Leora	... It is strange that excellent bacteriologists and chemists should scramble eggs so waterily, should make such bitter coffee and be so casual about dirty spoons. ... By the time he had finished the mess he was ready to believe that [MASK] had left; him forever.
<name>George</name>	George	Madeline	He had appropriated four dollars for the orgy, strictly including the tip, and his standard of good food was that he must spend every cent of the four dollars. While he wondered what “Puree St. Germain” could be, and the waiter hideously stood watching behind his shoulder, [MASK] fell to.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sandy	It’ll be nice to have you with me in the scrap, because you aren’t supposed to know that he expects to plan out everything for everybody and— Oh, [MASK], I’ve been so lonely for you!
<name>Johnston</name>	Johnston	Martin	I must know about it, not only because I take a very friendly interest in your work but because I am, after all, your Director!” [MASK] felt that his one ewe lamb was being snatched from him but he could see no way to refuse.
<name>Wassermann</name>	Wassermann	Martin	Do you call these notes? Always when I praise a man must he stop working? Do you think that you are a Theobald Smith or a 92 Novy that you should sit and meditate? You have the ability of Pfaffl ” For once, [MASK] was impenitent.
<name>Leora</name>	Leora	Leora	He did not neglect his patients but certainly he failed to appear in the stores, at the poker games. [MASK] and he dined on a sandwich every evening and hastened to the laboratory, to heat the cultures in the improvised water-bath, an ancient and leaky oatmeal-cooker with an alcohol lamp.
<name>Leora</name>	Leora	Martin	There was a fine spirit. You should have known one does not use a platinum loop for shoveling coal.” As long as he could (while [MASK] was dish-washing and wandering on improbable trains between impossible towns), he put off the appointment of a new assistant.
<name>Rockefeller</name>	Rockefeller	Noguchi	They’ve already lessened the terrors of meningitis and pneumonia, and yellow fever is on the verge of complete abolition through [MASK]’s work, and I have no doubt that their hospital, with its enormous resources and splendidly cooperating minds, will be the first to find something to alleviate diabetes.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Gottlieb	There are no set departments, but only units formed about exceptional men like our good friend [MASK]. If any new man has the real right thing, we’ll provide him with every facility, instead of letting him merely plug along doing individual work.
<name>Let's</name>	Let's	Lez	Of course there won’t be any scientific dinners with ladies in candy-box dresses, but I figure we’ll be able to afford plenty of salt pork and corncob pipes, and your bed will be made perfectly—if you make it yourself. Huh? [MASK] go and have a swim.”
<name>McTeague</name>	McTeague	Leora	“I shall never practise medicine again,” he reflected. “I’m through,” he said to [MASK]. “I’m no good. I should of operated. I can’t face people, when they know about it. I’m through.
<name>Josephine</name>	Josephine	Joyce	and even wear them. [MASK] was not only an Arranger—she was a Loyalist. Like most American cosmopolites she revered the English peerage, adopted all their standards and beliefs—or what she considered their standards and beliefs—and treasured her encounters with them.
<name>Doctor</name>	Doctor	Mart	“I’m sure our friend here doesn’t really mean to make charges against you, [MASK]. He’s overwrought, naturally. Can’t we just treat the fellow that has the strep infection and not make everybody uncomfortable?”
<name>McTeague</name>	McTeague	Arrowsmith	I tell you [MASK]’s a medical nihilist and a notoriety-seeker, that’s what he is. You mark my words, instead of his sticking to decent regular practise, you’ll be hearing of his opening a quack sanitarium, one of these days!”
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Martin	It was six months before she had learned enough stenography to obtain a place in an insurance office. Till [MASK] graduated they kept that room, their home, ever dearer. No one was so domestic as these birds of passage.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Leora	If [MASK] could be happy— “I wouldn’t care a hoot if she fell for the gabbiest ftisser in the whole U., and gave me the go-by all evening. Anything to let her have a good time!
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Martin	Of course there can be no question now of a new department.” “Yes,” said [MASK] vacantly. He carefully filed away the beginnings of his paper and turned to his bench. He stared at a shining flask till it fascinated him like a crystal ball.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Martin	[MASK] would not have to help him into bed. But it was a bad sign that the Doc should first go down the hall to his bedroom. The boy listened sharply. He heard the Doc open the lower part of the washstand, where he kept his bottle of Jamaica rum.
<name>George</name>	George	Clif	He had, with blurry cunning, saved most of the hundred dollars he had taken from [MASK]; he had lived—very badly, on grease-swimming stews and soda-reeking bread—by what he earned along the way.
