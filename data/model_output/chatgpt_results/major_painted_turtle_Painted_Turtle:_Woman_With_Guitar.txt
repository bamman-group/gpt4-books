<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Hopis	Having a Navajo father in Hopi land wasn’t exactly a picnic. [MASK] had had nothing but a history of trouble with them Navajos. My mom had trouble with my dad. So it goes. They were still up although it was nine—their bedtime.
<name>Death</name>	Death	Concho	The morning was losing its freshness. Something, not exactly weather, was oppressive out here and it was everywhere in the air. We hadn’t felt any of this coming down. Up ahead was the curve for [MASK]. She asked me to slow down.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Bryce	[MASK] said they had to fill up the wrong hole and dig another hole in the right place. She asked them how far was the wrong hole from the right place. They both showed her by holding up their hands to measure the distance.
<name>Zuni</name>	Zuni	Navajo	She said she was afraid of the old man. She was glad when her mother led her away to help the women and the other girls again. Being part [MASK] and part Hopi myself, I can just imagine the old man Gchachu rapping his staff handle on the table top.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Ruth	I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. She said, Yes, modern. I wanted her to say why. Well, she said, at dinner [MASK] had talked about her political work in the community. She never once mentioned the church.
<name>witch</name>	witch	Atoshle	Seeing smoke the first few times drift up from the chimneys of the adobes was the discovery of a silent and strange presence. Sleeping, as much as the wakeful times, was wonderment. Not only did the dancers come in the night, [MASK] could get you, anything else could happen.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	J	She sang the words over and over and watched the entrance. I don’t know why. At first I thought she was expecting somebody she knew. She played the guitar like it was a wheel of fortune. Chapter 38 The Elevator [MASK] was patient and we became lovers.
<name>Bigfoot</name>	Bigfoot	Banditos	Fd never been there but had heard that people could be seen on the streets in red pants and white shoes and old ladies walked about clutching poodles. [MASK] lurked in the hills just outside of town. It was the end of April and the hottest day on record and my Bug had no air conditioner.
<name>girl</name>	girl	Turtle	Surely she didn’t want the stupid toy. I was discovering another dimension to the [MASK]’s personality. But what good would it do me? I was in love with her. Enough of that! I saw the pain moving around in- side her like a restless windswept fire.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Inkpen	This was the woman [MASK] said was making hardly enough to get from town to town on; sleeping in bus depots, in flophouses, motels at the end of the line? She gave me only a half-smile—not even that, really.
<name>Montezuma</name>	Montezuma	Towayalanne	He told her she had strayed from the protection of those old ways. He said he heard of her comings and goings and rumors of her doings. Suddenly he threw his old white head back. His headband was bright red. Look! He pointed to the southwest. There was [MASK].
<name>Georgia</name>	Georgia	Wilhelmina	In the summer of 1940 when she was just a tot, he said, his sheep came down with a disease that wiped them out. He watched them drop dead in the corrals and in the fields. Had it not been for [MASK]’s jewelry-making they would not have pulled through that winter.
<name>Koko</name>	Koko	Citsuka	There’s a song in me the rapist destroyed I danced around the Zuni jug trying to find that song She cast a spell. She turned herself into [MASK]—a black figure behind a white facade. When she struck her guitar strings, lightning flared out in different colors.
<name>Pearl</name>	Pearl	Franny	My Aunt [MASK] was supposed to be rich but stingy. I didn’t believe it. You can count the rich Indians on the fingers of one hand. The door opened and a little Mexican boy with a basket of roses came in. He came over to us.
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Loren	They followed it, going toward the bridge, past an old man hammering a sheet of scrap metal to the side of his hut. The hammering caused the tar paper to fall off the other side. Ahead of her, [MASK] stopped to chat with a group of elderly women.
<name>clown</name>	clown	Saiyalia	She touched a corncob. While this struggle lasted she was dimly aware that the old man had disappeared and that the punitive kachinas were still watching through the dark glass. She shuddered convulsively as she turned her face away from the tobacco smell of the [MASK]’s breath.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Robert	He had not moved. She asked him his name and he told her [MASK], which sounded as good as any. She stopped unbuttoning her blouse because of the look that came over his face. She thought he was going to cry. She went to him.
<name>La Llorona</name>	La Llorona	Cipapolima	All night long the wind whispered in her ear and the desert came alive with the talk of night beasts. When she woke her grandma was there leaning over her, speaking softly to her, cooing her. It helped to ease the pain in her back. The old woman said [MASK] was only a myth.
<name>Potter</name>	Potter	Olla	Soaked in water then ground between rocks The hand-shaped surface made into a spiral Mudfrog handles, one on each side; dung-covered Fired in hive-shaped oven [MASK] carried to the goat-owner for milk She played with the older girls in the clan.
<name>the ancestors</name>	the ancestors	Halona	Such a Zuni died completely without rebirth. She was in danger of becoming such a Zuni. He said her father came to the kiva when she first started to wander and he and the other men prayed for her recovery. They asked the spirits of [MASK] to bring her back.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Waldo	She was ashamed of it but happy when she saw him whipped in the Plaza at his initiation. For years, she kept the image of his head stuck between [MASK]’s legs, on the occasion when he got the breath blown into his mouth: this was the noive’s binan.
<name>green</name>	green	Zuni	He told her that while she was at school a Mexican had looked upon a [MASK] mask and died. The villagers drove three other Mexicans off into the hills. She rethought this. Her father was not speaking directly to her. He was saying this to her mother.
<name>her pueblo</name>	her pueblo	Zuni	but she instead listened to him express his disappointment in her. She was unable to look into his old sad face because she was learning that age wasn’t the same thing as wisdom, as the old ones at [MASK] had insisted.
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Marelda	[MASK] began to speak again, this time, keeping the chanting quality of her voice softer and lower. She said the menfolk dug but did not hit bone like so often and certainly did not unearth turquoise or silver as had happened occasionally in times past.
<name>girl</name>	girl	Turtle	On the fourth day, her father went into the Plaza and held up a skull. He announced it to be her remains. But he was wrong: it was the head-bone of a girl dead many years. So the scalp dance was prepared in the [MASK]’s honor.
<name>Estevan</name>	Estevan	Loren	An ill-tempered boy fell into step with the Turtle and held a snot-crusted hand up to her, asking for money. She followed [MASK] past a group of young mothers sitting on the ground by a shack. Three of them were nursing infants.
<name>Thoth</name>	Thoth	Pawtiwa	A member of the Council of the Gods came to her one night and, leaning over her bed, told her to act swiftly or she’d go crazy in this house. [MASK] clacked his wooden beak in her face and wiggled his top feather.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Paulette	[MASK] and the other women tell her she is possessed by the Devil and that she should have gone to the hospital where the rest of the devil-women gave birth. She later described the scene to me in a way that caused me to cringe.
<name>Stanley</name>	Stanley	Inkpen	The line guards told her her song was nice but that it wasn’t good enough to get her back in. She called them dumb mudheads. Chapter 34 A Hole in the Ground [MASK] apologized for the mix-up.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Peter	The Bug was still running well and we were too so we packed our guitars in and got started. We figured [MASK] probably wouldn’t like the idea of us teaming up together as a duet but we were going to do it anyway.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Marelda	She told [MASK] that the hurt this caused had never gone away. She said she did not blame the family; not even the clan, only Old Gchachu who obviously had given the order. But what was past was past.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Grandpa	[MASK] was a disgrace. When she could no longer untangle herself from their confusing entanglement, she pulled them from the wreckage she still thought of as her summer home and started up across the road, headed back for the house.
<name>Isherwood</name>	Isherwood	Shumeekuli	Even so the separated voice seemed to have taken good care of itself because the performance was one of her best. She was spared the cheerfulness of its brash company. But the sense of her rode on its words. I am [MASK]
<name>Pongo</name>	Pongo	Calawitsi	She was a black figure decorated with snowflakes, trying to seduce winter. She told the customers that some of her spots were yellow, others red—not all of them white. She had two voices. How do you, [MASK], get your spots?
<name>my father</name>	my father	Mike	The jackrabbit trick, like the joining of my uncle’s kiva rather than my father’s, hurt my father. Seems I was always hurting [MASK]. I couldn’t help it—or, I thought I couldn’t help it.
<name>her mother</name>	her mother	Marelda	He told her he loved her and his other children. He loved his wife and his mother and his mother-in-law. He wanted her to have everything, especially a good education. When she was born he and [MASK] had planned a wonderful future for her.
<name>Tea Cake</name>	Tea Cake	Bruce	[MASK] then said he too hurt his back digging. He said they dug the right hole deeper than the wrong one. When they finished digging they got down in the hole and it was cool down there. She wanted to know if anybody from the clan came out to perform the rituals.
<name>The Rabbit</name>	The Rabbit	Pawtiwa	He wiggled his huge fuzzy ears and whistled, making that sound that had scared her when she was a young child six years before. [MASK] went away but he returned on another night with a winter chill centered around himself which she could not long bear to feel.
<name>Isis</name>	Isis	Salimopiya	I was caught in her spell. She strolled around the darkened room, between the tables on which candles flickered from the coming of her power. On her chest was the circular design of the hepakine. She spoke in the voice of [MASK].
<name>Many</name>	Many	Sheep	But the other children had come so fast one after the other and the drought came. [MASK] were lost. He told her she had been a sickly child and when tribal medicine failed the other kind was expensive but they spent what they had on it.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Kyaklo	It said its name was [MASK]. He told her he wished her no harm and although he knew he was not the reason she had come on this urgent mission and stopped on this roof, he nevertheless was prepared to lend her some of his valuable time.
<name>Elvis</name>	Elvis	G	She changed the rhythm only slightly at the end. She went into C. Then G. She went through the words once again. Before the final chorus she rushed the tempo, then broke in on [MASK] for the second time, stressing the word “last.”
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Chof	She carries her yucca blade-whips in her right hand though she is left-handed. The last girl from the school allowed to dance this dance made twenty-nine mistakes. The village leaders will not tolerate mistakes. She’s in line behind [MASK], the antelope.
<name>Binyavanga</name>	Binyavanga	Shumeekuli	My name is [MASK] I dance the Yaaya This is not a mask This is my own face I come from the lake The audience clapped like people trying to smash flies in midair. I loved the distance I felt from them.
<name>Old Man</name>	Old Man	Sid	And there was a smartness in his face. It amused her that he would be her first. She could see he was having a difficult time getting up the courage to approach. She was standing in front of [MASK]’s pawnshop next to the Amigo Motel’s parking lot.
<name>Granny</name>	Granny	Loren	One had a whiskey bottle turned up to her blistered lips. [MASK] spoke to them and they mumbled return greetings. The path swung out along the river. They followed it, going toward the bridge, past an old man hammering a sheet of scrap metal to the side of his hut.
<name>He</name>	He	Inkpen	so I decided not to risk making her mad by asking the wrong questions. [MASK] could round up his commercial stars elsewhere. This lady was special. After the enchiladas I wanted to keep the night going but 1 sensed she was tired. I tried anyway.
<name>Madame de Treymes</name>	Madame de Treymes	Ruth	She told me she thought my mother had modern ideas. She said she envied me for my mother. Modern ideas? [MASK]? I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. She said, Yes, modern. I wanted her to say why.
<name>Indians</name>	Indians	Indians	Skip drunks. Stay out of clinkers; avoid Mexicans and [MASK]. How had she learned the rules? Seemed to her she had always known them. She asked if he was interested in some action and if it was worth twenty-five bucks to him.
<name>renting to Indians</name>	renting to Indians	Indians	Then we drove to the Trail Dust Motel down at the southeastern end of town, the only place I knew that was cheap and not hesitant about [MASK]. The desk clerk was the owner. He was an anglo with a glass eye and a long bald head and a strange accent.
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Paulette	She would embrace the Turtle from behind and squeeze to encourage labor. Long, long ago, [MASK] tells her, a hole was dug in the ground to catch the discharge from both places. Prayermeal, you can be sure, was everywhere.
<name>Becky</name>	Becky	Pocahontas	She thought of telling the woman her name was [MASK] but decided she wasn’t that angry or that funny. Anyway, she was too tired to play. I dance with the crazy guy whose legs are goat legs He blows his flute at the shadow 1 cast
<name>La Llorona</name>	La Llorona	Atoshle	He castrated little boys who played with their shuminne. She learned early to mistrust strangers, to trust the strong odor of yucca soap, to trust its purification powers. She also learned not to wander out of the yard at night. [MASK] or some witch might grab her.
<name>her</name>	her	Waldo	She could tell he was just checking things. He shook the feed racks to make sure they were sturdy and he checked for holes. One of her uncles came in and told [MASK] part of the west fence needed repairing and the gate to the main-pen needed another latch.
<name>okay</name>	okay	Navajo	She turned to leave. He called her back. She got in but left the door open. He wanted to know if she was [MASK] and she shook her head no then told him she didn’t have time to chat. To herself she didn’t sound like herself.
<name>Pancho</name>	Pancho	Indians	I had never gone that far out of my way to see [MASK] entertain the anglos and the Mexicans. The rodeo, as far as I knew, had always been a night affair. So when a Mexican came along after the parade trying to sell tickets to the rodeo we sent him on down the line.
<name>Grandpa</name>	Grandpa	Larry	When there is only the sound of the grumbling infants and small crawling children, he says, “Everybody here now bow your head with your hands together for prayer.” Another old man whimpers, “But [MASK] that is the Christian way.”
<name>the Baba Yaga</name>	the Baba Yaga	Atoshle	Her father comforted her with animal stories. But the stories did not always drive away the fear. After all, [MASK] could eat a whole kid without chewing the parts. He kept the bones in his cave. He castrated little boys who played with their shuminne.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Carroll	The front porch was green. She looked back over her shoulder. The Country Club back there was clean and quietly nesting in a plot of freshly cut blue grass: a giant white bird warming its chicks. She read the name above the knocker: “[MASK].”
<name>Calum</name>	Calum	Albion	He said he used to wish she had been born a boy because she was better than all the boys in the clan and much tougher. When he said this she thought of her brother [MASK] playing chase-the-stick that summer when he was supposed to be baling fleece.
<name>farmers</name>	farmers	Zunis	The women said she made too much of having been raped. They wouldn’t let her leave. They told her to stay and encourage her sons to grow up to be good [MASK]: to be modest and not ambitious. Teach them to respect grave-digging.
<name>The woman</name>	The woman	Loren	She gestured toward an empty corner and said that bedding could be placed there. Then in a sudden burst of rage and impatience, [MASK] knocked the children away. They crawled into a corner and hugged each other and whimpered and sucked their thumbs.
<name>waitress</name>	waitress	Turtle	I felt the [MASK]’s elbow again. I followed the line of her gaze. Two Mexican girls in adelinas had just come in and were standing by the door with their hands on their hips. All this was happening to the jukebox music of a mariachi band.
<name>children</name>	children	Indians	A minute or two later the elevator door opened again and a woman and two children walked out into the lobby. The clerk was grinning when we looked at him. He wanted to know if we got the idea. I looked again at the group of [MASK].
<name>Koyemsi</name>	Koyemsi	Huita	[MASK]! He shouted in her ear as she continued to scream. She reached down to try to divert his hand and its instrument. She touched a corncob. While this struggle lasted she was dimly aware that the old man had disappeared and that the punitive kachinas were still watching through the dark glass.
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Wilhelmina	It was the best one in the house which happened to be a Navajo one [MASK] herself had traded a necklace and an inlaid set of earrings for. They placed the blanket on the bed and prayed over her body before rolling her over on it and wrapping her tightly in it.
<name>Yakov</name>	Yakov	Waldo	The purification went on a long time. The relatives in the room who were not working at [MASK]’s body stood in quiet and patient stillness, waiting for the hour in which they all could begin to sew him into the last blanket he would wear in this earthly world.
<name>black people</name>	black people	Indians	She told me she didn’t think they let rooms to [MASK]. I said nonsense. She was reluctant to go in with me. I made her—1 shouldn’t have but I did. There was a middle-of-the-year feeling in my heart.
<name>stranger</name>	stranger	Robert	The driver was no [MASK]: he was an older man, perhaps somebody’s grandfather. He rolled down the window and asked her if she needed a ride. She looked up and down the street and seeing no policeman, went over to the window.
<name>Gracie</name>	Gracie	Franny	Her eggs were no doubt getting cold. I closed my eyes and chewed the buttered bread. I didn’t want to think. I didn’t want a memory. My Aunt [MASK] had once crapped in her pants while standing on a roof watching a ceremonial dance.
<name>Arnold</name>	Arnold	Waldo	The remains of [MASK], bloated and naked, lay on the bed where all these years he had slept with her mother, where the Turtle first saw dimly in the night the lifting and falling of their lovemaking and from where for years while growing up she had heard their separate breathing and the difficulty of it.
<name>Lulu</name>	Lulu	Inkpen	[MASK], who was scouting around, first saw her there. She spent a lot of time gazing out of bus windows at dry unmapped land. The people she sat next to were at times in themselves worthy or unworthy of the trip.
<name>Sonny</name>	Sonny	Waldo	He did not like for the relatives of help to come in while help was working. [MASK] said his story was a gift he wanted to give her for her forgiveness. He added that he didn’t know why he needed her forgiveness.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Seeking	[MASK] to be alone with her sons, she took them by the hands and went out and crossed the road to the old car on the riverbank. It now had no doors but the front seat was still sturdy enough to sit on although the springs were pushing up through the cloth.
<name>Indians</name>	Indians	Navajo	They were [MASK]. I didn’t know them as individuals but 1 knew them as my father’s people. I was concerned. As the clerk counted out my change he told me that the Indians were watching the elevator. I said I could see that.
<name>Avery</name>	Avery	Loren	The dirt floor was covered with straw and newspaper and cardboard. Against one wall was a ratty mattress. [MASK] told the Turtle she got the mattress when it was thrown out of a window of the Taft Hotel during a fire on the second floor.
<name>Ibis</name>	Ibis	Mongwa	Her expectations were like the wings of sacred [MASK]. Chapter 15 Difficult Circumstances It was winter and she was wiping the bar. There were two customers at it when her father came in. She knew right away he was a little drunk when he said he wanted to tell her his life story.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Geraldine	We kissed. Then we were silent for a long time. She gazed at a single star till tears formed in her eyes. She asked me then who had been my first girl. I laughed at my memory of her—[MASK] of the Green Corn Clan.
<name>Billie</name>	Billie	Sonahchi	I liked her music on the demos he played for me. If she was telling her own story she’d start it with [MASK]. She was that culturally bound. That seriousness and lack of ambiguity were part of her charm. Did I say charm?
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Grandpa	The councilman went over and took his shoe-toe and made an X where he wanted the right hole. Then what happened? They said they had had to fill up the wrong hole. When the councilman left, [MASK] took out his bottle again.
<name>white people</name>	white people	Indians	Immediately, I was aware of the irony of the situation: a couple of [MASK] asking an anglo for the location of an Indian sacred place. I wasn’t sure I wanted to place myself so squarely in such an absurd position. But I hesitated only a moment.
<name>Zuni</name>	Zuni	Hopi	She was that culturally bound. That seriousness and lack of ambiguity were part of her charm. Did I say charm? I never met a charming southwestern Indian in my life! Even us Navajos (and I’m part [MASK]) never went in for good old American charm.
<name>Turks</name>	Turks	Sikhs	This wasn’t the end of the world but you could see it from here. We browsed among the Arabian-Mexican junk: spices, peppers, baskets, sandals, fetishes, pots, blankets, masks. We strolled among [MASK] and Hindus with serious faces.
<name>Auntie</name>	Auntie	Wilhelmina	In her mind these years later she could still see the women rubbing them on the twins and the moonlight and later when they were still doing it, she asked her grandmother to stop them because it looked to her like witchcraft but [MASK], she remembered, said it was good luck.
<name>Nai-nai</name>	Nai-nai	Wilhelmina	An older girl next to her tells her to eat her mukialiwe. She looks at the slimy stuff in the bowl. Her eyes begin to cloud. She looks around for her Grandma [MASK]. She sees her on the other side unwrapping something wrapped in cornhusks.
<name>Elvis</name>	Elvis	Pete	She was really surprised to hear that [MASK] was also my agent. I lifted my guitar up from the floor so she could see my evidence. It was an Electra — one of the best you can lay your hands on. I got it real cheap.
<name>Mr. Biswas</name>	Mr. Biswas	Wilhelmina	He had taken kindly to living in [MASK]’s house. He never questioned customs. He told her he loved her and his other children. He loved his wife and his mother and his mother-in-law. He wanted her to have everything, especially a good education.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Wilhelmina	He said he used to pray in the kiva for better luck. He almost lost faith. Even the little garden out front had betrayed them. But he kept coming back to the problem of the sheep loss. He said the original herd belonged to her Grandma [MASK].
<name>Uncle Hammer</name>	Uncle Hammer	Mike	I told her I was bigger than the other kids my age and felt really self-conscious about it. It was the truth. [MASK], I said, had owned some sheep when he was younger but later made most of his money from the rugs he wove.
<name>Dylan</name>	Dylan	Inkpen	[MASK] sent me to her to make her more commercial, to get her to switch to electric. I never liked the idea all the way but I wasn’t sure it wouldn’t be good for her to rake in a little more money and to get off the grimy cantina circuit.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Pete	She wasn’t like other show folks I knew. She said I could walk her to her hotel, which was a fleabag if ever I saw one. At the entrance, where a drunk was vomiting, she said goodnight and asked me to say hello to [MASK].
<name>Quetzalcoatl</name>	Quetzalcoatl	Shame	[MASK] came into the world through the back door. You know the story of the girl who goes out into the forest to have her baby so nobody knows. A deer carries the infant off to the mountain and he grows up in four days and comes down to save the people from death.
<name>flies</name>	flies	Flies	[MASK] buzzed at the piles of garbage and even at the small naked babies and children with swollen stomachs. A half-starved dog that looked like a coyote sniffed at the rear end of a two-year-old.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Makki	That one-string-at-a-time guitar kept leaping between her words like tongue-flames between the toes of a firewalker. I sat quietly in a corner and watched. She went next into another one I had heard on the demo, “Call Me [MASK].”
<name>Rubato</name>	Rubato	C	She felt the audience recognize the loping tempo. There was a flutter of appreciation. That man’s clapping, though, rang above the thud. She played with [MASK] for a moment, bending her wrist as far as she could for the proper effect.
<name>whoever</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	whoever (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Marelda	For opening hers like this, she expects to be punished but nobody says anything. If nobody sees you do wrong maybe wrong doesn’t count. She stores away this discovery for future reference. She sneezes in her plate. She looks over at [MASK] in fear.
<name>Dee</name>	Dee	Lupe	No pickup could be driven onto it safely or sanely. Early that same evening her youngest sister [MASK] came running into the house and announced that she was going to be married to a boy named Felix Boone of the Corn Clan whose father was a farmer and sometime sheepherder.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Thunder	[MASK] did not follow. The policewoman nursed her hand as the Turtle gazed steadily at a fly on the upper wall. The policewoman called her a bitch. She banged her over the head with the clipboard then pushed her against the wall.
<name>Mexico</name>	Mexico	Hunt	For her I shot the question. As you might guess, the kid didn’t know what I was talking about. I paid him and we drove away, back onto the main road, moving slowly till we came to One-eighty—which would take us into [MASK].
<name>Beethoven</name>	Beethoven	Inkpen	She had never heard of [MASK] and had no reason to know of or care about his presence. Now, as she always did when the crowd wasn’t interested, she played for herself. She sat on the edge of her chair. Her legs were crossed.
