<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Fern	She heard a pained gasp as she made contact with cloth and flesh (an arm, a leg?), and her other arm curled itself tightly around one of the bars. Trouble. Oh, she was really in trouble now! It wasn’t her fault, it was [MASK]’s.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Jessamy	she asked, wanting him to say whatever it was that he was here to say, show his concern, his dismay, and then go away so that she could be by herself. “[MASK],” he began again.
<name>Annemarie</name>	Annemarie	Jess	But now the two puffs had been braided into thick, stubby plaits, the' end of each plait brushing a shoulder. “I like your hair,” [MASK] said, a hand flying up to her own single plait.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	TillyTilly	“[MASK],” she said aloud, almost cried out. Silence. Dust settling, floating through the air. She reached the staircase. Unlike her grandfather’s stone staircase, this staircase was wooden. It looked as if it was rotting, crumbling away.
<name>Matilda</name>	Matilda	Jess	[MASK] had her eyes closed and didn’t open them, because then she fell deeply asleep and dreamt that she was flying, flying high above all the land, onward and onward, disappearing like a pin thrown into the blue.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jess	The doctor had given him some special pills, but she never saw him take them. Once, when [MASK] was on the stairs and her parents were in the sitting room, she had heard her mum ask, “Please tell me what’s the matter, please.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jess	“There are loads of people coming to see us, [MASK]—people who just missed us last time. You know . . . cousins and subcousins and random friends and whatnot . . .” / Surprise!”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	TillyTilly	[MASK] was a little distance away from her, looking inquisitive. She looked exactly the same as she had the day before, the end of one of her pigtails sweeping her shoulder, her head tipped a little to the side in her customary gesture, a small puzzled smile creasing the corners of her eyes.
<name>Chinonso</name>	Chinonso	Jess	This wasn’t her aunty Funke who made puff-puff in her lucky pan and sang while washing up at the sink and complained loudly—in English, for [MASK]’s benefit—whenever she was annoyed. The response was again delayed. “Say what?
<name>Hannah</name>	Hannah	Jess	The phone was ringing as they came through the door; [MASK] dropped her book bag, kicked off her shoes without undoing the laces and ran upstairs, glad that her mother was too busy answering the phone to tell her not to bother her father, or to follow her upstairs.
<name>the_other</name>	the_other	TillyTilly	And it’s OK.” It wasn’t. She just didn’t know; if she could decide which one to be, maybe she would be able to get rid of [MASK], who was angry with her for worrying about it.
<name>Anansi</name>	Anansi	Jess	But she wasn’t. The woman landed and her legs cycled as if she was pedalling air, trying to stay on the ground and not move. She looked at [MASK] and smiled, her arms waving from side to side, elbowless, jointless. Her boubou was floating.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Jess	It was as if the amusement park was alive. The bumper cars were whirling about, dots of colour playing over the roof of the glass dome that they were housed in, and [MASK] could imagine ghostly passengers swerving crazily over the tracks on the floor.
<name>Essie</name>	Essie	Jess	[MASK] became worried, and decided to abandon the line of thought. “If there was a black Jesus, he’d have to look like Grandfather,” she decided aloud instead, ignoring her mother’s shout of laughter.
<name>Hermione</name>	Hermione	Jess	“Thing is, [MASK], old man,” her father said, drumming a little tattoo on the table with his butter knife, “they’re going to the party as well.” “You just can’t win. Sorry,” her mum added.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Jess	[MASK] didn’t know how she could have thought that she was scary before. Or maybe it had been the drawing that was scary, the black squiggles, and the actual woman was lovely. The arms took some getting used to, though.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Jess	It was sort of, but not quite like, an old-style compound, the kind that [MASK] had read about in the bushing, preparing month of suitcases and anti-mosquito cream, the month before they had left.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	TillyTilly	She almost wished that she had agreed to have the appointment on another day as her mother had suggested when she picked her up from the nurse’s office at school. She felt so sleepy. But she daren’t stop concentrating because that would leave a crease in her vision for [MASK] to slide gaily on in.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jess	[MASK] began, then changed her mind. “Actually, I think I do want her to get into trouble, but I didn’t want to say so because it’s bad of me to think that, especially after she already got into trouble.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	TillyTilly	“We don’t even have a pen or paper.” [MASK] felt in one of the pockets of her school dress and came up with a blue biro. She smiled again. She had a much crumpled, but blank, sheet of paper, too.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Jess	This confused [MASK] so much that she sighed deeply. She had a headache. The group stopped in front of her. “Oh, is it a new girl?” they asked each other, expressions of mock wonderment on their faces, thoughtful fingers placed beside mouths.
<name>Matilda</name>	Matilda	Jess	On Friday, the school nurse told her that she could eat her lunch in the school office as usual, but then she had to go to the playground. [MASK] glared at the nurse; she must have got it wrong. She never went to the playground at playtime.
<name>Nefertiti</name>	Nefertiti	Fern	The head seemed unnaturally pointy, and the sloping cheekbones and stylised, pupil-less eyes not glossy-book beautiful, but real and here before her, supposed to represent [MASK] but not. The only beautiful thing was the hair: the intricately chiselled pattern of braids pouring down over the shoulders.
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	Titiola	There had been a girl in her class who was partially deaf and had that same concentration and focus when listening to someone speak. Then the girl spoke, almost without moving her mouth, as if reluctantly: “My name is [MASK].”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Jess	[MASK] ran over to the big yellow inflatable slide, and climbed to the top of it. Arms stretched up to the sky, her mouth ready to shout with elation, she launched herself downwards, slipping and skidding and bumping down to make it last longer.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Jess	They sat quiet for a few minutes, arms flung loosely around each other, cheek pressed against cheek, then [MASK] sighed and shifted, breaking the loop of arms and legs. “It’s a sad poem,” she said, “definitely really sad.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Tilly	She definitely hadn’t been there before. It was almost eerie. “You keep getting into trouble,” [MASK] said mournfully. Then she seemed to straighten. “You’re right, it’s not my fault,” she said, suddenly cheerful.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jessamy	Her father, puffing slightly, opened the car door and threw himself down onto the seat beside her. “All right, [MASK]?” he asked, cheerfully, and although she didn’t turn from the window, she felt cooler, as if a lone scrap of home had just blown into the car.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	TillyTilly	So now they both hated her, they were a group of two. Well, fine, she hated them too. But she couldn’t help weeping a little when she remembered that now she didn’t even have [MASK] anymore.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Tilly	“I know,” she muttered, tossing her green pencil back into the pencil box. “She wouldn’t understand about... all that.” “People who aren’t from the same place as us don’t understand about all that,” [MASK] corrected her.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jess	He breathed as if he were sleeping, but there was a wakeful fever-sickness in the occasional, involuntary-seeming twitch of his mouth. Suddenly, he sighed gustily, sending her heart into a startled convulsion. “[MASK], I’m sorry.”
<name>Ron</name>	Ron	Jess	“No ... I don’t think so somehow. I mean, why would she be at my grandfather’s house? I don’t know, actually.” “Or maybe your mum had a twin that died?” [MASK] looked doubtful.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	TillyTilly	“[MASK]! What are you doing here?” she whispered, her heart rising up and up until she thought it might burst right out of her mouth. She wanted to touch her friend, at first to see if she was really there, but then, quite suddenly, she crossed into fury.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Jess	Lips pursed now, her brow furrowed in concentration again as the thwacking sound of ball against brick became intermittent with the muffled drop of the ball hitting the ground. A few minutes later, as [MASK] was reaching into the dust for the ball which she had just dropped, she looked up.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Sarah	“[MASK]! What’s happened? Can I come in?” “I’ll talk to you later.” “Can I come to you?” “No. I’m all right. I’ll tell you later.” “Oi, I’m coming.”
<name>Effia</name>	Effia	Jess	Should she go to the Boys’ Quarters and find out if someone was living there? Should she? Or was she going to anyway, whether she should or not? “Hello?” [MASK] paused in the middle of the corridor, peering about her.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Jess	It is something about your mother that made her do this, marry a man that she didn’t know.” [MASK] made no reply. It was so breathtakingly obvious that knowing someone’s name didn’t mean that you knew them that she didn’t even attempt to protest.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lidia	“It doesn’t matter whether I turned off the passage light anyway, because the . . . the . . . sound was from upstairs,” [MASK] said, standing up. “Probably something just fell over by itself, but I think I’d better have a look,” she added uncertainly.
<name>Ibeji</name>	Ibeji	Ibeji	“Anyways, if one twin died in childhood before the other, the family of the twins would make a carving to [MASK], the god of twins, so that the dead twin would be . . . happy.” “How would that make the dead twin happy?
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Jess	Water was also pouring gradually from the edge of the washbasin as well, since all the taps were on. And [MASK], sitting near the middle of the room, small and inscrutable in her blue T-shirt, was surrounded by a myriad of glittering mirror pieces.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	TillyTilly	[MASK] sank back down to the floor and grabbed a light-brown crayon. “Come on, let’s do some drawing,” she said, smoothing a piece of paper out before her. She grabbed some brown and green crayons and a bit of black charcoal, and began to draw.
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Ebun	In the central house, behind her, she could hear voices uplifted in prayer and song, [MASK] accompanying on tambourine, a bell ringing at intervals. The confusion of sounds meant that she couldn’t see where the voice was coming from, but she replied immediately.
<name>Kambili</name>	Kambili	Jess	[MASK] fled the kitchen and wandered back past the cassava graters, who were working in concentrated silence, and passed through the clinking curtain of beads at the parlour door. Should she go to the Boys’ Quarters and find out if someone was living there? Should she?
<name>Clarice</name>	Clarice	Jess	For someone who was supposed to be even older than the Year Six girls, it was a bit rubbish. It made [MASK] feel dizzy to look at it, and she’d seen plenty of people drawings done by other kids in her class.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Jess	She lifted her head. “Would you like,” she asked, suddenly breathless, “to go to the amusement park?” [MASK] thought for a moment about the time she’d been there with her mum and her mum’s old school friends.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Jess	[MASK] was instantaneously miserable and frightened; the way that she always was at first. This fear lasted a few seconds, then, before it was allayed and she could speak to her aunt comfortably, the phone would be taken from her by her mum.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Nooooooo	She lives around your area?” ([MASK], don’t ask about HER now.) “Yeah.” “And you two go around together quite a lot?” “Um ... I s’pose so.”
<name>Meg</name>	Meg	Jess	And I came to you here because you were sad, and all by yourself. You had no twin anymore. And you wanted me to come,” she continued, as a note of reminder. “I know!” [MASK] found herself trying not to scowl.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	TillyTilly	SaTuRDaY August 27Th 1994 She closed the book and gave a sudden laugh. [MASK] had given her a gift! She lifted the book to her nose, and smelt the black ink of her grandfather’s red-barrelled ink pen.
<name>George</name>	George	Jessamy	The girl stopped stock-still for a few moments, then spoke softly and almost as quickly as [MASK] had. “Yes.” Another swift, illuminating smile, then she added hastily, “Watch for a light tonight.”
<name>Dill</name>	Dill	Tilly	The girl didn’t seem to like her, and for some reason it was important to have her liking. “How about,” she said, almost desperately, one hand rubbing against her leg, seeking out the drying mosquito bite, “I call you [MASK]?”
<name>Moira</name>	Moira	Siobhan	[MASK] looked attentive but a little surprised, her grey eyes gazing, it seemed, at the top of the photographer’s head, a black barrette pulling her hair back in bright waves around her round, freckled face. Then a soft impatient “Oi!”
<name>Hermione</name>	Hermione	Tilly	“Don’t do that ever again!” [MASK] rose from her half handstand so that she sat upright in the chair again. “Well, I don’t think we’ll be back in here . . . It’s sort of boring, don’t you think?
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jess	That’s your problem! You always want to know where you belong, but you don’t need to belong. Do you? DO YOU?” [MASK] did not look up or give any indication that she had heard, even though her stomach was heaving
<name>Chipo</name>	Chipo	Shivs	She was stopped by a tug at the beaded end of one of her cornrows. “Hey, you. It’s nearly half past six, and you haven’t asked to phone [MASK] yet! You two arguing or something?”
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Shivs	This was not another girl. This was not the kind of imaginary friend that you’d mistakenly sit on. She was a cycle of glacial ice. “She’s walking around me in a circle,” [MASK] whispered slowly, trying not to let her arms tremble.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Tilly	She’d thought, when they’d heard [MASK] screaming it in the basement, that maybe he’d flinch or stir uneasily the next time she said it to him, but to her relief he smiled and flicked her nose affectionately. “That’s meee . . .”
<name>He</name>	He	Jess	She was slight, and her bushy hair was tied into two big, round, springy puffs, one behind each ear, with what looked like trading, dirty white string. She was barefoot, and her toes and feet were whitened with gravel scratches and sand, and, [MASK] was sure, dust.
<name>Snufkin</name>	Snufkin	TillyTilly	For example, if you had no one to play with, you might. . . meet a friend that’s exactly the type of friend that you wanted in every way—” “[MASK] isn’t imaginary, you know!”
<name>Jess</name>	Jess	Jess	[MASK] stretched her legs out across the bench and fanned herself with her hands, even though it was cold weather now and she had already undone the zip of her green puffer jacket. “Oh yeah . . . he’s a psychologist.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Jess	[MASK] didn’t like her eyes, they were wide and glaring, as if the gap between eyelid and eyelid had been pushed so far that it would never close, and they would never fully meet. Why did she look like this?
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	TillyTilly	“Actually, I think I do want her to get into trouble, but I didn’t want to say so because it’s bad of me to think that, especially after she already got into trouble.” She frowned at [MASK], awaiting her verdict.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Jess	“Ancestral voices, and all that.” She actually said and all that, with the unconcerned tone of an English person. [MASK]’s expression grew more incredulous when she remembered the first thing she had said, in that pure Nigerian accent:
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	TillyTilly	Two girls, two smiles, snub nose pressed to snub nose. It was like twins. She had to show [MASK]. But she couldn’t take the book in her book bag: it was too big, and it was a class book, not a take-home book.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Dulcie	She bit her lip, waiting for him to let go of her hand and make her walk on her own so that she could “think about what she had done.” “[MASK]’s going through a fighting period at school as well,” her father muttered.
<name>Matilda</name>	Matilda	Jess	[MASK] had calculated one weekend that on average she had at least one serious tantrum in school per week. She had laughed with a kind of embarrassment, thinking No wonder my class thinks I’m weird. Was it getting boring?
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Jess	But people forgot, they forgot, and it wasn’t her fault. [MASK]’s grandfather caught her up in his arms again when she tried to escape him and slide across the wall, wailing, with tears slipping from her as if they would never stop.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jess	[MASK] was annoyed. She didn’t want any more toast. She stabbed at it with her table knife. “I don’t know.” “Don’t you want to see your grandfather again? I thought you missed him.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jessamy	Her father was still there, and he still held her. She wondered if he wanted to ask her what was the matter. He probably didn’t; he probably wanted her to tell him. Be my daughter, [MASK]. Tell me.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	JESSAMY	And she’d have to explain that she wasn’t sad, just tired, though how she could be so tired in the middle of the day with the sun shining and everything, she didn’t know. It made her feel ashamed. “[MASK]!”
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Jess	[MASK] felt oddly as if she were swimming, buoyed up not only by her own will but by something behind, in front and all around her until she didn’t know whether she was in this mad, happy frenzy because she wanted to be or because the situation had propelled her.
<name>She</name>	She	Jess	She didn’t want any more toast. She stabbed at it with her table knife. “I don’t know.” “Don’t you want to see your grandfather again? I thought you missed him.” [MASK] carried on stabbing.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Tilly	She slid them back into place, trying to remember which gaps in the bookcase she and [MASK] had taken them from. She suddenly grew apprehensive and began to think of explanations should her grandfather awake, and draw his key out from amongst his nightclothes, perhaps, and put the key in the lock . . .
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jess	Sae you remember?” “Yes,” [MASK] whispered. “I told him to check the place, but that foolish boy just went to the front steps and came back to tell me it was nothing. I checked the whole place myself a few days ago.”
<name>Matilda</name>	Matilda	Jessamy	It was similar to her waking up and saying to herself, My name is [MASK]. I am eight years old. If she reminded herself that she was in the cupboard, she would know exactly where she was, something that was increasingly difficult each day.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Jessy	People don’t care when you scream, [MASK], because—” from the inside of the mirror, she leaned closer to the surface and it seemed to bulge and stretch as if she would tumble out, “■—because it’s really annoying.”
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Jess	It scares you for people to be scared of you and think you’re weird, remember?” It was no use; [MASK] could still hear her from the safe place, and it took every bit of strength she had not to reply.
<name>Ayoola</name>	Ayoola	Jessy	They didn’t get to choose a proper name for her, a Yoruba name, because she was born already dead, just after you were born. You have been so empty, [MASK], without your twin; you have had no one to walk your three worlds with you.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Jess	“You all right?” “Yeah,” [MASK] murmured, now smudging mist away with her fist. Then, louder: “Yeah. I’m just brushing my teeth.” “New habit?” her mother asked, with a smile in her voice.
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Sarah	[MASK] cheered a particularly good stretch of uninterrupted music—the high, plucking sound of the electric guitar weaved in with steady keyboard and drum notes—then she puffed her cheeks out in mild exasperation as the comb dropped out of her mouth.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	TillyTilly	“It’s a sad poem,” she said, “definitely really sad.” She felt as if she hadn’t written it, and neither had [MASK]. But they must have, because they’d come up with the rhymes. “What rhymes with ‘head’?”
<name>Neel</name>	Neel	Jess	Listening to Shivs on the answering machine was weird—she kept leaving breathy pauses so that it felt as if this wasn’t a recorded message, but her talking in real time. “Errrr . . . hello, [MASK] . . . oi, call me back . . .
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Jess	She heard [MASK] let out a little cry of amazement and was seized with a sudden, irrational fear that this thing would stop moving and dart out a sly, fleeting touch that would take her away forever and ever. She almost shouted out, almost.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Jess	And then the woman came to her, the woman that she had seen drawn in the Boys’ Quarters. She was flying alongside a stream of debris and paper, and the first thing [MASK] saw coming out of the darkness was her arms.
<name>Titilope</name>	Titilope	Titiola	She could just envision her mother asking: What kind of a name is that? “[MASK]?” her mother said with interest, pronouncing the name properly. “A Yoruba girl, then? Who are her parents?”
<name>Jessy</name>	Jessy	TillyTilly	The words were making her feel fresher, coating her in dew [MASK] was speaking insistently, and her words were layering over and under the storyteller’s. “. . .Jessy, you guessed without me explaining that I’m . . . that I’m not really here.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jess	Where on earth would she get that idea from?” [MASK] sat on the very edge of a chair, craning to hear where her mother’s voice was coining from. The muffled quality of it suggested that she had her head in a kitchen cupboard.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bose	She considered bending to scratch it, but that would have meant letting go of [MASK]’s hand, so she ignored it as she looked up at the points of lantern light that were already blazing from some windows in her grandfather’s house.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Jessamy	Then, when they drew closer, she saw her mother’s tight expression of anger, and saw her crumple into tears. “Oh my God, [MASK]! You are so selfish! Where on earth have you been?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alison	Then: “Besides, it’s better not to have another fight in the toilets.” “Yeah, also, I don’t think she’s, like, speaking to you,” [MASK] chimed in, to laughter from the others.
<name>Tzitziyolara</name>	Tzitziyolara	Titiola	She pronounced it Tee-tee-yo-la, wincing as she said it, knowing that it sounded all wrong in her mouth, jarring. The girl’s head snapped up, her eyes widening. “[MASK],” she said sharply.
<name>Lila</name>	Lila	Jess	But all [MASK] could do once she was herself again, and in one place, and whole, was scream. It wasn’t proper screaming, but the result of a kind of pressure on her lungs so that she made a piercing noise like steam whistling out.
<name>Abena</name>	Abena	Funke	She could hear bustling activity on the kitchen floor and smell cooking; it smelt like her Aunty [MASK]’s speciality of smoked fish, palm oil and spinach stew. Then she remembered that it was Sunday, and that it was her grandfather’s turn to host his Baptist prayer group.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jess	Are you scared of her?” [MASK] unclenched her hands when she realised that her fingernails were spearing her palms. “Of course I am! But I try not to think about it. I think she’s going to—like, get me.”
<name>Antoinette</name>	Antoinette	Jess	“Pssst!” [MASK], who had run up the stairs ahead of her mother to prepare herself for the first two fits of The Hunting of the Snark read out in a Yoruba accent, stopped short before entering her darkened bedroom. The sound didn’t come from there.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Jess	It has no value; in my eyes, it is to confuse . . .” “Confuse, dissemble, obfuscate,” [MASK] whispered. “What?” “Dissemble and obfuscate—they’re two different words, same meaning: ‘to confuse.’ ”
<name>Dolores</name>	Dolores	TillyTilly	Could she really have taken it off the wall and flung it to the floor so that the glass sprayed out in jigsaw-puzzle pieces, then calmly put the empty frame back on the wall, at an angle? And not remember? The trouble was that, with [MASK], it was possible.
<name>Moaning Myrtle</name>	Moaning Myrtle	TillyTilly	[MASK] wasn’t even winded; she sat down and, assuming a cross-legged position, started taking things out of the bag. “Never mind,” she said, “at least you came second!” And she nearly bent herself double with her wheezing laugh.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Jess	It was a hot day in June when [MASK] returned from the park through the back door into the kitchen, and noticed that there was an empty coffee cup in the sink. It was her father’s. Puzzled but happy, she smiled, feeling as if this was somehow a gift.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Jess	[MASK] began to feel bewildered. She swayed a little on her feet, tired from the sun, and sat down on the bottom step, looking thoughtfully at the girl. Clearly she had to ask something that would make her give an answer instead of another question.
