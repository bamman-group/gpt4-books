<name>others</name>	others	Starbuck	He knew, for example, that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was over [MASK], yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual mastership; for to the purely spiritual, the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation.
<name>Jonah</name>	Jonah	Jonah	But this objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German exegetist supposes that [MASK] must have taken refuge in the floating body of a dead whale-- even as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them.
<name>Silver</name>	Silver	Steelkilt	"'So I am, but take that.' The mate was in the very act of striking, when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm. He paused: and then pausing no more, made good his word, spite of [MASK]'s threat, whatever that might have been.
<name>Macbeth</name>	Macbeth	Starbuck!--	Strangest problems of life seem clearing; but clouds sweep between--Is my journey's end coming? My legs feel faint; like his who has footed it all day. Feel thy heart,--beats it yet? Stir thyself, [MASK] stave it off--move, move!
<name>Starbuck</name>	Starbuck	Starbuck	[MASK]'s astir," said the rigger. "He's a lively chief mate that; good man, and a pious; but all alive now, I must turn to." And so saying he went on deck, and we followed.
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Sir?--Clay	why that's--but no;--a very tidy, and, I may say, an extremely gentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here, carpenter;--or would'st thou rather work in clay? [MASK]? clay, sir? That's mud; we leave clay to ditchers, sir.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ishmael	Too expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within. But go on, [MASK], said I at last; don't you hear?
<name>Ahab</name>	Ahab	Tashtego	So with stun-sail piled on stun-sail, we sailed along, driving these leviathans before us; when, of a sudden, the voice of [MASK] was heard, loudly directing attention to something in our wake. Corresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in our rear.
<name>Steelkilt</name>	Steelkilt	Steelkilt	But [MASK] and his desperadoes were too much for them all; they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck, where, hastily slewing about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass, these sea-Parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade.
<name>Steelkilt</name>	Steelkilt	Bildad	When [MASK] was a chief-mate, to have his drab-colored eye intently looking at you, made you feel completely nervous, till you could clutch something--a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at something or other, never mind what.
<name>The Ocean</name>	The Ocean	jolly	Oh! [MASK] is the gale, And a joker is the whale, A' flourishin' his tail,-- Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh! The scud all a flyin',
<name>Stubb</name>	Stubb	Starbuck	Thou art always prating to me, [MASK], about those miserly owners, as if the owners were my conscience. But look ye, the only real owner of anything is its commander; and hark ye, my conscience is in this ship's keel.--On deck!"
<name>Stubb</name>	Stubb	Tashtego	The ship was now kept away from the wind, and she went gently rolling before it. [MASK] reporting that the whales had gone down heading to leeward, we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of our bows.
<name>Fedallah</name>	Fedallah	Fedallah	But be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordinate phantoms soon found their place among the crew, though still as it were somehow distinct from them, yet that hair-turbaned [MASK] remained a muffled mystery to the last.
<name>Ahab</name>	Ahab	Fedallah	[MASK] first descried this jet. For of these moonlight nights, it was his wont to mount to the main-mast head, and stand a look-out there, with the same precision as if it had been day.
<name>Queequeg</name>	Queequeg	Bildad	"Whew!" he whistled at last--"the squall's gone off to leeward, I think. [MASK], thou used to be good at sharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs the grindstone.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Pip	"Wonder if he means me?--complimentary--poor lad!--I could go hang myself. Any way, for the present, I'll quit [MASK]'s vicinity. I can stand the rest, for they have plain wits; but he's too crazy-witty for my sanity.
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Stubb	By this time [MASK] was over the side, and getting into his boat, hailed the Guernsey-man to this effect,--that having a long tow-line in his boat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out the lighter whale of the two from the ship's side.
<name>Cook</name>	Cook	Fleece	There, now ye may go." But [MASK] had hardly got three paces off, when he was recalled. "Cook, give me cutlets for supper to-morrow night in the mid-watch. D'ye hear? away you sail then.--Halloa! stop!
<name>You</name>	You	Noah	The same--the same!-- the same to [MASK] as to me. There's a soft shower to leeward. Such lovely leewardings! They must lead somewhere-- to something else than common land, more palmy than the palms.
<name>the heart</name>	the heart	Ahab	Inward they turned upon the soul, especially when the still mild hours of eve came on; then, memory shot her crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights. And all these subtle agencies, more and more they wrought on [MASK]'s texture.
<name>Ahab</name>	Ahab	Ahab	CHAPTER 37 Sunset The cabin; by the stern windows; [MASK] sitting alone, and gazing out. I leave a white and turbid wake; pale waters, paler cheeks, where'er I sail. The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track; let them; but first I pass.
<name>Queequeg</name>	Queequeg	Holloa	The strong vapor now completely filling the contracted hole, it began to tell upon him. He breathed with a sort of muffledness; then seemed troubled in the nose; then revolved over once or twice; then sat up and rubbed his eyes. "[MASK]!"
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Stubb	How you tink to hear, 'spose you keep up such a dam slapping and bitin' dare?" "Cook," cried [MASK], collaring him, "I won't have that swearing. Talk to 'em gentlemanly." Once more the sermon proceeded.
<name>the</name> (There is no proper name that fits in this context. The sentence is referring to a specific elephant, but it is not given a name.)	the (There is no proper name that fits in this context. The sentence is referring to a specific elephant, but it is not given a name.)	Darmonodes	What tenderness there is in that preliminary touch! Had this tail any prehensile power, I should straightway bethink me of [MASK]' elephant that so frequented the flower-market, and with low salutations presented nosegays to damsels, and then caressed their zones.
<name>Ahab</name>	Ahab	Stubb	Yes; both pipes smoked out!" and withdrawing his own from his mouth, [MASK] scattered the dead ashes over the water; and, for a moment, stood thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made. CHAPTER 62 The Dart A word concerning an incident in the last chapter.
<name>Queequeg</name>	Queequeg	Halloa	It looks like a real live leg, filed down to nothing but the core; he'll be standing on this to-morrow; he'll be taking altitudes on it. [MASK]! I almost forgot the little oval slate, smoothed ivory, where he figures up the latitude.
<name>Ahab</name>	Ahab	Fedallah	In this attitude the White Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse. With unastonished eyes [MASK] gazed, and crossed his arms; but the tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other's heads to gain the uttermost stern.
<name>Greenlanders</name>	Greenlanders	Whales	"Why, thou monkey," said a harpooneer to one of these lads, "we've been cruising now hard upon three years, and thou hast not raised a whale yet. [MASK] are scarce as hen's teeth whenever thou art up here."
<name>Uncle Remus</name>	Uncle Remus	Stubb	Well," said [MASK], helping himself freely meanwhile; "I shall now go back to the subject of this steak. In the first place, how old are you, cook?" "What dat do wid de 'teak, " said the old black, testily.
<name>Phelps</name>	Phelps	Doubloon	There's a clue somewhere; wait a bit; hist--hark! By Jove, I have it! Look you, [MASK], your zodiac here is the life of man in one round chapter; and now I'll read it off, straight out of the book.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Cato	With a philosophical flourish [MASK] throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Ahab	[MASK] dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks. Vacantly eyeing the heaving whale for a moment, he issued the usual orders for securing it for the night, and then handing his lantern to a seaman, went his way into the cabin, and did not come forward again until morning.
<name>Ahab</name>	Ahab	Queequeg!--Queequeg!"--all	That's strange, thought I; but at any rate, since the harpoon stands yonder, and he seldom or never goes abroad without it, therefore he must be inside here, and no possible mistake. "[MASK] still. Something must have happened. Apoplexy!
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Ahab	And all this mixes with your most mystic mood; so that fact and fancy, half-way meeting, interpenetrate, and form one seamless whole. Nor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at least as temporary an effect on [MASK].
<name>Aristotle</name>	Aristotle	Marius	thou Chilian whale, marked like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back! In plain prose, here are four whales as well known to the students of Cetacean History as [MASK] or Sylla to the classic scholar. But this is not all.
<name>Queequeg</name>	Queequeg	Zoroaster	An awe that cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of this waning savage, and saw as strange things in his face, as any beheld who were bystanders when [MASK] died. For whatever is truly wondrous and fearful in man, never yet was put into words or books.
<name>Ahab</name>	Ahab	Ahab	The Pagan leopards--the unrecking and unworshipping things, that live; and seek, and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel! The crew, man, the crew! Are they not one and all with [MASK], in this matter of the whale?
<name>Captain Ahab</name>	Captain Ahab	Radney	I wonder if he'd give a poor devil like me the model of his nose.' "'Damn your eyes! what's that pump stopping for?' roared [MASK], pretending not to have heard the sailors' talk. 'Thunder away at it!'
<name>Father</name>	Father	Ahab!--shudder	again!--drive off that hawk! see! he pecks--he tears the vane"-- pointing to the red flag flying at the main-truck--"Ha, he soars away with it!--Where's the old man now? see'st thou that sight, oh [MASK], shudder!"
<name>Ahab</name>	Ahab	Ahab	And though the other boats, unharmed, still hovered hard by; still they dared not pull into the eddy to strike, lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of the jeopardized castaways, [MASK] and all; nor in that case could they themselves hope to escape.
<name>Queequeg</name>	Queequeg	Stubb	As a general thing, therefore, you must first get fast to a whale, before any pitchpoling comes into play. Look now at [MASK]; a man who from his humorous, deliberate coolness and equanimity in the direst emergencies, was specially qualified to excel in pitchpoling.
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Don	"'I am, [MASK].' "'Then I entreat you, tell me if to the best of your own convictions, this your story is in substance really true? It is so passing wonderful! Did you get it from an unquestionable source?
<name>Ahab</name>	Ahab	Ahab	But when [MASK] cried out to the steersman to take new turns with the line, and hold it so; and commanded the crew to turn round on their seats, and tow the boat up to the mark; the moment the treacherous line felt that double strain and tug, it snapped in the empty air!
<name>Queequeg</name>	Queequeg	Queequeg	so much-- for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their streets,-- but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms. But we heeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and [MASK] now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs.
<name>Ahab</name>	Ahab	Ahab	"Heading East at this hour in the morning, and the sun astern?" Upon this every soul was confounded; for the phenomenon just then observed by [MASK] had unaccountably escaped every one else; but its very blinding palpableness must have been the cause.
<name>Phoebus</name>	Phoebus	Earls	The starred and stately nights seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely pride, the memory of their absent conquering [MASK], the golden helmeted suns! For sleeping man, 'twas hard to choose between such winsome days and such seducing nights.
<name>Queequeg</name>	Queequeg	Queequeg	"[MASK] no care what god made him shark," said the savage, agonizingly lifting his hand up and down; "wedder Fejee god or Nantucket god; but de god wat made shark must be one dam Ingin." CHAPTER 67 Cutting In
<name>Tashtego</name>	Tashtego	Queequeg	I have hinted that I would often jerk poor [MASK] from between the whale and the ship--where he would occasionally fall, from the incessant rolling and swaying of both. But this was not the only jamming jeopardy he was exposed to.
<name>who</name>	who	whither	The subterranean miner that works in us all, how can one tell [MASK] leads his shaft by the ever shifting, muffled sound of his pick? Who does not feel the irresistible arm drag? What skiff in tow of a seventy-four can stand still?
<name>Starbuck</name>	Starbuck	Macey	Now, while [MASK], the mate, was standing up in his boat's bow, and with all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the whale, and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance, lo!
<name>Ahab</name>	Ahab	Gabriel	So strongly did he work upon his disciples among the crew, that at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if [MASK] was sent from the ship, not a man of them would remain. He was therefore forced to relinquish his plan.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Queequeg	and he wears it like a gentleman; but I make a bandbox for [MASK], and he won't put his head into it. Are all my pains to go for nothing with that coffin? And now I'm ordered to make a life-buoy of it.
<name>Queequeg</name>	Queequeg	Queequeg	I wonder he don't wake." [MASK] removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and lighted his tomahawk pipe. I sat at the feet. We kept the pipe passing over the sleeper, from one to the other.
<name>Israel</name>	Israel	Queequeg	"Never mind him," said I, "[MASK], come on." But he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my shoulder, said--"Did ye see anything looking like men going towards that ship a while ago?"
<name>Ahab</name>	Ahab	Pip	I go below; let me not see that thing here when I return again. Now, then, [MASK], we'll talk this over; I do suck most wondrous philosophies from thee! Some unknown conduits from the unknown worlds must empty into thee!" CHAPTER 128
<name>Ahab</name>	Ahab	Stubb	she blows!--she blows!--right ahead!" was now the mast-head cry. "Aye, aye!" cried [MASK], "I knew it--ye can't escape--blow on and split your spout, O whale! the mad fiend himself is after ye!
<name>Ahab</name>	Ahab	Ahab	So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of [MASK] affect me, and the livid brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments I hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood.
<name>Jehovah</name>	Jehovah	Jonah	And now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables; and from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all careening, glides to sea. That ship, my friends, was the first of recorded smugglers! the contraband was [MASK].
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Queequeg	And right in among those sharks was [MASK]; who often pushed them aside with his floundering feet. A thing altogether incredible were it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man.
<name>Queequeg</name>	Queequeg	Elijah	"Morning to ye, shipmates, morning." "Morning it is," said I. "Come along, Queequeg, let's leave this crazy man. But stop, tell me your name, will you?" "[MASK]."
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Starbuck	Soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist; neither ship nor boat to be seen. "Give way, men," whispered [MASK], drawing still further aft the sheet of his sail; "there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall comes.
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Begone	[MASK]! Let it leak! I'm all aleak myself. Aye! leaks in leaks! not only full of leaky casks, but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship; and that's a far worse plight than the Pequod's, man.
<name>The Captain</name>	The Captain	Ahab	D'ye see him?" and if the reply was No, sir! straightway he commanded them to lift him to his perch. In this way the day wore on; [MASK], now aloft and motionless; anon, unrestingly pacing the planks.
<name>Ahab</name>	Ahab	Ahab	Caught and twisted--corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose harpoons and lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of [MASK]'s boat. Only one thing could be done.
<name>Billy Budd</name>	Billy Budd	Jonah	"'Who's there?' cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making out his papers for the Customs--'Who's there?' Oh! how that harmless question mangles [MASK]! For the instant he almost turns to flee again. But he rallies.
<name>Friday</name>	Friday	Queequeg	there is good cheer in store for you, [MASK]. For now, as with blue lips and blood-shot eyes the exhausted savage at last climbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over the side; the steward advances, and with a benevolent, consolatory glance hands him--what?
<name>Ahab</name>	Ahab	Lo	A stark, bewildered feeling, as of death, came over me. Convulsively my hands grasped the tiller, but with the crazy conceit that the tiller was, somehow, in some enchanted way, inverted. My God! what is the matter with me? thought I. [MASK]!
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	I--"broke	"I'll break it for him," said I, now flying into a passion again at this unaccountable farrago of the landlord's. "It's broke a'ready," said he. "Broke," said [MASK], do you mean?"
<name>Old Dan</name>	Old Dan	Queequeg	Don't you know you might have killed that chap?" "What him say?" said [MASK], as he mildly turned to me. "He say," said I, "that you came near kill-e that man there," pointing to the still shivering greenhorn.
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Derick	Blinding vapors of foam and white-fire! The three boats, in the first fury of the whale's headlong rush, bumped the German's aside with such force, that both [MASK] and his baffled harpooneer were spilled out, and sailed over by the three flying keels.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Stubb	any man with half an eye can be sensible." "I don't know that, [MASK]. You sometimes find it rather hard." "Yes, when a fellow's soaked through, it's hard to be sensible, that's a fact.
<name>Stubb</name>	Stubb	Queequeg	You'll starve; you'll kill yourself, [MASK]." But not a word did he reply. Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep; and no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Stubb	"Why," said [MASK], eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals, "you may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me, though I don't pretend to be a judge." "
<name>Queequeg</name>	Queequeg	Belshazzar	"The old man seems to read [MASK]'s awful writing. I have never marked the coin inspectingly. He goes below; let me read. A dark valley between three mighty, heaven-abiding peaks, that almost seem the Trinity, in some faint earthly symbol.
<name>Queequeg</name>	Queequeg	Queequeg	But [MASK], he had a mortal, barbaric smack of the lip in eating-- an ugly sound enough--so much so, that the trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms.
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Queequeg	In a word, it was [MASK]'s conceit, that if a man made up his mind to live, mere sickness could not kill him: nothing but a whale, or a gale, or some violent, ungovernable, unintelligent destroyer of that sort.
<name>Ahab</name>	Ahab	Ahab	And, so full of his thought was [MASK], that at every uniform turn that he made, now at the main-mast and now at the binnacle, you could almost see that thought turn in him as he turned, and pace in him as he paced; so completely possessing him, indeed,
<name>Ahab</name>	Ahab	Ahab	There I saw him, on the Line, last season." "And he took that arm off, did he?" asked [MASK], now sliding down from the capstan, and resting on the Englishman's shoulder, as he did so. "
<name>Queequeg</name>	Queequeg	Flask	Thank ye. They laugh at long-togs so, [MASK]; but seems to me, a long-tailed coat ought always to be worn in all storms afloat. The tails tapering down that way, serve to carry off the water, d'ye see.
<name>Ahab</name>	Ahab	Ahab	One after another they peered in, for nothing but their own eyes could persuade such ignorance as theirs, and one after another they slunk away. In his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph, you then saw [MASK] in all his fatal pride. CHAPTER 125
<name>Queequeg</name>	Queequeg	Queequeg	Nor did I at all object to the hint from [MASK] that perhaps it were best to strike a light, seeing that we were so wide awake; and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk.
<name>Hooper</name>	Hooper	Ho	All four boats gave chase again; but the whale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared. "In good time, the Town-[MASK] reached her port--a savage, solitary place-- where no civilized creature resided.
<name>Ahab</name>	Ahab	Ahab	For, thought [MASK], while even the highest earthly felicities ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them, but, at bottom, all heartwoes, a mystic significance, and, in some men, an archangelic grandeur; so do their diligent tracings-out not belie the obvious deduction.
<name>Ahab</name>	Ahab	Ahab	But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon, [MASK] seemed not to mark this wild bird; nor, indeed, would any one else have marked it much, it being no uncommon circumstance; only now almost the least heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every sight.
<name>Jonah</name>	Jonah	Jonah	While he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking, slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher, who, when describing [MASK]'s sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself.
<name>me</name>	me	Tophet	It's ominous, thinks I. A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port; tombstones staring at me in the whalemen's chapel, and here a gallows! and a pair of prodigious black pots too! Are these last throwing out oblique hints touching [MASK]?
<name>Don Quixote</name>	Don Quixote	Blackstone	But that did in nowise mend the matter, or at all soften the hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of [MASK]. At length one of them, after long scratching about for his ideas, made bold to speak, "Please, sir, who is the Lord Warden?"
<name>Ahab</name>	Ahab	Pip	But ere he entered his cabin, a light, unnatural, half-bantering, yet most piteous sound was heard. Oh! [MASK], thy wretched laugh, thy idle but unresting eye; all thy strange mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the melancholy ship, and mocked it!
<name>Ahab</name>	Ahab	Starbuck	Shall we be towed by him to the infernal world? Oh, oh,-- Impiety and blasphemy to hunt him more!" "[MASK], of late I've felt strangely moved to thee; ever since that hour we both saw--thou know'st what, in one another's eyes.
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Lazarus	Besides, all the days I should now live would be as good as the days that [MASK] lived after his resurrection; a supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case may be. I survived myself; my death and burial were locked up in my chest.
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Starbuck	Take off thine eye! more intolerable than fiends' glarings is a doltish stare! So, so; thou reddenest and palest; my heat has melted thee to anger-glow. But look ye, [MASK], what is said in heat, that thing unsays itself.
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Derick	At this moment [MASK] was in the act of pitching his lamp-feeder at the advancing boats, and also his oil-can; perhaps with the double view of retarding his rivals' way, and at the same time economically accelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss.
<name>Stubb</name>	Stubb	Queequeg	But avast!" putting her hand in her side pocket, "here's a key that'll fit, I guess; let's see." And with that, she turned it in the lock; but alas! [MASK]'s supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within.
<name>Ahab</name>	Ahab	Queequeg	Towards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances and rituals must be over, I went up to his room and knocked at the door; but no answer. I tried to open it, but it was fastened inside. "[MASK]," said I softly through the key-hole:--all silent.
<name>Caliban</name>	Caliban	Queequeg	Nay, to this very hour, I often puzzle myself with it. Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to those which I experienced on waking up and seeing [MASK]'s pagan arm thrown round me.
<name>Friday</name>	Friday	Queequeg	Well was it that the Typhoons did not visit them then. Now, at this time it was that my poor pagan companion, and fast bosom-friend, [MASK], was seized with a fever, which brought him nigh to his endless end.
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Rose	yes, that's the word! why don't you pack those whales in ice while you're working at 'em? But joking aside, though; do you know, [MASK]-bud, that it's all nonsense trying to get any oil out of such whales?
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Quohog	By the great anchor, what a harpoon he's got there! looks like good stuff that; and he handles it about right. I say, [MASK], or whatever your name is, did you ever stand in the head of a whale-boat?
<name>Ahab</name>	Ahab	Albicore	that smiling sky, and this unsounded sea! Look! see yon [MASK]! who put it into him to chase and fang that flying-fish? Where do murderers go, man! Who's to doom, when the judge himself is dragged to the bar?
