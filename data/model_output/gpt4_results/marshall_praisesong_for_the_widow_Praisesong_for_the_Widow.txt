<name>Adah</name>	Adah	Marion	In the talk [MASK] had given along with the film she had spoken of something called a New Yam, of a golden stool that descended from the sky, and of ancestors who were to be fed. Moreover, the scene in front of her also vaguely called to mind something from her own life.
<name>Château</name>	Château	Juba	“Oui,” he cried. “[MASK]! You knows it?” “Yes ... no ... I mean I remember hearing or reading about it somewhere ...” The man’s relief at this was so great it weakened him and he had to sit down.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Milda	A stride designed to cover an entire continent in a day. With the shift to the creole dances the mood in the yard changed and it began to fill up. From around the comer of the house came a number of new arrivals, most of them young people [MASK]’s age.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Avey	It was to take [MASK] years to forget the look on the face under the field hat, the disappointment and sadness there. If she could have reached up that day and snatched her question like a fly out of the air and swallowed it whole, she would have done so.
<name>Alas</name>	Alas	Toomuch	What kind of bargain had they struck? How much had they foolishly handed over in exchange for the things they had gained?—an exchange they could have avoided altogether had they been on their guard! [MASK]!“. . . the trouble with these Negroes out here . .
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Jay	[MASK] saying it with amaze- ment at the Saturday night pretend dances when he would turn the floor over to her. Yet for all the sudden unleashing of her body she was being careful to observe the old rule: Not once did the soles of her feet leave the ground.
<name>Selina</name>	Selina	Marion	Once, years ago, when she had been telling someone about her days as an organizer for the union on her job, [MASK], overhearing her, had cried—she had been no more than twelve at the time—“Oh, how I wish I had known you then!”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Clarice	Their first day back they would splurge and have lunch at the seafood restaurant near the office. She had it in mind to say something on this order crossing the room, to assure [MASK] that she was in no way to blame.
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Mark	“ ‘Affrighted. ’ [MASK] used the word ‘affrighted. ’ What he really meant beloved was ‘scared half to death. ’ That’s what they were, the two poor dumbstruck Marys. But they were also, I believe it, filled with wonder.
<name>German</name>	German	Patois	“I tried asking them about a taxi, but they all spoke [MASK]—at least that’s what it sounded like ...” She tried not to think of the man who had spoken English and the scare he had given her. He nodded.
<name>His</name>	His	Wait!”—a	Is you a Manding like my mother, maybe? The Long-foot people we calls them . . . “[MASK] smile began to work its way through the maze of lines around his mouth—“don’ tell me you’s a Chamba like myself. . . ?”
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Avey	Should have turned and run the other way when he saw her coming. Finally, with their voices stranded on a peak from which they would never, it seemed, find the way down, an inflamed and trembling [MASK] stepped to within inches of him.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Jay	(“Oh-oh, here come your folks again, [MASK].” "My folks? Who told you I was colored, woman? I’m just passing to see what it feels like.” Vaudeville-like jokes which they sprinkled like juju powders around the bed to protect them.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	pappy	he’d ask her, “*. . . an’/who’s [MASK]’s chile . . . ?’”Then: . . Wisht you could alius know/ease an’ cleah skies;/Wisht you could stay jes' a chile on my breas'—/Little brown baby wif spa’klin’ eyes!”’
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Sis	Then, in a softer vein, she reached down and straightened the wide collar of the middy blouse, tightened the ribbons on the braids and, holding out her hand for [MASK] to take, she led her over to where the second-graders were lining up in the yard.
<name>John</name>	John	Jay	For close to a half-hour she practically took and hurled her body down the steep steps and then up again, down and up repeatedly until she finally collapsed on the landing outside their door. All to no avail. [MASK]’s face when she told him had mirrored everything she felt.
<name>Lord</name>	Lord	Lord	With the new dress on, her hair freshly marcelled and her face powdered, she didn’t look as if she had been up half the night frying chicken, making potato salad and preparing the inevitable rice for her father. [MASK], deliver me from these Gullahs and their rice rice rice!
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Marion	If forced to, she would be as tyrannical in demanding that they be sent as her great-aunt had been with her. And [MASK] could bring some of the children from her school, her “sweetest lepers,” as she called them.
<name>Myrtle</name>	Myrtle	Clarice	[MASK] had grown anxious. “I don’t know,” she said and she was genuinely puzzled. “Seems I have a little indigestion, although I don’t see how, I hardly ate anything. I should be all right in a minute.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Hello	“[MASK], is there anyone around . . . ?” Her parched throat could scarcely manage the words. She was about to call out again when a voice, sharp, thin, hoarse with age, came from behind the partition. “The place is closed, oui.”
<name>Sancho</name>	Sancho	Juba	One by one his defects and the wear and tear of his eighty- or perhaps even ninety-odd years fell away and he was dancing after a time with the strength and agility of someone half his age. "We di la wen [MASK] . .
<name>Patrice</name>	Patrice	Patois	She tried not to think of the man who had spoken English and the scare he had given her. He nodded. “Oui, [MASK], creole, whatever you want to call it,” he said. “Is just some African mix-up something.
<name>Whitey</name>	Whitey	Charlie	I was only having a little taste with the fellas, that’s all. A man works all week taking [MASK]’s shit he gots to relax hisself a little come the weekend. You know what it’s like out there . . . Whore? What whore?
<name>Frenchman's Bend</name>	Frenchman's Bend	Tatem	Only their heels rose and then fell with each step, striking the worn pineboard with a beat that was as precise and intricate as a drum’s, and which as the night wore on and the Shout became more animated could be heard all over [MASK].
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Clarice	For the first time in the twenty years they had known each other, something about [MASK] both frightened and offended her. She found herself wanting to back away from her as from something contagious; or to make a sign (if she had known one) to ward off some dangerous hex.
<name>Mariequita</name>	Mariequita	Sylvie	“Name of [MASK]. Now that was one girl lived only for the excursion, oui! Months before the time she would be busy making more dresses and buying more presents to take to her family over there. All her talk was ’bout the excursion.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Jay	That afternoon when they awakened she had started to undress, only to have [MASK] stop her. He had done it himself, slowly removing each piece of her clothing and laying it on a nearby chair, his hands and lips caressing each new place he bared before continuing; talking his talk.
<name>Mrs. Turpin</name>	Mrs. Turpin	Tatem	And long after she had stopped going to [MASK] and the old woman was dead, she was to catch herself flinching whenever she remembered the voice with the quietly dangerous note that had issued finally from under the wide hat brim.
<name>Josephine</name>	Josephine	Avey	“Stones!” He hurled the word like a fiery meteor out over their heads. His restless tread, shaking the pulpit’s weakened floorboards, reverberated through the nave, and [MASK] felt the rocking of the building increase around her.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Avey	The silence outdoors only served to magnify the sounds inside the apartment as [MASK], the children in bed, took up her angry vigil on a chair at the living room window. The ticking of the clock, whose every stroke added to his lateness, seemed louder.
<name>Hitler</name>	Hitler	Jay	World War I. [MASK] didn’t wear his quite as full. The shape was the same, with the thickness that more than filled the space above his lip tapering off into a pair of wings that curled down at the tips to embrace the comers of his mouth.
<name>Emmy</name>	Emmy	Annawilda	And later, in addition to readying herself for school, she bathed and dressed [MASK] (which was no mean feat), and afterwards packed the bag with the bottles and other things. Some tasks, like the dishes and helping to clean the house, were assigned her; others she simply did.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Jay	The year 1957, twelve years after that snowy Tuesday night, found [MASK] with a solid and growing clientele, his name in small print on the window of a lawyer’s office where he rented desk space, and with plans in mind to expand into insurance and real estate.
<name>Nyabinghi</name>	Nyabinghi	Marion	” What was the man going on about? What were these names? Each one made her head ache all the more. She thought she heard in them the faint rattle of the necklace of cowrie shells and amber [MASK] always wore.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Jay	And this warmth and the faint stinging reached up the entire length of her thighs. (Their length and shapeliness would excite him even when she was dressed and he couldn’t see them, [MASK], talking his talk, used to say.)
<name>Let</name>	Let	Lemme	“[MASK] tell you about ’em. There’s the stone of selfishness for one. The stone of hypocrisy for another: Folks that come to church on a Sunday and then go out and do some of every kind of wicked' ness beginning Monday right on down to next Sunday.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Grace	And as she lay there exhausted with no sign of the hoped-for blood, she actually considered for a moment going back on the promise she had made to herself at the death of her friend, [MASK], with whom she had graduated from high school.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Marion	With the last of her strength she reached under her dress and, fumbling, unhooked the long-line girdle. (Her hair-shirt [MASK] insisted on calling it.) That was all she could manage before collapsing onto the bed. “Too much!
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Sylvie	They were gifts he treated lightly. Then, wistfully: “I did like her a lot though. [MASK].” He spoke the name in the intimate way he might have those times when they had been in bed together. “She had nice ways.
<name>Myra</name>	Myra	Annawilda	His hands, the gloves still on them, appeared to be clapped over his ears to shut out [MASK]’s prolonged shriek from the bedroom. Any second and he would be at the door. A swift turn and he would have snatched it open.
<name>Queenie</name>	Queenie	Milda	“Go ahead.” She kept on urging her until finally [MASK], with a big-boned gracefulness, slowly reached up and began unpinning the maid’s cap on her head. “I gon’ dance just this one then and come right back,” she said.
<name>Unceasing</name>	Unceasing	Clangorous	Their outstretched arms hailed the sound of the struck iron, which by now was on a par with the voice of the drums. [MASK], insistent, soaring, the iron was sending out a call loud enough to be heard from one end of the archipelago to the other.
<name>Bonnie</name>	Bonnie	Sis	Without his actually moving, he appeared to be slowly backing toward the door to the hall which stood just a few feet behind him. Moving away from her and the tearful [MASK], whom she still held pinned to her side, away from the huge melon of a stomach.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Avey	As the one who made the decisions as to where they ate, slept and how they spent the time on board, she took it as a veiled criticism of her planning whenever they voiced even the slightest complaint. “What is it, [MASK]?”
<name>Johnson's</name>	Johnson's	Johnson	The cloth had absorbed the perspiration with its slight odor of curdled milk, as well as the staleness of the [MASK]’s Baby Powder caked in the creases of baby fat, and had begun to smell. It needed to be stripped, given a sponge off, then patted dry, oiled and freshly powdered.
<name>Creole</name>	Creole	Patois	“They can speak the King’s English good as me and you but the minute they set foot on the wharf for the excursion is only [MASK] you hearing. ” The bright polished surface of the sky appeared to reflect the myriad colors and patterns of their clothes and the umbrellas the women were carrying.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Clarice	When she and [MASK] had refused to go along, the woman had fanned them down in front of everyone from the deck of the sloop and sailed away. “Excuse me, do you know where I might find a taxi?”
<name>Mallory</name>	Mallory	Clarice	somethin’ deep’s behind this mess. You can’t tell me different...” She gave her a wide berth, the way she might have some mildly demented bag woman railing to herself on the city’s streets. Her unhurried step led her across to [MASK] at the divider.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Clarice	But when she returned with the steward to collect her bags after leaving the purser’s office, it was clear that neither of them would be going ashore. [MASK], still stubbornly holding herself to blame for what had happened, had not moved from over near the divider.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sis	A swift turn and he would have snatched it open. Before either she or [MASK] could think to run after him or find the voice to call him back, he would be racing down the stairs, taking them three and four at a time in his haste to be gone.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Avey	Then, abruptly, her manner would change, her anger would vanish and, bending close to [MASK], tears in her eyes, she would quietly beg her not to turn her back on them, not to forget those like herself stranded out there with the men who just wouldn’t do right.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Jay	[MASK] might have felt himself surrounded by a pantheon of the most ancient deities who had made their temple the tunneled darkness of his wife’s flesh. And he held back, trembling a little, not knowing quite how to conduct himself in their presence.
<name>Kernaghan</name>	Kernaghan	Johnson	Jerome [MASK] used to say.) The warmth, the stinging sensation that was both pleasure and pain passed up through the emptiness at her center. Until finally they reached her heart. And as they encircled her heart and it responded, there was the sense of a chord being struck.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Sis	She was glad that what she did was just a job, something that paid her a salary while leaving her to her own thoughts most of the day. Anything else would have been too much. That morning she thought of [MASK] in the schoolyard. Her little weary sigh.
<name>James</name>	James	Jay	[MASK]! Talking that talk until he turned her into a wanton with her nightgown bunched up around her neck like an airy boa she had donned as a fetish to feed his pleasure, or abandoned altogether on the floor beside the bed.
<name>Chéri</name>	Chéri	Ida	Then, suddenly: “[MASK], doux-doux, qu’est-ce qu’il y a? Ma’ch6! Ma’ch6!”—a man’s voice sounding just inches from her ear; and this time it was nothing imagined, a hand on her elbow was actually steering her out into the crowd.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Jay	Moreover (and again she only sensed this in the dimmest way), something in those small rites, an ethos they held in common, had reached back beyond her life and beyond [MASK]’s to join them to the vast unknown lineage that had made their being possible.
<name>Arkansas</name>	Arkansas	Tatem	And they was singing by then, so my gran’ said. When they realized there wasn’t nothing between them and home but some water and that wasn’t giving ’em no trouble they got so tickled they started in to singing. You could hear ’em clear across [MASK] ’cording to her.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Jay	[MASK]. He went about those years like a runner in the heat of a long and punishing marathon, his every muscle tensed and straining, his body being pushed to its limits; and on his face a clenched and dogged look that was to become almost his sole expression over the years.
<name>the door</name>	the door	Sis	Just moments before he had steeled himself and stepped forward, gathering her to him, she had sensed him, hadn’t she, slowly backing away from her and [MASK], easing toward the door to the hall behind him, a man eager to be gone.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Avey	It’s that powerful, [MASK], that strong.” He teased her about what and what he was going to do when she finally permitted him in, how he was going to carry on, tear up, go out of his mind.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Jay	Or the unsparing, puritanical tone that had developed in his voice. Or the things he had taken to saying. Whatever it was, it eventually became impossible for her, even when she tried forcing herself, to think the name [MASK].
<name>James</name>	James	Jay	Whenever the Five Blind Boys sang “Dry Bones,” [MASK] would join their complex harmonizing, forcing his modest baritone down to a bass: . . knee bone connected to the leg bone/ leg bone connected to the ankle bone . . .
<name>Eventually</name>	Eventually	Oui	I wasn’t setting foot there. Still she kept after me. Every year ’round this time there would be a big noise between us about the excursion. We fell out over it finally. [MASK], she got fed up with me and found herself a next boyfriend.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Annawilda	How would she manage without her? There would be no training that other one though! Her fingers paused on the typewriter, she shook her head, frowning, yet also half-smiling. [MASK] with her demands and her temper! But with her genius also.
<name>Susan</name>	Susan	Susan	—[MASK] Sontag 1 On an old-fashioned buffet in the main room of the house lay the sacred elements: a lighted candle in a holder and, next to it on a plate, a roasted ear of com fresh from the harvest.
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Avey	Until finally, without her having anything to do with it, her hand suddenly came alive again with a jerk, and she found herself firmly placing the spoon back down on the table. Her heart was beating thickly. Her stomach, her entire midsection felt odd. “What’s wrong, [MASK]?
<name>Marnie</name>	Marnie	Clarice	Grasping it between her hands she tried jiggling it back on its tracks, unmindful for a moment in her haste of the noise she was making until she heard her friend, [MASK], shift massi vely in her sleep.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Clarice	I’d better skip the dessert though, as tempting as it looks.” She slid the fluted glass across to [MASK]: “You’re welcome to it.” But the peculiar sensation lingered, troubling her off and on until the long meal was finally over and they left the dining room.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sis	He would go on then to offer them the other half-dozen or so poems he remembered from his boyhood. “'Little brown baby wif spa'klin’/eyes . . . !’” He would burst out in dialect and, coming over, scoop [MASK] up in his arms.
<name>Allday</name>	Allday	Milda	“The nation dances starting up,” [MASK] bent over her to whisper. “Is only the old people dances them.” “She’s a Temne, oui. The one you see dancing there is of the Temne nation.”
<name>Thorn</name>	Thorn	Dawson	“Come/O will you come . . . ?”The trees in Shad [MASK]’s wood gave voice to the old invitational hymn, speaking for her. “Come/Won't you come . . . ?” What was wrong with her? Couldn’t
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Avey	At night, in bed, [MASK] could sometimes scarcely pry away the book or manual he had fallen asleep gripping in his hand. And these were the first things he reached for—still half asleep—on the night table beside the bed in the mornings.
<name>Yolanda</name>	Yolanda	Marion	He might have stepped off the pages of the expensive photography book with the word “Masai” on its cover which [MASK] kept in her living room. A warrior without his spear and leaning stick, without his shield, wearing mirror sunglasses and a straw ten-gallon hat.
<name>Josephine</name>	Josephine	Cuney	And hadn’t she struck her great-aunt [MASK] on the breasts that were as fallen as hers had become in the other dream, her fist coming down repeatedly . . . ? She brought her arms up to cover herself. A robe and a clean set of clothes.
<name>Bonnie</name>	Bonnie	Annawilda	The beige chenille robe she had had to wear all day over her clothes to keep warm could no longer be buttoned beyond the third one down. And there was an orange stain on the collar where [MASK], tiring of the mashed carrots she was feeding her for lunch, had sprayed her with a mouthful.
<name>India</name>	India	Marion	Her “sweetest lepers,” [MASK] called them, from a poem she was always urging her mother to read. The last of the evening gowns lay where she had just flung them on top of the final pile of dresses in the fold-over garment bag.
<name>James</name>	James	Jay	In the warm pool of light from the lamp beside the bed, the woman's stomach was flat, smooth, a snow-white plain, with the navel like a tiny signpost pointing to the silken forest below. [MASK] could not get over the flatness.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Sis	“and I’m to have all my homework done—the parts I can do by myself anyway—by the time you come to pick us up at six. Right?” [MASK] interrupted her with a weary sigh one morning.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Milda	Did she wish something to drink? Was the chair comfortable? Could she see good from there? Was she all right? Both father and daughter fussed over her. If she needed anything she was to ask [MASK] whom they had told to remain at her side.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Avey	Even the unborn child was in an agitated state. Dimly, in the hysteria overtaking her, [MASK] felt it pounding away with its little watery limbs on the wall of her stomach like an outraged neighbor in a next-door apartment protesting the noise. “. . .
<name>Beaufort</name>	Beaufort	Tatem	She swung away her face, telling herself, hoping, that when she looked back, she would find that the old woman had given up and gone on the walk alone; or better yet had returned to her grave in [MASK]’s colored cemetery.
<name>David</name>	David	David	But she had refused to leave, denying at first that she had been dancing, then claiming it had been the Spirit moving powerfully in her which had caused her to forget and cross her feet. She had even tried brazening it out: “Hadn’t [MASK] danced before the Lord?”
<name>Josephine</name>	Josephine	Bojangles	Her weaving head was arched high. All of her moving suddenly with a vigor and passion she hadn’t felt in years, and with something of the stylishness and sass she had once been known for. "Girl, you can out-jangle [MASK]. ”
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Cuney	she had asked him at the end, half expecting him to dismiss the whole apocryphal tale with a joke. Instead, his gaze on the dark still floor of water, he had said quietly, “I’m with your aunt [MASK] and the old woman you were named for.
<name>Chambas</name>	Chambas	Chambas	There was both fondness and dread in his voice. “We must give them their remembrance.” Then with the pride again—and this time it almost brought his bent shoulders straight: “I’s a Chamba! From my father’s side of the family. They was all [MASK].
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Clarice	At the same time her hand ached to reach out and lift that bowed head, force it up. She wanted to shout at [MASK] the way her father used to at her long ago whenever he caught her slouching, “Pull your back up, girl!”
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Marion	That was the night when it appeared that the ruin and defeat steadily overtaking the block had reached their walkup and was about to lay claim to them also. She had been eight months pregnant with [MASK] at the time. Far too soon for it to have happened again.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Avey	[MASK] scarcely noticed the changes, she was kept so much on the run. Or more truthfully, she noticed them but did not dare to stop and reflect; there was no time for that kind of thing, she told herself; there was just too much else she had to do.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Nigger	This was one time he wasn’t going to get around her with his pleas and apologies and talk, with his hands seeking out her breasts in the darkness. Not this morning! “[MASK], you so much as put a finger on me this morning and you’ll draw back a nub!”
<name>Joseph</name>	Joseph	Sylvie	No, [MASK] was a serious person. “All the out-islanders is like that. Serious people. Hardworking. They come to live here and before you know it they’re doing better than those like myself that’s bom in the place. Is a fact.
<name>Avy</name>	Avy	Avatara	she see she was no longer the child in scratchy wool stockings and ugly high-top shoes scrambling along at her side over the wrecked fields? No longer the Avey (or [MASK] as she insisted on calling her) she had laid claim to for a month each summer from the time she was seven.
<name>Sonny</name>	Sonny	Avey	“Negroes, you! Or Coloreds. Don’t you see the children standing here? Always bringing down the race.” But behind the cut-eye she dealt him she had been subtly smiling. A smile [MASK] knew that was part of their private language.
<name>Toussaint</name>	Toussaint	Milda	“He’s a Chamba, oui,” [MASK] spoke after some minutes. By then he had already been swept across to the circle by the tide of other voices joining his and by the drums, and could be seen forcing his stooped frame and uneven legs through the rigors of the dance.
<name>Valerian</name>	Valerian	Jay	That, more than anything else about him she was certain, puzzled, irritated and at the same time held them in thrall. Now there was nothing unusual about a colored man having a mustache. But [MASK] had not been satisfied to copy the somewhat modest style of the day.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Jay	Unable either of them to go back to sleep afterwards, she and [MASK] had sat up the rest of the night till dawn, like two people holding a wake. For a long minute she stood gripping the railing, trying to steady herself and clear her head.
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Jay	On her water-logged feet was a pair of [MASK]’s old slippers, the only things she could fit into now. And had she remembered to comb her hair that morning? She stole a furtive glance upward. It didn’t appear so.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Avey	She all of sudden feels she’d rather spend what’s left of her vacation at home and is going back today. Just like that. Without a word to anybody. You ever heard anything like it . . . ?” “Is that true, [MASK] . . . ?”
<name>Alvin</name>	Alvin	Sis	Another of his favorites—one which [MASK] was also to recite some years later in a Sunday school program—was about the creation of the world. Striding up and down the living room he would perform the portions he remembered with all the appropriate gestures: . .
<name>Enrique</name>	Enrique	Jay	It was [MASK], the salesgirls secretly knew, as did everyone else in the store, who actually ran shipping and receiving and not the Irishman in charge, although he had to be careful not to make it appear so.
