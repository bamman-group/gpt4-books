<name>She</name>	She	Alicia	If they had met this man before, they had no recollection of it. [MASK] said, “Aren’t you excited?” Later—it may have been after he took them all out to dinner—she said she was sending them to live with their grandparents instead.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Sarah	“Or rather, it’s true but it’s not the point. I mean, in one sense, of course we’re closer; we’re blood relations.” “Playing that ridiculous card game no one else can fathom,” [MASK] said.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Julian	“You know perfectly well there’s nothing wrong with that turkey. You just don’t want me to stop cooking for you and taking care of this house, you don’t want [MASK] to fall in love with me.” “Do what?”
<name>Shasta</name>	Shasta	Alexander	When they let her go home she wanted me to come with her, take a job looking out for her, but I couldn’t on account of [MASK].” A biker appeared at the end of the street, a girl with a Baskin-Robbins uniform bunching below her jacket.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Macon	“Well, that makes sense,” [MASK] said. “Gosh! How old is that thing by now?” “Let’s see. You purchased it three years ago this July.” “Well, I’d certainly like to keep the maintenance policy.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Julian	Most of the material was ridiculous. Sam’n’Joe’s Hotel, indeed! He wondered if [MASK] had made it up to tease him. A woman passed wearing white and he glanced at her surreptitiously, but it was no one he knew.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Macon	Can’t we have a bite together?” When she put it that way, it seemed so simple. They went to the Burger King on the Champs-Elysees; [MASK] wanted to recheck the place anyhow. He ordered two “Woppaires.”
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Macon	Who’s going to love him back? Who’ll lose her mind with jealousy? Who’s going to ruin her life? And you want to make me miss it!” “Well, goodness,” [MASK] said, trying to sort this out.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Muriel	He was exhausted, in fact. They returned to their hotel. In the elevator [MASK] asked, “Can I come to your room a while? My TV set only gets snow.” “We’d better say good night,” he told her.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Macon	You can’t believe in a soul. Last spring, [MASK], I didn’t tell you this, I was cutting back our hedge and I saw the bird feeder had been stolen out of the crape myrtle tree. Someone will even steal food from little birds!
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Macon	[MASK] felt there was nothing on earth he could talk about with this child. He brushed a leaf off his sleeve. He pulled his cuffs down. He said, “You're pretty young to be at the doctor’s without your mother.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Julian	The trouble was, he decided, [MASK] had never had anything happen to him. His ruddy, cheerful face was unscarred by anything but sunburn; his only interest was a ridiculously inefficient form of transportation. His brief marriage had ended amicably. He had no children.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Sarah	He’d have to give up. Then [MASK] would come for a soup ladle or something, and when he didn’t answer she would ask the neighbors and they’d say he hadn’t shown his face in some time.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Muriel	He’ll catch on in no time.” “Nobody said he wasn’t smart, [MASK]. You don’t have to take offense at every little thing a person says.” “Will you just open your present?”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Norman	He was just so .. . innocent, you know? He made me feel like I had powers. There he was following me around the halls with his arms full of books and I’d say, '[MASK]? You want to eat lunch with me?’
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Macon	She held them up one by one: a shiny black cape, a pair of brown jodhpurs, a bouffant red net evening dress sprinkled with different-sized disks of glass like the reflectors on bicycles. “Have you lost your senses?” [MASK] asked.
<name>Myrtle</name>	Myrtle	Sarah	There was a moment of watery blindness till the truck had dropped behind. [MASK] gripped the dashboard with one hand. “I don’t know how you can see to drive,” she said. “Maybe you should put on your glasses.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Macon	Chunks of plaster had fallen on the furniture, turning it white and splotchy. The floorboards were mottled. The rug, when [MASK] stepped on it, squelched beneath his feet. He marveled at the thoroughness of the destruction; not a detail had been overlooked.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Macon	You’re encased. You’re like something in a capsule. You’re a dried-up kernel of a man that nothing really penetrates. Oh, [MASK], it’s not by chance you write those silly books telling people how to take trips without a jolt.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Julian	Or he thinks we wouldn’t answer. Or I don’t know, maybe he figures we would answer even so, because we’re worried.” “Do you always give this much thought to your phone calls?” [MASK] asked.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Julian	He stepped back and dropped the leash. His other crutch clattered to the floor. The front hall seemed to be full of crutches; there was some splintery, spiky feeling to the air. “Whoa, there!” [MASK] said. He spoke into a sudden silence.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Macon	This was a disappointment, for [MASK] was conscious while he worked of his intense curiosity about her inner workings. Sanding a drawer, he cast a guilty eye upon its contents but found only fringed shawls and yellowed net gloves from the forties—clues to other people’s lives, not hers.
<name>John</name>	John	Macon	He was forced to present this impassive front if he wanted her to love him. Oh, so much was expected of men! She wrote she wasn’t dating other people. Neither was [MASK], but of course he didn’t say so.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Norman	and at the wedding my daddy goes to [MASK]’s mom, ‘Why, I believe I sold you a car not long ago,’ but she was too busy crying to take much notice. That woman carried on like marriage was a fate worse than death.
<name>She</name>	She	Sarah	“You’re focused on the windshield instead of the road.” [MASK] continued to grip the dashboard. She had a broad, smooth face that gave an impression of calm, but if you looked closely you’d notice the tension at the corners of her eyes.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Ethan	He thought of once long ago when [MASK], visiting the zoo as a toddler, had paused in front of an elephant and raised his face in astonishment and fallen over backwards. Inside, everything was streaky pink marble and acres of textureless carpeting.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Macon	I keep telling them I expect it momentarily, but—” “Any moment,” [MASK] said. “Huh?” “You expect it any moment.” “Yes, and all I’ve seen so far is two chapters mailed in with no explanation.”
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	MuRiel	She sent him an anonymous letter pasted together from magazine print: Don’t FoRget tO BUY plANe Ticket for [MASK]. (And the telltale magazine—with little blocks clipped out of its pages—still lay on the kitchen table.)
<name>Connell</name>	Connell	Macon	He drew himself up and said the Royal Prince was owned by a corporation, always had been and always would be, always the same corporation. “I see,” [MASK] said. He left feeling dislocated. At suppertime, he should have tried someplace formal.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Muriel	He thought about [MASK], about what would happen if she were to knock now. Then he thought about two nights ago, or was it three, when she had strolled in with all her purchases. He wondered if she’d left any traces.
<name>God</name>	God	Lord	Otherwise, [MASK] knows how you’d get your calcium in this country. And don’t eat the rolls; you know that, don’t you? Don’t start your day with carbohydrates, especially under the strain of travel.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Rose	Don’t you think [MASK] could take all that in hand?” “Well, sure, but—” “Call her up and tell her your business is going to pieces. Ask if she could just come in and get things organized, get things under control.
<name>Fluffy</name>	Fluffy	Edward	In her striped caftan that he was so fond of? With a cool summer supper laid out on the patio table? Careful not to take anything for granted, he stopped at a Seven-Eleven for milk. He drove to the vet’s to pick up [MASK].
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Muriel	“You know I can’t afford to bring you.” [MASK] replaced the suitcase and they left the shop. “But just this once,” she said, hurrying along beside him. “It wouldn’t cost much!”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sarah	Or could [MASK] come see to him, two or three times a day? He recoiled from that; it meant asking her. It meant dialing that number he’d never used and asking her for a favor. meow-bow animal hospital, a sign across the street read.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Rose	“He has this one-sided notion of us. I just pray none of us says anything unconventional around him, are you listening?” “What would we say?” [MASK] asked. “We’re the most conventional people I know.”
<name>Case</name>	Case	Macon	In [MASK]’s opinion, morning in other time zones was like something staged—a curtain painted with a rising sun, superimposed upon the real dark. He let his head tip back against the seat and closed his eyes.
<name>John</name>	John	Macon	he said. She lowered her glass. She said, “I asked you here for a reason, [MASK].” He could tell it was something he didn’t want to hear. She said, “We need to spell out the details of our separation.”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Julian	“Here you are!” [MASK] said, strolling past him. He wore corduroys and looked rugged and healthy. “I’ve been phoning you for three days straight. That dog sounds awfully close by, don’t you think?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Muriel	“We’d better say good night,” he told her. “Can’t I just come in and keep you company?” “No, [MASK].” “We wouldn’t have to do anything,” she said. The elevator stopped at his floor.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Macon	[MASK] felt a sudden rush of love. Oh, he’d raged at her and hated her and entirely forgotten her, at different times. He’d had moments when he imagined he’d never cared for her to begin with; only went after her because everybody else had.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Muriel	He took the letter from his pocket and bent down. “I’ve got a double-barreled shotgun,” [MASK] said from inside the house, “and I’m aiming it exactly where your head is.” He straightened sharply. His heart started pounding.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Muriel	Had he ever known such a fighter? He went grocery shopping with her unusually late one evening, and just as they were crossing a shadowed area a boy stepped forth from a doorway. “Give over all what you have in your purse,” he told [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Muriel	he asked her. “Oh, different people.” “What different people? I hope you haven’t just parked him, [MASK]. You know how insecure a child that age can—” “Relax. He’s fine.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Claire	He tried not to creak the floorboards as he descended the stairs. The living room was unnaturally bright, reflecting the snow outside. The couch was opened, a mass of sheets and blankets; [MASK] had slept over the last few nights.
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Macon	Why, you ought to be walking around that building so amazed and proud of yourself!” [MASK] gave a small, dry laugh and gripped the receiver more tightly. “Now, here’s what I’m going to do,” she said.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Bob	“We all have our ups and downs,” she said. For a second, he thought she meant her salads weren’t consistently successful. “I’ll be honest,” she told him, “there’ve been times when I have wondered if [MASK] and I would make it.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Macon	“They say it’s none of their business. But I can’t just stand by and watch, [MASK]. I have to say what I think. How old are you—forty-two? Forty-three now? And she is. ..
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Macon	She wore a yellow dress that made her tan glow; she looked very pretty. "I was just wondering about the azaleas,” she told [MASK]. “Weren’t we supposed to feed them in the spring?”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Macon	He would have turned to give the boy another look, except that he couldn’t manage the movement. The taxi bounced over the cobblestones. The driver whistled a tune between his teeth. [MASK] found that bracing himself on one arm protected his back somewhat from the jolts.
<name>Abigail</name>	Abigail	Edward	He whistled while he probed the depth of a crack. He hummed as he toured the basement, shaking his head at the disarray. Upstairs he found a three-legged bureau leaning on a can of tomatoes, and he told [MASK], “Scandalous!”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Julian	The secretary typed in a back room while [MASK], who couldn’t stand being alone, sat out front. He was talking on a red telephone, lounging behind a desk that was laden with a clutter of advertisements, pam- phlets, unpaid bills, unanswered letteis, empty Chinese carryout cartons, and Perrier bottles.
<name>John</name>	John	Macon	The woman wore an apron, the men wore black suits. There was something artificial about their posture. They were lined up too precisely; none of them touched the others. “Who are these people?” [MASK] asked.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Rose	It would just feel wrong. Her brothers pointed out that she’d have to wake up at five a.m. to put a turkey in the oven. But it was she who’d be doing it, [MASK] said. It wouldn’t be troubling them any.
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Macon	Well, never mind. I’ve got a house key; I’ll just let myself in on Saturday.” “Maybe I could bring the rug over.” “I’ll wait till Saturday.” “That way I could see your apartment,” [MASK] said.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Macon	“You want a dog you can’t handle? Fine with me.” “I’d rather a barking dog than a damaged, timid dog,” [MASK] said. “You want a dog that bites all your friends? Scars neighbor kids for life?
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Muriel	“It probably cost you the same, in the long run, or maybe even more.” “No, what I did was—” “But the point is, why, [MASK]? Why are you doing this?” She lifted her chin.
<name>Nora</name>	Nora	Charles	How “chauvinist” had come to be a shorthand term for “male chauvinist,” its original meaning sadly lost to common knowledge. It was incredible, [MASK] chimed in, that a female movie star traveled “incognito” when any fool should know
<name>Jerry</name>	Jerry	Rose	“I thought you said aces were high.” “They are.” “So that means—” “But not when they’re drawn from the deck.” “Aha! Then why was the one that [MASK] drew counted high?”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Ethan	I fust can’t. It seemed his voice had rusted over. He held the receiver to his ear but great, sharp clots of rust were sticking in his throat. He had never actually said out loud that [MASK] was dead.
<name>Wendy</name>	Wendy	Ethan	Oh, his life had regained all its old perils. He was forced to worry once again about nuclear war and the future of the planet. He often had the same secret, guilty thought that had come to him after [MASK] was born:
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	Alexander	This one? This one?” “What I’d really like is T-shirts,” [MASK] said. “T-shirts. Ah.” “The kind with a sort of stretched-out neck. And jeans with raggedy bottoms.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Claire	“I was just coming in from the grocery store, carrying these few odds and ends I needed for [MASK]’s school lunches. That child eats more than some grown men I know. Phone rings. I drop everything and go to answer.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Macon	A list of American-trained doctors and dentists in every foreign capital, plus maybe some suggestions for basic medical supplies: aspirin, Merck Manual—” “Oh, not a Merck Manual away from home!” [MASK] said.
<name>him</name>	him	Macon	“You think so?” “If you practice. If you don’t give in. If you don’t go all softhearted.” Then she stood up and came over to [MASK]. She patted his arm. “But never mind,” she told him.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Macon	“So? I’ll pay.” She stopped flipping the bacon and looked over at him. “What are you saying?” she asked. “Pardon?” “What are you saying, [MASK]? Are you saying you’re committed?”
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Macon	Those cool little fingers were so distinct, so particular, so full of character. [MASK] tightened his grip and felt a pleasant kind of sorrow sweeping through him. Oh, his life had regained all its old perils. He was forced to worry once again about nuclear war and the future of the planet.
<name>Truman</name>	Truman	Edward	She speeded up. When [MASK] crossed in front of her, she walked right into him. When he dawdled, she yanked his leash. She tip-tapped briskly eastward, her coat a stiff, swaying triangle beneath the smaller triangle of her hair blowing back.
<name>Godot</name>	Godot	Sarah	But this second year is real. I’ve stopped going to his door. I’ve sometimes let a whole day pass by without thinking about him. That absence is more terrible than the first, in a way. And you’d suppose I would turn to [MASK]
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alexander	She said, “What are you doing for dinner tomorrow night?” “For—?” “Come and eat at my house.” He blinked. “Come on. We’ll have fun.” “Urn...” “Just for dinner, you and me and [MASK].
<name>Essie</name>	Essie	Macon	[MASK] stayed behind. It had been hard enough getting down the front porch steps. “He’s supposed to match his pace to anything,” she called back. “Slow, fast, anything I do.” She speeded up.
<name>Patricia</name>	Patricia	Ethan	The real adventure, he thought, is the flow of time; it’s as much adventure as anyone could wish. And if he pictured [MASK] still part of that flow—in some other place, however unreachable—he believed he might be able to bear it after all.
<name>She</name>	She	Bernice	She wrapped both hands around her cup. [MASK] said, “Well, I’m not saying no,” and she crossed the kitchen to pull out a chair. Her boots left pads of snow with each step.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Macon	“In your black-and-gold kimono,” he said. “Exactly.” “But I don’t believe they sell those feathered slippers anymore.” “In thrift shops they do.” “Oh. Right.” Lately, [MASK] had begun to like thrift shops himself.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Macon	She found [MASK] standing at the kitchen sink with yet another cup of coffee. “Did the couch get here?” she asked him. “All safe and sound.” “Oh, good! Let’s see it.”
<name>From</name>	From	WTien	[MASK] she had looked up at him that first night and rattled the ice cubes in her paper cup, they were already moving toward their last edgy, miserable year together, toward those months when anything either of them said was wrong, toward that sense of narrowly missed connections.
<name>Mrs. Dalloway</name>	Mrs. Dalloway	Macon	I see you! Don’t think I don’t know you’re skipping school!” For this street was always backsliding, [MASK] saw, always falling behind, but was caught just in time by these women with their carrying voices and their pushy jaws.
<name>Marvin</name>	Marvin	Macon	[MASK] walked into an apartment that could have come straight from the 1950s. There was a square sofa with metallic threads in its fabric, a chrome-trimmed dinette set, and in the bedroom a double bed whose headboard was quilted in cream-colored vinyl.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Norman	He just stuttered around. I said, ‘[MASK], she’s lying, it’s not true, I wasn’t going with those boys when I met you! That’s all in the past!’ He said, ‘I don’t know what to think.’
<name>He</name>	He	Macon	She was short and tidily made, and there was something plucky about the way her little tan calves were so firmly braced, as if she were determined that this looming flock of basketball stars and football stars would not bowl her over. [MASK] gave up on her at once.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Sarah	“Well, of course,” she said. He supposed she’d always known that. They finished their meal but they didn’t order coffee because they were running late. [MASK] had her class; she was studying with a sculptor on Saturdays.
<name>He</name>	He	Macon	“So can I talk to her?” “Oh. Well. I guess so.” [MASK] led the way to the kitchen. He felt he’d made a mistake—that having acted so thorny, he’d caused this meeting to seem more important than it was.
<name>He</name>	He	Macon	He’d seemed uncomfortable with silence and did his best to fill it with abrupt little fragments of chitchat. [MASK] hadn’t listened, or he’d thought he hadn’t; but now all the fragments came back to him.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Sarah	“No, no,” he said. “Well, what do you think of this one?” “It’s fine.” “Don’t you have any opinion?” “I just gave you my opinion, [MASK].”
<name>He</name>	He	Macon	He sat, and she bent to pick up his leash. “How’s your little boy?” [MASK] asked her. She looked over at him. “What?” she said. “Wasn’t he sick?” “Who told you that?”
<name>Cesar</name>	Cesar	Muriel	“You want your dog to mind you in every situation,” [MASK] said. “Even out in public. You want to leave him outside a public place and come back to find him waiting. That’s what we’ll work on this morning.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Sarah	“I don’t see how you stay married to the man,” she’d said to [MASK]. She herself was now on her fourth husband, a rock-garden architect with a white goatee. It was true the children in the portrait seemed unrelated to her.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Macon	Then he drew a breath and began the long, hard trip up the stairs for help. h, I’ve erred and I have stumbled,” [MASK]’s sister sang in the kitchen, “I’ve been sinful and unwise . .
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Rose	He sat down on the cellophane that covered the couch. He tossed the folder aside and said, “Have you seen [MASK] lately?” “Yes, we were over there just this morning.” “Do you think she’s not coming back?”
<name>He</name>	He	Macon	He was better off than most people, though, because he hadn’t touched salted food or drunk any alcohol. Alcohol was definitely retained. Drink alcohol on a plane and you’d feel befuddled for days, [MASK] believed.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Claire	“Why should they have to know every little thing you do? It doesn’t matter that you’re not up to anything, [MASK]. Tell them, ‘I’m seventeen years old and it’s none of your affair anymore if I’m up to anything or not.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Macon	“Aren’t you going to ask me to autograph your cast? It’s so white.” “I like it white,” [MASK] said. “I polish it with shoe polish.” “I didn’t realize you could do that.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Alexander	Well, you can see his point, I guess. It’s like I only had room in my mind for [MASK]. And he was in the hospital for months, for really months; there was everything in this world wrong with him.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Muriel	They closed the front door. [MASK] tweaked the lace curtain and peered out. “Well, he’s staying so far,” she announced. She turned her back to the door. She checked her fingernails and said, “Tsk!”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Macon	There was a silence; a single murmuring voice. [MASK] rose and returned to the kitchen, walking more quietly than usual and keeping a weather eye out, the way a cat creeps back after it’s been dumped from someone’s lap.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Rose	“It’s only a little farther.” They entered the pantry. [MASK] opened the bathroom door and helped him inside. “Call me when you’re ready,” she said, closing the door after him.
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Rose	By six thirty sharp they were ringing the doorbell, standing in a hushed corridor carpeted in off-white. [MASK] opened the door and called, “They’re here!” and set her face lightly against each of theirs.
<name>Oy</name>	Oy	Edward	Then it was lunchtime, and he would put away his work and make himself a sandwich or heat a can of soup, let [MASK] have a quick run in the tiny backyard. After that he liked to putter around the house a bit.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Edward	“It was Sunday and I had nothing to do. And then my brother’s kids were getting ready to leave and [MASK] was growling the way he usually does; so I tapped my foot and down he went.” “I’m proud of both of you.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Macon	“Well, maybe not quite so tall. Maybe a bit, well, heavier. More . . . upholstered.” “I see,” [MASK] said. The elevator had stopped by now but it took its time sliding open.
