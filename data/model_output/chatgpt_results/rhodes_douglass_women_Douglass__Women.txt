<name>Barack</name>	Barack	Garrison	And the man himself kept his head bowed, as if in prayer or contemplation. His dark locks fanned forward and his features were indiscernible. [MASK] stepped up to the podium. The program began. I pitched forward on the edge of my seat. Oh, the speeches.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Anna	But if you preach abolition, I’ll end up carrying my baby on my back and cleaning some white woman’s house.” “No.” He moved quick, grabbed my hand. Then, he wrapped his arms about me. “[MASK], I’m sorry.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Douglass	I love you, [MASK]. Anything you want. Anything I can do to help. Only please let me stay. Say you forgive me.” “I think we should focus on the work.” He handed me my night rail and robe.
<name>Mother</name>	Mother	Mam	I didn’t say a colored church be more welcoming. I didn’t say that with his learning, a great Pastor he’d make. [MASK] always told me “deeds, not words” speak the truth of a loving heart.
<name>Nora</name>	Nora	Freddy	Her finger touched my wedding ring. Looking me in my eye, she said, “I know a sweet little house you can rent. A doll’s house.” I gave her a big smile. at The house be small all right. Maybe too small for [MASK].
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Freddy	It was like [MASK] grew rigid as he came into himself, a free man. Like his self became the center of all things. He be saying he don’t need me. He didn’t care about my feelings. He forgot I helped him to escape.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Rosetta	I had no time for letters, I thought. There be laundry to do. Cooking, cleaning. The new baby be draining much from me. Sometimes I just wanted to lay in bed. Not even get up for [MASK]’s call. But I did.
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Douglass	Always [MASK]. Like I called Garrison, Garrison. No difference. I treated both men the same. I felt frustrated, restless. Nonetheless, I prepared for bed. I didn’t trust my expressions or actions to the common ship.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Annie	I stood at the window, imagining water, the ocean, bay, rivers, imagining the bones I’d long lost and no longer saw. “Please. Please. Let me be the one.” Mid-February, [MASK] sat up.
<name>Uncle Hamish</name>	Uncle Hamish	Douglass	Of all [MASK]’ children, I had known her the least. Sometimes, late at night, I stared out the window at the Scottish hills. Bagpipes sounded like laments. Like children, animals wailing. Like my own heart about to burst. How fickle I was.
<name>he</name>	he	Freddy	Tell him he’s got to choose. But what if [MASK] didn’t pick me? Such a hard place. Me, believing in my marriage vows. Me, still loving him. Me, believing it be better to raise my children with him than without him.
<name>Jamie</name>	Jamie	Douglass	I taught him the waltz. In the cottage, he embraced me and twirled me about the floor. His arms were reluctant to release me. Small victories. [MASK] was a passionate man. But for all his control, I knew he thought of me.
<name>Abigail</name>	Abigail	Rosetta	Her brow touched the post. “Leave my house.” No words. Just hush. I could hear morning robin birds starting to sing. I could even hear the old house creaking, someone was going down the stairs. [MASK]? The curtains flapped.
<name>her</name>	her	Freddy	There was a fire in him as if his speech unleashed a new passion. Nothing I could do to bank it down. Strange. Me, who loved [MASK] with all my heart, slowing my feet when it came to loving. This wasn’t me.
<name>Olaudah</name>	Olaudah	Douglass	Ironic to escape slavery, only to die crossing the sea. The lamp was askew, but there was enough light to confirm [MASK] was alive. His chest rose. He’d fallen asleep, exhausted. I leaned over him, eager to see his new writing.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Mam	so dumb I didn’t know that. But little things can add up to big. “Be special like you,” [MASK] would always say. I just had to be patient. Take my chance when it come. That evening I looked for my cat.
<name>family</name>	family	Anna	“No. But an honorable life is lived by principles. You, yourself, have said this.” ‘“All men are created equal.’ So fighting for freedom means that 1 abandon [MASK]? My child?” “But all men aren’t equal.
<name>He</name>	He	Garrison	“[MASK] won’t approve.” “I’m my own man.” “You shouldn’t antagonize him.” “You contradict yourself.” “Why? Because I think you should keep allies?” “I make my own decisions.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Anna	I heard scraping. Thought I saw a blue flash from the comer of my eye. If it was [MASK], I was going to scream. Though decent, the bed was mussed for two rather than one. Both pillows had impressions, strands of blond and black hair.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Annie	I’d worried he’d blame me for [MASK] dying. But all he did was hold me and cry. Wailed like he, himself, was a little-bitty baby. I rocked him and let him stroke me until my body was afire with more than fever.
<name>Samson</name>	Samson	Grayer	Just fine.” He stood tall, proud as ever. A little more stout. [MASK]. Still, he was Samson-man, standing, perched on the edge of his horizon. I touched his back. Now clothed in fine wool rather than burlap.
<name>him</name>	him	Douglass	if I imagined my dark lover stroking, caressing within me, my body would respond, shuddering, delighted. Yes, a poor substitute for [MASK]. But greedy for loving, rocked and lulled by ocean waves, I touched myself again. Ah, just so.
<name>his</name>	his	Douglass	My lips had already parted for a kiss when I realized [MASK]’ arms were encircling my waist, his legs lying against mine. Pleasure seems to be a male right. Yet, I felt it—pleasure, a shuddering beyond this world to some nameless land.
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Douglass	Me, frightened? More frightened than I’d ever been in my life. Across the aisle, I saw a wife with a husband. How companionable the two were! Her hand laced in his. Two heads tilted together. [MASK] sent a carriage for me.
<name>Harriet</name> (referring to Harriet Tubman, who was married in 1844 and was a prominent abolitionist)	Harriet (referring to Harriet Tubman, who was married in 1844 and was a prominent abolitionist)	Freddy	Abolitionists told everybody when [MASK] married. These white folks were truly excited to help a slave find love. (Acted like they had some hand in it!) So even though I’d been big for months, my neighbors counted well enough to know the baby wasn’t
<name>Jackie</name>	Jackie	Freddy	But now I also knew something new. [MASK], with no head bowed, no shuffling, could look straight at a pretty, white woman. Eight years younger than me, I knew he might look at pretty women from time to time. Colored women might look back.
<name>John</name>	John	Freddy	I gathered her in my arms and held her to my left breast. Though sleepy still, my baby fed hungrily and dearest [MASK], my husband, was amazed at what my body could do. Then, he was up, saying, “What chores need doing?”
<name>Frederick</name>	Frederick	Freddy	“Auld won’t sell.” “Then you must be gone, man. Gone to escape this fate. Enslaved again, you cannot help the cause.” “You mean I’d be worthless to you?” [MASK] said bitter, his words sharp.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Douglass	I wanted to hold her. Instead, I said, “[MASK], I wish to speak with you.” And he misinterpreted me—purposefully, I don’t know. But he rose, saying, “Yes, it’s time for us to go.
<name>Mahalia</name>	Mahalia	Anna	I felt as though I were a child swept back in time. Then, [MASK] lifted her head and notes rose from her throat that almost had me weeping. Lullaby, spiritual, I don’t know which. It was a soulful music that made me shudder.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Anna	“Write. Your book. Your story should be written down. I’ll work.” “[MASK], no—” “All my life, I work. I be proud of what my hands and back can do.”
<name>Warren</name>	Warren	Douglass	Instead, I inhaled. This be a new world for me. But I’m a Murray and a [MASK] and I’ll make my family—make myself, as best I can, proud. I clasped the hand. Did my duty.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Douglass	My child?” “But all men aren’t equal. All men should be free, yes. But few are equal to you, [MASK].” “You are my defender?” “Always.” “At what cost?” I lowered my eyes.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Freddy	Some got angry. Some suspected I lied. Some thought I was the maid! Foolishness. My one comfort was if a slave catcher called, I could tell the same truth: [MASK] is not here. After a month, I stopped answering the door.
<name>Miss Crocker</name>	Miss Crocker	Rosetta	As though that made life easier. “They still colored,” I say. [MASK] say, “I want to teach.” That be fine. She could teach colored children. Teach her babies book-learning. Unlike me.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Anna	All but a handful of nights, I slept alone or, should I say, tried to sleep, tossing and turning in my flat, sailor’s bed. [MASK] “He came home a free man. Maybe too free.
<name>me</name> (The speaker is referring to themselves and asking why they are not liked because they cannot read.)	me (The speaker is referring to themselves and asking why they are not liked because they cannot read.)	Jews	“The child can’t read.” I was shocked. All afternoon I cried. Not reading stories was great poverty to me. At ten, I asked directly, forthrightly: “Why don’t people like [MASK]?”
<name>him</name>	him	Douglass	Knew for a time he would mourn and wish fiercely he could undo our illicit love. I wrote [MASK], telling him he’d need only ask and I’d fly to his side. Then I waited. Firm in the belief that love would conquer all.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Douglass	[MASK] shifted his weight and, over his shoulder, I glimpsed her eyes. Such naked emotion. Such power. She was pleading with him. Saying nary a word. Yet, even from a distance, I felt her yearning.
<name>myself</name>	myself	Oluwand	“No, ma’am. Free. In the North, most coloreds be free.” I started crying, balling my fists against my eyes to stop my tears. I hadn’t cried before and now I cried for [MASK] and for every one I ever loved.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Mercy	[MASK]. I started to cry. I mustn’t think of her. Mustn’t doubt what be in my heart. I promised to love, honor, and obey. I would. He vowed to love and honor me. So he would. Love be true.
<name>Some possible answers include: Dad, Mom, He, She, They, John, Mary, etc.</name>	Some possible answers include: Dad, Mom, He, She, They, John, Mary, etc.	Freddy	I wanted to ask. But that be water over the bridge. No sense asking him to stay. The house rose like a white dream. I would’ve painted it blue. Would’ve built it cheaper, too. [MASK] always gone to pay for it.
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Rosetta	It took him a week to get home. But he nearly flew from his horse and he hugged the children, played with them all afternoon ’til they all were worn out from the excitement. Even [MASK] yawned. We all sat down to supper.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Freddy	Both of us looked up, startled by the sound. I didn’t move, ’cause the sound was too big and loud, too frightening. None of the neighbors would knock so. [MASK] moved quick, like all along he’d been waiting for the sign.
<name>John</name>	John	Mam	He looked at me, shook his head. My knees buckled. He made to get down from the wagon and I just shouted, “Naw.” His head jerked up then, he cracked his whip, and went on. [MASK]’s dead.
<name>Natasha</name>	Natasha	Douglass	Tell me, [MASK], is this the woman you dreamed of sharing your life? A peasant, is she not? Not well-bred at all.” “Whereas you?” “Very well-bred. The daughter of a physician and a teacher.
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Jean	Yet, by dawn, I hurt not so much from [MASK]’s rejection. Rather, I ached that he’d found fault with my America. Slaves were servants, weren’t they? Indentured bondsmen? But from one’s station, one could rise.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Freddy	Wind and water be raging down the coast. Deep in their watery grave, bones be clattering. Biggest fish be eating the smallest. Still—there was a short good time. Me, [MASK], and the baby, took pleasure in each other.
<name>Jay</name>	Jay	Sullen	[MASK]. Spoke nary a word. And I got colder, too, feeling my job was to give and give. Love was a hard toll. I wanted a breath of kindness from him, a sweet word to soothe my worry.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Hush	“[MASK]. Lay down. Let me take care of you.” I bustled forward. “All my life,” he said, “I’ve been trying to be a man, trying to be treated as a man. A gentleman like any other.
<name>Bigger</name>	Bigger	Freddy	They would’ve loved him better if he was hung? I thought [MASK] was smart to survive. I was pleased to say, “He ain’t here.” “He ain’t here. Ain’t here.” “Isn’t. Isn’t here.”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Freddy	A time when life seemed all the more precious and trees glowed vibrant, the sky shimmered with rainbows, and clouds seemed like pillows to rest a weary head. And if I worried some that [MASK] would be angry at me, I kept it to myself.
<name>someone</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to make an educated guess about the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	someone (There is not enough information in the passage to make an educated guess about the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Freddie	It’d been a long time since I’d been held. A long time of me laying in bed, longing for a touch. I hadn’t forgotten what loving once meant between me and [MASK]. What loving meant for my body, my heart.
<name>Precious</name>	Precious	Mam	[MASK] didn’t even know she was having me. Didn’t know I was growing inside ’til almost the very end. She said her back ache. Low and deep. Not ’til her body say “push,” did she think to lay down.
<name>John</name>	John	Freddy	Clip-clopped. My eyes filled with water. [MASK]’s not looking at me. He be looking past the horse’s head, far down the road. Beyond where the moon made our path glow. I heard him murmuring, repeating words from his speech.
<name>Kunta</name>	Kunta	Anna	It’s the ugliness of your mind that punished me. You’re an embarrassment, [MASK]. Barely more educated than when I found you.” “Whose fault? When you been here to teach me?” “You could’ve continued on your own.”
<name>Aminata</name>	Aminata	Freddy	When a sailor stroked my arm, murmuring, “Me bed needs warming.” When everybody white looked at me as if to say, “Don’t forget your place.” “[MASK].” I be your wife in flesh.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Mam	Like children playing, clapping songs, jumping rope or eating sweet potato pie. My soul lit up. I was certain them bones be my friend. They be enjoying this free colored girl. Not jealous, but happy I was alive. I raced home and asked [MASK] to make fritters.
<name>Zora</name>	Zora	Lynn	I picked it because it had a woman’s name—[MASK]. It was another small town with plenty of hardworking colored folk. They made shoes. Drying and curing skin into leather all day. But the women I met were as friendly as pie.
<name>dark coffee</name>	dark coffee	Freddy	Sweet enough to drink.” But he say, “Dark coffee be best. Dark coffee be what 1 married. One day a good man be proud to marry you.” I used to think [MASK] be proud because dark coffee covered me. My mistake.
<name>who</name>	who	Lincoln	Most times I stared out the window, watching whatever life swept by. Sometimes a bird. A rabbit. A baby doe. Sometimes I listened. Or, at least, well enough to know [MASK] be running for president.
<name>He</name>	He	Freddy	Then, I let go. Left his study not caring where the glass, the water, them flowers flew. This much I knew. [MASK] didn’t ever believe he was in the wrong. Or if he did, he didn’t show it.
<name>Mrs. Myers</name>	Mrs. Myers	Anna	It was the children who rambled back and forth between rooms, between worlds. 1 didn’t have much to do with them. I thought [MASK] preferred it that way. I told a fairy tale or two. Brought them candy. Kites. Twine balls.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Anna	If you offered more, I would gladly take it, [MASK]. But you don’t.” Both of us breathed hard. I closed my eyes, wishing I could undo what I was hearing, feeling and seeing. “Why’d you marry me?”
<name>Kizzy</name>	Kizzy	Rosetta	I touched my hand to his cheek. “I know you have important work to do. I see that now. But we be a family. [MASK] needs us both. She needs her father.” “It’s because you’ve never been a slave.”
<name>Breath</name>	Breath	Devils	“Where can a colored man go and live free?” He sucked in air. I saw bitterness rising in him. He wasn’t talking to me. He was lost somewhere inside himself, trying to figure things out. I shivered. [MASK] tiptoed across his soul.
<name>Northup</name>	Northup	Freddy	I screamed into the wind, “Free. Free.” [MASK] must’ve thrilled at drawing north. White sails taking him far and far beyond again. Him not a slave no more. I felt my inside self break free, my passion rising.
<name>Indiana</name>	Indiana	Freddy	A line of people, bulging and twisting like a snake, waited to meet them. [MASK], at ease, shook hands, smiling, meeting these strangers like it be the easiest thing in the world. “Let us through. Let us through.”
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Freddy	Every second, he be gracious, shouting his appreciation to the whole, wide world that his family was safe. When the moon was quarter-high, we tucked the children in bed. Ready for a deep, satisfying sleep. [MASK] offered his hand.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Douglass	“These men are beneath you. Not worth your time.” “It’s my decision, not yours.” I was glad I didn’t overrule him. Maybe it was hearing the Southern tongue or that the debate was two against one? But [MASK] was inspired.
<name>Tea</name>	Tea	Lil	Time for [MASK]’ Bit to teach her grown self a lesson. Can’t harvest the sea without thinking about what was needed. True— no man had ever asked for my hand. Also true —there’d been no man I’d wanted. Love be true.
<name>Garfield</name>	Garfield	Lena	It didn’t die. Just lay in the dirt ’til I picked it up. Though I held it warm by the fire, fed it worms, it still died. A calico showed up on my doorstep, looking for all the world like [MASK].
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Annie	Content not to say nothing. Just enjoy the day. After a while, all the animals came visiting. Butterflies hovered. A buck and doe wandered onto the grass. An eagle glided past the roof; we could see its blinking eye. [MASK] liked ladybugs best.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Delilah	He told the truth to give her a chance to be different. To love him back. [MASK] failed him and then, I think, she knew she failed herself, too. She hurt this man that loved her true, that gave her his trust after three wrongs.
<name>Boo</name>	Boo	Freddy	[MASK] claimed his office then, he was gone like a ghost. In my mind, I made lists about what we’d need. I needed to sew curtains. Find a carpenter to make beds. Go to town for supplies: flour, sugar, meal, fatback.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Freddy	In between his many words, I fed [MASK] a slice of ham, a tuft of bread, a slice of apple. So many words. I watched him eat. Said, “Mmm,” when he paused and offered more wine and food.
<name>Lolita</name>	Lolita	Bailey	I sucked air, letting myself think for the first time, what my body knew to be true. [MASK]’s seed in me. And I’m chained to a man who doesn’t want me—who’d never do little things, anything, to show his love.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Freddy	Or die trying. Mostly, I stared at the stars and wondered how I got in my fix. I loved [MASK]. I did. I do. He was my last—only—hope for marriage. I was his hope for freedom.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Freddy	I swore I’d learn reading. I didn’t want to feel this way again. Then, I think this letter must be bad news. [MASK] know I can’t read. He could’ve gotten a message to me somehow. He had friends.
<name>he</name>	he	William	Like he was looking for some nuance, some new discovery in me. Of course, I said nothing. He didn’t want to hear what I had to say. I think if [MASK] had been more at ease, more flexible, I might’ve married him.
<name>Rhett</name>	Rhett	Scoundrel	“[MASK].” “A charming word from your lips.” He meant to kiss me. But as his hands gripped my shoulders, I turned aside. “Forgive me. I’ve acted less the gentleman.”
<name>Hemingway</name>	Hemingway	Douglass	1 sometimes caught [MASK] staring at me as I translated his words, wrote articles for the German papers. Muslins easily exposed my figure, the arc of my neck, the length of arm between elbow and fingertips. There were many lovely women.
<name>he</name>	he	Freddy	I felt dizzy, sicker than I had all night. Love be true. Somehow [MASK] wasn’t. Somehow his look denied me. Made me small, “little” in an unkindly way. I tried to speak on the ride home. The moon hid behind clouds.
<name>Momma</name>	Momma	Freddy	I think you’ve learned that.” “Yes.” I acted like I didn’t hear. “Sharing [MASK]’s bed ain’t in books. For a while, you climbed in the bed right with us. But I pushed you out.
<name>their</name>	their	Douglass	Englishmen spent hours gambling, deciding which cravat to wear, whether to hunt fox this weekend or the next. They’d no notion of the meaning of survival. I, too, was tempted by [MASK]’ life force. But I’d not flirt.
<name>he</name>	he	Douglass	Or, once free, could he remarry? How hard to keep my desires in check! When [MASK] loved me, I felt as though I could soar well beyond the moon and stars. But when he left me, I still felt breathless, hungry for him.
<name>Daddy</name>	Daddy	Freddy	Mam don’t keep company with just anybody.” “Thank you.” “Good luck to you,” I said. And I meant it. On the other side of the screen door, she paused. “I’m glad [MASK] wasn’t here.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Oluwand	Even a little frightened that my life would become days of empty pursuits, nights of unfulfilled desires. It seemed to me that [MASK] pitied me. She’d appear in my bed-room, on the edge of my bed. Her black eyes blinking like an owl’s.
<name>Home</name>	Home	Lena	They didn’t know their food sometimes stuck in my throat. Still—I thanked them for their kindness and ate gratefully, ’cause the baby needed more than the slim choices in my larder. 5? Weather had turned cold, and rocking in my chair, I sometimes thought of [MASK].
<name>she</name>	she	Mam	I sang as [MASK] sang to me. I prayed, “Take me, spare her.” I stood at the window, imagining water, the ocean, bay, rivers, imagining the bones I’d long lost and no longer saw. “Please.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Anna	He undid my many buttons, his big hands so gentle, so quick. Then he stroked my breasts while still kissing me and leaning me deep, backwards onto the bed. “Thank you, [MASK].” He kissed me fierce. His hands touching, caressing everywhere.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Freddy	Quiet. I felt a distance between us even though our feet were keeping time, keeping even pace. We stopped beneath a willow. My back against bark, [MASK] kissed me slow and deep. There was a hunger in him and I was glad.
<name>God</name>	God	Mam	The pain made me roar. I hurt too bad to light a candle, to light the fire. I writhed, twisting in the bedsheets. Everything going to get bloody. In the darkness, I whispered, “Oh, [MASK].”
<name>Cap</name>	Cap	Freddy	These good folks helped me weather storms.” “I’m here. I’ll help you weather your storms.” He smiled. “Squalls in a teapot.” “I don’t want to go, [MASK].”
<name>you</name>	you	Freddy	Take me all those years even when I knew about his unfaithfulness? Over fifty now and I know the passion still be inside me. My body. I was meant for loving and [MASK] never enjoyed all I had to give.
<name>Van Gogh</name>	Van Gogh	Douglass	Dramatic. Engaged. Passionate. Sweating, light-headed, I fell back across my bed. The swelling waves made the colors move. And in my mind, each brush stroke, each splash of paint shimmered and took new form. But it was always [MASK].
<name>he</name>	he	Freddy	I’d barely lit the kitchen candles when [MASK] began tugging at my clothes, kissing my cheeks, neck, and mouth. There was a fire in him as if his speech unleashed a new passion. Nothing I could do to bank it down. Strange.
<name>Frederick</name>	Frederick	Frederick	Abolish slavery and you abolish the invisible chains that hold slaves apart and wrest from them feeling, life, and knowledge.” There was thunder, clapping like thunder. Folks rushed forward, surrounding [MASK] on stage. Chairs toppled. People pushed and shoved.
<name>he</name>	he	Freddy	“Sit down.” I leaned forward, poured more tea like it was the most normal thing in the world. “I never knew if [MASK] loved me, either. He never said, never did little things. Not truly. Not from his heart.
<name>Sailor</name>	Sailor	John	I walked down the plank into color, into a noisy world. Shouts of homecoming: “Welcome, boy”; “You’re home, [MASK]”; selling: “Please buy. Two a penny, two a penny”; “Lift anchor.
