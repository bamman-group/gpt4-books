<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Danny	The greatest terror of [MASK]’s life was DIVORCE, a word that always appeared in his mind as a sign painted in red letters which were covered with hissing, poisonous snakes. In DIVORCE, your parents no longer lived together.
<name>David</name>	David	Jack	They had been here but not for quite a long time . . . maybe years. He found some droppings that were powdery with age and several nests of neatly shredded paper that were old and unused. [MASK] pulled a newspaper from one of the bundles and glanced down at the headline.
<name>Wendy</name>	Wendy	Danny	He slipped past her without answering and carried the Pyrex bowl over to the nest by [MASK]’s bed. It was still. Nothing there. On the outside, anyway. He slammed the bowl down over the nest. “There,” he said.
<name>Dirk</name>	Dirk	Hallorann	[MASK] yanked at the snowmobile’s steering gear with all his remaining strength, and it kicked around in a sharp semicircle, throwing up clouds of snow, threatening to tip over. The rear end struck the foot of the porch steps and rebounded.
<name>everyone</name>	everyone	Hallorann	No one screamed, but [MASK] heard several sets of teeth clicking violently together like gypsy castanets. Then the turbine engines rose to a howl, braking the plane, and as they dropped in volume the pilot’s soft southern voice, perhaps not completely steady, came over the intercom system.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Wendy	Don’t.” “I am going to do my job. Now leave me alone, [MASK]!” She tried to grab his arm. He pushed her backward. Her feet tangled in the hem of her robe and she fell to the carpet with an ungainly thump.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Danny	As he set them to rights and tightened the straps again, he never took his eyes from the hole at the end of the concrete ring. He waited to see if something would come out. Nothing did, and after three or four minutes, [MASK]’s breathing began to slow down.
<name>DeWitt</name>	DeWitt	Ullman	“If you came—” “Without this job we’re done,” he said simply. “You know that.” Her silhouette nodded slowly. She knew it. “When I had that interview with [MASK], I thought he was just blowing off his bazoo.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Danny	Really it’s not.” Unheeding, [MASK] bent forward again. On his face was an expression that might be more commonly seen hovering over a graduate record exam in a college gym somewhere. She liked it less and less. “See the . . .
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Danny	“Now that’s what your mom and dad say. But this is just between us, guy. I’m your doctor. Tell me the truth and I’ll promise not to tell them unless you say I can.” [MASK] thought about it.
<name>Chigurh</name>	Chigurh	Lloyd	” [MASK]’s smile broadened, but his eyes were socketed in shadow and his skin was horribly white, like the skin of a corpse. “Later he expects to see to your son’s well-being himself. He is very interested in your son.
<name>Brett</name>	Brett	Wendy	“No, I’m not. Really I’m not. I’m just sort of shook up.” They were passing a sidewinder 15 Ml. sign, and [MASK] relaxed a little. From here on in the road was better.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Danny	But [MASK] had dozed off almost at once; first into a light, twitching doze, and in the last ten minutes or so a heavier sleep. Even looking directly at him she could barely see the slow rise and fall of his narrow chest.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Jack	[MASK] was staring at the closed door with feverish intensity. Through the diamond-shaped window in the center of the elevator door she thought she could make out the cables, thrumming slightly. The elevator clanked to a stop below them, at lobby level.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Hallorann	“When I finish writing down these numbers, I’m going to let you blow up a little balloon for me.” “Oh, JeeeesusV' [MASK] moaned. “Officer, my flight—” “Shhh,” the traffic cop said.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Al	He had lost his temper again, this time stone sober. “Sir, your party still doesn’t—” “Hello?” [MASK]’s voice, out of breath. “Go ahead,” the operator said dourly.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jack	But the manager takes care of his help. He finds that it pays. Education always pays, don’t you agree, sir?” “Yes,” [MASK] said dazedly. “For instance, you show a great interest in learning more about the Overlook Hotel.
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Jack	“All right. But those bruises were fingers. I’d swear to it. He didn’t get them falling down.” “He goes into a trance,” [MASK] said. “Maybe he sees something that happened in that room. An argument.
<name>Danny</name>	Danny	Danny	He had not been there when [MASK] found lost buttons, told her that maybe the TV Guide was under the bed, that he thought he better wear his rubbers to nursery school even though the sun was out . . .
<name>Danny</name>	Danny	Jack	Far down the lawn, past the putting green, were a number of vague, snow-cowled humps. The hedge animals. Between them and the playground. Between them and the road. His legs gave way. [MASK] caught him. He began to cry.
<name>Jonas</name>	Jonas	Hallorann	“You always know.” One of the tears spilled from the corner of his right eye and trickled slowly down his cheek. “We can’t have any secrets,” [MASK] agreed. “That’s just how it is.”
<name>Nora</name>	Nora	Danny	I know what you want. But you’re not going to get it. This hotel . . . it’s mine. It’s me they want. Me! Me!” “The door, [MASK]!” she screamed. “Shut the door! ”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Lloydy	He swayed a little on the stool. Let em stare, if that was how they got off. Take a picture, folks, it’ll last longer. “Then you start to see things, [MASK]-my-boy. Things you missed from the gutter.
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Tony	He looked at her guilelessly, a milk mustache on his lip. “Uh-huh.” “No more bad dreams?” “No.” [MASK] had come to him once, one night while he was lying in bed, calling his name faintly and from far away.
<name>Roland</name>	Roland	Danny	he whispered again, but without much hope. Only the wind spoke back, gusting more strongly this time, scattering leaves across the sloping roof below his window. Some of them slipped into the raingut-ter and came to rest there like tired dancers. [MASK].. .
<name>Danny</name>	Danny	Hallorann	And it did spring, snow billowing around its pistoning rear legs in a silent burst of crystal glitter. [MASK] screamed and twisted the handlebars hard right, ducking low at the same time. Scratching, ripping pain scrawled itself across his face, his neck, his shoulders.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Wendy	As [MASK] watched them they burst into a chord of tinkling, girlish laughter. She felt a smile touch her own lips; not one of them could be under sixty. In the background was the constant hum of conversation, the muted ding!
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Danny	His father was guarding that carefully, even in his own mind. Was it possible, [MASK] wondered, to be glad you had done something and still be so ashamed of that something that you tried not to think of it? The question was a disturbing one.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jack	She started down the stairs. CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT “IT WAS HER!” [MASK] had stood on the stairs, listening to the crooning, comforting sounds coming muffled through the locked door, and slowly his confusion had given way to anger. Things had never really changed.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Danny	“I want ... to tell you everything,” [MASK] said. “I wish I had before.” He picked up the cup and held it, as if comforted by the warmth. “Why didn’t you, son?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Danny	“Oh,” [MASK] said, and went back to looking up the street. Apparently the subject was closed. If only it could be closed that easily for her— She stood up. “I’m going upstairs for a cup of tea, doc.
<name>McGonagall</name>	McGonagall	Grady	“I’ll do what I have to do. Just let me out!’’’ “You’ll give your word on it, sir?” [MASK] persisted. “My word, my promise, my sacred vow, whatever in hell you want.
<name>Rawlins</name>	Rawlins	Queems	It was as close to an expression of sympathy as a white man who thought of himself as “good with the coloreds” could get when the object was a black man or his mythical black son. “Yeah, okay, you get going,” [MASK] said.
<name>Wendy</name>	Wendy	Jack	He would be careful. He would watch for something called Redrum. But he would not say anything unless he absolutely had to. Because they were happy, they had been laughing, and there were no bad thoughts. “Look at this view,” [MASK] said.
<name>Danny</name>	Danny	Danny	“You’re deep down in yourself in a place where nothing comes through. We’re alone here for a little while, [MASK]. This is an Overlook where no one can ever come. No clocks work here. None of the keys fit them and they can never be wound up.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Danny	Knock the press down a couple of times a day. She creeps.” She creeps, [MASK] thought, and the words echoed down a long and silent corridor in his mind, a corridor lined with mirrors where people seldom looked. “I will,” his daddy said.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Danny	It was like hugging a padded stick, and the sweet taste of horror flooded her mouth. He only sucked his thumb and stared with indifferent blankness out into the stairwell beyond both of them. “[MASK], what happened?”
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Jack	Like from a long time ago. In my head.” The elevator car stopped again. The hotel was silent, creaking, deserted. Outside, the wind whined around the eaves in the darkness. “Maybe you are both crazy,” [MASK] said conversationally.
<name>Upset</name>	Upset	Forgive	It was the dream. I’m upset. [MASK]?” “Of course,” she said, her face not changing expression. Her wooden shoulders slipped out of his hands. She walked to the middle of the lobby and called: “Hey, doc!
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jack	“No,” [MASK] said, and flashed the big PR smile again. Humiliating situation. Did this officious little prick actually think he would allow his son to goof around in a rattrap attic full of junk furniture and God knew what else?
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Danny	“I keep hearing voices in my head!” she cried. “What is it? What’s wrong? I feel like I’m going crazy!” “What voices?” He looked at her with deadly blandness. She turned to [MASK].
<name>Hastings</name>	Hastings	Ullman	I don’t intend to bring any alcohol up here, and I don’t think there will be an opportunity to get any after the snow flies.” “In that you would be quite correct,” [MASK] said.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mommy	“Oh. Is it lying for fun?” “Something very like that.” He had been looking at her closely and now said: “You’re pretty, [MASK].” He frowned in confusion when they exchanged a glance and then burst into laughter.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Wendy	He felt at peace. He stood in the doorway for a long time, breathing the good mountain air, and then he closed it firmly and went back out the other door to tell [MASK] they would be staying.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Grady	Pretty good, considerin the reputation this place has got. I expected some reporter would dig it all up again and just sorta put [MASK] in it as an excuse to rake over the scandals.” “What scandals?”
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Wendy	“You’ve cooked with gas before, [MASK]?” “Yes...” “I love gas,” he said, and turned on one of the burners. Blue flame popped into life and he adjusted it down to a faint glow with a delicate touch.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Danny	[MASK] could read the word EMERGENCY, which was also the name of one of his favorite TV shows, but was unsure of the rest. But he didn’t like the way the word was used in connection with that long flat hose.
<name>Ellis</name>	Ellis	Edmonds	I guess someplace inside I really did mean to do that to him. Or something even worse.” He looked back at [MASK] again. “You know something, Doctor? This is the first time the word divorce has been mentioned between us. And alcoholism.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Watson	But the hedges grow, you see—” (They creep, [MASK] had said ... no, not the hedges, the boiler. You have to watch it all the time or you and your fambly will end up on the fuckin moon.)
<name>Wilma</name>	Wilma	George	There was not a face, precisely, but only a mask of blood through which eyes peered. He brought the mallet back for a final whistling downstroke and it was fully launched before he saw that the supplicating face below him was not [MASK]’s
<name>Curiosity</name>	Curiosity	Curiosity	He was scared that he had taken the passkey again, disobeying his father. He had wanted to come here. [MASK] (killed the cat; satisfaction brought him back) was like a constant fishhook in his brain, a kind of nagging siren song that would not be appeased.
<name>Stephanie</name>	Stephanie	Jack	On the wall by the door going into the bedroom. A whole lot of blood and some other stuff. Gushy stuff. I think ... that the gushy stuff must have been brains.” “Oh my God,” [MASK] said.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Danny	At the far end of the concrete ring, [MASK] heard the stealthy crackle of dead leaves as something came for him on its hands and knees. At any moment he would feel its cold hand close over his ankle— That thought broke his paralysis.
<name>Rosie</name>	Rosie	Lloyd	He turned back, swallowing the rest of the dissolving Excedrin with a grimace. “[MASK], you’re a wonder,” he said. “Set up already. Your speed is only exceeded by the soulful beauty of your Neapolitan eyes.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Danny	He was wearing jeans rolled up to the knee and a red-striped shirt. Farther out on the calm water, a bobber floated. Every now and then [MASK] would reel it in, examine the sinker and hook below it, and then toss it out again.
<name>Baggins</name>	Baggins	Jack	“Oh, dear. A woman half your size and a little boy? Hardly sets you off as being of top managerial timber, does it?” A pulse began to beat in the clockspring of veins at [MASK]’s right temple.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Danny	Clang of firebells . . . not that any fire truck would be able to get up here much before the end of March. Most of all what came through in [MASK]’s thought was a sense of urgent immediacy, a feeling that it was going to happen at any time.
<name>Ennis</name>	Ennis	Wendy	and I was awake . . . and ... I wet my pants. I wet my pants like a baby.” His head fell back against [MASK]’s sweater and he began to cry with horrible weakness, his hands lying limp and spent in his lap.
<name>Rachel</name>	Rachel	Hallorann	[MASK] made a smile and nodded. As advertised the plane came down hard, reuniting with the earth forcefully enough to knock most of the magazines out of the rack at the front and to send plastic trays cascading out of the galley like oversized playing cards.
<name>John</name>	John	Jack	“He’s pushing awfully hard on those readers, too,” she said. “I know he wants to learn how, to please us ... to please you,” she added reluctantly. “To please himself most of all,” [MASK] said.
<name>Danny</name>	Danny	Danny	[MASK] had known what he would see even before he got to the window. Below the clutter of boot tracks, sled tracks, and snowshoe tracks that marked their usual exercise area, the snowfield that covered the Overlook’s lawns sloped down to the topiary and the playground beyond.
<name>Stargirl</name>	Stargirl	Danny	An EEG can tell us lots of things, [MASK].” “Like what?” “Like for instance if you have epilepsy. That’s a little problem where—” “Yeah, I know what epilepsy is.” “Really?” “Sure.
<name>Artie</name>	Artie	Wendy	The more times you phone her, the more times you crawl back begging forgiveness, the more she can beat you with your father. It’s good for her, [MASK], because she can go on making believe it was your fault. But it’s not good for you.
<name>Flay</name>	Flay	Derwent	And still he could see the hammer rising and falling as the clockwork continued to turn and the cogs continued to mesh the gears and teeth of this cunningly made machine. “Unmask! Unmask! ” [MASK] was shrieking behind him, and somewhere a dog was howling in human tones.
<name>Marvin</name>	Marvin	Grady	he screamed. There was no answer. In this well-padded (cell) room, his words did not even echo back to give the illusion of company. “[MASK]! ” No answer. Only the bottles, standing stiffly at attention. (Roll over.
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Danny	On the second or third floor. Looking for [MASK]. She got around the corner, stumbled, almost fell. Her breath caught in her throat. Something (someone?) huddled against the wall about a quarter of the way down from the stairwell.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Danny	Yet there was light coming from somewhere else, white and muted. The fluorescents, of course. In the kitchen. She paused on the thirteenth step, trying to remember if she had turned them off or left them on when she and [MASK] left.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Tony	Tiny red eyes glowed in the dark. The monster was upon him, it had discovered him, cowering here with a blank wall at his back. And the trapdoor in the ceiling was locked. Darkness. Drifting. “[MASK], please take me back, please, please—”
<name>Harker</name>	Harker	Jack	The shower curtain, which he had pushed back to look into the tub, was now drawn. The metallic rattle, which had sounded to him like a stir of bones in a crypt, had been the curtain rings on the overhead bar. [MASK] stared at the curtain.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jack	Right now.” “Just a minute.” He went to the dresser and took his Polaroid Square Shooter out of the top drawer. He rummaged deeper and found some flashcubes. “[MASK], what are you doing?” she asked, a little hysterically.
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	Jacky	He had collapsed in his flapping and untucked hospital whites, dead possibly even before he hit the industrial black-and-red hospital tiles, and three days later the man who had dominated [MASK]’s life, the irrational white ghost-god, was underground.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Danny	“So if you should see something, in a hallway or a room or outside by those hedges . . . just look the other way, and when you look back, it’ll be gone. Are you diggin me?” “Yes,” [MASK] said.
<name>Almustafa</name>	Almustafa	Tony	There were no bad things. And not everything [MASK] showed him always happened. But fear had settled around his heart, deep and dreadful, around his heart and around that indecipherable word he had seen in his spirit’s mirror. CHAPTER FIVE
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Jack	She went to do the dishes. Her back to him, she said: “[MASK]. I’ve been thinking.” “Have you?” He lit a cigarette with trembling hands. No hangover this morning, oddly enough. Only the shakes. He blinked.
<name>She</name>	She	Wendy	You have to understand that.” “Do you mean his arm?” His lips had thinned. “Yes,” [MASK] said, and then she rushed on: “But it’s not just you. I worry when he goes out to play.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Dan	“What was that, [MASK]?” He had turned on the machine. Thin lines began to trace their way across graph paper. “It had all these lights, all different colors. And when you turned it on, some colors would flash but not all.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Jack	You can get the milk. It’s on the floor of the cab.” “That’s all I am to you,” [MASK] cried, clapping a hand to his forehead. “Just a dray horse, a common beast of the field.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Danny	[MASK] was bundled up in a blanket on the small sofa where once, a millon years ago, three nuns had sat laughing like girls while they waited for the line at the desk to thin out. He was sipping hot noodle soup from a mug.
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Hallorann	His face was shiny with tears, and he was shaking as if with ague. Between his clicking teeth he said: “Where were you? We were scared!}” “It’s a good place to be scared of,” [MASK] said slowly.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Danny	So please. What is it you know? I won’t be mad. I can’t be mad, because this is too important. Talk straight to me.” “I know how you feel about her,” [MASK] said, and sighed.
<name>Julie</name>	Julie	Wendy	[MASK] pulled at it as hard as she could, but it wouldn’t move. She couldn’t retract the goddam bolt. It was stupid and unfair . . . she had opened it with no trouble at all when she had gone in to get the can of soup.
<name>Archer</name>	Archer	Ullman	There were rumors that he was found naked except for black nylon stockings and a garter belt and a pair of high-heeled pumps. Patent-leather pumps, as a matter of fact.” “That’s a vicious, damnable lie!” [MASK] cried.
<name>Arnie</name>	Arnie	Jack	He was sawing through the VW’s right front tire. The back tires were already shredded, and the bug sat on the flats like a small, tired dog. [MASK] had seen red, and remembered very little of the encounter that followed.
<name>Doc</name>	Doc	Jack	“Come on, doc,” she said, surprised at the calmness of her own voice. “It’s not your daddy talking, remember. It’s the hotel.” “Come back here and let me out right NOW! ” [MASK] screamed.
<name>I</name>	I	Tony	“Are you sure?” “Yes, sir.” “A moment ago I said you locked the bathroom door. But that wasn’t right, was it? [MASK] locked the door.” “No, sir.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Danny	The boy fell back against the empty shelves and dropped to the floor, dazed. The hand was on her throat again. The red flashes began to turn black. [MASK] was crying weakly. Her chest was burning.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Hallorann	[MASK] heard the whisper and began to turn, to duck, and the roque mallet whistled down. The hood of the parka matted the blow, but not enough. A rocket exploded in his head, leaving a contrail of stars . . . and then nothing.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	George	“I d-didn’t get my whole five mih-minutes. You set it ahead. I was wuh-watching the clock.” “The clock and the timer may keep slightly different times, [MASK], but I never touched the dial on the damned thing.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Jack	Their son was intelligent, they knew that, but it would be a mistake to push him too far too fast. [MASK] had agreed. There would be no pushing involved. But if the kid caught on fast, they would be prepared.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Wendy	He put an arm around [MASK]’s waist. “You happy, babe?” DOWN IN THE FRONT YARD I 171 She looked up at him solemnly. “This is the happiest I’ve been since we were married.” “Is that the truth?”
<name>Roland</name>	Roland	Jack	She jerked her gaze away from the drop almost by force and followed [MASK]’s finger. She could see the highway clinging to the side of this cathedral spire, switching back on itself but always tending northwest, still climbing but at a more gentle angle.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Danny	Her feet tottered over the blackness of the shaft and one pink slipper fell from her foot and slipped out of sight. “Mommy! ” [MASK] screamed. Then she was up, her cheeks flushed, her forehead as pale and shining as a spirit lamp.
<name>Ennis</name>	Ennis	Durkin	This baby will do seventy on hardpack, but on this powder you’ll get no more than fifty and that’s pushing it.” Now they were in the service station’s snow-filled front lot, and [MASK] had raised his voice to make himself heard over the battering of the wind.
<name>David</name>	David	Danny	In the world of real things, the hunt was beginning. [MASK] ran. Feet silent on the heavy carpet, he ran past the closed doors, past the silk figured wallpaper, past the fire extinguisher bolted to the corner of the wall.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Danny	There had been other nights when he had been driving. He pulled the covers up over [MASK], went into their bedroom, and took the Spanish Llama .38 down from the top shelf of the closet. It was in a shoe box.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jack	He dragged the splintered roque mallet after him. Outside the eaves, the wind howled and roared. [MASK]’s eyes rolled wildly in their sockets. There was blood and confetti in his hair. His son was up here, up here somewhere. He could feel it.
<name>Oy</name>	Oy	Danny	Not even the beds were really made up in these guest rooms; the mattresses had been zipped into clear plastic and then covered with bedspreads. He supposed [MASK] might have gone down and gotten it— the passkey would open the linen cupboard—but why?
<name>Archer</name>	Archer	Danny	He was digging at the loose fall of snow that choked the end of the concrete ring, throwing it back between his legs in powdery bursts like a dog digging for a bone. Blue light filtered down from above and [MASK] thrust himself up at it like a diver coming out of deep water.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Hallorann	So be a nice guy. Let me peek.” [MASK] looked into the cop’s calm blue eyes, debated telling his my-son-is-in-critical-condition story anyway, and decided that would make things worse.
<name>Tim</name>	Tim	Jack	She had gotten him aside in the downstairs hallway. The other two were already out in the car, drunkenly singing the New Hampshire fight song. [MASK] was down on one knee, owlishly fumbling with the lacings of his moccasins.
