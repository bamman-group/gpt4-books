<name>darling</name>	darling	Urs	“Don’t bring it here,” he had said. I bent down then to kiss him. “I said, ‘Don’t bring it here, [MASK].’” “I just want to kiss you.” He turned away.
<name>something</name> (There is not enough information in the given passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	something (There is not enough information in the given passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Mutt	I didn’t like the way he said it. I looked at him. “Naw, he’s got just as much right to be here as anybody,” I said. “He bothering you about [MASK]?”
<name>Slim</name>	Slim	Martin	“‘No.’ “ ‘I always like seeing you in here. They ain’t nothing else good about this place.’ “I said nothing. “ ‘My name’s [MASK], what’s yours?’ “I didn’t answer.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Mutt	“[MASK], it ain’t like that. He ain’t tried nothing. He don’t mean nothing to me.” “You got to mean something to him, though, way I see him looking.” “He ain’t even really friendly.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Ursa	“You know it felt good that time.” I looked back at her quickly, but walked on. “Gonna be hard for you, baby,” she said. “[MASK]?” “What?” I stopped, but didn’t turn around.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Cat	But he turned away. Anyway, you knew what was wrong before you snatched after my ass. No, what’s inside my head because those other women they could do it. Afraid of what I. No, I didn’t push it, [MASK].
<name>Bonnie</name>	Bonnie	Mutt	I said I know you from way back. I’m fucking you, ain’t I? Say it.” “[MASK], I . . He laughed. “You ain’t no hard woman, baby.” Stroking my hair, he came.
<name>normal</name>	normal	Missy	“Well, for whatever reason, I’m glad. I was hoping it was for me, though.” I went to hang up my jacket. “Don’t act [MASK],” he said, angry. “What are you talking about?”
<name>Darl</name>	Darl	Awright	He didn’t sit down in the chair by the bed but stayed standing. “[MASK].” “They tell me you been doing some hard cussing while you was sick.” “Yeah.” He didn’t say anything. I could tell he felt awkward.
<name>Pa</name>	Pa	Martin	‘What do we have to do, go up under the house?’ he kept asking me. ‘What do we have to do, go up under the house?’ “ ‘Please, [MASK].’ “He just kept grabbing those fish and cutting them up.
<name>him</name>	him	Tadpole	I don’t know what. Ask yourself how did you feel about [MASK] before all of this happened. I know he’s being good to you, but this is a rush job. Just thinking about the two of y’all getting together is a rush job.
<name>Flint</name>	Flint	Naw	He probably didn’t even know where. He was a seaman. [MASK], a sea captain. That’s why the king give him lands, and slaves and things, but he didn’t hardly use nothing but the womens.
<name>He</name>	He	Tadpole	“Yes, I’d better,” I said. “I was planning to start whether he said so or not.” He took my arm slightly, but I went anyway. We were standing in the door. [MASK] stood aside to let somebody pass.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Corregidora	“[MASK] must’ve done some rejoicing then. He didn’t show it but he must’ve had it all inside. Ole man kept telling me if the boy had just remembered to rub garlic on his feet, the bloodhounds wouldn’t’ve been able to follow.
<name>Cookie</name>	Cookie	Tad	“What about your other need?” I looked at him hard. “Naw, [MASK].” He’d started getting close to me, and put himself up against me, squeezing my ass. “Baby.”
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Ursa	He saw me through the mirror. I hadn’t meant for him to. “What’s wrong, [MASK]?” “Nothing.” “There’s something wrong.” “Naw, they ain’t.” “Come on over here, baby.”
<name>Slim</name>	Slim	Naw	“Yes.” “Do you still fight the night?” “Yes.” “Lonely blues. Don’t you care if you see me again?” “[MASK], I don’t care.” “Don’t you want your original man?”
<name>Janine</name>	Janine	Harold	“[MASK] don’t.” I just stood there. She told me I could sit on the bed, but I wouldn’t. I kept looking at her because I didn’t want to have to look at the other women.
<name>Max</name>	Max	Tad	“Well, okay, day after tomorrow.” “Okay. And first night make it just supper or evening, but not both. I’ll speak to [MASK] if you don’t.” “I don’t think he’d let me sing both anyway.”
<name>Cherry</name>	Cherry	Tadpole	[MASK] looked up. They weren’t doing anything now, but they’d been doing it. I came in the room. “Get your ass out of my bed,” I told the girl. She wasn’t drunk or afraid of me, but she got up and started dressing.
<name>Papa</name>	Papa	Cat	“I said to hush up.” “He look like he haven’t shaved in about a week.” [MASK] hit her up side the head, and she jumped out of the chair, crying, and ran out.
<name>Papa</name>	Papa	Corregidora	“Shit, I’m tired a hearing about [MASK]’s women. Why do you have to remember that old bastard anyway?” I said nothing. “You one of them,” he said. “What?”
<name>Jeffrene's</name>	Jeffrene's	Jeffrene	And after that day, whenever I sawjeffrene, I’d cross the street. I’d never seen [MASK] with anybody myself, but somebody said she was going with one of the women patients down at the narcotics hospital.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Tadpole	He hang around there awhile, peeping in ’cause he can’t come in. You know [MASK] barred him from the place?” I nodded. “Yeah, well, he peep in and then he go on down the street.
<name>Bea</name>	Bea	Jeffy	Before she left, she cut me a hard look. I gave up wondering. I knew if [MASK] had got in the bed with her and started pulling that shit, she would have knocked her on the floor too. She would have knocked her past the floor.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Tadpole	“Yes.” “Get their devils off your back. Not yours, theirs.” I said nothing. I pretended I didn’t know what he meant. [MASK] arranged things with the justice of the peace and we were married.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Mutt	We were both out of our clothes, but we’d done nothing yet. “I can’t, [MASK].” “Hell if you can’t, you got a cunt, ain’t you?” I said nothing. “What’s wrong, baby?
<name>man</name>	man	Jeffy	“Who do you listen to?” I said nothing. “Do you have anybody?” I wouldn’t answer. “You know I got something for you when you ready for it.” “I don’t want no shit from you, [MASK].”
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Urs	I’d taken his hand when the “Don’t embarrass me this way, woman” look had come into his eyes, and we were up on the dance floor when the hard hateful look was back again. “Don’t do that to me no more, [MASK],” he said.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Cat	It was the next day or, rather, later the same day. I was sitting up in bed. [MASK] stood looking at me, then she said, “I’m sorry. I should have told you that was why I didn’t want her in here.”
<name>whoever</name>	whoever	Tadpole	I just didn’t want to bother you now.” “Well, I found out.” He started to leave. “She wasn’t saying nothing about you, [MASK].” “I didn’t say she was.” He went out.
<name>Cat</name>	Cat	Cat	I said nothing. “[MASK] got your tongue?” She grinned. “She always used to wish she had it.” I looked away from her at the traffic light. She was standing close to the building and I was standing out on the sidewalk.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Tadpole	“Did [MASK] tell you what I told him?” “Yeah.” I smiled. “I thought he tell you. I don’t like to come around when women have their evil spells.” She was inside now, sitting on the edge of the bed.
<name>He</name>	He	Cat	She would have knocked her past the floor. It wasn’t so much how much fucking I was going to do now, I was thinking, but the consequences of that fucking. Shit. [MASK] telling me about the consequences of him loving me. Shit.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Tad	“Yeah.” She took the plate out. “She sleep?” It was [MASK]. “Naw, she just got through eating.” “Mind if I go in?” “You just seen her this morning.” “So?”
<name>Janine</name>	Janine	Aw	She said nothing, and then she started telling me how pretty the baby was. “Did you go see him?” “Naw, they wasn’t showing the babies when I got here.” “[MASK]. Maybe you get to see him tomorrow.”
<name>Rider</name>	Rider	Rider	I guess he must’ve been wearing his Dick Tracy coat then. Yeah, if I was an outsider I probably would’ve laughed too. I just stood there trying not to let my embarrassment show in my voice. I sang “See See [MASK].”
<name>Luella</name>	Luella	Wayne	“Naw, that was Luella you seen with [MASK]. I was just watching.” “Well, that means you twice as nasty.” “I bet you was fucking before I was born. How much fucking you think you goin do now?”
<name>Doctor</name>	Doctor	Jim	“You did fine. It’s good to see you back.” I said nothing. Then I said, “Tell him to go away, [MASK].” “He worries.” “Tell him I’m all right, and he can go away.”
<name>yes</name>	yes	Naw	He asked if I wanted to wait downstairs for him, but I said [MASK], I said I’d go up. I guess I was thinking if I didn’t it would be like saying that I didn’t trust him.
<name>baby</name>	baby	Urs	“She still working for you, though, ain’t she?” “Yeah, she need the job, baby. She . . . she not well taken care of.” I laughed. “[MASK], you know you the only woman I want.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Mutt	The shy ones. I mean, since they don’t come to the womens, the womens got to come to them.” “Like you?” He said, “Shit.” The next night I heard some men laughing at [MASK].
<name>honey</name>	honey	Ursa	He was still in good spirits. “I think I can get off,” I said coolly. “Come on, [MASK], baby, don’t act that way. We need a little night out together, don’t you think?” I nodded.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Honey	“You know you too good to lose,” he said finally. “You won’t touch me no more?” It was more of a plea than a question. “[MASK], I ain’t gonna lay a hand on you.”
<name>I</name>	I	Jim	“Naw, he wasn’t going to try to do that.” He still didn’t ask me what [MASK] wanted. I was glad. His hands were gentle hard on my belly, then stroking my thighs. “I love you,” he said.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Ursa	Young as she is too. Girl like that, it ain’t nothing but shaking hands. Let her see how hard he’s gon be shaking her hand now. Nothing but shaking hands. I reckon you listen to me now, [MASK].” I said nothing.
<name>Samson</name>	Samson	Grandmama	The last time I was here, when [MASK] died, he still had that pair of scissors and the comb. The older men still kept him, but the younger ones, who had started wearing afros, were saying they had their own scissors and comb.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Ursa	But it was like it knew it wanted you. It was like my whole body knew it wanted you, and knew it would have you, and knew you’d be a girl. But something got into me after that night, though, [MASK].
<name>Brett</name>	Brett	Jeffy	“Naw, I’m not afraid of you.” She said nothing, then she looked at me and smiled. “I don’t think I’m taking too much for granted if I say you are.” “[MASK], I’ve got to go.”
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Harold	“She’s the only one in the family that’s ugly. I don’t see what [MASK]’s daddy see in her anyway, except but she’s probably real good in the bed.” I said nothing. I just kept staring out at the two women.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Mutt	Even when I felt excited about seeing him, I knew I hadn’t forgiven him too. I think he knew that as well, even when I finished and came over to the table. He said nothing. I said, “How are you, [MASK]?”
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Martin	‘Messing with my girl, he ain’t had no bit of right.’ “After that, whenever [MASK] wanted to get from one part of the house to the next, he’d go around the house . . .
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Naw	He’s got right evil these days.” “Yeah. [MASK], I wasn’t sleeping.” “Just thinking?” “Yeah.” “I seen you staring wide-eyed at the ceiling, and didn’t know if I should disturb that either.”
<name>dad</name>	dad	Mutt	I saw some people looking my way. “No, [MASK],” I said quiet, trying to give him the “Don’t embarrass me this way, man” look, but it didn’t come off.
<name>Deckard</name>	Deckard	Naw	“You weren’t sleeping well again.” “I’m all right. Is it morning?” “Almost.” “You said they never told you anything about your past. I mean theirs. That’s the same as yours.” “[MASK].
<name>partner</name>	partner	Naw	I could feel my eyebrows pulling together. “You got just as much right to be here as anybody, you hear.” “You trying to get dangerous?” “[MASK], I’m not trying to get dangerous,” I said. I walked away.
<name>Ally</name>	Ally	Mutt	“You’ll come back.” “If I do, I’ll come with all my memories. I won’t forget anything.” “I’d rather have you with them, than not have you.” “[MASK], don’t.”
<name>Mrs. Dubose</name>	Mrs. Dubose	Sal	“Yeah, I b’lieve he’s coming. I don’t know why I said that.” [MASK] stood up. “Thank you,” I said. She didn’t say anything, she just looked at me, then she went out.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jeffy	If she do, she haven’t told me. They say [MASK]’s daddy, something was wrong with him. But I didn’t know him myself.” “You ask me, something must be wrong with all of’em.” “Naw, don’t get into that.
<name>he</name>	he	Tadpole	When I got back, [MASK] was still frowning. “What did he say?” “Anytime I feel like it.” “I’ll go ask him myself.” “No. He said anytime I feel like it, after the next two weeks.
<name>Sula</name>	Sula	Ursa	Then the quivering started about her mouth again. “It was like my whole body wanted you, [MASK]. Can you understand that?” “Yes, I can understand.” “I knew you was gonna come out a girl even while you was in me.
<name>Jem</name>	Jem	Cat	He went back out. I smiled. I heard the front door close, then [MASK] came in. “That nigger both’ring you?” “Naw.” “Well, if he bothers you, tell me, and I won’t let him come in here.”
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Cat	The screen door banged. “You know that woman’s sick in there. You ought to wait.” “Sick or not sick they’s things she’s got to be told.” “Shhh.” [MASK] didn’t shhh, she talked louder.
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Jeff	“[MASK] be up in a little while. I got her down there drying the dishes, and I told her to come on up here. Well, I see you tomorrow morning then. I ain’t hardly got no sleep and they going to have me standing up all night.
<name>Buddy's</name>	Buddy's	Jeffy	“Yeah.” I didn’t say what I was going to. “She just stay over there. I’m taking up [MASK]’s space.” “That ain’t why you here,” he said. I started to tell him, but didn’t.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Tadpole	“I’m filing suit for divorce.” “Well, when I looked out and saw that man standing there I thought you’d stopped blaming him.” I said nothing, and stood up. When I got outside, [MASK] came over and took my elbow.
<name>God</name>	God	Tadpole	You know I’m sorry. All I wanted to do was take care of you like a husband should.’ Now, what good am I for a man?” “Why don’t you ask [MASK] that?” I told her to go to hell.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Cat	I didn’t smile this time, but she was still looking at me as if she liked me for the first time. “No, I’m not bothered,” I repeated. “[MASK] thinks you’re beautiful,” she said, smiling, showing two gold teeth.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Mutt	That’s what y’all wont, ain’t it? Piece a ass. I said I got a piece a ass for sale, anybody wont to bid on it?” “[MASK], you wouldn’t.” “You think I won’t.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Mutt	“[MASK], please.” He was holding my shoulders tight, so that even if I hadn’t been too embarrassed to move away from him, I couldn’t have. Each time he would try to fit himself between my legs, I would move a little to the side.
<name>Emmett</name>	Emmett	Corregidora	“Naw, he said he wouldn’t’ve been nothing but a waste of my pussy, cause he said my pussy bring gold. But what was funny after that they kept claiming he did something. Not [MASK], but this black man.
<name>they</name>	they	Cat	My veins are centuries meeting. You scratched behind my ear and drew blood and then kissed where you scratched. You can’t kiss where you scratched anymore. No, anyway, I don’t believe what [MASK] said your reasons are. You don’t treat love that way.
<name>Big Walter</name>	Big Walter	Logan	“You show your ass to these mens and then when they try to get on it, you say Uh-uh, uh-uh.” He kept waving his hands. [MASK] came over and wanted to put him out. But I said No.
<name>me</name>	me	Mutt	“Naw, he didn’t say nothing about [MASK].” “I’ll let you turn in,” he said. “What if I’d said yes?” “I’d go ask him what right’s he got to be here.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Tadpole	“Well, I let you rest. If you wont something, just holler.” I said I would. “He leave you alone, didn’t he?” “Who?” “[MASK].” “Yeah, he left me alone.”
<name>Sally</name>	Sally	Corregidora	And then that’s when the officials burned all the papers cause they wanted to play like what had happened before never did happen. But I know it happened, I bear witness that it happened. Yeah, and [MASK]’s whores was free too, but most of ’em
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Ursa	He just stopped and stood stone still. He hated me, [MASK]. I know he did. I was holding myself all up on my face, and I know I was going to be black and blue all over, it hurt so bad.
<name>Raynell</name>	Raynell	Urs	His sperm inside me. Then we lay back together, exhausted, ready to sleep. “[MASK], he’s going to wont more.’’ “He knows what I ain’t got. Don’t talk to me. I don’t know you.”
<name>partner</name>	partner	Mutt	When I got home he was sitting at the dresser. He didn’t turn around to look at me because he could see me through the mirror. I closed the door and stood looking at him. “I’m glad you didn’t, [MASK].”
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Lurene	[MASK]’s crazy about men as you are. “Yeah, I heard her talking about some dude she got at work.” “Yeah, well, he help to make her day. Or I should say make her night.” I laughed.
<name>Baby</name>	Baby	Ursa	I sang all his favorite songs to try to make up to him. The next time he said, “[MASK], baby,” I let him do a little bit more of what he wanted, but this time he was the one who stopped himself.
<name>Cherry</name>	Cherry	Sal	“I didn’t bother you, did I?” [MASK] asked. “Naw, you didn’t bother me,” I said. I didn’t smile this time, but she was still looking at me as if she liked me for the first time.
<name>but</name>	but	Cat	But with a man, it’s easy to just push it away. The doctor said there wasn’t anything wrong with me, [MASK]. I didn’t go back, because there was nothing wrong, and he said it looked all right down there.
<name>any proper name</name> (as there is no context or clues provided in the passage to suggest a specific name)	any proper name (as there is no context or clues provided in the passage to suggest a specific name)	Tadpole	It’s a long story. Too long for now.” “Will you tell me sometime?” “Yes.” I never really told him. I gave him only pieces. A few more pieces than I’d given [MASK], but still pieces.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Logan	He was almost across the table at me, then he stopped, and sat back, as if he were exhausted. All the time he was talking, I could see [MASK] eyeing us, as if he were ready to come over any moment at my signal.
<name>Mrs. Dubose</name>	Mrs. Dubose	Cat	“[MASK] don’t allow nobody to sleep on the couch, because she says it’s the only decent thing she got and she wonts to keep it decent.” “And you ain’t going back over there?” “Naw.”
<name>her</name>	her	Catherine	I stopped, but didn’t turn around. “Maybe you can go see her? Maybe you can help her get her ass together.” She said it like she meant it, but still it strangled any impulse I’d had to go see [MASK].
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Sal	But I bet [MASK] must’ve been surprised when he said who it was he asked. Well, I was surprised myself him asking me, though some people say I don’t look my age, I look younger than my age. I just tell them it’s hereditary.
<name>Ma Rainey</name>	Ma Rainey	Cat	I’d put on my robe but hadn’t dressed. I sat back down on the bed. Then I started singing about trouble in mind. Still the new voice. The one [MASK] said you could hear what I’d been through in.
<name>Baby</name>	Baby	Mutt	“Let me get up in your hole, I said. I wont to get up in your goddamn hole.” “I wanted to give you something, [MASK], but now I can’t give you anything. I never told you how it was.
<name>Momma</name>	Momma	Jim	I was standing, speaking low so I wouldn’t draw attention. “I don’t know what’s wrong with you, woman,” he said loud. People turned and looked. I was embarrassed. “Okay, [MASK],” I said, again low.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Harold	I said, “Naw.” “I’ll show it to you if you show me yours,” she said. “Naw.” “Reason I got a bigger hole than you got is cause [MASK] been in me.”
<name>Harlem</name>	Harlem	Nigger	“[MASK], get out of here.” “You said I could sleep with you.” “Then shut up and sleep. I told you I know how to slap shit too.” “You supposed to be sick. You ain’t sick.”
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Gus	And then we sat down to eat, and I bit down on a piece and it had blood coming out of it. And [MASK], that’s his brother, was just saying, ‘Good, ain’t it?’
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Naw	[MASK], I don’t know what I would’ve done if she hadn’t come. He wanted to keep me, the bastard. But it’s hard to always remember what you were feeling when you ain’t feeling it exactly that way no more.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Corregidora	“When [MASK] had that stroke he didn’t call in his men, he called in his women and said he’d give them any amount of money they wonted if they take it off him, but they said didn’t none of them put it on him.”
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Ella	After a while, he said very quietly, “You got somebody?” I said, “No.” He smiled a little. “Yeah, she’s my woman. Her and [MASK]. The rest of em can’t do nothing for me.
<name>Doctor</name>	Doctor	Tad	“Yes, a little.” “Did they say you could do it?” “Yes, we can do it.” “How does it feel now?” tc /-i Go on. “How did you sleep?” [MASK] asked.
<name>beauty</name>	beauty	Corregidora	Because I realized for the first time I had what all those women had. I’d always thought I was different. Their daughter, but somehow different. Maybe less [MASK]. I don’t know. But when I saw that picture, I knew I had it.
<name>Laura</name>	Laura	Awright	I said nothing. She was telling me she knew about my own private memory. “Do you want me to talk?” “Sometime when you’re back here and feel you have to.” “[MASK].” She pulled her shawl around her tighter.
