<name>Janine</name>	Janine	Mattie	“Come on, let’s make sure that’s the only one.” They ran back to the wall and started prying at another stained brick, [MASK] digging into the crumbling mortar with her barbecue fork. She finally got it out and threw it behind her.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Lorraine	She got up from the table. “Call me when dinner’s ready, I’m going back to read.” She stopped at the kitchen door. “Now, why are you putting gravy on that chicken, [MASK]? You know it’s fattening.”
<name>you</name>	you	Ben	You wanted me to be independent of other people and look to you for the way I should feel about myself, cut myself off from the world, and join you in some crazy idea about being different. When I’m with [MASK], I don’t feel any different from anybody else in the world.”
<name>Rachel</name>	Rachel	Lorraine	[MASK], who just wants to be a human being—a lousy human being who’s somebody’s daughter or somebody’s friend or even somebody’s enemy. But they make me feel like a freak out there, and you try to make me feel like one in here.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Miss	“[MASK], you all right?” She pressed her ftps tightly together and nodded her head. The lightness of his touch brought tears to her eyes, and she squeezed them shut. “You sure? You look ’bout ready to keel over.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Lorraine	[MASK] shouted. “I’ve accepted it all my life, and it’s nothing I’m ashamed of. I lost a father because I refused to be ashamed of it—but it doesn’t make me any different from anyone else in the world. ”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Ben	It didn’t matter if they often repeated what had been said or if their monologues held no relevance to the issues; each one fought for the space to outshine the other. “[MASK] ain’t got no reason to be here. He works for the landlord.”
<name>the baby</name>	the baby	Mattie	Look a’ them fat legs, pretty red thing, you. I was always partial to reddish men. My second husband was his color, but did he have a temper.” And she cooed and talked to the baby and [MASK] as if she had known them for years.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Eugene	[MASK], seeing that he had been left alone, turned off the stereo and came and stood in the kitchen door. “I lost my job today,” he shot at her, as if she had been the cause.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Ciel	[MASK] was starting to cry. “But I kept saying one day when I’ve gotten rid of the scars, when I’m really well and over all that’s happened so that she can be proud of me, then I’ll write and let her know.”
<name>her</name>	her	Mattie	Other than that, I got nothing to say to you.” He left [MASK] sitting there, understanding his frustration but wishing he had chosen a kinder way of hurting her, by just hitting her in the face.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Theresa	I’ve told her a million times to be careful on those skates, but you know . . .” “Yeah, right,” [MASK] said, watching them go. “I know.” She balled the tissue in her hand and quickly walked into the building.
<name>Mr. Stevens</name>	Mr. Stevens	Lorraine	[MASK] tilted the picture toward the light. The face stamped on the celluloid paper bore absolutely no resemblance to her at all. His daughter’s face was oval and dark, and she had a large flat nose and a tiny rounded mouth.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Lorraine	[MASK] smelled the claw-edged sweetness of the marijuana in the shadowy alley before she had gone more than fifty feet in. She stopped and peered through the leaden darkness toward the end and saw no one. She took a few more cautious steps and stopped to look again.
<name>someone</name> (There is no clear indication of a specific name in this passage)	someone (There is no clear indication of a specific name in this passage)	Serena	The friction on the towels increased when she came to the month that she had gotten pregnant again, but it couldn’t be that. Things were different now. She wasn’t sick as she had been with [MASK], he was still working—no it wasn’t the baby.
<name>Mrs. Dubose</name>	Mrs. Dubose	Missy	“What a way to talk.” She snatched him and flung him into the apartment. “[MASK], I’m sorry. Did he steal something from you? He’s always taking things and I’ve beat him about it but he still won’t stop.
<name>Janet</name>	Janet	Kiswana	“I’ll take the minutes for you.” “Oh, thank you.” [MASK] hurriedly gathered the scattered and crumpled papers and handed them to her. “Now we can get back down to business.”
<name>Ma Joad</name>	Ma Joad	Etta	Where I come from we know clouds don’t always mean rain—ain’t it so, [MASK]?” “Sure is. Many a day I was working in my daddy’s fields and would spot a cloud and pray for it to send some rain so I could rest.
<name>Ed</name>	Ed	Etta	Guess he ain’t been as lucky as you yet. Ain’t run out of highway to stop and make him think.” [MASK] came back to the table out of breath. “Well, looka you!”
<name>She</name>	She	Etta	Since [MASK] had stopped at a Mobil station three blocks away to wash off the evidence of a hot, dusty 1200-mile odyssey home, the chrome caught the rays of the high afternoon sun and flung them back into its face. She had chosen her time well.
<name>Skeeter</name>	Skeeter	Mattie	[MASK] didn’t know if it was the seasoned food or the warm air in the kitchen, but she felt herself settling like fine dust on her surroundings and accepting the unexplained kindness of the woman with a hunger of which she had been unaware.
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Mattie	[MASK] stared at him, and she thought about the blonde girl in the silver frame on his desk. “If it was your daughter locked up in a place like that,” she said angrily, “could you stand there and say the same thing?”
<name>the man</name>	the man	Ben	The face stamped on the celluloid paper bore absolutely no resemblance to her at all. His daughter’s face was oval and dark, and she had a large flat nose and a tiny rounded mouth. She handed the picture back to [MASK] and tried to cover her confusion.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Theresa	[MASK] bent down beside her and clucked her teeth loudly. “Oh, you did? Let’s see.” She helped her off the ground and made an exaggerated fuss over the scraped knee. “It’s bleeding!” The child’s voice rose in horror.
<name>She</name>	She	Mattie	[MASK] couldn’t remember either. There had been a bus ride with a foreman in the shipping department at her job, and she had gone out a few times with one of the ushers in her church—but that was last spring, or was it last winter?
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Ciel	[MASK] sat in the bed with her back resting against the headboard; her long thin fingers, still as midnight frost on a frozen pond, lay on the covers. She acknowledged their kindnesses with nods of her head and slight lip movements, but no sound.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Ciel	[MASK] shrugged her shoulders. “I don’t know, like me I guess—tall, skinny.” She frowned for a moment. “But she was light-skinned and her hair was different—yes, longer, but pinned up somehow.”
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Mattie	A hand touched her shoulder, and [MASK] gave a small cry. “Didn’t mean to startle you, mam, but it’s snowing pretty bad, and we gotta move this stuff upstairs. Would you please go up and unlock the door?”
<name>She</name>	She	Lorraine	He turned on the single light bulb that was hanging from the ceiling by a thick black cord and pulled out a chair for her at the kitchen table, which was propped up against the wall. [MASK] sat down, grateful to be able to take the weight off of her shaky knees.
<name>Sissy</name>	Sissy	Mattie	[MASK] looked up, stricken. “You leaving?” “Yeah, honey. I was ready months ago, but when you wrote and said you were cornin’, I stuck around to see you settled with the baby. But this town is dead. ”
<name>Mrs. Peters</name>	Mrs. Peters	Cora	“Sure, and please tell him I thought it was wonderful.” “I will. See you later.” [MASK] and her family moved home through the moist summer night, and she smiled as the children chattered and tried to imitate some of the antics they had seen.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Kiswana	Huh? I told ya a million times to stop swinging on my curtains, so good for you!” [MASK] pushed past her and went toward the screaming child. “Maybe he’s hurt his head.” “Naw, he’s always falling from something.
<name>probably</name>	probably	Theresa	You can call yourself that if you want to, but I’m not like that. Do you hear me? I’m not!” She slammed the drawer shut. So she can turn on me but she wouldn’t say a word to that scum in the streets, [MASK] thought.
<name>She</name>	She	Mattie	She resorted to eating her lunch while she rushed through the streets, because she got dizzy in the afternoon from the heat of the factory and the smell of the strong glue on an empty stomach. [MASK] couldn’t seem to save enough money to move.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Cora	[MASK] couldn’t understand what the actors were saying, but she had never heard black people use such fine-sounding words, and they really seemed to know what they were talking about—no one was forgetting the fines or anything.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Lord	“[MASK], he’s heavy. How’d you tote him all day? Look a’ them fat legs, pretty red thing, you. I was always partial to reddish men. My second husband was his color, but did he have a temper.”
<name>He</name>	He	Ben	He placed a blackened pot of water on the hot plate at the edge of the counter, then found two cups in the cabinet that still had their handles intact. [MASK] put the strong black tea he had brewed in front of her and brought her a spoon and a crumpled pound bag of sugar.
<name>man</name>	man	Ciel	He slammed down the top of the suitcase and yanked it off the bed. “You’re lying, aren’t you? You don’t have a job, do you? Do you?” “Look, [MASK], believe whatever the fuck you want to.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Etta	“Well, look a here,” [MASK] marveled as she stroked the cracked red fist of the baby. “We come a long way from the time the old folks told us babies were mailed from heaven. ‘C.O.D. or Special Delivery?’
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Lorraine	“I mean, can anybody just waltz in here and get shoved down our throats and we don’t have a say about it?” “Look, I can just go,” [MASK] said. “I just wanted to help, I—” “No, wait.”
<name>Bubba</name>	Bubba	Ben	He works for the landlord.” A few scattered yeahs came from around the room. “I lives in this here block just like y’all,” [MASK] said slowly. “And when you ain’t got no heat, I ain’t either.
<name>Irene</name>	Irene	Mattie	And yet, somehow, back there it had been played to a music that had totally distorted the steps for her friend. [MASK] suddenly felt the helplessness of a person who is forced to explain that for which there are no words. She quietly turned her back and started down the steps.
<name>Mrs. Watts</name>	Mrs. Watts	Ben	“I’d be right hurt if you did.” [MASK] patted her arm. “Now come back anytime you got a mind to. I got nothing, but you welcome to all of that. Now how many folks is that generous?”
<name>Sugar</name>	Sugar	Eugene	Turning to him, she silently acquiesced. “All right, [MASK], what do you want me to do?” He wasn’t going to let her off so easily. “Hey, baby, look, I don’t care what you do.
<name>Granny</name>	Granny	Cora	“No, he’s already had one. And if he don’t get away from here, he’s not gonna have any teeth left to eat nothin’ with!” [MASK] made an attempt to lift herself off the stoop. “You ole big belly!”
<name>She</name>	She	Etta	[MASK] didn’t know if this was to keep the distance on her side or theirs, but it was there. And she had learned to tread through these alien undercurrents so well that to a casual observer she had mastered the ancient secret of walking on water.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Lorraine	“Must I what, [MASK]? Must I talk about things that are as much a part of life as eating or breathing or growing old? Why are you always so uptight about sex or men?” “I’m not uptight about anything.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Ben	“I still send those cards like that—without a return address. That way I can believe that, maybe, one year before he dies, he’ll open them.” [MASK] got up and gave her a piece of toilet paper to blow her nose in.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Abshu	No one was talking to you.” The muscular tan boy spit out his cigarette and squared his shoulders. “I ain’t got to do nothin’! And I’m gonna tell [MASK] you need a good spankin’ for taking up with a lesbo.”
<name>she</name>	she	Mattie	If nothing Monday, she must show at work for Tuesday. Who would keep the baby? She could go home. Home. Home. In her confusion [MASK] had circled the same block twice. She remembered passing that old white woman just minutes before.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Cora	“There’s a big knot coming up on the side of his head; maybe we should take him . . .” “It’ll go down,” [MASK] said and went to the couch and picked up the baby.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Theresa	Let’s see.” She helped her off the ground and made an exaggerated fuss over the scraped knee. “It’s bleeding!” The child’s voice rose in horror. [MASK] looked at the tiny specks of blood that were beading up on the grimy knee.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Mattie	[MASK] stopped talking because she knew she probably sounded like a complete fool to the woman, but she was so tired that she couldn’t think, and her legs were starting to tremble from lack of sleep and the heavy load she had carried around all day.
<name>Laura</name>	Laura	Tee	[MASK] would still be up, probably waiting at that window, so certain that she would be returning soon. She thought about taking a bus downtown to a movie, but she really didn’t want to be alone. If she only had some friends in this city.
<name>Jelly Roll</name>	Jelly Roll	Ciel	“Woman, ain’t you done enough dancing today for a lifetime?” “Aw, hush your mouth. [MASK], will you tell this woman that this here is a party and you supposed to be having a good time.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Sophie	And then it was everywhere—lining the mouths and whitening the lips of everyone as they wrinkled up their noses at its pervading smell, unable to pinpoint the source or time of its initial arrival. [MASK] could—she had been there.
<name>Dolores</name>	Dolores	Theresa	[MASK] stood over her and clenched her hands to keep herself from reaching out and comforting her. Let her cry. She had to smarten up. She couldn’t spend the rest of her life in basements, talking to winos and building cardboard worlds that were just going to come crashing down around her ears.
<name>Mrs. Johnson</name>	Mrs. Johnson	Mattie	“What they doin’—livin’ there like that—is wrong, and you know it.” She turned to appeal to [MASK]. “Now, you a Christian woman. The Good Book say that them things is an abomination against the Lord.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Bruce	She called to [MASK], “Now come on over here and sit down. No more ball for you.” “I don’t wanna sit down. I wanna piece of cake. ” “I ain’t got no more money for cake.”
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Kiswana	“Don’t put words into my mouth, young lady. I’m perfectly capable of saying what I mean.” Amen, thought [MASK]. “And I don’t know why you’ve been trying to start up with me from the moment I walked in.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Mattie	As a matter of fact, if you have anything you would like to discuss with me this evening, I’d be glad to escort you home.” “I don’t have my own place. You see, I’m just up from out of state and staying with my friend [MASK] here.”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Ben	What do they do with all them chocolate chip cookies? It was surely a sign, but it would take some time to figure that one out. She saw [MASK] go into their apartment, and she waited and blocked his path as he came out, carrying his toolbox.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Ben	It ain’t like this shit you got us livin’ in. It take her longer to do things than most folks. You know that, so why stand there carryin’ on like it mean more than that?” “She ain’t finished yet, [MASK].”
<name>Dr. Jekyll</name>	Dr. Jekyll	Basil	“Lady, you forgot the visiting hours.” “No, I didn’t,” she said, without turning around, and went through the door. There was no need to worry, the bifocals kept telling her later that day, after seeing [MASK].
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Mattie	She combed her fingers confidently through the thick sandy hair that only needed slight tinting at the roots and mentally gave herself another fifteen years before she had to worry about this ultimate fate. [MASK], watching the creeping tiredness in her eyes, gave her five.
<name>Brick</name>	Brick	Mattie	I was just trying to figure out what number I could play off your dream. Now, I know snakes is 436 and a blue Cadillac is 224, but I gotta look in my book to see what a wall is. What do ya play off a wall, [MASK]?”
<name>Mayella</name>	Mayella	Ciel	“And she had on a green dress with like black trimming, and there were red designs or red flowers or something on the front. ” [MASK]’s eyes began to cloud. “And something bad had happened to me by the wall—I mean to her—something bad had happened to her.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Kiswana	And I never got a minute’s sleep. When you pregnant you can’t sleep good at night—kept having all kinds of weird dreams. ” “I know.” [MASK] nodded. “I hoped it would stop raining for the party today.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Elvira	[MASK]’s voice was shrill. “So it’s a big house. It ain’t like this shit you got us livin’ in. It take her longer to do things than most folks. You know that, so why stand there carryin’ on like it mean more than that?”
<name>her</name>	her	Kiswana	She plowed through the remains of their faded mists, unconscious of the lingering wisps of their presence on her leather bag and black fur-trimmed coat. It took a few seconds for this transfer from one realm to another to reach [MASK], but then suddenly she recognized the woman.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Etta	And if your church is so frill of upright Christian men, why you ain’t snagged one yet?” “[MASK], I done banked them fires a long time ago, but seeing that you still keeping up steam ...” Her eyes were full of playful kindness.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Mattie	“I ain’t making no joke, child.” And her watery eyes clouded over as she stared at the younger woman. [MASK] knew that look well. The old woman wanted a confrontation and would not be budged. “Ain’t you ever had no needs in that direction?
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Dorian	She looked to see if she would have to sneak her strap out of her bag, but the children were surprisingly still, except for [MASK], and she only had to jab him twice because when they changed the set for the forest scenes, even he was awed.
<name>He</name>	He	Mattie	Ain’t you all taking the long way to the levee, though?” He sat watching them, chewing slowly on his tobacco. [MASK] could think of nothing to say and swung the machete as if the answer lay in the widening arc of the blade.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Mattie	There is a time for silence. A time to let go and allow people to hurl themselves into their own destiny. And a time to prepare to pick up the pieces when it’s all over. [MASK] realized that this moment called for all three.
<name>Bobby</name>	Bobby	Theresa	“What’s all the shouting for? Who are you talking to?” She saw [MASK] running back and forth across the kitchen, throwing their dinner out of the window. “Have you lost your mind?”
<name>the baby</name>	the baby	Serena	He’s got a new job on the docks that pays real good, and he was just so depressed before with the new baby and no work. You’ll see. He’s even gone out now to buy paint and stuff to fix up the apartment. And, and [MASK] needs a daddy.”
<name>Louise</name>	Louise	Tee	Even if [MASK] was still in that window, she couldn’t see that far down the block. She would just tap lightly on his door, and if he wasn’t too drunk to hear her, then he wouldn’t be too far gone to listen tonight.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Virgil	My daddy hunted us down for three months and then drug me home and kept me locked in my room for weeks with the windows all nailed up. But soon as he let me out, [MASK] came back and got me, and we was off again.”
<name>him</name>	him	Etta	“Maybe that’s why some women get so riled up about it, ’cause they know deep down it’s not so different after all.” She looked at [MASK]. “It kinda gives you a funny feeling when you think about it that Way, though.”
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Serena	[MASK] gave a cry of delight and attempted to catch her lost playmate, but it was too quick and darted back into the wall. She tried once again to poke her finger into the slit. Then a bright slender object, lying dropped and forgotten, came into her view.
<name>Laurie</name>	Laurie	Kiswana	“Ya laughing at me, huh, freak? I oughta come over there and stick my fist in your cunt-eatin’ mouth!” “You’ll have to come through me first, so just try it.” [MASK] put her books on the stoop.
<name>She</name>	She	Basil	The lawyer called at the end of the second week to remind them of the court appointment, and [MASK] grew irritable. He told her he hated the thought of that place. He had tried to pretend that it didn’t exist, and he had been so happy.
<name>Blind Pew</name>	Blind Pew	Ben	[MASK] had come out of the basement and was sitting in his usual place on an old garbage can he had pushed up against the wall. And he was singing and swaying while taking small sips from the pint bottle he kept in his back pocket.
<name>Marion</name>	Marion	Mattie	“Who beat you up? Where are you?” As the late November winds cut across her legs and blew under her coat, [MASK] shivered violently and realized that she had rushed from the house without any slip or stockings.
<name>she</name>	she	Kiswana	You should do it more often.” “Well, since it’s not Sunday, I guess you’re allowed at least one lie.” They both laughed. After [MASK] had closed the door and turned around, she spotted an envelope sticking between the cushions of her couch.
<name>Presley</name>	Presley	Sonya	She had loved school; she always went to school—not like them. Why didn’t her babies go to school? She shook her head confusedly. No, babies didn’t go to school. [MASK] was her baby and she was too little for school.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Etta	The children’s curiosity reached the end of its short life span, and they drifted back to their various games. The adults sucked their teeth in disappointment, and the more envious felt self-righteousness twist the comers of their mouths. It was only [MASK].
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Fannie	He stared stupidly at the barrel of the gun and then at the stick in his fist and then at the girl balled up in spasms on the floor. His head kept moving numbly back and forth, like a badly timed mechanical toy. “[MASK], I . . .
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Mattie	It was rare that [MASK] ever spoke more than two sentences to anybody about anything. She didn’t have to. She chose her words with the grinding precision of a diamond cutter’s drill. “You think I’m a fool, don’t you?”
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Mattie	[MASK] paid the driver and got out of the cab. The moist gray air was as heavy as the sigh that lay on her full bosom. The ashen buildings were beginning to fade against the gentle blanketing of the furry gray snow coming from the darkening sky.
<name>Abby</name>	Abby	Cora	“Blood—there’s still blood on this wall,” [MASK] whispered, and dropped to her knees. She took the Popsicle stick and started digging around the loose mortar near the brick. “It ain’t right; it just ain’t right.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Lorraine	No, it was that old man—that’s what it was. Why was [MASK] spending so much time with that drunk? They didn’t have a damn thing in common. What could he be telling her, doing for her, that was causing this?
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Mattie	“You been saying that for five years!” [MASK] was frustrated. “And you been movin’ every time I mention anything about that little spoiled nigger of yours. You still saving my rent money in the bank, ain’t you?” “Of course.”
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Cora	[MASK] applauded until her hands tingled, and felt a strange sense of emptiness now that it was over. Oh, if they would only do it again. She let the children jump around their seats and dance to the music that continued after the play was over.
<name>Elvira</name>	Elvira	Mattie	To tell you the truth, I had planned on stayin’ till I’m a hundred.” Please do, [MASK] thought sadly, and then said aloud, “No, I couldn’t bear you that long—maybe till ninety-nine and a half.”
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Kiswana	“Uh-huh, I knew you’d get around to that before long.” [MASK] could feel the rings of anger begin to tighten around her lower backbone, and they sent her forward onto the couch. “You’ll never understand, will you?
<name>Curley's wife</name>	Curley's wife	Ben	[MASK] waited for her face to register the effects of the hot sweet liquid. “I liked you from first off,” he said shyly, and seeing her smile, he continued. “You remind me lots of my little girl.”
<name>June</name>	June	Mattie	I can’t exactly put my finger on it, but ...” “Maybe it’s not so different,” [MASK] said, almost to herself. “Maybe that’s why some women get so riled up about it, ’cause they know deep down it’s not so different after all.”
<name>Stanley</name>	Stanley	Bennett	Now me, when I want ready-made trouble, I dig up a handsome man. No diapers to change, and I can walk when I’m ready. And that’s just about what I’m fixin’ to do; [MASK] is starting to fray my nerves.”
