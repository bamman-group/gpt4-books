<name>Harding</name>	Harding	Blore	The General frowned and said: "You don't understand—you don't understand at all. Please go away." [MASK] retreated. He said, as he joined the other two: ___ "He's crazy ... It's no good talking to him."
<name>Poirot</name>	Poirot	Wargrave	He murmured: "Coronation machine. Quite new—no defects. Ensign paper—the most widely used make. You won't get anything out of that. Might be fingerprints, but I doubt it." [MASK] stared at him with sudden attention.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Lombard	Anyone will tell you the same. There was never a word said against us. Not a word." [MASK] looked thoughtfully at the man's twitching face, his dry lips, the fright in his eyes. He remembered the crash of the falling coffee tray.
<name>Travers</name>	Travers	Lombard	The judge sat in his habitual pose, his head sunk down into his neck. With one hand he gently scratched his ear. Only his eyes were active, darting round and round the room, puzzled, alert with intelligence. Again it was [MASK] who acted.
<name>Poirot</name>	Poirot	Philip	He was spreadeagled on the stone terrace on the east side, his head crushed and mangled by a great block of white marble. [MASK] looked up. He said: f "Whose is that window just above?"
<name>John</name>	John	Lombard	She said in a slightly breathless voice: "And supposing he gets—us?" [MASK] said softly, patting the revolver in his pocket: "I'm going to take very good care he doesn't." Then he looked at her curiously.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Vera	[MASK], toasting bread, thought to herself: "Why did I make a hysterical fool of myself? That was a mistake. Keep calm, my girl, keep calm." After all, she'd always prided herself on her levelheadedness!
<name>I</name>	I	Nerves	[MASK] all to pieces—hands shaking. I killed her all right. Poor devil—elderly woman—simple job if I'd been sober. Lucky for me there's loyalty in our profession. The Sister knew, of course—but she held her tongue.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Blore	Just shut up like a clam. I could take it or leave it—those were his words. I was hard up. I took it." [MASK] looked unconvinced. He said: "Why didn't you tell us all this last night?"
<name>Blore</name>	Blore	Armstrong	I L/ombard said slowly: "So we've been wrong—wrong all along! Built up a nightmare of superstition and fantasy all because of the coincidence of two deaths!" [MASK] said gravely: "And yet, you know, the argument holds.
<name>Owen</name>	Owen	Owen	"That I'm U.N. [MASK]? Think what you damned well please. But I'll ask you, if that's so, why I didn't pot you with the revolver last night? I could have, about twenty times over."
<name>Wargrave</name>	Wargrave	Morris	I think it was the fact that they were all so normal and so quiet that made him override [MASK]'s orders and take out a boat to the island after he'd heard about the SOS signals." "When did he and the other men go?"
<name>Poirot</name>	Poirot	Blore	What about the revolver? That was the disturbing factor—the revolver!) [MASK] sat on his bed, his brow furrowed, his little eyes creased and puckered while he pondered the problem of the revolver_ In the silence he could hear the clocks strike downstairs.
<name>Haydock</name>	Haydock	Anthony	Whole thing's like a detective story. Positively thrilling." The judge said acidly: "At my time of life, I have no desire for 'thrills' as you call them." [MASK] said with a grin: "The legal life's narrowing!
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Wargrave	[MASK] said: "Have you got that letter?" "The letter engaging us? No, sir. I didn't keep it." "Go on with your story. You were engaged, as you say, by letter." "Yes, sir.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Blore	He stepped out into the corridor. There was a faint sound in the hall below. [MASK] ran noiselessly in his stockinged feet to the head of the stairs. At that moment he realized why it was he had heard all these sounds so clearly.
<name>Poirot</name>	Poirot	Landor	Not on the island. No, much longer ago than that. Funny that he couldn't put a name to it... Silly sort of face really—fellow looked a bit of a mug. Of course! It came to him with a real shock. [MASK]!
<name>Roger</name>	Roger	Lombard	[MASK] stood there. He held a candle in his left hand. He had pulled on his trousers over his pyjamas. His right hand rested in the pocket of his pyjama jacket. He said sharply: "What the hell's all this?"
<name>Sheppard</name>	Sheppard	Vera	He said: "That's conscience ..." After a moment's silence he said very quietly: "So you did drown that kid after all?" [MASK] said vehemently: "I didn't! I didn't! You've no right to say that!"
<name>Mask</name>	Mask	Matthews	He had not got excited or over-vehement. The jury had been impressed. It had seemed to [MASK], perhaps, as though everything had been over bar the shouting. The judge wound up his watch carefully and placed it by the bed.
<name>James</name>	James	Lombard	The judge murmured with a reptilian smile: "We must be very careful...." They went back again to the drawing room. Although it was summer the room was dark. [MASK] switched on the lights but they did not come on. He said: "Of course!
<name>Macarthur</name>	Macarthur	Rogers	The judge interposed. He spoke with the authority that a lifetime in the courts had given him. He said: "That is exactly what we must go into very carefully. I should suggest that you get your wife to bed first of all, [MASK].
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Blore	Who's afraid of the big bad wolf ? /'ll be dangerous when I get hold of him!" He paused and said: "We'd better rope in [MASK] to help us. He'll be a good man in a pinch. Better not tell the women.
<name>Poirot</name>	Poirot	Armstrong	He said: "It's those little figures, sir. In the middle of the table. The little china figures. Ten of them, there were. I'll swear to that, ten of them." [MASK] said: "Yes, ten.
<name>Close</name>	Close	Clees	"The name meant nothing to me when it was spoken. What was it—[MASK]? Close? I really can't remember having a patient of that name, or being connected with a death in any way. The thing's a complete mystery to me.
<name>Rogers</name>	Rogers	Lombard	And then they'll come to take us off. Long before this evening." [MASK] said: "The weather's cleared all right, but the sea hasn't gone down yet. Terrific swell on! They won't be able to get a boat near the island before tomorrow."
<name>Hastings</name>	Hastings	Vera	And the man dropped the coffee tray, remember. Then the way he spoke about it—it didn't ring true. Oh, yes. I'm afraid they did it." [MASK] said: "The way she looked—scared of her own shadow!
<name>Vera</name>	Vera	Vera	How many are there? Ten?" "Yes—ten there are." [MASK] cried: "What fun! They're the ten little soldier boys of the nursery rhyme, I suppose. In my bedroom the rhyme is framed and hung up over the mantelpiece."
<name>Verloc</name>	Verloc	Blore	"He of course was one of our lot." The other man stirred. "[MASK]," said the Assistant Commissioner forcibly, "was a bad hat!" "You think so, sir?" The AC said: "I always thought so.
<name>Hardy</name>	Hardy	Lombard	I've asked myself the same question. Motorboat ought to have been here nigh on two hours ago. It hasn't come? Why?" "Found the answer?" asked [MASK]. "It's not an accident—that's what I say.
<name>Jennings</name>	Jennings	Rogers	The judge said dryly: "That is probably true. But I think you'd better explain, [MASK]." The butler wiped his face with a handkerchief. He said earnestly: "I was just obeying orders, sir, that's all."
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Lombard	Which way— which method—talk her over—lull her into security or a swift dash— All his life [MASK] had taken the risky way. He took it now. He spoke slowly, argumentatively: "Now look here, my dear girl, you just listen—"
<name>Travers</name>	Travers	Wargrave	There was no doubt now who was in charge of the situation. This morning [MASK] had sat huddled in his chair on the terrace refraining from any overt activity. Now he assumed command with the ease born of a long habit of authority. He definitely presided over the court.
<name>Poirot</name>	Poirot	Vera	But where the devil did he hide himself? We went over the place with a fine-tooth comb." [MASK] said urgently: "If you didn't find him last night, you won't find him now ... That's common sense."
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Rogers	He wrapped himself in his dressing gown and followed [MASK]. He bent over the bed where the woman was lying peacefully on her side. He lifted the cold hand, raised the eyelid. It was some few minutes before he straightened himself and turned from the bed.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Cyril	"I hadn't built on it, of course. But it was a bit of a knock. Oh well, luck's luck! [MASK]'s a nice kid. I'm awfully fond of him.” And he was fond of him, too.
<name>Mildred</name>	Mildred	Queer	"I can't ask you to marry me. I’ve not got a penny. It’s all I can do to keep myself. [MASK], you know, once, for three months 1 had the chance of being a rich man to look forward to.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Armstrong	[MASK] replied: "I have a small medicine case here. You can examine it. You will find some sleeping stuff—trional and sulphonal tablets—a packet of bromide, bicarbonate of soda, aspirin. Nothing else. I have no cyanide in my possession."
<name>Marsh</name>	Marsh	Armstrong	And by now the thoughts that ran through their brains were abnormal, feverish, diseased.... "It's [MASK]... I saw him looking at me sideways just then ... his eyes are mad ... quite mad ... Perhaps he isn't a doctor at all...
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Blore	Along the terrace, then down the slope towards the sea— obliquely—to the end of the island where loose rocks went out into the water. He walked a little unsteadily, like a man who was only half awake. [MASK] said: "There goes another one who's barmy!
<name>Poirot</name>	Poirot	Lombard	[MASK] said: "Quite right. If I were to commit one or more murders it would be solely for what I could get out of them. This mass clearance isn't my line of country. Good, then we'll eliminate ourselves and concentrate on our five fellow prisoners.
<name>Poirot</name>	Poirot	Blore	"You won't agree to that?" "No, I won't. That revolver's mine. I need it to defend myself—and I'm going to keep it." [MASK] said: "In that case we're bound to come to one conclusion."
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Blore	That dinner—last night—" They turned in to the first bedroom. Five minutes later they faced each other on the landing. No one hiding—no possible hiding place. [MASK] said: "There's a little stair here."
<name>Roger</name>	Roger	Anthony	[MASK] was a creature of sensation—and of action. He thought to himself: "Must go through with it, I suppose," and thereafter dismissed everything from his mind. Warm steaming water—tired limbs—presently a shave—a cocktail—dinner.
<name>John</name>	John	Rogers	Though I doubt if his evidence will add anything to our sum of knowledge." [MASK], summoned before the court, had very little to tell. He had been busy all the morning about household duties and with the preparation of lunch.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Rogers	But there was no sign of sleeping draughts or tablets. [MASK] said: "She didn't have nothing last night, sir, except what you gave her...." II When the gong sounded for breakfast at nine o'clock it found everyone up and awaiting the summons.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Rogers	The small cold voice went on: "Your indignation is very natural. Nevertheless you must admit that the facts have got to be faced. Either you or [MASK] could have administered a fatal dose with the greatest ease. Let us now consider the position of the other people present.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Vera	And in imagination she saw the judge's old hands put the black cap on his head and begin to pronounce sentence.... After a while [MASK] strolled slowly down to the sea. She walked along towards the extreme end of the island where an old man sat staring out to the horizon.
<name>James</name>	James	Rogers	The storm increased. The wind howled against the side of the house. Everyone was in the living room. They sat listlessly huddled together. And, surreptitiously, they watched each other. When [MASK] brought in the tea tray, they all jumped. He said:
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Blore	"I may have an idea," said [MASK] slowly. "But that's a long way from being sure. I may be wrong. All I can say is that if I'm right the person in question is a very cool customer—a very cool customer indeed."
<name>Inspector</name>	Inspector	Rogers	With a slightly rheumatic grunt, he climbed into bed and turned out the electric light. IV Downstairs in the dining room, [MASK] stood puzzled. He was staring at the china figures in the centre of the table. He muttered to himself: "That's a rum go!
<name>Weyrother</name>	Weyrother	SOS	Some bright lad wandering on the cliff will recognize [MASK] when he sees it, I hope. In the evening we could try a bonfire—only there isn't much wood—and anyway they might just think it was song and dance and merriment."
<name>Armstrong</name>	Armstrong	Blore	He said: must insist that no one disturbs mW [MASK] said genially: "We won't disturb you. We're just making a tour of the island so to speak. Just wondered, you know, if someone might be hiding on it."
<name>Geoffrey</name>	Geoffrey	Hugo	"I think perhaps 1 will." The decorous stroll down to the beach. The moonlight—the soft Atlantic air. And then, [MASK]'s arms round her. "I love you. 1 love you.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Vera	Come on, let's scramble along here." They scrambled over the rocks. [MASK] stopped suddenly. She said: "It's not clothes—it's a man... The man was wedged between two rocks, flung there by the tide earlier in the day.
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Leslie	I don't know if [MASK] ever guessed ... I don't think so. But, you see, I didn't know about her anymore. She'd gone far away where I couldn't reach her. And then she died—and I was alone...."
<name>James</name>	James	Rogers	Doctor's just been telling us." [MASK] inclined his head. "Yes, sir. Thank you, sir." He took up the empty bacon dish and went out. Again there was a silence. Ill
<name>Judy</name>	Judy	Vera	The hall was dim in the dying light. [MASK], the little soldier clasped in her hand, began to mount the stairs. Slowly, because her legs were suddenly very tired. "One little soldier boy left all alone." How did it end?
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Rogers	[MASK] said: "I was to put a record on the gramophone. I'd find the record in the drawer and my wife was to start the gramophone when I'd gone into the drawing room with the coffee tray." The judge murmured: "A very remarkable story."
<name>Stevenson</name>	Stevenson	Richmond	Only a miracle could have brought him through unhurt. That miracle didn't happen. Yes, he'd sent [MASK] to his death and he wasn't sorry. It had been easy enough. Mistakes were being made all the time, officers being sent to death needlessly.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Blore	We will now place the drugs in a safe place. There is, I think, a silver chest, is there not, in the pantry?" [MASK] said: "That's all very well, but who's to have the key?
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Blore	There was faint moonlight coming in through the landing window and it illuminated the hall below. [MASK] had an instantaneous glimpse of a figure just passing out through the front door. In the act of running down the stairs in pursuit, he paused.
<name>Owen</name>	Owen	Owen	If I were to commit one or more murders it would be solely for what I could get out of them. This mass clearance isn't my line of country. Good, then we'll eliminate ourselves and concentrate on our five fellow prisoners. Which of them is U. N. [MASK].
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Vera	And if any one comes up toward us, I shall shoot!" He paused: "You'll be cold, perhaps, in that thin dress?" [MASK] said with a raucous laugh: "Cold? I should be colder if I were dead!"
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Blore	"We—we shouldn't just sit here doing nothing! There must be something—surely, surely there is something that we can do? If we lit a bonfire—?" [MASK] said heavily: "In this weather?" The rain was pouring down again.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Blore	But to open his door would be the action of a fool. Very likely that was exactly what the other was waiting for. He might even have meant [MASK] to hear what he had heard, counting on him coming out to investigate.
<name>John</name>	John	Blore	They passed his door without hesitating or faltering. And as they did so, [MASK] made up his mind. He meant to see who it was! The footsteps had definitely passed his door going to the stairs. Where was the man going?
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Rogers	You can't kill anybody with an oilsilk curtain. Forget about it." [MASK] said: "Yes, sir, thank you, sir." He went out shutting the door behind him. Inside the room, the pall of fear had fallen anew.
<name>Vera</name>	Vera	Rogers	The suggestion was a wise one—yet every one hesitated. It was as though they clung to each other's company for reassurance. The judge said: "Yes, we must get some sleep." [MASK] said: "I haven't cleared yet—in the dining room."
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Seton	I remember [MASK] perfectly well. He came up before me for trial in June of the year 1930. He was charged with the murder of an elderly woman. He was very ably defended and made a good impression on the jury in the witness-box.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Vera	[MASK] said to herself: "Don't be a fool. You're so tired that you're imagining the most fantastic things...." Slowly up the stairs_ At the top of them something fell from her hand making hardly any noise on the soft pile carpet.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Vera	He said: "The other two deaths have resulted from the administration of drugs. That, no one will dispute, is easily compassed by a person of the smallest physical strength." [MASK] cried angrily: "I think you're mad!"
<name>Blore</name>	Blore	Lombard	[MASK] said: "It's true, my dear." He paused and then said: "There's one other little fact. A pane in the dining room window has been smashed—and there are only three little soldier boys on the table." Fifteen
<name>Poirot</name>	Poirot	Armstrong	Not been to a doctor for years—neither of us." "You'd no reason to believe she suffered from heart trouble?" "No, doctor. I never knew of anything." [MASK] said: "Did she sleep well?"
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Armitage	All owing to that damned rumour! By God, it was pretty hard—nearly thirty years ago now! [MASK] had talked, he supposed. Damned young pup! What did he know about it? Oh, well, no good brooding about these things!
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Blore	Now then— quiet as you can." They crept stealthily upstairs. On the little landing outside the door of the bedroom they paused again. Yes, someone was in the room. There was a faint creak from within. [MASK] whispered: "Now."
<name>John</name>	John	Armstrong	I'll have some water." [MASK] supported her as she struggled to her feet. She went over to the basin, swaying and clutch- ing at him for support. She let the cold tap run and then filled the glass.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Blore	He went on: "I've got that revolver!" He took it half out of his pocket as he spoke. "Found it put back in my drawer tonight." [MASK] stopped dead on the doorstep. His face changed.
<name>Challoner</name>	Challoner	Armstrong	Suits your book—eh?" Again [MASK]'s face darkened with anger. But again that passionless cold little voice stopped the words on his lips. "No good result can come from recrimination. Facts are what we have to deal with.
<name>Hastings</name>	Hastings	Armstrong	[MASK] said doubtfully: "I shouldn't have said so. Not for a minute. But, of course. I'm not a specialist in mental diseases. I haven't really had any conversation with him—I haven't studied him from that point of view."
<name>Travers</name>	Travers	Blore	Why, I could shoot you both this very minute if I liked." [MASK] said: "Yes, but that wouldn't be according to plan. It's one at a time, and it's got to be done in a certain way."
<name>She</name>	She	Lombard	He said in a low anxious voice: "I hope lunch will be satisfactory. There is cold ham and cold tongue, and I've boiled some potatoes. And there's cheese and biscuits, and some tinned fruits." [MASK] said: "Sounds all right.
<name>Hardy</name>	Hardy	Blore	There's only one place where there could be a recess—just a little to the right below here. If you fellows can get hold of a rope, you can let me down to make sure." [MASK] said: "Might as well be sure.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Cyril	Well, what of it? One must take some risk! If the worst happened she'd brazen it out. "How can you tell such a wicked lie, [MASK]? Of course, I never said any such thing!" They'd believe her all right.
<name>Dan</name>	Dan	Armstrong	"They're both all right." d said: _______|an—he must have put the stuff in his glass himself?'’ [MASK] nodded with a curiously dissatisfied expression. He said: "Seems like it."
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Seton	Evidence turned up later, after he was hanged, which proved that beyond any shadow of doubt. But there was a good deal of comment at the time—nine people out of ten thought [MASK] was innocent and that the judge's summing up had been vindictive.
<name>Chicot</name>	Chicot	Blore	"My good blockhead, I swear to you that it was put back in my drawer. Greatest surprise I ever had in my life when I found it there." [MASK] said: "You ask us to believe a thing like that!
<name>Providence</name>	Providence	Providence	I do not!" The judge stroked his chin. He murmured in a slightly ironic voice: "My dear lady, in my experience of ill-doing. [MASK] leaves the work of conviction and chastisement to us mortals—and the process is often fraught with difficulties.
<name>Poirot</name>	Poirot	Blore	Our murderer has had plenty of time to devise a hiding place. I do not fancy we shall find that revolver easily." [MASK] said forcefully: "I don't know where the revolver is, but I'll bet I know where something else is—that hypodermic syringe.
<name>Poirot</name>	Poirot	Philip	He's the only person here with medical knowledge. He can swear the body's been dead at least an hour and who's to contradict him?" [MASK] looked at her thoughtfully. "You know," he said, "that's a clever idea of yours.
<name>John</name>	John	Blore	No, it wouldn't be heard." He paused. "But that trick's not going to work again. He'll have to try something else next." [MASK] said: "He probably will." There was an unpleasant tone in his voice.
<name>Heyst</name>	Heyst	Lombard	And a madman has all the advantages on his side. He's twice as cunning as any one sane can be." [MASK] put back the revolver in his pocket. He said: "Come on, then."
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Maine	[MASK] coughed. He said: "Well, it's not quite like that, sir. We do know why, more or less. Some fanatic with a bee in his bonnet about justice. He was out to get people who were beyond the reach of the law.
<name>He</name>	He	Lombard	She said, her breath coming with a slight catch in it: "One feels safer here, out in the open... Don't let's go back into the house again." [MASK] said: "Not a bad idea.
<name>Millicent</name>	Millicent	Vera	Her feet moved noiselessly over the ground. She drifted from the room like a shadow. [MASK] went over to the window and sat down on the window seat. She was faintly disturbed. Every- thing—somehow—was a little queer.
<name>Wainwright</name>	Wainwright	Seton	It was almost as though he had a private down on the fellow." All these memories rushed through the doctor's mind. Before he could consider the wisdom of the question he had asked impulsively: "Did you know [MASK] at all?
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Blore	[MASK] whispered back: "Of course! Best hidingplace he could have chosen! Nobody likely to go there. Now then— quiet as you can." They crept stealthily upstairs. On the little landing outside the door of the bedroom they paused again.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Rogers	[MASK] went round with the coffee tray. The coffee was good—really black and very hot. The whole party had dined well. They were satisfied with themselves and with life. The hands of the clock pointed to twenty minutes past nine.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Vera	He nodded his head gently. "Yes," he said. "It's pleasant. It's a good place, I think, to wait." "To wait?" said [MASK] sharply. "What are you waiting for?" He said gently:
<name>Lombard</name>	Lombard	Blore	"What?" "Your lack of imagination is going to make you absolutely a sitting target. A criminal of the imagination of U. N. Owen can make rings round you any time he—or she—wants to." [MASK]'s face went crimson.
