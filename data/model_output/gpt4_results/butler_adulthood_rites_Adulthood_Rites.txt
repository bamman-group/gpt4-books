<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Gabe	“Before now, I didn’t want to. But now... Can you get help for me?" "No!” [MASK] protested. “You don’t need help. You’ll be okay!" "I’ll be dead!”
<name>Oyeronke</name>	Oyeronke	Ahajas	My body was waiting for the new sibling.” She frowned at him. “I don’t understand.” “[MASK] let me touch it, let me be one of its presences. She let me recognize it and know it as a sibling still forming.
<name>California</name>	California	Lo	“We loved him here. He was the son most of us never had. I knew he was going, though. What was there for him in a place like this? I gave him a packet of food to take with him and aimed him toward [MASK].
<name>Chicago</name>	Chicago	Phoenix	He could see guns and people through the windows, although it seemed the people were trying not to be seen. A few people working or loitering in the street stared at him. At least two were too drunk to notice him. Hidden guns and open drunkenness. [MASK] was dying.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Akin	The man who had caught him still held him, had once dangled him by his feet and threatened to dunk him in the river if he did not be quiet. Only the intervention of the other men had stopped him from doing this. [MASK] was terrified of him.
<name>Arvid</name>	Arvid	Akin	Now [MASK] learned for the first time what the people had decided. He felt now what he had not been able to feel before. That the people saw him as something they had helped to make. He was intended to decide the fate of the resisters.
<name>Timber</name>	Timber	Alan	He could not avoid it all and still move quickly. He splashed through a small stream, then scrambled up a steep bank. He came to a bundle of small logs and saw where a tree had been cut. The scent of [MASK] and of strange Human males was there.
<name>But</name>	But	Tino	On the other hand, that means he’s had to fight a few times. Some guys think if he’s small, he's weak, and if he’s weak, he’s fair game.” “[MASK], he is too valuable for this.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Tate	“I’m all right now.” “What made you sick?” He stared at her with quiet dislike, wondering what it might be safe to say. [MASK] spoke up with uncharacteristic softness. “He had a dream that upset him.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Tate	It hurt him more than he had ever been hurt, and he could not help passing some of his pain on to [MASK]. Yet he managed not to poison her. He did not know when she began to scream. He continued automatically to hold her.
<name>She</name>	She	6	She had not laughed, though she was smiling. “You people are not nice," she said, keeping her smile. “You should be ashamed. Go home now, all of you. Have interesting dreams." [MASK] watched in confusion as people began to leave.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Akin	[MASK] went to the door and spat outside several times, spat away pure pain as his body fought to deal with what he had carelessly taken in. By the time he was able to talk and tell what was wrong, he had everyone’s attention.
<name>Lilith</name>	Lilith	Eka	“Even at your stage of growth, [MASK], you can perceive molecules. We perceive subatomic particles. Making and breaking this contact is no more difficult for us than clasping and releasing hands is for Humans.” “Is that because you’re ooloi?"
<name>Thorn</name>	Thorn	Tate	Yet he went to [MASK] and asked her to carry him for a while so that he could talk to her. She picked him up at once and took him to the small, fost-running stream where the camp had gotten its water.
<name>Valentine</name>	Valentine	Akin	As [MASK]’s sibling would have been able to help him. He withdrew from them, reminded by their unity of his own solitude. He could talk to them, communicate with them nonvocally, but he could never have the special closeness with them that they had with each other.
<name>Doro</name>	Doro	Akin	A thing beyond trade. Life could be changed, changed utterly. But not destroyed. Hie Human species could cease to exist independently, blending itself into the Oankali. [MASK], it said, was still learning this.
<name>John</name>	John	Akin	“But foot-powered spinning wheels, sewing machines, and looms are enough. We already make more than we need, and people need to do some things at their own pace with their own designs." [MASK] thought about this and decided he understood it.
<name>Resister</name>	Resister	Tino	“There aren’t any of us where he comes from.” “Resister?" the child asked. “Yes. But I don't think he means any harm. He didn’t try to hurt us.” “What does the kid want?" [MASK] asked.
<name>Callum</name>	Callum	Gabe	I call myths that in my mind. I didn’t mean to say it out loud." [MASK] looked down at him. "If you’re always going to be small, you ought to learn to be careful with that word,” he said.
<name>Lecky</name>	Lecky	Yori	You should study them. You came along to guard their health. Doesn’t that mean you should spend time with them, get to know more about them?” "That won’t help,” [MASK] said. “I already know they’re venomous.
<name>Chell</name>	Chell	Aldn	“So that's what the raider meant about that tongue of yours.” She lifted him and put him on a counter so that she could talk to him without bending or stooping. “What’s your name?” “[MASK].”
<name>Emilio</name>	Emilio	Nikanj	Without [MASK], she would not have been as desirable. He did not understand this, but he accepted it. They would have to show him what was to happen. He would not ask. They had made it clear they wanted something from him.
<name>Waldo</name>	Waldo	Akin	“You can walk,” the man muttered. [MASK] sat still where he had landed, wondering whether Human babies had been thrown about this way—and if so, how they had survived? Then he followed the men as quickly as he could.
<name>Leckie</name>	Leckie	Tlno	“Yes.” “It doesn’t involve coercion.” “We have something you need. You have something we need.” “We didn’t need anything before you got here!" “You were dying.” [MASK] said nothing for a moment.
<name>Ransom</name>	Ransom	Akin	These were not deadly, but adult Humans found their sting agonizing and debilitating. [MASK] was gathering his courage to taste one, to explore the basic structure of it, when the men arrived, snatched him up, and stumbled and slipped down the path to the river.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Lilith	“How is it your mother was allowed to have a boy?" The man took a final step toward [MASK] and was abruptly too close. He stood very straight and tried to intimidate her with his stiff, angry posture and his staring eyes.
<name>Lilith</name>	Lilith	Alan	His sight told him it was large and caterpillarlike, covered with smooth plates that made a pattern of bright and dark as body heat escaped between the plates rather than through them. From what [MASK] had heard, this ooloi could seal itself within its shell and lose little or no air or body heat.
<name>Nemesis</name>	Nemesis	Nikanj	He would not see [MASK] for a year. Perhaps longer. She came towering over him, then folded herself into a sitting position opposite him the way some Humans used to stoop or kneel to talk to him when he was younger. Now his head and hers were at the same level.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Tino	Are they the reason for his wandering?” [MASK] looked startled, then angry. “If you knew, why did you ask?” “I didn’t know. I guessed. He must stop!” “No."
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Akin	“I know.” “You’ll let it be corrected, then?” “Yes.” The word was hardly more than a moving of her lips, but [MASK] saw it and believed her. Believed and surprisingly tired, he drifted off to sleep.
<name>Offred</name>	Offred	Ahajas	Her child had to make its own way out of her body. This did not hurt [MASK], but it weakened her momentarily, made her want to sit down, made her focus her whole attention on following the child's progress, helping it if it seemed in distress.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Akin	“You are not as much a child as you want to be.” “I don’t know what I’ll be,” it said. "What do you feel about the resisters?” "They took [MASK]. They hurt him, and they hurt me.
<name>Nikoj</name>	Nikoj	Akin	“Ti?” [MASK] raised his head to look over the ooloi’s body. “I didn’t... I don’t feel you.” It gave him a Human smile. "I feel you, but no more than I do anyone else I’m near.”
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Akin	“Son of a bitch!” Ihte whispered. "Listen, [MASK], don’t say that name to anyone else. It may not matter anymore, but don’t say it.” “Why?” “Because there are people here who don’t like your mother.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Akin	[MASK], who had considered lying, was glad he had not. He had always found it easy to tell the truth and difficult to make himself lie. He could lie very convincingly, though, if lying would keep him alive and spare him pain among these men.
<name>Valentine</name>	Valentine	Yori	The truth or nothing. The truth. “[MASK], Human purpose isn’t what you say it is or what I say it is. It’s what your biology says it is—what your genes say it is.” "Do you believe that?”
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Lilith	I never had a chance to run off and pine for the good old days!" The man said nothing. If he stayed long, he would learn that [MASK] had these flares of bitterness sometimes. They never seemed to affect her behavior, though often they frightened people.
<name>Severian</name>	Severian	Rinaldi	“That’s what the worms hunting for you said,” [MASK] agreed. He was frowning again. "Can you read?” “Yes.” “How can you have had time to learn to read?"
<name>Yarrok</name>	Yarrok	Dichaan	[MASK] rustled his free tentacles in discomfort. “There was a consensus,” he said. “Everyone came to believe it was the right thing to do except us. We’ve never been alone that way before. Others were surprised that we didn’t accept the general will, but they were wrong.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Alan	The pseudocorridor was low and narrow—just large enough for the three of them to walk through, single file. It closed behind them. [MASK], following last, could see the walls sphinctering together just a few steps behind him. Hie movement fascinated him.
<name>innocent</name>	innocent	eka	It was his sibling, as tormented by the situation as he was. And it was a child. Even more a child than he was—younger and truly [MASK]. “All right,” he said unhappily.
<name>Laurel</name>	Laurel	Lilith	My father didn’t believe something could be poison raw but okay to eat cooked.” [MASK] shook her head. “I was a city person, too, but there were some things I was willing not to learn from experience.” She returned to her original subject.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Dichaan	[MASK] linked with his nervous system and kept his heart beating. Hie man was a beautiful, terrible physical contradiction, as all Humans were. He was a walking seduction, and he would never understand why. He could not be lost.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Akin	Why was she always so hard to hide things from? Why did he hesitate so to lie to her? “Good god,” she said, and started to get up. “Wait!” [MASK] said. “They were going to cut them this morning.
<name>Valentine</name>	Valentine	Nikanj	And he probably doesn’t feel like one. And whether he’s fertile or not, he’s damned interested in girls. And they don’t seem to mind." “[MASK] said he would go through a phase of quasi-Human sexuality.”
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Tino	Are there so many Humans left? Are our numbers increasing so fast?” "You’ve joined the traitors!” the man said. "To have a family,” [MASK] said softly. “To have children.”
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Iriarte	“A kiss from him could be the same as a ldss from a bushmaster.” “That man had three children before the war,” [MASK] whispered. “He liked you. You shouldn't have frightened him.”
<name>did</name>	did	P	But the hand she held out to him now had only five long, slender, gray fingers. He stared at her, then carefully took the offered hand and examined it. There was no wound, no scars. “How... [MASK]" he asked.
<name>Mara</name>	Mara	Rudra	They were tired and angry. They had brought back [MASK]’s body to be buried with her husband. Two more people lost. The men cursed all raiders and tried to figure out where this group had come from. Where should the reprisal raid take place?
<name>Corra</name>	Corra	Macy	“These days, I have no sense of humor at all where you’re concerned.” She looked at [MASK]. “She was still pushing to have the girls’ tentacles amputated. She's been talking to the salvagers about it.”
<name>Genly</name>	Genly	Dichaan	“It is alone, too," [MASK] had answered. “You and it both need to learn more about what you are.” “I know what I am.” “Yes. You are my same-sex child, near his metamorphosis.”
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Lilith	"He’s quicker than most of my girls,” [MASK] commented as she held him against her and let him drink. It could have been difficult to learn from her smooth, unhelpful skin except that it was as familiar to him as his own—and superficially like his own.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Tilden	"His name was [MASK]. He had a sickness that made him bleed and hurt and hate everyone. The other men called it an ulcer. One day, he threw up too much blood, and he died. I think the others buried him.
<name>Alanna</name>	Alanna	Tino	[MASK] glanced at her and saw that she was smiling—a sad smile that became her somehow. For a moment, she was beautiful. He did not know what he wanted from the ooloi—if he wanted anything. But he knew what he wanted from the woman.
<name>Corrie</name>	Corrie	Alan	"If they don’t speak English there,” she said, “nobody we know would be there.” He nodded. “Talk to them, [MASK]. Find out when they were taken and where their village is—if they know.
<name>Genly</name>	Genly	Nikanj	“But...” [MASK] hesitated. "But if we had to work that blindly, that clumsily, we couldn’t have trade. We would have to take your children from you soon after they were bom. We wouldn’t dare trust you to raise them.
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Akin	They ate dry food—nuts, seeds, and dry fruit mixed together, and they drank something that was not water. They gave [MASK] a little of the drink and were amused to see that once he had tasted it, he would not take it again.
<name>Valentine</name>	Valentine	Lilith	He collected words and gradually assembled them into questions. When his questions were answered, he remembered everything he was told. His picture of the world grew. “At least he isn’t any stronger or faster in physical development than other babies,” [MASK] said.
<name>Thistle</name>	Thistle	Akin	Being stroked across the back was very much like being rubbed across eyes that could not protect themselves by closing. Yet the man meant to be kind. [MASK] looked at the man curiously. He had the shortest, brightest hair and beard of the group.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Gabe	"We’re all you’ve got, though, lad. It shouldn’t be that way, but it is.” She stood up with him, holding him tighter than necessary, and turned to see [MASK] coming toward them. "What’s going on?” he asked.
<name>He</name>	He	Ayre	Everyone knew. It repelled him and yet drew him in such an incomprehensible, uncomfortable way that he did not like to be near it at all. And it felt the same things he did. It should have been glad to see him go away. [MASK] shuddered.
<name>Lilith</name>	Lilith	Tiikuchahk	The ooloi smoothed its body tentacles and folded itself onto a platform. “I didn't know constructs talked about hell.” “We say what we’ve grown up hearing, ’ll, what does its scent do to you?” “I like it,” [MASK] said.
<name>Weyrwoman</name>	Weyrwoman	Nikanj	It would be given small portions of what everyone else ate. And once it had shown to [MASK]’s satisfaction that it was not likely to poison itself, it would have the freedom to eat whatever it found edible—to graze, as the Humans said.
<name>Arha</name>	Arha	Sadness	Others were surprised that we didn’t accept the general will, but they were wrong. They were wrong to even want to risk you!” “My sibling?" Silence. [MASK]. “It remembers you as something there then not there.
<name>Roderick</name>	Roderick	Alan	let he did not. His body coiled into a painfully tight fetal knot and lay vulnerable and more completely unconscious than it had ever been. w V when [MASK] became able to perceive the world around him again he discovered that he could not move or speak.
<name>Annemarie</name>	Annemarie	Akin	I hope those fools haven’t made you sick. What do we know about taking care of a sick kid—or for that matter, a well one.” He was only muttering to himself, but he was at least not blaming [MASK] for what had happened.
<name>Rashek</name>	Rashek	Alan	If an attacker was persistent enough, [MASK] could be killed. And at this moment, he was alone. No companion. No guardian. He began trying to move again—trying desperately. But only his new sensory tentacles moved. They writhed and knotted helplessly.
<name>her</name>	her	Alan	Hell, they don’t look any older than I do now. They could still join a... one of your villages and have more kids. They won’t though.” “And you?” “I don’t know.” He looked at [MASK].
<name>Alvin</name>	Alvin	Dichaan	Humans called this an oxbow lake—one that had originally been part of the river. [MASK] had kept the Lo entity from engulfing it so far because the entity would have killed the plant life in it and that would have eventually killed the animal life.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Nikanj	He reached out to her, touched the large breasts. He could not help himself. He had wanted to touch them since he had first seen them. She lay down on her side, drawing him down facing her. It occurred to him a moment later that [MASK] was behind him.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Lilith	There was no sound of his following. Then there was a burst of sound—hurrying feet, heavy breathing. “Wait!” the man called. [MASK] stopped and waited for him to catch up. He was.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Akin	“Wait, let me look.” She seemed pleased to do this. “Those are volcanic," she said. “Do you know what that means?” “A broken place in the Earth where hot liquid rock comes up,” [MASK] said.
<name>Stebbins</name>	Stebbins	Galt	It’s looks that are important. But you know as well as I do that he isn’t Human, and it’s got to come out somehow.” “He claims to be poison,” [MASK] said. “He may be.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Anne	“Why not me! I had two children before the war. I know how to bring them up.” “We also had two,” [MASK] said. “TWo little girls.” She gave a low laugh.
<name>Yonez</name>	Yonez	Dichaan	When [MASK] touched his head tentacles to what appeared to be the bark of one of them, it opened as walls opened at home, and inside was a familiar room, empty of resister-style furniture but containing several platforms grown for sitting or for holding containers of food.
<name>Nikoj</name>	Nikoj	Kahguyaht	“She was so big... I thought she was male. Then [MASK], our ooloi, told me Oankali females are like that. 'Plenty of room inside for children,’ it said. 'And plenty of strength to protect the children, born and unborn.’
<name>She</name>	She	Alan	This way.” She walked away down the path to the village, not waiting to see whether the man would follow. It seemed for a while that the man would stay behind. The narrow path curved around a huge tree, and [MASK] lost sight of him.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Yori	"They’re so young. And if they get sick...” "[MASK] will care for them if they get sick. She’ll care for them, even if she doesn't like what we’ve done. And it will be done, as it should be."
<name>Francis</name>	Francis	Akin	These men not only frightened him, they made him agonizingly lonely. Sometime after dark, [MASK] awoke to find someone holding him and someone else trying to put something in his mouth. He knew at once that the men had all had too much of their alcoholic drink.
<name>Ransom</name>	Ransom	Akin	[MASK] looked around at the land and saw that the banks were high and badly eroded—cliffs with vegetation spilling over the edges. He had never seen such things. He was farther from home than he had ever been, and still traveling.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Alan	She could feel the deep attraction-repulsion between them. She tried to overcome the conflicting emotions with her own calm, with feelings of unity that she recalled with her own paired sibling. [MASK] recognized the feeling. He had noticed it before in others.
<name>Leto</name>	Leto	Akin	Males and females slept through most of their one metamorphosis. They did not eat, drink, urinate, or defecate. The women stirred [MASK], focused his attention, but the smells of food and water did not interest him. He noticed them because they were intermittent.
<name>Emil</name>	Emil	Nikanj	After a while, he got up and went over to it, sat down opposite it. “What is your talent?” he asked. [MASK] did not speak or acknowledge his presence. ‘Talk to me!” he demanded. "I know you hear.”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Galt	“I think it’s okay for us, though. The kid was nervous before, but he’s relaxed now.” “Put him down,” [MASK] said. “Let’s see what he does.” “If he’s not nervous, maybe we ought to be."
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Lilith	He did not look at it, but he imagined he felt its attention on him. "If you decide to leave,” [MASK] said, “I’ll help you.” He could not imagine wanting to leave her. Something cool and rough and hard attached itself to his upper arm.
<name>Marvin</name>	Marvin	Tiikuchahk	He climbed onto the platform and looked at [MASK]. "Will you take part?” he asked it. "Yes,” it said solemnly. "This will be the first time since before I was bom that I’ll be able to take impressions from you without things going wrong.”
<name>María</name>	María	Pilar	He managed to make a sound and know that he had made it. It was nothing more than a hoarse croak, but he had done it deliberately. [MASK] crept toward him, stared at him, "Estd despierto?” she demanded. Was he awake?
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Akin	“It could be fixed again.” “I think he’d cut his own throat before he’d let one of those things touch him again. I know I would.” [MASK] looked at the man, tried to understand his new expression of revulsion and hatred.
<name>Alvin</name>	Alvin	Yori	That’s the way Human beings are now. Shoot the men. Steal the women. If you have nothing better to do, go raid your neighbors.” “That bad?” “Worse." He sighed. “Will you help me, [MASK]?”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Eka	He had created it before, but never so deliberately or so perfectly. "They are consumed,” he said quietly. “And it was wrong and unnecessary.” “They live, [MASK]. In you.” “Let them live in themselves!”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Tilden	[MASK] had been the group’s German speaker. His mother, someone said, had been German. The men believed it was necessary to speak German because the majority of the people in the village were German, and they were likely to have the best trade goods.
<name>Joseph</name>	Joseph	Hno	She needed to hate me for a while so that she could stop hating herself. And she needed the children I mixed for her.” [MASK] stared at the ooloi, needing to look at it to remind himself that he was hearing an utterly un-Human creature.
<name>Arctor</name>	Arctor	Gabe	He did not know the man. “Hold on,” [MASK] was saying. “This is my home. You don’t just goddamn walk in when you feel like it!” “What are you hiding in there? We’ve all seen the goddamn leeches before.”
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Akin	But suddenly, gently, it clasped [MASK] to it so that he would not break contact. It broadcast his bewilderment, letting people know they were experiencing the emotions of a construct child—a child too Human to understand their reactions naturally.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Akin	"Plastic gloves?” Surprised, [MASK] thought for a moment. “They might have gloves made of some land of plastic. I haven't seen plastic that soft, but it could exist. But once you understand the plastic it can’t hurt you.”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Akin	She had already shown [MASK] some of her work. She seemed to like him. “No,” she repeated. "But the boy must be taught as any child should be taught. It's wrong to let him always put things into his mouth.
<name>Wendy</name>	Wendy	Akin	“[MASK],” he echoed. “How did you fell? What happened?” “You’re the same,” she said, touching his fece. “I mean, you’re not grown up yet.” “No. But I have kept my promise to you.
<name>Amara</name>	Amara	Trikuchahk	She released his hand and stood up. He followed her back to the village, feeling resentful and manipulated. A f In outdoor feast was arranged for him. The people stopped their activities and came together in the center of the village for him and for [MASK].
<name>telepathy</name>	telepathy	Humans	“I have a talent for [MASK],” it said in its soft voice. ”1 was bred to work with you, taught to work with you, and given one of you as a companion during one of my most formative periods.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Akin	Other people need things like this—pictures and statues from another time, something to remind them what we were. What we are.” “Why did people use it so much if it killed them?” [MASK] asked.
