<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Garnet	One of them, I could not remember which, was supposed to have had a baby. [MASK] was the President. Sometimes he would lead a prayer, beginning in a firm mannerly voice, “Our Heavenly Father—” The early heat of May had disappeared, and cold spring rain washed down the windows.
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	Naomi	[MASK]’s mother had spies everywhere, old childbed cases, deathbed companions, keeping her informed. In her nursing job, going from one house to another, she was able to operate like an underwater vacuum tube, sucking up what nobody else could get at.
<name>Lois</name>	Lois	Naomi	I did, without much idea of what I was getting into. I thought [MASK] would make a face at me from behind the counter. I was going to put on my quavery old-lady voice and say to her, “What is the meaning of this?
<name>creation</name>	creation	Jubilee	One had his tail spread, to show the blind eyes, painted satin. The little kingly, idiotic heads. Glory in the cold spring, a wonder of [MASK]. The noise beginning again did not come from any of them.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bert	I found the bathroom and used it without closing the door, later remembering. On my way back to the room I saw the bubble of red liquid, and a light beyond it, at the end of the corridor. I walked towards it past the door of [MASK]’s room.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Del	The same hand that had written: [MASK] is a bad girl. “Tampering with the mails is a Federal offense,” said my mother, coming in. “I don’t think that is very witty, what he says.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Momma	It went into its cocoon and it stayed in all winter. I forgot about it was there. Then we were all sitting after our dinner on Easter Sunday—Easter Sunday but it was a blizzard out—and [MASK] says, ‘Look!’
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Clive	“I don’t believe in capital punishment at all. But if you are going to have it—yes, for women.” Quick as a bullet [MASK] said, “You believe women should be hung like men?” I laughed hard, unhappily.
<name>Stradlater</name>	Stradlater	Naomi	He wore a plaid cap with fleece-lined earflaps, which I remembered him wearing ever since the sixth grade. I remembered that I used to laugh at him, as everybody else did. I was still sometimes ashamed to be seen with him, by somebody like [MASK].
<name>Boo</name>	Boo	Benny	My father turned on the ten o’clock news, saying, “Well we’ll have to see if old [MASK]’s got picked up!” On the evening of the second day he drove the car into our yard and sat there for a moment, not looking at us.
<name>Rex</name>	Rex	Major	He’d have you poor, paying for all the sheep he killed. Anyway somebody else’d put an end to him, if you didn’t.” My father, appealed to, said that perhaps [MASK] would not chase any more sheep. He was tied up, anyway.
<name>McGinty's</name>	McGinty's	Jubilee	They’d gone to [MASK] in the horse and buggy!” “I got to about five yards of him and I slipped out from behind a treetrunk and—O my saints, didn’t he let out a yell! He yelled and lit for the barn.
<name>Phyllis</name>	Phyllis	Naomi	I wanted to know, troublesomely, but [MASK] opened her pale, bright, protruding eyes at me and repeated, “A joke, she was just a joke!" like someone dispensing, in the face of fumbling heresies, self-evident handsome pieces of dogma.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Thelma	[MASK] filled her rouged and powdered cheeks with air, let it out with a crude sound. Out came a short, round, angry-looking woman wearing running shoes without laces. Her ankles were swollen so that her legs looked perfectly round, like drainpipes.
<name>Who</name>	Who	Sennamenal	I mean her dresser drawers. Hatboxes, suitcases? Went through her closet?” “I looked and looked everywhere,” I said demurely. “She must have got rid of them.” “I guess she isn’t sentimental.” “[MASK]?
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Fern	She was speaking from her new vantage-point. She and all these other girls were firmly set towards marriage; older women who had not married, whether they were perfect old maids or discreet adventuresses, like [MASK], could not expect any sympathy from them.
<name>Blueboy</name>	Blueboy	Major	But I did not think of it. I simply thought, and knew, that praying was not going to stop my father going out and getting in the car and driving out the Flats Road and getting his gun and calling, “[MASK]!
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Fern	In June there was the annual strawberry supper on the lawns behind the United Church. [MASK] went down to sing at it, wearing the flowered chiffon dress my mother had helped her make. It was now very tight at the waist.
<name>Francie</name>	Francie	Garnet	Two girls, about nine and ten years old, were jumping up and down on a set of bedsprings that had been sitting in the yard long enough to whiten the grass. They stopped and stared. [MASK] led me past and did not introduce me to them.
<name>Wolfe</name>	Wolfe	Insufficient	[MASK] respect was being shown all round. “It makes me laugh the way people think they can ask a few questions and get to understand something, without knowing any of the groundwork.” “Laugh then,” I said sourly. “I hope you enjoy yourself.”
<name>David</name>	David	Owen	“Then he wouldn’t know where a sheep was.” “A dog like that can’t live in town. And no guarantee he wouldn’t get back at it anyway.” “Think of him tied up in town, [MASK],” said my mother reproachfully.
<name>Seamus</name>	Seamus	Fern	“Nice to see the good-looking young ladies out this nippy morning.” I shook his hand with difficulty. I had a stolen prayer book under my coat, held in place by my crooked arm. “Couldn’t see where you were in church,” [MASK] said.
<name>Miss Maudie</name>	Miss Maudie	Madeleine	I thought I would knock on the door and ask, in a very polite way, if it was all right for me to read the newspapers on the porch. But before I got to the steps the door opened and [MASK] came out with a stove-lid lifter in her hand.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Ada	Were they all right, we wondered about them, were they light? She told us she had got stuck away out on the Jericho Road. All by herself, stuck on the Jericho Road! Poor [MASK]! But the mud on her, we had to laugh!”
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Del	“Give us a drink.” “[MASK], behave yourself,” said my mother with a mouth full of pins. “All I want is to find out what it tastes like.” “Well I can’t give you a drink for nothing.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Fern	“That’s how he does it to [MASK]. She’s considerably obese.” “Aggh! This book makes me sick.” The male sexual organ in erection, we read, had been known to reach a length of fourteen inches.
<name>Angelo</name>	Angelo	Haines	Afterwards we would go to [MASK]’s Restaurant, preferring it to the Blue Owl where nearly everybody else from the high school went, to play the jukebox and the pinball machines. We drank coffee and smoked menthol cigarettes.
<name>Estelle</name>	Estelle	Fern	“Doesn’t matter what anybody says. You weren’t married. You weren’t engaged. It’s nobody’s business. Your life is your own.” “Want to see my little love letter?” said [MASK], and fluttered it under my nose.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Garnet	They haven’t progressed here much beyond the pioneer stage. Maybe they’re too lazy. Or the land isn’t worth it. Or a combination of both.” Skeletons of a burned-out house and barn. “You like our house?” [MASK] said.
<name>Pegeen</name>	Pegeen	Naomi	My friend [MASK] and I told each other, “Don’t let on you heard,” since we were too proud to cross streets to avoid them. Sometimes we would yell back, “Go and wash out your mouth in the cow trough, clean water’s too good for you!”
<name>Miss</name>	Miss	Naomi	It persisted mostly in unmarried ladies, would have been shameful in a man. So to keep [MASK] quiet, while I looked at books, I would find her something to read that she would never have believed could be in a book at all.
<name>Boo</name>	Boo	Owen	[MASK] and I, going home, would sometimes try to name off the things he had in his house, or just in his kitchen. “Two toasters, one with doors one you lay the toast on.” “Seat out of a car.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Naomi	All fresh from the out-of-doors.” “Give us a drink,” I said, showing off in front of [MASK]. But he laughed and put a hand over his glass. “Not until you tell us where you’ve been.”
<name>Semen</name>	Semen	Seed	She has just come in from being with her lover. She has given herself to her lover. [MASK] runs down her legs. I often felt in the middle of the day as if I would have to close my eyes and drop where I was and go to sleep.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Naomi	“What is this performance?” “A fit, sir,” said [MASK] plaintively. “She’s always having these fits.” Making fun of poor helpless afflicted people. The bad taste, the heartlessness, the joy of it.
<name>Antigone</name>	Antigone	Hungarian	She was [MASK]. She had a magnificent name she would serve up to people sometimes, like a fish on a platter, all its silvery, scaly syllables intact, but it was no use, nobody in Jubilee could pronounce or remember it.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Craig	He had an old black typewriter, with metal rims around the keys and all the long black arms exposed; when he began his slow, loud, halting but authoritative typing they dropped their voices, they made absurd scolding faces at each other for the clatter of a pan. [MASK]’s working!
<name>Mac</name>	Mac	Benny	“Do you think she drinks, [MASK]?” “No she don’t. I never brought a bottle into the house and how is she going to get a bottle by herself and besides I would of smelt it on her.”
<name>Swede</name>	Swede	Grace	“Oh, the hired man Father had, remember, the foreigner, he had the very devil of a temper, excuse my language. What was he, [MASK], now wasn’t he a German?” “He was an Austrian.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Scott	“Yes.” She flopped back. “Well, how did you like it?” She sounded suspicious. “Fine.” “It gets better as it goes along. The first time it hurt me so bad. That wasn’t [MASK], either.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Nile	She thought they manufactured them right in the store!” [MASK] meanwhile looked amazed and unhappy as someone who had never even heard of foreign countries, and who is suddenly whisked away and deposited in one, with everybody around speaking an undreamt-of language.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Fern	“I’ll tell them you need their services!” “Looks to me more like you do,” said [MASK] without much malice, and he would drop into a chair and smile at my mother for pouring him tea.
<name>Cholly</name>	Cholly	Owen	[MASK] grunted at me, to show he was a man, and stretched out his feet in a lordly way and moved them fractionally when I said, “Move! I want to scrub here. Move” Sometimes I would kick him or he would trip me and we would fall into kicking, pounding fights.
<name>Thoth</name>	Thoth	Isis	“There is an Egyptian god with four letters,” said my mother, frowning at the crossword, “that I know I know, and I cannot think of it to save my soul.” “[MASK].”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Major	I did not want it to happen, I did not want [MASK] to be shot, but I was full of a tense excitement as well as regret. That scene of execution which I imagined, and which gave me such a flash of darkness—was that altogether unwelcome?
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Naomi	[MASK] sometimes had to bring them from the Post Office. Taking her cue from her mother, she had great contempt for his beliefs. “It’s all prophecies and prophecies,” she said. “They have prophesied the end of the world three times now.”
<name>Yiddish</name>	Yiddish	Austrian	“Well no wonder.” “She made him sleep in the granary.” “He was always yelling and cursing in [MASK], remember when we jumped across his cabbages? The flood of foreign cursing, it would freeze your blood.” “Till I made up my mind
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Garnet	Do you want to join the Baptist Ladies Aid?” “No!” “Well I’m only trying to open your eyes. For your own good.” When [MASK] came to our house she treated him with courtesy, asked him questions about the lumber business.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Kristin	“Is that supposed to be telling that they do it?” I pointed out [MASK]’s thought. Was this ill thing the thing that was sung of in all the songs? It was getting dark when we came out and farmers’ sleighs were heading out of town.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Diane	Or it might suit better if you could come down here, I will write out our full address at the end of the letter. Our place is not hard to find. My sisters child is not a boy it is a girl 18 mos. old named [MASK].
<name>Persephone</name>	Persephone	Isis	“[MASK] is a goddess, I’m surprised at you” Soon after this the snow began to melt, the Wawanash river overflowed its banks, and carried away road signs and fence posts and henhouses, and receded; the roads became more or less navigable, and my mother was out again in the afternoons.
<name>he</name>	he	Naomi	I felt I had no choice but to do this, not particularly because it was something [MASK] wanted me to do, but because I truly hated and feared the Gay-la Dance Hall. The Gay-la Dance Hall was half a mile north of town, on the highway.
<name>Mother</name>	Mother	Fern	It would have to be in the summer holidays, when I was home from school. [MASK] would not yet be home from the Post Office. I would come downstairs in the heat of the late afternoon, a sulphurous still day, wearing only this dressing gown.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Fern	I came home at noon to find [MASK] sitting at the dining room table, which was set for dinner, listening to my mother calling from the kitchen over the noise of the potato masher. “Doesn’t matter what anybody says. You weren’t married.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Owen	I picked on my brother [MASK] to tell. He was three years younger than I was. At one time he had been impressionable and trusting. Once out on the farm we had a shelter of old boards, that we played house in, and he sat on the end of a board
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Naomi	[MASK] and I when we were younger used to draw pictures of men and women with startling gross genitals, the women’s fat, bristling with needley hair, like a porcupine’s back. Wearing a nightgown one could not help being aware of this vile bundle, which pajamas could decently shroud and contain.
<name>Emil</name>	Emil	Diane	On the evening of the second day he drove the car into our yard and sat there for a moment, not looking at us. Then he got out slowly and walked with dignity and weariness towards the house. He did not have [MASK].
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Fern	“Some fellow got her in trouble and walked out on her,” said [MASK] positively. “Otherwise why drown herself, a girl seventeen?” A time came when all the books in the Library in the Town Hall were not enough for me, I had to have my own.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jerry	I thought by her sober tone she was going to go on to talk about the expense. “So you mustn’t get into trouble, you know,” she said matter-of-factly. “[MASK] couldn’t get married. I wouldn’t allow it.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Garnet	“You better not try any chicken,” [MASK] told him, mock solicitously, “we better just give you some warmed-up milk and roll you off to bed!” The old man ate heartily, describing how he had tried warm oil of cloves.
<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Del	Written in pen 1 recall so they’re probably still legible. Here. I’ll give you a sample of my handwriting, that’ll help you out.” He took an envelope out of the glove compartment and wrote on it: [MASK] is a bad girl.
<name>Mayella</name>	Mayella	Marion	The ordinariness of everything brought me up short, made me remember. This was the Sheriffs’ house. I could see a little bit of the hallway, brown and pink wallpaper, through the screen door. That was the doorway through which [MASK] had walked.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Art	“He wouldn’t touch any yellow vegetable. His mother should have taken the paddle to him when he was little. That’s what I used to tell him.” “You’re built the opposite from [MASK],” she told my father.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Del.	“Those hot climates.” “[MASK] You take this book, put it away.” Alarm in my mother’s voice was like the flap of rising wings. Well, I had heard. I did not come back to the dining room but went upstairs and undressed.
<name>I</name>	I	Diane	He and my father worked in the cellar of our house, skinning the bodies of the foxes and turning the pelts inside out and stretching them on long boards to dry. [MASK] went up and down the cellar steps or sat on the top step and watched.
<name>There</name>	There	Major	[MASK] our dog—not allowed into the house during my mother’s reign—asleep on the dirty linoleum in front of the door. Newspapers spread on the table in place of a cloth, dog-haired blanket on the couch, guns and snowshoes and washtubs hung along the walls.
<name>Fluffy</name>	Fluffy	Diane	Then he noticed that several other things were gone too—a table lamp which he was planning to rewire, a nice little rug, some dishes and a blue teapot that had belonged to his mother and two perfectly good folding chairs. She had taken [MASK] too, of course.
<name>No</name>	No	Nossir	“Did the car give you any trouble?” “[MASK]. She run fine. I got off the road once but I hadn’t got too far when I figured what I’d done.” “Did you look at that map I gave you?”
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Garnet	The unreality, long-drawnout embarrassment and tedium of the evening vanished in the cab of the truck, in the smell of its old split seats, and poultry feed, the sight of [MASK]’s rolled-up sleeves and bare forearms, of his hands, loose and alert on the wheel.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Madeleine	I got so much stuff around, she’s bound to bump into things and climb up places and fall.” Early in the Spring, before the snow was all gone, he came one day to say that [MASK] had left.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Naomi	[MASK] was pleased at the idea. “I hope its green or yellow or orange, because those are the colours I’m using for my decorating scheme.” She showed me doilies she had crocheted in those colours.
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	Owen	For once, his explanations were incoherent. I was critical of the meal, as I always was before company; the meat seemed overdone, the potatoes slightly hard, the canned beans too cool. My father and [MASK] had come in from the Flats Road, because it was Sunday.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Garnet	We went out on the back porch, his sisters too, and he made me look up. Carved on the underside of one of the roof-beams of the porch was a list of girls’ names, each one with an X after it. “[MASK]’s girl friends!”
<name>myself</name>	myself	M.I.T.	How would I look at [MASK]?” In talking of his future he was full of grand ambitions, but was careful to express them sarcastically, and fence them round with sober self-admonitions.) I took his judgement like a soldier, because I did not believe it.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Garnet	Then he began tickling me, and we had a tremendous tickling fight in which the sisters took my side, and we tried to pin [MASK] down on the porch floor, but he got away, finally, and raced towards the barn.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Fern	I would come into a room where she was talking to my mother and there would be an unnatural, waiting silence. My mother would be listening with a trapped, determinedly compassionate, miserable face. What could she do? [MASK] was her good, perhaps her only, friend.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Naomi	In our third year at high school [MASK] switched to Commercial; suddenly freed from Latin, Physics, Algebra, she mounted to the third floor of the school where under the sloping roof typewriters clacked all day and the walls were hung with framed maxims preparing one for life in the business world.
<name>life</name>	life	Jubilee	But I thought now there was something admirable, an odd, harsh grace about the way he conformed to type, accepting his role in [MASK], his necessary and gratifying absurdity, with a fatalism, even gallantry, which I would never have been able to muster myself.
<name>Don Giovanni</name>	Don Giovanni	Carmen	I was shaken, imagining the other surrender, more tempting, more gorgeous even than the surrender to sex—the hero’s, the patriot’s, [MASK]’s surrender to the final importance of gesture, image, self-created self. Opera made me hungry.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Naomi	It was the stage of transition, bridge between what was possible, known and normal behaviour, and the magical, bestial act, that I could not imagine. Nothing about that was in [MASK]’s mother’s book.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Naomi	[MASK] meant to go. She said it was for the ten dollars, and to show him. It was true her mother would not have allowed her to go there, but her mother was out of town, on a nursing case, and she did not have to worry about her father.
<name>Lo</name>	Lo	Naomi	Then I had an orgasm. I knew that was what it was called, from [MASK]’s mother’s book, and I knew what it was like, having discovered such seizures by myself, some time ago, with many impatient, indeed ravenous, imaginary lovers.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Caroline	The truth was that some damage had been done to it that I knew could not be put right. Damage had been done; [MASK] and the other Halloways and their town had lost authority; I had lost faith. But I did not want to think about that, and did not.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Bill	Sunday morning, as soon as they had eaten breakfast, they went away, and we never saw either of them again. Some days later my mother burst out to me, “Your Uncle [MASK] is a dying man.” It was nearly suppertime, she was cooking sausages.
<name>Tristan</name>	Tristan	Carmen	(It never occurred to me that I was doing what the article said women did, with works of art.) Voluptuous surrender. Not to a man but to fate, really, to darkness, to death. Yet I loved most of all [MASK], at the end.
<name>Georges</name>	Georges	Jerry	“You should have seen yours when you heard your mother’s voice.” “Most inopportune, Mamma,” said [MASK], trying out an English accent which we also used sometimes, “but it just so happens that I have a young female person here unclothed on my bed.
<name>Virgil</name>	Virgil	Boyd	[MASK], get out of that truck! Get him out of that truck! He put it in gear the other day and it rolled across the yard and missed this verandah by inches.” She took a package of tobacco and some cigarette papers out of her apron pockets.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Garnet	The big yellow man was brought from the verandah and sat at the head of the table; he was the father. From the barn, with [MASK], came an older but sprier man who talked about how he hadn’t slept all the previous night, with toothache.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Owen	In my room with the door shut I read from the Book of Common Prayer. Sometimes walking along the street I would shut my eyes (the way [MASK] and I used to do, playing blind) and say to myself—frowning, praying—“God.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Benny	“From where it was buttin’ him under the bed.” “Two thousand dollars in the bank,” mused my father, to keep this argument from going on. “Now there’s a woman. You ought to look around for a woman like that, [MASK].”
<name>Tiger</name>	Tiger	Robber	In the stable they showed me how to milk, which is not so easy as it looks. They took turns squirting milk into the mouth of a barn cat which rose on its hind legs a few feet away. It was a dirty looking striped tom, called [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Phyllis	[MASK] quietly took the top off the saltcellar and poured salt into the sugar bowl and passed it to the old man. Her mother grabbed it just in time. “I’ll skin you alive someday!” she promised. There is no denying I was happy in that house.
<name>Waldo</name>	Waldo	Dale	“Her,” said [MASK], nodding at me. My head bobbed in his glasses. “Don’t you know her? She sits in front of you.” I was afraid it would turn out to be a joke.
<name>Wesley</name>	Wesley	Owen	“[MASK] wants to see the ferret,” I said. “He’ll have to wait till another time. Don’t come no closer than here.” After some time he came out of the house carrying a small child. I was disappointed; she was what it was.
<name>thunder</name>	thunder	Satan	I wanted to see the effect.” “He came in pale as a sheet and gloomy as [MASK] and sat down and never said a word. We expected him at least to mention there was some crazy darky loose in the county. He never did.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jerry	A horn honked at us, and from an old truck, dusty with chaff, this face looked out. It was in no way changed or diminished by daylight. “The encyclopedias,” I said to [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Fern	“What do you think it might be?” “I don’t know.” He parked the car behind the creamery, under the chestnut trees with the leaves just out, bitter yellowy green. Here? “You get into [MASK]’s room?
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Fern	My mother spoke of him as “[MASK]’s friend,” in a clarifying tone of voice, as if to insist that the word friend in this case meant not more than it was supposed to mean. “They enjoy each other’s company,” she said.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jerry	When he did, if he did, I would kill him. I heard them talking in the front room, then in the kitchen. [MASK] and his mother. “Wants to get her beauty sleep?” I heard his mother say, then laugh—unkindly I thought.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jerry	He could not do otherwise; he was what he seemed. I whose natural boundaries were so much more ambiguous, who soaked up protective coloration wherever it might be found, began to see that it might be restful, to be like [MASK].
