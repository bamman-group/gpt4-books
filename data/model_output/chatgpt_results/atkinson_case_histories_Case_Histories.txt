<name>She</name>	She	Amelia	[MASK] would have left him to this happy dream but then the thought struck her that, rather than chasing something, perhaps he himself was being chased, and that the noises he was making were the sounds of fear rather than excitement (how could two things so opposite seem so similar?)
<name>Mayella</name>	Mayella	Shirley	“Did she?” “It was in the arresting officer’s report, why wasn’t it used in her defense?” “I don’t know.” [MASK]’s slender feet were very brown, as if she went around barefoot a lot outside.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Laura	Even the boys were interested in her, as if she were a novel science project (“Can she focus yet?” “Does she recognize you?”), but [MASK] felt completely disinterested. She knew it would be different when she had her own, but other people’s babies left her cold.
<name>Julie</name>	Julie	Jackson	It sounded like a bad Dutch porn movie. There was that survey, years ago, that found that women didn’t feel threatened by a man carrying the Guardian or wearing a CND badge. [MASK] had wondered at the time how many rapists started carrying a Guardian around with them.
<name>Prince Charles</name>	Prince Charles	Jonathan	“They’re bigger,” and months later she regurgitated this fact to a colleague at school who fell about with laughter so that she felt like an idiot. By then she had a ruby-and-diamond ring on her finger, a ring that had once belonged to [MASK]’s father’s mother.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Michelle	and then she ran outside and got the ax from where it was stuck in a log beside the sawhorse, and then she ran back inside with it. $ $ It was very cold, because of course the fire had never been lit. [MASK] was sitting on the floor.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Victor	It had amazed them when they discovered that [MASK] — who neither of them could remember ever having watched television — not only owned a huge wide-screen set but also subscribed to cable — and to everything, not just sport and films but all of the X-rated channels.
<name>He</name>	He	Jackson	She stood respectfully in front of a headstone that looked more weather-beaten than it should have been after thirty-three years and he wondered if his father had ordered a cheap sandstone for his wife’s memorial. [MASK] didn’t feel much when he looked at it.
<name>Janice</name>	Janice	Julia	A nudist? They called themselves naturalists now, didn’t they? The man toweled himself off and then lay down on the riverbank, completely unselfconsciously, and started reading a book. “Golly gosh,” [MASK] laughed. “Did you see that?
<name>Mrs. Coulter</name>	Mrs. Coulter	Keith	Unless she learned to spin time. Or her head exploded. So much toil and drudgery, it was like being a serf in the Middle Ages. It was feudal. “Let me take the pushchair,” [MASK] said.
<name>Patrick</name>	Patrick	Jackson	[MASK] was regarding her with concern, as if she were a mental patient. It was almost morning and they had only just gone to bed. She could still hear the police, cars departing and arriving, the sound of their radios.
<name>They</name>	They	Jackson	And you didn’t call the police?” They both frowned. It was funny because although they looked quite different they shared exactly the same facial expressions. [MASK] supposed that was what was meant by “fleeting resemblance.”
<name>Mr. Brown</name>	Mr. Brown	Jackson	[MASK] had never mentioned having a daughter, but then you didn’t, did you? Bank managers, bus drivers, they didn’t spend their time saying, “I have a daughter, by the way.” “Have you got children?”
<name>you</name>	you	Jackson	“No, I’m not.” “Yes, you are. Basic interrogation fact: people look up to the left when they’re remembering and up to the right when they’re inventing. You looked up to the right.” Shut up, [MASK].
<name>Carly</name>	Carly	Julia	You can’t see a thing without them.” “What did the server say?” “You’re so vain, [MASK].” “I think he said, ‘G’day there.’ ” “I don’t know, I wasn’t paying attention.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Keith	[MASK] didn’t understand why she had started a vegetable garden. “We’re living on a bloody farm,” he said, stretching his arms out expansively so he looked like a scarecrow — they were in a field at the time — “the place is full of vegetables.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Julia	Nonetheless, she shaved her legs and armpits, although for the life of her she couldn’t see what was wrong with body hair, and painted (rather badly) her toenails, and showered and perfumed herself with something French that [MASK] had left behind after a visit.
<name>Penny</name>	Penny	Poppy	and she’d wanted a dog so badly that he had finally given in and they drove to the dog’s home and came back with [MASK]. She was still only a few months old, someone had thrown her out of a moving car. How could anyone do that?
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Mummy	He thought of hunter-gatherers and peasants. “So [MASK] can make jam.” “Jam? Your mother?” The born-again wife, the jam-making peasant mother, came out of the kitchen, licking something off her fingers.
<name>He</name>	He	Jackson	He was a born-again smoker, only starting up again six months ago. [MASK] hadn’t touched a cigarette for fifteen years and now it was as if he’d never been off them. And for no reason.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Laura	“She was stuck-up when I first met her, but she was just middle class, you know. You can’t hold that against a person, can you? Aye, well, you can, but not [MASK]. She had a good heart.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jackson	[MASK] had phoned her from the car to tell her he was coming, and she seemed pleased to be interrupted, as if she already realized that burying herself in a small seaside town might not be the best way to spend her nonworking life.
<name>he</name>	he	Jackson	He saw his visits to her more as a social service: no one else ever visited the poor old cow and [MASK] had a tolerance for her idiosyncrasies that surprised even himself. She was an old Nazi boot but you had to admire her spirit.
<name>Miss Marple</name>	Miss Marple	Jackson	An entirely innocent man.” [MASK] didn’t believe in the entire innocence of anyone apart from animals and children, and not all children, at that. He offered her more coffee but she just shook her head as if he were a distracting insect.
<name>Walt</name>	Walt	Victor	It made him more human somehow. [MASK]’s chin was bristled with white, and this new beard, coupled with the weight he had lost, made him unfamiliar. Only his hands seemed not to have shrunk — still huge, like bony shovels, brutish against his sticklike wrists.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Jackson	[MASK] could not have lived with a room like that in his house. An upstairs bedroom that looked like a police incident room — photographs and maps pinned to the wall, flowcharts and whiteboards, timetables of events. Two metal filing cabinets, bursting with files, boxes on the floor containing yet more files.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Jackson	“I mean it couldn’t, not really, I wasn’t there, in that office, at that moment in time, but there’s something about random violence . . .” “Was it? Random?” [MASK] said.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Julia	He looked at her, hauling on the pole, fag hanging out the corner of her lipsticked mouth, and thought that she was a good sport and was surprised to realize that he was growing genuinely fond of [MASK]. And that “good sport” was her language, not his.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Binky	[MASK] had never mentioned having family. “I hardly know the boy,” she added, with a dismissive wave of her hand. “My nephew and I weren’t close, but the boy’s the only family I have.”
<name>Father Arnold</name>	Father Arnold	Jackson	Didn’t that make it her fault? Then [MASK] had taken her aside at the funeral and said, “I’m going to break the sanctity of the confessional,” as if he were a priest. He would have made a very good priest.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Theo	[MASK] had a strange sense of triumph. He had traveled on a train that had almost been derailed but no harm had come. The odds surely dictated that his chances (and therefore the chances of those close to him) of being in another train accident had lessened.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Jackson	[MASK] looked at the doll on the table. It was made of some kind of grubby toweling material and had long thin legs and arms and the head of a mouse. And it was blue. Understanding finally dawned. He nodded at it.
<name>she</name>	she	Olivia	And she felt so unbearably sad when she thought of all the things [MASK] had never done, never ridden a bike or climbed a tree or read a book on her own, she’d never been to school, or a theater or a concert.
<name>Santiago</name>	Santiago	Jackson	Inside there was no note, just a box, and in a nest lined with midnight-blue velvet was an opal pendant, a little plaque of sky. [MASK] knew he was being given a lesson by the old man, but it had taken him many years to understand it.
<name>Heisenberg</name>	Heisenberg	Shirley	I wanted to go to medical school, be a doctor, but that was never going to happen, not after everything we went through.” “And now you want me to look for your sister?” [MASK] laughed as if he’d said something absurd, “God, no.
<name>her</name>	her	Jackson	There was something familiar about her. Most people who looked familiar to [MASK] usually turned out to be criminals, but she didn’t look like a criminal. “Well,” he said, gesturing vaguely round the office, “we can talk now if you like?”
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Marlee	He could see it in her eyes. Are we going home now?” [MASK] asked with an extravagant sigh as she clambered into the back of the car. “I’m starving.” “No, you’re not.” “Yes, I am.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Amelia	“It’s just a form of escapism,” [MASK] added dismis-sively. “She doesn’t have to pay bills, or think about where her next meal’s coming from. She never has to be alone."
<name>Edmund's</name>	Edmund's	Fidelma	She took [MASK]’s death worse than anyone. It wasn’t so much her death, it was the time she took dying, so that when their mother did finally expire her last, sickly breath, it was welcomed by everyone.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Binky	He had to push hard on the gate to open it. He felt like an intruder. He was an intruder. There was a piece of crime tape caught on one of the branches of [MASK]’s apple trees. It wasn’t a crime scene anymore.
<name>Karen</name>	Karen	Valerie	He could hear the breath in his chest, it sounded as loud as the lawn mower. To be allergic to summer seemed wrong somehow. His wife, [MASK], had never been sympathetic, she’d seen his allergies and asthma as another kind of character weakness.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Julia	“I don’t think so,” [MASK] said, after having mulled over the dog question (did they ever agree about anything?). “No, not a pointer. And certainly not an English one. Perhaps an Old Danish pointer.
<name>Dentist</name>	Dentist	Jackson	Unfortunately, there was no possibility of having a relationship with someone who had to put on a mask, protective glasses, and gloves to touch you. (Or one who peered into your mouth and murmured, “Smoking, [MASK]?”)
<name>John</name>	John	Jackson	Nothing had been taken from him, his wallet, his watch, his car, were all left behind, but then he’d fought back before the guy could take anything. In [MASK]’s experience, muggers didn’t usually try and smash your skull in.
<name>She</name>	She	Amelia	Spice things up between you. It took you long enough to find a boyfriend, it would be a shame to lose him because you can’t get out of the missionary position.” [MASK] buttered the toast and laid it on plates.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Amelia	When she saw what was happening she dropped the ice cream and ran toward the bench, pulling her Ventolin inhaler from her handbag and holding it to the fat man’s gaping fish mouth. Then she produced her mobile and thrust it at [MASK], shouting, “Phone an ambulance!”
<name>John</name>	John	Jackson	“Yes.” “Christ, [MASK], what are you, the last good man standing? It was just sex, get over it.” She closed the door on him. He’d had a bad feeling about her, he should have gone with it.
<name>he</name>	he	Amelia	His speciality had been probability and risk, which [MASK] didn’t understand at all (he was always trying to demonstrate probability to her by tossing coins), but it struck her as ironic that a man who studied risk for a living had never taken one in his life.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jonathan	People seemed to find it hard to believe that [MASK] would marry someone who didn’t know a forelock from a fetlock, but actually he didn’t give two hoots whether or not she liked horses. That was one of the really good things about him — he was totally indifferent to anything she did.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Theo	He didn’t feel up to facing the inquisitive female warmth that always seemed to greet him whenever he walked into the midst of a pack of mothers. He leafed through some of the many papers and files he had brought with him from [MASK]’s house.
<name>she</name>	she	Jackson	I hope.” Well , it was one way to keep women safe. Just put them in a convent. “Get thee to a nunnery.” The convent smelled like every Catholic church [MASK] had ever been inside — an excess of incense and Mansion House polish.
<name>lesbian</name>	lesbian	Julia	“And you’re being patronizing, ‘Steady boyfriend’ and ‘[MASK]’ aren’t words that have ever occurred in the same sentence. If it’s not a good thing for you, why is it a good thing for me?”
<name>Netflix</name>	Netflix	Victor	Every evening since their arrival they had lit a fire and sat in front of the sitting-room hearth with the same kind of devotion that prehistoric people must have afforded flames, except that prehistoric people didn’t have [MASK]’s extensive cable package to entertain themselves with.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Milly	“There are worse things.” “Such as?” “Meteors.” “The possibility of a meteor colliding with the earth doesn’t mean that we should embrace the Americanization of our language and culture.” “Oh, shut up, [MASK], do.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jackson	A year later [MASK] received a parcel addressed to him at the police station. Inside there was no note, just a box, and in a nest lined with midnight-blue velvet was an opal pendant, a little plaque of sky.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Howell	(Although had he had any friends other than [MASK]?) Maybe this was why people filled their house with stinking cats, so they didn’t notice that they were alone, so they wouldn’t die without a living soul noticing.
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Victor	Too many to keep count of undoubtedly.) [MASK] made her scrub her makeup off with a nailbrush. Sometimes he ignored them for days, only coming out of his study for meals. Other times he was on their case continually like some kind of religious patriarch.
<name>Indiana</name>	Indiana	Julia	And technically it all belongs to us now.” “No, I didn’t mean that. I found something,” [MASK] said, opening the drawer and removing an object, handling it delicately like an archaeologist removing an artifact that might disintegrate in the air.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Jackson	[MASK] laughed humorlessly. “No, it wasn’t. A thirty-third, that’s not a significant one, is it? Thirty-three years since my sister died.” “I’m sorry.” “I think it was just one too many.
<name>Carol</name>	Carol	Julia	The idea of lesbianism made her feel slightly squeamish. [MASK] said she had had sex with women, dropped it into the conversation with the same casual air as if she were talking about which supermarket she preferred or the latest books she’d read.
<name>he</name>	he	Marlee	“You’re late,” she said to him now, “Where have you been?” “We went to see a witch,” [MASK] said. Le chat noir. Les chats noirs. Did chats have a gender? Was there a chatte?
<name>He</name>	He	Laura	Of course, if they did love you then that was the icing on the cake with cherries on top. And chocolate shavings and those little silver balls that cracked your fillings. [MASK] used to love those. He always decorated the cakes he made.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Howell	“As in what, take him out?” “Well, I wasn’t thinking anything that drastic, but if you want, yeah, why not?” [MASK] said. “No, I don’t want. I want everything done by the book.
<name>Mrs. Ramsey</name>	Mrs. Ramsey	Olivia	When she tried to imagine the husband who would live with her in this white house, all she could conjure up was a blur, a shadow of a man who passed her on stairs and in hallways, and murmured polite greetings. By the time [MASK] had roused them all it was nearly half past seven.
<name>Flora</name>	Flora	Julia	The crematorium chapel was chilled by the air-conditioning, but outside it was hot. [MASK] was just as bad, rejecting the black of bereavement and muffling herself from head to toe in a vintage coat in grass-green velvet (were they cold-blooded, like reptiles?).
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Jackson	[MASK] tried to remember thirty-four years ago. He would have been eleven years old. Had it been hot? He had no idea. He couldn’t remember eleven. The important thing about it was that it wasn’t twelve.
<name>Paula</name>	Paula	Porla	They couldn’t even be bothered to pronounce her name properly — “Powla,” she continually corrected them, making the vowels stretch exotically like a cat yawning, and yet they still insisted on “[MASK]” in their posh, tight little voices.
<name>Chris</name>	Chris	Keith	Probably. She wasn’t getting any sleep, people go crazy if they don’t sleep. But they were out to get her, the press, [MASK]’s family. He didn’t do anything wrong, he didn’t beat her or anything.
<name>Their mother</name>	Their mother	Rosemary	Were accessories still seasonal? They were when their mother was around. [MASK] had worn white shoes and carried a white handbag in the summer. A little straw hat. Zip-up suede boots for winter and — was she imagining this? — a woolen tammy.
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Tanya	Did her husband know? The woman who loved babies who’d lost touch with the one baby above all others that she was supposed to look after. [MASK]. Something scratched at the edge of his memory, but he was so tired he could hardly remember his own name.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Amelia	[MASK] had once heard someone say that you could tell what a woman’s orgasm would be like if you heard her sneeze. (As if you would want to know.) Just recollecting this thought made her uncomfortable.
<name>the parent</name>	the parent	Theo	Perhaps she was afraid she would have to look after him, but he would never do that to her. As far as [MASK] was concerned the parent-child relationship was one way, you gave them all your love and they were under no obligation to pay a penny back.
<name>Don Draper</name>	Don Draper	Theo	He’d been late so he’d left the girl with the frog-yellow hair and thought, On the way back I’ll ask her name. And the spouses of all those disgruntled women in [MASK]’s filing cabinet — did any of them play golf?
<name>John</name>	John	Jackson	They could hear sirens in the distance. [MASK] stayed on the phone with the dispatcher, although he was having a hard time giving her an idea of their position. They were on a narrow road now, made narrower by the overgrown hedgerows.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Julia	“Like some hippie order,” [MASK] had said. “They go around barefoot in the summer and they make their own sandals for the winter, and they keep animals as pets and they’re all vegetarians.”
<name>she</name>	she	Jackson	They were at primary school together. I never liked him much. He was always full of himself. He was very clever.” “I can’t find out where he is,” [MASK] said. “He dropped out.
<name>his brother's</name>	his brother's	Francis	Once the mince and potatoes were on he crept upstairs to his room. His father was still in bed and he didn’t want to wake him for all kinds of reasons but mainly because he wanted to sneak one of [MASK]’s fags from a cache he’d discovered in his wardrobe.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Jackson	[MASK] cracked the car window to let in some air and let out some smoke. She was always late. Coffee was no good for punctuating the tedium, unless he was prepared to piss into a bottle, which he wasn’t.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Michelle	[MASK] had only just left her own (unsatisfactory) childhood behind, so how was she supposed to be in charge of someone else’s? She knew the term was “bonding,” it was in a baby book she had {How to Have a Happy Baby.
<name>she</name>	she	Josie	He remembered the first time he held her, when the whole of her head fit into the palm of his hand and [MASK] said “be careful” (as if he wouldn’t be) and he had vowed to himself that nothing bad would ever happen to her, that he would keep her safe.
<name>he</name>	he	Rosemary	The loss of the room was as nothing to the loss of the way of life that [MASK] had planned to fill it with. What he actually did in there was a mystery to all of them. Something so important, apparently, that his home life was trifling in comparison.
<name>David</name>	David	Jackson	‘Old family home.’ ” “Well,” [MASK] said, “how about we remove any emotional significance from those three words and just treat them as two adjectives and a noun. Old. Family. Home. True or false?”
<name>Uncle Pumblechook</name>	Uncle Pumblechook	Victor	Do you think he’s left us any money? Christ, I hope he has.” [MASK] had never discussed his will with them, never discussed money with them. He gave the impression of having none, but then he had always been miserly.
<name>Patricia</name>	Patricia	Amelia	But you don’t have to. I’m going to ask for it all. And it’s not to take away. It’s to sit in.” “That’s not even grammatical,” [MASK] said. “There’s nothing grammatical about this meal.
<name>Jemima</name>	Jemima	Jackson	[MASK]’s big sister, who would have been fifty years old this week. The crew appeared in the terminal, wheeling their neat little flight bags behind them, going at a cracking pace across the tarmac, focused entirely on getting home, being off duty.
<name>Aunt Maria</name>	Aunt Maria	Olivia	She frowned with the effort of remembering. “That was after [MASK], I think. She said the garden was cursed and if we went in there we’d be turned into cats. That all her cats were people who’d gone into her garden.
<name>he</name>	he	Theo	His inhaler was still sitting on the hall table. The rooms smelled stale so [MASK] opened all the windows and thought he might buy a perfumed candle, an expensive one, not the ones that smelled of cheap vanilla and air freshener.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jackson	“No, I don’t want. I want everything done by the book. I’m going to call it in. There’s a warrant out for the guy’s arrest.” “You’re such a policeman, [MASK].” “Yeah, I know.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Binky	Unexpectedly, absurdly rich. [MASK] had made him the sole beneficiary of her estate — two million pounds, in bonds and stocks, all of which had been sitting in a safe-deposit box all these years while she hadn’t spent a bean on anything but her cats.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Jackson	Still — and it was a close call —[MASK] preferred the summer population to the yahs and hooray Henrys of term time. Was it just the envy of the underclass? Was it his father’s voice in his head that he could hear?
<name>Nomi</name>	Nomi	Julia	She mustn’t get used to waking up in a house where someone knew her, inside out. “Handcuffs,” [MASK] continued airily, as if she were discussing seasonal accessories, “a little bit of leather or a whip.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jackson	“Not really,” [MASK] said. “I mean it couldn’t, not really, I wasn’t there, in that office, at that moment in time, but there’s something about random violence . . .” “Was it? Random?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jackson	lying in the remains of her orchard, the long grass damp with dew, although not the grass beneath her body, which had remained as dry as her old bones. “She’s been lying here for hours,” the pathologist said, and [MASK] felt his heart lurch.
<name>He</name>	He	Howell	’s outfit he actually made it seem strangely distinguished. [MASK] must be at a dangerous age as well. What was he doing about it? It must be more than six months since they had spoken. That was how you lost people, a little carelessness
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Jackson	[MASK] never considered the future but he thought being a miner looked okay, the comradeship, the drinking — like being in a grown-up gang really, but his father said it was a job that you wouldn’t make a dog do, and this was a man who hated dogs.
<name>He</name>	He	Jackson	Maybe this was why people filled their house with stinking cats, so they didn’t notice that they were alone, so they wouldn’t die without a living soul noticing. [MASK] hoped that wouldn’t happen to him.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Julia	[MASK] was so badly affected by the dust in the house that, as well as all the medication she took (she treated it like sweets), she had started to wear a face mask and goggles that she’d bought in a do-it-yourself place.
<name>he</name>	he	Jackson	And she’d picked some flowers from the garden (hard to find among the weeds) and put them in a vase so that [MASK] would look at her and see that she was a woman. But he hadn’t come, of course.
<name>Aidensfield</name>	Aidensfield	Caroline	There was an ice-cream van and a children’s gymkhana and a small perfect antique merry-go-round. It was unreal. It was ridiculous. At any moment [MASK] expected a steam train to pull up and the cast of bloody Heartbeat to alight on the platform.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Laura	He hadn’t even done the list on a computer but had laboriously handwritten all the names. The guy was crazy. The friends were also color coded by sex — blue ink for the girls, red for the boys, which made it easy to see that [MASK]’s closest friends were mosdy girls.
