<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Minnie	“I’ll get [MASK] settled down and stay with her until she goes to sleep. Then I’d like some supper,” she told the clerk. “It dont matter what it is.” “It’s a little late,” the clerk said.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Butch	“We has that back home too. Only they mentions why, even to niggers.” “Oh, a lawyer,” [MASK] said. “He wants to see a paper. Show him one. —Never mind, 111 do it.”
<name>Velutha</name>	Velutha	McWillie	Because what better sign than a black eye or a cut mouf can a woman want from a man that he got her on his mind?” So once more, in the clutch of our respective starting grooms, [MASK] and I sat our skittering and jockeying mounts behind that wire.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Boon	So I closed the door and locked the padlock and opened the lot gate for [MASK] to drive out and closed that too and got in, the car already in motion—if in fact it had ever completely stopped.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Butch	“Let’s me and you go out front, or anywhere else that’s private, too. I got a word for you.” “About what?” [MASK] said. She didn’t answer, already walking toward the door. “Private, you say?”
<name>Myrtle</name>	Myrtle	Sam	“You’re going to leave your boss’s automobile—I mean your boss’s horse—I mean this horse, whoever it really belongs to—here with nobody to watch it but this colored boy?” [MASK] said.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Everbe	[MASK] told him. I know what it is now. The doctor looked at her. “How’d you happen to have that handy?” he said. Then he lifted the spectacles by one comer and looked at her again and said, “Oh.”
<name>Al</name>	Al	Boon	[MASK] put his grip on the bed and opened it and took out a clean shirt and his other pants. They were his everyday pants but the Sunday ones he had on wouldn’t be fit to wear anywhere until they were cleaned with naphtha probably. “You see?”
<name>Snopes</name>	Snopes	Ned	“Get out and fold up that tarpollyon where it wont take up no more room than it has to,” he told [MASK]. “And air it off some too if we got to ride with it.”
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Boon	[MASK] said in that fierce, quite courteous murmur. “If I didn’t speak plain enough, excuse me. What I’m trying to say is, shut up.” “Only, what in the world do he want with the middle-buster?”
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Boon	I got money—can get it—” “Shut up,” I said. “I aint going nowhere now.” I went on, still blind; or that is, the hand carried me. “Wait,” [MASK] said.
<name>Bayard</name>	Bayard	Boon	“At least I hope he started it: not half your size even if he is a year older. No wonder he pulled a knife—” “He aint even as old,” I said. "He’s ten.” “He told me he was twelve,” [MASK] said.
<name>Dilsey</name>	Dilsey	Everbe	“You got two sets of dirt now;” “It’s almost seven oclock,” I said. “We’re already late for breakfast.” “You can bathe first,” he said. “I got to get dressed so I can thank [MASK] for washing my clothes.”
<name>Jody</name>	Jody	Ned	“There aint time now,” [MASK] said. “He’ll have to run this one now. The trouble is, the only one around here that knows how to rate this horse, is the very one that knows better than to let him run behind.
<name>he</name>	he	Ned	I told him last night I would.” “I’m not going home yet,” I said. “I’m just going to town for a minute. Then I’ll come back here.” “All right,” [MASK] said.
<name>Boon</name>	Boon	Ned	“And air it off some too if we got to ride with it.” “It was all that bumping and jolting you done,” [MASK] said. “You talk like I broke my manners just on purpose to get caught.”
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Lycurgus	but I could certainly hear the supper bell here. “How did you get the tooth back?” I said. “It wasn’t me,” he said. “[MASK] done it. That first morning, when I come back to the hotel to get you.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Everbe	I mean, about word already being around. There was nothing wrong with my hand when [MASK] took the riding-sock off. I mean, it felt like anybody’s hand would that had been cut across the inside of the fingers yesterday.
<name>Anse</name>	Anse	Boon	Now he looked at the already geared-up mules standing there swishing and slapping at mosquitoes while they waited for us. “Now, that’s what I calls convenient—” he said. “Shut up,” [MASK] said in a fierce murmur.
<name>Boo</name>	Boo	Boss	I wont mind.” They looked at me, quite still, quite identical. “I sleep with [MASK] a lot of times,” I said. “He snores too. I dont mind.”
<name>Temple</name>	Temple	Lucius	“I aint got nothing to talk about now. I’ve quit. [MASK] is the one that’s got tin badge and pullman cap rivals now.” But I was already getting up because I knew now where she was. “Is that all the breakfast you want?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Boon	“You going to run him today?” the conductor said. “Tomorrow,” [MASK] said. “Well, we got to get him there first,” the conductor said, looking at his watch. “Who’s going to ride with him?”
<name>Uncle Oscar</name>	Uncle Oscar	Boss	And I was only eleven; I didn’t know how I knew that too, but I did: that you never ask anyone how much he won or lost gambling. So I said: “I mean, would there be enough to pay back [MASK] his four hundred and ninety-six dollars?”
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Boon	We went on; there would be a moon after a while, because our oil headlights were better to show someone else you were coming rather than to light you where you were going; when suddenly [MASK] said, “What’s that smell? Was it you?”
<name>Peabody</name>	Peabody	Boon	“Didn’t you bring nothing?” [MASK] said. “Not even a clean handkerchief?” “I wont need anything,” I said. “Well, you cant sleep like that. Look at them clean sheets. At least take off your shoes and pants.
<name>Skeeter</name>	Skeeter	Lightning	“Too many folks. But mainly, too many heats. If it was just one heat, one run, off in the bushes somewhere and not nobody around but me and you and [MASK] and that other horse and whoever gonter ride him, we would be all right.
<name>Boon</name>	Boon	Boon	So it’s the bridge I thought. Maybe there’s not even a bridge at all and that’s what’s wrong. And [MASK] read my mind there too. “Don’t worry about the bridge. We aint even come to the bridge yet.”
<name>Shane</name>	Shane	Boon	“Supper’ll be soon, and then we got to meet the train. And that tin-badge stallion will be neighing and prancing back here any time now.” He took her arm. “Come on.” That was when I had to begin to listen to [MASK].
<name>Shug</name>	Shug	Ned	“Hold on now.” “Folks coming in here tomorrow morning already missing a whole boxcar,” [MASK] said, “aint gonter have time to be little-minded over a homemade ladder outen somebody’s henhouse.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sam	Here.” She held out her hand. “I dont want it,” I said. “What did I tell you?” [MASK] said. “Is it because it was gambling?” she said. “Did you promise that too?”
<name>Macomber</name>	Macomber	Ned	“Bring him in.” We came up and stopped. He was sweating a little, but that was all. “How do he feel?” [MASK] said. I tried to tell him. “The front half of him dont want to run.”
<name>Peabody</name>	Peabody	Everbe	“He’s just gone on ahead; he aint got nowhere else to go. We’ll pick him up.” “But why?” [MASK] said. “Why didn’t he—” “How do I know?”
<name>Chigurh</name>	Chigurh	Ned	“Hold up, Miss,” [MASK] said. “I’ll handle it.” He looked tired, but that was all. Without haste he drew a folded flour sack from his hip pocket and unfolded it and took out his worn snap purse and opened it.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Boon	“All right,” she said: serene, no more plain than a big porcelain lamp with the wick burning inside is plain. “He’s coming too. He’s going to help us. He—” “Not me,” [MASK] said.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Ned	We was afraid we would have to break in a new one. See yawl at the track.” Then he was gone. But I waited another minute. “But why?” I said. “I dont know,” [MASK] said.
<name>Reuben</name>	Reuben	Boon	But she was simply too big, too strong for even anyone as big and strong as [MASK] to hold with just one hand, with no more grip than that; she was free. “Aint you ashamed of yourself,” she said.
<name>Armstid</name>	Armstid	Boon	“Just one day,” I said. “Two nights, but just one day.” “You been travelling since,” [MASK] said. “You got two sets of dirt now;” “It’s almost seven oclock,” I said.
<name>Snopes</name>	Snopes	Ned	“If I can use one of the mules, I’ll send you the money as soon as I get home.” He rose at once. “Come on,” he said. “Hold on,” [MASK] said.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Otis	And the same with other children; they cant help it either. But [MASK] looked like two or three years ago he had already reached where you wont be until next year, and since then he had been going backward. He was still talking.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Boon	I dont mean stronger: I. just mean more. I didn’t know much about boarding houses, so maybe they could have one with just ladies in it. I asked [MASK]; we were on the way back downstairs then; it was beginning to get dark and I was hungry.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Boon	She washed the blood off and uncorked the bottle. “It’s going to sting,” she said. It did. She tore a strip from the shirt and bound my hand. “He still wont tell what they were fighting about,” [MASK] said.
<name>Boone</name>	Boone	Otis	hounds were all that good on [MASK] last night, they sure ought to be able to handle rabbits or coons or possums. So I asked him. It was full night now for some time. He said quietly behind me; I hadn’t even heard him until then: “Had a bite yet?”
<name>Abner</name>	Abner	Lycurgus	His hand didn’t even stop, now returning the coins one by one from [MASK]’s hand, and then the frayed bills, back into the purse, and closed it and folded it back into the flour sack and put the sack back into his pocket.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Ned	“I thought that was why we came here.” “Sure, sure,” he said. “[MASK] told me. You told me. Everybody told me. Only, why didn’t somebody make me believe it? Oh sure, I never broke a leg.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Boon	We went back to town. We went fast this time; if there was scenery now, nobody in that automobile used any of it. It was going on five oclock now. [MASK] spoke, tense and urgent but quite composed: “We got to let it cool awhile.
<name>Flem</name>	Flem	McWillie	[MASK]’s starting groom having declined to be hurled to earth three times, and nobody else either volunteering or even accepting conscription, they used a piece of cotton-bagging jute stretched from rail to rail in the hands of two more democrats facing each other across the track.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Everbe	He said something else, foul, which was his nature; vicious, which was his nature; completely unnecessary, which was his nature too. Yes, even finally knowing what it was didn’t help with him. By this time [MASK] had him.
<name>Templeton</name>	Templeton	Lucius	“You brought that nephew of yours over here hunting refinement. Here it is, waiting for him. He wont know what it means, let alone why he’s doing it. But maybe [MASK] could learn him to at least ape it.
<name>Flem</name>	Flem	Ned	“How much do that come to?” [MASK] said. “You cant be interested, because you aint even run the first heat yet, let alone won it. But I dont mind telling you, in confidence, you might say.
<name>Providence</name>	Providence	Nonvirtue	You see: doing the best I could with what I had, knew. Not that I was losing faith in ultimate success: it simply seemed to me that [MASK] was wasting in merely testing me that time which was urgent and even desperate for greater ends.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Boon	“Looks like you did get through last summer, after all.” “Looks like it,” [MASK] said. He had changed, instantaneous and complete, like a turned page: the poker player who has just seen the second deuce fall to a hand across the table.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Sam	“I thought you’d say that,” she said. “So I had [MASK] put up another five for you. You got seven-fifty coming. Here.” She held out her hand. “I dont want it,” I said.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sam	“He aint got no whistle nor bell neither on him. He aint even got a headlight. I’m surprised you can see him a-tall.” “What do you mean by that?” [MASK] said.
<name>John</name>	John	McWillie	"We just rid as far as the pasture and turned them loose. We walked the balance of the way.” “Well, anyway, you come to see a horse, so we wont disappoint you. Bring him out, [MASK], where they can look at him.”
<name>Red</name>	Red	Sam	And [MASK] was thinking what I had been thinking ever since I saw the platform. “There’s a ramp around at the back,” he said. “Did he ever walk a ramp before? Why dont you take him on now and let him look at it.
<name>Pa</name>	Pa	Boon	[MASK] handed them in to me. “With all them clean clothes, you got to bathe again,” he said. “You just made me bathe Satin-day,” I said. “We was on the road Saturday night,” he said.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Ned	“All he needs is for both of them to be able to stand up long enough to start.” “Can you make this one stand up that long?” “That’s right,” [MASK] said. “Can you make him run while he’s standing up?”
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Everbe	So I took the money; I had two rolls of it now, the big one and this little one. And still [MASK] hadn’t moved, motionless, her hands in her lap, big, too big for little things to happen to.
<name>Lucius</name>	Lucius	Ned	The man took his six dollars and went away with his mules and double-tree; I noticed in fact that he didn’t return to his little house but went on back through the swamp and vanished, as if the day were over; so did [MASK] notice it.
<name>Abner</name>	Abner	Ned	“You can go with him, if you want,” he said. “No sir,” I said. “I’m going to stay here.” “Who does he belong to?” the constable said. “He’s with me,” [MASK] said.
<name>Corley</name>	Corley	Butch	He stood there quietly, holding it in his hand. “What do you think of that,” [MASK] said. “A man that cant even read, wanting to see a paper. Smell it then. Maybe it smells all right.”
<name>Samson</name>	Samson	Boon	So [MASK] started in right away to tear that steel door down but they had remembered to already lock it, so you would think that would have calmed him: you know: having to sit there and look at it for a while. Anyhow, we thought so.
<name>Artie</name>	Artie	Boon	He took the key from his pocket and gave it to [MASK]. “Come on,” he said. We crossed the street toward home. And do you know what I thought? I thought It hasn’t even changed. Became it should have.
<name>Temple</name>	Temple	Boon	“But your mother’s not here now,” he said. “You’re on a tear with [MASK] now. Eighty—is it?—miles away.” “No sir,” I said. “I promised her.”
<name>Flem</name>	Flem	Otis	“And the making up you needs to do is to make back up that street to wherever it is you gonter sleep tonight, and go to bed.” He even paused, half turning. “Do you know the way back?” “There aint nothing there,” [MASK] said.
<name>Rawlins</name>	Rawlins	Ned	[MASK] had seen it too. He had already had one hard look at the mudhole. Now he looked at the already geared-up mules standing there swishing and slapping at mosquitoes while they waited for us. “Now, that’s what I calls convenient—” he said.
<name>Jody</name>	Jody	Lycurgus	Put him up a gum sapling behind the henhouse about a hour ago, until [MASK] went and got him. He wouldn’t come in with me. In fact, he acted like he didn’t aim to go nowhere right away. What’s he done this time?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ned	but I never heard him whisper about it.” “I didn’t know I was,” [MASK] said. “But suppose I was. What do you want to belong to a lodge for, unless it’s so secret cant hardly nobody else get in it?
<name>Casey</name>	Casey	Boon	“Why dont you go yourself?” [MASK] said. “It’s your railroad. I’m a stranger here.” “Why dont you take these boys on back home to bed, if you’re all that timid around strangers?”
<name>Boon</name>	Boon	Boon	When I looked back at [MASK], he was already dragging two poles, sapling-sized tree trunks, out of the weeds and briers. “Aint you going to use the block and tackle yet?” I said.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Boon	Which was perhaps why [MASK], still sitting, was able to reach suddenly and catch her arm before she could evade him, drawing her toward him, she struggling belatedly, as a girl that big would have to, still watching me. “Turn loose,” she said.
<name>Snopes</name>	Snopes	Ned	“Whyn’t you stop talking a minute and listen to me?” [MASK] said. “In course I knows where the man lives: didn’t I just trade a horse from him this evening? Let him alone. We dont want him yet.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Everbe	I want her with me. We’ll wait in the parlor while you make it up. Where is it?” But she had already located the ladies’ parlor, we following. ‘Where is he?” she said. “Where is who?” [MASK] said.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Otis	He crossed his knife and fork neatly and without haste on the steak he had barely cut into yet; he even folded his napkin and pushed it back through the ring and got up and said, “Excuse me, all,” and went out, looking at nobody, not even [MASK].
<name>Stevens</name>	Stevens	Akrum	“Me and that money was on [MASK].” "Oh,” I said. Then I said, “How much was it?” He didn’t move. I mean, he didn’t do anything.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Callie	For another second or two I still couldn’t be- lieve it. “Hurry up,” he said. “Any minute now [MASK] will come running out of that lane toting that baby under one arm and already yelling.”
<name>Woodward</name>	Woodward	Ned	“Well, we got to get him there first,” the conductor said, looking at his watch. “Who’s going to ride with him?” “Me,” [MASK] said. “Soon as I can find a box or something to climb up on.”
<name>Wolfe</name>	Wolfe	Butch	And I knew what that meant, what decision he had wrestled with and licked. But [MASK] fooled us; the confident angler was letting his fish have the backing too. “Sure,” he said. “Send back for us.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ned	And [MASK] was wrong. I mean about the increasing swarm of horse-race devotees we would be running into from now on. Maybe I had expected to find the entire hotel veranda lined with them, waiting for us and watching us arrive.
<name>Jody</name>	Jody	Ned	“You can learn how on this one.” He gave [MASK] the block and tackle and the piece of barbed wire. ‘Take it yonder to that willow, the big one, and get a good holt with it.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Minnie	“Stop running your mouth long enough to pour the gin, anyway.” [MASK] began to pour. Then she stopped, the bottle suspended. “What’s that hollering?” she said. Now we all heard it— a faint bawling from somewhere toward the back.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Boon	The automobile broke down. [MASK] fixed it. We never had time to get the gasoline and now I have to eat in a hurry and go back and help him fill the tank.” I went back to the dining room. Dinner was already on the table.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Boon	Maybe he’s changed his mind. Have you?” “Sir?” I said. “Yes sir. I mean, no sir.” “Well, which? Are you going to stay out here, or are you going back with [MASK]?”
<name>Jody</name>	Jody	Minnie	“I wanted that tooth a long time,” [MASK] said, “and I worked and saved to get it, extra work. I aint going to have it all messed up with no spit-mixed something to eat.”
<name>Snopes</name>	Snopes	Lycurgus	“Looking for two. We thought maybe the other one might be here too.” “You mean Mr van Tosch aint even come yet?” “He aint coming a-tall,” [MASK] said.
<name>Snopes</name>	Snopes	Ned	Then he said to me: “You too.” “Me?” I said. “But look at them mules,” [MASK] said. “He even got a log chain already hooked to that doubletree—” “Didn’t you hear me say shut up?”
<name>Stradlater</name>	Stradlater	Butch	He didn’t offer to put his arms around her again. He didn’t even touch her, really. He just patted her back; it looked almost as hard, his hand did, as insensitive and heavy, as when [MASK] had slapped his this afternoon.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Butch	“What did you say?” she said. “What he did that we’re going to admire him for. You didn’t tell us that. What did he do?” “You think that still trying to tear that—•” “[MASK],” I said.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Butch	“Yes sir,” I said. “All right,” he said. He turned. “Get in, boys,” he said. “What you going to do with the nigger?” [MASK] said.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Boon	They claim when he was a young squirt fifty-sixty years ago, he would a had one snatch at your drawers before he even tipped his hat.” “Come on,” [MASK] said. “You paid him?”
<name>Tom's</name>	Tom's	Sams	He had on a clean white shirt—either a new one, or he had managed somehow to get the other one washed. But almost at once things began to go too fast for anyone to learn yet that the new shirt was one of [MASK].
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Boon	He’s the one to be inviting you to get to hell back where you came from and take your goddamn horse along with you. Apologise.” “All right,” [MASK] said. “Forget it.” “You call that an apology?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Ned	“You all about ready for breakfast, aint you?” I could already smell it —the ham. “All I want is to go to sleep,” I said. “He’s been up all night,” [MASK] said. “Both of us.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Boon	I told him myself where I was going on that mule, and anybody there can tell him what time that train got in and how long it will take somebody to get back out there. Would you still be there if you had that tooth?” “All right,” [MASK] said.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Boon	“Wait,” [MASK] said. “Dont you want to see her?” You see, I was tired and my feet hurt. I was about worn out, and I needed sleep too. But more: I was dirty. I wanted fresh clothes.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Boon	The man didn’t move. “It’s six dollars,” he said. “Last year it was two dollars,” [MASK] said. “You said it’s double now. Double two is four. All right. Here’s four dollars.”
<name>Snopes</name>	Snopes	Ike	What you better do is go home and get your clean shirt and come straight back here and wait. I wont be long: just santer around the Square in case [MASK] wants to start asking questions too. Then we’ll be gone.” We closed the door.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Boss	[MASK] has got his automobile back and all he lost was four hundred and ninety-six dollars and it’s worth four hundred and ninety-six dollars not to own this horse. Because what in the world would we do with him, supposing they was to quit making them stinking little fishes?
<name>Lena</name>	Lena	Ned	he said. “Nothing,” [MASK] said. “Mind where you’re going and nemmine me. Nemmine me nohow. I got friends here too. You just show me where this automobile gonter be at tomorrow morning and I’ll be there too.”
<name>Flem</name>	Flem	Boon	[MASK] said, spitting, giving another terrific wrench and heave which sent us lurching forward, “about getting acquainted with automobiles? Exactly like horses and mules: dont never stand directly behind one that’s got one hind foot already lifted.” Then I saw the bridge.
