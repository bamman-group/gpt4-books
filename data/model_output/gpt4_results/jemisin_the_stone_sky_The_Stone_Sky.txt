<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Schaffa	“Yes. Thank you. Thank you, [MASK]!” He shakes his head, clearly rueful, though he smiles again. “Go to your father’s house and take anything useful and portable, little one. I’ll meet you there.” She hesitates.
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Nassun	“A price must be paid to use this method of transportation, as well.” “We don’t have any money or anything good to barter,” [MASK] says, troubled. “Fortunately, there are other ways to pay.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Lerna	“I didn’t...” You start to say, I didn’t mean to, and stop. Because you never mean it, and it never matters in the end. Watching your face, [MASK] lets out a small sigh.
<name>Rowan</name>	Rowan	Schaffa	He blinks and does so, in surprise. “I knew! And I wouldn’t have let you do the vines, [MASK]. It’s because of me that—” She falters then, her throat closing with impending tears. Some of this is just nerves and exhaustion.
<name>Earth</name>	Earth	Nassun	But remember, too: [MASK] wants it just as dead. So it says, in microshakes that will eventually stir a tsunami somewhere in the southern hemisphere, Hello, little enemy. (This is an approximation, you realize. This is all her young mind can bear.)
<name>Hope</name>	Hope	Schaffa	Just takes the kids away. Lot of us are starting to hope he never brings them back.” [MASK]. That’s the part you should focus on. That’s what matters, not what was but what is...
<name>Cardan</name>	Cardan	Steel	The moonlight has transformed [MASK] into a thing of starkest shadows, white and ink against the dimness of the garden. “I asked,” he says, and his voice is almost pleasant, “if you know what it feels like to live forever. Like me.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Hjarka	Two more forms resolve out of the swirl, both recognizable by their familiar shapes. One is male and slight, the other female and pillowy. The narrow one displaces [MASK] at your head and leans in to pull off the goggles that you hadn’t realized you were wearing.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Alabaster	If the scholar hadn’t been busy excavating what turned out to be an ancient lore cache, there would be nothing more to the story. [MASK] would have loved him and left him, perhaps with regret, more likely with no hard feelings.
<name>Rutherford</name>	Rutherford	Nassun	But while these imprints fossil all over the ceiling of the cavern, the solidified lava itself stops a few hundred feet above the ground. Belatedly, [MASK] realizes that the “tunnel” from which they emerged is also the remains of a building.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Nassun	He tries to answer [MASK], but his speech is halting when he does, and the look that crosses his face is pained, troubled, paler than usual. She therefore forces herself to ask these questions slowly, hours or days apart, to give him time to recover in between.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Nassun	That is strange and wrong and yet somehow unsurprising. As big as the world is, [MASK] is beginning to realize it’s also really small. The same stories, cycling around ard around. The same endings, again and again. The same mistakes eternally repeated.
<name>Sevro</name>	Sevro	Schaffa	You not telling me what would happen to [MASK]. So you could get rid of him.” The mountain that has been lingering nearby shifts slightly, to a position behind her. “I did try to warn you.” She turns to look at him.
<name>Essun</name>	Essun	Syen	I can still feel her—not sess, feel. There’s an obelisk here, I think it’s a spinel. When 1 canneck connect to it, it’s like 1 can feel anything they’re connected to. The amethyst is following [MASK].
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Rust	At least your smile hasn’t faltered. “Oh?” “Yeah. I think she’s the one who did it... [MASK], could’ve been any of ’em, though. That girl’s just the one who gave me the shivers the most.”
<name>Dave</name>	Dave	Earthfires	Even though the coincidence of this is almost too much to digest. The only thing stranger would be running into... the brother you actually forgot you had, until just now. What was his name? [MASK], you’ve forgotten that, too.
<name>Severus</name>	Severus	Gallat	Like us. We will have set her free... to struggle for survival along with everyone else. But that is better than the illusion of safety in a gilded cage, is it not? Better than you could ever have given her, I think at [MASK].
<name>mother</name>	mother	Nassun	No. Your [MASK] didn’t do this, she couldn’t have, she— She did. The young man sighs, reading your face. You’ve forgotten to smile, but even a Guardian would be sobered by this.
<name>Essun</name>	Essun	Nida	This impedes [MASK] only a little. She bulls forward, breaking the rock shards off and charging with them still jutting through her boots. One of her hands is held like a claw, the other a flat, finger-stiffened blade.
<name>Anathem</name>	Anathem	Nassun	Their speed continues to increase; presently these rings pass so quickly that they are just flashes. It takes three before [MASK] is able to discern what she’s seeing and sessing, and then only once she watches a ring as they pass it: windows.
<name>MASK</name>	MASK	Nassun	Something to hold on to, as one walks down into the depths. In a distant part of the grass forest that they just traversed, there is a high-pitched grating noise that [MASK] immediately identifies as animal. Chitinous, maybe.
<name>Ember</name>	Ember	Danel	You blow a stray ash flake off the baked potato. “They say,” [MASK] says, planting her hands on her knees and leaning forward, “that you know how to end this Season. That you’re going to be leaving soon to go somewhere and actually try.
<name>Aza</name>	Aza	Nassun	This is a thing you know already, but that [MASK] only learns in this moment. She sesses the meanings, hears the vibrations with the bones of her ears, shudders them out through her skin, feels them pull tears from her eyes.
<name>Lucifer</name>	Lucifer	Schaffa	Just as driven by love—you for her, and she for [MASK]. I love you both. How can I not, after all this? 1 am still human, after all, and this is a battle for the fate of the world.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Schaffa	Pointless, but I suppose it does no harm. They’ll run down again in a few months, without any source to provide additional power.” [MASK]’s voice is very soft and cold. “This could have killed her.”
<name>Ylva</name>	Ylva	Kelenli	She forgot with [MASK], though. Perhaps all humans think she is one of them, until someone tells them otherwise. What is that like, being treated as human when one is not? And then there’s the fact that they’ve left her alone with us.
<name>Worried</name>	Worried	Troubled	If I’m right, she’ll stop soon.” He sounds uncertain. No, not uncertain. [MASK]. You sit on a rocky outcrop some ways from the encampment, recovering from the... excision. It wasn’t as uncomfortable as you thought it would be.
<name>He</name>	He	Hoa	“I’ve lost him again, then,” you murmur. [MASK] doesn’t seem to move at first, but there’s a brief flit of wind against your side, and abruptly a hard hand nudges the back of your soft one.
<name>Keira</name>	Keira	Steel	Abruptly, [MASK] is in a different position, facing the archway that leads deeper into the station. “Go inside and provide power at the root. I’ll stay here and key in the start-up sequence once there’s enough power.” “What?
<name>Elara</name>	Elara	Kelenli	And somehow—I shiver, understanding instinctively but resisting because this contradicts everything I have learned from the laws of both physics and arcanity—somehow this structure is generating more energy than it consumes. I frown at [MASK], who’s watching me.
<name>Cheris</name>	Cheris	Nassun	she blurts, looking around at the vehimal’s walls. Maybe it was a coincidence. “Biomagestric storage surpluses permit—” The voice slips back into the old language, but [MASK] is certain she did not imagine hearing those oddly pronounced words of Sanze-mat.
<name>Ykka</name>	Ykka	Nassun	To clarify, I add, “With the end of the Seasons and the death of all the Guardians, it will now be possible for orogenes to conquer or eliminate stills, if they so choose. Previously, neither group could have survived without the other’s aid.” [MASK] gasps.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Kelenli	I reach up to touch her ankle, greatly daring, and she blinks and smiles at me, reaching down to cover my fingers with her hand. I will not understand my feelings for centuries afterward. The contact seems to strengthen [MASK].
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Kelenli	The guard laughs and calls over her companion to relay this question, as if it’s ridiculous. During the moment of distraction purchased for us by this exchange, [MASK] then resumes scrubbing me. “Why not laugh at it?” she says.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Nassun	His hands shake as he holds her close, but he doesn’t say anything, his relief palpable as he lets [MASK] flop against him. She’s suddenly so drained that only his grip holds her up. And in the meantime, something is coming along the track.
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Schaffa	She is reminded of the chambers in a wasp’s nest, except the shape is wrong. And in every one of them is a body. [MASK] isn’t far ahead. Somewhere in this room, no longer moving forward.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Schaffa	Her hands tighten in [MASK]’s shirt, trembling as her hatred wavers. Can she not empathize? For the world has taken so much from her. She had a brother once. And a father, and a mother whom she also understands but wishes she did not.
<name>your arm</name>	your arm	Lerna	You look away from them and involuntarily reach for the stump of your arm. This is irrational. You’re expecting battle wounds, scorch marks, something else to show that [MASK] was lost. But it’s fine. You’re fine.
<name>Essun</name>	Essun	Steel	[MASK] vanishes again. She doesn’t care. Other stone eaters periodically show up, however, or at least she feels the impact of their presence. She sleeps on the couch, and one morning wakes to find a blanket covering her.
<name>Essun</name>	Essun	Schaffa	“[MASK],” she says, about to ask for a break. “No,” he says, pushing over another tree with a grunt. “Remember the stone eater’s warning, little one. We must reach the center of this forest by dusk.
<name>Essun</name>	Essun	Schaffa	[MASK] shudders each time. She’s hurting him. She’s making it worse. There’s no other choice. She wraps her own threads around his corestone to perform the surgery he would not permit her to do a few months before.
<name>Nyx</name>	Nyx	Nassun	[MASK] can’t believe it, either, at first, but the silver does not lie. She notices something else strange as she expands her sesunal awareness of the area. The silver mirrors the per-turbations of topography and the forest here—the same way it does everywhere.
<name>June</name>	June	Danel	You inhale and start after her. “I have to help him.” You know what’s happening. You’ve felt it, feared it, all along. Behind you, you hear [MASK] stop the others. Maybe she thinks you and your daughter need space.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Kelenli	Yes, I’m sulking. [MASK] sighs and touches my shoulder. I flinch, unused to the warmth of another person’s hand, but she keeps it in place and this quiets me. “Think,” she repeats. “Does the Plutonic Engine work?
<name>Jackson</name>	Jackson	Gallat	My voice is soft, and hard to hear over the humming metabolic cycle of the vehimal. Few of the other conductors notice my comment. None of them care. I have timed the asking well. [MASK] starts, then stares at me as if he has never seen me before.
<name>Sebastian</name>	Sebastian	Lerna	“Nothing,” you say, waving a hand and setting the empty plate aside. “Just... shit. Come on, then, whoever’s coming.” Someone’s brought [MASK] his pack, which he dons quietly, watching you.
<name>Earthers</name>	Earthers	Equatorial	Two women argue over which of them gets to eat the last piece of dried fruit in their comm share. Two men, just beyond them, furtively exchange whispers while one passes over a small soft sponge—the kind [MASK] like to use for wiping after defecation.
<name>Emmett</name>	Emmett	Tonkee	“I feel heavy,” you say. “You’re alive,” he says, as if this is a completely reasonable response. No one is speaking a language you can understand today. “Motor skills sluggish. Cognition... ?” [MASK] leans in.
<name>Thrax</name>	Thrax	Rennanis	Ah, yes; there must have been a lot of wounded after [MASK]’s soldiers got into the geode. Well, you don’t need a fire, and you’re not hungry, so the others’ indifference doesn’t trouble you for the moment, except emotionally.
<name>Reeve</name>	Reeve	Castrima	She gestures over the camp. The people of the comm. “You’ve been with [MASK] for the better part of a year now. Got any friends?” You, you think, before you can stop yourself. “No,” you say.
<name>Garrett</name>	Garrett	Schaffa	“Why do the lights still work? That door we came through back there, why did it still work?” “I haven’t a clue, little one.” [MASK] now precedes her down the steps, on the theory that anything dangerous should encounter him first.
<name>Alabaster</name>	Alabaster	Innon	Respecting your boundaries, which are sharp-edged and hair-triggered. You never knew he was so observant, all these years—but then, you should’ve guessed. He figured out you were an orogene just by watching you, years ago. [MASK] would’ve liked him, you decide.
<name>Essun</name>	Essun	Nassun	Far away. Across the unknown sea. Her mother may hold the Obelisk Gate’s key, but [MASK] learned on the ash roads that there are other ways to open any gate—hinges to pop, ways to climb over or dig under.
<name>Meche</name>	Meche	Sanze	“Soldiers might get a comm through a Season, but storytellers are what kept [MASK] going through seven of them.” “Oh. Right.” She makes a palpable effort to not shake her head at Midlat-ter provincialism. “Anyway.
<name>Griffin</name>	Griffin	Schaffa	I’m sorry. * * * You make yourself say, “[MASK] won’t be coming back.” Because you need to find him and kill him—but even through your fear and horror, reason asserts itself.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Kelenli	Because of the direction that the window in my cell faces, I don’t get to see the Moon often. I want to savor its beauty while I can. “Why have you brought us here?” I ask [MASK], while still staring at it.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Remwha	“These things have been vetted by the conductors, if that matters to you.” She makes a show of eying [MASK] as she says this, since he was the one who made the biggest stink about having to go on this trip.
<name>Rowan</name>	Rowan	Tonkee	I know where she is, [MASK].” You try to raise your right hand to catch hers, and there is a sensation that thrums through your shoulder like aching and floating. You hear a ringing sound. It doesn’t hurt, but you privately curse yourself for forgetting.
<name>Emilia</name>	Emilia	Nassun	That must have been done sometime after the disaster—but how? And by whom? And why? Trying to understand what she’s seeing, [MASK] looks more closely at the cavern’s floor. The sand is mostly pale, though there are mottling patches of darker gray and brown laced throughout.
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Nassun	[MASK] stumbles forward, her breath catching. It’s him. Down the middle of the strange chamber stand contraptions, arranged in rows. Each consists of a chair attached to a complex arrangement of silver wire in loops and spars; she’s never seen anything like it.
<name>Ronja</name>	Ronja	Tonkee	You look at him, but then [MASK]—still chewing something and shouldering her pack with her good arm—grabs his upraised hand, though she pauses to blatantly stare at it in fascination. The moment passes. “So how’s this supposed to work?”
<name>Essun</name>	Essun	Nassun	The detritus of another person’s life is everywhere: pants much too big for her in the drawers, a man’s underwear beside them. (One day these are replaced with clothing that fits [MASK]. Another stone eater?
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Kelenli	The conductor seems pleased that I say “How do you do” when I’m supposed to. I’m glad; introduction is very difficult, but I’ve worked hard to become good at it. After this she starts speaking to [MASK].
<name>Emiko</name>	Emiko	Kelenli	“Yes. And yes, we’re going inside.” [MASK] pauses and looks back at him, perhaps surprised to realize that at least some of his reticence wasn’t an act. Through the ambient, I feel her touch him, reassure him.
<name>Darrow</name>	Darrow	Essie	You thought about destroying your enemies. You thought about surviving—but you couldn’t get beyond that. That’s why I’ve been so pissed at you, [MASK]. Months in my comm, and still all you are is ‘just a rogga.’ ”
<name>she</name>	she	Schaffa	She falls up through torrents of gray or green or mauve or clear white; parts of her that she has never known the words for move and adjust in a dance of twenty-seven parts. Oh, it is so lovely! If only [MASK] could— Wait.
<name>Lucifer</name>	Lucifer	Earth	She’s aware of it, you know somehow. She made this choice. She is prepared for the inevitability of her own death. You aren’t. Oh, [MASK], you just can’t watch another of your children die. So... you give up.
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Steel	“Yet even now it may be willing to compromise, to forgive. It demands justice, but—” “It has had its justice a thousand times over,” says [MASK]. “I owe it no more.” Then he opens his mouth wide.
<name>Corey</name>	Corey	Schaffa	Here at Corepoint, she can do it without even the onyx, but start-up will take time. ‘“A commandment is set in stone,’” she tells [MASK] solemnly. His eyes are open again.
<name>Azrael</name>	Azrael	Steel	By the time she focuses on him again, [MASK]’s smile has vanished. “I cannot stop you, once you’ve opened the Gate,” he says. “I’ve manipulated you, yes, but the choice is still ultimately yours.
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Kelenli	He and I have never much liked one another, but... I shake my head and focus on what [MASK] has asked me. “A legacy is something obsolete, but which you cannot get rid of entirely. Something no longer wanted, but still needed.”
<name>Emilia</name>	Emilia	Kelenli	He stands frowning, tilting his head from one side to the other. “What is—” I start to ask, but then I hear? sess? it too. “I’ll show you,” says [MASK]. She leads us deeper into the boxy building.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Pheylen	But I allow myself to look like I don’t understand as I wonder if we dare trust her. I saw how the conductor relaxed around her. [MASK] is one of the nice ones, but even she never forgets what we are.
<name>Alabaster</name>	Alabaster	Steel	[MASK] ignores them both. One of the stone eater’s hands is upraised toward the strange floating thing, like a proud artist displaying his latest creation. He says, “You gave the system rather more power than absolutely necessary.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Kelenli	He lets the ones who need it use [MASK]’s small toilet or a pile of leaves out back (I am one of these; it is very strange to squat, but also a profoundly enriching experience), then tells us to ignore our hunger and thirst and come on, so we do.
<name>Alanna</name>	Alanna	Nassun	He’s speaking faster, words tumbling over one another. There is an oddness to the way his eyes dart around the vehimal interior that makes [MASK] suspect he’s seeing things that aren’t there. Trying to conceal her anxiety, she reaches out and pats the shell-chair beside her.
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Remwha	Multiple tones, blending and haunting and making the little hairs on the back of my neck rise... I look at [MASK], who nods, his expression tight. This engine’s magics have no purpose that I can see, other than to look and sound and be beautiful.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Nassun	The hand that you don’t have twinges again, but it is more tentative this time and not the throb of before. Because... he wouldn’t have had to break [MASK]’s hand, would he? No, no, no. You did that to her yourself.
<name>Wax</name>	Wax	Tonkee	“I hate this damn Season. I have to be so rusting practical now.” You’re surprised into a chuckle, but: it’s weak. The questions [MASK]’s raised are good ones, of course, and some of them you can’t answer.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Nassun	He truly does love you; never doubt that about him.” [MASK] swallows back a dull ache. “But he also needs you. You keep him happy. You keep him human, where otherwise time would have long since transformed him into something else.”
<name>Blackwood</name>	Blackwood	Gallat	We are the machine’s tuners; we ourselves must be attuned for the good of the project. That this process sometimes causes pain or fear or decommissioning to the briar patch is... incidental. We have wondered if [MASK] has feelings himself.
<name>Alabaster</name>	Alabaster	Guardians	No. “Yes?” He bites his lip. “What’s going on? It feels like...Nothing that’s happening is normal lately. I mean, it’s a Season, but even that feels wrong. [MASK] not taking roggas to the Fulcrum.
<name>Emmett</name>	Emmett	Tonkee	[MASK]’s head pokes into view as they start to carry you along. “Hey, it’ll be all right. Lots of people hate me.” That is entirely unreassuring. It’s also frustrating that you care, and that others can tell you care.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Schaffa	Say you won’t hurt [MASK] again! Even though it feels wrong to yell at any adult. Yet she has also spent the past year and a half learning that adults are people, and sometimes they are wrong, and sometimes somebody should yell at them.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Lerna	“[MASK].” That last jolt. The one you thought was a near miss. It isn’t what should have happened. You’re the one nobly sacrificing yourself for the future of the world. He was supposed to survive this. “What about him?”
<name>Atchison</name>	Atchison	Lerna	Nor does she like that four of his people have other serious medical issues, ranging from fistulas to the complete lack of teeth, or that [MASK] says they’re all going to be touch and go on surviving refeeding.
<name>He</name>	He	Lerna	“How long has it been since you last menstruated?” “How—” You stop talking. Shit. Shit. In your silence, [MASK] sighs and leans his head back against the wall. You try to make excuses in your own head.
<name>She</name>	She	Ykka	She looks around the lobby, taking you in along with the rest, and puts her hands on her hips. “Catch you rusters at a bad time?” “You can’t,” you blurt. It’s hard to talk. Knot in your throat. [MASK] especially; you stare at her.
<name>Nona</name>	Nona	Nassun	The core of the world is metal, molten and yet crushed into solidity. There is some malleability to it. The surface of the red darkness begins to ripple and change as [MASK] watches. Something appears that for an instant she cannot parse. A pattern, familiar.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Nassun	He stands over [MASK] for several minutes, perhaps expecting her to lift her gaze and notice him, but she does not. Presently, he says, “The ocean winds can be cold at night.” Silence.
<name>Jackson</name>	Jackson	A	Too power-fid, can’t risk it, would trigger alignment too quickly and then who’s to make the second traj change?) But the rasters that buildt it put everything into tht stupid hole. [MASK] told me some of it. Great project, my ass.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Hoa	Why do you bother with me, then? I’m not as—easy a meal as those.” “Lesser members of my kind need to strengthen themselves. I don’t.” There is a very slight shift in the inflection of [MASK]’s voice.
<name>Orpheus</name>	Orpheus	Hoa	“Yes, very well.” So easy to smile. Harder to wrestle down the urge to scream, to grab [MASK], to demand that he plunge you both into the earth now, now, now, so you can go and rescue your daughter.
<name>He</name>	He	Rust	It wasn’t her. [MASK] knows what I was thinking... But I wanted to search them all. Before the Season.” He utters a ragged, bitter chuckle. “I didn’t even like her. Just needed to know.” You shake your head.
<name>She</name>	She	Ykka	Remember?” [MASK] blinks, and then a slow smile spreads across her face. “You were in a coma or something. I drank it all myself.” You glare at her, surprised to find yourself honestly annoyed. She laughs in your face.
<name>Ysengrin</name>	Ysengrin	Gaewha	[MASK], Antimony, whoever and whatever she is now, replies, “I noticed.” She pauses. “Do you regret what you did?” It’s a foolish question. All of us regret that day, in different ways and for different reasons.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Syen	And we did make a beautiful child in spite of everything, didn’t we? My boy. I won’t let them find your boy, [MASK]. I won’t let them take him, and bum his brain, and put him in the wire chair.
<name>Severus</name>	Severus	Nassun	He stays there after the kiss, nose pressed into her hair; [MASK] makes a mighty effort and does not burst into tears. When he speaks at last, the horrible blurriness has faded, as have even some of the pain-lines around his eyes.
<name>Guardians</name>	Guardians	Schaffa	She can feel it as the paltry thin silver that runs through her own body resonates—but that is a faint resonance, from her silver, generated by her own flesh. The silver in [MASK], in all Guardians, is generated by the corestone that sits lodged in their sessapinae.
<name>Thalia</name>	Thalia	Nassun	[MASK] sesses impending change an instant before the tunnel suddenly brightens. They can see a new, ruddy light that intersperses the rock walls of the tunnel. Ah, yes; they’ve gone far enough down that some of the rock has melted and glows bright red.
