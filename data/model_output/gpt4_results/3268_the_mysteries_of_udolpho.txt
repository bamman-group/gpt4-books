<name>Wolfgang</name>	Wolfgang	Pierre	The man made no reply, and the Count continued to listen, and then added, 'That is no common musician; he touches the instrument with a delicate hand; who is it, [MASK]?' 'My lord!' said the man, hesitatingly.
<name>Mrs. Bagnet</name>	Mrs. Bagnet	Emily	exclaimed [MASK], 'does he live?' 'Yes, ma'am, but--but he has a terrible wound, and could not come to let me out. They thought him dead, at first, and he has not been rightly himself, till within this hour.'
<name>Belville</name>	Belville	Montoni	'Well, well, niece, I will not dispute with you. But, as I said, [MASK] threatens me with violence, if I any longer refuse to sign away my settlements, and this was the subject of our contest, when you came into the room before.
<name>Camilla</name>	Camilla	Emily	I am willing, in consideration of my poor brother, to overlook the impropriety of your late conduct, and to try what your future will be.' [MASK] interrupted her, to beg she would explain what was the impropriety she alluded to. 'What impropriety!
<name>Albert</name>	Albert	Valancourt	She passed a melancholy evening, during which the retrospect of all that had happened, since she had seen [MASK], would rise to her imagination; and the scene of her father's death appeared in tints as fresh, as if it had passed on the preceding day.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Cavigni	I will contradict the report wherever I go;' as she said which, she turned her attention upon another part of the company; and [MASK], who had hitherto appeared a grave spectator of the scene, now fearing he should be unable to smother the laugh, that convulsed him, walked abruptly away.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Emily	[MASK] sat by her father, holding his hand, and, while she listened to the old man, her heart swelled with the affectionate sympathy he described, and her tears fell to the mournful consideration, that death would probably soon deprive her of the dearest blessing she then possessed.
<name>Henri</name>	Henri	Emily	said [MASK]: 'whoever it was, I shall consider him as mine also.' 'Ah, mademoiselle! that friend forbad me to blazon the good deed--I must not say, who it was. But how you are altered since I saw you last!
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emily	[MASK] would have pursued this train of thinking, because it relieved her from more painful reflection, but she found again, that thought cannot always be controlled by will; and hers returned to the consideration of her own situation.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Emily	He was received with reserve by [MASK], and with pleasure by the Count, who presented him to her with a smile, that seemed intended to plead his cause, and who did not hope the less for his friend, from the embarrassment she betrayed.
<name>Valancourt</name>	Valancourt	Valancourt	She sat down by the casement, breathless, and overcome with the alternate emotions of hope and fear; then rose again, leaned from the window, that she might catch a nearer sound, listened, now doubting and then believing, softly exclaimed the name of [MASK], and then sunk again into the chair.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Emily	Whether it was the freshness of the air, that revived [MASK], or that the objects she now saw roused the spirit of alarm, she suddenly spoke, and made an ineffectual effort to disengage herself from the grasp of the ruffians, who held her.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Emily	[MASK] continued to gaze, for some time, on the way it had passed, and then retired within her chamber, musing on this strange circumstance, and scarcely doubting, that she had witnessed a supernatural appearance. When her spirits recovered composure, she looked round for some other explanation.
<name>Laurette</name>	Laurette	Emily	Look up, my dear [MASK], we shall meet again!' He lifted his eyes towards heaven, and a gleam of moon-light, which fell upon his countenance, discovered peace and resignation, stealing on the lines of sorrow.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Emily	This was not the moment, in which [MASK] could bear the remark; her tears fell again, and, as soon as she had taken the coffee, she retired to her apartment, where she endeavoured to repose her fatigued spirits.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Emily	said [MASK], eagerly, 'O! then I have little to hope!' 'That is the very place, ma'am. But cheer up, and do not take it so much to heart, and think what a little time you have to get ready in, and how impatient the Signor is.
<name>Montoni</name>	Montoni	Emily	My dear sir,' said [MASK], timidly, 'what mean those tears?--they speak, I fear, another language--they plead for me.' 'They are weak tears, for they are useless ones,' replied the Count, drying them, 'I would have you superior to such weakness.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Emily	[MASK] smiled through her tears upon her father: 'Dear sir,' said she, and her voice trembled; she would have added, 'I will shew myself worthy of being your daughter;' but a mingled emotion of gratitude, affection, and grief overcame her.
<name>Ellena</name>	Ellena	Valancourt	These were moments, when it was impossible for her to feel emotions of regret, or melancholy, for any ordinary interests;--even the reflection, that she had resigned the estates, which would have been a provision for herself and [MASK] for life, threw only a light and transient shade upon her spirits.
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Emily	[MASK] looked anxiously from the window, and saw a peasant walking at some little distance on the road, for whom they waited, till he came up, when he was asked, if there was any house in the neighbourhood that accommodated travellers.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Emily	what is it I see?' and then, trembling, sat down in a chair, that stood by the table. 'What is it you do see?' said [MASK], alarmed by her manner, and looking round the room. '
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Emily	The hollow moan struck upon [MASK]'s heart, and served to render more gloomy and terrific every object around her,--the mountains, shaded in twilight--the gleaming torrent, hoarsely roaring--the black forests, and the deep glen, broken into rocky recesses, high overshadowed by cypress and sycamore and winding into long obscurity.
<name>Adeline</name>	Adeline	Emily	'I perceive,' said [MASK], smiling, 'that all old mansions are haunted; I am lately come from a place of wonders; but unluckily, since I left it, I have heard almost all of them explained.'
<name>Valentine</name>	Valentine	Emily	After listening to this narrative, the Count retired to his closet, where he remained alone for several hours; and, when he again appeared, the solemnity of his manner surprised and alarmed [MASK], but she gave no utterance to her thoughts.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Valancourt	I have besides particular reasons for believing the report to be erroneous.' 'I cannot doubt the truth of it,' replied the lady gravely, disgusted by the abrupt contradiction she had received, concerning her opinion of [MASK]'s merit. '
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emily	Judging of [MASK]'s disposition from her own, and from a consciousness of what her treatment of her deserved, she had believed, that her griefs would be cause of triumph to her niece, rather than of sympathy; that she would despise, not pity her.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emily	I must be contented to understand only common sense, and happy would it have been for you and your father, if that had been included in his education.' [MASK] was too much shocked by these reflections on her father's memory, to despise this speech as it deserved.
<name>Edmund</name>	Edmund	Annette	She would have sent [MASK] to the portal to hasten him, but feared to be left alone, for it was now almost dark, and a melancholy streak of red, that still lingered in the west, was the only vestige of departed day.
<name>Henrietta</name>	Henrietta	Emily	She repeated her 'farewell,' and attempted to withdraw her hand, but he still held it and bathed it with his tears. 'Why prolong these moments?' said [MASK], in a voice scarcely audible, 'they are too painful to us both.'
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Annette	She had continued thus for a considerable time, when, amidst the uproar of the storm, she thought she heard a voice, and, raising herself to listen, saw the chamber door open, and [MASK] enter with a countenance of wild affright. '
<name>Edmund</name>	Edmund	Valancourt	She looked in vain to [MASK], confined by his profession to a distant kingdom, as her protector; but it gave her comfort to know, that there was, at least, one person in the world, who would sympathize in her afflictions, and whose wishes would fly eagerly to release her.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Emily	He now walked on quickly, and [MASK], proceeding with difficulty over the obscured and uneven ground, was left at some distance, till her voice arrested him, who seemed unwilling to stop, and still hurried on. '
<name>Camilla</name>	Camilla	Emily	[MASK], having looked for a moment on this sprightly band, turned away, unable to bear the remembrances it excited; but where, alas! could she turn, and not meet new objects to give acuteness to grief?
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Emily	He went out, soon after, to give some further orders to his people, and [MASK] then enquired the occasion of this hasty journey; but her aunt appeared to be as ignorant as herself, and to undertake the journey with more reluctance.
<name>John</name>	John	Jean	It was not I that saw him, madam, it was [MASK] the gardener. It was twelve o'clock at night, and, as he was coming across the court to go the back way into the house, what should he see--but somebody walking in the avenue, that fronts the garden gate!
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Emily	Having reached this headland, [MASK] gazed with solemn pleasure on the cliffs, that extended on either hand along the sequestered shores, some crowned with groves of pine, and others exhibiting only barren precipices of grayish marble, except where the crags were tufted with myrtle and other aromatic shrubs.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Montoni	Thus the hours passed in solitude, in silence, and in anxious conjecturing. Being not once disturbed by a message, or a sound, it appeared, that [MASK] had wholly forgotten her, and it gave her some comfort to find, that she could be so unnoticed.
<name>Valancourt</name>	Valancourt	Valancourt	The distress she felt, on her return towards the place of her former sufferings, was, however, softened by a conjecture, that [MASK] was there, and she found some degree of comfort in the thought of being near him, notwithstanding the consideration, that he was probably a prisoner.
<name>Heaven</name>	Heaven	Montoni	Such a strange circumstance, too, and to be obliged to conceal it, was a severe punishment; but she knew, that [MASK] might impose one much severer, and she feared to incur it by offending him.
<name>Signor</name>	Signor	Emily	No, no, I do know better than to do so; though, if the Signor can sleep sound, nobody else in the castle has any right to lie awake, I am sure.' [MASK] did not appear to notice this remark.
<name>Annette</name>	Annette	Annette	After a long pause, 'No, ma'amselle,' said [MASK], 'it was only the wind in the gallery; I often hear it, when it shakes the old doors, at the other end. But won't you go to bed, ma'amselle?
<name>Adeline</name>	Adeline	Emily	At the tremulous accents of her voice, his eyes softened instantly from wildness into tenderness. 'You are ill, [MASK],' said he, 'they will destroy us both! Forgive me, that I dared to doubt your affection.'
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	Valancourt	[MASK] was introduced to her parties by two of his brother officers, whose late ridicule he had now forgiven so far, that he could sometimes join in the laugh, which a mention of his former manners would renew.
<name>Montoni</name>	Montoni	Montoni	Those dark hints of the Italian spoke much, but not more than the idea I have of [MASK]'s disposition, as exhibited even in his countenance. I think I see at this moment all that could have been hinted, written there.
<name>Traddles</name>	Traddles	Emily	Why is it so, my dear sir?' said [MASK], in a voice of timid curiosity. He made no reply, but sunk again into a reverie; and in a few moments, when he seemed to have recovered himself, asked who had succeeded to the estates.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Emily	[MASK] too was affected, but her feelings had more of solemnity, and less of fear. From the silence, into which reflection and expectation had thrown them, they, at length, roused themselves, and left the chamber.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Emily	[MASK] long watched the playing lustre, listened to the soothing murmur of the current, and the yet lighter sounds of the air, as it stirred, at intervals, the lofty palm-trees. 'How delightful is the sweet breath of these groves,' said she. '
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Emily	The ruffians paused, and looked upon each other. Between the boles of the trees, the blue lightning flashed and quivered along the ground, while, as [MASK] looked under the boughs, the mountains beyond, frequently appeared to be clothed in livid flame.
<name>Edmund</name>	Edmund	Valancourt	Let me seal it as the most sacred of my life!' He pressed her hand to his lips, it was cold and trembling; and, raising her eyes, he saw the paleness of her countenance. Tears came to her relief, and [MASK] watched in anxious silence over her.
<name>Beppo</name>	Beppo	Bertrand	I would we were well in the Signor's castle!' said [MASK], 'I know not why he should send us on this business. Hark! how it rattles above, there! I could almost find in my heart to turn priest, and pray.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Emily	They were received by the Count with his usual benignity, who, though [MASK] wished to have proceeded immediately to the monastery of St. Claire, would not allow her to leave the chateau, that night; and, indeed, the terror and fatigue she had suffered would scarcely have permitted her to go farther.
<name>Udolpho</name>	Udolpho	Barnardine	She then considered, that it would be vain to attempt an escape from [MASK], by flight, since the length and the intricacy of the way she had passed would soon enable him to overtake her, who was unacquainted with the turnings, and whose feebleness would not suffer her to run long with swiftness.
<name>Annette</name>	Annette	Annette	Long fits of abstraction succeeded; [MASK] spoke repeatedly, but her voice seemed not to make any impression on the sense of the long agitated Emily, who sat fixed and silent, except that, now and then, she heaved a heavy sigh, but without tears.
<name>Waverley</name>	Waverley	Valancourt	'I cannot excuse myself,' said [MASK], 'but I will forbear to renew the subject, which may have contributed to agitate them, now that I can leave you with the sweet certainty of possessing your esteem.'
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Emily	Your generosity will pardon the theft, and restore the prize. My crime has been my punishment; for the portrait I stole has contributed to nourish a passion, which must still be my torment.' [MASK] now interrupted him. '
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Emily	When he rose, a ghastly paleness was on his countenance. [MASK] was hastily retiring; but she saw him turn again to the papers, and she stopped. He took from among them a small case, and from thence a miniature picture.
<name>Laurette</name>	Laurette	Annette	You would not believe about the ghost I told you of, though I shewed you the very place, where it used to appear!--You will believe nothing, ma'amselle.' 'Not till you speak more reasonably, [MASK]; for Heaven's sake, explain your meaning.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Emily	The men then dismounted, and, having assisted [MASK], led the mules towards the woods, that skirted the glen, on the left, over broken ground, frequently interrupted with brush-wood and wild plants, which she was often obliged to make a circuit to avoid.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Emily	I thought, once or twice, I should have dropped, as I was a-coming.' [MASK] seated her in a chair, and desired, that she would compose her spirits, before she entered upon the subject, that had brought her thither. '
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Emily	[MASK], overcome by the sudden shock she had received, at the moment, too, when she had begun to hope for better days, now thought she saw destruction surround her on every side. Unable to reply, and almost to think, she threw herself into a chair, pale and breathless.
<name>Delvile</name>	Delvile	Montoni	Yet she determined not to give him unavailing pain by relating the reasons she had to regret the having rejected his better judgment concerning [MASK]; reasons, however, which could not induce her to lament the delicacy and disinterested affection that had made her reject his proposal for a clandestine marriage.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Ugo	[A. R.]) 'Aye,' said [MASK], 'you are not one of those, that believe in omens: we have left cowards at the castle, who would turn pale at such a sight.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Emily	At the sound of his voice, [MASK] turned her eyes, and a gleam of recollection seemed to shoot athwart her mind, for she immediately rose from her seat, and moved slowly to a remote part of the room.
<name>Osbert</name>	Osbert	Carlo	[MASK] was then summoned, and ordered to conduct the strangers to a part of the castle, which, in former times, had been occupied by the upper servants of the family, and to provide them with every necessary refreshment.--When he had done this, he was bidden to return to his master.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Emily	The holy father began the service, and [MASK] again commanded her feelings, till the coffin was let down, and she heard the earth rattle on its lid. Then, as she shuddered, a groan burst from her heart, and she leaned for support on the person who stood next to her.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Emily	You are not unworthy of these estates, niece,' said she: 'I would wish to keep them for your sake--you shew a virtue I did not expect.' 'How have I deserved this reproof, madam?' said [MASK] sorrowfully.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Emily	His open declaration, that he would only conditionally protect her, while she remained a prisoner in the castle, shewed [MASK] the necessity of an immediate compliance with his terms; but she first demanded, whether he would permit her immediately to depart, if she gave up her claim to the contested estates.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Montoni	The choice of this person he entrusted to the fellow's own discernment, and not imprudently; for he discovered a man, whom [MASK] had, on some former occasion, treated harshly, and who was now ready to betray him.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Bertrand	The path was often strewn with broken heads of arrows, and with shattered remains of armour, such as at that period was mingled with the lighter dress of the soldiers. 'Bring the light hither,' said [MASK], 'I have stumbled over something, that rattles loud enough.'
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Ludovico	[MASK], having finished this story, laid aside the book, for he felt drowsy, and, after putting more wood on the fire and taking another glass of wine, he reposed himself in the arm-chair on the hearth.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Emily	I am a wretch, but I will be a villain no longer.--I will not endeavour to shake your resolution by the pleadings of a selfish passion. I resign you, [MASK], and will endeavour to find consolation in considering, that, though I am miserable, you, at least, may be happy.
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Emily	It was open upon the table, before her, among some loose drawings, having, with them, been taken out of a little box by [MASK], some hours before. The sight of it called up many interesting reflections, but the melancholy sweetness of the countenance soothed the emotions, which these had occasioned.
<name>Clavering</name>	Clavering	Montoni	'Judging as I do,' resumed [MASK], 'I cannot believe you will oppose, where you know you cannot conquer, or, indeed, that you would wish to conquer, or be avaricious of any property, when you have not justice on your side.
<name>Valancourt</name>	Valancourt	Valancourt	She was awakened from her musing by the sound of horses' feet along a road, that wound under the windows of the pavilion, and a gentleman passed on horseback, whose resemblance to [MASK], in air and figure, for the twilight did not permit a view of his features, immediately struck her.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Montoni	Suffer her to be removed from that forlorn room to her own apartment, and to have necessary comforts administered.' 'Of what service will that be, if she is dying?' said [MASK], with apparent indifference.
<name>Collins</name>	Collins	COLLINS	CHAPTER V Dark power! with shudd'ring, meek submitted thought Be mine to read the visions old Which thy awak'ning bards have told, And, lest they meet my blasted view, Hold each strange tale devoutly true. [MASK]' ODE TO FEAR
<name>Laurence</name>	Laurence	Annette	'The night before last, you know, madam'-- 'I know nothing, [MASK],' replied her lady in a more hurried voice. 'The night before last, madam, there was a robber in the garden.' 'A robber!'
<name>Valancourt</name>	Valancourt	Valancourt	She was, at length, roused by the voice of the Countess in the garden, and, her attention being then awakened, the first object, which struck her sight, was the vacant chair, where [MASK] had sat.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Annette	Tell him,' said she, 'if he has any thing of consequence to impart, I will hear him in the corridor, whenever he has an opportunity of coming thither.' [MASK] went to deliver this message, and was absent a considerable time.
<name>Signor</name>	Signor	Ludovico	And [MASK] says (but pray be secret, ma'am) that his excellenza introduced her only to impose upon the world, that had begun to make free with her character. So when people saw my lady notice her, they thought what they had heard must be scandal.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Emily	'--'I must believe so, sir,' replied [MASK]. 'But let us rest under these trees,' said the Count, observing the paleness of her countenance; 'here is a seat--you are fatigued.' They sat down, and the Count proceeded. '
<name>Solitude</name>	Solitude	Solitude	Towards evening, they wound down precipices, black with forests of cypress, pine and cedar, into a glen so savage and secluded, that, if [MASK] ever had local habitation, this might have been 'her place of dearest residence.' To
<name>Endymion</name>	Endymion	Montoni	The servants were now summoned, and the chamber was searched, but no person was found. The surprise and consternation of the company increased. [MASK] was discomposed. 'We will leave this room,' said he, 'and the subject of our conversation also; it is too solemn.'
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Emily	He made no reply, but sat with his arms rested on the table and his face concealed by his hands; while [MASK] stood, silent and trembling, wretched for herself and dreading to leave him in this state of mind. 'O excess of misery!'
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Emily	My dear master is a saint above.' [MASK] took the handkerchief from her face, and raised her eyes full of tears towards heaven; soon after she dried them, and, in a calm, but tremulous voice, began to enquire concerning some of her late father's pensioners.
<name>Cecilia</name>	Cecilia	Emily	He assures me, that your interview was not preconcerted.' 'Dear madam!' said [MASK] in extreme emotion, 'you surely did not ask him the question!' 'Most certainly I did; you could not suppose I should be so imprudent as to neglect it.'
<name>Julie</name>	Julie	Emily	Do you believe, monsieur, that we shall be permitted to revisit the earth, after we have quitted the body?' [MASK] could no longer stifle the anguish of her heart; her tears fell fast upon her father's hand, which she yet held.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Emily	She now almost resolved to throw herself in his way, but terror checked the intention, and this day passed, as the preceding one, with [MASK], except that a degree of awful expectation, concerning the approaching night, now somewhat disturbed the dreadful calmness that had pervaded her mind.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Montoni	And, when [MASK] absolutely refused it, her slumbering mind was roused. 'I can no longer remain here with propriety, sir,' said she, 'and I may be allowed to ask, by what right you detain me.'
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Ludovico	[[MASK] started, and laid down the book, for he thought he heard a voice in the chamber, and he looked toward the bed, where, however, he saw only the dark curtains and the pall.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Annette	I little thought I was coming to be catched up in a old castle, among such dreary mountains, with the chance of being murdered, or, what is as good, having my throat cut!' 'What can all this mean, indeed, [MASK]?
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Theresa	'What! is my dear young master going out in all this rain!' said [MASK]. 'No, he shall not stir a step. Dear! dear! to see how gentlefolks can afford to throw away their happiness!
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Emily	Meanwhile, [MASK] had been listening with deep attention to the discussion of what was to her a very interesting question, and, remembering the appearance she had witnessed in the apartment of the late Marchioness, she was frequently chilled with awe.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Emily	Would you not otherwise be willing to hope for my reformation--and could you bear, by estranging me from you, to abandon me to misery--to myself!'--Emily wept aloud.--'No, [MASK]--no--you would not do this, if you still loved me.
<name>Clarence</name>	Clarence	Valancourt	[MASK] was a stranger to the gradual progress of scheme and intrigue, against which he could not be on his guard. He had not been accustomed to receive ridicule, and he could ill endure its sting; he resented it, and this only drew upon him a louder laugh.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Montoni	Yet here is no person in the room but ourselves!' 'This is very extraordinary,' said [MASK], suddenly rising. 'This is not to be borne; here is some deception, some trick. I will know what it means.'
<name>Osborne</name>	Osborne	Emily	Strange stories, too, have long been told of this castle, but it is no business of mine to repeat them; and, for my part, I have no reason to complain; our Chief does nobly by us.' 'I commend your prudence,' said [MASK]. '
<name>Brigida</name>	Brigida	Ludovico	'I soon found out, madam,' resumed [MASK], 'that they were pirates, who had, during many years, secreted their spoil in the vaults of the castle, which, being so near the sea, suited their purpose well.
<name>Delvile</name>	Delvile	Emily	'--'What is the danger you apprehend, sir?' said [MASK]; 'if I can prevent it, you may safely confide in my honour.'--'On your honour I am certain I can rely,' said the Count; 'but can I trust your fortitude?
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Valancourt	Sometimes you will think of the unhappy [MASK], and it will be with pity, though it may not be with esteem. O! what is the whole world to me, without you--without your esteem!' He checked himself--'I am falling again into the error I have just lamented.
