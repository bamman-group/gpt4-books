<name>the Queen</name>	the Queen	Sonny	Your presence at the concert, where you and [MASK] will of course be honored guests, will make this celebration and commemoration of my brother’s life and genius complete in every respect. Please let me hear from you soon. Sincerely, From around the block.
<name>Chandler</name>	Chandler	Hattie	“And?” [MASK] was seated across from him on the sofa. A coffee table lay between them and a good five feet of floor space. “And after a while I found I wasn’t forcing myself anymore. I was listening because I wanted to.
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Hattie	“Hey, [MASK], I figured you’d be here. So what’d you think?” As always asking her opinion as if it was the one he trusted most and the only one that mattered. “You went on some,” she said.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Hattie	Then, bending down to hug him from behind, [MASK] repeated the instructions she’d given him earlier: if there was a problem or he didn’t like it or if anything happened to upset or frighten him he was to phone her and she’d come get him right away.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Hattie	It happened from time to time. Too much Pfere Magloire, and [MASK] was letting her have it but good. Except that she was speaking English. So was the voice opposing hers, which was nowhere as loud. And it was a man’s voice.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Hattie	([MASK] had insisted that he wear one of his new suits.) “And why’ve you got a book under your arm? We’re gonna be playing! And why didn’t you come on Friday when you were supposed to? We were disappointed.”
<name>his</name>	his	Hattie	There were at least three or four times as many creams, lotions, powders, and colognes on her dressing table as on [MASK]’s at home, he noted; and the bedroom reflected in the mirror was at least twice the size of their entire deux pieces sans confort.
<name>her</name>	her	JoJo	He wrote once asking me to take [MASK].” What’re you talking about?” Her voice fallen to a whisper again, she sank back down on the sofa. “It was about a year before we heard he had died, when things must’ve been really going downhill for him.
<name>She</name>	She	Hattie	No response. [MASK] unable to move or speak or even breathe. As for the job she was so eager to return to. The Club Violette. It wasn’t much of a job from what he had learned. And the kinds of things that went on there.
<name>Architectural Digest</name>	Architectural Digest	Hattie	Toys, games, and books that looked practically new, as well as used, expensive magazines for Big People like [MASK]. He had borrowed the one book so often, they finally made him a present of it. Once it was his, he set about drawing the castles and fortresses inside.
<name>He</name>	He	Hattie	“Could somebody please tell me what I’m doing back here? How I could’ve let myself be talked into coming near this place again?” [MASK] upset. He started to remind her of the reason for the trip. The concert. His grandfather.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	m’sieur	And he and his best friend from school weren’t only watching it, they were inside it, on the screen, the two of them changed into a pair of knights astride their mounts, on their way to an adventure somewhere. “Okay then, [MASK], tell me what I was talking about?”
<name>Aunt Alexandra</name>	Aunt Alexandra	Hattie	He could suddenly, without hesitating a second, say it to himself as well as out loud. He nevertheless couldn’t bring himself to look at his uncle right away, so he turned to [MASK]. He had expected to see her smiling proudly down at him.
<name>He</name>	He	Hattie	[MASK] appeared equally impressed. Holding on to him, the woman seated herself on a camel-back sofa that sat like a throne at the front of the room, facing everything there. Behind it, a triptych of windows looked down on her perfect yard and the tree in summer leaf.
<name>Paris</name>	Paris	JoJo	The spring rains were just about over, the sky a clear washed cerulean, le Jardin des Plantes in glorious bloom and the chestnut trees lining the fashionable boulevards decked out in blossoms the shape of miniature Christmas trees. [MASK].
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Kendall	“I thought I’d let her surprise you,” his uncle said. “[MASK]’s just started taking French. Maybe you can give her some pointers later on.” Her American accent. That’s the first thing he’d tell her about.
<name>Marge</name>	Marge	Hattie	This was where he had to walk to school, the boy, through dangerous streets such as these, and to a school that according to his information had one of the lowest ratings in the city. “That’s no place to raise him, [MASK].
<name>Madonna</name>	Madonna	Hattie	“Europhoria!” ended and [MASK] resumed her place at the lectern, the overhead spot igniting small silver fires in the beadwork on her gown. She expanded on the theme of the tune: the sheer euphoria of those early years.
<name>responded</name>	responded	Edgar	He was too overwhelmed to look at his uncle. His uncle [MASK]. This time he heard himself, loud and clear and unmistakably in his head, calling him Uncle. He’d been advised to wait until it felt right. It did now beyond question.
<name>Heidi</name>	Heidi	Hattie	And in a single smooth noiseless surge of power the Eldorado was gone. No one there, not even [MASK] with the door handle snatched from her furious grasp, so much as heard the huge engine turn over. “And where’d you get the silly Heidi hat?
<name>Alvin Ailey</name>	Alvin Ailey	Mahalia	“Music,” he said, “what else? And you can hear some way-out, wonderful shit up there, believe me.” Then: “ ‘In the Upper Room,’ eh? I might have to steal that from [MASK].”
<name>Cherry</name>	Cherry	Dawn	She was behind it. She had aided and abetted. The foster care, City child without any background or family ([MASK], her mother with the pretty name, had died by then) had put them up to it.
<name>Maman</name>	Maman	Hattie	He had searched for the lowly vendeur among them. Finally a sidelong glance his way, although it did not include his face. “Where’s your bathrobe? Where’re your slippers?” [MASK] sounding angry with him too. Quickly he ran and put them on.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Benjamin	[MASK], in an exaggerated batters stance, demonstrated the right way to grip the baseball bat, how to swing with power, and they played that for a while. Afterward, using the basketball, he showed off some of the fancy footwork he employed in the one game played at his school.
<name>He</name>	He	Dora	You know it’s no good for you,” [MASK] called after her. The woman fanned her down. The room they entered put to shame the one he’d just left. It was the way, he thought, a room in a palais royal back home might look.
<name>he</name>	he	Sonny	“All right,” he said. “All right. It seems I heard wrong. I was really hoping, though, that you’d be staying on a few days longer so [MASK] could have a little more time with his cousins.
<name>His mother</name>	His mother	Hattie	After a while, when he found he could draw them reasonably well without having to first trace them, he began making up his own. Castles and fortresses of his own invention. [MASK] willingly kept him supplied with the drawing blocs. They were cheap enough.
<name>Mr. Statler</name>	Mr. Statler	Hatties	“I’m still giving my tour guide talks.” “Oh. I thought you would’ve retired long ago.” [MASK] voice was as tight as the woman’s earlier. “The Conservancy people won’t let me! They won’t hear of me retiring.
<name>Marisol</name>	Marisol	Dora	For another, caring for the tree in the yard her father had planted close to a hundred years ago. They had also helped her find nice, quiet, hardworking tenants for the two upper floors of the house. And had found [MASK] (a godsend!)
<name>her</name>	her	Hattie	Let [MASK] tell if she wanted to, but not him. Which she promptly did. “You would’ve wanted to cover your ears too if you’d heard what she had to say about you and that group of yours. Certain practices you all go in for.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Hattie	The crowd waiting. That was his way, [MASK] knew. His body moving absent-mindedly through space, his head, his thoughts on something other than his surroundings, and his eyes (she had studied them well!)
<name>her father</name>	her father	Hattie	I don’t suppose you remember that dress ... ?” “I don’t wanna remember anything!” An almost angry mutter from the hiding place, in the English she had learned from [MASK]. (She spoke her mother’s impeccable French as well.)
<name>Momma</name>	Momma	Hattie	“But that didn’t make him no never-mind!” [MASK] employing the timeless, familiar vocabulary of around the block. Laughter rose like the gift of themselves the audience deposited at her feet. The gift of their total attention.
<name>Elvis</name>	Elvis	Shades	“You didn’t get to hear him.” The edge to her voice again. “So lemme tell you. Your brother took that sappy little tune, put a hurtin’ on it like [MASK] said, and made it his tune, his song.
<name>mother</name>	mother	Thomases	“ ‘It’ll never take root. It’ll never sprout. It’ll never grow. It’ll never be able to stand the cold.’ If you had only heard the doubting [MASK], the worst one being my mother,” she resumed her saga.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Sonny	Old as it was, it looked new. As they entered the front gate, [MASK]’s awed gaze took in the stained-glass fanlight above the carved and polished double-leaf door at the top of the stoop and the fringed and scalloped shades at the lofty windows.
<name>her</name>	her	Hattie	The touts, the runners, transplanted goatherds and village boys, silhouette-black and rail-thin in their long traditional djellabahs and kufi skullcaps, knew it was useless to ply [MASK] with the notices. Une Americaine noire. A nonbeliever.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Hattie	“Anyway, I hope you can see why I’ve got to try and do right by the little fella inside. My brother would have wanted it.” He reached for the doorknob. [MASK]. Her voice raised.
<name>Madonna</name>	Madonna	Cherisse	[MASK] remained standing. She spoke, but to no one in particular. “I’m not moving till he comes back here and tells me what he did to that song.” Perfect arms folded under perfectly molded breasts, she stood waiting in the one spot.
<name>old-miss-young</name>	old-miss-young	Ulene	I thought I knew how to cut-and-contrive to keep going, but old-miss-young walks away with the prize . ..” [MASK] suddenly speaking with open admiration, even awe, until she caught herself and the old venom flooded her voice again and her mind reverted to the old wrongs.
<name>Dr. Gaddis</name>	Dr. Gaddis	Dora	It was nice again, he told her. He hadn’t worn a coat. At this, she weakly struck her hands together like a pair of small cymbals, her mind made up about something. Suddenly she was all purpose. He was to go and call [MASK] for her.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Ulene	“You oughta get all dressed up and come.” “You . . . ! You .. . !” [MASK] furious but at a loss for words again. To escape him, she went and got out the dog-eared photograph album.
<name>Ms. Lacy</name>	Ms. Lacy	Hattie	This time he was prepared. [MASK] had allowed him to bring along his drawing bloc, and as always it was helping him to tune out the voices. “What’ve you got there?” the man had asked when he came to collect them for the meeting.
<name>the waiter</name>	the waiter	Hattie	She herself, he’d already noted, was the tawny yellow-brown of the lions in the zoo in the Bois de Vincennes. “Who’s the daddy?” Holding up the finger to [MASK] who had taken a seat some distance from them.
<name>me</name>	me	Hattie	Before he could get a word out she clamped a hand over his mouth in the bed. Another hotel room, another bed. “I know, you don’t understand [MASK]. But please, for my sake. Everything will really be perfect then.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Hattie	“Why’d you have to go name him after that man?” She was looking at her head-on now. [MASK] didn’t answer immediately. Instead, acting as if she hadn’t heard, she began fussing with her skirt which lay pooled around her on the parquet floor.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Alva	Silence for the longest time, the dust still settling around them, until without looking at him or speaking, she placed one half of the album on his lap, linking them, and he immediately said, “My aunt [MASK] is nice.
<name>Who</name>	Who	Cherisse	She had absolute confidence in their powers; yet, at the same time, there was also an almost abject need to be constantly assured of their worth, to be constantly admired for them. The contradiction made it easy to forgive her vanity. “Love? [MASK]?
<name>him</name>	him	Hattie	Suddenly, like a citywide power failure, all her brightness and enthusiasm died, her dark, unhappy frown returned, and tears—angry ones this time—welled up. She sat him down next to her on the sofa so that she could have an unobstructed view of [MASK].
<name>Janet</name>	Janet	Hattie	She had been sitting at the table all along, partly hidden behind [MASK], but now she rose and stepped forward to stand squarely in front of her friend. Fully in view. The milk-chocolate Shirley Temple girl grown into a beauty.
<name>Clarisse</name>	Clarisse	Hattie	As if to accommodate them further, the morning chill was gone and the wind scarcely resembled its earlier self. [MASK] confined the walk to the one block, her steps tracing a course that took them repeatedly up one side of the street, then down the other.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Ulene	The bright sunlight outside scarcely penetrated the years of city grime left untouched on the pane of glass. This done, he led the way out of the kitchen. “How you get so powerful all of a sudden?” [MASK] cried behind him, finally finding her voice.
<name>Mr. Stevens</name>	Mr. Stevens	Hattie	Under her hat which she hadn’t taken off (nor had she removed the sweater that was as heavy as a coat), her eyes were closed. Had she nodded off? [MASK] did that sometimes. He caught, though, the hint of a smile.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Hattie	The head with the braided ponytail and bangs [MASK] had fixed that morning remained bowed. The feet in the schoolgirl oxfords and kneesocks moved dully ahead. “You suddenly dropped my hand and went tearing off when you saw some boys climbing it. You wanted to also.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Ulene	He took his time with this, piling them on the already crowded counter, [MASK] looking on helplessly. Once he half-filled the pail with water, he added a pinch of sugar to it from a bowl on the table.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Hattie	Until, a faint mutter: “Always with some lame excuse when you went to him for your money...” Suddenly, scarcely checking the traffic, she stepped off the curb and started across the street, not moving it seemed of her own volition. “Where’s [MASK] going?”
<name>Maman</name>	Maman	Hattie	“The artist just felt like it.” [MASK]. She always had an answer. She had once lived, she often told him, along with his grandfather and grandmother, the three of them always together, in an immeuble twice as grand as the ones on their walk.
<name>her daughter</name>	her daughter	Hattie	(She deplored the fact that [MASK] had no interest in learning how to speak properly.) Moreover, she had perfected the array of gestures and mannerisms: the play of the hands, the eyes, the set of the mouth, and the Gallic shrug—the hallmarks of someone bom to the language.
<name>Janice</name>	Janice	Alva	So do they. I’m sure.” Then there was his uncle’s wife, his aunt [MASK], the whitelooking lady with wavy hair and glasses in the picture on his desk. She had the same name as her mother in the long-ago snapshot.
<name>Auntie</name>	Auntie	Hattie	How come? Hadn’t they just been all smiles at the concert? Hadn’t his uncle planted a big, happy kiss on [MASK]’s cheek onstage to thank her for the stories about his grandfather? Hadn’t they toasted and congratulated each other at the reception after-
<name>Prince</name>	Prince	Shades	That done, the lights went up, the brass section of the band rose to its feet, and with [MASK] leading the way, the procession back from the grave was, in the tradition, a sudden uptempo, swinging, joyous celebration of the man and his art.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Benjamin	“Because that’s what she is,” [MASK] said, “A cocker spaniel. I named her.” His friend would definitely want to hear about the dog. And also about the play yard his cousins had all to themselves, that was as big as, if not bigger than, their schoolyard.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Hattie	Out of everything in the room the piano alone stood dusted and polished. There she stopped. “Take off yuh coat, nuh.” His new coat. [MASK] had bought it for him only days ago with money from the check sent her by the man who had met them at the airport.
<name>rock and roll</name>	rock and roll	Bach	When at the piano, he kept his right ear tuned to it at all times, letting it guide him, inspire him. His other ear? It remained earthbound, trained on the bedrock that for him was [MASK] and the blues.
<name>she</name>	she	Hattie	He started to say yes, only to remind himself that it would depend on whether [MASK] had been able to put her hands on some real money by then. So instead of saying yes, he shrugged and started to give back the ring.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Hattie	P’tite J0J0, who was really [MASK]’s child. Wasn’t she, after all, the one who had given birth to the idea of her? Hadn’t she, to all effects, raised her, a mother in act and deed and love, if not in name?
<name>her mother</name>	her mother	Hattie	She turned to him for comforting, and he hugged her. He was grateful that this time she didn’t blame his grandfather and [MASK], and he hugged her, assailed by the embalmed smell of the minks, which overwhelmed the toilette smell he loved.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Ulene	He suddenly heard himself calling her by her name in his head, the way his uncle did out loud. [MASK]. The right and loving name for her. “I ask where you going with that tree limb?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Cherisse	“Besides,” he continued, “if you go that route, we’d have to get into even more of your business. Such as the way I’ve learned you, my brother, and [MASK] lived all those years.
<name>He</name>	He	Duconge	It was hers, the job, for as long as she needed it, he’d said. He had also helped her find a cheaper place to live. Her medicaments? [MASK] understood that need as well and kept her supplied. A true friend.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Dora	To shade them, [MASK] had placed the chair under the magnolia’s thick, luxuriant head of leaves, each leaf a dark lacquered green on top and brown-gold underneath. Because it branched fairly close to the ground, the tree effectively screened them from the street and the few cars and people passing by.
<name>his sister</name>	his sister	Hattie	So he looked up the block to where the children were playing. They had started a helter-skelter game of chat, which he knew from [MASK] was called tag in English, and in his head he went running, darting, and dodging with them.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Alva	She and your aunt [MASK] are busy catching up on old times.” He was really only double-checking. He had briefly caught sight of her looking out the window at them laughing at his uncle with the hamper on his head.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Hattie	That way, she could watch him from the window. And she could always call him if she thought he was staying too long and he’d come back right away. “Okay.” To his surprise, [MASK] said okay.
<name>him</name>	him	Sonny	He was suddenly less annoyed with her. Through the wide doorway, the old woman ushered [MASK] into a shuttered, airless living room filled to overflow with an assortment of shabby, mismatched furniture, none of it arranged in any order.
<name>smiled</name>	smiled	Edgar	But never mind, we’ll make the most of our one day, okay?” he said and gave him the little uppercut caress on the chin. It was the third one. Right away he felt reassured. His uncle [MASK].
<name>Uncle Tom</name>	Uncle Tom	Hattie	“Oui,” he said; and deeply offended by the cutting look she’d been dealt, [MASK], his fathermothersisterbrother and all the “kin” he’d ever known, was gone. The moment she turned out of the yard, the woman unlocked the dungeon gate.
<name>Evangeline</name>	Evangeline	Everett	Look how she put up that daughter of hers to turn my [MASK]’s head. She was the one behind it. You can’t tell me different. A girl spoiled rotten from small. That was somebody for him to call himself marrying?
<name>Prince George</name>	Prince George	Sonny	It will be an historic occasion on a number of counts in other words, all the more reason for you to be there. Naturally, we would ask that you bring [MASK] with you. He should be present at this tribute to his grandfather.
<name>Phryne</name>	Phryne	Hattie	Instead, acting as if she hadn’t heard, she began fussing with her skirt which lay pooled around her on the parquet floor. [MASK] was wearing her standard outfit, a sweeping ankle-length skirt and a matching loose-fitting tunic with a high neck and great batwinged dolman sleeves.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Hattie	“I’m not moving till he comes back here and tells me what he did to that song.” Perfect arms folded under perfectly molded breasts, she stood waiting in the one spot. Behind her, [MASK] slowly sank down to wait also.
<name>his mother</name>	his mother	Hattie	Just as the balloon in his chest began to fill again, a hand came to rest on his shoulder and he was being drawn away from both [MASK] and all the people around them. His grandfather s brother, taking charge, was suddenly steering him over to the office half of the room.
<name>Therese</name>	Therese	Alva	Maybe, he thought, it was like the on-and-off switch on her piano, her mind. He bent his head, folded his hands in his lap. There was nothing to do then but wait until it switched back to normal. Or the hour visit was over. “[MASK]!
<name>Norma</name>	Norma	Ulene	And for what? I know the jig is up. That the world don’ have no uses anymore for someone like me.” [MASK] speaking with a defiant coherence all of a sudden, her eroded mind whole and intact for the moment.
<name>the dog</name>	the dog	Hattie	She periodically scolded [MASK] about the walks, her aged head with its side-to-side tic that gave the impression she was always saying non, non, non to everything underscoring her disapproval, her breath ripe with the smell of Pere Magloires fermented apples.
<name>Mrs. Biddle</name>	Mrs. Biddle	Ulene	“A white mice.” [MASK] sadly shook her head. “My friend from small went and bring a child into this world that looked everything like some little white mice and lose the good sleep-in job she had, her chances finish . . .”
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Dora	It’s a disgrace. She needs to stop being so stubborn and let somebody come take care of her. Poor thing could die in there and not a soul would know .. . “[MASK]!” A sudden plaintive, frightened cry.
<name>Valium</name>	Valium	Hattie	The children playing chat had disappeared indoors. [MASK] remained upset though. Because later that evening she took a few of her candy array of pink, yellow, blue, and cream-colored capsules, tablets, and pills. Her medicaments she called them.
<name>She</name>	She	Hattie	Sometimes he asked pourquoi? why? and got an answer. This time he sensed it would be futile. He awoke from the nap to find her in the living room at the front of the apartment. [MASK] didn’t appear to have slept.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Hattie	But know that I’ll be back and forth over there to see him until it’s resolved.” He rose, visibly tired, his face haggard, although the suitor’s pleated shirt and bow tie looked as fresh as if he had just put them on. “Give him a chance, [MASK].”
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Dora	He’d never heard the word before. “Don’t know what’s wrong with her and she won’t lemme call the doctor.” He followed [MASK] down the parlor floor hallway, past the living room on their right, to a door at the end of the hall.
<name>Maman</name>	Maman	Hattie	He was to keep quiet about that too. “Those people over there don’t have to know all of our business, okay?” “Okay.” What else to say? [MASK] had her reasons for things. Sometimes he asked pourquoi? why?
<name>the man</name>	the man	Sonny	She was out of the car in seconds. [MASK] quickly followed and stood gazing up beside her. “It looks a little like one of your castles, doesn’t it?” The man had come to stand at his other side. “Kinda,” he said.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Woman	[MASK] too cheap to buy one of the new refrigerators with the motor on top. Her fear, her shame on the way back that some kid she knew would see her pushing the broken-down carriage with the 25-pound block of ice inside.
<name>She</name>	She	Hattie	He might have been confronting the harsh countenance of judgment. “I don’t understand. I don’t understand . . .” [MASK] repeating in numb disbelief to herself. “He wouldn’t have done something like that. I raised her. She was my child!
<name>Aunt Kate</name>	Aunt Kate	Hattie	He didn’t want [MASK] charging up to the school, embarrassing him with her scrambled French. After the play yard, he and his cousins had lunch in what looked like a small merry-go-round of a building on the lawn behind the house.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Hattie	He laughed. The outsize hands riding piggyback on his. Colossal arms encircling him. Larger-than-life face bent close to his. The man smell. A different, more powerful aura that wasn’t about creams and lotions. [MASK] looked on.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Hattie	the man had asked when he came to collect them for the meeting. [MASK] was still inside getting dressed, while he already had his coat on and was sitting waiting for the man in the BarcaLounger (he liked operating the lever which lowered and raised the padded and tufted backrest).
<name>John</name>	John	Hattie	“Nothings pure. Nothings wholly selfless.” His credo again. “And do you know we actually got it hallway off the ground . . .” “And then they killed him too.” [MASK]. “Yep. The bloodletting just wouldn’t quit.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Hattie	He was still on the verge of leaving, his back to [MASK] as well as to the room. “And even if it had crossed his mind because he was feeling desperate, he would never have written to you or anybody else without telling me. No!
