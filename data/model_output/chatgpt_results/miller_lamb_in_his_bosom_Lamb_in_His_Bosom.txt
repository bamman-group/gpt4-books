<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Audley	The landlord had stobbed a knife clean into his lights because [MASK] had tampered with his daughter’s good name. And out of the wound, they told her, frothy blood spurted as his breaths came, till he died.
<name>Jackaroo</name>	Jackaroo	Lonzo	that cowers in its pouch on her belly.... And here she was with [MASK] by her side to keep danger offen her and her little un; here she was safe and warm, and not worried up over every shadow and noise as a wild thing must be.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Cean	Suddenly the hounds growled, and the hair on their backs bristled high down the ridge of each lean spine. So close that she could swear that it was just outside the door, [MASK] heard a painter scream, and another painter’s hoarser scream answered the first.
<name>Joseph Smith</name>	Joseph Smith	Cean	She sat down with blood storming in her ears, and breaths short in her chest. Never before in all her life had she said so much without halting. Two days later the witness of the spirit came to [MASK] after she had fasted two days and nights till she puked from emptiness.
<name>Mr. March</name>	Mr. March	Vince	[MASK] had eaten his meals in bed for many a day, but never till this day did the head of the table seem forsaken. The empty chair was now a cruel reminder that swallowing and breathing can cease, aye, even in one who is as steadfast a surety as the sun.
<name>Bessie</name>	Bessie	Major	They looked at one other for a moment. She said: “I’ll tie up [MASK] t’ keep the boogers off me.” His eyes went back to the sled heaped with manure. When he spoke, he tried to keep his voice hard and manly:
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Lonzo	Letters came for the planters, —but never a one for [MASK]. He would watch the Coast men open their letters that were folded up like thumb papers for a little feller’s horn speller, one end slipped under the other end and sealed with a wafer.
<name>Mr. Gradgrind</name>	Mr. Gradgrind	Cean	The clock on [MASK]’s mantelpiece marked the hours carefully, alloting so much space here, and here, and here; the hands moved around the clock’s inscrutable face, careful not to haste in their ways for any great matter that might he ahead, nor to pause for any brief, perishable happiness.
<name>John</name>	John	Vince	[MASK]’s eyes were set on the floor, his hands trembled on his knees, and his face was green with fear or some other thing. His tongue would not speak, though words pushed up against his dumb throat.
<name>John</name>	John	Cean	“I thought you mought like some fresh-churned buttermilk.” He took the jug and pushed back the brim of his old hat and wiped his face on his sleeve: “Yeah. This sun’s hot.” [MASK] waited in silence while he drank.
<name>Annabel</name>	Annabel	Fairby	And one little hissing flame licked out its tongue and thrust its way into [MASK]’s skirt, catching and thrusting and eating its way with its bright, forked tongue. Wind whipped about, blowing the children’s hair, beating the flames on the wood to fine, fair mischief.
<name>Miss Watson</name>	Miss Watson	Kimbrough	He kicked the loose dirt of the street as he lounged along in the thin dark. There were fires in the fireplaces of the houses, flooding their fight through doors and shutters set ajar to the early night. In a house on the left there were voices and laughter. That would be [MASK]’s.
<name>him</name>	him	Lias	She’s already said she’d marry me. We done been together.” The old man’s chin quivered; he was trembling throughout his body. He’d give [MASK] such a rawhiding as he would never get again. He’d lay the stripes open on his back.
<name>Red</name>	Red	Jasper	She knew that he was trying to make her laugh. She reached a soapy plate toward him: “[MASK], they’s not one man in ten thousand like you. I’m just tellin’ ye in case ye don’t already know it.. .in
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Lonzo	Her face was red, and the long muscles in her legs ached from much stooping by the fireplace to fry the steak. [MASK] had jerked some of the meat into long, thin strips and hung it in the sunshine to dry out; they would use it when the fresh beef was gone.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Lias	Oh, the earth has mouths; the swamps are full of them, slobbering and sucking and trembling for greediness! She thought—[MASK] is alive and well___I should wish to take up where I left off__Take up and leave off and take up again... like an old shoe.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Jasper	She would not put on her stockings, dressing as though she were in a mighty haste to do something; so [MASK] pulled the heavy woolen stockings on her feet, that were, and would ever be, rough and drawn and scarred from the old burns.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Cal	When [MASK] cried, she boxed his ears till his head rang, and told him to tote out the cook-pots before the roof fell in on them all. They worked like ants in an ant-bed.
<name>her</name>	her	Bliss	Sometimes when he would be deep in thought over some affair of his own, she would come softly behind him where he sat, soberfaced, and say, “A penny for yere thoughts!” And he would know that she believed that he was studying about [MASK].
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Cean	It was hot there inside the house of branches; the limbs ran out as rafters, the heavy green leaves walled about the space inside. [MASK] mulled over her thought: this was a magnolia house, green and rustling inside, with great white blooms hung about on all the walls.
<name>his</name>	his	Cean	He cooked his victuals there to himself over a little fire, and hauled logs a second time for a second house—alone as he was alone that first time as a single man when he made ready [MASK]’s bridal house.
<name>Lenore</name>	Lenore	Cean	When she had gone, he took the lines and chucked to the ox; but soon he whoaed the ox again and watched [MASK] making her way back down the long furrow where her bare-foot tracks had made a faint path in coming.
<name>his mother</name>	his mother	Cean	He lay so for a long time, remembering. But not for too long, for this was cool night wind gathering to blow. And he was not a little boy any more, as he had been when [MASK] had loved him.
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Jake	But [MASK] would not buy one when he was a man, not if he had a pocketful of gold pieces. One man said a shipload of them stunk like carr’n, and the stink would come down the wind on still days like a herd of cattle butchered and left to rot.
<name>Daddy</name>	Daddy	Lonzo	How long would it be before she could follow [MASK] again, dropping the slick, yellow grains from her hand—like that!—one for the cutworm, one for the crow, one to rot, and one to grow, to make the tall tasseled corn for roas’in’-ears, for meal and grits?
<name>Uncle Remus</name>	Uncle Remus	Lonzo	[MASK] would give his ’tarnal soul for a mare to ride! But a pretty thing he’d be a-prancin‘ around a cotton-patch on a mare! Nobody but Coast planters—Old Line Whigs—could own horses.
<name>Benjamin Franklin</name>	Benjamin Franklin	Lonzo	They were strong as oxen and ten times as fast, but the cheapest of them would cost nigh onto a hundred dollars apiece. [MASK] thought such doings would be a foolish waste of money inasmuch as oxen would serve as well.
<name>Abner</name>	Abner	Lonzo	The pines stood still on this calm day when [MASK]’s house went up a second time. The air was quiet save for the shouts of the men, heaving and setting in lifting the logs into walls that grew taller with each new log.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Bliss	Just to say something, he said: “You don’t know what you want....” Then she had him: “It seems to me it’s you that can't make up yore mind_” He knew that she was thinking of [MASK].
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Lonzo	Her mind went all around and about this new thing in her arms as she lay there, while the other women hovered over the fireplace, a long way off, preparing a belated breakfast. [MASK] sat beside her, a part of her awakening from the dream that had encompassed all her life until now....
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Jake	[MASK] lay sprawling on his stomach on the hard white sand, his hands pressing his cheeks, his elbows ground into the sea-sand. As far as you could see there was water—blue-green water with white foam furling lazily yonder like suds boiling in a pot.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Jasper	The click of her knitting-needles beat softly between her hands, regular as clock-ticks, busy as breathing. Inside the rosy cave yonder, heat, quivering and flame-colored, stirred not at all, but [MASK] knew that it was strong enough to melt a metal hard and cold as iron.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Lonzo	He came through the clear, sunny air, wiping sweat from his bulging brow that was like [MASK]’s. He cut off his father’s boot with swipes of his Barlow knife, and bound up the halves of the severed foot with the shirt jerked offhis back.
<name>Becky</name>	Becky	Lias	The coat’s broad lappets were pierced with big worked buttonholes—a meaningless vanity, for then were no buttons to go into those holes; now there were buttons to fasten up his stuck-out chest, but the lappets were but vain show. [MASK] settled his head low within the tumed-up collar.
<name>the judge</name>	the judge	Hartshorn	Another case concerned a young man of the county who had been ambushed in the woods by two rowdies who had laid his head open with a turpentine mattock, and had pocketed his gold watch and coins. The argument went back and forth, for in this case [MASK] was on the side of the rowdies.
<name>God</name>	God	Bliss	He would see to this child, though a thousand times he had prayed that it would die before ever it lived, though every time he laid his eyes on it the sight shamed him. But let [MASK] look to her sins!
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Mary	Live-oaks stood thick, crowning the island and trailing curtains of moss. Into this wilderness [MASK] would go, tramping carelessly, not caring if a rattler sang out suddenly and struck at her leg, for if one should, what did she care?
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Maggie	She screamed to [MASK] to get from under the loft hole. When the space below was clear, she dragged the chest across the floor and pushed it over the edge of the loft hole, and it fell, breaking loose its leathern hinges pegged with hickory pins.
<name>Jody</name>	Jody	Jake	He had a jug that circled here and yonder; some men passed it on quickly, others hesitated and tilted it to their lips. [MASK] listened, wide-eyed, to the rough greetings of the men who remembered one another from other years.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Cean	They were mates, most likely. And he brought [MASK]’s piggin, with her bonnet lying in its bottom. He slit the long, smooth bellies of the snakes and stripped the scaly gray skins from the flesh that looked like fish-meat.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Lias	And a fit had possessed [MASK], a fit of slow torturing fever, of gentle tremors that ruffled his blood deliciously, of farseeing daydreams that brought the girl near to him any time he willed to think of her.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jake	When [MASK] saw her tears he went and sat quietly behind her through all the loud talk and merrymaking, trying to make her laugh by put-on crying over his jaw that he claimed she had broke with her fist!
<name>Snipe</name>	Snipe	Birds	The frogs that had shrilled their brittle, metallic singsongs through the wet summer months were blinking sleepily in the dark somewhere, squatted on their ugly haunches, multiple thousands of them in a thousand burrows. [MASK] sought through the dead grasses for their meals of dried seeds.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jake	The road went down between the houses to the river, and the river went down between the bluffs to the sea. [MASK]’s eyes followed the river’s course that was heaving a little with a fullin’ tide; then his gaze came back, retreating from too much wonder.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Lias	Her father owned the little tavern where a man could have rum or fried fish or a bed for the askin’, if a man had stuff to trade. [MASK] called his father apart from the men on the fourth night SO they spent at the Coast.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Lonzo	The little moon hung lonesome in the early night, unwearied in fulling and shrinking over woods and waters. [MASK] found it over his left shoulder through space clear of tree or cloud; it meant good luck—rain and good luck. He walked back to the house with slow eagerness.
<name>Mammy</name>	Mammy	Lias	Somehow I kain’t think of [MASK] bein’ old and worried out__” He reached for her hand and held it, turning it in his hand and gloating over it as though it were a new-found treasure he had chanced upon.
<name>her</name>	her	Carver	She hushed her talking to weep, and hushed her weeping to talk of him who was the only son she had ever borned, the only soul that bore her name, save these little ones that he had begotten of [MASK] blood.
<name>The girl</name>	The girl	Cean	She gave it warm catnip tea till its stomach stuck out, but still it cried, expending its little anguish on each short-drawn breath. [MASK] was crying, too, with her face turned away to the wall.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Vince	“[MASK], you a-aimin’t’ take the boys with ye to the Coast?” There was a short silence; the boys held their breath; then the old man said: “I hadn’t thought nothin’ about hit.”
<name>Ma Joad</name>	Ma Joad	Lonzo	She helped [MASK] dress the beef, working at the wash-trough where they could dip water from the spring close by. She cut and sliced with the big butcher-knife, and her hands were soaked red with blood; clots of blood dried on the knife-blade and on her wrists.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Fairby	Men must start their spring plowing early this season, for crops must be up and doing before hot summer; there had not been enough cold to kill the worrisome insects that would swarm alive over the fields in the hot months. [MASK]’s first birthday fell in the middle of this warm winter.
<name>Helen</name>	Helen	Cean	[MASK] took care of her eyes, washing them many times a day in salty water, in May rain water, keeping out of the sun as much as she could. She didn’t want to go blind in this world; there was too much to look at.
<name>Matilda</name>	Matilda	Cean	The summer days passed slowly, it seemed to [MASK].The little un was making her a little heavy with his weight, was crowding her breath in her bosom, was making her slower in her movements to dress, to water the calf, to hoe the sunflowers.
<name>myself</name>	myself	Jasper	She turned the thought over and over, and the longer it lay in her mind the more beautiful it grew. This was her thought: I have you back, [MASK]; your head lies here on my arm; but if you had never come home again, yet I should never have lost you.
<name>Pa</name>	Pa	Lonzo	Her bright brown eyes went shyly about, seeking gentle satisfaction in the soft air, the sunshine, the thick plodding of the hooves of the ox on the slick brown pine-needles and soft sand. Her happy glance slipped shyly to [MASK]’s bearded face.
<name>Dinah</name>	Dinah	Lonzo	When [MASK]’s mouth had softened from the clinging press of her mouth, and his arms yielded her back to herself again, he told her: “Ye’re agonna marry me. I’m agonna tell ‘m so.”
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Jasper	“I don’t complain to [MASK]”.. .she reached her hands to his shoulders and turned him toward her “.. .and you know it_” The rough cowhide of the lines slipped through his hands, and his hands went about her shoulders as though seeking for her he had found her.
<name>he</name>	he	Cal	She kept thinking that he might desert and come home, but days passed end on end, and [MASK] did not come. He did not mind the going, she knew; he was too young to have learned any sense; he was but twenty in October.
<name>Doctor</name>	Doctor	Dicie	Nobody in the room stirred, for they hardly noted the sound. What did it matter who came or went, now that the little un was dying with nobody to help her? After a minute there was a ff amming of a fist on the front door and [MASK] opened it.
<name>God</name>	God	Lias	its food___And this.. .well, mayhap this was meant to be so, too— this evil that had come between her and [MASK]. There was something in this field that came into her and purged her clean, as boneset tea purges disease from fevered flesh.
<name>Cows</name>	Cows	Betsey	By the time the rooster crowed the first time she would have breakfast about done. They would eat as the pigs began to stir in the pen off to the side of the house and [MASK] lowed away down in the cold.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Lonzo	He would lean over a trading-counter and listen while some young blood of a planter’s family harangued over states’ rights. There were fire-eaters among these planters, [MASK] thought; they would fight at the drop of a hat.
<name>Tea Cake</name>	Tea Cake	Jasper	She clumped blindly across the floor of the kitchen-house. [MASK] met her and held her in his arms against his breast; she beat her forehead on his hard young breast, crying and crying and telling him, as though she had only just heard it:
<name>Willa</name>	Willa	Lonzo	It was aThursday, dry and mild.The wind lay, and sunshine fell in bright reaches across [MASK]’s fields. The leafless swamp lay off to itself, still and harmless now that summer heat did not draw out the malarial miasma from the mud.
<name>she</name>	she	Lonzo	She had dropped every last grain out of her hand, like that, and there it was growing in long rows far as you could see. That was her part, to drop the seeds and help with the hoeing, if [MASK] needed her.
<name>Mrs. Hines</name>	Mrs. Hines	Cean	He sang “A froggie went a-courtin’” till all the children smiled; but [MASK] would only break into weeping, thinking on how her children would be sour-faced as herself when they were as old.
<name>Jem</name>	Jem	Vince	They were a troublesome age—four-and-a-half—good for nothing but to make a fuss and tote in firewood. [MASK] was going on seven now; he could feed the pigs as good as any man.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Margot	His hands were a little trembly with the knife. Whittling, with his mind somewhere else, like a fool he cut his finger, and [MASK] reached down oint-ment from the mantelpiece and held his hand in her hands and stopped the blood with hen’s oil.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Margot	But there were many who fought their way through and found glory in their grasp; one by one they laid their hands in the preacher’s hand, confessed their sins, and asked entrance to this church, and cleansing baptism under water. [MASK] was among those who confessed their sins this first day.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Cean	Then he went out again to the cow-pen. Her mother had sent along plenty of cold food for supper, but [MASK] would cook on her own fireplace this first night in her new home. She sliced meat, and mixed meal and water and salt for cornbread.
<name>Daddy</name>	Daddy	Lonzo	She ran on across the plowed fields, calling for [MASK]. He heard her coming across the fields to him and jumped the furrows running, to meet her, breaking the stalks of young corn heedlessly. When he reached her her face was ugly with weeping.
<name>Doctor</name>	Doctor	Lonzo	Impulses swelled within her, swelled her body fit to burst; yet they did not come out in words, nor song, nor in any sign. [MASK] said her ankles were swelling. Only her ankles gave a sign as yet.
<name>Little Women</name>	Little Women	Seen	It was tedious labor; sixty times must the mold be filled and cooled, and the eight candles loosened from it and laid out. [MASK] would like to help, but her mother would not let her because she was too little, and besides didn’t she have her new dress on her back?
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Lonzo	Cool spray sprinkled their faces. They were chanting an old, silly child’s verse: Rain, rain, go away: Come again another day; Lit-tul [MASK] wants to play! He was the baby, so the last hne always held his name to please him.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Cean	A change of the season had always before, since she was a little thing, moved [MASK] to a sort of season’s change within herself. She could tell so easily when a new season blew in on a north or south wind, or crept in, unawares, on the dark of one certain night.
<name>Antonia</name>	Antonia	Cal	But still she fought over [MASK]. She clenched her arms around his head and would not let go; the buzzards set their claws in his legs and ankles and gnawed as far up as his knee joints, and would not leave him be for all her fighting.
<name>God</name>	God	Maggie	Even her mother’s milk had been taken out of that first child’s mouth, because the jealous presence of the second child was poison. But the little Kissie—hit were too sweet a child fer anybody, even [MASK]—to hold anything ag’in’ hit!
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Lonzo	His eyes were black as swamp water where a big mud-cat can come to within two-fingers’ width of the top, and still be safely hidden. [MASK]’s eyes were like that—you never knew what things were hiding behind them except that with her they were always kind things.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Bliss	Then [MASK] hurried down the aisle and ran to her father’s cart, for she was sick. She lay for a while on a quilt in the back of the cart, but soon she lifted her head and spilled her breakfast over the cartwheel.
<name>Abby</name>	Abby	Cean	[MASK]’s tracks criss-crossed all the other tracks as she threw scraps to the chickens that flew to a fluttering, greedy cluster over the food, as she carried water to the calf, now nearly grown, and his mother, now regarding him with contented indifference.
<name>Mrs. Wiggs</name>	Mrs. Wiggs	Cean	And how [MASK] did grieve over them! as though she did not have six other children besides. Long afterward, she would sit on the doorstep late of an afternoon and stare off toward the swamp while hushed tears rolled down her cheeks for the little lost boys.
<name>Miss Emily</name>	Miss Emily	Lonzo	It was a pitiful thing to wrop the little things in a new length of her homespun and lay them in a box in the ground as you would do with two pink still-born pigs. [MASK] could hardly abear hit.
<name>Miss Watson</name>	Miss Watson	Cean	[MASK] told the preacher that he must surely set up two dunce-stools for her twin sons, but he said that he much doubted it if they anyways took after their mother; there would be ciphering and penmanship and spelling.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Lias	So [MASK] dug up some for her, too, till his hands were grimy. Then the two of them went to wash their hands where the creek flowed across the trail. And for fun they took off their shoes and stockings and waded, though the water was still ice cold from winter.
<name>Joanna</name>	Joanna	Cean	Because the necklaces minded her of heaven’s morning-glories that she had seen in her vision, [MASK] went into a fit of weeping and groaned in her sleep all night, and spoke out of her head like a woman in a trance.
<name>Aunt Nicey</name>	Aunt Nicey	Lonzo	The child’s grandmothers came in time for the full moon, hoping for a boy. [MASK] would need boys to help break ground and pull fodder; girls were good for but little, except to weave and pick cotton.
<name>Aunt Polly</name>	Aunt Polly	Cean	How many times, when he was tired enough to die, had [MASK] waked him in the night by stirring up the fire to warm a little youngun’s feet, or to change its wet clothes, or to rock it on her shoulder to get the colicky pains out of its stomach!
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Cal	A fool thing it was for [MASK] to go yonder and fight a war over a black nigger. If the nigger wanted to be free, let him fight, his own self! Oh, she could not abear the thought!
<name>Satan</name>	Satan	Satan	Should earth against my soul engage, and hellish darts be hurled, Then I can smile at [MASK]’s rage and face a frowning world. “Let cares like a wild deluge come, and storms of sorrow fall; May I but safely reach my home, my God, my heaven, my all.
<name>Magnolia</name>	Magnolia	Lonzo	[MASK] gone_I named ye fer a magnolia blossom___Lonzo thought hit’mought be a likely name___” The word that was her oldest child’s name reeled crazily through her head, repeating itself like the sound of a loom’s treadle: Mag... nol.. .ia_Mag.. .nol
<name>Jody</name>	Jody	Cean	A woman has to be stronger than a man. [MASK] was tired out when the butchering was done. She left the tallow until tomorrow. Her face was red, and the long muscles in her legs ached from much stooping by the fireplace to fry the steak.
<name>Pa</name>	Pa	Cean	She was halfway to the cotton before he started the ox again. He stormed at the patient, plodding beast, “Giddap in there!” [MASK]’s eyes followed the rows of young corn, all of a size, all of a green.
<name>Ebenezer</name>	Ebenezer	Vince	Bedclothes covered [MASK] to the chin; his white beard was streaked with grease from the food he had eaten yesterday; his lips were purple, parted over snoring breath; his eyes were closed in their deep, dark sockets.
<name>Life</name>	Life	Lias	She had a hold on [MASK] now. He quarreled, and hid his tenderness for her in fault-finding, but she was satisfied; she bore her child gaily, as though a song hummed around her heart night and day, like a clock running down in music.
<name>Abraham Lincoln</name>	Abraham Lincoln	Lonzo	He was footsore—or else a cripple—and he looked like a beggar in gray rags. His cheeks were as thickly-bearded as [MASK]’s. He did not look like himself, but somehow she knew him.
<name>Pa</name>	Pa	Jasper	My back’s a- painin’ me so’s I caint think_No, don’t bother [MASK]. He’s got to work tomorrow. Anything ye want him to know, tell me, and I’ll tell him.”
<name>mouse</name>	mouse	Lonzo!—solemn	All day she would be raising her eyes to look for the loved figure, would be opening her mouth to call the little name. The child was the nigh like [MASK]-mouthed, quietlike, playing by herself for hours at a stretch, and never caring about another soul.
<name>Pa</name>	Pa	Lonzo	The calf fell to his knees and bawled; [MASK] stopped the bawling with a butcher-knife, slitting the throat. Then the blood came out. Unless you slit the throat, it will bleed on the inside.
<name>him</name>	him	Fairby	But I can’t bear her coming here in my own house, pushing herself in my face, daring me to do something about it. Now that she has come once, she’ll keep on coming, trying to wean [MASK] back to her with presents.
