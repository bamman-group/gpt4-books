<name>Lucius</name>	Lucius	Jemubhai	He might wear a silly white wig atop a dark face in the burning heat of summer and bring down his hammer on those phony rigged cases. Father below, son above, they’d be in charge of justice, complete. He shared his dream with [MASK].
<name>Arjuna</name>	Arjuna	Sai	He felt a lack in himself, despised his conformity to the ideas of the world even as he disagreed with them. A mongoose loped like water over the grass, matching the color of the evening, only its movement betraying it. Anger strained against [MASK]’s heart.
<name>Neil</name>	Neil	Jemu	In her attempt to cancel out one humiliation she had only succeeded in adding another. [MASK] picked up the package, fled to the deck, and threw it overboard. Didn’t his mother think of the inappropriateness of her gesture?
<name>Alfred</name>	Alfred	Biju	But although [MASK]’s letters traced a string of jobs, they said more or less the same thing each time except for the name of the establishment he was working for. His repetition provided a coziness, and the cook’s repetition of his son’s repetition double-knit the coziness.
<name>Ramu</name>	Ramu	Sai	Had they told us, we would have gone at once and said this is not the man ... we were not informed. . . . What do we owe you?” said the cook. But he was giving them the atta [MASK] had brought back . . .
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Gyan	It was, she knew herself, a matter of education to learn how to look at a woman, and worried that [MASK] wasn’t entirely aware of how lucky he was. Ear lobes downy as tobacco leaves, the tender substance of her hair, the transparent skin of the inner wrist. . . .
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Sai	He had told her the story of his brave ancestors in the army, but why didn’t he ever speak of his family here and now? In the back of her mind, [MASK] knew she should stay home, but she couldn’t stop herself.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jemubhai	As three siren blasts rent the air, [MASK]’s father, searching the deck, located his son. “Don’t worry,” he shouted. “You’ll do first class first.” But his tone of terror undid the reassurance of the words.
<name>He</name>	He	Biju	Sentences spilled out of the face along with juicy saliva. He was smiling and slavering over his information, gobbling and dispelling at the same time. But what was the false name then? [MASK] possessed no name at all for this black water. It was not his history.
<name>Estrella</name>	Estrella	Sai	“Good-bye,” said [MASK], to the perversities of the convent, the sweet sweety pastel angels and the bloodied Christ, presented together in disturbing contrast. Good-bye to the uniforms so heavy for a little girl, manly shouldered blazer and tie, black cow-hoof shoes.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Coward	[MASK]! How dare she? Who would marry her! “You think it’s brave of me to sit on your veranda? I can’t spend my life eating cheese toast, can I?” “I didn’t ask you to.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Noni	“We have to take these to the station for inspection.” “Why? Please sir,” said [MASK], trying to persuade him, “we’ve especially gone. . . . What will we read. . . . Stuck at home. ...
<name>Krishna</name>	Krishna	Krishna	Yes again— [MASK] and the gopis, village belle at the well. . . . And the menu— Oh no, not again— Yes, again— Tikka masala, tandoori grill, navrattan vegetable curry, dal makhni, pappadum.
<name>Roosevelt</name>	Roosevelt	Cambridge	And, encouraged by their “Ha ha,” tongue tingling and supple with alcohol, he leaped smoothly to a description of the house, the guns on the wall, and a certificate from [MASK] that they didn’t even know to be ashamed of.
<name>Abigail</name>	Abigail	Sai	In this climate, she would learn, untreated wood could be chewed up in a season. Eight -H- Across the hall from [MASK]’s room, the judge swallowed a Calmpose, for he found he was upset by his granddaughter’s arrival.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Sai	“Sorry,” said [MASK] again, mortified, but again he didn’t appear to have heard. For the first time his eyes rested directly upon her as if he were eating her alive in an orgy of the imagination—aha! At last the proof.
<name>Pixie</name>	Pixie	Huioor	She was strong. It was strong. She was no-nonsense. It was no-nonsense. They prevailed. It was Pixie who inspired the nightly ritual of listening to the radio. “Budhoo?” “[MASK].” “Good evening . . .
<name>Wedgwood</name>	Wedgwood	Wedgwood	There was [MASK] in the dining room cabinet and a jam jar on the sideboard, saved for its prettiness. “By appointment to Her Majesty the queen jam and marmalade manufacturers,” it read in gold under a coat of arms, supported by a crowned lion and a unicorn.
<name>He</name>	He	Biju	Haven’t you heard? ” “No. I haven’t had any letters for a long time.” “Why do you think?” [MASK] had blamed usual disruptions—bad weather, incompetence—for the break in his father’s correspondence.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Biju	“No.” “What are they doing?” “They are still standing and looking,” said [MASK] feelingbrave and excited by someone else’s misfortune. He was almost hopping. The men were shaking their heads unwilling to believe what they’d heard.
<name>Yipeee</name>	Yipeee	Biju	If his son were around, he would pay only the most cursory attention to her. She was just the alternative, the one to whom he gave his affection if he could not have [MASK], the real thing. “Yipeee,” she had shouted when she heard of his visa.
<name>Ram</name>	Ram	Saibaby	The cook had told her the stories: “A great shikari he was, [MASK]. He was very handsome, and he looked very brave and stylish on his horse. The villagers would call him if there was ever a man-eater around.”
<name>Gogol</name>	Gogol	Biju	[MASK] stood there in that dusty tepid soft sari night. Sweet drabness of home—he felt everything shifting and clicking into place around him, felt himself slowly shrink back to size, the enormous anxiety of being a foreigner ebbing—that unbearable arrogance and shame of the immigrant.
<name>Indira</name>	Indira	Lola	From the army mess kitchens came rumors of increasing vegetarianism. [MASK] often encountered young officers who were not only vegetarian, but also teetotalers. Even the top command. “I think to be in the army you should eat fish at least,” she said.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Biju	Is it my fault you don’t even clean the floor? YOU should have to pay ME for not cleaning, living like a pig. Am I telling YOU to live like a pig?” “[MASK]’s throbbing knee made him brave, reduced him to animal directness.
<name>Kashtanka</name>	Kashtanka	Mutt	The woman suddenly brightened and said to the man, “Sell that kind of dog and you can get a lot of money. . . .” [MASK] didn’t budge from the smell for a long, long time.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Gyan	Several minutes passed. Should she leave, should she stay? The door was pushed open farther, and a girl of about ten came out of the house with a cooking pot to scrub out with mud and gravel at the outside tap. “Does [MASK] live here?”
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Biju	After two weeks, [MASK] could walk with the aid of a stick. Two more weeks and the pain left him, but not, of course, the underlying green card problem. That continued to make him ill. His papers, his papers.
<name>Comrade</name>	Comrade	Uncle	The girl’s father was making money, so they said. . . . “Three kilos potatoes,” he told the girl in a voice unusually gentle for him. “What about rice? Is it clean?” “No, [MASK],” she said.
<name>AMY</name>	AMY	PITAJI	“HELLO? HELLO?” “[MASK], CAN YOU HEAR ME?” They retreated from each other again— Beep beep honk honk trr butt ock, the phone went dead and they were stranded in the distance that lay between them. “HELLO? HELLO?”—-into
<name>Rosa</name>	Rosa	Mutt	Even the police hadn’t bothered to find out the name of the man they had beaten and blinded. They would hardly bother to look for a dog. [MASK] was healthy, they noticed, when they pinched her through the sack; fat and ready to make them a little money.
<name>Shabnam</name>	Shabnam	Mutt	I did the accounts differently for fifty years I have cheated you in the accounts each and every day my money was dirty it was false sometimes I kicked [MASK] I didn’t take her for walks just sat by the side of the road smoked a bidi and came home
<name>Whiskers</name>	Whiskers	Mustafa	“By appointment to Her Majesty the queen jam and marmalade manufacturers,” it read in gold under a coat of arms, supported by a crowned lion and a unicorn. Then there was the cat, [MASK], a sooty hirsute fellow demonstrating a perfection of containment no amount of love or science could penetrate.
<name>poof</name>	poof	PHUT	There was one fuse box for the whole building, and if anyone turned on too many appliances or lights, [MASK], the entire electricity went, and the residents screamed to nobody, since there was nobody, of course, to hear them.
<name>Olga</name>	Olga	Nimi	If you have made your husband angry, go ask for forgiveness.” Please come home, my dear, my lovely girl. She had lived the rest of her life with a sister who had not married as successfully, as high up, as [MASK].
<name>Arjun</name>	Arjun	Biju	[MASK] couldn’t help but feel a flash of anger at his father for sending him alone to this country, but he knew he wouldn’t have forgiven his father for not trying to send him, either. Fifteen -<■<* *»
<name>He</name>	He	Gyan	What had she done? It would be her they would laugh at, a desperate girl who had walked all this way for unrequited love. [MASK] would be slapped on the back and cheered for his conquest. She would be humiliated.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Gyan	The air grew colder and the evening progressed. [MASK], who had been gathered up accidentally in the procession, who had shouted half facetiously, half in earnest, who had half played, half lived a part, found the fervor had affected him.
<name>Hitler</name>	Hitler	Dog	He told them what had happened and it made them laugh, a bit of humor in these frightening days. [MASK] died! The hilarity spread. They could barely stop laughing. In a place where people died without being given any attention.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sai	All the dishes were spinning steam furiously, and warm, food-scented clouds con- densed on [MASK]’s face. When the steam cleared a little, she had another look at her grandfather at the far end of the table and the dog on another chair by his side.
<name>Adresses</name>	Adresses	Biju	Sometimes someone came popping around a corner again, or on the subway, then they vanished again. Adresses, phone numbers did not hold. The emptiness [MASK] felt returned to him over and over, until eventually he made sure not to let friendships sink deep anymore.
<name>Mrs. Phelps</name>	Mrs. Phelps	Lola	“Calm down, madam,” the policeman said to [MASK], offending her still more. “If there is nothing in your books, we will return them.” The red-hot library books were taken carefully away.
<name>Anjali</name>	Anjali	Sai	“One stupid thing after another from your mouth.” “Here I bring you up as my own child with so much love and just see how you are talking to me . . .,” he began. That night [MASK] sat and stared into the mirror.
<name>Fifi</name>	Fifi	Mutt	“How will you?” “Tell her that I promise. I will find the dog. Don’t worry at all. Be sure and tell her. I will find [MASK] and bring her to the house.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Gyan	we will be at their mercy. . . . Gone crazy with your father away and your mother too weak to control you,” she glowered at her daughter-in-law, glad of an excuse to do so. Locked [MASK] up with a lock and key.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Biju	Of the judge’s journey, of the cook’s journey, of [MASK]’s. Of the globe twirling on its axis. And she felt a glimmer of strength. The congress of hopeful frogs continued to sing, even as a weak whiskey light showed in the east as the rain slowed.
<name>Kiran</name>	Kiran	Bose	“Time passes, things change,” said the judge, feeling claustrophobia and embarrassment. “But what is in the past remains unchanged, doesn’t it?” “I think it does change. The present changes the past. Looking back you do not find what you left behind, [MASK].”
<name>Naga</name>	Naga	Nepalis	Lot of trouble over there . . “Why?” “[MASK] making trouble . . . very troublesome people. . . “Strikes?” “Much worse, bhai, not only strikes, the whole hillside is shut down.” “It is?”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Biju	At this moment, a fear overtook him that he might never see his son again— The letters that had come all these years were only his own hope writing to him. [MASK] was just a habit of thought. He didn’t exist. Could he?
<name>Chava</name>	Chava	SaalaMachoot	He received blank faces, some angry laughter. “[MASK]. . . what does he think? We’re going to look for his dog?” People were insulted. “At a time like this. We can’t even eat!”
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Lola	Why don’t you go away?” “Why don’t you open the door?” “Go away I tell you, go join the boys in the street whom you are always defending.” “[MASK], open the door.” “No.”
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Noni	She reached for a cream horn. “Naughty girl,” she said to herself, her voice replete with gloating. “Obviously the Nepalis are worried,” said [MASK]. “They’ve been here, most of them, several generations.
<name>Rajinder</name>	Rajinder	Shukria	Fortune cookies, they checked, chili sauce, soy sauce, duck sauce, chopsticks, napkins, plastic spoons knives forks. “Dhanyawad. [MASK]. Thank you. Extra tip. You should buy topi-muffler-gloves to be ready for the winter.”
<name>Tenzin</name>	Tenzin	Lola	their admiring eyes on the same monk in the market. . . the start of a grand friendship. . . . “Everyone says poor Tibetans—poor Tibetans,” [MASK] continued, “but what brutal people, barely a Dalai Lama survived—they were all popped off before their time.
<name>Shotguns</name>	Shotguns	Chtch	They weren’t even locked away: they were mounted at the end of the hall above a dusty row of painted green and brown duck decoys. “[MASK], all rusted. Why don’t you take care of them?” But they were pleased and their bravado bloomed.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Gyan	She waited, read Wuthering Heights twice over, each time the potency of the writing imparting a wild animal feeling to her gut— and twice she read the last pages—still [MASK] didn’t come. A stick insect as big as a small branch climbed the steps.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Nimi	“Too much shame,” [MASK] said, waking from her stupor. She could take it for herself—in fact it would be like a balm, a dark place to hide herself—but for her family—well, the thought of their shame on her behalf was too much to bear.
<name>Arjun</name>	Arjun	Gyan	A few moments more, the apology turned from sincere to insincere, and he was angry at himself for giving in. [MASK] went on to the canteen, sunset doing a mad Kali as he walked, and once again he felt the stir of purity.
<name>He</name>	He	Bose	“But you said the mutton wasn’t tender.” “Yes, I already told you, didn’t I?” The food arrived. [MASK] made a valiant effort to retract and start over: “Just found a new cook myself,” he said.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Sai	[MASK] chased them down again, put them back in the can, rushed to the toilet, and flushed them down, but even then they resurfaced, doing a mad-scrabble swim in the toilet bowl. Remembrance, now authentic, shone from the cook’s eyes.
<name>Lucien</name>	Lucien	Mutt	Soon all the judge had worked so hard to separate would soften and envelop him in its nightmare, and the barrier between this life and eternity would in the end, no doubt, be just another such failing construct. [MASK] followed him to his room.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Noni	I do think it’s the best rice, don’t you?” “Well, I don’t like to agree with you, but maybe you have a point,” [MASK] conceded. “After all, why isn’t he writing of where he lives now?
<name>Comrade</name>	Comrade	Aunty	Is that what you’re worried about? The police won’t touch rich people, only people like us, but if you say anything we will be forced to take action against „ 99 you. “What action?” “You’ll find out, [MASK].”
<name>Raj</name>	Raj	Jemubhai	There he was, crawling into a tiny tent to the side, and there was [MASK] reclining like a king in a bed carved out of teak, hung with mosquito netting. “Bed tea,” the cook would shout. “Baaad tee.”
<name>Saladin</name>	Saladin	Noni	half I was bewildered,” said [MASK], “by these Christian ideas of confession and forgiveness—they place the burden of the crime on the victim! If nothing can undo the misdeed, then why should sin be undone?”
<name>Lucero</name>	Lucero	Mutt	Human life was stinking, corrupt, and meanwhile there were beautiful creatures who lived with delicacy on the earth without doing anyone any harm. “ We should be dying,” the judge almost wept. The world had failed [MASK]. It had failed beauty
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Biju	“Another day another dollar, penny saved is penny earned, no pain no gain, business is business, gotta do what ya gotta do.” These axioms were a luxury unavailable to [MASK], of course, but he repeated them anyway, enjoying the cheerful words and the moment of camaraderie.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Biju	“How will I take my things?” “Leave it here. Safekeeping.” They laughed. “We’ll send them to you later.” “No,” said [MASK], terrified by the realization that he was being robbed. “Go!”
<name>Napoleon</name>	Napoleon	Krishna	In its own way it was 293 +* like a prostitute—it showed too much. The book in his hand had a cover of [MASK] on the battlefield in lurid colors, the same ones used in movie posters.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Noni	Quite suddenly, everyone was using the word insurgency. Twenty-one -M- +> “They have a point,” said [MASK], “maybe not their whole point, but I’d say half to three-quarters of their point.” “Nonsense.”
<name>John</name>	John	Biju	Every now and then [MASK] saw it scratching in a homey manner in the dirt and felt a pang for village life. “ Chkchkchk,” he called to it, but it ran away immediately, flustered in the endearing way of a plain girl, shy and convinced of the attractions of virtue.
<name>He</name>	He	Gyan	By now, with the conversation disintegrating, his sense of humor began to return to him, and [MASK] began to giggle, his eyes to soften, and she could see his expression shift. They were falling back into familiarity, into common ground, into the dirty gray.
<name>Arturo</name>	Arturo	Saeed	The country recognized something in [MASK], he in it, and it was a mutual love affair. Ups and downs, sometimes more sour than sweet, maybe, but nonetheless, beyond anything the INS could imagine, it was an old-fashioned romance.
<name>Macbeth</name>	Macbeth	Biju	Out of the sewage [MASK] chased a line of pigs with black watermarks across their bellies, ran after them in jubilation. “Hup hup,” he shouted. The crows that had been sitting on the pigs’ backs scrambled into indignant flight, having to start up backward.
<name>Ramanujan</name>	Ramanujan	Sai	He felt a sinister urge to catch the boy off guard. “He is a science student,” said [MASK]. “So what of that? Scientists are not barred from poetry, or are they?” “Whatever happened to the well-rounded education?”
<name>cook</name>	cook	Sheru	“That [MASK] kicked the bucket after forty years of service. The new one is untrained, but he came cheap because of that. I got out the recipe books and read them out as he copied it all down in Bengali.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Jemu	The crowd on the shore became flotsam churning at the tide’s hem: scallops and starbursts, petticoat ruffles, rubbishy wrappings and saliva flecks, fish tails and tears. . . . Soon it vanished in the haze. [MASK] watched his father disappear.
<name>Lucia</name>	Lucia	Sai	“Poor thing, but what can we do?” The nuns tsk-tsked because they knew [MASK] was a special problem. The older nuns remembered her mother and the fact that the judge paid for her keep but never visited.
<name>Chava</name>	Chava	Aunty	“Give us a calendar then.” “Only one, [MASK]?” “All right, well, two.” “But you know how we need money. . . .” They invested in three calendars and two cassettes. Still the boys did not leave.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Sai	[MASK]’s breath flew from her nostrils in drifts, and the diagram of a giant squid constructed from scraps of information, scientists’ dreams, sank entirely into the murk. She shut the magazine and walked out into the garden.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Mutt	They didn’t see or hear a thing. The trespassers lifted [MASK] up, bound her with rope, and put her in a sack. The man slung the sack over his shoulders, and they carried her through town without drawing any attention to themselves.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Sai	[MASK] looked far older in some ways, far younger in some. Younger, no doubt, because she’d lived such a sheltered life and older, no doubt, because she spent all her time with retired people.
<name>Arjun</name>	Arjun	Gyan	“Why would that girl come all the way then? For no reason? Stay away from those people,” his grandmother growled, turning to [MASK]. “What trouble you’ll get yourself into . . . and we’re a poor family .. .
<name>Meera</name>	Meera	Sai	Fresh roti, fresh butter, fresh milk still warm from the buffalo. . . .” They had stayed up late. They hadn’t noticed [MASK], then aged thirteen, staring from her bedroom window, jealous of the cook’s love for his son.
<name>Both</name>	Both	Bose	[MASK]. They had similar inadequate clothes, similar forlornly empty rooms, similar poor native’s trunks. A look of recognition had passed between them at first sight, but also the assurance that they wouldn’t reveal one another’s secrets, not even to each other.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Biju	“What what, what did they say?” [MASK], like half the room, didn’t understand, but he saw from the ones who did, who were running, pleased to be given a head start, what they should do.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Jemubhai	[MASK] got drunk that night and not out of joy. Without seeing his child, he was sure what it would look like: red as a blister, going off like a kettle, spilling liquids, waves of heat and anger emanating from it.
<name>Balram</name>	Balram	Biju	Many bags didn’t arrive and [MASK] overheard a fight at the Air France counter where the passengers had to fill out lost-luggage forms: “They are only giving compensation to nonresident Indians and foreigners, not to Indian nationals, WHY?”
<name>Kafka</name>	Kafka	Babyji	“What is going on!” shouted the judge. A statement, not a question, that was to be responded to by silence. “Nothing,” he said, beyond caring, “what can be going on? [MASK] went to sleep.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bose	There they had thought they were superior, putting on airs, and they were just the same—weren’t they?—as the rest. The more the judge’s mouth tightened, the more [MASK] seemed determined to drive the conversation until it broke. “Best days of my life,” he said.
<name>Ram</name>	Ram	Manubhai	The usual stories: jealous husband cutting off wife’s nose or falsified record claiming death of a widow who was still alive so her property might be divided among greedy descendants. He trained the poor, the desperate, the scoundrels, rehearsed them strictly: “What do you know about [MASK]’s buffalo?”
<name>Beatrice</name>	Beatrice	Noni	Their house is still made of mud with a thatch roof.” [MASK] didn’t think this was suitable information for the cook to share. It was important to draw the lines properly between classes or it harmed everyone on both sides of the great divide.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Lola	One of the best book I’ve ever read.” “Oh, I don’t know,” [MASK] said, “I think he’s strange. Stuck in the past. ... he has not progressed. Colonial neurosis, he’s never freed himself from it.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Sai	So, it was usually [MASK] who walked to the shuttered market searching for a shop with a half open back door signaling quick secret business, or a cardboard sign propped at the window of a hut of someone selling a handful of peanuts or a few eggs.
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	Lola	But [MASK] was too dizzy to listen. Her suitcases were stuffed with Marmite, Oxo bouillon cubes, Knorr soup packets, After Eights, daffodil bulbs, and renewed supplies of Boots cucumber lotion and Marks and Spencer underwear—the essence, quintessence, of En-glishness as she understood it.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Bose	A look of recognition had passed between them at first sight, but also the assurance that they wouldn’t reveal one another’s secrets, not even to each other. [MASK] was different from the judge in one crucial aspect, though. He was an optimist.
<name>Geoffrey</name>	Geoffrey	Bose	After several undecided minutes had passed, [MASK] broke the spell by asking, “Rissoles?” That might salvage the evening. “Oh no,” the waiter said, shaking his head and smiling insolently. “No, that you cannot get.”
<name>Ashoke</name>	Ashoke	Poresh	“Very bright boy, family very poor, please look after him, he already has a visa, will be arriving. . . . Please find a job for [MASK]. In fact, even his brother is ready to go. Help them.
<name>Josephine</name>	Josephine	Noni	[MASK] had recovered her confidence only when it was too late. Life had passed her by and in those days things had to happen fast for a girl, or they didn’t happen at all. “Don’t you want to meet people your own age?”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Sai	“How dare they behave this way to you,” said [MASK], trying to overcome the gap between them as they stood together surveying the mess the police had left in his hut. “But what kind of investigation would it be, then?”
