<name>Barry</name>	Barry	Raleigh	“Of c-c-ourse, I love you. Your uncle [MASK] loves you, too.” “But do you love me better?” “Better than your Mama? What kind of question is that?” “No,” I said.
<name>Kmart</name>	Kmart	Davison	This money was hard-earned and smelled like it. My mother’s own savings were meager, as she’d tended to spend most of her money at [MASK]’s, opening her pay envelope right there in the store and paying down layaways.
<name>Dad</name>	Dad	James	“She has two working parents,” my mother pointed out. [MASK] didn’t say anything. My mother sat down beside him on the sofa. This she said softly: “The Saturday Science Academy makes allowances for female heads of household, you know.”
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Dana	You got another man you didn’t tell me about?” He laughed, following her voice into the den. “[MASK]!” he called, angling his voice toward my closed bedroom door. “I’m in the den, too,” I said.
<name>Dean</name>	Dean	Ronalda	“I’ll blow you a shotgun.” I put my face next to hers and she blew the smoke right into my mouth. “It’s not that I don’t want to go home,” [MASK] said. “For a visit, right?”
<name>Al Green</name>	Al Green	James	When he sang, “Makes me do for love what I would not do,” my mother would close her eyes, and [MASK] would touch her eyelids. On those summer nights, my parents lived in a space all by themselves, breathing only each other’s air.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Dana	I mean, somebody, but nobody lately. Most of it was when I was in the tenth grade, and one time last summer.” “Don’t get all sad,” [MASK] said. “You just have a history, that’s all.
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Dana	“We are supposed to be in a lock-in at my church.” [MASK] put her hand in her hair and then stopped. She felt her ear. “I lost my earring,” she said.
<name>The mother</name>	The mother	Ronalda	My mother smiled and touched my shoulder. “Whatever you did, you must have represented us well.” She wiggled her feet in the basin, soaking the carpet again. “Keep your fingers crossed. Sometimes change is good.” [MASK] wasn’t worried about college applications.
<name>Danny</name>	Danny	Gwen	[MASK] followed my eyes and looked into my astonished face. “It was a gift.” Since I was the one who called my father and told him to come to the house, it would have made sense for me to unlock the door and let him in.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Gwen	[MASK] disappeared into the small room. I could imagine how close they must be, jammed into such a cramped space. What were they saying to each other? By now, my father was out of the car, arguing with the woman driving the Escort.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Dana	My mother’s voice was thin as plastic wrap. “Hello there, [MASK].” I pushed the dress aside like a heavy curtain to see my lost friend standing beside her mother. They were both dressed like schoolteachers—pencil skirts, button-down tops.
<name>Objection</name>	Objection	Michael	One of the judges, a heavyset man with processed hair, said, “How did a pretty girl like you get so interested in science?” The woman judge said, “[MASK], that’s out of line.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	James	“I’m in the den, too,” I said. “Glad I didn’t wake anybody up.” [MASK] wasn’t wearing his uniform. This evening he was wearing jeans and a crisp blue shirt. In his arms was a large white box.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	James	You know [MASK] is going to just move in with them. When I was coming up, people used to say ‘It’s a mighty poor rat ain’t got but one hole.’ ” Crowding me in my own bed, my mother talked her greatest fears aloud.
<name>Officer Reynolds</name>	Officer Reynolds	Gwen	“So,” [MASK] said, “what can I help you with? I’m on my way to work, but I can make time for you.” “Don’t call the police on my father,” I said. She smiled, a little.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Gwendolyn	“You can’t turn me away,” [MASK] said, reaching to take the roaring dryer away from my mother. “Turn that thing off and listen to me.” “Hey,” I said. “Don’t touch my mother.”
<name>he</name>	he	Clarence	“Don’t you want me?” she whispered. Finally [MASK] spoke. “Hell yeah, I want you. This just isn’t the way I thought this was going to happen. But okay, we can get engaged. We’re engaged right now.
<name>Tracy</name>	Tracy	Dana	She squeezed a little on the tips of her fingers and dabbed the teardrop of skin inside the keyhole of her shirt. “You so crazy,” [MASK] said, taking the lotion and doing the same thing. “You want some?” “No,” I said.
<name>Ally</name>	Ally	Dana	We are better people.” She was so near the photo now that her lipstick marked the glass. “Come on,” I said, taking her by her arm. “Let’s just go.” “You’re fine, aren’t you, [MASK]?
<name>Maya</name>	Maya	Ronalda	“Yeah,” I said. “You two want to go outside and see the cars?” [MASK] spoke up. “No, we are not into all of that.” She stood and held out her hand.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Dana	[MASK] said. “My mama is already on her way. We could both ride with her.” I shook my head. “My dad is going to want to see about the Lincoln.” She opened the door, stepping onto the asphalt parking lot.
<name>Mrs. Forrest</name>	Mrs. Forrest	Chaurisse	Are you okay, young lady?” “Yes, sir.” Her voice was subdued as a whipped child’s. “[MASK] says you’re waiting for your m-mother. Is that correct?” There was no response from the bathroom.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Chaurisse	She walks around looking like a streetwalker. I don’t see you saying anything to her.” My mother looked at me sharply. We had gone surveilling at the JCPenney outlet the week before. [MASK] was wearing a halter top that was too small for her.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Verne	Sometimes one woman would be brave enough to ask the question that was on everyone’s mind. The asker was either the oldest or youngest person in the shop. “He’s not funny, is he, [MASK]?”
<name>Lolita</name>	Lolita	Dana	It was hard to explain this thing I felt. It wasn’t like daughters are supposed to expect some sort of exclusive relationship from their fathers, but what he had with [MASK] was an infidelity. “We didn’t even know you,” I said.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Marcus	Sometimes at the parties, [MASK] called me his “girlfriend” and even kissed me in front of everyone. I’d sit on his lap and drink from his cup. Other times, he just acknowledged me with secret winks and smiles over the heads of his guests.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	James	[MASK] returned to his two-story house with a heavy heart, to be sure. My father is not a monster, but he still had a home to go to and a woman there to fix his plate for dinner.
<name>Bev</name>	Bev	Ronalda	At the bottom of the poster, just under her knee-high leather boots, was a caption: think about IT. I pointed to the picture. “I don’t get it. Think about what?” “All men like to look at pictures of naked women,” [MASK] said.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Chaurisse	This was one of the basic rules of being an outside child. I thought about the flyer posted on my bedroom mirror. The kids in the pictures held beakers over Bunsen burners. “Well, I am sure [MASK] will enjoy herself this summer.”
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	James	She’s my daughter. You’re my family. I need to see what’s in the bag.” “There’s nothing in the bag,” I said. “There’s something in the bag,” [MASK] said. “Let me see it.”
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Raleigh	“I said, ‘I don’t ever want nobody driving me around. Whoever is doing the driving is really the one in control.’ “[MASK] looked at me like, ‘You just now figuring that out?’ Your uncle is a very intelligent man.
<name>Daddy</name>	Daddy	Gwen	He took my mother’s hands and held them to his mouth. “What do you say, [MASK]?” “You haven’t said that you love me,” my mother said. “Why are you doing this? You don’t love me.”
<name>Elvira</name>	Elvira	James	“[MASK],” she said, “let’s go get married. Make an honest woman out of me.” Just moments earlier, he had been all motion, but now it was like somebody had pumped him through with embalming fluid.
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Dana	“All this back talk. You and [MASK] really are sisters.” Every time she said the word sister, it felt like a tease. I shifted on the couch. “Would you rather sit here?”
<name>the receptionist</name>	the receptionist	Dana	I’m an attendant.” I spoke to her slowly, like she didn’t speak English. “Your dad is here?” This was from [MASK]. “Yeah,” I said. “You two want to go outside and see the cars?”
<name>Auntie</name>	Auntie	Raleigh	This place is all booked up.” [MASK] said, “Take my keys. You two can sit in the car. Make sure you turn on the air.” My mother took my hand and smiled. “You look like a wild animal.”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Dana	What kind of question is that?” “No,” I said. “Do you love me better than [MASK]?” Now, it was his turn to back away from the glass. “What’s the p-p-point of asking that?”
<name>Captain Morgan</name>	Captain Morgan	James	[MASK] smelled sweet, like liquor and cola. To this day and for the rest of my life, I will always have a soft spot for a man with rum on his breath. I think about the world and the way that things take place and in what order.
<name>Janine</name>	Janine	Dana	“My mother works hard,” [MASK] said, “but she never had a party or anything close to it. Do you know that?” “Lean back if you want this shampoo,” I said, smothering the urge to defend my father’s crazy idea.
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Dana	[MASK], you don’t have chick nor child. Why stay with some boyfriend that can’t keep his hands to himself?” “You just don’t want me to have my own life.” “You are not seeing this boy anymore. End of discussion.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Ronalda	“They used her like a maid, you know what I’m saying? You never saw her without that little boy on her hip.” [MASK] loved this boyfriend and was having some problems and she couldn’t just ignore him. “He was in need!”
<name>my mother</name>	my mother	Laverne	I could have laughed at her. After all these years, she couldn’t quite believe that she and her mother had won. I hadn’t seen my father since the day he and [MASK] renewed their vows at the big party at the Hilton twelve years ago.
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Ronalda	It wasn’t that I forgot my troubles, it’s just that they didn’t trouble me quite so much. One afternoon, [MASK] had sent me on my way with a small paper bag filled with peanuts and jelly beans.
<name>He</name>	He	Dana	[MASK] said, “She can’t help us fix the tire.” “No,” I said. “The rim is all bent up by now anyway. We’re going to have to get a tow.” “Towed to where?”
<name>Dad</name>	Dad	Marcus	I loved being displayed on his arm, held up for everyone to see. I looked out of my bedroom window, expecting to see [MASK]’s two-door Jetta, but instead I found the good Lincoln, the newer one that was really navy blue if you looked at it close-up.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Ronalda	It wasn’t the greatest quality, more seeds than anything, but we borrowed enough to roll a slender joint, which we shared in her stepmother’s office after jamming a towel under the door. [MASK] took hard pulls, trying to get buzzed quick.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	James	[MASK] looked into his mother’s face. “W-w-what d-d-do you need to talk to her about? Why c-c-can’t we just visit together?” He went to the window and swiveled the wand to open the blinds.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Dana	“Wait,” [MASK] said following him. “Please fix our car. I can pay.” She stood on her tiptoes, lengthening her body so she could slide her fingers into the front pocket of her tight Gloria Vanderbilts.
<name>Mother</name>	Mother	Gwen	And there was her own sweaty odor, which was the same as the money’s. “[MASK],” he said, “listen. I have worked something out.” My mother didn’t answer, turning herself toward the wall with her body curled around the box of money.
<name>John</name>	John	Raleigh	“But you are my husband’s brother. There’s a different way you love your brother-in-law.” “You are not my brother’s wife,” said [MASK]. “He is not my brother and you are not his wife.”
<name>Cheryl</name>	Cheryl	Dana	[MASK] entered the convenience store again, speaking to the clerk, moving her hands too much. Maybe she was on drugs or something. She was like a pinball machine—all energy, lights, and percussion. She zigzagged out of the store holding a silver key bolted to a wooden block.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Raleigh	Then she touched the curls that spilled over onto my shoulder. [MASK], my father of record, was waiting for me in the lobby of the principal’s office. He looked terrible; his pale skin, thin under the eyes, showed purple veins.
<name>my brother</name>	my brother	James	“You’re not going to let us in? Why you blocking the door?” He bumped my father with his chuckle, but [MASK] didn’t join in. “Come in,” I said, hoping to sound relaxed like my mother, standing to the side.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Dana	“I’m surprised you didn’t run off the road.” “I didn’t steer against the swerve,” I said, but he didn’t look up at me. “Can you fix it?” [MASK] squatted down beside him.
<name>Granny</name>	Granny	Ronalda	She corrected her eyeliner with her finger and frowned. “Are you going to leave?” “I don’t know,” I said. [MASK] gave a deep sigh like she had already seen everything in the world. “You know what my mama says?
<name>Sula</name>	Sula	Ronalda	“Do you have a brother?” [MASK] asked. I said no. “If you have a brother, it’s the worst thing. If your mama has a boy to care for, she will show you the kind of love she is capable of.
<name>Chris</name>	Chris	Dana	Maybe [MASK] was hoping that she could get him to be her father. So many kids, black kids especially, are hungry in their hearts for a daddy. You don’t know how blessed you are.” “But it was weirder than that,” I told her.
<name>Babbitt</name>	Babbitt	Raleigh	“We don’t need no cucumber water. What we need here is to have a conversation. [MASK], you got eyes in your h-head. What we n-n-need to do is s-s-it down and talk.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Ronalda	[MASK] and I had planned to apply together, but she ended up making better money taking care of her little brother. After three interviews, I was offered the chance to spin cotton candy onto paper cones for a nickel over minimum wage.
<name>She</name>	She	Chaurisse	I stared hard until I found something that proved that we were kin—stray flecks of pigmentation on the whites of her eyes. My own eyes showed the very same imperfection. I must have lingered a little too long, because [MASK] felt the need to explain herself.
<name>Driver</name>	Driver	Raleigh	“ ‘The boss is the one that pays you,’ [MASK] said. “ ‘But every time they get in the car with me, they are putting their life in my hands.’ “ ‘That’s true,’ your mama said.”
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Laverne	You can’t ask us to pretend that we don’t. When I came to the Pink Fox that day, I did not ask [MASK] to leave her husband. I did not ask you to live without your father. I just came to the shop and showed myself.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Marcus	I smiled like nothing was wrong, as though I was the same girl I was ten minutes ago. But in truth, I was different now, burning and anointed. Think about It Through [MASK], I found myself a best friend.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	James	“No,” I said. “You’re wrong.” “I’m not,” [MASK] said softly. “You’re scared of me. I’ve been a good father to you. You have no cause to be scared of me like that.’”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Chaurisse	As she pressed her hands down on my shoulders, traces of cigarette smoke lingered in her tumbly hair. I reached out for it. “Her name is [MASK],” my mother said again. “She’s a little girl, just like you are.”
<name>Mae Mobley</name>	Mae Mobley	Laverne	Her skin was thick and stippled like the peel of an orange and her eyes were murky. The saddest thing was her hair. Someone, probably [MASK], had arranged it in a dozen pin curls, as though she were preparing to go to a party later that evening.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Chaurisse	I just came to the shop and showed myself. You have been showing yourself to me for every day of your life. I can’t believe how arrogant you are, [MASK]. I have been good to you your entire life, so give me some respect.”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	James	“Yeah, that’s his car. I helped his daddy pick it out.” We heard the horn. It was a queer sound. People weren’t yet used to foreign cars. “He’s just going to blow the horn like that?” [MASK] said.
<name>Pop</name>	Pop	Chaurisse	“We didn’t even know you,” I said. “You know me, [MASK]. How can you say you don’t know me. When have you ever needed a daddy and I wasn’t there? Half of your friends don’t even have a daddy.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Gracie	“Back before you were born, he had a wife named [MASK] and he loved her to pieces. I mean, he was crazy about her. It’s the kind of love that most people never experience. L-o-v-e.” I nodded.
<name>Dad</name>	Dad	Raleigh	“Don’t look at me like I am an orphan. My mother’s not dead,” I blurted. “She’s a nurse and she takes good care of me. I was taking the AP exam in biology when [MASK] pulled me out of school to come up here.
<name>her</name>	her	Chaurisse	That is why my mother and I shouldn’t be pitied. Yes, we have suffered, but we never doubted that we enjoyed at least one peculiar advantage when it came to what really mattered: I knew about [MASK]; she didn’t know about me.
<name>Willy Wonka</name>	Willy Wonka	James	I had gone on my own and spent most of my time riding the glass elevator all the way to the twenty-third floor and then back down again. Looking at the city lights, I wondered if [MASK] had other children like me.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Dana	Every time I wanted to hang out, she made me beg. And I did. Every single time. “You’re not sorry,” I was speaking to [MASK], but I couldn’t look away from the paper in my hands.
<name>Mrs. Avery</name>	Mrs. Avery	Raleigh	Y-y-y-you’re about to b-b-b-bust out of it.” “I was going to wear a jacket,” I said. “She’s just growing up,” [MASK] said. “Both the girls are growing up.”
<name>my daughter</name>	my daughter	Flora	I spoke my daughter’s name over and over in my head to keep my soul from shattering. Finally, I pulled the car into the parking lot of a large church. I went to the backseat and unhooked [MASK] from her safety seat.
<name>Prince Charles</name>	Prince Charles	James	I said that maybe it means there was a kind of trust between them. I love my mother, but we tend to see things a little bit differently. The point is that [MASK]’s marriage was never hidden from us.
<name>Lula</name>	Lula	Dana	“No,” [MASK] said. “Why did you call him? I told you I was getting help. Why couldn’t you give me ten minutes?” Beating her hands on her thighs in the gas-station light, she didn’t look silver, she looked crazy.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Laverne	She laid out my clothes each night until I was in the fifth grade but never looked quite at home doing it. There was always the feeling that she was doing me a favor. [MASK] was the kind of mother you never had to say thank you to.
<name>my parents</name>	my parents	Dana	I wasn’t crying. I felt my face to make sure. She spoke with a grand tone, like there was someone watching. I swiveled to see the whole room, but there was no one else there except the pictures of [MASK].
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Marcus	According to the clock on the microwave oven, [MASK] was ten minutes late already; for once I was grateful for his habit of rarely keeping his promises. There was even the possibility that he wouldn’t show up at all. His life was busy, and he had many friends and obligations.
<name>Miss Bingley</name>	Miss Bingley	Gwendolyn	She looked at it slowly before glancing up and taking a breath, surveying the room before touching her hair. [MASK] licked her lips and although she meant her face to be rigid and stern, I know I saw a flicker of delight tickle her cheeks as she prepared to read.
<name>Uncle Hammer</name>	Uncle Hammer	James	“She doesn’t need controlling,” my mother said. “She needs something else.” “Legitimacy,” I said. “You are legitimate,” my mother said. “What’s in the paper sack?” [MASK] asked, reaching for it.
<name>Sister</name>	Sister	Dana	She’s the one who needs it most.” My mother looked up from her work. “I got prayers enough for everybody.” [MASK] picked up the edge of her cape and dabbed at her nose. “I am going to miss her so much.
<name>John Coffey</name>	John Coffey	James	She asked him the question again, grateful in a strange way to be able to speak any words at all. “[MASK], did you rape me?” From his bed, there was a spasm of movement. “No, m-ma’am,” he said.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Marcus	“Well, [MASK] is under stress, too. He wants to apply to college.” “Yes, your father hit me, but I had a baby. I just had to make it work. And your father is not a violent man.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Laverne	“You got yourself a nice coat. You girls are matching.” I nodded. [MASK] wasn’t pretty or showy in the way that my mother was, but she seemed more motherly to me. Her hands looked like they were born to make sandwiches.
<name>he</name>	he	Dana	The light bounced off her makeup, making her face look like a jack-o’-lantern, lit from the inside. “Twenty bucks,” she said. “I can’t do nothing if your sister won’t give me the jack.” “She’s not my sister,” [MASK] said.
<name>His wife</name>	His wife	Grade	“But how come he did it? Why did that God guy cheat on [MASK]?” My mother switched on the turn signal and sighed. “All I am saying is that if you are a wife, act like a wife and not a two-dollar whore.”
<name>Gwen</name>	Gwen	Dana	My father struggled. I felt sorry for him sometimes, even at a moment like this. “[MASK] needs to know science, too.” “Gw-w-wen,” he said, “why do you k-k-keep doing this?
<name>she</name>	she	Ronalda	I don’t want to talk about it.” “I’m sorry,” I said, even though [MASK] didn’t sound exactly sad. It was more like she was angry with me for mentioning it. “Can you show me around some more?”
<name>Desdemona</name>	Desdemona	Gwen	He said, “[MASK], you deserve something better than this. You deserve to be somebody’s only wife.” She didn’t take him seriously at first. She said, “Pick up your hand, I can see all your cards and that takes the fun out of it.”
<name>him</name>	him	Marcus	She touched my forehead and then my ears. “Where are your earrings?” “In my jewelry box,” I told her. “You never wear them anymore,” she said sadly. But I did. I wore them when I was with [MASK].
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	James	I like cassettes.” “It’s n-n-new,” he said. “I got the job first,” I said. “I’ve even been fitted for a uniform.” “Things happen,” [MASK] said. “Things happen.
<name>Annemarie</name>	Annemarie	Dana	I pushed the dress aside like a heavy curtain to see my lost friend standing beside her mother. They were both dressed like schoolteachers—pencil skirts, button-down tops. If I didn’t know them, I would think they were missionaries for some sort of strict religion. “[MASK]!”
<name>Uncle Ben</name>	Uncle Ben	Raleigh	Your uncle is a special case, you know.” I said I knew what he was talking about. “Truth of the matter is that it was [MASK] who gave me the idea of starting my own business, but I don’t want to get ahead of myself.
<name>Abby</name>	Abby	Ronalda	She never comes down here.” [MASK] opened one of the desk drawers, revealing eight strawberry wine coolers. “My secret stash. You want one?” She gave me a bottle; I screwed off the top and handed it back to her.
<name>justice</name>	justice	James	“This is about fairness, [MASK],” my mother would say, indicating to me that what was once a conversation had now morphed into “words.” I could watch my father’s neck bloat a little, as his defenses gathered there.
<name>Bella's</name>	Bella's	Flora	I was there even earlier—I never want her to wonder where I am. She and I were headed toward the car, when I noticed a blue Lincoln in the space beside mine. I held [MASK]’s hand tighter and ignored the itching in my throat.
