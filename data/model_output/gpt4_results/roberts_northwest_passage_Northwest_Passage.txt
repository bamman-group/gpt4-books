<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Reynolds	“They’re not interested. Mostly, too, I’ve worked on a series. Perhaps some day someone—a collector or an institution—will prefer a series to scattered pictures.” “Oh, I’m quite sure of it,” [MASK] said.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Potter	I took her to the side of the ship, then, away from the noise and jostling of the crowded deck, where good-byes were being said and last stores hustled to the hatchways; and I told her— rather dryly, I’m afraid—that [MASK] was her father.
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	McNott	Over us loomed the grassy ramparts, on which stood sentries and soldiers from the garrison. “Oh,” I said, “I’m sure it’s not as bad as you make out.” [MASK]’s face grew purple. “You are, are you?
<name>Ysonde</name>	Ysonde	McNott	Hoping the Princess had found a larger target than a rabbit, I scanned each distant thicket in the direction she had taken, thinking she might come out and signal to me; but nothing moved upon that glaring white expanse, except a slowly-undulating layer of blue smoke from [MASK]’s fire.
<name>Deerslayer</name>	Deerslayer	Rogers	These red buggers wrap a piece of deer’s belly around a stick and think it’s good! They sleep in a houseful of smoke and think it’s good!” “Can you remember the trail?” [MASK] asked. “Remember it?”
<name>Magdalena</name>	Magdalena	Dunbar	[MASK] pushed another woman close to the drum. She was about thirty-five, and white, but dressed in every respect like the Indian squaws. Her hair was gray and stringy: her back bent: her face dirty and streaked with tears.
<name>John</name>	John	Langdon	I said; but before I could go on, her clenched hand opened within mine pleadingly. “Oh, promise me you’ll tear it up! Promise me you’ll bum it!” “You don’t understand. It’s beautiful!” “Please, [MASK]!
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Avery	When the four of us worked back along our trail, we found the stand of spruces that [MASK] had noted, two hundred yards to the rear; and wherever there are spruces, there are blow-downs of dead trees.
<name>Hawkeye</name>	Hawkeye	Rogers	I don’t care how many French and Indians there are! I don’t care if there’s a million of ’em! If there’s only two hundred, I can pretty near kill ’em all myself!” Nobody said a word. [MASK] nodded.
<name>Prentice</name>	Prentice	Rogers	It sounded stupendous and magnificent at the time. What happened to that idea?” [MASK] drove the cork into the rum bottle and replaced the bottle on the mantelpiece. “Well,” he said, “you’ve put your finger on the one bad spot.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	McNott	I asked. “She steals it!” [MASK] said angrily. “Every time she thinks I’m going to leave her, she steals it! Does it do any good, me setting on the ground for hours, yelling for her to bring it back?
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Rogers	It plunged heavily into the swirling pool, and hung there, tilted forward, half under water. We looked to see it fall apart; but with labored slowness it came to the surface, turning gently among the clots and streaks of froth. [MASK] lowered himself from the rock.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Hunk	It was [MASK] who replied. “Thought maybe we’d go see what it kind of looks like,” he said. “Thought maybe after we got there we might take a notion to join the army—that is, if we feel like it after we get there.”
<name>Conan</name>	Conan	Rogers	“My God!” [MASK] said, “haven’t any of these red hellions got man’s sized feet?” Seated on the ground, he took off his own broken moccasins and struggled with the new ones.
<name>Peabody</name>	Peabody	Amherst	“Mm. So you’ve come eighty miles since then, in these clothes and through the storm.” “Yes, sir.” “Mm. Legs trouble you?” “Yes, sir.” “Very well,” [MASK] said testily.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Elizabeth	“Even if I didn’t, I shouldn’t think of letting her go. She must come in and rid herself of this unseemliness instantly.” “Unseemliness?” I said. “What----” “Those—those garments,” [MASK] explained sharply.
<name>Sharpe</name>	Sharpe	Rogers	“Lost his footing. Dropped his muskets.” It was [MASK] himself who pulled me to the bank. “Get the men out of the river,” he was calling to his officers. “Get ’em out dead or alive!
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Ann	The door swung open, and in the opening [MASK] stood framed. With both hands she clung to the latch, her eyes reaching out to me. And then her knees gave under her. At that I came to life and caught her in my arms before she fell.
<name>Macumazahn</name>	Macumazahn	William	“My dear dependable [MASK]!” he said in the flat tones of a deaf person, “it’s a pity we can’t have a regiment of you to be on the lookout for the welfare of the nation.”
<name>Ratcliffe</name>	Ratcliffe	Roberts	“He’s drunk!” she said. “He came in hardly able to stand, and went reeling out again to join his friend Lieutenant [MASK]. He’ll go across the river, and wont be back tonight! Oh, it’s disgusting!”
<name>Jerry</name>	Jerry	Cap	“Knowing your tastes, we had ’em made specially for you out of horse hair and hoof parings.” “That’s good,” [MASK] said. “That’ll be a nice change from the chopped fish skins and oakum that us country fellers have to smoke.”
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Ogden	“Turn around. Captain,” he said. “I’d like to have a picture of you, the way you are.” [MASK] obediently turned around. The General whistled softly; then looked at me. “Who’s this?”
<name>Asenath</name>	Asenath	Rogers	At sight of her I felt within me faint stirrings of my old affection, and hoped she might now become a more fitting helpmate for the strange man she had married. When [MASK] saw her, he lifted his glass.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Ogden	[MASK] opened his eyes and looked at us, and to me the uncomplaining patience of that look was heartrending. “How far have we come?” he asked. “You mean today?” “Yes, today,” he whispered.
<name>Wahb</name>	Wahb	Johnson	As for [MASK], sitting magnificently in the largest canoe, he was a glittering mass of scarlet cloth, gold lace, brass buttons, twinkling buckles, shining leather. Over his shoulders was draped a scarlet ceremonial blanket bordered with gold.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Elizabeth----	Oh, God, I wish I was dead!” She groped blindly for her chair, sank into it and sat there sobbing and hiccuping. “Well, [MASK]” I said. Her sobs, dreadful to hear, went on and on.
<name>Chick</name>	Chick	Konkapot	“Don’t pay no attention to [MASK]. He’s crying about his grandfather.” “What happened to his grandfather?” “Oh, the regular thing! Prob’ly they buried him without his bracelets, or maybe he had the misfortune to die in bed.
<name>Wemmick</name>	Wemmick	Elizabeth	He clapped both of us on the shoulder. I thanked him for all his kindness to me: then went to say good-bye to [MASK], who stood on the high bank looking pale-faced, red-nosed and discontented in the gray light of approaching sunrise.
<name>Corporal</name>	Corporal	Ogden	[MASK], standing in the path, stopped us. “Dump your packs.” We put our blankets, our knapsacks and everything we could spare in compact piles beside the path: then squatted in the trail, working our bayonets over our musket-sights.
<name>Sharpe</name>	Sharpe	Ogden	The left leg of his breeches had been slit open, and burning powder had so seared his knee that the tendons showed white through the blackened, bloody flesh. [MASK] came behind us and looked closely at the sergeant.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Ann	“If the house catches fire, try to save them. They’re worth more to me than anything in the world.” I slammed down the lid, locked it, and hid the key behind a loose brick in the chimney. “Don’t forget, [MASK].”
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Ann	I shouldn’t, I told myself, send her such a letter; but within me I continued to argue. [MASK] was more than a child, wasn’t she? Surely, too, she wasn’t inexperienced! And wasn’t she both tolerant and wise?
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Rogers	[MASK] lowered himself heavily to his knees and pawed in the shallows at the water’s edge, among dried-up plants whose dead leaves were shaped like arrow-heads. With his hands he dug among them, pulling up a cluster of roots that looked like miniature sweet potatoes.
<name>Blackwood</name>	Blackwood	Ogden	They’ll be in tomorrow morning.” [MASK] made a strangled sound like a loud gasp, and the General looked at him sharply. Outside the sentries rattled their muskets, and through the tent-opening came a gaudily dressed officer, all scarlet, gold and white.
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	Dunbar	That’s the way he always looks: as if he didn’t believe something!” He was diverted. “And that’s [MASK]! Yes, sir! Hanging his mouth open so a bluebird could nest in it! Aint he an Englishman, though?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Konkapot	“Give it to him,” the red-headed man exclaimed. “Keep right at it!” When we had moistened our throats, we went at the second verse. To my surprise, [MASK] had a good baritone, and thus I could insert a bass.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Langdon	“Hm,” he said at length. “It don’t seem possible.” My mother came behind him and looked long at the sheets. “What are you planning to do with them, [MASK]?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ann	She wheeled, stamped her foot, angrily cried, “Drunken, clumsy brutes!” then turned again and came quickly up to where I stood. I glanced apprehensively over my shoulder toward [MASK], but she had vanished.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Ann	Out of our sight, he sang a second verse. His voice faded and changed: changed to [MASK]'s voice—and she was there before us again, a woman deserted, but still bravely singing, in a gay farewell, the song the voyageur had sung.
<name>Asenath</name>	Asenath	Cap	The mixture seemed mild and sweet—as harmless-tasting as a soothing syrup. Murmurs of pleasure arose from my friends as they sampled it; and the glances turned toward [MASK] were almost affectionate. At their gratified murmurs.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Natty	Write ’em out before you get too drunk, will you, [MASK]? And send out some paragraphs to the papers. There hasn’t been a line in the Advertiser yet.” “Yes there has,” I said. “That’s how I knew you were here.
<name>Pah!</name>	Pah!	Hoots	Not voya-geurs: they’re lost without their canoes. You’d starve or you’d freeze! And what do you think would happen to you if you had a woman along? A white woman?” He snuffled and again contemptuously ejaculated “[MASK]!”
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Rogers	the waiter asked. “The same,” [MASK] said. “Go get him. Tell him I got a mutual acquaintance here. Tell him he’ll get some ale—not on his head, this time, but down his throat—’n’ maybe some meat.
<name>Washington</name>	Washington	Rogers	We all fared alike: every man carried a whole bologna sausage, a bag of meal, two cakes of chocolate and a canteen of rum, and I heard [MASK] warning the officers: “Be sure each man fills his meal bag as full as he can.
<name>Connell</name>	Connell	Harvard	“[MASK]!” he said doubtfully. “I don’t know how some of these boys of mine would make out with an educated man. They’re a pretty rugged lot! Pretty rugged!” “I’m not very educated,” I told him.
<name>Georgie</name>	Georgie	Bradley	“I noticed that [MASK] was wearing a leather hair ribbon and some Indian jewelry. Maybe next summer somebody’ll find a strip of leather and a few beads, and be Christian enough to bury what he finds with ’em. Let’s get on.” ☆
<name>Stonor</name>	Stonor	Potter	“You think it better,” [MASK] said, and laughed. “May I remind you that we’re speaking of my daughter?” I controlled my temper somehow. “Didn’t you turn her over to me?” “Not at all!
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Hunk	I thought I might as well lie as tell the truth. “They’re getting along all right—doing fine.” “That’s good,” [MASK] said. “I thought the Sergeant might lose a leg.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Ann	Trying to laugh at the morbid fancies that a harmless word brings to a man’s brain when he’s in love, I folded the letter, fastened it securely in the pocket of my shirt, got crayons and a mirror from my haversack and went to work on the small portrait for which [MASK] had asked.
<name>Sharpe</name>	Sharpe	Rogers	The entire command, barring sentries, had gathered at [MASK]’ orders into a tight circle around the knoll. There was no way of telling whether he’d thus pulled the men close together because he expected an attack, or to give it more warmth and confidence.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Langdon	They have not been good to paint as they have all been dirtier than any you ever painted when I was with you. Oh [MASK] dear I have missed seeing you do pastels and make people come to life on paper and get colors all over yourself.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Langdon	“[MASK],” he said, “you got educated brains. You can figure out some way to help the Major. You got to! These damned rats around here—every one of ’em’s dodged into his rat-hole!
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Rogers	The ghastly sarcasm of his look was upon all our faces. Not until I saw [MASK] dragging and kicking them upright did I realize that his optimistic words had been solely for their benefit: had been spoken in one last effort to save them from giving up.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Cap	We can’t leave the table till the tutors give the word, not unless we want to be fined five shillings; but if you’ll wait, I’ll borrow some money and we’ll go to the Tavern and get something to eat.” “What’s wrong with this?” [MASK] asked.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Ann	“What a race, these Americans—no thought for the future, no thought for the monnaie, always waste —why don’t you get married?” [MASK] still clung to me, her cheek against mine. “Yes,” I said, “of course.
<name>Smitty</name>	Smitty	McNott	“Come on,” [MASK] said. “I got to see the Major.” He stumped off the landing-stage, swinging his wooden leg in wide arcs. “See those two fellers walking behind the others?” he asked.
<name>Longley</name>	Longley	McNott	We didn’t blab much to you coming over the road, did we?” [MASK] cast a cautious glance over his shoulder at the Rangers at work around the tents and whaleboats: then came closer to us. “All right; I’ll tell you.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Avery	The starvation rations of the past few days seemed to have made my knees limber, but we had them almost out when [MASK] looked up at me. “What’s that?” I had said nothing. “I thought you’d hurt yourself,” he explained.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Rogers	[MASK] laughed abruptly. “You bet it’s so! The place to hide is in the last place the French would think of looking—a place we can escape from if they find us. We’ll camp right out on the flat land, and nowhere else!”
<name>Radisson</name>	Radisson	McNott	[MASK]’s face grew red. “Aint there perquisites to this post, the way there is to all posts? Indians send presents to a governor; and traders do, too. Why shouldn’t they? The governor helps ’em make a profit, don’t he?
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Hunk	They were not, [MASK] protested, suitably dressed to appear in polite society; but this wasn’t true, for they had on their city clothes—homespun breeches, gray woolen stockings and towcloth shirts—and carried brown coats tied to their belts in back.
<name>Johnson</name>	Johnson	Johnson	“You mean, Major, that Johnson-----” “Somebody did!” He tapped the table earnestly with a ponderous forefinger. “I only say somebody did. That’s all I’ll say, and it couldn’t have been anybody else but [MASK].
<name>Boone</name>	Boone	Carver	“Where’d you winter, Captain?” he asked. “In the country of the Naudowessies on the St. Peter’s,” [MASK] said. “I explored it thoroughly, taking maps and surveys of the land.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Foyle	It was [MASK]. His arms were tangled in the straps of his knapsack, and he was dead; but we put him on the bank, head downward, in the vague hope that the water might drain from him and let him come to life.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Rogers	They think they’re going to starve to death. They say if they could stop at the lake for just one day, they’d shoot enough and catch enough to get anywhere.” [MASK] went swinging on, almost as if he hadn’t heard him.
<name>Wolfe</name>	Wolfe	Carver	“I thought you hadn’t got here! Where you been keeping yourself?” [MASK] showed his teeth in a grin, and his voice was oily. “I didn’t want to intrude. I thought you might have forgotten you told me to report here.”
<name>cowboys</name>	cowboys	Rangers	His lace was fine, and this quiet dress became him. I’d feared somehow to see him ill at ease among these distinguished Londoners, but he was as careless and un-self-conscious as he would have been among a group of [MASK].
<name>Wentworth</name>	Wentworth	Rogers	“No, my lord; not entirely,” [MASK] insisted. “If the gentleman to the left of me has the port, and I ask for it, it must pass entirely around the table and come up to me on my right hand.
<name>Churchill</name>	Churchill	Rogers	We killed their Indians and sunk their boats and burned their crops and took prisoners; and after we’d been at it a month, the French would ’a’ paid five thousand pounds, hard money, for [MASK]’ scalp.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Ogden	He doubled over with a cramp; but thus bent he pointed awkwardly, like an actor playing the part of a hunchback. On the river bank, a hundred yards ahead, two men with axes suddenly stood. “Why,” [MASK] said incredulously, “it’s people again!”
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Potter	I turned again to him. “You’re afraid to go yourself, aren’t you, [MASK]? You’re afraid in the first place for what you might find; and in the second you’re afraid of the woman—the nurse.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Packer	I can prove I been the best by-word this town ever had, and still am, but the man that calls me a hissing, he’s got to take and set down and eat it!” He took [MASK] by the shoulders, rammed him down into a chair.
<name>Albert</name>	Albert	Jesse	He said “Yes” in a mild voice. As a sort of afterthought he added that he hadn’t slept well, and had already limbered himself by moving around a little. Remembering that [MASK] was three times my age, I tried to forget my aches.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Natty	He strode around the room; stopped to finger a bottle on the chest of drawers; exclaimed sonorously, “The play’s the thing, wherewith to catch the notice of the King!” “Go ahead. [MASK]!”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Billy	We were finished; if our lives depended on our marching a mile, we couldn’t have done it. By the time we started, poor young [MASK] had bad cramps and couldn’t even sit upright, so we laid him on some spruce tips in the middle of the raft.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Cap	Maybe you wont like the food, but it can’t be helped.” “We’ll like it,” [MASK] assured me. “Anybody that’s hungry likes anything, and I’m hungry enough to eat a porcupine, quills and all.”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Langdong	“Why do you not ask her what she wants? Look at her, [MASK]! Look! What you see in those eyes? You see fear of a Fleet parson? No, no, no! You see hate for a Fleet marriage?
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Ogden	For my part, I thought courtesy could ask no more of either [MASK] or me than what we’d already been through; so I shook him half-awake, and he stumbled after me to drop upon a pile of blankets at the side of the tent.
<name>Call</name>	Call	Williams	“I ought to known what he figured on doing when he stuck his knife in the bag.” “Not at all,” [MASK] said. “Not at all. You acted as quickly as anyone could have. You’ll make a good Ranger.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Solomon	‘Wait!” I shouted to [MASK]. “Come back!” I folded the letter and buttoned it in the pocket of my buckskin shirt, where it seemed to press against me as if there were life and warmth within it.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Ann	Over the child’s head was an arch of wood, from which a dirty string hung to within an inch of its nose. Enraptured, [MASK] scrutinized the drawing with clasped hands; then pointed to the string. “What’s that?”
<name>Thoreau</name>	Thoreau	Jesse	I followed [MASK]’s example and went barefoot. The chill of the water seemed to have driven blood and feeling from my feet, so that stumbling or stepping on sharp branches was only painful at first. It was when the moccasins began to wear out that now
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ann	He’s been kind to me, always—as kind as a father could have been—kind and sympathetic. Of course his kindness in [MASK]’s case meant no more than it had meant in mine. It was paternal.
<name>Joad</name>	Joad	Bradley	[MASK] looked doubtful. “I’ll tell ’em to eat less.” And somewhat unnecessarily, I thought, he added, “They’re right hungry.” “Can’t help it! They’re to do as I say, or they’ll be a hell of a lot hungrier!
<name>Smollett</name>	Smollett	Cap	“Going where with me?” I asked. “Where you aint neither of you arrested,” [MASK] said. “Where you wont neither of you get pressed on a King’s ship, and maybe never get back.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Traders	[MASK] tiptoed toward the door, stumbling against walls and furniture. When, against my will, I sought the Major, he warned me to silence with an upraised finger. “I heard what she said, ’n’ I aint going to do it, damned if I am!
<name>Yours</name>	Yours	Ann	I will keep it where it can’t be lost like the diary. I miss you. I hope you are well and having a good time and that you are having good weather and painting some beautiful pictures. Oh how I wish I could see them and you. “[MASK].”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Rogers	Through a gap in the hills we could see, low on the horizon, a dim silvery bulk of snow-covered mountains, like a far-off cloud. “Who did go with him?” [MASK] asked.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Langdon	“Well,” I admitted, “I’ve done one other—from memory.” “Of anyone I know?” Then, as I looked steadily at her, she dropped her eyes and asked softly, “Is it good, [MASK]?”
<name>Larsen</name>	Larsen	Rogers	[MASK] looked thoughtful and shook his head, but gave orders for the whaleboats to be uncovered and launched, and for the oars to be wrapped with strips of blanketing. When the men were aboard, he went from boat to boat, warning the crews to be silent.
<name>Mercury</name>	Mercury	Rogers	For a fleeting moment I thought I saw her lips curve with the beginning of a smile; and her waddle, as she went to draw the tent-pegs, was almost a run. Not even [MASK] himself could have broken camp more quickly than we did.
<name>Chippeways</name>	Chippeways	Carver	“[MASK]!” The sergeant spat. “I dunno what would have happened if the Major hadn’t been shackled, or if they hadn’t pushed him down onto the ballast right away, because those Chippeways followed along the shore, throwing all their English belts and medals into the lake.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Elizabeth	“She likes to go. She’ll leam a lot, finding out how they live. It’s an opportunity.” “Oh, the nasty things!” [MASK] cried. “The way they dress- some of them have hardly anything on!
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jennie	Then all at once he laughed loudly and emptily. “What do you think of that! She’s white outside; but inside she’s an Indianl Damned wanton little slut!” Then he looked at me furtively and seemed to be ashamed of what he’d just called [MASK].
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Crofton	Some of the men in the detachment had complained of the smell that came from it, though I doubt they knew what caused it. [MASK] looked worse than anybody else, which is the same as saying he looked like something out of a very strange and painful hell.
<name>Rawdon</name>	Rawdon	Elizabeth	The large corner room, in which the Major and [MASK] had slept, was a hoorah’s nest of soiled bedding, rumpled garments, old letters and ancient Portsmouth newspapers. A striped petticoat trailed from a chair; an empty bottle lay on the bed.
<name>Ahab</name>	Ahab	McNott	There must have been thirty of them—almost two full loads. “But you’ve got supplies,” I said. Behind me I heard the sound of [MASK]’s wooden leg in the gravel, and of his heavy breathing.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	McNott	A week passed before a band of Chippeway hunters came across [MASK]’s tracks, followed them to one of the drawings on birch bark I’d made for him to leave in conspicuous places, and so came to help us.
<name>Macdonald</name>	Macdonald	Rogers	The boat stirred beneath us, rumbling on the pebbly bottom: then floated clear. [MASK] and two others —one of them the sergeant—climbed in over the stem. The sergeant picked up a steering oar and pushed, while the men beside me set their oars softly in the gunwales and pulled.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Rogers	“Is somebody complaining of something you did?” “No,” [MASK] said, “it’s just that legislative bodies always act the same way. They squander money on things that don’t amount to a hill of beans, but never pay their obligations.
