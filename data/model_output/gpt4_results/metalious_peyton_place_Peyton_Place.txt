<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Constance	“And that’s the second thing about you that annoys me,” said [MASK]. “The first one is the way you always rip my arguments into pieces, and the second one is the way you seem to try to be deliberately crude.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Rodney	[MASK] could not keep his eyes off her. She was like something that he had read about in what he termed “dirty books.” He had never seen a woman so apparently enamored of her own body before, and to him there was something wicked, forbidden, exciting about it.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Ted	Once, this fact had pleased her. It had made her happy when [MASK] talked and walked earlier and better than other babies. It had pleased her when his teachers commented on how smart he was, how easily he learned, how mature he was for his age.
<name>Jonas</name>	Jonas	Allison	“And all life is like the seasons of the year. It is set in a pattern, like time, and each life follows its own pattern, from spring through winter, to spring again.” “I never thought of it like that,” [MASK] interrupted.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Kenny	so’s nobody can see in, and he said [MASK] no more than opened the window a slit to pass out the money and take in the stuff.” “What do you suppose made them fellers go down there and stay all this time?” “Dunno.
<name>Macavity</name>	Macavity	Tom	“And that,” said [MASK], “is the best opening gambit I’ve been offered for over two years. My next natural line is to say, ‘Well, then?” so I'll say it. Well, then? Or do you want this stylized?
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ginny	At once everything began to swing dizzily in front of his eyes, and he was transported back to a wonderful time when he had taken [MASK] to a county fair and they had gone for a ride on the Ferris wheel.
<name>Connell</name>	Connell	Lucas	You can’t do it here. Not any more.” A great deal of liquor, plus the quick change from extreme cold to warmth, made [MASK] feel much drunker than he believed himself to be, and, as always, drunkenness made him ugly.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Ted	[MASK]’s parents either fell silent altogether so that the tension in their house was almost as palpable as fog, or else they began to talk disjointedly, foolishly. He just didn’t know, they said. He was too young. He just did not realize.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Lucas	But lynching seems to be something an outraged man always knows how to do. The fathers will know how to do it, [MASK]. Not too good, maybe. Not good enough so’s you’d die on the first try, maybe.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Tom	“As a matter of fact,” she said, “that’s just the way it was. It never changed, either. Sex was always something I allowed him as a sort of favor.” “What a liar you are,” said [MASK].
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Marty	[MASK]’s a swell dancer.” “That’s not what I meant” "What did you mean?” “I mean after. Parking.” “Yes I did, if it’s any of your business.” “What did you do?”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Allison	It was raining, the way it had been raining for days, and the white curtains at [MASK]’s window turned and twisted in the wind. For a long time she watched them, noticing that the wind caused not one motion that was ungraceful.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Allison	“I don’t know,” [MASK] had said in a tightly controlled voice, “how you came to think the way you do, and I don’t care. I have something here which I’ve written. I’m not asking you to print your own words in your paper.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Delaney	You want to try?” [MASK] stood up and looked at the blank-faced wall before him. He thought for a long time. “No,” he said at last. “No, I don’t think so. Let’s start back.
<name>Artie</name>	Artie	Rodney	“What does that mean?” “It means I’m pregnant, smart guy.” “But how can you tell so soon?” stammered [MASK]. 203 “I was supposed to come around the week after we were at the lake.
<name>he</name>	he	Joey	With an effort, she finally thought of what it was she must do. She walked toward the telephone as if she were wading through mud, and her hand was on the receiver before [MASK] reached her. He slapped her hand away, viciously.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Allison	It was time, [MASK] had written, for men of honor to stand up and be counted. When the time came that an individual in a free American town was forced to fear a prejudiced hearing, it was indeed a time to try men’s souls.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Rodney	“Hateful,” she whispered. “Hateful, hateful, hateful!” Her stomach quivered as she remembered [MASK]’s wet mouth and the heaviness of his soft, full lips. “Hateful,” she said aloud. “Hateful. He spoiled my whole party!”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Brad	[MASK] held her fingers in his and she giggled. “It would be terrible if I got pregnant,” she had said, thinking that it would not be terrible at all, “because then we’d have to get married and I’d never get any work done.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Allison	“With what we have to do,” he concluded. At that moment, [MASK] opened her eyes. She did not cry out or look about in bewilderment. She merely opened her eyes, looked at her surroundings and then closed her eyes again.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Allison	“And besides, people don’t have much choice anyway,” added [MASK] and laughed. It was the first time she had laughed over nothing much all summer. “We’d better start back,” she said. “The days are getting shorter and shorter.
<name>Emmeline</name>	Emmeline	Norman	“She might,” quivered [MASK]. “She’s loony, you know. I’ve heard plenty of folks say so. You never can tell what a loony person will do.” The two of them were now standing directly opposite the Goodale house.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Selena	But this is impossible, she thought frantically. He is throwing away his big chance. There is no new evidence. He would have told me beforehand. He’s making it all up to save [MASK]’s neck.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Leslie	[MASK] had roared and threatened to close down the mills and put everyone out of work forever, but he had, unfortunately for him, signed contracts with the government which precluded his doing so, and the mill hands knew it.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Selena	he asked when they had returned to the office. Now came the worst part, the part she had rehearsed so carefully in her mind so that she could phrase it in a way that would not antagonize the doctor. “I am not at liberty to say," said [MASK].
<name>Flanagan</name>	Flanagan	Witcher	It hung suspended over the empty field where [MASK] coughed out orders for the unloading of the vans. He looked through the smoky haze to where the fires burned. “It’s like dancing at somebody’s funeral,” he grumbled. Surprisingly enough, people did turn out.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Tom	Or is that too much to ask?” [MASK] stood up. “No,” he said gently, “that’s not too much to ask. But try to remember that we love you, and we’d be glad to listen if you wanted to talk.”
<name>motorcycling</name>	motorcycling	Selena	Everything he had always wanted to do had always been all right with his folks, so why, he wondered, were they so unyielding, so downright mean and stupid, about [MASK]? Certainly, since they had always trusted his common sense before, they should do so now.
<name>Cooger</name>	Cooger	Witcher	“Take a ride on the Ferris wheel,” barked [MASK]. “Get up there and breathe air again. No smoke when you get to the top in this gigantic wheel of pleasure.” The people laughed shrilly and pushed and did not believe him, but they rode the Ferris wheel.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Selena	Don’t you ever let me hear you open your mouth again. You are setting out deliberately this night to inflict death, rather than to protect life as you are sworn to do. “Feeling better, [MASK]?” asked the doctor, stepping into the darkened bedroom.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Allison	“There is nothing to be done about it now, and if you are as smart as I hope you are, you won’t act like this when she comes home. As you told me last night, [MASK] will be sixteen in the fall.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	It blew the smoke in gusts and filled [MASK]’s eyes with sand. The skirts of the women who hurried past him, eager to get home before the rain started, ballooned grotesquely in the wind, so that they all looked fat and misshapen.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Lucas	Pus in all my veins, that’s what [MASK] left me with. He couldn’t help it, poor man. He caught it off some hoor, that’s what he done. He couldn’t help it. He was drunk and forgot himself, is all.”
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Tom	“Don’t think about it,” said [MASK] gently. “That part is all over with now. Now we are us, and we understand one another. Don’t, baby,” he said, as she shuddered again. “Don’t think about it.”
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Allison	He wouldn’t have anyone to talk to at all. Angrily, he crushed the beetle he had been teasing. It wasn’t fair! It wasn’t as if he and [MASK] had done anything terrible, although his mother had tried hard enough to make him admit that they had.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Allison	[MASK] lay in her wide, four-poster bed and stared up at the ceiling where the street light outside made weird shadow figures with the room’s darkness. Just like a prince, she thought, and felt a sudden tightness in her throat.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Seth	Do not be afraid, my dear, you are among friends here.” “Friends?” The child’s voice was not the voice of a child, not the same voice which had thanked [MASK] for a chance to write for the paper. For money.
<name>Alanna</name>	Alanna	Betty	For less than a moment he wondered if all the stories he had read and heard and told about virgins could be wrong. [MASK] did not scream in pain or beg him to stop hurting her. She led him without a fumble, and her hips moved quickly, expertly.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Ted	It was over and done with, and she would not even be able to find a scar unless she looked hard for it. “Oh, [MASK],” she said, shiny eyed. “I can go home tomorrow.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Allison	[MASK] wrote these words that same night. She locked herself in her bedroom and set them down in a notebook on white, blue-lined paper, and when they were written she sat and gazed at them for a long time. She could not think of anything else to say.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Ted	But [MASK]’s mind did not dwell upon these present realities. He thought of the future, of the day when he would graduate from law school and come home to practice. How far would a man get in the legal profession tied to a wife who was a murderess?
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Buck	[MASK]’s mind ticketed the stranger at once, although the sheriff pretended not to stare at the stranger. He sipped his coffee and seemed to be lost in thought when the stranger spoke. “This place looks a lot different than it did the last time I was through here,” he said.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Lucas	“There ain’t no more. You drunk it all up.” “Goddamn lyin’ bitch,” shouted [MASK]. “You hid it. Tell me where it is or I’ll beat your goddamn lousy hide right off you.”
<name>Rocky</name>	Rocky	Helen	“I guess, not,” he said, and again he had the eerie feeling of having spoken those words before. “Don’t you be mad at me, doll,” whispered [MASK]. “I’ll be good to you.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Henry	“Oh, Christ!” “Where’s the friggin’ bottle?” “Come on, [MASK]. I’ll give you a boost out the window.” “I’ll get three cases of beer. That’ll be better.”
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Allison	“You mean will not!” “[MASK], my dear—” Angry tears had rushed to the girl’s eyes. “And I thought that you were my friend,” she said, and had run out of his office.
<name>God</name>	God	Doc	If you knew, she thought. If you knew what the matter is, you wouldn’t talk so gently to me. You’d tell me to get out of your sight. Oh, [MASK], help me.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Norman	You’d get along without your mother.” [MASK] collapsed on the floor at his mother’s feet. He sobbed hysterically and tugged at her skirt with both his hands, but she would not look down at him. “No, I wouldn’t get along!
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Tom	[MASK] raised an eyebrow. “What the hell have you got against the word intercourse?” he asked. “It’s a good, serviceable word. Yet 216 you’d rather rack your brain for fifteen minutes to find a substitute rather than use it.”
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Betty	It was five weeks later, during the third week of August, when [MASK] faced him with the worst. “I’m a month overdue.” “What does that mean?” “It means I’m pregnant, smart guy.”
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Tom	he inquired, again reading her mind. “I was thinking,” she said, “that after two years, I really don’t know you very well.” [MASK] laughed and turned into the graveled drive in front of the 150 restaurant they had come to visit.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Allison	She opened her eyes wider, and the clock’s face no longer wavered. Two o’clock. With the miraculous facility which seems to disappear with childhood, [MASK] was suddenly thoroughly awake. She sat up in her bed and circled her knees with her arms.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Lucas	“Is that any way to greet me, after I’ve traveled hundreds of miles just to see you?” demanded [MASK]. His smile had not changed, she noticed. His forehead still moved as if controlled by his lips.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Joey	Whenever she hadn’t seen him for a while, even if it was only a couple of hours, she always acted like he had just come back from a long trip. “Hi, [MASK]!” she’d say, and her face got all smily and lighted up.
<name>Robot</name>	Robot	Tom	After much thought, [MASK] 177 had been able to put the souls of humanity on the simple, uncomplicated plane with bare feet. Some people could walk without shoes with the result that their feet grew tough and calloused, while others could not take a step without the bad luck of stepping on a broken bottle.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Makris	There was an iron-barred cage set into one wall and from behind this a straight, thin man with a pinched-looking nose, steel-rimmed glasses and a string tie stared at [MASK]. “Is there a place where I can check these?”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Matt	“Really, [MASK]?” she had laughed at him. “Do we all, then, have the same look of frustration?” “No,” he had replied, “but all of you do look overworked, underpaid, poorly dressed and underfed.
<name>Phelps</name>	Phelps	Peyton	“Well,” he began, “quite a spell before the Civil War, there was this nigger down South someplace. He was a slave, and he worked for a plantation owner by the name of [MASK].
<name>Harlan</name>	Harlan	Allison	“You don’t have to pay me. I’ll do it for nothing and count it as a privilege.” “That’s no way to talk, [MASK]. If people like your writing, they should be willing to pay for it.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Constance	[MASK] glanced at the clock set into the back of the stove. Six-thirty. Well, dinner was going to be late and there was nothing she could do about it. Certainly, no one could expect her to prepare food in a kitchen as messy as this one.
<name>Una</name>	Una	Kathy	“People who call other people names, for instance, and tell filthy lies about them. I suppose that’s not mean and cruel!” “You are supposed to turn the other cheek,” said [MASK] virtuously, enjoying this feeling of righteousness at someone else’s expense.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Allison	Their hands rested close together on the board that had the red letters printed on its side, and there was a companionable sort of intimacy in the sight of them. “No, that isn’t always true,” said [MASK].
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Witcher	It usually was. If one looked, one could see the holes where the hinges that held the cover had been made. But after all, [MASK] was only one man, and he couldn’t be everywhere at once seeing that everything was as it should be.
<name>Miss</name>	Miss	Kenny	“Is there anyone here who would like to spend the thirty minutes after dismissal with me?” she asked. The boys and girls, ranging in age from twelve to fourteen, fell silent, but as soon as the first note sounded from [MASK]’s bell, they began to scrape and shuffle their feet.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Isobel	He certainly didn’t care what the rest of himself looked like. His suits always needed pressing, and he had a terrible habit of eating in the living room. The doctor’s coffee cups, strewn all over the house, were [MASK]’s cross.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Tom	“Nothing would hold me back then. I’d join up in a minute.” Afterward, she was sorry that she had said this, for [MASK], she had heard, had tried several times to enlist.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Joey	“I love you. I love you. I never loved anybody in the world except [MASK], and I love you more.” “I want you, baby. How I want youl Don’t touch me. What if I ever got you in trouble?
<name>She</name>	She	Betty	He stumbled several times be- 201 fore he finally discerned the bulk of his automobile up ahead of him. [MASK] waited while he stumbled again and nearly fell. She waited until he was directly in front of the car, and then she turned on the head lights.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Rodney	Before he was ten years old, [MASK] knew that there was nothing worth winning that involved effort, for without effort he could win anything he wanted from his father. He had merely to ask or, later, to hold out his hand, and whatever he wanted was his.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Allison	“So are a lot of other people,” cried [MASK], ashamed at being caught so obviously in an act of unkindness, but unable to back down now. “People who call other people names, for instance, and tell filthy lies about them.
<name>Clarence</name>	Clarence	Allison	[MASK] began to make up a story of intellectual love. Intellectual love differed from physical love, according to her, in that instead of merely kissing a girl, an intellectual first told her that her lips were like ruby velvet.
<name>Artie</name>	Artie	Rodney	She was exactly one year and fourteen days younger than he, but she unfailingly called him kid. Tonight she wore a pair of tight green shorts and a small yellow halter. As always, whenever he looked at her, [MASK] felt his speech thicken in his throat.
<name>Sorry</name>	Sorry	Brad	“I’ve read the book,” he had said, as if nothing had happened between them over the week end. “Can you come down to the office?” “No, I can’t. [MASK],” she had replied, trying to match her tone to his.
<name>Effia</name>	Effia	Allison	It won’t always be like this. Someday [MASK] won’t be content with just calling the numbers. She will want to join in the game. Soon I am going to have to tell her how dangerous it is to be a girl.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Seth	If people like your writing, they should be willing to pay for it. I’ll give you two .dollars for every article of yours that I print.” For a moment, [MASK] was afraid that the child would either burst into tears or throw up.
<name>McGee</name>	McGee	Clayton	“Fire!” cried [MASK], and the vast machinery which the state and the town maintained for the fighting of forest fires groaned and moved quickly into operation. It was the local custom for the sheriff and the doctor to go at once to a forest fire area.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	David	A lowvoiced compliment from [MASK] was something with which she was not prepared to cope. “Hadn’t we best hurry? I’ve never been to the ballet before. I don’t want to get there late.”
<name>Jefferson</name>	Jefferson	Leslie	Early in life, [MASK] had learned the best way of beating any problem. Whenever one presented itself, instead of spending hours in futile, squirrel-in-a-cage worry, he would sit down and list on paper all the possible solutions to the problem at hand.
<name>Roark</name>	Roark	Lucas	“I dunno how many times it was,” said [MASK] thickly. “A couple —maybe three—when I was half drunk and didn’t give a shit.” His eyes went blank with remembered lust.
<name>Francie</name>	Francie	Allison	“Maybe so,” cried [MASK] furiously. “But I’ve read about plucking out the eye that offends you. That goes for people whom you consider your friends but who go around sticking up for others.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Allison	“Well! I’m waiting for an explanation for your incredibly cheap behavior.” “I haven’t been behaving cheaply,” protested [MASK]. “I suppose you were off in the woods doing nothing but reading books!”
<name>Yvonne</name>	Yvonne	Norman	“It’s different with a novel. Novels are always made-up stories.” “So are poems.” “Is that when you’ll start having affairs? After you write a famous book and become a celebrity?” asked [MASK]. “Yes.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Rod	“Is it up, [MASK]?” she panted, undulating her body under his. ‘Is it up good and hard?” “Oh, yes,” he whispered, almost unable to speak. “Oh, yes.”
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Rodney	And that, thought [MASK] savagely, was that. He’d buy h a goddamned hot dog, a dozen if she wanted, but he was go' damned if he was going to bother with her again after tonight.
<name>Rod</name>	Rod	Seth	“And I thought that you were my friend!” [MASK] finished his stale drink and poured himself another. I was, you know, he thought, addressing an Allison MacKenzie of long ago. If you had listened to me, you would have been spared a lot of hurt.
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Brad	“You needn’t, you know,” said [MASK], and she was so startled that she nearly dropped the glass she held. “Needn’t what?” “Feel uncomfortable.” He stood up and went to stir the fire, keeping his back to her.
<name>Mac</name>	Mac	Mary	“And don’t stop to pick up any more like this one on your way.” “Don’t kid me, [MASK],” said the doctor. “You love ’em all with a wicked lust. Good night!”
<name>He</name>	He	Rodney	He just happened to be luckier than most, and was damned grateful for the fact. And what good could a fellow do himself? [MASK] wondered. Just supposing that a fellow could overlook all the disadvantages of being in the service, just what was in it for him?
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Lucas	‘“Where’s the envelope that was under my mattress then? The one with the ten one-dollar bills in it?” “You mean this one?” asked [MASK]. He held up the envelope which was grimy now, and well creased.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Allison	“Ask anybody. They’ll tell you.” “Well, it’s just not true,” said [MASK]. “What would anyone want to come up here at night for? You can’t walk in the woods at night.”
<name>Theron</name>	Theron	Seth	“The doorbell is ringing” “If every man,” declared [MASK], ignoring the doctor’s remark, “ceased to hate and blame every other man for his own failures and shortcomings, we would see the end of every evil in the world, from war to backbiting.”
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Lew	“[MASK] and I are going to buy a house after we get married.” “What’s so extra about that? All married people buy houses eventually. It’s all part of the whole stultifying, stupid pattern.” ‘We never owned a house.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Norman	[MASK] turned his head in minute fractions of an inch to look through the gap in the hedge. Sweat made him itch, and the dry blades of grass on which 252 he lay tickled his nose. He had an hysterical desire to sneeze and just as strong an urge to urinate.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Tuttle	The youngsters crowded around [MASK]’s penny candy counter, and the men around the stove smoked silently, waiting. When the children had spent their pennies and one lone boy had bought a loaf of bread, the men rustled themselves and prepared to talk again.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Seth	Poker at [MASK]’s is against the laws of this state, so you have broken the law before. But not in my work, protested another part of his mind. Never in my work. No, not in your work. Rules are rules and you have always abided by them.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Allison	That business of caring too much was always obvious in you, my dear. It showed in your writing, and that, my dear, my too young, my sweet, my talented, my beautiful [MASK], does not make for clear, coolheaded, analytical prose.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Lucas	He continued to sit, staring at the matted black hair on his forearms, with the smell of sweat rising from skin that was roughened now with the tiny bumps of fear. The doctor turned as if to leave, but [MASK]’ moan stopped him before he had taken three steps.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Seth	“Heart attacks are so commonplace. Give me a nice troublesome ulcer any day.” “On second thought,” said [MASK], “you’ll die of a bashed in skull administered by one of those nurses you’re always tickling over at your hospital.”
<name>God</name>	God	Heaven	What will your neighbors think?” “[MASK] only knows what they think already,” she said furiously. "The way you’re always barging in here, uninvited, any time you feel like it” “ ‘Always’?” he asked incredulously.
