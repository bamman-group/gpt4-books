<name>Uriah</name>	Uriah	Micawber	There’s no love between us. You were always a puppy with a proud stomach, from your first coming here; and you envy me my rise, do you? None of your plots against me; I’ll counterplot you! [MASK], you be off.
<name>Mr. Micawber</name>	Mr. Micawber	Traddles	The inconsistency and recklessness of [MASK] were not to be exceeded by any real politician. He was for any description of policy, in the compass of a week; and nailed all sorts of colours to every denomination of mast.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Dora	I met him in town, and asked him to walk out with me that afternoon. He readily consenting, I wrote to [MASK], saying I would bring him home. It was pleasant weather, and on the road we made my domestic happiness the theme of conversation.
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Peggotty	You want to keep the keys yourself, and give out all the things, I suppose? I shouldn’t be surprised if you did. When you know that she only does it out of kindness and the best intentions! You know she does, [MASK]--you know it well.’
<name>Uriah</name>	Uriah	Wickfield	I WON’T confine myself to four--eight, sixteen, two-and-thirty, rather than say anything calculated to overturn the Doctor’s plans.’ ‘[MASK]’s plans,’ said the Doctor, stroking his face, and looking penitently at his adviser.
<name>Rose</name>	Rose	Peggotty	She has taken mine, you know. Will you remember that?’ [MASK], with some uneasy glances at me, curtseyed herself out of the room without replying; seeing, I suppose, that she was expected to go, and had no excuse for remaining.
<name>Louisa</name>	Louisa	Peggotty	‘What are you doing, you stupid creature?’ said my mother, laughing. ‘Oh, drat the man!’ cried [MASK]. ‘He wants to marry me.’ ‘It would be a very good match for you; wouldn’t it?’
<name>Baskerville</name>	Baskerville	Steerforth	Make your own arrangements.’ ‘Why, I was thinking that this evening would be a good time, [MASK], when they are all sitting round the fire. I should like you to see it when it’s snug, it’s such a curious place.’
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Janet	As [MASK] curtsied, hoping I was well, I observed my aunt’s visage lengthen very much. ‘I am sorry for it, too,’ said my aunt, rubbing her nose. ‘I have had no peace of mind, Trot, since I have been here.’
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Agnes	Can I ever forget?’ ‘As you were then, my sister, I have often thought since, you have ever been to me. Ever pointing upward, [MASK]; ever leading me to something better; ever directing me to higher things!’
<name>doesn't exist in the given passage</name>	doesn't exist in the given passage	Steerforth	‘Of course,’ he said. ‘You’ll sleep here, while we stay, and I shall sleep at the hotel.’ ‘But to bring you so far,’ I returned, ‘and to separate, seems bad companionship, [MASK].’
<name>Undine</name>	Undine	Copperfield	The fact is, [MASK], I was unable to repurchase them at the time of their seizure; in the first place, because the broker, having an idea that I wanted them, ran the price up to an extravagant extent; and, in the second place, because I--hadn’t any money.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Peggotty	‘On the last night, in the evening, she kissed me, and said: “If my baby should die too, [MASK], please let them lay him in my arms, and bury us together.” (It was done; for the poor lamb lived but a day beyond her.)
<name>her</name>	her	Dora	I loved her at that minute to distraction. I should always love her, every minute, to distraction. Lovers had loved before, and lovers would love again; but no lover had loved, might, could, would, or should ever love, as I loved [MASK].
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Copperfield	How glad I am! Upon my life and honour, I never was so rejoiced, my beloved [MASK], never!’ I was equally at a loss to express my emotions. I was quite unable to speak, at first. ‘My dear fellow!’
<name>Mr. Winkle</name>	Mr. Winkle	Steerforth	said [MASK], laughing still more heartily: ‘why should I trouble myself, that a parcel of heavy-headed fellows may gape and hold up their hands? Let them do it at some other man. There’s fame for him, and he’s welcome to it.’
<name>being late</name>	being late	Traddles	I felt quite apologetic for [MASK]. ‘He’s a young man, sure?’ said the portentous waiter, fixing his eyes severely on me. ‘How long has he been in the Inn?’ ‘Not above three years,’ said I.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Dora	I took them from her with a most desolate sensation; and, glancing at such phrases at the top, as ‘My ever dearest and own [MASK],’ ‘My best beloved angel,’ ‘My blessed one for ever,’ and the like, blushed deeply, and inclined my head.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Annie	‘My dear soul,’ she said to him one day when I was present, ‘you know there is no doubt it would be a little pokey for [MASK] to be always shut up here.’ The Doctor nodded his benevolent head.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Peggotty	I am solemnly convinced that I never for one hour was reconciled to it, or was otherwise than miserably unhappy; but I bore it; and even to [MASK], partly for the love of her and partly for shame, never in any letter (though many passed between us) revealed the truth.
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Steerforth	I thought, as they came towards us, that they were well matched even in that particular. She withdrew her hand timidly from his arm as we stopped to speak to them, and blushed as she gave it to [MASK] and to me.
<name>Sydney</name>	Sydney	Agnes	‘When you were sitting by her,’ said I, ‘you seemed to be no less her guardian angel than mine; and you seem so now, [MASK].’ ‘A poor angel,’ she returned, ‘but faithful.’
<name>David</name>	David	Agnes	For all that, he brightened; and had an evident pleasure in hearing us recall the little incidents of our old life, many of which he remembered very well. He said it was like those times, to be alone with [MASK] and me again; and he wished to Heaven they had never changed.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Annie	‘What is it that’s amiss? Look here!’ ‘[MASK]!’ cried the Doctor. ‘Not at my feet, my dear!’ ‘Yes!’ she said. ‘I beg and pray that no one will leave the room!
<name>Mr. Sludge</name>	Mr. Sludge	Traddles	As my notoriety began to bring upon me an enormous quantity of letters from people of whom I had no knowledge--chiefly about nothing, and extremely difficult to answer--I agreed with [MASK] to have my name painted up on his door.
<name>Uriah</name>	Uriah	Steerforth	‘Now I understand you, [MASK]!’ said I, exultingly. ‘You pretend to have bought it for yourself, but you have really done so to confer a benefit on him. I might have known as much at first, knowing you.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Peggotty	On the walls there were some common coloured pictures, framed and glazed, of scripture subjects; such as I have never seen since in the hands of pedlars, without seeing the whole interior of [MASK]’s brother’s house again, at one view.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Traddles	I should like to see him again, too!’ ‘He was a brute to you, [MASK],’ said I, indignantly; for his good humour made me feel as if I had seen him beaten but yesterday. ‘Do you think so?’
<name>Estella</name>	Estella	Trotwood,--in	But I know in what it is engendered, [MASK] how true a remembrance of our having grown up together, and in how true an interest in all relating to you. It is that which makes me bold. I am certain that what I say is right.
<name>she</name>	she	Dora	When we had our first great quarrel (within a week of our betrothal), and when [MASK] sent me back the ring, enclosed in a despairing cocked-hat note, wherein she used the terrible expression that ‘our love had begun in folly, and ended in madness!’
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Uriah	‘Come, fellow-partner!’ said [MASK], at last, ‘I’ll give you another one, and I umbly ask for bumpers, seeing I intend to make it the divinest of her sex.’ Her father had his empty glass in his hand.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Steerforth	Owing to some confusion in the dark, the door was gone. I was feeling for it in the window-curtains, when [MASK], laughing, took me by the arm and led me out. We went downstairs, one behind another.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Faults	‘Who feels for me?’ she sharply retorted. ‘She has sown this. Let her moan for the harvest that she reaps today!’ ‘And if his faults--’ I began. ‘[MASK]!’ she cried, bursting into passionate tears.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Micawber	[MASK] would make the most heart-rending confidences to me; also on a Sunday morning, when I mixed the portion of tea or coffee I had bought over-night, in a little shaving-pot, and sat late at my breakfast.
<name>Quilp</name>	Quilp	Shakespeare	No matter how incidentally or naturally I endeavoured to form my little wife’s mind, I could not help seeing that she always had an instinctive perception of what I was about, and became a prey to the keenest apprehensions. In particular, it was clear to me, that she thought [MASK] a terrible fellow.
<name>Beadle</name>	Beadle	Agnes	You remember? The little panelled room that opens from the drawing-room?’ ‘Remember, [MASK]? When I saw you, for the first time, coming out at the door, with your quaint little basket of keys hanging at your side?’
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Davy	Now, [MASK], try once more, and don’t be stupid.’ I obey the first clause of the injunction by trying once more, but am not so successful with the second, for I am very stupid.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Barkis	The prospect of the change and separation, and all that, is, as one may say, close to her and far away from her, both at once. [MASK]’s death needn’t put it off much, but his lingering might.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Doady	‘Directly.’ ‘What a good, kind boy! [MASK], take me on your arm. Indeed, my dear, it’s not a whim. It’s not a foolish fancy. I want, very much indeed, to see her!’
<name>Mr. Mell</name>	Mr. Mell	Littimer	I had no reason to believe that [MASK] understood such arts himself; he never led me to suppose anything of the kind, by so much as the vibration of one of his respectable eyelashes; yet whenever he was by, while we were practising, I felt myself the greenest and most inexperienced of mortals.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Rosa	‘You have seen my son, sir,’ says the elder lady. ‘Are you reconciled?’ Looking fixedly at me, she puts her hand to her forehead, and moans. Suddenly, she cries, in a terrible voice, ‘[MASK], come to me.
<name>The dog</name>	The dog	Jip	I was full of eloquence. I never stopped for a word. I told her how I loved her. I told her I should die without her. I told her that I idolized and worshipped her. [MASK] barked madly all the time.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Dora	I do. All else grows dim, and fades away. I am again with [MASK], in our cottage. I do not know how long she has been ill. I am so used to it in feeling, that I cannot count the time.
<name>Mr. Pickwick</name>	Mr. Pickwick	Traddles	Nobody would have thought so, to see her sitting upright, with her arms folded; but she had wonderful self-command. ‘Then I am delighted to say,’ cried [MASK], beaming with joy, ‘that we have recovered the whole money!’
<name>Mr. Peggotty</name>	Mr. Peggotty	Ham	‘Well, sir, if you can make out here, fur a fortnut, ‘long wi’ her,’ nodding at his sister, ‘and [MASK], and little Em’ly, we shall be proud of your company.’
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Steerforth	‘You pretend to have bought it for yourself, but you have really done so to confer a benefit on him. I might have known as much at first, knowing you. My dear kind [MASK], how can I tell you what I think of your generosity?’
<name>Ury</name>	Ury	Agnes	Once she asked for a particular ballad, which she said her Ury (who was yawning in a great chair) doted on; and at intervals she looked round at him, and reported to [MASK] that he was in raptures with the music.
<name>Hunk</name>	Hunk	Steerforth	You never saw such a rusty Prince in all your born days as he was. Like old iron!’ ‘Is that why you called him a humbug, just now?’ inquired [MASK]. ‘Oh, you’re a broth of a boy, ain’t you?’
<name>Lucie</name>	Lucie	Dora	When [MASK] hung her head and cried, and trembled, my eloquence increased so much the more. If she would like me to die for her, she had but to say the word, and I was ready.
<name>Mother</name>	Mother	Peggotty	If I started off at once, and tried to walk back home, how could I ever find my way, how could I ever hope to walk so far, how could I make sure of anyone but [MASK], even if I got back?
<name>Estella</name>	Estella	Agnes	When it was almost dark, he lay down on a sofa, [MASK] pillowing his head and bending over him a little while; and when she came back to the window, it was not so dark but I could see tears glittering in her eyes.
<name>Little Nell</name>	Little Nell	Peggotty	And I shall be always near my pretty’s resting-place,’ said [MASK], musing, ‘and be able to see it when I like; and when I lie down to rest, I may be laid not far off from my darling girl!’
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Traddles	For this he had drawn a note-of-hand with great neatness, which he handed over to [MASK] on the spot, a discharge of his debt in full (as between man and man), with many acknowledgements.
<name>Mr. Jaggers</name>	Mr. Jaggers	Copperfield	His little failings would only have endeared him to you the more. But if you would like to hear my fellow-partner eloquently spoken of, I should refer you to [MASK]. The family is a subject he’s very strong upon, if you never heard him.’
<name>John</name>	John	Steerforth	‘None of your close shavers the Prince ain’t. You’d say so, if you saw his moustachios. Red by nature, black by art.’ ‘By your art, of course,’ said [MASK].
<name>Amyas</name>	Amyas	Barkis	His arm lay on it now. Time and the world were slipping from beneath him, but the box was there; and the last words he had uttered were (in an explanatory tone) ‘Old clothes!’ ‘[MASK], my dear!’
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Copperfield	he rejoined. I deigned to make him no reply; and, taking up my hat, was going out to bed, when he came between me and the door. ‘[MASK],’ he said, ‘there must be two parties to a quarrel.
<name>Mrs. Proudie</name>	Mrs. Proudie	Peggotty	With a window near it, out of which our house can be seen, and IS seen many times during the morning’s service, by [MASK], who likes to make herself as sure as she can that it’s not being robbed, or is not in flames.
<name>Edwin</name>	Edwin	Agnes	‘At the time I speak of, as the time when papa spoke to me,’ pursued [MASK], ‘he had told papa that he was going away; that he was very sorry, and unwilling to leave, but that he had better prospects.
<name>Mr. Collins</name>	Mr. Collins	Traddles	The deference which both she and [MASK] showed towards the Beauty, pleased me very much. I don’t know that I thought it very reasonable; but I thought it very delightful, and essentially a part of their character.
<name>Peter</name>	Peter	Peggotty	It is nothing smaller than the Crocodile Book, which is in rather a dilapidated condition by this time, with divers of the leaves torn and stitched across, but which [MASK] exhibits to the children as a precious relic.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Peggotty	I had been reading to [MASK] about crocodiles. I must have read very perspicuously, or the poor soul must have been deeply interested, for I remember she had a cloudy impression, after I had done, that they were a sort of vegetable.
<name>Jerry</name>	Jerry	Uriah	‘To who, sir?’ said [MASK], stretching out his neck, and shading his ear with his hand. ‘To the hangman,’ I returned. ‘The most unlikely person I could think of,’--though his own face had suggested the allusion quite as a natural sequence.
<name>Miss Watson</name>	Miss Watson	Peggotty	Sometimes I fancied that [MASK] perhaps objected to my mother’s wearing all the pretty dresses she had in her drawers, or to her going so often to visit at that neighbour’s; but I couldn’t, to my satisfaction, make out how it was.
<name>Mrs. Cratchit</name>	Mrs. Cratchit	Lord	All the other furniture is plain and serviceable, you perceive. And as to plate, [MASK] bless you, we haven’t so much as a tea-spoon.’ ‘All to be earned?’ said I, cheerfully.
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Peggotty	That is among my very earliest impressions. That, and a sense that we were both a little afraid of [MASK], and submitted ourselves in most things to her direction, were among the first opinions--if they may be so called--that I ever derived from what I saw.
<name>her</name>	her	Peggotty	We then turned back towards my chambers. As the shops had charms for [MASK] which I never knew them possess in the same degree for anybody else, I sauntered easily along, amused by her staring in at the windows, and waiting for her as often as she chose.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Agnes	yes!--Agnes, sitting on the seat before me, in the same box, with a lady and gentleman beside her, whom I didn’t know. I see her face now, better than I did then, I dare say, with its indelible look of regret and wonder turned upon me. ‘[MASK]!’
<name>Abel Magwitch</name>	Abel Magwitch	Steerforth	‘Well!’ said [MASK]. ‘We must make it stretch as far as we can; that’s all. I’ll do the best in my power for you. I can go out when I like, and I’ll smuggle the prog in.’
<name>Steerforth</name>	Steerforth	Steerforth	‘Yes; or hate,’ laughed [MASK]; ‘no matter which. Come! Say the next day!’ I said the next day; and he put on his great-coat and lighted his cigar, and set off to walk home.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Em’ly	[MASK] was confused by our all observing her, and hung down her head, and her face was covered with blushes. Glancing up presently through her stray curls, and seeing that we were all looking at her still (I am sure
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Dora	‘No blood-relation,’ I replied; ‘but we were brought up together, like brother and sister.’ ‘I wonder why you ever fell in love with me?’ said [MASK], beginning on another button of my coat.
<name>Mrs. Watson</name>	Mrs. Watson	Peggotty	In the course of that letter, I told [MASK] that I had a particular occasion for half a guinea; and that if she could lend me that sum until I could repay it, I should be very much obliged to her, and would tell her afterwards what I had wanted it for.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Steerforth’s	The repetition to any ears--even to [MASK]--of what she had been unable to repress when her heart lay open to me by an accident, I felt would be a rough deed, unworthy of myself, unworthy of the light of our pure childhood, which I always saw encircling her head.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Steerforth	said [MASK], returning. ‘I am glad to see them. How are you both?’ There was an ease in his manner--a gay and light manner it was, but not swaggering--which I still believe to have borne a kind of enchantment with it.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Doctor	Duty, my dear [MASK], before every consideration in the universe!’ She was as good as her word. She was one of those people who can bear a great deal of pleasure, and she never flinched in her perseverance in the cause.
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Steerforth	‘Why, what on earth does she do here?’ said [MASK]. ‘It appears to be her native part of the country, sir. She informs me that she makes one of her professional visits here, every year, sir.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Peggotty	Another silence followed this, and another gentle beating on my hand. ‘It was pretty far in the night,’ said [MASK], ‘when she asked me for some drink; and when she had taken it, gave me such a patient smile, the dear!--so beautiful!
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Ham	She was with him all day. As I had a sorrowful wish to see the old place once more, before it was locked up, I engaged to meet them there in the evening. But I so arranged it, as that I should meet [MASK] first.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Peggotty	But, to be sure, he would be idle here--or anywhere, in my opinion.’ [MASK] had an angry answer ready, I could see; but she swallowed it for my sake, and remained silent.
<name>Mr. Barkis</name>	Mr. Barkis	Steerforth	‘You’ll be glad to spend another shilling or so, in almond cakes, I dare say?’ I said, Yes, I should like that, too. ‘And another shilling or so in biscuits, and another in fruit, eh?’ said [MASK].
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Steerforth	But he slept--let me think of him so again--as I had often seen him sleep at school; and thus, in this silent hour, I left him. --Never more, oh God forgive you, [MASK]! to touch that passive hand in love and friendship.
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Traddles	Her son sat her down in his chair; and, standing sulkily by her, holding her arm with his hand, but not rudely, said to me, with a ferocious look: ‘What do you want done?’ ‘I will tell you what must be done,’ said [MASK].
<name>Sissy</name>	Sissy	Lord	‘Oh, [MASK]!’ he said, shaking his head, ‘that’s the school where they broke the boy’s ribs--two ribs--a little boy he was. I should say he was--let me see--how old are you, about?’
<name>Estella</name>	Estella	Dora	Our dearest [MASK] is a favourite child of nature. She is a thing of light, and airiness, and joy. I am free to confess that if it could be done, it might be well, but--’
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Dora	[MASK] lies smiling on us, and is beautiful, and utters no hasty or complaining word. She says that we are very good to her; that her dear old careful boy is tiring himself out, she knows; that my aunt has no sleep, yet is always wakeful, active, and kind.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Peggotty	‘At least, you can if you like. You needn’t if you don’t like.’ I hastened to comply with his friendly suggestion, and opening [MASK]’s purse, turned it upside down into his hand. ‘Do you want to spend anything now?’
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Steerforth	I have bought a boat down here?’ ‘What an extraordinary fellow you are, [MASK]!’ I exclaimed, stopping--for this was the first I had heard of it. ‘When you may never care to come near the place again!’
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Trot	What are you thinking of, [MASK]?’ I was thinking of all that had been said. My mind was still running on some of the expressions used. ‘There can be no disparity in marriage like unsuitability of mind and purpose.’
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Steerforth	[MASK], dismissing the subject with a light nod, and a smile, and the remark that he would be glad to see the old fellow too, for he had always been an odd fish, inquired if I could give him anything to eat?
<name>David</name>	David	Agnes	‘Goodness me!’ said my aunt, peering through the dusk, ‘who’s this you’re bringing home?’ ‘[MASK],’ said I. As we had arranged to say nothing at first, my aunt was not a little discomfited.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Agnes	Her colour came and went once more; and once more, as she bent her head, I saw the same sad smile. ‘You will wait and see papa,’ said [MASK], cheerfully, ‘and pass the day with us?
<name>Hardy</name>	Hardy	Traddles	Were they not?’ ‘When she told you you would be a judge? But it was not the town talk then!’ ‘At all events,’ says [MASK], ‘if I ever am one--’ ‘Why, you know you will be.’
<name>Grandmother</name>	Grandmother	Peggotty	The cheeks and arms of [MASK], so hard and red in my childish days, when I wondered why the birds didn’t peck her in preference to apples, are shrivelled now; and her eyes, that used to darken their whole neighbourhood in her face, are fainter (though they glitter still);
<name>my dear</name>	my dear	Dora	He is getting quite slow and lazy.’ ‘I suspect, my dear,’ said my aunt quietly working by her side, ‘he has a worse disorder than that. Age, [MASK].’ ‘Do you think he is old?’
<name>Uriah</name>	Uriah	Uriah	‘Before I come here,’ said [MASK], stealing a look at us, as if he would have blighted the outer world to which we belonged, if he could, ‘I was given to follies; but now I am sensible of my follies.
<name>John</name>	John	Peggotty	I hid my tears in the bedclothes, and pressed her from me with my hand, when she would have raised me up. ‘This is your doing, [MASK], you cruel thing!’ said my mother. ‘I have no doubt at all about it.
<name>Clarence</name>	Clarence	Traddles	Oh yes. Yes. He has a kind of talent for drawing briefs, and stating a case in writing, plainly. I am able to throw something in [MASK]’s way, in the course of the year; something--for him--considerable. Oh yes.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Peregrine	We seem, to me, to have been months over [MASK], and months more over the other stories. The institution never flagged for want of a story, I am certain; and the wine lasted out almost as well as the matter.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Doctor	‘Therefore, my dear [MASK],’ said the Old Soldier, giving him several affectionate taps, ‘you may command me, at all times and seasons. Now, do understand that I am entirely at your service.
