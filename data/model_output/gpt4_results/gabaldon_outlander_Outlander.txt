<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Jamie	I stopped dead. I had been so intent on arguing with [MASK] that it had not until this minute dawned on me that the situation I had been vainly trying to bring about for two months had finally occurred. I was alone. And I knew where I was.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Jamie	I glared at [MASK], curled into a ball by the door. He was breathing evenly, but lightly; perhaps he couldn’t sleep either. I hoped not. I had been inclined at first to take this whole remarkable misadventure as melodrama; such things just did not happen in real life.
<name>Mildred</name>	Mildred	Geilie	Well, I suppose this is his idea of a suitable disposal of the problem.” I was silent for a long time, mulling things over. “[MASK],” I said at last, “that stomach trouble of your husband’s . . .”
<name>Rob</name>	Rob	Frank	“Well, not so unusual an appearance for these parts, surely? I’ve seen men dressed like that in the village now and then.” “Nooo . . .” [MASK] sounded doubtful. “No, it wasn’t his dress that was odd.
<name>Geordie</name>	Geordie	Rabbie	“Now, in the regular way, o’ course I’d not interfere. A man’s son’s his ain to do as he sees fit wi’, but . . . weel, [MASK]’s a bit of a favorite o’ mine.
<name>Professor</name>	Professor	Colum	Turning, I could see nothing but backs and heads, as people leapt from their benches to gather round whatever had caused the uproar. [MASK] made his way with some difficulty around the table, clearing aside the crowd with an impatient wave of the hand.
<name>Jamie</name>	Jamie	Sassenach	I turned back, to find him sitting on the bed, looking at me with a shamefaced smile. “I’m sorry, [MASK]. My bowels are griping, and I’ve a damn evil temper this morning. But I’ve no call to snarl at ye.
<name>Adler</name>	Adler	Randall	“You want me to take you to [MASK]?” “No!” Something occurred to me. “So at least you believe me when I say I’m not an English spy?” “I do now. ” He spoke with some emphasis.
<name>Claire</name>	Claire	Claire	I’m sorry for using ye as I did just now. To take you like that, so soon after . . . like some sort of animal. I’m sorry, [MASK] ... I don’t know what ... I couldna help it, but . . .
<name>Claire</name>	Claire	Claire	I must part wi’ ye now.” My lips were too stiff to speak, but the expression on my face must have been as easily readable as usual. “[MASK],” he said urgently, “it’s your own time on the other side of . . .
<name>Jamie</name>	Jamie	Colum	“Money?” he said blankly. “Yes, money!” I blazed, angered at his pretense of ignorance. “When we came back, you couldn’t wait to tell [MASK] you were married and collect your share of the MacKenzie rents!”
<name>Chade</name>	Chade	Jamie	[MASK]’s good hand, the fine straight fingers rimmed with gold in the light, gripped the table-edge hard. With an effort I could only guess at, he lowered himself slowly into a chair and deliberately spread both hands flat before him on the scarred wood surface, the mallet within easy reach.
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Jamie	She put out a hand to stop [MASK]’s protest, and the gull-winged brows rose in a graceful arc of inquiry. “And if your life is a suitable exchange for my honor, tell me why my honor is not a suitable exchange for your life?”
<name>Sebastian</name>	Sebastian	Anselm	At the hour when time began to slow, I genuflected in the aisle of the chapel of St. Giles. [MASK] was there, elegant shoulders straight beneath his habit, but no other. He neither moved nor looked around, but the living silence of the chapel embraced me.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Jamie	Then, raising his eyebrows, he nodded in my direction and waved his stubby hands in a strangely graceful interrogatory gesture. “My wife,” said [MASK], reddening slightly with a mixture of shyness and pride at the new introduction. “Married but the two days.”
<name>Her</name>	Her	Jamie	Her spouse sank down on his haunches beside me, and began to rub [MASK]’s frozen feet in a businesslike way between large blunt-fingered hands, pausing occasionally to sip his whisky. Turning back the blankets in bits, I surveyed the damage.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Dougal	I could easily imagine that there were fairies on the hill, dancing with those shadows, threading their way through the slender trunks to blend into the depths of the wood. “[MASK]’s not back yet, either,” I observed as we came down the hill.
<name>Vladimir</name>	Vladimir	Dougal	[MASK] greeted my appearance with a nod. He crossed himself, bent his head, and scooped up a double handful of water. The water had an odd dark color, and a worse smell—likely a sulfur spring, I thought.
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Charlie	“They’ll go for the throat,” [MASK] had instructed me, “unless their trainer tells them otherwise. Keep looking him in the eye; you’ll see it when he makes up his mind to jump. That’s your moment.”
<name>Laoghaire</name>	Laoghaire	Geordie	“Many of them,” I said, just as flatly. And pulling myself free, I left him standing there and went to tend my living patient. The death of [MASK], hideous as it was, put only a momentary damper on the celebrations.
<name>Jamie</name>	Jamie	Sassenach	Weak as he was, there was no mistaking the basic stubbornness. “I’ll do best alone. And I’m not sleepy now. Do ye go and find your own supper, [MASK]. I’ll . . . just read for a bit.”
<name>Yaroslavna</name>	Yaroslavna	Mary	It goes: “Tomorrow I shall be on a hill, without a head. Have you no compassion for my sorrowful maiden, My [MASK], the fair and tender-eyed?,} I took his hand and squeezed it lightly.
<name>Angus</name>	Angus	Colum	He drained the heavy cup to the last drop, lowered it with an explosive gasp for air, and handed it back to [MASK]. “The honor is mine,” he said, a little hoarsely, “to be allied with a clan whose taste in whisky is so fine.”
<name>Jamie</name>	Jamie	Jamie	There’s several about the Duke as ha’ traded a sore arse for lands and offices.” “Ye’ll notice I havena got either one,” responded [MASK] with a grin, to further roars of laughter. “What? Never even got close?”
<name>Roger</name>	Roger	Jamie	I could scarcely pull my horrified gaze away from [MASK], but saw the little clansman draw his pistol, so far unfired, in a leisurely manner. He checked the firing mechanism carefully, rubbed the weapon on his sleeve, braced it on his forearm and waited.
<name>Roger</name>	Roger	Frank	And he had died a childless bachelor. Or at least I thought so. The chart— that cursed chart!—had given the date of his marriage, sometime in 1744. And the birth of his son, [MASK]’s five-times-great-grandfather, soon after.
<name>Geillis</name>	Geillis	Jenny	After all, she’s a woman, though she’s not borne a child yet.” [MASK] eyed my midriff appraisingly, and I felt that small pang once more. “Mmm, perhaps.” She spoke slowly, thinking.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jamie	“No, it isn’t. It’s an awful story. It’s just ... I can see you sitting there, being stubborn about it, with your jaw clenched and steam coming out of your ears.” [MASK] snorted, but laughed a little too.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Frank	“Not at all, not at all.” The vicar flapped a hand in embarrassment. “Nice to have a bit of young life about the house. Now, do have a seat.” [MASK] began talking even before I had set my handbag down.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Lot	I stayed stiff as [MASK]’s wife, but he persisted, caressing my hair and rubbing my shoulders in the way he knew I liked. “No, I don’t think any such thing,” he said firmly.
<name>Jamie</name>	Jamie	Murtagh	“Gie me your purse for safekeeping,” said [MASK], unsmiling, watching the young man swaggering toward us with a gay disregard of the rain soaking his colorful shirt. “And dinna turn your back on anyone.”
<name>She</name>	She	Ned	This person, it developed, was the village sempstress, recruited to repair the deficiencies of my wardrobe by adjusting the fit of a dress, obtained on short notice from some local connection of the innkeeper’s. [MASK] was carrying the dress in question, hanging from one hand like a dead animal.
<name>Black Jack</name>	Black Jack	Randall	And he’s a bonny fighter, with verra good reason to hate [MASK]. Nay, marry him, and he’ll fight to his last breath to protect ye.” “But . . . but I can’t marry anyone!” I burst put.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Jamie	“But if anyone does come up here,” I protested, “they’ll find you then.” He reached a long arm out to grasp the swinging shutter and pulled it to. The hall was plunged in blackness, and [MASK] appeared as no more than a shapeless bulk.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Claire	He leaned his forearms against a rough-barked pine and let his head drop onto them, exhausted. His voice was so low I could barely hear him. “You’re tearin’ my guts out, [MASK].” Something very similar was happening to my own.
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Jamie	“When it’s green, nothing. First you dry it, and then—” I was interrupted by a terrific noise of barking and shouting, coming from outside the garden wall. I raced through the downpour toward the wall, followed more slowly by [MASK], limping.
<name>Jamie</name>	Jamie	Murtagh	“And if ye’ve lived so long without knowing better than to stand between a nursing mother and a hungry child, you’ve not sense enough to hunt hogs, let alone find a man in the heather.” [MASK] raised his hands in surrender.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Jamie	[MASK] stretched slightly in his seat, grimacing in mild discomfort. “On the other hand,” he said, “my bladder’s going to burst in another moment or two. I’ll be back shortly.”
<name>Jamie</name>	Jamie	Jamie	There was something black pressed against his head. My eyes at last adjusting to the glare, I saw it was a musket barrel. “Get up, you rutting bastard.” The barrel moved sharply, jarring against [MASK]’s temple. Very slowly, he rose to his feet.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Jamie	There were even ducks on the pond, teal and goldeneye paused for a rest on their southern flight. “Look,” I said, pausing at the top of the hill, putting a hand on [MASK]’s arm to stop him. “Isn’t it lovely?”
<name>Dougal</name>	Dougal	Alec	“Stubborn as your Da, ye are,” remarked [MASK], though the words held a tone of grudging approval. “You’ve the look of him about ye sometimes, for all you’re tall and fair as your mother’s folk.”
<name>Alaric</name>	Alaric	Jamie	And that, after all, had been the point of this ridiculous arrangement. I stole a glance at [MASK], riding ahead now. His back was straight as an alder sapling and his hair shone under the sun like a helmet of burnished metal.
<name>Argo</name>	Argo	Donas	The standing stones on the hilltop were invisible from below, but they seemed to emanate a subtle terror that reached out for me. Well below the summit, the footing grew too uncertain for [MASK]. We dismounted and tethered him to a scrubby pine, continuing on foot.
<name>MacLeod</name>	MacLeod	Jamie	I had always loved watching them as he lectured. “Tell me about your husband,” said [MASK], as though he had been reading my mind. I almost jerked my hands away in shock. “What?” “Look ye, lass.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jamie	As his head turned slowly toward the window, his right hand, shielded from [MASK]’s view, left my breast, sliding stealthily toward the knife, which he had laid on the desk next to my head. “ What did you say?” he said, incredulously.
<name>Donas</name>	Donas	Losgann	I hadn’t realized just how valuable a horse [MASK] was, and mentally thanked whatever benign spirits presided over such events that nothing had gone wrong. “Nonsense,” I said, trying to give it back. “I didn’t do anything out of the way.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Geilie	It’s wet out, and growing dark as well. We must leave ourselves, or we’ll get naught but scraps to our dinner.” He bowed to [MASK] and turned to go. “Wait a bit,” she said to me.
<name>Ian</name>	Ian	Alec	“The de’il’s customarily a black stallion, though, is he no?” “Oh, aye,” said [MASK]. “A great black stallion, that travels as fast as the thought between a man and a maid.”
<name>Jamie</name>	Jamie	Jamie	“Thank you,” he said, with some difficulty, and bowed formally to the bigger man before turning to go. The attention of the crowd shifted back to the MacKenzie and the next case before him. I saw [MASK] leave the hall by the door in the opposite wall.
<name>Seamus</name>	Seamus	Hamish	“And this is my son, [MASK],” he said, dropping a hand on the shoulder of a handsome red-haired lad of seven or eight, who took his eyes off the waiting platter just long enough to acknowledge my presence with a quick nod.
<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Jenny	“He’ll be gone,” [MASK] said, sitting down on a log and fanning herself. I thought she looked pale, and realized that kidnapping and threatening armed men was no pursuit for a woman who had given birth less than a week before.
<name>Ubertino</name>	Ubertino	Anselm	He turned toward the bed and I looked wildly to [MASK] for explanation. “The sacrament of Extreme Unction,” he explained, moving close so that his low tones would not disturb the monks gathered around the bed. “The Last Anointing.” “Last Anointing!
<name>Godfrey</name>	Godfrey	Roger	“Not feeling well?” This was asked with a mingled tone of concern and hope. “No, I’m quite well. I was only thinking . . .” I hesitated, because we had discussed this matter before. “I was thinking about [MASK].”
<name>Nanny</name>	Nanny	Geilie	“Its parents,” [MASK] said briefly, restraining me with a hand on my arm. “Leave it. Let’s get out of here.” “Its parents?” I said indignantly. “But—” “It’s a changeling,” she said impatiently.
<name>Chade</name>	Chade	Jamie	“But whatever you are to do, you will require strength for it. So take one last bit of advice: when in doubt, eat.” When I came into [MASK]’s room in the evening, he was asleep, head pillowed on his forearms.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Jamie	[MASK]. The thought of him was a leaden weight in my mind, a pendulum swinging slowly at the end of a rope. Not long. The road stretched endless and dreary before us, sometimes petering out altogether into frozen marshes or open sheets of water that had once been meadows and moors.
<name>Macpherson</name>	Macpherson	Ronnie	He stared meditatively at me for a moment, then turned back to his tenant. “Well then, [MASK], that will do for the grain allotment. There’s the one other thing I meant to speak wi’ you about, though.
<name>hand</name>	hand	Jamie	Tonight he had fallen asleep by the fire while we sat talking over the wine, but no one had remembered to carry him up to his bed. My own [MASK] turned me to face him, smoothing my hair away from his nose.
<name>Jamie</name>	Jamie	Jamie	“You are welcome, ma niece,” he said, inclining his head. I was a little startled at the greeting, but bowed back. “I’m grateful for your hospitality,” I said, meaning it. “Have—have you seen [MASK]?”
<name>Jamie</name>	Jamie	Murtagh	Luckily, [MASK] was better prepared. Well, after all, he hadn’t been occupied in fighting off lecherous advances. “We’ll need money,” he said promptly. “And men.” He cast an eye appraisingly over the bundles stacked against the wall.
<name>Jamie</name>	Jamie	Claire	“Do ye sleep a bit, [MASK]. You’re worn out, and likely someone will want to talk wi’ ye before too long.” This was a sinister reminder of my precarious position, but I was too exhausted to care much.
<name>Claire</name>	Claire	Sassenach	“How the bloody hell did you know what I was thinking?” I demanded, ignoring the grin. He shook his head good-naturedly. “You’d make a verra poor spy, [MASK]. Everything ye think shows on your face, plain as day.
<name>Jamie</name>	Jamie	Alec	[MASK] made a guttural sound of his own. “Then you stay here, laddie. Be master of horse in my place; I’ll not last so much longer, and there’s no better hand I’ve seen wi’ a horse.”
<name>Thrain</name>	Thrain	Colum	It seemed hopeless to tell which of all the folk in the Castle might also be missing, but [MASK] called all of the servants, and went doggedly down the lists of the invited, asking who had been seen the evening before, and where, and when.
<name>Lancelot</name>	Lancelot	Jamie	[MASK] drew the sword completely, with a flash of steel, then thrust it point-first into the ground, leaving the hilt quivering with the force of the blow. “I draw it in defense of this woman, and the truth,” he said.
<name>Officer</name>	Officer	Randall	There was a dull crunching sound as his other fist splintered the officer’s nose, and a fine spray of blood spattered my skirt. [MASK]’s eyes rolled up in his head, and he dropped to the floor like a stone.
<name>Alan</name>	Alan	Murtagh	[MASK] glanced up coldly from his parritch. “That she wasna, and I’ll thank ye to keep a civil tongue when ye speak of the lady. Her husband was my mother’s brother. And she was sore grieved for ye, I’ll ha’ ye to know.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Weel	Her head came up to look at him. “[MASK], I did then,” she said. “It was all I could think of, and I could see that he was fair off" his head, but it was plain too that he . . .
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	John	I gritted my teeth and held tight to my fury; it was the only thing I had to combat my fear. There was an air of breathless expectancy, punctuated by the excited murmurs and shouts from the crowd of watchers. “Give it ’er, [MASK]!”
<name>Ian</name>	Ian	Jamie	“My hair? What’s wrong wi’ my hair?” [MASK] demanded, putting a hand up to check. Grown nearly to shoulder-length, he had as usual laced it back with a leather thong to keep it out of his face.
<name>Rupert</name>	Rupert	Willie	“Dinna blame ye a bit.” “[MASK]!” he called to one of the men outside. “We need some clothes, here. Something suitable for the laird’s nephew. See to it, man, and hurry!”
<name>Ratcliffe</name>	Ratcliffe	Murtagh	He didn’t answer, but gave me a half-smile in reply. He suddenly seemed very young, and I wondered just how old he was. I was about to ask when a raspy cough from behind announced a visitor to the shed. It was the stringy little man named [MASK].
<name>Dougal</name>	Dougal	Jamie	If I were married to a Scot, I would presumably no longer be watched and guarded. It would be that much easier to get away when the time came. And if it were [MASK]—well, he liked me, clearly.
<name>Ann</name>	Ann	Annabelle	“And a heid like an ox. Have ye any o’ that laudanum left that Lady [MASK] gave ye?” “Yes, all of it. He wouldn’t take it; doesn’t want to sleep, he said.” “Aye, well.
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Frank	There was only one way to go from this point. I went, dagger still gripped at the ready. It was eerie to be pacing softly down this corridor. I had seen similar dungeons before, as a day-tripper, visiting historic castles with [MASK].
<name>Roger</name>	Roger	Murtagh	The bannocks were steaming gently in the cool air, and smelt heavenly. I reached for one, the heavy boar’s-tooth bracelets clinking together on my wrist. I saw [MASK]’s eyes on them and adjusted them so he could see the engraved silver end pieces.
<name>Kurtz</name>	Kurtz	Munro	[MASK] then began an extraordinary ballet of the hands, motioning to himself, away down toward the forest, at me, and back to himself, with such an array of gestures and wavings that I could hardly follow his flying hands.
<name>Colum</name>	Colum	Colum	There were some forty people sat to eat, and perhaps another ten to serve. The air was loud with conversation, most of it in Gaelic. [MASK] was already seated at a table at the head of the room, stunted legs tucked out of sight beneath the scarred oak.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Geilie	Casting a glance over my shoulder, I saw [MASK] being moved away in the opposite direction, back straight, refusing to be hurried, or for that matter, to acknowledge her surroundings in any way. In the dark back room of the inn, my bonds were at last removed, and a candle brought.
<name>Jamie</name>	Jamie	Jamie	I came up to find [MASK] eyeing me steadily. “I said I wouldna ask for anything you did not wish to tell me,” he said, “and I won’t, but I draw my own conclusions.
<name>Moira</name>	Moira	Jenny	It’s good to see ye, man. We’re pleased you’re home, and your wife with ye. Are we not, mi dhuV he demanded of [MASK], his fingers tightening perceptibly on her shoulder. She was not one to be forced into anything.
<name>Morna</name>	Morna	Jenny	“Those were [MASK]’s tame birds. Anytime there was a bird found wi’ a lame leg or a broken wing, whoever found it would bring it along, and in days she’d have it healed, and eatin’ from her hand.
<name>Blackbeard</name>	Blackbeard	Colum	He’s quick, and he’s ruthless, is [MASK].” The single ice-blue eye swiveled back to regard me over one humped shoulder. “Ye’d be wise to bear that in mind, lassie.”
<name>Blackjack</name>	Blackjack	Donas	When I reached the cottage, breathless with fear lest he had left already, I was reassured to see [MASK] hobbled and grazing nearby. The horse raised his head and eyed me unpleasantly. Walking softly, I pushed the door open.
<name>Jamie</name>	Jamie	Ian	He closed his mouth and swallowed once, clearly having no idea what to do next. “[MASK],” he said, a little weakly. “You’re married, then?” “Oh, aye,” his brother-in-law said cheerfully.
<name>Jamie</name>	Jamie	Ian	“It’s [MASK]’s, but he has another,” she said. “Put it into your stocking top, and hold it with your garter. Don’t leave it off, even when ye sleep.” She paused a moment, as though there were something else she meant to say.
<name>Claire</name>	Claire	Claire	He was half doubled up, face contorted with internal struggle, and his voice was strangled and breathless. “[MASK] . . . please. Please go. I’m going to be verra sick, and I don’t want you to see it. Please.”
<name>Clary</name>	Clary	Myosotis	“How did they know where to start and stop?” “Good question. I don’t see anything.” Casting an eye over the ground, though, I did see an interesting plant growing near the base of one of the tall stones. [MASK]?
<name>Jamie</name>	Jamie	Och	“Brrr,” I said, watching them. The weather was fine for autumn, but there was enough of a nip in the air to make me glad of the shawl I’d brought. “It makes my blood run cold, just to see them.” “[MASK]?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jamie	The cold, damp air that streamed in was refreshing, and did something to calm the throbbing that had started in my temples as I stared into the reflecting water, remembering. There was a faint moan behind me, and [MASK] stirred in the draft. Good.
<name>Quasimodo</name>	Quasimodo	Jamie	“Boiling oil,” said [MASK]. “It’s how they force captive Christians to convert to the Mussulman religion.” “It looks a very effective means of persuasion,” I said. “So that’s why several parishes will give him leave to beg?
<name>Alan</name>	Alan	Jamie	A bit more, lad?” “Aye, thanks.” There was a short silence, broken by [MASK]. “No, I canna say it’s much comfort to me, but thank ye for tellin’ me.”
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Frank	“What did he look like?” “Big chap,” said [MASK], frowning in recollection. “And a Scot, in complete Highland rig-out, complete to sporran and the most beautiful running-stag brooch on his plaid.
<name>Diana</name>	Diana	Ian	[MASK] nodded, reassured. “Oh, aye. But you’ve a few weeks yet.” It was a beautiful bright autumn day, with air like cider and a sky so blue you could drown in it.
<name>Edmond</name>	Edmond	Rupert	But [MASK]’s card-playing acquaintances among the guards had assured him that the governor’s habits were invariable; the bell for dinner was rung promptly at one, and the soup served five minutes later. The guard on duty at the entrance was the same as the day before.
<name>he</name>	he	Jamie	It was awkward to get the iron manacle correctly positioned so that one side was braced by the wall, as this required that [MASK] cross the manacled leg under the other and press his knee to the wall on the far side. My first two blows were too weak and timorous.
<name>Quine</name>	Quine	Geilie	Would I have heard, somewhere in the scented fog, the standard hypnotist’s injunction, “When you wake, you will remember nothing”? But I did remember, and I wondered. In the event, however, there was no chance to ask [MASK] about it.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Jenny	His lips curved at once in a soft, reflexive smile, then relaxed into sleep once more. [MASK], watching him, said, “That’s funny, that is. I’ve not seen him do that since he was quite small.” “Do what?”
<name>Jamie</name>	Jamie	D’ye	He twisted the badge loose from the bonnet and smiled sourly at it, weighing it speculatively in his hand. “[MASK] ken my own motto, lass?” he asked. “My clan’s, I mean?” “No,” I answered, startled.
<name>Strong</name>	Strong	Modest	“Aye, that was the way of it. I was big for my age, or tall at least; a good swordsman even then, and a better horseman than most.” “[MASK], too,” I said. “Not very.
