<name>What</name>	What	what?"--she	"What do you, in particular, call its work?" "Well, to see me through." "But through [MASK] liked to get it all out of him. "Why through this experience." That was all that would come.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Waymarsh	And the thing will be much better if we have our own man in it." "If you have your own man in it, in other words," [MASK] said, "you'll marry--you personally--more money.
<name>Mrs. Jordan</name>	Mrs. Jordan	Chad	She would alight from her headlong course more or less directly upon him; it would be appointed to him, unquestionably, to receive her entire weight. Signs and portents of the experience thus in reserve for him had as it happened, multiplied even through the dazzle of [MASK]'s party.
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Jeanne	Our young man's people had seen her; one of his sisters, a charming woman--we know all about them--had observed her somewhere with me. She had spoken to her brother--turned him on; and we were again observed, poor [MASK]
<name>Maurice</name>	Maurice	Chad	"He'll go in a moment if you give him the word--he assures me on his honour he'll do that": this came in its order, out of its order, in respect to [MASK], after the crash had occurred.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Strether	"No. How CAN I?" "Do you mean because of your being so saddled with him?" "I'm thinking of his mother," said [MASK] after a moment. "He has darkened her admirable life." He spoke with austerity.
<name>Harney</name>	Harney	Pocock	"Oh don't you know her well enough," [MASK] asked, "to have noticed that she never gives herself away, any more than her mother ever does? They ain't fierce, either of 'em; they let you come quite close.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Chad	"Why it's the whole question." "Of my going home?" [MASK] was clearly surprised. "Oh not much! Do you think that when I want to go any one will have any power--" "To keep you"--Strether took him straight up--"from carrying out your wish?
<name>Maisie</name>	Maisie	Strether	But when [MASK] presently spoke it wasn't in answer. "It's not, I gather, that your mother's physically ill; her health, on the whole, this spring, seems to have been better than usual.
<name>Maisie</name>	Maisie	Sarah	"It couldn't but be ignorantly." "Well, intensity with ignorance--what do you want worse?" This question might have held him, but he let it pass. "[MASK] isn't ignorant--now; she keeps up the theory of the horrible."
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Maria	All these people--the people of the English mother's side--had been of condition more or less eminent; yet with oddities and disparities that had often since made [MASK], thinking them over, wonder what they really quite rhymed to.
<name>Longdon</name>	Longdon	Strether	"I can't see for my life," [MASK] had then observed, "how a young fellow of any spirit--such a one as you for instance--can be admitted to the sight of that young lady without being hard hit.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Strether	"Fancy having to take at the point of the bayonet a whole moral and intellectual being or block!" "It was in fact," said [MASK], "what, at home, I HAD done. But somehow over there I didn't quite know it."
<name>Chad</name>	Chad	Mrs.	" With which she put again her question. "Has [MASK] Newsome money?" This time he heeded. "Oh plenty. That's the root of the evil. There's money, to very large amounts, in the concern.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Strether	"How often do you write?" "Oh perpetually." "And at great length?" [MASK] had become a little impatient. "I hope it's not found too great." "Oh I'm sure not. And you hear as often?"
<name>Mitchell</name>	Mitchell	Strether	[MASK] had thrown back his head as in silent mirth over something that struck him in her audacity or felicity, and her flight meanwhile was already higher. "Therefore close with her--!" "Close with her?" he asked as she seemed to hang poised.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Sarah	We've many things to think of at home, and great responsibilities and occupations, and our home's not an impossible place. We've plenty of reasons," [MASK] continued a little piercingly, "for everything we do"--and in short she wouldn't give herself the least little scrap away.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Strether	"I think it will be treating you quite without ceremony if they do; though after all," she added, "it would be difficult to see now quite what degree of ceremony properly meets your case." "Of course," [MASK] conceded, "my attitude toward them is extraordinary."
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Strether	Well, you did me no end of good, and I'm doing my best. I DO make it out a situation." "So do I!" [MASK] went on after a moment. But he had the next minute an inconsequent question.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Strether	"Then why does she want you at home?" "Because when you hate you want to triumph, and if she should get me neatly stuck there she WOULD triumph." [MASK] followed afresh, but looking as he went. "Certainly--in a manner.
<name>Acton</name>	Acton	Strether	Especially sharp in [MASK] meanwhile was the conviction that his companion really knew, as we have hinted, where she had come out. It was at a very particular place--only THAT she would never tell him; it would be above all what he should have to puzzle for himself.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Waymarsh	"Well?" "Well, life can hold nothing better. Besides, they're things of which he's in charge." "So that he does doorkeeper for your precious pair? Can life," [MASK] enquired, "hold nothing better than THAT?"
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sarah	She wondered. "And what do they do after? They can't come straight home." "No, they can't come straight home--at least [MASK] can't. It's their secret, but I think I've guessed it."
<name>Longdon</name>	Longdon	Strether	We escape that with a perfection--! I feel it to be largely, no doubt, because I don't half-understand him; but our modus vivendi isn't spoiled even by that. You must dine with me to meet him," [MASK] went on.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Strether	" she roundly declared. [MASK] resumed for a minute his walk. "She's really perfectly lovely, you know. Far prettier than any girl I've seen over here yet." "That's precisely on what I perhaps most build."
<name>Mrs. Newsome</name>	Mrs. Newsome	Chad	He felt himself colour at the question, and then hated that--hated to pass for anything so idiotic as woundable. Woundable by [MASK]'s lady, in respect to whom he had come out with such a fund of indifference--was he already at that point?
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Chad	"It's fair to your mother." "Oh," said [MASK], "are you afraid of HER?" "Scarcely less. Or perhaps even more. But is this lady against your interests at home?"
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Chad	"Ah then there you are! And what I don't for the life of me make out," [MASK] pursued with resigned perplexity, "is what you GAIN by it." Oh it would have taken his companion too long to say!
<name>Milly</name>	Milly	Chad	[MASK] was to treat it, at any rate, so far as they were again together, as having done so. "I was 'in' when you found me." "Ah but it was you," the young man laughed, "who found ME."
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Chad	WAS he looking preternaturally fit? There was something in it perhaps for [MASK]'s wonderful eye, but he had felt himself for hours rather in pieces. Such a judgement, however, was after all but a contribution to his resolve; it testified unwittingly to his wisdom.
<name>James</name>	James	Waymarsh	Ah that's no equivalent. The equivalent would be [MASK]'s himself serving me up--his remorseless analysis of me. And he'll never do that"--he was sadly clear. "He'll never remorselessly analyse me." He quite held her with the authority of this.
<name>God</name>	God	Chad	"Why I want to come right out and live here myself. And I want to live while I AM here too. I feel with YOU--oh you've been grand, old man, and I've twigged--that it ain't right to worry [MASK].
<name>Mrs. Stringham</name>	Mrs. Stringham	Maria	He protests too much. He asks how one can dream of his being tired. But he has all life before him." [MASK] saw what he meant. "He's formed to please." "And it's our friend who has formed him."
<name>Milly</name>	Milly	Strether	"You mean that after all he shouldn't go back?" "I mean that if he gives her up--!" "Yes?" "Well, he ought to be ashamed of himself." But [MASK] spoke with a sound that might have passed for a laugh.
<name>Miles</name>	Miles	Strether	He stands, as they say, if you succeed with him, to gain--" "Oh a lot of advantages." [MASK] had them clearly at his fingers' ends. "By which you mean of course a lot of money." "Well, not only.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Strether	Is that," [MASK] enquired, "the way he's going to try to get off? These are the people," he explained, "that he must have gone down to see before I arrived. They're the best friends
<name>Milly</name>	Milly	Chad	He perceived soon enough at least that, however reasonable she might be, she wasn't vulgarly confused, and it herewith pressed upon him that their eminent "lie," [MASK]'s and hers, was simply after all such an inevitable tribute to good taste as he couldn't have wished them not to render.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Strether	[MASK] described these vague proceedings to himself, described them even to her, as a happy interlude; the sign of which was that the companions said for the time no further word about the matter they had talked of to satiety.
<name>Maisie</name>	Maisie	Strether	Then as [MASK], silent, seemed even yet to wonder, "Doesn't he know what SHE is?" he went on. "I don't know. I didn't ask him. I couldn't. It was impossible. You wouldn't either.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Chad	"You'd not only be, as I say, a brute; you'd be," his companion went on in the same way, "a criminal of the deepest dye." [MASK] gave a sharper look, as if to gauge a possible suspicion.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Strether	He met you as if you had knocked and he had bidden you enter. [MASK], who hadn't seen him for so long an interval, apprehended him now with a freshness of taste, and had perhaps never done him such ideal justice.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Strether	This element indeed affected [MASK] as charged with audible rumblings, but he was conscious of the care of taking it explicitly as a sign of pleasant peace. He wouldn't appeal too much, for that provoked stiffness; yet he wouldn't be too freely tacit, for that suggested giving up.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Strether	"You'll be secured!" It made [MASK] for a moment give himself again to contemplation. There were faces he scarce knew what to make of. Were they charming or were they only strange? He mightn't talk politics, yet he suspected a Pole or two.
<name>Maisie</name>	Maisie	Strether	[MASK] vaguely took it up. "As 'bad'?" "She began, that is, to care--to care very much. Alone, and in her horrid position, she found it, when once she had started, an interest.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Strether	"Involving accordingly the particular one I've referred to?" [MASK] took another turn about the room, giving a twitch to his companion's blanket and finally gaining the door. His feeling was that of a nurse who had earned personal rest by having made everything straight.
<name>Millicent</name>	Millicent	Waymarsh	"Live up to her?" "You're a great help to her." [MASK] looked at it as at one of the uncomfortable things that were certainly true and that it was yet ironical to say. "It's more then than you are."
<name>Windleham</name>	Windleham	Chad	It was at the beginning of the winter; it went on for some time; it outlasted our absence; it began again on our return; and it luckily seems all right. The young man had met [MASK], and he got a friend to approach him--as having a decent interest in us.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Chad	"You've seen her?" "Oh yes--to say good-bye. And if I had doubted the truth of what I tell you--" "She'd have cleared up your doubt?" [MASK] understood--"rather"--again! It even kept him briefly silent.
<name>Mrs. Stringham</name>	Mrs. Stringham	Strether	She has been perfectly free; and he--our young friend--is really a combination. I quite adore him." [MASK] just made sure. "You mean your future son-in-law?" "Future if we all bring it off."
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Strether	But she came over with ideas. Those she had got at home. They had been her motive and support in joining her brother and his wife. She was to SAVE our friend." "Ah like me, poor thing?" [MASK] also got to his feet.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Strether	Yes--after all I've done to you!" The young man weighed it. "Have you done as much as that?" "Well," said [MASK], thus challenged, "of course I must remember what you've also done to ME.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Strether	A woman--a particular woman--may stand that strain. But can a man?" he propounded. [MASK]'s answer was as prompt as if he had already, for himself, worked it out. "Not without a very high ideal of conduct.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Strether	"But haven't you yourself rather too much?" "Oh RATHER--!" So that after an instant, under this reproach and as if it were at last a fact really to escape from, [MASK] made his move for departure.
<name>Milrose</name>	Milrose	Strether	[MASK] was never to make out exactly what--proved, as it were, too much for him after his comrades had stood for three minutes taking in, while they leaned on an old balustrade that guarded the edge of the Row, a particularly crooked and huddled street-view.
<name>Maisie</name>	Maisie	Strether	You're afraid yourself of being squared. But you're a humbug," he added, "all the same." "Oh!" [MASK] quickly protested. "Yes, you ask me for protection--which makes you very interesting; and then you won't take it.
<name>Mrs. Stringham</name>	Mrs. Stringham	Bilham	[MASK]'s too good. But I think I may say a sufficiency. Yes, a sufficiency. Have you supposed strange things of me?"--and she fixed him again, through all her tortoise-shell, with the droll interest of it. "You ARE all indeed wonderful.
<name>Milly</name>	Milly	Sarah	Each of her movements, in this resolute rupture, reaffirmed, re-enforced that idea. [MASK] passed out of sight in the sunny street while, planted there in the centre of the comparatively grey court, he continued merely to look before him.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Chad	I can't say more, you know; and I don't see how I can do more, in every way, than I've done." [MASK] took this, almost artlessly, as a direct allusion. "You've seen her?" "
<name>Millicent</name>	Millicent	Strether	"Oh," [MASK] had to admit, "I couldn't manage THAT. He's thrown, as usual, on the world; the world which, after all, by his account--for he has prodigious adventures--seems very good to him.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Waymarsh	There seemed moreover a direct connexion between some such inference and a sudden grim dash taken by [MASK] to the opposite side. This movement was startlingly sudden, and his companions at first supposed him to have espied, to be pursuing, the glimpse of an acquaintance.
<name>He</name>	He	Strether	"It has come then at last?" [MASK] paused in the act of pinning his necktie. "Then you know--? You've had one too?" "No, I've had nothing, and I only know what I see. I see that thing
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Strether	"I see," [MASK] mused. "It's too deep." "That's his only fault," she returned--"that everything, with him, is too deep. He has depths of silence--which he breaks only at the longest intervals by a remark.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Maria	"He has given her--as I explained to you that she let me know yesterday--his word of honour to do as I say." [MASK] stared. "But if you say nothing!" Well, he as usual walked about on it.
<name>Longdon</name>	Longdon	Strether	It was quite as if he knew his surreptitious step had been divined, and it was also as if he missed the chance to explain the purity of his motive; but this privation of relief should be precisely his small penance: it was not amiss for [MASK] that he should find himself to that degree uneasy.
<name>Estella</name>	Estella	Waymarsh	Here, with his scrap of paper compressed in his fist and further concealed by his folding his arms tight, he sat for some time in thought, gazed before him so straight that [MASK] appeared and approached him without catching his eye.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Strether	[MASK] hadn't pressed him as to the object of the preference so unexpectedly described; feeling in the presence of it, with one of his irrepressible scruples, a delicacy from which he had in the quest of the quite other article worked himself sufficiently free.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Chadwick	It had been sad, of a sudden, with a sadness that was like a cold breath in his face. "What can I do," he finally asked, "but listen to you as I promised [MASK]?" "
<name>Millicent</name>	Millicent	Strether	And what's to-night for her but a kind of apotheosis? Her frock's really good." "Good enough to go to heaven in? For after a real apotheosis," [MASK] went on, "there's nothing BUT heaven.
<name>Miles</name>	Miles	Chad	He had therefore, further, not at that moment acknowledged the amenity added by this acceptance of his awkwardness to [MASK]'s general patience. Hadn't he none the less known at the very time--known it stupidly and without reaction--that the boy was accepting something?
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Chad	The light refreshment of these vain appearances had not accordingly carried any of them very far. On the other hand it had gained [MASK] time; it had given him a chance, unchecked, to strike his roots, had paved the way for initiations more direct and more deep.
<name>Millicent</name>	Millicent	Strether	"It contrasts--just so; all round, and tremendously." "Therefore, perhaps, most of all with what YOU want?" "Oh," said [MASK], "what I want is a thing I've ceased to measure or even to understand."
<name>Milly</name>	Milly	Jeanne	"YOU would have been a friend." "I?"--it startled him a little. "For the reason you say. You're not stupid." And then abruptly, as if bringing it out were somehow founded on that fact: "We're marrying [MASK]."
<name>Longdon</name>	Longdon	Chad	Made her all the more effectually that she could see you didn't set about it on purpose--I mean set about affecting her as with fear." [MASK] cast a pleasant backward glance over his possibilities of motive.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Strether	Gracious," she added before he could speak, "how intensely you make me see her!" "If you see her," [MASK] dropped, "it's all that's necessary." She really seemed to have her. "I feel that.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Waymarsh	Something straight and simple, something heavy and empty, had been eclipsed in its company; something by which he had best known his friend. [MASK] wouldn't BE his friend, somehow, without the occasional ornament of the sacred rage, and the right to the sacred rage--inestimably precious for
<name>Chadwick</name>	Chadwick	Woollett	Do what he might, in any case, his previous virtue was still there, and it seemed fairly to stare at him out of the windows of shops that were not as the shops of [MASK], fairly to make him want things that he shouldn't know what to do with.
<name>Millicent</name>	Millicent	Strether	"I want it," said [MASK], "to be my last word of all to you. I can't say more, you know; and I don't see how I can do more, in every way, than I've done."
<name>Milly</name>	Milly	Jim	He trusted that a good time was to be, out and out, the programme for all of them; and he assented liberally to [MASK]'s proposal that, disencumbered and irresponsible--his things were in the omnibus with those of the others--they should take a further turn round before going to the hotel.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Strether	"The heroine. I've treated her," said [MASK], "not a bit like a hero. Oh," he sighed, "I don't do it well!" She eased him off. "You do it as you can."
<name>Millicent</name>	Millicent	Strether	[MASK] echoed again with a rueful reflexion. How many nosegays had her present converser sent? "Innocent flowers," she pursued, "as much as he likes. And he sends me splendours; he knows all the best places--he has found them for himself; he's wonderful."
<name>Maurice</name>	Maurice	Chad	The upshot was indeed to make our friend marvel. "Oh if THAT'S all that's the matter with you--!" It was HE who almost showed resentment. [MASK]'s smile of a truth more than met it. "But isn't that enough?"
<name>Longdon</name>	Longdon	Chad	[MASK] looked as if he thought it nice of his old friend to put it so. "Don't you count it as anything that you're dished--if you ARE dished? Are you, my dear man, dished?"
<name>She</name>	She	Waymarsh	"Has anything particular happened," he asked after a minute--"so suddenly to determine her? Has she heard anything unexpected from home?" [MASK], on this, it seemed to him, looked at him harder than ever. "'Unexpected'?"
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Strether	"She sees him as different." "And how does she see him?" [MASK] gave it up. "How can one tell how a deep little girl sees a deep young man?" "Is every one so deep? Is she too?"
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Strether	"She imagined stupidly--so it comes to the same thing." "Stupidly? Oh!" said [MASK]. But she insisted. "She imagined meanly." He had it, however, better. "It couldn't but be ignorantly."
<name>Victor</name>	Victor	Jeanne	"Well, about [MASK] now?" she smiled--it had the gaiety with which she had originally come in. He felt it on the instant to represent her motive and real errand. But he had been schooling her of a truth to say much in proportion to his little.
<name>Wemmick</name>	Wemmick	Waymarsh	"Do you mean a smell? What of?" "A charming scent. But I don't know." [MASK] gave an inferential grunt. "Does he live there with a woman?" "I don't know."
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Chad	He had never been more a man of the world, and it was always in his company present to our friend that one was seeing how in successive connexions a man of the world acquitted himself. [MASK] kept it up beautifully.
<name>Maisie</name>	Maisie	Chad	She enjoys for instance, almost as much as anything else, not being, as I've said, afraid of me; and I think I gave her help in that." [MASK] took a deeper interest. "Was she very very nasty?"
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Strether	"It's just," said [MASK], "what I've come to you to help me to discover. I mean anything about anything over here. I FELT that, up there. It regularly rose before me in its might. The young man moreover--
<name>Milly</name>	Milly	Mamie	"It's [MASK]--so far as I've had it from you--who'll be their great card." And then as his contemplative silence wasn't a denial she significantly added: "I think I'm sorry for her."
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Strether	[MASK] faced the question, and his answer was the more emphatic. "Don't put it off, my dear boy, on ME!" "Well--I see what you mean. I'm sure you'd behave beautifully but you DON'T want to see her.
<name>Longdon</name>	Longdon	Sarah	I doubt meanwhile," he went on, "if [MASK] has at all directly attacked him." His companion brooded. "But won't he wish for his own satisfaction to make his ground good to her?" "No--
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Strether	I don't need protection, so that I was free to 'funk' you--simply to dodge your test. The responsibility was too much for me. I gained time, and when I came back the need of a test had blown over." [MASK] thought of it serenely.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Waymarsh	These all were things congruous with his confession, and his confession was that he HAD--it would come out properly just there if [MASK] would only take it properly--agreed to breakfast out, at twelve literally, the next day.
<name>Maisie</name>	Maisie	Mamie	We shall feel at least that." "Oh," she sighed, "the quantity we seem likely to 'feel'! But what becomes, in these conditions, of the girl?" "Of [MASK]--if we're all provided? Ah for that
<name>Milly</name>	Milly	Chad	[MASK] found it," she continued with her lighted, faintly flushed, her conscious confidential face, "in the quietest way in the world. Or rather it found HIM--for everything finds him; I mean finds him right.
<name>Mrs. Stringham</name>	Mrs. Stringham	Mamie	I shall tell her the matter with her is that she wants only too much to do right. To do right for her, naturally," said [MASK], "is to please." "Her mother, do you mean?" "Her mother first."
<name>Milly</name>	Milly	Maria	[MASK] had a pause; then she spoke as if for conscience. "She wouldn't have done with YOU. She feels she has lost you--yet that she might have been better for you." "Oh she has been quite good enough!"
<name>Maria</name>	Maria	Chad	He went on however well enough, as well as he could do without fresh counsel; he indeed shouldn't stand quite firm, he felt, till he should have re-established his communications with [MASK]. Still, he could always speak for the woman he had so definitely promised to "save."
