<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Alex	We’ll proceed, take the same exit, and switch cars where I showed you. Too bad,” [MASK] said. “I was beginning to like this here van.” “You can buy another with what we’re paying you.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jackson	All were long since soaked through by the rain, and they shivered in the wind. [MASK] brought the boat around to the west. The wind was on the bow now, coming straight down the Severn River valley, as it usually did here.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Shaw	“Anything else about the van?” “I think it made noise, like it had a big V-8. Yeah, it must have been a custom van to have that.” [MASK] looked at his men, too excited to smile as they scribbled their notes.
<name>John</name>	John	Murray	They firebombed his house.” [MASK] shook his head. “It’s amazing. I was just over there two weeks ago. Their morale’s great, especially with the new kids. I don’t know how they do it—well, I do know.
<name>Roland</name>	Roland	Ryan	Again.” [MASK] reloaded with a smile. He’d allowed himself to forget how much fun a pistol could be. This was a pure physical skill, a man’s skill that carried the same sort of satisfaction as a just-right golf shot.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	O’Donnell	The helmsman stood at his post ’midships, his knees bent to absorb the mild buffeting as he piloted the craft through the wind and rain toward the rendezvous. [MASK]’s fleet of trawlers gave him a wide choice of seamen, and this wasn’t the first time he’d used them in an operation.
<name>Hawkeye</name>	Hawkeye	Cath	He might need another operation, and certainly he’d wear glasses for the rest of his life, but that was better than having only one eye. “For somebody who hasn’t done one of these in four months, not bad, [MASK].
<name>Starr</name>	Starr	Murray	The people we have inside some other radical groups—that is, those that still exist—have drawn a big blank. We’re still working on it, and we have a lot of money out on the street, but so far we haven’t got anything to show for it.” [MASK] paused.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Alex	“He’ll probably be moving in next week, certainly by the week after that.” The two men walked out to their cars. [MASK] wrote down the agent’s tag number: he drove his own car, not one belonging to the brokerage.
<name>He</name>	He	Alex	“No, it’s my cousin. He’s in the same business I am,” [MASK] explained. “He’s new to the area. I’ll be responsible for the rent, of course. A three-month deposit, you said?”
<name>passenger</name>	passenger	Jack	“In other words,” the pilot said, “when you tell [MASK] that there’s nothing for him to really worry about, you’re betting on the ‘professional’ conduct of terrorists.” “That’s one way to put it, Commander.
<name>the man</name>	the man	Miller	The man was competent, certainly, even brilliant in his plan for a diversion—but that absurd sentimentality! It was not that [MASK] reveled in the idea of hurting children, but if that was what the revolution took, then it was a necessary price to pay.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Cathy	[MASK] was exploring the left side of his jacket. The tailors had put snap closures on the underside so that it would not so much conceal the cast as make it look dressed. His wife removed the snaps quickly and pulled the coat off. The shirt went next.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Alex	“Right.” [MASK] made note of the former and dismissed the latter. The man was probably a family friend. “The cops—state cops—are back here every two hours minimum. One of them asked me what we were doing yesterday afternoon.
<name>Benghazi</name>	Benghazi	SHAW	“[MASK]." THE RADIO-TELEPHONE circuit crackled with static. “We are under attack. We have officers down,” the wall speaker said. “Unknown number of—it sounds like a fucking war out there! We need help and we need it now.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Ryan	You said the FBI said they weren’t—” “I don’t know—hell, yes, I do know. It’s that Miller bastard, the one at the trial. He wants to kill me.” [MASK] looked down at the floor.
<name>the pilot</name>	the pilot	Robby	So, [MASK] concluded, a spook, or at least a security officer. So that’s what this is all about. The realization came as a blast of cold air. The pilot’s hands flexed as he considered the type of person who would deliberately attempt to murder a woman and her child.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Marty	Who do you think got you that Center for Strategic and International Studies fellowship? The people there liked your work, too. Between what I said and what they said, [MASK] thought you were worth a look last summer, and you worked out better than anyone expected.
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Highland	[MASK] was still angry with the jailer. It was his professionalism that was offended. What the jailer had done was, quite simply, wrong, and potentially the first step on a path that could lead back to the rack and hot pincers.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Powers	“All right.” [MASK] pulled a set of handcuffs from his belt. He and his men took the four men standing bridge watch and secured them to the ship’s wheel and two other fittings. “Captain, if you or your people make any noise at all.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Ryan	How did you get here so fast? Slowly and carefully, [MASK] held the pistol out at arm’s length. He thumbed the clip-release button, and the magazine clattered down to the street. Next he twisted the gun so that the soldier could see it was empty.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Cathy	He would not feel like a whole man again until he was purged of it. One can only weep for so long; it is as though each tear carries a finite amount of emotion away with it. [MASK] stopped first. She used her hand to wipe her husband’s face.
<name>George</name>	George	Jack	“Just the lucky ones, you old fart. ‘All the time we’ve been married’!” [MASK] kissed her again and rose. He walked carefully around the sea of toys toward the tree and returned with a small box wrapped in green Christmas paper.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Bert	“How many times have we all said it?” [MASK] said quietly. “And the pity is, so many of them didn’t listen. Enough of that. This lovely lady doesn’t want to hear the ramblings of tired old men.
<name>Jackal</name>	Jackal	Cantor	This drew a snort. “You say so, son.” “Okay, these two are active, this one as of last week, and this one two days ago.” “What about -20, the Action-Directe camp?” [MASK] asked.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Sean	“A whole bloody year!” “I thought you’d say that. Later, [MASK].” The younger man nodded and took another swig of whiskey. “Where are we going?” “Someplace warmer than this!”
<name>The doctor</name>	The doctor	Platonov	“She will recover fully, your little daughter?” [MASK] asked. “I read about the attack on your family in the newspaper.” “We think so. Except for losing her spleen, there seems to be no permanent damage.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Cecilia	This is my wife, [MASK].” As usually happened, the people immediately split into male and female groups. “I understand you’re a naval aviator.” “Yes, sir. I’m going back to a fleet squadron now.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Cathy	He couldn’t even make that threat work. Oh, well—that’s what you get for loving your wife. [MASK] stroked his face. “What did you shave with this morning, a rusty nail?” “Yeah—I need my razor.
<name>he</name>	he	Miller	It lasted several seconds before he reminded himself that [MASK] was surrounded by four cops, that the jury would find him guilty, that he would be sentenced to prison for the remainder of his natural life, and that prison life would change the person or thing that lived behind those pale gray eyes.
<name>Gordon</name>	Gordon	Mort	“It’s not a very impressive stock.” “How often am I wrong, [MASK]?” “How much do you want?” “At least twenty-K, and if there’s more, I want all of it you can find.”
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Ryan	That’s the one thing I really miss.” “I can send you tapes.” “It’s not the same. Back to teaching history, eh?” “That’s what I do,” [MASK] said.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Breckenridge	“STILL THERE,” THE civilian guard reported when he came back in. “Okay,” [MASK] said, standing. He looked at the pistol holster hanging in the corner, but decided against that. “This is what we’re going to do.”
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Murray	“So you think a ship picked them up.” “It’s the only thing that makes the least bit of sense. Nine merchant vessels were close enough to have been involved. We have the list.” So did [MASK].
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Murray	Good, then you know what I mean.” [MASK] leaned back and stared at the ceiling for a moment. “Call it feeling, or instinct—call it anything you want, it’s bothering me. I want somebody to act on it. . . .
<name>He</name>	He	Jack	Finished, he went back down, and curved around the stairs to the next level down, his library. It was a large one. [MASK] read a lot, and also purchased books he didn’t have time to read, banking against the time when he would.
<name>The protagonist</name>	The protagonist	Miller	If you’d listened to me, you wouldn’t have a man on the inside. I know your background is pretty impressive, but this is my turf, and I know it.” [MASK] knew that he had to accept that. He kept his face impassive.
<name>Butler</name>	Butler	Ryan	Opposite the glass was a massive brick fireplace that reached through the roof. The master bedroom was half a level above the living room, with a window that enabled one to look down into it. [MASK] trotted up the steps. The house design accommodated large closets.
<name>James</name>	James	Miller	[MASK] was the only man he’d ever had captured; and now his perfect record was reestablished. The gunmen were securing their weapons in plastic bags to minimize corrosion damage. A few were talking to each other, but it was impossible to hear them over the howl of wind and outboard motors.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Jack	His head came up when [MASK] entered the room, as if to say, “Yes?” His little girl was lying there, at peace, dreaming a child’s dreams while her father contemplated the nightmare that still hovered over his family, the one he’d allowed himself to forget for a few hours.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jack	The footman grabbed his arm to help. [MASK] didn’t want the help, but this wasn’t a good time to object. “You’ll need a little practice on that,” the Duke observed. “I think you’re right, sir.”
<name>John</name>	John	Ryan	[MASK] had given up on the satellite photographs weeks before. Now he was trying to find patterns within the terrorist network. Which group had connections with which other? Where did their arms come from? Where did they train? Who helped with the training?
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Ryan	“Why didn’t he—quit, run away, something! He saw I had him. He must have known I had him cold.” [MASK] slumped back into the pillow. Having to articulate what had happened brought it back all too vividly.
<name>Chauffeur</name>	Chauffeur	Ryan	As the car stopped, a footman in livery pulled the door open. Getting out was the reverse of getting in. [MASK] turned counterclockwise, stepped out backward, and pulled his arm out behind. The footman grabbed his arm to help.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Ryan	The Sergeant Major fired all five in under three seconds. [MASK] looked in the spotting scope. There were five holes within the target’s X-ring, clustered like the petals on a flower. “Damn, I forgot how much fun a nice Browning could be.”
<name>Sergeant</name>	Sergeant	Gunny	Even the Superintendent of the Academy had to follow them. “Okay, [MASK].” “I think today we’ll try rapid fire.” The Sergeant Major clipped the appropriate target on the rack, and the motorized pulley took it fifty feet downrange.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Cathy	They were too prominent. His wife had always been slender, but this was too much. “I’m gaining the weight back,” [MASK] answered. “You don’t have to worry. Everything’s fine.” “Good.” He kissed her.
<name>Q</name>	Q	Alex	“They’re like us, small but professional. [MASK] is a very thorough technician, but an arrogant one. He hasn’t had a great deal of formal training. He’s clever, very clever. And he’s hungry, as they say over there.
<name>John</name>	John	Miller	[MASK] sat down in an overstuffed chair and ran over the entire operation in his mind. As always, he closed his eyes and visualized every event, then he inserted variables. What if the traffic were unusually heavy or unusually light? What if. . .
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Powers	A few hands moved, too, but before anything that looked like a weapon moved in his direction, a two-foot searchlight blazed down on the boat from seaward. [MASK] was thankful for the light. He saw their heads snap around, then up at him.
<name>he</name>	he	Jack	He took his time. It would have to last until this evening. “I’m up to eleven,” he said as he stepped back. She turned. “Eleven what?” “Counting the ways,” [MASK] laughed. “You turkey!”
<name>Mr. Carson</name>	Mr. Carson	Ryan	The hell I can’t. That’s my job. A few minutes later everyone headed out of the room for dinner. [MASK] found himself in the Blue Drawing Room, a breathtaking pillared hall, and then passed through mirrored double doors into the State Dining Room.
<name>Raymond</name>	Raymond	Cantor	I’ve been standing here for five minutes.” [MASK] grinned. “I like your intensity, but if you want an opinion, you’re pushing a little hard, fella.” “I’ll survive.”
<name>Corporal</name>	Corporal	Ryan	someone called to the right, where the women were. [MASK] followed the Sergeant Major over. Two Marines were down, one with a flesh wound in the arm, but the other had taken a round right through the hip and was screaming like a banshee.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Ashley	“I am getting sick of this place.” “Commander, you should measure your successes against your failures,” [MASK] said. “You’re the best man we’ve had in this office in some years.”
<name>The protagonist</name>	The protagonist	Ryan	The black sedan backed up a few yards and accelerated past him, racing down the street, then turning left up a side street. [MASK] didn’t think to take the number. He was stunned by the flashing sequence of events with which his mind had still not caught up.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Ryan	“Comfortable?” “Well—I’ll have to be careful not to punch a window out with this damned thing.” [MASK] leaned back and shook his head with an eyes-closed smile. “You really are glad to be out of hospital.”
<name>Horatio</name>	Horatio	Jack	“And after viewing the scene myself, I am inclined to agree with them. I’m afraid you’re a hero whether you like it or not.” [MASK] remembered that this man had once been a professional naval officer—probably a good one.
<name>The narrator</name>	The narrator	Ryan	Like a puppet with severed strings, the gunman fell to the pavement without a twitch. [MASK] kept his pistol centered on the man’s chest until he saw what had happened to his head. “Oh, God!” The surge of adrenaline left him as quickly as it had come.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Ryan	You say she’s a doc, so she’s gotta be pretty smart. Hell, maybe she’ll like it. You’d be surprised how many of the gals I teach really get into it.” [MASK] shook his head.
<name>Frank Lloyd Wright</name>	Frank Lloyd Wright	Longley	“Magnificent!” [MASK] observed. “The only thing we did wrong is that the living and dining room aren’t separated, but that’s how the design was drawn, and we couldn’t figure a graceful way to change it.
<name>???</name> (Insufficient information to make a guess)	??? (Insufficient information to make a guess)	Jack	“You’re doing okay, [MASK]. I see you can move your fingers. I was worried about that.” “How come?” “The brachial plexus—it’s a nerve junction inside your shoulder. The bullet missed it by about an inch and a half.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Robby	It’s all part of their game.” [MASK] remembered intelligence reports he’d seen while in the Eastern Med. “Back a couple of years ago—you never heard this from me, okay?” “Off the record,” she said solemnly.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Marty	He remembered that it had been an accident, that [MASK] had made the real connection; but it was also true that he’d done what an analyst was supposed to do, find something odd and bring it to someone’s attention. He could feel good about that.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Avery	“This Ryan fellow’s a decent chap, isn’t he?” “He’s got a real nice kid. You can tell a lot about a man from his kids,” [MASK] thought aloud. They got to the van just as the first sprinkles started.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jackson	To try out my hand at the patriot game.’ Something like that.” [MASK] shook his head in disgust. “War isn’t a game, it’s a profession. They play their little jjames, and call themselves patriots, and go out and kill little kids.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Paul	One-hundred-percent sure. I have a match on the round that killed the trooper. They’re checking the ones from the Porsche now.” “Good work, [MASK]!” “You bet. I’ll be back to you in a little while.”
<name>The professor</name>	The professor	Jack	That ought to be easy enough to check out. I just gave an exam last week. You can ask my students.” [MASK] waved his left hand at the camera again. “The report comes from some highly placed sources,” observed the Post.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Shaw	After all, maybe he could cut a deal, despite what this FBI fellow said. But he had nothing to deal with, as [MASK] had just told him. He waited a few moments for a reaction from the agent and got nothing but a blank stare.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Robby	In another minute they could see the line of gray YPs—Yard Patrol boats— still moored to the concrete seawall while their customary slips were being renovated across the river. [MASK] stood to see better, and brought the boat in between a pair of the wood-hulled training craft.
<name>he</name>	he	Ryan	He was also in his fifties, tall and spare, dressed in surgical greens. There was a stethoscope hanging from his neck, and he seemed to be carrying something that [MASK] couldn’t quite see. He seemed rather tired, but wore a satisfied smile.
<name>He</name>	He	Griffin	“I think we’re ready to give it a try.” “Have they ironed the bugs out?” “Pretty much, enough for a field test, I think.” “Okay.” [MASK] sat back in his chair. “Tell me about it.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jack	There had been blood in the back of the Rolls—not just blood. The driver’s head had been blown apart, and his brains had scattered into the passenger compartment. [MASK] winced thinking about it. The escort had probably leaned over to push the button before defending himself. . . .
<name>Jackie</name>	Jackie	Alex	This amateur black was telling him how to run an op, and the fact that he was right just made it worse. “Hey, man, it’s not just better, it’s easier to do.” [MASK] backed off somewhat. Even arrogant whities needed their pride.
<name>the lineman</name>	the lineman	Louis	“Yeah,” [MASK] noted. Both men were perched at the top of the utility pole, ostensibly stringing new power lines to accommodate the experimental transformer. “You know, the day after the job,” the lineman said, “there was a picture of the lady in the papers.
<name>probably</name> (There is no clear indication of a specific name in this passage, so "probably" is a reasonable guess.)	probably (There is no clear indication of a specific name in this passage, so "probably" is a reasonable guess.)	Jack	“What are you, a philosopher?” “I’m a PK, [MASK]. Preacher’s Kid. You can’t imagine the stuff I used to hear from the parlor when people came over to talk with the old man.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Wilson	Your man [MASK] explained that to me—that was lucky, too. I wasn’t real crazy about taking an AK on with a dinky little handgun. He saw me come around. We both fired about the same time—I just shot straighter, I guess.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Alex	We can even rehearse it for you.” “When?” “This afternoon good enough?” [MASK] smiled. “Indeed. Escape route?” “We’ll show you. We might as well make it a real rehearsal.” “Excellent.”
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Leon	The water in the quarry must be chemically active. This corrosion is pretty fierce.” He looked at [MASK]. “If you catch any fish there, son, you be sure you don’t eat them unless your dad says it’s all right.”
<name>McGarrity</name>	McGarrity	Murray	“Yeah, I’ll buy that, but he kept the numbers very low,” [MASK] said. “The bigger the organization gets, the greater the risk that the Provos will infiltrate—and destroy—him. Hey, they really want his ass on a platter.
<name>Mr. Williams</name>	Mr. Williams	Cooley	“I could get more, but you are one of our better clients,” [MASK] replied. The sigh was audible on the tape. “Very well, it is worth it.” The transaction was made at once. They could hear the rasping sound of new banknotes being counted.
<name>University</name>	University	Roger	Divert to University. We’re full up here.” “[MASK]. University, Trooper-1, do you copy, over.” “Trooper-1, this is University, we copy, and we’re ready for you.”
<name>The suspect</name>	The suspect	Clark	“You better start talkin’, sir. The cops in this town are in a mean mood tonight. What I’m tellin’ you, man, is that we don’t want to put up with some unnecessary shit. You understand me?” [MASK] didn’t understand.
<name>the man</name>	the man	Cantor	Someone identifying himself as a paramedic arrived next. He examined [MASK] quickly, then he and a security guard loaded the man on a wheelchair. They took him out, and the three men left behind stared at each other. “HOW HARD IS it to die from ulcers?”
<name>Betty</name>	Betty	Ashley	Her face was puffy, whether from too much food or too much drink, [MASK] couldn’t say. Her eyes were hidden behind thick glasses. She dressed in a way that fitted the store exactly—everything she had on was old and out of date.
<name>Mark</name>	Mark	Robby	“Can’t you cancel?” “It’s a going-away party. [MASK]—he’s a Navy fighter pilot, we both teach at the Academy—is transferring back to the fleet. Would they mind?”
<name>honey</name>	honey	Jack	“And the shotgun?” “It hasn’t hurt anybody.” “I don’t like it, [MASK]. At least unload it, okay?” She walked off to the bedroom to change. “Okay.” It wasn’t that important.
<name>Dr. Shaw</name>	Dr. Shaw	Ryan	His Highness sat upright in the chair. “I can’t—” “You don’t have to,” [MASK] cut him off. “Did they tell you that what you did definitely—definitely—saved all of you?”
<name>she</name>	she	Jack	“It’s early. My brain isn’t fully functional yet.” “I can tell it doesn’t have enough of a blood supply.” The funny thing, she thought, was that [MASK] didn’t think he was very good-looking.
<name>Inspector</name>	Inspector	Murray	[MASK] was a close friend, and he also knew and respected the Secret Service agents who’d formed the security detail. But the security of Their Highnesses was properly the responsibility of the Yard, and he didn’t like the fact that it was now largely in others’ hands.
<name>George</name>	George	Owens	A few courses in Marxism, a few more in economics, always with a teacher whose leanings were decidedly left of center, [MASK] saw. The police commander snorted to himself. There were enough of those at the London School of Economics, weren’t there?
<name>He</name>	He	Ryan	He had to do this one right the first time. There would be no second. A flash of lightning revealed the two boats a hundred yards to the north. [MASK] couldn’t tell if anyone was there or not. Finally they reached the bottom.
<name>The police officer</name>	The police officer	Atkinson	If your client did what you say, where did he come from?” “Precisely—you don’t know, do you?” [MASK] said sharply. “When I saw your client, sir, he was coming from the direction of the stopped car.”
<name>Therapists</name>	Therapists	Marty	All appear to be male, from the short hair and style of dress. Okay, now the question is, who the hell are they?” “They’re not Action-Directed [MASK] said. “How do you know that?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jack	[MASK] leaned back in his chair for a moment. He smiled to himself, then rose and packed some papers into his briefcase. “Yeah,” he said to himself. “Just to show him that I still know how.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jack	[MASK] asked himself if this constituted trading on inside information. His initial tip might be called that, but his decision to buy was based on confirmation made legally, on the basis of his experi- ence as a stock trader. Okay, it’s legal.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jack	“Settle down, boy,” the pilot suggested. “He has a real talent for pissing me off,” [MASK] said after another deep breath. “I know he’s an asshole, but he almost lost his kid. Try to remember that.
<name>John</name>	John	Miller	“The most we’ve ever done.” “To start when?” “A month beforehand,” [MASK] answered. “Any more time would be a waste of resources. For the moment I have quite a lot of work to do.”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Griffin	“This is really starting to sound good,” [MASK] noted. “But have they really ironed the bugs out yet?” “They say so, except for some occasional voltage fluctuations. They’re not sure what causes that, and they want to do some field tests.”
<name>kid</name>	kid	Marty	You’ve been working too damned late, trying to finish up all your stuff before you leave, right?” “Got—got to.” “What you got to do, [MASK], is get the hell out of here before it eats you up.”
