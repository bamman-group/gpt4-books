<name>Bertie</name>	Bertie	Will	Just then [MASK] gave a low whistle. Coming towards them were two of the peachiest dames they had ever seen. Both had hair the colour of a split- willow basket. They were wearing long garments of a purplish-blue hue, which fell in tiny pleats and rustled as they moved.
<name>Tracy</name>	Tracy	Reenie	“I thought it was only gossip. It sounded far-fetched.” “She’s a gold-digger,” said [MASK].“She only wants to get her hooks into him, then clean him out.” “What’s a gold-digger?
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Winifred	The water was too dark though. You couldn’t see much. Only the occasional clutch of silvery minnows, flitting about like a pickpocket’s fingers. “Still,” said [MASK]. “I wish they wouldn’t. It’s very disagreeable.”
<name>Marilyn</name>	Marilyn	Laura	But why do I think of him as a lad? He must be in his mid-fifties — born, perhaps, in the same year [MASK] died. Has she really been dead that long, the time it’s taken to grow and ripen a lawyer?
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Reenie	The ones in overcoats.” “Even men in overcoats have to take a leak sometimes,” he said. I was taken aback by this vulgarity — it was at odds with his dinnerparty politeness - but perhaps it was a sample of the orphanish jeering [MASK] had predicted.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Winifred	“I hope this isn’t your idea of a joke” said [MASK]. “No. It’s very important. Is it a lawn, a garden, a fountain, or what? Or some sort of squalid alleyway?” Neither of them could tell me.
<name>Matilda</name>	Matilda	Laura	“It’s only paper,” said [MASK], continuing to snip. “Paper isn’t important. It’s the words on them that are important.” “You’ll get in big trouble.” “No, I won’t,” she said.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Laura	It wasn’t that she flouted rules: she simply forgot about them. I was tired of keeping an eye on [MASK], who didn’t appreciate it. I was tired of being held accountable for her lapses, her failures to comply.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Laura	That’s why one of us is always out of sight, whichever way you look at it. When I began this account of [MASK]’s life — of my own life — I had no idea why I was writing it, or who I expected might read it once I’d done.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Laura	He never appreciated being phoned at the office. “There’s been a terrible accident,” I said.“It’s [MASK].The car she was driving went off a bridge.” He said nothing. “It was my car.” He said nothing.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Richard	I’m afraid I expected her to be more stoical than she was. Meanwhile, [MASK] was readying himself for the mantle of command, which was - according to the newspapers — as good as within his grasp. True, I was an impediment, but rumours of a separation had been squashed.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Reenie	We’d been told to keep out of the way, which meant out of earshot as well. When we asked [MASK] what was going on, she looked worried, and said our guess was as good as hers, but she was keeping her ear to the track.
<name>Enoch</name>	Enoch	Benjamin	She appreciated the uses of [MASK]’s wealth, but preferred to gloss over the sources of it. The sons came home for the summer holidays. At boarding school and then at university they’d learned a genial contempt for their father, who couldn’t read Latin, not even badly, as they did.
<name>I</name>	I	Laura	Nothing you’d want to touch. Already my childhood seemed far away — a remote age, faded and bittersweet, like dried flowers. Did I regret its loss, did I want it back? I didn’t think so. [MASK] didn’t stay inside.
<name>Myrtle</name>	Myrtle	Laura	It’s only the book that makes her memorable now. [MASK] came back in a small silver-coloured box, like a cigarette box. I knew what the town had to say about that, as much as if I’d been eavesdropping.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Laura	What did you do to [MASK]? Don’t you ever learn? There is no answer to such questions. The answers are so entangled with the questions, so knotted and many-stranded, that they aren’t really answers at all. I’m on trial here.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Richard	[MASK] had various engagements during the day. I assumed they were with business associates. He hired a car and driver for me, and I was taken out to see what in his view ought to be seen. Most of the things I inspected were buildings, others were parks.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Myra	I set out, but when I was halfway there [MASK] came by in her car and offered me a lift, and I’m ashamed to say I accepted it: I was out of breath, I’d already realized it was too far.
<name>Macario</name>	Macario	Will	They sat down at the foot of the wall, overcome by a profound despair. This joint is peace and plenty, said [MASK]. It’s a soft bed at night and sweet dreams, it’s tulips on the sunny breakfast table, it’s the little woman making coffee.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Laura	God forbid! said the man, in horror. [MASK] had got round him — said she was nineteen. She was a hard worker though, she’d worked like a horse, keeping the joint clean, lending a hand with the waffles when things got real busy.
<name>Estelle</name>	Estelle	Winifred	She had no intention of giving up any managing, herself. Our Waldorf salads came. [MASK] watched me pick up my knife and fork - at least I didn’t eat with my hands, her expression said - and gave a little sigh.
<name>France</name>	France	Avilion	You don’t know what anything costs,” I said. It was like trying to explain arithmetic to a bird. “The factories are closed, [MASK] is falling to pieces, they’re going to sell it; the banks are out for blood.
<name>Olena</name>	Olena	Laura	[MASK] and I picked milkweed pods and opened them, to feel the scale-shaped seeds overlapping like the skin of a dragon. We pulled the seeds out and scattered them on their flossy parachutes, leaving the leathery brownish-yellow tongue, soft as the inside of an elbow.
<name>her</name>	her	Sabrina	If I crossed her mind at all, she doubtless thought of me as being somewhere far away, mercifully out of sight, in the outer darkness to which she had consigned me. I had an overpowering urge then to snatch [MASK] up in my arms and run away with her.
<name>Offred</name>	Offred	Walter	[MASK] and I ascended in the gleaming elevator, with its plastic marble interior and its smell of car upholstery and its crush of suited people, men and women both, all with the averted eyes and vacant faces of lifelong servants. People who see only what they’re paid to see.
<name>Margo</name>	Margo	Winifred	If that sounds brutal, it was. But it wasn’t out of the ordinary. [MASK] had to keep me busy during daylight hours: she didn’t want me loopy with boredom, she didn’t want me going off the deep end.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Alex	As this act was entirely in character for her it wasn’t questioned, only grumbled about.) On the night of his departure we let [MASK] out the back door. He said he owed a lot to us; he said he wouldn’t forget it.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Richard	It was agreed that whatever had happened with [MASK], I must be the wronged party. I’d got the short end of the straw, but as there was no justice and precious little mercy, nothing could be done for me. This was before the book appeared, of course.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Reenie	Just then the bombe glacee made an entrance. We had an electric refrigerator by then - we’d got it just before the Crash - and [MASK], although suspicious of its freezing compartment, had made good use of it for this evening.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Winifred	Where was the romantic prelude, with the young man kneeling at my feet? I felt a wave of dismay travel up from my knees until it reached my face. [MASK] saw it, but did nothing to reassure me. She didn’t want me reassured.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Reenie	With the curved eyelids rolled down over them, her eyes looked even bigger than they did when they were open. Her glasses were sitting on the night table beside the water jug, each round eye of them shining and empty. “She’s asleep,” [MASK] whispered.
<name>Childs</name>	Childs	Betty	[MASK]’s had gone severely downhill. The striped awning was gone, the dark booths looked scratched and tawdry. The smell was no longer of fresh vanilla, but of rancid grease. I was overdressed, I realized. I shouldn’t have worn my white fox neckpiece.
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Reenie	Mothers herded their young children down to the river, to paddle at the gritty little beach there. Off to the side a dusty baseball game had started up; an eddy of spectators watched it groggily. I went to help [MASK] at her bake sale.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Adeha	Or perhaps, down at the factories: Seen any of them bowery hollows around here, anywheres but down the front of her dress? I know their style and I doubt that it’s changed a lot. [MASK] was showing off with her Christmas card, but I believe there was more to it.
<name>Celia</name>	Celia	Laura	[MASK] and I did not have proper dinner dresses. We had dresses, however. They were the usual dark-blue velvet, left over from when we were younger, with the hems let down and a black ribbon sewn over the top of the worn hemline to conceal it.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Liliana	The casualties are (word scratched out) numerous. I never knew before what men are capable of. What must be endured is beyond (word scratched out). I think of all at home every day, and especially you, my dearest [MASK].
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Richard	There was a fireplace in the living room. I used to sit in front of it, with [MASK], the light flickering on us, and on our glasses, each with its coaster to protect the veneer. Six in the evening, martini time.
<name>Harlan</name>	Harlan	Richard	[MASK] said we should be gracious but uninformative. He said there was no point in antagonizing the newspapers unduly, because reporters were vindictive little vermin who would hold a grudge for years and pay you back later, when you were least expecting it. He said he would handle things.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Laura	“Absolutely. With a little effort.” I listened humbly, resentfully. I knew I did not have charm. Neither [MASK] nor I had it. We were too secretive for charm, or else too blunt.
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	Laura	[MASK] was still in town. She would talk to me later. She has, too, though she tends to repeat herself, as the dead have a habit of doing. They say all the things they said to you in life; but they rarely say anything new.
<name>She</name>	She	Darkness	She turned away. The light streaming out from her was so dazzling I had to shut my eyes. I hadn’t heard, I couldn’t see. [MASK] moved closer. Applause battered my ears like beating wings. I staggered and almost fell.
<name>Oyeyemi</name>	Oyeyemi	Laura	[MASK] hated mathematics. Old schoolwork, I thought. No: old homework. Why had she left me these? I could have stopped there. I could have chosen ignorance, but I did what you would have done — what you’ve already done, if you’ve read this far.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Sabrina	She demanded to know if [MASK] had come to me. “I don’t believe I’m obliged to tell you,” I said, to torment her. Fair is fair: most of the chances for tormenting had so far been hers.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Laura	Now it was almost six o’clock and I was trying it on. [MASK] was in my room: she would often do her homework there, or make a show of doing it. “What are you supposed to be?” she said.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Reenie	“At least you had your skirt tucked in.” [MASK] said a girl alone with a man should be able to hold a dime between her knees. She was always afraid that people - men — would see our legs, the part above the knee.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Richard	[MASK] didn’t come with me: he was expecting some important telegrams, he said. He’d had a lot of telegrams already; he would slit the envelopes with a silver paper knife, read the contents, then tear them up or tuck them away in his briefcase, which he kept locked.
<name>Slade</name>	Slade	Boyd	It’s all the loving you ever dreamed of, in every shape and form. It’s everything men think they want when they’re out there, fighting in another dimension of space. It’s what other men have given their lives for. Am I right? You said a mouthful, said [MASK].
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Laura	“We certainly thank you for informing us,” she said with stiff politeness. “A stitch in time saves nine.” This was her way of defending [MASK]’s honour: nothing had happened, yet, that couldn’t be forestalled.
<name>death</name>	death	Richard	I would be discovered here years later by some intrepid team — fallen in my tracks, one arm outflung as if grasping at straws, my features desiccated, my fingers gnawed by wolves. What I was experiencing was dread, but it was not dread of [MASK] as such.
<name>Remember</name>	Remember	Drowned	You’d never dare to. [MASK] now — the tree as well, the sky, the wind, the clouds. All she has left is the picture. Also the story of it. The picture is of happiness, the story not.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Richard	They were fearful of him, a little deferential. I gathered this from the play of the cigarette lighters: who lit what for whom, and how quickly. [MASK] enjoyed their deference. He enjoyed having cigarettes lit for him, and, by extension, for me.
<name>Uluru</name>	Uluru	Laura	At which I would produce my dutiful lists of dead plants. “The rocks are pretty,” I said. “Can’t we just call it a sculpture?” I thought of setting off on my own to see [MASK].
<name>He</name>	He	Winifred	He adored her! He couldn’t bear it when she died!” “I’m glad to hear he felt some remorse,” I said coldly. “I can’t say I noticed any at the time.” [MASK] blamed me, of course.
<name>Offred</name>	Offred	Laura	[MASK] herself is almost out of sight, in this picture. Nothing can be seen of her but the top of her downy head, and one tiny hand, fingers curled around my thumb. Was I angry because I’d been told to hold the baby, or was I in fact defending it?
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Reenie	“Take care of yourself,” said [MASK]. She didn’t kiss me. I wanted to throw my arms around her, and howl and howl. I wanted to be comforted. I wanted it to be me that was going with her.
<name>He</name>	He	Myra	I get up to pee, go back to bed, he twisting in the damp sheets, listening to the monotonous whirring of the fan. [MASK] says I should get air conditioning, but I don’t want it. Also I can’t afford it.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Reenie	“[MASK] sings that. I think it’s stupid.” “How do you mean?” I said. “Look.” She wrote it out as an equation. No place = home. Therefore, home — no place. Therefore home does not exist.
<name>Matilda</name>	Matilda	Laura	She couldn’t have got rid of this hand without making a wobbly margin. She hadn’t coloured this picture at all, except for her own cut-offhand. This had been tinted a very pale yellow. “For goodness’ sake, [MASK]!”
<name>She</name>	She	Richard	I occupied my time, I’d learned how to do that. I had taken up gardening in earnest now, I was getting some results. Not everything died. I had plans for a perennial shade garden. [MASK] kept up appearances.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Myra	[MASK], by default. While I’m here I might as well just pop in a load, she’ll say. Then we both pretend she hasn’t done it. We conspire in the fiction - or what is rapidly becoming the fiction — that I can fend for myself.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Winifred	“I suppose when he married me he figured he’d got a bargain — two for the price of one. He picked us up for a song.” “Don’t be ridiculous,” said [MASK], though she looked shaken.
<name>Titus</name>	Titus	Alex	“I used to think that,” said [MASK]. “But then it came to me that who I really am is a person who doesn’t need to know who he really is, in the usual sense. What does it mean, anyway - family background and so forth?
<name>Winsome</name>	Winsome	Myra	History, as I recall, was never this winsome, and especially not this clean, but the real thing would never sell: most people prefer a past in which nothing smells. [MASK] likes to make presents to me from her stash of treasures.
<name>Idgie</name>	Idgie	Betty	[MASK]’s had new owners, she said; the old owners wouldn’t have liked her sitting out front like a paying customer, even if she was paying, but the new ones had figured out that they needed all the paying customers they could get.
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Winifred	From what’s right there on the table, which that morning was a bud vase with a paper-white narcissus in it, picked from the bowl of forced bulbs sent over by [MASK]. So lovely to have at this time of year, she’d said.
<name>Phyllis</name>	Phyllis	Reenie	“I’m going to live by myself in the garage.” “I’m not going to have one either,” I said, not to be outdone. “Fat chance of that,” said [MASK]. “You like your nice soft bed.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Winifred	“What are you telling me? What did she do?” [MASK] had on her pitying look. “She threatened to harm herself. She also said some things that were — well, she’s clearly suffering from delusions.” “What did she say?”
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Winifred	Most likely she hardly knew what she was doing or saying. Once we got her back, she must be given a strong sedative and carted off to the doctor. But the most important thing, said [MASK], was that not a word of all this must leak out.
<name>Baptist</name>	Baptist	Anglican	Here the young peoples’ church group would hold its skating parties, which were not called parties but outings. My mother was a Methodist, but my father was [MASK]: thus my mother was below my father’s level socially, as such things were accounted then.
<name>Atwood</name>	Atwood	Richard	Around behind the monument there’s some empty space. I think of it as a reserved seat — permanently reserved, as [MASK] used to arrange at the Royal Alexandra Theatre. That’s my spot; that’s where I’ll go to earth.
<name>Ursula</name>	Ursula	Winifred	I have the right! [MASK] and her crew laugh and point. You? You were banished long ago! Have you looked in a mirror lately? You’ve let yourself go, you look a hundred and two. Go back to your dingy old cave!
<name>She</name>	She	Laura	How did [MASK] do it? Not by opposing him, not any longer: by this time she avoided clashing with him head-on. She did it by stepping back, and turning away, and throwing him off balance.
<name>Emmeline</name>	Emmeline	Reenie	But in the end she decided to give it a try, and so she took ahold of life, and got some better. [MASK] believed that people decided when it was their time to die; similarly, they had a voice in whether or not they would be born.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Richard	He was too prominent for things to be otherwise. He would wish to have a statement of grief prepared. I made the phone call. [MASK]’s latest young secretary answered. I told her the matter was urgent, and that no, it could not be communicated through her.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Laura	“Who with?” “With — you know,” I couldn’t say it. “Oh no,” said [MASK], “not at all. It was horrible, but I had to do it. I had to make the sacrifice.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Richard	I’d drive down, I thought, and then remembered that my car was now scrap. I would have to call a taxi. Also I ought to warn [MASK], at his office: As soon as the word got out, the corpse flies would besiege him.
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	Laura	Time has been at them with its sharp invisible teeth. Someone had cleared away last autumn’s soggy leaves from [MASK]’s grave. There was a small bunch of white narcissi, already wilted, the stems wrapped in aluminum foil. I scooped it up and chucked it into the nearest bin.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Laura	I thought we’d put paid to the nuns. “And what did they say?” I asked, in a kindly, disinterested manner. “It was no good,” said [MASK]. “They were very nice to me, but they said no.
<name>She</name>	She	Richard	[MASK] would have two boiled eggs, two thick rashers of bacon and a grilled tomato, with toast and marmalade, the toast brittle, cooled in a toast rack. I would have half a grapefruit. The tea would be dark, tannic, hke swamp water.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Reenie	The table (plain, cramped, with an oilcloth covering printed in yellow tulips) was like a great chasm — on one side of it the two of us, on the other, immensely far away now, [MASK] and her baby, with no regrets.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Aimee	You can see what a clever woman she was. [MASK] was born in early April. In those days they used ether, and so I was not conscious during the birth. I breathed in and blacked out, and woke up to find myself weaker and flatter.
<name>Laura</name>	Laura	Laura	It was time for me to be taken in hand. [MASK] came in for some of this hectoring too, although she had not yet reached the age for it. (What was the age for it? The pubescent age, it’s clear to me now.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Richard	“What do you want, exactly?” she said. “Not that [MASK] did anything at all. But he doesn’t want an uproar.” “I told him, exactly,” I said. “I spelled it out.
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Reenie	[MASK] said it was a good thing we had at least half a wit between the two of us, but what had we been doing down there in the first place? And in the mist, at that. She said I should have known better.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Reenie	Everyone in town came to the funeral, said [MASK]. Well, almost everyone, because there was considerable bitterness in some quarters; but still, he’d been well respected, and by that time they’d known it wasn’t him shut down the factories for good like that.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Laura	How much did you have to pay them, to get it published? I can’t believe [MASK] wrote that filthy - that piece of garbage!” “You don’t want to believe it,” I said, “because you were besotted with her.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Pearl	Ladies’ Auxiliaries put on bake sales in aid of this or that, offering pies and cookies and cakes, and jars of jam and chutney and pickles, each with a first-name label: Rhoda’s Chow-chow, [MASK]’s Plum Compote.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Reenie	“We’ll be quiet,” I said. I didn’t want to go outside — it looked too bright, too glaring, and my eyelids felt swollen and pink — but [MASK] said we had to, and anyway the fresh air would do us good.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Richard	He lived in a cheerless flat, he said; he said he was practically a monk. “What is life without a wife?” he said, smiling. It sounded like a quotation. I think it was one. [MASK] proposed to me in the Imperial Room of the Royal York Hotel.
<name>Moira</name>	Moira	Myra	I dropped the laundry on the cellar stairs, abandoning it. Perhaps I might go back and pick it up later, perhaps not. Someone would. [MASK] would, lips tightening. Now I’d done it, now I would have the woman foisted on me for sure.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Richard	“I wish they wouldn’t. It’s very disagreeable.” “We could use a good war,” said [MASK]. “Maybe it will pep things up — put paid to the Depression. I know a few fellows who are counting on it.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Walter	As soon as he’d got me into the car and buckled me up, [MASK] turned on the radio: electric violins wading, twisted romance, the foursquare beat of heartbreak. Trite suffering, but suffering nonetheless. The entertainment business. What voyeurs we have all become.
<name>Mathilde</name>	Mathilde	Reenie	She died of a fever; also of being weak, because she could not manage to get her strength back, said [MASK]. During this time the doctor came and went, and a succession of crisp, brittle nurses occupied the easy chair in the bedroom.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Richard	There might be reporters. I would have to call a taxi. Also I ought to warn [MASK], at his office: he would wish to have a statement of grief prepared. I went into my dressing room: I would need black, and a handkerchief.
<name>Moira</name>	Moira	Myra	Candle stubs have been found, and burned spoons, and the odd throwaway needle. I hear all this from [MASK], who thinks it’s a disgrace. She knows what the candle stubs and spoons are for: they are drug paraphernalia. Vice is everywhere, it seems.
<name>Rosemary</name>	Rosemary	Reenie	If the word had been said in my presence, which it was not, I would have had no idea what it meant. Not even [MASK] had mentioned it: dark hints about kitchen-table butchers was about as far as she had gone, and
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Reenie	One of [MASK]’s many brothers had something to do with cheap magazines, the pulpy, trashy kind you could buy in drugstores, and the worse ones you could get only under the counter. What was his job?
<name>Marilyn</name>	Marilyn	Laura	If naked, seen gracefully reclining through a gauzy mist, which is where movie stars come in: they assume such poses for us. They are our younger selves as they recede from us, glow, turn mythical. As a child, [MASK] would say: In Heaven, what age will I be?
<name>Phyllis</name>	Phyllis	Laura	“You screamed and screamed,” I said now. “You didn’t understand he was just pretending.” “It was worse than that,” said [MASK]. “I thought he was pretending the rest of the time.” “What do you mean?”
<name>Trudy</name>	Trudy	Laura	She said, What you don’t know won’t hurt you. A dubious maxim: sometimes what you don’t know can hurt you very much. In the nighttimes [MASK] would creep into my room and shake me awake, then climb into bed with me.
