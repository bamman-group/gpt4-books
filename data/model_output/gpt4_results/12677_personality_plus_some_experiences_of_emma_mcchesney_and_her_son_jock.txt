<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jock	She could make you see the romance in condensers and transformers. She had the power that caused the reader to lose himself in the charm of magnetic poles, and ball bearings, and high-tension sparks. "Just dropped in to say good-by," said [MASK], very casually.
<name>John</name>	John	Buck	Her breast swelled exultingly. Her head came up. This was her handiwork. She looked at it, and found that it was good. "Let's strike for the afternoon and call it a holiday," suggested [MASK].
<name>Eve</name>	Eve	Eve	That was an ideal campaign because it didn't urge and insist that the public buy Featherlooms. It just eased the idea to them. It started by sketching a history of the petticoat, beginning with [MASK]'s fig leaf and working up.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Jock	"Yes. The head of that concern is a woman. That's one reason why they didn't send me, I suppose. I--I'd like to say something, if you don't mind." "Anything you like," said [MASK] graciously.
<name>He</name>	He	Buck	There ought to be a special prayer for women who are bringing up their sons alone." [MASK] stirred a little uneasily. "I've never heard you talk like this before." "You probably never will again." She swung round to her desk.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Mahogany	Hers were pale. He was breathing quickly. She was very quiet. His eyes glowed. So did hers, but the glow was dimmed by a mist. "[MASK]'s richer, but make it oak, son. It doesn't show finger-marks so.
<name>Hamilton</name>	Hamilton	Jock	Do you realize that there are men in this office who have been here for five years, six years, or even more, and who have never been given a chance to do anything but stenography, or perhaps some private secretarying?" "I know it," agreed [MASK].
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Jock	" "I'll--wait," said [MASK]. And seated in one of the great thronelike chairs, he waited. He sat there, slim and boyish, while the laughing, chattering crowd swept all about him.
<name>Mammy</name>	Mammy	Annie	[MASK]," she teased, "just give us one of your peach cobblers, will you? You see he--he's going to be awfully--tired when he gets home." So they went stepping off to work together, mother and son.
<name>Buckland</name>	Buckland	Buck	At five o'clock she was still working. At five-thirty T.A. [MASK] came in to find her still surrounded by papers, samples, models. "What is this?" he demanded wrathfully, "an all-night session?"
<name>Orville</name>	Orville	Hupp	T.A. will be back next week. Could your office have an advertising plan roughly sketched by that time?" "Could they!" His tone was exultant. "Watch 'em! [MASK]'s been crazy to make Featherlooms famous." "But look here, son.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jock	The next thing you know you'll be addressing the Y.M.C.A. advertising classes on The Young Man in Business." [MASK] laughed a rueful little laugh. "I didn't mean to make a speech. I was just trying to say that I've served my apprenticeship.
<name>Jimmy</name>	Jimmy	Jock	He's gabby enough for two. Try a line of talk that is filled with the fire and enthusiasm of youth, combined with the good judgment and experience of middle age, and you've--" "Say, look here," stammered [MASK]. "
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jock	"Me? Now? This stuff you mean--?" "No; I mean in the last year. Are they piling it up on you?" [MASK] laughed a laugh that was nothing less than a failure, so little of real mirth did it contain.
<name>Thornhill</name>	Thornhill	Jock	Everything about the chief was deliberate, sure, unhurried. He finished the work in hand as though no other person stood there waiting his pleasure. When at last he raised his massive head he turned his penetrating pale blue eyes full on [MASK].
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jock	[MASK] looked up. "Or if you don't want the Berg, Shriner crowd to get wise, I'll fix it this way. I'll go over there this morning and tell 'em I've changed my mind, see? The campaign's theirs, see?
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Jock	"I wrote you three days ago; you probably will remember. You replied, asking me to call, and I--" "Minute," exploded the man at the desk, still absorbed. [MASK] faltered, stopped. The man at the desk did not look up.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jock	Don't I know how narrowly [MASK] escaped being the wrong kind! I'm his mother, but I'm not quite blind. I know he had the making of a first-class cad. I've seen him start off in the wrong direction a hundred times."
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Jock	She turned around to face [MASK]. "Sixty-nine!" Her voice bristled with indignation. "Now what do you think of that!" "I think you'd better make it an even seventy, whatever it is you're counting up, and come on out to luncheon.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Jock	"[MASK], these medium-weights of yours didn't wear at all, and you paid five dollars for them." "Medium-weights! What in--" "You've enough silk socks to last you the rest of your natural life. Handkerchiefs, too.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jock	"I--sort of--began to think, and I couldn't sleep." "What were you thinking of?" [MASK] looked down at the bedclothes and traced a pattern with one forefinger on the sheet. Then he looked up. "Thinking of you."
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Jock	Perhaps by this time next week he might have a spoon in the stirring too-- There came the murmur of voices as a door was opened. The voices came nearer. Then quick footsteps. [MASK] recognized them. He rose, smiling.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Jock	[MASK] found himself in the big, busy, light-flooded central office. Down either side of the great room ran a row of tiny private offices, each partitioned off, each outfitted with desk, and chairs, and a big, bright window.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jock	At the Twenty-third Street station [MASK] left her. "You'll have dinner to-night with a full-fledged professional gent," he bragged, in his youth and exuberance and was off down the aisle and out on the platform.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Jock	"Why, that's not a bad idea--that last. I'll use that. I'll--" [Illustration: "With a jolt [MASK] realized she had forgotten all about him"] She began to scribble rapidly on the sheet of paper before her.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Jock	"What's all this?" [MASK] tipped back his chair and surveyed the clutter before him. "That," said he, "is what is known on the stage as 'the papers.' And it's the real plot of this piece."
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Jock	Sit down, sit down." There was a certain abrupt geniality about him. His tortoise-rimmed glasses gave him an oddly owlish look, like a small boy taking liberties with grandfather's spectacles. [MASK] found himself sitting down, his anger slipping from him.
<name>He</name>	He	Jock	Pictures, posters, photographs hung all about. Some of the pictures [MASK] recognized as old friends that had gazed familiarly at him from subway trains and street cars and theater programmes. Golf clubs, tennis rackets, walking sticks, billiard cues were stacked up in corners.
<name>McClintock</name>	McClintock	Berg	What else?' "'I've learned that one negative argument is worth six positive ones; that it never pays to knock your competitor; that it's wise to fight shy of that joker known as "editorial co√∂peration."' "'That so?' said [MASK]. '
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Emma	That's a woman with a son." She laughed a little shamefacedly. "I'm talking like the chorus of a minor-wail sob song, but it's the truth." "If you feel like that, [MASK], tell him to stay.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Hupp	"Yep," agreed [MASK]. "Start out with a feature skirt. Might illustrate with one of those freak drawings they're crazy about now--slinky figure, you know, hollow-chested, one foot trailing, and all that.
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Illustration	"Well, you said you wanted somebody to worry about, didn't you?" [[MASK]: "'Well, you said you wanted somebody to worry about, didn't you?'"] A little whimsical smile lay lightly on his lips.
<name>George</name>	George	Snyder	[MASK] excused himself, and talked to him for--oh, half an hour, perhaps. But that was all. He was back again in no time. After that it looked like plain sailing. We got along wonderfully.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Annie	I'd like to know if you really are the advertising wizard that you think you are." So it was that long after [MASK]'s dinner dishes had ceased to clatter in the kitchen; long after she had put her head in at the door to ask, "Aigs 'r cakes for breakfast?"
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	McChesney	But it's what you pick up on the side, by your own efforts and out of your own experience, that lifts you out of the scrub class. Now I don't think you're an ideal advertising man by any means, [MASK].
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Jock	[MASK] had never been privileged to attend one of these meetings. Perhaps by this time next week he might have a spoon in the stirring too-- There came the murmur of voices as a door was opened. The voices came nearer. Then quick footsteps.
<name>Jimmy</name>	Jimmy	Jock	Good day, gents." He stalked to the door. There he turned dramatically and leveled a forefinger at [MASK]. "They've got you roped and tied. But I think you're a comer. If you change your mind, kid, come and see me."
<name>Thurstan</name>	Thurstan	Jock	If you blush and stammer a little, she'll like it. Play up the coy stuff." "The coy stuff!" echoed [MASK]. "I hadn't thought much about my attitude toward the--er--the lady,"--a little stiffly. "
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Jock	Would you like your office done in mahogany or oak?'" [MASK] came to a full stop before his mother. His cheeks were scarlet. Hers were pale. He was breathing quickly. She was very quiet. His eyes glowed.
<name>Jimmy</name>	Jimmy	Jock	[MASK] sat up very straight and clasped his hands about his knees. "I got to thinking of what I had said about having made good all alone. That's rot. It isn't so. I was striped with yellow like a stick of lemon candy.
<name>Starr</name>	Starr	Jock	I don't intend to stand here and dispute about your ethical innards at this hour. I'm going to kiss you again." "Oh, well, if you must," grinned [MASK] resignedly, and folded her in a bear-hug.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Jock	"Just going out to lunch,"--she turned like a race horse trembling to be off,--"putting on his overcoat in the front office. Shall I--" "Catch him." "Listen here," began [MASK] uncomfortably; "if you're going to call him perhaps I'd better vanish."
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jock	A vivid face, full of pride, and hope, and encouragement flashed before him. "[MASK]," it said, "don't let 'em buffalo you. They'll try it. If they give you a broom and tell you to sweep down the back stairs--"
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jock	That kind of talk won't elect you to the University Club, son." So they talked, all through supper and during the evening. Rather, [MASK] talked and his mother listened, interrupting with only an occasional remark when the bubble of the boy's elation seemed to grow too great.
<name>John</name>	John	Jock	Her lips were parted slightly. She sat very quietly, her eyes never leaving the face that frowned so intently over the littered table. The room had been very quiet before--[MASK] busy with his work, his mother interested in her magazine. But this silence was different.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Jock	Now he looked briefly and coolly at [MASK]. "Where did you get him?" he asked, with the precise enunciation of the foreign-born. "Good figure. And he wears his clothes not like a cab driver, as the others do."
<name>Flora</name>	Flora	Annie	And then, being a modern mother, she donned smart autumn hat and tailored suit coat and stood ready to reach her office by nine-thirty. But because she was as motherly as she was modern she swung open the door between kitchen and dining-room to advise with [MASK], the adept.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jock	It's the same queer strain that causes a mother to lavish the most love on the weakest, wilfullest child. Perhaps I wouldn't have loved [MASK] so much if there hadn't been that streak of yellow in him, and if I hadn't had to work so hard to dilute it until now
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Jock	" [MASK] had to say it twice before she heard. "What? Oh, no--I think not." The waiter hesitated, coughed discreetly, lifted his eyebrows insinuatingly. "The French pastry's particularly nice to-day, madam.
<name>John</name>	John	Jock	Every ambitious man or woman in business wears it at one time or another. Sooner or later, [MASK], you'll have your chance at the money end of this game. If you don't care about the thing you call ethics, it'll be sooner.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Jock	After the almost incessant rush of conversation quiet settled down strangely on the two seated there in the living-room with its soft-shaded lamps. [MASK] picked up a magazine, twirled its pages, put it down, strolled into his own room, and back again.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	But to hand my Featherlooms over to a lot of cold-blooded experts who--well--" she paused, biting her lip. "We'll see, [MASK]; we'll see." They did see. The Featherloom petticoat campaign was launched with a great splash.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jock	[Illustration: "She laid one hand very lightly on his arm and looked up into the sullen, angry young face"] "I've seen older men than you are, [MASK], and better men, and bigger men, wearing that same look, and for the same reason.
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Jock	I am now engaged in the pleasing task of putting the bones in a herringbone suit." But [MASK] did not smile. Here was another man, he thought, who had been given a broom and told to sweep down the stairway.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Jock	"Medium-weights! What in--" "You've enough silk socks to last you the rest of your natural life. Handkerchiefs, too. But you'll need pajamas." [MASK] stooped, gathered up an armful of miscellaneous undergarments and tossed them into an open drawer.
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	McChesney	"My name's [MASK]," he began. "I wrote you three days ago; you probably will remember. You replied, asking me to call, and I--" "Minute," exploded the man at the desk, still absorbed.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	McChesney	That time my suit case went astray--' "'M-m-m-m, yes.' He drummed his fingers on the table top a couple of times. Then--[MASK], what have you learned about advertising in the last two and a half years?'
<name>Vanessa</name>	Vanessa	Luncheon!"--she	"I think you'd better make it an even seventy, whatever it is you're counting up, and come on out to luncheon. I've an appointment at two-fifteen, you know." "[MASK] waved the paper in the air--"with this outrage on my mind!
<name>Myra</name>	Myra	Lordy	In an instant he was all contrition and tenderness. "You're tired. I've talked you to death, haven't I? [MASK], it's midnight! And I want to get down early to-morrow.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jock	"No," and all the humor had fled, "I--[MASK], I've never said much to you about your father. But I think you know that he was what he was to the day of his death.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Jock	[MASK], who at the beginning was so puffed with pride that his gold fountain pen threatened to burst the confines of his very modishly tight vest, lost two degrees of pompousness a day, and his attitude toward his unreproachful mother was almost humble.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Jock	[MASK] had been staring, fascinated, at the shaded, zigzag marks which the artist--dark-skinned, velvet-eyed, foreign-looking youth--was making on the sheet of paper before him. He had scarcely glanced up during the entire scene.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jock	It grew very dark in the little room, then altogether dark. Then an impudent square of yellow from a light turned on in the apartment next door flung itself on the bedroom floor. [MASK] stared at it moodily. A key turned in the lock.
<name>Don</name>	Don	Jock	"[MASK], you win. I--I suppose I have fallen out of step. Perhaps I've been too busy watching my own feet. T.A. will be back next week. Could your office have an advertising plan roughly sketched by that time?"
<name>Raffles</name>	Raffles	Hupp	If I could lay my hands on a chap who could wear clothes as if they belonged to him--" [MASK] rose. "Here's your man," he cried, with a snap of his fingers. "Clothes! Look at him. He invented 'em.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Jock	She tossed it back over his arm. "I'll wear the black and white," said [MASK] resignedly, and turned toward his own room. At his doorway he paused and raised his voice slightly: "For that matter, they're looking for young men.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Jock	Through a doorway beyond [MASK] could see others similarly engaged in the next room. On a platform in one corner of the room posed a young man in one of those costumes the coat of which is a mongrel mixture of cutaway and sack.
<name>Jurgis</name>	Jurgis	Jock	but I'd like to know where you think you've been wronged in this." "Right here!" replied [MASK], and he slapped his pocket, "and here," he pointed to his head. "
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jock	But before he could flick on his own light his mother stood in the doorway, a tall, straight, buoyant figure. "I got your wire and--Why, dear! In the dark! What--" "Must have fallen asleep, I guess," muttered [MASK].
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jock	[MASK] was at ease immediately. "Quite a lot; yes. I practically rewrote the Gridiron play that we gave last year, and I was assistant advertising manager of the college publications for two years. That gives a fellow a pretty broad knowledge of advertising."
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jock	"It does sound tempting." She glanced at [MASK]. "And we're wearing our gowns so floppy this year that it makes no difference whether one's fat or not." She turned to the waiter. "I never can tell till I see them.
<name>Mac</name>	Mac	Hayes	Well, he can pass everything on the road. Don't forget that." He turned to his desk again and reached for a stack of papers and cuts. "Good luck to you. If you want any further details you can get 'em from [MASK].
<name>Archer</name>	Archer	Berg	I told him that I'd learned to stand so that the light wouldn't shine in my client's eyes when I was talking to him. I lost a big order once because the glare from the window irritated the man I was talking to. I told [MASK] all the tricks I'd
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jock	"Because I'm an idiot," blurted [MASK]. "Because I'm a double-barreled, corn-fed, hand-picked chump and--" "That's one reason," drawled the Old Man grimly. "But it's not the chief one.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Annie	Only get into it in a jiffy, Son, because breakfast will be ready in ten minutes. I can tell by the way [MASK]'s crashing the cups. So step lively if you want to pay your lovely mother's subway fare."
<name>Horace</name>	Horace	McChesney	The client he's trying to convince is so taken with him that he actually forgets the business he represents. We say of a man like that that he is personality plus. Personality is like electricity, [MASK]. It's got to be tamed to be useful."
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	Hopper	They're wearing skirts with a drawstring in the back, and a label in the band, guaranteed to last one year. Those are the people I'd like to reach, and hold." "Hm!" said [MASK], from his corner, cryptically.
<name>Old Man</name>	Old Man	Griebler	"This [MASK]'s looking for an advertising manager. He's as pig-headed as a--a--well, as a pig, I suppose. But it's a corking chance, youngster, and the Old Man's just recommended you--strong.
<name>Mrs. Hudson</name>	Mrs. Hudson	Annie	But when he let himself into the flat at five-thirty the place was very quiet, except for [MASK], humming in a sort of nasal singsong of content in the kitchen. He flicked on the light in the living-room. A new magazine had come.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	McChesney	"My name's [MASK]," he began. "I'm here because I want to work for this concern." He braced himself to present the convincing, reason-why arguments with which he had prepared himself.
<name>Psmith</name>	Psmith	Jock	An answering grin overspread the fat features of the usher. Even an usher likes his little joke. The sense of humor dies hard. "I have a letter from him, asking me to call," said [MASK], to clinch it. "This way.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Jock	They followed him to his train, all laughter and animation. "If this train doesn't go in two minutes," said [MASK], "I'll get scared and chuck the whole business. Funny, but I'm not so keen on going as I was three weeks ago."
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Then--"Well	[MASK], really, T.A., don't mind me. What you find so exquisitely funny--" "That's the funniest part of it! That you, of all people, shouldn't see the joke. Not exactly bad!" He wiped his eyes.
<name>Archer</name>	Archer	Jock	There advanced toward [MASK] a large, plump, dignified personage, a personage courteous, yet reserved, inquiring, yet not offensively curious--a very Machiavelli of reception-room ushers. Even while his lips questioned, his eyes appraised clothes, character, conduct.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Hupp	He cradled his head in his hands, tilted the chair, pursed his mouth over the slender white cylinder and squinted his eyes up toward the lazy blue spirals of smoke--the very picture of content and satisfaction. [MASK] was in attending some conference in the Old Man's office, of course.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jock	His mother's color heightened. Her blue eyes glowed dark. "Look here, [MASK]! Will you kindly stop this lean-on-me-grandma stuff! To hear you talk one would think I was ready for a wheel chair and gray woolen bedroom slippers.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Jock	Frowning, [MASK] sank into the empty desk chair. He cradled his head in his hands, tilted the chair, pursed his mouth over the slender white cylinder and squinted his eyes up toward the lazy blue spirals of smoke--the very picture of content and satisfaction.
<name>absolutely</name>	absolutely	Lord	Quite a lot; yes. I practically rewrote the Gridiron play that we gave last year, and I was assistant advertising manager of the college publications for two years. That gives a fellow a pretty broad knowledge of advertising." "Oh, [MASK]!"
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jock	It rests with you, but it's bound to come, because you've got the stuff in you." "Maybe," replied [MASK] the cynical. But his face lost some of its sullenness as he looked down at that earnest, vivid countenance up-turned to his.
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Jock	[MASK] had cleared the center table and was opening his flat bundle of papers. He drew up two chairs. "Let's not waste any time," he said. "I've had a twelve-hour wait for this." He seemed to control the situation.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Jock	"What's the hurry? I want to tell you about--" "Better tell him." "Oh, all right," said [MASK] stiffly. If that was the way they treated a fellow who had turned his first real trick, why, very well.
<name>Orpheus</name>	Orpheus	Jock	They want something special. Two figures, young man and woman. Said expressly they didn't want a chicken. No romping curls and none of that eyes and lips fool-girl stuff. This chap's ideal for the man." He pointed to [MASK].
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Jock	[MASK] stared. "Just that. Personality's one of the biggest factors in business to-day. But there are some men who are so likable that it actually counts against them. The client he's trying to convince is so taken with him that he actually forgets the business he represents.
<name>Annabel</name>	Annabel	Jock	She withheld that word. He must fight his fight alone. "I want to write the kind of ad," [MASK] was saying excitedly, "that you see 'em staring at in the subways, and street cars and L-trains.
<name>Reggie</name>	Reggie	Jock	If it's what you think it is he'll see it quicker than any other human being, and he'll probably fall on your neck and invest you in royal robes and give you a mahogany desk all your own." "Oh, what's the good!" retorted [MASK] disgustedly.
<name>Eustace</name>	Eustace	Hupp	"Yes," snapped [MASK] shortly. Then, in a new tone, "Look here, son. If he says--" He stopped, and turned back to his work again. "If he says what?" "Nothing. Better run along."
<name>Jimmy</name>	Jimmy	Jock	"Lines!" [MASK] swung to face a mirror. "Good! I'm so infernally young-looking that no one takes me seriously. It's darned hard trying to convince people you're a captain of finance when you look like an errand boy."
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Berg	" "You've got it," agreed [MASK]. "But you must think it all the time. Every minute. It's got to be working away in the back of your head. You know it isn't always the biggest noise that gets the biggest result.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Jock	And never did she talk or think business. To-day she ate her luncheon with a forced appetite, glanced about with a listlessness far removed from her usual alert interest, and followed [MASK]'s attempts at conversation with a polite effort that was more insulting than downright inattention.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Jock	Ten years ago the girls used to have to tie their hands or wear mittens to keep from running their white fingers through my waving silken locks. Sit down a minute." [MASK] reached forward and took up a jar of cream. He frowned in thought.
