<name>Jackson's</name>	Jackson's	Jackson	I was away below the ferry now. I rose up, and there was [MASK]'s Island, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy timbered and standing up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like a steamboat without any lights.
<name>Pap</name>	Pap	Pap	“GIT up! What you 'bout?” I opened my eyes and looked around, trying to make out where I was. It was after sun-up, and I had been sound asleep. [MASK] was standing over me looking sour and sick, too.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	but about a dozen houses there, and if they didn't happen to have them lit up, how was we going to know we was passing a town? [MASK] said if the two big rivers joined together there, that would show.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Buck	That warn't usual. Next I noticed that [MASK] was up and gone. Well, I gets up, a-wondering, and goes down stairs--nobody around; everything as still as a mouse. Just the same outside. Thinks I, what does it mean?
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	[MASK] he grumbled a little, but give in. He said we mustn't talk any more than we could help, and then talk mighty low. The lightning showed us the wreck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboard derrick, and made fast there.
<name>Mary Jane</name>	Mary Jane	Huck	jis' as loud as I could yell. _She never budge!_ Oh, [MASK], I bust out a-cryin' en grab her up in my arms, en say, 'Oh, de po' little thing!
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Capet	“Well, this is it, [MASK]. I ain't easy; I ain't comfortable. That doctor lays on my mind. I wanted to know your plans. I've got a notion, and I think it's a sound one.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	Jump up and crack yo' heels! Dat's de good ole Cairo at las', I jis knows it!” I says: “I'll take the canoe and go and see, [MASK]. It mightn't be, you know.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	He raised considerable row about it, but me and [MASK] stuck to it and wouldn't budge; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose himself; but we wouldn't let him. Then he give us a piece of his mind,
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	I sung out for [MASK] about a dozen times, but I didn't get any answer; so I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was “treading water,” and struck out for shore, shoving it ahead of me.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Tom	“_No_, I ain't out of my _head_; I know all what I'm talking about. We _did_ set him free--me and [MASK]. We laid out to do it, and we _done_ it.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jim	CHAPTER XXXVIII. MAKING them pens was a distressid tough job, and so was the saw; and [MASK] allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all. That's the one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Buck	[MASK] said she could rattle off poetry like nothing. She didn't ever have to stop to think. He said she would slap down a line, and if she couldn't find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down another one, and go ahead.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Packard	I'm for putting him out of his troubles.” “So'm I,” says [MASK], very quiet. “Blame it, I'd sorter begun to think you wasn't. Well, then, that's all right.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	Well, I seemed to be in the open river again by and by, but I couldn't hear no sign of a whoop nowheres. I reckoned [MASK] had fetched up on a snag, maybe, and it was all up with him.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Tom	I could git my han's on one er dem witches jis' wunst--on'y jis' wunst--it's all I'd ast. But mos'ly I wisht dey'd lemme 'lone, I does.” [MASK] says: “Well, I tell you what I think.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Tom	I shot out and went for the doctor's house, but they told me he'd gone away in the night some time or other, and warn't back yet. Well, thinks I, that looks powerful bad for [MASK], and I'll dig out for the island right off.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	and so anybody in town would take it in a minute, let alone a hair-ball. Well, I knowed a potato would do that before, but I had forgot it. [MASK] put the quarter under the hair-ball, and got down and listened again.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	But we got to have it anyway. Come along.” So they got out and went in. The door slammed to because it was on the careened side; and in a half second I was in the boat, and [MASK] come tumbling after me.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Providence	Well, I see I was up a stump--and up it good. [MASK] had stood by me this fur all right, but I was hard and tight aground now. I see it warn't a bit of use to try to go ahead--I'd got to throw up my hand.
<name>Colonel</name>	Colonel	Buck	But he didn't git much chance to enjoy his luck, for inside of a week our folks laid _him_ out.” “I reckon that old man was a coward, [MASK].” “I reckon he _warn't_ a coward.
<name>Judy</name>	Judy	Missus	_” Whack comes the thimble, and the child snatches her claws out of the sugar-bowl without fooling around any. Just then the nigger woman steps on to the passage, and says: “[MASK], dey's a sheet gone.”
<name>partner</name>	partner	Sally	So you had it in your pocket all the time; and like as not you've got the other things there, too. How'd it get there?” “I reely don't know, [MASK],” he says, kind of apologizing, “or you know I would tell.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Huck	What he gwyne to do?” “Well, I don't know. Some of them gets on the police, and some of them learns people how to talk French.” “Why, [MASK], doan' de French people talk de same way we does?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	He looked pretty uneasy, and didn't say nothing for a minute. Then he says: “Maybe I better not tell.” “Why, [MASK]?” “Well, dey's reasons. But you wouldn' tell on me ef
<name>Uncle Silas</name>	Uncle Silas	Jim	And whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light, here comes a couple of the hounds bulging in from under [MASK]'s bed; and they kept on piling in till there was eleven of them, and there warn't hardly room in there to get your breath.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Betsy	I heard the people stirring around in the house now, and see a light. The man sung out: “Snatch that light away, [MASK], you old fool--ain't you got any sense? Put it on the floor behind the front door.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Le	I was too small when pap used to have 'em at the palace. Do you reckon you can learn me?” “Easy!” “All right. I'm jist a-freezn' for something fresh, anyway. [MASK]'s commence right away.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Buck	About an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around, some in their chairs and some in their rooms, and it got to be pretty dull. [MASK] and a dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	[MASK] he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn't take but a few hours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	He said that that would help. Then I slid out quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I warn't going to let [MASK] find out it was all my fault, not if I could help it.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	The match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the staple again, and the door was locked as good as ever. [MASK] was joyful. He says; “Now we're all right. We'll _dig_ him out.
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	Buck	“What's a feud?” “Why, where was you raised? Don't you know what a feud is?” “Never heard of it before--tell me about it.” “Well,” says [MASK], “a feud is this way:
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	I knowed dey was arter you. I see um go by heah--watched um thoo de bushes.” Some young birds come along, flying a yard or two at a time and lighting. [MASK] said it was a sign it was going to rain.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Buck	I cried a little when I was covering up [MASK]'s face, for he was mighty good to me. It was just dark now. I never went near the house, but struck through the woods and made for the swamp.
<name>Mark Twain</name>	Mark Twain	Jim	[MASK] said bees wouldn't sting idiots; but I didn't believe that, because I had tried them lots of times myself, and they wouldn't sting me. I had heard about some of these things before, but not all of them.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	“Most everybody thought it at first. He'll never know how nigh he come to getting lynched. But before night they changed around and judged it was done by a runaway nigger named [MASK].” “Why _he_--” I stopped. I reckoned I better keep still.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	Why, if dey was a rattlesnake to come in heah I'd take en bust right out thoo dat log wall, I would, wid my head.” “Why, [MASK], you wouldn't be afraid of it after a little. You could tame it.”
<name>Colonel Sherburn</name>	Colonel Sherburn	Sherburn	CHAPTER XXII. THEY swarmed up towards [MASK]'s house, a-whooping and raging like Injuns, and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped to mush, and it was awful to see.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jim	[MASK] said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the traps in the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island, and they would never find us without dogs.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Mam	If you was in his place it would make you feel ashamed; and so you oughtn't to say a thing to another person that will make _them_ feel ashamed.” “Why, [MASK], he said--” “It don't make no difference what he _said_--that ain't the thing.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	So [MASK] and me set to majestying him, and doing this and that and t'other for him, and standing up till he told us we might set down. This done him heaps of good, and so he got cheerful and comfortable.
<name>partner</name>	partner	Buck	But it's kind of slow, and takes a long time.” “Has this one been going on long, [MASK]?” “Well, I should _reckon_! It started thirty year ago, or som'ers along there.
<name>Sherburn</name>	Sherburn	Sherburn	Everybody that could get a chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they could lock him up and get him sober; but it warn't no use--up the street he would tear again, and give [MASK] another cussing.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Tom	I tell you if I catch you meddling with him again--” “Meddling with _who_?” [MASK] says, dropping his smile and looking surprised. “With _who_? Why, the runaway nigger, of course. Who'd you reckon?”
<name>Judy</name>	Judy	Tom	Why, it's perfectly ridiculous.” “Well, all right, [MASK], fix it your own way; but if you'll take my advice, you'll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline.” He said that would do.
<name>Jem</name>	Jem	Shore	If we was to give both our shares to him _now_ it wouldn't make no difference after the row and the way we've served him. [MASK]'s you're born, he'll turn State's evidence; now you hear _me_.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Huck	All I say is, kings is kings, and you got to make allowances. Take them all around, they're a mighty ornery lot. It's the way they're raised.” “But dis one do _smell_ so like de nation, [MASK].”
<name>land</name>	land	George	“My [MASK]! It's the beatenest thing I ever struck. And _then_ what did you all do?” “Well, we hollered and took on, but it's so wide there we couldn't make nobody hear.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	I had heard about some of these things before, but not all of them. [MASK] knowed all kinds of signs. He said he knowed most everything. I said it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck, and so I asked him if there warn't any good-luck signs.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	I got down there all out of breath but loaded up with joy, and sung out: “Set her loose, [MASK]! we're all right now!” But there warn't no answer, and nobody come out of the wigwam.
<name>Friday</name>	Friday	Jim	If the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire I built, and watched it all night for [MASK] to come. Anyways, they stayed away from us, and if my building the fire never fooled them it warn't no fault of mine.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	We hustled it on to the raft in a pile, and I told [MASK] to float along down, and show a light when he judged he had gone about two mile, and keep it burning till I come; then I manned my oars and shoved for the light.
<name>Pap</name>	Pap	Jim	[MASK] had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good sociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to bed, with hands that looked like they'd been chawed.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	When we was ready to shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was pretty broad day; so I made [MASK] lay down in the canoe and cover up with the quilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good ways off.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Huck	“Well, it don't, because it's in the breed. I reckon they're all alike.” “But, [MASK], dese kings o' ourn is reglar rapscallions; dat's jist what dey is; dey's reglar rapscallions.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	And it didn't. He told me what it was, and I see in a minute it was worth fifteen of mine for style, and would make [MASK] just as free a man as mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides.
<name>Huck</name>	Huck	Jim	[MASK] and me was in a sweat again for a minute, being afraid there was going to be some more trouble amongst them; so we was pretty glad when the duke says: “'Tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of oppression.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Sis	“But oh, dear, dear, what _will_ [MASK] say! He must a come! You must a missed him. He--” “Oh, don't distress me any more'n I'm already distressed. I don't know what in the world to make of it.
<name>a meal</name>	a meal	Peter	I passed along, and the parlor door was open; but I see there warn't nobody in there but the remainders of [MASK]; so I shoved on by; but the front door was locked, and the key wasn't there.
<name>rather</name>	rather	druther	His foot swelled up pretty big, and so did his leg; but by and by the drunk begun to come, and so I judged he was all right; but I'd [MASK] been bit with a snake than pap's whisky.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Blodgett	But then I says again, 'No, I reckon it ain't him, or else he wouldn't be paddling up the river.' You _ain't_ him, are you?” “No, my name's [MASK]--
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	He said it was a sign when young chickens flew that way, and so he reckoned it was the same way when young birds done it. I was going to catch some of them, but [MASK] wouldn't let me. He said it was death.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jim	The niggers was just getting through breakfast and starting for the fields; and [MASK]'s nigger was piling up a tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the others was leaving, the key come from the house.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jim	Of course there warn't nothing to be said but the one thing; so I says: “No; I ain't heard nobody say nothing.” Then he turns to [MASK], and looks him over like he never see him before, and says: “Did you sing out?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Tom	And so he went on a-mumbling up stairs, and then we left. He was a mighty nice old man. And always is. [MASK] was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon, but he said we'd got to have it; so he took a think.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	CHAPTER XLII. THE old man was uptown again before breakfast, but couldn't get no track of [MASK]; and both of them set at the table thinking, and not saying nothing, and looking mournful, and their coffee getting cold, and not eating anything.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Huck	“No!--is that so? _ain't_ it bully! Why, [MASK], if it was to do over again, I bet I could fetch two hundred! If we could put it off till--” “Hurry! _Hurry_!” I says.
<name>Emmeline</name>	Emmeline	Tom	Sometimes, do what we could, we couldn't keep her from falling over, and she come mighty near mashing us every time. [MASK] said she was going to get one of us, sure, before we got through.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jimminy	Pretty soon we struck the forward end of the skylight, and clumb on to it; and the next step fetched us in front of the captain's door, which was open, and by [MASK], away down through the texas-hall we see a light!
<name>Uncle Silas</name>	Uncle Silas	Saul	He told me to make myself easy and at home, and tell all about myself; but the old lady says: “Why, bless you, [MASK], the poor thing's as wet as he can be; and don't you reckon it may be he's hungry?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Buck	We was crossing the road. [MASK] says: “Quick! Jump for the woods!” We done it, and then peeped down the woods through the leaves. Pretty soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road, setting his horse easy and looking like a soldier.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	But [MASK] he showed him how unregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans, and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; and not to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, _sure_.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	THEY asked us considerable many questions; wanted to know what we covered up the raft that way for, and laid by in the daytime instead of running--was [MASK] a runaway nigger? Says I: “Goodness sakes! would a runaway nigger run _south_?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jim	Now you work your mind, and study out a plan to steal [MASK], and I will study out one, too; and we'll take the one we like the best.” What a head for just a boy to have!
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	That's the one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall. But he had to have it; [MASK] said he'd _got_ to; there warn't no case of a state prisoner not scrabbling his inscription to leave behind, and his coat of arms.
<name>Grangerford</name>	Grangerford	Grangerford	“I reckon maybe--I don't know.” “Well, who done the shooting? Was it a [MASK] or a Shepherdson?” “Laws, how do I know? It was so long ago.” “Don't anybody know?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	About two they come up again, though, and [MASK] was going to call me; but he changed his mind, because he reckoned they warn't high enough yet to do any harm; but he was mistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a regular ripper and washed me overboard.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Tom	So [MASK] said, now for the nonnamous letters. “What's them?” I says. “Warnings to the people that something is up. Sometimes it's done one way, sometimes another. But there's always somebody spying around that gives notice to the governor of the castle.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	Trouble is brewing. Keep a sharp lookout. _Unknown_ _Friend_. Next night we stuck a picture, which [MASK] drawed in blood, of a skull and crossbones on the front door; and next night another one of a coffin on the back door.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Aunty	“And _Jim_?” “The same,” I says, but couldn't say it pretty brash. But he never noticed, but says: “Good! Splendid! _Now_ we're all right and safe! Did you tell [MASK]?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her apron-pocket whilst she was a-giving us our sailing orders, and [MASK] got it all right, along with her shingle nail, before noon.
<name>Jimmie</name>	Jimmie	Huck	He never said nothing. But he sighed, and pretty soon he stopped digging, and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking. Then he says: “It ain't no use, [MASK], it ain't a-going to work.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Huck	You answer me that.” “Is a cat a man, [MASK]?” “No.” “Well, den, dey ain't no sense in a cat talkin' like a man. Is a cow a man?--er is a cow a cat?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	But [MASK] was dead against it at first. He says: “I doan' want to go fool'n 'long er no wrack. We's doin' blame' well, en we better let blame' well alone, as de good book says.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Tom	CHAPTER THE LAST THE first time I catched [MASK] private I asked him what was his idea, time of the evasion?--what it was he'd planned to do if the evasion worked all right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before?
<name>Jed</name>	Jed	Capet	After dinner the duke says: “Well, [MASK], we'll want to make this a first-class show, you know, so I guess we'll add a little more to it. We want a little something to answer encores with, anyway.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	That made me feel easy and satisfied. Of course when they got to snoring we had a long gabble, and I told [MASK] everything. CHAPTER XXXI. WE dasn't stop again at any town for days and days; kept right along down the river.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Bill	One of the men stuck his head out only about a couple of foot from me, and I thought I was gone; but he jerked it in again, and says: “Heave that blame lantern out o' sight, [MASK]!”
<name>Willy</name>	Willy	Jim	[MASK] looked at the trash, and then looked at me, and back at the trash again. He had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he couldn't seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its place again right away.
<name>Huckleberry</name>	Huckleberry	Susan	Then she put her arm around the king on one side, and [MASK] and the hare-lip done the same on the other. Everybody clapped their hands and stomped on the floor like a perfect storm, whilst the king held up his head and smiled proud.
<name>she</name>	she	Sid	I was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says: “About what, [MASK]?” “Why, about the way the whole thing was done.” “What whole thing?” “Why, _the_ whole thing.
<name>Abner</name>	Abner	Harvey	“Yes--regular.” “Where do you set?” “Why, in our pew.” “_Whose_ pew?” “Why, _ourn_--your Uncle [MASK]'s.” “His'n? What does _he_ want with a pew?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	she's all fixed up agin mos' as good as new, en we's got a new lot o' stuff, in de place o' what 'uz los'.” “Why, how did you get hold of the raft again, [MASK]--did you catch her?”
<name>Wilks</name>	Wilks	Le	But when the dead man says ther's six thous'n dollars, you know, we don't want to--” “Hold on,” says the duke. “[MASK]'s make up the deffisit,” and he begun to haul out yaller-boys out of his pocket.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jim	It warn't no slouch of an idea; and it warn't no slouch of a grindstone nuther; but we allowed we'd tackle it. It warn't quite midnight yet, so we cleared out for the mill, leaving [MASK] at work.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jim	So [MASK] went to work and told me the whole thing right through, just as it happened, only he painted it up considerable. Then he said he must start in and “'terpret” it, because it was sent for a warning.
<name>Jimmie</name>	Jimmie	Jim	[MASK] said the moon could a _laid_ them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I didn't say nothing against it, because I've seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it could be done.
<name>often</name>	often	generly	We lit the lantern, and judged she would see it. Up-stream boats didn't [MASK] come close to us; they go out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs; but nights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Huck	That's what they all do; and _he's_ got to, too. [MASK], you don't ever seem to want to do anything that's regular; you want to be starting something fresh all the time. S'pose he _don't_ do nothing with it?
