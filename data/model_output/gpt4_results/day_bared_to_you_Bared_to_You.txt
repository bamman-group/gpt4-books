<name>Adrian</name>	Adrian	Cary	[MASK] joined us by the breakfast bar. He was wearing loose-fitting black jeans and an off-the-shoulder black sweater. The look was casual and elegant and did a phenomenal job of offsetting his dark brown hair and emerald eyes.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Angel	“Only... when you say.” “[MASK].” One hand moved to my face, brushing back the strands of hair that clung to the perspiration on my skin. He kissed me deeply, reverently, licking deep into my mouth. Yes . . .
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Nathan	I screamed, but [MASK]’s hand covered my mouth. It pressed down on me, squashing my head into the pillow, lihe more I fought, the more excited he became. Panting like a dog, he rammed against me over and over . . .
<name>Adrian</name>	Adrian	Gideon	I wouldn’t survive you otherwise.” And still that fingertip massaged me, spurring a dark yearning. [MASK] could do that to me, make me forget everything that happened before. I had no negative sexual triggers with him, no hesitation or fears.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Gideon	I was about to climb into the back of the limo when [MASK] cursed under his breath, stopping me. “What?” I asked him. “I forgot something.” “Let me get my keys.”
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Eva	I dove for it with hands and mouth, ignoring his vicious curse. Pinning his torso with my forearm, I pumped him hard with my other fist and sucked voraciously on the sensitive crown. His thighs quivered, his legs kicking restlessly. “Damn it, [MASK].
<name>Olivia</name>	Olivia	Cross	“Told you,” he crowed. “Told me what?” “They recognized me from an entertainment news blog. One of the posts about you and [MASK].” I snorted. “Glad my love life is working out for someone.”
<name>John</name>	John	Parker	We warmed up with basic bodyweight calisthenics, then progressed to “tagging,” where we tried to tag each other’s shoulders and knees while standing face-to-face and blocking countermoves. [MASK] was amazing at tagging, of course, but I started to get the hang of it.
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Cary	“All right, all right. I’m coming.” Shutting down my computer, I cleared out. When I reached the bank of elevators, I pulled out my cell to text a quick On my way note to [MASK].
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Gideon	In the course of the exam they found evidence of. . . other trauma. Vaginal and anal scarring—” [MASK] set his glass down on the end table with a harsh thud. “I’m sorry,” I whispered, feeling like I might be sick.
<name>Dad</name>	Dad	Stanton	Who was I fooling? I’d end up going anyway. My mom and [MASK] supported abused children’s charities because they were significant to me. Going to the occasional stuffy event was a small price to pay for the return. Taking a deep breath, I consciously relaxed.
<name>Sebastian</name>	Sebastian	Cary	“Perhaps you’ll both come to dinner later this week?” His only answer was an arched brow. Then his gaze lifted, luring my attention to follow it. I found [MASK] emerging from what appeared to be a hedgerow maze with a very recognizable pop princess on his arm.
<name>James</name>	James	Gideon	I felt the familiar tension grip [MASK] and tightened my grasp on his hips, spurring him on, desperate to feel him spurting inside me. “No!” He wrenched away, falling to his back and throwing an arm over his eyes.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Monica	And you.” I pushed back from the table. “You’re enabling her. You’re keeping her sick, and you’re making me sick, too.” “Sit down. You need to eat. [MASK] worries that you’re not eating healthy enough.”
<name>Ana</name>	Ana	Eva	“You’ve asked me to reacquaint your body with acts previously used to hurt and terrorize you. I can’t tell you what your trust means to me or what it would do to me if I broke that trust. I can’t risk it, [MASK].
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Gideon	I stared unabashedly, drinking him in as he stood naked in front of me. “Answer one question for me, [MASK]. Why do you want me, when you can have your pick of perfection instead? And I’m not fishing for compliments or reassurances.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Eva	“How could you, [MASK]?” She was crying into a monogrammed handkerchief, her face beautiful even while reddened and wet with tears. “Why?" Jolted out of my torment by her misery, I frowned and asked, “What did I do now?”
<name>Lucien</name>	Lucien	Eva	You’re dreaming. Come back to me.” He deflated into the mattress. “[MASK] ... ?” “I’m here.” Shifting, I moved out of the way of the moonlight but saw no luminous glitter that would tell me his eyes were open.
<name>James</name>	James	Gideon	And [MASK] didn’t stop. He circled the trembling entrance to my body with the tip of his tongue and lapped at my throbbing clit until I quickened again. Two fingers pushed inside me, curving and stroking. I was so sensitive I thrashed against the onslaught.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Gideon	One of the girls in group had talked about how her “master” could use her body any time and in any way he wanted, for his pleasure alone. There was nothing about that I’d found sexy . . . until I put [MASK] in the picture.
<name>myself</name>	myself	Magdalene	“And at that time, I didn’t. Not yet.” “Doesn’t excuse me, does it?” I gratefully accepted another glass of champagne when it was offered to me and took a second for [MASK] before the waiter straightened to move on.
<name>Adrian</name>	Adrian	Gideon	On tiptoes, I kissed the reddened handprint I’d left on his cheek, clutching his thick silky hair in my hands. [MASK] bent his knees to align our bodies, his breathing harsh and erratic. “I’ll do whatever you want, whatever you need.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Eva	“Oh, [MASK].” His cheek pressed to the crown of my head. I snuggled closer. “You make me feel safe.” We held each other for long moments. I listened as his heartbeat slowed and his breathing smoothed out.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Gideon	Too fast, I thought. I was falling too fast. “[MASK]—” He kissed me deeply, licking into my mouth in that way of his. I thought he could really make me come with just a kiss, if we stayed at it long enough.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Eva	I warned you. I wanted you to have this memory of me.” His eyes widened with alarm. “Why the fuck do I need memories when I have you? [MASK], if this is about the photo—” “Shut up and enjoy the high.”
<name>Rowan</name>	Rowan	Gideon	I’d lived with the fear that the people you loved might turn away from you if they ever got to know the true person hidden inside. “[MASK]—” His lips touched my temple. “I think I loved you the moment I saw you.
<name>him</name>	him	Cross	“It’s easy to forget he’s so young when he’s right in front of you.” “Yes,” I agreed, secretly disappointed that I wouldn’t see [MASK] for the next two days. As much as I told myself it didn’t matter, I was bummed.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Gideon	I came to an abrupt halt and someone coming out behind me bumped into me. I could barely manage an apology; I was too busy visually devouring [MASK]’s body. His legs were toned and powerful, flawlessly proportional to his trim hips and waist.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Eva	The elevator arrived and I stepped into it. Facing him, I countered, “Monday lunch.” We’d have only an hour, a guaranteed escape. Just before the doors closed, he said, “We’re going to happen, [MASK].”
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Magdalene	She looked like a fucking supermodel and exuded an exotic sex appeal. I accepted the hand towel the bathroom attendant handed me, and [MASK] spoke to the woman in Spanish, asking her to give us some privacy. I capped the request with, “Por favor, gracias.”
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Cary	He was just my boyfriend, hanging out. It was all so sweet and uncomplicated, and I found the illusion a poignant one. The intercom buzzed and [MASK] leaped to his feet to answer it. He glanced at me with a smile.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Gideon	Nursing my misery, I debating letting it go to voice mail because I could see on the screen that it was [MASK]—plus he was the only one who had the number—but I couldn’t ignore it, because he was clearly frantic.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Mark	Does she like Chinese?” I gave [MASK] the thumbs-up. He grinned. “Yes, she does.” “All right. I’ll be there in twenty. Let security know I’m coming.”
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Gideon	His teeth bit gently into my flesh, conveying his animal need with a rough sound of desire. All the while he fucked me with his fingers, his other hand massaging my clit, making me come again and again from the simultaneous stimulation. “[MASK]!”
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Mark	I headed up to the twentieth floor and found [MASK] still at his desk. He offered me a quick smile despite his air of concentration. “If you don’t really need me,” I said, “I think it’d be good for me to sit this presentation out.”
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Gideon	It was. I made sure of it. Feeling goofy with feminine triumph, I sat at [MASK]’s dining table and remembered him as he’d been just a short time ago—damp with sweat and panting, cursing as I took my time savoring his luscious body.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Eva	As much as I’d wanted to wound him earlier, I couldn’t stand to do it now. “Hello.” My voice didn’t sound like mine, clogged as it was with tears and emotion. “[MASK]!
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Stanton	I’d managed to snag a glass off a passing waiter’s tray when I heard someone call out my name. Turning, I saw [MASK]’s nephew approaching with a broad smile. Dark-haired and green-eyed, he was around my age.
<name>Jackson</name>	Jackson	Cary	I looked up at him, my eyes swimming in tears. “I don’t know what to do.” [MASK] sighed, his green eyes dark and serious. “I think you need to decide if you’re in over your head, baby girl.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Gideon	Placing our linked hands at the small of my back, he pulled me close and smacked a kiss on my mouth. “[MASK]!” His mother glided toward us with sparkling eyes and a wide smile on her lovely face. “I’m so happy you’re here.”
<name>he</name>	he	Gideon	I held him until our bodies cooled and our breathing evened. When [MASK] finally rolled off me, he didn’t go far. He wrapped himself around my back and whispered, “Sleep now.” I don’t remember if I stayed awake long enough to reply.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Gideon	“Saving it up in case an old flame popped back into your life, one you’d prefer to screw instead.” [MASK] tossed back his drink, then secured me to his side with a steely arm around my waist and led me through the crowd to the door.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Angus	It would be another scar to add to his collection, another bitter memory he’d always have, a memory I would share and fear along with him, but it wouldn’t rule us. We wouldn’t let it. [MASK] was waiting to take me home when my day ended.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Eva	my crazy mother . . .” My fingers covered his mouth before he could open it. “But you’re worth it, and I want you bad enough. So I guess I don’t have a choice, do I?” “[MASK].
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Cary	“[MASK]’s not in,” he said. “They just tried calling.” “You’re welcome to come up with me and wait. I won’t be going out again.” “If you really don’t mind.”
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Gideon	“There’s always lunch,” I suggested, fantasizing about a nooner on [MASK]’s office couch. “I have a business lunch today. I’d reschedule, if I hadn’t moved it already yesterday.” “You rescheduled an appointment for me?
<name>Christine</name>	Christine	Eva	“Don’t burn off too much energy,” I whispered. “I want you missionary style the first time. I’ve been having this fantasy of you on top, banging the hell out of me.” His gaze burned into me. “[MASK], you have no idea.”
<name>Jamie</name>	Jamie	Gideon	I think you’ll need it.” I took a cautious sip of the liquor, feeling the instantaneous burn, followed by recognition that I liked the flavor. I took a bigger drink. Rolling his glass between his palms, [MASK] took another drink and eyed me thoughtfully.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Gideon	Instead, I chose to look at it as more proof of his attentiveness. He thought of everything. The highlight of my morning had been helping [MASK] dress in one of his seriously sexy suits. I’d buttoned his shirt; he’d tucked it into his pants.
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Gideon	Lack of sleep from the night before had left me wiped out. I was contemplating taking the subway rather than walking when I saw [MASK]’s Bentley at the curb. When the driver got out and greeted me by name, I halted abruptly, surprised.
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Gideon	[MASK] introduced me to people, and I supposed I performed well enough—spoke at the appropriate moments and smiled when necessary—but I wasn’t really paying attention. I was too conscious of the icy wall between us and my own hurt anger.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Gideon	[MASK] and I called it a night shortly after and headed to my room. As we got ready for bed, I asked him something I’d wondered about earlier. “Did you have a fuck pad in college, too?” His T-shirt cleared his head.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Gideon	Clutching the ring box in my hand, I went to my side of [MASK]’s bed and set it on the nightstand. I wanted it where I’d see it first thing in the morning, after a good night’s sleep.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Christopher	“Seeing [MASK]’s face on the video—seeing what he really thought of her—that hurt her. It’s hard to see yourself being used that way. Especially by someone you think you know, someone who’s supposed to care about you.”
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Eva	“Stay away from my brother, [MASK].” “Why?” “Because I said so.” My temper ignited, which felt good after all the self-recrimination and doubts I’d been drowning in since we’d screwed like feral bunnies.
<name>Jake</name>	Jake	Cross	My clit throbbed for attention, pounding along with my raging heartbeat. I was vaguely aware of movement, and then the couch was against my back. [MASK] was levered over me with one knee on the cushion and the other foot on the floor.
<name>Jackson</name>	Jackson	Gideon	The orgasm poured through me in a scorching wave. I cried out, pumping my hips mindlessly into his mouth, lost to the primal connection between us. [MASK] held me up as my knees weakened, tongu-ing my quivering flesh until the last tremor faded.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Gideon	He was too closed off not to bear some painful emotional scars. With a critical and curious eye, I studied the women who’d been photographed with [MASK] and thought about his approach to dating, socializing, and sex. I saw that my mom had been right—they were all brunettes.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Cary	“[MASK], I love you madly.” He grinned. “Back atcha, sweets. My advice, for what it’s worth? Couples therapy. It’s always been my plan to get into it when I find the one I want to settle down with.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Gideon	Your eyes are a stormy gray, yet they’re so clear and direct. Quite the most beautiful eyes I think I’ve ever seen, aside from my wife’s.” I flushed. “Thank you.” “Is [MASK] coming?”
<name>Trinity</name>	Trinity	Eva	He shut the water off, caging me to the glass with both arms. “You want me to tell you I love you, [MASK]? Is that what this is about?” My stomach cramped as if he’d struck me with the full force of his fist.
<name>Anita</name>	Anita	Eva	His jacket flew past me to land on the seat; then his hand pushed between my legs from the front. He growled at finding me wet and swollen. “You were made for me, [MASK]. You can’t go long without me inside you.”
<name>Simon</name>	Simon	Gideon	The door to my bedroom was open behind me and [MASK] was inside, looking pale and haunted. “I’ll set out some blankets and pillows for him, too. I don’t think he should go home alone. He’s shredded.”
<name>Adrian</name>	Adrian	Brilliant	Beautiful, dahling. Show me sassy. Show me sexy. [MASK]. Show me catty... rawr... Embarrassed, I squirmed a little on the seat. “Like I said, you don’t have to keep—” “I—” He cleared his throat.
<name>Gran</name>	Gran	Mark	I’d been gone just about an hour, but I wasn’t going to use the extra time [MASK] had given me. I needed work to distract me from my crazy-ass family. As I caught an empty elevator car, I ripped open a bar and bit viciously into it.
<name>Camille</name>	Camille	Gideon	My breath left me in a rush. I hadn’t expected that. He was a man who wanted no complications with his sex and I was a woman who found sex complicated, but he wasn’t giving up. Yet. “We need to be friendly, [MASK].
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Terry	“Not now.” [MASK]’s gaze moved to my face. “You don’t have to tolerate him talking to you that way. All the money in the world doesn’t give anyone the right to order you around.”
<name>Sebastian</name>	Sebastian	Cary	[MASK] nodded sagely. “Bad boys can be fun, if you don’t get too close.” Of course he would know; men and women of all ages fell at his feet. Still, he somehow managed to pick the wrong partner every time.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Gideon	The head of his cock aligned with the slick entrance of my body and he pushed inexorably into me. I moaned, shifting to accommodate the heavy surge of his penis. [MASK]’s breath gusted hard and humid against my throat, his big frame trembling as he slid carefully inside me.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Gideon	A new city, new apartment, new job, and new man. It was a lot to take on at once. I supposed it was understandable that I felt off-balance. I glanced at [MASK] and found him staring at me with an unreadable expression.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Gideon	I planned on telling him again one day in the future, but as far as first times went, I thought we’d both done okay. At ten o’clock sharp, I had two dozen long-stemmed red roses delivered to [MASK]’s office with the note:
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Eva	For example, if not hearing from [MASK] for a few days troubles you, perhaps a text message or an e-mail will alleviate that.” “Okay.” “If you like, we can go over the list together.”
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Cary	“Don’t worry about me. I know I’ve been a mess lately, but I’ll get it together. Go on and enjoy yourself.” After [MASK] rushed out, I paused the movie and went to the kitchen for some wine.
<name>She</name>	She	Christopher	When we reached the counter, I ordered a grilled vegetable-and-cheese panini with two pomegranate smoothies, asking them to hold the one with a protein shot for thirty minutes so I could eat in. [MASK] ordered the same, and we managed to find a table in the crowded deli.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Gideon	Not yet. I felt too raw and vulnerable. “Just hold me, [MASK]. Please.” He nodded, wrapping his arms around me. I urged him to sink to the floor with me, hoping I could get him to fall asleep.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Cary	He halted and shot me an incredulous look. “I’m not fucking leaving you here. [MASK]’s lost his damned mind! That amped-up asshole was seconds away from putting his hands on you when I got here.”
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Gideon	When [MASK] showed up at my apartment later that evening, he found me soaking my aching body in my bathtub. Although I could tell he was fresh from a shower after his own workout with his personal trainer, he stripped and slid into the bath behind me, cradling me with his arms and legs.
<name>Jackson</name>	Jackson	Gideon	[MASK] crowded in behind me, forcing me to scramble across the seat. The door shut and we were off. I yanked the skirt of my sheath dress back into place. “What are you doing? Besides embarrassing me in front of my boss.”
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Gideon	When we entered his home, he led me straight through his beautiful, expansive living room and down the hall to his bedroom. There, laid out on the bed, was a fabulous cocktail dress the color of [MASK]’s eyes and a floor-length black silk robe.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Cary	He lowered the volume on the baseball game he was watching. “He’s bad news for me. He’s like one giant trigger. I just need to stay away from him.” [MASK] had been through therapy with me, and he knew the drill.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Gideon	I touched his face, his hair, his shoulders. He was as broken as I was, in a way I didn’t yet know about. “I need something from you, [MASK].” “Anything. Just tell me what it is.”
<name>Adrian</name>	Adrian	Eva	I breathed him in, telling myself to relax and enjoy his company. He took my hand and ran his fingertips over the palm, the simple touch sparking a fierce lust. I shrugged off my wrap, feeling too hot to wear it. “[MASK].”
<name>Jackson</name>	Jackson	Gideon	“That would be great.” I stepped back as the music ended and bumped into someone behind me. Hands went to my waist to steady me and I looked over my shoulder to find [MASK] at my back.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Eva	“I’m not touching that one, [MASK].” “Okay. You want to figure out what it’s going to take to get me into bed. Is that why you’re here in this club right now? Because of me?
<name>Sebastian</name>	Sebastian	Eva	His balls were heavy and big, an audacious display of his powerful virility. I cupped them, rolling them gently, feeling them tighten and draw up. “Ah, [MASK]" His voice was a guttural rasp. His grip tightened in my hair.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Megumi	I just didn’t know if they were enough to override his survival instinct. [MASK] called me again. “Oh my God,” she said, laughing. “You should’ve seen her face when whoever that was came to get her.” “Good.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Cross	“That’s great. I really love my job.” “Good. Good, I’m glad.” He shot me a quick smile. “Just ... be careful with [MASK], okay?” I blinked, startled by the direction of the conversation.
<name>Jamie</name>	Jamie	Eva	He lifted his head, looking at me in the faint light of the moon. Kneeing my legs open, he pushed the first bare inch inside me. He was scorching hot and silky soft. “[MASK],” he breathed, clutching me tightly to him.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Eva	“Do you have any idea how crazy I am about you?” he murmured. “You’re crazy all right, if you think I’m going to put up with being ordered around, especially sexually.” “Come on, [MASK].
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Eva	When he returned to the kitchen he grabbed his wine and said, “All right. Spill it, [MASK]. You look stressed.” “I am,” I agreed, grabbing the bottle and moving into the living room.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Cary	[MASK] had filmed the video at the Vidals’ garden party. From the eight-foot-high hedges in the background, he was in the maze, and from the leaves framing the screen, he was in hiding. The star of the show was a couple locked in a passionate embrace.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Magdalene	“Right. Like [MASK] knows you’re mine.” I wished he had something near my mouth that I could bite. “You’re causing a scene.” “We could’ve done this in my office, if you weren’t so damned stubborn.”
<name>Trina</name>	Trina	Gideon	“And [MASK] agreed to the couples counseling you suggested. I thought we’d turned a corner. Maybe we did, but we hit a brick wall anyway.” “You seem okay, though.” He leaned into the breakfast bar. “No tears.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Cary	I’ll be at my desk if you need me.” Before I put my purse in the drawer, I texted [MASK] to ask if he had plans on Sunday and if he’d like to go to a Vidal Records party. Then I got back to work.
<name>Daemon</name>	Daemon	Gideon	If he nudged my clit again, I’d come. I was too wound up to Stop it. [MASK]’s chest vibrated against my cheek as he spoke. “We’d be done sooner if you’d go, so tell me what you need.”
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Cary	You’re booked for dinner at seven. Have fun!” Then I clocked out, eager to get home. “He said what?” [MASK] sat on the opposite end of our white sectional sofa and shook his head. “I know, right?”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Gideon	“Oh.” My mother twisted her handkerchief around her fingers. “I hadn’t thought of it that way.” I reached out for my mother’s hand when her lower lip trembled violently. “Nothing could’ve stopped me from talking to [MASK] about my past.
<name>Chandler</name>	Chandler	Cary	I made a mental note to hang on to it as a great piece of print advertising. A stream of quickly moving pedestrians flowed around us. [MASK] squinted down at the lettering, having a few more drinks in him than I did. “Looks swank.”
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Angel	You want to talk about a look on someone’s face. The look on yours . . . How could you look at her like that after what she said to me?” “[MASK] . . .” His lips moved ardently over my face.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Gideon	The feel of [MASK]’s finger in that darkly sexual place, thrusting in that gentle rhythm, had me rocking backward to meet his inward drives. “You’re so beautiful,” he murmured, his voice infinitely gentle. “I love making you feel good.
