<name>He</name>	He	Tridib	he said, his voice quiver-ing in triumph. They had two daughters: one with a face like a vulture, and another one who was as poisonous as a cobra but all pretty and goody-goody to look at. • .■ [MASK] began to laugh.
<name>his</name>	his	Jus	But neither then nor later, when they handcuffed him and led him out of the room did he betray his fear again or allow [MASK] gaze to drop from the officer’s face. She scratched my head gently, and looking up. I saw her drawing her knuckles across moist eyes.
<name>Janet</name>	Janet	Robi	cKp fnrnprl fn mp Kill- DnKi tfurl nnfhirur do know, and they don’t care because Trotskyists aren’t joyless little clerks like you’re getting to be. I— She was angry with herself as soon as she said it. Oh come on [MASK], she pleaded.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lizzie	She had a book with her that she had had to put away the night before, when she was only twenty pages from the end because [MASK] had switched off the lights in her bedroom. She flopped into a deckchair beside the lily-pond and in a moment she was absorbed in her book.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Malik	Isn’t it odd, someone said, that we can remember it so well? Why no. said [MASK]. It’s not odd at all. It was the mostimpor-tant thing that happened in thc country when we were c hildren.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Robi	We watched as his face creased into a smile and then clouded over with a leering, greedy suspicion. Then she smiled again, and he, nodding eagerly, stepped out to take her hand. I heard the scrape of [MASK]’s chair and stepped sideways to stop him.
<name>Rahul</name>	Rahul	Ila	Don’t touch me. We’ll pay and we’ll leave right now, but don’t touch me. He took out his wallet and handed one of the waiters a fifty-rupee note. Then he put his arm around [MASK] and led us out.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Ila	[MASK] vanished into a knot of people, all eager to examine and exclaim over the only grandchild of the house. She let them fuss over her for a while then suddenly she broke free of them, snatched at my hand and dragged me across the paved terrace.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Tridib	[MASK] was nodding at her, shyly; I could tell he was trying to smile. I didn’t blame him: the moment seemed so unbearably poignant I was sure in his place I would not have been able to ■smile either.
<name>Wiesenthal</name>	Wiesenthal	Tridib	It was a wonderful, sad little story, he said. I forgot all about the air raid while he vyasJtellingitto me. "Where did it happen? I asked. Which country? Ah, said [MASK]. That’s the trick, you see.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Mayadebi	A week later there was a letter for my grandmother. It was from [MASK]. My father turned it over and he and my mother exchanged glances. Then he handed the letter to me and told me to take it up to my grandmother’s room.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Ila	In exultation the organ of St Martin-in-the-Fields boomed out the first rising notes of a Bach toccata, and at the same moment I saw her, [MASK], picking her way through the crowd that had gathered at the steps of the National Gallery.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tublu	I wasn’t quite sure 1 had heard anything at all, when I saw [MASK], who was sitting next to me, looking up too. I mouthed the words: What is it? But he didn’t know either: he made a face and shrugged.
<name>Tayadebi</name>	Tayadebi	Mayadebi	T can’t permit it. You must wait a few days. He appealed mutely tcTKTayadebi to reason with her. Of course we’ll go soon, said [MASK] calmly. We’ll go a few days later. A week won’t make any difference to anyone.
<name>Marya</name>	Marya	Maya	What else could he have done? [MASK] ought to be proud of him. /Vnjaroud of him; but then, he’s like me,.not likeMajya. She was silent for a while, leaning back in her chair, with her hands folded in her lap.
<name>She</name>	She	Shnstopped	You poor little guy; you’re really cold, aren’t you? [MASK] jogging long enough to give me a hug. You shouldn’t be living in a primitive country like this, she said. You need to be in some place with central heating and hot water, like the States.
<name>He</name>	He	Nick	We watched the spit turning a tiny pool of foaming mud. ie must be filthy, I said. Eating his own hair. Iou’re just jealous. 11a said grinning, because your own hair is so short. [MASK] looks sweet when his hair falls over his eyes: everyone says so.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Ila	He shrugged, threw away his cigarette, and stood up. I suppose we should be going, he said. Then [MASK], who had been sitting beside him, stood up too and put an arm around his shoulders and another around mine, and held us together.
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	11a	But [MASK] was right behind us, and with a rustle of silk she shepherded us through the corridor, into a chandeliered hall. She led us to the reception counter and in the plummiest of her English accents she asked them tQ-show us the way to the nightclub.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Puzzled	[MASK], I asked her whether there were other people in the room. No, no, she said quickly it’s not that. There’s no one here. Then what’s the matter? I said. Why do you sound so odd? sS
<name>Jeel</name>	Jeel	le.thamoshai	After he.diedr..J,elhajaiQshau.ai.th.e .eldest son, tried hard to step into his place, but without success. He was an odd man, [MASK]; in some ways he was an oddly lovable man, but in others he was even more frightening than his father.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Robi	Why, he said, I looked much more like her than you ever did. I could not argue with that: even my grandmother had always said so. She would put a finger on [MASK]’s strong rounded chin, and say: You get that from me; that’s mine.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	May	[MASK] seated herself on the rim of the bathtub and touched her face again—it was still hot. It wasftot-pecause she was angry, she decided. And no wonder shtTwnrfSngry anyone would be if they’d got a pornographic letterjrom a man they’d never met, would never meet.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Tie	[MASK] cried like that all the way home, for all of us. It would not be enough to sav we were afraid: we were stupefied with fear. That particular fear has a texture you can neither forget nor ( describe.
<name>She</name>	She	WeirriYs	sS* Look, she said. I meant to come to the airport with you, to see you off. I really meant to. vou know But Don’t worry about that, I said. What’s happened? [MASK] likeidiis, ^heXaid.
<name>Tridib</name>	Tridib	May	My knees were shaking and the palms of my hands were wet. Ila_-turned her back on me and pulled off her jacket and sweater, talking in a low voice all the while, about [MASK] and how she nad ruined the evening.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Robi	The students’ union was unanimous in calling for a strike. But [MASK], alone in the whole college, refused to go along with everyone else: he didn’t argue or make speeches, he merely refused to attend the union meetings.
<name>Sheela</name>	Sheela	Ila	He was on leave from his job in the Indian Administrative Service, so that he could take up a fellowship in administration and public affairs for six months. We had decided to spend the eVening together. [MASK] laughed when I reminded her about those Yearbooks, and y natural.
<name>since</name>	since	Qi^£u	He'd met her in a puh or something and he’s been seeing her_fp.r a year [MASK]>since.long.before we~Wgre married. Hes got an Indonesian woman in line too somewhere. AncTtHere s me. of course. "Why does hedo it? I said.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Ila	There were catamarans painted on the walls and clusters of coconuts were dangling from the roof. [MASK] pointed at the band, on a platform beside the dance floor; it consisted of four men in dark suits, bow ties, and straw hats.
<name>her</name>	her	Ila	Oh dear, she said, don’t know about that, I wasn’t here then. Would you like me to ring the director? I shook my head, thanked her and led [MASK] out again. She was indignant now, as well as surprised.
<name>he</name>	he	Nick	Well^he said, following my pointing finger, you’re positively a mystic from the east. You’ve done it again. When we reached the house I leaned over the hedge to look into the garden before [MASK] could unlatch the little gate.
<name>He</name>	He	Malik	Do you remember the date? [MASK] said. Or even the month? I shook my head. No, I said. I don’t remember. Well, we can’t look through all of these at random, he said, nodding at the four volumes.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Tha’mma	I rose guiltily from my chair, angry with myself for having told her the story, and tried to calm her. It doesn’t matter [MASK], 1 said, pulling her shawl over her thin, trembling shoulders. It doesn’t matter. Lie down now and,rest.
<name>Jonas</name>	Jonas	Tridib	[MASK] scratches his head, wondering what to do, and sud-suddenly he says, Yes, come on, let’s go in, down to the shelter, and we’ll all listen to a story, a nice one—in fact the best in the world.
<name>Max</name>	Max	Tridib	I looked around and the cavernous room seemed suddenly full of indistinct shapes, murky green in that strangely acquatic light, like the looming heads of rock in a picture that [MASK] had once shown me, of the cave of a moray eel.
<name>Yoko</name>	Yoko	Tridib	She scrambled down the side of the embankment to the flooded ricefields below, and plunged her arms deep into the water. She stayed thwe a long rune, washing "[MASK] and I were sitting in the c.ar when she climbed back up to the road.
<name>Jethamoshai</name>	Jethamoshai	EfisTace^	My grandmother was distraught now; she couldn’t bear to sit still any longer. She leapt to her feet and shouted: Jethamoshai don’t you know who I am? ■"[MASK] twisted into a peevish scowl as he turned slowly to look at her.
<name>Lucia</name>	Lucia	Tridib	J C/3 could not go there without hearing [MASK]’s soft voice whisper- I- v''1 ing: This is our ruin: this is where we meet. I would wonder V. / —V. % abouftfiose words, they, would ring in my head and I would ^' '
<name>Snipe</name>	Snipe	Snipe	Snipe’s.story to look forward to tonight. [MASK] has promised that it’s going to be a nice, long story, a good, proper Middle English story; he knows it well, he says, because he’s been teaching it to his students for years.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Tridib	[MASK] could see them quite clearly, years later, walking down that road in the creeping darkness, holding tightly on to each other. But he knew thatthe_c]arity ofthat.image in his mind was merely the c^irpyr rlarity oflignprance; an illusion of Tcnowledge created by a deceptive weight of remembered detail.
<name>Ramachandra</name>	Ramachandra	Robi	But the food was delicious in its own way, and we ate heartily while [MASK] told us stories about his colleagues in the Indian Administrative Service—funny stories about lonely youiv—-men who lived in huge colonial mansions in remote districts and spent their time writing symbolist poetry and masturbating.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Maya	She smiled: That I never got to see the upside-down house. What was that? I said. She began to laugh. When the house was divided, she said, [MASK] was very little and"she didn’t remember the other side at all.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Tridib	It was not her fault that she could not understand, for as [MASK] often said of her, the inventions she lived in moved with her, so that although she had lived in many places, she had never travelled at all.
<name>Timothy</name>	Timothy	Khalil	And [MASK] has looked after him ever since. He glanced at them quickly, out of the comers of his eyes. Of course, he added, it’s getting very difficult for him now. He can’t afford it any longer.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	May	So you’re used to crowds, [MASK] said laughing. She showed me how to hang the posters on the railing that divided the pavement from the road. Then she tapped my collection box and said, Go on—good hunting.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Ila	Why not? my mother cried, turning to her in alarm. But I’ve already made... Because, my grandmother said, her eves boring into-mine: because [MASK] is here. I waited, not daring to believe what she had said.
<name>She</name>	She	Tridihlaughed	Tell me. aHt shouldn’t be here, she blurted out. It’s an act of violence. It’s obscene. [MASK] and tilted her face up. Her eyes were wide open now, looking directly at him. No it’s not, he said.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	May	It was full of people I didn’t know. [MASK] started to say something, but there was a crisis in the kitchen and someone called her away. 1 found another glass of wine, sank_jnto an armchair and shut my eyes.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Kerry	[MASK] and I had first met late one July night, pn the landing outside our rooms. We had both burst out of our rooms upon hearing a series of loud thuds in the third room on our floor, where a bearded young Scandinavian had recently moved in.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ila	For a while all I could see was a pale green glow filtering in through a window, set so high up in the wall that it seemed like a skylight. It’s small rectangle of glass was mildewed over on the outside by grass and moss. Look! I said to [MASK].
<name>Trujillo</name>	Trujillo	Tridib	If freedom were ^possible, surely [MASK]’s death would have set me free. An3~ yet, all it takes to set my hand shaking like a leaf, fifteen years later, thousands of miles away, aLthe other end of another continent, is a chance remark by a waiter in a restaurant.
<name>John</name>	John	Robi	What did you think you were doing? Look, [MASK] said. It’s over now, let’s just forget it. We won’t forget it, she said; she was screaming now, but with her voice very low, in that way women have.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	May	I need a coffee too now, [MASK] said. I’ve fasted enough for today. She went to the counter and came back with a cup of coffee and a sandwich. We went to that old house of theirs, she said, stirring her coffee, looking at me in the mirror.
<name>Joseph</name>	Joseph	Khalil	He’s very old and not quite right in the mind. £Ie doesn’t recognise people any more—that’s why you have to wait for [MASK] before you go to meet him? Y ou may hotfind it easy to get him to leave.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Nick	[MASK], hugely amused, told her how 1 had shown them the way to the house, and how I had known that they had a cherry tree. I’ve heard so much about it you see, I said awkwardly. I was embarrassed now.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Ila	Over the last few months the flesh had wasted slowly away from her face so that the skin on her cheeks hung down now, like dry, brittle leather. [MASK] has no right to live there, she said hoarsely. She doesn’t belong there.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Nick	Aghast, I tugged at the back of her smock and asked her what kind of game we could possibly play under it. Come on, she said; she was already on her knees crawling through the dust. Come on, I’ll show you. It’s the game I play with [MASK].
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Jethamoshai	almfJsTTarne to bdievFTiTo'ur story. Often, when" we were quite grown up, going to school and everything, we would sit in the patch of garden in front of their part of the house, and watch [MASK]’s door and try to imagine what was going on inside.
<name>Ratna</name>	Ratna	Mayadebi	When the car drew up we saw that he was wearing a pale-green corduroy jacket with a silk cravat. Then [MASK] jumped out and she and my grandmother hurried towards each other and embraced, laughing, and talking quickly in that language that none of us could understand properly, their old Dhaka dialect.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Dan	And now the three of them were fast asleep, on the mattresses they had laid out below the stairs when the bombing began. [MASK] flinched as a high-pitched metallic shriek tore the air, but then it went suddenly silent, so he relaxed and drew on his cigarette.
<name>I</name>	I	May	Can you sit on the pavement and twang on it for a bit? He was taken aback, but he nodded, squatted on the roadside and duly plucked at the string. We listened for a while to its deep, monotonous drone. [MASK] was a little disappointed.
<name>Shanta</name>	Shanta	Sunayana	Or: That’s [MASK], she’s our Tamil for this term, wait till you taste her uppama, you’ll want to be Tamil yourself. But then, in her mounting excitement, she began to make mistakes.
<name>he</name>	he	ne	And the old man didn’t care anyway—there was a family living there who looked after him, and that was enough as tar as [MASK] was concerned. He was—you know—not quite all there; he didn’treally dire What happened. ’ ’ ^
<name>Miss O'Shea</name>	Miss O'Shea	Mrj_Anderson	She laid down her book and marched around the room shutting the windows. The glass^panes of our windows had been painted green to kefep out the summer sun. Now we sat trapped in a verdant darkness while [MASK]'s voice boomed and echoed through our classroom, explaining the principles of algebra.
<name>James</name>	James	Jethamoshai	My grandmother, since she was the elder, would always-hove v.t.0 carry, these, and she came to dread those missions for she would have to wait beside [MASK]’s chair while he read them over and over again until the veins in his forehead began to throb with anger.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Robi	Nothing as simple as that, said [MASK] wryly. No, at least a castle on a misty mountaintop. But in my memory I see it emerging out of that storm of dust like a plateau in a desert.
<name>James</name>	James	Tridib	Then she took a deep breath, forced herself to look up again, walked over to the car and came back with the large leather handbag she always carried. Opening it, she took out a penknife and a handkerchief. What’s she going to do? I shouted in panic to [MASK].
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Tridib	She was blushng. It’s obviously not the right thing to do here.' No, no, [MASK] stammered. Thank you very much.. . . What are you staring at? my father snapped, waving his hands at the people who had gathered around us.
<name>John</name>	John	Malik	All riots are terrible, [MASK] said. But it must have been a local thing. Terrible or not, it’s hardly comparable to a war. But don’t v.ou remember? I said. Didn’t you read about it or hear about it?
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Tridib	What about you? said [MASK]. What did you think? I used to dream of him, she said softly. For years afterwards I would lie in bed and conjure up his face, complete with that absurd, stringy little beard of his.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Snipe	[MASK] has been digging that pit for the last two weeks in the back garden. This pit is intended to be the foundation of an Anderson air raid shelter, his second line of defence against the expected German bombs. It is a serious pit therefore.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Ila	It was not till the red sign of the Mornington Crescent tube station had flashed past my window like a palmed card that [MASK] sprang her surprise. Do you know who’s going to be waiting for us at the station when we get there? she said.
<name>James</name>	James	Robi	I looked up at the quiet, pretty houses on that tranquil road. I caught his eye and we both burst into laughter. Not exactly what you had expected, [MASK] said. I did not tell him then, but he was wrong.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Nick	[MASK] snorted. You wouldn’t say that if you knew what it’s like out there. It’s a bubble that’s going to hurst any day now. That’s why I got out while there was still something Jo_geioitui£_.
<name>Wolfe</name>	Wolfe	Tridib	This condition was known to us as [MASK]’s Gastric. Once every few months or so we would answer the doorbell and find him leaning against the wall, his legs tightly crossed, the sweat starting from his forehead.
<name>Tridib</name>	Tridib	Malik	We wouldn’t even remember it if the Indian army hadn’t taken such a beating. It didn’t mean a thing to most people. All right, said [MASK], smiling. You tell us then—what was more important than the ’62 war?
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	May	So, when he walked up to me, flicking his straw-coloured hair back, and said: How nice to meet you, I’ve heard so much about you from my mother and [MASK] and everyone. . . . What could I say?
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Tridib	She tried to think about why she’d been curious, tried really hard, but it eluded her—she didn’t know what it was any longer, it had vanished. Instead, she found herself wondering about [MASK].
<name>uncle</name>	uncle	Jethamoshai	Anyway, we were talking about this and that, catching up—it’s the first time I’ve met her in years— and suddenly she slaps my hand and says: Do von know that yourjrousin.^Qne of your [MASK]’s sons, is living right here inJCahatttfrwkh hiTFarmT^fyo’me^efe’iri Garialfl’m not mistaken?
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	May	I will go, I shouted at him. You can’t go without me. Then [MASK] drew me into her arms, hugged me, and said: Of course you’ll come with us. I wouldn’t dream of going without you.
<name>John</name>	John	Khalil	Then he went up to the old man and said something into his ear. The old man turned his head away and shook his hands wildly in the air. But [MASK] argued with him for a while and at last he nodded and stretched out his arms.
<name>Ravi</name>	Ravi	Robi	He started the car and they set off slowly down the empty road with^he rickshaw following close behind. It was [MASK] who saw them first, immediately after they turned the first corner, the corner my grandmother remembered so well, where the boys used to play football on a patch of grass.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ila	All right, said [MASK], let’s go under it. Under it? Aghast, I tugged at the back of her smock and asked her what kind of game we could possibly play under it. Come on, she said; she was already on her knees crawling through the dust.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mayadebi	[MASK] linked arms with <2. her as they slowly walked across the yard. They both had tears running down their cheeks when they stopped at tHelJoor. ""We^re^jiTigTgtihdrbut at last about the upside-down house, v ^y^^rf ^aid my grandmother.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	May	so he had it put away here. And so, it was forgotten until you rediscovered it. [MASK] walked around it, frowning. I wonder how much he paid for it, she said, running her thumb along the grain of the dark, heavy wood.
<name>I've</name>	I've	J’ve	[MASK] never been able to rid myself of that dream, he said. F.ver since it first happened. When I was a child 1 used to pray that it would go away: if it had, there would havgheen nothing else really to remind me of that day.
<name>Albertine</name>	Albertine	Montu	I did not go out to our balcony that evening; I didn’t see how 1 could begin to explain to [MASK] that my grandmother had tied up her head because she was afraid of going bald. Fortunately she did not persist with that treatment for very long.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Malik	But after half an hour we still hadn’t found anything on my remembered riots. [MASK] was bored now. He stole a look at his watch and gave me a friendly pat on my shoulder. I’ve got to get back home now, he said.
<name>She</name>	She	Robi	Quickly now madam, the driver said, biting his lip. Quickly now. [MASK] had expected to see a crowd waiting for them, but the road was empty, deserted, and all the shops were shut. There’s no trouble here, he said to the driver.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Tridib	It embarrassed [MASK] to admit that he hadn’t heard of so many things, all on the same evening, but he was curious, so in the end, he abandoned his pride and said: What is a trade union?
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Robi	The sight of the cars inching along the road below seemed to act on her like a tonic. Come on, she said, tugging at my hand; let’s go out somewhere. We can’t lie about all day like this. Besides [MASK]’s leaving tomorrow.
<name>Ravi</name>	Ravi	Robi	[MASK] scanned the streets as they drove through them, watching alertly for signs of‘trouble’. But he was soon disappointed: at the New Market, for instance, all the shops were open and the streets were crowded, as usual, with people and cycle- rickshaws and cars.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Nick	Could you give us some idea. .. ? All business in English here, he snapped at me. And I can’t tell you anything until you let me knowhow many of you are travelling. You’re not being very friendly, [MASK] said. Are you now?
<name>Arif</name>	Arif	Nick	As for me, I knew I would not have dared. [MASK] was bored by our pointless argument. Come on, he said. Let’s go ancfhave a look at that house. He led us across the road and pushed open the greasy glass doors of the Taj Travel Agency.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Tridib	The truth was that in his own way, [MASK] was something of a recluse: even as a child I could tell thaTfiewas happiest in that T5bokTtned room of his, right at the top of their old family house.
<name>Anita</name>	Anita	Ila	I burrowed into my grandmother’s sari suddenly terrified at the thought of meeting her again. Why, you silly boy, my grandmother said. There she is, there’s [MASK]; weren’t you waiting for her?
<name>11a</name>	11a	Nick	I don’t like this place, 11a said loftily. I’m going anyway. We got up together and walked to the door while the man glared at our backs. Bet he’s running a sweat-shop upstairs, [MASK] whispered loudly as we were going out.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Lizzie	Kill it? [MASK] cried, once she had decoded this. But why to kilfjtFTHey keep snakes awav. ~$he ran downstairs and a few minutes later they saw her go into the garden with an armful of cabbage stalks and vegetable peei.
<name>He</name>	He	Ila	But the man behind the bar wantedToTmovv what 1 wotlM'Rke, and by the time the warm, tawny beer had trickled out of the brass spigot and filled my glass, [MASK] had already seen me. Where have you been?
