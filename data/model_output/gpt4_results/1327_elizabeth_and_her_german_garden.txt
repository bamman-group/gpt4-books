<name>der</name>	der	Satan	And he finished the verse with unruffled decorum-- “Will [MASK] mich verschlingen, So lass die Engel singen Hallelujah!” We never had another difference. Up to then he had been my willing slave, and after that I was his.
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Minora	[MASK] was plainly startled. “But what do you do if you are ill?” she asked. “Oh, we are never ill,” said I; “the very knowledge that there would be no one to cure us seems to keep us healthy.”
<name>Warrington</name>	Warrington	Irais	The explanation of the principles of bimetallism produce, as a rule, a contrary effect.” “Why, she hadn’t been listening,” cried [MASK], “and your simple star had been making a fine goose of himself the whole evening.
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Minora	“Yes, but I am afraid I am rather out of practice.” I said no more. I know what that sort of playing is. When we were lighting our bedroom candles [MASK] began suddenly to speak in an unknown tongue. We stared.
<name>He</name>	He	Irais	“Then I will. It is really bad for her art to be neglected like this. She has been here an unconscionable time,--it must be nearly three weeks.” “Yes, she came the same day you did,” I said pleasantly. [MASK] was silent.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Minora	echoed [MASK], greatly disgusted by such vulgarity. “I’m afraid I can’t help you,” I said, as she continued to choke and splutter; “we are all in the same case, and I don’t know how to alter it.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Irais	And they are different; I can’t tell in what way, but they certainly are; and I think if I steadily describe them from the materials I have collected the last three days, I may perhaps hit on the points of difference.” “Why bother about points of difference?” asked [MASK].
<name>Maréchal</name>	Maréchal	Safrano	The purple ones are the most charming and go well with every rose, but I have white ones with Laurette Messimy, and yellow ones with [MASK], and a new red sort in the big centre bed of red roses.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Dwesses	“Why, the same as all the other angels, I suppose.” “[MASK]?” She began to laugh, looking at me sideways as though she suspected me of making jokes. “What a funny Mummy!” she said, evidently much amused.
<name>Wraysbury</name>	Wraysbury	Wrath	The wife of one of the servants had just produced a boy, the first after a series of five daughters, and at dinner we drank the health of all parties concerned, the Man of [MASK] making the happy father drink a glass off at one gulp, his heels well together in military fashion.
<name>Adrian</name>	Adrian	Irais	I hope it has been made evident in these pages how superior [MASK] and myself are to the ordinary weaknesses of mankind; if any further proof were needed, it is furnished by the fact that we both, in defiance of tradition, scorn this celebration of birthday rites.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Irais	At this I got up, and [MASK] followed my example. “Your cynicism is disgusting,” I said icily. “You two are always exceptions to anything I may say,” he said, smiling amiably.
<name>Margery</name>	Margery	Irais	It was a hoar-frost day, and the forest was an enchanted forest leading into fairyland, and though [MASK] and I have been there often before, and always thought it beautiful, yet yesterday we stood under the final arch of frosted trees, struck silent by the sheer loveliness of the place.
<name>Maréchal</name>	Maréchal	Safrano	I have ordered [MASK] tea-roses to put in their place, as they all come out next month and are to be grouped in the grass; and the semicircle being immediately under the windows, besides having the best position in the place, must be reserved solely for my choicest treasures.
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Minora	“I should write some little thing, bringing in the usual parts of the picture, such as knees and toes, and make it mildly pathetic.” “But it is by no means an easy thing for me to do,” said [MASK] plaintively; “I have so little experience of children.”
<name>whisky</name>	whisky	Glubwein	The Man of Wrath, usually so silent, makes up for it from time to time by holding forth at unnecessary length. He took up his stand now with his back to the fire, and a glass of [MASK] in his hand.
<name>Mrs. Slade</name>	Mrs. Slade	Minora	[MASK] put on her eye-glasses and read aloud: “When my baby shuts her eyes and sings her hymns at bed-time my stale and battered soul is filled with awe. All sorts of vague memories crowd into my mind--memories of my own mother and myself--how many years
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Minora	And then I take them. But on a brilliant winter’s day my conscience is as clear as the frosty air itself, and yesterday morning we started off in the gayest of spirits, even [MASK] being disposed to laugh immoderately on the least provocation.
<name>Nurse</name>	Nurse	Anna	Just then I saw the nurse coming out with the tea-tray. “I’ll tell you the rest another time,” I said, putting her off my knee, greatly relieved; “you must all go to [MASK] now and have tea.”
<name>Mrs. Gamp</name>	Mrs. Gamp	Minora	I pondered long over this. Was it a parting hit, intended as revenge for our having laughed at her? Was she personally interested in the sale of embrocation? Or was it merely [MASK]’s idea of a graceful return for my hospitality?
<name>Roses</name>	Roses	Pansies	I feel really grateful to any flower that is sturdy and willing enough to flourish here. [MASK] seem to like the place and so do sweet-peas; pinks don’t, and after much coaxing gave hardly any flowers last summer.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Minora	“Oh, my dear, how can I tell? Lovers, I suppose, or else they think they are clever, and then they talk rubbish.” “Well, of course, [MASK] thinks she is clever.” “I suppose she does.
<name>Providence</name>	Providence	Providence	With this room to live in, I can look forward with perfect equanimity to being snowed up for any time [MASK] thinks proper; and to go into the garden in its snowed-up state is like going into a bath of purity.
<name>Yulia</name>	Yulia	Irais	“And as for politics,” he said, “I have never heard them mentioned among women.” “Children and idiots are not interested in such things,” I said. “And we are much too frightened of being put in prison,” said [MASK].
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Irais	“You two are always exceptions to anything I may say,” he said, smiling amiably. He stooped and kissed [MASK]’s hand. She is inordinately vain of her hands, and says her husband married her for their sake, which I can quite believe.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Irais	“But he’s such an old dear,” I said. “Yes, yes, no doubt,” she replied tastily; “but there are wakeful old dears to be had, and on a box they are preferable.” [MASK] laughed.
<name>Wrack</name>	Wrack	Wrath	When I expressed my horror at the poor creatures working immediately afterwards as though nothing had happened, the Man of [MASK] informed me that they did not suffer because they had never worn corsets, nor had their mothers and grandmothers.
<name>Phyllis</name>	Phyllis	Peter	When they have sung it once, they clear their throats a little, and hesitate, and then do it again, and it is the prettiest little song in the world. How could I indulge my passion for these drives with their pauses without [MASK]?
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Adam	Nearly all the roses were a success, in spite of the sandy soil, except the tea-rose [MASK], which was covered with buds ready to open, when they suddenly turned brown and died, and three standard Dr. Grills which stood in a row and simply sulked.
<name>Conrad</name>	Conrad	Elizabeth	“Don’t be foolish, [MASK],” murmured my soul in rather a faint voice, “go in, and make sure.” “But I don’t like going in and making sure,” I replied.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Irais	“What nonsense,” said I; “we have no ghosts here. Good-night. If you want anything, mind you ring.” “And if you see anything curious in that room,” called [MASK] from her bedroom door, “mind you jot it down.”
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Minora	Amongst those toes were those of the Man of Wrath, who sat peaceably reading a book and smoking. [MASK] volunteered to show us the steps, and as we still did not move, danced solitary behind our chairs.
<name>Olga</name>	Olga	Irais	When [MASK] first saw it she laughed till she cried, and at once commissioned her to paint hers, so that she may take it away with her and give it to her husband on his birthday, which happens to be early in February.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Minora	“Is it true,” appealed [MASK] to the Man of Wrath, busy with his lemons in the background, “that your law classes women with children and idiots?” “Certainly,” he answered promptly, “and a very proper classification, too.”
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Irais	Nobody is naughty unless they like being naughty; and nobody ever really repents unless they are afraid they are going to be found out.” “By ‘nobody’ of course you mean women, said [MASK]. “Naturally; the terms are synonymous.
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Minora	“I’m afraid I can’t help you,” I said, as she continued to choke and splutter; “we are all in the same case, and I don’t know how to alter it.” “There are such things as forks, I suppose,” snapped [MASK].
<name>Priscilla</name>	Priscilla	Minora	cried [MASK] eagerly, her pencil in mid-air and her brain clutching at the elusive recollection, “sage and,--why,--yes,--no,--yes, of course--oh,” disappointedly, “but that’s vulgar--I can’t put it in.” “What is vulgar?”
<name>Germans</name>	Germans	Germans	He pervaded our family life till my sixth year, and saw to it that we all behaved ourselves, and then he died, and we were glad that he should be in heaven. He was a good German (and when [MASK] are good they are very
<name>Noah</name>	Noah	Noah	“Another! another!” she shrieked, jumping up and down with redoubled energy, all her silvery curls flying. I began about [MASK] and the flood. “Did it rain so badly?” she asked with a face of the deepest concern and interest.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Irais	[MASK] skates beautifully: modesty is the only obstacle to my saying the same of myself; but I may remark that all Germans skate well, for the simple reason that every year of their lives, for three or four months, they may do it as much as they like.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Minora	“But,” said [MASK], bewildered at the way her illusions were being knocked about, “the sick-room is surely the very place of all others in which a woman’s gentleness and tact are most valuable.” “Gentleness and tact?” repeated the Man of Wrath.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Mummy	“I think,” said I, gravely, “you had better go and play with the other babies.” She did not answer, and sat still a moment watching the clouds. I began writing again. “[MASK],” she said presently.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Irais	“I hope you are not going to be ill,” said [MASK] with great concern, “because there is only a cow-doctor to be had here, and though he means well, I believe he is rather rough.”
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Minora	“May I ask you to come to tea?” I said to [MASK]. “And I should like to have the children a little while.” She got up very reluctantly, but I waited with the door open until she had gone in and the two babies had followed.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Minora	She got up and walked to the piano, and, sitting down, began, after a little wandering over the keys, to sing. “Do you play?” I asked [MASK]. “Yes, but I am afraid I am rather out of practice.”
<name>Lucia</name>	Lucia	Irais	He was a bimetallic star, and was giving her whole pamphletsful of information.” “She wanted to make up to him for some reason,” said [MASK], “and got him to explain his hobby to her, and he was silly enough to be taken in.
<name>Man</name>	Man	Man	“It is the Purest of Humane pleasures, it is the Greatest Refreshment to the Spirits of [MASK],” he would quote (for he read other things besides the Kreuzzeitung), looking round with satisfaction on reaching this fragrant haven after a hot day in the fields.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Irais	The pretty ones would rather see men their slaves than their equals.” “You know,” said [MASK], frowning, “that I consider myself strong-minded.” “And never rise till lunch-time?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Minora	“Do you never go there?” asked [MASK], jerking her head in the direction of the house. “Sometimes. She is a very busy woman, and I should feel I was in the way if I went often.”
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Elizabeth	I nodded. “And you would sit on one of the four little podgy, buttony, tasselly red chairs that are ranged on the other side of the table facing the sofa. They are red, [MASK]?” Again I nodded.
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Minora	[MASK] was silent. She feels, I am sure, that she has got into a part of the world peopled solely by barbarians, and that the only civilised creature besides herself has departed and left her at our mercy. Whatever her reflections may be her symptoms are visibly abating.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Minora	She sat down at the writing-table, took up an old letter, and scribbled for about five minutes. “There,” she said, throwing it to [MASK], “you may have it--pink toes and all complete.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Irais	We stood and looked at each other with awestruck faces. “How dreadful!” murmured [MASK]. “I never met a young girl who did that before.” “She says this place is full of copy.” “Full of what?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Minora	Sometimes. She is a very busy woman, and I should feel I was in the way if I went often.” “It would be interesting to see another North German interior,” said [MASK]; “and I should be obliged if you would take me.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Minora	It is the most difficult thing in the world to eat sandwiches with immense fur and woollen gloves on, and I think we ate almost as much fur as anything, and choked exceedingly during the process. [MASK] was angry at this, and at last pulled off her glove, but quickly put it on again.
<name>Phellion</name>	Phellion	Irais	“You are telling us in the most unvarnished manner that we are idiots,” said [MASK]. “Idiots? No, no, by no means. But children,--nice little agreeable children. I very much like to hear you talk together.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	I read the letter aloud for the benefit of the Man of Wrath, who was eating Spickgans, a delicacy much sought after in these parts. “Do, my dear [MASK],” wrote my friend, “take some notice of the poor thing.
<name>Matilda</name>	Matilda	Bertha	Do you know my Aunt [MASK]? she, in particular, spends her time propounding obscure questions for my solution. I get so tired and worried trying to guess the answers, which are always truths supposed to be good for me to hear.
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Irais	“What would become of poetry if women became so sensible that they turned a deaf ear to the poetic platitudes of love? That love does indulge in platitudes I suppose you will admit.” He looked at [MASK]. “Yes, they all say exactly the same thing,” she acknowledged.
<name>Olga</name>	Olga	Irais	She has a wonderfully good profile, which is irritating. The wind, however, is tempered to the shorn lamb by her eyes being set too closely together. [MASK] lit a cigarette, and leaning back in her chair, contemplated her critically beneath her long eyelashes.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Mummy	“Are you twelve, [MASK]?” she asked. The gardener is leaving on the first of April, and I am trying to find another. It is grievous changing so often--in two years I shall have had three--because at each change a great part of my plants and plans necessarily suffers.
<name>John</name>	John	Irais	“Did you know,” said [MASK], seeing the movement, “that it is the custom here to kiss women’s hands?” “But only married women’s,” I added, not desiring her to feel out of it, “never young girls’.”
<name>saint</name>	saint	Saints	Nearly a week was lost waiting, to the despair of all in authority. Nor will any persuasions induce them to do anything on [MASK]’ days, and there surely never was a church so full of them as the Russian Church.
<name>She</name>	She	Minora	“No. 12.” “Oh!--do you believe in ghosts?” [MASK] turned pale. “What nonsense,” said I; “we have no ghosts here. Good-night. If you want anything, mind you ring.”
<name>Fate</name>	Fate	Fate	Quite regularly, if I look forward to anything, [MASK] steps in and decrees otherwise; I don’t know why it should, but it does. I had not even invited these good ladies--like greatness on the modest, they were thrust upon me.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Minora	[MASK] has seen so much of the babies that, after vainly trying to get out of their way for several days, she thought it better to resign herself, and make the best of it by regarding them as copy, and using them to fill a chapter in her book.
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Irais	She writes everything with a typewriter, even her private letters. “Don’t forget to put in something about a mother’s knee,” said [MASK]; “you can’t write effectively about children without that.”
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Irais	They would have no illusions, and a woman without illusions is the dreariest and most difficult thing to manage possible.” “Thing?” protested [MASK]. The Man of Wrath, usually so silent, makes up for it from time to time by holding forth at unnecessary length.
<name>Olga</name>	Olga	Irais	Parents, priests, and governesses would be in the situation of a stout lady who never has a quiet moment in which she can take off her corsets.” “My dear, what a firebrand!” whispered [MASK]. I got up and went in.
<name>Thorndyke</name>	Thorndyke	Minora	went on [MASK]. “Why, to clean the linen, I suppose.” “Yes, yes, but why only at such long intervals?” “It is an outward and visible sign of vast possessions in the shape of linen.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Irais	You yourself are sillier far, Prattling, bimetallic star!” “No doubt she had understood very little,” said the Man of Wrath, taking no notice of this effusion. “And no doubt the gentleman hadn’t understood much either.” [MASK] was plainly irritated.
<name>Fate</name>	Fate	Fate	I have two visitors staying with me, though I have done nothing to provoke such an infliction, and had been looking forward to a happy little Christmas alone with the Man of Wrath and the babies. [MASK] decreed otherwise.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Irais	“You can’t quote that without its context, you know.” “But I wasn’t going to,” said [MASK] meekly; “I only paused to breathe. I must breathe, or perhaps I might die.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Irais	“You must have belonged to a particularly nice set,” remarked [MASK]. “And as for politics,” he said, “I have never heard them mentioned among women.” “Children and idiots are not interested in such things,” I said.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Minora	Certainly not. Yet I most surely am. “It wants the music, of course,” observed [MASK] breathlessly, darting in and out between the chairs, apparently addressing me, but glancing at the Man of Wrath. No answer from anybody.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Irais	“Well, do you know, I rather think that is a good touch,” she replied; “it will make people really think a man wrote the book. You know I am going to take a man’s name.” “That is precisely what I imagined,” said [MASK].
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Irais	“Oh, but isn’t there an English song,” said [MASK], twisting round her neck as she preceded us upstairs, “‘’Tis folly to remember, ‘tis wisdom to forget’?” “You are not nervous sleeping alone, I hope,” I said hastily.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Irais	“Did you know that the morals of the German public are in such a shaky condition that a glimpse of that sort would be fatal to them?” “But I don’t see how a stocking--” “With stripes round it,” said [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Irais	She has once or twice anxiously inquired whether [MASK] is sure she does not object to sleeping alone. “If you are at all nervous, I will come and keep you company,” she said; “I don’t mind at all, I assure you.”
<name>Henrietta</name>	Henrietta	Minora	[MASK]’s are bony, with chilly-looking knuckles, ignored nails, and too much wrist. I feel very well disposed towards her when my eye falls on them. She put one forward now, evidently thinking it would be kissed too.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Minora	“You look so pale,” she said; “are you not well?” [MASK] raised her eyes heavily, with the patient air of one who likes to be thought a sufferer. “I have a slight headache,” she replied gently.
<name>Georgie</name>	Georgie	Minora	“But papa doesn’t.” “When you are as old as papa you can do as you like.” Which was embellished only yesterday by [MASK] adding impressively, “And only think how strange it would look if everybody held their glasses so.”
<name>Both</name>	Both	Irais	You are older, but not wiser,--really not so wise, for with years you lose the common sense you had as children. Have you ever heard a group of women talking reasonably together?” “Yes--we do!” [MASK] and I cried in a breath.
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Minora	Oh, you sweet innocent--pardon my familiarity, but such ignorance of country-life customs is very touching in one who is writing a book about them.” “Oh, I have no doubt I am very ignorant,” said [MASK] loftily.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Minora	Out came the note-book. “The law expressly forbids the attendance at such meetings of women, children, and idiots.” “Children and idiots--I understand that,” said [MASK]; “but women--and classed with children and idiots?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Irais	The flame of my affection for [MASK] burns very brightly on the day of her arrival; besides, this time I have prudently provided against her sinning with the salt-cellars by ordering them to be handed round like vegetable dishes.
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Minora	“Who could murmur pretty speeches on the beauty of a common sacrifice, if the listener’s want of imagination was such as to enable her only to distinguish one victim in the picture, and that one herself?” [MASK] took that down word for word,--much good may it do her.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Minora	“How very curious!” said [MASK], when she had finished. “That is exactly what I was going to say.” “Oh, then I have saved you the trouble of putting it together; you can copy that if you like.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Irais	“Oh come, put away that tiresome old book,” she went on gaily, as he did not move; “I am certain it is only some dry agricultural work that you just nod over. Dancing is much better for you.” [MASK] and I looked at one another quite frightened.
<name>Mother</name>	Mother	Elizabeth	“But we should be much happier without her,” she grumbled. “Weren’t we happy enough in the summer, [MASK]--just you and I?” “Yes, indeed we were,” I answered heartily, putting my arms round her.
<name>Wrath</name>	Wrath	Wrath	This went on for three days, and then she settled down to write the result with the Man of [MASK]’s typewriter, borrowed whenever her notes for any chapter have reached the state of ripeness necessary for the process she describes as “throwing into form.”
<name>Stiva</name>	Stiva	Irais	“But I can’t fall upon her suddenly with a strange girl,” I protested; “and we are not at all on such intimate terms as to justify my taking all my visitors to see her.” “What do you want to see another interior for?” asked [MASK].
<name>Mercy</name>	Mercy	Mercy	They all three speak a wonderful mixture of German and English, adulterating the purity of their native tongue by putting in English words in the middle of a German sentence. It always reminds me of Justice tempered by [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Irais	“And never rise till lunch-time?” [MASK] blushed. Although I don’t approve of such conduct, it is very convenient in more ways than one; I get through my housekeeping undisturbed, and whenever she is disposed to lecture me, I begin about this habit of hers.
<name>Nurse</name>	Nurse	Elizabeth	“I can tell you what it is like; and if you went nobody would speak to you, and if you were to ask questions, and began to take notes, the good lady would stare at you in the frankest amazement, and think [MASK] had brought a young lunatic out for an airing.
<name>Priscilla</name>	Priscilla	Minora	[MASK] let her nose very carefully out of its wrappings, took a mouthful, and covered it up quickly again. She was nervous lest it should be frost-nipped, and truth compels me to add that her nose is not a bad nose, and might even be pretty on anybody else;
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Irais	It seems that the place interests people, and that there is a sort of novelty in staying in such a deserted corner of the world, for they were in a perpetual state of mild amusement at being here at all. [MASK] is the only one left.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Minora	It is dark now nearly in the forest, and we shall have the loveliest moonlight drive back.” “But it is surely very dangerous to let a man who goes to sleep drive you,” said [MASK] apprehensively. “But he’s such an old dear,” I said.
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Irais	“To hear you talk,” said [MASK], “no one would ever imagine that you dream away your days in a garden with a book, and that you never in your life seized anything by the scruff of its neck. And what is scruff?
<name>Satan</name>	Satan	Satan	“Oh, yes, oh, yes,” I promised eagerly, and went in filled with holy fire. The shortness of my legs, hanging helplessly for two hours midway between the seat and the floor, was the weapon chosen by [MASK] for my destruction.
