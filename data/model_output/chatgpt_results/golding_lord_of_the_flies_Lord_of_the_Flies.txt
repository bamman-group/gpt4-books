<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Ralph	“Perhaps that’s what the beast is—a ghost.” The assembly was shaken as by a wind. “There’s too much talking out of turn,” [MASK] said, “because we can’t have proper assemblies if you don’t stick to the rules.”
<name>Kotick</name>	Kotick	Ralph	Cautiously, his stick trailing behind him, [MASK] wormed between the rising stems. When he reached the middle of the mat he lay and listened. The fire was a big one and the drum-roll that he had thought was left so far behind was nearer.
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Ralph	The forests re-echoed; and birds lifted, crying out of the treetops, as on that first morning ages ago. Both ways the beach was deserted. Some littluns came from the shelters. [MASK] sat down on the polished trunk and the three others stood before him.
<name>Smoky</name>	Smoky	Ralph	High up among the bulging clouds thunder went off like a gun. “We’re going to get buckets of rain.” “What about the fire?” [MASK] trotted into the forest and returned with a wide spray of green which he dumped on the fire.
<name>him</name>	him	Ralph	The teeth grinned, the empty sockets seemed to hold his gaze masterfully and without effort. What was it? The skull regarded [MASK] like one who knows all the answers and won’t tell. A sick fear and rage swept him.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Piggy	“[MASK]. What are we going to do?” “Just have to get on without ’em.” “But—the fire.” He frowned at the black and white mess in which lay the unburnt ends of branches. He tried to formulate.
<name>the twins</name>	the twins	Samneric	While he was eating, he heard fresh noises—cries of pain from [MASK], cries of panic, angry voices. What did it mean? Someone besides himself was in trouble, for at least one of the twins was catching it.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Ralph	[MASK]’s mouth watered. He meant to refuse meat, but his past diet of fruit and nuts, with an odd crab or fish, gave him too little resistance. He accepted a piece of halfraw meat and gnawed it like a wolf.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Roger	Behind him was [MASK], fighting to get close. The chant rose ritually, as at the last moment of a dance or a hunt. “Kill the pig! Cut his throat! Kill the pig! Bash him in!”
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Ralph	The twins nodded like one boy. “Yes, that’s right. Let’s go up there in the morning.” [MASK] looked out and saw the sea. “We’ve got to start the fire again.”
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Ralph	“Come on,” said [MASK]. “We’ve found out what we wanted to know.” They scrambled down a rock slope, dropped among flowers, and made their way under the trees. Here they paused and examined the bushes round them curiously.
<name>Piggy</name>	Piggy	Piggy	“How did your friend blow the conch?” “He kind of spat,” said [MASK]. “My auntie wouldn’t let me blow on account of my asthma. He said you blew from down here.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Ralph	“You can’t half swim well.” [MASK] paddled backwards down the slope, immersed his mouth, and blew a jet of water into the air. Then he lifted his chin and spoke. “I could swim when I was five.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jack	His voice was loud and savage, and struck them into silence. “There was a ship.” [MASK], faced at once with too many awful implications, ducked away from them. He laid a hand on the pig and drew his knife.
<name>Simon</name>	Simon	Samneric	Are you the only one left?” “There’s some littluns.” “They don’t count. No biguns?” “Oh—[MASK]. They’re collecting wood.” “Nobody else?” “Not that I know of.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Ralph	“Smashing.” The cause of their pleasure was not obvious. All three were hot, dirty, and exhausted. [MASK] was badly scratched. The creepers were as thick as their thighs and left little but tunnels for further penetration.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Piggy	A sound, half-laugh, half-jeer, rose among the seated boys. [MASK] ducked his head and went on hastily. “So let’s hear from that littlun who talked about a beast and perhaps we can show him how silly he is.”
<name>George</name>	George	Sam	“I’ll lie up close; in that thicket down there,” he whispered, “so keep them away from it. They’ll never think to look so close—” The footsteps were still some distance away. “[MASK]—I’m going to be all right, aren’t I?”
<name>Big Bill</name>	Big Bill	Ralph	[MASK] shouted. “More wood! All of you get more wood!” Life became a race with the fire and the boys scattered through the upper forest. To keep a clean flag of flame flying on the mountain was the immediate end and no one looked further.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Eric	“I got my knee up,” said [MASK] with simple pride, “and I hit him with it in the pills. You should have heard him holler! He won’t come back in a hurry either. So we didn’t do too badly.”
<name>a tiger</name>	a tiger	Bill	But the hunters had only sneaked into the fringes of the greenery, retrieving spears perhaps, and then had rushed back to the sunny rock as if terrified of the darkness under the leaves. He had even glimpsed one of them, striped brown, black, and red, and had judged that it was [MASK].
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Henry	The litduns played here, if not happily at least with absorbed attention; and often as many as three of them would play the same game together. Three were playing here now. [MASK] was the biggest of them.
<name>George</name>	George	Simon	[MASK] shook his head violently till the coarse black hair flew backwards and forwards across his face. “No, I’m not. I just think you’ll get back all right." For a moment nothing more was said. And then they suddenly smiled at each other.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jack	“Through here—” “But he’d do us!” “Through here, I said—” The boar was floundering away from them. They found another pig-run parallel to the first and [MASK] raced away.
<name>Harris</name>	Harris	Piggy	[MASK] was a bore; his fat, his ass-mar, and his matter-of-fact ideas were dull, but there was always a little pleasure to be got out of pulling his leg, even if one did it by accident.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Ralph	In the stern-sheets another rating held a sub-machine gun. The ululation faltered and died away. The officer looked at [MASK] doubtfully for a moment, then took his hand away from the butt of the revolver.
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Ralph	He says will it come back tonight?” “But there isn’t a beastie!” There was no laughter at all now' and more grave w'atch-ing. [MASK] pushed both hands through his hair and looked at the little boy in mixed amusement and exasperation.
<name>them</name>	them	Samneric	“Trouble is, we haven’t got enough people for a fire. You got to treat [MASK] as one turn. They do everything together—” “Of course.” “Well, that isn’t fair. Don’t you see?
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Jack	“There was a ship. Out there. You said you’d keep the fir.e going and you let it out!” He took a step toward [MASK], who turned and faced him. “They might have seen us. We might have gone home—”
<name>Simon</name>	Simon	Piggy	The fire’s the most important thing on the island, because, because—” He paused again and the silence became full of doubt and wonder. [MASK] whispered urgently. “Rescue.” “Oh yes. Without the fire we can’t be rescued.
<name>Simon</name>	Simon	Piggy	Certainly no one could attack him here—and moreover he had a stroke of luck. The great rock that had killed [MASK] had bounded into this thicket and bounced there, right in the center, making a smashed space a few feet in extent each way.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Eric	“We’ve got to give signals like this.” [MASK] raised his head and achieved a faint ululation by beating on his open mouth. Then he glanced behind him nervously. “Like that—” “—only louder, of course.”
<name>they</name>	they	Ralph	, But for the sense of something watching them, [MASK] would have shouted at him. “Stay here? And be cramped into this bit of the island, always on the lookout? How should we get our food? And what about the fire?”
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Jack	He noticed that he still held the knife aloft and brought his arm down, replacing the blade in the sheath. Then they all three laughed ashamedly and began to climb back to the track. “I was choosing a place,” said [MASK].
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Ralph	“You gimme the conch back!” [MASK] pushed between them and got a thump on the chest. He wrestled the conch from someone and sat down breathlessly. “There’s too much talk about ghosts. We ought to have left all this for daylight.”
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Ralph	The meeting setded down again. “So you see,” said [MASK], “we need hunters to get us meat. And another thing.” He lifted the shell on his knees and looked round the sunslashed faces. “There aren’t any grownups.
<name>Simon</name>	Simon	Ralph	As the echoes died away so did the laughter, and there was silence. Within the diamond haze of the beach something dark was fumbling along. [MASK] saw it first, and watched till the intentness of his gaze drew all eyes that way.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jack	So did you.” “Call me a coward then.” [MASK] turned to the hunters. “He’s not a hunter. He’d never have got us meat. He isn’t a prefect and we don’t know anything about him.
<name>Rainsford</name>	Rainsford	Ralph	“Some frog. There was a noise too. A kind of ‘plop’ noise. Then the thing bulged.” [MASK] surprised himself, not so much by the quality of his voice, which was even, but by the bravado of its intention.
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Piggy	“Don’t be silly,” he said. And then he added quickly, “Let’s go.” He held out the conch to [MASK] who flushed, this time with pride. “You must carry it.”
<name>Piggy</name>	Piggy	Piggy	There was silence, except for the multitudinous murmur of the bees. At last [MASK] spoke, kindly. “’Course we have. ’Cos the smoke’s a signal and we can’t be rescued if we don’t have smoke.” “I knew that!”
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Jack	As he did so, he heard [MASK]’s voice from the top. “Heave! Heave! Heave!” The red rock that he could see at the top of the cliff vanished like a curtain, and he could see figures and blue sky.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jack	I’m talking about the beast. Be frightened if you like. But as for the beast—” [MASK] paused, cradling the conch, and turned to his hunters with their dirty black caps. “Am I a hunter or am I not?”
<name>Simon</name>	Simon	Eric	The flames, busy about the tent, drew their eyes back again. [MASK] watched the scurrying woodlice that were so frantically unable to avoid the flames, and thought of the first fire—just down there, on the steeper side of the mountain, where now was complete darkness.
<name>the bushes</name>	the bushes	Ralph	He smeared the sweat from his cheeks and quickly adjusted the spectacles on his nose. “Them fruit.” He glanced round the scar. “Them fruit,” he said, “I expect— He put on his glasses, waded away from [MASK], and crouched down among the tangled foliage.
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Piggy	[MASK] whispered. “And the fire.” “Oh yes. Then about the fire. I say this again. I’ve been saying it ever since we dropped in.” He held out his spear and pointed at the savages.
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Ralph	It’s time some people knew they’ve got to keep quiet and leave deciding things to the rest of us.” [MASK] could no longer ignore his speech. The blood was hot in his cheeks. “You haven’t got the conch,” he said.
<name>Piggy</name>	Piggy	Piggy	On the sand, even. We’d make smoke just the same.” “That’s right!” “Smoke!” “By the bathing pool!” The boys began to babble. Only [MASK] could have the intellectual daring to suggest moving the fire from the mountain.
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Ralph	A flame, seemingly detached, swung like an acrobat and licked up the palm heads on the platform. The sky was black. The officer grinned cheerfully at [MASK]. “We saw your smoke. What have you been doing? Having a war or something?”
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Wacco	Echoes and birds flew, white and pink dust floated, the forest further down shook as with the passage of an enraged monster: and then the island was still. “[MASK]!” “Like a bomb!” “Whee-aa-oo!”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Simon	What is it this time?” A half-sound of jeering ran round the circle and [MASK] shrank from it. “I thought there might be something to do. Something we—” Again the pressure of the assembly took his voice away.
<name>Simon</name>	Simon	Ralph	“If it really is an island—” “What’s that?” [MASK] had stopped smiling and was pointing into the lagoon. Something creamy lay among the ferny weeds. “A stone.” “No. A shell.”
<name>Conan</name>	Conan	Ralph	[MASK] said nothing. He led the way over the rocks, inspected a sort of half-cave that held nothing more terrible than a clutch of rotten eggs, and at last sat down, looking round him and tapping the rock with the butt of his spear.
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Ralph	[MASK] went on, abruptly. “But that’s littiuns’ talk. We’ll get that straight. So the last part, the bit we can all talk about, is kind of deciding on the fear.” The hair was creeping into his eyes again.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Henry	He abandoned the noiseless transparencies and pointed at the center of the spreading rings like a setter. This side and that the stones fell, and [MASK] turned obediently but always too late to see the stones in the air. At last he saw one and laughed, looking for the friend who was teasing him.
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Ralph	“There’s pigs,” he said. “There’s food; and bathing water in that little stream along there—and everything. Didn’t anyone find anything else?” He handed the conch back to [MASK] and sat down.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Ralph	The tide was coming in and there was only a narrow strip of firm beach between the water and the white, stumbling stuff near the palm terrace. [MASK] chose the firm strip as a path because he needed to think, and only here could he allow his feet to move without having to watch them.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Ralph	“If I pull logs, I get my asthma bad. I wish I didn’t, [MASK], but there it is.” The three boys went into the forest and fetched armfuls of rotten wood. Once more the smoke rose, yellow and thick.
<name>The Invisible Man</name>	The Invisible Man	Jack	“You don’t half look a mess.” [MASK] planned his new face. He made one cheek and one eye-socket white, then he rubbed red over the other half of his face and slashed a black bar of charcoal across from right ear to left jaw.
<name>Candy</name>	Candy	Piggy	He examined his bitten nail closely and watched the litde globe of blood that gathered where the quick was gnawed away. [MASK] went on speaking. “I seen them stealing off when we was gathering wood. They went that way. The same way as he went himself.”
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Samneric	“We’ll live on our own, the four of us—” “Four of us. We aren’t enough to keep the fire burning.” “We’ll try. See? I lit it.” [MASK] came dragging a great log out of the forest.
<name>Simon</name>	Simon	Ralph	For perhaps ten seconds they crouched like that while the flailing fire sent smoke and sparks and waves of inconstant light over the top of the mountain. Then as though they had but one terrified mind between them they scrambled away over the rocks and fled. [MASK] was dreaming.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Piggy	For a while there was the continual creak and rustle of leaves as they tried for comfort. “[MASK].” “Yeah?” “All right?” “S’pose so.” At length, save for an occasional rustle, the shelter was silent.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Jack	The droppings were warm. They lay piled among turned earth. They were olive green, smooth, and they steamed a little. [MASK] lifted his head and stared at the inscrutable masses of creeper that lay across the trail. Then he raised his spear and sneaked forward.
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Piggy	A litdun howled, creased and crimson, by the bathing pool and [MASK] stood on the platform, the white conch gripped in his hands. “Tonight we’re having a feast. We’ve killed a pig and we’ve got meat.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Ralph	He picked his way up the scar, passed the great rock where [MASK] had climbed on the first morning, then turned off to his right among the trees. He walked with an accustomed tread through the acres of fruit trees, where the least energetic could find an easy if unsatisfying meal.
<name>Piggy</name>	Piggy	Piggy	He spoke flatly. “I see.” The world, that understandable and lawful world, was slipping away. Once there was this and that; and now—and the ship had gone. The conch was snatched from his hands and [MASK]’s voice shrilled.
<name>Rainsford</name>	Rainsford	Ralph	[MASK] found he was able to measure the distance coldly and take aim. With the boar only five yards away, he flung the foolish wooden stick that he carried, saw it hit the great snout and hang there for a moment.
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Ralph	I tell you what. He hates you too, [MASK]—” “Me? Why me?” “I dunno. You got him over the fire; an’ you’re chief an’ he isn’t.” “But he’s, he’s.
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Ralph	“And then?” “I found a pig-run. It went for miles.” “So the pig-run must be somewhere in there.” [MASK] nodded. He pointed at the forest. Everybody agreed, sagely. “All right then.
<name>Rainsford</name>	Rainsford	Jack	[MASK] himself shrank at this cry with a hiss of indrawn breath, and for a minute became less a hunter than a furtive thing, ape-like among the tangle of trees. Then the trail, the frustration, claimed him again and he searched the ground avidly.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Ralph	[MASK] hit out; then he and what seemed like a dozen others were rolling over and over, hitting, biting, scratching. He was torn and jolted, found fingers in his mouth and bit them. A fist withdrew and came back like a piston, so that the whole shelter exploded into light.
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Ralph	At last the assembly was silent again. Someone spoke out of turn. “Maybe he means it’s some sort of ghost.” [MASK] lifted the conch and peered into the gloom. The lightest thing was the pale beach. Surely the littluns were nearer?
<name>Simon</name>	Simon	Murmur	[MASK]; and the grave nodding of heads. “He says the beastie came in the dark.” “Then he couldn’t see it!” Laughter and cheers. “Did you hear that? Says he saw the thing in the dark—” “He still says he saw the beastie.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Ralph	He’d never have got us meat. He isn’t a prefect and we don’t know anything about him. He just gives orders and expects people to obey for nothing. All this talk—” “All this talk!” shouted [MASK]. “Talk, talk!
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Ralph	There was a shout from beyond the thicket and then [MASK] was running with the swiftness of fear through the undergrowth. He came to a pig-run, followed it for perhaps a hundred yards, and then swerved off.
<name>Rainsford</name>	Rainsford	Stanley	“He came—disguised. He may come again even though we gave him the head of our kill to eat. So watch; and be careful.” [MASK] lifted his forearm off the rock and held up an interrogative finger. “Well?”
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Roger	The sun in the west was a drop of burning gold that slid nearer and nearer the sill of the world. All at once they were aware of the evening as the end of light and warmth. [MASK] took the conch and looked round at them gloomily.
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Jack	Until the grownups come to fetch us we’ll have fun.” [MASK] held out his hand for the conch. “There’s pigs,” he said. “There’s food; and bathing water in that little stream along there—and everything.
<name>Peter</name>	Peter	Piggy	And the small boys who had reached the top came sliding too till everyone but [MASK] was busy. Most of the wood was so rotten that when they pulled, it broke up into a shower of fragments and woodlice and decay; but some trunks came out in one piece.
<name>Steve</name>	Steve	Sam	Was it a good—” The air was heavy with unspoken knowledge. [MASK] twisted and the obscene word shot out of him. “—dance?” Memory of the dance that none of them had attended shook all four boys convulsively. “We left early.”
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Ralph	[MASK] went on. “We have lots of assemblies. Everybody enjoys speaking and being together. We decide things. But they don’t get done. We were going to have water brought from the stream and left in those coconut shells under fresh leaves.
<name>Ahab</name>	Ahab	Ralph	Every minute the water breathed round the death rock and flowered into a field of whiteness. [MASK] crawled until he found the ledge of the entry in his grasp. The lookouts were immediately above him and he could see the end of a spear projecting over the rock.
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Piggy	“There wasn’t any smoke. Only flame.” [MASK] had settled himself in a space between two rocks, and sat with the conch on his knees. “We haven’t made a fire,” he said, “what’s any use.
<name>Artemis</name>	Artemis	Ralph	At length the guard climbed down. The two that remained seemed nothing more than a dark extension of the rock. A star appeared behind them and was momentarily eclipsed by some movement. [MASK] edged forward, feeling his way over the uneven surface as though he were blind.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Simon	The clouds were sitting on the land; they squeezed, produced moment by moment this close, tormenting heat. Even the butterflies deserted the open space where the obscene thing grinned and dripped. [MASK] lowered his head, carefully keeping his eyes shut, then sheltered them with his hand.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Ralph	“You should have seen the blood!” The hunters were more silent now, but at this they buzzed again. [MASK] flung back his hair. One arm pointed at the empty horizon. His voice was loud and savage, and struck them into silence.
<name>Piggy</name>	Piggy	Ralph	There must have been some kids still in it.” He hesitated for a moment, then spoke again. “What’s your name?” “[MASK].” The fat boy waited to be asked his name in turn but this proffer of acquaintance was.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Ralph	Quietly. Go on.” The twins, holding tremulously to each other, dared the few yards to the next shelter and spread the dreadful news. [MASK] stood up and walked for the sake of dignity, though with his back pricking, to the platform.
<name>Ernest</name>	Ernest	Piggy	“You told ’em. After what I said.” His face-flushed, his mouth trembled. “After I said I didn’t want—” “What on earth are you talking about?” “About being called [MASK].
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Ralph	but I can hear.” The dispersed figures had come together on the sand and were a dense black mass that revolved. They were chanting something and littluns that had had enough were staggering away, howling. [MASK] raised the conch to his lips and then lowered it.
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Ralph	“We were together then—” The officer nodded helpfully. “I know. Jolly good show. Like the Coral Island.” [MASK] looked at him dumbly. For a moment he had a fleeting picture of the strange glamour that had once invested the beaches.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Sam	His throat was hurting him now though it had received no wound. “I came to see you two—” Words could not express the dull pain of these things. He fell silent, while the vivid stars were split and danced all ways. [MASK] shifted uneasily.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Ralph	[MASK] leaned on his arms and did not go. “I came to see you two.” His voice was thick. His throat was hurting him now though it had received no wound. “I came to see you two—” Words could not express the dull pain of these things.
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Jack	Can’t you see the mountain? There’s no signal showing. There may be a ship out there. Are you all off your rockers?” Mutinously, the boys fell silent or muttering. [MASK] led the way down the rock and across the bridge.
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Ralph	“Who’ll join my tribe?” “I will.” “Me.” “I will.” “I’ll blow the conch,” said [MASK] breathlessly, “and call an assembly.” “We shan’t hear it.”
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Piggy	“The trouble is: Are there ghosts, [MASK]? Or beasts?” “’Course there aren’t.” “Why not?” “’Cos things wouldn’t make sense. Houses an’ streets, an’—TV—they wouldn’t work.”
<name>Piggy</name>	Piggy	Jack	“I’ve got the conch.” [MASK] sat down, grumbling. “Then the last thing. This is what people can talk about.” He waited till the platform was very still. “Things are breaking up. I don’t understand why.
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Ralph	This palm trunk lay parallel to the beach, so that when [MASK] sat he faced the island but to the boys was a darkish figure against the shimmer of the lagoon. The two sides of the triangle of which the log was base were less evenly defined.
<name>Simon</name>	Simon	Simon	“I know that.” [MASK] discovered that he had spoken aloud. He opened his eyes quickly and there was the head grinning amusedly in the strange daylight, ignoring the flies, the spilled guts, even ignoring the indignity of being spiked on a stick.
