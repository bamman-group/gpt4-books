<name>the medic</name>	the medic	Canning	When [MASK] asked for how long, the medic shrugged. “Till he improves-or until it kills him,” and turned back to his plate. Apparently, the only effect of the turpentine was to induce violent vomiting.
<name>Pop</name>	Pop	Jesse	The noise from the camp waxed, and it seemed the guerrillas had indeed found [MASK]’s moonshine, or else come ready provisioned with their own. Under the cover of the loud voices and darkness, we crept forward to where we could see the guerrillas’ dispositions.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Canning	When she drew up with us, panting, she reached into her wild fuzz of hair and drew out a delicate, creamy-petaled flower. “ ’S for you, marse,” she said, suddenly shy, holding it out to [MASK]. “First blossom!”
<name>Nanny</name>	Nanny	Hannah	Instead, I sat up, relit the lamp, and mended hose till I heard [MASK], dear soul, long before dawn, readying a hot breakfast which I could barely eat. My eyes ached and stung as I tried to make a composed farewell.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	White	I set the paper carefully with [MASK]’s few effects and left the hospital. The cold air hit my face like a welcome slap, breaking me out of morbid reverie. I stretched my legs, feeling pleasure as the muscles once again answered to my will, and allowed myself the luxury of anticipation.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harris	[MASK] turned his fragment of foolscap over, his brow furrowed. “What the devil...” He straightened, his small face pulled into a fretwork of lines. It was clear that he grasped the whole. “This is a fine sight to come home to!
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Zeke	As I watched, I saw one of [MASK]’s sons, a tall lean youth of about nineteen or twenty, amble over to where she squatted and say something to her. She turned her face away and spat in the dirt.
<name>Zoya</name>	Zoya	Zannah	Just then I felt the bonds around me go suddenly tighter and then slack. I did not move my head but from the corner of my eye I saw [MASK], a saber in her hand, moving to cut the ropes of the other captives.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Canning	In the silent and piceous hour just before dawn, they advanced at a slow trot, fanning out through the slave quarters and into the yard that divided the gin house, the mill, and the buildings where [MASK] and I slept unaware.
<name>Pa</name>	Pa	Canning	There was a leather folder where [MASK] had told me he kept a small amount of cash. When I flipped it open, I saw that it also contained an ambrotype-a picture of a young, dark-haired girl about the same age as my Meg.
<name>the hog</name>	the hog	Zeke	“We come to the matter of [MASK].” “Yes,” I snapped, “and the poor man was in a most wretched—” He cut me off. “I suppose he told you he stole the hog to feed his children?”
<name>ledger</name>	ledger	Webster	That’s why she falls dead asleep as soon as ever she lays her head down.” I had trimmed and mended a goose quill and ruled up a sheet of foolscap, so we opened the [MASK]’s and set to work.
<name>you</name>	you	Aster	And I intend to convert you. I don’t suppose I might have the use of your horse tomorrow?” “If [MASK] can help you work a miracle, then by all means. But may I ask what you propose?”
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Jesse	Still I extracted not a word, and the others seemed uncomfortable, shifting restlessly about. Later, the man [MASK], who as well as being my most apt pupil was something of a natural leader among his own people, came up to me and asked for a word.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Grace	For her, the future means tomorrow, nothing more. She doesn’t look beyond. The girl might need ... that is ... it would be better if she had the means ...” [MASK], so astonishingly eloquent, for the first time seemed tongue-tied.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Grace	but three of us, and the other two left here a fortnight ago, during the battle for the island. “ “[MASK],” I said, standing and taking a step toward her. “Why do you not go, too?
<name>Mammy</name>	Mammy	Annie	[MASK] was stirring a batter as she talked, and her spoon slowed down in the mixture as she thought back on her past. A shy half-smile lit up her wide face. “I was a nursery maid when the young marse was born; my mama was the cook here dem days.
<name>Prometheus</name>	Prometheus	Prometheus	One man’s head was pillowed on the plinth that held the Bound [MASK], and his face had the same wracked expression as the carved countenance above him. No one, it seemed, had got across the river with a full kit.
<name>Pa’s</name>	Pa’s	Canning	I closed the wallet and stuffed it in the inner pocket of my blouse, where I kept the small silken pouch containing the hair of my dear ones. I tried to force my feet into [MASK]’s best boots, but my feet were many sizes larger than his and my attempt was futile.
<name>John</name>	John	Canning	I had become concerned about [MASK], who never ceased to drive himself as relentlessly as he drove his workers. He was drawn and spare, his limp growing more pronounced day by day, so that he now resorted to a whittled stick to assist his movements up and down the rows.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Jo	[MASK] never could stitch an even hem; her mind was always wandering off to the plot of her latest story, so that her sheets and kerchiefs had a kind of meandering scallop to their edges. I had often teased her about her rococo needlework.
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Hannah	We laughed, and embraced, and as so often happened, the ardor of her anger turned to a more welcome sort of ardor, and we had to make our way privily back to the house so that [MASK] and the girls would not see our disarray.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Zannah	“You are the only one who got away?” She nodded, her eyes filling. “And you came back, and found me? [MASK], I.. She shook her head sharply, placed a hand on my mouth, and turned to load the mule.
<name>the judge</name>	the judge	Clement	“Turn the child,” he said. “She must watch the punishment.” The cook untangled her daughter’s fingers from her pinafore, placed a hand on her wet cheek, and turned her face around. “Proceed,” said [MASK].
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Canning	Once again, my labile convalescent emotions betrayed me, and my voice broke. [MASK]’s face softened. He gave me his arm. “You shouldn’t be standing,” he said, easing me back into the wicker chair, which groaned as I sat.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Annie	“Is that right?” she said, her broad mouth turned down in an ex-aggerated attempt at a scowl. “Better show [MASK] you Yankee notions then, and be quick about it, for I ain’t got no time for dawdlin’.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Brown	I felt my face settle into a scowl at this. If there is one class of person I have never quite trusted, it is a man who knows no doubt. I do not think I was jealous of [MASK], exactly, for finding approval in my wife’s fine eyes.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Jo	As well as the money, which was welcome, [MASK]’s compensation was the freedom she had of my uncle’s library. For some period each day, when my aunt napped or was occupied by company, she availed herself of the opportunity to read.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Flora	“[MASK] and I had been playing with the kittens upstairs in my room, but to be safe she went to the hidey-hole while I went down to answer the door, and that was just as well, for the man barged right in, without introduction or by your leave,” she said.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Canning	Seems we should shoot him now and be done with it, then when we get done selling the niggers we can have us a little furlough.” The major stood and stepped toward [MASK]. He ran a hand over his stubble. “Are you speaking the truth?
<name>Miss Caroline</name>	Miss Caroline	Grace	Tell her a thing but one time and it stuck like clay to a boot. I believe she would have worked at the letters all night if I had not stifled a yawn and [MASK] called a halt to the lesson.
<name>Mammy</name>	Mammy	Zannah	“Raise a ruckus now and we’s all done for,” he hissed. “[MASK] and that little one of hers as well.” But I had already stood by through a murder; I could not lie in the dark and do nothing while that girl was violated.
<name>Justice</name>	Justice	GbtM	[MASK], Are there any two words in all of the English language more closely twinned than courage and cowardice? I do not think there is a man alive who will not yearn to possess the former and dread to be accused of the latter.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Instinct	[MASK] opened my arms and I caught her-frail wisp that even I, depleted, could hold without effort. I fumbled through the next hours feeling somehow swaddled like a mummy, or wafted away on the fumes of an ether-soaked rag.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Cato	[MASK] swung round in the direction of the noise, but a ball found him first. A piece of his skull opened and flew out, and he pitched forward. What followed was a blur of noise and bodies, shots and screaming. I leapt up.
<name>Little Red Riding Hood</name>	Little Red Riding Hood	Jo	[MASK] had amassed quite a creditable harvest when she tripped on a tree root and fell, spilling the entire contents of her basket. She set up such a howling as would have driven beasts to ground and set the birds aflight throughout the wood.
<name>Stoneman</name>	Stoneman	Canning	All those months, and his loyalty had remained with his sons, and the Confederate spawn they served. I suppose he had nursed the grievances born of [MASK]’s early harshness, and nothing that had passed since then had caused a change of heart.
<name>Nat Turner</name>	Nat Turner	Brown	But [MASK]’s “bees,” as he described the slaves he believed would flock to his banner, failed to swarm. Two of his sons and several other followers were killed; he was wounded and taken prisoner.
<name>the patient</name>	the patient	McKillop	But the missile had shattered the bone near the elbow, splintering it into a score of white needles now sewn all through the shredded muscle. My resolution regarding [MASK] was tested within an instant when the surgeon, turning to wipe his knife on a piece of rag, noticed me.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Iam	And this is all my part. I give a patient God My patient heart. The boy had written this before the amputation. I expect he had seen enough by then to know his likely fate. [MASK] ready not to do. The line burned me.
<name>TJ</name>	TJ	Zannah	Under the cover of the loud voices and darkness, we crept forward to where we could see the guerrillas’ dispositions. They had the Negroes bound hand and foot now, all but [MASK], whom they had set to tending the cook fire.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Brooke	She left a note for you. She said it is but a line. She did not have time to write more.” [MASK] handed me the scrap of twisted paper. I could barely read it through the blur. Now you must see the need to be together.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	March	“[MASK], let me do you a kindness. Do yourself one. Request reassignment to the superintendent of contraband. Who knows? You may be able to do a deal of good there.” I left that makeshift office in a ferment of rage, mortification, and, yes, shame.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Brown	It would have been too cmel, and in any case, it was not, by then, entirely true. For if [MASK] had in some way seduced her, then he had seduced me, also. “He gives himself, entire.”
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Amy	Carefully, I drew forth the locks and laid them in the circle of candlelight. One fat curl in gleaming yellow, tied with a bow of pink satin: my little [MASK]’s glory. A mouse brown wisp from my tranquil Beth.
<name>Darcy</name>	Darcy	Clement	To be sure, those events were several years behind me by the time we met. The guilt I felt, for having let myself be seduced by [MASK]’s wealth and decieved by his false nobility had eased, in time, from an acute pain to a dull ache.
<name>notebook</name>	notebook	Webster	Tired out, filthy, and a lot to do this day.” I muttered apologies and turned to gather up my things. I saw the quill, the ink, the [MASK]’s, and the pages of childish writing, scrawled all over with my corrections.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Cilia	Then his grip on the rock loosened and it fell from his hand, bouncing harmlessly off my chest. He was scrabbling at his neck. The point of a saber spiked through his clutching fingers. [MASK] stood behind him, her mouth open in a thin howl.
<name>Peter</name>	Peter	Henry	The notes of a flute told that [MASK], too, was out. He was somewhere in the middle of the pond, in his boat, serenading the perch. I walked around the pond shore, the smooth white stones glowing clear enough to make the way easy.
<name>Lolita</name>	Lolita	Beth	[MASK] was delicate. Her whole short life had been marked by illnesses whose journeys took her out to the very edge of existence. Sometimes it seemed to me that her hold on this world was no firmer than the petal’s to the blown rose.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Jo	My uncle had a fine library, and he allowed [MASK] great liberty, letting her build railways and bridges even with his rare volumes. When she wearied of this, he would fetch down an interesting old folio with lavish plates and beckon her onto his lap.
<name>Tituba</name>	Tituba	Ethan	One of the guards kicked dirt in his direction and said, “Shut up.” “[MASK],” I whispered. “I’m sorry.” The night insects thrummed. “I know.” Through my torn smock I felt the roughness of the tree bark scraping against my back.
<name>Tarleton</name>	Tarleton	Canning	[MASK] had promised the Negroes a night’s liberty to engage in what he called their “savage frolics” in celebration of the cotton shipment. And celebrate they did, long into the night. The trash gangs had cleared mounds of cotton stalks from the fields, and these they used for a great bonfire.
<name>London</name>	London	Concord	But friends could not help but notice the carts coming to take our belongings. And despite our best economies, before very long I became behindhand with my debts. Tradesmen will talk in the taverns, and so eventually all [MASK] knew that we were in a most depleted state.
<name>Aunt March</name>	Aunt March	Canning	When I flipped it open, I saw that it also contained an ambrotype-a picture of a young, dark-haired girl about the same age as my Meg. [MASK] had never spoken of her. I brought the image close to my face and took a few seconds to study it.
<name>Aunt Reed</name>	Aunt Reed	Hannah	[MASK] had long experience with the management of that temper. When I turned from the door and met my aunt’s eye, I saw a look of vindictive triumph. My affront at her want of tact turned then to an anger of my own.
<name>Colonel Aureliano Buendía</name>	Colonel Aureliano Buendía	Canning	Army directives said contraband labor should be worked not more than ten hours of a summer’s day and nine in winter. My temper must have shown in my face, for [MASK] raised a hand when he saw me, and murmured, “Soon, not now.
<name>Joe Christmas</name>	Joe Christmas	Canning	But [MASK] did not ascend the large staircase that swept to the upper floors. He led the way to the cookhouse, where the old slave Ptolemy handed him a parcel wrapped in a cloth blooming with grease stains, then held out another, similar packet to me.
<name>Nietzsche</name>	Nietzsche	Heine	What is it that [MASK] says? ‘We do not have ideas. The idea has us ... and drives us into the arena to fight for it like gladiators, who combat whether they will or no.’ ” It was a pompous little utterance, in retrospect, and, recollecting the blank face
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Canning	[MASK] took the proffered cup with such an impatient gesture that the handle slid from his grip and the cup shattered on the bricks at his feet. He turned, about to abuse the stooped old man. I rose, with difficulty, and moved between them.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Grace	There was a blankness to his expression, for it seemed that the muscles of his face were as palsied as the rest of him. [MASK] leaned down to his ear and spoke soothingly. A strange sound, a kind of donkey bray, issued from his slack lips.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Zeke	We sat down with our backs to the wall of the well house as a pale sun eased up over the lush horizon. I opened the cloth holding the corn bread, and passed it to [MASK]. He took it in trembling hands that were knotted all over with snaking veins.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Marmee	The elegant elm-wood dining table went elsewhere, replaced with a simple piece I fashioned myself. The French sofas, likewise, departed to new homes, as did the silver service and the porcelain plate. Yet each loss was somehow compensated by [MASK]’s genius and industry.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Clement	But it is not so simple as that.” [MASK] swirled the amber liquid in his glass, brought it to his nose, and inhaled deeply. I imitated him. The fumes seared my sinuses and brought tears to my eyes.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jesse	When she protested their molestations, “a-screaming and a-cussing fit to rend the heavens,” as [MASK] put it, one of them held her while the other took out his pocket knife, pried open her mouth, and cut off her tongue.
<name>Dimmesdale</name>	Dimmesdale	McKillop	For a man like [MASK], who saw sin everywhere, it was enough. To me, it was a grave transgression to have entertained those longings, and to have acted upon them even so far as I did. To that extent, I deserved this.
<name>Mammy</name>	Mammy	Marmee	I stepped down from the stump, and made my way through the press to [MASK]. She was so proud of me that she could not speak, but only took my hand and clasped it, the pressure of her grip hard as a man’s.
<name>Lincoln</name>	Lincoln	Davis	I read the letter, and then the newspaper, aloud to the girls as we gathered in the parlor. Before [MASK]’s final adieu, I read that he had “told his fellow senators that he felt no hostility, and wished every one of them well.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jesse	We had reached the garden. The mule brushed against an overhanging branch of crape myrtle and loosed a cascade of pink blossoms upon us. I managed to dismount unassisted and handed the bridle to [MASK]. He turned to take the mule back to the fields.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Zeke	Come on, now, and take the rope and I’ll help pull you up.” [MASK] was a tall man, but spare to the point of wasted, so it took me no very significant effort to hoist him over the lip of the well.
<name>Kiowa</name>	Kiowa	Cato	It was daylight, and I lay prone in the clearing. There was a buzzing. I could not raise my head. I smelled acrid smoke. Through a blur, I saw bodies. [MASK]’s, and another of the irregulars.
<name>she</name>	she	Grace	Some calamity, clearly, had overtaken this place. I longed to learn more. But I was pressed hard all that day and into evening, and when I glimpsed [MASK], she, too, was about myriad duties so that we had no chance to speak.
<name>Jamie</name>	Jamie	Hope	So I hoped. I hoped so hard that [MASK] seemed to take corporeal form, my thoughts and wishes reaching out to him and wrapping themselves around him, as avidly as my body had wrapped around him when we both were young.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Markham	The carriage ride was so brief as made it barely worth harnessing the horses, but as the way was all uphill I was glad of the conveyance. The Negro servant, [MASK], was waiting for me at the gate and handed me down most civilly.
<name>Nathaniel</name>	Nathaniel	Brown	What would [MASK] say now, I wondered, of this guilty land and the purge of blood he had so accurately predicted? My reflections were disturbed by the uncouth behavior of some of our enlisted around the tiny building, which was, it seemed, being used as a holding cell.
<name>Jesse</name>	Jesse	Cato	I hopedjesse had a plan for that moment. I surely did not. Presently, a chorus of snoring-ragged, hoglike-commenced from those of the guerrillas who weren’t standing watch. [MASK]’s brother remained on guard duty, along with three others.
<name>Thoreau</name>	Thoreau	Henry	When the town selectmen refused to ring the bell to signal commencement of his lecture, [MASK] tolled it himself It was one of the most passionate orations I ever heard from him, and one he was asked to give at many venues in the following weeks, on each occasion shifting the ground beneath his audience.
<name>Simon</name>	Simon	Clement	Her whole body quivered. “For pity’s sake, man!” I exclaimed. [MASK]’s face was as cold and immobile as one of his sculptures. It was-though I grudge the sense of fairness which bids me set this down-almost as white.
<name>gender</name>	gender	Genesis	This much is true: at that moment I believed that the most moral act I could perform would be the one that would unite us, completely. I wanted to give the lie to every claim of difference save the God-ordained one of [MASK]: man and woman created he them.
<name>Jody</name>	Jody	Josiah	I stopped on the path and waited until he drew level with me. “Get up on the mule, [MASK],” I said in a kindly voice. He shook his lowered head sharply and gave a grim ebony frown. “Go on,” I urged.
<name>the old man</name>	the old man	Ptolemy	There was laughter. I was sweating and shivering. My mind told my body to move, to crawl, to go out and save the old man. But my sinews had turned to broth. Then I heard [MASK]’s cracked voice crying out.
<name>Dr. Livesey</name>	Dr. Livesey	MARCH	And what of myself? An honest accounting of my hours would hardly make fit reading: that I had thrown soup over one nurse in the morning, and spent the subsequent hours interrogating [MASK] fet. another as to their father’s secret past.
<name>Jeb</name>	Jeb	Jesse	you know what that means?” “Means you don’t got no gun to ’tect youself.” “[MASK], the Confederate soldier is a hard and desperate fighter, but he is not a savage. There are rules, even in war ...”
<name>Stoneman</name>	Stoneman	Croft	He had secured a year’s lease from the owner, the widow of a Confederate colonel named [MASK]. That lady, a Northerner by birth, had removed herself to the city after her lands fell under Union occupation and had readily taken the loyalty oath.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Canning	My view is that any man who can stand to make his water must go to the fields and do his share of work-or else forgo his share of corn.” My face must have told the emotion that was mounting in my breast, for [MASK] glared.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Marmee	[MASK] asked, the day I unfolded to her the desperate state of our fortune. She was standing half turned away from me at the parlor window. Her hand stroked her swollen belly, for the news of my min had come as we awaited the birth of our fourth child.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Meg	She set down the tea and leaned forward, continuing the work of unwrapping the red-raw flesh of her blistered feet. She winced for a second as she eased them into the water, and then calmly accepted the plate of bread and baked apples [MASK] offered her.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	March	“Sir, such wanton destruction is hardly-” “Keep your peace, would you, [MASK], for once in your life?” He jabbed the compass so hard that it passed right through the chart and lodged in the fine mahogany of the desk beneath.
<name>Queequeg</name>	Queequeg	McKillop	Just then, [MASK]’s instrument hit a vessel and a spurt of warm liquid flew into my eye. I could not let go my grip on the writhing body to wipe it away, so I went on: “He sent forth his word and healed them...”
<name>Sharpe</name>	Sharpe	March	“Sir-” I began, but he cut me off. “[MASK], I think you should reconsider your place with this regiment.” “Sir?” “You can’t seem to get on with anyone. You’ve irritated the other officers ...
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Achilles	The babe emerged into the world with a countenance and coloring that were a tiny miniature of my own. We had jested privately that if it were a man-child, the circumstances of his conception would oblige us to name him [MASK].
<name>The Chief</name>	The Chief	Canning	I was about to say that I didn’t know what building might be available, but [MASK] cut me off “No: you don’t know. You know exactly nothing.” With that, he turned his back on me and marched off toward the work gang.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Ethan	“But, [MASK],” I exclaimed (we had resorted to first names by now, not out of any affection but simply from the necessary intimacies of our proximity). “You sanctioned this. You encouraged me to seek this charity ...” “Yes.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Meg	For a moment, I gasped, and realized that it might not be so very long before [MASK] takes her place in the bed of some young man. I wondered if, when that time came, she would still have a father at her wedding to give her away.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Marmee	I thought it unseemly, in such a small town as ours, to be shunned by a near relation. As part of her penance, and her new resolution with regard to her conduct, [MASK] called early on my Aunt March to offer an apology.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Meg	She waved a lace-clad arm in the direction of our darling [MASK]. “I am willing to take her,” she declared with an exaggerated sigh of resignation. “I will adopt her forthwith, thus relieving you of the burden of at least one mouth to feed.”
<name>Allen</name>	Allen	Brown	[MASK] and his boys had surveyed and registered the freedmen’s land titles so that unscrupulous whites could not lay claim to them, and now they were helping the settlers master the rudiments of farming in a harsh landscape with a short growing season.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Ethan	“I have to try and hire some kind of guards-perhaps I can get the mulattos who were working at the post-I can’t have the Negroes getting it into their heads to run off” “[MASK]! You cannot be serious!”
<name>John</name>	John	Canning	There was dark blood dripping from wounds where his knees had been. His head lay slumped against the horse’s neck. The gelding’s mane, too, was all clotted with blood from the side of [MASK]’s head. They had cut off his ear.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Meg	But even while this thought filled my mind and clouded my heart, somehow, my mouth was uttering small encomiums about [MASK] and her diligent housework, and how her scarred, workworn hand seemed finer to me than the unblemished one of which she had used to be a little vain.
