<name>George</name>	George	Strike	The old man switched clipper heads, stood on tiptoe, elbow high, and cleared a thin, exact path down to the scalp like the tail of a whippet. It seemed to [MASK] that the lad was so flushed with pleasure that he could barely look at himself.
<name>Bonnie</name>	Bonnie	Strike	[MASK] almost lunged across the table. “You don’t know nothin’! You don’t know nothin’ about it! You just a puh-pig-faced motherfucker police who don’t know nothin’ about what’s out there, nothin’ about me, an’ nothin’ about what ha-happened.”
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Rudy	“Why’d you meet him at [MASK]’s?” “It was just a bump-in, like a accident.” “OK. Who got there first?” “Him I guess. He was there when I got there, like sitting down.”
<name>Eminem</name>	Eminem	Thumper	[MASK]’s rap so gallingly familiar. “So what is it— you got no father? He’s dead? Fuck it, you’re probably better off. The guy was probably a prick. I used to wish my father was dead.
<name>Janine</name>	Janine	Rocco	[MASK] was always startled by the sharp rise in noise inside the receiving unit. Everything was covered in glazed tile; nothing absorbed the disembodied shouts and barks that ricocheted off the walls like bullets fired inside a steel drum.
<name>the judge</name>	the judge	Jimmy	char- acter, something that he had to know from the git-go would deny him access to his wife and children for thirty years—” “Investigator,” [MASK] warned. “Or even for five years.
<name>Cheryl</name>	Cheryl	Patty	“You know what he drove? A Volvo station wagon.” “Wow,” [MASK] smirked. “No really. You know, you might say that people are people, but that isn’t always the case.”
<name>Avon</name>	Avon	Strike	“You gotta do what you gotta do.” [MASK] controlled himself, the words coming out low and lazy. “Yeah? Let me ask you something else. Do you think I’m an effective deterrent in the war on drugs?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Strike	It was close to midnight, and [MASK] envisioned the last squad car, the last tan Plymouth, just now rolling away from the benches. He slid his legs over the side of the bed and began to pull on his clothes, his movements slow, his head thick.
<name>Nancy</name>	Nancy	Strike	“Yeah, we get there too. Just do it, awright? Ten.” The books belonged to a series, each volume costing eight dollars and forty-five cents, [MASK] thinking. Times ten equals a lot of money for books.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Mazilli	“It’s probably bullshit,” he said, sucking down half his Cape Codder through the straw and rising from the table. “It’s probably a fuckin’ tripleheader.” [MASK] signaled the waitress, raising his glass, pinging it with a flick of his fingernail.
<name>Terry</name>	Terry	Rocco	“You know, before. He showed me the gun and he said he was gonna kill that guy. Next thing somebody did it, right?” She looked at the ashtray as she spoke, avoiding his eyes, [MASK] thinking. This really stinks.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Rocco	“Let me ask you something,” she said, nodding to [MASK]’s sport jacket. “You carry that gun. Someone’s coming up on you in a alley or out of the dark. You go to defend yourself and you shoot that person.
<name>Tony</name>	Tony	Ronnie	Three or four of his buddies stood watching the show. He waved them away, but no one moved. “Talk to me, [MASK].” “Woo-what are you saying, I did it?” “I didn’t say that.
<name>Stabler</name>	Stabler	Rocco	“I was at a scene.” “You just got into the office, right? This call just' caught you as you walked in the door.” [MASK] swiveled around so his back was to the victims sister “Can I call you back?
<name>Tom's</name>	Tom's	Victors	In the end he had bluffed her out, telling her it was official business, as if she had no say about whom she admitted into her home. When she opened the door, [MASK] mother gazed at him as if he was a bill collector.
<name>Truman</name>	Truman	Rocco	“You have a nice night now,” [MASK] said. The guy stood there wanting to say something, looking hot, but he made it all the way to the screen door before he turned back and started barking.
<name>whiskey</name>	whiskey	Comet	“This old boy like fourteen? He got dumped by a girl so he put some [MASK] in a glass of milk for hisself, they take him to the hospital and who do he call for, his mother? Hell no, he call for me.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Rocco	He crashed a line of taxis at the main entrance, ignoring the pissed-off gestures of the dispatcher. “You got enough on you for a bus somewheres?” [MASK] asked, although up to this point nobody had said anything about further travel.
<name>Omar</name>	Omar	Erroll	The nigger killed a TV reporter once—four, no maybe five, six other motherfuckers that I know of. I say to him, Yo, [MASK], this boy done stole my money, is stealing my money.”
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Rocco	Finally she met his eyes. “I know he told you that boy attacked him. I don’t see why you don’t believe him.” Running out of guile, feeling he had nothing to lose now, [MASK] decided to drop it right in her lap.
<name>Jimmy</name>	Jimmy	Strike	He cut the guy off and walked over to [MASK], the veins dancing in his temples. “This motherfucker say he gave a hundred dollars to a guy around the comer for a clip, says the guy say to come around get the dope from me.
<name>Rocky</name>	Rocky	Strike	‘What’s wrong with your stomach?” The kid gave a minute jerk of his shoulders. “Then how come you’re holding it?” Another shrug. [MASK] thought about offering him some Mylanta. “You did good, you know that?”
<name>Walt</name>	Walt	Tyrone	At the sink, he stood behind [MASK] and watched him rinse off the mixing bowl and the soup spoon. He could tell by the way the kid held the bowl under the faucet that he was trying not to come into contact with the chalky veil of cocaine residue.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Rodney	[MASK] was a fool. “Yeah, well then you should drop a dime here, man, ’cause they don’t wait to set up on a shooting. They just go in an’ snatch him up.” “Yeah? What kind of proof you got?
<name>Steve</name>	Steve	Rodney	And one of the guys was new; he was a little older and wore less gold. “Who’s this?” [MASK] tilted his chin to the new guy, finally commencing to cut his son’s hair. “This my cousin,” one of the kids said.
<name>Raymond</name>	Raymond	Rocco	I’m gonna help him. I’m gonna help him.” He wiped a crescent of sweat from under one eye. [MASK] could hear the voices of small children somewhere in the speaker, fragmented and far away—voices heard while dozing at a beach.
<name>my</name>	my	Strikes	It was just like [MASK] mother said when they’d had their big fight: “How much is enough? How much money do you have to make to retire? Who do you think you’re hustling with that nonsense, me or yourself?”
<name>Tony</name>	Tony	Rodney	[MASK] blathered on. “See, the only thing, it might take some time. This shit always takes some time, because now they want this guy tonight to introduce like another guy, let that second guy get in good, make the big guy buys, and then take him down.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Rocco	“I didn’t. . .” “Didn’t what?” “I was sorry to hear about it. . . It’s my buh-brother, you know?” “OK.” [MASK] nodded, ready to shift gears again.
<name>Eddie</name>	Eddie	Juan	“It’s like a math problem. [MASK] got whacked at point X, he drove away losing blood at the rate of a pint every ninety seconds. He was driv- ing forty-five miles an hour and he bought the farm two miles inside the tunnel.”
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Strike	But [MASK] had never held it against him: self-control was important, but a man’s got to have some kind of release valve. It was just that he’d never considered his brother a bar drinker before.
<name>Leda</name>	Leda	Ronald	I asked you if you talked to [MASK], to Strike, about this, and you come back at me with this, this long, heartfelt candidness, telling me all about him, how he’s a good kid in a bad head and all, defending him—well, not defending, explaining him.
<name>He</name>	He	Rocco	Or maybe he was calling to work out a deal for himself and then changed his mind. [MASK] was still trying to figure it out a day later as he sat in the Homicide office overseeing the haircut of a quadruple murderer.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Rocco	“I guess so.” “And how about the regular guy, this guy, did he stay for the whole movie?” [MASK] asked, thinking that would take him to eleven, roughly forty-five minutes past the murder. “I couldn’t say.
<name>Raymond</name>	Raymond	Rocco	In fact, he had gone borderline doggy, and when the guy disappeared without so much as a thank-you, [MASK] had taken it personally. What the hell was he supposed to do, go out and cap somebody himself just to keep the guy infotained?
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Rodneys	But what was he supposed to do, get a job? Well, why not? It’s not against the law. He could do anything. He could work in a store again, maybe buy himself a store, a little store like [MASK].
<name>Conor</name>	Conor	Strike	“And I’ll tell you something else. I used to sell dope, you know, in high school. I cleaned up on it too, so I know what that feels like.” He collapsed back on the bench, his voice in [MASK]’s ear now.
<name>The Misfit</name>	The Misfit	Rocco	The kid didn’t say it, but he settled down and stared up at him steadily with his one uncovered eye. [MASK] got up on his haunches, the grandmother still bellowing, “Hat don’t do drugs!”
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Rodney	“You know the kid?” “He’s a no-good arrogant dope-dealing piece of shit comes into my store all the time like he craps beige. He used to work in [MASK]’s grocery, like a year ago? But he got promoted.
<name>Malcolm</name>	Malcolm	Rocco	“Well, there’s this lad who works for him in the Roosevelt Houses named—” [MASK] was interrupted by one of the guys behind bars, a tall, thin kid with huge hands. “You motherfuckers got some motherfucking quota tiling here, because I dint serve nobody.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Rocco	On the nights they went to bed at the same time, [MASK] would lie there and watch her go to the closet, watch her choose either silky slips or mannish shirts, like running up sex flags from across the room.
<name>Stakeout</name>	Stakeout	Rocco	[MASK] liked to come up on homicide crowds from the rear, weave his way up to the tape so he could overhear snatches of street speculation. It was hard to drink straight out of the small-mouthed bottles but they managed, tossing the empties while they were still a block away.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Rocco	“Shit, I’ll tell you exactly. He’s twenty-eight.” [MASK] regarded her through narrowed eyes. “I’ll be back in a minute. You sure I can’t get you anything?”
<name>The speaker</name>	The speaker	Rocco	“Did they leave together?” “I don’t think so.” “Do you remember who left first?” The guard squinted into the distance, then shook his head. “Unh- uh.” [MASK] was disappointed, but it sounded honest at least.
<name>Neal</name>	Neal	Touhey	You could walk down the street naked, middle of the night. It was a pleasure.” “How come you guys are stopping for all the red lights?” [MASK] started bouncing on the edge of his seat again. “Well, how do you drive?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Rocco	[MASK], startled out of his irritation, downed his glass to keep pace, laughing selfconsciously as he wiped his lips with a fist. “You mean, to be me all the time or in a movie?”
<name>Joey</name>	Joey	Mazilli	OK, but you best get there before I finish the report or he’s going into the shelter, OK? Yeah, bye.” [MASK] hung up. “She says for you to take him with you. She’ll pick him up at the station.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Strike	What other kind of bills?” “Hey.” [MASK] felt lubricated, his T-shirt swimming across his ribs. “It only four dollars. You want me to get it now? I probably ga-got it at home, you know.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Tyrone	[MASK] nodded mutely. “You got quick wrists? ’Cause if you don’t got quick wrists, you might as well forget about it.” The kid blinked uncomprehendingly. “Let me see how quick you got your wrists. Put you to the test.”
<name>Wyatt</name>	Wyatt	Rocco—“just	“You know, I know, everybody in town knows what’s goin’ on here. So like i-if you want to arrest me for that”—he held his wrists out to [MASK] go ahead, ’cause I ain’t gonna stand out here no more with you like this.”
<name>Walt</name>	Walt	Strike	The kid looked unnerved, but [MASK] saw something else coming off him too: there was a secret giddiness in the widening of his eyes, in the way he held his lips between his teeth. Eight bags were full now, about two ounces left in the bowl.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Rocco	“You finished here?” the paramedic asked again. “Yeah.” [MASK] spit out his chewed rubber bands. “Watch the bags on die hands.” He peeled his gloves off, tossing diem between the legs of the body, his eyes on the actor.
<name>Malcolm</name>	Malcolm	Rodney	When the driver honked, [MASK] pulled over one lane, slowed down until the car came abreast of him, went eyeball-to-eyeball with four white teenagers for a long minute and then veered sharply back into their lane, making them drive off onto the shoulder.
<name>The detective</name>	The detective	Strike	“That’s fine. So now I don’t have to advise you of your rights. Anything you tell me now, about people, about drugs, can not be held against you in a court of law. So far so good, right?” [MASK] waited.
<name>Edie</name>	Edie	ShaRon	Keep people’s minds open.” “Why you want that picture?” [MASK] cocked her head, a kind of half-dead amusement in her face. “Because he looks good in it. He looks like the nice guy I know he is.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Strike	“Nothin’ coming down.” “Yeah, huh? Last time you said Monday night’s gonna be knock night.” [MASK] sucked his teeth, a small wave of anger rising up. “Hey kid, you know who you remind me of?
<name>Leslie</name>	Leslie	Jackie	“Well, something came up.” “Is it something I did?” He tried for a jokey, self-mocking tone but felt disgusted by his own question. “No, no” [MASK] said, “you’re great, you’re great.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Rocco	FOUR driving in FOR THE start of Thursday’s four-to-twelve tour, [MASK] negotiated a road that was more pothole than asphalt, weaving his way down a lane of truck stops and Highway Department equipment sheds before pulling into the Dempsy County prosecutors office parking lot.
<name>Chigurh</name>	Chigurh	Strike	“Gah-damn, man, what the fuck?” [MASK] saw the black-eyed gun boy disappear around the street side of the van. “Sometime you don’t want the beeper noise, that beep-beep, you know?”
<name>Raymond</name>	Raymond	Rocco	[MASK] held his palms up and slid in his chair to the center of the room. “You wanted her, right?” The cop nodded to the woman he had just brought in, who stood slightly hunched over, her hands jammed into her armpits.
<name>Whiskey</name>	Whiskey	Bernard	Does he do that? Hell no. He takes seven hundred, buys one ounce, takes the other seven hundred and parties. Comes back next week after that, buys a ounce for seven, parties for seven, every goddamn week. Seven-and-seven [MASK].
<name>Dee</name>	Dee	Strike	“You know why I carry this?” [MASK] held up the gun. “Because if that man ever come up my wrong side? It’s gonna be me or him, and it’s gonna be over like that.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Thumper	and she’s shrieking, ‘Don’t worry baby, don’t worry baby,’ bugging her eyes, and now she’s doing this wheezing number.” [MASK] put his hand on his chest, opening his eyes wide and breathing deeply but strained, as if the air was coming through a pinched straw.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Strike	He dropped it in a garbage can, hissed “Yo” to get the customers attention, then walked away too. It took a few seconds for the guy to figure it out, but then he snatched up the bag and hustled off toward the street. It was [MASK]
<name>Jimmy</name>	Jimmy	Rocco	“You got to get that?” The kid jerked back, smiling. “It ain’t me.” “No?” The beeper sounded again and [MASK] checked his hip, saw his home number blinking up at him.
<name>Delores</name>	Delores	Rocco	See what I’m sayin’?” The reverend smiled and opened his hands, and [MASK] thought of the family photo under the scotch bottle at Hambones. "See, this is what I’m thinking right now.” The reverend hesitated, picking his words.
<name>Tony</name>	Tony	Strike	Somebody told him that; who would have told him? [MASK] started thinking about his own mother, about how ever since he moved out of the house he never ran into her, even though he was working the benches in the same projects where she lived.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Reynard	Last chance, my man. Give me an ounce.” [MASK] breathed through his nose. “I was in the hospital.” His voice was a distant murmur, as if he had no interest in his own alibi. “You were in the hospital.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Victor	I know guys been on particular jobs ten years, they don’t care, and this one’s mine. I’m keeping it open because both me and you, we know [MASK]’s innocent, we already discussed that, but here’s the thing.
<name>Anton</name>	Anton	Victor	“[MASK] ain’t no killer,” he said finally. “That’s all I know.” “He got family?” “Yeah.” “Maybe you should help them out, you know, financially.
<name>Pop</name>	Pop	Popeye	[MASK] was forty-five but looked sixty, a hobbled-up twist-backed pipehead with a bulging left eye. He shuffled over to the bench licking his lips, probably broke but liking to be near the bottles anyhow, hoping he’d find one in the grass or something.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Strike	She dropped it on top of the cigarette butts in the urn. Its adhesive tabs covered with sand, the diaper began to open up, and [MASK] was riveted by the sight of it, slowly unfurling like a dead man’s fist.
<name>Chief</name>	Chief	Mazilli	Somebody once told me that they don’t even slaughter their chickens, they just wait for them to get sick and die their own selves.” Grinning, he dropped the picture back on [MASK]’s desk. “You ever hear of anybody selling dope there?”
<name>Officer</name>	Officer	Bones	“I think someone’s jerking your bird over there.” “Maybe. Can you cut me a picture, send it over?” “You got it.” “[MASK], what’s this guy, white or black?”
<name>Scarface</name>	Scarface	Thumper	There ain’t no drug war save for who gets the best comers. You know that.” “Yeah, good night, motherfucker.” [MASK] hung his hands at his sides like a gunslinger, only a litde play left in his voice now.
<name>Severus</name>	Severus	Rodney	The lights were off and he couldn’t decide if that was good or bad. He felt a surge of remorse for having cast his lot with [MASK] over his own true blood. “Can I tell you something?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Rocco	[MASK] felt like a horse’s ass, eating his own cake in this lady’s house, but he had no choice. In fact, he had to admire the move, her ability to throw him off guard with his own props. “Tips?”
<name>Soda</name>	Soda	Strike	“What’s the talk on the street?” [MASK] shrugged. “I didn’t. . .” “Didn’t what?” “I was sorry to hear about it. . . It’s my buh-brother, you know?”
<name>Bodie</name>	Bodie	Rodney	Just so long you ain’t a cop, it’s me and you, ’cause I just don’t give a fuck.’ You know what I’m sayin’?” [MASK] stood up straight, arched his back, then dropped back down to the window.
<name>Darry</name>	Darry	Victor	Maybe it was to take a last look, say good-bye to people, his boys. Maybe somewhere in his mind he even had the notion to go up and see his mother, drop off some cash for [MASK]’s kids.
<name>Anton</name>	Anton	Ronnie	“But tomorrow? If you don’t come in on this? It’s just you, him and the foliage, you know what I mean? Hah?” Right left right. Got to go. “Hey [MASK], you got a gun?”
<name>He</name>	He	Rocco	Her voice was raw and gravelly, her eyes sullen and steady. “Good,” [MASK] said mildly and extended his arm toward the interrogation room, bowing slightly. She walked down the hallway swaybacked, leading with her pelvis like someone who was suffering from borderline starvation.
<name>Erroll</name>	Erroll	Strike	Startled, [MASK] sat up, automatically feeling under the seat for the money. The money. The Toys R Us bag was gone. “See now usually I let Erroll do it all, you know? Carry the cash and take the dope, but tonight I figured I do the cash
<name>He</name>	He	Stitch	“Damn,” he whined, trying to come off bruised. “Yeah, right, damn. Just get the fuck on out.” [MASK] walked off, mumbling his story to himself as if he actually believed it.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Rocco	The kid shot him a fast smirk and [MASK] laughed. “How about that,” he said, then held up his hand. “Awright, look. I was just hoping, talking to you, maybe you could’ve helped me figure out a reason for that guy attacking your brother like that.
<name>Jackie</name>	Jackie	Rocco	Getting more and more fretful about all the sputter-factors involved, [MASK] decided as he drove that what he’d just done was no guarantee of anything. In order to bring this all the way home, he would have to walk right into the lion’s den, throw the meat on the floor.
<name>Lebowski</name>	Lebowski	Rodney	A scruffed-up pipehead with a ragged beard and a dirty plaid shirt came out of the house onto the porch, a shard of wood sticking out the side of his hair like a chopstick. “What’s up?” [MASK] rocked on his heels.
<name>Bodie</name>	Bodie	Mazilli	“Maybe we should go in with Housing.” “C’mon.” [MASK] got out and walked directly to the bench, picking out a kid he knew from his liquor store. “What’s your name again?”
<name>Officer Coffey</name>	Officer Coffey	Strike	It feel like somebody won the numbers out here, the way it going.” [MASK] counted three pipeheads lighting up in plain sight. “Look at that.” “What?” “Whats wrong with you? Get them motherfuckers out of here.”
<name>Tony</name>	Tony	Erroll	I’m sorry man, I’m sorry I get your money back, it’s the sickness.’ And [MASK]’s aiming that thing at me, so I just take out my piece. I can’t even look at the guy, I just hide my eyes, go boom boom boom.”
<name>Chico</name>	Chico	Rocco	Hands in pockets, [MASK] absently belly-bumped the tape as he nodded to the kid. “What’s up. Money?” The kid shrugged, curling his hands under his perforated blue-and-orange Mets jersey, exposing his flat belly.
<name>The lawyer</name>	The lawyer	Jimmy	I’d plea out, I’d take the Aggravated Manslaughter. Get out of jail, my kids are still in elementary school.’ And then he says, ‘It was self-defense.’ ” [MASK] flapped his hands in exasperation. “So once again.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Victor	When I started here, it was like don’t even look me in the eye. I’m the boss, you know? Like I’m going down with the ship. But [MASK], man, he’s like—” “How was he with the customers?”
<name>Ray</name>	Ray	Rocco	It was a balmy, starry night and nearly a hundred people were hanging out, every one of them taking note of the two Homicides in the Chevy, some pointedly looking away, others muttering or making side-mouthed comments. “They’re gonna trash the fucking car,” [MASK] said.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Patty	“I can’t make it home tonight. I got a thing I got to do at the jail. I can’t do it until like five in the morning.” [MASK] sighed. “Shit.” “Shit?”
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Strike	There wasn’t a newspaper or magazine in the room. [MASK]’s gaze went back and forth from a hand-drawn sign over the courtroom doors—THIS WAITING ROOM IS A COURTESY. YOU ARE NOT IN THE STREET.
<name>his</name>	his	Victor	“The guy that comes here regular, this one,” the bartender said, tapping [MASK]’s picture. “What was he doing back there?” “I don’t know.” “Was he on the pay phone?” “I didn’t notice.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Rodney	I need a favor, man. I need a favor bad. I need like half an ounce on consignment, man.” [MASK] nodded. “You need a half ounce?” “I’m desperate, man.” “You need a half ounce.”
<name>He</name>	He	Rocco	He liked that, an island of comfort. [MASK] wondered what his marriage would be like in six months when he planned to retire. He had no idea what the future would hold for him except that he would be going out at half pay, about twenty thousand dollars a year.
