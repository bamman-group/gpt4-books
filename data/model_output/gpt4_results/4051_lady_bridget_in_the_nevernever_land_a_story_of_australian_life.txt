<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Bridget	The romance of it all appealed tremendously to the Celtic blood in [MASK]. It was her nature, when she gave, to give generously. She had become genuinely in love with her bush husband during that wonderful honeymoon journey. Ah, that journey! What an experience!
<name>John</name>	John	Luke	And [MASK] did care for his wife. He will be broken-hearted.' She stood gazing out upon the plain, on which the mist was gathering. From across the gully sounded the cattle being driven home. When she turned to him, her eyes were full of tears.
<name>Travers</name>	Travers	McKeith	It surprised him a little that [MASK] should not himself see his wife off; but he also recognised practical reasons--against that natural concession to sentiment. On the whole, it rather pleased him to find his employer ignoring sentiment, and he fully appreciated the confidence reposed in himself.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Bill	Amazing queer the amount of water running underground on this dried-up old earth.' 'But we can always strike it, [MASK]; no matter how dried up the outside looks, there's the living spring waiting to be tapped.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Maule	That's where I saw [MASK] step out of--I guessed he'd come round by the back of the Old Humpey. I guessed too, he thought she oughtn't to be sitting out there in the damp--
<name>Heyst</name>	Heyst	McKeith	[MASK] glared at the man, who, had he been quick at psychological interpretations, would have read an awful apprehension underlying the ill-restrained fury in the other's face. The question came in hoarse jerks. 'What--Who--Who was it you saw--?'
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Maule	What she saw in it might have made a less reckless or less innocent woman feel uneasy. She was sure that he must have heard that last speech of hers about visiting [MASK] in his chambers. Well, she didn't care.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Biddy	'You're leading him on to it. [MASK], it is abominable of you to encourage him as you do--coming here with him that day.... And you let him take you riding....' 'Yes, he knows now that I CAN ride.'
<name>John</name>	John	McKeith	Probably [MASK], because he was the strongest. Equally, he showed it the least when the breaking moment had passed. Yet both husband and wife seemed to have covered their faces, hearts and souls with unrevealing masks. No, it was worse than that.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bridget	It wasn't complete till a long time afterwards.' He was standing behind [MASK]'s chair, his eyes still gazing beyond the river. He did not notice that she leaned back suddenly, and her hands fell nervelessly to her lap. He felt a touch on his arm.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Joan	They say that love and religion are the chief emotional interests of unattached women. I should add on doctors when a woman is growing old. Don't you think, [MASK], that in that case, all three come invariably to the same thing?'
<name>Leslie</name>	Leslie	Biddy	'Yes--I see.' His tone was doubtful. 'You've tried it before--that idea of bigger interests--a different kind of life--in other ways, [MASK], haven't you?' 'Oh! in ever so many ways.
<name>Wilmot</name>	Wilmot	Harris	The blood surged to his brain, and his temples throbbed as though they would burst. In the madness of his jealousy, the words of the paper, combined with [MASK]' revelations were damnatory confirmation of his wife's guilt.
<name>Reggie</name>	Reggie	Chris	She says that it would have made everything so much nicer for her and [MASK], and that the King might have ordered some wine from his firm.' She was teasing. He knew it, and it infuriated him. '
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	McKeith	But she sank again presently, exhausted, on her pillows. In a short time [MASK] came back, booted and spurred, and stood as before looking at her with forbidding sternness. 'You'd better have stopped quiet.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Maggie	You don't imagine, do you, that they can go on the same?' 'No,' she retorted with spirit, 'certainly they can't go on the same.' [MASK] had come along the veranda and was at the French window. '
<name>She</name>	She	Bridget	There is no doubt that given the regrettable position, his behaviour in regard to her now is commendable. But [MASK], doesn't love him--never has loved him. I state that fact on no authority whatsoever except my own intuition.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Cudgee	She answered it with another COO-EE, to [MASK]'s delight. 'My word! Ba'al newchum, that feller white Mary,' said he. They had rounded a knoll abutting on the green line of ti-trees and swamp oak.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	McKeith	She had a hope that [MASK] might say something conciliatory to her before he left. The remembrance of that disregarded appeal--the word 'Mate' to which she had given no response, weighed, a guilty load, upon her heart.
<name>Clare</name>	Clare	Bridget	Yet what she had said was true. [MASK] had talked often enough of falling 'in love'--which she had always been at pains to define as a mere transitory condition--not by any means the 'real thing,' and she had freely confessed to violent attractions and even adorations.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Willoughby	Neither [MASK] nor he deserve an iota of consideration. I shall amuse myself. So! No more.... But he can't know that. He has never thought about ME. He has thought of nothing but his own cross-grained pride and selfish egoism.
<name>she</name>	she	Biddy	I've written to the lawyer, and [MASK] will be served with the papers soon after this reaches you. I'm not sending her any message. If she doesn't understand, there's no use in words--but YOU know this.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	McKeith	'Can you ride?' he asked. 'CAN I ride--Can any O'Hara ride! You needn't find ME a quiet hack.' 'All right,' said [MASK]. 'But I wouldn't make sure of that by putting you on a buckjumper.
<name>Will</name>	Will	Cudgee	Presently, from the hummock above came the sound of [MASK]'s axe. He had felled the youngest of the grass-trees, and was now chopping off its green tuft. Soon he appeared, carrying a huge bunch of the coarse blades of foliage, which he brought to the tent.
<name>he</name>	he	Colin	She was loyal though, in spite of her many faults, and 'game' in her own way--and when [MASK] came out of his dour moods, she was generally ready to meet him half way. For, through all, the memory of the dream-drive honeymoon lingered.
<name>Clarence</name>	Clarence	Bridget	He thought it strange that she should be thinking of her husband and his material interests just then. CHAPTER 5 It must have been a little while after midnight when [MASK] was awakened by more thunder and lightning and a confused tornado of sound.
<name>Warrigal</name>	Warrigal	Wombo	'You wouldn't listen when he told you that he didn't dare go back to his tribe--because his gin's husband threatened to kill him.' 'My sympathies are with the gin's husband. What business has [MASK] to steal another man's wife?'
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Joan	'You may bet your life on that. [MASK] hasn't said anything about whatever love-affairs you may have had.' 'Every girl has had love-affairs. I'm no exception to the rule. There's been no real harm in them.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Bridget	Of course, [MASK] had taken his banter in good part, and with a pretty grimace had told him she would get out a consignment of the stuff her Aunt Eliza gave at Christmas to the old men in their Irish village and present him with it.
<name>Macgillivray</name>	Macgillivray	McKeith	[MASK] was able to relax the strain. 'My word! we scooted pretty quick out of that piece of scenery,' he said. 'I felt downright mad at your being let in for such a disgraceful bit of business.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	McKeith	They were still in the gum forest, but now and then came a belt of gidia scrub--mournful trees with stiff black trunks and grey green foliage and a pale sort of wattle flower smelling like dead cattle when rain is about, as [MASK] explained.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	McKeith	Almost before he had finished his sentence she had pulled herself together. Her hand was in his, and she spoke in her old fluty voice and little grand manner, with the old slow, faintly whimsical smile on her lips and in her eyes. It came over [MASK] that
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bridget	Well, you have secured those. Why not go and enjoy them as I'm asking you to do.' 'They have no value for me, unless I may share them with you. [MASK], I can give you everything now that you once asked for.'
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Maggie	'You must have food,' he said, and went out. She heard him calling [MASK]. After a few minutes he came back with a tumbler of beaten egg and milk, to which he had added brandy, and told her she must drink it.
<name>Bruce</name>	Bruce	Veno	All the time, the old kangaroo dog, [MASK] had been nosing round him, sniffing at the objects lying round, then looking up at him with bleared, wistful eyes, and evidently unable to understand these strange proceedings.
<name>Inspector</name>	Inspector	McKeith	'This is a nice sort of place to show a lady into.' The woman burst out on the defensive, but [MASK] silenced her. 'That'll do. Clear away all that mess and let us have a clean cloth and some tea.
<name>St. George</name>	St. George	Brunhilda	'Ah! Because you soon showed that [MASK]'s dragon was only pasteboard and blue fire after all--one of the shams you despise. I'm not afraid of him now.... Oh, it's wonderful.... It's beautiful....'
<name>Leslie</name>	Leslie	Joan	The girl's small, pale face flushed to deep crimson for a moment. '[MASK], you are cruel! You know that was the sting! And it wouldn't have stung so if I hadn't cared. Sometimes I feel the maddest desire to hurt him--to pay him out.
<name>Wharton</name>	Wharton	McKeith	In what way, can you tell me?' 'You'll find that your grass is burned, I daresay.' 'I'm obliged to you for the hint. I'll take precautions, and I'll begin by shepherding you straight off my run,' said [MASK]. '
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Biddy	'You are off civilization, [MASK]?' 'Yes I am, I've had a horrible time. I was quite reckless and spent far too much on clothes and things--but that's not what matters--it's the effect on one's inner self that matters.
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Joan	'He's a hundred times better man, [MASK].' 'That you needn't tell me; and I'm glad you recognise the fact. But from the point of view of "The Lady of Quality," would he be a better husband?'
<name>Valentine</name>	Valentine	McKeith	It's a mystery I don't take upon myself to fathom--I'll leave that to you.' 'There's one easy solution of the mystery that doesn't seem to have occurred to you,' said [MASK]. '
<name>Cox</name>	Cox	Cox	And then there's all the rest--the putting the key back and fitting in times and all that.... Seems to me a bit too much of the Box and [MASK] trick--a sort of jig-saw puzzle, d'you see.'
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Colin	His long upper lip went down in obstinate resistance to impulse. But if he had kissed her then, she would not have rebelled. '[MASK], what are you thinking of?' she said, and he answered in a tone, husky with pent emotion.
<name>John</name>	John	Colin	[MASK] pointed out that his capital was all invested in cattle, and that though things would be all right as long as there were good seasons, a bad one would cripple him, and he would need money to recoup his losses and buy fresh stock.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Maule	She opened the door leading from [MASK]'s room into the veranda, and went out. She stood bewilderedly, looking across the faint-lit yard to the dim veranda of the kitchen wing opposite, as she fought against the sick faintness that threatened to overcome her.
<name>Donald</name>	Donald	McKeith	'I may have to be away several days,' continued [MASK]. 'Then there's the new bore we're sinking--the water is badly wanted--cattle are dying--I can't run any risk of the bore-plant being wrecked.
<name>Tuan</name>	Tuan	Kuppi	Here, [MASK]!' The Malay boy brought in the tea-tray and she signed to him to put it on the table between the fire and the window. 'Tea,' she asked, 'or would you rather have whiskey and water?
<name>Denry</name>	Denry	Colin	[MASK],' she said, 'I want you to go and bring me my typewriter from the parlour. And then you've got to dictate "copy," about the Alexandra City Gas-Bore. Please go at once.' He obeyed.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Wombo	But he thought better of it and walked rapidly away--perhaps because she avoided his look. She supposed that he was infuriated with her because of her part in [MASK]'s escape, and she thought his anger unjust.
<name>John</name>	John	Colin	Of course she had no maid. [MASK] unpacked the cabin trunk and dressing bag and arranged things so far as he could understand his wife's dainty toilet equipments, and his mistakes made them laugh and got them over the first awkwardness of close quarter.
<name>Snell</name>	Snell	Ho	The man with the ragged beard roared out. '[MASK], you think you're going to ride over us!--you and your fine ladyship! Wot do we care about the British hairystocracy. What we're asking for is the rights of labour, and we mean to have 'em.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bridget	Then there was that business about the blacks. What a fool you were--and how brutally self-opinionated! I don't wonder [MASK] thought you an inhuman monster. Now I have said my worst, and you must take it as it is meant and forgive me.
<name>Judy</name>	Judy	Wombo	'I can't come now. I'm in the middle of my baking.' 'But don't you see? The thing is important. This poor gin has a spear through her arm--it must be attended to immediately. [MASK] is hurt too.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Biddy	'[MASK]!' He went close to her and gripped her two wrists, holding her before him while his hungry eyes seemed to be devouring her. 'It's you--it's really you. You're not dead, are you?' 'Dead!
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	McKeith	Of course you want the black-boy to escape?' 'I shall let him out myself,' she answered. 'That would only make [MASK] more angry. I have a better plan, in which you need not be implicated.'
<name>Sancho</name>	Sancho	Roxalana	Look alive, [MASK].... I named 'em when I was reading ROLLIN'S ANCIENT HISTORY, my dear ... my dear!' He looked down at the little woman by his side with deep tenderness in his blue eyes and a smile that banished the shade from his face. '
<name>Ned</name>	Ned	Colin	'You frighten me a little, [MASK]. It's as if I may any day come up before something I wasn't prepared for; and yet--I rather like it.' He smiled at her. 'I'm glad you like it, anyway.
<name>Clayton</name>	Clayton	Maule	And besides, the piano had been attacked by white ants, and the tuner had not been so far up the river for a long time. It was inspiring to learn that [MASK] added to his gifts that of getting a piano into tune.
<name>Polly</name>	Polly	Polly	Do you remember [MASK]? and how she would keep shouting out on a moonlight night 'The top of the mornin' to ye'--because we'd forgotten to put her blanket over the cage--I believe there were several occasions when you and I met in midnight dishabille and helped each other to restore tranquillity.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	McKeith	Would there be saleable cattle enough to meet demands and expenses of sinking fresh artesian bores--now that the fire had destroyed all the best grass on the run? [MASK] found no consolation in the prospect of his wife's riches.
<name>Roosevelt</name>	Roosevelt	McKeith	I went about a good deal there in bar saloons, and to men's gatherings. Naturally, I was interested in the district where, by the way, [MASK] does not appear to be over popular. Of course, I attached no great importance to the gossip then.
<name>Yashka</name>	Yashka	Cudgee	Ready, Biddy?' But [MASK], out of malice or stupidity, did not let the roans go or else someone else put a restraining hand on the reins. The man with the ragged beard roared out. '
<name>Stirling</name>	Stirling	McKeith	'Capital!' echoed [MASK] derisively. 'It's blithering irony to talk of us Leura squatters as representing capital. We're all playing a sort of battledore and shuttlecock game--tossed about between drought and plenty--boom and slump.
<name>Paula</name>	Paula	Bridget	Besides, your testimony is ridiculously inadequate. I am glad, however, that you have at last made your accusations in detail--in order, as you say--that I--and [MASK], incidentally, I suppose--should fully understand why you are adopting this attitude towards her.
<name>Madam</name>	Madam	Bridget	She was a noble-souled woman. I was not worthy of her. But unworthy as I may have been, [MASK], I deserved better of my wife than your husband deserves of you. At least, I did not deceive her.'
<name>Doyle</name>	Doyle	Steadbolt	Oddly enough, to-day when I was out with the tailing mob, one of the men repeated it--I need not say that I stopped him. He said he'd had it as a fact from a man who was a long time in your husband's employ--a man called [MASK].'
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bridget	'And your husband allowed this? But where was that barmaid-looking person who seems to keep house here for stray gentlemen--and, who has the yellow-headed and blue-eyed little boy?' [MASK]'s lip curled.
<name>Yarloo</name>	Yarloo	Oola	'Mine bring it gin belonging to me,' he announced with dignity, making an introductory gesture towards what appeared almost an excresence upon the black trunk of a gidia tree except for an old red blanket slung round one shoulder, which only half covered a woman's dusky form. 'That [MASK].
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	McKeith	[MASK]'s temper burst out. 'Damn your report. I'm a magistrate, and I've taken your report, and the blacks are in the scrub and you can go and find them for yourself if you choose. You have no warrant, remember.
<name>John</name>	John	McKeith	Outside, [MASK]'s horse was waiting. He strapped on his valise, finished ramming the tobacco into his pipe, then going behind his wife, bent downward and hastily kissed her cheek. She did not turn her head.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Joan	both said at once, and the tones in which the monosyllable was uttered and the glances accompanying it held volumes of hidden meaning. 'I haven't seen you since the Governor arrived,' [MASK] went on. 'Where have you been all these three weeks?'
<name>Quilp</name>	Quilp	McKeith	[MASK], motioning to his wife to proceed, stopped to peer at the faces of two men lying in a drunken sleep on the boards. 'Not my men, anyway,' he said, rejoining her. 'But that will keep.'
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Maule	Then she walked along the veranda to the place where she had parted from [MASK]. The rug was lying there, and she threw it round her, and waited on the steps with chattering teeth and shaking limbs. In a minute or two, he joined her.
<name>Ward</name>	Ward	Harris	But [MASK] feels some respect for my knowledge of constabulary law, which, I take it, is pretty much the same in most countries where there are white settlers and native races.' She looked up at him, letting him feel that she was relying on his astuteness and his strength.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	McKeith	She felt a distinct emotion now, but it was different--less tumultuous, and bringing her a soft sense of enfoldment. She slipped her hand gently into [MASK]'s, and they remained thus for nearly a minute without speaking. He was the first to break the silence.
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	McKeith	Such was her unconscious thought as she crunched a spray of verbena in her fingers and inhaled the scent which had always a faintly heady effect upon her imagination. She was leaning on the stone kerb of the balustrade, vague emotions stirring her, when she heard [MASK]'s step on the gravel.
<name>Woola</name>	Woola	Oola	He had broken off the long end of the spear to expedite their flight--so he explained in his queer lingo--but [MASK] had cried so much that he had not been able to draw out the rest of the shaft.
<name>Do</name>	Do	Bridget!--do	And not so long before you came out here?' 'I suppose that's true too.' '[MASK] you know what's been festering in my mind--the thought that you might be marrying me in a fit of pique--a sort of reaction.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Ninnis	There's some things it would be well for you and [MASK] to bring, and a box of surveyor's compasses would come in handy. Here followed half a page on practical matters, and then the letter ended.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Colin	Oh, [MASK] is a fine enough specimen of a pioneer in a rough country. But his rough life, his bush surroundings, and all the rest--why, he'd jar upon you in a hundred ways if you were alone with him in them.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Colin	Also of dogs barking, of men running forward. Then how [MASK] had lifted her down and half carried her into the parlour. She remembered her dazed glance round and the rushing thought of how she could soften its ugliness. Yet it had looked welcoming.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Colin	All she has to say is, that if you really wish to take this action, she will not oppose it. But [MASK], do you really wish, it? I refuse to believe that you seriously contemplate divorcing your wife.
<name>Yabber</name>	Yabber	Cudgee	The buggy was quite a smart bush turn-out--comfortable seats in front--a varnished cover, now lying back; a well behind, filled with luggage; a narrow back seat whence [MASK]--a smaller edition of Wombo--sprang down.
<name>Steelman</name>	Steelman	McKeith	A lump of salt junk and a hunk of bread were handed to the traveller. 'Now you be off, and eat that outside my paddock,' said [MASK]. 'See those gum trees over there?--You can go and organise the gum trees.'
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Harris	Well, if my grass is burned, I shall know who did it, and so will this Police Inspector. And I am a magistrate, and will have you arrested. Get on your horse, [MASK], we'll start at once, and ride alongside this chap till he's over my boundaries.'
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Maule	But they wouldn't come until after she had gone and there was no further danger of a duel taking place outside the Bachelors' Quarters.' [MASK] took her cue again and laughed as if the matter were one to jest about.
<name>Drummond</name>	Drummond	McKeith	What was your picture of the lady-wife? Describe your Ideal and I'll tell you if SHE is the least bit like it.' [MASK] smoked ruminatively for a few moments, his eyes narrowed. The lines in his forehead and round his mouth showed plainly.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Wombo	she asked, in manner equally unconciliatory. 'Well, ye know--though, I daresay, it wouldn't seem of much consequence to you--[MASK]'s gone agen the laws of the tribe, and that's a serious matter.
<name>Tristram</name>	Tristram	Bridget	But [MASK]'s soul was steel-cased also. He saw only contempt, repulsion in her gaze. The larger issues narrowed to a conflict of two egoisms. It seemed to both as though, in the space of that last quarter of an hour, they had become mortal foes.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Bridget	But for the moment,' he fingered the key agitatedly, '[MASK], you MUST let me do this thing for you. Don't refuse me that small privilege, even if you deny me all others.' She wavered--yielded. 'Very well.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Bridget	You want a kind of bondage that is the truest freedom--Love--a strong man's love, a strong man's worship. And that's what I'd give you, [MASK]. Are you angry with me for saying it?' 'No.'
<name>Umslopogaas</name>	Umslopogaas	Wombo	Now, as they pulled up at the fence, [MASK] presented a sorry spectacle--a spear wound in his left shoulder, a spear graze on his leg, his wrists handcuffed and his feet tied to the stirrup-iron with cords so tight that they cut into his tough, black flesh.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Colin	'No, no, not in the least. In fact, your description fits the Ideal Wife perfectly. Go on, [MASK]. Five foot seven and a good ten stone. How is the rest of HER? Fair or dark--her hair now--and her eyes?'
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	McKeith	The entrance to it was masked, spear-proof and had two men always on guard--there were four men at the post. [MASK] told a gruesome story of an assault by the natives, and of rifles at work through gun-holes in the zinc tower.
<name>Radley</name>	Radley	McKeith	This was always supposing that the present Ministry kept in without going to the country upon certain Labour measures unacceptable to the large land-owners, in which case it was just possible [MASK] might be thrown out of his seat.
<name>He</name>	He	McKeith	That was before I went south. Very likely he's been trying it on again, and knew I should have to get rid of him as soon as I came back.' 'Why doesn't the woman marry again?' [MASK] shrugged. '
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Biddy	Before long, I'm going to begin packing [MASK]'s things. They'll be shipped off to her all right. When the divorce business is over, I shall make new tracks, and you won't hear of me unless I come out on top.
<name>Althea</name>	Althea	Joan	You know, [MASK], I think that it might be perfectly fascinating--if one really cared for the bushman.' 'Really cared! Have you EVER really cared for any man? COULD you ever really care?' 'That's what I've been asking myself.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Mate	'No, you're not going to put that theory into practice, [MASK].... I'm not afraid. So we'll leave it at that. And now what's this about the black-boy to do with my being unjust to that Organiser?
