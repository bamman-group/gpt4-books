<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Ryan	The sergeant had a reason to live, but the reason wasn’t enough. “Tell me about your kids,” [MASK] said. “Talk to me about your kids.” “Seven—I got seven kids—I gotta, I can’t die!
<name>Blackburn</name>	Blackburn	Ramirez	Again the airfield guards were dragged to the center of the northern part of the runway, which was to have been the pickup point anyway. [MASK] redeployed his men to guard against the possibility that someone might have noticed the fire and reported it to someone else.
<name>Quiller</name>	Quiller	Robby	“Tell him for us, kill all you want.” “I’ll do that,” [MASK] said quietly. It had to be an Agency operation. A very “black” Agency operation, but it wasn’t nearly as black as they wanted it to be.
<name>Ramirez</name>	Ramirez	Clark	If I were you, seiior, I’d be very pleased to be coming home. We’re even having you met at the airport.” “Met by whom?” “By some of your friends,” [MASK] said as the wheel squeaked down on the tarmac.
<name>Christine</name>	Christine	Cortez	On the whole, it seemed like this was taking an awfully long time. When it happened, there was not the least warning. Not a whistle, not anything at all. [MASK] felt his front wheels bump upward as they got on solid pavement.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Clark	Next came a map, and [MASK] picked his brain to remember the path to that hilltop. ... It took an hour, and the last few hundred yards were a potholed nightmare of a twisted, half-paved road.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Chavez	[MASK] looked around. He could see one man, but the rest blended in with the ground. He’d worried about the khaki clothing—not as effective camouflage as what he was accustomed to—but in the field it seemed to disappear just fine.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Clark	[MASK] had forgotten about that. It would make targeting very difficult. “Can we spot in the laser from an aircraft?” “I don’t see why not. But then I land, refuel, and fly the hell out of this country forever.”
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Clark	“The people we’re—” “What people? You do not need to know. You do not want to know,” [MASK] said. “If you have a problem with that, I want you to tell me right now.”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Clark	“What do you think we’re going to do, put him on trial?” [MASK] asked over the din of the engines and the wind. “Anything else is cold-blooded murder. He’s a prisoner now, and killing prisoners is murder, remember?”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Murray	That would be enough for [MASK]. For all his experience and sophistication, he was before all things a cop. He was an adulthood beyond his graduation from the FBI Academy, when he’d thought that he and his classmates—mostly retired now—would really change the world.
<name>Harv</name>	Harv	Clark	Just how much evidence do you want to be carrying into the Senate hearing room?” [MASK] paused. “Not much danger of that, of course, but what if people see us carrying stuff and wonder what it is and why we’re carrying it?”
<name>Carlo</name>	Carlo	Cutter	Was it possible to be connected with something like this, he asked himself, and not be corrupted by it? “What [MASK] did, what you say he did—I didn’t know. I’m sorry. I’m especially sorry about those soldiers.”
<name>Chaz</name>	Chaz	Pablo	That changed [MASK]’s smile, but didn’t erase it. “We’re taking a little walk, children.” The bosun also produced a pair of handcuffs. He figured that he could handle both of them easily enough, especially stoned, but the skipper had been clear on his instructions.
<name>Marvin</name>	Marvin	Moore	Then he left the room. “He knows,” [MASK] said after the door closed. “No way.” “He knows and he wants to be out of the office.” “So what do we do about it if you’re right?”
<name>Ryan</name>	Ryan	Robby	“That’s the bunch we’re prepping for the Shoot-Ex, sir,” the senior chief explained. “So far they seem to be working all right, but . . .” “But wasn’t it you who found the problem in the first place?” [MASK] asked.
<name>Grady</name>	Grady	Shaw	It was a presidential election year, and with the coming of summer, people were thinking about conventions, not appointments. Perversely, [MASK] didn’t mind a bit. That meant that he’d be running things, and for a case of this magnitude, the Bureau needed an experienced cop at the helm.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Ryan	The cafeteria was closed, and they got coffee from a waiting-room pot. It was reheated and full of acid, but [MASK] didn’t want to go home just yet, and was late remembering that he’d driven his own car in.
<name>Thorn</name>	Thorn	Ding	[MASK] crossed the clearing as quickly as safety allowed, scanning ahead with his low-light goggles. Again using compass and landmarks, he was able to travel rapidly, now that he had a feel for the country.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Cutter	“Thanks, but I can be there in a few hours.” “Weather’s breaking down around that area, sir,” the major warned him. “That’s okay.” [MASK] left the room and walked back to his car.
<name>He</name>	He	Robby	[MASK] asked. “Checking out performance on a new piece of ordnance. I’m afraid I can’t say any more than that.” “One of them, eh?” “ ’Fraid so,” the man said, examining the coffee stain on his knee.
<name>Raptor</name>	Raptor	Bronco	[MASK] was just too good, and in his Eagle, he was nearly invincible. When he got within four hundred yards, his finger depressed the button for a fraction of a second. A line of green tracers lanced through the sky.
<name>abort</name>	abort	HIFR	If he can’t do it, he plans to [MASK]. Can you handle that, over.” “That’s affirmative, we can sure as hell try. Give me an ETA, over.” “Estimate six-zero minutes.”
<name>Ryan</name>	Ryan	Chavez	[MASK] didn’t trade words with him, but sensed that this man had been around the block a few times. It was, he belatedly realized, the biggest goddamned helicopter he’d ever seen. The flight engineer made one final check before going forward and plugging his helmet into the intercom system.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Cortez	They wore uniforms and pistol belts and seemed to be acting like real cops. Under [MASK]’s supervision, the real search for survivors had been completed already, and the two people found taken off, along with most of the surviving security guards and almost all of the firearms.
<name>Chavez</name>	Chavez	Cortez	The Co- lombians might. Some senior Colombian military officer, operating entirely on his own ... or in the pay of the yanquis? That was possible. It couldn’t be a government operation, [MASK] was sure. There were too many informants there, too.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Johns	Out.” [MASK] looked around. He didn’t feel like a pilot now. His aircraft was down. He was safe. It was time to get out and do something else. He couldn’t get out his door without risking a fall overboard and ...
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Felix	He hadn’t been there when the decision to whack the Director had been made. And he would have recommended against it. Why lash out when you have just developed a good intel source? No, that wasn’t professional at all. So, [MASK], how do you feel about all this?
<name>Mitchell</name>	Mitchell	Willis	The Pave Low labored upward, reaching seventy-seven hundred feet, but that was where it stopped, and then it started descending, fighting every foot but gradually losing altitude. “As we bum off more gas . . .” [MASK] said hopefully.
<name>Ricardo</name>	Ricardo	Escobedo	What was supposed to have been a discussion of unexpected happenings in their smuggling operations was suddenly sidetracked onto something far more troubling. It was especially troubling for [MASK], moreover, since he’d been one of the three Cartel members who had urged this money-laundering scheme on his colleagues.
<name>McClane</name>	McClane	Tony	[MASK] and his partner had just come back on duty in the van, and there was a telex clipped to the wall, telling them to expect some activity on the cellular-phone circuits at about 1800 Zulu time. They weren’t disappointed.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Ryan	“Ninety minutes.” The MH-53J was far larger than the CH-46 that had nearly ended [MASK]’s life at twenty-three, but no less frightening to him. He looked at the single rotor and remembered that they were making a long, over-water flight.
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Senorita	Her eyes went wide and white as she saw him—or more properly, didn’t see him, just a melange of camouflage paint that looked like something from a horror movie. “[MASK], you have nothing to fear from me. I am a soldier.
<name>Ramirez</name>	Ramirez	Vega	As soon as it appeared that fire might be returned, [MASK] opened up, transfixing that man with tracers from his machine gun, then shifting fire to two more armed men. One of them got a couple of rounds off, but they went high.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Oso	“Yeah, that makes sense, [MASK]. The security guys were all around the airplane. They’re spreading out now.” He grabbed his radio. “Captain—” “I see it. Heads up in case we have to move out.”
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Clark	There was much to admire. It was a pity that the economy hadn’t developed along proper lines, but [MASK] wasn’t a social theorist. He, too, was a child of his country’s working class, and in the important things working people are the same everywhere.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Jack	“[MASK], we’re friends, and ain’t nothing gonna change that. I know you’d never do anything this dumb, but—” “I don’t know what you’re talking about. I don’t fucking know, okay?
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Ritter	If there were a way to bag these jokers without hurting innocent people, we’d use it—but there isn’t.” To say that [MASK] was amazed didn’t begin to explain matters. This guy was supposed to be a professional military officer.
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Clark	“We are in the treeline north of the objective.” “Toss your strobe to mark your position.” “Okay, done.” [MASK] turned his head and the goggles showed the infrared strobe blinking on the open ground, thirty feet from the treeline.
<name>John</name>	John	Escobedo	His father would have been seventy-five last week, he knew, except for ... but the people who’d ended his father’s life had paid a savage price for their crime, along with all of their families, mostly at [MASK]’s own hand.
<name>Andrew</name>	Andrew	Jack	[MASK] asked himself in surprise. It should have occurred to him immediately, of course, but he was not yet used to being a senior executive. With nothing to do, his mind went along that tangent for several minutes. The conclusion was an obvious one.
<name>Wheeler</name>	Wheeler	CIA	[MASK] doesn’t have to tell them until forty-eight hours after such an operation begins, and, for administrative purposes, the operation didn’t actually begin until yesterday afternoon.” “They don’t find out,” the President said.
<name>Rangers</name>	Rangers	Chavez	The objective of such missions was generally the same. Unable to match a heavy formation force-on-force, [MASK] trained to do the close, nasty work that has always characterized light infantrymen: raids and ambushes, infiltration and intelligence gathering.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Wilcox	“Weather update. That squall line’ll be here no later’n twenty-one hundred. The squalls are upgraded some. We can expect gusts up to forty knots. Gonna be a fair blow, sir.” “Any problem for [MASK] and the yacht?”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Ramirez	But emotions are not the same as intellect. It was also true, though [MASK] didn’t think along these precise lines, that historically there is no way to predict which officers are suited for combat operations and which are not.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Clark	By the way, have you forgotten those two bombs? I believe you were there.” “That was—” “Different?” [MASK] chuckled. “That’s what they always say, ‘But that’s different.’
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Murray	All we do know is that there was a cold million dollars in used twenties and fifties aboard the good ship Empire Builder. So much cash could only mean one thing—but that wasn’t true. It could mean lots of things, [MASK] thought.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Chavez	That lesson had come behind a white-painted barracks at the hands of a drill sergeant whose face was as black as a jungle night. But [MASK]’s life had never known an easy lesson; as a result he hadn’t learned to resent the hard ones.
<name>John</name>	John	Chavez	[MASK], on the other hand, took great pride that he performed his duties for love of country and, though he didn’t quite think of it in those terms, for love of his fellow soldiers. His earlier uneasiness at the departure of the helicopter faded away.
<name>Laurel</name>	Laurel	Weber	“All of them,” [MASK] repeated. “I didn’t know,” she said. “I haven’t seen a paper or turned on a TV in—since Friday night. Where—?” “Your kids went out to the movies.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Clark	[MASK] was more than surprised by that. “Then I can do it. What about the kids we have running around in the jungle?” “We’re pulling them out tonight.” “To be reinserted where?”
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Chavez	“But I still say that getting laid is the best workout there is.” “You got that one right,” [MASK] agreed with a laugh. “All those unused muscle groups, as the free-weight guys say.”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Murray	The cleanup crew there is pretty good—too damned good for our purposes, but our guys are still working on it.” “Everything but a picture on the bastard. Everything but a picture,” [MASK] repeated.
<name>John</name>	John	Jack	He couldn’t entirely escape reality, of course. Clipped to his belt was a portable telephone whose electronic chiming was noticeable over the rumble of the tractor. [MASK] switched off as he hit the activation button on the phone. “Hello.”
<name>Dirk</name>	Dirk	Ryan	“Sir, do you want me to talk like a politician, which I am not, or like what I am?” “Tell it straight, son. That’s one of the rarest pleasures a man in my position has.” [MASK] missed that signal entirely.
<name>Chet</name>	Chet	Ding	“Maybe. Looks like rain, [MASK]. You suppose maybe they’ll go home ’steada gettin’ wet like us fools?” “We’ll know in an hour or two.” “It’s going to blow visibility to shit, too.”
<name>Quiller</name>	Quiller	Cortez	[MASK] lifted a reference book from his library shelf and confirmed the fact that Octol was almost exclusively a military explosive .. . and was used as a triggering agent for nuclear devices. That evoked a short bark of a laugh. It also explained a few things.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Russo	Then again, He might not. . . .” “I can tell you everything,” [MASK] said. “I ain’t int’restedr “But you can’t—” “Sure I can. What do you think I do for a livin’, boy?”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Clark	[MASK]’s hand came up and fired into the man’s forehead at a range of five feet. Before the leader had even started to fall, the second was also dead from the same cause. Without pause he moved around the right side of the truck.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Clark	“Holy shit!” He set the pile down on the desk and paced a bit, staring out of the windows at the aircraft sitting in the hangar. “Okay,” he said to himself. [MASK] had never been one to dally over making plans.
<name>Chalino</name>	Chalino	Chavez	“Why tell anybody? I’m a little worried about [MASK]—he’s one of my people, and I worry a little about him, but he’s one good fucking soldier. Far as I’m concerned, he can kill all the druggies he wants.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Wegener	Drugs. Drugs were not something that [MASK] thought a great deal about. For him drugs were something a doctor prescribed, that you took in accordance with the directions on the bottle until they were gone, and then you tossed the bottle.
<name>Wheeler</name>	Wheeler	Congress	“You authorized it. It is my duty under the law to report on these matters to [MASK]. Before I do so, I felt it necessary to notify you. I asked the two congressmen here to witness my doing so.”
<name>Confusion</name>	Confusion	Chavez	Confusion is the ally of the prepared. More men rushed forward into the killing zone to see what was happening, wondering who had shot at whom. [MASK] and all the others counted to ten before coming back up.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Chavez	[MASK] went back to the line for some hash-browns. He’d heard that carbohydrates were also good for energy, and now that he was almost accustomed to the altitude, the thought of grease for breakfast didn’t bother him that much. Things were going well.
<name>Heinrich</name>	Heinrich	Stuart	wurst and sauerkraut, which went well with beer. [MASK] stuck with stories about his new Admiral, the Chief Counsel of the Coast Guard, in which legal officers are also line officers, expected to know how to drive ships and command men.
<name>Johnson</name>	Johnson	Riley	[MASK] went inside with his backup. The lieutenant got to the two men in under a minute. It was odd to see them talking, but not to hear what they were saying. . . . Somebody said something.
<name>He</name>	He	Clark	He was too tired, too wrung out to hide his emotions. “Come on. I’ll buy you a cup of coffee and tell you a few stories about the old guy.” [MASK] was sad, but he was a man accustomed to death.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Murray	“So he did it, sure as hell,” [MASK] replied as he reached for his coffee. “But taking it to trial would be nasty. He’s a clever guy, and his crew backed him up. If you read up on his file, you’ll see why.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Larson	“You are not [MASK],” the man with the submachine gun said. “I am his friend. He is flying. Here is your man. You should have something for us.” “You do not need to leave,” said the man with the briefcase.
<name>Hardy</name>	Hardy	Cutter	Besides, what with that hurricane chasing around south of here, we’re getting ready to move a lot of our birds in case it heads this way.” [MASK] could have demanded the information right then and there.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Jack	[MASK] had attended these meetings as a matter of routine for years, but now he was the man behind the desk. He knew how the meetings were supposed to be run, and he didn’t break the pattern. Business was still business.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Jackson	Whoever set up security on the op could have done a better job, sir.” “[MASK], you’re going to have to forgive me, but I just spent five and a half hours sitting too close to the engines on a beat-up old 727.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Bright	[MASK] got it and had a drink out of sheer curiosity. “Salt and electrolytes, to keep you alert,” the pilot explained a few seconds later. “You’re FBI, right?” “Correct.” “What gives?” “Can’t say.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jack	They got there too late. [MASK] opened the door to see the bed covered with a sheet. The doctors had already left. “I was there at the end. He went out easy,” one of the CIA people told him.
<name>Chigurh</name>	Chigurh	Escobedo	He handed the glasses over. It was time for a little machismo. He opened the car door and pulled out a few bottles of Perrier—[MASK] liked the stuff1. He opened them by inserting the bottlecaps into bullet holes in the trunk lid and snapping down.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Larson	He sure as hell needed to think now. In a minute he decided that it was time for a little initiative. “Come on, [MASK], we’re going to take a little ride.” That was easily accomplished.
<name>Detective</name>	Detective	Bright	[MASK] had returned to the home of the victims for as long as his mind kept telling him that something else had to be there. “How’d you find the safe?” “The guy had one of those Rubbermaid sheets for his swivel chair to ride on.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Clark	“Come on!” It was stupid to lead them with only a silenced pistol in his hand, [MASK] knew, but he was in command, and the good commanders led from the front. They covered the two hundred yards to the house in thirty seconds.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Wegener	They were too close to use the Bofors. [MASK] ordered the machine gun to fire across the Empire Builder's bow. The .50-caliber crackled and thundered for a five-round burst. Even if they hadn’t seen the splashes, the noise was unmistakable.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Ryan	“Yeah, somebody had some pretty good intel on this.” [MASK] nodded. “This is where I came in. . . .” “I don’t think there’s a street agent in the Bureau who doesn’t love that man.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jack	Your duty is to serve the country, [MASK], not just the people you happen to like.” A blow from a professional boxer could not have stung worse. “Yes, sir. You’re right. I still have a lot to learn.”
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	PJ	[MASK] went in the opposite direction, heading for the base meteorological office. The weather for tonight was disappointing: light winds, clear skies, and a crescent moon. Perfect flying weather for everyone else, it was not what special-ops people hoped for.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Cutter	I just gave you an order, mister.” The President walked to the windows. “It wasn’t supposed to be this way,” he muttered. [MASK] knew what the real issue was, of course. The opposition’s political convention would begin shortly.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Greer	“If you handle that as well as you’ve handled this briefing, we ought to get along just fine. Shame about [MASK]. Hope things work out.” There was about as much emotion in his voice as one needed to ask directions.
<name>Johnson</name>	Johnson	Wegener	Forward he heard the metallic clash as a round was racked into the 40mm cannon. Used to be we pulled alongside to render assistance. Now we load up, [MASK] thought. Goddamned drugs . . . “I see him,” a lookout said.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Morales	[MASK] knew what had hit the car—weapons designed to destroy tanks. Real ones. For those inside, the only remarkable thing was that you could tell that they had once been human. There was nothing anyone could do, except a priest... or rabbi.
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Harvey	“That’s the best deal in town, boys,” the lieutenant told them. “You want us to kill the motherfuckers?” It was [MASK] who asked this question, disappointing his brother, who thought of himself as the smart one.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Robby	[MASK] lifted it. Shaped much like the German helmet of World War II, it was made of Kevlar, with a cloth camouflage cover around it, and around that, held in place by a green elasticized cloth band, was a medusa-like collection of knotted cloth strips.
<name>Obama</name>	Obama	Fowler	Friday I got to brief [MASK], like you did the last time.” “What do you think of him?” “I think he needs some help on foreign policy.” A smile: “So do I. Gives a nice speech, though.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Clark	“Here we go.” [MASK] took the last turn in the road and slowed, taking the car right up to the two guards. They took their weapons off sling and assumed a more aggressive stance as he slowed the vehicle. “Excuse me, I am lost.”
<name>Cabrillo</name>	Cabrillo	Meade	“Tell [MASK] that we finally caught a frozen rope down the left-field line.” A “frozen rope” was the current NSA nickname for a very important signal intercept. It was baseball season, and the Baltimore Orioles were coming back.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Decks	“Thanks.” They had to wait five more minutes for the photographs. [MASK] had been cleared for this case, but even priority cases took time, much to the annoyance of everyone. The technician—actually a section chief—arrived with the moist prints.
<name>Rearden</name>	Rearden	Jack	“I can remember when it was in far worse shape, Governor,” [MASK] said, grateful for having been let off the hook. “So why not ease back, cut arms, like I propose?” “I think it’s too soon for that.”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Shaw	He thinks they’re going to be—hell, he thinks—” “Yeah,” [MASK] observed. “If so, we now have a probable violation of the law. Conspiracy to commit murder. Proving it might be a little tough, though.”
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Ryan	By that time, [MASK] was back at his desk, looking slightly wan, everyone thought, but everyone had heard that he’d been sick the night before. Something he ate. He now knew what to do: nothing.
<name>Case</name>	Case	O’Day	“What?” “It’s been wiped, not erased or initialized, but wiped. Probably with a little toy magnet.” “Shit,” [MASK] observed. He knew enough about computers to realize that the magnetically stored data was destroyed by magnetic interference.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Robby	“Once was enough,” [MASK] answered soberly. “I leave that close-quarter crap to idiots like you.” “Yeah, well, last night we were the forward element for the battalion. My lead squad went in beautiful.
<name>John</name>	John	Untiveros	[MASK]’s wife and two young children had been in the opposite side of the house on the second floor, watching a taped movie. The VCR, still plugged in and on play, was found right before the bodies.
<name>Archer</name>	Archer	Jack	“I need some guidance.” “About what?” “About what is probably an illega’ operation—several of them, as a matter of fact.” “How illegal?” “Murder,” [MASK] said as undramatically as he could manage.
