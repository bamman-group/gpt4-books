<name>her</name>	her	Isidore	The woman wore a fashionable wrap, high shiny boots, and tapered pants; the man lounged in a rumpled shirt and stained trousers, giving an air of almost deliberate vulgarity. He smiled at [MASK] but his bright, small eyes remained oblique.
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Mercer	Aloud he said, “[MASK]!” Across the landscape weeds advanced; weeds corkscrewed their way into the walls around him and worked the walls until the weeds became their own spore. The spore expanded, split, and burst within the corrupted steel and shards of concrete that had formerly been walls.
<name>Rachael</name>	Rachael	Rick	After making a jot of notation, [MASK] continued, turning to the eighth question of the Voigt-Kampff profile scale. “You have a little boy and he shows you his butterfly collection, including his killing • » jar. “I’d take him to the doctor.”
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Rachael	He was puzzled. “How old are you?” he asked; that might be a factor. “I’m eighteen,” [MASK] said. “Okay; so this man closes the door and puts his arm around me. What does he say?”
<name>Raylan</name>	Raylan	Iran	“I have a right to participate in the decision, the most important acquisition we’ll ever—” “I wanted it to be a surprise,” he said. “You made some bounty money today,” [MASK] said accusingly.
<name>Rick</name>	Rick	Rick	In actuality it had probably been a manual laborer, a field hand, with aspirations for something better. Do androids dream? [MASK] asked himself. Evidently; that’s why they occasionally kill their employers and flee here. A better life, without servitude.
<name>Deckard</name>	Deckard	Rachael	“By doing what?” “Well, by one of us coming along with you. When you go out looking for them.” “Why? What would you add?” [MASK] said, “The Nexus-6s would be wary at being approached by a human.
<name>Deckard</name>	Deckard	Dave	No test is; the Voigt scale, altered three years ago by Kampff, is all we have.” He paused, pondering. “[MASK] considered it accu- rate. Maybe it is. But I would suggest this, before you take out after these six.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Rick	As if hearing himself say it meant nothing; he had a dubious attitude toward his own words; they didn’t become real, not until she agreed. “It’s over,” she said. “God, what a marathon assignment,” [MASK] said.
<name>Dagny</name>	Dagny	Rachael	Our limitation again, I guess.” “I doubt if it works as often or as well as you say,” he said thickly. “But it has with you.” “We’ll see.” “I already know,” [MASK] said.
<name>Andy</name>	Andy	Rick	As he drove he hauled out the now wrinkled notes, found her so-called “age.” Twenty-eight, the sheet read. Judged by appearance, which, with andys, was the only useful standard. It’s a good thing I know something about opera, [MASK] reflected.
<name>John</name>	John	Isidore	“I lifted you from the tomb world just now and I will continue to lift you until you lose interest and want to quit. But you will have to stop searching for me because I will never stop searching for you.” “I didn’t like that about the whisky,” [MASK] said.
<name>Deckard</name>	Deckard	Rick	Except for the extreme ones, such as those dealing with human pelts used decoratively... the truly pathological ones.” “Meaning?” [MASK] said, “I’m capable of feeling empathy for at least specific, certain androids. Not for all of them
<name>Deckard</name>	Deckard	Garland	“I don’t have the foggiest idea,” [MASK] said remotely. “It ought, from an abstract, intellectual viewpoint, to be interesting. He may kill me, kill himself; maybe you, too. He may kill everyone he can, human and android alike.
<name>Field Guide</name>	Field Guide	Sidney	For some reason the dust had struck that species almost as hard as it had the birds—of which almost none survived now. In an automatic response he brought out his much-thumbed [MASK]’s and looked up raccoon with all the sub-listings.
<name>Deckard</name>	Deckard	Mercer	[MASK] is right; I have to get this over with. But, he thought, I don’t think I can. Two andys together—this isn’t a moral question, it’s a practical question. I probably cant retire them, he realized.
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Garland	Why didn’t I suspect—I mean, enough to do something?” “Maybe it isn’t that long. Maybe they only recently infiltrated this building.” “They’ve been here all the time. [MASK] has been my superior from the start, throughout my three years.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Rachael	No emotional awareness, no feeling-sense of the actual meaning of what she said. Only the hollow, formal, intellectual definitions of the separate terms. And, more, [MASK] had begun to tease him. Imperceptibly she had passed from lamenting her condition to taunting him about his.
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Iran	Going to the vidphone, [MASK] said, “Why are you afraid? They’re not repossessing the goat, not yet.” She started to lift the receiver. “It’s the department,” he said. “Say I’m not here.”
<name>Iran</name>	Iran	Iran	He stretched out on the bed, dust sifting from his clothes and hair onto the white sheets. No need to turn on the mood organ, [MASK] realized as she pressed the button which made the windows of the bedroom opaque. The gray light of day disappeared.
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Rachael	“Is that a loss?” He finished undressing her. Exposed her pale, cold loins. “Is it a loss?” [MASK] repeated. “I don’t really know; I have no way to tell. How does it feel to have a child?
<name>She</name>	She	Iran	He kissed her. “You’ve been waiting up here all this time?” “Only for half an hour. That’s when it happened; half an hour ago.” [MASK], gently, kissed him back. “It’s so awful.
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Cortot	It found none. “Quite frankly, we believed [MASK],” the research chief said in his dry, pedantic voice, “and we spent a good deal of time examining publicity pictures of bit players once employed by the now defunct Hollywood movie industry.”
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Pris	In panic he thought, I’m dependent on them. Thank god they stayed. It would require two trips to transfer [MASK]’s possessions to the apartment above. Hoisting the TV set, he decided to take it first, then the suitcases and remaining clothes.
<name>Rick</name>	Rick	Rachael	I could tell. You’re both in dreadful shape.” “It’s because of my goat,” he said. “Not the androids; [MASK] was wrong—I didn’t have any trouble retiring them.
<name>obsessed</name>	obsessed	Mercer	This hill, he thought. This dust and these many stones, each one different from all the others. “I’m afraid,” he said, “that I can’t stop being [MASK]. Once you start it’s too late to back off.”
<name>Holly</name>	Holly	Isidore	“Myself, thanks.” “You’d go into those apartments alone?” He could not believe it. “Why not?” Again she shuddered nervously, grimacing in awareness of saying something wrong. [MASK] said, “I’ve tried it. Once.
<name>Tom Brady</name>	Tom Brady	Mercer	And there is even some evidence that the scraggly weeds and dismal, sterile soil—perhaps even the stones hurled at [MASK] by unseen alleged parties—are equally faked. It is quite possible in fact that the ‘stones’ are made of soft plastic, causing no authentic wounds.”
<name>Deckard</name>	Deckard	Bryant	If you can’t pick out all the humanoid robots, then we have no reliable analytical tool and we’ll never find the ones who’re already escaping. If your scale factors out a human subject, identifies him as android—” [MASK] beamed at him icily.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Rick	“Thanks, [MASK],” she said wanly. “Remember, though; don’t think about it, just do it. Don’t pause and be philosophical, because from a philosophical standpoint it’s dreary. For us both.”
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Buster	It’s time to hear [MASK]’s big sensational expose, which is finally almost arrived.” She stooped to read the dial of her watch by the radio’s light. “Very soon now. Did you already know about it?
<name>Bryant</name>	Bryant	Rachael	He nodded. “How many androids escaped this time?” [MASK] inquired. Presently he said, “Eight. Originally. Two have already been retired, by someone else; not me.” “You get how much for each android?”
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Rick	That would make your monthly payment, after a reasonable down—” “You’ll have to lower the price you’re asking,” [MASK] said. “Knock off two thousand and I won’t trade anything in; I’ll come up with cash.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Rick	“I’m familiar with police procedure.” “Here’s your briefcase,” the officer said; he handed it back to [MASK]. “Come into my office ... I’d like to talk with you further.”
<name>Iran</name>	Iran	Rick	“He has something he wants to say to you,” she said. Going over to the empathy box, she quickly seated herself and once more gripped the twin handles. She became involved almost at once. [MASK] stood holding the phone receiver, conscious of her mental departure.
<name>Deckard</name>	Deckard	Rick	The saying currently blabbed by posters, TV ads, and government junk mail, ran: “Emigrate or degenerate! The choice is yours!” Very true, [MASK] thought as he opened the gate to his little pasture and approached his electric sheep.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Rick	“Like I said—” “I’ll take about three minutes,” [MASK] said. “I want to see it. Every morning I check in for work there; I want to see that it’s been abandoned for years, as you say.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Rick	“I had him on the line,” [MASK] said. “I talked to him; he said he’d talk to you. It must be phone trouble; the connection must have been broken somewhere along the way.
<name>the man</name>	the man	Isidore	Anyhow, all of a sudden the momentary verbal exchange had ceased; the cat’s owner had gone roaring up into the sky in his custom new-model handsome hovercar. And the man constituted a new customer. To the cat, [MASK] said, “Can you hang on until we reach the shop?”
<name>Deckard</name>	Deckard	Rick	She eyed him from beneath long black lashes, probably artificial. [MASK] said, “A humanoid robot is like any other machine; it can fluctuate between being a benefit and a hazard very rapidly. As a benefit it’s not our problem.”
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Iran	Now we can admit to everybody that the sheep’s false.” 1 59 “No need to do that,” he said cautiously. “But we can” [MASK] persisted. “See, now we have nothing to hide; what we’ve always wanted has come true.
<name>his wife</name>	his wife	Polokov	You’re not from the police department; you’re a sexual deviant.” “You can look at my identification.” He reached toward his coat pocket. His hand, he saw, had again begun to shake, as it had with [MASK].
<name>Deckard</name>	Deckard	Rick	“That phases out laser emanation and spreads the beam into ordinary light.” “Then I’ll have to break your pencil neck.” The android dropped the device and, with a snarl, grabbed with both hands for [MASK]’s throat.
<name>J.R.</name>	J.R.	Pris	All that research? Hey, answer.” She prodded him anxiously. “He’s upset,” [MASK] said. “Because he has an empathy box. In the other room. Do you use it, J. R.?”
<name>Van Ness</name>	Van Ness	Horrified	“A chickenhead.” “But I have a job. I drive a truck for—” [MASK], he discovered he had forgotten the name. “—a pet hospital,” he said. “The Van Ness Pet Hospital,” he said.
<name>Abaddon</name>	Abaddon	Mercer	Because you’re still here and I’m still here.” [MASK] indicated with a sweep of his hand the barren, rising hillside, the familiar place. “I lifted you from the tomb world just now and I will continue to lift you until you lose interest and want to quit.
<name>Bub</name>	Bub	Roy	“You’re a credit to your race.” “If he was an android,” [MASK] said heartily, “he’d turn us in about ten tomorrow morning. He’d take off for his job and that would be it. I’m overwhelmed with admiration.”
<name>Deckard</name>	Deckard	Rick	Isn’t he clever? He’s going to destroy his own life and mine and possibly yours.” “You androids,” [MASK] said, “don’t exactly cover for each other in times of stress.”
<name>Yife</name>	Yife	Rachael	Suddenly she brushed at her coat, violently. “Yife! I got a burning ash from my cigarette—there, it’s gone.” She sank back against the seat, relaxing. He said nothing. “That goat,” [MASK] said.
<name>David</name>	David	Rick	“Listen,” she said to [MASK]. Some of the color had returned to her face; once more she looked—at least briefly—alive. “Buy me a reproduction of that picture I was looking at when you found me.
<name>Fanny</name>	Fanny	Iran	“Can we let her out? Put her where the sheep is?” “She ought to be tethered,” he said. “For a few days at least.” [MASK] said in an odd little voice, “ ‘My life is love and pleasure.’
<name>Deckard</name>	Deckard	Sloat	"Owners who get to love their animals,” [MASK] said somberly, “go to pieces. I’m glad we’re not usually involved with real animals. You realize that actual animal vets have to make calls like that all the time?”
<name>Stephanie</name>	Stephanie	Iran	They’re not repossessing the goat, not yet.” She started to lift the receiver. “It’s the department,” he said. “Say I’m not here.” He headed for the bedroom. “Hello,” [MASK] said, into the receiver.
<name>Mrs. Clutterbuck</name>	Mrs. Clutterbuck	Someone”—Iran	“If it gets sick within ninety days the dealer—” “It didn’t get sick. [MASK] cleared her throat and went on huskily—“someone came here, got the goat out of its cage, and dragged it to the edge of the roof.”
<name>Liberace</name>	Liberace	Isidore	The studio audience laughed, and [MASK] heard a sprinkling of handclaps. “And I’ll reveal my carefully documented expose from up there—that expose coming exactly ten hours from now!” “Ent me, too, dahlink!”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Rick	Don’t let it get you down; you’ll heal. What’s happened is that you’ve got your order reversed. Don’t kill her—or be present when she’s killed—and then feel physically attracted. Do it the other way.” [MASK] stared at him.
<name>Eidolon</name>	Eidolon	Resch	“Anything else?” “This building is android-infested.” [MASK] said introspectively, “That’s going to make it hard for you and me to get out of here. Nominally I have the authority to leave any time I want, of course.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Isidore	It’s hard for us to grasp that, but it’s true.” To [MASK] she said, standing very close to him once again and peering up at him, “You could get a lot of money by turning us in; do you realize that?”
<name>Themis</name>	Themis	Roy	It wasn’t conceived for habitation, at least not within the last billion years. It’s so old. You feel it in the stones, the terrible old age. Anyhow, at first I got drugs from [MASK]; I lived for that new synthetic painkiller, that silenizine.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Rick	“I wouldn’t worry if I were you,” [MASK] said as the two Rosens led him down a highly illuminated wide corridor. He himself felt quietly content. This moment, more than any other which he could remember, pleased him.
<name>He</name>	He	Rick	He got into bed. Afterward they enjoyed a great luxury: [MASK] had room service bring up coffee. He sat for a long time within the arms of a green, black, and gold leaf lounge chair, sipping coffee and meditating about the next few hours.
<name>Sharks</name>	Sharks	Sheep	“My goat is probably asleep by now,” he said. “Or maybe goats are nocturnal. Some animals never sleep. [MASK] never do, not that I could detect; whenever you look at them they’re looking back. Expecting to be fed.”
<name>Rachael</name>	Rachael	Rachael	“You don’t really mean it,” [MASK] said. “You’ll never call me. You don’t realize how agile an illegal escaped Nexus-6 is, how impossible it’ll be for you. We feel we owe you this because of—you know.
<name>Han Solo</name>	Han Solo	Dave	“One of those on [MASK]’s list managed to call in and get a so-called patrolman out here. I can’t seem to prove to him who I am; he says he knows all the bounty hunters in the department and he’s never heard of me.”
<name>Alpha</name>	Alpha	D	At setting C it overcomes the threshold barring consciousness, as it does for me.” Friendlily, because he felt well-disposed toward the world—his setting had been at [MASK]—he patted her bare, pale shoulder.
<name>Pris</name>	Pris	Rachael	“Would you ever go to bed with an android again?” “If it was a girl. If she resembled you.” [MASK] said, “Do you know what the lifespan of a humanoid robot such as myself is? I’ve been in existence two years.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Sidney	“No.” She smiled, and he saw that she had small even teeth, as white as her eyes and hair were black. “But [MASK]’s listing,” he said, trying to show her the catalogue. To prove it to her.
<name>Inspector</name>	Inspector	Rachael	Both gauges immediately registered past the green and onto the red; the needles swung violently and then subsided. “I wouldn’t accept it,” [MASK] said. “Also I’d report the person who gave it to me to the police.”
<name>Zuckerman</name>	Zuckerman	Rick	“Yes, sir,” a nattily dressed new animal salesman said to him chattily as he stood gaping with a sort of glazed, meek need at the displays. “See anything you like?” [MASK] said, “I see a lot I like.
<name>Mal</name>	Mal	Pris	“Nothing.” She halted at the picture window, drew the drapes back, and gazed morosely out. “If you think they’re looking for you—” he began. “It’s a dream,” [MASK] said.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Rick	The creature stood on a bridge and no one else was present; the creature screamed in isolation. Cut off by—or despite—its outcry. “He did a woodcut of this,” [MASK] said, reading the card tacked below the painting.
<name>Isidore</name>	Isidore	Isidore	“I c-c-can’t use the vidphone,” [MASK] protested, his heart laboring. “Because I’m hairy, ugly, dirty, stooped, snaggle-toothed, and gray. And also I feel sick from the radiation; I think I’m going to die.”
<name>Deckard</name>	Deckard	Milt	And then, in the shop, [MASK] can charge it back up. Deftly, he ran his fingers along the pseudo bony spine. The cables should be about here. Damn expert workmanship; so absolutely perfect an imitation. Cables not apparent even under close scrutiny.
<name>Rachael</name>	Rachael	Rick	It’ll have to be tomorrow.” “Android vengeance,” [MASK] said. “What?” “Because I tripped you up on the Voigt-Kampff scale.” “Do you think that?” Wide-eyed, she said, “Really?”
<name>Dr. Ames</name>	Dr. Ames	Isidore	You’d almost think it was real, [MASK] observed as he headed back to the Van Ness Pet Hospital—that carefully misnamed little enterprise which barely existed in the tough, competitive field of false-animal repair. The cat, in its travail, groaned.
<name>he</name>	he	Rick	She’s flown; we won’t find her at the museum.” “Maybe,” [MASK] said. They arrived at the museum building, noted on which floor the Munch exhibit could be found, and ascended. Shortly, they wandered amid paintings and woodcuts.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Rachael	“Two-part. You are watching an old movie on TV, a movie from before the war. It shows a banquet in progress; the guests are enjoying raw oysters.” “Ugh,” [MASK] said; the needles swung swiftly.
<name>he</name>	he	Polokov	Only semi-ruined furniture, a place of kipple and decay. In fact no personal articles: what greeted him consisted of unclaimed debris which [MASK] had inherited when he took the apartment and which in leaving he had abandoned to the next—if any—tenant.
<name>James</name>	James	Rick	“May I ask if this represents a new price bracket for you?” “Well, I don’t usually carry around three thou,” [MASK] conceded. “I thought as much, sir, when you mentioned rabbits. The thing about rabbits, sir, is that everybody has one.
<name>Daedalus</name>	Daedalus	Mercer	Even the wind destroys them, he perceived. At this stage. Just before time ceases. I wish I could remember how to climb up from here, he thought. Looking up, he saw nothing to grasp. 1 97 [MASK], he said aloud.
<name>Deckard</name>	Deckard	Rick	And if there’s no way you can identify an android there’s no way you can collect your bounty. So if the Voigt-Kampff scale has to be abandoned—” “A new scale,” [MASK] said, “will replace it.
<name>Bartleby</name>	Bartleby	Isidore	Interesting question, [MASK] thought. But whom could he compare notes with? He lived alone in this deteriorating, blind building of a thousand uninhabited apartments, which like all its counterparts, fell, day by day, into greater entropic ruin.
<name>he</name>	he	Rick	“Then what’s wrong?” “Okay,” [MASK] said. “I’ll get over there.” He started to hang up the phone. “Let me know as soon as you get results. I’ll be here in my office.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Isidore	“But what?” [MASK] said, “We can’t win.” “Why not?” The girl stepped into the hall, closing the door behind her; arms folded self-consciously before her small high breasts, she faced him, eager to understand.
<name>Din Djarin</name>	Din Djarin	Rachael	To get your owl back immediately. I won’t agree to that; it’s too dangerous.” “You’re a bounty hunter,” [MASK] said. “You can handle a laser gun—in fact you’re carrying one right now.
<name>Deckard</name>	Deckard	Deckard	“To find yourself a bounty hunter’s assignment all of a sudden. Or whatever it is you are, [MASK].” He pressed a key on his desk intercom and said, “Send one of the bounty hunters in here; I don’t care which one.
<name>Hal</name>	Hal	Iran	He waited, canny enough not to commit himself until his wife had agreed to follow suit. “My schedule for today lists a six-hour self-accusatory depression,” [MASK] said. “What? Why did you schedule that?”
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Rachael	“You can have the owl,” [MASK] said, still eyeing him. “The one up on the roof. Scrappy. But we will want to mate it if we can get our hands on a male. And any offspring will be ours; that has to be absolutely understood.”
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Rick	“Were exactly one thousand under book. Now, your down payment—” “I’ll think it over,” [MASK] said, “and call you back.” He started to hang up. “Your name, sir?” the salesman asked alertly.
<name>her ear</name>	her ear	Rick	A pause as she listened and then she held the receiver up to [MASK]. “He has something he wants to say to you,” she said. Going over to the empathy box, she quickly seated herself and once more gripped the twin handles.
<name>Dr. Boneli</name>	Dr. Boneli	Resch	“I’ve said for years,” [MASK] murmured, “that the Boneli Reflex-Arc Test should be applied routinely to police personnel, the higher up the chain of command, the better. Haven’t I, Inspector?”
<name>Dr. Chandra</name>	Dr. Chandra	Rick	[MASK] said, “There is a defect in your empathic, role-taking ability. One which we don’t test for. Your feelings toward androids.” “Of course we don’t test for that.” “Maybe we should.”
<name>Deckard</name>	Deckard	Rick	[MASK] said, “This”—he held up the flat adhesive disk with its trailing wires—“measures capillary dilation in the facial area. We know this to be a primary autonomic response, the so-called ‘shame’ or ‘blushing’ reaction to a morally shocking stimulus.
<name>Ellie</name>	Ellie	Isidore	“It probably wont be able to run as fast,” she said, “but there’s nothing for it to catch around here anyhow. It’ll die anyway.” She reached for the scissors. “Please,” [MASK] said.
<name>Zarathustra</name>	Zarathustra	Mercer	But the desolation remained after the walls had gone; the desolation followed after everything else. Except the frail, dim figure of [MASK]; the old man faced him, a placid expression on his face. “Is the sky painted?”
<name>Deckard</name>	Deckard	Rick	You’re what they call—” She tried to remember. “A bounty hunter,” [MASK] said. “But I’m not an android.” “This test you want to give me.” Her voice, now, had begun to return.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Mercer	[MASK] held out a closed hand, palm up. “Before I forget it, I have something of yours here.” He opened his fingers. On his hand rested the mutilated spider, but with its snipped-off legs restored. “Thanks.”
<name>she</name>	she	Rachael	filched and hidden away in her purse; he found himself rooting interminably. Meanwhile, [MASK] kicked off her boots and unzipped her shorts; balancing on one foot, she caught the discarded fabric with her toe and tossed it across the room.
<name>Mark</name>	Mark	Iran	“Unless they swindled me.” But that rarely happened; the fine for counterfeiting would be enormous: two and a half times the full market value of the genuine animal. “No, they didn’t swindle me.” “It’s a goat,” [MASK] said.
<name>Babette</name>	Babette	Amanda	“And I’ll reveal my carefully documented expose from up there—that expose coming exactly ten hours from now!” “Ent me, too, dahlink!” [MASK] gushed. “Tek me wit you! I go alonk en ven dey trow a rock et us
