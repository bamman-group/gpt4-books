<name>He</name>	He	Trumper	Let my people go. ‘I like it,’ I said. ‘That was really very beautiful.’ ‘You know the voice?’ [MASK] asked. He was very serious now. I tried to recall whether I might have heard it.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Bob	They watched him like children at a circus till he had passed the cherry tree, moved behind the fallen fence and was out of sight. ‘The things these children nowadays can think of doing,’ [MASK]’s mother said.
<name>Colin</name>	Colin	Trumper	‘You can’t be in a tree an’ two churches at the said, same time.’ There was an urgency in his voice. ‘I don’t know,’ [MASK] said. ‘P’raps you can if you feel you can.’
<name>Mafoota</name>	Mafoota	Trumper	‘An’ if you doubt me,’ he said, ‘if any one of you don’t believe me you can ask my father.’ ‘I not goin’ to argue,’ said [MASK], ‘but I think there should be land somewhere else.’
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Bambi	So nobody ain’t take no notice. ‘But there wus another rumour that she wus a funny woman, used to work with spirits an’ that sort of thing, an’ we start to wake up, that is we who live in Hunt’s Road, where [MASK] live.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Barbara	He was sure that was not taken in the island. It was impossible. They were naked and the position was obscene. Castor oil! Castor oil! On the back of the photograph with his wife a note read: ‘I hope the boss doesn’t see this, [MASK].’
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bob	The overseer’s brother didn’t say much. [MASK]’s father asked him whether he had any stories about the land, and he said no. He hadn’t seen his brother for many weeks except when he went to pay the rent.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Trumper	And then we saw what [MASK] had held and squeezed. It was a couple of frogs, black and bulbous. They had fallen to the ground with a thud, and yet they weren’t dislodged. They remained in their hideous posture like a child making its clumsy scale over the bench.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Bambi	The undertaker had his car outside waiting with the door wide open, so they could just throw [MASK] in when they reach, an’ tidy him up later. They lift him out quiet, an’ they wus both surprise how light he wus, must have been the rum wearin’ down his constitution.
<name>He</name>	He	Each	He sat puffing the pipe and watching the smoke float in all directions through the house, and the head teacher wondered what he felt. [MASK], it seemed, had retreated farther away from the other. The head teacher lit another cigarette.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Trumper	But when it happen to you an’ you got to go on livin’ it must be terrible.’ ‘We’d better stop talkin’ ’bout that,’ [MASK] said, "cause it kind of frighten me.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Trumper	My mother seemed puzzled too although she knew there wasn’t anything to give him. Although we were always told to say no, we hadn’t been used to an actual refusal. My mother laughed, and [MASK] went on smiling. Big, confident and self-satisfied.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bambina	He didn’t like Bots’ children any more than he like [MASK]’s. He wus supportin’ all of them. It just din’t make no difference, so he say in order to be fair, he would toss for it.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Trumper	He elbowed me in the ribs but I couldn’t understand what had happened. There was a rumble on the outskirts of the crowd, and [MASK] elbowed me again. He whispered quietly, but the whisper didn’t reach me.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Trumper	He sipped the drink and set the glass on the table. One of the lights went out, and the room was half dark. ‘You got a lot to learn,’ said [MASK]. ‘Time wus I had a right an’ proper respect for certain people.
<name>Mrs. Jones</name>	Mrs. Jones	Dave	‘Remember,’ she said, ‘you must keep an eye on the things all the time, ’cause you never know what happen in these places, an’ you can’t afford to lose one blessed thing. [MASK] say you never can tell what happen in the Customs.
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Trumper	‘Well, don’t stay there an’ stare like a you-know-what,’ [MASK] said. ‘They got a place where they put you when you start to sit an’ stare all day.’
<name>Spunk</name>	Spunk	Bob	[MASK] crouched behind the sack, a stump of a boy dressed in white flour-bag pants and shirt. The shirt was fastened to the pants with pins and occasionally he unfastened the pins to pull the pants above his waist. He was no longer afraid of what had happened.
<name>Albert</name>	Albert	Bob	‘Then he’ll have to give everybody notice,’ said the shoemaker angrily. ‘Don’t be foolish,’ said [MASK]’s father, ‘he can’t give everybody notice. There won’t be no more village.’ ‘ ’Tis true
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Trumper	We heard the voice shouting after us, there, there. It was difficult to think. We made our way towards the small gate, but we remembered that the overseer might still be there waiting for the girl. Then at [MASK]’s suggestion we scattered in different directions.
<name>Elendil</name>	Elendil	Bob	‘Come no further,’ said [MASK], shivering with fear, ‘come no further.’ The wave came forward like a thundering cloud, crashed and shot like a line of lightning over the footprints that were the only sign of our fugitive king.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Savory	But that didn’t matter since everyone earned much the same thing and bought much the same amount of food. The crowd had thickened again, and the surge of voices was gradually rising. [MASK] shuffled round briskly, solemn and silent and active and conscientious.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Trumper	It filled the nostrils and the ears and the eyes so that everything smelt and looked and felt like iodine and raw fish and the liquid of the grape leaf. ‘Remember,’ [MASK] said, ‘remember not to forget the words!’
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Trumper	‘It’s so small.’ The smile had disappeared and [MASK] sat erect, serious. I had this feeling that there was something else he wanted to say. It was as though the talk about noise and lights was an attempt to obscure another issue.
<name>Johnny's</name>	Johnny's	G.	Just like that.’ The body was firm, hard, erect, a paved brown track down which the water contoured in, out, around, off. ‘I want to see,’ a voiced raised over the neighbouring fence. ‘[MASK] mother bathing him.’
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Haynes	Tis the reason why that master at the High School didn’t like you. [MASK] come here the other morning' an’ he wus relating to the other boy what happen between you an’ the master, an’ I wish I wus there to put you in your place.
<name>Mammy</name>	Mammy	Elvirah	‘You see,’ the boy said, ‘the candle makes me remember [MASK] and what she does do. She does burn candle to keep away the spirits ’cause she’s Roman Catholic, as they say they got to burn away the spirits.’
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Trumper	I wasn’t worried about my duty. I had a lot of time to find what [MASK] had already known, but a new thought had registered. Suppose I didn’t find it. This was worse, the thought of being a part of what you could not become.
<name>Corbett</name>	Corbett	Trumper	[MASK] kept his eyes closed while the overseer stood where he was in the first row of spectators, angry but more subdued. The crowd had subdued him. A boy came forward and knelt beside me, and then a woman and another. And I saw no more.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Hurrahhhaarararah	[MASK].... The boys came to attention, and the teachers’ voices were raised in a confusion of orders to the squads. They spoke at the same time, but the orders were different, and the movements of the squads taken on the whole were contradictory.
<name>Stebbins</name>	Stebbins	Slime	‘There ain’t no reason under the sun why he should ’ave sell this land to [MASK].’ ‘I don’t understand what you mean by risk,’ I said. ‘I don’t see any risk.’
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Bambi	but they father father. [MASK] say it didn’t make no difference one way or the other, but that he would try it out, an’ when he give the next chil’ a name, he would wait an’ see if any change took place.
<name>Andrei</name>	Andrei	Bob	There was fighting in the city. They spoke quietly in the corner, and it seemed they had reached a decision. [MASK] looked at his mother, but she paid no attention. She had got up from the chair, peeped under the window and sat down quickly.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Trumper	‘You got to keep as quiet as you can now,’ [MASK] said, ‘or you’ll get what you don’t like; an’ crawl on yuh guts like a crab.’ We were standing within the wall a few yards away from the landlord’s house.
<name>Victoria</name>	Victoria	Victoria	Some of those boys in standard 7 think they know what it is to be a king. [MASK] was a real queen.’ There was a loud giggle from one comer of the school. The head teacher stiffened, and everyone felt the terror of the change that had come over him.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Trumper	‘They have this often,’ said [MASK], ‘sailors or no sailors. When they ain’t no sailors ’tis friends o’ the landlord an’ the daughter an’ so on. But they always give the sailors a big time, bigger than the rest.’
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Barrow	One day shortly after lunch a young man called [MASK] walked up the school yard and entered the headmaster’s office. He smoked a cigarette as he spoke to the headmaster, and one or two boys who passed by the headmaster’s study stole a glance and ran to inform the others.
<name>Jem</name>	Jem	Canute	He didn’t want you to know about [MASK] an’ all that. He told us he never said a word to you this mornin’, and he wus tryin’ to get away from you all the time.’
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Trumper	The couples scattered in different directions while those who had remained in the house went on drinking. It seemed so rich and satisfying and in a way quite astonishing to us. ‘You never been so close,’ [MASK] whispered, and his teeth seemed to chatter.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Trumper	The spool finished and the music followed low and sad at first but rising gradually to a kind of ecstasy. Then the music thinned out and a voice came through deep and beautiful in its controlled resonance. [MASK] sat steady, his head bowed close to the box.
<name>Tim</name>	Tim	Trumper	‘’Tis a great big difference,’ said [MASK]. ‘They suffer in a way we don’t know here. We can’t understan’ it here an’ we never will. But their sufferin’ teach them what we here won’t ever know.
<name>Brigid</name>	Brigid	Trumper	Tis the only flaw in creation. You mean the land. Yes, the land. Oh the land!’ ‘So you leavin’ tomorrow,’ said [MASK]. "Twill be a good change.’ My mother had left the room.
<name>Anancy</name>	Anancy	Bob	Night run till day catch him.’ My mother was silent, and I wondered whose side she was taking now, [MASK]’s or his mother’s. She looked up a little dazed, but her attention was soon arrested by another woman coming across the fallen fence.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Trumper	‘An’ when you ain’t cryin’, you quiet.’ "Tis true,’ [MASK] said. ‘Sometimes I get frighten when I see my mother baby starin’. Seems he ain’t seeing anything, an’ yet he seeing something.’
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Bob	The men were quiet now. It wouldn’t be long before the victim would come into sight. They had timed his approach. [MASK] and his mother went over to the bed and wondered what would happen to the overseer. They were sure it was the overseer.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bob	I said all right, and he swaggered down the lane. I waited, watching how the rickety lane squeezed its way between the houses. There was a pause in my awareness, then I realized I was standing at the corner turning [MASK]’s idea over and over in my mind.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bob	I had drifted shoreward, my body afloat on the water. I shook myself and walked up and down the beach, letting the sun dry me. [MASK]’s clothes were bundled on the rocks some yards from mine, so I knew he hadn’t gone.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Savory	He seemed very angry. Here and there the remnants of the crowd drifted about, appearing not to loiter. [MASK] had blown his whistle, and with it the echoing rumble of the cartwheels had given another warning to those who waited at the next stop.
<name>Joseph</name>	Joseph	Bob	The boy looked puzzled at first. ‘What class he use to teach,’ [MASK]’s father asked. ‘Class 5,’ the boy said. ‘He wus a good good teacher.’ ‘Why he left the teaching?’
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Pa.	She had noticed the changes too, and she had often talked with [MASK] But she had never foreseen disrespect, and she hated violence. In a way she had thought some of the changes were good, and the landlord agreed.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Dave	An’ whenever you see temptation cornin’ your way, just bear in mind all I tell you ’bout your health an’ so on. I won’t put you wrong.’ ‘You don’t know why [MASK] came back?’ I asked.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Trumper	There was the click and the light at the side which registered the numbers went out. The singing was at an end, but [MASK] went on reciting the words in a low, grave voice. I tried to memorize them as he spoke: Let my people go.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Another	The old boys knew this and made it a point of talking about girls when he was present. [MASK] had a liking for chocolates and the old boys kept asking him questions about sweets. Sometimes the boys asked questions which to them seemed perfectly straightforward but which irritated the masters.
<name>Enrico</name>	Enrico	Bob	* * * [MASK] did not return and we sat under the grape tree looking out across the sea. The sun went under cloud and we noticed how the shade of the sand deepened, and the sea in a level patch turn to dull grey.
<name>Anton</name>	Anton	Bob	The men tried to console him. They told him everything would be all right, but he sat shaking on the bench. [MASK]’s father did most of the talking while the overseer’s brother sat beside the shoemaker with his hand on the other’s knee.
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Trumper	‘Food in galore, an’ so they says you don’ have to cook it yuhself. ’Tis all new.’ ‘Who goin’ cook it for you if you don’ cook it yuhself?’ [MASK] asked.
<name>He</name>	He	Bambi	[MASK] tell her she make him laugh, ’cause all his children had names. ’Twus the first thing he do when they born, look for a name. But she says that wusn’t what she mean, they din’t really have a name if they wus livin’ as they wus.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Trumper	It would seem the cats always assembled in the wood near the wall where they fought and screamed and copulated. [MASK] knew that, and he and others had gone at night on several occasions to watch the cats. They mated with a kind of ferocity which fascinated and terrified the boys.
<name>Giuseppe</name>	Giuseppe	Bob	They looked as if nothing had happened. The girl was still holding the stick with which she had been disturbing the dust in the canal, and [MASK] carried the comb that made his music. Everything seemed clear and clean and quiet. ‘What they fight for?’
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Bambina	They creep in quiet quiet an’ not a word, not a sound pass the lips. The lamp was burnin’ low on the table, ’cause [MASK] always sleep with a light in the room, says she can’t sleep in the dark for any sum of money.
<name>Macomber</name>	Macomber	Bob	[MASK] stooped and picked up a pebble which he placed under his tongue. Removing it he faced the east and threw it over his head. That was a good luck token. Then he mumbled to me with his head tossed callously to one side that we should take different routes.
<name>O'Brien</name>	O'Brien	Jack	An’ the time is fast cornin’ when every man [MASK] will have belongin’ to him the spot o’ land his house on. That’s as what he says an’ he figures himself that ’tis time now to start the ball rolling.
<name>John</name>	John	John	She hadn’t raised her head, but her manner had changed. She seemed more at ease. "Tis a good chapter,’ she said, ‘[MASK] 14. Let not your heart be troubled.’ She had taken the pen from the table.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Trumper	On that account I had nothing to be angry about. The Race. My people. ‘Am I one of your people, [MASK]?’ The question was almost desperate. I was beginning to think that another world infinitely more vast than the High School was coming between us.
<name>him</name>	him	Trumper	A good trade and some facts ’bout the world.’ "Tis what I tell my boy,’ the overseer’s brother said; ‘I tell [MASK] day in day out he gotta think ’bout the future.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Trumper	‘This is it,’ he said. "Tis here we got to go through. This is it.’ We drew nearer to feel whether [MASK] had really found a way. "Tis this,’ he said, dismissing us with one hand. "
<name>John</name>	John	Trumper	[MASK] hadn’t spoken and I didn’t care to interrupt. I thought I would ask him about the spirituals later. This solo went on for about five minutes and then we heard the click and the spool and the light registered three. It was very fascinating.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Trumper	‘I don’t understand what you mean by risk,’ I said. ‘I don’t see any risk.’ ‘I don’t know,’ said [MASK]. ‘P’raps I use the wrong word.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Trumper	‘Are you going back?’ I asked him. It seemed a stupid question. But I found it difficult to make questions because there was an assurance about [MASK] that silenced me. He didn’t seem to think the question silly.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Trumper	What could any of us do about it? There was nothing I could do. ‘[MASK],’ I had spoken but I had already forgotten what I wanted to say. I wasn’t sure I would see him in the morning. He was listening.
<name>Manuel</name>	Manuel	Bob	[MASK] was breaking sea-eggs on an iron pipe that stretched from the land across the shore and into the sea. He cracked the shells against the pipe, then parted them and dipped the broken halves in the water before scooping the fleshy innards from their layers.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Trumper	I wanted to suggest it, but [MASK] hadn’t spoken and I felt uneasy. Ever since we mentioned the land his manner had bewildered me. I thought I had seen the clue to his letter although I didn’t know what the clue was.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Trumper	Whatever we had known we hadn’t known this difference. To be a different kind of creature. It was difficult to think. To be a part of something which you didn’t know and which if [MASK] was right it was my duty to discover.
<name>Haynes</name>	Haynes	Thompson	That’s what they’ve come here for. To get me into trouble. That’s what they’re like. You can never take chances, never, never, never. Tbp imagp nf rhg pnprriy Mv ppnplp. ‘Haynes, time. [MASK], time.’
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Savory	This whispered dialogue crept under and into the chime of coins and the shuffle of the paper [MASK] used for wrapping. The paper was cut in thin transparent sheets large enough to cover the loaves. These were clearly visible through the paper, which was quickly softened with oil oozing from the cakes.
<name>John</name>	John	Trumper	He told the others that the old woman had seen him before she died, and he had talked with her. They knew he would sell the land, but they didn’t expect it would have happened so suddenly. The old woman hadn’t lived to see. [MASK] didn’t speak.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Trumper	[MASK] never said that was true. He never said whether the boys had their eyebrows shaven, but that was the suggestion. But there was something queer about his eyebrows, and he knew it. The saving grace about his face was the colour of his skin.
<name>Joad</name>	Joad	Trumper	An’ some say you can put in a next dime in a next hole an’ you hear the music whatever you want to hear while you eatin’.’ ‘I ain’t like the sound o’ that much,’ said [MASK]. "
<name>He</name>	He	Trumper	The language was not unlike what he was used to speaking in the village, but the sentiments were so different. He had learnt a new word, and the word seemed like some other world which I had never heard of. [MASK] had changed.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Bob	[MASK] argued too. He told his father he had recognized one of the men, and he wouldn’t like to find himself in a fight against that man. He began to cry, and his father decided not to go.
<name>Griffiths</name>	Griffiths	Trumper	The look of skin that has been shaven for the first time. No one knew how [MASK] had come by these short silky eyebrows and the sore, worn skin that held them. But there were several suggestions, and the best known was probably the right one.
<name>Prue</name>	Prue	Jon	If there’s weddin’, then there’s gottabe man, an’ it ain’t ’ave nothin’ to do with you, or where you is. ’Tis a question of what gottabe. That’s p’raps the way [MASK] feel all the time.
<name>Rawlston</name>	Rawlston	Trumper	They spend money like little boys who ain’t know what it mean not to have it. ’Tis a kind o’ big bad habit.’ ‘Where they get all this money from?’ my mother asked. She was curious. ‘Work,’ said [MASK].
<name>Jacob</name>	Jacob	Bob	The overseer’s brother and [MASK]’s father walked over to him and put their hands on his shoulder; he kept his head held towards the ground winking his eyes as though they were irritated by the dust. The overseer’s brother turned and asked the people to disperse.
<name>Samuel</name>	Samuel	Bob	They opened the doors and looked out at the cross roads where the people were moving to and fro between the shops. ‘I got to go,’ the overseer’s brother said. ‘An’ don’t you bother yuh brain ’bout anythin’,’ [MASK]’s father said.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sonnie	He turned his head and looked long and steady at the mirror that hung against the partition. The dialogue had circulated. ‘Some say it’s Boysie,’ a woman was saying,‘and some say is [MASK], but the truth is she six months gone.’
<name>God</name>	God	Trinidad	His face registered the disgust it evoked. ‘I don’t know much ’bout [MASK],’ he said, regaining his composure. ‘But you might got to go further one day an’ there be quite a few things you got to learn.
<name>Timothy</name>	Timothy	Job	Nothing more or worse than a nasty crime.’ ‘You mustn’t say that,’ my mother said. "Tis what [MASK] says too, but he wus wrong. There’s always a way out if you wait an’ pray.’
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Bots	Every Saturday night, he wus blind drunk, an’ one Saturday night in particular he got so drunk he din’t know what to do with himself, an’ he went home an’ he beat the life out of [MASK].
<name>the others</name>	the others	Trumper	We were engrossed and [MASK] who had been urging us to leave understood and remained. They had drawn nearer to the table, and the preacher’s face shone without reflection, black and wet like bronze in a fine drizzle. His skin was coarse, his fingers thick and tough.
<name>Mirandy</name>	Mirandy	Bambina	They lean him sideways, an’ when they had got him half-way through, the big camphor balls that stop up his nostrils drop out an’ wake up [MASK]. She couldn’t believe her eyes. She turn the lamp wick an’ look an’ it din’t make sense.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Trumper	‘It don’t matter,’ [MASK] said, ‘you’ll frighten him all the same.’ The waves had settled for a while and the wind, it seemed, had lodged in the trees. Nothing moved but the tide of the wave drifting gently to the shore.
<name>Anancy</name>	Anancy	Bambi	‘It went on an’ on an’ soon [MASK] wus the hardest drinker in the village; they say they never see a man put away rum like that; he use to make it look like water, the way he put it to his head, an’ snap his lips.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Trumper	The feeling came back as sharp as it did when I remembered leaving the village school and later [MASK]’s departure. And there was little reason why I should have regretted leaving the High School. For six years my life had alternated between boyish indifference and tolerable misery.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Trumper	Two or three women who stood near us seemed to think something was wrong. They whispered something and on occasions gave us a glance. There was a rumbling outside the spectators’ circle and we heard one man rebuke another for disturbing. [MASK] thought it was the overseer.
<name>Alvarez</name>	Alvarez	Trumper	Twould be a kind of sickness in yuh stomach. Every time you look up you feel you lookin’ down, a real kind of bad sickness at the bottom of everything.’ ‘I don’t think it could happen though to the whole village,’ [MASK] said.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Bambi	Twus a high burnin’ shame that that had to be. Why everybody, good, bad an’ indifferent should get a good funeral with wreath an’ people to walk behind the hearse, an’ [MASK] all alone should go in a poor man’s spot. ’
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Trumper	He seemed more assured of escape than anyone else, and occasionally he touched us on the shoulder to indicate quiet. ‘Creep round easy see if you see anybody,’ [MASK] said. He was breathing heavily. The words came out in a gust of breath.
<name>Mac</name>	Mac	Trumper	The bartender came over to say that it was closing time, but if we cared he would close the doors and let us stay for another few minutes. ‘We’ll finish this an’ have another for the road,’ said [MASK].
<name>Quatermass</name>	Quatermass	Trumper	He took the small box from his pocket and set it on the table. It was the size of a box camera with two knobs to the front and a wire running back to front on all sides. [MASK] touched a piece of wire and a light went on in the box.
