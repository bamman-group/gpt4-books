<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Dorian	As for marriage, of course that would be silly, but there are other and more interesting bonds between men and women. I will certainly encourage them. They have the charm of being fashionable. But here is [MASK] himself. He will tell you more than I can."
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sibyl	"He is gone," murmured [MASK] sadly. "I wish you had seen him." "I wish I had, for as sure as there is a God in heaven, if he ever does you any wrong, I shall kill him."
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Dorian	When the sound of their footsteps had died away, [MASK] locked the door and put the key in his pocket. He felt safe now. No one would ever look upon the horrible thing. No eye but his would ever see his shame.
<name>Goldstein</name>	Goldstein	Basil	I want to be better. I am going to be better. Tell me something about yourself. What is going on in town? I have not been to the club for days." "The people are still discussing poor [MASK]'s disappearance."
<name>Alan</name>	Alan	Hallward	He had found it at last. He was going to rip up the canvas. With a stifled sob the lad leaped from the couch, and, rushing over to [MASK], tore the knife out of his hand, and flung it to the end of the studio.
<name>Rainsford</name>	Rainsford	Dorian	[MASK] watched them as they plunged into the alder-clump, brushing the lithe swinging branches aside. In a few moments they emerged, dragging a body after them into the sunlight. He turned away in horror. It seemed to him that misfortune followed wherever he went.
<name>Henrietta</name>	Henrietta	Hetty	Even as a beginning, it is poor. Besides, how do you know that [MASK] isn't floating at the present moment in some starlit mill-pond, with lovely water-lilies round her, like Ophelia?"
<name>Conscience</name>	Conscience	Conscience	Religion consoles some. Its mysteries have all the charm of a flirtation, a woman once told me, and I can quite understand it. Besides, nothing makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner. [MASK] makes egotists of us all.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Harry	I shall be late for lunch, if I stop any longer. Thanks for giving me the information I wanted. I always like to know everything about my new friends, and nothing about my old ones." "Where are you lunching, [MASK]?"
<name>Eve</name>	Eve	Eve	"Why can't these American women stay in their own country? They are always telling us that it is the paradise for women." "It is. That is the reason why, like [MASK], they are so excessively anxious to get out of it
<name>Lois</name>	Lois	Romeo	I want to make [MASK] jealous. I want the dead lovers of the world to hear our laughter and grow sad. I want a breath of our passion to stir their dust into consciousness, to wake their ashes into pain.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Campbell	[MASK] made no answer. After about ten minutes a knock came to the door, and the servant entered, carrying a large mahogany chest of chemicals, with a long coil of steel and platinum wire and two rather curiously shaped iron clamps.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Alan	This one will have to interest you. I am awfully sorry for you, [MASK]. But I can't help myself. You are the one man who is able to save me. I am forced to bring you into the matter. I have no option.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Basil	Have you noticed in the picture something curious?--something that probably at first did not strike you, but that revealed itself to you suddenly?" "[MASK]!" cried the lad, clutching the arms of his chair with trembling hands and gazing at him with wild startled eyes.
<name>Fowler</name>	Fowler	Francis	In about five minutes his valet appeared, half-dressed and looking very drowsy. "I am sorry to have had to wake you up, [MASK]," he said, stepping in; "but I had forgotten my latch-key. What time is it?"
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Dorian	"Let us sit down, [MASK]," said the painter, looking troubled. "Let us sit down. And just answer me one question. Have you noticed in the picture something curious?--something that probably at first did not strike you, but that revealed itself to you suddenly?"
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Basil	I am in love with it, [MASK]. It is part of myself. I feel that." "Well, as soon as you are dry, you shall be varnished, and framed, and sent home. Then you can do what you like with yourself."
<name>Duchess</name>	Duchess	Life	"[MASK] has always poppies in her hands. Of course, now and then things linger. I once wore nothing but violets all through one season, as a form of artistic mourning for a romance that would not die. Ultimately, however, it did die.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Basil	The few words that [MASK]'s friend had said to him--words spoken by chance, no doubt, and with wilful paradox in them--had touched some secret chord that had never been touched before, but that he felt was now vibrating and throbbing to curious pulses.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Alan	He kept his hands in the pockets of his Astrakhan coat, and seemed not to have noticed the gesture with which he had been greeted. "Yes: it is a matter of life and death, [MASK], and to more than one person. Sit down."
<name>Willis</name>	Willis	Willis	She wrung her hands in mock despair. "How annoying!" she cried. "I must go. I have to call for my husband at the club, to take him to some absurd meeting at [MASK]'s Rooms, where he is going to be in the chair.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Dorian	"I have got through all that," said [MASK], shaking his head and smiling. "I am perfectly happy now. I know what conscience is, to begin with. It is not what you told me it was. It is the divinest thing in us.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	When he entered the somewhat sombre hall, the butler told him that they had gone in to lunch. He gave one of the footmen his hat and stick and passed into the dining-room. "Late as usual, [MASK]," cried his aunt, shaking her head at him.
<name>Oscar</name>	Oscar	Harry	Women are a decorative sex. They never have anything to say, but they say it charmingly. Women represent the triumph of matter over mind, just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals." "[MASK], how can you?" "
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Dorian	He hailed it and in a low voice gave the driver an address. The man shook his head. "It is too far for me," he muttered. "Here is a sovereign for you," said [MASK]. "You shall have another if you drive fast."
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	The world is wide, and has many marvellous people in it. Don't take away from me the one person who gives to my art whatever charm it possesses: my life as an artist depends on him. Mind, [MASK], I trust you."
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Basil	We are to see her to-night, if that boy doesn't forget his appointment." "Are you serious?" "Quite serious, [MASK]. I should be miserable if I thought I should ever be more serious than I am at the present moment."
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Campbell	After about ten minutes a knock came to the door, and the servant entered, carrying a large mahogany chest of chemicals, with a long coil of steel and platinum wire and two rather curiously shaped iron clamps. "Shall I leave the things here, sir?" he asked [MASK].
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Dorian	"But I am awfully obliged to you for all that you have said to me. You are certainly my best friend. No one has ever understood me as you have." "We are only at the beginning of our friendship, [MASK]
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Sibyl	That was when acting was really understood. As for [MASK], I do not know at present whether her attachment is serious or not. But there is no doubt that the young man in question is a perfect gentleman. He is always most polite to me.
<name>Shakespeare</name>	Shakespeare	Shakespeare	The next night, of course, I arrived at the place again. When he saw me, he made me a low bow and assured me that I was a munificent patron of art. He was a most offensive brute, though he had an extraordinary passion for [MASK].
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Dorian	[MASK] strolled along by his side. The keen aromatic air, the brown and red lights that glimmered in the wood, the hoarse cries of the beaters ringing out from time to time, and the sharp snaps of the guns that followed, fascinated him and filled him with a sense of delightful freedom.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Dorian	Yes, it was [MASK] himself. But who had done it? He seemed to recognize his own brushwork, and the frame was his own design. The idea was monstrous, yet he felt afraid. He seized the lighted candle, and held it to the picture.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Dorian	It is not in you, [MASK], to commit a murder. I am sorry if I hurt your vanity by saying so, but I assure you it is true. Crime belongs exclusively to the lower orders. I don't blame them in the smallest degree.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Dorian	"This is blasphemy, [MASK]!" he cried. "You must not say things like that. They are horrible, and they don't mean anything." "You think so?" He laughed again. "I know so.
<name>Gwendolen</name>	Gwendolen	Sibyl	I trust he is one of the aristocracy. He has all the appearance of it, I must say. It might be a most brilliant marriage for [MASK]. They would make a charming couple. His good looks are really quite remarkable; everybody notices them."
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Egad	[MASK], I was ashamed of him. The Queen used to ask me about the English noble who was always quarrelling with the cabmen about their fares. They made quite a story of it. I didn't dare show my face at Court for a month.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Dorian	"Perhaps." "Good night, then." "Good night," answered the young man, passing up the steps and wiping his parched mouth with a handkerchief. [MASK] walked to the door with a look of pain in his face.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	You have everything in the world that a man can want. There is no one who would not be delighted to change places with you." "There is no one with whom I would not change places, [MASK]. Don't laugh like that.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	What you have told me is quite a romance, a romance of art one might call it, and the worst of having a romance of any kind is that it leaves one so unromantic." "[MASK], don't talk like that.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Dorian	"[MASK], this is horrible! Something has changed you completely. You look exactly the same wonderful boy who, day after day, used to come down to my studio to sit for his picture. But you were simple, natural, and affectionate then.
<name>Helen</name>	Helen	Harry	There is no mystery in any of them. They ride in the park in the morning and chatter at tea-parties in the afternoon. They have their stereotyped smile and their fashionable manner. They are quite obvious. But an actress! How different an actress is! [MASK]!
<name>Renfield</name>	Renfield	Alan	He will not be missed for months. When he is missed, there must be no trace of him found here. You, [MASK], you must change him, and everything that belongs to him, into a handful of ashes that I may scatter in the air."
<name>Juliet</name>	Juliet	Juliet	They were horribly disappointed. Yet they felt that the true test of any [MASK] is the balcony scene of the second act. They waited for that. If she failed there, there was nothing in her. She looked charming as she came out in the moonlight.
<name>Parker</name>	Parker	Francis	A sigh of relief broke from his parched lips, and the colour came back to his cheeks. "Ask him to come in at once, [MASK]." He felt that he was himself again. His mood of cowardice had passed away. The man bowed and retired.
<name>Sibyl</name>	Sibyl	Sibyl	he murmured to himself, and he walked across to the window and opened it. When he stepped out on to the grass, he drew a deep breath. The fresh morning air seemed to drive away all his sombre passions. He thought only of [MASK].
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Basil	"[MASK]," he said, looking very pale, "you must not look at it. I don't wish you to." "Not look at my own work! You are not serious. Why shouldn't I look at it?"
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Harry	It was some consolation that [MASK] was to be there, and when the door opened and he heard his slow musical voice lending charm to some insincere apology, he ceased to feel bored. But at dinner he could not eat anything. Plate after plate went away untasted.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Dorian	cried [MASK], leaping to his feet. "You must not tell me about things. What is done is done. What is past is past." "You call yesterday the past?" "What has the actual lapse of time got to do with it?
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Dorian	What a fearful thing it is! And what an utter intellectual stagnation it reveals! One should absorb the colour of life, but one should never remember its details. Details are always vulgar." "I must sow poppies in my garden," sighed [MASK].
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Harry	After a short time, he came to himself and looked round with a dazed expression. "What has happened?" he asked. "Oh! I remember. Am I safe here, [MASK]?" He began to tremble. "
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Dorian	I should like to have something more of her than the memory of a few kisses and some broken pathetic words." "I will try and do something, [MASK], if it would please you. But you must come and sit to me yourself again.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Dorian	he asked huskily through the trap. [MASK] started and peered round. "This will do," he answered, and having got out hastily and given the driver the extra fare he had promised him, he walked quickly in the direction of the quay.
<name>Lord Henry</name>	Lord Henry	Hallward	His eyes deepened into amethyst, and across them came a mist of tears. He felt as if a hand of ice had been laid upon his heart. "Don't you like it?" cried [MASK] at last, stung a little by the lad's silence, not understanding what it meant.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	You don't know what he had made me suffer. Whatever my life is, he had more to do with the making or the marring of it than poor [MASK] has had. He may not have intended it, the result was the same." "Murder!
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Dorian	I see you are laughing. It is horrid of you!" "I am not laughing, [MASK]; at least I am not laughing at you. But you should not say the greatest romance of your life. You should say the first romance of your life.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Dorian	I wish I could change places with you, [MASK]. The world has cried out against us both, but it has always worshipped you. It always will worship you. You are the type of what the age is searching for, and what it is afraid it has found.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Campbell	Having done this, he got up and went over to the window. [MASK] looked at him in surprise, and then took up the paper, and opened it. As he read it, his face became ghastly pale and he fell back in his chair.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Dorian	I suppose they don't know your name at the theatre? If they don't, it is all right. Did any one see you going round to her room? That is an important point." [MASK] did not answer for a few moments.
<name>Hallward</name>	Hallward	Hallward	A look of joy came into his eyes, as if he had recognized himself for the first time. He stood there motionless and in wonder, dimly conscious that [MASK] was speaking to him, but not catching the meaning of his words.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Dorian	" There was no answer, but he could hear the young man sobbing at the window. "Pray, [MASK], pray," he murmured. "What is it that one was taught to say in one's boyhood? 'Lead us not into temptation.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Basil	I am so sorry, [MASK], but there is only room for two in the brougham. You must follow us in a hansom." They got up and put on their coats, sipping their coffee standing. The painter was silent and preoccupied.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Dorian	"But she seems to me to be simply callous and cold. She has entirely altered. Last night she was a great artist. This evening she is merely a commonplace mediocre actress." "Don't talk like that about any one you love, [MASK].
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Harry	No, [MASK]," he said at last, "I did not get home till nearly three." "Did you go to the club?" "Yes," he answered. Then he bit his lip. "No, I don't mean that.
<name>Basil</name>	Basil	Basil	They would defile it and make it shameful. And yet the thing would still live on. It would be always alive. He shuddered, and for a moment he regretted that he had not told [MASK] the true reason why he had wished to hide the picture away.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Basil	"Half-past six! What an hour! It will be like having a meat-tea, or reading an English novel. It must be seven. No gentleman dines before seven. Shall you see [MASK] between this and then? Or shall I write to him?"
<name>Whitefield</name>	Whitefield	White	I have promised to dine at [MASK]'s, but it is only with an old friend, so I can send him a wire to say that I am ill, or that I am prevented from coming in consequence of a subsequent engagement.
<name>Grimaldi</name>	Grimaldi	Juliet	He was played by the low-comedian, who had introduced gags of his own and was on most friendly terms with the pit. They were both as grotesque as the scenery, and that looked as if it had come out of a country-booth. But [MASK]!
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	James	Is that right? What about that?" "You are speaking about things you don't understand, [MASK]. In the profession we are accustomed to receive a great deal of most gratifying attention. I myself used to receive many bouquets at one time.
<name>Lucien</name>	Lucien	Harry	However, tell me about your genius. How long have you known her?" "Ah! [MASK], your views terrify me." "Never mind that. How long have you known her?" "About three weeks." "
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Harry	Why not tell me what it is? You know I would help you." "I can't tell you, [MASK]," he answered sadly. "And I dare say it is only a fancy of mine. This unfortunate accident has upset me.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	"You don't understand me, [MASK]," answered the artist. "Of course I am not like him. I know that perfectly well. Indeed, I should be sorry to look like him. You shrug your shoulders? I am telling you the truth.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Harry	It seems terrible to me now that they should ever be found together. For I have a new ideal, [MASK]. I am going to alter. I think I have altered." "You have not yet told me what your good action was.
<name>Lucien</name>	Lucien	Harry	"Is that yours, [MASK]?" "I give it to you." "I could not use it. It is too true." "You need not be afraid. Our countrymen never recognize a description." "They are practical."
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	I consider that for any man of culture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest immorality." "But, surely, if one lives merely for one's self, [MASK], one pays a terrible price for doing so?"
<name>Alan</name>	Alan	Alan	"Yes, it is my turn to dictate terms, [MASK]. You know what they are. The thing is quite simple. Come, don't work yourself into this fever. The thing has to be done. Face it, and do it."
<name>Shelley</name>	Shelley	Dorian	He was an extremely clever young man, though he had no real appreciation of the visible arts, and whatever little sense of the beauty of poetry he possessed he had gained entirely from [MASK]. His dominant intellectual passion was for science.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Dorian	"I am searching for peace," she said, "and if I don't go and dress, I shall have none this evening." "Let me get you some orchids, Duchess," cried [MASK], starting to his feet and walking down the conservatory.
<name>Thornton</name>	Thornton	Thornton	"I suppose you have come about the unfortunate accident of this morning, [MASK]?" he said, taking up a pen. "Yes, sir," answered the gamekeeper. "Was the poor fellow married? Had he any people dependent on him?"
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Harry	I like the duchess very much, but I don't love her." "And the duchess loves you very much, but she likes you less, so you are excellently matched." "You are talking scandal, [MASK], and there is never any basis for scandal."
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	She laughed and took his arm. "You dear old [MASK], you talk as if you were a hundred. Some day you will be in love yourself. Then you will know what it is. Don't look so sulky.
<name>Dorothy</name>	Dorothy	Duchess	"Can you remember any great error that you committed in your early days, [MASK]?" he asked, looking at her across the table. "A great many, I fear," she cried. "Then commit them over again," he said gravely.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Sibyl	"My son, you distress me very much. [MASK] is always under my special care. Of course, if this gentleman is wealthy, there is no reason why she should not contract an alliance with him. I trust he is one of the aristocracy.
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Basil	Surely for that reason, if for none other, you should not have made his sister's name a by-word." "Take care, [MASK]. You go too far." "I must speak, and you must listen. You shall listen.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Campbell	There he stopped, feeling afraid to turn round, and his eyes fixed themselves on the intricacies of the pattern before him. He heard [MASK] bringing in the heavy chest, and the irons, and the other things that he had required for his dreadful work.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Harry	[MASK], I could hardly see this girl for the mist of tears that came across me. And her voice--I never heard such a voice. It was very low at first, with deep mellow notes that seemed to fall singly upon one's ear.
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Hallward	[MASK] stirred in his chair as if he was going to rise. He rushed at him and dug the knife into the great vein that is behind the ear, crushing the man's head down on the table and stabbing again and again.
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Sibyl	"Oh! that you will be a good boy and not forget us," she answered, smiling at him. He shrugged his shoulders. "You are more likely to forget me than I am to forget you, [MASK]." She flushed.
<name>Basil</name>	Basil	Basil	She had all the delicate grace of that Tanagra figurine that you have in your studio, [MASK]. Her hair clustered round her face like dark leaves round a pale rose. As for her acting--well, you shall see her to-night.
<name>He</name>	He	Dorian	I only trust your name won't be mentioned in connection with it. The inquest is to take place this afternoon. Have they summoned you?" [MASK] shook his head, and a look of annoyance passed over his face at the mention of the word "inquest.
<name>Juliet</name>	Juliet	Juliet	You will like him so much. Everybody likes him, and I ... love him. I wish you could come to the theatre to-night. He is going to be there, and I am to play [MASK]. Oh! how I shall play it!
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	But the world might guess it, and I will not bare my soul to their shallow prying eyes. My heart shall never be put under their microscope. There is too much of myself in the thing, [MASK]--too much of myself!"
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Hallward	"Very well," said [MASK], and he went over and laid down his cup on the tray. "It is rather late, and, as you have to dress, you had better lose no time.
<name>Sissy</name>	Sissy	Sibyl	He was merely a boy. At the Marble Arch they hailed an omnibus, which left them close to their shabby home in the Euston Road. It was after five o'clock, and [MASK] had to lie down for a couple of hours before acting.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Dorian	And yet--" "Just turn your head a little more to the right, [MASK], like a good boy," said the painter, deep in his work and conscious only that a look had come into the lad's face that he had never seen there before.
<name>Alida</name>	Alida	Dorian	"Don't speak about those days, [MASK]--they are dead." "The dead linger sometimes. The man upstairs will not go away. He is sitting at the table with bowed head and outstretched arms.
<name>Godfrey</name>	Godfrey	Dorian	I was waiting for you to call me [MASK]." "You are mad, I tell you--mad to imagine that I would raise a finger to help you, mad to make this monstrous confession. I will have nothing to do with this matter, whatever it is.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Harry	"Are you better, my dear fellow?" he asked. "You seemed rather out of sorts at dinner." "I am quite well, [MASK]. I am tired. That is all." "You were charming last night.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Dorian	I am not sorry for anything that has happened. It has taught me to know myself better." "Ah, [MASK], I am so glad you take it in that way! I was afraid I would find you plunged in remorse and tearing that nice curly hair of yours."
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Harry	"It is a bad omen, [MASK]. I feel as if something horrible were going to happen to some of us. To myself, perhaps," he added, passing his hand over his eyes, with a gesture of pain. The elder man laughed.
