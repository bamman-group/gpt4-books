<name>Yasha</name>	Yasha	Haidar	We followed behind, at what we assumed to be safe distances, holding our children by the hand. She needed a blanket, a compress, a sedative tablet. She needed supervision. But when we reached the courtyard [MASK] and his wife would not have her in the flat.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Bibi	"What won't be cured must be endured. [MASK] has caused enough worry, added enough to expenses, sullied enough the family name.” His wife, seated beside him behind the tiny glass counter, fanned the mottled skin above her breasts and agreed.
<name>Jeff</name>	Jeff	Sunil	He ate a second piece, then washed it down with a gulp of gin straight from the bottle. “Great house. Great rice.” [MASK], an anesthesiologist, walked in, spooning food from his paper plate into his mouth. “Do you have more champagne?”
<name>Mr. Lim</name>	Mr. Lim	Haidar	It was ten minutes before [MASK] emerged from his shop, impassive apart from the red in his face. He told us to stop fussing, and then with no efforts to repress his disdain he packed her into a rickshaw bound for the polyclinic.
<name>Yulia</name>	Yulia	Eliot	They always spoke to each other in English when [MASK] was present. "Not today. Another day.” “How do you expect to pass the test if you refuse to drive on a road with other cars?”
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Shukumar	Her stomach was flat again, her waist narrow before the flare of her hips, the belt of the robe tied in a floppy knot. It was nearly eight. [MASK] put the rice on the table and the lentils from the night before into the microwave oven, punching the numbers on the timer.
<name>He</name>	He	Mala	Not one was missing. “What do you say to that, boy?” As stunned as I was, I knew what I had to say. With no hesitation at all, I cried out, “Splendid!” [MASK] laughed then.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Eliot	Slowly she stood up and rearranged the cloth over the telephone. [MASK] followed her, walking for the first time in his sneakers across the pear-colored carpet. She stared at him. Her lower eyelids were swollen into thin pink crests.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Shukumar	“Shouldn’t we keep the fights off?” [MASK] asked. She set her plate aside and clasped her hands on the table. “I want you to see my face when I tell you this,” she said gently. His heart began to pound.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bibi	“Now do you see that she is unfit to marry? Now do you see no man of sane mind would touch her?” Things had not been so bad for [MASK] before her father died. (The mother had not survived beyond the birth of the girl.)
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Miranda	He sat next to someone he didn’t know, someone sexy, and now he loves her instead of my mother.” He took off his shoes and placed them side by side on the floor. Then he peeled back the comforter and crawled into [MASK]'s bed with the almanac.
<name>Rahul</name>	Rahul	Dev	"He’s something of a genius. He has a Punjabi mother and a Bengali father, and because he learns French and English at school he already speaks four languages. I think he skipped two grades.” [MASK] was Bengali, too.
<name>Uma</name>	Uma	Mala	[MASK] set down her knitting and disappeared into the bathroom. When she emerged I regretted the suggestion; she had put on a clean silk sari and extra bracelets, and coiled her hair with a flattering side part on top of her head.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Helen	"It is no trouble.” [MASK] looked at her watch, stood up, and poured the rest of her tea into the sink. "I wouldn’t if I were you. That’s the sort of thing that would kill her altogether.”
<name>Lila</name>	Lila	Mala	Such a mishap, I realized that morning, would soon be my concern. It was my duty to take care of [MASK], to welcome her and protect her. I would have to buy her her first pair of snow boots, her first winter coat.
<name>Alfred</name>	Alfred	Rohin	She opened the door. [MASK] was holding his almanac in his hands, muttering something under his breath. His eyes opened wide at the sight of her. “I need help with the zipper,” she said. She sat on the edge of the bed.
<name>Amara</name>	Amara	Eliot	With [MASK]’s help the newspapers were crushed with all the peels and seeds and skins inside them. Brimming bowls and colanders lined the countertop, spices and pastes were measured and blended, and eventually a collection of broths simmered over periwinkle flames on the stove.
<name>Shabanu</name>	Shabanu	Bibi	“Why not marry her off, then? It will get her off your hands, at least.” ‘And waste our profits on a wedding? Feeding guests, ordering bracelets, buying a bed, assembling a dowry?” But [MASK]’s gripes persisted.
<name>he</name>	he	Rohin	"It’s lovely,” she said. When he didn’t reply, she went to the kitchen to pour herself more coffee. “Some for me, please,” [MASK] called out. She returned to the living room. “Some what?”
<name>Margo</name>	Margo	Laxmi	“Don’t worry, he’ll fall asleep in a few hours. And thanks for watching him.” “Back at three,” [MASK] said, disappearing with her cousin down the hallway. “We’re double-parked.”
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	Miranda	While [MASK] was told the proper way to apply it, in swiff upward strokes beginning at the base of her throat, he spun the lipstick carousel. He pressed a pump that dispensed cellulite gel and massaged it into the back of his ungloved hand.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Sanjeev	He placed them in the doorway of the master bedroom so that no one would trip when they descended. He heard something creaking open slowly. The strident voices had subsided to an even murmur. It occurred to [MASK] that he had the house all to himself.
<name>Samuel</name>	Samuel	Eliot	People were piled on the deck, eating, drinking, the sound of their laughter rising above the weary sigh of the waves. [MASK] and his mother weren’t invited. It was one of the rare days his mother had off, but they didn’t go anywhere.
<name>Aslam</name>	Aslam	Eliot	“But they might complain that you were making too much noise.” From where [MASK] sat on the sofa he could detect her curious scent of mothballs and cumin, and he could see the perfectly centered part in her braided hair, which was shaded with crushed vermilion and therefore appeared to be blushing.
<name>Radha</name>	Radha	Nora	His face was flushed and he was wearing [MASK]’s feather hat on his head. One by one the guests disappeared, men helping women as they placed their strappy high heels on the narrow slats of the ladder, the Indian women wrapping the free ends of their expensive saris into their waistbands.
<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Dora	By the time we reached [MASK]’s house our hands were chapped from carrying our bulging burlap bags, and our feet were sore and swollen. Her mother gave us bandages for our blisters and served us warm cider and caramel popcorn.
<name>Sheela</name>	Sheela	Eliot	A fierce wind blew into the car, accompanied by the sound of waves crashing on the shore. Finally she slid over to the driver’s side, but spent a long time adjusting her sari and her sunglasses. [MASK] turned and looked through the back window.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Twinkle	He returned to his pile of leaves and began to deposit them by handfuls into a plastic garbage bag. Over his head the blue sky was cloudless. One tree on the lawn was still full of leaves, red and orange, like the tent in which he had married [MASK].
<name>She</name>	She	Shoba	He liked that [MASK] was different. It astonished him, her capacity to think ahead. When she used to do the shopping, the pantry was always stocked with extra bottles of olive and corn oil, depending on whether they were cooking Italian or Indian.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bibi	But then a new treatment was prescribed for [MASK], the most outrageous of them all. One evening on her way to dinner, she collapsed on the third-floor landing, pounding her fists, kicking her feet, sweating buckets, lost to this world.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Eliot	“I must wear the powder every day,” she explained when [MASK] asked her what it was for, “for the rest of the days that I am married.” “Like a wedding ring, you mean?”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Miranda	“Do you need to go?” He shook his head but walked into the bathroom anyway. He put the cover of the toilet down, climbed on top of it, and surveyed the narrow glass shelf over the sink which held [MASK]’s toothbrush and makeup.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Helen	“I beg your pardon, madame. The piano?” "She used to give lessons. For forty years. It was how she raised us after my father died.” [MASK] put her hands on her hips, staring at the open refrigerator.
<name>Arjun</name>	Arjun	Douglas	“Help yourself to champagne. There’s gallons.” “I hope you don’t mind my asking,” [MASK] said, “but I noticed the statue outside, and are you guys Christian? I thought you were Indian.”
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Twinkle	This is meant for outside. For the lawn.” “Oh God, no. [MASK], no.” "But we must. It would be bad luck not to.” ‘All the neighbors will see. They’ll think we’re insane.”
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Sanjeev	[MASK] looked up. He was kneeling on the floor, marking, with ripped bits of a Post-it, patches on the baseboard that needed to be retouched with paint. “Throw it away.” “Which?” “Both.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Helen	We walked down the staircase. It was too narrow for us to descend side by side, so I followed [MASK], who seemed to be in no hurry, and complained at one point that she had a bad knee. “Have you been walking without your cane?”
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Ronny	[MASK] shrieked. “Wow!” They were seated in groups along the branches, with shining black faces, silver bodies, horizontal eyebrows, and crested heads. Their long gray tails dangled like a series of ropes among the leaves.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Twinkle	“Oh God, [MASK], please, I didn’t mean it.” He had never seen her cry before, had never seen such sadness in her eyes. She didn’t turn away or try to stop the tears; instead she looked strangely at peace.
<name>Naima</name>	Naima	Bibi	She told us to spread word of the sale, and we did. From [MASK] we purchased our soaps and kohl, our combs and powders, and when she had sold the last of her merchandise, she went by taxi to the wholesale market, using her profits to restock the shelves.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Rohin	"Please put it on,” [MASK] asked, suddenly standing behind her. He pressed his face against her, clasping her waist with both his thin arms. "Please?” ‘All right,” she said, surprised by the strength of his grip.
<name>Antonio</name>	Antonio	Shukumar	[MASK] took out a piece of lamb, pinching it quickly between his fingers so as not to scald himself. He prodded a larger piece with a serving spoon to make sure the meat slipped easily from the bone. "It’s ready,” he announced.
<name>Lucia</name>	Lucia	Shukumar	They served themselves, stirring the rice with their forks, squinting as they extracted bay leaves and cloves from the stew. Every few minutes [MASK] lit a few more birthday candles and drove them into the soil of the pot.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Shukumar	January 14, chicken with almonds and sultanas. He had no memory of eating those meals, and yet there they were, recorded in her neat proofreader’s hand. [MASK] enjoyed cooking now. It was the one thing that made him feel productive.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Shukumar	“Sometimes the current disappears for hours at a stretch. I once had to attend an entire rice ceremony in the dark. The baby just cried and cried. It must have been so hot.” Their baby had never cried, [MASK] considered.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Ronny	Eventually the friends stopped calling her, so that she was left at home all day with the baby, surrounded by toys that made her trip when she walked or wince when she sat, always cross and tired. Only occasionally did they go out after [MASK] was born, and even more rarely did they entertain.
<name>Lucia</name>	Lucia	Bibi	We wondered what to do. "Leather!” someone cried suddenly. “She needs to smell leather.” Then we remembered; the last time it had happened, a cowhide sandal held under her nostrils was what had finally freed [MASK] from the clutches of her torment.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Eliot	Subsequently she spoke in her own language, rapid and riotous to [MASK]’s ears; it was clear that she was reading the contents of the letter, word by word. As she read her voice was louder and seemed to shift: in key.
<name>He</name>	He	Rohin	“You have to wait out there,” she said, pointing to the door. “I’ll come out when I’m ready.” "But my mother always takes her clothes off in front of » me. "She does?” [MASK] nodded.
<name>I</name>	I	Lilia	Do you study history? Geography?” "[MASK] has plenty to learn at school,” my mother said. "We live here now, she was born here.” She seemed genuinely proud of the fact, as if it were a reflection of my character.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Twinkle	Then he set the reinforcements on the dining table. "Yes, everything, we found them all in the house, in the most unusual places,” he heard [MASK] saying in the living room. “In fact we keep finding them.” "No!”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Eliot	“How am I doing, [MASK]? Am I going to pass?" She was continuously distracted. She stopped the car without warning to listen to something on the radio, or to stare at something, anything, in the road. If she passed a person, she waved.
<name>Sita</name>	Sita	Bibi	Didn’t you see it?” A group of our husbands escorted her home. Dusk thickened, conch shells were blown, and the air grew dense with the incense of prayers. [MASK] muttered and staggered but said nothing. Her cheeks were bruised and nicked here and there.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Dev	“Of course.” “Do you remember how we whispered to each other?” "I remember,” [MASK] whispered playfully. "Do you remember what you said?” There was a pause. "‘Let’s go back to your place.’”
<name>Ruma</name>	Ruma	Shoba	Their baby would never have a rice ceremony, even though [MASK] had already made the guest list, and decided on which of her three brothers she was going to ask to feed the child its first taste of solid food, at six months if it was a boy, seven if it was a girl.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Miranda	“Thank you,” he said when she put it on the table. He took short sips, holding the mug securely with both hands. [MASK] sat with him while he drew, but when she attempted to put a coat of clear polish on her nails he protested.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Miranda	[MASK] didn’t know what she wanted. All she knew was that she didn’t want the man to walk away. He seemed to be lingering, waiting, along with the saleswoman, for her to say something.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Dev	Unlike the boys she dated in college, who were simply taller, heavier versions of the ones she dated in high school, [MASK] was the first always to pay for things, and hold doors open, and reach across a table in a restaurant to kiss her hand.
<name>She</name>	She	Dora	[MASK] continued. "From a park or something?” "I didn’t mean they were missing. I meant, he misses them. They live in a different country, and he hasn’t seen them in a while, that’s all.”
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Shoba	But now he would lie in their bed until he grew bored, gazing at his side of the closet which [MASK] always left partly open, at the row of the tweed jackets and corduroy trousers he would not have to choose from to teach his classes that semester.
<name>He</name>	He	Sanjeev	She was twenty-seven and recently abandoned, he had gathered, by an American who had tried and failed to be an actor; [MASK] was lonely, with an excessively generous income for a single man, and had never been in love.
<name>Jeremy</name>	Jeremy	Eliot	By September the tiny beach house where he and his mother lived year-round was already cold; [MASK] and his mother had to bring a portable heater along whenever they moved from one room to another, and to seal the windows with plastic sheets and a hair drier.
<name>James</name>	James	Twinkle	He thought perhaps [MASK] would call for his assistance, but he was not summoned. He looked about the hallway and to the landing below, at the champagne glasses and half-eaten samosas and napkins smeared with lipstick abandoned in every corner, on every available surface.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Twinkle	Unlike the other things they’d found, this contained dignity, solemnity, beauty even. But to his surprise these qualities made him hate it all the more. Most of all he hated it because he knew that [MASK] loved it.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Miranda	“I don’t believe you,” [MASK] said. It was the first time she’d spoken since they’d entered. She felt as if speakers were embedded in her ears. "Go ahead,” he urged, walking backward to his end of the bridge.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Shoba	“Today then,” [MASK] announced. "You have a dentist appointment next Friday, by the way.” He ran his tongue over the tops of his teeth; he’d forgotten to brush them that morning. It wasn’t the first time.
<name>Marissa</name>	Marissa	Laxmi	[MASK] had been on the phone for at least an hour, trying to calm her cousin down. No one noticed; they worked for a public radio station, in the fund-raising department, and were surrounded by people who spent all day on the phone, soliciting pledges.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Eliot	At first [MASK] had wondered if she had cut her scalp, or if something had bitten her there. But then one day he saw her standing before the bathroom mirror, solemnly applying, with the head of a thumbtack, a fresh stroke of scarlet powder, which she stored in a small jam jar.
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	Twinkle	"Do you think the previous owners were born-agains?” asked [MASK], making room the next day for a small plastic snow-filled dome containing a miniature Nativity scene, found behind the pipes of the kitchen sink.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Shoba	He wondered what [MASK] would tell him in the dark. The worst possibilities had already run through his head. That she’d had an affair. That she didn’t respect him for being thirty-five and still a student.
<name>She</name>	She	Bibi	For a time we sent our children to play on the roof in the afternoons, so that they could alert us if she was having another attack. But each night we left: her alone. Some months passed. [MASK] had retreated into a deep and prolonged silence.
<name>John</name>	John	Sanjeev	Three bedrooms, but one is my study. [MASK] went to the hardware store right away and replaced them, can you imagine, he replaced every single one.” Now it was the friend's turn to talk.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Shoba	He found a flashlight, but no batteries, and a half-empty box of birthday candles. [MASK] had thrown him a surprise birthday party last May. One hundred and twenty people had crammed into the house — all the friends and the friends of friends they now systematically avoided.
<name>Ratan</name>	Ratan	Bibi	We had succeeded in driving him more or less out of business. Before the year’s end the family moved away, leaving an envelope containing three hundred rupees under [MASK]’s door. There was no more news of them.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Haidar	Another seizure, and another, went unchecked. When we voiced our concern, [MASK] said it was not our business, and flatly refused to discuss the matter. To express our indignation we began to take our shopping elsewhere; this provided us with our only revenge.
<name>Asha</name>	Asha	Shukumar	She set up a small shrine, a framed picture of a lavender-faced goddess and a plate of marigold petals, on the bedside table in the guest room, and prayed twice a day for healthy grandchildren in the future. She was polite to [MASK] without being friendly.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Shoba	In the beginning he had believed that it would pass, that he and [MASK] would get through it all somehow. She was only thirty-three. She was strong, on her feet again. But it wasn’t a consolation.
<name>Shalini</name>	Shalini	Bibi	Shuttled from one specialist to the next, the girl had been prescribed to shun garlic, consume disproportionate quantities of bitters, meditate, drink green coconut water, and swallow raw duck’s eggs beaten in milk. In short, [MASK]’s life was an encounter with one fruitless antidote after another.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Shoba	One hundred and twenty people had crammed into the house — all the friends and the friends of friends they now systematically avoided. Bottles of vinho verde had nested in a bed of ice in the bathtub. [MASK] was in her fifth month, drinking ginger ale from a martini glass.
<name>Laurel</name>	Laurel	Sanjeev	In one of those books we got for our wedding.” [MASK] turned back to the baseboard, to replace a Post-it scrap that had fallen to the floor. "Check the expiration. And at the very least get rid of that idiotic statue.”
<name>She</name>	She	Miranda	He always was. His ribs were visible through his skin as he breathed, and yet he was beginning to develop a paunch. He complained about the hair on his shoulders, but [MASK] thought him perfect, and refused to imagine him any other way.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Rohin	"It won’t look like you.” The brooding look began to spread across [MASK]’s face again, just as it had when she’d refused him coffee. "Please?” She drew his face, outlining his head and the thick fringe of hair.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Twinkle	“Did you sweep the attic?” he asked [MASK] later as she was folding paper napkins and wedging them by their plates. The attic was the only part of the house they had not yet given an initial cleaning. "Not yet. I will, I promise.
<name>He</name>	He	Eliot	Her bps were coated in a complementary coral gloss, and a bit of the color had strayed beyond the borders. Yet it was his mother, [MASK] had thought, in her cuffed, beige shorts and her rope-soled shoes, who looked odd.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Eliot	She kept her knees pressed together, the high heels she never removed pressed into the pear-colored carpet. “It’s delicious,” she would conclude, setting down the plate after a bite or two. [MASK] knew she didn’t like the tastes; she’d told him so once in the car.
<name>Yulia</name>	Yulia	Eliot	No matter how kind they are, one day they will complain about visiting your mother, and you will get tired of it too, [MASK]. You will miss one day, and another, and then she will have to drag herself onto a bus just to get herself a bag of lozenges.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Sanj	Her belly was exposed, and he saw that there were goose bumps around her navel. “What do you think? Of course we can’t put this in our bedroom.” “We can’t?” “No, silly [MASK]. This is meant for outside.
<name>He</name>	He	Rohin	"Here,” she explained, pointing. 'After you’ve been crying?” “I guess so.” [MASK] opened the tube and smelled it. He squeezed a drop of it onto a finger, then rubbed it on his hand. “It stings.”
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	Miranda	[MASK] opened up her Filofax, where she had written “Mottery Dixit.” She looked up at the videos on the shelves behind the counter. She saw women wearing skirts that sat low on the hips and tops that tied like bandannas between their breasts.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Dev	In the Mapparium that day, all the countries had seemed close enough to touch, and [MASK]’s voice had bounced wildly off the glass. From across the bridge, thirty feet away, his words had reached her ears, so near and full of warmth that they’d drifted for days under her skin.
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	Twinkle	Although there were elements of tragedy and struggle in the Fifth Symphony, he had read, it was principally music of love and happiness. He heard the toilet flush. “By the way,” [MASK] hollered, "if you want to impress people, I wouldn't play this music.
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	Miranda	“No thanks.” The woman wrapped the cream in several layers of red tissue. “You’ll be very happy with this product.” [MASK]’s hand was unsteady as she signed the receipt. The man hadn’t budged.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mala	When she saw me she pointed at the sofa, and told me to sit down. I took my place as directed, but [MASK] wandered over to the piano and sat on the bench, which was now positioned where it belonged. “I broke my hip!”
<name>Albania's</name>	Albania's	Dacca	“One can only hope,” he said, reaching for another, "that [MASK]'s refugees are as heartily fed. Which reminds me.” He reached into his suit pocket and gave me a small plastic egg filled with cinnamon hearts.
<name>Estebanico</name>	Estebanico	Eliot	“I see her at night.” “When I was your age I was without knowing that one day I would be so far. You are wiser than that, [MASK]. You already taste the way things must be.”
<name>She</name>	She	Shukumar	There were endless boxes of pasta in all shapes and colors, zippered sacks of basmati rice, whole sides of lambs and goats from the Muslim butchers at Haymarket, chopped up and frozen in endless plastic bags. Every other Saturday they wound through the maze of stalls [MASK] eventually knew by heart.
<name>Rosemary</name>	Rosemary	Bibi	"The medical risk is too great for an expectant mother to be in contact with an hysterical person,” he insisted. That night [MASK] slept in the storage room. Their baby, a girl, was delivered by forceps at the end of June.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Helen	“Have you been walking without your cane?” [MASK] called out. “You know you’re not supposed to walk without that cane.” She paused, resting her hand on the banister, and looked back at me. “She slips sometimes.”
<name>Shalini</name>	Shalini	Miranda	For an instant [MASK]’s heart stopped. But no, the Dixit girl had been named something else, something that began with P. Still, she wondered if the actress and the Dixit girl were related. She’d been plain, wearing her hair in two braids all through high school.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Sanjeev	As people filtered from one room to the next, presents piled onto the long cherry-wood table that ran from one end of the downstairs hall to the other. It bewildered [MASK] that it was for him, and his house, and his wife, that they had all gone to so much care.
