<name>Mr. Carter</name>	Mr. Carter	Tiptop	“I’ll do what I can but will you talk to [MASK] at once? Ask him. I can’t approach him ... no one can officially. You’d be doing the Colony a great service.” “Guarantee my loan and I’ll talk to him tonight.
<name>British</name>	British	Struan	If my father’s connection with them was made public it would take his face away forever, would sever the very close links he has with [MASK]’s, and all the other hongs that exist today, and most important, would destroy forever his chance for a knighthood, the one thing he wants above all.
<name>Hercules</name>	Hercules	Dunross	“Bit more, mate,” he gasped, in great pain. Again [MASK] bore down. He felt the sinews of his arms and legs cry out under the strain. The beam came up a fraction. A trickle of rubble cascaded into the cavity.
<name>Ailsa</name>	Ailsa	Laddie	“[MASK], dinna ye think ye’d better visit our Shrieking Tree?” she asked with a smile. It was an ancient clan custom in the old country that somewhere near the dwelling of the oldest woman of the laird’s family would be the Shrieking Tree.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Gomt	“I sell short, and what do you do?” “Nothing openly. That’s our ace in the hole.” “Perhaps it really is, and I’m being set up,” [MASK] said. “What if I cover all losses?
<name>her</name>	her	Casey	“I remember what you said over dinner about drop dead money. You’ve got yours, she hasn’t. This could be a device to get her hers.” “Why’re you so concerned over [MASK]? You trying to divide and rule?”
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Suslev	Now which way should it be, he asked himself, going to sleep. The taxi stopped at the foyer below. [MASK] got out drunkenly and paid the man, then, reeling slightly, stepped over the rainwater swirling in the gutters and went in.
<name>James</name>	James	Sinders	“Yes sir?” “At six. [MASK] should be there by then.” “Do you know him, sir? Personally?” “Yes. Why?” “I just wanted to be sure.”
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Murtagh	You best get all the rest you can, your evening will be busy.” “Doing what?” “You’re not married, you’re not attached, so an entertaining evening wouldn’t be bad. Eh?” “Gee.” [MASK] brightened perceptibly.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Dianne	Crime’s fantastically low here—our police do a grand job—grand.” “Huh,” [MASK] sniffed. “They’re all corrupt. Why else be a policeman if it’s not to get rich? I don’t trust any of them. ...
<name>Evelyn</name>	Evelyn	Hans	“Oh! Then if you say so.” She got up. “Shall I go now?” “No, if you’ve time, please sit down. How long were you married?” “Four years. [MASK] . . She hesitated.
<name>the person's name cannot be determined from the given context</name>	the person's name cannot be determined from the given context	Bartlett	Surely she’s noticed that her boyfriend’s smitten? Perhaps she hasn’t. Or perhaps she couldn’t care less and she and [MASK] are just business partners and nothing else. Perhaps she’s a dyke after all. Or maybe she’s just frigid like a lot of them.
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Dunross	“Yes.” [MASK] was very pleased to hear the calm quality of his voice. “And true that many old friends have refused credit to you?” “Yes.” “And true that the . . .
<name>someone</name>	someone	Rosemont	“Yes. If the powers-that-be decided it was necessary.” He looked up at [MASK]. “Of course, any such debriefing would be highly dangerous and would have to be ordered solely under the Official Secrets Act.”
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Quillan	“Oh no, [MASK], thank you.” A liveried steward came from below. On his tray were hot and cold canapes. In the ice bucket beside the table was an opened bottle of white wine, four glasses, two cans of American beer and some soft drinks.
<name>Dirk</name>	Dirk	Phillip	You don’t use a tadpole to catch a shark.” “Good. Don’t worry, [MASK],” he said compassionately, “we’re going to get out of this mess.” “I don’t know, tai-pan. I hope so.”
<name>Roger</name>	Roger	Andrew	and she wondered again who would win. “Just before dinner [MASK] was say—” Then, with all of them, she heard faint screams. There was a sudden hush, everyone listening. ‘Tire!"
<name>George</name>	George	Gomt	“9:30 a.m., eh? If he’d really been smart he would have said noon, or 3.00 P.M., then we wouldn’t know all day and he could’ve manipulated us all day. As it is now . . .” [MASK] shrugged.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Rosemont	You’re overreacting again.” [MASK]’s face closed. “People call me a hawk. I’m not. Just a realist. They’re on a war footing. Our Midas Ill’s have pinpointed all kinds of crap, our . . .”
<name>money</name>	money	Ayeeyah	How much have you got there?” The old woman held on to the bag desperately, her eyes closed in terror and she gasped, “It’s all my savings, Hon—” He pulled the bag out of her grasp and opened it. “[MASK]!”
<name>tai-pan</name>	tai-pan	Jacques	“I agree, tai-pan. If it rains even part of tomorrow too, the going will be foul on Saturday.” “[MASK]? What do you think?” “I agree,” deVille said.
<name>George</name>	George	Gomt	“Yes, yes I think so. My, my brakes went.” [MASK] wiped the sweat off his forehead, trying to get his brain to work. He felt his chest, then moved his feet and there was no pain. “I . . .
<name>Mowgli</name>	Mowgli	Armstrong	The child got up. He could see her fear now. “Sit down,” he ordered. She sat, even more afraid. “If I not pleeze she throw m—” “You please me.” [MASK] sighed. It was an old ploy.
<name>May</name>	May	Barbara	She’ll throw a temperament that will raise the roof tiles never mind. Call [MASK]? Oh dear no, tai-pan, not.. . not until we’ve informed the police. They should tell her. They know how to do these things.”
<name>Tracy</name>	Tracy	Orlanda	[MASK] was still leaning numbly against the car, the rain on her face mixing with her tears. Another group of police reinforcements poured over the barrier onto the morass and fanned out with heavy-duty flashlights searching the terrain.
<name>Hamilton</name>	Hamilton	Dunross	“Didn’t [MASK]’s engine blow up during the race three years ago and he bloody nearly killed himself?” “Racing cars are always going wrong.” “Yes, yes they do frequently, though they’re not always helped by the opposition.”
<name>Seabiscuit</name>	Seabiscuit	Ian	“I think the governor was wrong, [MASK]. You should have ridden. Then I’d’ve put my modest bet on you. Yes. You’d have gone out in a blaze of glory. Yes, you would have won.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Casey	“Makes you proud to be an American, doesn’t it?” [MASK] said happily, following his look. “If you’re consulate, you’ll get to go aboard her?” “Sure. Guided tour!” “Lucky you.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Armstrong	“Communists?” [MASK] smiled and shook his head. “They don’t have to shoot at us to take over the Colony, or smuggle M14’s—they’ve got guns a-plenty of their own.” “Nationalists? Chiang Kai-shek’s men?”
<name>James</name>	James	Ciranoush	“Now’s not the time, [MASK], oh no. Too many hostile ears. That’d be for your ears only.” They were out in the garden now, the gentle breeze grand, a fine night sky overhead, star filled.
<name>betraying</name>	betraying	Brian	he asked himself over and over, grimly trying to decide and all the while trying to push away the horror of his friend [MASK] and the next session—no, no longer his friend but a committed, highly trained foreign asset and enormously valuable catch that they had by a miracle uncovered.
<name>Chief</name>	Chief	Donald	“Can’t we get more men and equipment, [MASK]?” “Sorry, not at the moment, sir,” the police commissioner replied. He was a strong-faced man in his fifties. “We’re spread rather thinly, I’m afraid.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Casey	“[MASK]!” he shouted, cupping his hands around his mouth. “We’re going below! Go back to the barrier and wait there!” They heard her call back faintly, “Okay, be careful!”
<name>Wang</name>	Wang	Lando	“It’ll be dark then, [MASK]. I wouldn’t want to shift 50 tons of gold in daylight. There might be a few villains around. You never know. Eh?” “My God, you think . . . triads?”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Murtagh	There’s another wrinkle to his offer. I think he’s bananas but [MASK] said he’d try to persuade the brass to put up a revolving $50 million U.S. against the value of the unissued shares you got in your treasury. So you’re home free.
<name>Camille</name>	Camille	Kathy	[MASK] was surprised that her voice was calm and her hands and fingers rested in her lap so easily, betraying none of the horror she felt within. She could almost feel the disease bugs or microbes or viruses seeping through her system, feeding on her nerves, eating them away
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Ayeeyah	She stared at him. “We decided it last night—all the directors. I asked them to tell no one until eleven today.” Reluctantly she took out the hundred-dollar note and offered it. “[MASK], I was particularly attached to this note.”
<name>John</name>	John	Ian	If I miss you at the bank tonight, I’ll catch up with you tomorrow morning.” “Yes. I’m ... please call me, [MASK]. Yes. I want a few minutes with you privately. Tonight or tomorrow.”
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Gavallan	They all began talking at once but [MASK] dominated them. “The V and A has its own water supply—so do a couple of other hotels—but the rest of us’re on four hours of water every fourth day, so you’ve got to use a pail.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Willy	[MASK] rhymes with chilly, that’s all. How did you do on the day?” “I made a pile in commissions.” “I made a pile too.” “Fantastic. I unloaded 100 percent of all my own shares.
<name>Hunt</name>	Hunt	Suslev	“It’s lucky for us they are. It makes our job so much easier.” Once more [MASK] concentrated on the F5’s that looked like soldier hornets among other hornets. Around him the bridge was massed with advanced surveillance equipment. One radar was sweeping the harbor.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Dunross	You could raise 2 mill from one of your friends here, easy, if it’s so good.” “Yes. But I choose to sweeten the lure to you two. By the way, you are held to Tuesday at midnight.” [MASK] said it flat.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Ciranoush	What about the American girl? He chuckled. “Ah, [MASK], what a lovely name,” he said out loud with the same, perfect amount of husky charm that he had used previously. That one’s a pushover, he told himself confidently.
<name>James</name>	James	AMG	The first turned out to be the private number of a high-up official in MI-6—he arrived within half an hour with some of his people and they went through [MASK]’s desk and private papers. They took most of them when they left.
<name>Mr. Linder</name>	Mr. Linder	Quillan	To control you on a line you can so easily break if you wish, my art being to make the too thin line like a steel mesh. Oh but that was not easy to learn! [MASK] was a cruel teacher, oh so cruel.
<name>Mr. Stevens</name>	Mr. Stevens	Dunross	But come to the office before you go home, eh?” “All right. I’ve validated my tickets and everything.” [MASK] heard the pride in his son’s voice and it wanned him. “Good. Well done.
<name>he</name>	he	Suslev	“I’ll think about it,” he said at length. “Leave it for the moment. I’ll call you tonight. Did [MASK] say who the American in the cable was?” “No. He just said it wasn’t anything to do with us.”
<name>he</name>	he	Adryon	They’re all in very good shape I’m glad to say. And yours?” “They’re fine. I do wish [MASK] would go to university though. Dear me, children are very difficult these days, aren’t they?”
<name>his girl</name>	his girl	Lily	If he could not reach her directly he would call the mama-raw and that night he would come to the dance hall, alone or with friends, and he and [MASK] would dance a few dances for face and drink some drinks and then she would leave.
<name>Brock</name>	Brock	Dunross	“I would like three of those please, tai-pan.” He chuckled and went over to the bookcase and pressed a switch. Part of the bookcase swung open. A staircase led upward. [MASK] had used it before to have private talks with the chief manager.
<name>the potter</name>	the potter	Arthur	They’re so thin that the glazes, inside and out, seem to touch.” “I’m almost afraid to hold it.” “Oh, they’re quite strong. Delicate of course but strong. Who could be [MASK]?”
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Dunross	“Even so, it was part of our agreement.” [MASK] watched her, admiring her courage. There had been no tears at the new beginning on the slope, just a numbed nod and, “I’ll wait. I’ll wait until . . .
<name>George</name>	George	Dianne	“Bolt the gates, then you come inside too,” he snapped to his equally nervous chauffeur, then hurried for the front door. “Hurry up, [MASK],” he said, irritably shoving his key into the lock.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Paul	Now he knows too much about us. Yes. But that’s easy to rectify, when I need to, he reminded himself. Any day or any night. 10:03 p.m. : “Well, what the devil are you going to do, [MASK]?”
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Orlanda	“That’s just a matter of money but I can assure you, old chap, she’s not worth it. [MASK]’s dreadful in the sack, I know, and nowadays you can never tell who’s been there before, eh?”
<name>Alexandra</name>	Alexandra	Line	“For ten years?” “Yes,” she said without emotion, feeling nothing, wanting nothing except to weep and to die. Later I can be weak, she thought. Now I must be strong and wise. “For ten years. [MASK] . . .
<name>Wong</name>	Wong	Armstrong	I wish it would rain, he thought. He got into the elevator. Other policemen greeted him and he them. At the third floor he got out and walked along the corridor to his office. [MASK] was waiting for him, idly reading a Chinese newspaper.
<name>Mr. Carter</name>	Mr. Carter	Tiptop	How are you? I hear you may be riding Noble Star next Saturday?” “That’s possible.” They talked about inconsequential matters, then [MASK] said, “And that unfortunate person? At the latest, when is he going to be released?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Dunross	“None. The bank runs’re over.” “Good. What did you have to barter?” [MASK] did not answer him, just shrugged. “We’ll open at 30.” “That remains to be seen.”
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Armstrong	Ah, he’s a professional, [MASK] thought, very pleased, know- ing the man was using the glass as a mirror to case the restaurant. The man took his time. He wore a shapeless plastic raincoat and hat and appeared nondescript.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dunross	[MASK] was concentrating on his landing now, knowing that they would be watched. The chopper was lined up, revs correct for descent, wind ahead and to the right, swirling a little as they came closer to the ground.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Stanley	“Can’t you send that goddamn Soviet spy ship to hell out of port?” “Yes, and we could blow it up, but that would be equally foolish. [MASK], relax, you have to be a little civilized about these things.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Center	“[MASK] said I was to put myself at your disposal. Comrade Captain. What is it you want me to do?” “A man here has a photographic memory. We need to know what’s in it.” “Where is the client to be interrogated?
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Dunross	No, I’ve no wish to see him ever again. He’s awful, dangerous, foul-mouthed and a bloody bore.” [MASK] laughed. “I agree he’s obnoxious and I detest his politics —but he’s only one of a half dozen MPs.
<name>Snape</name>	Snape	Marlowe	“I had no idea that [MASK] . . . Disgusting! Well, you never know, do you?” “He’s a bastard, always was, always will be—him and his filthy Yank friend.
<name>probably</name>	probably	Ian	“Even you’re not that fat-headed!” “It’s a last resort, [MASK]. A serious last resort.” “You’ll call an immediate board meeting to discuss the Ho-Pak takeover?” “Good lord, no.”
<name>Dirk</name>	Dirk	Travkin	Above, the sky was blacker and lowering. A sprinkle started and a nervous groan slipped from fifty thousand throats. “It’s rotten, tai-pan,” [MASK] said, “the going’s rotten.” “It’s the same for everyone.”
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Line	I, I enjoyed your kiss.” “So did I.” Again he grinned at her. “You can call me [MASK].” After a pause she said, “I’ve never felt so wanting and swamped, and because of that very frightened.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Armstrong	Not officially.” [MASK] looked around. There were the usual gaping bystanders but they appeared haphaz- ard. “They’re here though. Somewhere.” Both men felt the hackles on their necks rising. “You can get on with it.”
<name>Doc</name>	Doc	Dunross	So you’re home free. If.” [MASK] felt the sweat break out on his back and on his forehead, well aware what a tremendous gamble that would be, however big the bank. With effort he put his brain to work.
<name>Baby Kochamma</name>	Baby Kochamma	Orlanda	“[MASK]?” “Yes, my darling, I’m here. Oh how wonderful you are!” She cradled him happily, so glad that she had given her amah the day and the night away. “Go back to sleep, we’ve all the time in the world, sleep.”
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Poon	And never danger. And never a lost cargo. And cargo with beepers. You don’t even need to be anywhere near the drop. Only a week later, heya?” “That would be perfect,” [MASK] said fervently.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Dunross	The poor bugger’s in a pickle. Look’t those!” Heavy steel H-beams were blocking the way down. “We daren’t use cutters, too much gas.” “There must be another way? From the side?” [MASK] asked.
<name>Ahab</name>	Ahab	Automatically	His eyes went to the southeast, seeking the signal. It was overdue but he was not yet worried. [MASK] his nose sniffed the wind and his tongue tasted it, tangy and heavy with salt. His eyes ranged the sky and the sea and the horizon.
<name>Dirk</name>	Dirk	Tiptop	[MASK] coughed and blew his nose. “It’s curious, tai-pan,” he said, “very curious that you go out of your way to help the Victoria and Blacs and all your capitalist banks while the strong rumor is that they’ll not help you in your need.”
<name>James</name>	James	Dunross	[MASK] got up and stretched out his hand, not sure if he had succeeded but very sure he had better do something about the thorium very quickly, certainly before 2:30. “Thank you for seeing me.” “What about our fifth race?”
<name>Voldemort</name>	Voldemort	Sevrin	Absently he stared out of the windows, the view ever pleasing. But tonight he was filled with foreboding, thinking about [MASK] and the traitor and all the other evil things the report had foretold. What to do? “Laugh,” he said out loud.
<name>boss</name>	boss	Casey	“I don’t agree.” “Sure, [MASK], I know,” he said calmly. “But it’s my $2 million and my game.” “Yes, and your word and your face! You shook on the deal.”
<name>let's assume it's a person's name and not a type of food</name>	let's assume it's a person's name and not a type of food	Orlanda	It will only take me twenty minutes and you can read the paper while you wait. Then afterwards we can leave everything for when the amah comes back and go dancing or drive. What do you say?” “Italian’s my favorite food, [MASK]!”
<name>she</name>	she	Casey	“You have to be chosen by the previous one. It’s his decision.” “Have you chosen who’ll follow you?” “No,” he said, but [MASK] thought that he had. Why should he tell me, she asked herself.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Gornt	Then [MASK] caught a lingering whiff of her perfume and he was swept back momentarily into memories of their pillowing. When she was young, he reminded himself. Thank God there’s no premium on youth or beauty out here, and a substitution’s as close as a phone call or a hundred-dollar note.
<name>Dr. Vogel</name>	Dr. Vogel	Dunross	“Yes—one year initially, extended to five if everything goes well. After five?” “Another five,” [MASK] said. “If we achieve the results I want, your retainer will be doubled.” “Ah. That’s very generous.
<name>May-may</name>	May-may	Claudia	so happy you weren’t hurt, tai-pan.” “Thank you.” She left. He noticed her walk, then [MASK]’s look. Some of his gravity left him. “Nothing like a pretty bird. Is there?”
<name>John</name>	John	Tiptop	She’s the best wife a man could have. Since coming back from the track at dawn he had worked steadily. Half a hundred cables. Dozens of international phone calls. Countless locals. At 9:30 he had called the governor about [MASK]’s proposal.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Christian	[MASK] will need all the help he can get. Second, y—” “Help?” “Haven’t you heard about his wife?” “What about her?” “Don’t you know she’s dead?” They stared at him blankly.
<name>him</name>	him	Bartlett	Shall I cancel them?” “No. I’ll talk to [MASK]—he’ll understand. I did invite her to Saturday’s races though, with him.” “Oh, that’s two too many. I’ll cancel the Pangs, they won’t mind.
<name>myself</name>	myself	Casey	I’d never planned to jerk it—that was just testing [MASK]. The Struan deal’s good either way. The Gornt deal’s good, either way. So my plan’s still good— I can still jump either way, though the timing’s critical.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Line	He left the balcony and weaved through the tables heading for the elevators that would take him back upstairs. Many people watched him, some greeted him, most envious of the little badges fluttering in his lapel. “Hi, [MASK]!”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Crosse	“Find out quietly who else’s read the AMG file today—apart from [MASK]—quick as you can.” “My thought too.” “If he’s the only one who read it . . . well, it’s another piece of evidence.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Brian	“As many as you can afford.” “How long do I hold them?” “How are your cojones?” [MASK] whistled tonelessly. “Thanks.” He thought a moment, then forced his mind once more onto the matters in hand.
<name>Victoria</name>	Victoria	Struan	“It’s that or [MASK]’s goes under—providing you hold tight and you’ve voting control. Once the bank gets his block of stock away from him ... if you control the board, and therefore the Victoria Bank, then he’s finished.”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Armstrong	[MASK] stared after him, hating him. The bugger’s right though, he thought, his chest hurting. There’s plenty more but once you take the first, what about the second and though you give nothing, admit nothing, guarantee nothing, there will come a time.
<name>Lex Luthor</name>	Lex Luthor	Suslev	“I would not like to be the cause of... of his removal or that of the others.” [MASK] laughed. “It’s not necessary to kill to eliminate! Are we barbarians? Of course not.” He was watching his protege closely.
<name>Holly</name>	Holly	Orlanda	Good night, [MASK],” she said, wanting to scream at her. You make your money on your back, I work for mine, and all the love you protest is spelled money. Men are such jerks.
<name>Rick</name>	Rick	Dunross	meanwhile sample the foods of our famous chefs. It was business as usual except that temporarily the restaurant was on land and not on the sea. [MASK] walked along the wharf toward one of the sea steps. There were clusters of sampans nearby, big and small.
<name>Voldemort</name>	Voldemort	Crosse	“Who told you my name?” “Your superiors.” [MASK] watched him, his eyes suddenly pitiless. “You know me, I know you. That’s fair, isn’t it?” “Of... of course. I...”
<name>darling</name>	darling	Penn	You’ll have to put him on the aircraft, make sure he has his passport... You can easily make an excuse for me tonight as I’m leaving.” He smiled faintly. “Of course, [MASK], but what’s the real reason?”
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Ian	She could not see his face so she could not read him. “You’re sorry that . . . that [MASK]’s alive?” “No. On the contrary. Where did he go?” “Down there.” She took his flashlight and directed it.
<name>James</name>	James	Bartlett	You want to say hello or anything?” “No thanks. Plenty of time later. Tell them both to go home.” “They won’t. I’m afraid you’re rather popular.” [MASK] laughed and sat up and bumped his head.
<name>Leto</name>	Leto	Wu	[MASK] remembered all the profits he and his family had made secretly over the generations, with or without the help of the Noble House, in peace and war, trading where barbarian ships could not: contraband, gold, gasoline, opium, rubber, machinery, medical drugs, anything and everything in short supply.
