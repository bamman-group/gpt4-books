<name>Momma</name>	Momma	Minnie	“Going out?” “Shopping. Scoot now, go on. You’re too nice to me, really you are.” [MASK] backed away. “Don’t wait too long,” she said. “It’s going to lose its vitamins.”
<name>Marcello</name>	Marcello	Minnie	“Eat out.” “The hell I will.” He slapped her behind through the blanket. Everything came back: the dreams, the drinks, [MASK]’s chocolate mousse, the Pope, that awful moment of not-dreaming.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Guy	I’m not sulking at all.” “Oh hell,” [MASK] said, “we’ll go.” “No, no, what for? We don’t have to. I shopped for dinner before she came, so that’s no problem.”
<name>her</name>	her	Guy	But finally did, and she was inside, slamming the door as the elevator door opened, hooking in the chain as [MASK]’s key went into the lock. She turned the bolt and the key turned it right back again. The door opened and pushed in against the chain.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Guy	In the center was a bed. She went to it and lay down, and was suddenly surrounded by naked men and women, ten or a dozen, with [MASK] among them. They were elderly, the women grotesque and slack-breasted.
<name>Holly</name>	Holly	Guy	“He switched it around, but he didn’t really change it for something else. And this way he can get into hotels.” She went away from [MASK], to the window where the Scrabble set lay. “I won’t let them in again,” she said.
<name>person</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	person (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Dominick	Why had she met that stupid [MASK]? She should never have gone out today at all. It was too hot and sticky. There was a great raspberry crepe dress that looked like a Rudi Gernreich. After Tuesday, after she was her own real shape again, maybe she would go in and price it.
<name>Grady</name>	Grady	Toby	Cars on the avenue slowed questioningly; windows scraped open in the Bram-ford and heads looked out beside gargoyles’ heads. The night doorman [MASK] came from the house with a tan blanket that a policeman turned to take from him.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Minnie	He was large-eyed, tense. “She don't see,” [MASK] said. “As long as she ate the mouse she can’t see nor hear. She’s like dead. Now sing.”
<name>the real estate agent</name>	the real estate agent	Rosemary	Do you have children?” “We plan to,” [MASK] said. “It’s an ideal child’s room, with a full bathroom and a large closet. The whole set-up is made to order for a young couple like yourselves.”
<name>Laura</name>	Laura	Rosemary	“Did he hit you with a lamp?” “He didn’t hit me with anything,” [MASK] said. “It’s a very difficult part, a crippled boy who pretends that he’s adjusted to his crippled-ness.
<name>he</name>	he	Hutch	And rushed home wearing his make-up just before [MASK] missed his glove? She brushed her hair and tied it, and put on a brassiere and panties. She went into the kitchen and drank two glasses of cold milk. She didn’t know.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Drat	“My sister.” “Oh. Everything okay?” “Yes. She was afraid something had happened to me. She had a feeling.” “Oh?” “We’re to stay home tonight.” “[MASK].
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Terry	“To thank me for telling them that [MASK] was grateful to them. I think she really just wanted to see the apartment. She’s absolutely the nosiest person I’ve ever seen. She actually asked the prices of things.”
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Andy	She tucked them down into the fold between her thumb and her palm and faked the swallowing, and later pushed the pills as far as she could between the mattress and the box spring beneath it. She felt stronger and more wide-awake. Hang on, [MASK]!
<name>Monica</name>	Monica	Rosemary	You look a little tired.” “Thanks for the understatement,” [MASK] said. “I’m not all right but I will be. I’m pregnant.” “You aren’t! How great! When?” “June twenty-eighth.
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Guy	“Even if it folds,” [MASK] said, “it’s the kind of part that gets noticed. You’ll see; he’ll get something else right after.” He opened the corner of his sandwich, looked in bitterly, closed it, and started eating.
<name>Auntie</name>	Auntie	Margaret	There’s nothing for you to worry about. I’ve never been healthier or happier.” “It was such a strong feeling,” [MASK] said. “From the minute I woke up. I’m so used to taking care of you little brats . . .”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Guy	“[MASK], listen,” she said, and looked up at him, suddenly serious. “Let’s make this a new beginning, okay? A new openness and talking-to-each-other. Because we haven’t been open.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Rosemary	but there’s a way of making it up.” She dropped the filigree ball back into her blouse. [MASK] said, “It’s nice to know there are people like that, when you hear so much about apathy and people who are afraid of getting involved.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Guy	She said, “All right, you, just take it easy. You’ve got five more months yet, so save your energy.” And laughing, “Talk to it, [MASK]; you’re its father. Tell it not to be so impatient.”
<name>where</name>	where	Rosemary	It was here, [MASK] would remember, that a dead baby wrapped in newspaper had not so long ago been found. Whose baby had it been, and how had it died? Who had found it? Had the person who left it been caught and punished?
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Rosemary	“No, I don’t,” [MASK] said, letting the subject be changed. “I try to every once in a while but nothing ever hangs right.” It turned out to be a fairly pleasant evening.
<name>Leatherface</name>	Leatherface	Protest	This is real, this is happening. [MASK] woke in her eyes and throat, but something covered Her face, smothering her in a sweet stench. The hugeness kept driving in her, the leathery body banging itself against her again and again and again.
<name>Sherwin-Williams</name>	Sherwin-Williams	Rosemary	The painters came on Wednesday the eighteenth; patched, spackled, primed, painted, and were gone on Friday the twentieth, leaving colors very much like [MASK]’s samples. A solitary paperhanger came in and grumbled and papered the bedroom.
<name>June</name>	June	Rosemary	She was a slow and thorough washer. “If your sisters have lots of children, chances are you will too. Things like that go in families.” “Oh, we’re fertile, all right,” [MASK] said, waiting towel in hand for the glass.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Rosemary	That’s why they get so much foreign mail.” “Yes, but why in the living room?” [MASK] said. “They have three or four other rooms, all with the doors closed. Why doesn’t he use one of those?”
<name>he</name>	he	Guy	She took the emergency money [MASK] kept under his underwear—a not very thick fold of bills—and put it into her handbag, put in her address book too and the bottle of vitamin capsules. A contraction came and went, the second of the day.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Rosemary	He simply said “It’s about time” and put his stethoscope to [MASK]’s really-showing-now belly. Listening to the stirring baby, he betrayed an excitement that was unexpected in a man who had guided hundreds upon hundreds of pregnancies.
<name>Michelangelo</name>	Michelangelo	Michelangelo	It was the first time the Sistine Chapel had been opened to the public and she was inspecting the ceiling on a new elevator that carried the visitor through the chapel horizontally, making it possible to see the frescoes exactly as [MASK], painting them, had seen them.
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Minnie	“No,” she said, “no,” the knife hanging at her side. “No. It can’t be. No.” “Go look at His hands,” [MASK] said. “And His feet.”
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Hutch	[MASK] looked at them for a moment, then sat back and struck the table with wide-apart palms. “Enough,” he said. “I shall mind my own business, as I ought to have done from the outset. Make fires in your working fireplace!
<name>she</name>	she	Rosemary	“You’re due any day now, aren’t you?” the woman said, waiting by the desk. “Tuesday,” [MASK] said. “Good luck,” the woman said. “You’re smart to get it over with before July and August.”
<name>June</name>	June	Rosemary	“I feel much better now,” [MASK] said. “Some pregnancies start out bad and turn good, and some go the other way around. I’m glad I’ve had the bad first and have gotten it out of the way.”
<name>Tiffany</name>	Tiffany	Minnie	Her appetite, in fact, seemed smaller than usual. Coffee and toast was enough for breakfast, a vegetable and a small piece of rare meat for dinner. Each morning at eleven [MASK] brought over what looked like a watery pistachio milkshake. It was cold and sour.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Hutch	“I won’t let them in again,” she said. “And as soon as the baby is old enough I want to sub-let and move. I don’t want them near us. [MASK] was right; we never should have moved in here.”
<name>she</name>	she	Rosemary	“I could help you dish things out.” “Thank you, that’s sweet of you,” [MASK] said, “but I really can manage by myself. It’s going to be buffet, and there’ll be very little to do.”
<name>The woman</name>	The woman	Guy	There are hooks in the wall and clean places. And the one picture that is there, over the mantel, doesn’t fit. There are two inches of clean at both sides of it.” [MASK] looked at her. “I didn’t notice,” he said.
<name>she</name>	she	Guy	She bought cotton balls and cotton swabs and talcum powder and baby lotion; engaged a diaper service and rearranged the baby’s clothing in the bureau drawers. She ordered the announcements—[MASK] would phone in the name and date later—and addressed and stamped a boxful of small ivory envelopes.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Minnie	“I could tell by the way you turned sort of cool to us,” [MASK] said. “Oh, don’t apologize, dear; you’re not the first and you won’t be the last. I can’t say that I really blame you.
<name>Charlton</name>	Charlton	Guy	You have a most interesting inner quality, [MASK]. It appears in your television work too, and it should carry you very far indeed; provided, of course, that you get those initial ‘breaks’ upon which even the greatest actors are to some degree dependent.
<name>Guy</name>	Guy	Guy	“It smells,” she said. “There’s stuff in it called tannis root.” She held out her hand. “From the famous greenhouse.” [MASK] smelled and shrugged. “It’s not bad,” he said.
<name>Holly</name>	Holly	Terry	[MASK] said, “Listen, we could come down together regular. Your door is by the service elevator, isn’t it? I could ring your bell and we could come down together. We could call each other first on the house phone.”
<name>Mrs. Breedlove</name>	Mrs. Breedlove	Rosemary	Her lavender-tinted hair, a wig, had slipped forward; sparse white hairs stuck out at the back of her neck. [MASK] got out of bed, slid her feet into slippers, and put on the blue-and-white quilted housecoat she had bought for the hospital.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Guy	With her small suitcase she hurried into the house. The elevator man hadn’t taken [MASK] down, but he had been off duty from eleven-fifteen to twelve. He was there, though. The No Strings album was playing.
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Hutch	No, I’ve lost only three pounds and one little space more. And it’s perfectly normal to lose a little during the first few months. Later on I’ll be gaining.” “I certainly hope so,” [MASK] said.
<name>Anne Shirley</name>	Anne Shirley	Brian	He was—some kind of a half-breed. And how dear and sweet he had looked before he had opened those yellow eyes! The tiny chin, a bit like [MASK]’s; the sweet mouth; all that lovely orange-red hair ...
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Rosemary	“You look like Miss Concentration Camp of 1966. Are you sure this doctor knows what he’s doing?” [MASK] began to sob, quietly and defeatedly, holding the spoons in the salad. Tears ran from her cheeks.
<name>Isadora</name>	Isadora	Miss	“You’d better go down below, [MASK],” he said, courteous but hating her, not even waiting to hear the warning she had brought. Below was a huge ballroom where on one side a church burned fiercely and on the other a black-bearded man stood glaring at her.
<name>George</name>	George	Roman	“Anyone who needs more than one suitcase,” he said as he double-locked their door, “is a tourist, not a traveler.” On the sidewalk, while the doorman blew his whistle at oncoming cars, [MASK] checked through tickets, passport, traveler’s checks, and French currency.
<name>Patrick</name>	Patrick	Guy	Her thighs stung; she pushed the blanket from them and saw more scratches, seven or eight going this way and that. “Don’t yell,” [MASK] said. “I already filed them down.” He showed short smooth fingernails.
<name>Dr. Seward</name>	Dr. Seward	Rosemary	“That’s ridiculous,” he said. “Pregnant women gain weight, they don’t lose it. And they look healthy, not—” “There’s a slight complication,” [MASK] said, leading the way into the living room.
<name>She</name>	She	Rosemary	Of course with her it could be chocolate mouse, so eat with care.” [MASK] laughed happily. “That’s wonderful,” she said. “It’s what I was going to make.” “See?”
<name>Andy</name>	Andy	Rosemary	He still had his make-up on; his face was orange, his eyes black-lashed and large. “You’re the surprise,” [MASK] said. “What happened?” “Ah, they stopped in the middle for a rewrite, the dumb bastards.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Rosemary	That was awfully good-natured of Guy. Most people wouldn’t have had the—well, class, I guess. I wouldn’t have had it, I can tell you that.” “The loser buying the winner a drink,” [MASK] said.
<name>Clarisse</name>	Clarisse	Rosemary	“Or maybe you thought it was your own you were smelling. What is it, a chemical thing?” [MASK] stood up and put down Time and picked up her suitcase. “My husband is outside; I have to tell him something,” she said.
<name>Mrs. Carpenter</name>	Mrs. Carpenter	Rosemary	“No,” [MASK] said, smiling, “but our apartment is right behind theirs and used to be the back part of it.” “Oh for goodness’ sake,” the girl said, “you’re the party that took the old lady’s apartment!
<name>Rosemary</name>	Rosemary	Guy	“Aren’t you going to wear it?” [MASK] asked. “It smells,” she said. “There’s stuff in it called tannis root.” She held out her hand. “From the famous greenhouse.”
<name>she</name>	she	Guy	And the phone rang. And [MASK] said, “No, just cancel it, operator.” And there was another contraction, faint and disconnected from her floating eggshell head. All the exercises had been for nothing. All wasted energy.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Rosemary	“I can’t get over the change! It looks so much brighter! Oh and look at that chair. Isn’t that handsome?” “It just came Friday,” [MASK] said. “What did you pay for a chair like that?”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Guy	[MASK] said, “Wednesday night you wouldn’t have guessed she had a sad thought in her mind.” “Nothing but sad thoughts,” the policeman said, opening his pad holder. He laid the paper inside it and closed the holder with a width of yellow sticking out.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Guy	No, it was tannis root not perfume that the apartment had smelled of that night; she had had to wrap the charm in foil because of it. And [MASK] had been far too energetic and amorous to have spent the earlier part of the night with someone else.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Guy	Come on, give it to me. You’ll read it tomorrow.” “[MASK]—” “No,” he said. “I mean it. Come on, give it to me.” She said “Ohh” and gave it to him.
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Roman	“Hurts less when I move around,” she said, going out of the room; and went to the front door trying to recall if there was anything she had ordered that hadn’t been delivered yet. It was [MASK], looking slightly winded.
<name>George</name>	George	Guy	“Honey,” [MASK] said, “if we get friendly with an old couple like that we’re never going to get them off our necks. They’re right here on the same floor with us, they’ll be looking in six times a day.
<name>Mildred</name>	Mildred	Rosemary	“It was delicious,” [MASK] said. “You’ll have to give me the recipe.” “I’d love to. You going marketing? Would you do me a teeny favor? Six eggs and a small Instant Sanka; I’ll pay you later.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Elise	By two o’clock everyone had gone and they were alone in the living room, with dirty glasses and used napkins and spilling-over ashtrays all around. (“Don’t forget,” [MASK] had whispered, leaving. Not very likely.)
<name>she</name>	she	Rosemary	It looks like we’re just two of a kind that go the same places and do the same things! Why, what’s the matter, dear? You look so sad and downcast.” “I just heard some bad news,” [MASK] said.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Andy	We’re not through yet, [MASK]! She stopped the car at nine, then at six, then halfway past seven, and then close enough to seven to open the gate and the door and step four inches down. She walked through the turns of hallway as quickly as she could.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Minnie	The doorbell rang and she went to answer it holding the still-unopened package; it was [MASK] with the drink and the little white cake. “I heard you come in,” she said. “It certainly wasn’t very long.”
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Guy	The bitter prickly odor had even found its way into the bathroom. She got a piece of aluminum foil from the kitchen and wound the charm in a tight triple wrapping, twisting the ends to seal them. “It’ll probably lose its strength in a few days,” [MASK] said.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Rosemary	“All right, don’t eat it,” he said; “you don’t wear the charm she gave you, you might as well not eat her dessert too.” Confused, [MASK] said, “What does one thing have to do with the other?”
<name>Bobby</name>	Bobby	Rosemary	“I’m sorry, honey, call her up and tell her we can’t make it.” “All right, I will,” [MASK] said, and drew another line with the crayon and the yardstick.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Guy	They looked painfully at each other. “I’ve got the part,” [MASK] said. “It’s a hell of a way to get it.” He looked at the paint remover in his hand and put it on the night table.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Rosemary	He had a white T shirt on underneath. “I generally prefer doing this to music,” he said, and took off the T shirt too. He went close to the bed and, leaning, showed [MASK] his left shoulder. It was unmarked.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Guy	Was it possible (the shower to wash away the smell of a tannis anointing) that [MASK] had joined the coven? That he (no, he couldn’t be!) was one of them, with a secret mark of membership somewhere on his body?
<name>Eris</name>	Eris	Satan	“Hail [MASK]!” She backed away—“No, no”—backed farther and farther away until she was between two bridge tables. A chair was behind her; she sat down on it and stared at them. “No.”
<name>Miss Bates</name>	Miss Bates	Guy	“Dear girl,” [MASK] said, “that was an act of superhuman courage and self-sacrifice. I said to myself, ‘Ye gods, I’ll bet nobody’s ever asked this old bat for seconds on anything in her entire life!
<name>Offred</name>	Offred	Ro	“And you haven’t been, really. I mean, suppose you’d had a baby and lost it; wouldn’t it be the same? And we’re getting so much in return, [MASK].” She put the handkerchief on the table and looked at him.
<name>Norma</name>	Norma	Guy	She gripped the knife tighter. “Yes,” she said, “I killed her. I stabbed her to death. And I cleaned my knife and I’ll stab to death whoever comes near me. Tell them how sharp it is, [MASK]!”
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Guy	“No,” [MASK] said, “she just wanted us to try her chocolate mouse, seein’ as how it’s one of her speci-a/-ities.” “It looks good.” “It does, doesn’t it.”
<name>Bonnie</name>	Bonnie	Rosemary	In a small house with a shop on the street and an apartment overhead. It was demolished in 1954—for no especially pressing purpose, since as far as I know the plot was left empty.” [MASK] worked her spoon in melon.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Rosemary	The pants were lime green under a blue blouse; the blade of a screwdriver poked from her hip pocket. Stopping between the doorways of the den and kitchen, she turned and put on her neckchained glasses and smiled at [MASK].
<name>Doctor</name>	Doctor	Guy	You can start on another in a very few months and the odds are thousands to one against anything similar happening. It was a tragic one-in-ten-thousand mishap; the baby itself was perfectly healthy and normal.” [MASK] squeezed her hand and smiled encouragingly at her.
<name>her husband</name>	her husband	Guy	One day she realized that the four boards in the hall closet were shelves, fitting across to sit on wood cleats on the side walls. She covered them with gingham contact paper and, when [MASK] came home, showed him a neatly filled linen closet.
<name>Dr. Kennicott</name>	Dr. Kennicott	Tiffany	“A boy.” “Really? A boy?” He nodded. “And it’s all right?” “Yes.” She let her eyes close, then managed to open them again. “Did you call [MASK]’s?” she asked.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Rosemary	It blinked into ice-blue fluorescent light. “I’ll see what I can do and then I’ll check you over.” [MASK] hefted herself up and went with her handbag into the examining room. “Anything they’ve got,” she said.
<name>George</name>	George	Honey	“The way you haven’t been looking at me.” “What are you talking about? I’ve been looking at you.” “No you haven’t.” “I have so. [MASK], what is it? What’s the matter?”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Minnie	She drank the cold sour drink from the blue-and-green-striped glass while [MASK] looked on approvingly. Four She had been eating her meat rare; now she ate it nearly raw—broiled only long enough to take away the refrigerator’s chill and seal in the juices.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Guy	She snicked open her handbag at her side, worked a finger through her key ring, and, near the elevator door, turned the handbag all the way over, spilling out everything except the keys. Rolling lipstick, coins, [MASK]’s tens and twenties fluttering, everything.
<name>Brett</name>	Brett	Guy	[MASK] said that subconsciously she was still a good Catholic, and she protested enough to support the explanation. Indulgently he studied the calendar and avoided the “dangerous days,” and she said, “No, it’s safe today, darling; I’m sure it is.”
<name>he</name>	he	Guy	“If it’s going to turn into a big scene —” She took a full spoonful of the mousse and thrust it into her mouth. “It isn’t going to turn into a big scene,” [MASK] said.
<name>Azazel</name>	Azazel	Satan	Save the world from God-knows-what. From [MASK]-knows-what. A tail! The buds of his horns! She wanted to scream, to die. She would do it, throw it out and jump. They were all milling around now.
<name>Bella</name>	Bella	Andy	Oh, [MASK]! She reached out to him, her knife turning away; his lips pouted and he opened his eyes and looked at her. His eyes were golden-yellow, all golden-yellow, with neither whites nor irises; all golden-yellow, with vertical black-slit pupils.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Guy	She looked away, her hands pulling the blanket back over her thighs. “I dreamed someone was—raping me,” she said. “I don’t know who. Someone —unhuman.” “Thanks a lot,” [MASK] said.
<name>Myrtle</name>	Myrtle	Margaret	“[MASK]?” “My sister.” “Oh. Everything okay?” “Yes. She was afraid something had happened to me. She had a feeling.” “Oh?” “We’re to stay home tonight.”
<name>she</name>	she	Fm	I’ve been letting the other girls have the fun of visiting with you, but now [MASK] going to take a turn. You’re in a regular movie theater here! Is there anything good on tonight?” Nobody else was in the apartment.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Guy	People are actually dying, it’s so hot.” She heard it again that afternoon, and mysteriously her breasts began to leak . . . “Some new people moved in,” [MASK] said out of nowhere that evening. “Up on eight.”
<name>she</name>	she	Rosemary	It was this undimmed first-time excitement, [MASK] thought, that probably marked the difference between a great obstetrician and a merely good one. She bought maternity clothes; a two-piece black dress, a beige suit, a red dress with white polka dots.
<name>Patrick</name>	Patrick	Rosemary	[MASK] showed him in. He was wearing a black-and-white checked jacket over a blue shirt and a wide paisley tie. He passed close to her and she noticed for the first time that his ears were pierced—that the left one was, at any rate.
