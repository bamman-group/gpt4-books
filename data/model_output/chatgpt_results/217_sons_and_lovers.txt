<name>Tom</name>	Tom	William	No one spoke. After a while he threw his boots under the table and went to bed. “Why didn't you let me have a go at him?” said [MASK], when his father was upstairs. “I could easily have beaten him.”
<name>Quasimodo</name>	Quasimodo	Fanny	“It wasn't ME who wanted him to play with the machine,” she said. As a rule, when all the girls came back at two o'clock, he ran upstairs to [MASK], the hunchback, in the finishing-off room.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Paul	“Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep.” “She says you're to go to sleep,” the father repeated gently to [MASK]. “Well, I want HER to come,” insisted the boy.
<name>Blackie</name>	Blackie	Miriam	She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her for being a baby. On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man. [MASK] did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the others went to the “Coons”.
<name>Colin</name>	Colin	Paul	[MASK] looked down the garden for his mother. Her head appeared among the young currant-bushes. “Come here!” she cried. “What for?” he answered. “Come and see.” She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Annie	“A little,” she replied plaintively. And he would put some water with it, so that it should not nourish her. Yet he loved her more than his own life. She had morphia every night, and her heart got fitful. [MASK] slept beside her.
<name>Death</name>	Death	Miriam	She could not forgive him. [MASK] killed the joy and the warmth in him. He had been such a jolly lad, and full of the warmest affection; now he grew colder, more and more irritable and gloomy.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Miriam	Now it was the same again. And she could do nothing for him. He had to go on alone, make his own way. He continued faithful to [MASK]. For one day he had loved her utterly. But it never came again.
<name>Albert</name>	Albert	Paul	But [MASK] was dying for the man to know they were expecting someone by the London train: it sounded so grand. Yet he was much too much scared of broaching any man, let alone one in a peaked cap, to dare to ask.
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Paul	[MASK] never forgot, after one of these fierce internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up, slowly, between the waste road over the hilltop, steadily, like a great bird. And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be turned to blood.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Paul	she exclaimed. “How much was the cheque?” “Ten pounds eleven,” said [MASK] irritably. He dreaded what was coming. “And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an' his club this week! But I know him.
<name>he</name>	he	Miriam	He was more or less under her spell again. As usual, they were discussing the sermon. He was setting now full sail towards Agnosticism, but such a religious Agnosticism that [MASK] did not suffer so badly. They were at the Renan Vie de Jesus stage.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Paul	But [MASK] was going to distinguish himself. She had a great belief in him, the more because he was unaware of his own powers. There was so much to come out of him. Life for her was rich with promise. She was to see herself fulfilled.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Barker	“Did you have that flannel singlet made?” “Not yet,” he smiled. “Then, why didn't you?” she cried. “It'll come,” he smiled. “Ah, an' Doomsday!” exclaimed [MASK].
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Clara	[MASK] had always been “ikey”, reserved, and superior. She had never mixed with the girls as one of themselves. If she had occasion to find fault, she did it coolly and with perfect politeness, which the defaulter felt to be a bigger insult than crassness.
<name>her</name>	her	Miriam	He looked down again to [MASK]. “Clouds are on fire,” he said. “Beautiful!” she cried. She seemed so small, so soft, so tender, down there. He threw a handful of cherries at her. She was startled and frightened.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Morel	“And when does he handle th' money?” asked the collier. “That I couldn't tell you. When the picture is sent home, I suppose.” There was silence. [MASK] stared at the sugar-basin instead of eating his dinner.
<name>Dr. Watson</name>	Dr. Watson	Paul	“And what was the matter with you?” asked [MASK] of his mother. “I suppose it's my heart,” she replied. Certainly she looked bluish round the mouth. “And have you felt it before?” “Yes--often enough.”
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Clara	Don't you listen to her. She's for ever on that 'igh horse of hers, an' it's back's that thin an' starved it'll cut her in two one of these days.” [MASK] suffered badly from her mother.
<name>Gregor</name>	Gregor	Paul	[MASK] would go in in the early morning, when his sister got up. His mother was wasted and almost ashen in the morning with the morphia. Darker and darker grew her eyes, all pupil, with the torture. In the mornings the weariness and ache were too much to bear.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Walter	Arena ter for gi'ein' me one for my bit of a lad an' wench?' 'I ham, [MASK], my lad,' 'e says; 'ta'e which on 'em ter's a mind.' An' so I took one, an' thanked 'im.
<name>Wopsle</name>	Wopsle	Morel	“Oh--an' what's agate now?” “He's only enlisted.” [MASK] put down his knife and leaned back in his chair. “Nay,” he said, “that he niver 'as!”
<name>her</name>	her	Miriam	The whole family loved a “take-off” more than anything. He took no notice of [MASK]. Later, she saw him remark her new blouse, saw that the artist approved, but it won from him not a spark of warmth.
<name>He</name>	He	Miriam	He helped his mother to get the tea ready. [MASK] would have gladly proffered, but was afraid. He was rather proud of his home. There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction. The chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old.
<name>Lily</name>	Lily	Edgar	Now she felt there was really something hostile between them, something of which they were ashamed. She ate her cake mechanically. He tried to go on with his argument, but could not get back the right note. Soon [MASK] came in.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Miriam	“Yes,” replied [MASK] in her musical tone. “She's reading.” He wheeled his bicycle into the barn. He had put on a handsome tie, of which he was rather proud, and socks to match. “She came this morning?”
<name>Eppie</name>	Eppie	Annie	He was not home again until a quarter to eleven. His mother was seated in the rocking-chair. [MASK], with a rope of hair hanging down her back, remained sitting on a low stool before the fire, her elbows on her knees, gloomily.
<name>Constance</name>	Constance	Paul	The smoke floated softly up. “I believe she wants you,” said [MASK]. “Do you?” replied the other, soft, satirical, abstract. “Yes. She never really hitched on to me--you were always there in the background.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Fanny	“I'm going to look,” he said. He opened his eyes. [MASK], her long cheeks flushed, her blue eyes shining, was gazing at him. There was a little bundle of paint-tubes on the bench before him. He turned pale.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Miriam	but this did not occur to him. They were silent. There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was becoming habitual with him, particularly when he was with [MASK]. She longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Morel	There were two days' holiday. On the Tuesday morning [MASK] rose early. He was in good spirits. Quite early, before six o'clock, she heard him whistling away to himself downstairs. He had a pleasant way of whistling, lively and musical.
<name>she</name>	she	Miriam	She was walking with a rather striking woman, blonde, with a sullen expression, and a defiant carriage. It was strange how [MASK], in her bowed, meditative bearing, looked dwarfed beside this woman with the handsome shoulders.
<name>Magwitch</name>	Magwitch	Dawes	[MASK] turned over suddenly with a startled grunt. “Eh?” “Caw!” she mocked. “He can only say 'Caw!' I have brought you a gentleman to see you. Now say 'Thank you,' and show some manners.”
<name>Mr. Leeford</name>	Mr. Leeford	Morel	“Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy, who's drunk, I sh'd like ter know?” said [MASK]. He was extraordinarily pleased with himself, because of his day's helping to wait in the Moon and Stars. He chattered on.
<name>Mrs. Ramsay</name>	Mrs. Ramsay	Annie	She regretted what they had been--so small and exquisite. And when [MASK] insisted on her having more stylish blouses to suit her age, she submitted. She even went so far as to allow a black velvet bow to be placed on her hair.
<name>Mother</name>	Mother	Paul	She seemed to be asleep. He stepped softly backwards and forwards at his painting. Suddenly her small voice wailed: “Don't walk about, [MASK].” He looked round. Her eyes, like dark bubbles in her face, were looking at him.
<name>your short hair</name>	your short hair	Minnie	“You shall see, my pigeon! You see if you're not swanky one of these days!” “I'm quite content, my boy,” she smiled. “But you'll have to alter. Look at you with [MASK]!”
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Paul	Then she closed her eyes, giving herself up again in a kiss. She acted of her own free will. What she would do she did, and made nobody responsible. [MASK] felt life changing around him. The conditions of youth were gone.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Clara	“And would YOU let a WOMAN do as she likes?” “Yes; I'll see that she likes to love me. If she doesn't--well, I don't hold her.” “If you were as wonderful as you say--,” replied [MASK].
<name>George</name>	George	Morel	So 'e wor that mad, 'e cossed an' 'e swore, an' t'other chaps they did laugh.” [MASK] was a good mimic. He imitated the manager's fat, squeaky voice, with its attempt at good English.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Miriam	he asked. “Yes; they are very fine,” replied [MASK]. “Which sort do you like best?” he asked. “I don't know. The bronze, I think.” “I don't think you've seen all the sorts.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Arthur	And then, if they were impudent, he said quietly: “Do you mind going on with your work,” and stood and watched. When he celebrated his twenty-third birthday, the house was in trouble. [MASK] was just going to be married.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Paul	“You know how be carries on and says he's never told anything.” “All right,” said [MASK]. But he would almost rather have forfeited the prize than have to tell his father. “I've won a prize in a competition, dad,” he said.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	William	“My new black SUEDE.” “No.” There was a hunt. She had lost them. “Look here, mother,” said [MASK], “that's the fourth pair she's lost since Christmas--at five shillings a pair!”
<name>The woman</name>	The woman	Paul	She'll last through to-morrow.” “I don't think so.” “Yes. Go to work.” The miner looked at her again, in fear, and went obediently out of the room. [MASK] saw the tape of his garters swinging against his legs.
<name>Bathsheba</name>	Bathsheba	Miriam	[MASK] heard her greet the lad gaily, knew exactly how brilliant her grey eyes became with that tone. She herself would have felt it bold to have greeted him in such wise. Yet there she stood under the self-accusation of wanting him, tied to that stake of torture.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Morel	As they came out and went along the railway, with the sunny autumn field on one side and a wall of trucks on the other, [MASK] said in a frightened voice: “'E's niver gone, child?” “Yes.” “When wor't?”
<name>Mr. Ramsay</name>	Mr. Ramsay	Morel	They sat down again helplessly. Again came the great, snoring breath. Again they hung suspended. Again it was given back, long and harsh. The sound, so irregular, at such wide intervals, sounded through the house. [MASK], in his room, slept on.
<name>Angel</name>	Angel	Liberty	[MASK]'s had taken several of his painted designs on various stuffs, and he could sell designs for embroideries, for altar-cloths, and similar things, in one or two places. It was not very much he made at present, but he might extend it.
<name>Madame Merle</name>	Madame Merle	Miriam	“Ought I to send this letter?--I doubt it. But there--it is best to understand. Au revoir.” [MASK] read this letter twice, after which she sealed it up. A year later she broke the seal to show her mother the letter.
<name>Mrs. Ramsay</name>	Mrs. Ramsay	Clara	I wished she was sitting comfortably in peace--” “'Darning her husband's stockings,'” said [MASK] scathingly. “I'm sure she wouldn't mind darning even my stockings,” he said. “And I'm sure she'd do them well.
<name>Myrtle</name>	Myrtle	Miriam	[MASK] followed, breathing the fragrance. To her, flowers appealed with such strength she felt she must make them part of herself. When she bent and breathed a flower, it was as if she and the flower were loving each other.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Morel	A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures, its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment [MASK] came in.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Clara	said [MASK], too frightened to speak. “And she looks at me, and she wants to stay with me,” he went on monotonously. “She's got such a will, it seems as if she would never go--never!”
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Miriam	But [MASK] almost fiercely wished she were a man. And yet she hated men at the same time. “But it's as well to be a woman as a man,” he said, frowning. “Ha! Is it? Men have everything.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Annie	Yet he, too, knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously. And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him very much. Yet to [MASK] he said: “Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it.
<name>Mrs. Ramsay</name>	Mrs. Ramsay	Miriam	He would never have got so far in the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family. But now they condescended to listen. [MASK] sat on the sofa absorbed in him. She always seemed absorbed in him, and by him, when he was present.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Annie	[MASK]'s candle flickered, and she whimpered as the first men appeared, and the limbs and bowed heads of six men struggled to climb into the room, bearing the coffin that rode like sorrow on their living flesh. “Oh, my son--my son!”
<name>Meursault</name>	Meursault	Paul	She had a straight chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn. She always reminded [MASK] of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang, even when it was: “Come down lover's lane For a walk with me, talk with me.”
<name>the miner</name>	the miner	Morel	I ham that,” replied [MASK]. “YOU don't know what it is to be tired, as I'M tired.” “No,” replied the clergyman. “Why, look yer 'ere,” said the miner, showing the shoulders of his singlet.
<name>she</name>	she	Miriam	She turned her back on him. Yet everybody could see that the only person she listened to, or was conscious of, was he, and he of her. It pleased the men to see this battle between them. But [MASK] was tortured.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Paul	“Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?” he asked. “Nowt but algibbra an' French,” said a collier. “An' cheek an' impidence,” said another. [MASK] was keeping someone waiting.
<name>John</name>	John	William	There would be the swift, slight “cluck” of her needle, the sharp “pop” of his lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to [MASK].
<name>Darcy</name>	Darcy	Paul	She put down her work, laid her beautiful arms on the table, and looked at him for some moments without answering. Gradually the flush mounted her cheek. “Why?” she asked. [MASK] felt rather awkward.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Paul	“How high you are!” she said. Beside her, on the rhubarb leaves, were four dead birds, thieves that had been shot. [MASK] saw some cherry stones hanging quite bleached, like skeletons, picked clear of flesh.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Miriam	Presently the girl came out. “Tea is ready, mother,” she said in a musical, quiet voice. “Oh, thank you, [MASK], then we'll come,” replied her mother, almost ingratiatingly.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Paul	Next was a flesh-pink “leg”. He went through the few things, wrote out a couple of orders, and called to [MASK] to accompany him. This time they went through the door whence the girl had emerged.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Susan	[MASK] flushed red. “Who's been talking to you?” she replied. “Nobody. I merely heard a whisper that you WERE thinking--” “Well, I am, though you needn't tell anybody. What's more, I wish I wasn't!”
<name>Stradlater</name>	Stradlater	Miriam	Just a fragment remained of the haystack, a monument squared and brown, like a pillar of stone. There was a little bed of hay from the last cutting. “Let us sit here a minute,” said [MASK].
<name>Adèle</name>	Adèle	Miriam	Where's your French?” [MASK] shyly and rather bitterly produced her exercise-book. Every week she wrote for him a sort of diary of her inner life, in her own French. He had found this was the only way to get her to do compositions.
<name>Daffodil</name>	Daffodil	Miriam	But still some had burst, and their gold ruffled and glowed. [MASK] went on her knees before one cluster, took a wild-looking daffodil between her hands, turned up its face of gold to her, and bowed down, caressing it with her mouth and cheeks and brow.
<name>her</name>	her	Miriam	That was all her prayer--not for his soul or his righteousness, but that he might not be wasted. And while he slept, for hours and hours she thought and prayed for him. He drifted away from [MASK] imperceptibly, without knowing he was going.
<name>Ursula</name>	Ursula	Clara	She was dissatisfied and miserable. He was not with her; she was nothing. And in the evening they sat among the sandhills, looking at the black, heavy sea. “She will never give in,” he said quietly. [MASK]'s heart sank.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Paul	The young man ruled some lines in his ledger. The elder man was infuriated. “But wait till I light on you, no matter where it is, I'll settle your hash for a bit, yer little swine!” “All right,” said [MASK].
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Morel	[MASK] attempted to move forward; the other man stepped in front of him. “Are yer goin' to take that top-coat off,” he said, “or are you goin' to lie down to it?”
<name>talking</name>	talking	Verlaine	But he could not kiss her thus--and she seemed to leave no other way. And she yearned to him. He gave a brief laugh. “Well,” he said, “get that French and we'll do some--some [MASK].”
<name>Mademoiselle</name>	Mademoiselle	Sir,--Please	“'[MASK] send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the--”
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Morel	As he grew older [MASK] fell into a slow ruin. His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being, shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness and of paltriness.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Paul	I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't flatter themselves.” “You flatter YOURSELF,” she said quietly. Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained of the file of scented letters, except that [MASK] had
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Clara	He did not tell his mother, but next day he spoke to [MASK] about this interview. It was in the dinner-hour. The two did not often go out together now, but this day he asked her to go with him to the Castle grounds.
<name>Washington</name>	Washington	Morel	[MASK] never in his life played cards, considering them as having some occult, malevolent power--“the devil's pictures,” he called them! But he was a master of skittles and of dominoes. He took a challenge from a Newark man, on skittles.
<name>Abel Magwitch</name>	Abel Magwitch	Morel--“me	“Me!” exclaimed [MASK] a good figure! I wor niver much more n'r a skeleton.” “Man!” cried his wife, “don't be such a pulamiter!” “'Strewth!” he said.
<name>Adolf</name>	Adolf	Postle	she cried; and, with her hair-comb, she combed him straight. “And his nice little moustache!” she exclaimed. She tilted his head back and combed his young moustache. “It's a wicked moustache, '[MASK],” she said.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Annie	There's neither [MASK], nor me, nor anyone now for you.” “What nonsense, mother--you know I don't love her--I--I tell you I DON'T love her--she doesn't even walk with my arm, because I don't want her to.”
<name>The narrator</name>	The narrator	Morel	“You'll sleep, my love,” he said. “Yes,” she answered trustfully. “Good-night.” They put out the light, and it was still. [MASK] was in bed.
<name>Elijah</name>	Elijah	Paul	“Have you bested me? Shall you have a drink of something?” [MASK] and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists, and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all the men than in having a tooth drawn.
<name>Trilby</name>	Trilby	Miriam	“I'd as lief be neighbours with a vixen,” he said, nevertheless making place for her between him and [MASK]. “Did it ruffle his pretty hair, then!” she cried; and, with her hair-comb, she combed him straight.
<name>Mrs. Hopewell</name>	Mrs. Hopewell	Polly	“It was time for work some time back,” said [MASK], marching away with her head in the air. She was an erect little body of forty. In that room were two round spiral machines on the bench under the window.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Morel	After a while she went home. A fine shadow was flung over the deep green meadow, darkening all. As she expected, she found the house empty. But [MASK] was home by ten o'clock, and that day, at least, ended peacefully.
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Paul	“But you look quite pretty in that,” he said. “Yes; they make me so fine, I hardly know myself,” she answered. But when she stood up to walk, the colour went. [MASK] helped her, half-carrying her.
<name>you</name>	you	Baxter	he said. “No,” she answered. “Don't I know you exist?” “About ME you know nothing,” she said bitterly--“about ME!” “No more than [MASK] knew?” he asked. “Perhaps not as much.”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Clara	She glanced at him, finding he did not answer her. His eyes were fixed ahead on [MASK]. “Do you still think she is disagreeable?” she asked. He did not notice that the question was sudden. It ran with his thoughts.
<name>he</name>	he	Paul	He winked at the other men. “Oh well,” said [MASK], “I'll be going!” The mutual friend laid a detaining hand on his shoulder. “Nay,” he said, “you don't get off as easy as that, my lad.
<name>James</name>	James	Annie	she answered quickly. They were silent for a while. “Now go and have your dinner,” she said. “You MUST be hungry.” “Have you had yours?” “Yes; a beautiful sole I had. [MASK] IS good to me.”
<name>Isabelle</name>	Isabelle	Beat	He, with ruffled hair, was sulking upon the sofa. She sat down opposite, in the armchair, and neither spoke. The clock ticked in the silence like blows. “You are a little cat, [MASK],” he said at length, half apologetically.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Clara	“And she looks at me, and she wants to stay with me,” he went on monotonously. “She's got such a will, it seems as if she would never go--never!” “Don't think of it!” cried [MASK].
<name>Eustacia</name>	Eustacia	Miriam	[MASK] had one beautiful evening with him in the hay. He had been on the horse-rake, and having finished, came to help her to put the hay in cocks. Then he talked to her of his hopes and despairs, and his whole soul seemed to lie bare before her.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Everywhere	The girl was romantic in her soul. [MASK] was a Walter Scott heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps. She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl in her own imagination.
<name>Monte Cristo</name>	Monte Cristo	MIRIAM	She wants you.” He pondered over this. Perhaps he was wrong. “But she seems--” he began. “You've never tried,” she answered. CHAPTER XI THE TEST ON [MASK] WITH the spring came again the old madness and battle.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Annie	“Well, why DID you hug them; you needn't have done.” “Then who would?” “Let [MASK] fetch the meat.” “Yes, and I WOULD fetch the meat, but how was I to know.
