<name>Colonel</name>	Colonel	Cacopardo	Show him in.” And so [MASK] was finally brought into the presence of the General. By this time he was just as angry as the General, and being some twenty years the General’s senior, he considered it his privilege to vent his anger first.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Tina	The Major said: “And I know why I like you.” “Why?” “For a very selfish reason: because you make me feel as if I were almost important.” “Oh, you are,” [MASK] said, with just enough mockery in her voice.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Tina	He recognized the boat not only by the fact that there was a morose-looking man sitting on the after-deck, but also by the illuminated inscription, with its letters trailing off into leaves and fruits, just under the eye-piece of the bow: [MASK].
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Bill	You know he ain’t got the trots till we give him this vino. What the hell’s the matter with you?” [MASK] said: “One, two, three, four, five. Why don’t you borrow something from old Four Eyes here to give the Major?
<name>Winston Churchill</name>	Winston Churchill	Nicolo	[MASK] said: “I shouted to him to come away but he wouldn’t. He screamed at the men: *We must fight! The only chance for our nation is to go down fighting. The only chance for us as men is to die in battle.’
<name>Mr. Frank</name>	Mr. Frank	Quattrocchi	Now the children were shouting in unison: “Cara-mellel Caramelle!” The truck drove off toward the police station, where there was not a single piece of candy. The committee of hosts stood waiting in the entrance hall of [MASK]’s house.
<name>the Major</name>	the Major	Tomasino	“What was it?” “One of my ships. A mine, I suppose, just as you warned.” The Major stood up. His face had gone white as soon as [MASK] started talking about the explosion.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Rotondo	The Major said: “Tomorrow evening I want you to go out with [MASK] and two or three others with your truck, and I want you to round up all the children who are on the street shouting for caramels. Take them to the police station and keep them there till it is dark.
<name>Mr. Bumble</name>	Mr. Bumble	Gargano	Trials began at about three in the afternoon, each Monday. [MASK] brought in the first culprit, one Monday afternoon, and as he led him in, he said: “We will take the light cases first.” “You have some serious cases, then?”
<name>Abdullah</name>	Abdullah	Cacopardo	[MASK] the historian said: “He meant no offense. It is an old custom here. Once the important people make us kiss their hands, and later when the actual kissing became too much of a bother, it became the habit merely to mention the kissing, as if it had been done.”
<name>theodore</name>	theodore	Tomasino	You could be different too. It is possible to make your authority seem to spring from the very people over whom you have authority. And after a while, [MASK], it actually does spring from them, and you are only the instrument of their will.
<name>Giuseppe</name>	Giuseppe	Sconzo	It skimmed along on the water and sometimes actually seemed to be a man riding a fish along the surface. [MASK] said: “Do you think the Mister Major is in love with the blonde one? I heard he had his arm around her when the prisoners came back without her Giorgio the other day.”
<name>Emmanuel Goldstein</name>	Emmanuel Goldstein	D’Arpa	After nine years of graft ana stealing and keeping these people down, you’ve thought it over, you want to help, do you?” "You have other Fascists in office here. I saw the face of [MASK] a minute ago.
<name>Il Due</name>	Il Due	Gargano	All they wanted was to pass. Since a large crowd had gathered, it remained for [MASK] the Two-Hands to assert his authority. He whispered to someone in the crowd to run up to the Palazzo and get a force of about six carabinieri.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Giuseppe	We ought to have a big party for a change.” [MASK] said: “How many you want, a Cap?” “Oh, I don’t know, you can get some of these Italians together and decide. I’ll put up whatever dough you need.
<name>the Major</name>	the Major	Tomasino	“Come in,” he grumbled. The Major stepped in and tried to shake his hand but could not find it in the dark. ‘We have to climb many stairs,” [MASK] complained. As a matter of fact, there was only one flight.
<name>her</name>	her	Tina	The kiss made [MASK] start crying. She buried her face in her hands and shook silently. The crowd did not break up for a long time. The men stood right there in the street and told many of their experiences.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Tomasino	“I didn’t bring it, [MASK], it just came. I don’t want the crowd any more than you do. I just want to talk with you about fishing.” “I do not believe it,” the morose man said.
<name>George</name>	George	Sconzo	They were pulling the dripping net in over the starboard bow by this time. When the net was almost in, [MASK] said: "Wait a second, let me look and perhaps I can see what we have before we haul it aboard.”
<name>the driver</name>	the driver	Errante	What the mind of [MASK] did not note was that his new mule, either following an accidental whim or fascinated, like its master, by the children, had tinned at right angles to the street and had stopped walking. Swimming War was coming up the street.
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Zito	[MASK] said: “They had to use six sets of block and tackle. It took them two days to get it down. Then one day to crate it.” The Major said: “I can’t wait that long.”
<name>Uncle Axel</name>	Uncle Axel	Chuck	They went into a dining room. In one comer there was a big glass-faced cabinet containing Venetian glassware on shelves. “Give ’im somethin’ to drink out of,” [MASK] said. He tried the door of the cabinet, but it was locked.
<name>partner</name>	partner	Giuseppe	Just two things now, [MASK]. You ve got to be honest with me; if you’re not, you’ll be in bad trouble. The other is, don’t expect me to do you any favors I wouldn’t do for anyone else, see?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Afronti	[MASK] stepped back. He unbuttoned his coat. He held his cap out at arm’s length and he sang. It was not exactly a tune he sang, but his voice went up and down, very loud.
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Tomasino	“Shoot me, go ahead, shoot me.” “I always wear my pistol, [MASK],” the Major said. “You have come to arrest me because I refused to go and see the American Major,” the morose man said.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Tina	[MASK], I — well, maybe I’d better wait and tell you another time.” She looked up into his face in a way that made him think she was disappointed, but she said very softly: “Maybe you’d better.”
<name>Meinong</name>	Meinong	Gargano	“Huge piles of caramels! Come little children to the picnic. No shouting. No scrambling. Just eating! Come with [MASK].” It was the son of an official, the clean little Saitta boy, who allowed himself to be persuaded first.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Polack	"What do you mean, doing it for me? How could you think I would want you to do anything like that?” [MASK] said: “We was lookin’ for a present for you, sir.”
<name>The American</name>	The American	Tina	“Let’s not talk about war. That’s all I have all day long, war, war, war.” “But I have a special reason for wanting to know,” [MASK] said. “How long do you think it will last?”
<name>sulphur</name>	sulphur	Cacopardo	“You can always eat, you [MASK],” he said. “You have a million lira, you sulphur. You can eat, but not all the people here can eat.” And he turned to the Major: “To eat here is most necessary, more necessary than any bell.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Nicolo	I remember he often used to say: ‘Have you ever tried to figure out what makes two dogs fight each other?’ ” [MASK] turned to the Major and said: “Have you ever thought about that, sir?”
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Borth	The Major said: “There is so much to do, I hardly know where to begin.” [MASK] said: “I know what I must do. I’ve got to find the offices of the Fascist Party, to see if I can find more records.
<name>Major Joppolo</name>	Major Joppolo	Walter	A BELL FOR ADANO binding and began to sort the contents, most of which consisted of tempting memoranda, not enclosed in envelopes. “Gosh, [MASK],” he said, “we Americans certainly go in for a lot of paper work.

<name>Hamidullah</name>	Hamidullah	Giuseppe	And watch: this thing will make you happier than you have ever been in your lives.” Chapter 5 At last, one afternoon a day or two later, the Major found himself alone with [MASK], the interpreter.
<name>Trucks</name>	Trucks	Adano	What the hell’s one paper more or less?” “It might be important.” ‘Well, look at it. What the hell is it about?” “It says: Tor information. Re carts, [MASK].’
<name>food</name>	food	Giuseppe	You don’t a worry.” “Now tell me, what does this town need the most?” “I could a go for a movie house, a boss.” “No, [MASK], I mean right now.” “Food, a boss.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Livingston	“That reminds me,” [MASK] said. “You said you had something on your mind this morning.” “Matter of fact, I have. Since you’ve been getting all the results, I thought maybe — ” “Want to go in the other room?”
<name>Napoleon</name>	Napoleon	Mussolini	These men had only been in one battle, but they were crazy with fear, and also with the wine. One of them would get up and shout: To hell with the son of a frog, [MASK]!’
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Giuseppe	The party started out to be a success from everyone’s Eoint or view. The people of the town were immensely appy: they had not had such a time for years. [MASK], the organizer, basked in constant congratulations.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Polack	He’s bes’ goddam thing ever happened to this town, but he’s gonna get his ass kicked. Now is that any kind of a war?” [MASK] said: "Who’s gonna kick it? Show me the sonofabitch who’s gonna kick it.”
<name>Liberty</name>	Liberty	Zito	It is of bronze, I think. It has a large crack near the bottom from its age. You can see it on postage stamps, and many companies use it for their trade mark.” [MASK] said: “How is the tone?”
<name>Hemingway</name>	Hemingway	Nicolo	But [MASK]’s girl was listening to the story. The Captain said: “Goddamit, I’m going to have to start taking lessons in dago, I can see that. Pass me the vino, will you, Major?”
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Borth	“Where did you get this?” he asked. [MASK] was crying again. “Your desk. I wanted to keep you from seeing it until after the party.” The Major walked out of the room.
<name>Mrs. Jones</name>	Mrs. Jones	Gargano	<!Can you finish this afternoon, do you think?” “Not hardly, sir. But we can have it for you easy by morning.” A little after seven o’clock, [MASK] went out to round up the children who were shouting for caramels.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Zingone	“It smelled a little like the smoke from the Cacopardo Sulphur refinery.” [MASK] was silent for about thirty feet, then he said: “Are you sure it wasn’t smoke from the Cacopardo Sulphur refinery?”
<name>Parker</name>	Parker	Middleton	Trying to reason with any man, and especially with this man, at two hundred feet and the top of one’s lungs was not rewarding work. The General shouted: “Goddamit, [MASK], you trying to stop the goddam invasion too? Do what I say.”
<name>toots</name>	toots	Lord	Oh, there are lots of ways, [MASK], and if I have anything to do with it there’ll be lots more.” His Lordship was getting a wee bit bored. He dipped more and more frequently into his snuffbox and looked out the window.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Joppolo	— it says that the Foundry acknowledged receipt of the bell. That entry was on July the second. I’m afraid your bell is just a hunk of cannon now, [MASK].” “Damn.” “Well, at least I found the records for you.”
<name>Lord Henry</name>	Lord Henry	Gargano	That is a very big thing. If that were visible in every official’s face, well, painters would not be criticized before they were finished.” [MASK] squinted at the portrait and said: “I think the eyes will be all right.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Chuck	Maybe they’d help us think of something.” [MASK] said: “That’s right, let’s go back to old Four Eyes’ house. Maybe we’ll think of something there. Take a drink, think of something.”
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Errante	One afternoon [MASK] was driving this new mule through the town. It was late in the afternoon, the hour when most of the children of the town got out on the Via Umberto the First and shouted for caramels. American military traffic seemed to be particularly heavy at that hour each evening.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Nicolo	The Major said: “It must have been awful.” [MASK] said: “After he was hit for the first time, he screamed louder and louder, but the pain must have done something to him, because he screamed religious things.
<name>Wolfe</name>	Wolfe	Ham	The thing that makes me mad is this English bastard thinking he owns us.” The Colonel named [MASK], who was expert at saying Yes to his superiors and No to his inferiors, said: “Yeah, I see what you mean.”
<name>the boys</name>	the boys	Adano	“Then maybe our fines will be high this week,” the Major said. He thought he was joking, but he had become almost miserly on behalf of [MASK], and each Monday afternoon he used to try to see how much he could net in fines.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Zito	The Major said: “Oh, so the usher has ways of finding out what is on the officials’ minds?” [MASK] just smiled. There were quite a few people standing around watching the Engineers working on the bell.
<name>Lord Darlington</name>	Lord Darlington	Craxi	Once the important people make us kiss their hands, and later when the actual kissing became too much of a bother, it became the habit merely to mention the kissing, as if it had been done.” [MASK] said: “I meant no offense.
<name>Paul Revere</name>	Paul Revere	Fatta	[MASK] passed the word along. The crowd literally seemed to shudder. Some asked each other: “What shall we do?” Others said: “The harbor is the target. We are right in the middle of the target.”
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Algiers	I put it in the courier pouch for [MASK]. You know how much stuff we’ve been losing on that run. I thought maybe — ” The Technical Sergeant, relieved of his worry, smiled and said: “It might get lost accidentally on purpose?”
<name>the sergeant</name>	the sergeant	Basile	He reached for the field telephone, cranked the handle and said: “Give me Rowboat Blue Forward.” While he waited for an answer, the Major said to [MASK] gruffly: “Sit down. “Hello. This Rowboat Blue Forward?
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Polack	You know damn well this wine gives you the G.I. trots every time you drink it. You wouldn’t want to send the Major out of this town having to go to the latrine every ten minutes, would you?” [MASK] said: “Tha’s right.
<name>an Italian</name>	an Italian	Zito	It did not suit his office to chase [MASK] himself, especially since it was unlikely that he would catch him. The acolyte Ludovico, sitting on the steps of the Church, looked up in amazement at the little Italian being chased by the American officer.
<name>ADANO</name>	ADANO	ADANO	He knew what to say A BELL FOR [MASK] when his Captain started lecturing on discipline. “Well, I got my orders,” the Captain said. “I got to go out and take the guards off the road by the bridge and the sulphur works.
<name>Caramelle</name>	Caramelle	Borth	They shouted: ‘Caramelle! Caramelle!’ They were hungry. They wanted candy. I myself, who had had enough to eat as it happens, shouted for cigarets, not for the pealing of a bell.” [MASK] and the usher Zito came back.
<name>The Sergeant</name>	The Sergeant	Gargano	But the Major jumped to his feet and said sharply: “Silence, shrew,” and she fell quiet at once. “What is this all about?” the Major asked. [MASK] said: “This woman questioned my authority,” and he pointed at her with both forefingers.
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Trapani	“That’s the report on the mule cart situation, sir,” [MASK] said coolly. “You told me to make out a report, remember?” “You’re damn right I remember, and where did I tell you to send it?”
<name>Luigi</name>	Luigi	Tomasino	"Why not? Did you say something about my wanting to go out with his daughter?” “Oh no, a boss. Old a man [MASK] say he never been in a Palazzo di Citta in a life. He hate a Fascist a crooks.
<name>Beatty</name>	Beatty	Giorgio	They had lit a fire, which was against all rules, and [MASK] stood beside it where they could see him and shouted at them. These men had only been in one battle, but they were crazy with fear, and also with the wine.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Joppolo	“Well, [MASK], sounds to me as if you were doing a wizard job here. Keep it up. If you have any troubles, just give me a buzz.” And His Lordship left, on the verge of a delicious sneeze which he had been saving in his nostrils for ten minutes.
<name>Captain Young</name>	Captain Young	Tomasino	I mean the Captain of the Navy who runs this port. He is a young man and very fond of authority. And [MASK], we have to get permission from him before you and the others can go out fishing.” “Who is this young man of authority?”
<name>Colonel</name>	Colonel	Gargano	That was long after she had stopped laughing.” The cartman turned then away from the fuming [MASK] to the Major. After a pause he said: “I ate a watermelon the other day. It was the first fresh fruit I had eaten since the disembarkation.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Joppolo	“Well, I got my orders,” the Captain said. “I got to go out and take the guards off the road by the bridge and the sulphur works. But listen, I’m not going to bum for this guy [MASK].
<name>Moses</name>	Moses	Afronti	Now the proclamation speaks of being clean with water. There is much sameness which has accumulated on the streets since the time of those men of whom [MASK] speaks. This being clean takes much water. My cart is on the other side of the bridge.
<name>The American</name>	The American	D’Arpa	[MASK] said again: “But the big things, what about the big things?” The painter said: “You will not see the big things until you nave seen the portrait for some time, just as you did not recognize them in the man until you got to know him.
<name>Pedro</name>	Pedro	Giuseppe	[MASK] took me to his house because he’s got a couple of nice quail, he gave me some red stuff.” The Corporal said: “That vino s murder, Captain, it’ll give you the G.I. trots every time.”
<name>The Major</name>	The Major	Giuseppe	“Just a bunch a busybody,” [MASK] said. The Major turned around. “Go home, you people,” he said in Italian. “Don’t you have anything better to do at three in the afternoon?”
<name>John</name>	John	Zingone	[MASK], who was not winded at all, explained to her: “We were attacked as we worked in the harbor. Some of the men could smell it. It smelled like sulphur smoke. I think it may have been sulphur smoke.”
<name>Major Joppolo</name>	Major Joppolo	Borth	You will be sorry. When you are beaten, you will be sorry.” [MASK] said: “I think you really believe that the crooks A BELL FOR ADANO of the world can win this war. You’d better think that one over a little.
<name>Queequeg</name>	Queequeg	Tomasino	“Who is this young man of authority?” [MASK] said with a sullen face. “I will bash his head in with my gaffing hook.” And the fisherman’s face looked as if he meant it. “Let’s go and talk with him.”
<name>She</name>	She	Tina	He reminded himself that he had done a little talking the first evening about his wife, and [MASK] hadn’t flown off the way he did. But he couldn’t bring himself to apologize to her, and for several days and nights he did not see her.
<name>spies</name>	spies	Italians	Didn’t I tell you I didn’t want to see any more [MASK]?” “Yes, sir. But this one seems to be above the average. He was sent to you by one of our people. He says he has some information you would want.”
<name>Guido</name>	Guido	Giuseppe	“Now?” they said. “You are crazy, interpreter. Speaking two languages has made you crazy.” [MASK] shouted to the Major: “I’m a can’t a do nothing, a boss.”
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Lojacono	She started crying again. Chapter 32 In [MASK]’s studio — if a single room with small windows could be called a painters studio — a delegation of town officials stood around and criticized as the white-haired artist tried to work. The old man stood before two easels.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Borth	“You’re worse than the first day we came here,” the Sergeant said. “How am I worse?” the Major said. “You’re so damn sentimental.” “Oh, cut it out, [MASK].”
<name>the saboteur</name>	the saboteur	Errante	He whispered to someone in the crowd to run up to the Palazzo and get a force of about six carabinieri. Then he engaged [MASK] in argument until the reinforcements should arrive. “Saboteur!” he shouted, pounding one fist on the other.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Errante	[MASK] paused again. His mind had to reach out for each memory. “I do not like the place where I live. I have to brush the goat droppings aside each night before I lie down. It is crowded living with four goats in my room.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Polack	They were pretty drunk now. They staggered out of their room and along a long corridor until they came to a drawing room. [MASK] said: “Lookit that room, like a goddam Gran’ Central Station. There’s a lot of Eyetalian junk in there.”
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Nasta	“Cut the kidding,” the Major said, and that echo was in his voice. He changed the subject quickly. “When are you going to arrest [MASK]?” “In the morning, when he comes in for his daily worship.”
<name>the Major</name>	the Major	Erba	This was a quality in the Major that came out time and again: he was always gentle with those who evoked impatience, and he was always impatient with those who begged for gentleness. “The thirst,” said one of [MASK]’s friends, “the great thirst.”
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Purvis	The Lieutenant did not look particularly pleased with this summary of the Major’s activities. “Hello, this the M.P.’s? [MASK]? Listen, I want you to come down here. I got a mob to break up. Bring your Colt along.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Giuseppe	You can have a some fun.” “How? What can you fix, [MASK]?” “Fix a party.” “There you go with a crowd again. Hell no, let’s have a little privacy.” “How about a Major?”
<name>Unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Fatta	The stranger said: “They have spies.

<name>Garibaldi</name>	Garibaldi	Giuseppe	The Major turned around. “Go home, you people,” he said in Italian. “Don’t you have anything better to do at three in the afternoon?” But the people kept right on following [MASK] and the Major.
<name>Um Kalthoum</name>	Um Kalthoum	Carmelina	The three of them drank it together quite often. They used to buy it from [MASK] the wife of the lazy Fatta for a dollar a bottle. One night they bought three bottles for three dollars, and then they went to their billets to drink it.
<name>The man</name>	The man	Errante	[MASK] said: “I still do not understand why they shot my mule. I was asleep on the cart. Perhaps it was because I had had too much to drink. But that is a fault common among cartmen, and I have not heard of any other mules being shot.
<name>Mr. Baines</name>	Mr. Baines	Red	The officer addressed as [MASK] said: “I didn’t listen very carefully, it was something about going to the assistance of an Italian ship that was being attacked by a U-boat.” “And was probably running away from it!” the communications officer added.
<name>Kurtz</name>	Kurtz	Ham	e Colonel named [MASK] said: “I doubt if they will.” "I know they won’t. And look at the way they’re trying to run the war. They got their officers in all the key spots.
<name>Uncle Karl</name>	Uncle Karl	Gargano	It was the son of an official, the clean little Saitta boy, who allowed himself to be persuaded first. He said to the children nearest him: “I am going. [MASK] is a friend of my father. He will give us caramels without any work.”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Tina	He touched her all the time, with a hand on her shoulder or the back of a hand against her bare arm, just to let her know that someone was there. Finally the Major took [MASK] home. A little before twelve he went back to get her.
