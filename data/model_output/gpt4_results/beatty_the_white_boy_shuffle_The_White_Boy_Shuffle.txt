<name>Epstein's</name>	Epstein's	Dexters	“That’s not a bad poem. But I don’t feel responsible for anything anyone else does. I have enough trouble being responsible for myself. Besides, it looks like [MASK] death prevented one hundred million dollars from being deposited in the National Party’s coffers.”
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Dexter	[MASK] wore a red dashiki trimmed with miniature elephant tusks and tightly gripped the sides of the lectern with both hands. Rallymaster, they called him: able to form a coalition at a moment’s notice, knows the copy center with the cheapest rates, media friendly, dynamic speaker.
<name>Tito</name>	Tito	Gunnar	When kids discussed the team’s prospects in the city playoffs, washing down mouthfuls of doughy burritos with fruit punch, it was “[MASK] has held every all-city ballplayer we’ve played to fewer than four points.
<name>Yoshiko</name>	Yoshiko	Yoshiko	Step up, cuz, and be a man.” I ripped off the price tag and boldly approached [MASK]. There were no jitters. My hands didn’t shake. My underarms were TV-commercial dry. Sometimes the inevitable just seems right. “Kon’ban wa.
<name>Raphael</name>	Raphael	Gunnar	More to the point, what the hell is a street poet?” “[MASK], the urban piquancy of your work is so resonant, so resplendent, so resounding . . . you make the destitution of your environs leap off the page. You’re my inspiration.”
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Eileen	Usually [MASK] crossed the finish line first, wading into a welcoming committee of high fives and hugs from the girls. The boys wreathed me with humiliation. “Dude, why did you let her win? I lost four grape Pixie Stix.
<name>Zero</name>	Zero	Nicholas	I couldn’t hear the recitation very well because [MASK] was hugging me so tight my vertebrae popped like a string of firecrackers. When he released me, his wet cheek stuck to my face. “I’m proud of you, nigger.”
<name>Jerome</name>	Jerome	Zane	It’s hard to talk to [MASK] because his speech consists entirely of rhetorical filler. He responds to everything with “Word up, know what I'm sayin’, on the strength,” like he’s having the deepest conversations in the history of speech.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Joe	Periodically, my persecutors would rest and step back from my bloodied carcass, share bites of the apple, and admire their handiwork. ‘To, [MASK], how do you get both eyes to swell with such symmetry and purple robustness?”
<name>Coach</name>	Coach	Coach	I could feel your eyes on me wherever I went. Did I tell you how mad [MASK] got when you came to sit next to me on the bench? He thinks it sets a bad example for his best player to hold hands with his wife during the game.
<name>LeBron</name>	LeBron	Scoby	Despite playing well and enjoying [MASK]’s company on the court, I became depressed with my purposeless life; sad-eyed. I’d toe the free-throw fine in an arena filled with screaming maniacs, pondering the worthlessness of my existence. “Two shots, gentlemen.
<name>Rocco</name>	Rocco	Pang	Ping. Ping. “No.” Ding. Ping. Ping. [MASK]. A hook and two jabs followed by a stiff right uppercut put a small dent in the post, and sparks flew off the aluminum. I could smell the tangy scent of charred metal.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Yoshiko	You know, this is my favorite cereal bowl.” [MASK] reached between her legs and condescendingly patted my forehead. The placenta dropped into the bowl, a quivering bloody mass of now useless organ. Someone in the crowd asked when we were going to do this again.
<name>He</name>	He	Reece	He wiped his eyes and stopped blubbering for a bit. “You guys going in?” “I guess so,” we answered. “Well, you better hurry up. I think most of the good stuff is gone.” [MASK] was right.
<name>Junot</name>	Junot	Fools	‘You better buy this book. Compralo, ese. My boy wrote this, so next time I see you, best to have it on you.’ [MASK] bought your shit too, because I was your number-one publicist in the ’hood.
<name>Ramon</name>	Ramon	Scoby	Played live, played at seventy-eight rpms, thirty-three and a third, backwards, looped, whatever. There’s no need for translation. You understand or you don’t.” [MASK] gave me a shake and a hug and left the beach, leaving his cassette player on my towel.
<name>Sal</name>	Sal	Gunnar	“I feel like I’m dry heaving while free-falling from fifteen thousand feet.” “That’s it, man, you getting it. Feel, [MASK], feel. Let the jazz seep into your pores.” People began spilling from their homes.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Yoshiko	The muffled roar of die waves rolling overhead was comforting, and I popped my thumb in my mouth, pretending I was an embryo suspended in amniotic fluid. I began to hear [MASK] in the shower, talking to our child as she scrubbed her stomach.
<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Yoshiko	Gathering what I came for, I poured myself a blueberry slushie, left a five-dollar bill on the counter, and walked back to the motel. [MASK] asked why her slushie was so warm and I told her about being followed by the police helicopter.
<name>Delilah</name>	Delilah	Honey	Sensing he was losing me, he called to his wife. “[MASK], come and meet this fine young man I was telling you about.” A white woman in a see-through chiffon gown sashayed into the dining room like a fashion model.
<name>Athena</name>	Athena	Urania	a.p.b. 911 electronic prayers to the goddess [MASK]’s voicemail go unanswered late last night my man picked up a jailhouse phone “Yo, nigger, you got to come down and get me out.” and i was inspired
<name>Ignatius</name>	Ignatius	Scoby’d	Wringing their hands like mad scientists, he and [MASK] thank me for my kindness, ignoring the fact that I suffered from what the American Psychiatric Association Manual of Mental Disorders lists as social arrhythmia and courtship paralysis, meaning I couldn’t dance and was deathly afraid of women.
<name>Ambrosia</name>	Ambrosia	Gunnar	At the top of the sheet was the Ambrosia motto, “The happy slave has a right to be a slave, but is still a slave nonetheless.” I could hear my mother on the phone: “Join, [MASK], sounds like an intelligent bunch of young people.”
<name>Jeremy</name>	Jeremy	Scoby	“They sit in the stands and scream like everybody else whenever I shoot the basketball.” When the lunch bell rang, [MASK] was feeling better. He smiled as if he had had a revelation and told Coach he’d be at practice.
<name>Haruki</name>	Haruki	Gunnar	“He would kneel at the end of the Freedom Trail and stick a sword in his belly.” “Exactly. [MASK]?” “Yeah.” “You serious about this whole death trip, winning by straight taking yourself out?” “I guess so.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Scoby	I walked off the stage into a stunned auditorium of dazed crash dummies adrift in post-car-accident silence. At the top of my voice I yelled, “Is everyone all right? Anyone hurt?” On the ride home [MASK] saved me a seat in the back of the bus.
<name>Stevie</name>	Stevie	Scoby	I can’t even try. Something won’t let me.” [MASK]’s eyes reddened and he started to sniffle. He was cracking under the pressure. Watching his hands shake, I realized that sometimes die worst thing a nigger can do is perform well.
<name>Earl</name>	Earl	Cleotis	It was Ham Hock Night, so when he finally touched down the fans threw fatty pieces of pork and bottles of hot sauce onto the floor in appreciation. The reason [MASK] is playing in obscurity is because he cannot shoot. He has absolutely no touch.
<name>Willie</name>	Willie	Wolfgang	Having nothing to lose, the white boys followed [MASK] to the Chicago Circle Cab Company, where a group of cabbies on their lunch breaks sat inside the dispatch booth talking about each other’s shortcomings and women and telling hilarious, if only slightiy exaggerated, stories of black life in a big city.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Nicholas	Now I can do what the fuck I want and blame it on the puppet-master. Watakushi wa nodo ga kawakimashita. Biru o ni hon maraimasho. [MASK] sees the strings, but he spends all his time looking for a pair of scissors.
<name>Ramon</name>	Ramon	Scoby	Are you modierfuckers crazy?” “Chill, homes. We just want help lifting this thing into the van.” “How did you get it out?” “Look,” [MASK] said, pointing to a set of rubber wheels attached to the bottom of the strongbox.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Scoby	Nothing happened. “Fucking goddamn box.” [MASK] was calculating possible permutations of a combination lock numbered from zero to one hundred. He’d already tried thirty-two-thousand different combinations while I was in the hospital.
<name>Camus</name>	Camus	Schopenhauer	What’s wrong — having a poetic moment?” “I don’t know. Been reading [MASK] and I can’t figure out my raison d’etre.” ‘Tour purpose in life is to make these free throws, then run back and play defense.”
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Coach	On the way home I was wondering what [MASK] meant by “soon-to-be revolutionaries” when I noticed a distant column of black smoke billowing into the dusk like a tornado too tired to move. “What’s that?”
<name>Yuriko</name>	Yuriko	Stanley	The final choice was between me and an Iowa grad student named [MASK]. On the day she’d been suspended from school for maiming the kendo teacher, she was in detention passing the time reading an alternative Japanese magazine called Phlegm when she came across one of my poems.
<name>Cheryl</name>	Cheryl	Nick	“Not much. No black radio. No black clubs. No black political power base. No drive-thru fast food.” “So why would I want to go there?” I asked, trying to emphasize to [MASK] that this was my interview.
<name>Miranda</name>	Miranda	Yoshiko	After a few hours it was time; [MASK] clambered onto the cushy mountain and squatted on the ridge of beanbags. My job was to massage her feet, feed her salted soybeans, and wipe her down with cold sponges.
<name>Manchild</name>	Manchild	Nick	“[MASK], I ain’t no ballplayer.” “I know you ain’t. I seen you looking at those sonnets, drool dripping out your mouth. You either a poet or a homosexual.” “Oh shit, that’s fucked up.
<name>Allen</name>	Allen	Yoshiko	I was protected by poetic immunity. I had permission to act crazy. I pulled off an officer’s hat and mussed his hair, then skipped up the stairs to my apartment and plopped face down on the couch, my head on [MASK]’s lap.
<name>LeBron</name>	LeBron	Scoby	“I am perfection; everything else is bullshit. Your life is meaningless.” So the philosophers show up at the games, full of anticipatory schadenfreude, armed with computer printouts calculating the odds of [MASK]’s missing his next shot.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Scoby	[MASK] turned up the volume on the tape deck just a bit. Another car flew through a stop sign, then reversed its direction. When the car drew parallel to us, the driver flashed a gap-toothed smile, then shot a raised fist out the window and raced away.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Eileen	We splashed in the postcard blue of the ocean and stuck out our Slurpee blue tongues at the girls two towels over. [MASK]’s light-saber blue eyes cut through me like lighthouse beacons lancing the midnight. Psychedelic When you’re young, psychedelic is a primary color and a most mesmerizing high.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Black	[MASK] was my father on a weekend custody drunken binge, pushing me around as if I were a twelve-year-old, seventy-five-pound bell clapper clanging hard against the door, the wall, the shoe tree.
<name>Tyrone</name>	Tyrone	Gunnar	“[MASK]? Who’s that?” “You know, the funny, cool black guy.” Some kids had reps for shredding on skateboards or eating ear wax. My forte was the ability to hold a straight face and pull off the nervy prank.
<name>Maya</name>	Maya	Christina	My mother asked what was wrong, and between breathless wails [MASK] replied that on the way home from the Museum of Natural History the campers had cheered, “Yeah, white camp! Yeah, white camp!” and she had felt left out.
<name>Reggie</name>	Reggie	Scoby	“[MASK], your boy’s got like crazy hops.” “Ain’t no seventh-grade bailers in the city dunking.” “This nigger has high-flying kung fu triple-feature you-lalled-my-teacher-you-dirty-bastard rise.”
<name>John</name>	John	Nicholas	The fest opened with an hour of silence followed by a parade of local residents declaring their undying love for [MASK], most of the tearful reminiscences starting with “I remember when that nigger wasn’t but about yea big . . .”
<name>Reggie</name>	Reggie	Scoby	“What kind of black man would let his wife give birth in the park?” “You know, I think she’s doing it as a way of replacing [MASK]. Giving something back to the community.”
<name>Rodney</name>	Rodney	Scoby	Why are all safes painted beige, and would my mother come visit me in prison? “Dude, I can’t be wearing no stone-washed prison outfit for the rest of my life. That shit makes me itch.” [MASK] tried to comfort me.
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Nicholas	They were oblivious to the flying aluminum walkers and whisky bottles that zipped past their intertwined bodies, and flashes of sweet pink tongue victory darted from their lips. [MASK] and I returned to our studies. “Yo, is that mauve-suited kumquat your father?”
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Grimy	[MASK], covered with sweat, the boys were overjoyed to see us. So this was “the heist.” ‘What the fuck? Are you modierfuckers crazy?” “Chill, homes. We just want help lifting this thing into the van.”
<name>Julie</name>	Julie	Yoshiko	“Tell Mother I love . . . uhh.” While I went to get the blankets and the radio from the trunk, [MASK] sprinted down the bluff, tossing her clothes to the sand and motioning for me to join her.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Scoby	What Did You Say? was a car accessory emporium that specialized in deafeningly loud car stereos and equally loud seat covers. I couldn’t figure out how [MASK] planned to get in the place. What Did You Say? was known to be impenetrable.
<name>Mei</name>	Mei	Yoshiko	,” but I didn’t know any Chinese sayings, old or new. My hesitancy grew embarrassing. [MASK] waddled over and ran my hand over the circumference of her bloated belly. I rubbed and smiled but still said nothing.
<name>Adolf</name>	Adolf	Himmler	We concerned ourselves with whether it would be more fun to fantasize about world domination attired in crushed Gestapo black velvet with red trim or in crumpled green Third Army gum-chewing schleppiness. [MASK] is wearing the Aryan autocrat’s summer ensemble, designed for maximum military foreboding with a hint of patrician civility.
<name>Yumiko</name>	Yumiko	Yoshiko	[MASK] threw her macro book at the interloper, hitting her squarely in the jaw. “Get your slothful, fey, hippy behinds out of our apartment, now!” The class hustled out of the room, a stream of Japanese curse words escorting them to the door.
<name>Momma</name>	Momma	Veronica	“Mmmmmm, tap-tap on the fine nigger sittin’ on top of the washing machine.” [MASK] cradled my limp body in her arms and placed me gently on the floor. The dryer gave off a strange half-buzzing, half-ringing sound and continued to rumble.
<name>Hounds</name>	Hounds	Dogs	They bring the hounds round to the other side and pick you up soon enough. You had to get to a chicken coop and rub handfuls of chicken shit on your shoes real thick-like. [MASK] would get tired of smellin’ that shit
<name>Falstaff</name>	Falstaff	Nigger	A knave, a rascal, an eater of broken meats; a base, proud, shallow, three-suited, hundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking whoreson . . . one-trunk-inheriting slave . . . beggar. [MASK] ...
<name>we</name>	we	Kaufmans	Maybe you still sleep in it to keep warm at night?” What’re a few nigger jokes among friends? We [MASK] have always been the type of niggers who can take a joke. I used to visit my father, the sketch artist at the Wilshire LAPD precinct.
<name>Himmel</name>	Himmel	Himmel	“Gott im [MASK].” Will the passenger in boat 37 please remain seated! After a day filled with centrifugal spins and free-falls, it was hard to tell whether I was dizzy with love or with motion sickness.
<name>Mouse</name>	Mouse	Scoby	Unraveled cassette tape hung from the overhead pipes like brown riot tinsel. Even the ceiling fans and service phones were gone. “What happens to a dream deferred?” I said in my best classical recitation voice. [MASK] cursed and threw a nine-volt battery at my head.
<name>Elwood</name>	Elwood	Dexter	I wanted to dislike [MASK] — it was obvious he was a charlatan — but I was awestruck at how such an ugly motherfucker, with an eczema condition so severe that when he furrowed his brow tiny flakes of skin fell to the lectern, could hold an audience spellbound with a single gesture.
<name>Seamus</name>	Seamus	Nick	“And what exactly does ‘stay black’ mean, [MASK]?” “It means be yourself, what else could it possibly mean?” The arrogance of the white lads was enervating and I soon tired of their unspoken noblesse oblige, the subtle one-upsmanship.
<name>John</name>	John	Nicholas	There was some unspoken protocol at work, and [MASK] apparently had diplomatic status. Soon a huge crowd gathered around die sidelines. Right from the start there was an intensity on the court that hadn’t been present in the previous game.
<name>Sheldon</name>	Sheldon	Christina	Then [MASK], middle child, whom I lovingly rechristened with the Native American appellation Fingers-in-Both-Nostrils-Thumb-in-Mouth-and-Snot-All-Over-the-Fucking-Place, would pull on the heartstrings to tighten the filial ties.
<name>Shine</name>	Shine	Bubbles	You want me to change my name to [MASK] and start singing them ‘Call me Shine’ songs? No one would have to shoot me, I’d die of shame.” “Geez, you’re sensitive. What topics of importance are these hoodlums singing about, anyway?”
<name>Jerome</name>	Jerome	Scoby	Burritos to 150-proof rum mixed with corrosive black hair products. When we got to What Did You Say?, the steel door was still in place. [MASK] and I put our ears against the door and heard what sounded like mice scurrying around inside.
<name>O.J.</name>	O.J.	Nate	I heard they got more money from the Hollywood wardrobe agency they sold his clothes to than from the ransom [MASK] paid for his wife. The ex-football player scored points by passing around pictures of himself arm in arm on Caribbean beaches with bikini-clad white women.
<name>Pinocchio</name>	Pinocchio	Frankenstein	In a world where body and spoken language were currency, I was broke as hell. Corporeally mute, I couldn’t saunter or bojangle my limbs with rubbery nonchalance. I stiffly parade-marched around town with an embalmed soul, a rheumatic heart, and [MASK]’s autonomic nervous system.
<name>Cholly</name>	Cholly	Gunnar	“[MASK], you come back here and be a father to your child, you sonofabitch. My mother warned me. She said, ‘If you marry a Negro hoodlum, he’ll impregnate you and leave you for a white girl.’
<name>Dean</name>	Dean	Scoby	Another stranded teamster in a beer truck crashed into a barrier and broadsided the Wonder Bread man, sending both vehicles sprawling on their sides. The Wonder Bread track slid to a stop ten feet in front of [MASK] and me like a huge shuffleboard disk, its engine sputtering and wheels spinning.
<name>Drudge</name>	Drudge	Melissa	rainy, dreary day.” I’d try to fall asleep, but it was too hot even to daydream. My sweat-soaked Suicidal Tendencies You Can’t Bring Me Down tour shirt clung to the inversion layer of grit on my skin. [MASK] droned on.
<name>Winter</name>	Winter	Yoshiko	Once upon a time there was this shepherd boy who always screaming wolf like a little bitch . . .’” “Oh shit, you got to stop hanging out with them Onyx niggers.” I put my head back on the pillow. “[MASK], you pregnant?”
<name>Miles</name>	Miles	Parker	It’d be a different tune but the same tune. You dig? You’d be hearing it differendy and its meaning would change. Because a musician has they own sense of time and experience of time. For [MASK], time was a bitch.
<name>She</name>	She	Allison	Brave warriors, they left with no send-off party save the frightened faces of their classmates. Ten minutes later [MASK] returned unharmed. She skipped over to her desk, sat down, and covered a sly I-know-some-thing-you-don’t smile with her hand.
<name>Thaddeus</name>	Thaddeus	Euripides	Mugs in hand, they surrounded the nervous guard and peppered him with insults. [MASK] stood about a yard away from the redcoat, looked him up and down, turned to his mates, and said, “Verily, that’s the tea-and-crumpet-eating-scofflaw.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Kaufman	“Two shots, gentlemen. Relax on the first.” The referee would hand me the ball with a stern look, trying to talk with the whistle in his mouth. “[MASK], you look glum. What’s wrong — having a poetic moment?”
<name>Jennifer</name>	Jennifer	Melissa	She said dark colors soak up the sun’s rays through processes called conduction and convection and the lighter colors of the spectrum tend to alter the path of the radiation through reflection and refraction.” “Good, I thought you weren’t paying attention. [MASK], please continue.”
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Scoby	I picked up [MASK]’s latest masterpiece, a still soggy, pockmarked, nondescript lump of clay, and turned it over tenderly in my hands. “Nice work. This really captivates the frustrations of the underclass in an abstract yet immediate way.
<name>Easy</name>	Easy	Kaufman	“Shoot this shit, [MASK].” I didn’t hesitate. Grabbing the gun in two hands, I squeezed off a three-shot sound poem that slapped a complacent hot southern California night to attention. “Aim, nigger.” “I am.”
<name>Delaney</name>	Delaney	Nigger	You write about blowing up the White House and they tap your phone, but only when you buy some dynamite will they tap you on the shoulder and say, “Come with me.” “[MASK], you ain’t never said nothing about no book.”
<name>Raymond</name>	Raymond	Yoshiko	“What this shit about your life going to change?” “He’s going to publish a book of poems.” “I can speak for myself, [MASK]. She’s right, I’m going to publish a book of poems.”
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	Scoby	[MASK] and I looked each other in the eye for about a nanosecond, then stormed out of the house. Running down the streets, we argued over the merits of an IBM-compatible versus an Apple. “Dude, I’m looking for a Wizard Protean.”
<name>Godot</name>	Godot	Godot	We sat at the bus stop, chewing off the ears of shortbread circus animals and enacting an urban version of Waiting for [MASK]. “You’re sure you don’t mind the pumpkin seeds?” “That depends. Do you want to grow carrots?”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Gunnar	“Glad to meet you, [MASK].” She grabbed my hand and kissed me lightly on the knuckles, then locked her hazel eyes on my crotch. “You’re bigger, I mean different from the other boys. No tie, no tweed jacket.
<name>Xiaoyu</name>	Xiaoyu	Yoshiko	Somewhere near the backwash end of the bottle, I’d guessed that [MASK] was a rebellious teen whose parents couldn’t afford the cost of an American university, so she decided that marrying an eligible bachelor would be the easiest way to get a free education.
<name>Ray</name>	Ray	Yoshiko	Soon the guests demanded that the couple belatedly exchange their vows. I stood and raised my beer can in [MASK]’s direction, placed my hand over my heart, and said, “Till death do us part.” “That’s it, nigger?”
<name>Tralala</name>	Tralala	Nigger	That don’t count. [MASK], have you ever seen any parts of the pussy?” “Of course, man. I’ve fucked . . . er, been fucked . . . um, been fucking ... I is fucking.”
<name>Leon</name>	Leon	Gunnar	I bet the Harvard kids didn’t even know so many niggers existed. It was good to see you in the stands, and hearing you scream, “Take the motherfucker to the hole, [MASK]!” I could feel your eyes on me wherever I went.
<name>Tupac</name>	Tupac	Rimbaud	“It was in his footsteps that I spent this past summer selling guns to downtrodden ghetto youth to defend themselves against the oppressive system.” This time I lifted my head off the desk to interrupt. “Come on, [MASK] wasn’t no gun-running revolutionary.
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	Scoby	“I don’t care what happens, I will never put a fucking crease in my Levi’s. No fucking way, man. I will never be that involved.” [MASK] laughed and asked if my mother had given me enough money for basketball shoes.
<name>Biggie's</name>	Biggie's	Scobys	• Build huge video screens throughout the neighborhood. • Use only colored camerapersons and support staff. • All broadcasts must be live and unedited. • Stay the fuck out of the way. The next scheduled broadcast was on the two-year anniversary of [MASK] death.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Gunnar	“[MASK], do you have any dreams?” “Nope, but listening to you carry on, I’m working on one now. I once heard about some shit called a Flachenblitz.” “Yeah?” “It’s lightning in reverse.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Gunnar	That hold on your emotions will take you far, wait and see, [MASK].” When he freed me from a playful headlock, I wanted to shout, “But Coach, I really don’t give a fuck.” But why spoil his joy?
<name>Boudreaux</name>	Boudreaux	Yeehaw	After a few miles of horn-blaring, bumper-to-bumper tailgating and beer cans sounding off the windows like tin hailstones, [MASK]’s phony finest the white boy shuffle 21 grew bored and forced my father’s car to a stop.
<name>Kafka</name>	Kafka	Chikamatsu	I’m beginning to see the sheer casual genius of [MASK] writing for the puppet theater. If I blur my eyes I can see the black strings attached to my joints and stretching to the sides. Ah, the freedom of fatalism.
<name>Zlata</name>	Zlata	Yoshiko	Hearing a familiar name, [MASK] nudged my mother in the ribs, put a bewildered look on her face, and started scratching the back of her head and her underarms, impersonating the famous actor. “That’s exactly who I’m talking about.
<name>Wolff</name>	Wolff	Kaufman	I was a skinny six-foot-four-inch pawn in the chess game unfolding inside his head. “[MASK], where are you supposed to be?” Looking into his small hamster-brown eyes, which through his thick Buddy Holly glasses looked absolutely minuscule.
<name>Mouse</name>	Mouse	Scoby	It was [MASK], not bothering to knock, standing in the middle of the living room oblivious to the other uninvited guests and talking loudly to make himself heard over his stereo headphones. “What this shit about your life going to change?”
