<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Marjorie	He stepped out of the door and fell head first down the stairs of the bungalow, with tremendous thumping and banging. When [MASK] came to the door in alarm, he was on his hands and knees, brushing dead leaves and dirt off himself. “No harm done.
<name>Doctor</name>	Doctor	Marjorie	I hope so. It’s a little sudden, but that’s all right, too.” “Kill or cure, [MASK]. Clean break. It’s the only way.” “I’m sure you know all about how to do these things.”
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Marjorie	[MASK] said after a silence, “She’s not just your landlady, I gather.” He glanced at her and laughed, one comer of his mouth pulled down. “I’ve never kidded you, have I? That’s why I wish to God
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Marjorie	“The staff has another name for her. Not fit for your innocent little ears.” She went up the steps, pushed open the redwood door, and beckoned to [MASK]. “What’s the matter with you? Come on.”
<name>darling</name>	darling	Marge	“Ye gods, the folks already. D’you know we’ve been jawing for hours?” She rolled off the bed as the hell rang again. “Coming, coming!—Damn them, they forget the key five nights out of six. Come on and meet them, [MASK].”
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Marjorie	A hush had fallen in the apartment; as she walked toward the foyer, [MASK]’s heels ticked on the parquet floor. She was rounding the bend in the hallway when she heard a queer noise from the living room, starting low and sliding up eerily, like the wail of an epileptic.
<name>Mr. Bell</name>	Mr. Bell	Marjorie	It was still whining when the street door opened and a short man with white hair came in and stood yawning beside her, holding a large brown paper bag in both arms. [MASK] smelled the spice of delicatessen, and took a second look at the tanned plump face of the man.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Margie	“And that’s the only kind that makes a good salesclerk.” “Well, I’m not beaten. I’m not going to work for my father yet. There must be some other answer—” “[MASK], how good a stenographer are you?”
<name>Dr. Shepherd</name>	Dr. Shepherd	Morris	It was current practice, he told her, in cases of fractures that wouldn’t heal, to put pieces of bone from another part of the patient’s own body into the breach. [MASK] was doing original work in clinic cases, using bone from other people’s bodies in the same way.
<name>he</name>	he	Marjorie	He met the look, his eyes expressionless, and said, “Like to take a chance on the dancing? You reel around and try to keep from crashing into pillars and other couples. It’s fun, in a wild way.” “I’d just as soon skip it,” [MASK] said.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Rothmore	“That’s what he’s really interested in, after all.” [MASK] said, “There’s no comparison, none at all, between where he could go as an executive and as a songwriter.” “But obviously he doesn’t care about being an executive.”
<name>expected</name>	expected	Quint	His look became very sad. “You can’t pay anything at all?” “Nothing.” “But—well, frankly, I knew I wouldn’t get as much as [MASK], but—I don’t know, can’t you even pay fifty dollars?”
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Drobes	A big grayheaded man in a tuxedo, with a handful of huge brown menus, opened the door under the gilt sign and blocked their way. “Sorry, restaurant all full.” “I have a reservation. [MASK] is the name.”
<name>Manolin</name>	Manolin	Noel	His body was slightly out of the water, for it was only a couple of feet deep, but his head was submerged. [MASK] seized him by the shoulders and dragged him into a sitting position in the water, his back against the rim.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Harry	When the song ended [MASK] bawled, “Three cheers for the Judge!” And the Family cheered, and gave him a round of applause. He bowed here and there with pleased dignity, his long face flushed, his gray fringe of hair a little disordered, a pulse throbbing in his neck.
<name>Mr. Mayer</name>	Mr. Mayer	Sam	I shouldn’t even have gone in the plane---” “You’re a hopeless prig. [MASK] knew I was taking you, and told me to bring you to the office. He wants to meet you. Satisfied?” She was awe-stricken by the Paramount offices.
<name>Chaplin</name>	Chaplin	Wally	[MASK]’s a bom gagman. If somebody else was to get the job, I’m glad he did. He’s a damned clever kid. He hasn’t the brains of an ant-eater so far as any thinking about abstractions or serious problems goes.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Noel	He was a terrific hit, and—” “Gosh, [MASK], I honestly think he’s done enough for one day, don’t you?” “Well, that’s why I wanted to ask you.” “Why? Is it so important?”
<name>pirate</name>	pirate	Englishman	The ship’s officer at the head of the gangplank held out a hand to stop her as she set foot on deck. “So sorry, miss. You’re too late.” The accent was like a movie [MASK]’s, the manner pleasant but firm.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Flamm	No telephone calls had gone through the switchboard. There was nothing on the desk but an ashtray containing two dead cigars and some ashes. On a shelf over [MASK]’s head was a row of play volumes which looked as though they had been undisturbed for some years.
<name>Norma</name>	Norma	Dora	If he likes a script it must have values-” “But did you like it?” “Well, frankly, it’s slightly confusing at a first reading, and of course I just raced through it.” “[MASK], isn’t it utter and hopeless garbage?”
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Marjorie	“It’s true, all right. I gave up teaching after my accident. I wasn’t much good at it afterward.” [MASK] took a less satiric tone. “You seem very strange to me. I’m not being especially stupid, am I?”
<name>Gilbert</name>	Gilbert	Wally	Like a flash she answered—and her voice sounded just as it did in the old days, full of life and sparkle, “Who isn’t dreaming, [MASK]? You?” The fireworks started around then, all green and golden and red, over the sound.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Noel	“Hey, have you drowned? I’m off.” The door opened and [MASK] looked out, unshaven and pale, dressed in moccasins, corduroy pants, and his old black turtle-neck sweater. He said, “What are you going to do about breakfast?
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Sam	It’s no picnic, either. [MASK] gets a day’s work out of you for his money, believe me. None of that brandy-and-chess charm in working hours. In fact he’s a pretty coarse bully. I don’t mind.
<name>Penicillin</name>	Penicillin	German	She swallowed the capsule and stared at him. “How long will it take?” “Just give the gelatin a chance to dissolve. That’s the quickest stuff there is. [MASK], I regret to say. We’ve got nothing to touch it.”
<name>her</name> (Note: There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to a female person previously mentioned in the conversation.)	her (Note: There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to a female person previously mentioned in the conversation.)	Marsha	‘We have loads of fun.” “You met her at the rehearsals, isn’t that right?” “Yes.” “I want to tell you a couple of things. I know [MASK] well. She’s all right in some ways.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Noel	It had been shorter than many telephone talks with her mother about having dinner at a friend’s home. “How did she take it?” [MASK] said. “Sounded all right at this end.” “You don’t have to worry about my mother.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Marjorie	He sounded about ten. “Yeah? Hello?” I asked to speak to his mother. He dropped the phone and bawled, “Ma, some man for you.” Then she came on the telephone. “Hello?” “[MASK]?”
<name>Lorelai</name>	Lorelai	Marsha	[MASK]’s face had the old eager look, but she seemed to be much thinner. “Saw the commencement announced in the Times this morning, had to beg out of the corset department long enough to see la Morningstar graduate.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Marjorie	Workmen out on the lawn were hammering bright decorations on the little booths for dispensing tamales, enchiladas, and rum drinks, and over the noise of the hammers the loudspeakers merrily blared a cascading rumba. The coffee and the aspirins lifted and soothed [MASK]’s spirits.
<name>the paparazzi</name>	the paparazzi	Muriel	“Let’s duck, shall we, and see if we can avoid [MASK]?” The audience was still applauding as they slipped out through a side door. The sidewalks were wet and black, with fiery streaks reflected from the electric signs, but the rain had stopped.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Noel	Her mother’s astounding friendliness to [MASK] had given her hope that all was going to be well. She swished her skirt so flirtatiously, and cast such brilliant smiles at the circle of guests, that many of the men watched her to the neglect of the other dancers.
<name>Hemingway</name>	Hemingway	Noel	“Sh,” somebody said from the next table. After several encores [MASK] broke into English to thank them; then he announced the fiesta program. In the afternoon there would be folk dancing and singing on the lawn and after that the bullfight.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Eden	They went up on the boat deck, and she noted with relief that there were several weary-looking couples still in evening dress here and there on the ship. “It isn’t six yet,” [MASK] said. “Last night out anything goes.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Marjorie	“Justement, monsieur.” Her eyes a little more used to the gloom, [MASK] looked around at the disorderly empty chairs and tables. In the far corners were shadowy customers hunched over candles, three other couples in all.
<name>Mrs. Higgins</name>	Mrs. Higgins	Gertie	[MASK]’s put on twenty pounds from my cooking. Not that that’s been so good for her, she’s a Big Bertha to start with, but it does show that she’s been getting value for her two ratty rooms.
<name>Eugenia</name>	Eugenia	Noel	The last letter from [MASK] had come in November. As his silence stretched through January, she became exceedingly uneasy. They had been separated almost a year. Often she thought of borrowing from her parents. She had almost five hundred dollars, and another two hundred or so would send her on her way.
<name>John</name>	John	Noel	“There’s nobody left nowadays, is there?” “There’s the butler,” [MASK] said. “The inconspicuous little character who really did it.” “What’s his name, for heaven’s sake?” Chapter 30.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Marjorie	Good night. I wish we could stay.” [MASK] said, when she was gone, “I think your mother’s a darling. And your father’s charming, too. Why did you paint him to me as such an idiot?”
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Noel	“You’re a madman.” [MASK] scribbled a card while the florist prepared the violets. He handed the little purple nosegay and the card to her with a flourish: Violets in winter, Sweetness in ice— Not that you need, dear, This wily advice.
<name>distance</name>	distance	Chance	Time may change us, estrange us, [MASK] may turn true love to false— But years and worlds apart, We’ll still be heart to heart, Each time we hear the South Wind Waltz. There were approving murmurs, and a little applause.
<name>Wolfe</name>	Wolfe	Darling	“You’re quite right,” he said amiably. “With this chopped-up phiz of mine it’s ridiculous, but I never have liked fat people.” “[MASK]” (there it was again) “I didn’t mean that.
<name>Cherry</name>	Cherry	Wally	I think we ought to talk a little bit, maybe.” “You think I’m just a stupid kid, don’t you, with a crush on you, the way [MASK] has a crush on me. Well, what if it’s true?
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Marsha	They hesitated outside the door, shrinking from the rain, buttoning their coats. [MASK] said, “Me for the bus. You?” “Oh, it’s graduation day. I’ll take a cab.”
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Marjorie	The doctor looked at her, and the absorbed expression of a mechanic at his trade passed from his face. He was a staring fat young man. “[MASK], it’s very bad.” With a throb of astonishment, she said, “Is he dead?”
<name>He</name>	He	Marjorie	He stared at her, ripped the sheet out of the typewriter and rolled in another, frowning blackly. “What on earth’s the matter?” [MASK] said. “You surprise me a bit, that’s all.” His voice was very flat.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Marjorie	“Well, I don’t know, it’s one thing right after the other. Is there a connection or isn’t there?” [MASK], thoroughly exasperated at her mother’s clairvoyance, calculated that a lie would break down.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Marjorie	“I didn’t undertake to wet-nurse you through the evening, girl. Or believe me, I wouldn’t have asked you to come.” How ugly this fat girl was in her straining underwear, with her lip lifted in the strange mirthless grin, [MASK] thought.
<name>the groom</name>	the groom	Lou	“Okay. I won’t go to the rehearsal. Will you help me shop for my trousseau? I’m up to nightgowns on the check list. Help me pick out some real yummy things to please [MASK].” “Well—sure, I guess so.
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Look”—he	“I don’t even like you particularly.” “Oh, damn that bloody nonsense. [MASK] stood and walked toward her—“I trust you believe that when I asked you last Sunday to help with the fights I wasn’t subtly and fiendishly leading up to this.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Noel	like a thousand breaking piano wires—” “It isn’t, [MASK], don’t believe that—” “I won’t, don’t worry, not yet. But if it turns out that way—well, hell, I wouldn’t be surprised if the earth goes on turning.
<name>Lord Peter</name>	Lord Peter	Airman	‘We’re talking about popular songs.” “True,” said [MASK], with his peculiarly gracious and winning smile, “but we’re also talking about excellence. The most popular verse in English, so far as I know, is A man’s ambition must be small,
<name>Nora</name>	Nora	Nora	At least I know you. We’ve danced. Two whole dances.” “Oh?” “At the Ninety-second Street Y. The dance after the play. The night you played [MASK] in A Doll’s House.” She regarded him more carefully.
<name>marrying</name>	marrying	Marjorie	“All the same, with the old system she’d be meeting nothing but boys of exactly the right age and background, and no guesswork.” “With that system you wouldn’t have the problem of [MASK] at all,” said the mother sharply.
<name>Israel</name>	Israel	Marjorie	There’s an amazing number of them, [MASK], Jews by the tens of thousands, just sitting in that fiery furnace, waiting for it to cool off. It’s their home, you see. They won’t go. They can’t get themselves to leave home.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Noel	They attract you for a while with their energy and bounce, but they’re really bores.” “I hate such pigeonholing of people. It’s glib and it’s false.” “Well, I don’t know,” [MASK] said.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Greech	“That’s the last thing you’re supposed to say when you die. I don’t suppose he had a chance to say it.” She put the hand back, and covered the Uncle with the sheet. [MASK] was wiping his eyes.
<name>Mark Twain</name>	Mark Twain	Thurber	But the hell with it. I couldn’t be more out of the mood. Some other time. Let me read you something by [MASK] I came across last night, it’s side-splitting.” He read very well, and the piece was excruciatingly funny.
<name>her</name>	her	Marjorie	They steamed past the Empire State Building and it seemed to [MASK] that she was in the building watching the ship go by, instead of the other way around. Never in her life had she felt so totally dislocated, so outside reality.
<name>Holly</name>	Holly	Marjorie	[MASK] leaned her hot cheek against the window. “I love to look at it. I always did. The park road and the Broadway lights, the big hotels, they make such a wonderful show on a rainy night. I used to live in the El Dorado, you know.”
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Noel	She laughed at him. [MASK]’s second letter came when she had almost given up looking at the mail. There it was at last, the bright Mexican stamp poking through the usual trash of bills, charity requests, and circulars. It was another brisk typewritten travelogue.
<name>he</name>	he	Billy	She concentrated on trying to recall exactly what [MASK] had said about his brother, but she could dredge up few additional facts from her memory. He had talked about him only once, in a conversation on the sofa of the fraternity house, at the weary end of a Thanksgiving dance two years ago.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Noel	The judge rolled over her smoothly with a smile, “—but I can’t, I say, leave this sumptuous, and may I say sacred, table without a word of ap- predation.” [MASK] slumped.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Darling	More than punished. I’ve never passed a filthier year myself, it’s been my Gethsemane—” “[MASK], I’m not trying to make you feel bad. You asked me to tell you all this.” “That’s right. Go on.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Margie	Nobody will ever know. He’s the only one who could have told us, [MASK], don’t you see? And he never will.” She peered up at him, tears rolling down her face, her arms still around the Uncle.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Marjorie	Though he took her out more often than the others, he did not even try to kiss her good night. [MASK] was grateful at first for his unusual restraint. Then she began to wonder whether it wasn’t a gambit of dark villainy.
<name>Bertie</name>	Bertie	MARSHA	And you wouldn’t have given a hoot whether he came to the wedding or not. However, not another word from me will you hear. I’m the original genius at conducting one’s love life. Taxi!” Chapter 34. [MASK]’S
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Marjorie	She dished up the eggs and poured coffee. “Well, sit down and have some breakfast, if you’re not too excited to eat.” “I’m not excited at all,” [MASK] said. “But it is interesting, isn’t it?
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	George	“What’s the matter? Did I wake you up?” “No, [MASK]. Matter of fact, I was just going out, so excuse me if—” “Out?” “Just out in the park. Riding.” “Well, well.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Noel	You use me as an excuse to the little girls who are beginning to try to trap you. The great lost love, and all that.” He stared for several seconds before smiling awkwardly. “Now you sound like [MASK].” “Oh, sure.
<name>Darcy</name>	Darcy	Eden	[MASK]’s smile was usually controlled and careful, his eyes remaining sombre, but now a wholly different look came over his face, a charming gleam of warm appreciation and pleasure. Like a sunny break in the clouds on a gray day, it came and went.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Noel	“Seems to be haunting the conversation, doesn’t he? Old trick of his. Let’s go.” The first thing she said in the taxi was, “Remember telling me last year that [MASK] wasn’t going to amount to anything?
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Marjorie	‘Well, you’re missing a bit of heaven on earth. But to business. Do you know how much talent you have?” "Who, me? I’m not sure I have any.” [MASK] took a long pull at the Singapore sling.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Marsha	[MASK]’s father and her bridegroom, standing on either side of her, were of about the same height and build. They wore identical black suits, and their hair was almost the same color. From the back it was hard to tell which was which.
<name>Miss Golightly</name>	Miss Golightly	Marjorie	She sipped, crouching over the cup. She had slant eyes and a charming slow smile; one of those lucky girls, [MASK] thought, who walked around inside a body like jewelers’ work, every detail perfect, and none of it her own doing.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Neville	You kicked my parade!” [MASK] squealed from under the table. “Good heavens,” the judge choked, “the little monster has really bitten my ankle to the bone!” He pulled up his trouser leg, peering anxiously at his thin bluish shank.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Marsha	Don’t you believe me? He’s never come within a mile of it. It was someone else.” She hesitated. She had until now avoided talking about her love life to [MASK], who seemed too sophisticated to be anything but amused by her problems.
<name>Bella</name>	Bella	Marjorie	About the ridiculous speed of it all, [MASK] felt that she ought to be ashamed and worried—but she couldn’t summon shame or worry from any corner of her spirit. His touch, his kiss, his hands, his voice, were all familiar, sweet, and wonderful.
<name>Aunt Kate</name>	Aunt Kate	Noel	For the first time since she had known him he caused her a stir of enjoyable discomfort. “I think you would. I’m getting bored with all these clever writers. I think I’ll marry a doctor and get it over with, just as [MASK] prophesied.
<name>She</name>	She	Marjorie	The riding party passed through a dank muddy tunnel, and came out into a sun-flecked avenue of cherry trees, perfumed and cool. [MASK] was stunned by the charm of it. For the first time she perceived what horseback riding was about.
<name>reconciliation</name>	reconciliation	Noel	In a few minutes, without persuasion, without drama, without argument, without any perceptible stages, the estrangement of almost a year was gone. She was open to [MASK] again, and she was slightly drunk. She walked out of the living room, careful of her steadiness.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	George	With a ready-made excuse in the injured ankle, she could easily have avoided this long drive on the first nice Sunday in May, when the parkways were always horrible. But it was almost a matter of honor to insist on doing anything that her mother opposed, the more so when [MASK] was concerned.
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Wally	His eyes widened and gleamed. “Question of staff morale. I like [MASK]. Furthermore, he’s writing some fine material and making my life much easier. I don’t want him demoralized.” “I see.”
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Marjorie	I’ll be conjugating Latin verbs any second. Let’s get some coffee fast.” The first thing she did was to press fourteen dollars and twelve cents on [MASK], the exact sum she had owed her at the end of the summer.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Marsha	But she remained a shade skeptical, and they drank their tea in silence for a while. Given [MASK]’s face and figure, she thought, she would diet away a lot of weight, cut and thin her hair, underplay the makeup, and dress very severely.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Wally	So she exhaled through her nostrils, but it stung her nose terribly. As soon as the cigarette was burned halfway down she crushed it out with her toe. The boy [MASK] appeared at her side, holding out a gold case.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Marjorie	[MASK] had about reached the conclusion that boys were on the whole more fascinated by sex withheld than by sex granted; and since this is nearly the sum of wisdom on the subject of young love, she managed for the time being to keep out of trouble.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Marjorie	“A real opening-night performance, now. Do all the things we talked about.” The mother struck up My Object All Sublime with grandiose vigor. The space was narrow for capering, but [MASK] went into her number and did her best.
<name>Evelyn</name>	Evelyn	Marjorie	[MASK] went there to see an amateur production of Desire under the Elms, in the company of a boy whose name was now blotted from memory, but whom she remembered for buck teeth and wet hands. After the play there was dancing.
<name>George</name>	George	Greech	He held her with one stiff arm. She heard [MASK] say, “Is there anything else we can do, Doctor? Shall we phone the Tetersville Hospital? They’ll do anything I say—” “Well, if he should come out of it
<name>her</name>	her	Hilda	I’m sorry you told me about [MASK]. I can feel her eyes crawling on my neck like a spider. Let’s get the hell out of here.” They went back to the promenade deck for the ping-pong tournament, in which he was enrolled.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Marjorie	[MASK] was much excited at the prospect of meeting such a celebrity. As she dressed she was thinking that the blond girl was the first honest-to-goodness mistress she had ever seen, though she had been reading books and seeing movies and plays about them all her life.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Marjorie	“Oh yes, sure, naturally,” [MASK] babbled. “Cigarette?” “Why, yes, yes, thanks.” Her hand shook as she took the cigarette, and her puffing at the flame of his lighter was sickeningly long and inexpert.
<name>he</name>	he	Eden	They went back to the promenade deck for the ping-pong tournament, in which he was enrolled. There were only half a dozen other entries for the men’s cup. “It’ll all be over in an hour or so,” [MASK] said.
<name>him</name>	him	Noel	She was rather afraid to bring the subject up with [MASK]. But to her astonishment he agreed very readily to come. He knew nothing whatever about seders, except that matzo was eaten; but when she described the ceremonies to him he said, “Why, it sounds very colorful and alive.
<name>Dr. Lecter</name>	Dr. Lecter	Imogene	My mind had exploded in a crazy fantasy, that’s all. The whole incident would make me fear for my mental health, if I didn’t have a good idea of what caused it. [MASK] pulled me back from the brink.
<name>Twiggy</name>	Twiggy	Marsha	“A crush? Hardly. But she is terrifically attractive.” “You’re more attractive than she is.” “[MASK], how you talk! She’s a model—” “So what? Too much jaw and chin, dear.
<name>Hegel</name>	Hegel	Superb	“[MASK]. Now then, listen carefully. If I were to get technical about what I’m writing, I’d say it reintroduces teleology as a major concept in dialectical analysis, which in itself is mighty startling, or would be in a professional journal, or I’m very much mistaken.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Marjorie	I’m proud of you, honey, and if you remember, I told you you could probably do it.—Well, don’t sit there with a face like a boiled lobster, tell me everything.” “I haven’t harpooned him, don’t be absurd.” [MASK] drank to cover her delighted confusion.
