<name>Baron Munchausen</name>	Baron Munchausen	Ulysses	After he told us these true things, and found what a big boy we made of him, how our eyes popped and we wagged our heads with astonishment, he started making up adventures as thrilling as the stories of [MASK]. My! My!
<name>Mother</name>	Mother	Joe	A big space around the dock was fenced off, and stern Fijian guards with bayonets fixed paced inside the fence, allowing no one but passengers and people with passes near the ship. At the gate we showed our tickets and said good-by to [MASK].
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Araipu	The Samoan greeting too! Everybody was impressed. “Good morning, ladies and gentlemen!” That settled it. [MASK] had come home speaking three languages. Anything he said must be true! “Kia orana kotou!”
<name>Maimiti</name>	Maimiti	Bebe	With [MASK] in tow, we wandered from one islet to the next, swam in the channels and the reef crevices, and later, after gathering flowers, we sat under the magnolia bushes to string them into wreaths.
<name>Darry</name>	Darry	Charlie	At that she started getting hysterical again and jabbering as fast as she could. Leaving her, we crowded around [MASK] but we didn’t have the heart to say scarcely a word. And my big brother—I knew every thought that was passing through his head.
<name>Dill</name>	Dill	Jakey	We didn’t know what they were; but [MASK], being braver than I, tasted one and said it was good. After talking it over, we finally ate all we could dig out. Later we were scared again, thinking they might be poisonous.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Araipu	The man in charge of the soap factory took us to the dairy farm, where we saw our first cows and horses. The horses interested me most, for I was allowed to ride one, but [MASK] was most interested in the cows.
<name>the interpreter</name>	the interpreter	Jakey	It’s the village over there!” “Well, son, tell these bathing beauties to bring their boat alongside before I get mad and start laying eggs!” Of course the man was only joking, but when [MASK] translated, word for word, there was a terrible commotion.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Abel	And their voices! They didn’t talk; they sang! They had lilting voices. The preacher in church, trying to be solemn, the girl buying prints in [MASK]’s trading station, the man calling across the road to his neighbor—they sang their words!
<name>Zenji</name>	Zenji	Aumatangi	As I became more and more comfortable in my father’s unique world of literary things, I found myself vicariously typing on any object that resembled a typewriter, be it a coconut, a wooden bowl or even the bow of my uncle [MASK]’s one-man outrigger canoe.
<name>Bully</name>	Bully	Puaka	[MASK] is “hog” and toro “horns,” so bully beef is ‘hog with horns." The second, pisupo, is the Samoan way of pronouncing “pea soup,” and it. too, means bully-beef.
<name>Queequeg</name>	Queequeg	Teinaki	Then things started happening ten times quicker than I can tell them. “Got him!” the captain yelled, but a second later screamed bloody murder as the line burnt through his hand. [MASK] jumped to help him. Together they bent the line over the taffrail and secured it.
<name>Kolopo</name>	Kolopo	Ngake	The first day Yato Village prepared their food, the second Roto, and the third day [MASK], and so on over and over again until the ship sailed, when all the villages sent boatloads of taro, coconuts, fowls, and pigs aboard as a parting gift.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Scared	Once, the luckiest time of all, we found a case with a big open knothole, and inside the hole we saw some blue cardboard. [MASK], feeling guilty, we poked and scraped until we had broken the cardboard, when we dug out some raisins.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Jakey	But still lots of people tried to make him open his cases of trade goods while the ship was there. Even we cowboys tried. I remember more than anything else how [MASK] and I poked around the cases, wondering what they contained.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jakey	“There will be lots of birds on the outer beach!” With that he broke into the jungle again, this time on the sea side of the clearing. “Let’s make an Indian trail,” [MASK] said.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Willie	But I knew my native boys well enough to be sure that [MASK] would be on the outer beach that very same night, staring dreamily into another girl’s eyes. Perhaps he was disappointed because I didn’t cry very much.
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Jakey	During the show we three girls whispered, laughed, and wept—and we forgot all about it as soon as we were outside the theater. [MASK] sat through the picture in silence, frowning, his fingers gripping the arm of his chair.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Imilia	While the chaotic flow of chants from the women heightened, the men were outside the thatched roof house sheltered in the shadows of coconut trees hurriedly crafting a coffin for [MASK] out of boxes that once contained forty-eight cans of condensed milk.
<name>Aunt Alexandra</name>	Aunt Alexandra	Bebe	I glanced at [MASK]. She was ironing at a mile a minute, and she was so excited and happy she could hardly keep from smiling, which wouldn’t have been the polite thing to do at such a sad time.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Nga	We plucked a hundred or more of their tail feathers, and this, too, raised a row of scolding voices. The tropic birds were harmless so long as we kept our hands away from their beaks. [MASK] was the best at plucking their feathers.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Imilia	I nearly giggled at the sight of him with a mottled leaf in one hand, but it would have been disrespectful. “The family needs you right away,” I said. “Yes, it’s little [MASK]. I have been waiting.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Charlie	But I’d better not tell you the whole story—only that she knew she would be happier on the atolls, where she had some distant relatives. Soon [MASK] joined us. He kept his eyes on the floor and I saw him bite his under lip.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Jakey	We walked along the beach to pick fat noddy tern and love tern fledglings from the bushes. It was as easy as picking strawberries, but hard for me to kill the fuzzy little darlings. I let [MASK] do that while I looked the other way.
<name>Uncle Tom</name>	Uncle Tom	Joe	It was the sort of place where murders are done, and it didn’t make me feel any better when I remembered that [MASK] was carrying our purse. “I wonder if he would murder us for our money?” I thought. Then I heard my father’s voice.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Calypso	I could have told him that it was wasted on [MASK], but presently he used better judgment by telling her about the pretty dresses and things he had bought for her and packed in a brand new camphorwood chest with a tinkling lock, which was in the saloon awaiting her, and that here was the key.
<name>moment</name>	moment	Nga	I snapped, but at that [MASK] closed up like a clam, as she always does, and gave me her funny elfin look out of the corner of her eye, as though to say: “That's one time more, big lady, that I put one over on you!”
<name>John</name>	John	Willie	The breadfruit leaves were pools of silver. The wind ruffled the palm fronds overhead, shaking a shower of gems from their long polished leaves. And then I was sitting with [MASK] under a pandanus tree and he had put his arm around me.
<name>him</name>	him	Frisbie	Some American medical men were assisting him from time to time, and they had decided that he should be evacuated to better facilities. In the early morning we carried [MASK] to the plane. His children and the old fisherman tagged along.
<name>Whitman</name>	Whitman	Whitman	I copied more than I had intended to because I thought the last part would amuse you. Anyway, the notes in his journal gave me so many ideas that I had only to choose the best of them, like picking chocolates from a box of [MASK]’s Sampler.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jakey	[MASK] felt pretty bad about being left behind. Once I found him crying in the copra shed. That was one of the few times I ever knew my brother to cry. He was terribly ashamed when he saw me, but he admitted that it was because he was being left behind.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Willie	[MASK] hung on to me the rest of the time we were ashore. He seemed shy. I guessed that his conscience hurt him because he had taken a new sweetheart after having promised me faithfully that he would die of a broken heart.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bruce	[MASK] and the captain often joined us; then, with skins pink and brown, bathing costumes blue, green, yellow, and red, hair red, yellow and black we were like the water snakes in The Ancient Mariner:
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Andy	You go ashore if you want to and I'll be here to feel sorry for you tomorrow morning when you come aboard with a big head.” “Well, if you’d know the truth of it,” [MASK] said, “I’m just as pleased to be out here.
<name>Nellie</name>	Nellie	Poiri	No man bought less than a six-pound tin of bully beef for dinner; formerly he couldn’t afford a one-pound tin a week. [MASK] made $5,000 on bush gin; some of the wild girls made $100 a night.
<name>Queequeg</name>	Queequeg	Jakey	Maybe he was superstitious,” I suggested. “He had them aboard the cutter to bring him good luck.” “Or maybe he always carried horseshoes with him because he liked to pitch them so much,” [MASK] added. “Fine!”
<name>the sun</name>	the sun	Suvorov	But we did not know that. We did not know that we had seen the last of our fair weather for many days to come, and that when again the sky cleared and the wind moderated, [MASK] would be scarcely more than a memory.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Jakey	“He’s a long time,” I said. “I hope he’s all right.” “I think he’s giving us time to remember it’s his birthday,” [MASK] suggested. Or maybe he’s making sure of a feast by rustling his own food.”
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Elaine	There were no stomach aches for the Suvorov cave children that night. We were too tough and healthy. It being a chilly night and we having no bedclothes, we crowded into one wigwam to roll up in a ball, as snakes do when they hibernate. [MASK] coughed badly.
<name>Long John Silver</name>	Long John Silver	Bebe	He is my best friend! I won’t let that old Piki-Piki have him!” “Yes,” said [MASK] smiling, “but when you sail, if he is not aboard, you’ll let me take his place, won’t you?”
<name>my people</name>	my people	Imilia	I took a moment to pray close to my ancestral plot, asking for courage to continue the journey for the sake of [MASK], and that 1 not turn back and scram for the safety of my Grandmother’s hut by the sea.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Jakey	“Isn’t that what I’ve been trying to tell you for the last hour?” [MASK] growled, and I replied that he had a goofy way of telling me things. We didn’t quarrel long because there was too much work to do.
<name>Black Dog</name>	Black Dog	Teofilo	Huge, fat, as fierce-looking as our wild and woolly Tongan cook, he had a black beard and mustache about six inches long and turned up at the ends. While we were talking to [MASK] the boy suddenly whispered, “Look! Over there!”
<name>Helen</name>	Helen	Johnny	I remember how one day she was sweeping the yard, and how she smiled and said: “I am happy now, [MASK], because I can work again. I want to work hard every day of my life. It is terrible being sick, for then I cannot work.”
<name>Dr. Rieux</name>	Dr. Rieux	Jakey	And that was the time [MASK] behaved in his strange manner. First I must tell you that, after the hurricane, hundreds of tamanu nuts fell from the five remaining trees, along with the leaves that hadn’t been blown off by the wind.
<name>Abby</name>	Abby	Toia	Maybe he was afraid the old tub would suddenly take wing if he got a few yards away, leaving him marooned in that distant heathen land—marooned, never again to see his good wife [MASK], his tame duck, and his young breadfruit tree! 19
<name>the traveler</name>	the traveler	Araipu	To them the principal fun in traveling is in proving how inferior other islands are and in returning home to make sarcastic remarks about them. So the island was eager to hear what [MASK] had to say, and, believe me, he didn’t disappoint them.
<name>She</name>	She	Imilia	[MASK] was learning to walk that day. She relished the attention of the women quietly looking on as she showed off by sliding one foot forward, then pausing to look down at the foot, that it moved, that it was in front of the other.
<name>George</name>	George	Lordy	“[MASK]! I done it again!” he grunted, while we steadied the boat and one of the men bailed the water that had slopped over the sides. “I really gotta start what-you-call dieting,” he sighed.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Araipu	We were keyed up, expecting trouble ahead, and so it was no more than natural that [MASK] and I should jump out of bed, scared stiff, when in the middle of the night we heard the boom of a great cannon, followed by the whine of its shell passing overhead!
<name>his mother</name>	his mother	Araipu	He thought the manager might trick my father into buying bad goods. I think it worried [MASK] even to see the salesmen give me candy. Each time we bought in a new department the salesman would say: “And won't the little girl have a few lollies?”
<name>Tuiavii</name>	Tuiavii	Nga	It is [MASK]!) Then they crowded about us, and during the next fifteen minutes we were kissed by every man, woman, and child of Manihiki. They kissed us, petted us, cried over us as though we were long-lost relatives, their spirits overflowing with loving welcome.
<name>Darry</name>	Darry	Jakey	As we passed our mother, weeping, she bade us each goodbye! Trying to be brave, we each whispered some kind of a farewell, but [MASK], clenching his fists and throwing out his chest, stopped in the doorway and turned to his mother.
<name>Phileas Fogg</name>	Phileas Fogg	William	[MASK] said, “Okay,” climbed into the captain’s boat, and was rowed ashore. But as soon as the boat touched the beach he jumped out, waved his arms around, grabbed his silk hat so he wouldn’t lose it, and yelled, “Run for your lives!
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Jakey	Riding home with us in the truck he sat perfectly still, frowned, and pushed us away. Once he tried to say something but emotion broke his voice. You see, [MASK]’s brain works slowly, surely, and independently; mine works by leaps and bounds.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Abel	“We’ll go ashore in a minute,” [MASK] said. “We gotta give them time.” “Time for what?” The fat man chuckled. “Time to know you’re here, of course,” he said.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Jack	Then [MASK] pushed a button, saying that it was the automatic pilot, and immediately grabbed the “stick,” which looked like half of an automobile steering wheel. Instantly I felt a sinking feeling in my stomach.
<name>Atlantis</name>	Atlantis	Jack	And then, as I looked, the ocean started easing onto an even keel again and the clouds sank until they had returned to their natural place. Then, so suddenly that I screamed with surprise and delight, I saw an island rise like a miracle from the sea! “[MASK]!”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dimly	But there was no time to read any except the most important of his letters while the ship was in the offing, nor to answer more than one or two. [MASK], I remember watching him weighing copra, and feeling sorry for him.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	William	He took [MASK] into the cabin and gave him rum. Then he gave him a beautiful suit of black church clothes, a pair of boots, a silk hat, a picture handkerchief, and a fancy shirt with a stiff collar and a red necktie.
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Araipu	[MASK] had to go whether he wanted to or not, for no one was allowed aboard while they fumigated. I guess it nearly broke the old miser’s heart to put on his beautifully shiny black shoes again, but he had to do it and wear them most of the day.
<name>Emmeline</name>	Emmeline	Imilia	Later, we sat in the night shade of the coconut tree watching the moonlight on the surface of our lagoon and drinking the sweet juice of two of [MASK]’s coconuts. “Let us not get dried up,” she whispered. She was referring to our wombs.
<name>Koro</name>	Koro	Joe	After shouting in Fijian and hearing a grunted reply, [MASK] led us through the doorway. At first we could see only a huge black man squatting in the center of the room before a kerosene lamp. He was dressed in a sulu, which is like a Samoan lavalava, but his chest was bare.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Araipu	He said [MASK] could accompany them if he wore shoes; but the stingy fellow wouldn’t do this for he had only one pair of shoes and was afraid he would wear them out—so he stayed aboard with me; and there we were all day long with not a thing to do.
<name>Makola</name>	Makola	Taingauru	And when [MASK], the witch doctor, gave us some fish and drinking nuts he said, “Who will give you fish and coconuts if your father takes you to the foreign land? The people in the foreign land are cannibals. They will kill you and eat you.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jake	[MASK]'s, being shortest, doesn’t look any worse than the nest of an old frigate bird, with grass and rubbish sticking out every which way, but there’s nothing on earth to compare with the rest of you unless it is a thatched roof after a hurricane.
<name>him</name>	him	Araipu	I guess that fancy duckling must have reminded [MASK] of his tame duck at home, for he only picked at the food, sighed, and mumbled that he was hungry for a nice juicy dish of raw clams and a piece of coconut.
<name>Chitauri</name>	Chitauri	Satan	Within the confines of their thatched roof houses my people talked to each other when the white people were asleep: “They are telling us that because we are bad, when we leave this world we will be sent to a chief whose name is [MASK].
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Araipu	[MASK] was so scared he jumped on a chair and sat there with his legs folded beneath him so the puppy couldn’t bite him. I wasn’t scared, but I was cautious. After a few minutes I got a stick, shooed the puppy into the outhouse, and locked the door.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	John	I been drink too much no can go to sea today. You pleas cap no get too much mad dear cap. I come aboard tomorrow sure think I no come today too much drink. Yours truly [MASK]. “The cheeky blankety-blank, blank!”
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Willie	When we were tired of dancing we sat back under the trees to play guessing games and tell stories. [MASK] and I sat together, but before long he stretched out on the sand to rest his head in my lap and stare into my eyes like a boy in love.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Araipu	Then they would start an exciting story about how they had been taken up twenty floors in an elevator without knowing they had left the ground floor, and how flabbergasted they had been on looking out of a window to see the street far below them. That’s the way it was with [MASK].
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Johnny	It would be terrible, [MASK], if this ship capsized and we were drowned out here in the cold lonely ocean where there’s not even a parson to say a prayer over us or a good woman to weep!
<name>Old Tom</name>	Old Tom	Abel	This was the sort of thing that had happened in the old blackbirding days, but then the people did not return. There was lots of joking. “’Don’t worry, boys,” [MASK] would wheeze.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Araipu	At that the old lady doubled up with laughter. “Heh, heh!” she snickered. “He makem practice shoot!” And with that she hobbled down the road, laughing in a nasty way. [MASK] and I went home, feeling very foolish.
<name>him</name>	him	Abel	I guess you ain’t got much gear to take ashore, so I’ll just step into the cabin to sign for the mail and we’ll shove off.” It took [MASK] a long time to sign for the mail because the captain had a bottle of spirits on the saloon table waiting for him.
<name>please</name>	please	Johnny	Please pass the chicken, [MASK]. Yes, yes! Ahem! Hm! Ahem!” Or when we were walking down the road, every now and then one of us would clear his throat to mutter, “Yes, yes! Ahem, ahem!”
<name>Jew's</name>	Jew's	Jew	There would be these regular lines, but also there would be surprises like a few cartons of all-day suckers or some tins of roasted peanuts, which we had never seen before; or mouth organs, [MASK]’s harps, glass marbles, firecrackers, or playing cards.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Ben	Though [MASK] is an expert boatman he forgot what he was doing: the boat yawed every which way; water slopped over the sides; she nearly capsized several times. The humming sound rose to a roar. A gigantic seaplane shot out of the clouds like a bolt of lightning and thundered down straight toward them.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Johnny	Then I ran forward to kiss her, but she shook her head, whispering, “No, no, no!” and then, fiercely: “I will kiss you tonight, [MASK]! I will kiss all my children tonight, and every night!”
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Grandmother	Whimper and sniff, but do it outside in today’s dusk. “She has the family sickness, of course, we all know that,” [MASK] whispered. “Someone has entered her— the wretched rat!” “A venomous scoundrel!”
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Frisbie	The children all waved goodbye. We M>ere up to 11,000 feet when I was formally introduced to [MASK]. The pilot, who had met him before, suggested that he might like to meet someone who had once worked for a publishing company.
<name>Maui</name>	Maui	Maloku	“Tiane e,” an old woman called out to me from the shack next to ours. “Why are you giving those half-naked thieves colored lollies and fishooks? No doubt they stole the eggs from [MASK]’s lot while she was alone in the taro patch weeding.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jakey	I guess we must have crouched there for a half hour, watching the birds and waiting for them to land. Once we heard a great squawking on the lagoon side of the cay. It was silenced suddenly. [MASK] and I glanced frowning at each other.
<name>Mr. Charrington</name>	Mr. Charrington	Geoffrey	If you met a boy on the road he would grin and shout—not just say—“Goodbye! Oh, yeah!” or perhaps, if he was a specially good pupil, “Where you coming?” But [MASK] loved to teach English because of his vanity.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Nga	I dived and swam while she sun-bathed, and, later she swam a little, too. [MASK] could swim before she could walk properly, and I guess that was because I spent so much time with her in the water.
<name>Mr. Smith</name>	Mr. Smith	Elaine	He would wave his arms around, sweat, look wild, shout, and pound the pulpit with his fist—and all the time he was the worst adulterer on the island and everybody knew it, even we children. One day [MASK] and I caught him blackening his white canvas shoes.
<name>The Shark</name>	The Shark	Poseidon	She started leaking again, but we were in less danger from the ship than from starvation. Our only food was raw oatmeal, and our water was a cup of mud a day, squirming with mosquito larvae. [MASK] had no grudge against us.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Teofilo	Which shows that you can never tell by a man’s looks how gentle his heart may be. We gave [MASK] the cigarettes and tobacco, the coptickling girl the lollipops, to be divided among the villagers, and started back toward the head of the bay.
<name>Stevenson</name>	Stevenson	Frisbie	[MASK] was as pleased to see me as I was to meet him. I had already read his books and had found them delightful. On several islands I had heard of him, and so I was not affected when I said it was a treat.
<name>Juan</name>	Juan	Mata’a	Of course [MASK] would say grace first, for he was very religious. After supper there would be no dishes to wash, for we had eaten on the little green mats of coconut leaves, which we threw in the fire.
<name>Puiawai</name>	Puiawai	Elaine	Often she would pat [MASK]’s fat belly, wag her head as though astonished, and say over and over again, “E apinga tikai! E apinga tikai!’’ (True thing! A true thing!)
<name>Uncle Jack</name>	Uncle Jack	Araipu	or raise our eyebrows to bring a department manager running to us with a sales book in his hand. [MASK] got bilious seeing all that money spent, and it worried him to see the manager take my father down to the basement and buy him drinks.
<name>her own</name>	her own	Elaine	I went down to her room to find everybody asleep except her. She was sitting in a pile of pillows. rubbing coconut oil on [MASK]’s body. I guess I must have been half asleep, because I asked: “Whose baby is that.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Carl	[MASK] and I are no longer married, but remain close friends. Throughout my life I have maintained a journal in which I recorded my daily experiences. This practice was a legacy from my father and has provided the basis for my stories and books.
<name>the boat</name>	the boat	Imilia	“It, meaning [MASK], has reached its end of life on our island. It will go back to where we came from. My heart longs to know what it’s like over there, and that longing gets stronger with each loss.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Johnny	“I’m afraid we’ll be too late, [MASK]. Now that we’re broke except for seventy-two pieces of eight, and our clothes are in rags, it’s going to take a long time to get on our feet again.
<name>the canoe</name>	the canoe	Panikiniki	Though it was much smaller than our other canoe, it was the apple of my father’s eye, and for that reason he would seldom let anyone else sail it. I am going to break from my story to tell you how [MASK] got her name.
<name>Lena</name>	Lena	Tiane	Here, [MASK], take her from me, I must clean this place of them. Now that the moon is full, the next three nights are when spirits wander more than on any other moon nights.” Then, with a coconut broom, she swiped at the air, attacking any lurking uninvited visitors.
<name>Tane</name>	Tane	Imilia	“A venomous scoundrel!” from the woman whose head was covered in [MASK]’s dress. “It’s time to seek the wisdom of the Tangata wotu. He would know by now who is playing around with the life of this little one.”
