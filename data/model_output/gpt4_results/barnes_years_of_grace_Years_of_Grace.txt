<name>Mildred</name>	Mildred	Jack	‘[MASK]’s always been a good and loyal husband and I’ve always been a good and loyal wife. We’ve been married nearly ten years and I’m horribly bored with him. He’s really bored with me, though, of course, he won’t admit it.
<name>Stuart</name>	Stuart	Jimmy	’s always so pyrotechnic in the presence of a third person! When I get arguing with him, I never want to stop!’ ‘Not only,’ said [MASK] mockingly, ‘in the presence of a third person.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Agnes	There’s a great difference, you know, in those two states of mind, or rather of emotion. You’re in love with me and I’m in love with you. I haven’t been in love with [MASK] for years.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Jimmy	The glint of elation in [MASK]’s eyes turned quickly to a look of incredulity, then to one of mock consternation. ‘See here,’ he protested, Tm not tired. I’m not tired at all. I was looking forward to a big evening.’
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Jimmy	[MASK]’s death in a conflict about the issues of which he did not care a damn. A conflict into which he had been driven by her unkindness------No, she would not think that. She would never think that. She had done what she had to do.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Jane	Any other woman would have known it at once, and would either have kicked me out or responded in kind. In either case I’d have tired of her in two months.’ ‘You’re asking me to respond in kind, now,’ said [MASK] tremulously.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Belle	‘I don’t see why you carry on about it like this. I don’t see why you don’t think it’s all very sweet and touching. [MASK]’s been my best friend all my life and now I’m marrying her brother
<name>Modesty</name>	Modesty	Jane	From behind the heavy green curtains of the long French windows the sharp, staccato uproar of the traffic on the rue Daunou rang in her ears. The shrill, toy-like toots of the French taxis punctuated the sound. Cities had voices, thought [MASK].
<name>Lily</name>	Lily	Jane	But now, as [MASK] stood facing her slim white reflection in her mirror, she really couldn’t realize that she was getting married. Where were the thoughts, she wondered, that she had always imagined such a portentous occasion would engender?
<name>Lawrence</name>	Lawrence	Jimmy	She had been kissed — kissed like a pretty chambermaid in her own garden. She had glanced at her own front windows, fearful of a spying servant’s ironical eye. ‘[MASK],’ she said, ‘I wouldn’t have believed it of you!’
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Lizzie	Even when they argued, as they often did, and he disagreed with her utterly, he greeted the sallies that routed him with a whimsical air of flattering applause. Very different from her father’s ‘Oh, all right, [MASK]!’ that terminated so many domestic discussions.
<name>He</name>	He	Jimmy	But, as the days passed and she did not hear from him, her relief had been subtly tempered first with curiosity then with concern, and, at last, with indignation. [MASK] ought to have telephoned. It was rude of him not to.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jane	The windows were all square-paned and many of the houses had green window-boxes. The plants in them were drab and shrivelled, however, in the city heat. [MASK] did not see a single flower.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Jane	He was dying just at the time when [MASK] felt she could have rewarded his love and sympathy as never before. There was no longer any necessity for worrying and warning and watching over her personal drama. She had grown up. Soon she would grow old.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jane	She pointed in the direction from which they had come. [MASK] turned quickly, in surprise, to look. There, gliding from the darkness into light, beneath the little bridge across the lagoon, was a single gondola. The romantic figure of the gondolier stood stark in the moonlight.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jane	‘I must go up and dress for dinner/ said [MASK], rising suddenly. ‘Here’s the newspaper if you’d like to read it until I come down.’ ‘Are you glad I came?’ The question arrested her abruptly in the doorway.
<name>She</name>	She	Jane	She felt she could not bear to cope with the winter that lay before her. Which was, of course, ridiculous. [MASK] knew that it would be just like all other winters — fun enough, when you came to live it.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jane	I don’t know just how I’ll manage it, but I’ll work my way somehow.’ ‘But you’ll come back?’ said [MASK]. She rose as she spoke and walked anxiously over to him. ‘You’ll have to come back, you know.’
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jane	She looked up in his face and laughed. ‘You’re the girl I met at supper,’ he said. He was really very handsome. And he danced divinely. ‘You met lots of girls at supper,’ said [MASK], laughing.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Minnie	As she left the room, she saw her mother sink into her father’s leather armchair. She walked slowly down the hall and up the stairs with [MASK]. She had a queer dazed feeling that this — this couldn’t be happening. Not to her father.
<name>Clive</name>	Clive	Jimmy	He would have admired his romantic role. Yet [MASK] had not wanted to die. He had said as much, very definitely, in that last letter he had written her. Not that he hoped much from the future. But he had no fear of it.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Jane	We’ll wander about the world together and I’ll write a little music and look for pleasant little jobs that won’t keep me too long in any one place. You’ll be awfully uncomfortable, [MASK], a great deal of the time.
<name>Lucia</name>	Lucia	Jane	She shouldn’t be playing with thoughts like that, though. Edged tools in the hands of a child. [MASK] turned on her doorstep and walked slowly back into the living-room to ring for the waitress to remove the ravaged tea-tray.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Jane	And [MASK] knew that, though she had not expected his kiss and certainly had resented it, yet, after she had had it, she had not been able to get it out of her mind, out, indeed, of the very fibre of her being.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Andr£	Funny that just the sight of a hair-ribbon should make her feel his presence so vividly. Should so recall that funny little warm, happy feeling, deep down inside, that was so integral a part of being fourteen and loving [MASK] and never feeling quite sure of how he felt about her in return.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Stephen	I get enough of that at home.’ He strolled over to the hearthrug and took his stand upon it, his back toward the smouldering fire. He was still smiling. ‘I met [MASK] at noon to-day.
<name>Romeo</name>	Romeo	Romeo	And he had had the sense to foresee it. His abrupt departure from her life had been much in the romantic tradition established by [MASK] in the balcony window. His alternatives had been the same. ‘I must be gone and live, or stay and die!’
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Jane	Fifteen years of matrimony had not impaired the lightness of [MASK]’s step. Her fine straight hair was still untouched with grey, her waist was still slender, and her eyes were still bright. They gleamed, now, with a spark of irritation.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Rosalie	They all looked lovely, she thought. They were carrying great shower bouquets of pink sweet peas over their muslin flounces and they wore broad-brimmed hats of pale blue straw. [MASK] looked loveliest of all, and as young as any one.
<name>John</name>	John	Stephen	‘I’m fourteen and a half.’ ‘Picnic to-morrow!’ said [MASK], as his daughter turned toward the door. Her face lit up as she threw him a smile over her smocked shoulder.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Jane	‘See here,’ he protested, Tm not tired. I’m not tired at all. I was looking forward to a big evening.’ ‘Sorry,’ smiled [MASK]. ‘You’re not going to get it.’
<name>Delmonico</name>	Delmonico	Tony	Suddenly he met her eyes and smiled. ‘This is swell!’ he said cheerfully. ‘But an embarrassment of riches! Taking two beautiful women out to dinner at [MASK]’s the same night!’ And suddenly he began softly, ridiculously, to sing.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Cicily	In her turn, she glanced a little uneasily at the twins. Her silence was very eloquent. ‘How stupid of her!’ said [MASK]. ‘A woman who takes a lover is always the underdog.’
<name>Undine</name>	Undine	Carvers	Seen from that secure perspective, the congenital peculiarities of [MASK] seemed always harmless, at times picturesque, and often pathetic. For ten months of the year they figured in her life as mere alien phenomena at which she marvelled detachedly, with easy amusement.
<name>Prue</name>	Prue	Cicily	‘He will be in August,’ said [MASK]. ‘I don’t see why you carry on about it like this. I don’t see why you don’t think it’s all very sweet and touching.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Belle	It can’t betray him, as a woman might. It’s so much safer to love things than people. ‘This brings me to [MASK]’s news. It’s what I’ve been so busy over these last two weeks.
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Flora	It was part of the party. It all went to prove that this was a very usual situation, a very gay situation, a very happy situation. It was the consummation of the friendly conspiracy of chatter. [MASK]’s beautiful formal room was swept and garnished for the ceremony.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jane	—[MASK]’s protest was almost shrill — ‘you are making a mistake! You’re making one this minute! It’s a terrible mistake for you to sit there and talk as if there were anything but one thing to do!’
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Jane	‘You might as well say,’ [MASK]’s mother had said incredulously, ‘that we’ll all be living in flats before we die — one on top of the other like sardines in a box.’ They had all laughed at that.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jane	[MASK] was smiling, too, all over. She walked quickly over to him and held out her hand. His closed completely over it. He didn’t let it go immediately. ‘I’m awfully glad to see you,’ he said.
<name>John</name>	John	Jimmy	Her voice was trembling so that she could not keep it up a moment longer. She turned away from [MASK] to hide her tears. In a moment he had tucked a big clean handkerchief into her hand. She buried her face in the cool, smooth linen.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Jane	[MASK] suddenly realized how tired she was. And how tired of wondering, as she had wondered for two months, just what was happening to Cicily in taxis and in night clubs. The lights were dimming. The lights were going out. The orchestra was silenced.
<name>Myrtle</name>	Myrtle	Jane	They had turned out the lights in the living-room and crept silently up the stairs and exchanged one last kiss at the door of [MASK]’s bedroom. She had opened the door with elaborate precaution and moved quietly into her room. Precautions, however, were unnecessary.
<name>Victoria</name>	Victoria	Jane	‘[MASK],’ he said, ‘you look like a startled faun! You needn’t. Would it have been more discreet of me to use the plural? Should I have said “the right people”? I don’t like that phrase.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Jane	‘I took this train,’ he said presently, ‘because I thought we’d have fun on it together. Don’t you think it’s time we began? We’ve lost almost an hour already.’ ‘What — what do you want to do?’ asked [MASK], again rather stupidly.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Jane	[MASK] had loved to dance to them when she was little. To follow the monkey and slip her allowance in pennies into its cold, damp little claw. She always laughed, still, at a monkey, snatching off its little red cap with a spasmodic gesture and blinking its thanks for a coin.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Flora	‘It fits you beautifully,’ she said. [MASK] looked very white and thin in the sepulchral folds. And strangely older. She moved to the bed to pick up the white roses. As she did so another discreet tap sounded at the door.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Catholics	And we’re — we’re all [MASK]. That doesn’t mean much to me, but it does to him. But when I told them how — how I felt about you — well, they said — all right------I could try my luck with your father.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Jimmy	For God’s sake, stop kissing me! I want to think!’ ‘I don’t want you to think,’ said [MASK]. ‘I just want you to feel.’ ‘But I — I am thinking!
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Agnes	She read it very slowly. ‘She says it’s going to be very hard to give up her dear daughter and she says-----Oh, [MASK], she says — she says — that — that they want me home next winter because they’ll be all alone.’
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Alden	If you hadn’t been on the port tack, she would have had to give you room around the mark.’ ‘We shouldn’t have been on the port tack,’ said [MASK] stubbornly, ‘if the wind hadn’t shifted.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Jane	The car crunched slowly around the gravel driveway. [MASK] watched it to the entrance. Curious, she thought, the gap between the points of view of different generations. The facts of life were always the same, but people thought about them so differently.
<name>John</name>	John	Jack	I have been from the start. I’m thinking of marrying him myself, if he’ll turn that old bean of his to the raising of Russian wolfhounds!’ [MASK] met his sister-in-law’s levity with rather an uncertain smile.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Stephen	She looked a trifle mutinous and very pretty, with her cheeks flushed in the firelight and her crisply curly fair hair a little loosened from the bow at her neck. ‘Good-night,’ said [MASK], as she kissed his bald spot.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jane	I’ve much more than looks. I’ve all the social graces. I’ve been exhibiting them for [MASK]’s benefit for the last twenty minutes and I leave it to her if my face is my fortune! I’ve many more important assets.’
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Jane	The roses that [MASK] had brought to his bedside were still in the vase on the table. The buds had barely reached their prime. Only that morning her father had commented on their ephemeral, creamy bloom. Those roses would outlive him. Life would go on.
<name>Mrs. Ramsay</name>	Mrs. Ramsay	Jane	The car called for them at the playground every afternoon at five. [MASK] was always afraid to let them walk home alone through the traffic. The country lane on which her house had been built, fourteen years before, had long since become a suburban highroad.
<name>Georges</name>	Georges	Stephen	Life no longer had a surprise up its sleeve. But still, after you were thirty-six, you went on living for another thirty-six years or so. Living and thinking about annoying trifles. Why had [MASK], at twenty-two, wanted to be a banker?
<name>Eveline</name>	Eveline	Jane	Every one was applauding. The orchestra in the hall was playing ‘The Stars and Stripes Forever.’ The groom’s cake was decorated with a little silken flag. [MASK] sank down in her mother’s armchair at one end of the room.
<name>John</name>	John	Agnes	she called sharply. ‘Bring down my big black bag to my bedroom and order the motor for a quarter-past four.’ n ‘He was killed instantly,’ said [MASK]. ‘He was shot in the trenches. He was shot through the head.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Jimmy	I used to think it was very smart to say that every Lakewood housewife was potentially a light lady. I used to think I believed it. I did believe it theoretically, [MASK]. But now — now when it comes to practice — I see there’s a great difference.’
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jane	‘As you say, we were both children, four years ago.’ [MASK] paused a moment, trying vainly to blink away her tears. It had been just a dream, she knew, but the end of even a dream was very dreadful.
<name>Phyllis</name>	Phyllis	Jane	Grown up. Her school days behind her. A young lady. About to become a debutante. Old enough to loiter, unrebuked, in bed, after a late party, until her father had left for the office and [MASK] was well on her way to school.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Jane	All blue and white, with white-painted furniture and a little brass bed and real silver brushes and mirrors on her little dressing-table. [MASK] had no dressing-table. She kept a wooden brush and a celluloid comb and a steel nail file in her upper bureau drawer.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Jimmy	‘Do you know, as far as I’m concerned, I almost hope I will stay there. The one thing that I couldn't bear would be the thought that I could ever get over you.’ ‘Why?’ said [MASK].
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Jane	[MASK] did not look at her father, but she knew, without looking, from his sudden, breathless silence that he had suffered a slight sense of shock. She realized then that her words were open to misinterpretation. She glanced quickly up at him.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Jane	He tweaked her pigtails affectionately. ‘Life is a joke that’s just begun! Three little maids from school!’ They were out and had run down the steps before he could go any further. [MASK]’s sense of embarrassment had deepened.
<name>He</name>	He	Jane	There, gliding from the darkness into light, beneath the little bridge across the lagoon, was a single gondola. The romantic figure of the gondolier stood stark in the moonlight. The light from a lamp on the parapet fell clearly on the faces of his passengers. [MASK] recognized them in an instant.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Cicily	‘He’d be the last, of course, to criticize [MASK]. He acts — he acts exactly as if it weren’t happening.’ Her voice was trembling a little. ‘I wouldn’t speak to him about it for worlds.’
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Jane	[MASK] sat a moment in silence, staring across the deep blue water at the glowing embers in the Western sky. ‘I can remember — I can remember,’ she said slowly, ‘how I felt about parents — mixing in and — and spoiling things that were really lovely-----’
<name>She</name>	She	Jane	His big blue eyes looked mildly up at her over his gold-rimmed spectacles. His face was very fat and round and pink and his head was very spherical and almost hairless. In spite of his white moustache, [MASK] always thought he looked just like a good-natured baby.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Jane	she seemed to be saying. ‘Why carry on like this about it? Surely you’re not surprised!’ [MASK] tried to think that she was not surprised, feeling an absurd obligation to justify her Victorian point of view to the opal-tinted lady.
<name>Challis</name>	Challis	Cicily	‘Why not?’ said [MASK]. ‘What are your brains given you for, except to think with? I believe in being practical. That’s why I haven’t made up my mind. There are a great many practical difficulties toconsider.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Cicily	The lips were cruel, she thought. Nevertheless, the room was charming. ‘I don’t know why you should,’ she said slowly. ‘It’s all so nice.’ ‘It’s nice enough,’ said [MASK] vaguely.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Jane	And turned to descend them. [MASK] mounted to her room in silence. At thirty-six life was terrible, she thought, as she pulled on her rubber shoes. It had no dignity. It wasn’t at all what you expected, when you were young.
<name>Clarence</name>	Clarence	Jimmy	Once she had worried him awfully. She had not heeded his warning. She had been swept by the intoxication of her love for [MASK] into indifference, into resentment even, toward that warning and that worry. She had given him a very bad time.
<name>Trillian</name>	Trillian	Andre	‘No,’ said [MASK], ‘but it’s all right now. You can look.’ She did, and removed her hand from his as they moved slowly by the crowded landing platform and out and up once more into the heavenly vault.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mamma	Goes around, you know, with a tremendous chip on her shoulder. She does what the nurse tells her to, but she does it grudgingly. She looks as if she’d like to say, “Don’t blame me if it .in 9 rains! ‘Does it bother [MASK]?’
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Jimmy	‘I know you can do great things if you’re prodded by a little encouragement-----’ ‘Say rather if I’m prodded by “the endearing elegance of female friendship,” ’ said [MASK], still with the smile. ‘It does more for a man than you know.
<name>Connell</name>	Connell	Andre	‘They didn’t talk like that — but they thought the same things. I — I could see them thinking.* ‘They didn’t — like it?’ ‘They like you,’ said [MASK].
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Kipling	That’s just [MASK]’s revolt against Victorian prudery. I suppose he felt very sophisticated when he first got off that line! The complications of living seem very complicated when you look at them from a distance. When you’re tangled up in them yourself, you know they’re very simple.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jane	It kills me to live with your memory, but I wouldn’t forget you for anything in the world.’ His eyes were very bright as he stood looking down at her. [MASK] turned her head to gaze out over the flat, sunny Skokie Valley.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Stephen	Perhaps she would never have to tell [MASK]. Or tell him, at least, only of an evil that had been avoided, a peril that had been escaped, a sin that had been atoned. ‘Luncheon is served, madam,’ said the waitress.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Isabel	‘I can remember — I can remember,’ she said slowly, ‘how I felt about parents — mixing in and — and spoiling things that were really lovely-----’ ‘What things?’ pursued [MASK] hotly.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Agnes	A stiff west wind was blowing and the leaves were fluttering down all around them in the gale. Golden maple leaves twisting and twirling and drifting in every direction. The tops of the trees were already bare. ‘That’s nonsense,’ said [MASK].
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Jimmy	If you’re really the Colonel’s lady, [MASK], no matter how little you may want to do it, you know exactly what you ought to do.’ She turned away from him and stood staring out through the terrace doors at the April garden.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Andre	She slipped from his embrace. She rose to her feet. [MASK] stood up, too, and held out his hands. She seized them in her own. He stooped to kiss her fingers. ‘Good-bye,’ he said.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jane	Could it be possible, [MASK] was thinking, that she had ever looked like that? That she had ever smiled like that? Could it be possible that she had ever been anything so fresh and young and fair and inexperienced?
<name>Jerry</name>	Jerry	Jenny	‘If a son of mine wanted to run dog kennels, I’d think he was a damn fool!’ ‘Well, that’s a matter of opinion,’ said [MASK] very sweetly. ‘I like dogs. I like them, on the whole, rather better than people.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Cicily	But later he took up with the bond business. That’s the way most of us get married. Did you know that, [MASK]? But later we nearly all of us take up with something else and after that we only use broomsticks to sweep with.’
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Jimmy	[MASK]’s face was very calm. He seemed, at the moment, a very tranquil faun. In one instant, however, by one sentence, he shattered the tranquillity of the moment. ‘What do you think,’ he said, ‘is going to happen to you and me?’
<name>She</name>	She	Jane	It looked like a broken kaleidoscope of green and pink and yellow glass. [MASK] wondered if it were a sunset or a woman, then realized that her ideas of painting were outdated. It was obviously a reaction, or, at the most concrete, a passion or a mood.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Jane	‘What’s happened?' Her mother smiled at her very kindly. ‘Nothing has happened, [MASK]. I’m very glad you haven’t read the book. It’s not at all a nice book for a child to read.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Jane	‘I’ll have a beige model here, [MASK], for you to look at.’ They all went out of the brown-stone stable and stood for a moment in the old carriage court. The Furnesses’ back yard looked just as it always had.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Jane	The mild May air was very refreshing, after the crowded rooms. [MASK] took a great breath of it as they rushed down the steps, past the crowd by the awning. The wedding guests came running after them.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Andre	She didn’t want to see [MASK], ever again. He — he shouldn’t have mentioned it, of course, but he was quite right about doors. A great deal of water had run under the bridge since the April afternoon when his first letter had arrived.
<name>George</name>	George	Stephen	Somehow it seemed to her at the moment that she put up with them all very easily. She had a normal life and children did amuse you! Arm in arm with [MASK] she strolled across the terrace in the early evening air.
<name>Antoinette</name>	Antoinette	Andre	‘Those frogs!’ ‘French people,’ said her mother, once more with dignity, ‘don’t feel about these things the way we do. They have very different ideas of right and wrong.’ ‘[MASK]’s mother is English.’
<name>Clarence</name>	Clarence	Jane	I knew how it would be.’ ‘You knew how it would be?’ faltered [MASK]. ‘I even knew you wouldn’t come down to breakfast. In point of fact, I didn’t come down to breakfast myself.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Agnes	I feel that’s been said before. Let’s say I’m a bad habit, like nicotine or alcohol. Once you take me up, you’ll find it hard to get on without me.’ ‘Don’t be ridiculous!’ said [MASK].
