<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Fran	“He’d get money and first thing he’d do was buy me a dozen roses, or a white orchid even. He didn’t care what he did with the money as long as I got my flowers first. You did that for me, didn’t you, [MASK]?”
<name>Rochester</name>	Rochester	Francis	I don’t use ’em.” “Have you none of the minor vices? Do you perhaps drink whiskey?” “I’ve had a bit but the most I drink of is ale.” “Do you think I’m mad, [MASK]?”
<name>Sal</name>	Sal	Mac	“Mister, I told the guy, I’m starvin’, I gotta have somethin’. And he gave me two onions.” “You had money,” [MASK] said. “I told ya, get a loaf of bread, but you got a pint of wine.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Francis	“I believe I’ve got a job for you if you want it, [MASK],” the preacher said. “I worked today up at the cemetery.” “Splendid.” “Shovelin’ dirt ain’t my idea of that much of a job.”
<name>Some possible options are: John, Mary, Tom, Sarah, etc.</name>	Some possible options are: John, Mary, Tom, Sarah, etc.	Guy	Then I bumped into one of my other kids last week and he tells me the wife never told nobody I did that. [MASK] drops a kid and it dies and the mother don’t tell a damn soul what happened. 1 can’t figure that' out.
<name>Meat</name>	Meat	Francis	Shining white display cases with slanted and glimmering glass offered rows of splendid livers, kidneys, and bacon, provocative steaks and chops, and handsomely ground sausage and hamburg to [MASK], the lone customer. “Help you?” a white-aproned butcher asked.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Helen	“Just a quarter.” “Give us one.” He fished a quarter out of his pants and pinned the gardenia on [MASK]’s lapel with a pin the girl handed him. “It’s been a while since I bought you flowers,” he said.
<name>Slim</name>	Slim	Clara	My fingers. I rubbed myself to see if I was livin’. You know, I wanna ask you one question.” “No,” [MASK] said. “You said no. Whataya mean no?” “What’s he gonna ask?”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Francis	“Check her out now,” [MASK] said. “Don’t tell her I’m here. Just see is she okay and does she need anything. Don’t say I sent you or nothin’ like that. Just check her out.”
<name>Elvis</name>	Elvis	Francis	He stood up and waved his wine in a gesture imitative of [MASK]; then he rocked back and forth as he sang, strongly and on key: “The bulldogs all got rubber teeth, and the hens lay soft-boiled eggs.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Annie	I’ll get it.” “You will not,” [MASK] said. “That trunk is none of your affair.” “But I’ve already seen it. There’s a pair of spikes too, and clothes and newspapers and old pictures.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Annie	All the papers I got in the world was in that trunk, except one other place I got a few more clips. But no letters noplace. It’s a good old letter, I’d say.” “I’d say so too,” [MASK] said.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Francis	“Ten pounds here, and this is twelve and a half.” “Give us that big guy,” [MASK] said, and he put the five singles and change on the white counter as the butcher wrapped the turkey in waxy white paper.
<name>David</name>	David	Francis	But every scabby-souled one of them was trapped between pillars of fire when [MASK] pulled back, wound up his educated right arm, and let fly that smooth round stone the weight of a baseball, and brained the scab working as the trolley conductor.
<name>Mr. Hendricks</name>	Mr. Hendricks	Daniel	“Pleased to meet you,” [MASK] said. “The feeling’s mutual, boy. You’re a big lad for ten.” “I’ll be eleven in January.” “You cornin’ from school, are ye?” “From instructions, religion.”
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Francis	“You are such a handsome boy. You must have many girls in love with you.” “No,” said [MASK]. “I never been good with girls.” “Why ever not?” “I don’t tell ’em what they want to hear.
<name>Flora</name>	Flora	Catholics	“[MASK] don’t like Methodists. What the hell, that’s even. And I don’t see any Catholic missions down here. I ain’t had any Catholic soup lately.” “I won’t do it and that’s that.”
<name>Sal</name>	Sal	Francis	“Eighteen years,” [MASK] said. “The old lock was just down from my house.” “What kind of lock?” “On the Erie Canal, you goddamn dimwit. I could throw a stone from my stoop twenty feet over the other side of the canal.”
<name>Death</name>	Death	Francis	You’ll not touch my brother’s coffin. Pay her no mind, the Fiddler told [MASK] from his perch on the riddled pot. I don’t blame you for anything. Wasn’t I ten years your elder? Couldn’t I make up my own mind?
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Clara	“Golly it’s cold for this time of year, and they’re calling for snow. Just feel my hands.” “This happens to be my home,” [MASK] said hoarsely, “and I ain’t about to feel your hands, or your head either.
<name>Uncle Remus</name>	Uncle Remus	Francis	“May I make you some tea, [MASK]?” “No, ma’am.” “Would you care for one of my husband’s cigars?” “No, ma’am. I don’t use ’em.” “Have you none of the minor vices?
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Francis	[MASK] said, and he chuckled. “S’pose I could use a new outfit. Get rid of these rags.” He then singled out a full wardrobe, down to the hand- kerchief, and piled it all on the floor in front of the trunk.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Francis	“I can’t escape myself.” “That’s what I’m talkin’ about,” [MASK] said. “I tried it before.” “I know, but you can’t do it, so you might as well live with it.”
<name>Steve</name>	Steve	Francis	Look at you, brand-new clothes. But look at me. I’m only a bum. A no-good bum.” “You ain’t that bad,” [MASK] said. “You’re a bum, but you ain’t that bad.”
<name>he</name>	he	Daniel	“There’s a whole trunk of your things in the attic,” she said. “It might be there.” “It is,” [MASK] said. “I know it is. I saw it. I’ll get it.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Rudy	“She comes in drunk, he kicks her right out. He hates drunk women more’n he hates us.” “Why the hell’s he preachin’ if he don’t preach to people that need it?” “Drunks don’t need it,” [MASK] said.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Martin	“That’s [MASK]’s baloney. But he turned somebody’s head around with it, ’cause I’m back in good odor with the pols, is how he put it on the phone. In other words, I don’t stink to them no more.”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Helen	[MASK] has had a lifetime of sadnesses with her lovers. Her first true love kept her in his fierce embrace for years, but then he loosened that embrace and let her slide down and down until the hope within her died.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Francis	[MASK] nodded and the preacher gave him a firm and flinty smile in return. The preacher then took the beatitudes for his theme. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
<name>who</name>	who	Billy	They’d painted Sacred Heart Church since he last saw it, and across the street School 20 had new tennis courts. Whole lot of houses here he never saw, new since ’16. This is the block they live in. What [MASK] said.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Francis	“I ain’t tough.” “Well I’m tough,” [MASK] said. “Screw around with me, you’ll die younger’n I will.” “Oh I’ll die all right. I’m just as busted as that ceiling.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Francis	They didn’t even call her.” “He didn’t look any different than when I married him.” “No kiddin’,” [MASK] said. “Outside of his hair was snow-white, that’s all.”
<name>him</name>	him	Gerald	Got a day job up there and tracked him down and talked there awhile.” “Talked?” “Talked to [MASK]. Told him how it was. Told him a bunch of stuff.” “I’ll bet he was glad to hear from you.”
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Katrina	When his torso was naked, [MASK] stunned him with a kiss, and with an exploration of the whole of his back with her fingertips. He held her as he would a crystal vase, fearful not only of her fragility but of his own.
<name>Charity</name>	Charity	Chester	How come you wouldn’t stay at the mission when you got an invite?” “I don’t want their charity.” “You ate their soup.” “I did not. All I had was coffee. Anyway, I don’t like [MASK].
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Annie	“[MASK], I got five million things to ask you, and ten million things to tell. I’d like to eat all the dirt in this yard for you, eat the weeds, eat the dog bones too, if you asked me.
<name>regulars</name>	regulars	Francis	Behind the half-busy bar a man with high collar, string tie, and arm garters drew schooners of beer from a tap, and at tables of no significant location sat men and women [MASK] recognized: whores, bums, barflies.
<name>Strange</name>	Strange	Stranger	“I thought of it, I admit that. But I see it couldn’t work, not after all these years.” “It’d take some doing, I know that.” “Take more than that.” “[MASK] things have happened.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Helen	“What long?” “I don’t know. Months musta been if you had an apartment.” “I was here awhile, six weeks maybe, once.” “Oh we had it much longer than that,” [MASK] said.
<name>Eddie</name>	Eddie	Bill	Ain’t no such things as cops, said [MASK]. “Maybe they ain’t none of ’em got to heaven yet, but they been pesterin’ hell outa me down here.” No cops chasin’ you, pal. “You got the poop?”
<name>John</name>	John	Francis	“Seven.” “All right, what the hell’s the difference?” “Get up the wagon.” Two minutes in the moving wagon told [MASK] his tail-bone would be grieving by day’s end, if it lasted that long.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Helen	“I’m a lucky man. But she’s pretty sick. That’s why you can’t stay. She eats a lot of toast.” “Oh I could make some toast,” [MASK] said, standing up from her chair. “Would you like that?”
<name>doctor</name>	doctor	Francis	“Are you feeling better?” he asked her. “I’m fine, fine indeed. And how are you, [MASK]?” “Do you want me to go and get your husband?” “My husband?
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Annie	no, I know you never, I always knew you never), and so it is natural with a woman like [MASK] that the kiss come out of every part of her body and more, outa that mouth with them new teeth
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Rudy	He cushioned his raw spot as best he could with the sock, then tightened the new lace, gently, so the shoe wouldn’t flop. And he walked on toward the cemetery. “There’s seven deadly sins,” [MASK] said. “Deadly?
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Clara	“I won’t shut up. I remember when she came to my place years ago, begging for food. I know her a long time. I’m honest in what I know.” “I never begged,” said [MASK].
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Rudy	“Get us a couple of jugs and then go get a flop and get some shuteye.” “Hey,” [MASK] said. “Now you’re sayin’ somethin’ I wanna hear. Where’d you find all this money?” “Up in a tree.”
<name>her</name>	her	Katrina	He saw himself and [MASK] in a ravenous lunge that never was, and then in a blissful stroking that might have been, and then in a sublime fusion of desire that would always be. Did they love? No, they never loved. They always loved.
<name>She</name>	She	Helen	What brought her to this uncertainty is the accumulation of her sins, and if you must call them sins, then there is certainly quite an accumulation. But [MASK] prefers to call them decisions, which is why she has no compulsion to confess them.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Francis	“Today’s a holy day of obligation,” she said. “It’s All Saints’ Day.” “Yup,” said [MASK]. “I want to go to church in the morning.” “All right, go to church.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Francis	“I can’t spend all six,” [MASK] said. “I gotta give some to the lawyer. I figure I’ll give him a deuce. After all, he got me the job and I owe him fifty.” “Where do you plan to sleep?”
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Katrina	“So you’ve been protecting us from scandal with your silence.” “Yes, ma’am.” “Would you please not call me ma’am. It makes you sound like a servant. Call me [MASK].” “I couldn’t do that.”
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Francis	“She’ll kick us the hell out or call the cops on us.” “That’ll be the day I get kicked out of a joint like this,” [MASK] said. “This is pigswill. I lived in better pigswill than this goddamn pigswill.”
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Rosskam	“That’s one heavy item.” “You call this heavy?” [MASK] said, and he heaved the drum upward and set its bottom edge on his right shoulder. Then he let it slide to chest level, hugged it, and set it down.
<name>Hobo</name>	Hobo	Francis	“Down there,” [MASK] said, pointing toward the tracks beyond the carbarns, “I was in this boxcar and didn’t know where I was goin’ except north, but it seemed I was safe. It wasn’t movin’ very fast or else I couldn’t of got into it.
<name>Petunias</name>	Petunias	Dahlias	“Sure. See the dog.” “It’s too bad the flowers are gone. We had so many flowers this year. [MASK] and snapdragons and pansies and asters. The asters lasted the longest.” “You still got them geraniums right here.”
<name>Jessie</name>	Jessie	Rosskam	That hand’s seen it all. I mean the worst. Dead men took their last ride on that hand. You get me?” [MASK] reined the horse, braked the wagon, and looped the reins around a hook on the footboard.
<name>Brett</name>	Brett	Sandra	“She wants to sleep it all away. I’ll bet she doesn’t even feel cold.” “She’s a cake of ice.” [MASK] moved, turning her head toward the voices but without opening her eyes. “You got no wine?”
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Francis	“It’s nice,” [MASK] said. “It’s all nice.” □ □ □ The Gilded Cage door opened into the old Gayety lobby, now the back end of a saloon that mimicked and mocked the Bowery pubs of forty years gone.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Helen	[MASK] also cared for her appearance and kept her body clean. She washed her un-derthings regularly and wore earrings and dressed modestly and carried her rosary until they stole it. She did not sleep when sleep was not called for.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Rudy	But that don’t make it right that she can’t go inside to get warm. Just because you’re drunk don’t mean you ain’t cold. “Just because you’re drunk don’t mean you ain’t cold,” he said to [MASK].
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Moose	Let’s get outa this pigswill. Get outa this stink and go where I can breathe. The weeds is better than this pigswill.” “So long, friend,” [MASK] said. “Thanks for the wine.”
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Fran	You can’t keep track of her. She’ll drop dead in the street one of these days, wanderin’ around like she does.” “She needs you.” “Maybe so.” “What do you need, [MASK]?” “Me?
<name>Sal</name>	Sal	Annie	“Like it was this morning.” “Old times.” “Very old.” “Jesus Christ, [MASK], I missed everybody and everything, but I ain’t worth a goddamn in the world and never was. Wait a minute. Let me finish.
<name>Wesley</name>	Wesley	Rudy	“I didn’t have noplace to flop, no money, no jug, nobody around. I had a jug but it ran out.” [MASK] fell back on the slab and wept instant tears over his condition. “I’ll kill myself, I got the tendency,” he said.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Francis	And there are things I did without needin’ to learn. And I never wanted to know about them either. [MASK]’s hands, as he looked at them now, seemed to be messengers from some outlaw corner of his psyche, artificers of some involuntary doom element in his life.
<name>he</name>	he	Francis	He looked across the street and saw a red-eyed mongrel waiting in the half-lit corner of an alley and he charged after it, picking up a stone as he went. The cur fled down the alley as [MASK] turned his ankle on a raised sidewalk brick and sprawled on the pavement.
<name>her</name>	her	Helen	She has always appreciated the fine things in life: music, kind words, gentility, flowers, sunshine, and good men. People would feel sad if they knew what [MASK]’s life might have been like had it gone in another direction than the one that brought her to this room.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Francis	“You wanna stand up?” “No. I’ll wait here.” “You’re gettin’ all dusty.” “That’s good.” “Whatever you say,” [MASK] said, standing up. “But watch out for them dogs.”
<name>Benjy</name>	Benjy	Rudy	“And it was all in her ass.” [MASK] raised up his head and looked at the wine bottle in his hand. He held it up to the light. “What makes a man a drunk?” he asked.
<name>Candy</name>	Candy	Rosskam	[MASK] said. “You don’t quit before dark.” “Gotta see some people up ahead. Ain’t seen ’em in a while.” “So go.” “ ’Course I want my pay for what I done till now.”
<name>him</name>	him	Francis	Well, she is subservient to [MASK], and always has been. It was she who, by this very subservience, had perpetuated his relationship to her for most of their nine years together. How many times had she walked away from him? Scores upon scores.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Sandra	Goddamn spooks, they follow you everywheres but they don’t matter. You stand up to ’em is all. And you do what you gotta do. [MASK] joined the women of three, the women of four, in the far comer.
<name>you'd</name>	you'd	Rudy’d	It was a long way, but there wasn’t no other place in the middle of the damn night. And walking was the only way. You wait for a damn bus or a trolley at this hour, [MASK] be dead in the gutter.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Francis	And she doesn’t love [MASK] as a companion, for he is always screaming at her and leaving her alone to be fingered by other men. And she certainly doesn’t love him as a love thing, because he can’t love that way anymore.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Katrina	The world is much too beautiful for most of us. It can destroy us with its beauty. Have you ever seen anyone faint?” “Faint? No.” “No, what?” “No, [MASK].”
<name>the protagonist</name>	the protagonist	Andy	But as they turned they confronted a pair of raiders moving toward them from their left flank. “Filthy bums,” one raider said, and swung his bat at [MASK], who stepped deftly out of range, ran off, and was swallowed up by the night.
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Jack	“I had a bowl of soup about six o’clock but it went right through me. I’m gonna have to eat somethin’ soon.” “I don’t care whether you eat or not,” [MASK] said.
<name>John</name>	John	Francis	[MASK] found the grave without a search. He stood over it and reconstructed the moment when the child was slipping through his fingers into death. He prayed for a repeal of time so that he might hang himself in the coal bin before picking up the child to change his diaper.
<name>Joyce</name>	Joyce	Halloween	“They’re good and warm.” “Just what I need. Nothin’ left of mine.” “It’s fine that you’re off the drink. You’ve got a strong look about you today.” “Just a false face for [MASK].”
<name>Oedipa</name>	Oedipa	Francis	“I’m going downtown, [MASK],” she said. “Shouldn’t you put something on? Some clothes?” “Clothes?” she said. She looked down at her naked self and then cocked her head and widened her eyes into quizzical rigidity.
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Danny	I mean that you must come so that we can talk about the things you ought to know, things about the children and about the family. There’s a cot we could set up in [MASK]’s room if you wanted to stay over next time.
<name>Sister</name>	Sister	Francis	[MASK] put the cup down and slipped her ratty shoe onto her left foot. He lifted her, a feather, carried her to the wall of the mission, and propped her into a sitting position, her back against the building, somewhat out of the wind.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Francis	“What no?” [MASK] said. “You afraid we’d all get drunked up if we stopped in to say hello?” “I’m not afraid of that.” “Then let’s go see him.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Helen	A will to grace, if you would like to call it that, however elusive that grace has proven to be. Was this willfulness a little deceit [MASK] was playing on herself? Was she moving, instead, in response to impulses out of that deep center?
<name>Beethoven</name>	Beethoven	Finny	Are there any more at home like you? Freude, schoner Gotterfunken, Tochter aus Elysium! The day had all but begun with music. She left [MASK]’s car humming the “Te Deum”; why, she could not say.
<name>Randy</name>	Randy	Billy	“That money ain’t nothin’. Get more tomorrow.” “It was.” “Was what?” “There was fifteen dollars in there besides the other.” “Fifteen? Where’d you get fifteen dollars?” “Your son [MASK] gave it to me.
<name>Brett</name>	Brett	Fran	We’d get married tomorrow if only he could get a divorce, wouldn’t we, [MASK].” “That’s right, honey.” “We battle sometimes, but only when he drinks. Then he goes haywire.”
<name>anyone</name>	anyone	Francis	As she walked she considered the immediate future for herself and her twelve dollars, the final twelve dollars of her life capital, money she never intended to tell [MASK] about, money tucked safely in her brassiere. Don’t touch my breasts.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Francis	“I’m renegin’ and I don’t like to do that.” □ □ □ [MASK] put down his wine, walked to the bathroom, and sat on the toilet, cover down, trying to understand why he’d lied about a shoestring.
<name>her</name>	her	Helen	At some point it all came together and didn’t make much difference anyway, for sad or happy, happy or sad, life didn’t change for [MASK]. Oh, her man, how much she loves you. You can’t imagine. Poor girl, all despair now.
<name>Professor</name>	Professor	Francis	“Not even after my spell?” “I just took it as a spell. A spell'don't have to be crazy.” “Of course you’re correct, [MASK]. I am not crazy. With whom have you talked about that day’s happenings?”
<name>Babe</name> (referring to Babe Ruth)	Babe (referring to Babe Ruth)	Francis	You were really a hell of a ball player.” “Not bad,” [MASK] said. “Coulda been worse.” “These sportswriters liked you.” “I did crazy things. I was good copy for them. And I had energy.
<name>Eddie</name>	Eddie	Francis	“You lookin’ good there, bum,” [MASK] said. “I been in the hospital.” “What for?” “Cancer.” “No shit. Cancer?” “He says to me you’re gonna die in six months.
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Helen	Because priests are good. And so when [MASK] holds the brass, and looks at the clock that still says ten minutes to eleven, and thinks of slippers and music and the great butterfly and the white pebble with the hidden name, she has this passing thought for priests.
<name>her</name> (There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to a female character whose name is not specified.)	her (There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to a female character whose name is not specified.)	Helen	He would then reach down and touch [MASK] on the top of the head and stroke her skull the way a father strokes the soft fontanel of his newborn child, stroke her gently so as not to disturb the flowing fall of her hair. Because it was so pretty.
<name>George</name>	George	Moose	“Look at ’em out there. Everybody out there’s workin’.” “You’re crazier than he is,” [MASK] said. “Ain’t no jobs anyplace. Where you been?” “There’s taxis. There goes a taxi.”
<name>Yasha</name>	Yasha	Francis	Wasn’t I ten years your elder? Couldn’t I make up my own mind? But then the Fiddler gave [MASK] a look that loosened a tide of bafflement, as he said solemnly: It’s those traitorous hands of yours you’ll have to forgive.
<name>Straw</name>	Straw	Francis	He touched them and found them dry. One barn door canted on one hinge, and [MASK] calculated that if he could move the door a few feet to sleep in its lee, he would be protected from the wind on three sides.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Francis	But then she said: “And I only had one husband. I only had one man.” Which froze [MASK]’s gizzard. “That’s what the religion does,” he said, when he could talk. “It wasn’t the religion.”
