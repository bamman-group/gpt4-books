<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Chamberlain	And there is still something every now and then which says, ‘Yes, but what if you are wrong?’ ” [MASK] stopped. A shell burst dimly a long way off, a dull and distant thumping.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Chamberlain	“Don’t swear,” [MASK] said automatically. He thought of yesterday. I used him to plug a hole. My brother. Did it automatically, as if he was expendable. Reached out and put him there, as you move a chess piece.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Chamberlain	But he was not hit. He saw an officer: handsome full-bearded man in gray, sword and revolver. [MASK] ran toward him, stumbled, cursed the bad foot, looked up and aimed and fired and missed, then held aloft the saber.
<name>Chamberlain</name>	Chamberlain	Kilrain	He turned away, turned back. Half the right jawbone visible, above the bloody leer: face of one of the Second Maine prisoners who had volunteered just a few moments past—the fat one. Never had time to know his name. He turned to [MASK].
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Lee	He said, “I regret the need to wake you, sir.” [MASK] looked past him into the soft blowing dark. The rain had ended. A light wind was moving in the tops of the pines—cool sweet air, gentle and clean.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Kilrain	[MASK] says tell the truth. Which is? Fight. Or we'll shoot you. Not true. I won’t shoot anybody. He walked slowly out into the sunlight. He thought: but the truth is much more than that. Truth is too personal.
<name>Forrest</name>	Forrest	Buford	No, [MASK] had reformed his boys. He had thrown away the silly sabers and the damned dragoon pistols and given them the new repeating carbines, and though there were only 2,500 of them they could dig in behind a fence and hold anybody for a while.
<name>Shane</name>	Shane	Chamberlain	“Where is he?” The rider indicated the crest, trees at the far end. [MASK] said, “Haven’t got a horse, but I guess I can make that.” He staggered to his feet.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Lawrence	“Ghoul,” he said. But he drank, and the coffee was sweet with brown sugar, and strength boiled into him. “How you feel, Colonel, sir? You notice I don’t say ‘[MASK].’ ” “I feel fine.”
<name>Longstreet</name>	Longstreet	Lee	The couriers were right: they were retreating. Victory. [MASK] put his glasses to his eyes, felt his hands tremble, focused, saw: Union artillery forming on the high hill, men digging. The fight was not over. Must not let those men occupy the high ground.
<name>Frederic</name>	Frederic	Lee	He sat down and took a drink and he did not think any more about the war. 6. [MASK] He worked all that night. The noise went on around him until long after midnight. His staff was too small: must do something about that.
<name>Chamberlain</name>	Chamberlain	Pickett	The attack would guide on [MASK]. More minor questions, then silence. They stood together, the four men, looking up at the Union line. The mist had burned away; there were a few clouds, a slight haze.
<name>Katkov</name>	Katkov	Lee	There was something heavy and dark and tight about the day, riding stiffly in the broad barren field, in harsh sunlight. The firing in the north was mounting. Batteries of artillery had opened up. “Who is commanding there?” [MASK] pointed to the hills beyond the town.
<name>It</name>	It	Quieter	the war was over. [MASK] now. The lire was definitely slackening. 2:10. He sat patiently, his back to a tree. The attack would be soon enough. When he thought of that his mind closed down like a blank gray wall, not letting him see.
<name>Moll</name>	Moll	Kilrain	What matters is justice. ’Tis why I’m here. I’ll be treated as I deserve, not as my father deserved. I’m [MASK], and I God damn all gentlemen. I don’t know who me father was and I don’t give a damn.
<name>Chamberlain</name>	Chamberlain	Vincent	“That damn fool Sickles, you know him?” “Know of him.” Another shell passed close, fifty yards to the left, clipped a limb, ricocheted up through the leaves. [MASK] glanced that way, then back, went on.
<name>Wellington</name>	Wellington	Longstreet	[MASK] would not approve. But court-martial would have destroyed him. And he is spirited, and that is a great part of his value. Keep him on rein, but on a loose rein. He has to be checked now and then.
<name>Virgil</name>	Virgil	Hee	But mainly trying to figure ’em out. They were farm-type fellers. We asked them why they were fighting this war, thinkin’ on slavery and all, and one fella said they was fightin’ for their ‘rats.’ [MASK].
<name>McClellan</name>	McClellan	Heth	Now he could begin to hear rifle fire, the small sounds of infantry. He touched his chest, feeling a stuffiness there. So it was more than a duel of artillery. Yet [MASK] was not a fool.
<name>Art</name>	Art	Pete	He paused watchfully. “Of course I know that. But then, on the other hand, we sure do stomp them consistently, now don’t we, [MASK]? We ... I don’t know, but I feel we’re something special. I do.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Kilrain	He stood up. Pain in the right foot, unmistakable squish of blood in the boot. Didn’t know it was bleeding. See them come, bounding up the rocks, hitting the left flank. [MASK] moved by him on the right, knelt, fired.
<name>Reinhardt</name>	Reinhardt	Chamberlain	But the right flank was better, not so many casualties there. [MASK] moved, shifting men. And heard the assault coming, up the rocks, clawing up through the bushes, through the shattered trees, the pocked stone, the ripped and bloody earth.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Buford	He shuddered, waited. The first attack was very short: a ragged fire. [MASK] nodded, listening. “Yes. Tried to brush us off. Got a bloody nose. Now he’ll get angry, all puffed up like a partridge.
<name>Napoleon</name>	Napoleon	Napoleon	He looked out across the misty grove. “No matter. No matter. We end the war as best we can.” He put his hand to his chest. “[MASK] once said, ‘The logical end to defensive warfare is surrender.’
<name>Stuart</name>	Stuart	Hill	He blinked, saluting, wiping sweat from his eyes. He had never been impulsive, like [MASK]; there was even at this moment something grave and perplexed about him, a studious bewilderment. He had been the old army’s leading authority on the rifle; he had written a manual.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Longstreet	Ah.” He patted a saddlebag. “By which I mean, sir, to get to the heart of the matter, that I have a flagon of brandy at your disposal, should the occasion arise.” “It undoubtedly will. ” [MASK] bowed.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Colonel	“If ye’ll ride the horse today, [MASK], which the Lord hath provided, instead of walkin’ in the dust with the others fools, ye’ll be all right— if ye wear the hat. It’s the walkin’, do you see, that does the great harm.”
<name>Binet</name>	Binet	Reynolds	“Yes, sir.” “You saw him yourself?” The spy grinned, nodded, rubbed his nose, chuckled. “So close I could touch him. It was [MASK] all right.” “This morning.
<name>He</name>	He	Longstreet	and he knew the necessity for command and the old man in front of him was the finest commander he had ever known. [MASK] looked around at the faces. The gentlemen were chatting, telling lively funny stories. Out in the smoky night a band was mounting another song.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Trimble	and I will take that hill.’ And he said nothing; he just shook his head, and I threw my sword down.” [MASK] gestured helplessly, actually close to tears. “Down on the ground in front of him.” He raised both arms.
<name>Reilly</name>	Reilly	Glazier	[MASK]’s got the six hardheads in tow.” “Well, get all the names and start assigning them to different companies. I don’t want them bunched up, spread them out. See about their arms.” “Yes, sir, Colonel, sir.”
<name>Stonewall</name>	Stonewall	Lee	[MASK] rested both hands on the pommel of his saddle. The mist thickened and blew between them; there was a ghostly quality in the look of him, of all his staff, ghost riders out of the past, sabers clanking, horses breathing thick and heavy in thick dank air.
<name>Chamberlain</name>	Chamberlain	Vincent	[MASK] paused, looked back, saw the Regiment coming up the road, shook his head, violently. “That damn fool Sickles, you know him?” “Know of him.” Another shell passed close, fifty yards to the left, clipped a limb, ricocheted up through the leaves.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Fremantle	But if you’ll tell me where to stand.” “I will.” [MASK] whacked a mosquito. “Another victory today. When I am clear about it all I shall write it down. Expect you chaps are getting rather used to victory, what?
<name>Winters</name>	Winters	Marshall	“This evening.” [MASK], with effort, was keeping his voice down. “He was joyriding. For the fun of it. He captured about a hundred enemy wagons. And left us blind in enemy country. Criminal, absolutely criminal.
<name>Colonel</name>	Colonel	Longstreet	He should have more guns ready to move forward with the attack, keeping the flanks clear. It occurred to [MASK] that this was a grave responsibility. He interrupted himself, said suddenly, “How old are you, son?” “Sir?
<name>Steinbeck</name>	Steinbeck	Chamberlain	The man looked at his face, seemed suddenly embarrassed, realized he had gone too far. For the first time he was uncertain. But he repeated, “I done my share.” [MASK] nodded. The man was relaxing slowly.
<name>Stonewall</name>	Stonewall	Heth	All that while whenever he came near the line he could see enemy troops moving in the fields across the way, spreading out as they came down the road, like a gray river spreading where it reaches the sea. If [MASK] was efficient and deliberate he had the power to come straight through like an avalanche.
<name>Thrawn</name>	Thrawn	Lee	[MASK] said, “We don’t fear our own deaths, you and I.” He smiled slightly, then glanced away. “We protect ourselves out of military necessity, not fear. You, sir, do not protect yourself enough and must give thought to it.
<name>Longstreet</name>	Longstreet	Longstreet	We cannot let him work around behind us and cut us off from home. We must hit him now. We pushed him yesterday; he will remember it. The men are ready. I see no alternative.” “Yes, sir,” [MASK] said.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Ewell	But it was a victory. I am satisfied. The men fought well. This was your first day. It is not as easy as it sometimes appears.” “No, sir,” [MASK] said. “Now get some rest.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Pickett	Then was able to reach out and touch him. He just tapped him once lightly, one touch, on the shoulder, and pulled back his hand. Out in the camp in the light of the fire [MASK] was winding down.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Lee	[MASK]’s concentrating this way. Only one road down through the mountains; have to come this way. They will all converge here. In the morning. He turned in his stirrups, looked back at the high ground, the cemetery. The hills rose like watchtowers.
<name>She</name>	She	Buford	“Not at all.” He wheeled the horse gracefully, still something of that elegant quality of display in the fluid motion, and rode off. In the direction he took [MASK] heard music. A blue band was playing.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Buford	But he looked out across the town and he could see a great ocean of Rebel campfires, flooding the town, with fire burning all over those ridges to the west, flooding fire right up to the base of the hill. [MASK] took off his hat, looked up to the stars.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Buford	It was jammed with officers, all the brass. The anger made [MASK] dizzy. He tried to push his way through and the pain went all the way up his arm and into his chest and shocked him stiff.
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Johnston	We’re hitting them on the flank. If they see us coming they’ll have time to swing round their artillery and it’ll be a damn slaughter. So you take your time, Captain, but I don’t want us observed.” [MASK] saluted, his face strained.
<name>Stuart</name>	Stuart	Goree	After a moment he said, “You say there is cavalry moving on your right? In what force?” “Two brigades, at least.” “You have that from [MASK]?” “Yes, sir.”
<name>Stonewall</name>	Stonewall	Buford	He ordered a good feed for the night, no point now in saving food. They moved out to give their orders. [MASK] rode out once more, in the dark, to the picket line. He posted the lead pickets himself, not far from the Rebel line.
<name>Stuart</name>	Stuart	Gamble	He saw a squad of blue troopers, his own men, riding down into deserted streets. Still no sound of gunfire. [MASK] said, “That’s one whole brigade. At least one brigade.” “Do you see any cavalry?”
<name>Chamberlain</name>	Chamberlain	Buford	[MASK] rode out far enough to see the pickets for himself, then he rode back toward the green hills. He stopped by the Seminary and had a cup of coffee. The staff left him alone. After that he deployed the brigades.
<name>Stonewall</name>	Stonewall	Stuart	. He woke briefly. Without cavalry in the rear no victory would be complete. Should we attack before [MASK] comes? And if he comes with tired horses and weary men? If he comes at all . . . Don’t think on that.
<name>Longstreet</name>	Longstreet	Cavalry	If I move my people forward we’ll have no flank at all; they’ll simply swing around and crush us. There are thirty thousand men on those heights to our right. [MASK] is moving out on my flank now.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Tom	He stared at the boy in the darkness, felt an incredible love, reached out to touch him, stopped himself. [MASK] was saying, “I guess you got to hand it to them, the way they came up that hill.”
<name>Callan</name>	Callan	Longstreet	The old man was gazing silently ahead into the rising dust. “It troubles me sometimes,” [MASK] said. His mind rang a warning, but he went on grimly, as you ride over rocks. “They’re never quite the enemy, those boys in blue.”
<name>Connell</name>	Connell	Chamberlain	[MASK] did not return it. He looked past the Captain at the men, most of whom had their heads down. But there were eyes on him. He looked back and forth down the line, looking for a familiar face. That would help.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Armistead	It was sunken into the field, choked like the bed of a stream with mounded men. [MASK] jumped down, saw a boy in front of him, kneeling, crying, a row of men crouched under the far bank, an officer yelling, pounding with the flat of his sword.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Fremantle	“A little eccentricity is a help to a general. It helps with the newspapers. The women love it too. Southern women like their men religious and a little mad. That’s why they fall in love with preachers.” [MASK] was not following.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Armistead	[MASK] was saying, “That Fremantle is kind of funny. He said that we Southerners were the most polite people he’d ever met, but then he noticed we all of us carry guns all the time, wherever we went, and he figured that maybe that was why.
<name>Colonel</name>	Colonel	Chamberlain	When he came to the part about men who failed to do their duty being punished by instant death, it embarrassed him. The men looked up at him with empty faces. [MASK] read the order and added nothing, went off by himself to sit down.
<name>Macomber</name>	Macomber	Kilrain	Would the Colonel care to see him?” “Lead on.” [MASK] walked down a grassy slope away from the road, across the soft field, marshy with heavy rain, up a rise of granite to a gathering of boulders along the edge of a grove of dark trees.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Chamberlain	[MASK] said, “Well of course, sir. But the boys are tired. May take a while. And I sure need that ammunition.” “Right. I’ll tell the General you’ll be up soon as possible.”
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Kilrain	“Oh yes.” [MASK] nodded. “He would definitely do that.” “But then he pointed out that he could not apologize for his views, because they were honestly held. And I had to see he was right there.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Chamberlain	[MASK] grunted. He was really tired. Rest a moment. He paused with his hands on the saddle hom. There was a new vague doubt stirring in his brain. Something troubled him; he did not know why.
<name>Stonewall</name>	Stonewall	Longstreet	He will arrive strung out and tired, piece by piece. If we concentrate we can hit him as he comes up. If we ruin one or two corps we can even the odds.” He was again breathless, but he bent over the map. [MASK] said nothing.
<name>Rawlinson</name>	Rawlinson	Hood	No more damn fool counter-marches in the morning. Take most of the night but get it clear, get it clear. I’ve got [MASK]’s Division posted on our right flank. Or what’s left of it.
<name>Quiller</name>	Quiller	Buford	Probably not for a while. But they had great fishing there. Black bass rising in flat black water: ah. Shame to go there again, to foreign ground. Strange sense of enormous loss. [MASK] did not hate. He was a professional.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Lee	But nobody there at all. And the Federals running, no guns set up, nothing but one battery and one regiment in line.” He was running out of breath. [MASK] had stopped to listen. He sensed, among the anger, the bitter breath of truth.
<name>Ansley</name>	Ansley	Lee	“And I believe it was warmer. Yes, it was undoubtedly warmer.” “That was a good outfit. There were some very good men in that outfit.” “Yes,” [MASK] said. “Some of them are up ahead now, waiting for us.”
<name>Traven</name>	Traven	Jackson	The men refused to fire at him, that man had been brave, he deserved to live. [MASK] said, *7 don’t want them brave, I want them dead.” “They tell many stories of the man. I regret not having known him.”
<name>Drake</name>	Drake	Longstreet	Sir, you would be considered most welcome in my country, a most distinguished visitor.” There was firing below, a sharp popping, a scattering of shots, a bunch, another bunch, then silence. [MASK] put on his glasses, looked down into the valley.
<name>Wellington</name>	Wellington	Stuart	To pull this army with all its trains back through that pass. Without cavalry, it cannot be done. [MASK], I have waited long enough. He thanked the men for their day’s work, told them to get a good night’s rest.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Chamberlain	In a few moments several men died near where [MASK] was standing. One boy was hit in the head and the wound seemed so bloody it had to be fatal, but the boy sat up and shook his head and bound up the wound himself with a handkerchief and went back to firing.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Chamberlain	Forty to fifty already dead, about ninety wounded. Lot of boys walking around with minor stuff, one hundred thirty for the hospital.” [MASK] thought: one hundred thirty down. We had three hundred in line.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Longstreet	What was left was a permanent weariness. A voice in [MASK] said: let the old man alone. But there had been too much death; it was time for reality. He said slowly, “I don’t think we can win it now.”
<name>Charnock</name>	Charnock	Longstreet	He was wearing the same tall gray hat and the remarkable coat. He said cheerily, tapping the great hat, “Don’t mean to intrude upon your thoughts, General.” “Not ’t’all,” [MASK] said. “Really, sir, if you’d rather ride alone ...”
<name>Chamberlain</name>	Chamberlain	Lee	He will not move quickly.” [MASK] put his hand to his face. He looked toward the hill and saw the broken Union corps falling back up the slope. He felt only one urge: to press on and get it done. He said nothing, turning away.
<name>He</name>	He	Chamberlain	The move was so quick he could not believe it. Men were turning and running. Some were stopping to fire. There was the yellow flash and then they turned. [MASK] saw a man drop a rifle and run. Another.
<name>MacArthur</name>	MacArthur	Joshuway	Mind of West Point at work. No time to threaten a man. Not now. Men cannot be threatened into the kind of fight they will have to put up to win. They will have to be led. By you, [MASK], by you.
<name>Winters</name>	Winters	Sorrell	Came through that picket line in the dark and all. 1 don’t know if you realize, General—” [MASK] said coldly, “Sir, don’t you think, if this man’s story was true, that we would have heard something?"
<name>Miles</name>	Miles	Longstreet	“Major, I need something to eat.” “To eat, sir? Of course, sir. What would you like, sir?” “Marching food," [MASK] said, “I don’t give a damn what.”
<name>He</name>	He	Chamberlain	He rode past a house, slowed to let the men flow round it, saw a fat woman in a bonnet, a gray dress, standing on the porch, her hands in her apron. She extracted one hand, waved slowly, silently. [MASK] bowed.
<name>Forrest</name>	Forrest	Longstreet	This fighting is very hard on the horses, sir. I was hoping we could get a new supply up here, but these Yankee horses are just farm stock—too big, too slow. Man would look ridiculous on a plow horse.” “Well,” [MASK] grumbled vaguely.
<name>Malachi</name>	Malachi	Lee	He could not do that. Each man would make his own decision, but [MASK] could not raise his hand against his own. And so what then? To stand by and watcn, observer at the death? To do nothing? To wait until the war was over?
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Lee	Like all of [MASK]’s aides he had too much to do and had slept little in the last two days and he was nearing exhaustion. He reported, speech blurred. “Sir, I think I’ve, ah, pieced it together.
<name>Who</name>	Who	Hancock	He says they’ll come again one more time and we ought to be right here waiting.” “He says they’ll come again? [MASK]?” “Yep.” “Where did he say they’d come?”
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Kilrain	How you doin’? You old mick.” [MASK] peered at him vaguely cheerily. His face had a linen softness. “They couldn’t seem hardly to miss,” he said regretfully, apologizing. “Twice, would you believe.
<name>Cholmondeley</name>	Cholmondeley	Lee	“One thing I’m very glad to see. Your General [MASK] is a moralist, as are all true gentlemen, of course, but he respects minor vice, harmless vice, when he finds it in others. Now that’s the mark of the true gentleman.
<name>Manolin</name>	Manolin	Longstreet	The white head bent down over the papers. [MASK] stood there. All his life he had taken orders and he knew the necessity for command and the old man in front of him was the finest commander he had ever known.
<name>voices</name>	voices	Tozier	He heard [MASK] behind him: “Dress it up, dress it up,” a muffled complaint, whispers, the far sound of hoofs pawing the ground. His own horse stood quietly, neck down, nibbling Pennsylvania grass.
<name>Stebbins</name>	Stebbins	Tom	“The thing was, damn, we had these here ’noculations. You ever been ’noculated?” The man swore eamesdy. [MASK] nodded. “Well, then, you know. Only thing was, we wound up sick, half the dang regiment.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Hood	Take care of yourself.” [MASK] took the hand, held it for a moment. Sometimes you touched a man like this and it was the last time, and the next time you saw him he was cold and white and bloodless, and the warmth was gone forever.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Lee	Very little of a man is in a hand or a leg. A man is in his spirit and he has that in full no matter what part of his body dies, or all of it. But, [MASK] thought, you may not understand.
<name>Alvaro</name>	Alvaro	Ewell	“General,” [MASK] said. His face was not clear in the evening light, the lamplight from inside, the moon from the heavens, but there was a sadness in his voice, regret apparent in the motion of his head, the beak above the wild mustache bobbing.
<name>MacArthur</name>	MacArthur	Lee	He was thinking: [MASK] has made up his mind; there’s nothing you can do. Well. Then there will be a scrap. He took a deep breath. Ought to get something to eat. “General?”
<name>Pepe</name>	Pepe	Armistead	It was the first time in [MASK]’s life he had ever really known a man would die. Always before there was at least a chance, but here no chance at all, and now the man was his oldest friend.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Hill	There is one thing you can do. You can resign now. You can refuse to lead it. But I cannot even do that. Cannot leave the man alone. Cannot leave him with that attack in the hands of [MASK].
<name>Chamberlain</name>	Chamberlain	Chamberlain	[MASK] dizzy in the smoke began to lose track of events, saw only blurred images of smoke and death, Tozier with the flag, great black gaps in the line, the left flank giving again, falling back, tightening.
<name>Forrest</name>	Forrest	Longstreet	“I’d like your opinion, sir. You are the second-ranking officer in this army. Do you believe that these court-martial papers should be signed?” [MASK] paused. Men were closing in, yelling more congratulations.
<name>Timothy</name>	Timothy	Fremantle	[MASK], who did not know what to expect, started, gulped, stared. But he was delighted. He saw puffs of white smoke start up down in the valley, like vents in the earth, blow slowly lazily to his left, to the north.
