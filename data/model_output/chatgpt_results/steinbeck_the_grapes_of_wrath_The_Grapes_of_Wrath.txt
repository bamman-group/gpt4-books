<name>George</name>	George	Mae	The other whispered some soft message and then they straightened their arms so that their clenched fists in the overall pockets showed through the thin blue cloth. [MASK] opened a drawer and took out a long waxpaper-wrapped loaf. “This here is a fifteen-cent loaf.”
<name>Noah</name>	Noah	Truck	“What about it? We won’t be here.” “We got to be here. [MASK]’s here. Take a week to get the water out of her when the flood goes down.” “Well—what’s your idear?”
<name>Sodapop</name>	Sodapop	Joad	“I got too much to puzzle with.” He drew up his feet and clasped his legs. He threw back his head and looked at the sharp stars. [MASK] yawned and brought one hand back under his head.
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Casy	“We was lucky,” he said. “Got a flashlight, too. Gonna fix her right up.” “You forgot to take your dinner,” said [MASK]. “I’ll get it when I finish.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Lo	“ ’[MASK]!” “Looks like you was playin’ mushrat.” “Well, I was.” He edged gradually away toward the bank; he moved casually, and then he leaped out, gathered his clothes with a sweep of his arms, and was gone among the willows.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Jule	“These the ones?” “Sure,” said [MASK]. “Went right up an’ started it. But they didn’ even swing once.” “Let’s look at ’em.” The prisoners were swung around to face him. Their heads were down.
<name>Jem</name>	Jem	Rosasharn	“[MASK],” she said sternly, “you git upright. You jus’ been mopin’ enough. They’s a ladies’ committee a-comin’, an’ the fambly ain’t gonna be frawny3 when they get here.”
<name>Louise</name>	Louise	Mae	And as the huge truck came heavily down from the highway and parked, [MASK] seized her cloth and wiped the whole length of the counter. And she took a few swipes at the gleaming coffee urn too, and turned up the bottle-gas under the urn.
<name>Candy</name>	Candy	Jessie	“I even took a bath.” “That’s what they’re for,” [MASK] said. “An’ they’s the same rule. You got to leave ’em clean. Ever’ week they’s a new committee to swab out oncet a day.
<name>Veronica</name>	Veronica	Cora	Bumpers torn loose and hanging. Fancy Ford roadster with little colored lights at fender guide, at radiator cap, and three behind. Mud aprons, and a big die on the gear-shift lever. Pretty girl on tire cover, painted in color and named [MASK].
<name>Webster</name>	Webster	Guy	That proboscis is a nose-like. With a elephant it’s his trunk. [MASK] showed me in a dictionary. Carried that dictionary all over hell with him. He’d look in it while he’s pulled up gettin’ his pie an’ coffee.”
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Herb	“Drunk at a dance. I don’ know how she started. An’ then I felt that knife go in me, an’ that sobered me up. Fust thing I see is [MASK] cornin’ for me again with his knife.
<name>Louise</name>	Louise	Al	Don’t burn her up, [MASK]." They drove on through the sunny morning fields. The mist lifted from the hilltops and they were clear and brown, with black-purple creases. The wild doves flew up from the fences as the truck passed.
<name>Candy</name>	Candy	Tom	“Might git stopped.” [MASK] lifted up one side of his cave. In the dimness of the truck the pots jangled. “I can pull her down quick,” he said. “ ’Sides, I don’ like gettin’ trapped in here.”
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	A1	[MASK] was gonna grind the valves, but he’s too busy messin’ aroun’ to get down to her. We’ll have maybe a hunderd an’ fifty when we start. Damn ol’ tires on this here truck ain’t gonna go far.
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	Huston	[MASK] nodded. “You done good,” he said. And now the dusk was falling, and as the darkness deepened the practicing of the string band seemed to grow louder. The fights flashed on and two men inspected the patched wire to the dance floor.
<name>Crazy Horse</name>	Crazy Horse	Geronimo--1	And they listened while the tales were told, and their participation made the stories great. I was a recruit against [MASK] And the people listened, and their quiet eyes reflected the dying fire. Them Injuns was cute—slick as snakes, an’ quiet when they wanted.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Wilson	Here’s all us eatin’, an’ got to buy gas an’ oil. ’F we run outa money, I don’ know what we gonna do.” [MASK] said, “Seems like it’s my fault.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	“These here is our own people, all of ’em,” [MASK] said. “I don’ like this.” Suddenly the leading policemen turned off the road into a wide graveled entrance. The old cars whipped after them. The motorcycles roared their motors.
<name>George</name>	George	Tom	Tell ’em they’re starvin’ us an’ stabbin’ theirself in the back. ’Cause sure as cowflops she’ll drop to two an’ a half jus’ as soon as they clear us out.” “I’ll tell ’em,” said [MASK].
<name>Greaser</name>	Greaser	Okie	Now it means you’re a dirty son-of-a-bitch. [MASK] means you’re scum. Don’t mean nothing itself, it’s the way they say it. But I can’t tell you nothin’. You got to go there.
<name>Steve</name>	Steve	Timothy	A truckload of men went by, and each man was sunk into himself. Each man braced himself in the truck bed and scowled down. “Goin’ out for the Gas Company,” [MASK] said. “They got a nice job of it.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Joad	It came to a place between and behind the two, and then it sat down, and its tail stretched out straight and flat to the floor, and the last inch of it flicked. The cat sat and looked off into the distance where the men were looking. [MASK] glanced around at it.
<name>Jody</name>	Jody	Tom	They reached for the fruit and dropped them in the buckets. [MASK] ran at his work. One bucket full, two buckets. He dumped them in a box. Three buckets. The box was full. “I jus’ made a nickel,” he called.
<name>Mandy</name>	Mandy	Ever’body	If we all work, purty soon we’ll live in a nice house. We all got to help.” “But I got so tar’d.” “I know. I got tar’d too. [MASK] gets wore out. Got to think about other stuff.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Casy	[MASK] put his chin down on his hands. “Maybe I can’t tell you,” he said. “Maybe you got to find out. Where’s your cap?” “I come out without it.” “How’s your sister?”
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Sack	Finger-wise. Inquisitive fingers snick in and out and find the bolls. Hardly have to look. Bet I could pick cotton if I was blind. Got a feelin’ for a cotton boll. Pick clean, clean as a whistle. [MASK]’s full now.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Granma	“Before they stopped us las’ night.” “So that’s why you didn’ want ’em to look.” “I was afraid we wouldn’ get acrost,” she said. “I tol’ [MASK] we couldn’ he’p her.
<name>Black Elk</name>	Black Elk	Casy	Between his guards [MASK] sat proudly, his head up and the stringy muscles of his neck prominent. On his lips there was a faint smile and on his face a curious look of conquest. When the deputies had gone, the people came out of the tents.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Al	You jus’ as soon?” “Sure. I’ll stay.” [MASK] took a paper bag from the seat. “This here’s some bread an’ meat Ma sent, an’ I got a jug a water here.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jule	Three young men were coming through the gate—young working men in jeans. They walked close together. The guard at the gate questioned them, and they answered and passed through. “Look at ’em careful,” [MASK] said. He moved to the guard.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Tommy	[MASK], looking at her, gradually drooped his eyelids, until just a short glitter showed through his lashes. “Many folks feel that way?” he demanded. “I don’ know. They’re jus’ kinda stunned. Walk aroun’ like they was half asleep.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Joad	The kitchen was empty of furniture, stove gone and the round stovepipe hole in the wall showing light. On the sink shelf lay an old beer opener and a broken fork with its wooden handle gone. [MASK] slipped cautiously into the room, and the floor groaned under his weight.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Floyd	His companion remained seated. Now all the squatting men looked at the newcomers and the conversation was still. And the women building their fires looked secretly at the shiny car. The children moved closer with elaborate circuitousness, edging inward in long curves. [MASK] put down his wrench.
<name>Crooks</name>	Crooks	Muley	“Let her get good an’ done, good an’ brown, awmost black,” said [MASK] irritably. “I wanta talk. I ain’t talked to nobody. If I’m touched, I’m touched, an’ that’s the end of it.
<name>Betty</name>	Betty	Tom	Want ya to look over the guys when they come in, an’ try to spot ’em. You’ll be with another fella. Then later I want ya to dance an’ watch.” “Yeah! I can do that awright,” said [MASK].
<name>winter</name>	winter	Rosasham	“I ain’t watchin’ this here fambly starve no more. One day’ more grease. That’s what we got. Come time for [MASK] to lay in, she got to be fed up. You figger!”
<name>Candy</name>	Candy	Tom	He comes in here in the day an’ lays down sometimes.” She walked to the line and began to drape pale blue jeans and blue shirts and long gray underwear over the wire. Behind him [MASK] heard a shuffling step, and he turned to look in.
<name>Mae</name>	Mae	Timothy	And if they ever find out I told, I won’t have a farm next year.” “I jus’ don’t know what to say,” [MASK] said. “If they was agitators, I can see why they was mad.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	[MASK] went to the tool shed and brought what tools were left to go, a hand saw and a set of wrenches, a hammer and a box of assorted nails, a pair of pliers and a flat file and a set of rat-tail files.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Casy	“Well—I guess, well—I’m jus’ goin’ past.” “Know anybody here?” “No. I tell you I was jus’ goin’ past.” A head stuck out of the tent. A voice said, “What’s the matter?” “[MASK]!”
<name>Candy</name>	Candy	Floyd	[MASK] sounded hurt. “I’m jus’ givin’ you the tip. You don’ have to take it. Your brother here he’ped me, an’ I’m givin’ you the tip.” “You sure there ain’t no work here?”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Mae	They’ll drink a five-cent soda and crab that it ain’t cold enough. The woman will use six paper napkins and drop them on the floor. The man will choke and try to put the blame on [MASK].
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Rosasham	An’ then things ain’t lonely any more. An’ then a hurt don’t hurt so bad, ’cause it ain’t a lonely hurt no more, [MASK]. I wisht I could tell you so you’d know, but I can’t.”
<name>Caller</name>	Caller	Tom	The dancers scrambled to their feet and new dancers plunged forward for partners. [MASK] stood near the three young men. He saw them force their way through, out on the floor, toward one of the forming squares.
<name>The truck</name>	The truck	Le	Well, that’s somepin you got to think about. We got tube patches. Maybe when she goes she’ll only spring a leak. How about makin’ a boot? Might get five hunderd more miles. [MASK]’s go on till she blows.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Tom	Come dost.” He crawled near. Her reaching hand found his head in the blackness and her fingers moved down to his nose, and then over his left cheek. “You got a bad scar, [MASK]. An’ your nose is all crooked.”
<name>George</name>	George	Tom	he asked. “Yeah, I got it. But I’m gonna need it. I can’t set it out jus’ for sleepin’.” “Well, we all got to make a livin’.” “Yeah,” [MASK] said.
<name>Rider</name>	Rider	Tommy	“Easy, [MASK]. You done good once. You can do it again.” “Yeah, an’ after a while I won’t have no decency lef’.” “Easy,” she said. “You got to have patience.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Al	[MASK] turned right on a graveled road, and the yellow lights shuddered over the ground. The fruit trees were gone now, and cotton plants took their place. They drove on for twenty miles through the cotton, turning, angling on the country roads.
<name>Old Man Gower</name>	Old Man Gower	Hooper	Things get a little quiet, we can always stir ’em up a little.” “Have trouble when they cut the rate here, I guess.” “We sure will. No, you needn’ worry about us havin’ work—not while [MASK]’s snubbin’ close.”
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Willy	That worries me. I can see how a fella might come from some other place an’ not know no better, but [MASK] belongs. Worried me so I went up to ’im and ast ’im. Right off he got mad.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Eyes	He throwed it away an’ he leaned in the door. [MASK] kinda dull. He says, ‘Thank you, sir,’ an’ he went on. I never seen no drinkin’ like that in my life.” “Went on? Which way?
<name>Grandpa</name>	Grandpa	Joad	The yellowing, dusty, afternoon light put a golden color on the land. The cornstalks looked golden. A flight of swallows swooped overhead toward some waterhole. The turtle in [MASK]’s coat began a new campaign of escape.
<name>Mammy</name>	Mammy	Muley	They kicked the cotton plants as they went. “You’ll be hidin’ from lots of stuff,” said [MASK]. They marched in single file across the fields. They came to a water-cut and slid easily down to the bottom of it.
<name>Unknown</name>	Unknown	Hawley	The families climbed down and went to join the waiting group, and more cars came in from the road and parked, and more families joined the group. Under the light on the bam end, the owner signed them in. “[MASK]?” he said.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Tom	He stood out front an’ he dropped his hat an’ stepped on it. Here, I got his hat here.” He brought the dusty broken hat from under the counter. [MASK] took it from him. “That’s him, all right.”
<name>Curley's</name>	Curley's	Winfiel	“[MASK]’, get out from under foot.” She pushed him out of her way. “Got ta make us up a little stew,” she said. “We ain’t et nothin’ cooked right sence we come from home.
<name>Joad</name>	Joad	A1	“Yes, I’m a-comin’.” “You don’t look so good.” “I ain’t so good, but I’m cornin’.” [MASK] got in the truck. “Have to get gas,” he said.
<name>Ned</name>	Ned	Casy	“Stroke,” said [MASK]. “A good quick stroke.” Life began to move again. The sun touched the horizon and flattened over it. And along the highway there came a long line of huge freight trucks with red sides.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	[MASK] took off his cloth cap, dirty now, and ruinous, the visor pointed as a bird’s beak. He turned the sweat band out and removed a long strip of folded newspaper. “Sweat so much she’s shrank,” he said.
<name>Casy</name>	Casy	Tom	A circle of quiet children stood to watch the new family get settled, quiet children with bare feet and dirty faces. [MASK] said, “Back home some fellas come through with han’bills—orange ones. Says they need lots a people out here to work the crops.”
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Willie	They neared the fence. Two of the seated guards stood up and moved over. “Got some fellas goin’ home early,” said [MASK]. The three men climbed over the fence and disappeared into the darkness. And the squad moved quickly back toward the dance floor.
<name>Sal</name>	Sal	Tom	He filled the radiator, begged a map, and studied it. The service-station boy, in his white uniform, seemed uneasy until the bill was paid. He said, “You people sure have got nerve.” [MASK] looked up from the map.
<name>Candy</name>	Candy	Tom	This here boy been married to that there little digger.” [MASK] said, “I put in time (umph). Yes, sir, I sure did (umph). Put in my years (umph!). Kinda like the feel (umph!).
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Committee	“He was drunk last Sat’dy night. Sung in his tent all night. [MASK] give him work for it.” They walked along the edge of the oiled road; a row of walnut trees grew beside the way. The sun shoved its edge over the mountains.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Ruthie	You’re jus’ a little smarty liar.’ An’ [MASK] said, Oh, yeah? Well, our brother’s a-hidin’ right now from killin’ a fella, an’ he can kill that big girl’s brother too.
<name>George</name>	George	Pa.	I got a han’bill says they got good wages, an’ little while ago I seen a thing in the paper says they need folks to pick fruit.” The ragged man turned to [MASK] “You got any place to go, back home?”
<name>the proprietor</name>	the proprietor	Tom	Car’s out in the road.” “He came in a car,” said the proprietor. “Ever’body’d leave their car out there an’ come in an’ use my place for nothin’.” [MASK] said, “We’ll drive along the road.
<name>Jem</name>	Jem	Winfield	“Don’t you make no noise now. Ma won’t let us watch. If she looks this-a-way, you scrunch down behin’ the brush. Then we’ll see.” “There ain’t many kids seen it,” [MASK] said.
<name>George</name>	George	Huston	“So they knowed your name.” “Sure. I worked right beside ’em.” “Awright,” [MASK] said. “Don’t you go near ’em. We ain’t gonna th’ow ’em out if they’re nice.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Joad	Sure, I know you’re wettin’ your pants to know what I done. I ain’t a guy to let you down.” The high hum of the motor dulled and the song of the tires dropped in pitch. [MASK] got out his pint and took another short drink.
<name>Uncas</name>	Uncas	Jes	Knowed we couldn’ shoot. [MASK]’ laid there with the rifles cocked, an’ didn’ even put ’em to our shoulders. Lookin’ at him. Head-band, one feather. Could see it, an’ naked as the sun.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Muley	“Here, take one end, [MASK]. Wrap your end around that stake. That’s good, now! Let’s tighten her up. We ought to wait till the fire’s burned down, but I can’t wait.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Tom	He squirmed away under the car, loosening the bolts with a wrench and turning them out with his fingers. He left the bolts on each end loosely threaded to keep the pan from dropping. “Ground’s still hot under here,” [MASK] said.
<name>George</name>	George	Tom	They called, “How’s the swimmin’P” “Dunno,” said [MASK]. “We ain’t tried none. Sure feels good to set here, though.” “Mind if we come in an’ set?” “She ain’t our river.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Las	The girl sneered. “Oh, him! He was a-braggin’. High an’ mighty. If he don’t have no supper—know what he done? [MASK]’ night, come out an’ says they got chicken to eat.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	A1	[MASK] grew tense over the wheel. A little rattle had developed in the engine. He speeded up and the rattle increased. He retarded his spark and listened, and then he speeded up for a moment and listened. The rattle increased to a metallic pounding.
<name>John</name>	John	Tom	He pushed up his cap and stepped into the ditch. Then he spat on his hands. The pick arose into the air and flashed down. [MASK] grunted softly. The pick rose and fell, and the grunt came at the moment it sank into the ground and loosened the soil.
<name>Old Man Warner</name>	Old Man Warner	Willy	“Me knockin’ [MASK] over an’ takin’ a shot at the lights once-twice keeps ’em careful. They ain’t sure who it is, an’ I ain’t gonna let ’em catch me. I don’t sleep near no house.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	“Run out of my uncle,” said [MASK]. “Or he run out, or something.” The gray man looked puzzled and worried at the same time. He touched the tip of his nose tenderly and waggled it around to stop an itch.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sairy	“Come in,” she said. “I like to talk to ya.” “That’s a good big girl you got,” said [MASK]. “She’s right in peelin’ potatoes. What can I do to help?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Grampa	Your way was fixed an’ [MASK] didn’ have no part in it. He didn’ suffer none. Not after fust thing this mornin’. He’s jus’ stayin’ with the lan’. He couldn’ leave it.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Joe	Roll up your sleeves, [MASK]. Go out an’ soften ’em, an’ send ’em in to me. You get twenty on that last deal. You ain’t doing bad. Limp flags in the afternoon sun. Today’s Bargain. ’
<name>Uncle John</name>	Uncle John	Grampa	[MASK] stopped and he stopped the others. His little eyes glittered with malice. “Lookut him,” he said. “A jailbird. Ain’t been no Joads in jail for a hell of a time.” His mind jumped.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Tom	I was in that there water. An’ I ain’t a-gonna leave her. I’m a-gonna go now, [MASK]—down the river. I’ll catch fish an’ stuff, but I can’t leave her. I can’t.”
<name>The man</name>	The man	Joad	“Yes, sir!” he said. “Yes, sir!” [MASK] took the bottle from him, and in politeness did not wipe the neck with his sleeve before he drank. He squatted on his hams and set the bottle upright against his coat roll.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Tom	“HoF out ya han’, [MASK]. I ain’t gonna sleep none if you got no money. Maybe you got to take a bus, or somepin. I want you should go a long ways off, three-four hunderd miles.”
<name>Crooks</name>	Crooks	Jule	“No,” said [MASK]. “Jes’ half. Wisht I was a full-blood. I’d have my lan’ on the reservation. Them full-bloods got it pretty nice, some of ’em.”
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Joe	Fine big mules—five and seven years old. Maybe we better look around. Look around! You come in when we’re busy, an’ take up our time an’ then walk out! [MASK], did you know you was talkin’ to pikers?
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Tom	[MASK] stepped into the water and felt the bottom drop from under his feet. He threshed the two strokes across the ditch and pulled himself heavily up the other bank. His clothes clung to him. He moved and made a slopping noise; his shoes squished.
<name>Hazel</name>	Hazel	Joad	[MASK]’s eyes dropped to the ground, as though he could not meet the naked honesty in the preacher’s eyes. “You can’t hold no church with idears like that,” he said. “People would drive you out of the country with idears like that.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Al	“Number three’s ready to pay off,” said [MASK]. He went to the third slot machine and played his nickels in, and on the fifth spin of the wheels the three bars came up and the jack pot dumped out into the cup.
<name>her husband</name>	her husband	Connie	She was all secrets now she was pregnant, secrets and little silences that seemed to have meanings. She was pleased with herself, and she complained about things that didn’t really matter. And she demanded services of [MASK] that were silly, and both of them knew they were silly.
<name>John</name>	John	Tom	It ain’t the first fella you killed, neither.” Her face was growing red with hysteria. Her words blurred. “I don’ wanta look at you.” She covered her head with her blanket. [MASK] heard the choked, smothered cries.
<name>Jim Casy</name>	Jim Casy	Casy	“I can’t put my finger on her. I got an itch that somepin’s wronger’n hell. Just this house pushed aroun’ an’ my folks gone.” [MASK] said, “Right over there the ditch was, where I done the baptizin’.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Iom	Can’t check that one. Put ’em in easy or you’re working for nothing.” “Why—goddamn it---------” “Now go easy. I warned you before you started.” '[MASK]’s eyes drooped sullenly. “O.K.,” he said.
<name>Biff</name>	Biff	Joad	“You’re all wound up,” said [MASK]. “What’s the matter—got a girl?” “Well, sure. But I want to get ahead anyway. I been training my mind for a hell of a long time.”
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Muley	“I ain’t gonna sleep in no cave,” he said. “I’m gonna sleep right here.” He rolled his coat and put it under his head. [MASK] pulled at the covering brush and crawled into his cave.
<name>George</name>	George	Tom	“Well, no, not money right off. But you can get credit at the store for what you got coming.” “Come on, let’s hurry,” [MASK] said. “I wanta get some meat an’ bread in me tonight.
