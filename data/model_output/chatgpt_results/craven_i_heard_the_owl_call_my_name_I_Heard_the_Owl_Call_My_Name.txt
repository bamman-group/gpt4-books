<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Peter	“[MASK], what is it? What is this unease that is now in the village?" and the old man looked at him long and carefully before answering. "It is always so when the young come back from the school.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Peter	the vicar asked, and [MASK] told him he was going to fill the canoe with water and drop into it hot rocks to make the wood expand to the cedar stretchers, and when this was done, he would singe the bottom. They were polite and this was all.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Jim	When the elder introduced it, [MASK] translated his words: “A little boy went to the woods to snare grouse and he was sure he had caught one because he could feel it pulling and jerking. But each time he lost it, and thought someone had taken it.
<name>she</name>	she	Keetah	When the rains have ceased, the men of the family will build his house, and when he and [MASK] are married, we will give them a fine wedding with the canoes moving up and down the river bringing the guests, and all the houses of the village filled, and a great wedding feast.”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Mark	“[MASK], I cannot come home again. I have changed too much. It is my mind that has changed. I can never come home again." “Someday you will be able to live in both 124 I ”»AHn THE OWL CALL MY NAME worlds.
<name>TWENTY</name>	TWENTY	Jim	Did you know?” “Yes." “And does this change you?” “A child is always welcome,” [MASK] said. “When I marry her, her child will be mine." TWENTY
<name>John</name>	John	Mark	Then the skies cleared, the sun shone, the weather turned suddenly warm, and the mosquitoes and the “no-seeums” emerged in hungry swarms. August was a month of worry and waiting. Every time [MASK] went on patrol to the other villages, he returned filled with anxiety.
<name>Old Misery</name>	Old Misery	Mark	At night the boys slept on the floor, and at meals in the galley [MASK] drilled them in the little amenities of the big wide world: “May I have another glass of milk, please?—Would you pass the bread, please?—Excuse me.—I beg your
<name>Brian</name>	Brian	Mark	It was very cold on the river, as it was always bitterly cold on the river in the winter. [MASK] could feel the wind biting through his parka, and because the tide was wrong, they grounded and had to pull the boat over a sandbar.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Keetah	“To come home, [MASK]?” “Yes, to come home to the village I love. It Is the same. I am not. I have seen how the white man treats his woman. He shares his pleasures and even his work.
<name>Mr. Beebe</name>	Mr. Beebe	Mark	I’ll get my things." “I’ll help you,” and they scrambled through [MASK]’s gear that had been piled on the porch of the vicarage until they found a cassock and his Book of Common Prayer.
<name>Maria</name>	Maria	Keetah	“Yes.” “When I am no longer in the village, take care of [MASK]. When you want coffee, don’t bang on the table. Say please and when she hands you the cup, say thank you. You’ll find it most efficacious."
<name>Santiago</name>	Santiago	Caleb	Already he had begun to think of the boat as he thought of his own arms and legs, an extension of himself. [MASK] had told him how frequently a fisherman lost a boat because he was too busy with the catch to check its bilge.
<name>St. Francis</name>	St. Francis	Lad	“I hitched a ride, and do you know what these sinners did? They passed a resolution behind my back that any guest who complained about the food should be automatically elected cook. Then they served me the worst lunch I ever ate in my life. [MASK], save me.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sam	Soon, of course, while he was green and before the Bishop had a chance to warn him. [MASK] was descended from slaves and in the old days to be a slave was to be worse than a nothing. He had no pride. His boats burned under him.
<name>Someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Mark	In gratitude they turned it into a myth, and if you look out the window into the rain, you will see the Cedar-man at the bottom of the great totem holding up the crests of this tribe.’ [MASK] refilled the coffee cups.
<name>Manuel</name>	Manuel	Mark	At dawn the old hand-logger sighed deeply and was done. Then [MASK] covered the body with a blanket and returned to the boat to catch the first weather report, which promised that by noon the straits might be navigable.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Mark	I want to meet him.” “There is only one stranger. He is with the men from the forestry boat who are friends of the tribe.” But in the flickering light of the fire and the lanterns [MASK] could not see clearly the face.
<name>Ichabod</name>	Ichabod	Peter	In the night in the last house next to the old burial ground old [MASK], the carver, heard a flight of wild geese pass over the village, honking loudly, and he counted the seconds of their passage as was his custom. But it was not a huge migration.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Mark	The younger children we will care for here, and the new one also. Your mother wanted you to get an education. I told her I would help you.” The next morning [MASK] stepped from the vicarage into the first lovely day of summer.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Jim	Then [MASK] put on his gum boots, undid the line, climbed into the boat and started the outboard motor, and he was off to the mouth of the river without a word. While he was gone, the young vicar worked on the boat.
<name>Timothy</name>	Timothy	Sam	In the poorest house [MASK], the unlucky one, considered how best to approach the new vicar for a loan. Soon, of course, while he was green and before the Bishop had a chance to warn him.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Keetah	You have been afraid I would not approve because you have returned to the village. Is that not it? Oh, [MASK], do you trust me so little?” And he sat down in the first pew and she beside him, but it was a long time before she spoke.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Mark	“What’s the matter?” "They belong to a southern tribe. We do not know them. We have never had anything to do with them.” [MASK] took his examinations to handle the boat alone.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Mark	On the three-hour trip to the float store, they took turns at the wheel. Once the Bishop left the cabin and [MASK] could hear him in the galley banging the pots and pans. When he returned he carried a plate of sandwiches and two mugs of coffee.
<name>she</name>	she	Jim	He knew it must have been written before he and [MASK] had started north, and he was afraid to read it “I am sure," wrote the Bishop, “that when you receive this, you will be aware that the old vicarage must be replaced.
<name>Simon</name>	Simon	Mark	On the morning of the funeral [MASK] tolled the bell, and the tribe gathered in the church for the service. When it was over, he left the church first, leading the way down the aisle, down the steps, to the path that led through the deep woods to the new burial ground.
<name>May Day</name>	May Day	Mark	For three weeks the village was busier than [MASK] had ever seen it, except during the building of the new vicarage. At night in the social hall the older men checked the masks. After school the children practised the dance steps at their play.
<name>Skana</name>	Skana	Tzakamayi	And a voice said to the great cedar tree in Bond Sound, 'Come forth, [MASK] and be a man,’ and he came forth to be the Cedar-man, the first man-god of the people and more powerful than all others.”
<name>Mackenzie</name>	Mackenzie	Tagoona	Was it his fault? The letter was short: “I think it is time you knew of [MASK], the Eskimo. Last year one of our white men said to him, We are glad you have been ordained as the first priest of your people.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Mark	On boards laid across two trestles was a small body covered with a plastic sheet [MASK] lifted the sheet and drew it back, and he looked at what lay under it, and put the sheet down carefully. “Who is he?"
<name>Ichabod</name>	Ichabod	Mark	“I will begin at once to seek a replacement for you, [MASK]. Your work in the village is almost done. When I have found the right man to take your place, I shall write you, and when you come out, you will come to me.”
<name>Velutha</name>	Velutha	Jim	On the broken step of the vicarage sat an old Indian woman, her face scratched and bleeding. She was wailing loudly. “One of the professional mourners," [MASK] told him. “There are three. When somebody dies they take turns wailing day and night.”
<name>Dracula</name>	Dracula	Mark	In the night the village suddenly exploded into sound, and [MASK] put on his slippers, threw a robe over his pajamas and dashed out to collide with a huge dark shape. He made two complete circles of the vicarage.
<name>Pocahontas</name>	Pocahontas	Jim	Now the meaning is gone.” “But [MASK], isn’t it true they were based on a chief’s desire to shame his rival, even if it meant his tribe and his children went hungry?” “Yes, and it was based also on generosity.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Gordon	And the uncle said quickly, “And next year I shall remain in the village during the fishing. [MASK] will be in charge of the gill-netter. When the run is good, he will make as much as four thousand dollars in the season.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Jim	But the tribe did not disperse, and he sensed there was something yet unfinished of which he had no part, and he said, “I will go back to the village now, [MASK].” Til go with you.”
<name>Dr. Aziz</name>	Dr. Aziz	Jim	“And why here? Why does she wail at the vicarage?” “Because the bodies are kept in the vicarage until burial.” As they approached the steps the old Indian woman scuttled into the trees. [MASK] opened the door and they stepped inside.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Mark	When the run is good, he will make as much as four thousand dollars in the season. No young man in the village will have so fine a future.” The old man leaned forward. “[MASK], will you urge him to agree?”
<name>Yuri</name>	Yuri	Jim	Was it true that in the old days the gifts had been so lavish they had beggared whole families and tribes, and made others rich? [MASK] agreed it was true. “Even when I was a small boy stoves, refrigerators and washing machines were given as gifts.
<name>McCandless</name>	McCandless	Gordon	Early the next morning before dawn the four went down the river to the float. When they left on the larger boat, [MASK] remained on the aft deck in the cold rain, looking up at the mountains and the steep green sides of the inlet.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Grandmother	Legally she will be white. She will have no right to come here, except as a visitor.” “But you can go and visit her.” "Yes. And when we go, she will say, *Not today. [MASK]. Come tomorrow.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Mark	“How’re you doing?" and the tug boat captain yelled back they'd made twenty-five miles in twenty-three hours, and four more to go, and [MASK] yelled back that he’d help with the tow.
<name>she</name>	she	Keetah	His mind reached only ahead with that urgent intensity which makes youth seem selfish, and is so necessary to difficult accomplishment. “Do you think I can do it?” he would ask [MASK]. “What do you think?” and she would answer, “I know you can.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Jim	Two places were set on the tattered oildoth of the kitchen table, a plate and a fork, and in the center of the table was a board holding an unappetizing mess of something black and steaming. “We have had nothing to eat since breakfast Shall we have dinner?” [MASK] asked.
<name>Potlatch</name>	Potlatch	TMs	With the Indians it is easy come, easy go. [MASK] goes back to the days of the great potlatches. They do not budget what they have, and even when times are excellent, they get into debt. It is then the dealers pick up their best carvings.”
<name>Ernest</name>	Ernest	Keetah	“It is always the same * she said. “The end of the swimmer is sad.” “But, [MASK], it isn’t. The whole life of the swimmer is one of courage and adventure. All of it builds to the climax and the end.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Keetah	“And how is [MASK]?” he asked him. “I told her that someday she would marry me, and that I would build her a fine house with a pink bathtub. No woman in the tribe has seen a pink bathtub.”
<name>he</name>	he	Mark	This was the time of year when the deepest beliefs of the tribe were relived in the dances; no stranger asked, no photographs permitted. When [MASK] walked along the path past the long house, he could see masks in readiness, but he asked no questions and was told nothing.
<name>Dr. Watson</name>	Dr. Watson	Mark	They walked back to the old vicarage on the little path through the trees, and as they drew near, [MASK] heard a strange sound. On the broken step of the vicarage sat an old Indian woman, her face scratched and bleeding. She was wailing loudly.
<name>he</name>	he	Mark	Did he think [MASK] had not done well? Was that it? Outside dusk was coming, and a cold rain fell. “I like the rain, lad. Surely it was on the bleak and rainy nights that the coastal Indians began to create an identity for themselves.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Mark	[MASK] went with the sergeant to the river’s edge and watched his boat head downstream to the inlet. He did not know that when he turned back in his own eyes was the depth of sadness which he had begun to understand.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Mark	[MASK] read it twice and had a sudden and appalling vision of hundreds of boards, kegs of nails, bolts and shingles, perhaps even a bathtub, all heavy, stubborn and totally inanimate, piled high on the float, waiting to be carried up the river by canoe.
<name>he</name>	he	Mark	Often men on the gill-netters yelled loudly and boisterously, “Watch where you’re going, you fools. Look out for that net—,” the finest words [MASK] had heard here because they could be said only by one friend to another which meant he was one of them.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Mark	“You can’t stop them.” “Then I must go to them. I must talk to them.” “It won’t help.” When [MASK] walked along the bank to the place where the canoe waited, he knew it was useless.
<name>George</name>	George	Mark	They crept up the inlet to the float, and they crept up the river past the log jams and the snags, the water gurgling around them, [MASK], who had forgotten his Kingcome slippers, trying to hold his feet out of the rain water in the bottom of the canoe.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Mark	[MASK] went over the engine room slowly, double-checking everything. He washed the dishes in the galley, placing them carefully behind the little racks that held them tight in a gale. He checked the log, put away the charts, made up the berths, cleaned the refrigerator, and closed the portholes.
<name>Miss Quested</name>	Miss Quested	Jim	He turned away slowly; he was alone in the church. He walked down the aisle to the door and saw [MASK] waiting on the steps. No one else was visible, not even a child or a dog. “Shall we go to the vicarage?”
<name>the Pied Piper</name>	the Pied Piper	Gordon	The long trek down the lonely coast is not yet over. The young will follow [MASK]. Very soon only the old will be left and a very few others, and when the old die, the others will leave.
<name>he</name>	he	Mark	Thus fall flowed past the village like the river, and again [MASK] stood in the small hushed church on Christmas Eve with the candlelight glowing on the golden eagle, watching the lights go out, and his people coming down the path through the trees.
<name>Someone</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	Someone (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	Caleb	[MASK] had prepared him for this one, the first he was to know: “He’s been working for a year in a mill town and is eager to return to his village. You’ll not take the boat out without him until you get your papers.
<name>he</name>	he	Mark	When we stop, she stops. Let’s rest." They rested, and [MASK] got out his pipe, filled, tamped and lighted it, trying very hard not to look back, trying not to show by squirming that he wished to go on.
<name>Mrs. Macphail</name>	Mrs. Macphail	Marta	“Then we must check the masks. We must make sure the strings work properly so the fins of the fish can move and the mouths open.” Under a green spruce [MASK] stood by herself, her eyes on the young vicar. How thin and white he was I
<name>Whale Pass</name>	Whale Pass	Mark	“Oh, no, she won’t” They slipped through a pass so narrow [MASK] was sure the boat would scrape on a huge rock shaped like a whale and covered with brown seaweed. “My people call it *Whale Pass* because long ago the gods turned a whale into that rock.”
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Mark	Then they went on, the young vicar preparing supper in the galley, handing up plates of food and mugs of coffee. The Indian ate standing at the wheel; [MASK] perched on the high stool beside him. No tug boat passed now; no huge boom of mixed logs.
<name>Elijah</name>	Elijah	Caleb	The talk had been entirely nautical. Even In the galley, over meals which the young man cooked, [MASK] had occasionally dropped what surely could not, yet must, be godly counsel. “Be sure to use the Victorian *we,’ lad."
<name>Shadow</name>	Shadow	Mark	Til go with you.” On the way back [MASK] could hear an old man’s voice speaking loudly in the burial glade, almost shouting. It is the eldest. He is speaking the ancient Elizabethan Kw&kwala which the young no longer know.
<name>Adawx</name>	Adawx	Jim	When the clamming is done, and the fishing has not yet be- gun, while we are waiting for the 6olachon, I am giving a dance-potlatch for [MASK], my grandnephew, to pass to him the rights, the ceremonies of my family.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Mark	[MASK] pulled the chair dose to the cot and sat down, and he reached over and touched the shoulder. “Whafs the matter, old-timer? Did you get hit by a widow-maker?” “I knew you’d come, lad.
<name>Mr. Aziz</name>	Mr. Aziz	Jim	When he returned to the vicarage to wait, he saw [MASK] and an older Indian, no doubt the chief councillor, walk down the path to the river, and he heard the motor of a speed boat, and watched it come and stop close to the beach.
<name>before</name>	before	Mark	The village was very quiet, as it had been the day [MASK] had arrived. But its silence lacked peace. Although this was a Saturday and the children were out of school, not a child showed, no Indian hound came running to greet them.
<name>Jackie</name>	Jackie	paleface	You will make a joke of it You’ll laugh and you’ll say. What’s the matter, [MASK]?’, and remember something: that in the sports at school you’ll be as good as any white boy and far better than most and they will respect it.”
<name>Nanny</name>	Nanny	Jim	“You don’t suppose they are going to leave the village again?” [MASK] did not think so. “If this were it I am sure I would be told. It is something which concerns only the old.”
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Gordon	“This is the hot water faucet, and when you turn it on, be careful not to scald yourself,” and [MASK] asked, “But how do you wash your hands and face in this little box without getting your clothes wet?”
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Mark	[MASK] went over to him slowly. “When I was a small boy I used to visit my grandmother in one of the little prairie towns in the mid-continent,” he said. “And the sound I listened for was the long, shaky whistle of the freight train in the night.
<name>Mrs. Joe</name>	Mrs. Joe	Jim	“And here we are in the cold, wasting oil, and supperless,” [MASK] said. "I hope he has the good grace to drown himself.” “He won’t even have a sniffle in his nose. 111 make us some coffee.”
<name>Mr. Davidson</name>	Mr. Davidson	Mark	And [MASK] answered that he considered it not only possible, but likely. "I’d rather come down on top of the vicarage than have the vicarage come down on me,* and for a moment he saw humour rise in the sad eyes and hold.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Mark	and [MASK] said, the same way she told her friends apart, because she knew them. He showed them the village and he answered their questions, and, when they were ready to go, he went with them to the river bank.
<name>Maxine</name>	Maxine	Keetah	daughter, [MASK]’s sister, had written (and he himself had brought the letter in the mail sack) that she was going to marry a white man. “But this happens often and frequently very successfully. There are even white women who have married Indians and been asked to sit on the councils.”
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Mark	“Damn waste of money. First thing they’d do is take off my red long-johns and I'd die of pneumonia.” And [MASK] asked of himself, “And what do you think you’re doing now?”
<name>Ishtar</name>	Ishtar	Marta	You will grow over the wall. You will remain as long as the village lasts, and someday you will take [MASK]’s place and become one of die great women of your tribe, and I shall always be proud of you."
<name>Esi</name>	Esi	Marta	At forty-six she had borne her sixth child, which [MASK] held wrapped in a blanket. All the other births had been normal, and although the native mid-wife was absent from the village, no difficulty had been expected. But this was a breech birth.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Mark	It took two days and two nights to transfer the lumber to the barge, to maneuver it carefully up the river, past the snags and the sandbars, and to unload it. Sometimes, at night, [MASK] would stop working a moment to watch.
<name>he</name>	he	Mark	But the tide was running, and when [MASK] slowed his boat and drew as close to the tug as he dared, he was sure that the little community was scarcely moving at all, and he opened the cabin door and hailed them. “How’re you doing?"
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Mark	“I will write the Bishop today. Will you tell the men I am grateful?” Then they were alone. But there was a difference now. The cautious waiting was over. That night [MASK] wrote to the Bishop and the Bishop’s answer affirmed it.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Ellie	“Did wonders for his wife, boss. You’d never know her. She beat him over the head with a skillet and locked him out of the house, and she wouldn’t let him In until he agreed to let [MASK] go out to school.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Gordon	She will marry me, keep my house, and have my children, and I will leave her and go off to fish.” “She does not like [MASK]?” “She likes him.” “Then what is the matter with him?”
<name>he</name>	he	Mark	And after the carols were sung, and the gifts given, always [MASK] set up the portable altar for the simple service, and when they were pulling away, always he looked back to see some little girl clutching the rag doll to be cherished all year long.
<name>Beloved</name>	Beloved	Gordon	It is my mind that has changed. I can never come home again." “Someday you will be able to live in both 124 I ”»AHn THE OWL CALL MY NAME worlds. And I will tell you something, [MASK], as I told your grandfather.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Marta	The village was quiet and at peace. In her house old [MASK] lay awake in the dark, and she said softly, "Walk straight on, my son. Do not look back. Do not turn your head. You are going to the land of our Lord."
<name>Dravot</name>	Dravot	Gordon	A gale delayed their return. When at last they came up the river in the gray rain, the village was still. Not an Indian was visible. When they entered the vicarage, no child came to welcome them. They knew now [MASK]’s answer.
<name>Santa Claus</name>	Santa Claus	Marta	I am ashamed of it now. He was so patient. He was patient even with the children who pulled his beard* “How do you know?* “Because,* [MASK] said, “I was one of them.* FIVE
<name>MacGyver</name>	MacGyver	Mark	[MASK] took off his surplice, put on his heavy Indian sweater. Out came the wrenches, off came the fuel line. He drained the fuel tank. He bled the air from the fuel line, then connected It all up again.
<name>the white man</name>	the white man	Christianity	What a shame that [MASK] had come here! If the white man had not intruded where he was not wanted, where he did not belong, even now, protected by the mountains and the river, the village would have remained a last stronghold of a culture which was almost gone.
<name>Ethan</name>	Ethan	Mark	In late October the fishing days grew fewer, lessening slowly to an end. Now there were more men in the village. Sometimes [MASK] would see one setting off into the woods to hunt, his rifle held so easily it seemed part of the man himself.
<name>myself</name>	myself	Gordon	He will marry a white girl who can do more for him than I can do, or he will marry an Indian girl who has lived outside since she was very small. I lost my sister to death. I have lost [MASK] to life, and this is harder.
<name>Mammy</name>	Mammy	Peter	The thong that ties it on is broken. [MASK] is going to mend it for me. They will need it in the dancing.* “May I see it?* The boy held it up. “Yes. See how thin it is.
