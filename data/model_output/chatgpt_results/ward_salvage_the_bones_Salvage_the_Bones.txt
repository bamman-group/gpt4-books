<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Randall	“I got it.” [MASK] is swinging something in the dark, and when it crashes into the roof, it makes a dent, a chink of light. He bashes the wood, grunts. Whatever he swings is making a hole.
<name>Tyler</name>	Tyler	Randall	“It’s too thick.” “We have to try.” [MASK] knees his chest like he is putting on pants and then he kicks his heel hard into the center of the plywood where he dented it. The glass behind it shatters.
<name>he</name>	he	Skeetah	One or two sodden bugs whirred outside, and I wondered where [MASK] was, saw him sitting before a fire, his head cocked to the night, which had turned hot after the cold air left by the storm passed. Waiting.
<name>Deuce</name>	Deuce	Skeetah	Every time she move her head toward them, I pop her on her nose.” “You think the other three puppies going to make it?” “Fucking right they going to make it.” [MASK] lays his head back on the bleacher behind his shoulders.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Skeetah	“She need room to breathe.” [MASK]’s hands slide over her fur, and he leans in to listen to her belly. “She gotta relax.” “Ain’t nothing about her relaxed.”
<name>he</name>	he	Randall	The school will pay for it, but [MASK] keeps putting it off because he doesn’t want to lose any playing time. After games, his knee swells up like a water balloon. “I whistled once I saw them.” “I know.”
<name>William Faulkner</name>	William Faulkner	Junior	The high notes are little rips. It circles the house, its bark near and far. Is it one of [MASK]’s mutts, his mangy family member, seeking shelter, the cool bottom of a house and a knobby-kneed boy and no rain?
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Randall	You gotta wander and they’ll come. She’d leaned over like [MASK], her strong hand soft on the back of my neck, steadying me like a dog. They’re usually brown and have some feathers stuck to them, she’d say, pointing.
<name>sea</name>	sea	Sea	They will throw their own dogs into the ring, each hoping for a good fight, a savage heart, a win, to return home from the woods, their own dangerous Aegean [MASK], to be able to say, My bitch did it or My nigga got him.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Skeetah	Someone has bound my feet with barbed wire: I cannot run. [MASK]’s upper body is hanging out the window when the dog leaps from the truck, growling to a bark like a shovel dragged along asphalt wearing away to stones.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Skeetah	I shrug, lift up my hands like I have something to give him when I know I don’t. I start to trot toward [MASK], who is walking deeper into the shade under the trees on his way to the Pit. “Come on!”
<name>Rat</name>	Rat	Marquise	[MASK] turns and smirks around the blunt he is licking shut. He winks at me, his tongue white at the edges, bits of the cigar paper flaking off and sticking like food. I know that wink, that grin.
<name>Bessie</name>	Bessie	China	The roof is thin; we can hear every fumbling rush of the wind, every torrent of rain. And it is so dark that we cannot see each other, but we hear [MASK] barking, and her bark sounds like a fat dog’s, so deep, like dense cloth ripping.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Skeetah	I hiss again, and it is a flailing pillow, beating away. The cows ignore [MASK] as he runs by unless he brushes too close to their salad plate, and then they skitter away a few feet to settle.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Randall	They host baseball games for black town teams every Sunday during the summer. Once, when the outside bathroom stalls were broken when we were younger, [MASK] walked me into the blues club during a baseball Sunday to use the bathroom.
<name>Randall</name>	Randall	Junior	“Gotdamnit!” I grab the slim stick of his arm hard. Dig my fingernails in. Hope he can feel the fear in my hands. “All right, Esch!” [MASK] whines, pulling from me, still clutching the puppy.
<name>he</name>	he	Jason	Did she stand on the deck of that ship like I stand in this clearing, womanly ripe, and weave spells for rain to cloak their departure, to cloak her betrayal? Had [MASK] told her he loved her?
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Skeetah	“We need your help!” “Yeah,” [MASK] says. He wipes the water shawl away, and it smears to a tie running down the middle of his ribs. The air is so hot and close that even with the wind, the water will not evaporate.
<name>pregnancy</name>	pregnancy	Junior	She pulled it out and rinsed it off in the water we were swimming in. Her stomach was big with [MASK]. It healed crooked and purple, puffy, and she had to go to the clinic to get an ointment for it when it started to leak pus.
<name>Janine</name>	Janine	Manny	Every time her mouth shuts, he tries not to, but he flinches. I see it in the balls of his shoulders. “You should give her a bath or something.” [MASK] tosses out the comment.
<name>John</name>	John	China	The spotted one wiggles a little in his hand, feeble and blind as an earthworm, before he sets it down. “You can’t touch them again,” I breathe. A muscle spasms in [MASK]’s side: a white sheet flapping in the wind on a clothesline.
<name>Abby</name>	Abby	Junior	The chicken coop stands with three walls still, the tractor lightly touching it as if providing a thick, rubber-muscled shoulder to lean on. [MASK] is watching a rerun of Reading Rainbow, the volume so low it is barely louder than the fans.
<name>the dog</name>	the dog	China	So do she. If you hurting, what she going to do?” This is the way to his heart. His pride. He stops petting [MASK], lets his hand rest on the warm globe of her skull. She sighs and kicks another puppy away.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Skeetah	[MASK] turned in his crouch. All that jumping, stilled. He was one animal again, or at least he thought he would soon be. “She’s waiting for me,” he said, and jumped down through the ceiling, splashing in the water below.
<name>Darrell</name>	Darrell	Skeetah	She is a mother so many times over. “Maybe she just trying to protect the rest of them. You know, if it’s serious, she know.” [MASK] folds the puppy in his hand like a baseball. He nods. “Fine.”
<name>Bella</name>	Bella	Skeet	“Come on, [MASK].” I lunge like I see the cheerleaders do at school when they climb all over each other to make their pyramids, a human jungle gym: my front knee bent, my back leg straight, as solid and steady as I can make them.
<name>He</name>	He	Skeetah	“She needs to work it out.” [MASK] puts her on a leash and then picks her up, slinging her over one shoulder. Her hind legs tangle in his thighs and make it hard for him to walk. He hasn’t done this since she was a puppy.
<name>Elwood</name>	Elwood	Randall	“We ain’t no dogs,” [MASK] says. “And you ain’t either.” He walks between the thumb and pointer finger of the house, it clenches, and he is gone. The day goes cloudy, and stays.
<name>Cook</name>	Cook	Skeetah	In the kitchen, [MASK] is panting and pulling in the corner, his whole body straining. Where yesterday he had a short ’fro, today his head is shaved clean, and is a shade lighter than the rest of him. His scalp looks like fresh turned dirt.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Y’all	“What you doing?” “I’m making her walk it out.” “[MASK] done already walked damn near two miles to the park. You don’t think she sweated it out yet?” “No.”
<name>Peter</name>	Peter	Skeet	“Running around somewhere in here.” “[MASK]?” “Him, too.” There are no chattering squirrels, no haunted rabbits, no wading turtles in the woods. I don’t know where they have gone, but there are none here.
<name>John</name>	John	Skeetah	“I whistled once I saw them.” “I know.” [MASK] is holding the wrap with one hand, trying to wind it around his torso with the other. The wounds are angry; there are four of them gouged into his stomach and side.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Manny	She is snapping at gnats. And with his arms crossed over his chest and a baseball cap high on his head, there is [MASK]. Every time her mouth shuts, he tries not to, but he flinches. I see it in the balls of his shoulders.
<name>Doodle</name>	Doodle	Marquise	[MASK] is standing next to a boy who must be his cousin; they both are the color of pecans, both have their ears pierced with gold loops, and both are short, but the cousin is a little fatter. His T-shirt is so big it swallows him.
<name>Abilene</name>	Abilene	Skeetah	What would be the baby sits like a water balloon in my stomach, makes me feel set to bursting. My secret makes me clumsy. [MASK] stops, kneels in the needles and crackling leaves; underneath, it all rots and turns to dirt.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	China	He bends and picks the red puppy away from [MASK]’s tit, and milk dribbles down her belly. All eight of her titties are so swollen with milk they look like human breasts. I breathe in air and swallow past the rock in my throat.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Junior	He walks into the shed, and I follow. “Go on, [MASK].” I say. He doesn’t need to know that the puppy is dying. He doesn’t need to know that young things go, too.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Skeetah	But I have. “No,” I say. “I don’t remember.” “I do,” [MASK] says, and he props his chin on his fists. “She told us she loved us when she got into the truck.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Junior	And if you sneak out like you did last night—shut up, [MASK], I saw you—I’m going to catch you and whip you. That’s if the white people don’t eat you first.” “You want me to help you get in the barn?”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Skeetah	Our house is the color of rust, nearly invisible under the oaks and behind the rubbish, lopsided. The cement bricks it sits on are the color of the sand. I follow [MASK], who is walking so quickly, his figure dwindles in the high, hot day.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	China	“The house flooded through. We had to swim to the old house, wait out the storm in the attic.” I wanted to say: We almost drowned. We had to bust out of the attic. We lost the puppies and [MASK].
<name>Arnie</name>	Arnie	Randall	I start to inch up my pants, but they are stuck, and I’m trying to miss the wet-pee grass when I hear it, and I wish I hadn’t. [MASK]’s whistle, high-pitched and sharp, short.
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Skeetah	The kennel is still three pieces of wood hammered together at bad right angles, rooting into the dirt. “You put something on it?” “Just took a shower.” [MASK] mumbles this into his underarm. “Then I poured some peroxide on it.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Skeetah	“What do we need that for?” I ask. In the bucket, the puppy murmurs. It is lonely. “Come on,” [MASK] says. In the woods, animals dart between the valleys of shadow. Birds trill up through pathways of sunlight.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Manny	Would speaking make it remember me once it is born, make it know me? Would it look at me with [MASK]’s face, with his golden skin, with my hair? Would it reach out with its fingers, pink, and grasp?
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Randall	“I got shit to do. I’ll see you later.” [MASK] walks into the kitchen and I look up from the pot like I haven’t been standing on my tiptoes in the faint blue light of the burner’s fire, like I haven’t been listening.
<name>the tree</name>	the tree	Skeetah	Egrets picked their way through the grass, attentive and showy as fussy girlfriends at the cows’ sides. When I came crashing out of the woods, I forgot to touch [MASK], startled at the way the sky opened up at the field, the way the land looked wrong.
<name>Darrow</name>	Darrow	Skeet	He lifts the puppy. Her stomach rises and falls, and the wind coming out of her sounds like a croaking frog. I reach out to touch her. “Don’t,” [MASK] says. “It’ll carry back to the rest.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Skeetah	When [MASK] isn’t smiling, the corners of his lips turn down. Now that he’s mad, his chin looks hard, and his mouth is a straight line. “I’m going to step and grab, okay? Quick as I can.”
<name>the sun</name>	the sun	Manny	Bright, every day almost unbearably bright and hot and close, the way that I feel when [MASK] is sweating over me: golden, burning. Insects root under our feet, squirrels leap from tree to tree, crows glide between the tops of the pines, cawing.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Randall	“You can’t just kill the thing,” [MASK] says. “Yes, I can.” “You can make it better.” “Nothing can make parvo better. Puppies don’t survive that. And if I don’t get rid of this one, the others will catch it.
<name>Chet</name>	Chet	Randall	The storm speaks through the hole, funnels wind and rain through. We squint toward it. The water is over my crotch. The house lists. [MASK] cranks once, twice. He pulls the cord back a third time and it catches, and the saw buzzes to life.
<name>Darnell</name>	Darnell	Marquise	I make them white before I pull them away, one by one, until I am naked in the water, my clothes a dirty, slimy pile on the mud bank. “Y’all niggas crazy,” [MASK] says, but he takes off his clothes anyhow and follows us to the water.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Marquise	He is black all over with a white muzzle. “You said he was big, cuz, but.. .” [MASK]’s whisper trails off to a laugh. “I didn’t think you was talking this big.”
<name>Patroclus</name>	Patroclus	Skeetah	When we ate it, it was tender, sea salty, and had no bones. “Almost done?” [MASK] is watching my hands. I wonder if he sees the wounds underneath the bandage already, if he imagines what they will look like once healed.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	China	he hisses, cutting his eyes at her, wounded. He grabs the puppy, wraps it in his shirt, sits back on his folded feet. [MASK] ignores him and lays her head along her white, gleaming arms that look like herons’ necks.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Skeet	The water slides past my crotch, and I jump. “All right!” [MASK] yells. He pulls himself up on the cord, like he is swinging from a swing rope in a tree, and the attic door groans downward. “Up!”
<name>Augustus</name>	Augustus	Skeetah	“Fine, don’t believe me.” The vines peel away. [MASK] wets his fingers again, but this time he wipes away the droplets of blood that have gathered on my legs like summer gnats. He wipes them away in dabs, licks his fingers again, wipes.
<name>Whoever</name>	Whoever	Mike	Does anyone . .. idea of where . . . projection of storm?” [MASK]’s voice is even, smooth, when we catch it through the static. “. . . unclear. The storm is currently a category one . . . could weaken . .
<name>Connor</name>	Connor	Randall	It makes me think of cereal in milk, of Rice Krispies in sugar. “We need more food,” I say. [MASK] catches his ball, hugs it to his stomach. “Any ideas?” I suck my lips. Feel like chewing something.
<name>Connor</name>	Connor	Manny	All I have ever wanted. He knows. “Fuck!” [MASK] yells, and he is throwing me up and off of him. I hit the door behind me, the rough cat tongue of his face gone, and I grip steel, air, nothing.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Randall	Outside, [MASK] is dribbling. I can see him out of the window, shooting, throwing the ball at the house when it rebounds, catching it, throwing it again. The sun is directly overhead, pouring down into the clearing where he practices.
<name>Stevie</name>	Stevie	Nigga	[MASK], you blind? No, you? All the boys argue. The dogs around them bark and roll in the pine and lick their wounds and wag their tails. They raise their wet noses to the moving wind.
<name>Chris</name>	Chris	Randall	He grins, tentative and gentle as he moves, but it is like an afterthought. “Well, shit.” [MASK] folds himself in half and wipes his face on his basketball shorts. “Shit.” “You ready for the summer league game tomorrow?”
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Marquise	By the time the meat is done cooking, has turned brown and small with as many hard edges as a jewel, the boys have come. [MASK] is slicing at the meat with his own pocket knife, slapping small chunks onto pieces of bread that are turning soggy with hot sauce.
<name>Lincoln</name>	Lincoln	Skeetah	[MASK]’s tongue darts out of his mouth and a razor I did not know he had in his cheek flips out and over the tip of his tongue before he sucks it all back inside. He is reciting something, and he is saying it so fast that it sounds like he is singing it.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	China	THE FIRST DAY: BIRTH IN A BARE-BULB PLACE [MASK]’s turned on herself. If I didn’t know, I would think she was trying to eat her paws. I would think that she was crazy. Which she is, in a way.
<name>prey</name>	prey	China	They are pink yawning tongues. All but one paddles toward [MASK], grabs her abdomen like we do sunken trees at the river. They have trouble grabbing her tits, knead her belly with their paws like we do with our feet when we balance on the slimy trunks.
<name>John</name>	John	Skeetah	The squirrel loses its grip, curls into a ball, and rolls down the trunk, leaving a ribbon of red. [MASK] stands and runs toward it, firing again. Its half tail twitches, and it lays still on the earth.
<name>Louie</name>	Louie	Junior	Where yesterday he had a short ’fro, today his head is shaved clean, and is a shade lighter than the rest of him. His scalp looks like fresh turned dirt. “[MASK] told me you was in here. What you doing?”
<name>Marisol</name>	Marisol	Junior	I wonder what the storm has stirred up from the bottom of the bay, and what it has dragged in and left in the warm, mud-dark water. “Where are the trees?” [MASK] asks.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Unbearable	The pressure eases. It lasts for a shake of my head, a nod at the still empty road, and then it is back. [MASK], a tadpole grown to the confines of its egg. Pressure. I can hold it. I can’t.
<name>Streets</name>	Streets	Manny	“I thought you wasn’t going to fight her, her fresh with milk and all.” The lighter stops, and [MASK] flips it up in the air and catches it. He lights a cigarillo and wedges it in the corner of his mouth and talks around it.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Randall	They are not a patch-up of boards of different sizes like our house; there is no glass left peeking through cracks, only plywood closed smooth and tight as eyelids. “Here.” [MASK] tries to slide his finger between the board and the wall, but only his fingernail fits.
<name>Grey</name>	Grey	Twist	[MASK] jumps and runs, limping like his master, away to the pit and past, his panicked yelp like a siren receding in the distance, off to some other emergency. Behind him, he leaves red rain.
<name>China</name>	China	Skeetah	They’d play tug of war, send up clouds of dust and leave dry rivers in the pine needles. Or China’d nap while [MASK] ate razor blades, sliding them between the pink sleeve of his cheek and tongue and back out of his lips so fast I thought I was imagining it.
<name>Dog</name>	Dog	China	“Let’s go.” We run out the door, scatter the chickens before us, and they whirl about like crape myrtle petals blown loose by summer rain. Brown and rust red and white, the only sound the swish of their wings. [MASK] interrupts, barks.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Claude	With all that beer, you’d think he’d have a bowling-ball gut, but he doesn’t. “Used to tell me, ‘[MASK], I need a little more man than you. Need something warm.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Skeetah	We slide on our stomachs under bushes so tangled and overgrown that we cannot crouch or crawl through them. We slither like snakes, grab dirt and pine straw with our elbows, and pull. [MASK] stops often, straw and twigs sliding off his slick head to catch on his shoulders like holiday tinsel,
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Manny	“It’s not time yet.” “You going to shoot it?” [MASK] eyes the gun. “That’s quick, at least.” “No, I’m not.” “Well, how you going to do it?”
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the context)	someone (There is no proper name given in the context)	Skeet	I swallow and realize that I want to push him, to place my hands flat on the muscles of his chest and shove him for looking that way at [MASK], for insulting him. For saying things he doesn’t know he is saying about me.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	China	[MASK] was a lump, as pale as biscuit dough, laying out in the dirt, her chain attached to a car’s half-eaten skeleton. He’d separated her from the puppies. When I woke up this morning, he was gone.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Kilo	She sinks her face into him. When she draws back, her jaws are shut, and she rips fur. She gasps like she is drawing a breath, and she dives in again with her teeth. “Come on, [MASK]!”
<name>her</name>	her	Junior	I turn, follow [MASK] toward the court. Under the trees in the small, warped wooden bleachers, there are people sitting; I see long dark shadows framing their faces, long glistening legs crossed at the thigh, small shorts: two girls.
<name>Boon</name>	Boon	Skeet	He holds it loosely at first, his eyes moving back and forth like he is reading something written in the air between the trees. “[MASK]. What you fixing to shoot?” “Wasn’t enough cans of meat to steal.”
<name>John</name>	John	Skeetah	Her leg and shoulder and her ripped breast looked like meat, and [MASK] took the same worn-out Ace bandage he’d wrapped his side with and cut it in thirds. He wrapped her leg, her neck and shoulder, her stomach, and pinned.
<name>but I cannot determine the answer without more context or information</name>	but I cannot determine the answer without more context or information	Esch	I ask. “No.” He doesn’t look up. “You can give it a name if you want, [MASK].” He sits with his chin in his hands. “It’s a girl.” A name.
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Randall	* * * [MASK]’s game is today. I wipe the bathroom mirror with my palm, and the glass cracks at the edges, the reflective surface flaking away like glitter. I oil my hands, rub them through my hair, which calms into ringlets.
<name>Elvis</name>	Elvis	Esch	There is a car out there in the shallows of the water. The top gleams red. “This baby got a daddy, [MASK].” He reaches out his big soft hand, soft as the bottom of his feet probably, and helps me stand.
<name>Skeetah</name>	Skeetah	Junior	The floor tilts like the bottom of a dark boat. “Esch!” [MASK] screams as he tries the doorknob, slaps the door, and then bangs out of the back door to pee off the steps. “Esch?”
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Junior	I wade through a tide of kids at the door, all [MASK]’s age or younger, trading small candies they are sucking from wax paper and salty cheesy chips and neon cold drinks they’ve scraped the labels off of with their small, bony fingers.
<name>Winter</name>	Winter	Manny	Twenty-four. There are twenty-four eggs to boil, to save, to eat. They are something. When [MASK] appears, there is no sun to reach out its hand, to stroke him like a dog, to make him blaze and shine.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Junior	I wave it away. “Shit!” I hear muffled through the machinery. “Ask him if he want me to do it again.” [MASK] doesn’t even bother climbing down; he leans out and yells. His little muscles stretch out like shoestrings.
<name>Beloved</name>	Beloved	Manny	The pulpy ripe heart. The sticky heart the boys saw through my boyish frame, my dark skin, my plain face. The girly heart that, before [MASK], I’d let boys have because they wanted it, and not because I wanted to give it.
<name>he</name>	he	Randall	Three pieces of bologna. An empty cardboard box from the gas station that holds chicken bones sucked dry. A half gallon of milk. Ketchup and mayonnaise. The stove is gas, so when [MASK] lights the burners, the kitchen glows orange and shadows climb the walls.
<name>John</name>	John	Randall	In one, there are around fifteen cans of peas, green writing on silver, and a few of potted meat. And in the second box, there are two dozen bags of Top Ramen. [MASK] grabs the box with the peas and meat in it, and I grab the box with the ramen.
<name>him</name>	him	China	“I’m just going to put them back. See?” He grabs the white one by the nape, pinches it with his whole hand, and moves it a foot back so it is closer to [MASK]. She breathes sleepily.
<name>Connor</name>	Connor	Skeetah	“Why?” “I don’t know.” The light is creeping into the bathroom like fog. [MASK] pulls his shirt back over his head, looks down at my body to my chest, my stomach, my feet. What does he know?
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Henry	“My dog would just be sneezing.” Big, [MASK] says. He shrugs and laughs. He has eyes the color of bleached-out asphalt, and when he smiles, they shrink to fingernails in his face. “Your dog wouldn’t be able to breathe.
<name>Balthazar</name>	Balthazar	Randall	[MASK] jumps in the middle of the fight as it spills out of the door, begins screaming at all of them, calling names, pulling them from their fury one by one until he stands in the middle of them, taller than all of them, black as iron, rigid as a gate.
