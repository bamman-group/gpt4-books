<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Ernest	A legal right, yes, but had he a moral right? [MASK] thought not, considering his mode of life. But put this on one side; if the man were to be violent, what should he do?
<name>Reuben</name>	Reuben	Theobald	In those days people believed with a simple downrightness which I do not observe among educated men and women now. It had never so much as crossed [MASK]'s mind to doubt the literal accuracy of any syllable in the Bible.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Ernest	"I do not know what you mean, mamma," exclaimed [MASK] anxiously and more or less hurriedly. His mother construed his manner into indignation at being suspected, and being rather frightened herself she turned tail and scuttled off as fast as her tongue could carry her.
<name>John</name>	John	Ernest	In the mornings she was generally better, as long that is to say as [MASK] remained at home; but he had to go out buying, and on his return would generally find that she had had another attack as soon as he had left the house.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Ernest	[MASK] was getting a big boy now. She could excuse any young woman for taking a fancy to him; as for himself, why she was sure he was behind no young man of his age in appreciation of the charms of a nice-looking young woman.
<name>Voltaire</name>	Voltaire	Aristophanes	Without some such palliation as admiration for one, at any rate, of the tragedians, it would be almost as dangerous for [MASK] to attack them as it would be for an Englishman now to say that he did not think very much of the Elizabethan dramatists.
<name>He</name>	He	Ernest	We cannot help it; all science must have its martyrs, and none of these will deserve better of humanity than those who have fallen in the pursuit of spiritual pathology." [MASK] grew more and more interested, but in the meekness of his soul said nothing.
<name>He</name>	He	Ernest	She said she was again with child, and [MASK] still believed her. All the troubles of the preceding six months began again then and there, and grew worse and worse continually. Money did not come in quickly, for
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Theobald	Please do not be angry with me. I will order the--the--" but the word "dinner" was checked by rising sobs. When [MASK] heard these words a load began to be lifted from his heart, but he only looked towards her, and that not too pleasantly.
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Ernest	At nineteen she had looked older than she was, now she looked much younger; indeed she looked hardly older than when [MASK] had last seen her, and it would have taken a man of much greater experience than he possessed to suspect how completely she had fallen from her first estate.
<name>Godfrey</name>	Godfrey	Theobald	Certainly it was rather hard to make him think that he and his were to be gainers, and get the honour and glory of the bequest, when all the time the money was virtually being taken out of [MASK]'s own pocket.
<name>Godfrey</name>	Godfrey	Ernest	He had laid out a few of his shillings upon her wardrobe, so that she was neatly dressed, and, indeed, she looked very pretty and so good that I could hardly be surprised at [MASK]'s infatuation when the other circumstances of the case were taken into consideration.
<name>Hiawatha</name>	Hiawatha	Casabianca	Oh, why, why, why, could not people be born into the world as grown-up persons? Then he thought of [MASK]. He had been examined in that poem by his father not long before. 'When only would he leave his position?
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Overton	"Give me some, and give [MASK] some." And so on till he had eaten a good plate of oysters, a scallop shell of minced veal nicely browned, some apple tart, and a hunk of bread and cheese. This was the small piece of bread and butter.
<name>Stapleton</name>	Stapleton	Ernest	The question now arose what was to be done with the children. I explained to [MASK] that their expenses must be charged to the estate, and showed him how small a hole all the various items I proposed to charge would make in the income at my disposal.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Ernest	This conscious self of yours, [MASK], is a prig begotten of prigs and trained in priggishness; I will not allow it to shape your actions, though it will doubtless shape your words for many a year to come.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Ellen	I was glad the crisis had come; I was sorry for [MASK], but a complete separation from her was the only chance for her husband. Even after this last outbreak he was unwilling to consent to this, and talked nonsense about dying at his post, till I got tired of him.
<name>Ishmaels</name>	Ishmaels	Ishmaels	"I always did hate those people," he said, "and they always have hated and always will hate me. I am an Ishmael by instinct as much as by accident of circumstances, but if I keep out of society I shall be less vulnerable than [MASK] generally are.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Theobald	Their papa and mamma were so cordial and they themselves lifted him so deftly over conversational stiles that before dinner was over [MASK] thought the family to be a really very charming one, and felt as though he were being appreciated in a way to which he had not hitherto been accustomed.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Ernest	[MASK] could never stand being spoken to in this way by his mother: for he still believed that she loved him, and that he was fond of her and had a friend in her--up to a certain point.
<name>Theobald</name>	Theobald	Theobald	CHAPTER XLVIII Once, recently, when he was down at home after taking his degree, his mother had had a short conversation with him about his becoming a clergyman, set on thereto by [MASK], who shrank from the subject himself.
<name>Ernest</name>	Ernest	Ernest	[MASK] himself was frightened at it, but he had once heard someone say that the Psalms were many of them very poor, and on looking at them more closely, after he had been told this, he found that there could hardly be two opinions on the subject.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Ernest	But with her other hand she still kept hold of his; she had got him and she meant to keep him. The lad hung down his head and promised. What else could he do? "You know there is no one, dear, dear [MASK], who loves you so much as your papa
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Ernest	I saw they looked suspiciously upon the manifest signs that someone was breakfasting with me, and parted from me more or less defiantly, but I got rid of them, and poor [MASK] came out again, looking white, frightened and upset.
<name>Ernest</name>	Ernest	Ernest	CHAPTER LXXXIV On our way to town [MASK] broached his plans for spending the next year or two. I wanted him to try and get more into society again, but he brushed this aside at once as the very last thing he had a fancy for.
<name>Ernest</name>	Ernest	Ernest	The organ was begun, and made fair progress during the first two months of the half year. [MASK] was happier than he had ever been before, and was struggling upwards. The best boys took more notice of him for his aunt's sake, and he consorted less with those who led him into mischief.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Alethea	But, anyway, he would like making an organ, and this could do him no harm, so the sooner he began the better. [MASK] thought it would save trouble in the end if she told her brother and sister-in-law of this scheme.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Ernest	For [MASK], a very great future--she was certain of it--was in store. This made severity all the more necessary, so that from the first he might have been kept pure from every taint of evil.
<name>Edmund</name>	Edmund	Ernest	He was always thinking that people had a claim upon him for some inestimable service they had rendered him, or for some irreparable mischief done to them by himself; the case however was so clear, that [MASK]'s scruples did not offer serious resistance.
<name>Constance</name>	Constance	Alethea	I was asked to be his second godfather, and was rejoiced to have an opportunity of meeting [MASK], whom I had not seen for some few years, but with whom I had been in constant correspondence. She and I had always been friends from the time we had played together as children onwards.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	I mean the fact that a bishop's wife does not take the rank of her husband. This had been the doing of [MASK], who had been a bad woman, of exceeding doubtful moral character, and at heart a Papist to the last.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Theobald	The first signs of self-will must be carefully looked for, and plucked up by the roots at once before they had time to grow. [MASK] picked up this numb serpent of a metaphor and cherished it in his bosom.
<name>Edgar</name>	Edgar	Ernest	The young people, however, were very ready to be friendly. I remember [MASK] and his brother hovered round me on the first day of one of these visits with their hands full of fading flowers, which they at length proffered me.
<name>Levin</name>	Levin	Ernest	As for [MASK], he blushed crimson. The pair did not speak during the rest of the time they were in the carriage, but they eyed each other from time to time, so that the face of each was impressed on the recollection of the other.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Christina	One grief only overshadowed the early years of their married life: I mean the fact that no living children were born to them. CHAPTER XVII In the course of time this sorrow was removed. At the beginning of the fifth year of her married life [MASK] was safely delivered of a boy.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	John	Have you anything more to say?" "No more nor what I have said," said [MASK] sullenly, "but what I've said I means and I'll stick to--character or no character."
<name>Ernest</name>	Ernest	Ernest	I do not suppose it even occurred to him to try and remember what he had felt when his father took a like course in regard to himself. [MASK]'s position in this respect was much what it had been at school except that things were on a larger scale.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Ernest	In one book there was an editorial note to the effect that the writer was to be condemned. [MASK] particularly admired the book he was desired to condemn, and feeling how hopeless it was for him to do anything like justice to the books submitted to him, returned them to the editor.
<name>Ernest</name>	Ernest	Theobald	The foregoing had been instilled into my hero from earliest boyhood, much as it had been instilled into [MASK] himself, and with the same result--the conviction, namely, that he was certainly to be a clergyman, but that it was a long way off yet, and he supposed it was all right.
<name>Handel</name>	Handel	Handel	He dared not answer Yes, but he would try hard that it should be so. Then there came into his mind that noble air of [MASK]'s: "Great God, who yet but darkly known," and he felt it as he had never felt it before.
<name>She</name>	She	Theobald	If he should have shoes and stockings and whole clothes at all, it should be only because absolute rags and tatters had been graciously dispensed with, whereas here he was swaggering in a grey ulster and a blue and white necktie, and looking better than [MASK] had ever seen him in his life.
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Ernest	As soon as [MASK] heard that his wardrobe was at hand, he got out a suit of clothes he had had before he had been ordained, and put it on at once, much, as I thought, to the improvement of his personal appearance.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Ernest	She soon recovered, and [MASK] was beginning to breathe freely and be almost sanguine when, without a word of warning, the storm broke again. He returned one afternoon about two years after his marriage, and found his wife lying upon the floor insensible.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Ernest	We had no business with pleasant things at all, at any rate very little business, at any rate not he, [MASK]. We were put into this world not for pleasure but duty, and pleasure had in it something more or less sinful in its very essence.
<name>Mr. Ramsay</name>	Mr. Ramsay	Theobald	[MASK] was the perfection of neatness; while his son was ill upstairs, he copied out the school list so that he could throw his comments into a tabular form, which assumed the following shape--only that of course I have changed the names.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Ernest	As for the elephants, especially the baby elephant, he seemed to be drinking in large draughts of their lives to the re-creation and regeneration of his own. We dined in the gardens, and I noticed with pleasure that [MASK]'s appetite was already improved.
<name>Ernest</name>	Ernest	Ernest	He knew he could depend upon the cook and the other servants--the coachman would see to this; on the whole, therefore, both he and the coachman thought the story as proposed by [MASK] would about meet the requirements of the case.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Ellen	As for the loss of reputation--considering that he had [MASK] and me left, it did not come to much. I saw the house on the afternoon of the day on which all was finished, and there remained nothing but to buy some stock and begin selling.
<name>Grimes</name>	Grimes	Ernest	Here, again, there was a feeble show of resistance, but the thumbscrews were instantly applied, and [MASK], demoralised as he already was, recanted and submitted himself to the powers that were. He told only a little less than he knew or thought he knew.
<name>Challoner</name>	Challoner	Pryer	How can a sheep dog work a flock of sheep unless he can bite occasionally as well as bark? But as regards ourselves we can do much." [MASK]'s manner was strange throughout the conversation, as though he were thinking all the time of something else.
<name>Ernest</name>	Ernest	Theobald	And now I will continue my story. CHAPTER XX The birth of his son opened [MASK]'s eyes to a good deal which he had but faintly realised hitherto. He had had no idea how great a nuisance a baby was.
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Theobald	"I think," said [MASK], "if he sees us in the street he will turn round and run away from us. He is intensely selfish." "Then we must get leave to go inside the prison, and see him before he gets outside."
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Christina	In spite, however, of these flights of religious romanticism, [MASK] was a good-tempered kindly-natured girl enough, who, if she had married a sensible layman--we will say a hotel-keeper--would have developed into a good landlady and been deservedly popular with her guests.
<name>Archer</name>	Archer	Theobald	On this, turning to the warder, he said: "I believe I am free to leave the prison if I wish to do so. You cannot compel me to remain here longer. Please take me to the gates." [MASK] stepped forward.
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Ernest	She cooked them much more nicely than he had been able to do, and laid breakfast for him and made coffee, and some nice brown toast. [MASK] had been his own cook and housemaid for the last few days and had not given himself satisfaction.
<name>Christina</name>	Christina	Christina	CHAPTER XXVI The foregoing letter shows how much greater was [MASK]'s anxiety for the eternal than for the temporal welfare of her sons. One would have thought she had sowed enough of such religious wild oats by this time, but she had plenty still to sow.
<name>Edmund</name>	Edmund	Theobald	Oh, what a comfort it was to [MASK] to reflect that he had a wife on whom he could rely never to cost him a sixpence of unauthorised expenditure! Letting alone her absolute submission, the perfect coincidence of her opinion with his own upon every subject and her constant assurances to him that he was right in
<name>Despondency</name>	Despondency	Ellen	I had indeed noted the old wan worn look settling upon his face, but was either too indolent or too hopeless of being able to sustain a protracted and successful warfare with [MASK] to extend the sympathy and make the inquiries which I suppose I ought to have made.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Theobald	He turned sharply on [MASK] in a moment. I will not repeat the words he used, for they came out before he had time to consider them, and they might strike some of my readers as disrespectful; there were not many of them, but they were effectual.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Joey	"Of course he would buy [MASK] a living, and make large presents yearly to his sister--was there anything else? Oh! yes--he would become a county magnate now; a man with nearly 4000 pounds a year should certainly become a county magnate.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Ernest	Of course it would, but we would not take it though it were offered us. No matter what evil may befall us, we will mostly abide by it and see it out. I could see that [MASK] felt much as I had felt myself.
<name>Mark</name>	Mark	Ernest	On [MASK] himself the effect was to confirm the good opinion of himself which had been growing upon him ever since he had begun to read for orders, and to make him flatter himself that he was among the few who were ready to give up _all_ for Christ.
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Theobald	When the time approached for him to leave prison, his father and mother consulted as to what course they should adopt. "We must never leave him to himself," said [MASK] impressively; "we can neither of us wish that." "Oh, no!
<name>Wesley</name>	Wesley	Wesley	The combating of infidelity, therefore, offered little scope for enterprising young clergymen, nor had the Church awakened to the activity which she has since displayed among the poor in our large towns. These were then left almost without an effort at resistance or co-operation to the labours of those who had succeeded [MASK].
<name>Moses</name>	Moses	Moses	"And they put him in ward because it was not declared what should be done to him. "And the Lord said unto [MASK], the man shall be surely put to death; all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.
<name>Paley</name>	Paley	Paley	I could subscribe cordially to every one of the thirty-nine articles which do indeed appear to me to be the _ne plus ultra_ of human wisdom, and [MASK], too, leaves no loop-hole for an opponent; but I am
<name>He</name>	He	Ernest	Absolute independence he believed to be his only chance of very life itself. Over and above this--if this were not enough--[MASK] had a faith in his own destiny such as most young men, I suppose, feel, but the grounds of which were not apparent to any one but himself.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Christina	"Stuff and nonsense, my dearest [MASK]," he exclaimed mildly, and stamped his foot upon the floor of the carriage. "It is a wife's duty to order her husband's dinner; you are my wife, and I shall expect you to order mine."
<name>he</name>	he	Ernest	Still I think you have been near us though you were too proud to let us know--and now at last I have you in my arms once more, my dearest, dearest boy." How cruel, how infamously unfeeling [MASK] thought he had been. "
<name>Will</name>	Will	Ernest	The pipes had better be kept in a cupboard for a week or two, till in other and easier respects [MASK] should have proved his steadfastness. Then they might steal out again little by little--and so they did.
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Alethea	Boys are very like nice dogs in this respect--give them a bone and they will like you at once. [MASK] employed every other little artifice which she thought likely to win their allegiance to herself, and through this their countenance for her nephew.
<name>Glegg</name>	Glegg	Alethea	With greater promptitude than he had shown yet, he reckoned up his money and found he had two shillings and threepence at his command; there was his knife which might sell for a shilling, and there was the silver watch his Aunt [MASK] had given him shortly before she died.
<name>Weller</name>	Weller	Ernest	I have examined very little myself except the bottoms of old kettles and saucepans, but if you will answer me a few questions, I will tell you whether or no you have examined much more than I have." [MASK] expressed his readiness to be questioned. "
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Ernest	The poor were in consternation. "The well's never missed," said one old woman, "till it's dry," and she only said what everyone else felt. [MASK] knew that the general regret was unaffected as for a loss which could not be easily repaired.
<name>Moses</name>	Moses	Moses	The philosopher did not much like this, and dilated upon the importance of showing people the folly of much that they pretended to believe. She smiled and said demurely, "Have they not [MASK] and the prophets? Let them hear them."
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Ernest	I need hardly say I am alluding to his school bill. This document was always a source of anxiety to [MASK], for it was gone into with scrupulous care, and he was a good deal cross-examined about it.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Christina	Then there was a postscript in [MASK]'s writing. "My darling, darling boy, pray with me daily and hourly that we may yet again become a happy, united, God-fearing family as we were before this horrible pain fell upon us.--Your sorrowing but ever loving mother, C. P."
<name>John</name>	John	Ernest	" [MASK] could hardly believe his ears, but when the doctor had seen his wife and she had become more quiet, he went over to the public house hard by and made enquiries, the result of which rendered further doubt impossible.
<name>Shaw</name>	Shaw	Ernest	Simply this, that a conspiracy of silence about things whose truth would be immediately apparent to disinterested enquirers is not only tolerable but righteous on the part of those who profess to be and take money for being _par excellence_ guardians and teachers of truth. [MASK] saw no logical escape from this conclusion.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	John	Why had he never treated his sisters in this way? He would do so next time he saw them; he might in time be able to stand up to his brother [MASK], or even his father. Thus do we build castles in air when flushed with wine and conquest.
<name>Ursula</name>	Ursula	Pryer	"And what," resumed [MASK], "does all this point to? Firstly, to the duty of confession--the outcry against which is absurd as an outcry would be against dissection as part of the training of medical students.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Ernest	Boys and young men are violent in their affections, but they are seldom very constant; it is not till they get older that they really know the kind of friend they want; in their earlier essays young men are simply learning to judge character. [MASK] had been no exception to the general rule.
<name>Singleton</name>	Singleton	Ernest	What are we to think of the practice of a Church which encourages people to rely on unprofessional advice in matters affecting their eternal welfare, when they would not think of jeopardising their worldly affairs by such insane conduct?" [MASK] could see no weak place in this.
<name>Wilmot</name>	Wilmot	John	[MASK] said to me in his blandest manner that he fancied he remembered to have heard his sister say that she thought of leaving money to found a college for the relief of dramatic authors in distress; to this I made no rejoinder, and I have no doubt his suspicions were deepened.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Ernest	If we were doing anything we liked, we, or at any rate he, [MASK], should apologise and think he was being very mercifully dealt with, if not at once told to go and do something else.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Alethea	Two years later he married a lady about seven years younger than himself, who brought him a handsome dowry. She died in 1805, when her youngest child [MASK] was born, and her husband did not marry again. CHAPTER III
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Ernest	This seemed so sensible, and suited [MASK] so exactly that he readily fell into it, nor did he suspect dangers which were apparent enough to me when I heard how she had treated the matter. I kept silence, however, and for a time all continued to go well.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Ernest	It was settled that the organ was not to be begun before the Christmas holidays were over, and that till then [MASK] should do a little plain carpentering, so as to get to know how to use his tools.
<name>She</name>	She	Ellen	He knew all now. The neighbours thought he must have known that his wife drank all along, but [MASK] had been so artful, and he so simple, that, as I have said, he had had no suspicion.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Ernest	and I were compelled to loiter. At last, about three o'clock the case was called on, and we went round to the part of the court which is reserved for the general public, while [MASK] was taken into the prisoner's dock.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Ernest	[MASK] that he had made this discovery himself and been familiar with it all his life, that he had never known, in fact, of anything else. He wrote long letters to his college friends expounding his views as though he had been one of the Apostolic fathers.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Ernest	The only way out of it that [MASK] could see was that he should get married at once. But then he did not know any one whom he wanted to marry. He did not know any woman, in fact, whom he would not rather die than marry.
<name>Milton</name>	Milton	Milton	Look at [MASK], who only got 5 pounds for 'Paradise Lost.'" "And a great deal too much," I rejoined promptly. "I would have given him twice as much myself not to have written it at all."
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Ernest	This operation was carried on upon the ground in front of the cottage door, and while we were in the midst of it the cottager's little boy, a lad much about [MASK]'s age, trod upon one of the eggs that was wrapped up in paper and broke it.
<name>Rawdon</name>	Rawdon	Theobald	Her face (as indeed faces generally are, though I grant they lie sometimes) was a fair index to her disposition. She was good nature itself, and everyone in the house, not excluding I believe even [MASK] himself after a fashion, was fond of her.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ellen	He was crimson with his exertion; covered with dust, and with his trousers and coat sleeves a trifle short for him he cut a poor figure enough as he thrust on [MASK] his watch, his knife, and the little money he had.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Ernest	Perhaps it was well that [MASK] was not at home for very long together, but as yet his affection though hearty was quite Platonic. He was not only innocent, but deplorably--I might even say guiltily--innocent.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Christina	The old gentleman was cross and very difficult; he could eat nothing--had no appetite at all. [MASK] tried to coax him with a little bit of the fleshy part of a mutton chop. "How in the name of reason can I be asked to eat a mutton chop?"
<name>Stevenson</name>	Stevenson	Ernest	It is now the autumn of 1882, and if I am to say more I should do so quickly, for I am eighty years old and though well in health cannot conceal from myself that I am no longer young. [MASK] himself is forty-seven, though he hardly looks it.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Charlotte	It was like trying to obtain money under false pretences. If he had been fond of [MASK] it might have been another matter, but he thought her one of the most disagreeable young women in the whole circle of his acquaintance. She was supposed to be very clever.
