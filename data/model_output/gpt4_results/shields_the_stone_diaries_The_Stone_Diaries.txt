<name>She</name>	She	Alice	Women, I learned, needed to be bloody, but they didn’t need to be mean. The reverberations in my family were surprisingly minor, like the offhand ringing of distant chimes - as though all these years I’d been given the benefit of the doubt: [MASK]’s gained in maturity, they said.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Lewis	[MASK] posed this question in a social voice, while spreading butter on a floury scone. “Well, I’m not quite sure.” “But you must have some kind of impression.” “An unhappy man. Aggrieved. His wife left him, you see.”
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Harold	Salad forks, of course, go outside the dinner fork. [MASK] always takes Grape-Nuts for breakfast. A question of digestion and general health. I feel I should make myself clear on this point. I’m speaking of b.m.’s. Bowel movements.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Harold	It was a great disappointment to me personally when [MASK] decided to leave his engineering studies after one year, but then he has always been one for practical concerns, and clearly he saw his place in the family business, particularly in view of his father’s early death.
<name>me</name>	me	Victoria	She’s more focused for one thing, and, at the same time, more dreamy and ineffectual, wanting, it seems to [MASK], to pull herself inside a bag of buried language, to be that language, to be able to utter that unutterable word: father.
<name>he</name>	he	Daisy	After that, there is a great gap in his recollections, unflavored, flat, for [MASK] is suddenly eleven years old and lying in a darkened room, recovering from a serious illness (measles? what?), looking up at him with eyes that seem no longer the eyes of a child.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Daisy	He does not want to hear this; at this time in his life he needs all [MASK]’s strong feelings for himself. These kinds of confessions, these points of honor, are almost always comic when viewed up close - and equally comic when viewed from a distance.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Lew	The rain showed no sign of abating, and after a minute [MASK] took the two women by the arm and led them across the street to a tea shop where they sat out the storm, keenly aware of each other.
<name>Galadriel</name>	Galadriel	Daisy	The terrible hole of a mouth moved again: “Bark.” The word whispered its way, leaking around the edge of sound. “And I’m [MASK],” she said. He seemed to have stopped breathing. The silence was terrible.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Daisy	By the way, [MASK], it is always preferable to say ‘death,’ rather than ‘passing on’ or ‘passing away.’ By the same token - I feel I must mention this - we invite people to dinner, not for dinner.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Daisy	I see you are not eating your olives, [MASK]. If you should at any time find something on your plate which is not to your liking, try to avoid giving offense by sliding it under something else. In this case, your lettuce leaf will do nicely.
<name>Alan</name>	Alan	Cuyler	About their future fife together she seemed incurious, almost indifferent, though the fact that they would be let a modest company house did stir a response - her own home to order and arrange and run as she pleased. She would like that, she told [MASK] shyly.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Daze	Not that [MASK] and I ever discuss sex. Well, not for a long time anyway, not since we were young girls trying to puzzle out the mysteries of the copulative act: how long did it last? How much did it hurt?
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Victoria	Even [MASK] was surprised to see the hundreds of townish houses, so solidly built, so plain. She looked at the unrevealing facades of these houses and imagined women inside, standing in front of mirrors, considering themselves, or men pulling sweaters over their heads, flattening down their hair.
<name>Alfred</name>	Alfred	Daisy	And now, here was this barely breathing cadaver, all his old age depletions registered and paid for. A tissue of skin. A scaffold of bone; well, more like china than bone. “It’s [MASK],” she said into his ear, unable to think of anything else.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Mercy	My father has had only limited schooling, but he’s blessed with a naturalist’s curiosity and not long ago he hacked out a few of the more interesting fossil pieces and carried them home to show to his wife, [MASK].
<name>Josephine</name>	Josephine	Daisy	Her emotional rhythms are sometimes uneven, as you might expect, and yet she is capable of generous insight. She’s confided to her Aunt [MASK], for instance, that she can understand the genealogical phenomenon that has burst forth all around her.
<name>John</name>	John	Goodwill	The ring is of yellow gold with a fine milled edge. The wedding date, June 15, 1903, is engraved inside, as well as the initials of the bride and groom. [MASK] recalls exactly what he paid for the ring, which was four dollars and twenty-five cents.
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Alice	Ceremony, she says, is society’s cement; ceremony paints large our sketchiest impulses; ceremony forms the seal between the cerebrum and cerebellum. [MASK] has a theory about every bush and button and human gesture, sometimes several theories.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Daisy	I’m speaking of b.m.’s. Bowel movements. He has been troubled in that particular department since he was a very young boy, and so Grape-Nuts are a necessity, also a very economical food. We must never be ashamed of economy, [MASK].
<name>Odysseus</name>	Odysseus	Magnus	“Please.” The first thing she noticed was a milky film over his irises. And the white sheets, also the white coverlet that made him look as though he were wrapped in bandages. [MASK], the wanderer, the suffering modem man -that was how
<name>Lonely</name>	Lonely	Sad	Not around here at any rate. [MASK], isn’t it.” “Very.” “And, of course, when you get to his age, not that many do, well, you don’t have a great many friends come visiting.”
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Harold	Plain note cards are best, with perhaps a raised band around the edge. Once [MASK] was eating a handful of popcorn and began to choke. I always keep a close eye on him when we have a popcorn evening. Finally, a word about your honeymoon.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Daisy	And into this system, which is not nearly as neat and logical as he had once believed, has crept the fact of [MASK]. She sits far out at the end of one of the branches, laughing, calling to him.
<name>Leni</name>	Leni	Alice	“The mother and father lie on a bed,” her mother tells her, sighing it out, “with their arms around each other.” “When?” [MASK] asks. Her own voice feels harsh to her ears.
<name>He</name>	He	Warren	Sometimes she puts on a pair of silver-colored earrings that hang on by pinching her ear lobes hard. [MASK] can’t help feeling proud of her when he sees her looking like this, coming down the carpeted stairs, all fixed up.
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Victoria	She let me paint the storeroom in the attic pink and white and put up curtains - my own private bedroom, no one to muck things up, and later, after [MASK] was bom, she said, “Why don’t you fix up the downstairs sunroom for the baby?”
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Crumpled	Thin, pale. [MASK]. On the plane coming over she had invented rich, thrilling dialogues for the two of them. “Have you been happy in your life?” she’d planned to ask her mother.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Beverly	In no time at all they’ll be in college and you’ll be free to go tripping around with your old “gal” friends, which is what you’ve always wanted. Frankly, I think [MASK] is taking advantage of your good nature.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Mercy	The potency and fragrance of erotic love that overwhelmed him so suddenly in his twenty-sixth year was answered by [MASK] with mild bewilderment. She was not cold toward him, not in the least, but returned his first shy eager embraces with a sighing acquiescence.
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Alice	It’s true she loves her mother, and true she’s a good daughter - didn’t she come all this way across the drink to try to jolly her out of her current state of the blues? The trouble is, [MASK] doesn’t know where to begin.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alice	“I’m glad to be here.” “What did you say?” “I said, I’m glad to be here.” “Forgive me, darling [MASK], if I don’t believe you.”
<name>Elspeth</name>	Elspeth	Mercy	At the moment the rainbow makes its appearance he is standing, and the next moment kneeling, by the grave of his wife, [MASK]. He, a stonecutter by trade, has set her gravestone himself, a mottled wedge split thin and polished, with her name and dates deeply incised on its center.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Fraidy	“Maybe you should think about finding a place of your own,” [MASK] says. “Personally, I couldn’t stand living in the midst of an ongoing operetta.” “She’s always kissing me. Morning, noon, and night, kissing.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Warren	She’s followed ' the complicated directions meticulously, right down to the pimento strips and sliced stuffed olives that form the garnishing. “Why didn’t I just buy some cold ham?” she wonders out loud. “I love ham,” [MASK] says dreamily, and it’s true.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Victoria	That’s as far as she goes: she just thinks about them, concentrates on them, dwells on them. For her grandniece, [MASK], the two fathers are described, but never quite animated; their powers are asserted, but not demonstrated.
<name>art</name>	art	Commerce	Now, in his fifties, he champions [MASK]. These periods of preoccupation are approximate, of course, for naturally there is a good deal of overlapping, some spiritual residue in his business activities, some memory of erotic love to sweeten his art.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Daisy	[MASK] in her pictures appears an obedient child, careful of her dress, and possessed of a spare, neat body - and for this he supposes he should feel gratefvd. Her smile is neither forward nor timid, but something in between.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Daisy	Oh, [MASK]’s garden! That garden’s something else. She can get up in the morning and spend all day if she likes trimming and weeding and transplanting and bringing beauty into the world. While I’m sitting at work. Tied to a desk and to the clock.
<name>Euclid</name>	Euclid	Furthermore	The scolding voice he so often hears in the dark says: “You will never be able to equal your first monument, you’ve lost your touch.” [MASK], measurements taken only one week earlier, told him the structure had gone out of plumb, and that it would grow worse as he progressed.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Dick	Time does heal, that is what you must keep in mind, though of course we never really forget those who have played such a large part in our lives. [MASK] joins me in these few rushed words of sympathy.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Daisy	# “In one hour I will be there,” [MASK] writes in her travel journal, underlining “there” three times. It is unbearably hot on the train, but she has managed, with the conductor’s assistance, to open a window.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Daisy	Once he saw her appear in the doorway of that house - still slender under a full white apron - and heard her give a shout, calling the girl, [MASK], into the house, saying supper was on the table and she’d better hustle herself inside, lickety-split.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Alice	She will not let the issue drop. “I don’t know what to say, [MASK]. And I don’t like the way you’re speaking, your attitude, that scowl on your face.” This is becoming worse and worse.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Shirley	Dear All, Sorry I haven’t written lately but I’ve been going through a lousy time with Russian lit, also with the professor (a drip) and my roommate, [MASK], who’s depressed about her boyfriend, another drip. Also it’s been raining a lot.
<name>David</name>	David	Bethlehem	Her prized star of [MASK] sits rooted in its china pot; she likes to study its gray-green leaves for secrets. The wallpaper, too, holds her attention with its rows of flowers, its browns and pinks alternating and repeating.
<name>Oedipa</name>	Oedipa	Jubilee	“I’m still in here,” she thinks, rocking herself to consciousness in the lonely, air-conditioned, rubbersmelling discomfort of the hospital, “still here.” “She’s a real honey,” [MASK] says to anyone who happens to be around.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Daisy	I am pleased to write that [MASK] continues plump and happy, and her legs are grown strong indeed. My son and I are of the opinion that she will be walking before the month is out. I enclose the photograph you requested.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Maria	Also want to assure you we got the key to the Lake Lemon house from the lawyer and checked it over thoroughly. There’s absolutely no indication of what might have happened to [MASK], no notes, etc., though it looks like some of her clothes could be missing.
<name>Now</name>	Now	Alice	Now her mother is staring down at her cuticles. The little teapot clock over the stove says half-past three. A coconut chiffon cake, freshly iced, sits on a pink glass plate. “Well?” [MASK] is waiting for an answer.
<name>Camilla</name>	Camilla	Victoria	[MASK], gazing at her aunt, felt a lurch of love, and claimed for herself a share of her aunt’s present contentment, her ease. She almost wished there were hardships she might save her from, gifts she might give her.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Fraidy	She laughed out loud, in fact, and wished her friend [MASK] was here to hear her laugh. Another woman wrote: “My husband has a very strong physical drive, and expects intimate relations eveiy single night. Is this normal?”
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Alice	“No,” [MASK]’s mother says firmly, this - she pauses -this business has nothing to do with urine. The fluid in question contains seeds which are necessary if the mother is going to grow a baby inside her.
<name>Amusement</name>	Amusement	Tenderness	She gives him a look which is impossible to read. [MASK]? Exasperation? He is suddenly much older than he ever thought he’d be. In a matter of months he’ll turn sixty-five and be forced to retire from the Directorship of the Agricultural Research Institute.
<name>Destiny</name>	Destiny	Accident	[MASK], not history, has called us together, and what an assembly we make. What confusion, what a clamor of inadequacy and portent. Mourners have the power to charge the air with blame, but these are not yet mourners.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Bliss	[MASK] lay in the structure of this simple flower he was attempting to reproduce on a sheet of white rag paper: a petalled organism, complete in itself, obedient to its own rhythms and laws and to none other.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Daisy	Never, in fact. [MASK] has been encouraged to renounce claims on the Hoad estate, and this she has willingly done. She has no need for money. She is comfortable in her present circumstances; she is still reasonably young; and she is not particularly unhappy.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Alice	It sings along the seams of other hurts, especially the old unmediated terror of abandonment. Somewhere along the line she made the decision to live outside of events; or else that decision was made for her. Write a gardening book, her daughter [MASK] advises.
<name>Calcified</name>	Calcified	Stone	A bright, droll, clarifying knowledge comes over her at the thought of her limbs and organs transformed to biblical dust or even funereal ashes. Laughable. [MASK] is how she finally sees herself, her living cells replaced by the insentience of mineral deposition.
<name>Fate</name>	Fate	Chance	Hear, hear! “And now, may I ask you to rise, one and all, and drink to the happiness of our young couple. [MASK] has brought the two of them together, and time has smiled warmly on them both.”
<name>Estelle</name>	Estelle	Alice	“What did you say, [MASK]?” “Nothing. Go to sleep.” “It’s only nine o’clock.” “The light’s fading.” “It’s the curtains, you’ve closed the curtains.” “No, look.
<name>Phyllis</name>	Phyllis	Lordy	“That old gardening basket of hers. That old mildewed thing with the huge hooped handle?” “I think I remember. Vaguely. But why?” “I don’t know. Same reason you got the silver asparagus server, I suppose.” “[MASK].”
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Victoria	A wool suit, a Perma-press blouse and a couple of very, very fine sweaters to switch off with, you won’t need another thing.” “Walking shoes,” [MASK] said on the telephone. “Never mind what they look like.”
<name>Spiegel</name>	Spiegel	Eaton	He had a particular way of putting a thing that disallowed contravention. The new ice box, for instance. He had written away for it, secretly sent an order in to [MASK]’s Mail Order, and now it occupied a comer of the kitchen.
<name>Offred</name>	Offred	Mercy	She gives [MASK] flowers from her garden, sweet peas, nicotiana, dianthus, candytuft, snapdragons. Also lettuce when it’s in season, new radishes, carrots, broad beans. Also pots of berry jam or rhubarb pickle.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	1880	A penciled scrawl. And there are a few photographs too. His wedding photo: a formal pose, [MASK], his young bride seated on a carved studio chair, her hands stiff in her lap, her hair whisked back flat, her expression blank.
<name>Yelena</name>	Yelena	Alice	She wrote me a long, long letter saying she had thought it over and come to the conclusion I was the best person to cheer our mother up, that my presence would be like a “glassful of medicine.” Which is just like [MASK]; she’s someone who always goes around appointing people.
<name>poorhouse</name>	poorhouse	Kaiser	The vast amounts of stone required for this ambitious undertaking have kept the Tyndall Quarry working full-tilt and the stonecutters steadily employed and well out of the [MASK]’s reach. Churches now stand on many of the downtown comers, sometimes two or three different sects represented at one crossing.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Barker	This word, this name, came out in the form of an exhalation, whistling, sour. “Yes,” she said, encouraged. “And your son, [MASK].” The terrible hole of a mouth moved again: “Bark.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Alice	“He had a very long back, your father. I think that’s why he never learned to dance.” “Dancing’s not for everyone.” “I’m glad you’re here, [MASK].” “I’m glad to be here.”
<name>Reenie</name>	Reenie	Mercy	We say we love our husbands, we stand up in church saying as how we’ll love them forever and ever, till death do we part, but it’s our own blood and sinew we really love.” She likes giving [MASK] things.
<name>Spiegel</name>	Spiegel	Eaton	Eighteen karat gold too, ordered through the [MASK]’s catalogue. He remembers that when his young wife died in childbirth two years later, he agonized about whether or not to remove the ring before burial; what was the common practice? What did people do?
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Harold	His father’s untimely demise, I mean, and I believe you have been told the necessary facts. [MASK] finds it upsetting to be reminded of this sad event. I think it best that you don’t refer to his father at all. We never do.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alice	I would like to think that our children will use the word extravagandy, and moreover that they will be open to its forces. ([MASK] does worry me though, the ferocity of her feelings.) Do you remember that day last October when I experienced my first terrible headache?
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alice	What can I do?” Instead they speak of apple juice, gravy, screams in the corridor, the doctor, who is Jamaican - this Jamaican business they don’t actually mention. When [MASK] reaches for her mother’s hand she is appalled by its translucence.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alice	When [MASK] looks into that sigh, or around it, she understands that there’s something chastening about the sound, and also something withheld, some vital piece of information that is being kept back until “she’s old enough.”
<name>Blanche</name>	Blanche	Daisy	Putting on a litde play every single hypocritical day of their lives. And: what can I say to her? What’s left to say? I see you’re still breathing, [MASK]. I see you’re still dusting that nose of yours with Woodbury Face Powder.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Alice	[MASK], from her middle-age perspective, believes her mother to have a soul already spotless - spotless enough anyway - and is outraged to see the spectre of sin visited upon one so old and ill and vulnerable.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	offDaze	I intended to hold nothing back, not even my pitiable little encounter on the train. I persuaded myself that an open confrontation would dislodge whatever it is that has shut [MASK]’s happiness and made her into a crazy woman. But the week was a disaster.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bloomington	“Don’t make me pretend to be lively,” she said to me once when I brought her a lunch tray. “It takes too much effort.” I went home to [MASK] and wrote her a note of monstrous good cheer. About the future.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Daisy	[MASK]’s own eyes fill up in response, but she sighs, knowing her father is about to deliver one of his sonorous and empty speeches. What he doesn’t realize is that his gift of speech is exhausted too. He has entered his baroque period.
<name>Zhenya</name>	Zhenya	Zeus	The prof - everyone calls him [MASK] -said he couldn’t believe I’d managed to get to this level with just two years of high-school Russian. Yes, it’s true, everyone here wears Bermuda shorts all the time, classes and everywhere.
<name>Mrs. Dalloway</name>	Mrs. Dalloway	Alice	She was unpaid. Undervalued. She was nobody. Now look at her. She’s become” - here [MASK] groped for words, waving her hand toward the nodding lilacs - “she’s become, you know, like a real person.”
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	You’renot	I don’t mean to sound so out of sorts.” “[MASK]. You’re-” “It’s all right, you don’t have to say anything.” “I just meant “Really, dear, I mean it, you don’t have to say anything.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Joanie	Just a joke.” ‘“Yolk, yolk,’ you used to say. You and [MASK], clucking like chickens.” “Did we?” “There’s nothing to see from this window.” “Those trees? That lovely garden?”
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Fraidy	“Yes, what?” “Well.” [MASK] looks down at her fresh nail polish. “From the pictures in this little book, it looked as though” - she pauses - “as though they were kissing each other. Down there.”
<name>Bertie</name>	Bertie	Beans	“Personally, I couldn’t stand living in the midst of an ongoing operetta.” “She’s always kissing me. Morning, noon, and night, kissing.” “On the mouth?” “Yes.” “Ugh.” A social shiver from [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Warren	[MASK]'s Theory My mother’s an educated woman but you’d never know it. She has a degree in Liberal Arts from Long College for Women, class of 1926, but ask her where her diploma is and she’ll just give a shrug.
<name>the cat</name>	the cat	Harold	The sneeze is loud, powerful, sudden, an explosion that closes her throat and forces her eyes shut for a fraction of a second. When she opens them again, [MASK] is no longer on the window sill. All she sees is an empty rectangle of glaring light.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Alice	“What is it, [MASK]?” “Nothing, Mother, nothing.” “I thought I heard “Shhhhh. Try to get a little rest.” “All I’ve been doing is resting.”
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Garbo	And she hopes the line of her jaw, like [MASK]’s, conveys a similar attitude. What will she say to him? What will be her first words? A scene offers itself up: she is taking his hand, shaking it gravely, holding herself a little aloof so as not to alarm him.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Spotton	Each time he was able to match a specimen with the illustration in [MASK]’s Botanical Note Book he experienced a spasm of strength. The green world with its varying forms brought out an exotic tolerance in him and kept him calm.
<name>Unbelievable</name>	Unbelievable	Hoad	“What I can’t figure out is why she never told us about this first marriage of hers.” “She must have known we’d find out after she was gone. I mean, the papers are all there. The marriage license and the report and everything.” “[MASK]!
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Alice	“Why the hell not?” [MASK] said in her acquired English accent. “About time you crossed the pond. As long as you stay with me and the kids for a few days coming and going.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Alice	Her present sinking of spirit, the manic misrule of her heart and head, the foundering of her reason, the decline of her physical health - all these stem from some mysterious suffering core which those around her can only register and weigh and speculate about. [MASK]’s
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Harold	How had she known of the impending blindness? Had the specialist confirmed the diagnosis? Had the dead man left a letter of explanation for the family? (It was some years after the event when these questions occurred to [MASK].) But no.
<name>Men's</name>	Men's	Administrative	Women back then were encouraged to take an interest in their husbands’ careers - but it was never clear to me. Not clear. Just what those meetings were about, what they were for.” “[MASK] blather probably.” “It worried me.
<name>Humbert</name>	Humbert	Pve	[MASK] kept track. This is possibly a perverse admission, that I possess a little pocket diary in which I’ve made note of dates, initials, geographical reference points and coded particulars, going back to 1927, such as duration, position, repetition, degree of response, and the like.
<name>Romani</name>	Romani	EngUsh	“Be happy,” he said in Albanian or Turkish or Yiddish, or possibly [MASK]. Then he said it again, be happy, but he felt as though he were blessing a stone, that nothing good could come out of his mouth.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Maria	Once, years ago, her father had mentioned a wedding ring that would one day be hers, but he has not spoken of it since. Perhaps he has given it to his wife, [MASK]. Or perhaps it has merely slipped his mind.
