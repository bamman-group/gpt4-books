<name>the accountant</name>	the accountant	Bhola	The three agents in question worked out that they could probably get their consignments of paper for free, certainly in the short term. In several instances, when invoicing, [MASK] actually forgot how much was owed by whom and when.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Prafullanath	Two things with the power to scrunch [MASK]’s plans into a shapeless paper bag had not occurred to his myopic mind. First, there was a thriving market in second-hand parts and units for existing technology - they did the job - so importing the latest machines at such cost seemed criminally profligate.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Prafullanath	We’re stepping up production there, so we’ll need to hire more workers. Depending on how he does, he could keep an eye on the labour situation for us,’ [MASK] said. ‘I trust you know what I’m trying to say.’
<name>Rajesh</name>	Rajesh	Shobhon	As she stands at the bottom of the stage, between her parents, trying to gather her mind to the gravitas of communal worship, she notices that [MASK] has taken it upon himself to distribute the flowers for anjali to the people gathered for worship.
<name>he</name>	he	Chhaya	What was in his capacity to give her so that she could be whole again, except what he had given them for the span of their fives until now - his food? Would that bring her back from death’s door? That is where [MASK] had been, everyone whispered: death’s door.
<name>he</name>	he	Priyo	If [MASK] had tried, in the past, to answer a few of them with reason and accuracy, he had long since given up, faced with the proliferating queries; now they went in through one ear and left through the other.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Purnima	. could she know? [MASK] fires her final shots. ‘I'm telling you this now, this is your last chance to come to a settlement, otherwise I’ll have walls erected to divide the house.’
<name>Binny</name>	Binny	Purba	[MASK], now in her widow’s white, the vermilion line in the parting of her hair permanently removed using the big toe of her husband’s corpse before it was taken away for cremation, complied with her habitual meekness.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Prafullanath	[MASK] himself was half-frozen with fear at the killings - he had expressly forbidden anyone to leave home - but he had other fears to contend with too. They made him tetchy. His wife’s nagging gave him an excuse to vent his irritation.
<name>Dr. Mortimer</name>	Dr. Mortimer	Prafullanath	‘But he is nearly three years old and he hasn’t said one word,’ [MASK] said. ‘Have you ever come across an adult who doesn’t speak unless he is dumb? And the child isn’t a deaf-mute, I assure you.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Charubala	He would be asked to distract them when they refused to eat. Before long, he was asked to spoon food into their mouths as well. He helped [MASK] when she bathed, dried and put talcum powder on them before easing them into their clothes.
<name>He</name>	He	Samir	He said it because he felt he had to say something. Nobody got up to go on the water-finding mission. [MASK] tried again - Listen, trees need water to survive. How can there be a forest without water? Elementary biology.
<name>Satoru</name>	Satoru	Shankar	[MASK] There was no reaction that could measure up to this, so we let the silence fall. But not a total silence; there was the sound of bamboo leaves shivering in the occasional breeze. But this guilelessness - I've wanted to tell you about it for some time.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Kalyani	[MASK], who does not know about professional caterers, has been awed into silence; awe at the spectacle that this, her first ever wedding, is going to be. All this opulence of saris and caterers serves to intimidate her. 'What? Why so silent?’
<name>Arya</name>	Arya	Samir	As I lowered myself into the freezing water my teeth chattering, my heart beating so fast because of the shock of the cold water that it hurt, [MASK] recited from memory: -All men must die, but death can vary in its significance.
<name>Karl Marx</name>	Karl Marx	Freud	‘All superstructures, including the family, rest on the base of one thing, and one thing only - economics. The family is the first and the primary unit of oppression and exploitation. [MASK] too agrees with this, although his take on it is different.
<name>Mr. Woodhouse</name>	Mr. Woodhouse	Chhaya	[MASK] says, ‘You are shameless, shameless. An animal, a greedy animal out to devour us. I warned everyone about you, the moment I heard your vulgar voice during the matchmaking. This is all so predictable.'
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Adi	We did not have the luxuries of education and universities like your lot. We worked so hard that the sweat from our heads dropped onto our feet. Engineering was no help then . . .’ [MASK]’s attention cut out at this point.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Arunima	When the Don Bosco School bus passes theirs, the girls lean out of the windows to shout in chorus, ‘Donkey Boys, Donkey Boys’, to the boys’ combined retort of ‘Camel Girls, Camel Girls’, but today [MASK], usually an enthusiastic participant, sits in silence.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Ashu	They said they were going to come back Apparently nobody had opened his mouth, when asked about 'some men from outside this village'. - But the men they’ve taken away, what’s going to happen to them? [MASK] asked.
<name>Amir</name>	Amir	Bhola	And let her eat the dried raw mango with black salt that she wanted all the time. It was around this time that [MASK] developed a habit that was, in a more modified form, to mark him for life.
<name>boy</name>	boy	Babu	-This little pissing, [MASK], he said, it's not a good sign. It means something is holding back the water in the sky. It can be held back throughout the season then. He was wrong.
<name>the dark</name>	the dark	Maoists	Besides, the fear of [MASK] means that no one ventures outside after darkness falls. There are no vehicles passing on the dirt road running mostly parallel to the railway line a few hundred metres away, but at this time of night that is normal.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Somnath	A short, sharp cry came out of the woman’s mouth, then silence. The older-looking of the two girls went down on all fours, prostrated herself on the floor and started to lick up the spill. Transfixed, [MASK] and his mother looked on.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Priyo	At the words ‘It’s as if clouds move over the sky of my heart, preventing me from seeing you’, [MASK] felt the bitter taste of treason in his mouth again: it was like cinders, ashy one moment, burning the other.
<name>Uncle Andrew</name>	Uncle Andrew	Dhiren	[MASK] said - Have your fill, there's no tea where we're going, and it wouldn’t do to drink tea anyway when we are with the farmers, because they don't have any and it's considered an urban luxury. Where would they get money to buy tea?
<name>Mr. Biswas</name>	Mr. Biswas	Jaaaah	‘[MASK], load-shedding. Load-shedding, do you see? Again,’ the man says. ‘But no problem, we’ll work in the light of a hurricane lamp, we’ll ask them to send one to the room.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Somnath	Here, take some money,’ [MASK] said, pulling a few crumpled notes out of the pocket of his trousers. ‘Will you be able to find me? It’s so bloody crowded, people are eating each other’s heads . . .’
<name>Joni</name>	Joni	Tagore	both more straightforwardly from the ‘Love’ section of [MASK]’s songbook, she flicked the mood. No one seemed to notice it, no one registered that something about those two songs sounded some off-notes in a celebratory gathering. But her audience was of one.
<name>Uncle Vernon</name>	Uncle Vernon	Prafulla	‘My heart feels ready to burst—’ he began, but [MASK] cut him short. ‘Why have you cut me off from everything?’ he demanded. ‘Going to the shop is forbidden, learning the business hands-on is forbidden . . .
<name>Jack Sparrow</name>	Jack Sparrow	Shekhar	‘Has the rum gone to your head?’ ‘A wife? A son?’ [MASK] continued, following his own train of thought as if the aimless convivial chit-chat had turned into a monologue; his interlocutor had disappeared.
<name>Medusa</name>	Medusa	Purba	A great pall had fallen over the house. The silence in the room was that of unspeakability. A magic circle had been drawn around [MASK]; locked inside it, she instilled fear in everyone outside that malignant aura of the cursed one. Superstition did the rest.
<name>Granny</name>	Granny	Eeesh	I gave her as much as I could. The drought over the last two, three years had been so severe . .. Many people died here, around this area. [MASK], I see her shrunken face in front of me now ...
<name>The Dark One</name>	The Dark One	Madan	When the children were naughty or recalcitrant, and distracting or bribing with toys and games and goodies did not work, [MASK] tamed them with the thrill of fear. 'Don’t go near the guava tree after dark.
<name>Mangal</name>	Mangal	Shekhar	He turned around. It was [MASK], holding out what looked like a pint-bottle. ‘They’re selling mahua,’ he said. 'Have some. It’s killer stuff, not what I was expecting it to be.’
<name>Shalini</name>	Shalini	Charubala	[MASK] was torn between extreme irritation - what a fine time to fall sick! in the middle of a frenetic circus at home, with scores of people, decorators, caterers, guests milling around, everyone rushed off their feet - and the need to put on a mask of caring sympathy.
<name>Chhaya</name>	Chhaya	Prafullanath	Our Chhaya is hardly the blackest imaginable,’ she said. In through the opening [MASK] went, somewhat reluctantly. ‘Y-y-yes, that’s true. But ‘But what?’ ‘But... I mean. . . her. . .
<name>he</name>	he	Suranjan	He had felt a mild sense of embarrassment, shame even, at this memory of hers. Now, if he asks himself whether [MASK] was dressed identically, whether he too was jumping around the place, he cannot come up with an answer; there is only a dark lacuna there.
<name>Offred</name>	Offred	Purnima	The only time [MASK] got to see what the other women in the house possessed was when they dressed formally to go out. She strewed seemingly innocuous questions in their way, hoping to elicit information about how much more they had beyond the fraction they chose to display.
<name>John</name>	John	Dhiren	We'd have to cross these bare fields to get to them. [MASK] said - It'll all appear different at night. They won’t be able to make out one person, dressed in black clothes, running across these fields in the dark.
<name>the Professor</name>	the Professor	Supratik	We may not be learned, but we are content with our lot. I don’t understand your mighty knowledge, and I don’t want to,’ she cried, then felt the flame of her anger snuffed out as [MASK] refused to respond.
<name>Joseph</name>	Joseph	Bankim	[MASK]'s wife cried out - Please let us go, spare us, spare the little children, they’ve done no wrong .. . I took an instant decision not to tell her about her husband. She would find out soon enough.
<name>Keats</name>	Keats	Samir	That green! How could the chemistry of brown seeds and grey-red-black mud have produced this green, which seemed almost boiling up out of the earth? I too felt like reciting the lines that had [MASK]'s heart, but I restrained myself.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Arunima	Sometimes I felt that the haves in our society became giant magnets and, following some law of physics or astronomy transposed to human affairs, sucked in more and more, enlarging their states. You know that [MASK] goes to a missionary school, so she has to study the Bible.
<name>Nora</name>	Nora	Sandhya	But something gives and the person who has most to lose by not playing it cautiously liberates herself from this mummery of fear and calculation: [MASK] repeats her earlier whisper, but this time it lets itself loose as a scream, ‘Please leave him, please let him go!
<name>Moody</name>	Moody	Dipankar	They had walked for miles at night, for hands-on lessons - [MASK] called them ‘practicals’ - on far-flung railway tracks running through land that was so devoid of human habitation for miles around that they had sometimes felt they were on the moon.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Dhiren	How can there be a forest without water? Elementary biology. [MASK] said -Trees have deep root systems to draw water from the ground. Elementary biology, level two. My headache was like somebody poking around in the soft tissue behind my right eye with a hot knitting needle.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Madan	Cutting off the nose to spite one’s face - if, at the age of seventy, one doesn’t understand how stupid it is, I wonder when one will.’ [MASK] leaves for the kitchen; it is best not to offer himself as a conducting rod.
<name>her</name>	her	Dulal	But it was all couched in the language of feelings for your near and dear ones, as you are doing now. Punish him, he’s done great wrong, but don’t abandon me, you said then. Did you ever think of [MASK]?
<name>Nandigram</name>	Nandigram	Adi	What [MASK] could count on was the power of denial: the word ‘Naxalite’ was like leprosy; it turned you into an untouchable instantly; no one would want to come anywhere near it. The whisky has begun to give him sour eructations.
<name>Nawab</name>	Nawab	Priyo	She has evidence of something rather more urgent right under her nose, in the form of that mocking tangail sari. If [MASK] can buy his wife four saris - at least four saris -and his daughter ten outfits, then giving her one sari is like a slap to her face.
<name>Seymour</name>	Seymour	Swarnendu	[MASK] is a very pure example of that. There is an innocence about him which the world has not been able to touch. He still lives with his mother, who came out to join him shortly after he was offered his teaching position in the Faculty.
<name>him</name>	him	Madan	She did not exactly reveal to him what had brought this on, only giving some vague hints within the general hand-wringing about ‘fallen girls’ and ‘loose morals’, leaving [MASK] to read between the lines.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Som	thirteen . . . thirteen . . . fourteen . . . no, no, you moved too quickly . . . ten . . . eleven . . .’ [MASK] said, ‘You said thirteen many times. It’s fourteen after thirteen.’
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Dhiren	He was always playing this game of one-upmanship with me; his way of reducing the distance between us, I suppose. There had been several times in the past when I'd had to bite my tongue to stop myself from saying - [MASK], it’s
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Dhiren	[MASK] said - Not bad at all. From 'auspicious symbol' to ‘symbol’ only. Who wants to be auspicious? Bloody cant of the bourgeois ****ers! I, too, thought: Not bad, this loss of weight in the name.
<name>one</name>	one	Purba	Now that seems so much more preferable to the distraction and melancholy and secret bouts of silent weeping, checked, as soon as [MASK] is caught out, with a pathetic, ‘I always cry when I’m chopping onions’ when there is no onion anywhere in sight.
<name>he</name>	he	Adi	But that undone drawing of the interior of a house, something that [MASK] later came to know was called something as simple as a plan, never found realisation in the expected father-son duet; it had to be learned, understood and executed as a solo.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Ashish	As if on cue, another cry went up: We’re not listening to the false promises of the owners. We shan’t listen. Not listening! Shan’t listen! The people churned. [MASK] whispered something to a man standing next to him.
<name>Mrs. Ramsay</name>	Mrs. Ramsay	Charubala	‘Electrical shop?’ [MASK] seemed surprised. ‘How on earth are we going to find him an electrical shop? And what do you mean: working in someone else’s shop or setting up his own?’
<name>Madame Rosmerta</name>	Madame Rosmerta	Priyo	‘Just one or two, one or two. Not very well known, not yet, but one day they will be, mark my words.’ ‘But of course!' [MASK] says. ‘If you have foreseen their fame, not even fate can stop them.’
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Baba	Go on, show me. And you’re still a minor and a dependant.’ ‘No, I'm not, I’m nineteen. And you beat me like a dog because you are burning with envy, you have always known that [MASK] loved me more.’
<name>Mr. Lorry</name>	Mr. Lorry	Manmathnath	‘In the jewellery trade,’ [MASK] used to repeat like a favourite chant, ‘experience is everything, the first-hand, touched-by-your-skin, seen-with-your-eyes experience of handling gold and jewels - that is the greatest education.’
<name>Blanche</name>	Blanche	Nandita	It is devoid of every single trace of benignity or kindness; she looks the sort to lead a rabble to arson, robbery or vigilante violence. Another woman, clad only in petticoat and blouse and exposing a generous stretch of her cushiony midriff, envelops [MASK].
<name>manimela</name>	manimela	Vikramjit	They went to manimela together and sang 'Touch my soul with the touchstone of fire’ in a chorus of about a dozen boys. Where is [MASK] now? He does not know; he has fallen out of touch, drifted apart from these childhood affinities and friendships.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Chhaya	It had the effect of a kind of psychological terrorism - people around her became hyper-conscious of what they were saying or doing, or not saying and not doing, because [MASK]’s susceptible, paranoid mind could alight on anything she chose and make it into a cause for war.
<name>Uncle Tom</name>	Uncle Tom	Som	It’s a game for grown-ups.’ That reeled [MASK] in. ‘No, no, I play too. And I want New Market biscuits.’ He seemed on the verge of kicking up a noisy tantrum.
<name>Capone</name>	Capone	Watson	When it did, he stuck a pistol through the open window and fired; incredibly, he missed. The subsequent attempt was a more elaborate affair. A carload of men pulled up behind [MASK]'s car and showered it with bullets.
<name>Uma</name>	Uma	Somnath	The Ghosh family unwittingly followed this paradigm with slavishness. The existence of four brothers and one sister, with a gap of twelve years separating the oldest from the youngest, meant that the siblings, with the exception of [MASK], were close in age.
<name>Sylvia</name>	Sylvia	Chhaya	It is [MASK], as always, with her infallible talent for neatly isolating the afflicted nerve and aiming for it, who gives voice to the greater shame: ‘How strange that our recently discovered mathematics genius should be helping out other boys in the neighbourhood and not his own cousin.
<name>John</name>	John	Prafullanath	They were surrounded by their former employees or, more accurately, the whole workforce that they had fired ten months ago. A current of fear thrilled through him. [MASK], however, seemed to be buoyant on rage.
<name>Bijaya</name>	Bijaya	Baishakhi	The sweets are distributed and the stricken looks resulting from [MASK]’s intransigence two days ago - it is difficult to estimate where the genuine strickenness ends and its self-conscious enactment begins - are relaxed enough to allow the usual bijaya practices to proceed.
<name>they</name>	they	Nitai	He would boil and eat them in the hope that a fleck or two of tenacious grain had clung on to the stalk-tips here and there. This is what they did in times of famine. This is what [MASK] did here last year.
<name>Godzilla</name>	Godzilla	Senapati	Then we were lifted up by the wave I had always thought was the shape of this kind of event and it happened very quickly, all the actions fitting into a portion of time that had itself become compressed into a hair-thin sheet. [MASK] turned and started to walk towards us.
<name>She</name>	She	Purnima	[MASK] bleats, ‘I brought my precious things home for the wedding, then . . . then I didn’t find the time to return them to the bank. Or the chance.’ ‘You didn’t find the time? Who do you think you are?
<name>John</name>	John	Prafullanath	But what harm can a couple of pieces do? Want some with your tea now? Could quickly sneak in a couple for you, no one would be any the wiser.’ [MASK] blows on his tea, thereby avoiding answering the question.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Supratik	[MASK] loses all track of time, all ability to react, until god knows after how long their mother enters the room and panics. ‘What’s happened? What’s happened? Why are you lying on the floor? Have you been fighting?
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Tapati	‘O ma,’ she had said, ‘shall I try on a squirt now or leave it for a special occasion? It’s [MASK]’s wedding next week, I’ll wear it then. Where did you get it?’ 'On the black market.
<name>Ammachi</name>	Ammachi	Chhaya	[MASK] is the first to realise that the girl has witnessed everything. Her frustration finds an easy target; she starts scolding her niece - ‘What? You still here? How many times have you been told not to remain sitting in a room when the elders are discussing something?
<name>Barack</name>	Barack	Sona	[MASK], electrically alive from the earliest time that he can remember to being excluded to the margins, from where he watched everyone else get their share while he only looked on in silence, has sniffed this politics of mean-mindedness in the air from the moment he walked in on his first class.
<name>Lady Tressilian</name>	Lady Tressilian	Purnima	Or can he bring himself to do both with equal ease? Can he? [MASK] is first heard screaming, then rushing around from floor to floor. 'My jewellery’s gone! All my jewellery’s been stolen - all. Clean missing from my safe.
<name>Orwell</name>	Orwell	Samir	[MASK] wasn't quiet for very long - Yes, that may well be true, but the Chinese peasantry is not illiterate like their Bengali counterpart, so writing amidst them wouldn't have stood out so much. CHAPTER FIVE
<name>we</name>	we	Priyo	How [MASK] would like to turn that against him. The generation that builds is also the generation that destroys; the next generation is only the audience outside the invisible fourth wall, watching the antics of its elders puffing themselves up with hubris then getting deflated, like balloons four days after a child’s birthday party.
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Madan	When the constables enter the sitting room, all four of them, they are adamant about taking [MASK] away. ‘For questioning,' they say. 'What are these questions that have to be asked in the police station?’
<name>Kafka</name>	Kafka	Supratik	It seems to [MASK] that they forget about him for days, he is not sure how many. In that time he can only think and dream about the purple-bordering-on-black butt-end of one of his comrade’s fingers.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Priyo	The thought of duplicates of her rings and bracelets and necklaces lying in another almirah in the same house, but on a different floor, makes her feel slightly queasy. And all the saris given by [MASK] too? She has lost count of them.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Priyonath	‘You showing us the heat and dazzle of your money? We seeing it all, sister-fucker. You can buy everything with money?’ With a jolt, [MASK] notices that she has descended into addressing him as tui, the irreverent version of ‘you’.
<name>Maya</name>	Maya	Kalyani	She seems on the verge of saying something, but thinks better of it and starts desultorily going through the saris again, gets bored with this too and walks up to the window again. ‘Are you excited that there’s going to be a wedding in this house?’ she asks [MASK].
<name>Medea</name>	Medea	Chhaya	In one neat bundling, [MASK] threw back onto the face of the world, like spit, all that it had arrayed against her. She had been born into a melodramatic world; melodrama was the tool she used to banish it from her.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Euclid	It’s a reductio ad absurdum, Latin, meaning, literally, to reduce to the point of absurdity, to the point of absurdity. [MASK] loved this method. It is one of the finest weapons in the mathematician’s drawer, one of the finest, the finest.’
<name>Meena</name>	Meena	Nandita	Right now, give your shirt-pant,’ she orders, then snatches the trousers from his hand. She turns the pockets out: side, front, back. One hundred and seven rupees, eighty paise. The hundred-rupee note was for [MASK], payment substantially above her standard fee.
<name>Chief</name>	Chief	Bir	[MASK] said - Lock-up for a few days, a little bit of beating to find out who was behind killing those dogs. The police are in their pay, so they'll make an effort. If the dogs are all killed, who’ll pay them bribes?
<name>sniping</name>	sniping	Dipankar	did they have guns? - would take through our circumscribing circle, and the image of them as a moving diameter came into my head. It was absurd. But what if they were nearer one arc than another? And what if they were out of range for [MASK]?
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Fucker	He then begins to pull the skin, held by the corner that he has loosened, along the crescent of blood, bit by slow bit. An old-fashioned flaying is in progress. '[MASK]'s screaming as if he's being slaughtered!'
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Chhaya	From here, it climbed down further to white-collar worker, bank-teller, government employee, school teacher, even, at the final, desperate stages, clerk. When even this didn’t produce a husband for [MASK], other variables were tinkered with and revised.
<name>Zawadi</name>	Zawadi	Purnima	The queen lioness in the valley of lions where she, [MASK], is a calf? That. . . that walking capsule of poison? Why would she give her daughter this amazing heirloom piece of jewellery? ‘You’re not lying?’
<name>Shylock</name>	Shylock	Senapati	and he had to borrow money from [MASK] - it was an informal side-business that most landlords had, to earn a little extra something, or to manoeuvre themselves into ever more powerful, ever more advantageous positions - for buying food and for his wife's treatment.
<name>the company</name>	the company	Prafullanath	Second, the well-established paper manufacturers in the country - the competition, that is - had played the game with older machines for so long that there appeared to be no clear advantage to what [MASK] was setting out to do.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Charubala	[MASK] thought that she had turned away to avoid being seen to cry, to appear weak. A long-buried memory shifted in her mind, of an afternoon when this daughter, then much younger, had looked into her soul and confronted her with an insuperable choice.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Charubala	Let’s leave her to stew in her own poison.’ ‘Did you hear what she said?’ [MASK] asks. ‘Lawyers, litigation . . . Is this what has been lurking in that cesspit of your venomous mind?’ ‘Cesspit? Poison?
