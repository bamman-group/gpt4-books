<name>Abbey</name>	Abbey	Ini	[MASK] grinned. 'But the very fact that the trees and shrubs and rocks and water and air and the people breathing it are here means that the wildness is in already. And the wall is not all solid, either.
<name>Artemis</name>	Artemis	Pryn	Where two crossed, water whirled, swirled, rushed out by the walls. A wall fell . . . ? No, a mud bank broke from stone, to slosh off between the ruins. [MASK] saw them first as a row of regular eruptions in the rush.
<name>Rider</name>	Rider	pryn	Dragon wings rose, which meant those green membranes between the long bones would not tear on the branches. But they were falling — no, still gliding. She swallowed air. The dragon tilted, beating back against her own flight — [MASK] rocked against the bony neck.
<name>the little girl from the Kolhari market</name>	the little girl from the Kolhari market	Pryn	He looked at [MASK] through his fantastic make-up — then smiled! 'Oh ... the little girl from the Kolhari market! How in the world did you end up in this forsaken backwater?' The recognition made hope leap. 'Well, I —'
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Reins	[MASK] flicked again as they rumbled along the boisterous avenue. 'Toss the two of them out, the ungrateful minx and her odious kitten! That's what I should do — what I would do if I were some uncivil aristocrat with a host of red-scarfed servants.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sarg	Finally he refused to wear it any longer. Nor did I press him to it — since he allowed it to me. But as [MASK] wore the collar less and less by night, I could not help notice the change in the way he wore it by day.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Rorkar	'Let me have a look.' [MASK] lifted the bolted disks and turned them, squinting. 'It's good work. Local work. Old work, too — like something that could well have been made around here, from the marks on it.
<name>Mr. Mason</name>	Mr. Mason	Tratsin	You'd best get back to your spinning — and after you take this to [MASK] at the workshop, you can come back and have something to eat. You'll eat supper with us here tonight, too, before you go . . . ?
<name>John</name>	John	Pryn	He laughed again and guided his horse around a branch fallen on the road. Other hooves smashed leaves. 'That's why we three go to —' 'Move your hand!' [MASK] shoved the naked rider's arm from where it had again risen.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Pryn	Yes, there's something I very much want to ask.' [MASK] looked again out between the sword-bearing columns at the inlet. The sky's blue had visibly deepened over half its vault. 'What city was that out in the water?'
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Tritty	From her couch, [MASK] ladled dark gravy over an impressive roast on a tray held by a young, white-collared woman with very wide shoulders, who took the meat off to a side table where an older man, with the same white collar, waited, carving knives poised. '
<name>Handwriting</name>	Handwriting	Rylla	But your writing, [MASK], in the shaping of your signs, is atrocious! There were words I was not even sure of that night!' 'As you wrote to me. Several times. And I've tried to do better.'
<name>Earl</name>	Earl	Pryn	The sound was sharp, astonishing, unsettling, a single syllable of laughter, for which [MASK] realized there was no written sign. She looked at the earl, who'd uttered it. Such a laugh was clearly the extension of that distressing smile. '
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jade	But we had our business that had to be gone over that night. So I took a waxed writing board and scratched you a note —' ' — and, trembling, I scratched one back to you.' [MASK] smiled. '
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Pryn	The dress was finished at sleeves and hem and scooped neck with bits of something shiny that may have been gold or may have been red. The way they flashed and flickered, [MASK] couldn’t tell. The woman's toes pushed and poked from the glittering hem.
<name>partner</name>	partner	Tetya	But here, a few hundred yards or so beyond what she had, once again, assumed to be the end of the world, was a major crossroads — or at least the traces of one. And a great caravan had just rolled by it. 'Where are we, here, [MASK]?'
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Pryn	'What are you doing here, mountain girl?' the great man asked in a voice that, for all its roughness, bore a city accent. 'Looking . . . for someone —' [MASK] stammered. It seemed she must answer something. '
<name>Meursault</name>	Meursault	Raven	[MASK] and I once visited that monastery — it's still there today. And there are still priests — at least there were when we went. Now, I'm not sure. Anyway, you could certainly tell that the place had seen better times.
<name>John</name>	John	Ergi	What they approached now, however, baffled her. In an area at least as large as the market proper, there were many more workers than there were roaming the square. Clearly this was where [MASK]'s foremanship centered.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Pryn	'I said, "His Lordship seems a man comfortable with all peoples, a fine and good person."' [MASK] realized, as one who could write, that this was not what she had said at all. 'Oh. Well . . .
<name>Marion</name>	Marion	Pryn	'Oh,' [MASK] said. 'Yes. I guess we'd better go.' She stood up, tom between the discomfort of rejection and the relief at leaving the hot, fishy shack. 'I'm sure I'll be all right . . .'
<name>Da Vinci</name>	Da Vinci	Venn	We should be going down to supper shortly. I've told you the history of this chamber — but [MASK]'s "engine" was put together downstairs where we shall be eating. Perhaps we should discuss it there?'
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tetya	Why should a man's marraige be anyone's affair but his own — it's not as if I were some witless fool — like your father, [MASK] — or my own father, for that matter, who needed a master to tell him in which wench he'd do best to look for offspring.
<name>Daenerys</name>	Daenerys	Pryn	How would you get an answer to that question in this city — ' the brow lowered — 'other than by asking?' 'But you don't understand,' [MASK] said. Somehow she could no longer repress it. 'I've ridden a dragon!
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Sarg	Perhaps we should wait? Or move on? But no, [MASK] said; why not strike again — I didn't want him to wear the collar, he claimed, laughing. Obviously I was jealous of his wearing it.
<name>David</name>	David	Belham	At any rate: My father, surprised, dropped the inking stick, I recall — people did not usually thrust things into his hand that way. [MASK] snatched it up off the floor, paced back and forth, tossed the stick onto the grid, some ten, fifteen, twenty-five times.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Pryn	But it's part of the engine— my husband said he was explaining it upstairs? We have a vested interest, of course. I'm sure you can understand . . .' [MASK]'s gaze lost itself in her shimmering drink. '
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Pryn	Twelve" — and while we're at it, "forty-nine" is a little high for the main cave. We'll make that "forty" and start over again, all right? And no more mistakes.' 'Yes,' [MASK] said.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Pryn	She put the pot down. Holding the little cup just under her chin in both hands, she blew on it, sipped, smiled — [MASK] drew back beyond the edge of the window as the woman turned slightly. The woman blew again; sipped again.
<name>Tyrion</name>	Tyrion	Pryn	Then they went. [MASK] followed the giant into the next room with even more torches on the walls — these in iron cages. Perhaps twenty-five men were there; and half a dozen women. Some who had been sitting on benches now stood. All looked.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Pryn	'I might not be alive if she weren't!' 'So I've heard.' Despite the fruit's hardness, [MASK]'s teeth, in the next bite, touched pit. 'I suppose I'm not that happy to be here either.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Rylla	But it's true, [MASK]! You are always in public — even within your own gardens: you are always prepared for some fancied spy to observe you from the bushes, overhear you from the eaves.' '
<name>Lily</name>	Lily	Pryn	A memory of her great-aunt returned, in which the old woman wrung her hands. 'If your father could only see you . . .' When [MASK] was a baby, her father had died in the army somewhere to the south — of a sudden peacetime fever outbreak rather than wartime wounds.
<name>Luna</name>	Luna	Pryn	[MASK] blinked. 'Yes.' She thought: I'll just say 'yes' to everything anyone asks until a dragon plucks me up and away and I'm gone . . . 'It's an awfully long walk back from his Lordship's estate/
<name>Mr. Lorry</name>	Mr. Lorry	Rorkar	'Of course I shall never do it.' [MASK] looked into his mug. 'I'm not a joking man. Never had time for jokes — not with the brewery, here. But it would be a joke, now. If I did it.
<name>Christopher Robin</name>	Christopher Robin	Pryn	and some honey with it. But myself, I never take honey with my fruit in the morning — still, if you want, I'll go back . . . ?' 'Oh, thank you,' [MASK] said. '
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Vatry	And I don't want to stay to find out why — and no, I saw no woman here. Did she give you a sack? I certainly didn't see it! What was in it? I wouldn't have a clue!' [MASK] looked serious.
<name>Eilley</name>	Eilley	Pryn	The auxiliary cave, [MASK] realized as she stood among the men and women along the cave wall, listening to barrels bang, could easily have filled twelve or thirteen, given the number of wide, wooden, first-fermentation settling troughs foaming over the floor.
<name>Abby</name>	Abby	Alyx	I've got too many other things to think about if I want to keep this troupe together. Now if your friend here could write down words and keep accounts like [MASK] — but she's only an ignorant mountain girl who's somehow gotten herself lost in the country.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Vatry	[MASK], there may be other people after me too. What ancient custom I violated or bit of intrigue I might have tripped over, I don't begin to understand and don't want to. But they tried to poison me last night! At least I think they did.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Tritty	Really, to visit them — I mean to live with them for a time and assume their ways, it's practically a religious experience.' [MASK] looked at the earl. 'You said that, dear.' Pulling his cloak around him, the earl stepped up. '
<name>Dr. Kennicott</name>	Dr. Kennicott	Pryn	When she came, she looked like a sun-shriveled apricot. I thought we were going to lose her. But she's seemed to rally. And she's been so good through it all!' 'How old is she?' [MASK] asked.
<name>the Liberator</name>	the Liberator	Pryn	Beyond his blocky knee, the Liberator looked down at her, while [MASK] wondered at her demotion from young woman to child. She looked out again at the Red Badger, who, with his big mouth, missing teeth, and new beard, had gotten her into the first trouble of her journey.
<name>they</name>	they	Pryn	Presenting such facts to strangers who would not contest them, rather than avoiding mention of them in a neighborhood that had snickered over them and distrusted them and doubted them since before [MASK] had been bom, was elating. '
<name>She</name>	She	Jade	Why must you do anything else? Now you leave us with the responsibility of carrying out your desires —' [MASK] suddenly drew herself up and turned back angrily. 'What do you want me to do?' 'What do I want you to do ... ?'
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Tritty	You know it's customary for the daughters and the sons of outlying nobility, when they reach age seventeen or eighteen —' When I was a girl, it was fourteen or fifteen,’ [MASK] said. 'But they expected more of children back then.'
<name> I </name>	I	Pryn	Some chairs stood along one wall, a few piled one on another. Was this some kind of balcony storeroom in which she'd been housed? Well, it wasn't a dungeon. All the dungeons [MASK] had ever heard of were in basements, not on balconies.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Pryn	I just don't understand —' 'You know that we were slavery-fighters together. It was simply more efficient to have one of us working from within the slave gangs.' Yes,’ [MASK] said. 'But certainly that's not what he meant by . . .'
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Reddish	Clearly they hadn't gotten their money back.' 'Are the priests still wicked?' [MASK] brows lowered. 'Well, I doubt if either my friend or I would ever stop there again — unless we absolutely had to.'
<name>She</name>	She	Pryn	And [MASK] got chills. Chills surged the backs of her shoulders, tickled her thighs. She wanted very much to be somewhere else, and at the same time to move seemed impossible — which only made the feeling more intense, more unsettling. The chills came on and on.
<name>Conrad</name>	Conrad	Pryn	The garden there is no longer tended at all. His soldiers stamp along the balustrades. Now and again someone rides up to shout an incomprehensible message, and someone rides away . . .' 'Do you know,' [MASK] began, 'your . . .
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Pryn	([MASK] glanced at the ceiling and thought of the tavern above. Had it been anywhere near the size of this subterranean vastness?) 'It's good to see so many familiar faces — and good to see so many new ones!' The foot moved a little.
<name>Esmeralda</name>	Esmeralda	Pryn	Well, it's not the first time for us. I doubt it'll be the last.' Besides her dictation, accounting, and dialogue coaching duties, at their next performance stop, the director told her, [MASK] would take a few gold coins into the audience.
<name>Velma</name>	Velma	Pryn	[MASK] hooked the jug handle on two fingers and started along the road, repeating: nivu, nivu, nivu . . . which, among the things she'd thought last night, she'd decided did not have to mean either food or sex.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Pryn	Holding it with both fists, though, she couldn't close it all the way; so she took it off again and stuck it around her sash, closed there, pulling enough cloth through to cover it. [MASK] walked back among the benches toward the building comer.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Tratsin	[MASK] pulled on the oars. 'My wife,' he added, by way of explanation, 'I mean. She's having it. For me.' Taut; slack. 'It's been all girls so far — this will be my third.
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Pryn	[MASK] glanced at the two empty pots, which had been raised to higher hooks above the fireplacke's ash-banked embers. 'The soup we had, last night. I was just thinking —' 'Ah!'
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Tratsin	No sense of play at all, I tell you!' He took the food bowl from her and, holding it against his hip, followed [MASK] down. 'Must all the good people in the world be like that?'
<name>She</name>	She	Pryn	[MASK] started to ask, But how did you know7., then decided that if she were going to hear the end, she'd best stop interrupting. Besides, it was the teller's tale; the teller ought to know what happened in it, for all her multiple versions.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Pryn	A few inches further on, there was another crater as if, in the hand's pulling loose, some extra clot had come out too. [MASK] bent to look at the bottom bowl. The water seemed to have scooped out quite a gouge.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Pryn	Then she scrambled awkwardly to her wide feet, pulled her dress up over her dark-aureoled breasts, stuck her yellow arms through the ragged holes, turned and hurried toward the trees. Bent nearly double, she was among them; was within them; was gone. [MASK] stood.
<name>she</name>	she	Ardra	But she said people saw different ones in different parts of the country. And I never could remember their names, anyway, so I don't know if —' 'I haven't seen her,' [MASK] said. 'You haven't seen her either.
<name>Jamie</name>	Jamie	Ardra	Otherwise, I'd have seen as little of this wild and wondrous land as any village girl. My first husband was [MASK]'s father. The rest of the children are the earl's by his former wife — now they're a little older than you.
<name>Leia</name>	Leia	Pryn	'It's only a question for myself.' [MASK] blinked. 'That barbarian, the one your . . . friend there killed. Before he died, he said you . . . sold him. As a slave. Was that true?' Yes.'
<name>Unknown</name>	Unknown	Pryn	Up the nearer slope was the workers' barracks, where she slept. Down there was the office shed. She remembered taking a momentary account: her name was [MASK] — she did know how to write it. In the pockets of her dress were ...
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Pryn	Which halted the boy at the stone rail. Will you give me fourteen? You give me fourteen, and I'll . . .' [MASK] looked over at the water below. Two women, a soldier between, made their way over the rocks.
<name>Xena</name>	Xena	Pryn	You think she is ruler here . . . ?' Suddenly another thought seized her, and she dropped her arms and straightened her back. [MASK] thought she was about to leave and said: 'You're a barbarian, aren't you?'
<name>Strider</name>	Strider	Pryn	You may be a spy. We can't take chances.' [MASK] walked across the road toward his horse. 'You don't give me much choice.' The scarred man said: 'Sit in front of me.'
<name>she</name>	she	Pryn	They all thought the song was moving, even though they didn't know what it was about. And [MASK], for herself, decided night in the city was not so bad after all. But why, she wondered, were they leaving tomorrow at sunrise?
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Tratsin	To do, to make, to change something with your hands —' 'Certainly any slave must feel better for his slaving, eh?' 'Well,' said [MASK], 'that's what you always say to me when we have this argument.
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Pryn	Somehow I just thought you were a boy. And an older boy at that. Come in.' She put the cloth down on a bench at the wall and started off through a doorway. [MASK] followed down a passage, one wall of which was stone.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Tratsin	[MASK] seemed to be having the same trouble, himself, finding these alleged 'abandoned huts,' because he laughed now. 'They were here a couple of days ago, I know! Don't tell me someone came along and tore them down . . .'
<name>Mrs. Hopewell</name>	Mrs. Hopewell	Bragan	[MASK] put the mat down — almost on the napping baby; she cried out, moved it aside, laughed, put her hand to her neck, blinked, and went on: 'But you'll have a roof over you. That's better than nothing.
<name>Topsy</name>	Topsy	Pryn	A faint frown on her round, brown face, [MASK], in her new green shift, descended to the lower garden. She wandered about the grounds a while without seeing anyone else. Once she heard voices — more servants? She thought to push through the hedge to see.
<name>Nessa</name>	Nessa	Bruka	The slave-woman was draining the mug — the gentleman realized it, too. His bushy eyebrows rose. Consternation worked into the lines around his lips and eyes before amusement blurred it. 'That was good, my lord!' [MASK] wiped her mouth with her wrist.
<name>Clarisse</name>	Clarisse	Pryn	[MASK] grabbed a stylus from the seashell, scratched 'fifty-one' and 'two,' then dashed out. Would it be a great wagon with six horses like the ones that had rumbled past her the afternoon at the crossroads, when she had first heard the earl's name?
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Pryn	'You don't use nearly as many women as you do men.' Looking over the workers around the site, [MASK] pictured herself coming into the city — by some other road, as it were — arriving at the market as a seeker after work rather than as the owner's guest.
<name>Betty</name>	Betty	Pryn	If they weren't talking, then you'd move!' "What if they're talking about you?' asked a pretty girl who'd given [MASK]'s friend a rag dampened with vinegar to hold against her bruise.
<name>Mustapha</name>	Mustapha	Rorkar	He's got a third, now, the youngest of the lot.' [MASK] humphed. 'When I tell a worker what suitor she should choose to give us good sons and daughters, the woman and her mate stay together. A mate for appearances!
<name>Euclid</name>	Euclid	Belham	The earl took an inking stick from a seashell on the shelf below the diagram. 'With this inking stick [MASK] drew this very diagram I have just shown you. Using this stick as a pointer, he explained his problem.
<name>Conan</name>	Conan	Earl	But as long as I can keep clear the principles by which the present orders itself, I suppose that's why I stay one of the most powerful of the remaining, real barbarian princes — "[MASK]" is the title the northern aristocracy has granted us.
<name>Nat Turner</name>	Nat Turner	Sarg	Yet to put on the collar and walk into a group of slaves and their masters seemed to throw [MASK] into a kind of trance, a strangely reckless state where ecstasy and obliviousness, daring and distraction, were one with bravery itself.
<name>Barbarian</name>	Barbarian	Pryn	She twisted her head to look up at a very thin blade coming out of a rough-out leather sheath, rising in a leather-bound fist. The barbarian was suddenly in front of her, only this stranger in the way. [MASK] heard body and body smack.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Pryn	We'll be using one of the informal receiving chambers this evening. I know the Large Hall is more impressive, but really — anything less than a hundred guests and you feel simply lost.' She turned [MASK] toward a side door, over which a stone beast arched. '
<name>Abner</name>	Abner	Bragan	If I net together a vine-fiber sack and bring it back filled with pears, [MASK] might make us a fine cobbler with supper this evening, and let that stand me for work — though the kids around here would call it play.'
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Pryn	Licking sticky fingers, [MASK] thought she heard sounds in another part of the house. She stepped out the door. Yes, somewhere on another floor, someone was shouting at someone who was trying to quiet her. She looked over the rail at the inner court.
<name>Laurence</name>	Laurence	Pryn	Yet [MASK] soon saw, when their canvas-covered cart came to any stream or stretch of rough road, however much he claimed to detest it, the scrawny, wall-eyed one labored with an energetic earnestness that should have shamed his bigger, bearded, pit-cheeked companion.
<name>Dany</name>	Dany	Pryn	Be on your way!' Confused, [MASK] slid her foot back, up, and over, then dropped to the cobbles, with the sore knees and tingling buttocks of a novice rider — dragons notwithstanding. She stepped back from the moving legs, looking up.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Pryn	'Have you determined how they work?' [MASK] frowned. 'I just assumed that ... up there, the water in those four pools runs down through some kind of pipes to the four fountains on the bridge below the falls . . . ?'
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Vatry	Well, as I remember, you don't play the drum very well. You're obviously not a dancer. Can you sing?' 'I never —' 'Then you're not a singer.' He turned to [MASK]. '
<name>the rider</name>	the rider	Pryn	And the women's course veered closer than even [MASK] had expected — One of the servants gave a small shriek. The horses reared. The white-haired woman turned in startled anger. She stepped back, hands down in blowing blue.
<name>He</name>	He	Pryn	Though I still don't trust him — however it looks! I'm not saying you should or you shouldn't. He's invited you for dinner. It's up to you. What could be special about it, anyway?' [MASK] blinked.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Rorkar	Sometimes she would arrive for the encounter already wearing the shocking iron — that she would get a smith to forge for her from the growing collection of small coins under her straw pallet with which [MASK] was paying her. Well, she didn't have quite enough just yet . . .
<name>Malvolio</name>	Malvolio	Badger	[MASK]! Dirty shoat! You think you're in some barbarian shambles? This is a decent home, with decent people living in it! I suppose you'd do that if his Lordship invited you to his home too!'
<name>Smaug</name>	Smaug	Dragons	Don't I know it!' The ox took another step. The cart's plank wheels made brief noises among themselves and on small stones. The ox blinked at the dragon, which stood now, one foreclaw raised. [MASK] sometimes stood like that a long time.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Ini	Oh, I call her that in anger. But not really. I don't think she's silly at all.' 'She's very upset now.' [MASK] pulled her feet beneath her. 'She's very unhappy and confused.'
<name>Zeb</name>	Zeb	Everybody	Ahead on the road, another wagon full of men and women was just rolling off north. [MASK] was in a good mood. Half a dozen men stood at the road side, bending and hooting with laughter at a story from a heavy woman at the wagon's edge.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Rorkar	In fact, I think by now it's even died out there. [MASK] must have kept those poor people picking and poking a whole month or more with his own "suddenly remembered" versions of this or that old tale.'
<name>Johnsy</name>	Johnsy	Tratsin	She would have, too, if she'd been wandering alone in the mountains and not carrying dinner to a working man. Perhaps she might put [MASK]'s bowl down for a few minutes and explore that cut there where the gray rock turned out and, losing all vegetation, went russet.
<name>Daenerys</name>	Daenerys	Pryn	(Leaning against the fur-covered arm of the throne, [MASK] shifted her hip and wondered just how this little man thought a woman's body was to be used.) 'The next day, even the guards declared 1 was too far gone to go down into the pit.
