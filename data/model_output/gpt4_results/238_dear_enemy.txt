<name>haste</name>	haste	G	Our first thought was not to stop the fire, but to get the children to a place of safety. We began in [MASK], and went from crib to crib, snatching a baby and a blanket, and rushing them to the door, and handing them out to the Indians, who lugged them downstairs.
<name>Snodgrass</name>	Snodgrass	Sterry	He knows how useful those gardens are going to be, and how worse than useless [MASK] was. Also says he, "The superintendent's authority must be upheld." (That, incidentally, is beautiful, coming from him.) But anyway, those were his words.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Hattie	As for poor little [MASK], here she is back again, after going out with such high hopes. It has an awfully bad moral effect on a child to be returned to the asylum in disgrace, especially when she wasn't aware of committing a crime.
<name>Thaddeus</name>	Thaddeus	Sterry	[MASK], pacing about like a caged woodchuck, launched into a tirade about silly Sunday-school notions, and, by a transition which I did not grasp, passed to a review of the general subject of woman's suffrage. I gathered that he is not in favor of the movement.
<name>Dorothy</name>	Dorothy	Clifford	I know that you will be very glad to hear that I have chosen your little sister." "And won't we ever see her any more?" asked [MASK]. "Oh, yes, sometimes."
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Judy	I should hate very much to lose your friendship. And we are friends, are we not? I like to think so. S. McB. Dear [MASK]: I am sure I haven't an idea whether or not the doctor and I have made up our differences.
<name>Constance</name>	Constance	Betsy	[MASK] and I are being polite, but cool, toward the doctor. The annoying thing is that he is rather cool, too. And he seems to be under the impression that the drop in temperature is all on his side.
<name>Poor</name>	Poor	Mercy	When I think of all the jokes I've made on the subject, I'm aghast at how I must have hurt him, and angry with myself and angry with him. I feel as though I never wanted to see the man again. [MASK]!
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Gordon	I had really begun to be worried for fear you'd tumbled into the Potomac. My chicks would miss you dreadfully; they love their uncle [MASK]. Please remember that you promised to send them a donkey. Please also remember that I'm a busier person than you.
<name>Yours</name>	Yours	SALLIE	As soon as we are allowed to see him I will send more detailed particulars. I really must stop if I am to catch tomorrow's steamer. Good-by. Don't worry. There are a dozen silver linings to this cloud that I'll write about tomorrow. [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Allegra	The mother died in the hospital a few days after [MASK]'s birth, and the father struggled on for two years, caring for his brood and painting like mad--advertisements, anything--to keep a roof over their heads.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Allegra	The doctor, without a moment's hesitation, had risked his life to save [MASK]. It was the bravest thing I ever saw, and yet the whole business occupied only fifteen minutes out of that dreadful night. At the time, it was just an incident.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Percy	Last Saturday those two desirable friends of [MASK]'s spent the whole afternoon playing with my boys. They brought up three rifles, and each man took the lead of a camp of Indians, and passed the afternoon in a bottle shooting contest, with a prize for the winning camp.
<name>Reader</name>	Reader	Judy	As I stood there at the end and watched him drop out of sight over the brow of the hill, and realized that I was free and alone and my own master well, [MASK], such a sense of joyous relief, of freedom, swept over me!
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Allegra	At the time, it was just an incident. And he saved [MASK]. She came out of that blanket with rumpled hair and a look of pleased surprise at the new game of peek-a-boo. She was smiling! The child's escape was little short of a miracle.
<name>Jean</name>	Jean	SALLIE	We have been working three days over him, and are just sure now that he is going to recuperate sufficiently to do it again! "It's a gude warld, but they're ill that's in 't." Please excuse that Scotch--it slipped out. Please excuse everything. [MASK].
<name>Yours</name>	Yours	SALLIE	I think I'll have a romp with them, and try to be in a more affable mood before resuming my pen. A BIENTOT! [MASK]. P.S. These November nights are pretty cold, and we are getting ready to move the camps indoors.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Singapore	The only way to deal with trustees is with a firm and steady hand. You have to keep them in their places. Oh, my dear! that smudge in the corner was caused by [MASK]'s black tongue. He is trying to send you an affectionate kiss.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Thomas	He came, and we put in a pretty terrible night. It developed afterward that the boy had brought along with his luggage a bottle of liniment belonging to his employer. It was made half of alcohol and half of witch hazel; and [MASK] had refreshed his journey with this!
<name>Judy</name>	Judy	Judy	As the John Grier Home was planned by its noble founder in 1875, so shall it be run today. Incidentally, my dear [MASK], your idea of a private dining room for the superintendent, which I, being a social soul, at first scorned, has been my salvation.
<name>Bathsheba</name>	Bathsheba	Marie	That's the nearest to a compliment he ever came, and I feel extremely flattered. As to poor [MASK], he refers to her as "Bash" because he can't pronounce her name, and is too disdainful to try.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Allegra	Instead of going about his visits like a sober medical man, he comes down to my library hand in hand with [MASK], and for half an hour at a time crawls about on a rug, pretending he's a horse, while the bonnie wee lassie sits on his back and kicks.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jervis	She likes to be independent of her family, as do all of us in these degenerate times. In my growing zeal for cataloguing people, I should like to get our doctor tabulated. If [MASK] knows any gossip about him, write it to me, please; the worse, the better.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Percy	Their very niceness, I suppose, makes them blind and unsuspicious. You know, the most interesting pursuit in the world is studying character. I believe I was meant to be a novelist; people fascinate me--until I know them thoroughly. [MASK] and the doctor form a most engaging contrast.
<name>Jenkins</name>	Jenkins	Betsy	So when it came time to send our little maid to prattle her unconscious good-bys to the man who had saved her life, I despatched her in charge of [MASK]. I haven't an idea what is the matter with the man.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Percy	He was friendly enough last week, but now, if I want an opinion from him, I have to send [MASK] to extract it. I do think that he might see me as the superintendent of the asylum, even if he doesn't wish our acquaintance to be on a personal basis.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Judy	I shall hate to see the camps go; they have done a lot for us. Our lads will be as tough as Canadian trappers when they come in. November 20. Dear [MASK]: Your motherly solicitude is sweet, but I didn't mean what I said.
<name>Millicent</name>	Millicent	Betsy	He looks as though he had a frightfully healthy appetite, and he looks as though he couldn't swallow his dinner unless he had on evening clothes. I've made [MASK] send home for a trunkful of evening gowns in order to keep up our social standing.
<name>Mother</name>	Mother	Sandy	With that advice, and a few bottles of cod-liver oil we are left to our own devices. I feel very free and adventurous. Perhaps you had better run up here again, as there's no telling what joyous upheaval I may accomplish when out from under [MASK]'s dampening influence.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sallie	I am awfully disappointed that you didn't visit us while [MASK] was still here. You would have taken away an exalted opinion of my housekeeping. Drowsiness overcame me at that point, and it's now two days later.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Betsy	[MASK] and I walked as far as the baseball field in the course of the evening, and caught a glimpse of the orgies. The braves were squatting in a circle about a big fire, each decorated with a blanket from his bed and a rakish band of feathers.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	John	Never punish; simply deflect their attention. I was entertaining a very loving, uplifted attitude toward all this young life about me when my attention was attracted by a group of little boys beneath the window. "Aw--[MASK]--don't hurt it!"
<name>Wilmot</name>	Wilmot	Sandy	It's really horrid of me to make fun of poor [MASK], for, despite his stern bleakness of disposition, he's a pathetic figure of a man. Think of coming home after an anxious day's round to eat a solitary dinner in that grim dining room!
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Sandy	You will scarcely credit the assertion, but he succeeded--more or less. He did pull off one or two really boyish pranks. [MASK] is not yet out of his thirties and, mercy! that is too early to be grown up.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Punch	[MASK] is paying a call this morning. For the last half-hour, while I have been busily scratching away to you, he has been established in the window seat, quietly and undestructively engaged with colored pencils.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Gordon	I am afraid I was never born to set the crooked straight. I tried to show [MASK] about and make him take an interest in the babies, but he wouldn't glance at them. He thinks I came just to spite him, which, of course, I did.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Judy	You know, I had the queerest feeling all the time that you were here. I can't make it seem true that you, my dear, wonderful [MASK], were actually brought up in this institution, and know from the bitter inside what these little tots need.
<name>Lord</name>	Lord	Lord	She drummed on the table with her knife and fork and sang, "Welcome to dem golden halls." You remember that illuminated text over the dining-room door--"The [MASK] Will Provide." We've painted it out, and covered the spot with rabbits.
<name>John</name>	John	Sandy	Well, [MASK] took her home and read her painstakingly and thoughtfully. "Yes," he acknowledged today when he came to report, "it is a truthful record of a certain kind of morbid, egotistical personality that unfortunately does exist.
<name>John</name>	John	Sandy	It's nice to look forward to, isn't it--a life of work and play and little daily adventures side by side with somebody you love? I'm not afraid of the future any more. I don't mind growing old with you, [MASK].
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Sandy	So I packed in a basket a jar of bacon and some eggs and muffins and ginger cookies, with hot coffee in the thermos bottle, and was waiting on the steps when [MASK] chugged up with his automobile and frying pan.
<name>Macintosh</name>	Macintosh	Percy	The remaining Indians, so long as there is no danger of the roof falling, devote themselves to salvage. On the occasion of our first drill, [MASK] in command, the contents of a dozen clothes lockers were dumped into sheets and hurled out of the windows.
<name>Jukes</name>	Jukes	Kallikak	I've diagnosed her case; she's a [MASK]. Is it right to let her grow up and found a line of 378 feeble-minded people for society to care for? Oh dear! I do hate to poison the child, but what can I do?
<name>Jervis</name>	Jervis	Sterry	I think that [MASK] will probably come back some night and throw rocks through the windows. Shall I have them insured? My dear Enemy: You disappeared so quickly this afternoon that I had no chance to thank you, but the echoes of that discharge penetrated as far as my library.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	John	[MASK] I seized by the collar; and dragged him squirming and kicking in at the kitchen door. He is a big, hulking boy of thirteen, and he fought like a little tiger, holding on to posts and doorjambs as we passed.
<name>Priscilla</name>	Priscilla	Sadie	[MASK]'s excellent ears are still intact. She is just squealing on principle; the way one does in a dentist's chair, under the belief that it is going to hurt the next instant. I really can't think of anything else to write except my news,--so here
<name>John</name>	John	Judy	Then this building could be turned into an idiot asylum, and I, not knowing anything about idiots, could conscientiously resign and go back home and live happily ever after. Really, [MASK], I am growing frightened. This asylum will get me if I stay long enough.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Don	The only time I ever hear them laugh is when she has done something funny. The poor little fellows miss their father horribly. I found [MASK], the five-year-old one, sobbing in his crib last night because he couldn't say good night to "daddy."
<name>Judy</name>	Judy	Judy	I do so want to contrive a little individual petting for my babies. You see, [MASK], I am remembering your own childhood, and am trying hard to fill in the gaps. The trustees' meeting last week went beautifully.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Sterry	But I don't believe I told you how the fire started. There are so many things I haven't told you that my arm aches at the thought of writing them all. [MASK], we have since discovered, was spending the week end as our guest.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Cy	P.S. There is one thing in the midst of all my troubles that I have to be grateful for: the Hon. [MASK] has been stricken with a lingering attack of grippe. In a burst of thankfulness I sent him a bunch of violets. P.S. 2.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Judy	You can't imagine how I miss [MASK]. Her absence leaves a dreadful hole in my afternoons. Can't you run up for a week end soon? I think the sight of you would be very cheering, and I'm feeling awfully down of late.
<name>McAlister</name>	McAlister	Sandy	He was in such shape that positively I didn't think we'd pull him through--and I hoped we wouldn't. If I were a physician, I'd let such cases gently slip away for the good of society; but you should have seen [MASK] work!
<name>Chickens</name>	Chickens	Bairns	They don't get the individual, fussy care that only an old hen can give. There is a lot of interesting news that I might have been telling you, but my new little family has driven everything out of my mind. [MASK] are certain joy, but nae sma' care.
<name>Mother</name>	Mother	Jane	Those poor little tots are going to enjoy the perfectly new sensation of being able to breathe at night. There are a million things I want to grumble about, but it's half-past ten, and [MASK] says I MUST go to bed.
<name>Elmer</name>	Elmer	John	He stood--by preference--through the entire interview. The doctor talked to him, oh, so sensibly and kindly and humanely! [MASK] put up the plea that the mouse was a pest and ought to be killed.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Percy	Those who are particularly good in lessons or work will receive an extra recompense. My head aches at the thought of the bookkeeping, but [MASK] waves that aside as a mere bagatelle. It is to be accomplished by our prize arithmeticians, and will train them for positions of trust.
<name>Jerry</name>	Jerry	Sallie	I look forward with reluctance to 7:56 next Monday morning, when I turn my back on the mountains. The awful thing about a vacation is that the moment it begins your happiness is already clouded by its approaching end. I hear a voice on the veranda asking if [MASK] is to be found within or without.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Betsy	She has a sunny nursery, with a southwestern exposure, all ready. And a closet full of surreptitiously gathered dolls! She has made the clothes for them herself,--she showed them to [MASK] with the greatest pride,--so you can understand the necessity for a girl.
<name>Phineas</name>	Phineas	Jimmie	"Perfectly easy," said [MASK], grandly. "I'll find you a college fellow who'll be glad to come during the vacation for his board and a mere pittance, only you'll have to set up more filling board than you gave me tonight."
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Helen	Her family scanned him closely, and found him perfect in every respect--good family, good morals, good financial position, good looking. [MASK] was in love with him. She had a big wedding and lots of new clothes and dozens of embroidered towels.
<name>Wells</name>	Wells	Wells	However, bring it in. I usually manage half an hour of recreation after dinner, and though I had wanted to glance at [MASK]'s latest novel, I will amuse myself instead with your feeble-minded family. Life of late is unco steep.
<name>Snark</name>	Snark	Punch	[MASK] was terribly impressed, as well he might be, when he heard that your steamer burned three hundred wagonloads a day, and he naturally supposed that all hands had been piped to the stokehole. BOW! WOW!
<name>Snarleyyow</name>	Snarleyyow	Punch	oh dear! oh dear! They are what you would expect. He kicks and bites and swears. I have dubbed him [MASK]. Yesterday he was brought squirming and howling to my office, charged with having knocked down a little girl and robbed her of her doll.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Singapore	yesterday afternoon he and [MASK] and I took a long 'cross-country walk, far out of sight of the towers of this asylum, and stopped at a pretty little roadside inn, where we had a satisfying supper of ham and eggs and cabbage.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	SALLIE	Think of coming home after an anxious day's round to eat a solitary dinner in that grim dining room! Do you suppose it would cheer him up a little if I should send my company of artists to paint a frieze of rabbits around the wall? With love, as usual, [MASK].
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Noah	[MASK] is a very cultivated person; he not only reads perfectly, but he wears tortoise-shell-rimmed spectacles while he does it. He also brought from the post office a letter from you, written Friday night.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Gordon	[MASK] somehow seems to stand for the life I belong to,--of country clubs and motors and dancing and sport and politeness,--a poor, foolish, silly life, if you will, but mine own. And I have missed it.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Gordon	There is no doubt about it, [MASK] is the most presentable man that ever breathed. He is so good looking and easy and gracious and witty, and his manners are so impeccable--Oh, he would make a wonderfully decorative husband!
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Noah	You notice that we omitted ice-cream from the menu. In the short time that remained we created all the counter-irritation that was possible. [MASK] (negro furnace man) started smudge fires at intervals about the grounds.
<name>Sallie</name>	Sallie	Allegra	P.S. II. The doctor, who is ordinarily so scientific and unsentimental, has fallen in love with [MASK]. He didn't so much as glance at her tonsils; he simply picked her up in his arms and hugged her. Oh, she is a little witch!
<name>Vanstone</name>	Vanstone	McBRIDE	I did not let 113 babies interfere with my visit to you, and I see no reason why you should let one husband interfere with your visit to me. I shall meet the Berkshire express on Friday as agreed. S. [MASK]. June 30.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sterry	I gathered that he is not in favor of the movement. I let him argue himself quiet, then I handed him a check for his wages, and told him to vacate the tenant house by twelve o'clock next Wednesday. [MASK] says he'll be danged if he will.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jimmie	They collected six friends and organized a baseball game. [MASK] came back blown, but enthusiastic, and consented to prolong his visit over the week end, though after the dinner I gave him he has decided to take his future meals at the hotel.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Sallie	[MASK], wishing to impress me with her invaluableness, did her absolutely Southern best. And after dinner we had coffee before the fire in my comfortable blue library, while the wind howled outside and the shutters banged. We passed a most cordial and intimate evening.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Gordon	I couldn't give it up, and during those agonizing moments while I thought we had lost our doctor, I realized what his life meant, and how much more significant than [MASK]'s. And I knew then that I couldn't desert him.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Gordon	He thinks I came just to spite him, which, of course, I did. Your siren call would never have lured me from the path of frivolity had [MASK] not been so unpleasantly hilarious at the idea of my being able to manage an orphan asylum.
<name>Miranda</name>	Miranda	Jane	(This is the eighth day, and my clock has stopped again; [MASK] forgets to wind it as regularly as Friday comes around.) However, I know it's late; and as a woman, it's my duty to try for beauty sleep, especially with an eligible young suitor at hand.
<name>Jameson</name>	Jameson	J.	This morning I received a telegram from [MASK] F. B. Not at all! He does not purpose to buy any daughter sight unseen. He will come and inspect the child in person at three o'clock on Wednesday next. Oh dear, if he shouldn't like her!
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Jervis	On the occasion of my last visit in your delectable household [MASK] and I had a very solemn conversation in regard to (1) marriage, (2) the low ideals of politicians, (3) the frivolous, useless lives that society women lead.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Hattie	[MASK] was a sweet, obedient, housewifely little body, and it looked as though we had exactly fitted them to each other. My dear, she was returned this morning for STEALING. Scandal piled on scandal: SHE HAD STOLEN A COMMUNION CUP FROM CHURCH!
<name>John</name>	John	SALLIE	This letter must be about long enough even for you. I've been writing it bit by bit for three days, whenever I happened to pass my desk. Yours as ever, [MASK]. P.S. I don't think much of your vaunted prescription for hair tonic.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Punch	I really didn't mean quite all of the impolite things that I said. About once a month the man is sweet and tractable and engaging. [MASK] has just been paying a social call, and during the course of it he lost three little toadlings an inch long.
<name>Macbeth</name>	Macbeth	Sandy	Don't you marvel at the Scotch that flows so readily from my pen? Since being acquent' wi' [MASK], I hae gathered a muckle new vocabulary. The dinner gong! I leave you, to devote a revivifying half-hour to mutton hash.
<name>John</name>	John	Gordon	[MASK] telegraphed today that he is coming tomorrow. I am dreading the interview, for I know we are going to have an altercation. He wrote the day after the fire and begged me to "chuck the asylum" and get married immediately, and now he's coming to argue it out.
<name>I</name>	I	Punch	(I wonder the butler hasn't given notice; he looked like a respectable man.) If nothing more comes of it, at least [MASK] has furnished them with funny stories for the rest of their lives. One of them is even thinking of writing a book.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Jane	I added that I had lately made a study of the care of dependent children, and casually mentioned my seventeen institutions. He grunted again, and said he didn't take much stock in this new-fangled scientific charity. At this point [MASK] entered with a box of roses from the florist's.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Jervis	I have stowed them away very comfortably, however, thanks to the spacious iron verandas surrounding our new fire-escape. It was a happy idea of [MASK]'s having them glassed in for sleeping porches. The babies' sun parlor is a wonderful addition to our nursery.
<name>Gordon</name>	Gordon	Sandy	Dear Enemy: You were so terribly gruff last night when I tried to thank you for giving my boys such a wonderful day that I didn't have a chance to express half of the appreciation I felt. What on earth is the matter with you, [MASK]?
<name>Reggie</name>	Reggie	Jervis	I suppose, judging from the theaters this winter, that it is a thing that might happen to any one, particularly in the best society. You ought to be thankful you've got [MASK]. There is something awfully certain about a man like him.
<name>Undine</name>	Undine	BAKSHISH	Oh, I'm growing into the most shocking beggar! My family don't dare to visit me, because I demand [MASK] in such a brazen manner. I threatened to remove father from my calling list unless he shipped immediately sixty-five pairs of overalls for my prospective gardeners.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Jane	He allowed that I might make use of one of the orphans for all legitimate service. I explained--still polite, but growing bored--that [MASK] had been in my service for many years, and was indispensable.
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Jervis	Incidentally, our doctor didn't like me any more than I liked him. He thinks I'm frivolous and inconsequential, and totally unfitted for this position of trust. I dare say [MASK] has had a letter from him by now asking to have me removed.
<name>Wragge</name>	Wragge	Turnfelt	They make her nervous. And as for [MASK] himself, though industrious and methodical and an excellent gardener, still, his mental processes are not quite what I had hoped for. When he first came, I made him free of the library.
<name>Winthrop</name>	Winthrop	Jane	He wished to know where I got those flowers, and was visibly relieved when he learned that I had not spent the institution's money for them. He next wished to know who [MASK] might be. I had foreseen that question and decided to brazen it out.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Sandy	I do wish I could manage breaks in the routine oftener. It gives them a new outlook on life and makes them more like normal children. Wasn't it really nice of [MASK]? But you should have seen that man's behavior when I tried to thank him.
<name>Mercury</name>	Mercury	Singapore	When I opened the box and saw all that nice messy putty stuff, I sat down on the spot and created a statue of [MASK]. The children love it; and it is very good to have the handicraft side of their training encouraged.
<name>Max</name>	Max	Sandy	Really, I hadn't realized how mortally tired I had become of all this asylum scenery. "What you need," said [MASK] to me, "is to get away for a little and sow some wild oats." That diagnosis was positively clairvoyant.
<name>hero</name>	hero	Sandy	Our [MASK], when he tries, can be exceptionally nice, particularly to people who have no claim upon him. I suppose it is a matter of professional etiquette--part of a doctor's business to heal the spirit as well as the body.
<name>Shirley</name>	Shirley	Jane	Instead of wearing it in two tight braids like this--our little colleen will in the future look like this-- "Them pigtails got on my nerves," says [MASK]. You can see how much more stylish and becoming the present coiffure is.
