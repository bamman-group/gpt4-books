<name>him</name>	him	Gerald	I said to [MASK]. He was looking up at me from his chair. I fantasised him saying, ‘.. .oh, you go, I might stay here for a while,’ and me hiding my mortification and saying, ‘OK, see you later.’
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Claire	Our relationship is permanent!’ I laughed. It almost felt like relief, a great rush of it. ‘And Nor—what you read in the journal, about fucking with [MASK]—’ ‘Oh, it is all right!’ I burst in.
<name>Dad</name>	Dad	Willy	I laughed and picked up his hand. He jumped at the unexpected touch. ‘Come on, [MASK]. Let’s go up the bush and grow veggies.’ Coming home was difficult. Dispossessed, even by minor changes.
<name>Mark</name>	Mark	Javo	‘Too right we are,’ I snarled. I stumped furiously up the stairs, and yelled at him from the doorway of my room. ‘Come on, [MASK]! It’ll be fuckin’ midnight before we get to the border!’
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Gracie	Again and again I felt her agitation. There was water somewhere to our left, its dampness rising in the silence. ‘I want to go back to the pub,’ [MASK] kept saying, in a voice she strove to make conversational.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Javo	‘It’s not your relationship with [MASK] I mind,’ he said. ‘I just feel so neglected.’ I tried to reassure him, in his bed after midnight; but my words were hollow, banging around in that empty chamber of my head in which I waited treacherously for the thump of
<name>the baby</name>	the baby	Gracie	I pushed open the door and saw his long legs in stained white trousers sticking out from the couch. I was delighted to see him and went to hug him. [MASK] sucked her thumb and watched us greet each other.
<name>Me</name>	Me	Rita	I didn’t hear him. What time?’ ‘About three in the morning. He wanted the key to the studio; he’s asleep along there now.’ My heart turned over at the thought of him passing my door and waking [MASK] instead.
<name>Flora</name>	Flora	Rita	I was afraid (next morning, when I found the fit and pieced the time-fragments together to account for my bone-knowledge, in sleep, of his condition) that [MASK] or one of the girls might have gone downstairs in the night and found him hitting up in the kitchen.
<name>Leonard</name>	Leonard	Javo	And I hung up in a turbulence of emotions: panic, impotence, rage, fear. I was unable. I waited. [MASK]’s letter came: ‘I need strong love,’ he wrote from prison, so I started to give it, writing to him every day.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jessie	He flicked the blankets back off his legs and started talking about [MASK]. ‘Everything between us is only OK as long as I’m up,’ I said, watching the stripes of my jumper reflecting in the tiny round mirrors sewn into the cushion cover.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Nora	‘[MASK]? How you doin’?’ ‘I’m all right, mate. What the fuck have you been up to?’ ‘Got sprung, I guess.’ I couldn’t believe how casual he sounded. His laugh came crackling down the wire.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Gracie	Once I glanced up and he grinned at me, hesitantly, as people do when they are not quite sure whether they are being looked at or not. I smiled back and his funny curved face split in half. Back on our side of the river, [MASK] wanted a souvlaki.
<name>Mrs. Hudson</name>	Mrs. Hudson	Gerald	I put an extra rug on the spare bed and sank into it, exhausted. It must have been nearly daylight when I was woken by someone crashing round in the kitchen. I knew it would be [MASK]. I dragged myself out to the door and peered round it.
<name>you</name>	you	Gerald	‘I’m afraid of doing to you what [MASK] is doing to me.’ ‘What? Don’t be silly. You just don’t do it. We trust each other too much for something like that to happen.’ He kept grinning at me.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Nora	I slapped behind me without looking. One of them set up a wail. ‘It’s not fair, [MASK], it’s not fair!’ ‘Will you kids bloody shut up?’ I was nearly crying.
<name>him</name>	him	Javo	I could not break through. I was dreadfully upset. I tried to talk to [MASK], half-crying, full of grief, but he adopted an airy tone and brushed my questions aside. ‘Is it that you just aren’t interested any more?’
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Gerald	I couldn’t go to [MASK] for comfort, not because it would be hurtful to him, but because he would not be able to understand how someone from that group of desperadoes could provoke that much love in a person like me.
<name>Driver</name>	Driver	Willy	‘Can you give us a lift to the tower?’ he croaked to [MASK]. He came that far with us, sitting silently hunched in the middle of the front seat. We stopped, he got out, glanced at me. ‘See ya.’
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Martin	He sat at my table, mending the sleeve of his Lee jacket and sewing a strip of Nepalese braid on to the cuff. I said, in a tone of curiosity, ‘Did you and [MASK] get stoned today?’ ‘Nn.. .yes.’
<name>Mum</name>	Mum	Rita	She nodded, stirring the food with one hand and ruffling up my hair with the other. I looked at her flushed cheeks, and without having to think about it, I suddenly threw my arms round her waist and said, ‘Give us a hug, [MASK]!
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Gracie	Meanwhile, [MASK] was squatting in her classroom, bored into a trance, singing ‘Baa baa black shee’, while she might have been reading whole books or learning to dance or drawing her beautiful ‘lady’s’.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Javo	‘I don’t get it.’ ‘Remember, it disappeared about six weeks ago? Well, I went along to the studio just now to pull [MASK]’s bed apart, and I found it between the two mattresses.’ We stood looking at each other.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Willy	I imagined him behind me in the room, like [MASK], pretending to read Rolling Stone while I stared at the fire and fiddled with briquettes, wondering how to ask him to stay, and whether I really wanted him to, and whether he would refuse with grace or hurtfully.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Francis	‘[MASK],’ I said, can I put the Roaster in here with you while I make his bed for him?’ Before I’d finished speaking he had thrown back the blankets and his arms were out ready for the blinking bundle.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Gracie	[MASK] and I wandered off on our own and began to build a hut. The timber lying about was inadequate to her design, and when I sat down she whinged and shed crocodile tears. ‘You don’t love me,’ she whimpered, looking at me sideways to see how I was taking it.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Martin	I got a whiff of his sweat, the sharp smell that made my heart shift. [MASK] got the baggage out of the way and we were standing, suddenly forlorn, in the great shining echoing terminal, with half an hour to kill before it was time.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Gracie	‘Yew fuckin’ bewdy!’ bellowed a drunk in a T-shirt, leaning out of a passing car and pointing at my blue and white striped jumper. ‘They are people who believe in football,’ said [MASK] with disdain.
<name>Barry</name>	Barry	Gracie	‘Oh, OK. A bit weird. But good.’ ‘Geez he makes me laugh. Yesterday [MASK] wanted to light his cigarette for him—but he said in that croaky voice’—she mimicked him—“‘Come off it, mate—you’d take a week!”
<name>Ray</name>	Ray	Gerald	‘Why don’t you and [MASK] sleep together these days?’ she asked when she came in in the morning. ‘We do,’ I replied, ‘but we like to take a break from each other every now and then.’
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Javo	As it progressed, people we knew gathered in dribs and drabs at the kids’ end of the pool, until we made up an encampment of thirty or forty people. At four o’clock I saw, from under the peak of my cap, [MASK] walk in.
<name>you</name>	you	Willy	‘Well, all men are as weird as hell, if you ask me,’ I retorted, still laughing in spite of myself. ‘Yeah—all men except [MASK],’ she said, and pantomimed a loving sigh.
<name>he</name>	he	Javo	‘I’ve got a sneaking suspicion that [MASK] might’ve stolen them.’ ‘What makes you think that?’ ‘It just all fits together. Yesterday he looked at that old red scarf I was wearing and said how much he liked it.
<name>Barney</name>	Barney	Javo	The clock ticked on the window sill. The matting was crammed with tiny scraps of food and other matter which I could feel with my bare feet. The pigeons flapped and.. .out came [MASK], tousled and foul-tempered, heading for the dunny in his Levis.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Javo	‘Good on yaf cried [MASK] with a laugh. He meant it. I did not mean it. But at that moment I realised I had better start meaning it. Any kind of love for him was no longer appropriate, if I wanted to stay in one piece.
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Javo	I remembered [MASK] that last afternoon by my fire, how he had lifted his chin and opened his eyes wide, and declared, ‘Anyway, I’m never gonna get off dope.’ My hands fell apart in despair.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Willy	I can drop a lot of things—possessions, like the clothes I never wear—but in the city the thread that holds it all together is not easy to find. [MASK] teased me, as I knew he would. ‘Been converted, have you?’
<name>him</name>	him	Grace	‘Who’s we?’ ‘The three of us—you, me and [MASK]. And it had all been turned into an.. .electronic light show. There was a machine for making sandcastles. And on the beach we three did tricks, but no one watched.
<name>Dolores</name>	Dolores	Selena	He ignored what I’d said, and went on, ‘[MASK]’s got to go and see a doctor on Monday.’ ‘What’s she got?’ ‘She’s pregnant. And she can’t keep it because of the hep.’
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Lou	‘But you’ll be getting a phone, won’t you?’ ‘Yeah.’ I privately thought that not one of his household, hippies that they were, would be efficient enough to get a telephone organised. [MASK] laid a bony arm across my shoulders and glanced sidelong at me again.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Gracie	The lights were harsh and people there, customers and cooks alike, looked dirty, tired, washed out, old, pushed past the limits of fatigue. [MASK] said into my ear, ‘I’m tired, but I can’t lie down in here.’
<name>someone</name>	someone	Gerald	Fucked in the house with someone else, liked it, managed to get through the night, parted friends, found myself still open to being with [MASK] (though I felt the odd flicker of apprehension at the thought of his doing the same thing—tit for tat).
<name>Rooster</name>	Rooster	Micky	I was out the door, had closed it behind me, was out in the dark street. ‘Hoo, hoof crowed [MASK], who had followed me out. ‘You really laid it on him!’ I didn’t want the commentary.
<name>Simon</name>	Simon	Hullo	But he stopped a yard short of me, his hair flopped back on his forehead, and I saw that his eyes were dark, not white. ‘[MASK]!’ I said. ‘Was that you shouting?’ He nodded, out of breath; smiled.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Gracie	He laughed. ‘We’ll outlast the lot of’em, Nor!’ I lay there soaking up his warm skin. A long time later we fell asleep. [MASK] woke me at some unearthly hour and I staggered into her room and got into bed with her.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Nor	In the bank he sat on a chair waiting for the teller to call my name. I leaned on the shelf beside him. ‘Hey [MASK],’ he said, ‘have you got forty cents change to lend me for the tram?’
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Javo	‘What are we going to do?’ ‘Is there any way you can get the money together for [MASK]?’ The backs of my hands started to prickle. I was laughing on the other side of my face. ‘A thousand bucks'!
<name>He</name>	He	Paddy	Anyway, it doesn’t matter.’ ‘How’s that?’ ‘Because it’s all fantasy.’ We went downstairs and drank the tea. [MASK] left. We sat in silence, me facing him, him turned in his chair to one side.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Javo	I lay there in a crazy panic of revulsion, half-turned away from him, disliking the smell of his breath, wishing I could dematerialise. I escaped by slowing down my breathing and pretending to be asleep. He stroked on. He said, ‘Hey—has [MASK] come back yet?’
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Javo	But [MASK] seemed a bit concerned. He kept glancing over at me from the other side of the theatre, and when our eyes met he would give me one of his rueful smiles; once, when I grinned at him, he nodded vigorously at me, a sign of allegiance.
<name>Meursault</name>	Meursault	Hank	And [MASK] and I were in the back of this car, fucking...’ She glanced at me in amazement and I said hastily, ‘It’s a dream I had when I was asleep this arvo.’ ‘You dreamed you were asleep}’ she said, bewildered.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Javo	At the ‘first and final call’ we hastened to join the mob banking up at the departure lounge behind the metal detector. For a second I quailed at the thought that [MASK] might be carrying some absurd macho weapon as part of the fantasy: the bowie knife?
<name>Nora</name>	Nora	Javo	.over.. .Nora.’ I asked the I Ching, ‘What about my feeling that it is all hopeless with [MASK]?’ It replied, ‘Times change, and with them their demands. Changes ought to be undertaken only when there is nothing else to be done.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Claire	There was only [MASK] home, we watched TV. And then when I got up to leave she came to the door with me, and she said, “Would you like to stay?”’ Hearing him was like watching a film.
<name>Mark</name>	Mark	Jules	I stood at the barrier and saw him come through. ‘Hey, [MASK]!’ He turned his head. Even his Harris Tweed jacket couldn’t disguise his irrevocably bent nature, the translucent, fined-out pallor of the ex-junkie.
<name>Roark</name>	Roark	Nor	‘Gimme a rapidograph, and a pencil, and a ruler, will you, [MASK]?’ he croaked. I got them for him, and began to feel bad-tempered. He refused food and thundered away to the studio.
<name>Dad</name>	Dad	Javo	I pushed my head into his neck, I said, ‘I love you, [MASK].’ Tears ran off my face on to his blue jumper. He put his arms round my shoulders and started to cry too. ‘I love you too,’ he said.
<name>God</name>	God	Mammon	What am I going to do?’ We ate wonderful food, turkey stuffed with chestnuts, oh, the fruits of the earth but I don’t want them here, though I take them, from the hands of [MASK] himself.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Martin	One arm dangled out from under the stiff sheets. He woke: those blue eyes in his battered face. His skin was still erupting in huge pus-y sores. [MASK] stood at the end of the bed and I crammed myself between the bed and the metal chest of drawers.
<name>Bunny</name>	Bunny	Cobby	‘You were in such a strange mood this morning, mooching round, not talking or anything.’ ‘I was just vacant.’ ‘Oh—by the way—you haven’t got [MASK]’s sunglasses, have you? She can’t find them.’
<name>He</name>	He	Georgie	I fantasised him saying, ‘.. .oh, you go, I might stay here for a while,’ and me hiding my mortification and saying, ‘OK, see you later.’ ‘OK.’ He stood up and we said goodbye. [MASK] walked to the front door with us.
<name>Andy</name>	Andy	Francis	I went to the film co-op to see the rushes of the junk movie. The lights went out and the rushes began and the door opened and in the light from the screen I saw [MASK] come in. He was wearing small hippy spectacles.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Laughs	[MASK]. ‘I was embarrassed.’ ‘So you should have been.’ Long pause. He drank, I looked at my reflection in the dark, clean window, strange bare face above a small bowl out of which I had been eating fruit salad.
<name>Blanche</name>	Blanche	Ange	‘I guess she does come on like that sometimes—’ ‘SometimesI That’s the way she operates, with men!’ ‘Oh, that’s a bit rough, [MASK].’ ‘Well, what about the way she dresses—those see-through shirts and high-heeled sandals?’
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Martin	I stood leaning against the cream-painted metal bed and stared at the clean, clean lino tiles. My impatience rose up in my throat to choke me. When I kissed him goodbye, [MASK] was waiting for me, and it was a cold farewell.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Gracie	and he’s wearing a jacket with ties instead of buttons, and a cap pulled down over his dry, untidy, bleached-out hair. He comes towards me where I stand uncertainly, holding [MASK]’s hand.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Jessie	‘I doubt it. I was married for six years and I was sick of it by then.’ ‘[MASK]’s parents are still in love with each other; but I don’t know if they fuck. I suppose they do,’ he said.
<name>he</name>	he	Joss	I supposed she was confused by the gap between what I normally expect of her—independence and some kind of stoicism—and what [MASK] had offered her—complete openness to his time, and willingness to serve her.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Clive	I told them what I knew. [MASK] stood behind me with his hands on my shoulders. I must have looked green. ‘They’ve done it this time,’ I kept repeating idiotically. ‘They’ve blown it.’
<name>mate</name>	mate	Jess	‘Ah shit, I don’t know, [MASK],’ I said with a twist of the shoulder. ‘Bloody dope. You know what it’s like.’ ‘You’re not kidding.’ She laughed. ‘How didjyow manage it?’
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Rita	While I was in my room he went down to the bathroom and had a shower and came back white-eyed, with a spoon handle sticking out of his jeans pocket. After [MASK] had gone out to her studio, I found him rummaging through her drawers.
<name>Nobody</name>	Nobody	Tom	‘There are,’ I said, ‘quite a few people I’d like to ask to fuck with me, but I don’t, because I’m afraid of being rejected.’ [MASK]!’ he exclaimed, not believing me. ‘Of course!’
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Javo	And that was the end of everything, between him and me. She had it, the knack of engulfing, of making sharing impossible. ‘How come you two don’t get on, when you’ve known each other so many years?’ asked [MASK].
<name>someone</name>	someone	Gerald	‘You’re OK, mate. I (you’re not, I dunno who is.’ I glanced up and saw [MASK] shrug his shoulders and raise his eyebrows, as if to say, ‘What’s all the fuss about?’
<name>he</name>	he	Martin	But [MASK] too kept his eyes on her face, and she remained, in her demeanour, uncommitted, floating on the force of their attention, her expression changing from laughter to a vaguely detached and discontented look, her blue eyes under her thick red fringe drifting away to some private speculation.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Javo	I pulled off my gloves. He twirled the glass in his fingers, their tips flattened from playing guitar. ‘Want some of your own Scotch?’ He was looking at me with a funny sideways smile. ‘[MASK]’s mum gave it to me.
<name>Nor</name>	Nor	Cobby	‘Is [MASK] coming back? Too much! Yeah, come down, Nor.’ ‘That would be great. I get a bit lonely.’ ‘How are you feeling?’ ‘Oh—pretty shithouse. I can’t sleep at night.’
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Javo	She took notes on a piece of paper, spoke briefly, hung up. ‘Who was that?’ I asked. ‘It was [MASK]!’ What! and she hadn’t told him I was there, and he hadn’t asked! I was dumbfounded.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Jack	‘It’s nearly ten,’ I repeated. ‘See you.’ I went off down the hall. There I saw his journal sticking out of his calico bag. I whisked it out and into [MASK]’s room and sat down to snoop: hands trembling, mouth watering.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Hullo	She saw me and stopped in the doorway with a look of uncertainty. I said, ‘Good day.’ ‘[MASK]. How’s things?’ ‘OK. A bit difficult.’ ‘I got your letter.’ ‘I got yours too.
<name>Bella</name>	Bella	Nor	‘Good day.’ ‘I'm sorry about last night, [MASK].’ ‘Oh yeah? What happened?' I asked, probably sounding cold. And feeling like a nailed-down box. He looked at me with an odd, crooked smile.
<name>he</name>	he	Gerald	‘I’m so ripped!’ I sighed helplessly. He grinned at me over his shoulder. ‘Too ripped.’ And pretty soon I fell asleep. What seemed like two minutes later, [MASK] was touching my shoulder. ‘Time to go home.’
<name>someone</name>	someone	Javo	I fell towards sleep, stopped myself for a second to wonder if it was safe, remembered it was [MASK] in the room whose presence if nothing else I could trust, and let myself slip away. I couldn’t have slept more than a few minutes.
<name>Alone</name>	Alone	Rita	Can I leave her with you today? I’ve just got to get some work done.’ ‘She can stay the night if she likes,’ I said. ‘You know, you really ought to live with more people, [MASK].’
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Gracie	[MASK] and I got to the tower before ten o’clock one morning. As we clomped up the stairs, that familiar voice croaked, ‘Uh—uhh! Hey—whazza time?' ‘Ten o’clock,’ I answered. ‘Where are you?’
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Nora	‘[MASK]?’ ♦ I rolled and rolled in the water, deafening my ears while I thought of, and discarded, all the reasons why I shouldn’t go. I popped up, hanging on to the rail, hair streaming on my neck. ‘OK.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Javo	I made myself a bowl of cold curry covered in yoghurt, guzzled it standing at the open fridge door, fell into bed and into sleep, and woke up again at four in the morning when [MASK] pushed open my door and burst in with his wet hair flopping and his dotty, pale eyes burning.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Rita	I stood the broom against the wall, to have my hands free, but she darted past me and sat down on the red chair. ‘What’s up, [MASK]?’ ‘I can’t—I can’t—’ and she dropped her shining face on to her hands and began to sob.
<name>he</name>	he	Javo	He did not take the teasing well, being too agitated. At last [MASK] pulled tight the last buckle on his pack and heaved it by one strap on to his back. He accepted the farewells of our household with a nod, never having learned to be gracious.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Nor	‘It’s all right, [MASK]!’ he burst out eagerly at the sight of my shocked face. ‘It’s only some pimples.’ I stood staring at him. I saw that he had been in my bed all night.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Grace	[MASK] was determined that I was not going to have a good time. ‘You’ve already had a hundred drinks,’ she said as I came back to the table with my second Scotch and ice. ‘You’re going to get drunk.
<name>Benny</name>	Benny	Martin	It wasn’t as if I didn’t already have somebody to love. There was [MASK], teetering as many were that summer on the dizzy edge of smack, but who was as much a part of our household as any outsider could be.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Martin	‘Do I what! You were off your brick. You pulled the drip out of your arm and nicked off. I was spewing.’ ‘You know when you came to visit me that night, with [MASK]? It was a pretty.. .cool visit.
<name>her</name>	her	Angela	.nothing, really, because I know that if I fucked with her it would freak [MASK] out one hundred per cent, completely and totally. And I know only too well the reason why I’ve got the urge to do it—I’d be acting straight out of my conditioning.’
<name>Cooper</name>	Cooper	Nick	Let’s go up the bush and grow veggies.’ Coming home was difficult. Dispossessed, even by minor changes. [MASK] had virtually moved in and had bought tons of market food, quantities at which the frugal soul rebelled, poor quality food, bought because it was cheap.
<name>him</name>	him	Willy	‘Look at [MASK]!’ His blue shirt was open to the waist, his eyes were closed, his blond head rolled back: the public ecstasy of musicians. I laughed, admiring and envious. ‘Isn’t he beautiful!’
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Willy	But you should talk to him nice, like he talked to me once when I was with him and [MASK] in the car going to the tower. And you should leave him alone.’ I thought about that. It was a dull, grey afternoon.
<name>someone</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	someone (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	Javo	I told her about the awful conversation I’d had with [MASK]. When I repeated his comment about my ‘moralistic’ attitude towards dope, she clicked her tongue in disgust. ‘That’s absurd,’ she said. ‘You’re the only one who’s stuck by him.’
<name>Nurse</name>	Nurse	Mac	and he said he’d do it. They gave me a script for some penicillin. [MASK] will come round later and teach you how to give me a shot.’ 0 will he indeed. Must I be your mother?
<name>Ignatius</name>	Ignatius	Gerald	[MASK] was still asleep. I could have a quick snort, I thought, looking at his long bent body under my blanket, but I’d rather wait till he wakes up and share it with him. So I took it down to the kitchen and handed it over.
