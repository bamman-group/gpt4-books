<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Fe	And while they kneaded and baked they all talked as if they were old comadres and laughed at the flour that got on their noses and the dough that somehow stuck itself to their hair, and that was when [MASK] first really talked about her new and quickly serious romance.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Loca	[MASK] tried to make friends with it. She imitated the peacock’s walk and tried to make peacock talk, but it didn’t go along with any of her playfulness, not because it was stupid like a chicken or ornery like a rooster either.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Esperanza	And once, although she had thought at first it was a dream, [MASK] came and lay down next to her mother, cuddled up as she had when she was a little girl and had had a nightmare and went to be near her mother for comfort.
<name>Mulan</name>	Mulan	Caridad	[MASK] put the man’s underwear under her pillow and concentrated on the man for three days and nights. On the fourth night, she saw the good-for-nothing husband in her dream sneaking through the bedroom window of his neighbor at night.
<name>Amara</name>	Amara	Caridad	Unbeknownst to [MASK], however, down below some of the daily newspapers had reported the pilgrimage to her mountain with “eyewitnesses” who had supposedly seen her. Some claimed to have been touched and blessed by her and still some others insisted that she had cured them!
<name>Juan</name>	Juan	Sofi	The comadre wasn’t really doing no chores when [MASK] called; she just wanted to heighten the drama of the “emergency call” for when she repeated the all, he was always eating out. More than likely he didn’t even know how to cook!
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Sofia	“My husband is fine, thank you,” she said, cordially. “We’re just sitting here making plans for [MASK]’s campaign to run for mayor!” She said this with a little tone of cockiness.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Fe	If it was so harmless, [MASK] did not understand why it couldn’t be poured out as the other chemicals were, but she gritted her teeth, said she would do as he said and after he left, she cried from rage since nobody had ever raised his voice to her like that before.
<name>Lupe</name>	Lupe	Sofi	Strangely enough, with the hunch of the gambler, he was getting this tingling feeling all over that told him that his honey was just about to come around again. “Well, she was! jChingao!” [MASK] stood up, her body trembling with the rage of twenty years of celibate living.
<name>Ricardo</name>	Ricardo	Sofi	His wife couldn’t be serious! What did she know of politics? And anyway, everyone knew you couldn’t run a campaign without money. “Don’t be ridiculous!” la comadre responded before [MASK] got the chance.
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Loca	Every now and then, it happens that a child actually surpasses the knowledge and the knack for doing some things that a parent has shown her and this was the case with [MASK]. You’ve got to give credit where credit is due.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Loca	The comadre had said “pavo real,” which meant it wasn’t just any kind of strange bird, but one born of royalty. And it was indeed the most splendid thing on two claw feet that [MASK] had ever seen, this noble bird.
<name>David</name>	David	Ruben	As the months went on, their separation between meetings and sweats had become unsettling. It completely closed her off from her other life, the life which [MASK] referred to derogatorily as “careerist.” She felt just plain sad and lonely about it.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Franky	Then his wife said aloud (because you get to know a person after living with them for the better part of three decades and what one thinks the other will usually say), “Great. Maybe [MASK]’s gonna get himself a life.”
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Caridad	“Yes,” the old woman nodded, glad to hear that no matter how innocent, naive, or just plain “loca” [MASK] was said to be she knew the difference between these two important aspects of the laws of the universe.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Fe	16 9 “Well, he___came into____bank one day____open account and there I was. ___there he was. And _ history ... we liv_happily_______ter!” [MASK] said. And if that been true. _ new rest ^ 11
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Caridad	They were holding hands and laughing and gave each other a little peck on the cheek, before one got into the truck and the other in the VW. Who were they and why did [MASK] keep vigil in front of their house every night, all night?
<name>Rosita</name>	Rosita	Sofi	[MASK], undaunted, jumped out of her chair. “Ay, comadre!” she said, running her fingers through the front of her hair, which was still mostly black. “You have always been like this, ever since we were girls!”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Franky	her gardening gloves and going out to do some work on the vegetable garden, [MASK] always was kind of strange; but mixing up ashes from the fireplace into his food was a new one for the record. That was too much. Still, she knew darn
<name>Ennis</name>	Ennis	Luella	He said nothing about it but rang up six-packs and the Sunday edition of the Daily in total silence, and when [MASK] finished the KP-type assignment, he went back to working on the Big Slurpy machine.
<name>Emmeline</name>	Emmeline	Loca	Her limber horse-riding body had never so much as felt the inside of a dress, much less of a bra! No, [MASK] had done none of the things young ladies did or at least desired to do.
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Caridad	The following dawn, when she woke to a delicate scar in the horizon that gradually bled into day and saw the sun then raise itself like a king from its throne over the distant peaks, [MASK] only knew that she wanted to stay there and be the lone witness to that miracle every dawn.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Fe	And depending on how good a worker you are, you keep getting raises!” What she did not tell [MASK], because she herself had not put two and two together yet, was that in addition to the raises she was getting nausea and headaches that increased in severity by the day.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Caridad	She had slept all too soundly, to their advantage, that night, for they had taken in tow all of [MASK]’s stuff. Crayon marks and the dog’s teeth and claw marks on the doors and baseboards were one thing, not paying the rent was another, but outright theft was wrong indeed.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	miel	but without the melancholy absentmindedness that was particular to that daughter. And then one day when she was still in high school, she met a young man who was [MASK] in the flesh, and after that, only when she was with him was she able to smile.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Fe	Not that [MASK] liked it any better, nor did she like the sorry excuse for a vent at the far end of the wall. That first day she put her hanky up next to it and it just dropped to the floor.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Sofi	the neighbor continued, 10 3 laughing and elbowing [MASK], who only listened, remembering her teen years when she was courted by the handsomest man she had ever laid her betraying eyes on. “ ‘What say we go, honey?’ he says to me.
<name>She</name>	She	Caridad	Not because it wouldn’t have made perfect sense to run into her at the first stop she made after returning to the world, for [MASK] believed that her life had to have a turn for the better at sooner or later and this would have been as good a time to start as any.
<name>Ramona</name>	Ramona	Loca	[MASK] was wearing a pair of cutoff jeans and a T-shirt and was barefoot, as always. Round and round at a dizzying rate she went, looking down at the ground, and apparently distressed. “Agh! Oh Mom, stop_____!”
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Esperanza	Her sisters, all born exactly three years apart from each other, had each gone out into the world and had all eventually returned to their mother’s home. [MASK] had been the only one to get through college. She had gotten her B.A. in Chicano Studies.
<name>La Llorona</name>	La Llorona	Fe	Yes, he had susto. But no tea and no incantations by the curandera his mother brought over to relieve him of it would ever cure him. The mere mention of [MASK] was enough to set him off into a cold sweat.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Sofi	She couldn’t bear to look at [MASK] in the eyes, now that she thought the poor woman had lost her mind, which surely had to do with all the worrying about her daughter disappearing so far away in the Arabian desert. . .
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Caridad	Once the three men had gone away that day the spell of solitude under which [MASK] had lived peacefully was broken, but she remained in her cave home in a daze, trying to remember what her life was like before she got there.
<name>Marina</name>	Marina	Caridad	They peeled one orange after the next, sharing without a word, just sucking hard to end their thirst. All the while, [MASK] kept sneaking glances over at the woman on the wall who, as far as she could tell, was unabashedly staring at her as well.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Esperanza	Her sisters had recovered. And with the reappearance of her father a likely resurrection of her parents’ marriage seemed forthcoming, which was one more reason why [MASK] thought that her mother might not need her around no more.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Caridad	“I can’t sleep,” [MASK] said cheerfully. “Well, nobody can say that cleaning is a waste of time, ma cheri, but why don’t you try praying? Whatever you’re trying to figure out will come to you, believe me.
<name>she</name>	she	Caridad	But you couldn’t see in, at least not from where he was parked, which was a ways down so that [MASK] wouldn’t see him. But nobody came out and she did not ever get out of her truck. The next night was the same thing.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Caridad	She gave [MASK]’s furnished traila to a young couple with a baby on the way, feeling compassion for their troubles rather than listening to her own better judgment, since neither was employed at the time they moved in and whether or not they could afford it remained to be seen.
<name>Melanie</name>	Melanie	Loca	Besides, no longer thinking that her marriage or divorce was anybody’s business, she wanted to get to the point about [MASK]’s health, “Doctor, is my daughter just depressed? You know, losing the girls, as we have. .
<name>Juan</name>	Juan	Soft	Building this cooperative caused untold challenges for [MASK]’s vecinos. The first year was especially hard on them when they lost many of their sheep to a series of catastrophes, first to an electrical storm and later repeated attacks by coyotes.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Ruben	The problem was that then she would not hear from [MASK] again until the next time there was a meeting. She was beginning to feel like part of a ritual in which she herself participated as an unsuspecting symbol, like a staff or a rattle or medicine.
<name>Tio</name>	Tio	Pedro	His do [MASK] approved and offered guidance but sparingly, knowing that at best all he could do was educate his nephew on how to handle his tools and the wood, but not tell him what his bulto should look like, that is, what would be correct or incorrect about the representation of his image.
<name>Cleófilas</name>	Cleófilas	Sofi	[MASK] had devoted her life to being a good daughter, a good wife, and a good mother, or at least had given it all a hell of a good try, and now she asked herself—“*Y pa’ que? jChingao!” She said this aloud and then crossed herself.
<name>Jacob</name>	Jacob	Casey	“Let’s have all boys,” she said, thinking about the lot of girls her mother had had. Then remembering [MASK]’s bleating and his shepherd’s blood, she said, “Well, let’s just see. Maybe we’ll get girls.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Sofi	Outsiders in the past had overused the land so that in some cases it was no good for raising crops or grazing livestock no more. [MASK] looked at her comadre, seeing that maybe there was a chance to win the conformist over, after all.
<name>Jerome</name>	Jerome	Sullivan	The veins on his neck bulged and [MASK] wondered if this was about to be one of those days when the best you could say about it was that at least you got in one good punch. “Hey, man! You ain’t no saint
<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Fe	she yelled, grabbing by his Pendleton collar with her scarred hands that good-for-nothing former foreman that all the girls there thought was so cute (but not nearly as cute as he thought he was) and who at that moment to [MASK] only had the face of a grim reaper with a goatee.
<name>Latina</name>	Latina	Indian	In and of herself there was nothing about her that was unusually striking. She was dark. [MASK] or Mexican. Black, black hair. Big sturdy thighs. She could tell that because the woman was wearing cutoffs.
<name>Chayo</name>	Chayo	Sofi	a...!” “A ique? Tell me! What have I always been, [MASK]?” la comadre demanded, ready to get up and leave right then and there if she didn’t like what that crazy comadre of hers had to say about her.
<name>Anais</name>	Anais	Maria	[MASK], who tended to have the distracted nature of the poet, upon arriving at the great abandoned ruins described them in her journal like this: “It was as if the Great Cosmic Mother had tossed her broken pottery to the ground.”
<name>Cleófilas</name>	Cleófilas	Sofi	(And if she had this one on her side, the rest would be easy, since this comadre was the biggest mitotera among all her neighbors, which was why [MASK] had picked her to be her campaign manager.)
<name>Scoundrel</name>	Scoundrel	Domingo	This was no indirecta but said directly at that scoundrel: “iBocado sin hueso!” By this dicho, she was implying [MASK] to be a freeloader. “;E1 mal vecino ve lo que entra y no lo que sale!”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Caridad	There was nothing, nothing that anyone could see wrong with her, except for the fact that she was feverish. Her eyes were closed while she moved her head back and forth, not violently but softly, as was [MASK]’s nature, mumbling unintelligibly all the while.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Sullivan	[MASK] resisted the urge to slap it off. Instead, he took an unnecessarily deep drag from his cigarette, looking kind of Marlboro Man-ish, profound like, or at least trying to look profound, and turned away.
<name>Enrique</name>	Enrique	Francisco	But [MASK] did not like to talk about these things too much with people, not even with his brothers once he went back home, who, being practical men, tended to find his godmother more an eccentric than someone to turn to for medical attention.
<name>Arturo</name>	Arturo	Francisco	“Who are they, nina?” [MASK] asked again, aware that he felt himself tense waiting for the response. He had caught a glimpse of these women that very morning. They both looked Indian maybe, or of mixed blood, or maybe his-panas.
<name>Ennis</name>	Ennis	Caridad	And by the way, did anyone get the number of the license plate of the deputy who had gone out to [MASK]’s trailer? “How the hell can you think of such things when your daughter has just had such a tragedy!”
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Caridad	“That mare was a beautiful creature. I don’t see what’s wrong with thinking somehow its death could bring us good fortune. And anyway, I would do it for [MASK] to get back some of her losses ...”
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Caridad	Admit it, Woman-on-the-wall was the most beautiful woman she had ever seen—but she had scarcely had more than a glimpse of her. And what had made her so exceptional to [MASK] in any case?
<name>Before</name>	Before	Fe	Before [MASK] could say nothing, although she didn’t know what to say to that anyway, two of the other women said the same thing. “You know,” one of those women said, “my mom had her last baby when she was forty-four!
<name>horse</name>	horse	Corazon	He said that he and his partner had found the horse lying by the road having broken its hoof jumping over the cattle guard. They did what they thought they had to do and shot it. One bullet just above its left nostril. “My [MASK] is dead?”
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Loca	But [MASK] never said nothing about it to no one, how much she liked her sister’s presence more and more, because above all she knew that nothing that exquisite could last in the vulgarity of the big world very long.
<name>Chielo</name>	Chielo	Soft	he said with a smile, as if he had just given an exam to an intern. [MASK] stood up to go back into the house. “Well, we are not giving my ’jita spoonfuls of dog droppings! Kerosene is one thing . . .
<name>Lucinda</name>	Lucinda	Sofi	She is your only surviving child y me duele mucho to think of you losing her too ... We could talk it over with her father about it first, if you prefer.” [MASK] shook her head but did not look up from her fluorescent pants.
<name>Maisie</name>	Maisie	Caridad	,” [MASK] ventured to say to her friend. “Will you go up to that woman for me and ask her where she thinks she knows me from ... if that’s why she keeps looking at me?”
<name>La Llorona</name>	La Llorona	Mecca	In total despair, sitting on the ground with her legs tucked beneath her, she threw her body forward, arms stretched out, and let out a deep sigh of despair like a prayer. “Oye, nina, this is not [MASK]!”
<name>Isidore</name>	Isidore	Fie	[MASK] was the patron saint of farmers, and to not revere him could bring a farmer the worst punishment of all: bad neighbors. A farmer could survive droughts and bad crops, but not an ill-willed neighbor.
<name>Saint Lucy</name>	Saint Lucy	Dios	You reveal the stomach area, not forgetting to commend yourself to [MASK] and to repeat the Creed at least three times while you are concentrating, you move the egg on the patient’s belly in the sign of the cross, then you break it.
<name>Alaric</name>	Alaric	Caridad	It held the weight of a continent and was indelible as ink, centuries old and yet as strong as a young wolf. It had no shape and was darker than the dark night, and mostly, as [MASK] would never ever forget, it was pure force.
<name>She</name>	She	Caridad	On the fourth night, she saw the good-for-nothing husband in her dream sneaking through the bedroom window of his neighbor at night. [MASK] was perplexed because she knew that the neighbor was a married woman with three small children.
<name>She</name>	She	Sofi	Instead he’d give her a sly smile from beneath his Clark Gable mustache and [MASK] would blush.) He also did magic tricks for her, making a coin appear from behind her ear, a bouquet of paper roses for her from out of his sleeve, a real dove from inside his jacket.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Sofi	And oh yes, she added, one final important fact about the permanent residents of heaven: everyone in heaven was thirty-three years old, forever. [MASK] looked at her daughter for some kind of verification when the commercial came on.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Ruben	She needed to bring it all together, to consolidate the spiritual with the practical side of things. But whenever she suggested to [MASK] that they have lunch again like they did that first time or to go out on a regular date in between meetings, he simply declined with no apologies, regrets, or explanations.
<name>Arturo</name>	Arturo	Esperanza	Sundays she cleaned her altar, dusting the statues and pictures of saints she prayed to and the framed photographs of her loved ones—with special care to the one of [MASK] who by then, it was known, was a famous prisoner of war.
<name>anyone</name>	anyone	Francisco	You can imagine what she looked like after not having changed her clothes or been in contact with a single human being for four seasons! More than likely she had bathed in the stream that ran a few miles down below, but [MASK] would not have ventured to gamble on it.
<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Esperanza	That’s why, when another big-time opportunity came along not long after for [MASK], local star reporter, that time she did take it. By then, aside from it being a great career break, it was pretty clear to her that there was no need of her on the homefront.
<name>Rosa</name>	Rosa	Heaven	“[MASK] knows I had my hands full, and if it wasn’t for this pobre criatura here who EVERYBODY looks down on and tries to make out as retarded, no matter that she’s smarter than most people I know, I don’t know what I would have done with you!
<name>Ruda</name>	Ruda	Tomatillo	For these difficult cases, I later recommend a good enema— but believe me, except in the cases of small children I leave that to the person to do for herself when she goes home! “[MASK] is very good as a decoction for treating empa-cho.
<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Fe	So [MASK] asked if that would happen to her. “Oh, no,” said ese rotating foreman, with a bit of a smile as if as usual a subordinate was asking a stupid question, “you can’t get put out by just inhaling it like that.
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Esperanza	Instead, slowly on her own she broke out of the trance. And when she looked around, as if wondering what these people with frowns on their faces were concerned about, she announced, “[MASK] is here ...”
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Fe	After the first day of what she called Ether Hell, she got used to the constant lethargy and just went with it. She was getting better bonuses, too. It was a lot of work, though, even for someone like [MASK], so she was really earning them.
<name>Alfonso</name>	Alfonso	Sullivan	Or was that two guys? Did your mother like music, man?” “Nope. She liked television,” [MASK] said, with a bigger grin. “We were the first family in the pueblo to get a T.V. And it was my grandma.
<name>Ultima</name>	Ultima	Loca	[MASK] went only as far as the stalls and riding the horses along the acequia and walking down to the acequia on foot. That was it. She had never been to school. She had never been to a dance.
<name>Consuelo</name>	Consuelo	Sofi	And that’s why, she said, we all go on living so poor and forgotten!” [MASK] responded. “Well, what ARE we supposed to do, comadre? All we have ever known is this life, living off our land, that just gets mas smaller y smaller.
<name>Elvis</name>	Elvis	T.V.	Mom, hell is where you go to see yourself. This dad, out there, sitting watching [MASK], he was in hell a long time. He’s like an onion, we will never know all of him—but he ain’t afraid no more.”
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Bien	“If you can’t determine it by feeling, you can try using an egg to tell you. The egg, as you know, is used to divine many things, as well as used for cleansing people of mal espiritus. [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sofia	But back then, to be excommunicated was more fearful to [MASK] than the thought of destitution; not to mention that her mother was still alive then, and her mother had been like the Church’s conscience incarnated to her daughter.
<name>La Curandera</name>	La Curandera	Caridad	A curandera not only had the health of her patient in her own hands but the spirit as well. What if [MASK] gave out the wrong remedio and caused the sick one to get worse, or to go mad, or even to die?
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Caridad	“I could have set its bones. If it’s true where they say its hoof was broken, it could have been mended.” A revitalized expression took over [MASK]’s face. “You know how to set bones?” she asked.
<name>her</name>	her	Fe	“What do _ mean, handi___ ?” she asked the manager, but was only advised to go to speech therapy and that was that. Nobody had complained before to [MASK] about not understanding her, at least not to her face.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Loca	([MASK] would not say a third of an inch, of course, but for our purposes here, I am adding specific measurements myself.) Then you cut it into long strips about two-thirds inches wide, and then across into two-inck lengths.
<name>Ignatius</name>	Ignatius	Loca	This lady looked like a nun. In fact, she was a nun. But she didn’t smell like nothing so [MASK] was not sure if she was a present nun or a past nun or maybe hasta una future subjunctive nun.
<name>Rose</name>	Rose	Caridad	And they three knew that it wasn’t a man with a face and a name who had attacked and left [MASK] mangled like a run-down rabbit. Nor two or three men. That was why she had never been able to give no information to the police.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Loca	She had never delivered a human baby, but she knew all about a woman’s pregnancy cycle. There wasn’t even a medical book around for [MASK] to have learned from the pictures—since she didn’t read very well and didn’t like to.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Caridad	She’s kinda like my roommate, you know? She didn’t think you were my cousin. You’re not Indian, are you? But I had this feeling like we knew each other ...” [MASK] closed her eyes. Then she felt the woman’s breath close to her face.
<name>She</name>	She	Loca	She imitated the peacock’s walk and tried to make peacock talk, but it didn’t go along with any of her playfulness, not because it was stupid like a chicken or ornery like a rooster either. The peacock, [MASK] concluded, was just not an imitator.
<name>Heather</name>	Heather	Esmeralda	He would never have won that struggle since [MASK] was no kind of wimpy woman. Her brown belt in judo and her first-place trophy from the Southwest Women in the Martial Arts Annual Competition would surely have caused her to make a neat stack of toothpicks out of that scarecrow of a man.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Soft	Her name was mentioned on the ten o’clock news almost every night. But now since the whole war business was over, people seemed to be losing interest, and in the meantime, [MASK]’s girl was still missing. Maybe she was killed out there.
<name>Eleanor</name>	Eleanor	Caridad	Of course, all this was confusing to [MASK], who, having been away from society for so long, made no connections between those please and her recluse existence and she just went deeper into the cave until all the voices finally went away.
<name>Pepe</name>	Pepe	Domingo	“Do you know how long it’s been since I went to a fiesta, [MASK]?” she asked. He shook his head and lowered his eyes like a boy who was about to be scolded, but he looked more pitiful because he was a man about to be scolded.
