<name>Jay Gatsby</name>	Jay Gatsby	Gradus	The door was open and across its inner side a boy’s hand had scrawled in charcoal: The King was here. “That’s a fine visiting card,” remarked [MASK] with a forced laugh. “By the way, where is he now, that king?”
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Shade	As I gathered from [MASK] himself, no emergency incision was performed; the heart was not compressed by hand; and if it stopped pumping at all, the pause must have been very brief and so to speak superficial. All this of course cannot detract from the great epic beauty of the passage.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Shade	I have no desire to twist and batter an unambiguous apparatus criticus into the monstrous semblance of a novel. Today it would be impossible for me to describe [MASK]’s house in terms of architecture or indeed in any term other than those of peeps and glimpses, and window-framed opportunities.
<name>Fish</name>	Fish	Mon	Among various detailed notices affixed to a special board in the pantry, such as plumbing instructions, dissertations on electricity, discourses on cactuses and so forth, I found the diet of the black cat that came with the house: [MASK], Wed, Fri:
<name>Gawain</name>	Gawain	Charles	Many times that night our King cast himself upon the ground with the desperate resolution of resting there till dawn that he might shift with less torment what hazard soever he ran. (I am thinking of yet another [MASK], another long dark man above two yards high.)
<name>Chopin</name>	Chopin	Hal	He stepped out into the gallery, and the guard, a rather handsome but incredibly stupid Extremist, immediately advanced towards him. “I have a certain urgent desire,” said the King. “I want, [MASK], to play the piano before going to bed.”
<name>Earendil</name>	Earendil	Garh	“I shall rest here and then continue alone.” He sank down on the grass near a patch of matted elfin-wood and inhaled the bright air. The panting dog lay down at his feet. [MASK] smiled for the first time.
<name>Byron</name>	Byron	Sylvia	Next Monday [MASK] flew away but I stayed on for a while, resting from my adventures, musing, reading, taking notes, and riding a lot in the lovely countryside with two charming ladies and their shy little groom.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Sylvia	Changeless [MASK]! During three decades I had seen from time to time, from palace to palace, that same flat nut-colored bobbed hair, those childish pale-blue eyes, the vacant smile, the stylish long legs, the willowy hesitating movements.
<name>Uncle Podger</name>	Uncle Podger	Shade	My dear [MASK] roared with laughter when I led him on a tour of inspection and had him find some of those bunny eggs for himself. Thank God, his robust hilarity dissipated the atmosphere of damnum infectum in which I was supposed to dwell.
<name>Zeena</name>	Zeena	Sybil	This time not a glint came from the back parlor, but by the bright prosaic light in the kitchen I distinguished one end of a whitewashed table and [MASK] sitting at it with so rapt a look on her face that one might have supposed she had just thought up a new recipe.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Man	To every human being: I alone Knew nothing, and a great conspiracy Of books and people hid the truth from me. There was the day when I began to doubt [MASK]’s sanity: How could he live without Knowing for sure what dawn, what death, what doom Awaited consciousness beyond the tomb?
<name>Madame de Maintenon</name>	Madame de Maintenon	Shade	I do not wish to be vulgar in dealing with these delicate matters but the fact remains that sixty-year-old [MASK] is lending here a well-conserved coeval the ethereal and eternal aspect she retains, or should retain, in his kind noble heart.
<name>Marco Polo</name>	Marco Polo	Shade	ways after [MASK] and his eccentric friend, used to ask me with the inane meaningfulness adopted in such cases if anybody had told me how much I resembled that unfortunate monarch. I would counter with something on the lines of "all Chinese look alike” and change the subject.
<name>history</name>	history	Shade	Line 82 2: killing a Balkan king Fervently would I wish to report that the reading in the draft was: killing a Zemblan king —but alas, it is not so: the card with the draft has not been preserved by [MASK].
<name>Stanley</name>	Stanley	Shade	[MASK]’s poem is, indeed, that sudden flourish of magic: my gray-haired friend, my beloved old conjurer, put a pack of index cards into his hat—and shook out a poem. To this poem we now must turn.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Sybil	That “other world” comes in handy when misfortune befalls the infidel but I let it pass of course, and, indeed, resolved not to refute anything, saying instead: “Oh, but there is a recompense, my dear [MASK].
<name>Ezra</name>	Ezra	Shade	I saw a world-famous old writer, bent under the incubus of literary honors and his own prolific mediocrity, arrive in a taxi out of the dim times of yore when [MASK] and he had been joint editors of a little review.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Lavender	She was in the act of writing on the terrace under the jacaranda a disconsolate letter to [MASK] when the tall, sheared and bearded visitor with the bouquet of flowers-of-the-gods who had been watching her from afar advanced through the garlands of shade.
<name>Ezra</name>	Ezra	Shade	Later considerations and deductions have persuaded me that the night of great need on which I decided to check the matter was July 11, the date of [MASK]’s completing his Sec- ond Canto. It was a hot, black, blustery night.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Aristotle	[MASK]! — Ah, there would be a man to talk with! What satisfaction to see him take, like reins from between his fingers, the long ribbon of man’s life and trace it through the mystifying maze of all the wonderful adventure. . . .
<name>Albert</name>	Albert	Sybil	I retelephoned two hours later; got, as usual, [MASK]; insisted on talking to my friend (my “messages1’ were never transmitted), obtained him, and asked him as calmly as possible what he had been doing around noon when I had heard him like a big bird in my garden.
<name>John Shade</name>	John Shade	Shade	I suspect it to be a much earlier effort (it has not year subscript but should be dated soon after his daughter’s death) which [MASK] dug out from among his old papers to see what he could use for Pale Fire (the poem our necrologist does not know).
<name>The White Queen</name>	The White Queen	Odon	“But they are moving closer and closer,” said the King alluding to the noise of rapping and ripping that came from the Picture Gallery. “Not really,” said [MASK], “one inch per hour, maybe two.
<name>Ignatius</name>	Ignatius	Gradus	[MASK] never became a real success in the glass business to which he turned again and again between his wine-selling and pamphlet-printing jobs. He started as a maker of Cartesian devils—imps of bottle glass bobbing up and down in methylate-filled tubes hawked during Catkin Week on the boulevards.
<name>the waiter</name>	the waiter	Odon	“I was looking for shpiks [plainclothesmen]” said the King. "All day,” said [MASK], “they have been patrolling the quay. They are dining at present.” “I’m thirsty and hungry,” said the King.
<name>God</name>	God	Providence	As more thoroughly discussed elsewhere in this commentary (see note to line 550), a serious conception of any form of afterlife inevitably and necessarily presupposes some degree of belief in [MASK]; and, conversely, deep Christian faith presupposes some belief in some sort of spiritual survival.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Shade	“Nay, sir” [said [MASK], refolding a leg and slightly rolling in his armchair as wont to do when about to deliver a pronouncement] “there is no resemblance at all. I have seen the King in newsreels, and there is no resemblance.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Gradus	“You’re a reporter! You are from that cheap Danish paper sticking out of your pocket” ([MASK] mechanically fumbled at it and frowned). “I had hoped they had given up pestering me! The vulgar nuisance of it!
<name>Bucky</name>	Bucky	Chapman	The human skull; and from the local Star A curio: Red Sox Beat Yanks 5-4 On [MASK]'s Homer, thumbtacked to the door. My God died young. Theolatry I found 100 Degrading, and its premises, unsound.
<name>Max</name>	Max	Gradus	The stool creaked under him and he looked around for another seat. The young woodwose had now closed his eyes and was stretched out supine on the pool’s marble margin; his Tar-zan brief had been cast aside on the turf. [MASK] spat in disgust and walked back towards the house.
<name>Maya Angelou</name>	Maya Angelou	Conmal	Personally, I had never the heart to check it. One callous Academician who did, lost his seat in result and was severely reprimanded by [MASK] in an extraordinary sonnet composed directly in colorful, if not quite correct, English, beginning: I am not slave!
<name>Mr. Apollinax</name>	Mr. Apollinax	Frost	Of its preposterous age. Then came your call, My tender mockingbird, up from the hall. I was in time to overhear brief fame And have a cup of tea with you: my name Was mentioned twice, as usual just behind (one oozy footstep) [MASK].
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Oleg	Behind him the young Prince’s electric torch played on the ground and gave a coating of flour to the back of [MASK]’s bare thighs. The air was musty and cold. On and on went the fantastic burrow. It developed a slight ascending grade.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Charlie	“One hundred clowns are packed in Onhava jail, and the ex-King should be among them. Our local prison is much too small for more kings. The next masquerader will be shot at sight. What’s your real name, [MASK]?”
<name>O. Henry</name>	O. Henry	Eberthella	"One should not apply it to a person who deliberately peels off a drab and unhappy past and replaces it with a brilliant invention. That’s merely turning a new leaf with the left hand.” I patted my friend on the head and bowed slightly to [MASK] H.
<name>King George VI</name>	King George VI	Mars	That King’s reign (1936-1958) will be remembered by at least a few discerning historians as a peaceful and elegant one. Owing to a fluid system of judicious alliances, [MASK] in his time never marred the record.
<name>Benny</name>	Benny	Faces	[MASK] flicked. An open mouth in midsong was struck out. An imbecile with sideburns was about To use his gun, but you were much too quick. 470 A jovial Negro raised his trumpet. Trk. Your ruby ring made life and laid the law.
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Hazel	Hence this note. It appears that in the beginning of 1950, long before the bam incident (see note to line 347), sixteen-year-old [MASK] was involved in some appalling “psychokinetic” manifestations that lasted for nearly a month.
<name>Goethe</name>	Goethe	Shade	One cannot sufficiently admire the ingenious way in which [MASK] manages to transfer something of the broken rhythm of the ballad (a trisyllabic meter at heart) into his iambic verse: / / / / 662 Who rides so late in the night and the wind MS ........................................
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Gradus	[MASK] had declined to say over the telephone what exactly the “precious papers” were, but it so happened that the exconsul had been hoping lately to retrieve a valuable stamp collection that his father had bequeathed years ago to a now defunct cousin.
<name>the poet</name>	the poet	Shade	Line 137: lemniscate “A unicursal bicircular quartic” says my weary old dictionary. I cannot understand what this has to do with bicycling and suspect that [MASK]’s phrase has no real meaning. As other poets before him, he seems to have fallen here under the spell of misleading euphony.
<name>Paul Gauguin</name>	Paul Gauguin	Picasso	One recalls with nostalgic pleasure its light gray carpeting and pearl-gray walls (one of them graced with a solitary copy of [MASK]’s Chandelier, pot et casserole emaillee), a shelfful of calf-bound poets, and a virginal-looking daybed under its rug of imitation panda fur.
<name>Hitler</name>	Hitler	Julius	Without consulting anybody he rushed to the hospital, stormed in, located [MASK] in a crowded ward and managed to fire twice, both times missing, before the gun was wrested from him by a hefty male nurse. He rushed back to headquarters and returned with a dozen soldiers but his patient had disappeared.
<name>Old Buck</name>	Old Buck	Hentzner	Delighting as he did in the right word, he esteemed [MASK] for knowing “the names of things”—though some of those names were no doubt local monstrosities, or Germanisms, or pure inventions on the old rascal’s part. Now he was walking with another companion.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	John	Whatever was thought, whatever was said, I had my full reward in [MASK]’s friendship. This friendship was the more precious for its tenderness being intentionally concealed, especially when we were not alone, by that gruffness which stems from what can be termed the dignity of the heart.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Pardon	“Oxford, 1956,” I replied. “You do know Russian, though?” said [MASK]. “I think I heard you, the other day, talking to—what’s his name—oh, my goodness” [laboriously composing his lips].
<name>Hal</name>	Hal	Jane	[And here time forked.] I’ll turn it on.” The screen In its blank broth evolved a lifelike blur, And music welled. He took one look at her, And shot a death ray at well-meaning [MASK].
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Sybil	And what is more he had not yet finished “my” poem! “Planning to travel?” I asked, smiling and pointing at the bag. [MASK] raised it by the ears like a rabbit and considered it with my eyes.
<name>Robespierre</name>	Robespierre	Gradus	When [MASK] learned of this, he flew into one of his rare rages—not because the fact presupposed royalist machinations, but because the clean, honest, orderly course of death had been interfered with in an unclean, dishonest, disorderly manner.
<name>the protagonist</name>	the protagonist	Gradus	Would he have crept, pistol in hand, to where a sun-bathing giant lay spread-eagled, a spread eagle of hair on his chest? We do not know, nor did [MASK] perhaps know himself; anyway, he was spared an unnecessary journey.
<name>David</name>	David	Shade	This, I understand, is the semitransparent envelope left on a tree trunk by an adult cicada that has crawled up the trunk and emerged. [MASK] said that he had once questioned a class of three hundred students and only three knew what a cicada looked like.
<name>Macbeth</name>	Macbeth	Nodo	He insisted later that when he found himself designated to track down and murder the King, the choice was decided by a show of cards—but let us not forget that it was [MASK] who shuffled and dealt them out.
<name>Richard Hannay</name>	Richard Hannay	Gradus	Vindictive exasperation rather than state strategy moved the secret organization of which [MASK] was an obscure member to plot the destruction of the royal fugitive. Spiteful thugs! They may be compared to hoodlums who itch to torture the invulnerable gentleman whose testimony clapped them in prison for life.
<name>Maya</name>	Maya	April	Its roar and rainbow dust Made the tame park romantic. I reclined In [MASK]'s haze immediately behind Your slender back and watched your neat small head Bend to one side. One palm with fingers spread, Between a star of trillium and a stone, Pressed on the turf.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Pope	this meant Nobody cared); the point is that the three Chambers, then bound by you and her and me, Now form a tryptich or a three-act play In which portrayed events forever stay. I think she always nursed a small mad hope. I’d finished recently my book on [MASK].
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Oleg	On that particular afternoon a copious shower lacquered the spring foliage of the palace garden, and oh, how the Persian lilacs in riotous bloom tumbled and tossed behind the green-streaming, amethyst-blotched windowpanesl One would have to play indoors. [MASK] was late.
<name>God</name>	God	Mind	He is not the earth in one’s rattling throat, not the black hum in one’s ears fading to nothing in nothing. I know also that the world could not have occurred fortuitously and that somehow [MASK] is involved as a main factor in the making of the universe.
<name>Queen Victoria</name>	Queen Victoria	S	Vanessa, the Red Admirable (sumpsimus), evoked, 270; flying over a parapet on a Swiss hillside, 408; figured, 470; caricatured, 949; accompanying [MASK]’s last steps in the evening sunshine, 993.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Shade	I once overheard Myself awakening while half of me Still slept in bed. I tore my spirit free, And caught up with myself—upon the lawn Where clover leaves cupped the topaz of dawn, And where [MASK] stood in nightshirt and one shoe. 880
<name>Case</name>	Case	Gradus	Buses were out so far as [MASK] was concerned since he always got roadsick in them unless he drugged himself with Fahrmamine pills, and that might affect his aim. Come to think of it, he was not feeling too steady anyway.
<name>Long John</name>	Long John	Shade	I have seen nothing like it on lexical playfields and the odds against the double coincidence defy computation. One of the five cabins of which this motor court consists is occupied by the owner, a blear-eyed, seventy-year-old man whose twisted limp reminds me of [MASK].
<name>Briony</name>	Briony	Kingsley	Beyond the field the great green steps of turf ascended to the multicolored coppices; one could see above them the white brow of the manor; clouds melted into the blue. Suddenly I sneezed, and sneezed again. [MASK] offered me another drink
<name>she</name>	she	Shade	I take this opportunity to salute him. He always behaved with such exquisite courtesy toward me that I sometimes wondered if he did not suspect what [MASK] suspected, and what only three people (two trustees and the president of the college) definitely knew.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Shade	He cocked his shaggy head to look at the library clock. Across the bleak expanse of snow-covered turf two radiant lads in colorful winter clothes passed, laughing and sliding. [MASK] glanced at his watch again and, with a shrug, accepted my offer.
<name>Sosed</name>	Sosed	Zembla	Everybody, in a word, was content—even the political mischiefmakers who were contentedly making mischief paid by a contented Sosed ([MASK]’s gigantic neighbor). But let us not pursue this tiresome subject. To return to the King: take for instance the question of personal culture.
<name>God</name>	God	John	But who instilled it in us, [MASK]? Who is the Judge of life, and the Designer of death? shade: Life is a great surprise. I do not see why death should not be an even greater one.
<name>Macavity</name>	Macavity	730	However, I demurred. In mind I kept [MASK] Replaying the whole thing. Again I stepped Down from the platform, and felt strange and hot, And saw that chap stand up, and toppled, not Because a heckler pointed with his pipe,
<name>Ezra Pound</name>	Ezra Pound	Sybil	Line 830: [MASK], it is This elaborate rhyme comes as an apotheosis crowning the entire canto and synthesizing the contrapuntal aspects of its "accidents and possibilities.” Lines 835-838: Now I shall spy, etc.
<name>Shakspere</name>	Shakspere	Conmal	English being [MASK]’s prerogative, his Shakspere remained invulnerable throughout the greater part of his long life. The venerable Duke was famed for the nobility of his work; few dared question its fidelity. Personally, I had never the heart to check it.
<name>Professor Hinkle</name>	Professor Hinkle	Shade	Despite a wobbly heart (see line 735), a slight limp, and a certain curious contortion in his method of progress, [MASK] had an inordinate liking for long walks, but the snow bothered him, and he preferred, in winter, to have his wife call for him after classes with the car.
<name>him</name>	him	John	Just a present for [MASK]. A present? Well, was it not his birthday yesterday? Yes, it was, but after all are not birthdays mere conventions? Conventions or not, but it was my birthday too—small difference of sixteen years, that’s all.
<name>Victor</name>	Victor	Sybil	“Well, sit down,” said [MASK], “and have some coffee” (victors are generous). I accepted, as I wanted to see if the recitation would be continued in my presence. It was not.
<name>Ezra Pound</name>	Ezra Pound	One	[MASK] regrets that the poet did not pursue this theme—and spare his reader the embarrassing intimacies that follow. Line 286: A jet’s pink trail above the sunset fire I, too, was wont to draw my poet’s attention to the idyllic beauty of airplanes in the evening sky.
<name>Bonaparte</name>	Bonaparte	Charles	“I’m sure, [MASK], our young friend never intended to insult your sovereign and namesake.” "He could not, even if he had wished,” I observed placidly, turning it all into a joke.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Kinbote	[MASK]: “For instance?” “Not having read the required book. Having read it like an idiot. Looking in it for symbols; example: ‘The author uses the striking image green leaves because green is the symbol of happiness and frustration.’
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Hazel	Other incidents followed, such as short flights accomplished by her scrapbook (see note to line 90) and, of course, all kinds of knockings, especially in the sanctuary, which would rouse [MASK] from her, no doubt, peaceful sleep in the adjacent bedroom.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Charlie	The envelope, unfastened at one end, bulged with stacked cards. “Where is the missus?” I asked (mouth dry). “Help me, [MASK], to get out of here,” he pleaded.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	John	“My dear [MASK],” I replied gently and urgently, “do not worry about trifles. Once transmuted by you into poetry, the stuff will be true, and the people will come alive. A poet’s purified truth can cause no pain, no offense.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Shade	Once transmuted by you into poetry, the stuff will be true, and the people will come alive. A poet’s purified truth can cause no pain, no offense. True art is above false honor.” “Sure, sure,” said [MASK].
<name>Nabokov</name>	Nabokov	Shade	The reference is to what my dictionary defines as “a large, tailed, pale green moth, the caterpillar of which feeds on the hickory.” I suspect [MASK] altered this passage because his moth’s name clashed with "Moon” in the next line.
<name>John Carter</name>	John Carter	Bretwit	“We don’t need your money” (Traffic-stopper’s palm). “But here’s our plan. I have messages from other barons for other fugitives. In fact, I have letters for the most mysterious fugitive of all.” “What!” cried [MASK] in candid surprise.
<name>John Shade</name>	John Shade	Disa	And this was the trim scheme nature had followed in [MASK]’s case. There was something else, something I was to realize only when I read Pale Fire, or rather reread it after the first bitter hot mist of disappointment had cleared before my eyes.
<name>Wolf Larsen</name>	Wolf Larsen	Emerald	As he began hurriedly fumbling at the car door, unfastidious [MASK] leaned, close to him, across him, almost merging with him. to help him open it—and then, slamming it shut again, whizzed on to some tryst in the valley.
<name>Hazel</name>	Hazel	John	I do not see why death should not be an even greater one. kinbote: Now I have caught you, [MASK]: once we deny a Higher Intelligence that plans and administrates our individual hereafters we are bound to accept the unspeakably dreadful notion of Chance reaching into eternity.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	John	But, of course, the most striking characteristic of the little obituary is that it contains not one reference to the glorious, friendship that brightened the last months of [MASK]’s life. My friend could not evoke the image of his father.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Oleg	Without consulting each other, the young Prince and his friend veered in absurd panic and, with the pedometer beating wildly, raced back the way they had come. “Oufl” said [MASK] once the last shelf had been replaced.
<name>Envy</name>	Envy	Sloth	Pride, Lust and [MASK], poetry might never have been born. kinbote: Is it fair to base objections upon obsolete terminology? shade: All religions are based upon obsolete terminology- kinbote: What we term Original Sin can never grow obsolete. shade: I know nothing about that.
<name>Thoreau</name>	Thoreau	Shade	The term “iridule” is, I believe, [MASK]’s own invention. Above it, in the Fair Copy (card 9, July 4) he has written in pencil “peacock-herl.” The peacock-herl is the body of a certain sort of artificial fly also called "alder.”
<name>Mr. Winkle</name>	Mr. Winkle	Shade	“I think I heard you, the other day, talking to—what’s his name—oh, my goodness” [laboriously composing his lips]. [MASK]: “Sir, we all find it difficult to attack that name” [laughing].
<name>Aliosha</name>	Aliosha	Odon	Somewhere an iron curtain had gone up, baring a painted one, with nymphs and nenuphars. “I shall bring you your flute tomorrow,” cried [MASK] meaningfully in the vernacular, and smiled, and waved, already bemisted, already receding into the remoteness of his Thespian world.
<name>His Majesty</name>	His Majesty	Charlie	Would [MASK] (His Majesty) promise not to attempt anything until then? “But they are moving closer and closer,” said the King alluding to the noise of rapping and ripping that came from the Picture Gallery.
<name>Queen Mab</name>	Queen Mab	Paladins	Where her spine of mountains? Where her long thrill through the mist? And my lovely flower boys, and the spectrum of the stained windows, and the Black Rose [MASK], and the whole marvelous tale? Nothing of it was there!
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Niagarin	[MASK], on the other hand, was of comparatively short stature, had somewhat more rounded, albeit quite manly features, and every now and then would flash a big boyish smile remindful of scoutmasters with something to hide, or those gentlemen who cheat in television quizzes.
<name>Ignatius</name>	Ignatius	Gradus	[MASK] let his indifferent glance enter the mossy recess where one could glimpse a collapsible mattress with a dark stain on its orange nylon. The boy applied avid lips to a pipe of spring water and wiped his wet bands on his black bathing trunks.
<name>Isadora</name>	Isadora	Otar	[MASK], her lover, said that when you walked behind her, and she knew you were walking behind her, the swing and play of those slim haunches was something intensely artistic, something Arab girls were taught in special schools by special Parisian panders who were afterwards strangled.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	John	I felt—I still feel—[MASK]’s hand fumbling at mine, seeking my fingertips, finding them, only to abandon them at once as if passing to me, in a sublime relay race, the baton of life.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Disa	What had the sentiments he entertained in regard to [MASK] ever amounted to? Friendly indifference and bleak respect. Not even in the first bloom of their marriage had he felt any tenderness or any excitement. Of pity, of heartache, there could be no question.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Pink	Today, of course, all this has changed. It is now the lower classes who are forcibly taught to speak Russian.” “Aren’t we, too, trying to teach Russian in our schools?” said [MASK].
<name>Bardolph</name>	Bardolph	Ohthere	And thus it came to pass, my dears, that a fabulous exile, a God-inspired northern bard, is known today to English schoolboys by the trivial nickname: [MASK]. Howeverl On a later occasion my capricious and henpecked friend was much kinder (see note to line 802).
