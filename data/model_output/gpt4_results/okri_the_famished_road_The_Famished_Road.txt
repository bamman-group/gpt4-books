<name>Flames</name>	Flames	Tables	I cried out. The female midget swirled me round. [MASK] flew towards me. They flew through me. And I was twirling, dizzy, my being in disintegration, dancing not with a female midget but with the four-headed spirit who had been biding his time.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Ade	[MASK]’s father looked terrifying. ‘Where have you been all night, eh?’ he asked his son. ‘Why didn’t you come home? Your mother is almost ill with worrying about you.’ A dark glow surrounded him. He came into the room.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Azaro	[MASK]!’ The whole area rang with my name. So fearfully did the spirits call it out that the lights changed and yellow clouds materialised beside me. It seemed I had entered another realm. Like animals who have discovered speech, they screamed my name, each in a different voice.
<name>Ulysses</name>	Ulysses	Politicians	They talked in their inhuman languages in leisurely animation, as if they were merely setting out on a pilgrimage to a distant land. Overcome with fear, unable to move, surrounded by darkness and the death-smells of the sack, I cried: ‘[MASK]!
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Flowers	I continued. ‘Voices. Words. Trees. [MASK].’ He laughed. ‘They sent me to bring you.’ ‘Who?’ ‘Your friends.’ ‘Who are you?’ He looked around and waved his hand over the bar.
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Ade	At first he didn’t want to talk to me. Then I told him again that the man shadow-boxing was my father. His face lit up in transferred admiration. ‘What’s your name?’ ‘[MASK]. What’s yours?’
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Ade	His blind eyes were ugly in the dark. They had a curious light in them. ‘I can’t see!’ he cried, making our flesh crawl. As we were about to leave he caught [MASK]’s hand and wouldn’t let go.
<name>Their</name>	Their	Glasses	[MASK] broke. Women’s voices intervened. The fight died down with subsiding abuses. Someone put a record on the phonograph and a deep octave voice, lifted by brass instruments, sang out into the evening. The wind blew.
<name>Anansi</name>	Anansi	Swans	[MASK] told stories beneath the great silk cotton tree. A black tiger with a prince’s crown and the eyes of my grandfather roamed the city precincts, reciting verses from ancient epics, sacred texts that could alter the nature of things.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Ade	Then suddenly he turned away from me and with the quick movement of a snake striking an unsuspecting prey, he grabbed hold of [MASK] and wouldn’t let go. ‘Ah ha, so it’s you, the flying wizard!’ he shouted triumphantly.
<name>Frogs</name>	Frogs	Fishes	Electric cables had been brought down by the force of wind and rain and, some people added, by the forces against progress. [MASK] had been found in wells. A snake had slid into a house and killed a woman. People said the snake had been sent by an enemy.
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Flies	’s bar after school, the place was empty. I was hungry. Sitting near the earthenware pot, I kept telling myself that I didn’t have a stomach. I slept and woke up. [MASK] had come into the bar.
<name>Henri</name>	Henri	Swaying	He crouched, stood on tiptoes, knelt, climbed on a chair, and even seemed to imitate an eagle in flight. He drank generously from a bottle of beer. [MASK], leaning backwards, his eyes shining, he made us say: ‘Sheeze.’
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Ade	[MASK], his head held lightly, with his eyes fixed on ghosts, simply left the window and went out of the room as if he were sleepwalking. His father followed him, caught between anger and despair. I followed his father. The world was old that morning.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Ade	Not far from them [MASK], who had been struck in the hip and had landed on his arm and wrenched it, beat and wailed on the ground. His father held him down and his mother spoke words into his ears, which made him wail louder.
<name>Yoshitsune</name>	Yoshitsune	Ade	In flames, the great king of the spirit world flashed past my eyes. The mountain heaved. I saw a black cat at my feet and I fed it bean-cakes. [MASK] lay quiet beside me. His past lives had begun to conquer him.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Ade	I decided not to go there again. I tried to get [MASK] to wander the streets with me, but he never went far. He was scared of his parents. If they called him and he didn’t answer he got whipped for it later.
<name>Trurl</name>	Trurl	One	Another seemed to have three eyes, but on closer inspection it turned out to be a wound like a socket with an eye missing. [MASK] was almost completely blind and could see only through pupils so scrambled up and confusing that they seemed like mashed egg yolk.
<name>Yusuf</name>	Yusuf	Sami	We strode, proudly, behind him. When we arrived, [MASK] was counting the money he had collected in his bucket. His hefty brothers sat around him in the shop, their faces glowing with money and the light from the kerosine lamp.
<name>Ants</name>	Ants	Rats	We must become spies on behalf of justice. Human beings are dreaming of wiping out their fellow human beings from this earth. [MASK] and frogs understand their destiny. Why not man, eh? My wife, my son, where are we going?
<name>Tempers</name>	Tempers	Disagreements	The thugs grumbled that the quantity was an insult to their saliva. Arguments started up. [MASK] flared in the bad-tempered reception of the food and drink. Shop-owners around mingled in the crowd and sold bottled beer and ogogoro. The soldiers and thugs drank a great deal.
<name>Farfrae</name>	Farfrae	Ghosts	Then he said: ‘I thought I was dreaming.’ ‘You’re not,’ I said. ‘I thought I was in the Land of the Fighting [MASK].’ ‘He is a Fighting Ghost.’ ‘You mean I wasn’t dreaming?’
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Ade	and I heard his neck creak and was sent flying and when I landed amongst broken tables and the mess of fruits and bean-cakes, everything had cleared. The old man stood, swaying. [MASK] jerked in a weird epileptic fit. The crowd had mostly gone.
<name>Garlic</name>	Garlic	Demons	‘What did you put in the soup?’ ‘[MASK],’ she said, glancing at me. ‘To attract customers?’ She glanced at me again, her eyes bright with curiosity. ‘What gave you that idea?’ ‘No one.’
<name>The</name>	The	TTie	News-vendors roused the dawn with their horns, announcing to the awakening world the scandals of the latest political violence. [MASK] industrious women of the city, who carried basins of peppered aromatic foods on their heads, tempted the appetite of the world with their sweet voices.
<name>Despereaux</name>	Despereaux	Azaro	They can sometimes tell what is happening in the world. They are our spies. Listen to them, [MASK], and tomorrow tell me what the rats are saying.’ I listened to the rats. One of them had teeth of yellow diamonds.
<name>Lizards</name>	Lizards	Lizards	[MASK] ran up and down wails, sunning themselves, nodding. I went to buy some beans from an itinerant trader of cooked food. She had a constant companionship of flies. And she had the most amazing signs tattooed to the sides of her mouth.
<name>Titans</name>	Titans	Ghosts	The spirit was much too powerful for me and there was nothing I could do but run. I ran into the forest. The spirit caught me and tied me up with silver ropes and began to drag me to the Land of the Fighting [MASK].
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Madame	She was untouched by it all, even when the men teased her. The original man with the big eye, which got more bloated as he drank, as if his eye were a stomach all to itself, said: ‘[MASK], come and sit on my lap.’
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Ade	The strangest thing happened. [MASK] began to twist, to jerk, contorting in spasms. His eyes swam around their sockets till only the whites were visible. He opened his mouth, his tongue hung out, and he gasped, and made choking noises.
<name>Yankel</name>	Yankel	Sami	His hefty brothers sat around him in the shop, their faces glowing with money and the light from the kerosine lamp. [MASK] sat on a stool, his face covered with sweat, his eyes glittering. When he looked up and saw us his face darkened.
<name>Flanagan</name>	Flanagan	Sami	He had long thin legs, the legs of a spiderous animal. His eyes filled with fear and shame at being unmasked. People backed away, gasping in horror. [MASK], the betting-shop man, sent the buckets of money home with some of his protectors.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Flies	[MASK] followed her. Wine spilt on the floor. The women didn’t move. When she dropped the kegs near me she planted her fists on her hips and roundly berated the women for their lassitude. They jumped up and made themselves busy, arranging benches, washing cups and plates.
<name>Daddy</name>	Daddy	Photographer	I felt sad he wasn’t there. He had taken pictures of everyone except himself. And after a while I forgot what he looked like. I remembered him only as a glass cabinet and a flashing camera. The only name I had for him was [MASK].
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Ade	In the arc of lights I saw the forms of people leaping into the air, leaping, some of them, into invisibility; leaping, others, into new forms. Finally, the car cut through the crowd, and knocked [MASK] and one of the beggars sideways.
<name>Rimbaud</name>	Rimbaud	Death	There is a silence which makes you fly. If your heart is a friend of Time nothing can destroy you. [MASK] has taught me the religion of living - I am converted -I am blinded - I am beginning to see - I am drunk on sleep -
<name>There</name>	There	Writhing	I noticed something moving behind the lamp. I looked. [MASK], its head green, its eyes scaly, was a large lizard. I moved slowly, felt for an object on the floor, touched a stone, and struck the lizard on the head.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Ade	Your mother is almost ill with worrying about you.’ A dark glow surrounded him. He came into the room. [MASK] retreated to the window. His father sat on the bed. I could smell the frustration and the anxieties in his night-long sweat.
<name>Akaky</name>	Akaky	Azaro	‘[MASK], prepare your bed.’ I got up in the dark, moved the centre table, and unrolled my mat. I lay down. The creditors’ feet were all around my head. The landlord went on chewing.
<name>bullfrog</name>	bullfrog	Adam	There was one with a massive head like a great bronze sculpture eaten by time. Another had a swollen [MASK]’s apple. Yet another had two of the most protruding and watchful eyes I have ever seen. They seemed to have been made by a perverse and drunken god.
<name>Anya</name>	Anya	Ade	She unwrapped several notes and gave them to me. At first, looking over at [MASK], I refused. But she pressed them on me, shutting my fingers tightly. ‘If your mother asks, tell her you found them in the forest, eh?’
<name>Abiku</name>	Abiku	Helen	We need votes. I’m going to Madame Koto’s party. Dress up. Go and wash your face. You are going to be my subaltern.’ ‘What about the girl?’ ‘What girl?’ ‘[MASK], the beggar.’
<name>Ants</name>	Ants	Ants	[MASK] swarmed all over them. At intervals I passed people who were sitting behind trees. When I looked back they were no longer there. Nude women appeared and vanished before my gaze. The smell of earth, leaves, sun, and the merest hint of dried excrement overpowered my senses.
<name>Snakes</name>	Snakes	Snakes	‘Because’, he said, ‘if you don’t listen to me, and if you go, you will drown in a pit. [MASK] will crawl into your mouth.’ The wind sprayed my face. ‘Come here,’ he said.
<name>Chike</name>	Chike	Azaro	‘Shut up, [MASK]. We are protected, you hear. We are fortified against invaders and wicked people. Nothing evil will enter our lives.’ He paused, creaked his bones, and continued. ‘A single thought of ours could change the universe.
<name>Azathoth</name>	Azathoth	Spirits	The beggar laughed. I turned, looked at him, and screamed. He had four heads. One of them was the head of a great turtle. I tried to move but he held me. [MASK], shrouded in sunflower flames, rose from the ground about me.
<name>The fly</name>	The fly	Flies	Then, as if they had ears outside the bar, as if they had smelt something a long distance away, they both got up and ran out through the backyard door. [MASK] buzzed in the silence. I went to the backyard and looked around.
<name>China</name>	China	Beauty	I was struck by the gentleness of her voice when she spoke next. ‘Do you know what my mother said to me in a dream?’ ‘No.’ ‘She said there is a reason why the world is round. [MASK] will rule the world.
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Madame	‘Too much.’ The silence in the bar was incredible. Then the midget laughed. He laughed like a goat. The tall man with small eyes laughed as well. He sounded like a hyena. ‘Name your price, [MASK].’
<name>Chichikov</name>	Chichikov	Ade	‘Ah ha, so it’s you, the flying wizard!’ he shouted triumphantly. [MASK] screamed. I clubbed the old man. His helpers rained knocks on me. I threw bones and sticks at them.
<name>Fear</name>	Fear	Suspicion	Sorcerers, taking the form of spirits and omens, whispered to us of dread. We grew more afraid. [MASK] made it easier for us to be silent. Silence made it easier for us to be more powerless. The forms of dominance grew more colossal in the nightspaces.
<name>Millicent</name>	Millicent	Ade	The wind’s counterpoints whistled along the electric cables. The bright yellow and blue bulbs kept going on and off. Then they stayed on. [MASK] said, in the voice of a cat: ‘Something is happening.’ The wind stopped. It swelled again.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Ade	When we saw that he didn’t run [MASK] over, the rest of us didn’t move either when he threatened us. Terror always seized me though, when the car screeched to a halt and I could smell the engine oil smouldering and could see the driver smiling.
<name>Rinaldo</name>	Rinaldo	Sami	[MASK], sweating, went from group to group, from person to person, jotting down their names and their odds and collecting their money in the bucket. Soon another bucket was needed. All the women, the prostitutes, the low-life courtesans, the casual onlookers, brought out their money.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Ade	[MASK], standing at the window, seemed radiant with the glow of his father’s temper. He did not appear repentant or even rebellious. He held his head firm, and his face had the impassivity of one who knew that his father could no longer dare to beat him or make him cry.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Azaro	She wasn’t the only one. The spirits were after me as well, and one of them held his detached arm in the air like a misbegotten club. I fled down the paths. Their heavy footsteps sounded behind me and they shouted my name: ‘[MASK]!
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Ade	He was very tall, his head was bowed, and his face bore the misery of a night-long vigil. [MASK] got up instantly and rubbed his eyes. They were bulbous and inflamed. He had grown paler and more beautiful overnight. His smile had gone.
<name>María</name>	María	Azaro	I hid in the driver’s seat and watched, in that night of blue memories, the drama of the Living that only the Dead can understand. I couldn’t see anything. But from across the street I heard, first in a whisper, then loudly under the spell of grief: ‘[MASK]!
<name>People</name>	People	Flies	The palm-wine got to me fairly quickly and I dozed sitting upright. I woke up when some rowdy customers came in. They smelt of raw meat and animal blood. ‘Palm-wine!’ one of them shouted. [MASK] congregated round the new customers.
<name>Flies</name>	Flies	Flies	There were no lights in the bar. When I went in I thought the place was empty. I moved noiselessly to my place beside the earthenware pot. The front door was partially open. [MASK] buzzed and I could hear the wall-geckos scuttling between the tables.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Success	Suffering will never destroy you, but will make you stronger. [MASK] will never confuse you or scatter your spirit, but will make you fly higher into the good sunlight. Your life will always surprise you.’ Her prayer was so wonderful that everyone was silent afterwards.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Azaro	‘What?’ ‘[MASK].’ He looked at me again, as if I were some sort of sign. ‘Are you clever at school?’ ‘I’m looking for my mother.’ ‘Does your mother teach you things?’
<name>Macomber</name>	Macomber	Ade	‘I don’t know.’ ‘You didn’t hear?’ ‘No.’ ‘I did,’ [MASK] said in the dark. ‘What did he say?’ ‘He said: “OPEN THE DOOR.”’
<name>Mariam</name>	Mariam	Helen	We all got up and followed the cat. Sitting outside our door, her wounds still livid, was [MASK], the beggar girl. We stared at her in puzzlement. Then she got up and went to the housefront. We didn’t follow her.
<name>Hitler</name>	Hitler	Hitler	I pulled myself away from the moon and went back into the bar with her. The bar was full of the oddest people. There was a man in the corner who said loudly that he had just come back from [MASK]’s war. No one believed him.
<name>Shiva</name>	Shiva	Azaro	I heard her gasp. ‘You are bleeding.’ ‘They were going to cut my throat. This is just a small wound. [MASK], my son, they were going to kill your father. Because I won’t vote for them . . .’
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Dogs	The whole area seemed to exhale an odour of struggle and death. [MASK] fought near a well. And from the darkness, out of one of the obscure paths, emerged a figure in a dazzling white smock, bearing a lantern above her.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Azaro	‘If he doesn’t talk he won’t rest. He has prevented my going to work. I want to know what he has been doing.’ ‘[MASK], tell your father where you’ve been.’ ‘I got lost.’ ‘Where?’
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Ade	When I got home the door was locked. [MASK] was playing on the broken political vehicle. He looked lean and was happy to see me. He told me about how the van of the rich people’s party had come along and begun to bundle the beggars away.
<name>Didi</name>	Didi	Goat	‘[MASK] fuck your mother and produce you.’ ‘Shut up!’ ‘Why do you keep telling everyone to shut up?’ ‘You too shut up!’ They fell silent for a while. The wind blew the front door against the outside wall, straining its hinges.
<name>Gollum</name>	Gollum	Lazarus	He picked up another root. It was shaped like a child with a big head. He bit off the head of the child, spat it out, and bit at its arm, and chewed. ‘What is your name?’ ‘[MASK].’
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Ade	When she heard us coming she jumped up and dusted herself. She looked very embarrassed. ‘Who’s your friend?’ she asked, blinking. ‘[MASK],’ I said. She gave him a curious intense scrutiny.
<name>Flanagan</name>	Flanagan	Jeremiah	While the room quivered with jagged drumming on the table, syncopated rhythms of voices, the bottle-music, and general revelry, the photographer from across the road turned up, wearing a white hat. His name was [MASK]. He had a wiry beard, and everyone seemed to know him.
<name>Goat</name>	Goat	Rat	‘I am not cheap.’ ‘You’re cheaper than shit.’ ‘What about you, eh? The men say your anus smells.’ ‘Your cunt smells.’ ‘Even chicken can fuck you.’ ‘[MASK] fuck you.’
<name>They</name>	They	Forms	I couldn’t see the giants any more, or the hoofs of part-time human beings, those who would wreck our hopes for two generations, or the bird-feet of strange women. [MASK] had lost their mutability. ‘What’s wrong with you?’
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Sami	All the women, the prostitutes, the low-life courtesans, the casual onlookers, brought out their money. [MASK] sent for more protection. His entire compound turned up, armed with clubs and dane guns. When he had finished, he was drenched in sweat.
<name>Lucien</name>	Lucien	Ade	Strange dreams, floating on the wind, looking for dreamers, drifted into our room. ‘Tell us a story,’ I said. [MASK] sat up. His limbs were peaceful. ‘Tell us the story of the blue sunglasses.’ ‘Okay.’
<name>happiness</name>	happiness	Kokoro	And she had the most amazing signs tattooed to the sides of her mouth. When she smiled the signs looked odd, but when she was serious they made her look beautiful. She sold me a few pennies’ worth of beans and offered to sell me [MASK] at a discount.
<name>Flanagan</name>	Flanagan	Flies	‘I don’t know. The madame said he was mad.’ ‘Why haven’t you thrown it away?’ ‘I can’t carry it.’ He put the lid back on. He went back to his bench. [MASK] circled the men.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Ade	But [MASK] only cried more and in that sound I knew he wasn’t crying because of his father’s love, or his own guilt, or his mother’s illness, but because the pressure of time was tightening round his neck. TWELVE
<name>Whites</name>	Whites	Bushmen	I dreamt plains, forests, paths, great open spaces, spiked plants, and then I dreamt up the people. They are not like us. They are white. [MASK]. They advanced towards me. They wore strange clothes and had precious stones round their necks.
<name>Wab</name>	Wab	Ade	I clubbed the old man. His helpers rained knocks on me. I threw bones and sticks at them. Then the old man, tightening his grip on [MASK]’s arm said, in a screeching ugly voice: ‘Let me see with your eyes!’
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Ade	[MASK] refused to have anything to do with the car. His father had warned him that it was the work of the devil. She gave me a ride once, and I never forgot it. She sat at the back. I sat at the front.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Azaro	She looked up, saw me, her eyes widening. Suddenly, she screamed. She jumped and threw her hands up and her money went flying everywhere, the coins clattering on the floor. I said: ‘It’s me, [MASK].’
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Independence	‘How was school?’ ‘I don’t like school.’ ‘You must like school. If your father had gone to school we wouldn’t be suffering so much. Learn all you can learn. This is a new age. [MASK] is coming.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Helen	I asked her. ‘[MASK],’ she said. ‘Do you like my father?’ She said nothing for a while. Then, as I was about to move, she said: ‘Maybe it’s you that I like.’ I didn’t understand.
<name>Kambili</name>	Kambili	Ade	The tramps, who had come because of the rumours of a feast, the people who had turned up to hail their new hero, the wretched and the curious, were all washed away by the gentle flood. [MASK]’s father left with his wives, carrying my friend away on his back.
<name>Adaku</name>	Adaku	Azaro	She looked very dignified in her white magic beads and her elaborate wrappers and her massive blouse. She was dressed as if she were going to see wealthy relations. ‘[MASK], what happened to you?’ ‘I was lost.’ ‘You just disappeared.’
<name>Amalinze</name>	Amalinze	Hitler	‘[MASK] died years ago,’ someone said. ‘I killed him,’ said the loud man. ‘How?’ ‘I used a special juju. I blew pepper into his eyes and his moustache stood up and I killed him with this knife.’
<name>Trees</name>	Trees	Trees	Women’s voices intervened. The fight died down with subsiding abuses. Someone put a record on the phonograph and a deep octave voice, lifted by brass instruments, sang out into the evening. The wind blew. [MASK] bowed. A procession of beggars came down the road.
<name>Landor</name>	Landor	Ade	One of the people who had pushed him was our landlord. ‘The first attack!’ cried the blind old man. I hated him intensely. ‘Have you got another frog?’ I asked [MASK]. ‘No. But I’ve got this.’
<name>Beloved</name>	Beloved	Ade	[MASK] wanted to leave, to become a spirit again, free in the captivity of freedom. I wanted the liberty of limitations, to have to find or create new roads from this one which is so hungry, this road of our refusal to be.
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Ade	I felt sad. [MASK] smiled strangely again, sinking deeper into his weird epileptic ecstasy. I leant over him. ‘Trouble is always coming. Maybe it’s just as well,’ he said. ‘Your story has just begun. Mine is ending.
<name>Emeka</name>	Emeka	Lizards	Flies spiralled in the air. I noticed a Coca-Cola poster on the wall. It had the picture of a half-naked white woman with big breasts. [MASK] ran into the bar, stopped in the middle of the floor, and saluted me, nodding.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Azaro	There was an impressive new exhaustion on her face. She stood beneath the tree, fixing me with a stare, and said: ‘[MASK], what are you doing?’ ‘Nothing.’ ‘Do you think you are a bird?’ ‘No.’
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Ade	I banged him on the head with a stick and he relaxed his grip and protected his head and uttered low cries. Me and [MASK] fled from him, with the noise of his wail amplified by the forest. When we got back to the tent the fight was turning.
<name>Alvaro</name>	Alvaro	Ade	The field shook. The river hurled its waters on the coral shores, the water turned into spray, and in the spray I saw my spirit companions, all of them holding blue mirrors over their heads. My friend, [MASK], was among them.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Ade	[MASK] did not want to stay any more, he did not like the weight of the world, the terror of the earth’s time. Love and the anguish of parents touched him only faintly, for beyond their stares and threats and beatings he knew that his parents’ guardianship was temporary.
<name>Stars</name>	Stars	Flies	Another man caught me, and twirled me on. I became dizzy. [MASK] did somersaults in my eyes. I became lost in the curious jungle of the crowd, lost in the midst of giants. The bar seemed to keep expanding. The density of bodies got worse.
<name>David</name>	David	Ade	The world was old that morning. Out in the street his father caught him and lifted him up and [MASK] began to cry unbearably as all the murky lights from the ghetto and the filthy untarred road and the broken-down houses and the ulcerous poverty converged on him.
