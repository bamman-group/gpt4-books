<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Penny	The thing that was happening was for [MASK] to handle. He ran back again. He lifted the torch high in his hand. The wolves had invaded the lot and killed the heifer calf. A band of them, three dozen or more, milled about the enclosure.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Penny	The thick hammock might have been a cypress slough. The giant live oaks, the hickories, the sweet gums, the magnolias, the orange trees, stood deep in a turgid wetness. [MASK] said, “Let’s try the road.”
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Buck	We best drop her and be done with it.” He shot. The dogs were on her the instant she hit the ground. If there was a spark of life, it was at once snuffed out. [MASK] climbed up the low tree and shook the limb.
<name>Grampa</name>	Grampa	Penny	They were the tracks of a giant bear. And from the print of the right front paw, as big as the crown of a hat, one toe was missing. “Old Slewfootl” [MASK] nodded. “I’m proud you remembered his track.”
<name>Gus</name>	Gus	Penny	He stood beaming. “Now ain’t this our day, boy? Ain’t this jest our day?” They dressed the buck. [MASK] said, “I mistrust kin old Gesar tote all we got.” “I’ll walk.
<name>Trapper</name>	Trapper	Penny	Well, to my notion, wet fur’s wet fur.” “Now I like the smell o’ wet fur,” [MASK] said. “I mind me one time, on a long hunt, I had me no coat and the weather turned cold.
<name>his dog</name>	his dog	Flag	His feet dragged. He lay down by the road in the sun for a rest and induced [MASK] to lie beside him. He was drugged with hunger and misery and the strong March sun on his head. He fell asleep. When he awakened.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jody	He said, “He didn’t know what he was doin’.” “I know, [MASK], but the harm’s as bad to the ’taters as if he done it for meanness. We got scarcely enough rations now to do the year.”
<name>Old Dan</name>	Old Dan	Julia	He went to the smoke-house and cut strips of ’gator tail for the dogs. He was ready. He trudged through the yard to the lot to take up the trail. He whistled for the dogs and put [MASK] on the track.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Buck	[MASK] said, “He’s dead.” The words had no meaning. They were only two brown leaves that blew past him into the air. But a coldness followed their passing, and a numbness took him. He was confused.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Jody	Far away, a red-bird sang richly, coming closer and closer, until [MASK] saw him drift to the Baxter drinking trough. A flock of turtle doves whirred in, to drink briefly, then flew away to their roosting places in the adjoining pine forest.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jody	[MASK] was weak at thought of what might have happened to the fawn. He ran to the shed to comfort it, and found it drowsy and unconcerned. He stroked it gratefully, then returned to the men and the bear.
<name>Mrs. Rachel</name>	Mrs. Rachel	Heaven	Did they kill the calf?" “They kilt it.” “Oh dear [MASK]! And hit a heifer!” She followed him about while he poured hot water in a basin and bathed the dogs’ wounds. They were not serious.
<name>he</name>	he	Penny	He was not afraid of lynx or wild-cat, but a panther had been known to attack a horse. His heart thumped. He fingered the stock of his father’s gun. It was useless, for [MASK] had shot both barrels, one at the rattler, one at the doe.
<name>Old Man</name>	Old Man	Penny	Don’t let him git under them bonnets. Keep the tip o’ your pole up. Don’t give him no slack.” [MASK] left him to the struggle. His arms ached from the strain. He was afraid to tug too hard for fear of breaking the line.
<name>the pantry</name>	the pantry	Grandma	Food from it was more mysterious than from the open hearth at home. The closed door concealed all manner of things behind its black bosom. The cake had dulled his appetite a little, but the good odors brought it back again. He wandered back and forth from [MASK] to his father.
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	Penny	It was made of untrimmed saplings and a limber sapling had been baited to spring the gate behind the crowding hogs. “Them rascals was nearby, waitin’,” [MASK] said. “That pen wouldn’t hold a hog no time.”
<name>George</name>	George	Jody	He tied them invisibly to the fish-hooks. “If I was a fish. I’d strike at this myself,” he said. He went to the house and spoke briefly with his wife. “Me and [MASK] is goin’ bobbin’ for bass.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jody	The day was bright and windy. [MASK] took a grubbing hoe from the shed behind the house and strolled toward the road. The mulberry trees by the fence were a sharp green. His mother’s favorite hen clucked to her biddies from the slat coop.
<name>Mammy</name>	Mammy	Penny	[MASK] stopped him, laughing. “You tell her all them things, you’ll leave nothin’ good for her to find out about him. Then she mought find out some o’ the bad.” “They’s nothin’ bad about him,” he said passionately.
<name>Chris</name>	Chris	Jody	In the afternoon, [MASK] found himself tired with a fatigue born of hunger. He had left the house without breakfast. He had wanted only to get away. He looked along the road for berries to eat, but it was too early and there were none.
<name>The narrator</name>	The narrator	Jody	They were no more than conscious that she spoke to them. They had seen a thing that was unearthly. They were in a trance from the strong spell of its beauty. •11- The fawns were being born. [MASK] saw through the scrub the delicate tracery of their small pointed hooves.
<name>Uncle Remus</name>	Uncle Remus	Buck	[MASK] said, “Your Ma wouldn’t romp on your Pa while he was ailin’, would she?” “She don’t never romp on him with nothin’ but talkin’.” “I’d a heap rather a woman tore me down with a lighter’d knot, than spcakin’ sharp.”
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Penny	[MASK] had spent two evenings during the storm in making low-mould shot and in loading his own shells. He had a month’s supply filled and capped and ready for use. He filled his shot-bag and polished the barrels of his gun.
<name>Uncle Remus</name>	Uncle Remus	Penny	Then when their horns were grown, and they began to run with the does in the autumn, they would drive the fawns away from the does, and batde fiercely. One buck was larger than the other. “That un there’s a buck big enough to ride,” [MASK] said.
<name>Jem</name>	Jem	Flag	Now you listen to me. You got to be good, now you’re growed. You cain’t go gallivantin’ acrost no thaccy. Don’t you git Pa down on you. You listenin’?” [MASK] chewed ruminatively. “All right, then.
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Penny	If the horse were ready and waiting, they might get off before his mother discovered some fresh pretext for detaining him. He saw [MASK] coming down the sand road from the west, bowed under the ox-yoke with the two heavy wooden buckets brimming with water.
<name>Cookie</name>	Cookie	Cap	“I don’t know.” “Hey, [MASK], the young un don’t even know when he et last.” “Give him plenty but feed him slow. Don’t give him too much or he’ll puke in my bunk.”
<name>Deer</name>	Deer	Deer	But the wolves had never before descended on the clearing in a band. [MASK] and small animals had been plentiful to feed them. Only a few had come, singly or in pairs, skulking about timorously, running at the first alarm. They had never before been a major menace.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Jody	[MASK] looked over his shoulder. The camp site was desolate. The charred logs, the gray ashes, were forlorn. The magic had died out with the flames of the camp-fire. The morning had been cool but the climbing sun began to heat the day.
<name>me</name>	me	Jody	He came to [MASK] to be scratched behind the ears. He leaped back and forth in a zig-zag across the fence, then stopped under a mulberry tree and reached up to catch the tip of a bough.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Jody	[MASK] had almost decided that he would have to lead it back and shut it up in the shed, when of its own accord it sought the shade and lay down. It lay watching him from the corner of one big eye, its head in its favorite position, twisted back against its own shoulder.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Hit	A creetur’s got his livin’ to make and he makes it the best way he kin. Same as us. [MASK]’s panther nature and wolf nature and bear nature to kill their meat. County lines is nothin’ to them, nor a man’s fences.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Jody	Her teeth were bared, her long tail switched back and forth, her claws worked on the oak limb. She seemed about to drop on the first creature, man or dog, to move closer. The dogs were wild. [MASK] called out, “I want the cubs!
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Penny	[MASK] was working deftly. His hunting knife, a flat saw-file ground down to an edge, with only a corn-cob for handle, was not overly sharp, but he had already drawn the venison and cut off the heavy head.
<name>he</name>	he	Jody	But perhaps, [MASK] speculated, he did have the fever. Perhaps he was coming down with the measles. He felt his face and stomach. There was no rash yet, no sweat. He flounced back and forth in the bed to hurry the heating.
<name>Zora</name>	Zora	Buck	[MASK] said, “I mean.” They could go no farther east and turned north, skirting the low waters. Where there had been swamp, there were ponds. Where there had been hammock, there was swamp. Only the high infertile scrub had turned aside the devastation.
<name>Pap</name>	Pap	Jody	[MASK] shivered. “He slipped in like a shadow and killed our brood-sow. Laid her open, end to end, and only ate a mouthful. Not hongry. Jest low-down and mean.”
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Jody	Now there’s a thing ever’ man has got to know. Mebbe you know it a’ready. Twa’n’t only me. Twa’n’t only your yearlin’ deer havin’ to be destroyed. Boy, life goes back on you.” [MASK] looked at his father. He nodded.
<name>Old Dan</name>	Old Dan	Flag	There was happiness tangled with his grief that was both comforting and unbearable. He said, “I reckon I best go feed him. I best go feed [MASK].” He slid from his chair and went outside with the cup of milk and the biscuits.
<name>Uncle Remus</name>	Uncle Remus	Penny	Hornin’ in on our rations and leavin’ sich as this to happen.” “Ain’t a dog borned as smart as that bear,” [MASK] said. “They could of barked.” She threw another stick and the dogs slunk away.
<name>Mammy</name>	Mammy	Ory	They went to the house. Hot supper was on the table and he ate quickly and lightly, then went directly to his bed. “[MASK], what’d you take to rub my back with panther oil?” She came and worked on him with big strong hands.
<name>who</name>	who	Jody	‘There’s nary a man livin’, [MASK], has even heered his grand-pappy say he’d ever seed a Spaniard. The Spaniards come from acrost the ocean, and went tradin’ and fightin’ and marchin’ acrost Floridy, and no man knows where they’re gone.”
<name>Cooper</name>	Cooper	Jody	“I reckon they had to, when they stopped to camp. They had Injuns to fight and bears and panther-cats. Same as us, only we ain’t got the Injuns.” [MASK] stared about him. The pine-woods were suddenly populous.
<name>Jake</name>	Jake	Jody	We’ll need all our shots here.” “All right.” “[MASK], you ride down jest inside the edge o’ the woods 296 yonder. When you git opposite that tallest pine, you cut right back acrost the marsh towards us here.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Penny	Did they yearn to warm their thin transparent hands at a hunter’s camp-fire? [MASK] eased himself to his feet and fumbled for a pine knot for a torch. He lit it at the fire and started forward cautiously. The sighing sound had ceased.
<name>Forrester</name>	Forrester	Hutto	He wondered what his mother would have said if he had told her the Forresters had played and sung naked. He looked over his shoulder. [MASK]’s landing had disappeared around the bend. He was suddenly not happy in the fluid darkness. He turned around.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Buck	He followed [MASK] into the house. The For-rester men sat all together. There was a oneness about them, sitting so, motionless and heavy. They were pieces of one great dark rock, broken into separate men.
<name>Mr. Thomas</name>	Mr. Thomas	Jody	But they were rotting and would be a total loss if they were not dug. [MASK] worked long hours at them. He must be careful to go deeply enough with the potato fork and not go too close to the middle of the beds.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Penny	And two women could say the same words and the meaning would not be the same, as the bark of two dogs, one menacing and the other friendly. [MASK] said, “Lemme git us a fire goin’. My breath’s too froze to talk.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Penny	They themselves had not discovered the kill until the day after it had happened. It had been too late to follow. [MASK] thanked him for the information. “I reckon I’ll set a trap inside the lot, jest to scare him,” he said.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Penny	He was ashamed of himself for having taken time to cry. It was no time to cry. He would have to think. He would have to study his way out of it, as [MASK] did out of things that threatened him. At first he conjectured wildly.
<name>Will</name>	Will	Buck	I’ll carve on it, ‘Here lies a Forrester, mourned by all his kin.’ ” He grinned broadly and slapped the covers of his bed. “Give in, [MASK],” he said, “give in.”
<name>him</name>	him	Penny	He grunted to himself. It was peculiarly difficult to know ahead of time what would get him into trouble and what would keep him out. However, when his mother was angry at [MASK], she seldom noticed anything he did. She smoothed down through the afternoon.
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	Penny	He concentrated on light bread and mayhaw jelly. [MASK] said, “He’ll be so spoiled, his Ma’ll have to break him in like a new bird-dog.” After dinner they walked together through the garden to “
<name>Eustace</name>	Eustace	Penny	His silence was a nightmare, too. At last he spoke. “Couldn’t you tell what ’twas, done it?” He looked at his father. His eyes were desperate and beseeching. [MASK] said, “Nc’ mind.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Fenny	[MASK] said, “Yes, but the land snakes likely got kctched in their holes.” The flood had reached everywhere, like the searching fingers of a ’coon, and had torn out all the things for whom the solid earth was their only refuge.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jody	A hurricane Battens the crops and drowns the pore sailors and takes the oranges offen the trees. And down south, why, boy, hit tears down houses and cold-out kills people." [MASK] said meekly, “I won’t wish it agin.
<name>Jock</name>	Jock	Jody	To the south and east there was a great silence. The scrub was always silent, yet [MASK] realized now that there had always been an undertone of cry and movement, where the creatures called and stirred, no more discernible than the wind.
<name>Forresters</name>	Forresters	Grandma	The landing looked far away. His shirt and breeches interfered with his freedom. He wished he had gone in naked. [MASK] would not have minded. He wondered what his mother would have said if he had told her the Forresters had played and sung naked.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Flag	Betrayal was intolerable. If [MASK] had died, if bear or wolf or panther had slipped in on him, he would have grieved with a great grief, but he could have endured it. He would have turned to his father, and his father would have comforted him.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Penny	But fifty yards in front of him a black body that had been upright, lay half-sunk in the water. [MASK] shouted, “Nice shootin’, boy!” and rode forward. The remaining bears were scrambling across the swamp like paddle boats, churning the water behind them.
<name>He</name>	He	Jody	He was breathing heavily. He panted, “He’s like to give us the slip.” When his breath came more easily, he set out again. [MASK] dropped behind, but across a patch of low hammock found better going and was able to catch up.
<name>Jewel</name>	Jewel	Buck	He offered, “I done fed and watered the bear cub and the squirrel and them.” [MASK] touched a switch to a heifer. He said, “I remembered them oncet today, and then my mind went black agin.”
<name>the whale</name>	the whale	Flag	He remembered the smell of the fisherman’s meat and biscuit. His mouth watered. He ate some stalks of grass. He ripped the joints with his teeth, as animals ripped flesh. Instantly he saw creatures creeping in to [MASK]’s carcass. He vomited the grass.
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Jody	He said, “I should of washed. I’m awful dirty.” “There’s warm water on the hearth.” [MASK] poured water in the basin and scrubbed his face and arms and hands. The water was too dark even for his feet.
<name>nothing</name>	nothing	Penny	The flutter-mill had lost its comfort. He said, “Play-dolly--” He kicked it apart with one foot. The broken bits floated down the creek. He threw himself on the ground and sobbed bitterly. There was no comfort anywhere. There was [MASK].
<name>Jerry</name>	Jerry	Jody	[MASK] drew a deep breath. He threw himself on the weedy sand close to the water and abandoned himself to the magic of motion. Up, over, down, up, over, down—the flutter-mill was enchanting.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Jody	At the far end of the field he began walking across the ends of the rows. He stopped at each row and focussed the light from the fire-pan down the length of the field. Mid-way he stopped. He turned and nudged [MASK].
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Jody	It loomed large, yet he was conscious that such details as eyes and ears were still not plain to him. He waited for what seemed an interminable period. The buck lifted his head. [MASK] drew a bead on the stout neck. He pulled the trigger.
<name>Jem</name>	Jem	Buck	They approached the bee tree cautiously. The smudge had been properly placed. The bees were drugged with the heavy smoke. They swarmed slowly around the cavity, searching for their queen. [MASK] split a wider opening and used his sheath knife to hack away the edges.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Penny	If it were only an ordinary hunt, he would almost rather stay home with him. But [MASK] had said that they meant to kill off the last wolf in the scrub, and he might never see another again as long as he lived.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Penny	Then I’ll leave you fry that backstrap when I’m done with the pan.” He sliced the palm-hearts thinly. “Where’s the grease, [MASK]?” “In a bottle in the crocus sack.”
<name>Doc</name>	Doc	Jody	He was known far and wide as a good doctor, drunk or no. If he could be reached in time, [MASK] thought, his father’s life was certain. He turned from the Forresters’ lane into the road that ran east to his father’s clearing.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Flag	Then they were gone before he could pull the trigger. With [MASK], he could say, “There come the wolves, slippin’ in to the pond,” and he could sit and see the whole thing, and feel the feelings again, the fears and the sharp ecstasies.
<name>Mrs. Beaver</name>	Mrs. Beaver	Penny	The scent lay now, not underfoot, but on the reeds and grasses where the strong-smelling fur had brushed. She laid her long nose against a bulrush and stared into space, then, satisfied as to direction, splashed due south at a lively pace. [MASK] spoke now freely.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Hounds	You hurted the leetle thing, not meanin’ no harm. She cain’t bring herself to trust you. [MASK] is often that-a-way.” He made a circle around the sheds and corn-crib and cut south through the black-jack.
<name>John Grady</name>	John Grady	Jody	He was still in a daze. It was only as he swung open the gate under the chinaberry that he remembered he had forgotten to look behind the magnolia tree for a Spaniard riding. [MASK] clicked the gate behind him. The unmistakable smell of roasting meat filled the air.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jody	[MASK] scuffled his feet in the sand. “I don’t keer. I hate her.” “I don’t know what to say. How on earth come you to do it?” “I jest hate her. She made a face at me.
<name>she</name>	she	Oliver	“I couldn’t rightly say. Been so long sincet I was a young buck, studyin’ on courtin’, I dis-remember how [MASK] mought figger." “Anyways, he hadn’t ought to of let her foller him that-a-way.”
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Joe	Well, if I was a scrawny little big-eyed booger like you, I’d stay home. Nobody but your folks’ll bother with a little ol’ shirt-tail boy like you. Swing him down to the dock, [MASK].” Brawny arms lifted him down.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Jody	“Likely he’s headin’ for the saw-grass ponds. Iffen that’s his notion, we kin mebbe slip around and surprise him.” Some understanding came to [MASK] of the secret of his father’s hunting.
<name>Jody</name>	Jody	Jody	Now he went ahead, drilling his holes with a pointed stick down the long rows. [MASK] followed, dropping two kernels to the hole. He was anxious to please, to have his father forget the shrunken tobacco patch.
<name>Wilson</name>	Wilson	Penny	Leave him to the dogs. I got a idee slow time’ll prove the fastest.” They pushed through steadily. [MASK] said, “We got this much satisfaction, he’s wore out, too.” He underestimated his enemy. The chase continued.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Jody	“I wisht I could git the dogs on them beasts one at a time,” he said grimly. In the warm safety of the house, bold now because his mother was afraid, [MASK] could speak at last. “Will they be back tonight.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Boy	He frowned. “[MASK], you know as good as I do, you got to keep that yearlin’ outen the fields.” “I’ll keep him out. He ain’t bothered nary thing.” “That’s fine. That’s jest fine.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Jody	He said, “Now give [MASK] and me a day-two to hunt some, and mebbe we kin carry some meat and hides to the store and you kin trade to your heart’s content.” The first day’s hunt brought nothing.
<name>The boy</name>	The boy	Jody	The rattler struck him from under the grape-vine without warning. [MASK] saw the flash, blurred as a shadow, swifter than a martin, surer than the slashing claws of a bear. He saw his father stagger backward under the force of the blow.
<name>Boone</name>	Boone	Jody	[MASK] was trembling so violently that when he lifted his gun he could see nothing in front of him but a blur of water. He forced himself to steady his aim. His bear was quartering from him, but he was able to draw a bead on the left cheek from the rear.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Jody	Two others were high in a larger tree. [MASK], as the lightest and nimblest, climbed after them. They climbed higher above him, then scrambled out on a limb. He edged along the limb. It was ticklish work to shake it without falling off himself.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Buck	Vandals had visited it during the night. Half a row of com had been stripped of its ears. Mid-way of the row lay a pile of corn-husks. [MASK] said, “You know what done that?” “’Coons?”
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Buck	The men rode in close on the two wounded animals. They fired again and the game lay still. The unharmed bears were vanishing before their eyes. No game was quicker or cleverer. [MASK] said, “Now we never figgered on gittin’ these scapers outen the water.”
<name>Uncle Remus</name>	Uncle Remus	Penny	[MASK] stretched out his feet to the embers on the hearth. “I mis-doubt it’s in shape to ketch itself a square meal. I’d not dream o’ botherin’ it. A bear’ll finish it, or a panther.
<name>Old Ben</name>	Old Ben	Penny	[MASK] said, “Flood or no flood, this is fine. I want you fellers to promise me one thing. When I’m an old man, set me on a stump and leave me listen to the hunt. Don’t go off and leave me in the bay.”
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Jody	“I don’t like it. Hit looks mighty boogerish.” In the night, a gust of wind moved through and slammed both doors. The fawn came to [MASK]’s bed and poked its muzzle against his face. He took it up on the bed with him.
<name>he</name>	he	Buck	They crept from row to row. This time he saw the glowing eyes before [MASK] saw them. He advanced down the row as before. The shotgun was a delight to handle. It was lighter than the old muzzle-loader, not so long, and easier to sight.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Buck	Smoke drifted from the chimney. The smell of fat pine blended with frying meat. He trailed after [MASK], driving the cows to water. He offered, “I done fed and watered the bear cub and the squirrel and them.”
<name>Jem</name>	Jem	Jody	She wore her blue sun-bonnet but carried her black frilled bonnet to put on when she should approach the village. It was pleasant, jogging down the sand road in the wagon. [MASK] sat on the floor of the wagon body with his back against the seat.
<name>Jody</name>	Jody	Jody	It seemed to [MASK] that he would burst if there was further delay. He dashed in to his room and routed out his heavy cow* hide brogans from under the bed. He slipped his feet into them and raced after his father as though the hunt would be done and over before he reached him.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Jody	His father left him alone to rake hay and load the wagon 268 equal footing at last, the weak and the strong brought together to earth, the sharp-toothed and the dull, the clawless and the clawed. [MASK] asked, “Will ever’thing die?”
