<name>Josephine</name>	Josephine	Connie	It amazed and stunned [MASK]. But there he would sit, with a blank entranced expression on his face, like a person losing his mind, and listen, or seem to listen, to the unspeakable thing. Was he really listening?
<name>George</name>	George	Clifford	Anyhow, he was a curious, quick, separate fellow, alone, but sure of himself. [MASK] started the little engine, the man carefully turned the chair, and set it nose-forwards to the inchne that curved gently to the dark hazel thicket.
<name>rabbits</name>	rabbits	Michaelis	That healthy boy with his fresh, clumsy sensuality that she had then been so scornful of! Where would she find it now? It was gone out of men. They had their pathetic, two-seconds spasms like [MASK]; but no healthy human sensuality, that warms the blood and freshens the whole being.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Clifford	And the flame of strength went down his back and his loins, reviving him. And she bent suddenly and kissed his hand. Meanwhile the back of [MASK]’s head was held sleek and motionless, just in front of them.
<name>Hamish</name>	Hamish	Connie	She looked so maidenly, so did [MASK]; but he well knew the stone of Scottish obstinacy underneath. “She’s a little thinner,” he said. “Haven’t you done anything about it?” “Do you think it necessary?”
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Cbfford	she persisted. “I have such a terrible mistrust of the future.” “But you needn’t be troubled by any responsibihty. [MASK] would have it as his own, he’d be glad.” She saw him go pale, and recoil under this.
<name>Bunter</name>	Bunter	Betts	“Oh, nothing: just his manner; and he said he knew nothing about keys.” “There may be one in father’s study. [MASK] knows them all; they’re all there. I’ll get him to look.” “Oh, do!”
<name>Mr. Bingley</name>	Mr. Bingley	Connie	I do hope you are better.” “Yes, thanks, I’m all right.” ‘ ‘We’ve hardly seen you all winter. Will you come in and look at the baby?” “Well!” [MASK] hesitated. “Just for a minute.”
<name>Mr. Jaggers</name>	Mr. Jaggers	Clifford	[MASK] sat with a fixed face as the chair slowly mounted. When they came to the top of the rise he stopped; he would not risk the long and very jolty downslope. He sat looking at the greenish sweep of the riding downwards, a clear way through the bracken and oaks.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Clifford	[MASK] loved the wood; he loved the old oak trees. He felt they were his own through generations. He wanted to protect them. He wanted this place inviolate, shut off from the world. The chair chuffed slowly up the incline, rocking and jolting on the frozen clods.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Connie	[MASK]’s heart gave a lurch, at the terrible finality of it. “Brought him home!” “Why did he get killed, do you think?” she asked. “He was happy with you?” It was a woman’s question to a woman.
<name>Lady Grantham</name>	Lady Grantham	Connie	and you have to flatter them and wheedle them and let them think they’re having their own way. Don’t you find it so, my Lady?” “I’m afraid I haven’t much experience.” [MASK] paused in her occupation.
<name>Nietzsche</name>	Nietzsche	Bolshevism	We think we’re gods . . . men like gods! It’s just the same as [MASK]. One has to be human, and have a heart and a penis, if one is going to escape being either a god or a bolshevist . . .
<name>Bernard</name>	Bernard	Olive	“All the love business, for example; it might just as well go. I suppose it would if we could breed babies in bottles.” “No!” cried [MASK]. “That might leave all the more room for fun.”
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Clifford	“And suppose he’d come while you were running about in the rain with nothing on, like a maniac?” “I suppose he’d have had the fright of his life, and cleared out as fast as he could.” [MASK] still stared at her transfixed.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Connie	I don’t believe it.” There was a pause. “But don’t you see,” said [MASK]. “I must go away from you, and I must live with the man I love.” “No, I don’t see it!
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Clifford	The curious thing was that when this child-man, which [MASK] was now and which he had been becoming for years, emerged into the world, he was much sharper and keener than the real man he used to be.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Tevershall	They, too, had to have their providers. And it was a much grimmer business, providing for the populace of work, than for the populace of pleasure. While he was doing his stories, and “getting on” in the world, [MASK] was going to the wall.
<name>The caretaker</name>	The caretaker	Betts	But that was most unlikely: not one chance in a hundred. [MASK] had not yet locked up. He fastened up the house at ten o’clock, and unfastened it again at seven in the morning. She slipped out silently and unseen.
<name>Mrs. Hudson</name>	Mrs. Hudson	Connie	You could spare your key for so long.” “Ah canna tell yer, m’lady! Ah know nob’dy as ma’es keys round ’ere.” [MASK] suddenly flushed with anger. “Very well!” she said. “I’ll see to it.”
<name>one</name>	one	Field	I see other men carried in litter-chairs, who have been wounded in the war. Besides, we’d motor all the way.” “We should need to take two men.” “Oh, no! We’d manage with [MASK].
<name>Myrtle</name>	Myrtle	Tha	And in between, folded in the secret warmth, the secret entrances! He stroked her tail with his hand, long and subtly taking in the curves and the globefulness. “[MASK]’s got such a nice tail on thee,” he said, in the throaty caressive dialect.
<name>Redmond</name>	Redmond	Clifford	Of course, I wouldn’t repeat it for the world, if there were no foundation.” “Well, Sir,” said [MASK] uneasily, but with strange bright eyes. “There is a hope. There is a hope.”
<name>Curley's</name>	Curley's	Jane	Poor little lady [MASK]!” “Don’t say those things!” she said. “You only say them to hurt me.” He dropped his head. Then he said, in dialect: “Ay, maybe I do, maybe I do!
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Daniele	Money, money, money, prostitution and deadness. Y et [MASK] was still a man capable of a man’s free allegiance. He did not wear the gondolier’s blouse: only the knitted blue jersey. He was a little wild, uncouth and proud.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Connie	[MASK] sat and listened with her heart in her boots, as Field was filling petrol. What could possibly become of such a people, a people in whom the living intuitive faculty was dead as nails, and only queer mechanical yells and uncanny will power remained?
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Clifford	For how long?” “For a month or so,” she replied. “[MASK] won’t go.” “He’ll stay here?” he asked. “Yes! He hates to travel as he is.” “Ay, poor devil!”
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Clifford	-s> > nage? She looked at him. “But [MASK], you make eternity sound like a lid or a long, long chain that trailed after one, no matter how far one went.” He looked at her, annoyed.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Clifford	But her love was somehow only an excursion from her marriage with [MASK]; the long, slow habit of intimacy, formed through years of suffering and patience. Perhaps the human soul needs excursions, and must not be denied them. But the point of an excursion is that you come home again.
<name>Isadora</name>	Isadora	Connie	[MASK] was fascinated. And at the same time never had she felt so acutely the agony of her own female forlomness. It was becoming unbearable. She had only one desire now, to go to the clearing in the wood. The rest was a kind of painful dream.
<name>Dick</name>	Dick	Clifford	he was very nice, but somehow you couldn’t associate him with a baby, another generation. He ended in himself. And out of all the rest of [MASK]’s pretty wide acquaintance, there was not a man who did not rouse her contempt, when she thought of having a child by him.
<name>anyone</name>	anyone	Connie	She now did almost everything for him, and he felt more at home with her, less ashamed of accepting her menial offices, than with [MASK]. She liked handling him. She loved having his body in her charge, absolutely, to the last menial offices.
<name>Nico</name>	Nico	Daniele	The mate he brought was called [MASK]. He was not a regular gondolier, so he had none of the cadger and prostitute about him. He was a sandola man, a sandola being a big boat that brings in fruit and produce from the islands.
<name>The pheasant</name>	The pheasant	Rooks	In front lay the wood, the hazel thicket nearest, the purplish density of oaks beyond. From the wood’s edge rabbits bobbed and nibbled. [MASK] suddenly rose in a black train and went trailing off over the httle slope.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Clifford	She was too feminine to be quite smart. So the men, especially those no longer young, were very nice to her indeed. But, knowing what torture poor [MASK] would feel at the slightest sign of flirting on her part, she gave them no encouragement at all.
<name>Brett</name>	Brett	Connie	But it’s not the same thing. You don’t really care. I doubt, once you’ve really cared, if you can ever really care again.” These words frightened [MASK]. “Do you think one can only care once?” she asked.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Hilda	“For mercy’s sake, don’t brag about your experiences!” said [MASK]. “I’ve never met the man yet who was capable of intimacy with a woman, giving himself up to her. That was what I wanted.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Fie	[MASK] would not let her go after dinner, and she had wanted so much to be alone. She looked at him, but was curiously submissive. “Shall we play a game, or shall I read to you, or what shall it be?”
<name>Louisa</name>	Louisa	Connie	Look here, you and I, we’re made for one another ... hand and glove. Why don’t we marry? Do you see any reason why we shouldn’t?” [MASK] looked at him amazed: and yet she felt nothing.
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Michaelis	[MASK] talked frankly about himself, quite frankly, without affectation, simply revealing his bitter, indifferent, stray-dog’s soul, then showing a gleam of revengeful pride in his success. “But why are you such a lonely bird?”
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Connie	But, of course, she’s coming near her change of life, for she’s years older than he is. And these common, violent women always go partly insane when the change of life comes upon them.”— This was a nasty blow to [MASK].
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Clifford	“Think!” he said. “Think what if folks finds out—Sir [MASK] an’ a’—an’ everybody talkin’—” “Well, I can go away.” ' “Where to?” “Anywhere! I’ve got money of my own.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Connie	It was a habit carried over from the first wife. But there would be a house-party for the grouse, and he wanted to be well ahead. [MASK], sunburnt and handsome, sat in silence, forgetting all about the landscape.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Connie	“Shall we play a game, or shall I read to you, or what shall it be?” he asked uneasily. “You read to me,” said [MASK]. “What shall I read—verse or prose? Or drama?”
<name>me</name>	me	Connie	Everything went on in pretty good order, strict cleanliness, and strict punctuality; even pretty strict honesty. And yet, to [MASK], it was a methodical anarchy. No warmth 1 5 of feeling united it organically. The house seemed as dreary as a disused street.
<name>partner</name>	partner	Connie	“One man’s meat is another man’s poison,” he said, out of the darkness. “But it’s meat an’ drink to me.” The lights flared out. “Don’t make me wait in the morning, [MASK].”
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Mick	But a child, a baby! that was still one of the sensations. She would venture very gingerly on that experiment. There was the man to consider, and it was curious, there wasn’t a man in the world whose children you wanted. [MASK]’s children!
<name>Roland</name>	Roland	Clifford	And once there had been deer, and archers, and monks paddling along on asses. The place remembered, still remembered. [MASK] sat in the pale sun, with the light on his smooth, rather blond hair, his reddish full face inscrutable.
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Clifford	They just went off from the top of their heads as if they were squibs, and expected you to be carried heavenwards along with their own thin sticks. “But I am married already,” she said. “I can’t leave [MASK], you know.”
<name>Lady Bracknell</name>	Lady Bracknell	Hilda	“I don’t follow,” he said. “We have a friend who would probably agree to be named as corespondent, so that your name need not appear,’’ said [MASK]. “You mean a man?” “Of course!”
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Connie	[MASK] had received the shock of vision in her womb, and she knew it; it lay inside her. But with her mind she was inclined to ridicule. A man washing himself in a backyard! No doubt with evilsmelling yellow
<name>Mr. Bingley</name>	Mr. Bingley	Clifford	“Still, I don’t see why he should mind. It’s not his home, after all! It’s not his private abode. I don’t see why I shouldn’t sit there if I want to.” “Quite!” said [MASK].
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Clifford	So now [MASK] would sometimes dictate a letter to her, and she would take it down rather slowly, but correcdy. And he was very patient,- spelling for her the difficult words, or the occasional phrases in French. She was so thrilled, it was almost a pleasure to instruct her.
<name>Ashe</name>	Ashe	Hilda	The happiest times were when she got [MASK] to go with her away across the Lagoon, far across to some lonely shingle-bank, where they could bathe quite alone, the gondola remaining on the inner side of the reef.
<name>Moses</name>	Moses	Moses	That’s [MASK] in the bulrushes.” “You don’t mind, do you, that I’m going away?” she asked wistfully, looking up into his face. But his face was inscrutable, under the heavy brows. He kept it quite blank.
<name>Lady Bracknell</name>	Lady Bracknell	Connie	It looks as if he’d stay to dinner, doesn’t it, my Lady?” “It does rather,” said [MASK]. “Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would give you time to dress in comfort.”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Connie	“Why?” But he shook his head. “Then why don’t you get a divorce? She’ll come back to you one day,” said [MASK]. He looked up at her sharply. “She wouldn’t come within a mile of me.
<name>Mr. Peeper</name>	Mr. Peeper	Connie	he said. “Not bad!” He, too, took a curious pleasure in watching the young things come out. [MASK] crouched in front of the last coop. The three chicks had run in. But still their cheeky heads came poking sharply through the yel-
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Hammond	Y ou’ll never really do what you should do, with a fine mind such as yours. Too much of you goes the other way.” “Maybe it does. . . . and too little of you goes that way, [MASK], my boy, married or not.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Connie	she repeated. “Oh, all right! I’m quite willing. But I’m darned if hanging on waiting for a woman to go off is much of a game for a man. ...” This speech was one of the crucial blows of [MASK]’s life.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Connie	But they all want to separate a woman and a man, if they’re together.” “If they’re physically together,” said [MASK]. “That’s right, my Lady! There’s a lot of hard-hearted folks in the world.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Charlie	“Well, [MASK] and I believe that sex is a sort of communication like speech. Let any woman start a sex conversation with me, and it’s natural for me to go to bed with her to finish it, all in due season.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Connie	“I don’t quite see her presiding at the tea-table.” “Oh, there’s nothing sacrosanct about a silver tea-pot,” said [MASK]. He glanced up at her curiously. “What did you do all afternoon?” he said.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Clifford	“Are you pushing her?” “She won’t do it without.” “Leave her alone. I asked you not.” “She won’t do it.” “Let her try!’’ snarled [MASK], with all his emphasis.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Connie	The whole thing was utterly uninteresting, and she was almost too angry to talk. However, [MASK] had to tell her something of the man’s history. “He! He! What name do you call him by?
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Connie	Save for his hands and wrists and face and neck he was white as milk, with fine slender muscular flesh. To [MASK] he was suddenly piercingly beautiful again, as when she had seen him that afternoon washing himself. Gold of sunshine touched the closed white curtains.
<name>The Misfit</name>	The Misfit	Clifford	“If she has enough petrol and oil—” “Just look carefully and see if you can see anything broken,” snapped [MASK]. The man laid his gun against a tree, took off his coat and threw it beside it. The brown dog sat guard.
<name>Lily</name>	Lily	Constance	[MASK], for her part, had hurried across the park, home, almost without thinking. As yet she had no after-thought. She would be in time for dinner. She was annoyed to find the doors fastened, however, so that she had to ring.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Connie	“Oh, your Ladyship, don’t say that! He’d certainly have sent the two men, and they’d have come straight to the hut. I didn’t know where it was, really.” [MASK] flushed darker with rage, at the suggestion.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Mellors	But now, look here, speaking seriously, what are we going to do about it? Speaking seriously, you know!” Speaking seriously, they didn’t get very far. [MASK], though a little tipsy, was much the soberer of the two.
<name>half-witted</name>	half-witted	Bolshevists	So I even consider our far-famed mental life half-witted. We’re all as cold as cretins, we’re all as passionless as idiots. We’re all of us [MASK], only we give it another name. We think we’re gods . . .
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Clifford	“How do you know?” said her father. She smiled. “How should I know?” “But not [MASK]’s child, of course?” “No! Another man’s.” She rather enjoyed tormenting him. “Do I know the man?”
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Michaelis	[MASK] heard they were in town, and came running with roses. “Why, whatever’s wrong?” he cried. “You’re a shadow of yourself. Why, I never saw such a change! Why ever didn’t you let me know?
<name>Henrietta</name>	Henrietta	Constance	[MASK], his wife, was then twenty-three years old, and he was twenty-nine. His hold on life was marvellous. He didn’t die, and the bits seemed to grow together again. For two years he remained in the doctor’s hands.
<name>the keeper</name>	the keeper	Clifford	She poured tea in silence, absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did want to see the keeper today, to see if it were really real. If it were really real. “Shall I read a little to you afterwards?” said [MASK].
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Connie	“Une immense esperance an traverse la terre,” he read somewhere, and his comment was: “—and it’s damed-well drowned everything worth hav->» mg. [MASK] never really understood him, but in her way, she loved him.
<name>Clarisse</name>	Clarisse	Connie	That was all I wanted, to feel him there with me, warm. And it took me a thousand shocks before I knew he wouldn’t come back, it took me years.” “The touch of him,” said [MASK].
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Connie	But as a matter of fact, though even [MASK] did not know it, down-hill half a mile below the “hotel” was old Stacks Gate, with a little old colliery and blackish old brick dwellings, and a chapel or two and a shop or two and a little pub or two.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Connie	I mean, but for you I am absolutely nothing. I live for your sake and your future. I am nothing to myself.” [MASK] heard it all with deepening dismay and repulsion. It was one of the ghastly half-truths that poison human existence.
<name>Aunt Petunia</name>	Aunt Petunia	Hilda	This can’t go on.” “What can’t go on?” “Haven’t you looked at the child?” asked [MASK], gazing at him full stare. He looked rather like a huge, boiled crayfish, at the moment; or so she thought.
<name>Conway</name>	Conway	Connie	So I thought I’d better come, rather than set all the servants agog.” She spoke nervously. She could still see on [MASK]’s face the smoothness and the half-dream of passion, and she could feel the irritation against herself.
<name>Marianne</name>	Marianne	Connie	Was he really listening? Or was it a sort of soporific he took, whilst something else worked on underneath in him? [MASK] did not know. She fled up to her room, or out of doors to the wood.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Connie	He was there by the time she caught him up. “She did that all right,” he said, referring to the chair. [MASK] looked at the great grey leaves of burdock that grew out ghostly from the edge of the larch-wood.
<name>him</name>	him	Field	You’ve no idea how heavy this chair is.” She went to the back of his chair, and plodded side by side with the keeper, shoving up the pink path. She did not care who saw. “Why not let me wait, and fetch [MASK].
<name>Lena</name>	Lena	Hilda	Apparently he had character. [MASK] began to relent a litde. “But you’ll be through with him in a while,” she said, “and then you’ll be ashamed of having been connected with him. One can’t mix up with the working people.”
<name>the cart</name>	the cart	Clifford	They started on the return journey, [MASK] jolting cautiously down-hill. They came to the dark bottom of the hollow, turned to the right, and after a hundred yards swerved up the foot of the long slope, where bluebells stood in the light.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Connie	He was finding out: and he was getting things into his grip. And he seemed verily to be re-bom. Now life came into him! He had been gradually dying, with [MASK], in the isolated private life of the artist and the conscious being.
<name>Jake</name>	Jake	Connie	[MASK] did not answer. “I hope you had a real man at last,” he said to her after a while, sensually alert. “I did. That’s the trouble. There aren’t many of them about,” she said.
<name>Dr. Benway</name>	Dr. Benway	Winterslow	“How’d you like to be immunized?” [MASK] asked her with an ugly smile. “I hope I am; naturally,” she said. “Anyhow the future’s going to have more sense, and a woman needn’t be dragged down by her functions.”
<name>Birds</name>	Birds	Birds	“Perhaps I can just go down the close with you.” They went down the poor, rabbit-bitten pasture. [MASK] were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A man was calling up the last cows, which trailed slowly over the path-wom pasture.
<name>Miss Kilman</name>	Miss Kilman	Connie	And the woman was not altogether a bully, though her jowl was heavy. There was a touch of appeal in her. “One never should keep these things,” said [MASK]. “That one shouldn’t! One should never have them made!”
<name>Godfrey</name>	Godfrey	Connie	Everything was ridiculous, quite true. But when it came too close and oneself became ridiculous too . . . ? At least people of a different class, like [MASK], were earnest about something. They believed in something.
<name>Leonard</name>	Leonard	Michaelis	She had not been so very keen on [MASK]; till he started it, she did not want him. It was as if she never positively wanted him. But once he had started her, it seemed only natural for her to come to her own crisis with him.
<name>Undine</name>	Undine	Connie	She looked so handsome and so young, and her grey eyes were sometimes marvellous. At the same time, there was a lurking soft satisfaction about her, even of triumph, and private satisfaction. Ugh, that private satisfaction! How [MASK] loathed it!
<name>John</name>	John	Clifford	The bluebells washed blue like flood-water over the broad riding, and lit up the down-hill with a warm blueness. “It’s a very fine color in itself,” said [MASK], “but useless for making a painting.”
<name>Gyp</name>	Gyp	Flossie	The dog [MASK], standing on guard almost between her master’s legs, moved uneasily, eyeing the chair with great suspicion and dislike, and very much perplexed between the three human beings. The tableau vivant remained set among the squashed bluebells, nobody proffering a word.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Hammond	And therein lies the problem. If we took no more notice of the one thing than the other, there’d be no problem. It’s all utterly senseless and poindess; a matter of misplaced curiosity.” “Quite, [MASK], quite!
<name>Ursula</name>	Ursula	Clifford	Why had men never any newness in them, any freshness to come forth with? Stale men! [MASK] stopped the chair at the top of the rise and looked down. The bluebells washed blue like flood-water over the broad riding, and lit up the down-hill with a warm blueness.
<name>Caesar</name>	Caesar	Nero	They are animals you don’t understand and never could. Don’t thrust your illusions on other people. The masses were always the same, and will always be the same. [MASK]’s slaves were extremely little different from our colliers or the Ford motor-car workmen.
<name>Rachel</name>	Rachel	Clifford	“And here are the addresses of two women; I saw one of them, she would do very well; a woman of about fifty, quiet, strong, kind, and in her way cultured. ...” [MASK] only sulked, and would not answer.
