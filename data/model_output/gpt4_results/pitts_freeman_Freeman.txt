<name>John</name>	John	Sam	“Well, what you expect? You’s a nigger, ain’t you?” [MASK] considered the question. Finally, he said, “No, I’m not. As I told you before: I am a Negro. I am a colored man.”
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Prudence	In physical deportment, intellectual capacity, and moral integrity, white men were set apart from all the other races of the world. That includes your red man, your yellow man, and most certainly, your black man.” “Most certainly,” said [MASK], not bothering to hide her smile.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Tilda	He is coming to his feet as he speaks. He never gets there. The rifle barks and the blast hurls him against a tree. He does not move. [MASK] does not realize she is screaming until the white man slaps her. “Shut up, goddamn you!”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Sam	Just, for once... listen. But he couldn’t do that. Not him. [MASK] broke away from her eyes, forced himself back into the here and now, forced himself to finish the sentence. “She said I was going to get us both killed.”
<name>Roland</name>	Roland	Sam	“I am not hungry,” said [MASK]. Which was a lie. He simply couldn’t bring himself to eat the last food he had in some airy faith that something would magically present itself when they got hungry again. “Let us go see what they have down there.”
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Alex	Some gay color that lifted spirits instead of squashing them down. She opened the side door and stepped in. At the top of the stairs, a shadow detached itself from the other shadows and came down toward her. “Good morning, [MASK],” she said.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Paul	Nothing she or [MASK] might say would persuade these men. She smoothed down the wrinkles in her skirt just to give her hands something to do. “Well,” she said, “I suppose it is settled then. I’ve papers to grade at home.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Prudence	“Yes, I am certain of it,” she said. “He has been dreadfully injured, though.” “Yes, he has.” She pointed. “You see that?” [MASK] came closer and saw what she hadn’t before.
<name>John</name>	John	Ben	It was a little less wet in here. The rain whispered to the spring leaves far above. They walked in silence for an hour. Finally, [MASK] spoke. “Lost a lot of time back there,” he said.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Prudence	[MASK] gave him another sweet smile. “It is small,” she admitted, “but I believe it is positioned where it can do the most good.” “You wouldn’t,” he said. “You don’t have the nerve.”
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Tilda	Betray [MASK]. Go searching for his wife, for the woman he had loved from the instant he saw her, the woman whose image had gone before him in battlefields and a hospital ward and a thousand miles of walking?
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Prudence	“Any one of them. Any one of them in this entire godforsaken town.” A tiny breeze blew and the doors moved, creaking slightly. Only then did [MASK] realize they weren’t locked. She looked closer. The latch was splintered.
<name>Emilia</name>	Emilia	Prudence	[MASK] saw her own uncertainly reflected back at her. It was a novel feeling, uncertainty. The hours bled into one another. Mathematics, recess, reading. Arms waving like a field of cornstalks when children knew the answers and wanted to be called upon.
<name>Sonny</name>	Sonny	Ben	“What ‘right’ got to do with any of this?” demanded [MASK]. His voice was a lacerating whisper. “When the last time you seen ‘right?’” The two men stared at one another for a long, airless moment.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Vern	“I told him you would,” he said. “I bet [MASK] half a dollar you would. It’s too bad. Like I told you, you got sand for a Yankee. I can’t say much for your common sense, though.”
<name>Lincoln</name>	Lincoln	Sam	They waited. A group of soldiers turned onto 10th Street carrying a pine box. And now an anguished moan went up from the crowd. [MASK] clasped his hand to his mouth. His tears flowed freely. His voice was strangled, guttural, without words.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Bonnie	All at once she gasped, then lowered her head, and he knew she was weeping. Her body shook with the force of it. “Who was [MASK]?” he asked softly. It took a moment.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Russell	“You’re lying!” “I’ve spoken to his parents myself! They say it was a steamboat!” “Yankee lies! Goddamned Yankee lies! We know what happened to that boy!” “It is the truth!” cried [MASK].
<name>Zeke</name>	Zeke	Hannah	Time move on!” “[MASK]? What you mean?” But that was when the door opened and a man appeared on the steps. He was tall, thick in the chest, had skin the color of crow’s feathers and wore overalls with no shirt.
<name>Buford</name>	Buford	Done	He had dark skin, blunt, heavy features, and his gleaming scalp was ringed by a horseshoe of white fuzz. “You want us to tuck tail and run? [MASK] had enough of that. Been tuckin’ tail to white mens my whole life.”
<name>Gran</name>	Gran	Ben	“This makes no sense. You were always the one haranguing me to move on. Now you want to stop and spend a day putting this old woman’s house in order?” “Told you,” said [MASK], “you ain’t got to help.
<name>Malloy</name>	Malloy	McFarland	He met [MASK]’s burning gaze with open eyes and a strange calm and waited for the gunshot. It came. It was not what he expected, not an echoing blast that followed him down into oblivion. No, it was a flat pop, not unlike the breaking of a child’s balloon.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Wheaton	Today he wore jeans and a frayed old shirt, as if he had been in such a hurry he hadn’t had time to dress properly. When [MASK] rolled up, the mayor grabbed his chair by the arms, stopping it short, and began babbling, the words pouring out of him like water.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Sam	That’s what will happen. You’ll get us both killed.” She grabbed his hand in both of hers and her eyes were wild with pleading. “You don’t know him, [MASK], but I do. We’ve got to get away.”
<name>Huck</name>	Huck	George	His head broke the water and he found himself in the middle of a maelstrom, the steamboat towering high above him, somebody still cursing up a blue streak, the air still filled with the noise of collision. [MASK] spluttered and hacked, desperately treading water.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Georgie	It guided her to her desk at the front of the classroom where she sat down to begin grading papers. Soon enough the students would arrive and the long day would begin. “Is it true? Did one of your niggers kill [MASK]?”
<name>Preacher</name>	Preacher	Lee	I thought we was guardin’ this here place so our babies and even some’a us could get a education and come up a little in the world, now slave times is over. I ain’t knowed it was only about makin’ a point. Preacher.” [MASK]’s tone was mild.
<name>Alaric</name>	Alaric	Sam	[MASK] slipped it back into the bag. He slept that night without dreams. When the morning light woke him, he saddled his horse and rode down to the riverbank. He traveled along it for half an hour before finding what he sought: a ferryman.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Prudence	“My friend passed away,” she said, “but I know she would join me in wanting you to have her things.” “Are you certain?” “Yes,” said [MASK]. “In fact, you would honor us if you took them.”
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Prudence	“Ma’am,” he said and then lowered the hat and sauntered toward one of the outbuildings. “If you please come with me,” said the colored woman. She led [MASK] through the front door and into a hall that rose two stories above her.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Prudence	“You refer to the new ordinance.” “Yes, ma’am. They passed it last night, way I hear.” “It is a ridiculous law,” said [MASK]. “The provost will never suffer it to stand.”
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Prudence	Then a sour smile bowed his lips. “Or I guess I should say it’s you-all’s church,” he corrected. “You’re pretty much a nigger yourself now, ain’t you?” [MASK] pulled her hand from his in disgust.
<name>She</name>	She	Prudence	I do not even know who I am.” The sound of her voice was pitiful in her own ears. [MASK] had become the one thing she always scorned: weak. But she couldn’t help herself. She no longer knew how to be anything else.
<name>Jonas</name>	Jonas	Colindy	“On that we can agree,” she said. “When I leave here, it is my hope never to see you or your town again.” She saw a shadow of laughter flicker in [MASK]’s eyes, gone before it was truly there.
<name>Big Henry</name>	Big Henry	Done	They were narrowed and hard, watching out of the fortress his face had become as he loomed over the boys like a mountain, “[MASK] asked you,” he said, in a stiff tone that somehow managed to offer both respect and threat, “what y’all doin’ ’round back here?”
<name>Rose</name>	Rose	Elizabeth	In fact, the baby about a year old. A little girl. Pretty little thing with real light skin, just beginnin’ to toddle. And he fell in love with her, your daddy did. Told [MASK]
<name>Artemis</name>	Artemis	Prudence	“Yes, he has that quality.” “Perhaps you would be so kind as to tell me why you wanted to see me,” said [MASK]. He cut her a glance. “We are to be direct with one another, then? Good.
<name>Jackson</name>	Jackson	Paul	[MASK], oblivious to the entire exchange, rolled his neck and made a show of stretching the knots out of his back. It was a warm afternoon, the breeze carrying just the barest warning of the chill to come when the sun left the sky.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Bob	But he were serious. We seen that after a time. So we voted for a of fellow name of [MASK]—had a bad eye, but he was the best worker you ever seen. And he was fair. That’s all we ever asked.
<name>Liberté</name>	Liberté	Honey	“But [MASK] is the only thing / still own. Would you deprive me of my property because you have been deprived of yours? Where is the honor in that, Captain?” She can see the words taking effect. His back stiffens. The gun comes down.
<name>Devon</name>	Devon	Sam	Hating him all the more for being right. [MASK] spoke from behind her. “So,” he said. “So,” she said. She did not turn. “It appears we both will soon be leaving.” “Yes,” she said.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	McFarland	And now there was a tiny red hole in [MASK]’s face, just below his left eye. His hand came up to inspect the wound. He looked about him in dazed confusion. Then his eyes went blank, rolling back til only the whites were visible.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Tilda	“No you won’t,” she said softly. “You were mad to think you would. You’ll never see me again.” “Do not say that!” He was crying and didn’t care. “[MASK],” he said.
<name>Prim</name>	Prim	Tilda	“Where are they?” he asks. [MASK], sitting at the fire eating the last of her corncake, shrugs. “I don’t know. I haven’t seen them this morning.” He grabs her arm, yanks her to her feet.
<name>Tituba</name>	Tituba	Nick	“She read it to me one day when I was feeling flirtatious,” he said. The white man cried out again. “[MASK], didn’t you hear me, goddamn your black hide?” “I said I be right there!”
<name>Frederick</name>	Frederick	Sam	Would the Negro be enslaved again? And if so, was [MASK] unknowingly walking headlong back into the old life he had found so intolerable, the life where your goings and comings, your very personhood and dreams, were circumscribed by another? He should turn back.
<name>Arctor</name>	Arctor	Sam	“[MASK], what have you done to yourself?” He tried to answer, but dust was lodged in his throat. He coughed, made himself swallow. “I have not done anything to myself,” he said, finally. He spoke in a grainy whisper.
<name>Mrs. Appleyard</name>	Mrs. Appleyard	Bonnie	“I do,” said [MASK]. “There is a small group of them out there already. That horrible man Socrates was not going to send the telegram, either, but the oddest thing—” She stopped, as if suddenly aware of the children, staring up at them.
<name>James</name>	James	Bo	“You turned him down,” [MASK] was saying as the wagon flew at too great a speed down the long lane. “I did,” she said. He turned to show her a smirk. “I told him you would,” he said.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Ivey	Hearing herself speak made her pain- fully conscious of how tart and plain her voice must sound in this place where mouths lingered languidly over words, as if to hold on to them that much longer. “'That mean she a Yankee,” said [MASK].
<name>Joram</name>	Joram	Wheaton	And then they were gone. [MASK] kept the horses at a brisk pace, just short of a trot. For long minutes, there was no sound except those the wagon made, the striking of hooves against the dirt, the jingling of bridles, the turning of wheels.
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Prudence	she asked. It was the hardest thing [MASK] had ever said. “They took her last night.” The old woman’s eyes filled. “She dead then.” Her voice wobbled like a child learning to walk.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Prudence	He agreed with a curt nod and they moved up the street to the little house with the garden blooming in a riot of color out front. [MASK] knocked on the door. A taut voice answered her from the other side. “Get away from here, you devil.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Ben	“Carry yourself as a man and they shall have no choice but to treat you as one.” “You must done met some different white folks from the ones I been dealin’ with all my life,” said [MASK]. He chased it with a laugh.
<name>Jon</name>	Jon	Sam	Suddenly, [MASK] was eager to get going. He forked up the last of the venison. The meat had a dark, full taste, and it occurred to him that he had not eaten so fine a meal in a very long time. He held up his plate.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Sam	[MASK] reached down to touch his friend’s shoulder. “He is just happy,” he said. “He has been trying to find his way here for a very long time.” The girl’s mouth drew up in skepticism.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Bonnie	White people gaped at her. None tried to impede her progress. But they paused in their commerce and gossip and stared after her, muttering in disbelief. [MASK] caught snatches of it. “Ain’t that the Yankee schoolteacher?” “What she doin’ here?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ben	As they were preparing to leave, she asked [MASK] if he might consider staying on. “You could help me get the place in order,” she said. “I couldn’t pay you much, but...” She left the words hanging there.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Bonnie	All her life, [MASK] had felt that way, felt as if she were getting away with something. In the last week, that feeling had vanished like ice under the summer sun. In the last week, she had gotten away with nothing.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Ginny	“[MASK] told you about that? Yes. We found him down the block lying in the alley. He had been set upon.” A pause. “That dress is very pretty on you,” she said.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Bonnie	She feared being so truly alone in the alien place she was going to. Why was [MASK] so stubborn? Why had she made such a scene over a trifling matter that could be swiftly resolved? Where is she? This last thought echoed in her.
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Sam	He slung an Enfield rifle over his shoulder, its strap crisscrossing the strap of a bag filled with powder and shot. A soldier returning to war. “Where are you going?” asked [MASK]. He knew it was a stupid question the instant it left his mouth.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Prudence	I implore you not to dismiss it out of hand.” [MASK] was silent. She said, “You...” And then she stopped, impatiently flicking at the tears that had begun dripping from her eyes. A deep breath. She looked at him.
<name>James</name>	James	Prudence	But [MASK] had already done so much. He already owed her more than he could ever repay. Could he really go now and ask her to help him and the woman for whom he had abandoned her? He played that conversation over in his head a half dozen times.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Sam	She touched his cheek with the back of her hand. We felt this, her touch cool and dry against the side of his face. “Oh, [MASK],” she repeated. “Is that what you’re doing? You poor man.
<name>Lincoln</name>	Lincoln	Ben	[MASK] had escaped these people seven years before. Now he was appearing at their door at the end of a ruinous war. Who knew how they would respond? They might press a rifle in his belly. They might spit in his face. They might do anything.
<name>Abigail</name>	Abigail	Prudence	Had some contingent from the town come to attack them in broad daylight? What about the children? Moving toward the door, [MASK] smoothed down her skirt, fingers passing inadvertently over the lump the derringer made in her pocket. For once, it was not reassuring.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Prudence	[MASK] wept without knowing. “I have lost myself,” she said. “It is as if everything I love, everything I depend upon, I lose. I feel as if I am falling and helpless to make it stop.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sam	They had already lost five hours waiting in the hallway outside the mayor’s office in order to go inside and accomplish nothing. There was no thought of lying under a wagon to wait out the storm. No thought of anything but walking. [MASK] found himself grateful for the rain.
<name>Jericho</name>	Jericho	Sam	And then she ran away. Watching the door slam behind her, [MASK] felt exhausted. Stay with this white woman who had nursed him back from the dead, who had given him a home and healing and hope?
<name>Alonso</name>	Alonso	Sam	They took my sister. And what is worse, I have no one to blame but myself.” It was a moment before [MASK] spoke. “So,” he finally said, “we are passengers in the same boat. What can we do now?
<name>Missy</name>	Missy	Prudence	“Ain’t never been in no school,” he said. “You could be in this one if you wished,” said [MASK]. “We would be happy to teach you.” She knew her mistake before the echo of her words had faded.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Bonnie	They do terrible things when they scared.” “I know,” said [MASK]. “No, you don’t,” he told her. “You think you do, but you don’t.” She didn’t answer. She couldn’t.
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Prudence	From a cabinet in the loft, [MASK] retrieved medical supplies left over from the days when the old warehouse had served as a military hospital. They cut his clothes away, gently dabbed the blood and grime from his skin, and dressed his wounds.
<name>Pritchard</name>	Pritchard	Jones	“I am A.L. [MASK],” he said, “just as it says on the window. And who might you be, sir?” But he already knew, instinctively, who this white man was, and his eyes grazed the pistol he kept under the counter.
<name>Calpurnia</name>	Calpurnia	Jesse	She turned and [MASK] was gazing down on her with buttery eyes. “Yes?” she said. “Ain’t want you to think we didn’t appreciate you worryin’ about us. We surely do.” This brought nods and noises of assent from around the room.
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Tilda	We found them, he killed them, and we have been walking ever since.” “Killed them?” Her hands hang clasped before her. [MASK] nods. “Shot them down,” she says. “But there are no more runaways.
<name>Henrietta</name>	Henrietta	Bonnie	“Yes, ma’am,” he said solemnly, replacing the hat. [MASK] shook her head, smiling despite herself, wondering again how it was she could have been incomplete and never even known. “How them children cornin’ along?” he asked when they were halfway down the block.
<name>Tywin</name>	Tywin	Bonnie	A great many lives might have been saved.” She thought she might gag on the sanctimony of it, and a half-dozen sharp retorts leapt to her tongue. But she knew what [MASK] would have told her: keep her mouth shut for once and bide her time.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Ben	“Yes, ma’am,” said [MASK], and no smile marked his face now. “I reckon you right. I stole. I stole myself.” She sighed elaborately. “Well, I suppose it’s too long past to hold a grudge now.
<name>Let</name>	Let	Devil	A welcome breeze stirred a stray wisp of bright hair across her face. Absently, she brought a hand up to smooth it back into place. Her eyes were somewhere else. “[MASK] take them all,” she whispered in that same scorched voice.
<name>Tris</name>	Tris	Prudence	Even as he went down on his face, [MASK] pivoted and decked the second boy with a roundhouse punch that would have done a dockworker proud. The boy she had tackled was coming to his feet, wailing through a bloody mouth.
<name>Henriette</name>	Henriette	Hope	The Bible says the truth shall make us free. Here, then, is the truth: our father had a fourth daughter, a little mulatto girl he never claimed. She died in a convent orphanage when she was 12. Our sister’s name was [MASK].
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Prudence	She had the world to herself and the only sound in it was her footfalls tapping wood. [MASK] loved early morning. The day stood still and gave you time to gather yourself without regard for the fears and worries of other people.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Prudence	“Yes, he did,” said [MASK]. “And what you tell him?” The smile, broad and expectant. “I told him no.” She flinched at the cheer that went up then, sudden, lusty, and full.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Bonnie	It happened shortly after dawn as they were walking to school. The smell was the first thing they noticed, a reek of blood and putrefaction that made their hands fly to their mouths. [MASK] said, “What is that?”
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Prudence	She had a mission and she would not fail. [MASK] paused as she always did when the big building at the end of the block rose above her, the unpainted wood just becoming visible in the light of a sun that still lay half-hidden in the cotton fields to the east.
<name>Samuel</name>	Samuel	Sam	“War or peace, you will come through the door right on schedule with your head buried in a newspaper.” “Good morning,” said [MASK]. The sight of a colored man reading was a never-ending source of wonder and consternation to his coworker.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Sam	He would have put a consoling hand on the boy’s shoulder, but the boy was sitting to his left. Instead, [MASK] watched the horse chew grass for a moment. Then he said, “So what are you going to do?” The boy looked down.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Sam	[MASK] nodded, stoic. Then the fatigue overtook him and he sighed. “Is there ever news?” he said. “I don’t understand.” “Of all the people who place notices in your paper, are any of them ever successful?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Ben	There was a woman I knew who is still down there.” “You going to find her?” “Yes.” “Same thing I’m doing,” said [MASK]. “Goin’ back to my wife.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Sam	[MASK] took a step, two, as if the carriage were a ship and he was pulled irresistibly in its wake. Then he stopped. He stood watching the tragic procession until it was gone. “What you suppose they do now?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sam	They ambled east in the silence. Another hour passed. [MASK] lost himself in wondering where they would stop for the night. If they were fortunate, they would find an abandoned barn, or perhaps even a colored family that didn’t mind taking in strangers.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Sam	Then the eyes lost their focus and [MASK] was looking down on a dead thing that one breath ago had been his son. It would not register. His mind would not take it in. He kept working it like it was a math problem and he couldn’t get the sums to line up properly.
<name>Josephine</name>	Josephine	Prudence	[MASK] sat at the window of the rail car, her eyes closed and her face pinched against the warm soot that flowed across her, soft as baby’s hands. She was hoping against hope to snatch a breath of cool air from the river of foul smoke.
<name>Jefferson</name>	Jefferson	Sam	“What do you mean?” “I mean, long as you’s a Negro you best get over this idea white folks gon’ ever treat you like a man.” “They will give you the treatment you require of them,” said [MASK].
<name>Annie</name>	Annie	Prudence	A splash of whitewash still spread itself across the front wall. Perhaps, [MASK] thought, she would have the whole building painted once school was out and the children were picking cotton. Some gay color that lifted spirits instead of squashing them down.
<name>Corrine</name>	Corrine	Prudence	Then her mouth opened in a toothless grin. “I reckon they is at that,” she said. “And you right. Gon’ be a sight to see when white folks figures out what you up to.” [MASK] paced anxiously.
<name>Stubb</name>	Stubb	Horn	He had just struck a one-armed man. Few things could be more despicable. He stepped forward, palms up, intend- ing to apologize. But now [MASK]’s one arm was coming toward him, the hand bloody and grasping.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Prudence	It’s too bad. Like I told you, you got sand for a Yankee. I can’t say much for your common sense, though.” “Fortunately, your opinion does not matter to me.” [MASK] spoke with an assurance she did not feel.
