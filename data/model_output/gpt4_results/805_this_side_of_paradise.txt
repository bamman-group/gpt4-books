<name>Wells</name>	Wells	Burne	“And you say almost a third of the junior class are going to resign?” “Call it a fourth and be safe.” “Lord--who'd have thought it possible!” There was a brisk knock at the door, and [MASK] himself came in.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Burne	He found something that he wanted, had always wanted and always would want--not to be admired, as he had feared; not to be loved, as he had made himself believe; but to be necessary to people, to be indispensable; he remembered the sense of security he had found in [MASK].
<name>Alec</name>	Alec	Kerry	“No, I'm not,” he lied. “I'm thinking about the Princetonian. I ought to make up to-night; but I can telephone back, I suppose.” “Oh,” said [MASK] respectfully, “these important men--”
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Amory	Her words began ringing in his ears: “Don't ever forget me, [MASK]--don't ever forget me--” “Hell!” he faltered aloud, and then he choked and collapsed on the bed in a shaken spasm of grief.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Amory	Not the name of the hotel, but just a line sayin' that you had a little trouble in 'lantic City. See?” “I see.” “You're gettin' off light--damn light--but--” “Come on,” said [MASK] briskly.
<name>Undine</name>	Undine	ISABELLE	***** [MASK] She paused at the top of the staircase. The sensations attributed to divers on spring-boards, leading ladies on opening nights, and lumpy, husky young men on the day of the Big Game, crowded through her.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Amory	He reached in his pocket suggestively, but [MASK] snorted, and, taking the girl's arm, turned away. “Where did you tell the driver to go?” she asked as they whirled along the dim street. “The station.”
<name>Barbara</name>	Barbara	Amory	[MASK], I belong to you. For the first time I regret all the other kisses; now I know how much a kiss can mean.” Then they would smoke and he would tell her about his day at the office--and where they might live.
<name>He</name>	He	Amory	“What's your difficulty? Lost your job?” “Not exactly, but--well, call it that.” “What was it?” “Writing copy for an advertising agency.” “Lots of money in advertising.” [MASK] smiled discreetly.
<name>Amory</name>	Amory	Amory	The lower classes are narrower, less pleasant and personally more selfish--certainly more stupid. But all that has nothing to do with the question.” “Just exactly what is the question?” Here [MASK] had to pause to consider exactly what the question was.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Amory	they were nervous hands that sat lightly along the cushions and moved constantly with little jerky openings and closings. Then, suddenly, [MASK] perceived the feet, and with a rush of blood to the head he realized he was afraid.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Isabelle	But [MASK] strung the names into a fabrication of gayety that would have dazzled a Viennese nobleman. Such is the power of young contralto voices on sink-down sofas. He asked her if she thought he was conceited. She said there was a difference between conceit and self-confidence.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alec	If I enjoy going around telling people guilelessly that I think I'm a genius, let me do it.” “You're getting a reputation for being eccentric,” said [MASK], laughing, “if that's what you mean.”
<name>He</name>	He	Amory	“Well--” began the man dubiously. “I'll go if you want me to.” The man made non-committal noises in his throat and passed on. [MASK] seated himself on an overturned boat and leaned forward thoughtfully until his chin rested in his hand.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Amory	I don't think you've ever met her, but I wish, as a favor to me, you'd go to see her. To my mind, she's rather a remarkable woman, and just about your age.” [MASK] sighed and decided to go, as a favor....
<name>Amory</name>	Amory	Burne	“Better drift, like me. I'm going to sail into prominence on [MASK]'s coat-tails.” “I can't drift--I want to be interested. I want to pull strings, even for somebody else, or be Princetonian chairman or Triangle president.
<name>Amory</name>	Amory	Tanaduke	[MASK] was a sophomore, with tremendous ears and a way of saying, “The earth swirls down through the ominous moons of preconsidered generations!” that made them vaguely wonder why it did not sound quite clear, but never question that it was the utterance of a supersoul.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Amory	***** [MASK] smiled a bit. “You're too much wrapped up in yourself,” he heard some one say. And again-- “Get out and do some real work--” “Stop worrying--” He fancied a possible future comment of his own.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Amory	“My nerves are on edge--on edge. We must leave this terrifying place to-morrow and go searching for sunshine.” [MASK]'s penetrating green eyes would look out through tangled hair at his mother. Even at this age he had no illusions about her.
<name>Wagner</name>	Wagner	Kant	A radical comes down and shocks The atheistic orthodox? You're representing Common Sense, Mouth open, in the audience. And, sometimes, even chapel lures That conscious tolerance of yours, That broad and beaming view of truth (Including [MASK] and General Booth...)
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Amory	He could dissipate without going to pieces, and even his most bohemian adventures never seemed “running it out.” People dressed like him, tried to talk as he did.... [MASK] decided that he probably held the world back, but he wouldn't have changed him.
<name>Gregor</name>	Gregor	Amory	“No,” said [MASK]. “I'm quitting.” “Well--well--this is--” “I don't like it here.” “I'm sorry. I thought our relations had been quite--ah--pleasant.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	AMORY	Drifting hurts too much. We can't have any more scenes like this. (She draws his ring from her finger and hands it to him. Their eyes blind again with tears.) [MASK]: (His lips against her wet cheek) Don't!
<name>Amory</name>	Amory	Amory	CHAPTER 2. Spires and Gargoyles At first [MASK] noticed only the wealth of sunshine creeping across the long, green swards, dancing on the leaded window-panes, and swimming around the tops of spires and towers and battlemented walls.
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Eleanor	There was something most passionate in [MASK]'s reading aloud. They seemed nearer, not only mentally, but physically, when they read, than when she was in his arms, and this was often, for they fell half into love almost from the first.
<name>Millicent</name>	Millicent	Isabelle	We're all coached for each other.” [MASK] gasped--this was rather right in line. But really she felt as if a good speech had been taken from the star and given to a minor character.... She mustn't lose the leadership a bit.
<name>Reggie</name>	Reggie	Burne	“She'll see,” he informed a delegation who arrived in his room to josh him. “This will be the last game she ever persuades any young innocent to take her to!” “But, [MASK]--why did you _invite_ her if you didn't want her?”
<name>Comus</name>	Comus	Amory	“Isn't that the conventional frame of mind for the young man of your age and condition?” “Yes,” said [MASK] speculatively, “but I'm more than bored; I am restless.” “Love and war did for you.”
<name>God</name>	God	Lord	It's too small. HE: No it isn't--let's see. (He kisses her again with the same thoroughness.) SHE: (Rather moved) Say something sweet. HE: (Frightened) [MASK] help me. SHE: (Drawing away)
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Amory	“I'd like to quit.” “What does your girl say?” “Oh!” [MASK] gasped in horror. “She wouldn't _think_ of marrying... that is, not now. I mean the future, you know.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Amory	“Maybe.” “Well, what are you going to do? Get a better one quick, or just bum around for two more years as a has-been?” “I don't know yet...” “Oh, [MASK], buck up!”
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Holiday	“Oh, did you? I had a cousin there.” They discussed the cousin thoroughly, and then [MASK] announced that he was to meet his brother for dinner at six. “Come along and have a bite with us.” “All right.”
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Amory	“[MASK], between you and me, I have only just learned to do it myself. I can do the one hundred things beyond the next thing, but I stub my toe on that, just as you stubbed your toe on mathematics this fall.”
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Amory	I've heard the most fascinating stories. You must go into finance, [MASK]. I'm sure you would revel in it. You start as a messenger or a teller, I believe, and from that you go up--almost indefinitely.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Froggy	“How--from whom?” “From everybody--for all the years since you've been away.” She blushed appropriately. On her right [MASK] was _hors de combat_ already, although he hadn't quite realized it.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Monsignor	He and [MASK] held the floor, and the older man, with his less receptive, less accepting, yet certainly not colder mentality, seemed content to listen and bask in the mellow sunshine that played between these two.
<name>Amory</name>	Amory	Amory	[MASK] had felt a curious sinking sensation. This present type of party was made possible by the surging together of the class after club elections--as if to make a last desperate attempt to know itself, to keep together, to fight off the tightening spirit of the clubs.
<name>Ulysses</name>	Ulysses	Ulalume'--how	“Tell me,” he demanded, leaning forward eagerly, “how do you know about '[MASK] did you know the color of my hair? What's your name? What were you doing here? Tell me all at once!”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Amory	So now I know I'm a materialist and I was fraternizing with the hay when you came out and stood by the woods, scared to death.” “Why, you little wretch--” cried [MASK] indignantly. “Scared of what?” “_Yourself!
<name>Amory</name>	Amory	Eleanor	“Light a match,” she whispered. “I want to see you.” Scratch! Flare! The night and the scarred trees were like scenery in a play, and to be there with [MASK], shadowy and unreal, seemed somehow oddly familiar.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Amory	“There's a natural damn fool,” commented [MASK]. “Oh, he's all right. Here's the old jitney waiter. If you ask me, I want a double Daiquiri.” “Make it four.” The crowd whirled and changed and shifted.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Tom	--oh, we'll get a Jap butler and dress for dinner and have wine on the table and lead a contemplative, emotionless life until we decide to use machine-guns with the property owners--or throw bombs with the Bolshevik God! [MASK], I hope something happens.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Amory	[MASK] drew his horse up close beside, and, leaning toward her, grasped her hand. “Say I am--_quick_, or I'll pull you over and make you ride behind me.” She looked up and smiled and shook her head excitedly.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	ROSALIND	What power we have of hurting each other! [MASK]: (Commencing to sob again) It's been so perfect--you and I. So like a dream that I'd longed for and never thought I'd find. The first real unselfishness I've ever felt in my life.
<name>anarchists</name>	anarchists	Socialists	“These bomb throwers--” The little man ceased as words lurched ponderously from the big man's chest. “If I thought you were a bomb thrower I'd run you over to the Newark jail. That's what I think of [MASK].”
<name>Robin</name>	Robin	Amory	When [MASK] was five he was already a delightful companion for her. He was an auburn-haired boy, with great, handsome eyes which he would grow up to in time, a facile imaginative mind and a taste for fancy dress.
<name>Utopian</name>	Utopian	Joan	In her eyes was the light of the idealist, the inviolate dreamer of [MASK]-like dreams. “No,” she answered. “I don't do that sort of thing any more; he asked me to, but I said no.”
<name>Blanche</name>	Blanche	Rosalind	[MASK], we're on each other's nerves. It's just that we're both high-strung, and this week-- (His voice is curiously old. She crosses to him and taking his face in her hands, kisses him.)
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Amory	“He used to be. He probably won't want to be any more--and never understand why.” “It was sorta crazy you takin' all that blame. Is he pretty important? Kinda more important than you are?” [MASK] laughed.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Amory	The big man shook his head. “In this country there are enough property owners not to permit that sort of thing.” [MASK] wished he knew the statistics of property owners and non-property owners; he decided to change the subject. But the big man was aroused.
<name>Edison</name>	Edison	Wilson	They always believe that 'things are in a bad way now,' but they 'haven't any faith in these idealists.' One minute they call [MASK] 'just a dreamer, not practical'--a year later they rail at him for making his dreams realities.
<name>Clive</name>	Clive	Amory	Now a confession will have to be made. [MASK] had rather a Puritan conscience. Not that he yielded to it--later in life he almost completely slew it--but at fifteen it made him consider himself a great deal worse than other boys... unscrupulousness...
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	ROSALIND	All others are hers by natural prerogative. If [MASK] could be spoiled the process would have been complete by this time, and as a matter of fact, her disposition is not all it should be; she wants what she wants when she wants it
<name>Nina</name>	Nina	ROSALIND	(Her brother strolls in, starts and then in a loud voice says: “Oh, excuse me,” and goes.) [MASK]: (Her lips scarcely stirring) Don't let me go--I don't care who knows what I do.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Isabelle	Somehow, with the defection of [MASK] the idea of undergraduate success had loosed its grasp on his imagination, and he contemplated a possible failure to pass off his condition with equanimity, even though it would arbitrarily mean his removal from the Princetonian board and the slaughter of his chances for the Senior Council.
<name>Jordan</name>	Jordan	Rosalind	Nobody else in the party tried it. Well, afterward [MASK] had the nerve to ask me why I stooped over when I dove. 'It didn't make it any easier,' she said, 'it just took all the courage out of it.'
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	ROSALIND	[MASK]: No--no--I'm taking the hardest course, the strongest course. Marrying you would be a failure and I never fail--if you don't stop walking up and down I'll scream! (Again he sinks despairingly onto the lounge.)
<name>Reggie</name>	Reggie	Amory	Here they had sat and dreamed: that tray she had so often filled with matches for him; that shade that they had discreetly lowered one long Sunday afternoon. Misty-eyed she stands and remembers; she speaks aloud.) Oh, [MASK], what have I done to you?
<name>Amory</name>	Amory	Tom	“Heard the latest?” said [MASK], coming in late one drizzly evening with that triumphant air he always wore after a successful conversational bout. “No. Somebody flunked out? Or another ship sunk?” “Worse than that.
<name>Humpty</name>	Humpty	Amory	“Every child,” said [MASK], “should have an equal start. If his father can endow him with a good physique and his mother with some common sense in his early education, that should be his heritage.
<name>Brett</name>	Brett	Burne	“How about great criminals?” “They're usually insane. If not, they're weak. There is no such thing as a strong, sane criminal.” “[MASK], I disagree with you altogether; how about the superman?” “Well?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Amory	His family had been after him to go home and live, so he--” A spasm of pain shook [MASK]. “Too bad.” “Yes, it is too bad. We'll have to get some one else if we're going to stay here.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	Within a week after the receipt of this letter their little household fell precipitously to pieces. The immediate cause was the serious and probably chronic illness of [MASK]'s mother. So they stored the furniture, gave instructions to sublet and shook hands gloomily in the Pennsylvania Station.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Amory	The war seemed scarcely to touch them and it might have been one of the senior springs of the past, except for the drilling every other afternoon, yet [MASK] realized poignantly that this was the last spring under the old regime.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Amory	He turned and glanced casually... a middle-aged man dressed in a brown sack suit, it was, sitting a little apart at a table by himself and watching their party intently. At [MASK]'s glance he smiled faintly.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Amory	“Well, let's waive it--we won't get anywhere, and besides I haven't quite made up my mind about it myself. Now, here's something I _do_ know--personal appearance has a lot to do with it.” “Coloring?” [MASK] asked eagerly.
<name>Rosalind</name>	Rosalind	Isabelle	“[MASK],” he began rather testily, as they arranged themselves in the car, bound for a dance at the Greenwich Country Club, “you're angry, and I'll be, too, in a minute. Let's kiss and make up.”
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Tom	I can always outguess a ghost.” “How?” asked [MASK]. “Well, it depends where. Take a bedroom, for example. If you use _any_ discretion a ghost can never get you in a bedroom.”
<name>Swanson</name>	Swanson	Harebell	“It didn't matter a damn to me whether [MASK]'s flour was any better than any one else's. In fact, I never ate any of it. So I got tired of telling people about it--
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	ROSALIND	And you love me. [MASK]: That's just why it has to end. Drifting hurts too much. We can't have any more scenes like this. (She draws his ring from her finger and hands it to him. Their eyes blind again with tears.)
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Isabelle	“I _do_, because you're always talking about yourself and I used to like it; now I don't.” “Have I to-night?” “That's just the point,” insisted [MASK]. “You got all upset to-night.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Amory	“Oh, just sweet, just sweet...” he held her closer. “[MASK],” she whispered, “when you're ready for me I'll marry you.” “We won't have much at first.” “Don't!”
<name>Swinburne</name>	Swinburne	Swinburne	One poem they read over and over; [MASK]'s “Triumph of Time,” and four lines of it rang in his memory afterward on warm nights when he saw the fireflies among dusky tree trunks and heard the low drone of many frogs.
<name>Pauline</name>	Pauline	Pia	“Listen to this! My God! “'A serving lady speaks: Black velvet trails its folds over the day, White tapers, prisoned in their silver frames, Wave their thin flames like shadows in the wind, [MASK], Pompia, come--come away--'
<name>Myrtle</name>	Myrtle	Myra	“I don't want to,” he heard himself saying. There was another pause. “I don't want to!” he repeated passionately. [MASK] sprang up, her cheeks pink with bruised vanity, the great bow on the back of her head trembling sympathetically.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sally	Evidently a bit light of love, neither popular nor unpopular--every girl there seemed to have had an affair with him at some time or other, but no one volunteered any really useful information. He was going to fall for her.... [MASK] had published that information to her young set
<name>Geoffrey</name>	Geoffrey	Kerry	[MASK] was tall, with humorous gray eyes, and a sudden, attractive smile; he became at once the mentor of the house, reaper of ears that grew too high, censor of conceit, vendor of rare, satirical humor.
<name>Myra</name>	Myra	Myra	***** On Thursday, therefore, he walked pensively along the slippery, shovel-scraped sidewalks, and came in sight of [MASK]'s house, on the half-hour after five, a lateness which he fancied his mother would have favored.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Amory	He a-hemmed again with delicate reticence, and continued: “They seem to think that you're--ah--rather too fresh--” [MASK] could stand no more. He rose from his chair, scarcely controlling his voice when he spoke. “I know--
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Tom	Then, if nothing happens, you can look in. _Always, always_ run the stick in viciously first--_never_ look first!” “Of course, that's the ancient Celtic school,” said [MASK] gravely. “Yes--but they usually pray first.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Amory	“[MASK].” “What?” “You're not in love with me. You never wanted to marry me, did you?” “It was the twilight,” he said wonderingly. “I didn't feel as though I were speaking aloud.
<name>Asenath</name>	Asenath	Amory	When again the pale sheen skimmed the cornices, it was almost beside him, and [MASK] thought he heard a quiet breathing. Suddenly he realized that the footsteps were not behind, had never been behind, they were ahead and he was not eluding but following... following.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Amory	[MASK] said; “what a devil you could have been if the Lord had just bent your soul a little the other way!” “Maybe,” she answered; “but I think not. I'm never really wild and never have been.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	ROSALIND	She danced exceptionally well, drew cleverly but hastily, and had a startling facility with words, which she used only in love-letters. But all criticism of [MASK] ends in her beauty. There was that shade of glorious yellow hair, the desire to imitate which supports the dye industry.
<name>Dexter</name>	Dexter	Isabelle	“I know,” said [MASK] softly. “Maybe we'll never meet again like this--I have darned hard luck sometimes.” He was leaning away from her on the other arm of the lounge, but she could see his eyes plainly in the dark.
<name>Pierre</name>	Pierre	Amory	[MASK], I'm very glad we're both alive; this war could easily have been the end of a brilliant family. But in regard to matrimony, you are now at the most dangerous period of your life. You might marry in haste and repent at leisure, but I think you won't.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	ROSALIND	She has changed perceptibly--she is a trifle thinner for one thing; the light in her eyes is not so bright; she looks easily a year older. Her mother comes in, muffled in an opera-cloak. She takes in [MASK] with a nervous glance.
<name>Dorothy</name>	Dorothy	Jill	“Can't you give a wrong name?” “No chance. I registered under my own name; besides, they'd trail the auto license number.” “Say you're married.” “[MASK] says one of the house detectives knows her.”
<name>Elsie</name>	Elsie	Clara	People tried afterward to repeat her anecdotes but for the life of them they could make them sound like nothing whatever. They gave her a sort of innocent attention and the best smiles many of them had smiled for long; there were few tears in [MASK], but people smiled misty-eyed at her.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Eleanor	When the story came to her uncle, a forgetful cavalier of a more hypocritical era, there was a scene, from which [MASK] emerged, subdued but rebellious and indignant, to seek haven with her grandfather who hovered in the country on the near side of senility.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Oxford	[MASK] might have been a bigger field. Silently he admired himself. How conveniently well he looked, and how well a dinner coat became him. He stepped into the hall and then waited at the top of the stairs, for he heard footsteps coming.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Amory	[MASK] agreed that it was. She would not have appreciated the Japanese invasion. “When do I go to school?” “Next month. You'll have to start East a little early to take your examinations.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Amory	The sense of going forward in a direct, determined line had come back; youth was stirring and shaking out a few new feathers. He had even stored enough surplus energy to sally into a new pose. “What's the idea of all this 'distracted' stuff, [MASK]?”
<name>Pat</name>	Pat	Isabelle	[MASK] considered glumly. “I hate to be laughed at,” she said finally. “I won't laugh any more. I'm not laughing now, am I?” “You did.” “Oh, don't be so darned feminine.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Amory	“And this very walking at night is one of the things I was afraid about. I'm going to tell you why I can walk anywhere now and not be afraid.” “Go on,” [MASK] urged eagerly.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Amory	He could not reconcile himself to her beauty, that was mother to his own, the exquisite neck and shoulders, the grace of a fortunate woman of thirty. “[MASK], dear,” she crooned softly, “I had such a strange, weird time after I left you.”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Arcady	As the swing reached its highest point, [MASK] really lay just over the brow of a certain hill, where the brown road dwindled out of sight in a golden dot. He read voluminously all spring, the beginning of his eighteenth year:
<name>Lois</name>	Lois	Amory	Let's not _talk_ about it.” When the hand-knit, sleeveless jerseys were stylish, [MASK], in a burst of inspiration, named them “petting shirts.” The name travelled from coast to coast on the lips of parlor-snakes and P. D.'s.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Amory	“Well, it's something that--that--there's a lot of them. You're not one, and neither am I, though I am more than you are.” “Who is one? What makes you one?” [MASK] considered.
<name>John</name>	John	Amory	[MASK] looked long at one house which bore the legend “Sixty-nine.” There a few gray-haired men sat and talked quietly while the classes swept by in panorama of life. ***** UNDER THE ARC-LIGHT
