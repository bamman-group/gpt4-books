<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Raven	“I’m not hiding anything from you, at least nothing which concerns you. Besides, you’re the man who paid sixty thousand dollars of an entire debt I owed to the Mafioso. You saved my life, [MASK], I couldn’t . . .
<name>Stephanie</name>	Stephanie	Raven	“What color belt do you wear?” “I’m a fourteen-year black belt,” [MASK] softly informed him, “but not nearly good enough to cause damage all the way from here to the Ricci estate.”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Dante	“Is there anything else you remember about him?” [MASK] pushed. “Can you tell me how tall or heavy he was, or what color?” “Color?” they chorused. “Yes. Was he white, black, what?”
<name>Belinda</name>	Belinda	Dallas	but I do truly love you, really I do, and it frightens me even worse.” “Then you can well understand why I reacted the way I did just then. [MASK], once you and me hook up, there’ll be no turning back.
<name>Rico</name>	Rico	Raven	“What you both do or don’t do, is solely up to your own discretion. But if you still want to remain tight with me after I return, you’d better not just have a wet ass with no money,” [MASK] stipulated. “Unique!
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Dante	“I said he was my friend, not my woman. I couldn’t have cared less about how he earned his living.” “Ah, correct me if I’m wrong, but is it true that you once saved his life?” [MASK] shot at him.
<name>Roland</name>	Roland	Raven	But then she grew angrier when she noticed that he wasn’t even breathing hard, although he was sweating. They had halted at the foot of a fairly high hill. “You’re a game little bitch, aren’t you?” [MASK] smiled with genuine admiration.
<name>He</name>	He	Ficelli	“You’d best put your suitcoat back on, or the man with the champagne will think that you’ve grown a third leg,” she teased. “Yeah,” he agreed, and then went to the door. After generously tipping the waiter, [MASK] locked the door.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Raven	Being with you, makes me even more so,” she laughed, as their drinks arrived. “Here’s to us, and may this thing of ours keep on growing,” [MASK] toasted. “I’ll drink to that.
<name>Trudy</name>	Trudy	Angelina	Then very gently, [MASK] parted his hairy cheeks with her hands and ever so slowly inserted her unbelievably long tongue. He heard her moan between his cheeks then, and instantly got his cookies all over again. When they were done, he said: “You boggle the imagination.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Aldo	Then very slowly she raised her dress inch by tantalizing inch until her enormous ass loomed like an entity unto itself. It was all [MASK] could do to keep from soiling his own sheets. Slowly she turned revealing the world’s biggest jugs with unusually dark and elongated nipples.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Signora	“You can begin at anytime you wish, [MASK],” he prompted her. “Well, gentlemen, it all began just before nine o’clock. That was when the black man who I have not seen in a couple of years showed up.”
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Raven	“I’ve never had it run down to me that way, but it makes all the sense in the world,” she agreed. “How beautifully you explained that to me, [MASK]. It makes sense, it really does.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Dallas	“I’ve got quite a few things to attend to before tomorrow night.” “What time will you be picking me up?” asked [MASK]. “At nine,” he smiled, and she studied his face.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Aldo	With lights off, they drew to a silent halt some fifty-yards from it. “[MASK] said there were three guards here, one outside and two in. You handle the outside turkey. I’ll get the other two, okay?” he whispered.
<name>Malcolm</name>	Malcolm	Ficelli	Flying-high on dynamite grass, one of the youngsters took a peep at [MASK] and promptly fell to his knees in the Moslem-worshipping position and did a salaam in the middle of the corridor. His companions quickly copied him.
<name>Delilah</name>	Delilah	Bitch	“[MASK], don’t you ever have anything else on your mind?” “Is there anything else?” she purred, painfully clenching his nipple between her front teeth. Instantly he was excited anew, but he quickly exited from his bed.
<name>Delilah</name>	Delilah	Dallas	“[MASK], loving a man like me could cause you more pain than you could ever hope of handling. I’m a lone-wolf and a bastard, by desire, birth, and all of my inclinations. Mind you, not a half-assed bastard, but a total one.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Raven	How’s that?” “Do what you have to do, I’ll be here when you’re done. I want nothing more than to relax and do nothing . . . luxuriously,” [MASK] grinned. “You do that, my darling.
<name>Chantelle</name>	Chantelle	Dallas	Slowly, the Haitian stood up with his eyes gazing down at [MASK], evoking her to wonder. Reaching into his trouser pocket he withrew a crisp $100 bill and creased it straight down the middle before putting some cocaine into it. “You two enjoy yourselves.
<name>He</name>	He	Dallas	He embraced her luscious hips, squeezing those full twin cheeks. Extending her hand down to the back of his head, she gently drew his face into that curly-haired muff below her navel. [MASK] could feel his skull sweating under her finger-tips.
<name>Salander</name>	Salander	Amalfitano	Sitting in his battered Volkswagen he was completely taken by surprise when [MASK] leaned into his window. “How the fuck did you find out where the Count lived?” he almost yelled, thinking of the money he would now lose.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Dallas	At the commencement of the gory entertainment [MASK] was fascinated with the pomp and fanfare. She even viewed it artistically, likening the matador to a ballet dancer. But when they began to pierce the hide of the brave bull with knife-like objects attached to fancy-painted sticks, the civilized grew nauseous.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Raven	“My God!” she stared at it. “[MASK] honey, there’s no way I can smoke this whole joint.” He grinned at her, nodding his understanding. “You needn’t smoke anymore than you want to,” he laughed.
<name>Dracula</name>	Dracula	Raven	As a matter of fact, I even know where he lives.” “There’s some more money in it for you if you keep a close watch on the Count. I want to know where [MASK] is staying, and the Count could lead me right to him.”
<name>she</name>	she	Stella	Baby-mine, I’m gonna tell ya somethin’ about your momma—who I don’t think you understood at all—and then maybe you’ll quit jumpin’ all over her whenever I mention her name. Now I’m aware that you feel [MASK] never loved you ...”
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Dallas	For always lurking in the recesses of his mind was the dreaded possibility that while committing a job one night, he could get busted or worse, and his beloved little [MASK] would be left all alone, subjected to the cruelties that exist in the world.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Dallas	[MASK] beamed at him. “Surprises?” “Yes. You speak Spanish like a native, and you even look pretty doing it.” “Oh, I speak enough to barely get by, but not nearly as well as I would like to.”
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Raven	stored, she raised herself and retraced [MASK]’s steps into the bathroom. While inside, she found herself experiencing mixed emotions, uncertain as to how she should react to his refusal of her. Stepping back into the living room, she saw him calmly sniffing from the cocaine he brought with them.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Dante	And if one thing could be said about professional thieves, it was that they never changed their mode of operations. And if he did so, would he risk so much on the untried skills and nerve of a mere lad? I think not, deduced [MASK].
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Momma	“Yes, baby, what is it?” “What was it you were thinking about, [MASK], that made you sad just then?” “Oh, it’s only a little thing memory brought back.
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Damian	“She didn’t say where she happened to be splittin’ to, did she?” [MASK] asked, shoving $20 into the youngster’s mitt. “No sir. She was just smilin’ like she had somethin’ special to be happy about.”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Raven	He was aware that he could easily dust the Inspector and the sergeant, but he also knew they were aware of it too. That was good thinking on his part, for the instant [MASK] was spotted going inside, 11 men took up outside positions as added security.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Fox	It has been a long time.” “No shit it has,” [MASK] laughed, grasping a hand equally as soft as his own, but with the grip of an assassin. “You look like a million dollars, young fella.
<name>Patricia</name>	Patricia	Dallas	They drove along a path equivalent to a few city blocks prior to parking their autos among a half-dozen other luxury wheels. From her seat [MASK] observed a giant of a man with steel-gray hair walking in long, quick, strides toward the Fox, who was then emerging from his car.
<name>Artie</name>	Artie	Joey	T-T-That game is as old as my ol’ man! C’mon [MASK],” he sympathized, placing an arm around his shoulders. “C’mon up to m-my suite and I’ll give’ya some clothes to wear until the tailors open in the morning.”
<name>Alonso</name>	Alonso	Raven	but where am I going?” “With me.” “B-but [MASK], my father, what shall I tell him? I-it’s not that I have to report to him, but he’ll worry if he doesn’t know where I am.
<name>Yuki</name>	Yuki	Raven	When you hinted that you loved me at first sight, it shook me up so bad because it made me happy,” he confessed, making her heart do a little dance. “[MASK], y-you’re not lying to me?”
<name>Velma</name>	Velma	Patsy	Don’t miss a livin’ ass! Somebody had to see her cornin’ or goin’. Maybe somebody saw her license plates. Get on it right away and see what you guys can scrape up. I wanna find that nigger-bitch, [MASK].”
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Sam	“Bullshit, so what! [MASK], I’m gonna find that little black bitch if it takes all of our hunters to do it! And when I do, I’m gonna personally cut out her sweet cunt! Make book on it!
<name>Jennifer</name>	Jennifer	Dallas	Is there anything else you desire?” “Not at the moment, but I would like a five o’clock call this evening to awaken me.” “I shall notify the front desk ma’am.” “Thank you,” [MASK] smiled and gave him a $5.00 tip.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Dante	[MASK] was deeply puzzled by contradictions which did not show on the surface. First of all, there was the Haitian. The mysterious master thief who had ripped off the previous robberies, was said to have been a lone wolf, never using a partner.
<name>She</name>	She	Dallas	He made certain to train her during the hottest hours of the day until her stamina left nothing to be desired. Every other day he schooled her in the martial arts for self-defense. [MASK] was using muscles she never knew she possessed.
<name>Pal</name>	Pal	Boss	Seems she took a penthouse suite just to bathe and rest up before taking off again. [MASK], I’ve been a hunter for a long time, and I’m gonna tell ya’ somethin’. This broad’s a pro. She moves like one, ya know?
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Dallas	She recalled the whole series of events that led to the encounter which turned her world around. Smiling to herself, [MASK] reached into her handbag and withdrew a neatly-rolled stick of Panamanian reefer, igniting it with the dashboard lighter.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Raven	“Yeah, she did.” “And you don’t have any objections?” “Well, I do and I don’t. Ya see [MASK], I’ve taught her every game that she knows, and I also realize that she ain’t no baby no more.
<name>Salvatore</name>	Salvatore	Patsy	Seeing him flee, six swarthy cohorts with whom he had been drinking, hastily followed. “Hey [MASK], what’sa matter?” asked the first one to catch up with him. “That fire cornin’ from the boss’ suite is what the fuck’s the matter!”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Dallas	“This cat and mouse game thoroughly excites him. He is not high on any stimulants, but look into his eyes and see the glitter.” [MASK] checked him out and sure enough, there was an excited glow in his eyes.
<name>Boomer</name>	Boomer	Fox	“Hey now, I’ve sho-nuff heard of this dude,” [MASK]’s eyes widened. “But I don’t know him.” “It’s gonna’ blow your mind when you dig who he really is.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Dallas	A rapturous [MASK] laid upon her stomach only inches away, her eyes filled with love. Her man reached into a concealed drawer at the side of the bed and brought out some African weed. He lit two joints and handed one to her.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Damian	and I’ve always found that people buy their cars in their home town. That’s where the people who know ’em can see ’em. Flashin’, ya know what I mean?” “Yeah, [MASK], I know.
<name>Escobar</name>	Escobar	Raven	Because of his access to great sums of money and the greed of prison officials, he was afforded every possible luxury except freedom. [MASK] never ate the same food as his prison inmates, nor did he associate with them.
<name>Victoria</name>	Victoria	Dallas	[MASK] marvelled at his ability to drive so swiftly with only moonlight to light his way. I must ask him about that, she mused, her adrenalin racing. He came to a stop directly in front of the exit at the north wall.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Fox	“One night we’re sittin’ around, just him and me and about half-a-dozen naked zanzies, sniffin’ coke off the top. Get this, [MASK]. He takes a sniff and then settles them big, black eyes of his on me.
<name>Signora</name>	Signora	Signora	“You could send me a case of Chianti. Now that would really keep an old woman company,” she laughed. “Then you shall have it. [MASK]. I’ll have one of my men return with it within the hour, how’s that?”
<name>Yamamoto</name>	Yamamoto	Luigi	Take my word for it, even if you did succeed in killing that scum, it would be quite difficult for you to escape from there with your valuable life intact. But with [MASK] along it will not be difficult at all.” “You know the area well?”
<name>James</name>	James	Joe	“Okay.” Setting their glasses upon an elongated coffee-table, they began to move in unison to the accompaniment of mellow string music. When it concluded, [MASK] refilled their glasses and they reclined upon the sofa in front of a glowing fireplace.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Aldo	she entreated. “Get away from me,” he hissed angrily, with murder in his heart. “[MASK] would now be alive, but for a request I made of him. It’s my beef, and I’m gonna chew it.
<name>Is</name>	Is	Raven	I swear it. [MASK] my best friend, tell me what is wrong with me?” “You mean, aside from needing to have your ass spanked like the child you behave as?” he scolded, bringing the first smile of that day to her face.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Dallas	“L-look, you don’t owe me anything, no explanation, no . . . nothing. Just let me go, please,” she murmured, her tears then spilling over. “[MASK]! Don’t, baby, don’t cry.”
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Popsy	“Then 1 look a whole lot better than 1 feel,” he groaned, seating himself at her table which was shaded by a beach umbrella. “[MASK], can 1 get you something?” “Yeah.” “What?”
<name>He</name>	He	Raven	she screamed. He quickly embraced her, holding her tightly to him. “You mustn’t think that.” “That’s why he isn’t here yet. [MASK]. I know it, I tell you.”
<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Rosanna	Circling like a shark around her, he pulled hard at her bikini knot, exposing her naked rump. [MASK] screamed. Taking off after him, she swam in pursuit, only to have him just escape her clutches.
<name>John</name>	John	Dallas	“Why so quiet, [MASK]?” “I was only thinking about the things you’ve said to me. Tell me more.” “About what?” “About what you were just saying to me, it’s interesting.”
<name>afraid</name>	afraid	Anna	I have heard that even in prison, he has publicly sworn to slice your throat.” “I am not [MASK]. If he doesn’t want that stiletto of his shoved straight up his ass, he’d best stay away from me.
<name>Yuri</name>	Yuri	Joe	“Let’s go,” he saw those moist lips say. “Where?” “To your suite, if it’s okay with you, [MASK],” came her seemingly tipsy reply. “I-If it’s okay with me?!”
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Dallas	If you can’t replace what you wish for me to throw away, don’t even suggest it.” To his sudden surprise, [MASK] broke into ringing laughter. He did not join in her mirth. Instead he eyed her.
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Dallas	Her host poured for them both and then raised his glass to eye level. “To us,” he smiled. Having tasted similar wines on many previous occasions, [MASK] chose to react with an air of innocence, prettily wrinkling her nose like a beginner.
<name>She</name>	She	Rosanna	For a long interval he remained that way in the sun. Then he beckoned to her and [MASK] ran across the pasture to where he stood. Together they sank to the grass, and crickets were treated to life from another angle.
<name>Trudy</name>	Trudy	Toni	Look [MASK], I admit I was a little unsure of you at first, but now that I know you’re not a hooker, I want ya to dig me just like I dig you. I’ve been around a lot of dames in my life, but you, you’ve got class.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Dallas	He lit two joints and handed one to her. [MASK] thought she was then as high as she could possibly get, but one drag from that block-buster reefer and her high soared. “My God!” she stared at it.
<name>She</name>	She	Dallas	“Okay babe, go and get perfect for me. I’ll be inside the bedroom when you’re finished.” [MASK] rose up only to gaze back down upon him, giving the impression she was deep in thought.
<name>Carfleur</name>	Carfleur	Amalfitano	“Of course,” the Haitian smiled. “And you did not know that [MASK] had sworn to cut your throat whenever he laid eyes on you again?” “Of course I knew. But if I were to say that I was worried about it.
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Dallas	I smell trouble in the air and you’re as Fidgety as a dog shitting on thumb-tacks! What’s going on?” She told him she was worried about her father. “[MASK], the point is why are you worried if a player is apt to get lost now and then?”
<name>brother</name>	brother	Lenara	“Why do that, when you need only ask your [MASK]?” “It’s my thing, that’s why. Believe it or not, I get a greater charge out of cracking a sucker’s safe than I do from sex.”
<name>Chantelle</name>	Chantelle	Dallas	The Haitian wasn’t frowning and his voice was still very soft, but [MASK] knew without a doubt that he meant every word. “Then what you’re saying is, you don’t want my money?” “No, baby, not at all.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Raven	Unclasping his arms from his dates, he warmly embraced the big man. “My friend, it is grand to see you again,” he said softly, smiling. “How are you? “Just great, [MASK], just great!”
<name>Haitian</name>	Haitian	Rossana	Holding her close to him, he riveted his eyes on the set as [MASK] want to turn up the sound. The Italian commentator was also excited, and when the cameras showed the front of the house, the Haitian immediately guessed what was wrong.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Lenara	“Yes.” “And she doesn’t mind?” “Why should she? [MASK] knows where she stands with me, and besides, she has no desire to delve in petty jealousies brought about by latent insecurities.” “Where does she stand with you?”
<name>Rocco</name>	Rocco	Tonti	No Italian noble-woman would permit that. If we keep tabs on that fuckin’ Count, I’ll soon get my hands on that nigger ladies man.” “I’ll stake-out for you, if you make it worth my while,” [MASK] told him.
<name>Lucien</name>	Lucien	Raven	He kills almost as much for pleasure as he does for sustenance,” the Haitian enlightened her. “[MASK],” she softly said, “hold me.” Then, to change the morbid subject, she asked, “Can we leave here tomorrow?
<name>Artemis</name>	Artemis	Raven	Why, [MASK]? You don’t have to, so why?” “You’ve been wanting to hear this for a long time, so I’ll tell you. This round of thefts will be my last. I’m retiring for good this winter.”
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Patsy	“He’s gone off-duty sir, left about twenty-five minutes ago.” “Get him back here,” [MASK] ordered. “I’m afraid only the casino manager knows how to reach him, sir. Would you care to speak to him concerning your inquiry?”
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Raven	“Something insidv of me cares how you’re feeling at this moment, so I want you to hear this.” “[MASK] ... I’d rather not, really. I would prefer it if we just forgot about what did or didn’t take place a moment ago.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Ficelli	Satisfied, she extracted her lighter and touched it to the curtain. The sound of running water ceased and seconds later she reappeared with only her boots on. Sitting in the center of the bed with a hard-on, [MASK] extended his arms to her.
<name>Carmela</name>	Carmela	Raven	“Believe it, [MASK]. Here I am, approaching my fiftieth year of life and my bull of a husband is still making babies. He must love what he has been getting all of these years, si?” “Without a doubt!”
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Raven	Fella’, if anything goes wrong on just one of these capers. I’m gonna personally soak your dick in a bottle of acid,” he spat through clenched teeth. “I wouldn’t cross you [MASK]! B-by now you should know that.”
<name>Sissy</name>	Sissy	Dallas	As they approached the distance of five miles, [MASK]’ legs began to ache in the worst way and her lungs felt filled with fire. Shit on that, she grew angry. He’ll have to run me to death before I quit. Another one-half mile
<name>Sharon</name>	Sharon	Dallas	When he turned to stand between his feminine companions, [MASK] got her initial view of the Haitian and her pussy literally twitched. It scared her. Of average height and apparently in top physical shape, he wore a European-styled, conservative dinner suit which was obviously tailored by a master.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Damian	“What sting? C’mon tell me, I’m her father. I’ve got money and I can make it right with whoever took the loss.” Maybe he can, [MASK] pondered. It wouldn’t hurt to call and check it out.
<name>Yes</name>	Yes	Si	“That is for sure. Inspector,” he painfully replied. “I still don’t know what hit me.” “And you too say a fellow entered the guard shack holding a pistol with a silencer, is that right?” “[MASK], Inspector.
<name>Roxy</name>	Roxy	Fox	[MASK] exclaimed. “It should be against the law to be so fine and rich and sexy, too.” “Didn’t I tell’ya, huh? I said he’d be certain to have one zanzy on his arm, and here that bastard shows up with two.
<name>Inspector</name>	Inspector	Dante	“I was mad as hell when I returned this morning, but how can I remain so, with a young wife such as this one, eh? I am still on my honeymoon, [MASK], so you find those thieves for me.”
<name>He</name>	He	Patsy	Minutes later found him approaching the cashier’s window, frowning. “Where’s the guy who was here about two hours ago?” [MASK] asked a blond man inside the cage. “He’s gone off-duty sir, left about twenty-five minutes ago.”
<name>Marvin</name>	Marvin	Dallas	For in my personal opinion, you can do no wrong. So be it,” she concluded. “And you [MASK]?” “If you’re looking for another beef to chew this morning, you won’t get it from me, honey.
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Dallas	[MASK] was an expert swimmer, having been taught by experts hired by her father after the drowning death of her mother. “We’ll see who drowns,” she said, and dove deep. Knowing she was up to something, he also went under.
<name>guy</name>	guy	Joey	You want some of me, tough [MASK]? You’ve got it!” With the conclusion of her statement, she leaned to her left and her right foot shot at him, catching him in the pelvis and sending him crashing into the wall behind him.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Serpe	You see, even though I was upstairs, I find it extremely difficult to imagine only one-and-a-half persons putting us to sleep with the kind of precision they used. [MASK] was the first one struck from behind, and he is still partially paralyzed.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Y’all	He hurried to greet her and she also found herself suddenly being raised high into the air. “Ain’t you a beauty! Goddamn,” he admired, before kissing her flush upon the lips and setting her back onto her feet. “[MASK] c’mon into my shack and meet everybody.
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Raven	His proposal brought tears to the eyes of the sensitive noblewoman, as she began to understand the relationship between [MASK] and this smiling giant. “I-I think that is a fantastic idea!” Her eyes shone.
