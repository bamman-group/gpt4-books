<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Dennis	"That's strange," [MASK] said. “In a way it's understandable. He says that a lot of women won't report rape, especially if they are married women. He says they feel that they might be accused of inviting it in some Way."
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Kevin	[MASK]'s throat and chest throbbed, then a rush of tears clouded his vision. Torn by fear and sorrow, he could feel death clawing at him now. Through the blur of tears he saw his father's metal box, lying where he had put it earlier.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Vil	Later on today we will have more time together so that I can get down to preparing your case. Meanwhile, you must trust that I'll do everything possible to get you out of here a free man." "I wish you luck [MASK]— What's you name again?"
<name>He</name>	He	Hannibal	Maybe his brother can help. She actually worked for him. If you would like to sit down I'll get him." [MASK] took a seat and waited. His thoughts were still hopelessly tangled and he shut his eyes and tried to unravel them.
<name>John</name>	John	Shannon	He dropped his head and spoke softly. "[MASK], let's forgo the niceties. I come begging, as they say. I've been thoughtless and selfish, and I'm sorry to the bone. I truly love you.
<name>John</name>	John	Kevin	She doesn't seem to be feeling so good." "What's wrong?" "Oh, nothing serious. It's mostly her mood, I guess. Hardly got a word out of her all day." [MASK] hurried up the stairs.
<name>He</name>	He	Kevin	She pursed her lips and scanned the menu. [MASK] had never seen such a woman, such a dining room, or such a menu. There were things he had never heard of, and he was sure that his pronunciation of some of the exotic names would show his ignorance.
<name>He</name>	He	Meath	I don't smoke." "Brandy — or a shot of whiskey?" "Little too early for me." "Well, not for me." [MASK] poured a healthy tot of brandy into a glass and downed it with one gulp. "
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Sullivan	"Very very special: my great-great-grandfather on my father's side." "Robust name. Must have been a good man." "Fine man, sir." [MASK] started digging through a stack of resumes. "Well now.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Kevin	"Well, how's it going, lad?" He was all cheer. [MASK] managed a smile of his own. "A few wrinkles today but otherwise okay. Have a seat. Glad to see you."
<name>own child</name>	own child	Elizabeth	For an instant, she felt a certain pity for him — but only for an instant. She wondered what kind of woman had given birth to him, if she were dead or alive — if she had loved and nursed him as she would have loved and nursed her [MASK].
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Nora	"Where is she?" He asked in a whisper, glancing about, taking a quick look at all the splendor of the room. [MASK] shook her head hopelessly and pointed up the stairs. "In the nursery trimming a Christmas tree that arrived this morning.
<name>Mr. Crosetti</name>	Mr. Crosetti	Kevin	"I think this turn screw could be a mite larger, no? About one-sixteenth of the inch — maybe little more — and the grooves, they could be deeper, no?" [MASK] bent over and looked closer at the piece of metal. "
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Casey	"During workers' time off, you might know — Sunday morning at ten. Ah, what a single-minded cheapskate the man is." "All the men still with you, [MASK]?" "Far as I see, they are.
<name>doctor</name>	doctor	Kevin	Strange, she doesn't have much of a temperature, and the blood pressure is just a mite above normal. Otherwise I can't find a thing wrong with her. I'm sure after she gets sufficient rest she will be fine, [MASK]."
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Hannibal	[MASK] got up and reached for his coat and the box. "I'm not exactly afraid of death. I faced it for two years in the trenches while you was back here being a homicider. Just call me by my right name, since you know it."
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Bridie	Come on, let's eat. I've fixed a good meal for us. By this time next week postulant [MASK] will be fasting on bread and water — and her hips will be all the better for it." "What time is your train in the morning?"
<name>doctor</name>	doctor	Sullivan	"They're going to have to do some cutting on you, the doctor says." "Yes, he told me." "You won't feel anything. They'll give you gas or something. Just hold on." "That [MASK] deserves to be hung."
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Casey	"No, sir. It would be hard to even make a guess, sir." "Well, dammit, [MASK], there's a nigger in our woodpile somewhere, and I intend to ferret him out." "Why not call a meeting, sir?
<name>Myra</name>	Myra	Montrose	"I love you, girl." "Deep?" "Very deep." At Sunday breakfast she asked, "Do you think I've overdone the plans for the nursery?" "No. Why do you ask?" "[MASK] thinks so.
<name>Andy</name>	Andy	Hannibal	" The warden's voice seemed strangely weak, more obligatory than compelling, as if it had arrived tired from some boundless distance. "I'm ready," [MASK] answered, and the power in his voice spread his presence throughout the entire cell block.
<name>Joe's</name>	Joe's	Minsky	The smile she then gave him was wreathed in maliciousness. "Now you know very well what a star strip is. You've been to [MASK]'s a lot, 'cause I've seen you there time after time."
<name>Julian</name>	Julian	Prudence	This prayer and many more she prayed all that night, and for several weeks thereafter. But time wouldn't allow her to swallow her suffering. She went about the abbey totally confused, avoiding [MASK] whenever she could, her thoughts tangled with sorrow for her friend and guilt for herself.
<name>Nanny</name>	Nanny	Nora	At midmonth she began long vigils in the nursery behind locked door. On certain days she never left her bedroom, and got up only to brush her teeth or bathe. [MASK] brought food to her and the two cats, which had become her constant companions.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Shannon	There's no place for them to go," she said wearily. "But somehow we will figure out something to do with them." As she talked her eyes roamed the dimly lit underground where, as she had been told. [MASK] would now live out her life.
<name>Baby</name>	Baby	Elizabeth	Sorry, darling, but [MASK] is really acting up. Tired of being locked in, I guess. You'd better call the doctor." "Pains again?" "Yes, bad ones about every ten minutes."
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	One	"I'd gone down there to visit him for a couple of weeks. The second night we was walking along, minding our own business, when this car pulls up beside us. Two crackers jump out and tell us to get into the car. [MASK] had a pistol. '
<name>Patton</name>	Patton	Wilson	Take my word. The Allies have been softening the Germans up. Now enter [MASK] to deliver the final blow and come out a goddamned hero. Well, fine for him — I'll chip in to buy him a medal."
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Hannibal	She could faintly hear the voices of the children above reciting mass. "Poor little prisoners babbling all that holy tripe," she said. She got up and turned on a music box to drown out the sound. She picked up [MASK]'s note and read it again.
<name>Mother Superior</name>	Mother Superior	Kevin	She was especially taken with those who wore the big white bonnets, but it was surely more than that. "Are you sure?" [MASK] had asked. Her mind raced back to the novitiate. No one there had put the question to her directly.
<name>Scobie</name>	Scobie	Kevin	[MASK] asked. One of them gave him a quick, curious glance and went on without answering. The other one turned up an alleyway. In a few moments the intersection was clogged with police vans and ambulances. The evening extras carried the message: Bomb Explodes!
<name>Dr. Parsons</name>	Dr. Parsons	Kevin	“Not a wink," [MASK] answered. “Doesn't she show signs of fatigue?" "Very little, if any. Can you come over?" “Why yes, of course, but the most I could do is give her a sedative.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Kevin	Another nurse told him that she had been taken to the delivery room. "You can see her if you wish, but she is still in labor." [MASK] said he would, and she put him into a white gown and took him into the room.
<name>style</name>	style	Hannibal	Then, saluting smartly, he clicked his heels and strode off to pass the news along to his fellow soldiers. There was something he liked about the captain. He didn't seem arrogant like the other officers, and he had class, [MASK] thought.
<name>George</name>	George	Kevin	"I thought the space might be used differently now. Maybe a guest room or a den — something like that," [MASK] mumbled, and in turn became seemingly fascinated with his soup. "But I don't want one thing changed, darling."
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Kevin	It was nine o'clock in the evening. [MASK] sat at the dining-room table studying a sketch he had just completed. There was something about it that wasn't right. He erased several lines, drew them in again, and studied some more.
<name>Ford</name>	Ford	Sullivan	In every direction, as far as one could see, there was something that [MASK] had built — foundry, machine shops, magazine, shell assembly buildings, power station, warehouses, tooling plants, and secondary office buildings.
<name>Doctor</name>	Doctor	Kevin	"Why — why, well, surely [MASK] must know. Perhaps . . . well, maybe he doesn't know." The door opened and a nurse came in with a washbasin, a bottle of alcohol, and a towel.
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Kevin	"Well, I need help. The place I was working closed several months ago. I'm out of a job." "Where were you working?" "At the Congo Club. I was an entertainer there." [MASK]'s confusion was still apparent. "
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Kevin	And despite his esquestrian shortcomings [MASK] looked forward with eagerness to those weekends. He liked the sinewy power of a big horse striding beneath him, the vigorous, thick odor of leather and animal sweat after brisk canters, the quiet beauty of trails snaking through tangled shade.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Kevin	[MASK] cried as he bolted past the police and ran through the door to the stairway. Two firemen grappled with him, but he shoved them aside as if they were weightless and bounded up the stairs. A blast of flame and smoke engulfed him at the second level.
<name>Mrs. Morris</name>	Mrs. Morris	Kevin	Did you notice any excessive amount of tension on the second night?" [MASK] thought for several moments. "Yes, I remember now that she was all nerves and had very little to say to anyone. That was the night she had the terrible nightmare."
<name>God</name>	God	Hannibal	She moved toward the rail, climbed over it, shut her eyes, then fell free, free of hiding, free of shame, free of [MASK], free of a God who would forsake them. The wake opened as she splashed into it.
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Hannibal	[MASK] took the handkerchief from his pocket and unfolded it. Then pointing at the minute flake he said, "That's it." The woman smiled. "Why, you can hardly see it." "It will get very large under a microscope."
<name>someone</name>	someone	Kevin	They were working in [MASK]'s study. "Good. How many have answered to date?" "About half. I'd say." "Has anyone declined as yet?" "Only one so far. I have it right here."
<name>Someone</name> (There is no clear indication of who the person entering the room is, so this is a guess based on the lack of context.)	Someone (There is no clear indication of who the person entering the room is, so this is a guess based on the lack of context.)	Shannon	He had hoped that time might rescue her from the dilemma, but time had failed him. [MASK] was turning the knob and opening the door. They stepped inside and she lifted her arms in joy. "It's perfect — just perfect."
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Meath	[MASK] passed him without speaking, but halfway down the corridor he turned back to him. "Didn't you know that the child was dead before they took it from my daughter?" he asked. "What?"
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Meath	You can't do this to me! I hate you. Mother Pious — I hate you, you witch! I hate you!" Her voice was filled with hatred. When [MASK] came running she awakened fully and fell into his arms, sobbing.
<name>He</name>	He	Kevin	"Would you like to have a bite of lunch? I'm interested, but I promised my daughter I'd lunch with her — and she's not to be kept waiting. How about it? You're most welcome." [MASK] was highly pleased.
<name>The decorator</name>	The decorator	Montrose	Venetian marble, delicately laced with pink and blue strands, had been ordered for the baths. Two dumbwaiters would lift food from the kitchen pantry to the main floors. [MASK] was still struggling with the dining room, but everything else seemed to be in order.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Shannon	What she had suspected all along was now confirmed — a darkness of some kind was falling over her best friend. A few minutes later [MASK] feigned illness, quietly excused herself, went to her bedroom, undressed, and got into bed.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Elizabeth	Yards and yards and yards of it fluttering through the flowers. [MASK] waved her hand and the water bubbled open and a spiraled stairway, as white as a cloud, floated upward and they slowly descended it, their dressing billowing as they went. She was laughing.
<name>Flappers</name>	Flappers	Melissa	So that they might further show themselves off as emancipated women, [MASK] presented each one with an elegantly carved cigarette holder. "At last we have the right to vote! I see no reason why we women shouldn't smoke and drink along with our men," she proclaimed at the height of the party.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Helen	Do you remember when the deceased, or you, first missed this cuff link? Think hard now. It's very important." [MASK]'s face clouded and she thought hard but not for long. "It was in early August, back in nineteen eighteen.
<name>Steve</name>	Steve	Bridie	"I wouldn't think you'd need that explained to you either, since you haven't dropped a sou here for months. [MASK] and I foot all the bills while you eat, sleep, and then disappear for weeks." "That's a goddamned lie!"
<name>The Swede</name>	The Swede	Hannibal	He wondered how the wounded one kept alive. He was very black but his forehead, with all the skin gone, was dead white. The racket grew even greater, but [MASK] no longer flinched from the noise. His fear had been replaced with an ugly kind of peace.
<name>he</name>	he	Kevin	I will love you forever, and I will miss you so much." [MASK] gave her a final hug. "So long, old girl," he said softly. "Remember us in your prayers." "And you, dear brother, pray for me."
<name>Edmund</name>	Edmund	Elizabeth	His hardness returned. In a matter of seconds he was thrusting his hardness into her. She gave herself freely. Her thoughts were far distant from his outpouring of passion. She roamed, with [MASK], by the side of an endless still lake that appeared like a mirror.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Kevin	[MASK] folded the piece of paper and put it into his pocket. "I want to say again that I can't thank you enough for what you did for me, and I'm terribly sorry about what happened at the hospital. I'm damned ashamed of that."
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Nora	One shouldn't get too familiar with the servants, he had heard; doing so bred disrespect. [MASK] was nice, competent but a bit too uppercrust at times. She'd been around the rich for so long she seemed a part of them, despite her accent.
<name>days</name>	days	Kevin	Christ, he'd do it fight and cried afterward, but even this ve: had enjoyed it; he had been sure of it then spent, kissing away the salty tears. He blurt it out to the old fart a couple of and [MASK] were away.
<name>the prosecution</name>	the prosecution	Crenshaw	Your Honor." The judge's head dipped in acknowledgment. "Would the prosecution care to cross-examine the witness now?" "Yes, we would. Your Honor," [MASK] said, jumping up to his feet and moving to the witness stand.
<name>Phryne</name>	Phryne	Kevin	[MASK] remained quiet for several moments, thinking. "Well?" "Seeing that man was like seeing a ghost." "Well, I must say he was an awfully live one. Was it something serious?" she asked.
<name>Eleanor</name>	Eleanor	Shannon	After all, there was his business with its high war priority, and there was [MASK] — who would certainly be shocked to even know he was in this building. All this was a little crazy. He would have to give it more thought, just a bit more.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Kevin	What memories she now had of him were so dark that she regretted having been born to him. Perhaps he had loved her, in his own perverse way. But her love for him had already been fading when he snuffed it out completely by dealing the cruel blow to [MASK].
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Hannibal	I regret so that I will never be able to express all of those reasons to you. As for me, I had your love. It will last in me for as long as I live. Forgive me, [MASK]. My heart is forever with you.
<name>Death</name>	Death	Hannibal	"He restoreth my soul: He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake." [MASK] sat alone now, waiting, looking more powerful than ever, his big muscled arms bulging against the straps, his shoulders squared, his head erect beneath the black hood.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Bridie	"Are you all right now, my child?" the nun asked. [MASK] stood numbly, unable to speak. The nun remained quiet, allowing her time to compose herself. Is something bothering you, child?"
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Meath	[MASK] cringed as the signs crashed against the windows and sides of the car. Three men jumped in front of the vehicle, attempting to halt it. The chauffeur slowed down. "Drive on, you idiot! Do you want us murdered? Drive on!"
<name>steel</name>	steel	Meath	" "Oil isn't the only thing, [MASK]. Mechanization and electrical works are bound to mushroom. I'd venture that by the end of the year there'll be a sixty-five-percent increase in this kind of output alone.
<name>Wolfsheim</name>	Wolfsheim	Sullivan	"Not at all, not at all." He went to the closet and snatched out his brown Chesterfield overcoat and a derby. "Let's be off, or I'll be tarred and feathered." [MASK]'s Pierce-Arrow and its driver awaited him at curbside.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Kevin	Her whole life was wrapped into [MASK]'s. She had new dreams to turn out with him — dreams far beyond the small talk, gossipy chatter, and boorish Irish-Catholic manners these deserters indulged in. It was the Four Hundred set she aspired to now.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Bridget	And still trembling, she stood there for a moment or so waiting, wondering if she should sound the bell once more. Then a small square opened within the door, and two eyes peered through. "Who is it that would enter?" "The postulant [MASK].
<name>you</name>	you	Hannibal	Despite what he would have [MASK] think, he knew the odds weighed heavily against them, and he had prepared his case well. On the table exhibiting the evidence lay the ring and the cuff link. Now his time had come. Standing beside the witness chair, he said.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Kevin	[MASK] watched his father intently until the raspy breathing had resumed, then he picked up the box and looked at it. It was metal and fastened with a padlock. He shook it, hearing its contents flop about inside, then laid it on the floor.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Phoebe	"Oh, that can wait. You have to eat. It's just across the street. Not at all fancy, but good food." He smiled broadly. "Come on, [MASK]. Won't take more than a half hour."
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Shannon	"You are weary and I am weary. Why don't you go up to bed and try to sleep it off. We can talk about it later." He went to her, touching her shoulder again. "[MASK], I love you."
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	O'Laughlin	There was no move to make — not right away. He would be patient and ride it out. The detective from [MASK]'s office puffed steadily on his cigar, sending clouds of smoke up toward the precinct ceiling. It was very hot and beads of sweat rolled down his cheeks.
<name>Mr. White</name>	Mr. White	Kevin	"Well — well, if you'll come along I'll show you. It's better that you see for yourself, with your own eyes." [MASK] dropped his papers and followed her through the kitchen and down to the basement.
<name>Mr. Stevens</name>	Mr. Stevens	Whitney	Having yielded to the fear of her confusion she was relieved that she had done something about it. By eleven sharp she sat silent before him. The cordial greetings were over and [MASK], having lit his pipe, eased her into the conversation he knew she had come for.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Crenshaw	And if my coming here can in some way halt death, then I will be most thankful that I came." [MASK] turned sharply toward the bench. "Your Honor," he said with visible aggravation, "I am finished with the witness."
<name>Old Dan</name>	Old Dan	Meath	"I surely intend to when the time comes." The merriment tapered off. His words had suddenly cast a pall over the gathering. "You're privileged, lad," [MASK] said. "No sense in rushing to your death.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Shannon	"All right." She walked slowly to the liquor chest, took out a decanter, and filled two glasses. "Wonderful party last week. I had a marvelous time." "I'm glad. [MASK] put a lot of effort into it."
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Phoebe	My heart is forever with you. Goodbye. [MASK] Through a blur of disbelief, he read the letter a half-dozen times. It was like a death sentence; a killing of summer with one blast of winter wind.
<name>Dad</name>	Dad	Monty	The car pulled up to the entranceway. They got out and stood for a moment, looking out over the manicured lawns. "I wish [MASK] was here to see this," she said. The butler opened the door.
<name>George</name>	George	Kevin	And don't forget our hunt. You will have a wonderful time." "[MASK] and I are looking forward to it. It will be his very first one and he wouldn't miss it for anything." She kissed his cheek and left.
<name>Flower</name>	Flower	Elizabeth	She was laughing. [MASK] was laughing, laughing, laughing, floating about, picking blue, pink, purple, white, green, yellow, red, orange flowers. There were black ones too that were covered with red thorns and they were left unpicked.
<name>he</name>	he	Vilna	I'll always keep them and treasure them." "If that's so, then I'm glad." "It's so. Believe me." "Will you be inside?" "I'll be there," [MASK] answered.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Kevin	[MASK] took some pennies from his pocket and gave them to the boy. He walked on in a daze, passing a badly crippled girl selling chestnuts and pretzels by a curbside fire. She had unusually large, dark eyes set off by finely shaped features.
<name>He</name>	He	Masters	"I hope I can count on that. We're going to need him." [MASK] acknowledged the bulge of her gown with a smile. "You can," he replied. He pulled on his coat, wished her a happy holiday, and left.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Kevin	[MASK] took another long look at his mother's picture and returned it to its place. Suddenly fatigue struck him like a hammer blow, and he slumped into the big rocking chair next to the bed. He usually avoided that chair. Perhaps it was a mental hangover from childhood.
<name>Charity</name>	Charity	Shannon	Life at the mansion was slowly settling into an easy routine of chess, dominoes, or maybe billiards at night. [MASK] spent two mornings a week at the Red Cross headquarters folding bandages and wrapping packages to be sent to the troops overseas.
<name>him</name>	him	Kevin	"None. We don't have the slightest idea where he could be." The priest adjusted his steel-rimmed spectacles, pulled a newspaper from his pocket, and unfolded it before [MASK]. "I almost forgot. Here's the morning paper, lad.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Sullivan	What's he aim to do, build a skyscraper, sir?" [MASK] chuckled. "Just the foundation for one. He's got a way, he says, to speed business up, some idea about getting three times the work done with only half the people.
<name>Gregor</name>	Gregor	Shannon	"A photograph of the two of us? Oh — oh yes, quite a while back. It was taken in his office. All about an accident I had. Not much to it really. I'd forgotten about it." "Do you and [MASK] have children?
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Lipkin	"I'm not your friend — and if you think we're bluffing, you're even dumber than I thought." [MASK] blanched and hid his anger with a grin. "I'll get to the point.
<name>Earrings</name>	Earrings	Puppy	You must have dropped it somewhere." "Probably on the floor someplace." I hope you haven't lost it. [MASK]. They're so pretty, and they're real gold, you know." "Probably on the floor."
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Phoebe	"We've been worried about you, [MASK]. Are you all right?" "I'm fine, sir. Just resting a lot." "Could I come in for a second?" "Well — well. I'm just getting ready for bed.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Hannibal	No, she couldn't do that. She considered trying to destroy the child, but neither did the courage nor a way to do it come to her. And [MASK] must never know. He would never understand, and she couldn't blame him.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Kevin	When [MASK] refused it, he downed a stiff one himself. "What's the matter?" he asked, "On the wagon?" "Nope. Just not in the mood right now. Later maybe." "I need it.
