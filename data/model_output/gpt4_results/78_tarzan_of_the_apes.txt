<name>Godfrey</name>	Godfrey	Clayton	There is only one way to keep him in safety, and that is to chain him to a tree. The poor dear is SO impractical." "I have it!" suddenly exclaimed [MASK]. "You can use a revolver, can't you?"
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Tarzan	For an hour [MASK] feasted his eyes upon her while she wrote. How he longed to speak to her, but he dared not attempt it, for he was convinced that, like the young man, she would not understand him, and he feared, too, that he might frighten her away.
<name>Bara</name>	Bara	Numa	At last the vision of a beautiful face, and the memory of warm lips crushed to his dissolved the fascinating picture he had been drawing of his old life. The ape-man threw the warm carcass of [MASK] across his shoulders and took to the trees once more.
<name>Long</name>	Long	Tarzan	The men put down their burdens, and then one caught sight of the notice which [MASK] had posted. "Ho, mates!" he cried. "What's here? This sign was not posted an hour ago or I'll eat the cook."
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Tarzan	"This little mark," he said, "is many times larger upon this map than your cabin is upon the earth. Do you see now how very far it is?" [MASK] thought for a long time.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Jane	It was impossible to believe that that perfect body, so filled with triumphant life, could ever cease to harbor the vital spark--as soon believe that immortality were dust. As [MASK] permitted herself to harbor these thoughts, others equally unwelcome forced themselves upon her.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Tarzan	[MASK] had been surprised when he had found the girl he had learned to love after a vague and abstract manner a willing prisoner in his arms. Now he was surprised that she repulsed him. He came close to her once more and took hold of her arm.
<name>Sabor</name>	Sabor	Sabor	If he could catch his fellow apes with his long arm of many grasses, why not [MASK], the lioness? It was the germ of a thought, which, however, was destined to mull around in his conscious and subconscious mind until it resulted in magnificent achievement.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Tarzan	Presently his quick ears detected the familiar sound of padded feet and the brushing of a huge, fur-clad body through the undergrowth. [MASK] came quietly above the unsuspecting beast and silently stalked him until he came into a little patch of moonlight.
<name>Thumbelina</name>	Thumbelina	Tarzan	Why it spread half across his face! It certainly must be fine to be so handsome, thought poor little [MASK]. But when he saw his own eyes; ah, that was the final blow--a brown spot, a gray circle and then blank whiteness!
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Kerchak	But [MASK] was close upon her, so close that he had almost grasped her ankle had she not made a furious leap far into space from one tree to another--a perilous chance which apes seldom if ever take, unless so closely pursued by danger that there is no alternative.
<name>Hathi</name>	Hathi	Horta	In his hand was his slender bow to which he had fitted one of his death dealing arrows. Opposite him across the little clearing stood [MASK], the boar, with lowered head and foam flecked tusks, ready to charge.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Tarzan	So on the following day they started north along the shore. Each man carrying a rifle and ammunition, beside bedding and some food and cooking utensils. The latter seemed to [MASK] a most useless encumbrance, so he threw his away. "
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Tarzan	The mighty tusker turned at the sound of his falling body, and, seeing only the easy prey of a young ape, he lowered his head and charged madly at the surprised youth. [MASK], happily, was uninjured by the fall, alighting catlike upon all fours far outspread to take up the shock.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	D'Arnot	And on the other hand she maintains that the continued absence of your omnipotent jungle friend indicates that [MASK] is still in need of his services, either because he is wounded, or still is a prisoner in a more distant native village."
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Esmeralda	"You all don't mean to tell ME that you're going to stay right here in this here land of carnivable animals when you all got the opportunity to escapade on that boat? Don't you tell me THAT, honey." "Why, [MASK]!
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Clayton	The man started in surprise, but with a bound was at the side of the sleeping man. Shaking him roughly by the shoulder, he cried: "My God, [MASK], are you all mad here? Don't you know you are nearly surrounded by fire?
<name>Herbert</name>	Herbert	Mirando	Again [MASK]'s shrill cry of mortal terror had caused them to look back, and there they had seen the most horrible sight--their companion's body flying upwards into the trees, his arms and legs beating the air and his tongue protruding from his open mouth.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Tarzan	Was not [MASK] a Man? But what did men do? He was puzzled; for he did not know. He wished that he might ask the girl, and then it came to him that she had already answered him in the futile struggle she had made to escape and to repulse him.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tarzan	To [MASK] this was always a source of never-ending mystery and pleasure. He would peek into the curtained windows, or, climbing upon the roof, peer down the black depths of the chimney in vain endeavor to solve the unknown wonders that lay within those strong walls.
<name>Roger</name>	Roger	Tarzan	At length [MASK] looked up to watch the girl as she examined the locket. He could not fathom the meaning of the faces within, but he could read the interest and fascination upon the face of the live young creature by his side.
<name>Ashton</name>	Ashton	Clayton	"Don't say that. You do not understand." But before she could go on a sudden turn in the road brought them into the midst of a little hamlet. Before them stood [MASK]'s car surrounded by the party he had brought from the cottage.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Tarzan	As [MASK] grew he made more rapid strides, so that by the time he was ten years old he was an excellent climber, and on the ground could do many wonderful things which were beyond the powers of his little brothers and sisters.
<name>Mirando</name>	Mirando	Mirando	"You tell us this great story," he said, "because you do not dare to speak the truth. You do not dare admit that when the lion sprang upon [MASK] you ran away and left him. You are cowards."
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Tarzan	So much had [MASK] seen that day that his head was in a whirl of wonder. But the most wonderful sight of all, to him, was the face of the beautiful white girl. Here at last was one of his own kind; of that he was positive.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Clayton	She turned quickly and entered the cabin. [MASK] was an Englishman, so the girl had passed quite out of sight before he deduced what reply a man would have made. "Upon my word," he said ruefully, "she called me a liar.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Jane	At her feet lay the prostrate form of the Negress. If she could but arouse her, their combined efforts might possibly avail to beat back the fierce and bloodthirsty intruder. [MASK] stooped to grasp the black woman by the shoulder. Roughly she shook her.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Kulonga	[MASK]'s bow and arrows were securely tied high in the top of a giant tree from which a patch of bark had been removed by a sharp knife near to the ground, and a branch half cut through and left hanging about fifty feet higher up.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Kerchak	As the din of the drum rose to almost deafening volume [MASK] sprang into the open space between the squatting males and the drummers. Standing erect he threw his head far back and looking full into the eye of the rising moon he beat upon his breast with his great hairy paws and emitted his fearful roaring shriek.
<name>Kerchak</name>	Kerchak	Terkoz	All the tribe have heard. Quarrel no more with your king or your people, for next time I shall kill you. Do you understand?" "HUH," assented [MASK]. "And you are satisfied?" "HUH," said the ape.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Tarzan	[MASK] dispatched his prisoner quickly and silently; removed the weapons and ornaments, and--oh, the greatest joy of all--a handsome deerskin breechcloth, which he quickly transferred to his own person. Now indeed was he dressed as a man should be.
<name>Tarrant</name>	Tarrant	Tarrant	"Do you mean to say that you don't intend to take a shovel, and lend a hand with this work? Your shoulder's not hurt so all-fired bad as that," said [MASK], the sailor who had before spoken.
<name>Clayton</name>	Clayton	Clayton	[MASK] was a generous and chivalrous man, but something in the girl's breathless defense of the forest man stirred him to unreasoning jealousy, so that for the instant he forgot all that they owed to this wild demi-god, and he answered her with a half sneer upon his lip.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Tarzan	He has gone back into his jungle and left me here alone." And then he remembered the look on [MASK]'s face when they had discovered that the cabin was empty--such a look as the hunter sees in the eyes of the wounded deer he has wantonly brought down.
<name>Long</name>	Long	D'Arnot	It had caused so much crime and suffering and sorrow that [MASK] thought it best not to attempt to bring the treasure itself on here, as had been my intention, so I have brought a letter of credit instead. "
<name>Shere Khan</name>	Shere Khan	Man	No longer was there safety for bird or beast. [MASK] had come. Other animals passed up and down the jungle by day and by night--fierce, cruel beasts--but their weaker neighbors only fled from their immediate vicinity to return again when the danger was past.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Tarzan	But his fangs never closed in that nut brown flesh. A muscular hand shot out and grasped the hairy throat, and another plunged a keen hunting knife a dozen times into the broad breast. Like lightning the blows fell, and only ceased when [MASK] felt the limp form crumple beneath him.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Kerchak	Much depended upon food supply, climatic conditions, and the prevalence of animals of the more dangerous species; though [MASK] often led them on long marches for no other reason than that he had tired of remaining in the same place.
<name>Darcy</name>	Darcy	Tarzan	She looked up at [MASK] to find him leaning toward her gazing on the miniatures with an expression of astonishment. He reached out his hand for the locket and took it away from her, examining the likenesses within with unmistakable signs of surprise and new interest.
<name>Kerchak</name>	Kerchak	Kerchak	The sight that met his eyes must have frozen him with horror, for there, within the door, stood three great bull apes, while behind them crowded many more; how many he never knew, for his revolvers were hanging on the far wall beside his rifle, and [MASK] was charging.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Tarzan	Not so, however, with [MASK], the man-child. His life amidst the dangers of the jungle had taught him to meet emergencies with self-confidence, and his higher intelligence resulted in a quickness of mental action far beyond the powers of the apes.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Jane	[MASK] would have begged for a further reprieve, had it not been that she too had begun to believe that her forest lover would return no more. In spite of herself she began to entertain doubts and fears. The reasonableness of the arguments of these disinterested French officers commenced to convince her against her will.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	D'Arnot	[MASK] shook his head. He was unconvinced, and in his mind had sprung the determination to prove the correctness of his theory, for he had discovered the key which alone could unlock the mystery, or consign it forever to the realms of the unfathomable.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Tarzan	The greater strength of the ape was slowly prevailing, and the teeth of the straining beast were scarce an inch from [MASK]'s throat when, with a shuddering tremor, the great body stiffened for an instant and then sank limply to the ground.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Tarzan	For a moment the two eyed each other in silence, and then the great cat turned into the jungle, which swallowed her as the ocean engulfs a tossed pebble. But into the mind of [MASK] a great plan sprang.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	D'Arnot	This is the first time I have spoken with another of my kind through written words. [MASK] was mystified. It seemed incredible that there lived upon earth a full-grown man who had never spoken with a fellow man, and still more preposterous that such a one could read and write.
<name>Clayton</name>	Clayton	Clayton	His tones were no longer those of the erudite pedant theorizing upon the abstract and the unknowable; but those of the man of action--determined, but tinged also by a note of indescribable hopelessness and grief which wrung an answering pang from [MASK]'s heart.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Tarzan	[MASK], an interested spectator of all that had taken place, sat speculating on the strange actions of these peculiar creatures. Men were indeed more foolish and more cruel than the beasts of the jungle! How fortunate was he who lived in the peace and security of the great forest!
<name>Sabor</name>	Sabor	Sabor	[MASK], the huge lioness--lashing her tail. Cautiously she moved a great padded paw forward, noiselessly placing it before she lifted the next. Thus she advanced; her belly low, almost touching the surface of the ground--a great cat preparing to spring upon its prey.
<name>Van Helsing</name>	Van Helsing	Jane	I shall see them in the dark forever--the eyes that you see, and those that you don't see, but feel--ah, they are the worst." All were silent for a moment, and then [MASK] spoke. "
<name>He</name>	He	Tarzan	In it he found a faded photograph of a smooth faced young man, a golden locket studded with diamonds, linked to a small gold chain, a few letters and a small book. [MASK] examined these all minutely.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Tarzan	well, for time and again the ferocious brute had established his claim to physical supremacy over the few bull apes who had dared resent his savage bullying. [MASK] would have liked to subdue the ugly beast without recourse to knife or arrows.
<name>John</name>	John	Clayton	[MASK] had wanted to leave as soon as the plan was announced, but the girl's tired, hopeless look kept him. He could not desert her. Something might happen yet, he tried to console himself by thinking.
<name>Emmeline</name>	Emmeline	Esmeralda	"For the good Lord's sake, ain't I dead?" The two turned to see [MASK] sitting upright upon the floor, her great eyes rolling from side to side as though she could not believe their testimony as to her whereabouts.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Tarzan	I shall leave the decision to you, for you know best what will be for your eventual welfare." "I cannot tell him, [MASK]," she said. "He too, loves me, and he is a good man.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	D'Arnot	Immediately after him came a white body, but this one alighted erect. [MASK] saw a clean-limbed young giant emerge from the shadows into the firelight and come quickly toward him. What could it mean? Who could it be? Some new creature of torture and destruction, doubtless.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Tarzan	[MASK] took to the trees in pursuit, and in a few moments came in view of the men desperately striving to escape. There were three of them, and they were racing madly in single file through the dense undergrowth.
<name>Kala</name>	Kala	Kulonga	He proceeded with unwonted stealth, for [MASK] had taught him great respect for the little sharp splinters of wood which dealt death so swiftly and unerringly. At length he came to a great tree, heavy laden with thick foliage and loaded with pendant loops of giant creepers.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Jane	As his arms and legs had been extended stiffly upward as he came to earth upon his back the attitude of death was anything but impressive. [MASK] had been watching his antics in mild-eyed surprise. Now she laughed--a little choking gurgle of a laugh; but it was enough.
<name>John</name>	John	Canler	Early the next morning [MASK] set out for town. In the east smoke could be seen lying low over the forest, for a fire had been raging for a week not far from them, but the wind still lay in the west and no danger threatened them.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Tarzan	What was that?" suddenly cried one of the party, an Englishman, as [MASK]'s savage cry came faintly to their ears. "I heard the same thing once before," said a Belgian, "when I was in the gorilla country.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	D'Arnot	They questioned the prisoners by signs, and finally one of the sailors who had served in the French Congo found that he could make them understand the bastard tongue that passes for language between the whites and the more degraded tribes of the coast, but even then they could learn nothing definite regarding the fate of [MASK].
<name>Martin</name>	Martin	Tarzan	So limited was their vocabulary that [MASK] could not even talk with them of the many new truths, and the great fields of thought that his reading had opened up before his longing eyes, or make known ambitions which stirred his soul.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Jane	But [MASK] did not once lose consciousness. It is true that that awful face, pressing close to hers, and the stench of the foul breath beating upon her nostrils, paralyzed her with terror; but her brain was clear, and she comprehended all that transpired.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Canler	I don't care for any fuss or feathers, and I'm sure you don't either." The girl turned cold, but she held her head bravely. "Your father wishes it, you know," added [MASK]. "Yes, I know."
<name>He</name>	He	Clayton	The girl did not answer, but she felt her heart shrivel within her. She knew that [MASK] spoke merely what he thought, and for the first time she began to analyze the structure which supported her newfound love, and to subject its object to a critical examination.
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Monsieur	I only grieve that I could not have died for him, or at least with him. I wish that you could have known him better, [MASK]. He was indeed an officer and a gentleman--a title conferred on many, but deserved by so few.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Tarzan	She realized that it was because she had forgotten the fear that prompted her to accept it. Motioning her to follow, [MASK] walked toward the trees at the edge of the arena, and taking her in one strong arm swung to the branches above.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Clayton	From one lofty branch the agile creature swung with [MASK] through a dizzy arc to a neighboring tree; then for a hundred yards maybe the sure feet threaded a maze of interwoven limbs, balancing like a tightrope walker high above the black depths of verdure beneath.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Tarzan	I will have my hands full keeping your neck from beneath the guillotine." [MASK] lowered his bow and smiled. "I do not know why I should kill the blacks back there in my jungle, yet not kill them here.
<name>Kaa</name>	Kaa	Sabor	Her meat lay before her, and [MASK] had only to worm her way through the lattice to claim it. Slowly she forced her great bulk, inch by inch, through the opening. Now her head was through, now one great forearm and shoulder.
<name>Clayton</name>	Clayton	Clayton	Over the brute's shoulder [MASK] could see the doorway of his cabin, not twenty paces distant, and a great wave of horror and fear swept over him as he saw his young wife emerge, armed with one of his rifles.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Tarzan	During this period [MASK] paid many nocturnal visits to the village, where he often renewed his supply of arrows. He soon noticed the food always standing at the foot of the tree which was his avenue into the palisade, and after a little, he commenced to eat whatever the blacks put there.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Tarzan	[MASK] shook his head and taking the bark, wrote: I had thought of that--the first day; but I dared not. The great apes come often to this spot, and if they found you here, wounded and alone, they would kill you.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Tarzan	[MASK] coiled his rope. Then there rose suddenly above the fiendish cries of the dancing demons the awful challenge of the ape-man. The dancers halted as though turned to stone. The rope sped with singing whir high above the heads of the blacks.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Kulonga	When [MASK] awoke he found that his bow and arrows had disappeared. The black warrior was furious and frightened, but more frightened than furious. He searched the ground below the tree, and he searched the tree above the ground; but there was no sign of either bow or arrows or of the nocturnal marauder.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Tarzan	On the day that [MASK] established his right to respect, the tribe was gathered about a small natural amphitheater which the jungle had left free from its entangling vines and creepers in a hollow among some low hills. The open space was almost circular in shape.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Tarzan	And yet with all his seeming speed, [MASK] was in reality feeling his way with comparative slowness, searching constantly for limbs of adequate strength for the maintenance of this double weight. Presently they came to the clearing before the beach.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Tarzan	No one was in sight. His eyes rested upon the open doorway of a nearby hut. He would take a look within, thought [MASK], and so, cautiously, he approached the low thatched building. For a moment he stood without, listening intently.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Jane	The girl hesitated. The room was tense with the silence of taut nerves. All eyes turned toward [MASK], awaiting her reply. "Can't we wait a few days?" she asked. "I am all unstrung. I have been through so much today."
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Tarzan	By constant playing and experimenting with these he learned to tie rude knots, and make sliding nooses; and with these he and the younger apes amused themselves. What [MASK] did they tried to do also, but he alone originated and became proficient.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Clayton	The revolver exploded harmlessly in the air, and the seaman crumpled up with a scream of pain and terror. [MASK] turned and rushed back toward the scene. The sailors stood in a frightened group, with drawn weapons, peering into the jungle.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	D'Arnot	[MASK] turned back to the window, and presently the police officer spoke. "Gentlemen," he said. Both turned toward him. "There is evidently a great deal at stake which must hinge to a greater or lesser extent upon the absolute correctness of this comparison.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Tarzan	Once every moon [MASK] would go swinging rapidly back through the swaying branches to have a day with his books, and to replenish his supply of arrows. This latter task was becoming more and more difficult, for the blacks had taken to hiding their supply away at night in granaries and living huts.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Tarzan	She pointed to it now, and [MASK] removed it and handed the pretty bauble to her. She saw that it was the work of a skilled artisan and that the diamonds were of great brilliancy and superbly set, but the cutting of them denoted that they were of a former day.
<name>Clayton</name>	Clayton	Tarzan	The photograph only served to puzzle the girl still more, for it was evidently another likeness of the same man whose picture rested in the locket beside that of the beautiful young woman. [MASK] was looking at her with an expression of puzzled bewilderment in his eyes as she glanced up at him.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Tarzan	[MASK] pointed toward the sounds, touched his breast and pointed again. She understood. He was going, and something told her that it was because he thought her people were in danger. Again he kissed her. "Come back to me," she whispered.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Clayton	As [MASK] turned his eyes in the direction she indicated, he saw silhouetted dimly against the shadows beyond, a great figure standing upright upon the ridge. For a moment it stood as though listening and then turned slowly, and melted into the shadows of the jungle.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Tarzan	But scarcely were the words out of his mouth ere he, too, had been seized and securely bound by the neck with the same rope. Then [MASK] set off toward the north, leading the now thoroughly frightened professor and his secretary.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Tarzan	"Here is a good place," said the rat-faced sailor, indicating a spot beneath [MASK]'s tree. "It is as good as any," replied one of his companions. "If they catch us with the treasure aboard it will all be confiscated anyway.
<name>Diana</name>	Diana	Jane	His heart was filled with happiness. The woman he loved was safe. He wondered by what manner of miracle she had been spared. To see her alive seemed almost unbelievable. As he approached the cabin he saw [MASK] coming out. When she saw him
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Tarzan	In them, too, was greed for the toothsome dainty the boy carried. But [MASK] saw his arch enemy as quickly, and divining what the great beast would do he leaped nimbly away toward the females and the young, hoping to hide himself among them.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	D'Arnot	The blacks, their eyes protruding in horror, watched spellbound. Once beneath the trees, the body rose straight into the air, and as it disappeared into the foliage above, the terrified negroes, screaming with fright, broke into a mad race for the village gate. [MASK] was left alone.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Clayton	As it was now pitch dark within their tiny aerie they lay down upon their blankets to try to gain, through sleep, a brief respite of forgetfulness. [MASK] lay facing the opening at the front, a rifle and a brace of revolvers at his hand.
<name>Kerchak</name>	Kerchak	Kerchak	The other males scattered in all directions, but not before the infuriated brute had felt the vertebra of one snap between his great, foaming jaws. A luckless young female slipped from an insecure hold upon a high branch and came crashing to the ground almost at [MASK]'s feet.
<name>Rosa</name>	Rosa	Tarzan	Of medicine or surgery the poor thing knew nothing. She could but lick the wounds, and thus she kept them cleansed, that healing nature might the more quickly do her work. At first [MASK] would eat nothing, but rolled and tossed in a wild delirium of fever.
<name>Shere Khan</name>	Shere Khan	Terkoz	In ten days he was quite sound again, except for a terrible, half-healed scar, which, starting above his left eye ran across the top of his head, ending at the right ear. It was the mark left by [MASK] when he had torn the scalp away.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jane	Again they were silent for a time. "[MASK]," said the man, at length, "if you were free, would you marry me?" She did not reply at once, but he waited patiently. The girl was trying to collect her thoughts.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Tarzan	He was now swimming parallel to the bank and there he saw the cruel beast that would have seized him crouching upon the still form of his little playmate. The lioness was intently watching [MASK], evidently expecting him to return to shore, but this the boy had no intention of doing.
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Clayton	The girl, standing pale and rigid against the farther wall, sought with ever-increasing terror for some loophole of escape. Suddenly her hand, tight-pressed against her bosom, felt the hard outline of the revolver that [MASK] had left with her earlier in the day.
