<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Anne	The unusual thing, a native New Yorker, she was also a person of distinction, financially independent, well connected and much sought after. And she was interesting, an odd confusion of wit and intense earnestness; a vivid and remarkable person. Yes, undoubtedly, [MASK] was almost too good to be true.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Anne	An idiotic impulse seized her to leave the place, [MASK]’s presence, then, forever. But of course she couldn’t. It would be foolish, and so ugly. “And the white men dance with the colored women.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Helga	He stopped, contemplating her, lost apparently, for the second, in pleasant thoughts of the future. To [MASK] he seemed to be the most distant, the most unreal figure in the world. She suppressed a ridiculous impulse to laugh. The effort sobered her.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Helga	He forgot to be embarrassed. “But [MASK]! Good heavens! Don’t you see that if we—I mean people like us—don’t have children, the others will still have. That’s one of the things that’s the matter with us.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Quantities	“Well, then, they can’t be so bad. I mean, if your friends sometimes go, can they? Just what goes on that’s so terrible?” ‘Why, they drink, for one thing. [MASK], they say.”
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Helga	“Oh, I’ll come to see you all right. I’ve got several things that I want to talk to you about and one thing especially.” “Don’t,” [MASK] mocked, “tell me you’re going to ask me again to marry you.”
<name>her</name>	her	God”—what	She was charmed by it. To be mistress in one’s own house, to have a garden, and chickens, and a pig; to have a husband—and to be “right with [MASK] pleasure did that other world which she had left contain that could surpass these?
<name>the visiting girl</name>	the visiting girl	Helga	I’m not going to be there at all.” The visiting girl, standing in relief, like old walnut against the buff-colored wall, darted a quick glance at [MASK]. Plainly she was curious. But she only said formally: “Oh, then you are sick.”
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Helga	But in the winter there was skating, solitary, or in gay groups. [MASK] liked this sport, though she was not very good at it. There were, however, always plenty of efficient and willing men to instruct and to guide her over the glittering ice.
<name>Tess</name>	Tess	Helga	Diffidently she approached the desk. The darker of the two looked up and turned on a little smile. “Yes?” she inquired. “I wonder if you can help me? I want work,” [MASK] stated simply. “Maybe. What land?
<name>she</name>	she	Helga	After a slight breakfast she made her way to the library, that ugly gray building, where was housed much knowledge and a little wisdom, on interminable shelves. The friendly person at the desk in the hall bestowed on her a kindly smile when [MASK] stated her business and asked for directions.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Anne	Characteristically she writhed at the idea of telling [MASK] of her impending departure and shirked the problem of evolving a plausible and inoffensive excuse for its suddenness. “That,” she decided lazily, “will have to look out for itself; I can’t be bothered just now.
<name>Lolita</name>	Lolita	Helga	But she was apprehensive. Gradually, as the ship drew into the lazier waters of the dock, she became prey to sinister fears and memories. A deep pang of misgiving nauseated her at the thought of her aunt’s husband, acquired since [MASK]’s childhood visit.
<name>Bertha</name>	Bertha	Helga	Alarmed for the fraction of a second, involuntarily [MASK] had shrunk from her grasp, wriggling out of the wet coat when she could not loosen the crazed creature’s hold. At the sight of the bare arms and neck growing out of the clinging red dress, a shudder shook the swaying man at her right.
<name>Zora</name>	Zora	Helga	One of the loveliest sights [MASK] had ever seen had been a sooty black girl decked out in a flaming orange dress, which a horri- fied matron had next day consigned to the dyer. Why, she wondered, didn’t someone write A Plea for Color?
<name>Babbitt</name>	Babbitt	Helga	She exclaimed, aloud. “I’ll go straight back.” But, though the day was still drear, rain had ceased to fall, and [MASK], instead of returning, spent hours in aimless strolling about the hustling streets of the Loop district.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Helga	Jes’ make de bes’ of et, honey. Jes’ make de bes’ yuh can.” [MASK] sighed, turning her nose away from the steaming coffee which her hostess had placed for her and against which her squeamish stomach was about to revolt.
<name>She</name>	She	Helga	She was mystified too. Her aunt’s words came back to her. “You’re young and a foreigner and—and different.” Just what did that mean, she wondered. Did it mean that the difference was to be stressed, accented? [MASK] wasn’t
<name>Benny</name>	Benny	Helga	For the while, [MASK] was oblivious of the reek of flesh, smoke, and alcohol, oblivious of the oblivion of other gyrating pairs, oblivious of the color, the noise, and the grand distorted childishness of it all.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Helga	During the long process of getting well, between the dreamy intervals when she was beset by the insistent craving for sleep, [MASK] had had too much time to think. At first she had felt only an astonished anger at the quagmire in which she had engulfed herself.
<name>Sam Spade</name>	Sam Spade	Helga	The short dark hair was brushed severely back from the wide forehead. The extreme decollete of her simple apricot dress showed a skin of unusual color, a dehcate, creamy hue, with golden tones. “Almost like an alabaster,” thought [MASK]. Bang!
<name>Irene</name>	Irene	Helga	Leaning against the railing, [MASK] stared into the approaching night, glad to be at last alone, free of that great superfluity of human beings, yellow, brown, and black, which, as the torrid summer burnt to its close, had so oppressed her.
<name>Mr. Harrison</name>	Mr. Harrison	Anne	Far into the night she lay planning speeches for their next meeting, so that it was long before drowsiness advanced upon her. When he did call, Sunday, three days later, she put him off on [MASK] and went out, pleading an engagement, which until then she had not meant to keep.
<name>Miss Caroline</name>	Miss Caroline	Helgas	“And just what do you think it is?” “I’m afraid it’s hard to explain, but I suppose it’s just that we like to be together. I simply can’t imagine living forever away from colored people.” A suspicion of a frown drew [MASK] brows.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Helga	Her husband was still, as he had always been, deferentially kind and incredulously proud of her—and verbally encouraging. [MASK] tried not to see that he had rather lost any personal interest in her, except for the short spaces between the times when she was preparing for or recovering from childbirth.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Margaret	Then quickly in another, warmer tone: “I do mean it. Thanks, a thousand times, [MASK]. I’m really awfully grateful, but—you see, it’s like this, I’m not going to be late to my class.
<name>the protagonist</name>	the protagonist	Helga	Some were plainly uninterested, others wore an air of acute expectancy, which disturbed [MASK]. Behind a desk two alert young women, both wearing a superior air, were busy writing upon and filing countless white cards. Now and then one stopped to answer the telephone.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Margaret	Slowly it crept across the room, wiping out in its path the morning shadows. She wasn’t interested in what the other was saying. “If you don’t hurry, you’ll be late to your first class. Can I help you?” [MASK] offered uncertainly.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	James	It even accounted for her engagement to [MASK]. Negro society, she had learned, was as complicated and as rigid in its ramifications as the highest strata of white society. If you couldn’t prove your ancestry and connections, you were tolerated, but you didn’t “belong.”
<name>Holly</name>	Holly	Curious	She had only smiled, a faint provocative smile, and pressed her fingers deep into his arms until a wild look had come into his slightly bloodshot eyes. The next morning she lay for a long while, scarcely breathing, while she reviewed the happenings of the night before. [MASK].
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Helga	“It’s time,” she said, “for your evening treatment, and then you’ve got to try to sleep for a while. No more visitors tonight.” [MASK] nodded and tried unsuccessfully to make a little smile.
<name>Miss Wonderly</name>	Miss Wonderly	Audrey	The dear baby. I was going to introduce him to [MASK] and tell her to do a good job of vamping on him as soon as I could remember the darlings name, or when it got noisy enough so he wouldn’t hear what I called him.
<name>she</name>	she	Helga	It—well, frankly, it isn’t convenient. I’m sure an intelligent girl like yourself can understand that.” “Of course,” [MASK] agreed, coldly, freezingly, but her lips quivered. She wanted to get away as quickly as possible.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Helga	Too, they felt that the colors were queer; dark purples, royal blues, rich greens, deep reds, in soft, luxurious woolens, or heavy, clinging silks. And the trimmings—when [MASK] used them at all—seemed to them odd.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Anne	Life became for her only a hateful place where one lived in intimacy with people one would not have chosen had one been given choice. It was, too, an excruciating agony. She was continually out of temper: [MASK], thank the gods!
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Anderson	She still liked her in the same degree and in the same manner. She still felt slightly annoyed with her. She still did not envy her marriage with [MASK]. By some mysterious process the emotional upheaval which had racked her had left all the rocks of her existence unmoved.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Helga	[MASK] herself felt like nothing so much as some new and strange species of pet dog being proudly exhibited. Everyone was very polite and very friendly, but she felt the massed curiosity and interest, so discreetly hidden under the polite greetings. The very atmosphere was tense with it.
<name>Mildred</name>	Mildred	Helga	“References,” thought [MASK], resentfully, bitterly, as she went out the door into the crowded garish street in search of another agency, where her visit was equally vain. Days of this sort of thing. Weeks of it.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Money	[MASK]. Characteristically, while admitting its necessity, and even its undeniable desirability, she dismissed its importance. Its elusive quality she had as yet never known. She would find work of some kind. Perhaps the library. The idea clung. Yes, certainly the library.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Helga	A mordantly personal pride and sensitiveness deterred [MASK] from further efforts at incitation. True, he had made, one morning, while holding his brush poised for a last, a very last stroke on the portrait, one admirably draped suggestion, speaking seemingly to the pictured face.
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Helga	Not to you. Not to any white man. I don’t at all care to be owned. Even by you.” The drooping lids lifted. The look in the blue eyes was, [MASK] thought, like the surprised stare of a puzzled baby.
<name>Miss Emily</name>	Miss Emily	Helga	At twelve those children who by some accident had been a little minute or two late would have their first meal after five hours of work and so-called education. Discipline, it was called. There came a light knocking on her door. “Come in,” invited [MASK] unenthusiastically.
<name>Briony</name>	Briony	Helga	“I want very much to see you, [MASK]. Alone.” She held herself tensely on the edge of her chair, and suggested: “Tomorrow?” He hesitated a second and then said quickly: “Why, yes, that’s all right.”
<name>migraine</name>	migraine	Helga	This was a disease from which [MASK] had suffered at intervals all her life, and it was a point of honor, almost, with her never to give way to it. So, instead of turning away, as she felt inclined, she walked on, outwardly indifferent.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name in the context provided)	someone (There is no proper name in the context provided)	Anne	She mastered it and ignored [MASK]’s inadequate answer. “It’s the principle of the thing that I object to. You can’t get round the fact that her behavior is outrageous, treacherous, in fact. That’s what’s the matter with the Negro race.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Anne	[MASK] giggled, the others smiled and openly exchanged knowing glances, and under the tables flat glass bottles were extracted from the women’s evening scarfs and small silver flasks drawn from the men’s hip pockets. In a little moment she grew accustomed to the smoke and din.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Helga	Knowing, as she did, nothing of this, [MASK] was unperturbed. But even had she known, she would not have been disheartened. The fact that it was difficult but increased her eagerness, and made the doing of it seem only the more worth while.
<name>oh</name>	oh	Helen	“Where, [MASK], did you get him?” “Oh, that? That’s something the cat brought in. Don’t ask which one. He came with somebody, I don’t remember who. I think he’s shocked to death.
<name>James</name>	James	Helga	“Yes, Aunt.” [MASK] was cross, and trying not to show it. “He’s coming?” “Yes, Aunt,” with precise politeness. “What about him?’ “I don’t know. What about him?”
<name>Mr. Brocklehurst</name>	Mr. Brocklehurst	Helga	She could no longer abide being connected with a place of shame, lies, hypocrisy, cruelty, servility, and snobbishness. “It ought,” she concluded, “to be shut down by law.” “But, [MASK], you can’t go now.
<name>Miss Jessel</name>	Miss Jessel	Helga	Ta-ta.” The door slid to behind her. But in another moment it opened. She was back. “I do wish you’d stay. It’s nice having you here, [MASK]. We all think so. Even the dead ones.
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Helga	Very lightly. [MASK] Crane didn’t immediately reply. There was, she knew, so much reason—from one viewpoint—in her aunt’s statement. She could only acknowledge it. “I know that,” she told her finally.
<name>he</name>	he	Anne	And it was more amusing too. Perhaps because it was somehow a bit more dangerous. In the midst of curious speculation as to the possible identity of the other guests, with an indefinite sense of annoyance she wondered if [MASK] would be there.
<name>Macy's</name>	Macy's	Garborg	But a little frown appeared over the fierce mustache, as he said, in his precise, faintly feminine voice: "She ought to have earrings, long ones. Is it too late for [MASK]’s? We could call up.” And call up they did.
<name>had</name>	had	Naxos	She would even have welcomed snow, for it would more clearly have marked the contrast between this freedom and the cage which [MASK] had been to her. Not but what it was marked plainly enough by the noise, the dash, the crowds.
<name>Aunt Jemima</name>	Aunt Jemima	Helga	Jes’ put yo’ trus’ in de Sabioah.” Looking at the confident face of the little bronze figure on the opposite side of the immaculately spread table, [MASK] had a sensation of shame that she should be less than content.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Helga	The weakness had passed as suddenly as it had come. Silently they had walked on. And gradually [MASK] had recalled that the man beside her had himself swayed slightly at their close encounter, and that frantically for a fleeting moment he had gripped at a protruding fence railing.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Helga	To his words, once she had caught their content and recovered from her surprise, [MASK] paid not much attention. They would, she knew, be absolutely appropriate ones, and they didn’t at all matter. They meant nothing to her—now.
<name>she</name>	she	tonight!—and	How good, she thought, to go now, [MASK] frowned to remember how impossible that would be. “The dignitaries,” she said, “are not in their offices, and there will be yards and yards of red tape to unwind, gigantic, impressive spools of it.”
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Helga	After this had been repeated twice in a booming, oratorical voice, [MASK] felt that the Association secretaries had taken an awful chance in sending a person about whom they knew as little as they did about her. "Yes, I’m sure you’ll do.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Helga	In bed she could think, could have a certain amount of quiet. Of alone-ness. In that period of racking pain and calamitous fright [MASK] had learned what passion and credulity could do to one. In her was bom angry bitterness and an enormous disgust.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Helga	It would be, she remarked with a return of her outward casualness, by far the best of all possibilities. Particularly desirable. She touched [MASK]’s hand with her fingers in a little affectionate gesture. Very lightly.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Grieved	She had made it impossible for herself ever again to appeal to him. Instinctively she had the knowledge that he would be shocked. [MASK]. Horribly hurt even. Well, let him! The need to hurry suddenly obsessed her. She must. The morning was almost gone.
<name>Tom's</name>	Tom's	Helgas	No indeed! Why, that, that would make me your aunt! He’s not—” But at last the knob had turned in [MASK] fumbling hand. She gave a little unpremeditated laugh and slipped out. When she was in the street, she ran.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Helga	“Thanks awfully,” [MASK] responded, indifferently. She was watching the sunlight dissolve from thick orange into pale yellow. Slowly it crept across the room, wiping out in its path the morning shadows. She wasn’t interested in what the other was saying.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Helga	A cruel sacrifice. In forgetting all but love she had forgotten, or had perhaps never known, that some things the world never forgives. But as [MASK] knew, she had remembered, or had learned in suffering and longing all the rest of her life.
<name>The man</name>	The man	Helga	His eyes still avoided the girl in the high-backed chair before him. [MASK] felt a shiver of compunction. For an instant she regretted that she had not been a little kinder. But wasn’t it after all the greatest kindness to be cruel?
<name>Miss Golightly</name>	Miss Golightly	Helga	About [MASK] there sputtered a little staccato murmur of manufactured conversation. Meanwhile she could think of no proper word of greeting to the outrageous man before her. She wanted, very badly, to laugh. But the man was as unaware of her omission as of her desire.
<name>statement</name>	statement	Helga	With this [MASK] was in full agreement. It seemed hundreds of years since she had been strong. And she would need strength. For in some way she was determined to get herself out of this bog into which she had strayed. Or—she would have to die.
<name>Mrs. Joad</name>	Mrs. Joad	Sary	[MASK], who in all likelihood had toiled every day of her life since early childhood except on those days, totalling perhaps sixty, following the birth of her six children. And who by dint of superhuman saving had somehow succeeded in feeding and clothing them and sending them all to school.
<name>Miss Maudie</name>	Miss Maudie	Helga	Her direct, penetrating gaze was somewhat formidable. Notebook in hand, she gave [MASK] the impression of having risen early for consultation with other harassed authorities on the race problem, and having been in conference on the subject all day.
<name>Evelyn</name>	Evelyn	Helga	He smiled, approvingly. “Oh,” said [MASK] again. Then at last she laughed. It was too funny. The great man hadn’t addressed a word to her. Here she was, a curiosity, a stunt, at which people came and gazed.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Helga	TWENTY-THREE After the first exciting months [MASK] was too driven, too occupied, and too sick to carry out any of the things for which she had made such enthusiastic plans, or even to care that she had made only slight progress toward their accomplishment.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Helga	And all the other houses and cabins shared in this illumination. And the people. The dark undecorated women unceasingly concerned with the actual business of life, its rounds of births and christenings, of loves and marriages, of deaths and funerals, were to [MASK] miraculously beautiful.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Helga	Not only were earrings bought, long ones brightly enameled, but glittering shoe-buck- les and two great bracelets. [MASK]’s sleeves being long, she escaped the bracelets for the moment. They were wrapped to be worn that night.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Helga	If only so that she might rise up and escape from the tumult, the heat, and the smell. [MASK], however, was unconcerned, undisturbed by the commotion about her. It was all part of the general unreality. Nothing reached her.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Helga	Selfish. “Try, [MASK], to control yourself,” he had urged gently. He detested tears. “If it distresses you so, we won’t talk of it again. You, of course, must do as you yourself wish. Both your aunt
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Helga	And [MASK], for some idiotic reason connected with race, had refused him. Certainly there was no use in thinking, even, of the others. If she had refused him, she would refuse any and all for the same reason.
<name>Mr. Brown</name>	Mr. Brown	Anne	When you’ve lived as long as I have, you’ll know that what others don’t know can’t hurt you. I’ll just tell [MASK] that you’re a friend of mine whose mother’s dead. That’ll place you well enough and it’s all true.
<name>Brett</name>	Brett	Helga	He turned a little away from her, his face white but composed, and looked down into the gathering shadows in the little park before the house. At last he spoke, in a queer frozen voice: “You refuse me?” “Yes,” [MASK] repeated with intentional carelessness.
<name>Brett</name>	Brett	Helga	The day was hot, her breasts were covered only by a nightgown of filmy crepe, a relic of prematrimonial days, which had slipped from one carved shoulder. He flinched. [MASK]’s petulant lip curled, for she well knew that this fresh reminder of her desirability was like the flick of a whip.
<name>Bertha</name>	Bertha	Helga	I didn’t want to bring over too much that might be useless.” “And you were quite right too. Umm. Let’s see. That black there, the one with the cerise and purple trimmings. Wear that.” [MASK] was shocked.
<name>She</name>	She	Helga	The last good-byes were said. [MASK] began to regret that she was leaving. Why couldn’t she have two lives, or why couldn’t she be satisfied in one place? Now that she was actually off, she felt heavy at heart.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Helga	[MASK], looking up from a last reading of the speeches, was aware that she was being studied. Her employer sat leaning back, the tips of her fingers pressed together, her head a bit on one side, her small inquisitive eyes boring into the girl before her.
<name>She</name>	She	Helga	The man laughed too. But they couldn’t talk yet. People kept breaking in on them. At last, however, they were at the door, and then he suggested that they share a taxi “for the sake of a little breeze.” [MASK] assented.
<name>Lord</name>	Lord	Mastah	At this the short brown man on the platform raised a placating hand and sanctimoniously delivered himself of the words: “Remembah de words of our [MASK]: ‘Let him that is without sin cast de first stone.’ Let us pray for our errin’ sistah.”
<name>her</name>	her	Anne	And through [MASK] it had been possible for her to meet and to know people with tastes and ideas similar to her own. Their sophisticated cynical talk, their elaborate parties, the unobtrusive correctness of their clothes and homes, all appealed to her craving for smartness, for enjoyment.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Helga	And night! Night, when a languid moon peeped through the wide-opened windows of her little house, a little mockingly, it may be. Always at nights approach [MASK] was bewildered by a disturbing medley of feelings. Challenge. Anticipation. And a small fear.
<name>Reed</name>	Reed	Katrina	She had been only eight, yet she had enjoyed the interest and the admiration which her unfamiliar color and dark curly hair, strange to those pink, white, and gold people, had evoked. Quite clearly now she recalled that her Aunt [MASK] had begged for her to be allowed to remain.
<name>her husband</name>	her husband	Anne	She refused to go on to another gathering. It would, she thought, be simply the same old thing. On her arrival home she was more disappointed than she cared to admit to find the house in darkness and even [MASK] gone off somewhere.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Helga	I should say you can’t have pie. It’s too indigestible. Maybe when you’re better—” “That,” assented [MASK], “is what I said. Pie—by and by. That’s the trouble.” The nurse looked concerned.
<name>Mr. Gutenberg</name>	Mr. Gutenberg	Olsen	They had not so much expected as hoped that she would bring down [MASK], and so secure the link between the merely fashionable set to which they belonged and the artistic one after which they hankered. It was of course true that there were others, plenty of them.
<name>be</name>	be	Helga	I may need you. Something may turn up.” It was one of those vicious mornings, windy and bright. There seemed to [MASK], as they emerged from the depths of the vast station, to be a whirling malice in the sharp air of this shining city.
<name>Mammy</name>	Mammy	chile	That can’t be natural.” “Laws, [MASK], we’s all tied. An’ Ah reckons we’s all gwine a be tied till kingdom come. Jes’ make de bes’ of et, honey. Jes’ make de bes’ yuh can.”
<name>She</name>	She	Helga	And now she had forfeited it forever. Forever. [MASK] had an instantaneous shocking perception of what forever meant. And then, like a flash, it was gone, leaving an endless stretch of dreary years before her appalled vision. TWENTY The day was a rainy one.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Helga	Their house was large and comfortable, the food and music always of the best, and the type of entertainment always unexpected and brilliant. The drinks, too, were sure to be safe. And [MASK], since her return, was more than ever popular at parties.
<name>Serena</name>	Serena	Helga	And where, as the wife of the preacher, she was a person of relative importance. Only relative. [MASK] did not hate him, the town, or the people. No. Not for a long time. As always, at first the novelty of the thing, the change, fascinated her.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Anne	“Oh, come, [MASK], you haven’t been to any of the parties, I know, so how can you be so positive about the matter?” “No, but I’ve heard about them. I know people who’ve been.”
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Helga	Marriage. This sacred thing of which parsons and other Christian folk ranted so sanctimoniously, how immoral—according to their own standards—it could be! But [MASK] felt also a modicum of pity for him, as for one already abandoned. She meant to leave him.
<name>God</name>	God	Helga	There were things that more than outweighed these. In the certainty of his goodness, his righteousness, his holiness, [MASK] somehow overcame her first disgust at the odor of sweat and stale garments. She was even able to be unaware of it.
