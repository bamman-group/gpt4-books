<name>Waldo</name>	Waldo	Thursby	That it?” “S-something like that.” “And when you found that [MASK] didn’t mean to tackle him you borrowed the gun and did it yourself. Right?” “Yes—though not exactly.” “But exact enough.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Wonderly	“I did.” “You’re an invaluable angel. How’s your woman’s intuition today?” “Why?” “What do you think of [MASK]?” “I’m for her,” the girl replied without hesitation.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Spade	[MASK] filled his own glass, drank, set the empty glass on the table, and returned to his bedside-seat. “I know where I stand now,” he said, looking with friendly eyes from one of the police-detectives to the other.
<name>Clarence</name>	Clarence	Spade	[MASK] stared at her with bulging eyes. His bony jaw fell down. He took his arms from her and stepped back out of her arms. He scowled at her and cleared his throat. She held her arms up as he had left them.
<name>blanket</name>	blanket	Spade	“Oh, you frightened me!” The bedroom-door he had shut was open. The girl sat on the side of the bed, trembling, with her right hand out of sight under a [MASK] put his packages on the kitchen-table and went into the bedroom.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Cairo	[MASK] said, “I see,” but there was something doubting in his smile. “Is he here?” “I don’t know.” She spoke impatiently. “What difference does it make?”
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Gutman	She had stopped trembling, had stopped panting. The appearance of [MASK] and his companions seemed to have robbed her of that freedom of personal movement and emotion that is animal, leaving her alive, conscious, but quiescent as a plant.
<name>Stanton</name>	Stanton	Spade	When he withdrew the hand presently it came out smeared with blood. The sight of his bloody hand brought not the least nor briefest of changes to [MASK]’s face. Holding that hand up where it would touch nothing, he took his lighter out of his pocket with his other hand.
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Gutman	[MASK] smiled with approval. “Trust you for that, sir,” he said. “Well now, sir, before we sit down to talk prices, answer me this: how soon can you—or how soon are you willing to—produce the falcon?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Thursby	He’d’ve looked you up and down and licked his lips and gone grinning from ear to ear—and then you could’ve stood as close to him as you liked in the dark and put a hole through him with the gun you had got from [MASK] that evening.”
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Cairo	[MASK] hastily picked up his pistol from the table beside him. He held it tight in his lap with both hands. Its muzzle pointed at the floor a little to one side of the sofa. His face had become yellowish again. His black eyes darted their gaze from face to face.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Gutman	Coming in? Or getting out?” Though [MASK]’s smile was a bit sad, even wistful in its way, he nodded his head. “I don’t like it either,” he told the Levantine, “but we can’t help ourselves now.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Iva	He said, “Thanks, honey,” put an arm around her slim waist, and rested his cheek wearily against her hip, shutting his eyes. “Are you going to marry [MASK]?” she asked, looking down at his pale brown hair.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Spade	[MASK] laughed a harsh syllable, “Ha!” and went to the buff-curtained window. He stood there with his back to her looking through the curtain into the court until she started towards him. Then he turned quickly and went to his desk.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Spade	The fat man chuckled. “I palmed it?” “Yes,” [MASK] said, jingling the pistols in his hand. “Do you want to say so or do you waijj-to stand for a frisk?” “Stand for—?”
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Gutman	Then he spoke, mimicking the fat man’s throaty purr: “Well, sir, I must say you’re a swell lot of thieves!” [MASK] chuckled. “We’ve little enough to boast about, and that’s a fact, sir,” he said.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Spade	What I had in mind was that it would be best for all concerned if we did not get out of each other’s sight until our business has been transacted.” He looked at the sofa and at [MASK] again, sharply. “You have the envelope?”
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Archer	She looked up at him, surprised. “Yes, certainly,” she said. “He had a Luger in a shoulder-holster. [MASK] wasn’t shot with a Luger.” “He had a revolver in his overcoat-pocket,” she said.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Spade	His mouth was open as when blood has spurted from it, but no more blood came from it, and all his long body was as still as the floor it lay on. [MASK] said: “Lock the door.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Spade	she said. “What time is it?” “Six o’clock. What are you doing here?” She shivered, drew [MASK]’s overcoat closer around her, and yawned. “You told me to stay till you got back or phoned.”
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Sam	He picked up his hat and put it on. He looked thoughtfully at the dead man and then around the room. “Hurry, [MASK],” the girl begged. “Sure,” he said absent-mindedly, “I’ll hurry.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Spade	“There’s nothing funny about it.” [MASK] did not seem offended by the fat man’s laughter, nor in any way impressed. He spoke in the manner of one reasoning with a recalcitrant, but not altogether unreasonable, friend. “It’s our best bet.
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	Gutman	I promise you nobody’ll do anything about it. That’s easy enough to fix.” The pink flesh on [MASK]’s forehead crawled in a frown. He lowered his head, mashing his chins together over his collar, and asked: “How?”
<name>Max</name>	Max	Dundy	“You’ll be hearing from [MASK] again. Stay dummied-up on him and you’ll be all right. Don’t worry about the story’s goofiness. A sensible one would’ve had us all in the cooler.” He rose to his feet.
<name>He</name>	He	Spade	The Captain hasn’t been back since. He didn’t keep a date he had this noon with some shipping-agents, and they haven’t found him to tell him about the fire.” “And the fire?” she asked. [MASK] shrugged.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Spade	Why did you shoot him?” She twisted her wrists out of [MASK]’s fingers and put her hands up around the back of his neck, pulling his head down until his mouth all but touched hers. Her body was flat against his from knees to chest.
<name>Rearden</name>	Rearden	Cairo	[MASK]’s smile was demure and not in any way alarmed. “I made somewhat extensive inquiries about you before taking any action,” he said, “and was assured that you were far too reasonable to allow other considerations to interfere with profitable business relations.”
<name>Wolfe</name>	Wolfe	Dundy	“Why not? An inquest is not a court-trial. You can try, anyway. You’ve gotten away with more than that before this.” “I know, but [MASK]’s getting snotty, and maybe it is a little bit thick this time.
<name>Hammer</name>	Hammer	Spade	And it’s a legitimate proposition.” [MASK]’s face was solemn except for wrinkles at the corners of his eyes. “You’re not hiring me to do any murders or burglaries for you, but simply to get it back if possible in an honest and lawful way.”
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Dundy	“Nothing except that he’d been there a week.” “Alone?” “Alone.” “What did you find on him? or in his room?” [MASK] drew his lips in and asked: “What’d you think we’d find?”
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Spade	[MASK] made an impatient gesture with head and hands. “What in hell else could I do? I thought you’d see that. If you pick a fight with her, or let her pick one with you, I’ve got to throw in with her.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Spade	Why shouldn’t she? You’re not so damned honest, and you haven’t been so much on the level with her, that she should trust you completely.” [MASK] said: “That’s enough of that.”
<name>Asa</name>	Asa	Spade	The boy did not show that he had heard the question. “Did you ever—?” [MASK] began, and stopped. A soft light began to glow in his yellowish eyes. He did not address the boy again.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Spade	She looked up at [MASK]. “Go right in.” He squeezed her shoulder by way of acknowledgment, crossed the reception-room to a dully lighted inner corridor, and passed down the corridor to a frosted glass door at its far end.
<name>Constantinople</name>	Constantinople	Constantinople	Yes, that is the Russian’s hand, there’s no doubt of it. Well, sir, what do you suggest? Shall we stand here and shed tears and call each other names? Or shall we”—he paused and his smile was a cherub’s—“go to [MASK]?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Sam	You don’t know anything about him and you can’t talk about my business until you see me. Got it?” “Yes, [MASK]. Who—do you know who he is?” He grinned wolfishly. “Uh-uh,” he said, “but
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Spade	“I remember that.” “I told you to take her to a Ninth-Avenue-number. You didn’t take her there. Where did you take her?” The chauffeur rubbed his cheek with a grimy hand and looked doubtfully at [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Spade	Right?” “Yes, but—oh, sweetheart!—it wasn’t only that. I would have come back to you sooner or later. From the first instant I saw you I knew—” [MASK] said tenderly: “You angel!
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Iva	“How soon?” “As soon as I can.” He kissed her mouth, led her to the door, opened it, said, “Good-bye, [MASK],” bowed her out, shut the door, and returned to his desk.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Spade	In front of the second house from the corner [MASK] halted. On one of the gateposts that were massive out of all proportion to the fence flanking them a 2 and a 6 of pale metal caught what light there was. A square white card was nailed over them.
<name>Waldo</name>	Waldo	Phil	But you weren’t nice to me last night. You were cold and distant and wanted to get rid of me, when I had come down there and waited so long to warn you, and you—” “Warn me about what?” “About [MASK].
<name>Thomson</name>	Thomson	Spade	A plump red-faced man, bald-headed and heavily mustached, appeared, carrying a newspaper. [MASK] said: “I’d like to get the key to twenty-six.” The plump man looked doubtful. He said: “The juice is not on.
<name>McGurk</name>	McGurk	Miles	You killed [MASK] and you’re going over for it. I could have helped you by letting the others go and standing off the police the best way I could. It’s too late for that now. I can’t help you now.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Spade	while shaking tobacco down into a brown paper curved to catch it. The boy lowered his paper and looked around, moving with a purposeful sort of slowness, as of a more natural swiftness restrained. He looked with small hazel eyes under somewhat long curling lashes at [MASK]’s chest.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Gutman	The point is we’ve got to feed the police some—” Now [MASK] broke in, smiling confidently, talking with good-natured assurance: “Well, sir, from what we’ve seen and heard of you I don’t think we’ll have to bother ourselves about that.
<name>Wemmick</name>	Wemmick	Cairo	“No. I shook him before that. Then I suppose he came back here to try to pick me up again.” [MASK], holding his black hat to his belly with both hands, had come into the passageway.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Spade	[MASK] was quiet leaving bed and bedroom and shutting the bedroom-door. He dressed in the bathroom. Then he examined the sleeping girl’s clothes, took a flat brass key from the pocket of her coat, and went out.
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Miles	I suppose she was disappointed, and mad—she sounded that way when she told me about it. She followed [MASK] long enough to make sure he was shadowing the pair, and then she went up to your apartment. You weren’t home.”
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Spade	And, on the other hand, wouldn’t you say they were stopped right now, and that the best thing for us to do is leave well enough alone?” A forked vein began to swell in [MASK]’s forehead. “Jesus!
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Spade	His trousers fitted his round legs more snugly than was the current fashion. The uppers of his patent-leather shoes were hidden by fawn spats. He held a black derby hat in a chamois-gloved hand and came towards [MASK] with short, mincing, bobbing steps.
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Spade	“Let’s talk about the black bird.” The fat man cocked his head to the left and regarded [MASK] with fond eyes. “All right, sir,” he agreed. “Let’s.” He took a sip from the glass in his hand.
<name>Poirot</name>	Poirot	Gutman	“It’s our best bet. With him in their hands, the police will—” “But, my dear man,” [MASK] objected, “can’t you see? If I even for a moment thought of doing it— But that’s ridiculous too.
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Spade	[MASK]’s prompt “Maybe” was noncommittal. He drank. The fat man leaned forward until his belly stopped him. His smile was ingratiating and so was his purring voice. “You could say, then, that the question is which one of them you’ll represent?”
<name>him</name>	him	Spade	“I expressed myself badly. I did not mean to say that I have the money in my pockets, but that I am prepared to get it on a very few minutes’ notice at any time during banking hours.” “Oh!” She looked at [MASK].
<name>Wolfe</name>	Wolfe	Spade	The way to handle them is to toss them a victim, somebody they can hang the works on.” “Well, sir, I grant you that’s one way of doing it, but—” “ ‘But’ hell!” [MASK] said.
<name>Thursby</name>	Thursby	Thursby	He came to me this afternoon and tried to hire me to find something [MASK] was supposed to have on him when he was bumped off. It looked funny, the way he put it to me, so I wouldn’t touch it.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Flitcraft	[MASK] had been a good citizen and a good husband and father, not by any outer compulsion, but simply because he was a man who was most comfortable in step with his surroundings. He had been raised that way. The people he knew were like that.
<name>Longley</name>	Longley	Spade	Presently he gave his genial answer: “Well, sir, there are other means of persuasion besides killing and threatening to kill.” “Sure,” [MASK] agreed, “but they’re not much good unless the threat of death is behind them to hold the victim down.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Dundy	“You haven’t heard me say you killed anybody,” [MASK] replied. “You’re the one that keeps bringing that up. But suppose I did. You could have blipped them both. There’s a way of figuring it.” “Uh-huh.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Spade	There you are, sir: an almost immediate fifty thousand dollars or a vastly greater sum within, say, a couple of months.” [MASK] drank and asked: “How much greater?” “Vastly,” the, fat man repeated.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Spade	Her face was flushed. Her dark red hair, parted on the left side, swept back in loose waves over her right temple, was somewhat tousled. [MASK] took off his hat and said: “Good morning.” His smile brought a fainter smile to her face.
<name>Doyle</name>	Doyle	Spade	He took a battered memorandum-book from a vest-pocket, licked his thumb, thumbed pages, and held the book out open to [MASK]. “There’s the number of the taxi that hauled him. I got that much for you.”
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Spade	You’re too shrewd not to recognize that, sir, I’m sure.” “I understand that,” [MASK] replied. “I was sure you would. I’m also sure that, now there’s no alternative, you’ll somehow manage the police without a fall-guy.”
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Cairo	“I’ve got you by the neck, [MASK]. You’ve walked in and tied yourself up, plenty strong enough to suit the police, with last night’s killings. Well, now you’ll have to play with me or else.”
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Spade	“Is it?” “How do I know?” [MASK] responded. “I was out in the kitchen mixing an omelette when it all happened, wasn’t I?” She wrinkled her forehead, studying him with eyes that perplexity clouded.
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Spade	He put his hands in his trousers-pockets and teetered on his heels. “You’ll play hell with her, you will.” [MASK] grinned wolfishly, showing the edges of teeth far back in his jaw. “You’ve got brains, yes you have.”
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Miles	“Skip it. Tell me what she did.” “I will if you’ll give me a chance. After he had gone out she began to think that maybe he might have had that date. You know [MASK].
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Spade	“I was sure you would. I’m also sure that, now there’s no alternative, you’ll somehow manage the police without a fall-guy.” “I’ll make out all right,” [MASK] replied. “I was sure you would.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Spade	She bit the inside of her lip and turned slowly, going back into the living-room. [MASK] followed her in, put his hat and overcoat on a chair, said, “So we’ll have time to talk,” and went into the kitchen.
<name>Wade</name>	Wade	Miles	He said: “That’s a lie. You asked [MASK] and me to handle it ourselves. You wanted to be sure the shadower was somebody you knew and who knew you, so they’d go with you.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Spade	Forget about the other night. He was dead wrong, but you know anybody’s liable to lose their head if you ride them thataway.” [MASK] looked thoughtfully at the police-detective. “Was that what you wanted to see me about?” he asked.
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Wise	[MASK]’s words came out slower now and there was a sardonic glint in his eye. “She says she had decided by then not to go back to your place again. She says she didn’t know whether you’d like having her drop in that late.
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Spade	On [MASK]’s desk a limp cigarette smoldered in a brass tray filled with the remains of limp cigarettes. Ragged grey flakes of cigarette-ash dotted the yellow top of the desk and the green blotter and the papers that were there.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Sam	“You won’t do that for me?” “I won’t play the sap for you.” “Don’t say that, please.” She took his hand from her shoulder and held it to her face. “Why must you do this to me, [MASK]?
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Gutman	[MASK] interlaced his fingers over his belly and rocked his chair. His voice, like his smile, was frankly rueful. “You are an uncommonly difficult person to get the best of,” he said. “I begin to think that we made a mistake in not letting you alone from the very first.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Spade	[MASK]’s face twisted into a smile that held little joy. He said, “I guess you are,” and stood out of the way. When the police-detectives had entered he shut the corridor-door and followed them back to the living-room.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Miles	He looked sharply at her. He put his arm around her waist, his hand on her hip. “She did kill [MASK], angel,” he said gently, “offhand, like that.” He snapped the fingers of his other hand.
<name>Rita</name>	Rita	Wonderly	Her eyes were brown and playful in a shiny boyish face. She finished shutting the door behind her, leaned against it, and said: “There’s a girl wants to see you. Her name’s [MASK].” “A customer?” “I guess so.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Gutman	I mean it.” He sat up straight. A pleasant smile illuminated his face, erasing its dull lumpishness. He spoke rapidly in an agreeable, persuasive tone: “Listen to me, [MASK]. I’m telling you what’s best for all of us.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Spade	she whispered. [MASK] shrugged again. “That’s the way it was.” He glanced at his watch and moved from his chair to the settee beside her. “There’s no time for worrying about that now.” His voice was pleasant but firm.
<name>He</name>	He	Spade	I’ve got the guns he used. . . . That’s right. Step on it—and luck to you!” [MASK] slowly replaced receiver on prong, telephone on shelf. He wet his lips and looked down at his hands. Their palms were wet.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Cairo	[MASK]: ‘It’s those damned bulls again. They’re getting to be nuisances. Let’s play a joke on them. When you hear them going one of you scream, and then we’ll see how far we can string them along before they tumble.’
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Spade	I advised you not to do this. I don’t think—” “It doesn’t make a damned bit of difference what either of you think,” [MASK] said bluntly. “It’s too late for that now and you’re in too deep.
<name>Mac</name>	Mac	Sam	“How long’s he been here?” “Four days. This is the fifth.” “What about him?” “Search me, [MASK]. I got nothing against him but his looks.” “Find out if he came in last night?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Spade	[MASK] asked. “Not that I know of,” the plump man replied. “Nobody’s been to me for the key in a couple of months.” The plump man marched ahead with the key until they had gone up on the porch.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Sid	Will you give me a ring— here or there—around four, just to see that I’m not in trouble? . . . Hell with your Saturday afternoon golf: your job’s to keep me out of jail. . . . Right, [MASK]. ’
<name>darling</name>	darling	Sam	“What made you think that?” “Oh, I didn’t! But I was mad, [MASK], and I wanted to hurt you.” “It made things damned awkward.” He put his arm around her and drew her nearer.
<name>Snape</name>	Snape	Thursby	“You warned us that [MASK] was dangerous. Of course you lied to us about your sister and all, but that doesn’t count: we didn’t believe you.” He shrugged his sloping shoulders. “I wouldn’t say it was your fault.”
<name>Macomber</name>	Macomber	Gutman	you don’t know what it’s all about either,” he said in a restrained tone. “They’re not asleep, [MASK]. They’re lying low, waiting. Try to get that. I’m in it up to my neck and they know it.
<name>Ward</name>	Ward	Thursby	“Dead sure,” the police-detective replied. “We got hold of a kid—a bellhop at [MASK]’s hotel—that had seen it in his room just that morning. He noticed it particular because he’d never saw one just like it before.
<name>Roark</name>	Roark	Dundy	“We’ve asked what we came to ask,” [MASK] said, frowning over eyes hard as green pebbles. He held his mustached upper lip tight to his teeth, letting his lower lip push the words out. “We’ve told you more than you’ve told us.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Spade	Apparently he did not see [MASK] until the private detective touched his shoulder. He seemed moderately surprised for a moment, and then said: “Oh, yes, of course you saw the ticket.” “Uh-huh. I’ve got something I want to show you.”
<name>Hardy</name>	Hardy	Spade	“It’s all right,” [MASK] assured him, giving h:m one of his cards. “If you want to play safe, though, we can ride up to your office and get your superintendent’s OK.” “I guess it’s all right.
<name>Wolfe</name>	Wolfe	Spade	A puzzled look replaced the look of pain in the lead-colored face. Then [MASK] smiled. His smile was gentle, even dreamy. His right shoulder raised a few inches. His bent right arm was driven up by the shoulder’s lift.
<name>Rearden</name>	Rearden	Spade	“In your own words, why not?” he asked. [MASK] emptied his glass and set it on the table. He put his cigar in his mouth, took it out, looked at it, and put it back in. His yellow-grey eyes were faintly muddy.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Spade	“Suppose,” he said, and swallowed. “Have I—? Can I choose?” “You can,” [MASK] assured him seriously, “but you ought to know that if the answer is out we’ll give you to the police with your boy-friend.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sam	She demanded: “Do you think you know where she is, [MASK]?” “I know where she went,” he replied in a grudging tone. “Where?” She was excited. “Down to the boat you saw burning.”
<name>Thurstan</name>	Thurstan	Spade	He is not a friend of mine.” “That’s good. There goes the curtain. Good night,” [MASK] said, and crossed the street to board a westbound street-car. The youth in the cap boarded the same car.
<name>Velma</name>	Velma	Thursby	His eyes became narrow and sultry. His voice came out deep as the Lieutenant’s. “I don’t like this. What are you sucking around for? Tell me, or get out and let me go to bed.” “Who’s [MASK]?”
<name>Gutman</name>	Gutman	Gutman	And if they didn’t take you away with them it was only because [MASK]’s got too much sense to trust you except for short stretches when he has to and because he thought I’d play the sap for you and—not wanting to hurt you—wouldn’t be able to hurt him.”
