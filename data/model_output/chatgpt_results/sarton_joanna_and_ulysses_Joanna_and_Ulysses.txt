<name>Ignatius</name>	Ignatius	Joanna	“Well, I am glad, too,” said [MASK], “for I slept in an abandoned chapel last night and was devoured by cockroaches.” “In a chapel? The saints preserve us! And weren’t you afraid?”
<name>Bridget</name>	Bridget	Joanna	“But what, oh what shall I do with you when I have to go, my little vacuum cleaner?” And just because this was such an insoluble question, [MASK] refused to allow it to break into her happiness for the moment. In two weeks . . .
<name>he</name>	he	Nicholas	They sat side by side looking down on the stretched silk bay far below, and it was easier to talk because [MASK] no longer stared at her face but he too was looking out over the sea as if he sensed that one does not look grief in the eye.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Ulysses	[MASK], a prisoner down there in the cellar, was the part of herself who would soon be buried, too. She was expected at the office the next day . . . and what then? She brushed her hair hard, then stopped to listen in the middle of a stroke.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Ulysses	But nothing did any good—she fell into a chair, hiccuping, and [MASK] followed her into the parlor and stood behind her, his head drooping over her shoulder. “You are a clever beastie to have chewed off your rope—” “Clever?”
<name>Balthazar</name>	Balthazar	Joanna	“A chapel?” [MASK] asked, feeling bewildered. Would they allow a donkey in a church, even though he did, like all his fellows, bear the mark of the cross on his back, an uneven cross, as if stroked in with a rough brush?
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Ulysses	[MASK] did not devour his second Italian hat which bore no such temptation as a rich red rose on it this time, but only a severe dark blue rosette instead. And slowly the sores healed, and here and there a patch of soft curly hair grew in on his belly.
<name>She</name>	She	Joanna	But when [MASK] put down the receiver she thought that in an impossible dilemma neither a week nor even a month is really any help. The panic, the giggles, and the long childish dream were over, and now she had to come to terms with reality.
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Joanna	“Oh,” the boy munched and considered this unexpected piece of news. “So I heard in the village. They say you are a fool.” “No doubt,” [MASK] said drily. “My father also says so rather often.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Joanna	“What did they do?” “They put burning cigarettes in my brother’s ears, to make her talk. And my brother screamed ‘Don’t tell, mother, don’t tell!’” [MASK] saw the tears shining in the boy’s eyes.
<name>the dog</name>	the dog	Ulysses	I can see the stones; I cannot yet see the village.” One bare foot scraped against the other while he considered this, and then considered [MASK], who was delicately sniffing his way among the dry bushes, hoping to uncover some unexpected delicacy.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Ulysses	And it was as if she were being brought out at last from a dank, dark cell where all she could think of was suffering, and set on a high place with the sea below her. “It is a good thing I found you, [MASK],” she said.
<name>Uncle Andrew</name>	Uncle Andrew	Ulysses	“I shall have to have some coffee, [MASK]. And find water for you,” she said. The thought of coffee led her on, up the last hairpin curve to the final parapet. There she sat down heavily on a stone step, unable to go further.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Ulysses	“Oh my dear, dear, what are we going to do now?” She wept, and it seemed as if all the tears she had held back through the war were now faffing in abandon on [MASK]’ head. His eyes were half-closed.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Joanna	The answer had been “no” so many times that finally, as the sun was setting and the whole bay below suffused with deep rose, [MASK] sat down on the steps of the village bakery and—thoroughly ashamed of herself—cried.
<name>Benito</name>	Benito	Ulysses	Some of the donkeys looked moth-eaten; many had saddle sores, and many had swaybacks from carrying loads beyond their strength. “I get back all and more than I spend in tips. People like a handsome donkey, eh [MASK]?”
<name>Donkey</name>	Donkey	Ulysses	When he came back, he was full of ingenious plans. They went first to the wood-seller three doors down. And there in the sweet smelling shop, [MASK] was relieved of his burdens and tethered to a post, and given half a loaf of bread for his supper.
<name>liners</name>	liners	Delos	She felt no better when the freighter entered the port, and she realized what an idyllic life she had been lead- ing. Now she saw the hundreds of ships in their berths, the elegant yacht-like [MASK] at anchor and all lit up, as it lay there waiting for a cargo of rich tourists.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Joanna	“You were such a wild moody little girl, [MASK], but your mother always believed you would be an artist. Hard for a woman to be a real artist, she used to say. Such a woman must have a daemon in her and obey the daemon.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Joanna	Her silence blazed. And he recognized that fire. “Don’t just stand there . . . looking like your mother!” The words slipped out, but once they had slipped out, there could be no turning back. “At last!” [MASK] breathed.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Joanna	He stared at her boldly now. He did not care who was listening, for indeed the silence around them was tangible as a cloud. [MASK] threw back her head and laughed, a free laugh, a laugh of pure surprise with no malice in it.
<name>Ass</name>	Ass	Ulysses	“Don't!” “Don’t what?” “Don’t tease me about [MASK].” “I can’t take that donkey very seriously,” and he laughed his dry lifeless laugh, more like a cough than a laugh.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Joanna	“You know there is some advantage in being poor. The poor help each other. If you had been able to pay, my guess is that my friend would have refused to be bothered.” “I like to be independent,” [MASK] said quietly.
<name>Sancho</name>	Sancho	Zarian	Laughter and jeers broke out on all sides, and the donkeys, whose supper time it was, took up the sound and joined in with mocking brays. “Come!” [MASK] said curtly, to his donkey. He spat over the parapet as he left.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Joanna	After a few moments, [MASK] could hear him whistling, a shrill whistling song. For a second she felt lonely. The child had filled the landscape with his presence as if he had been a small god. Now she felt the emptiness, the solitude all around her.
<name>Chris</name>	Chris	Christopher	This was different from talking to a donkey, it was talking to a human being, to an equal, for in [MASK] too she recognized the wildness, the anarchic angel, even though he had found his freedom by leading the very simplest possible of lives.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Nicholas	Far off she heard the melancholy whistle, and ran to the top of the hill to wave an answer to [MASK]. She waved and then ran down to the broken wall where they had sat and talked so often, and which she had painted so many times in the last weeks.
<name>him</name>	him	Zarian	“I’m not going to leave you. I’m taking you with me,” she told him. “The freighter will take us both the day after tomorrow,” she explained to [MASK]. “It’s all right.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Joanna	“One could not dream such a sound, my dear girll Unless one was ready for a madhouse.” At this moment [MASK] had to go into the next room to stifle an acute fit of giggles. It was a pure nervous reaction, for she was in a panic.
<name>Miss Lavish</name>	Miss Lavish	Joanna	It was very funny—such unholy sounds emerging from such a meek creature, and especially as they were sounds of love. “Time for a siesta,” [MASK] said. “Good heavens, yes, it’s nearly two o’clock! I am dreadfully sleepy. . . .”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Ulysses	She opened one tube of salve and squeezed frantically; the minute her hand touched the sore, [MASK] shivered. His whole skin reacted as at the prick of a pin. “I can’t help it,” she admonished him. “It is going to hurt.”
<name>person</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	person (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Ulysses	She was expected at the office the next day . . . and what then? She brushed her hair hard, then stopped to listen in the middle of a stroke. Not a sound. At least for the present [MASK] was perfectly quiet.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Ulysses	Far off now she could hear the whistling still, faint and far away. Then it stopped. She and [MASK] were alone. And in the silence, heat shimmering its invisible flames all around her, sky an immense blue radiance overhead, she saw what had really happened.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Ulysses	Let us apply logic, she told herself. In the first place, [MASK] is beautiful and charming. To whom would this charm appeal? Secondly, his is truly a fine story, full of pathos and drama. To whom would such a story appeal?
<name>Lady Markby</name>	Lady Markby	Joanna	Grief had not made her speechless. “Oh dear,” [MASK] said, “it is awful, but I have spent all my money. What can I do? Look, if you will give me your address, I will replace the gardenias—I really will.”
<name>Madame Hortense</name>	Madame Hortense	Zarian	Then she turned to him, “You are too kind, dear [MASK].” In a phrase she put distance between them. He had to admit that she was a lady, however eccentric a lady. And he called loudly for another ouzo.
<name>Julie</name>	Julie	Zarian	Not tenderness for his bright dark eyes. [MASK]’s reaction was instantaneous. If she was going to give him a donkey, there must be some catch in it. After all, people don’t go around giving away donkeys as if they were ice cream cones.
<name>she</name>	she	Joanna	The slight pang [MASK] felt when she handed it over melted away; it did seem to her one of her best paint-84] ings—and she had wanted to show it to her father—she could hear him saying in his dry ironic voice, “You would give the clothes off your back.
<name>Boxer</name>	Boxer	Joanna	It is more dignified.” And for that last word, [MASK] forgave him much. For she had sensed all along that there was something offensive, in this village where everyone worked so hard, about an animal who did no work. Even the cats caught mice and rats.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Joanna	Why ever should he?” [MASK] said. “Well, he knows something about what we were doing in the war. I did him a good tum once myself.” He looked at her quizzically. “You know there is some advantage in being poor.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Joanna	It was this intelligence, this sensitivity, this hard core in the man which had drawn her mother to him. There under the layers of pretence, under the spoiled child he had let himself become, was the flame, and [MASK] recognized it.
<name>he</name>	he	Nicholas	She waved and then ran down to the broken wall where they had sat and talked so often, and which she had painted so many times in the last weeks. When [MASK] appeared over the crest of the hill, she was busy with her box of canvases.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Ulysses	Then, appalled by such an act of generosity, which had been apparently wrenched out of him, in spite of himself, he spat, and turned back without a further word, as if he didn’t want her thanks. “Now, home, [MASK]!”
<name>fire</name>	fire	Ulysses	“After all, we have shelter, [MASK], and a loaf of bread. That is, perhaps, more than a mad woman and a sick donkey could expect.” She felt her way to the door, opened it and stole out.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Joanna	[MASK] asked. She had held the question back until now, ashamed to expose her anxiety. “Of course. A well-fed healthy donkey is good business.” “Well then,” it was her turn to rise. She could not wait to get away.
<name>Eurydice</name>	Eurydice	Joanna	He took a stone and threw it as far as he could, a gesture in which there was some anger. And [MASK] felt that she was being tugged back, in spite of herself, drawn back into the complex human world.
<name>Norman</name>	Norman	Joanna	he said with pride as if this fantastic phenomenon and terror had been a sort of glory. “The destroyers could not get in for days . . . there was no water.” “War is like that,” [MASK] told him, and he nodded.
<name>Odysseus</name>	Odysseus	Zarian	I will paint the village, or your house . . [MASK] scratched his head. A wily look came into his eyes. There is nothing more pleasant to a Greek than a bargain, but he wants to make the terms himself. Therein lies the genius of the bargainer.
<name>he</name>	he	Joanna	It was all happening much too fast, like an old film being run off at double speed. Although the wind had died down, the sea was still ruffled and the big rowboat struggled and reeled, so [MASK] hung to the rail.
<name>her</name>	her	Joanna	The question flew down so swiftly, it took [MASK] by surprise. It seemed to stay there like an ominous bird settling on her easel. “It’s a holiday. Holidays are not very long.” There was a silence. Already the sun began to bum.
<name>Antigone</name>	Antigone	Joanna	They say you are proud, an Athenian woman with her nose in the air.” “They can say what they please,” [MASK] said. She felt suddenly exposed. The solitude she had imagined she was experiencing had been an illusion then.
<name>her</name>	her	88	She staggered over to the rowing man, quite oblivious of the fact that she was rocking everyone and [MASK]] had knocked over a woman’s bundle. “Will they take a donkey on board?” she shouted. “What?”
<name>food</name>	food	Ulysses	But she was too occupied with pushing and trundling a small bale of hay up the path to do more than make sure he was still there. Her idea was to keep the hay here in the chapel and bring [MASK] up every morning.
<name>Eeyore</name>	Eeyore	Ulysses	But the joke was on her, for she was not rich. And the truth was that she felt exhaustion before the effort ahead. “Well, [MASK], let’s go!” She had found a name for the donkey, without even considering the matter.
<name>he</name>	he	Christopher	I will never again live from day to day, just to keep time passing, never again!” she said, and her eyes flashed. “This has been a long time in coming,” [MASK] said, “but you are right, of course.
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Nicholas	But [MASK] and her painting had gone. Far down the hill he must be, for she heard his shrill melan-86] choly whistle, in the distance. And for the second time that morning she respected his dignity and his silence.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Joanna	“Butter fingers!” her father said, not unkindly. “You are nervous, my dear!” [MASK] burst into tears. That, too, was unlike her; she had to invent a reason for such violent behavior. “You’re all upset.”
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Joanna	Now she was in for it, [MASK] did not want to open the strapped canvases. She was afraid to. She was afraid that here, in this other world, all she had done would seem unreal. What did it matter, anyway, she told herself?
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Ulysses	[MASK] stood two steps below her, so it happened that she could look straight into his face for the first time and saw how beautiful and dark his eyes were, rimmed in long lashes; and again she laid a hand gently on his forehead and caressed his soft nose.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Joanna	How hot his head was, poor beastie! They stood there a few seconds, leaning together like two orphans, and [MASK] looked up at the climb ahead with dismay. “Come,” she said, taking the frayed rope in her hands.
<name>herself</name>	herself	Ulysses	She would be 40] able to cure [MASK], and paint. But just to be sure that she would not now be punished for her pride, she hastily chose a particularly splendid collar of blue beads with a pendant hanging from it made of leather decorated with tiny white and yellow beads.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Joanna	[MASK] was taken wholly by surprise. She had been so busy being anxious that she had almost forgotten the paintings; and when she set them up for her father, she had been too self-conscious to look at them herself.
<name>Mr. Biswas</name>	Mr. Biswas	Joanna	“You are a vacuum cleaner,” said [MASK], and he rubbed her back with his head. He was apt to come and do this two or three times in a morning, as if to say, “Good to find you still here.”
<name>Frida</name>	Frida	Joanna	And he threw down some coarse handwoven saddle bags, with a bold black and white design. “That’s it. That’s perfect,” [MASK] cried, imagining each bag bulging with paints, loaves of bread, even hay. Everything had become real again, believable.
<name>Horace</name>	Horace	Ulysses	Then he would be out of the way (those flowers!). “There,” she said with one last heave. “It’s for you, [MASK].” Already his neck was stretched out pulling at the rope; he was hungry and that was a good sign.
<name>Don Quixote</name>	Don Quixote	Ulysses	He liked the danger. Me,” he smiled a mischievous smile, “I like solid ground under my feet. And,” he glanced over at her humorously, “I like my donkey.” “You will be land to [MASK]?”
<name>Niko</name>	Niko	Ulysses	scanning her face with such intensity (she felt sometimes as if his eyes were nibbling at her as [MASK]’ soft lips sometimes actually did)—when he asked this fundamental question, she took a long swallow of retsina, and looked out at the long sweep of blue bay below them.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Joanna	“Did I say that? Did I?” [MASK] did not remember. How busy she had been all these years trying not to listen to the daemon! “I didn’t know then that to be a painter takes time.”
<name>Philemon</name>	Philemon	Ulysses	By half past eight—after the regular routine of three cups of black coffee and a walk to the chapel, where she rubbed salve into [MASK]’ wounds and re-bandaged him, and took him to drink at the village well—they were off.
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Joanna	“The fact is,” he said, smiling now, “that you are an artist. That is the fact we have to reckon with.” [MASK] felt a great surge of hope rise, only to be followed by the inevitable wave of self-doubt.
<name>Assunta</name>	Assunta	Joanna	“Not here. Your donkey would spend the night eating my new stock of straw hats. You know, [MASK],” and he twinkled with amusement, “it is one thing to hide an English soldier and quite another to hide a donkey!”
<name>she</name>	she	Joanna	The little boy asked the question which no doubt the older men in the village bandied about among themselves. Did he relate her answers when he swaggered down the village street, big with secrets? Well, if he did, [MASK] did not mind.
<name>Judy</name>	Judy	Joanna	The voice was shrill with surprise and disappointment. [MASK] laughed then and toned the question on him, “Why are you alone, do you suppose?” He looked at her askance then with the wild blank look of a goat. “I’m not alone.
<name>Marion</name>	Marion	Christopher	“And with a donkey!” [MASK] looked very tall and very thin above her, laughing with surprise and pleasure. He resembled one of the Picasso clowns of the blue period, and looked a little like a donkey himself, he had such a long face.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Joanna	There was a silence. Already the sun began to bum. The scent of thyme breathed up from the ground. “I have to work now,” [MASK] said. “Why do you have to, if it’s a holiday?” “It’s like fishing.
<name>Asa</name>	Asa	Ulysses	And, when the time came, after a night of high wind which suddenly let down in the early morning, she loaded the valises onto [MASK]’ back. Let him get used to his new life with the easy descent, loaded with all she possessed.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Joanna	But the roof doesn’t leak” (as if it would rain!) “and the walls are thick.” He began to warm to his own plan. “I can lend you some sheepskins.” “Oh yes, yes!” [MASK] cried.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Joanna	“It’s yesterday’s, but it’s yours if you want it.” While he turned back to lock the door, [MASK] wanted very much to give the donkey a large hunk of bread, but she was afraid of shocking the baker out of his kindness.
<name>her art</name>	her art	Ulysses	She was frightened not only of his anger, and impatience with what would seem to him the purest folly of course, but she was also afraid that if she had to render [MASK] up, she would, so to speak, be giving up the living part of herself which had begun to paint again.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Ulysses	would [MASK] still be there? The sun felt hot now and she feared the heat would be bad for his sores. But she was too occupied with pushing and trundling a small bale of hay up the path to do more than make sure he was still there.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Ulysses	There was nothing to be done but telephone, say she was ill, stay home and try to solve the problem. [MASK] balked at the top of the stairs—it was not so much, she divined, that he couldn’t go down, as that he didn’t want to.
<name>Laura</name>	Laura	Joanna	Oh her mother had always been as clear as daylight, and [MASK] was aware that she herself had inherited from her father complexities and subtleties which inhibited action. We should never have been left alone together, we two, she thought in her gloom.
<name>his wife</name>	his wife	Joanna	It is quite extraor-120] dinary. Here I have lived with this girl for thirty years and I never suspected that she had serious work in her! Astonishing . . So that he had by now come to take for granted what [MASK] herself was totally unprepared to hear.
<name>Brett</name>	Brett	Nicholas	“I go the day after tomorrow.” [MASK] did not answer. “Look, I have olives and cheese, and ripe round tomatoes,” she said. “Are you as hungry as I am?”
<name>Ma Joad</name>	Ma Joad	Ulysses	It would never cover [MASK]’ belly, only a fraction of it, and in her mind’s eye she saw the horrible black icing of flies. “Oh dear.” “What’s wrong? This is the best there is. I guarantee it.”
<name>She</name>	She	Joanna	[MASK] opened the door and shivered with pleasure. It was a perfect morning world, the sea soft and silken blue and the sky still flushed with rose. The air itself was like some strange nourishment, a tonic, and she drew in deep breaths and stretched her arms over her head.
<name>Maude</name>	Maude	Ulysses	The very thought of so many tubes of precious salve seemed to make him angry. “What do I care?” “Yes, perhaps six would be better,” she said dreamily. Every time she considered [MASK]’ belly it seemed to grow bigger and even six tubes seemed hardly enough.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Joanna	Work is what one has to do to live. Do you sell your paintings or do you give them away like donkeys?” He was serious. There was no sneer. [MASK] bowed her head. “Sometimes I give them away when I think they are good enough.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Joanna	“I’ll pay for any damage he does.” The old woman stood there, silently, and [MASK] waited. “We’ll be off painting all day,” she said pleadingly. Oh please, she prayed silently, don’t stop me now.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Joanna	It had gone on so long, the stifling, the routine of pretence, how could it end now? Let in daylight now? And because she felt caught in an ignoble coil, [MASK] began to be impatient with her father’s foibles.
<name>Dora</name>	Dora	Joanna	I know what I’m doing!” And [MASK] felt the rough stick tom from her hands. The old man was pushing the miserable beast from behind, and slowly, slowly, the match stick legs stumbled a step forward. “I’ll buy it!”
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Joanna	The donkey had no strength, it seemed, even to wag its tail at the flies. It waited, just barely able to stand, its head drooping a little. The patience and suffering of the donkey were awful. And [MASK], in her weakness, turned away.
<name>Mrs. Ramsay</name>	Mrs. Ramsay	Joanna	It meant, you have forgotten me. “Here, here’s a tomato for you,” said [MASK], and then they all three munched for a while. “But. .the little boy began again when he had swallowed and burped. “You are a woman.
<name>Miss Kenton</name>	Miss Kenton	Joanna	It looked hardly real. But the roar of the anchor grinding down was real enough, and [MASK] ran back to collect her luggage, to be ready to disembark into the small boat already close to the ship’s ladder.
<name>dear</name>	dear	Joanna	“Never mind,” he answered, for he knew what she was thinking. “We’ll take the risk. We may have some hard times. But I have saved, you know, a little. We’ll manage, [MASK],” he said firmly.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Joanna	[MASK] lifted her eyes and perhaps for the first time in their long acquaintance looked at her father as one human being to another. “The fact is,” he said, smiling now, “that you are an artist. That is the fact we have to reckon with.”
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Nicholas	[MASK] sat leaning one arm on the canvas with a proprietary air as if he feared a sea gull might swoop down and steal it from him. He looked up, narrowing his eyes. “The birds are flying low. Storm.
<name>Sara</name>	Sara	Joanna	“There,” said the baker. He seemed as delighted as if he had led them into a palace. “Sweet dreams!” [MASK] watched him go down the field and drop out of sight among the flat roofs of the village below.
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Christopher	“I have lived so long in the dark with my father,” she said, “I am easily dazzled.” [MASK] listened. It was one of his charms that he listened. He did not rush in to deny what was obviously true, nor to comfort where comfort would be only words.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Nicholas	But [MASK]’ sharp eyes had seen at once that this was a different sort of gift from the one that now hung in his bedroom, and which he was considering giving to the school, so that it could be admired and seen by more people.
