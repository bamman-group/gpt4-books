<name>Connor</name>	Connor	Kyle	The brothers’ voices were very similar — or they would have been, if [MASK] weren’t always half shouting, his tone always twisted with anger. “We’ve all lost somebody — hell, we’ve all lost everybody. But this is ridiculous.”
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Jamie	Would his age protect him from them if he tried to protect me? I doubted it. My thoughts scrambled, searching for some way to dissuade him without triggering his stubbornness. [MASK] spoke before I could say anything; he was suddenly calm, as if the answer was plain in front of him.
<name>She</name>	She	Melanie	Let him go. [MASK] knew better than I what she was talking about. This was her world. Her rules. I stared at the face of the man who was about to die — the man who wanted me dead.
<name>He</name>	He	Jared	I sighed heavily. Even over the sound of our exerted breathing, [MASK] heard that. In my peripheral vision, I saw his face turn, felt his eyes boring into me, but I did not look over to meet his gaze. I stared at the ground.
<name>Wanderer</name>	Wanderer	Kevin	“Taking control?” My eyes strained wide. “With the soul unaware? The host took the body back?” “Sadly, yes. [MASK] was not strong enough to suppress this host.” Not strong enough. Would they think me weak as well?
<name>Bean</name>	Bean	Jamie	“Yeah, I was listening. Eavesdropping, I’ll admit it. I’m not sorry — it was great stuff, and you won’t talk to me the way you do with [MASK]. I really got a kick out of those bats and the plants and spiders.
<name>Clary</name>	Clary	Wanda	He didn’t lower his voice. This reminded me of last night, of the secret he wouldn’t tell me. My eyebrows pulled together. What do you think he’s not telling us? You know what I know, [MASK]. You’re human.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Jeb	“Now, that’s a real valid point. It’s not fair to ask you to live with that.” My stomach dropped. “If I get a choice, I’d rather you shot me, actually,” I whispered. [MASK] laughed.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ian	“Yes, so I can clean it.” “I thought about trying that... to drain it, but the pain . . .” “He’ll feel nothing now.” “Look at his face,” [MASK] leaned in beside me to whisper.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jeb	Not one glance in my direction, not one more thought for my fate. I listened to the fading sound of his footsteps until they were gone. Then, forgetting [MASK]’s existence, I pressed my face into my hands and sobbed.
<name>Delilah</name>	Delilah	Encouraging	How much I’d been allowing. [MASK]. It was almost too easy to silence her. As easy as it should have been from the beginning. It was only me now. Just me, and the pain and the horror that I would never escape.
<name>Sirens</name>	Sirens	Seekers	Still the keepers of the peace. Still the punishers. [MASK]. It wasn’t as common a sight or sound as it had been before. The police force was only needed to help in cases of accidents or other emergencies, not to enforce laws.
<name>Jacob</name>	Jacob	Melanie	Why this crazy human should be such a comfort to me, I couldn’t understand. I supposed it was like [MASK] had said, desperate times. “Not too shabby, eh?” he asked, a grin of pride on his face.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Sunny	This tribunal was a waste of my small store of time. I was worried about more important things. “Which one?” he responded in a weary voice. I stared at him for a few seconds, and then my eyes grew wide. “[MASK]’s gone?
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Kathy	, I heard [MASK] calling my name behind me as I ran into the road. I didn’t live far from the Comforter’s office, but the darkness in the street disoriented me. I’d gone two blocks before I realized I was running in the wrong direction.
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Jeb	“We’ll just wait our turn,” [MASK] told me. He leaned against the wall. I stood stiffly beside him, uncomfortably conscious of the four pairs of eyes on me, though I kept my own on the dark hot spring rushing by underneath the porous floor.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Jared	I swung myself over the door into the seat. [MASK] was in his seat already. He leaned over and tied the blindfold over my eyes again. I held still to make it easier. The noise of the engine scared me. It seemed too dangerous.
<name>Emilia</name>	Emilia	Melanie	[MASK] was silent, too. I closed my eyes, finding little difference between my lids and the moonless night, and drifted into unconsciousness with unexpected ease. Dehydrated I Okay! You were right, you were right!” I said the words out loud.
<name>Yeva</name>	Yeva	Jamie	say I got hurt hiking or something . .. and then I’d find a way to be alone and I’d take as much as I could hide. Think of it! I could get enough to heal everyone here. To last for years. And [MASK] would be fine!
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Walter	“There was no hatred in your heart,” I whispered. “That you existed is proof that we were wrong. We had no right to take your world from you, [MASK]. I hope your fairytales are true. I hope you find your Gladdie.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Melanie	“Ah . .. thank you,” I finally managed, my pulse thudding behind my ears. We waited, [MASK] tensed as if to run, while he lifted our acquisitions into the car. There’s nothing to fear. He’s being kind, too.
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Jared	[MASK] was breathing too hard. I had to be fast or he would stop me. Just pretend it’s a shovel opening the ground, I told myself. I jammed the knife into my arm. The headrest muffled my scream, but it was still too loud.
<name>Zeke</name>	Zeke	Nate	Did you think you all were the only ones still kickin’?” He laughed again. None of us had moved an inch. “Think they’re in shock, [MASK],” another man said. “We scared them half to death,” a woman said.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Jared	“There’s no point in wasting an opportunity,” she said fiercely. “We all realize that this is hard for you, [MASK], but in the end it’s not your decision to make. We have to consider what’s best for the majority.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Mel	I am who I am, [MASK]. I can’t change that, though everything else may change. You hold on to yourself; allow me to do the same. But if we’re going to — She would have continued to argue with me, but we were interrupted.
<name>Rick</name>	Rick	Kyle	“Sure,” [MASK] said in a hard voice. “The centipedes will be only too happy to heal his body when they find us here. And make him one of them. Is that what you’re after?” I turned to glare at the big, sneering man.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Jared	I lay there for a moment, facedown, breathing. I was sure at this point that [MASK] was long gone, but I didn’t make certain of that right away. I just breathed in and out until I felt prepared to lift my head.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jeb	“Don’t think about it, then,” [MASK] told him. “Maybe you’ll figure something out later. Give it some time.” “What are we going to do with it? We can’t keep watch on it round the clock.”
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Jeb	Did you think of what could happen? This isn’t a joke! They’ll hurt him to get to me!” [MASK] remained calm, his face placid. “Don’t think there’ll be any trouble today. I’d bet on it.”
<name>Aiden</name>	Aiden	Wanderer	“Heavens, no, [MASK]. Haven’t I told you this? Hmm. Maybe not, since it’s not my job to talk, but to listen. Most of the souls I speak with don’t need as much encouragement as you do.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Wanda	I’ll have to make the decision sometime. Not now! Wait! Think about this! My stomach rolled again, and I had to hunch my body forward and take a deep breath. I just managed not to gag. “[MASK]?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jared	So whatever damage I was doing to their relationship, it was probably not irreparable. It had been a long day — the day had already been long even before [MASK] and the others had shown up, and that seemed like eons ago.
<name>Elara</name>	Elara	Melanie	Do you want the Seeker inside you? Ugh! ” I recoiled from the thought as if I would be the one to house her. There is another choice, [MASK] thought softly. “Really?” I demanded with heavy sarcasm. “Show me one.”
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Jared	[MASK] was on his feet but still watching my face. His question distracted me before I could ask her what she meant. “Yes.” “What’s she saying? ” “We’re noticing what the others think of your . . . change of heart.”
<name>Reyna</name>	Reyna	Jared	I didn’t particularly want to see anyone — besides the sick yearning to see [MASK], of course — but the unpopulated tunnels, combined with the knowledge that something was being kept from me, made me edgy. The kitchen was not even half full — an oddity for this time of the morning.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jamie	[MASK] almost always asked for corroboration, though he never waited for my answer. “They’re all leathery, though, with three, four, or five sets of wings, depending on how old they are, right?
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Kathy	She likes it long.” She didn’t gasp, as I half expected she would. [MASK] was good at her job. Her response was only a second late and only slightly incoherent. “You . . . She . .. she’s still that.. .
<name>Genly</name>	Genly	Wanderer	She laughed lightly. “You are not at ease with human names yet, are you, [MASK]?” “No. To be honest, it seems . .. like a surrender.” I looked up to see her nod slowly.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Doc	I watched the doctor when they were gone, waiting for some change. [MASK]’s relaxed expression didn’t waver, though, and he didn’t touch the gun. He stretched his long frame out on the mat, his calves and feet hanging off the end.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	O’Shea	“ You stop,” he growled back at me. He yanked me through the arch into the tunnel, then pulled me north. I had to almost run to keep up with his longer stride. “[MASK]! ”
<name>Thorn</name>	Thorn	Trudy	I could hear [MASK] talking to the Healer’s host, but I tuned out the words. Let the humans take care of their own for the moment. “Not that the off-world ships are going to,” I told him, shaking my head.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Jared	He opened his mouth to speak, but nothing came out. I wanted to know what they were talking about, but [MASK]’s presence made me silent, brought back the reserve I rarely felt the need for anymore. “You can’t save him.
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Mel	He doesn’t need your medicine. He needs more than that. Something that really works . . . My breathing sped up, deepened as I saw it. He needs mine, I realized. [MASK] and I were both awestruck by the obviousness of this idea.
<name>Nemesis</name>	Nemesis	Melanie	A thousand sentient beings, closing their eyes forever rather than accept us. They’d curled their leaves from the suns and starved. Good for them, [MASK] whispered. There was no venom attached to the thought, only approval as she saluted the tragedy in my memory.
<name>Shevek</name>	Shevek	Doc	“Excruciating,” I told him. “We all remember how it was for our Mothers.” [MASK] was stroking his chin, entranced. “I wonder what the evolutionary track would be ... to produce a hive society with suiciding queens. . . .”
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Mel	After a few minutes, he whispered, “Love you, [MASK].” “She loves you, too. She’s so happy that you’re here and safe.” He was silent long enough for the tears on my skin to dry, leaving a fine, salty dust behind.
<name>Elspeth</name>	Elspeth	Rebecca	She worried, too. Yes, you are here. And you will stay here, I promised. With a sigh, I returned to my efforts. My doomed efforts? “I know you have a name,” I told the woman. “Is it [MASK]?
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jared	Maybe the others were busy trying to find me, too. Maybe [MASK]’s homecoming had returned them to their original opinion about me. It had seemed that way in the kitchen, when they’d hung their heads and eyed me with furtive guilt.
<name>Bast</name>	Bast	Jeb	They just opened a new world.” I expected [MASK] to jump in with questions about the new world, or the ones I’d skipped, but he just played absently with the ends of his beard. “Why did you never stay anywhere?”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Ian	I grinned wryly at the big man, and his lips curled up at the corners, though he didn’t look up to see my smile. “Not that you’re surprised to hear that,” [MASK] said beside me.
<name>Jared</name>	Jared	Doc	“Ah,” the Seeker’s familiar voice moaned from the human body. “Ah.” The room went utterly silent. Everyone looked at me, as if I were the expert on humans. I elbowed [MASK], my hands still wrapped around the tank.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Summer	The woman squeezed my hand, and her eyes opened. They didn’t focus at first, just whirled around the bright cave. What a strange, unexpected sight this place must have been for her. “You’re going to be all right, [MASK].
<name>He</name>	He	Ian	It didn’t sound so false. It had been a long, long day, this, my last day. I’d been up all night, I realized. I hadn’t slept since that last raid; I must have been exhausted. [MASK] nodded.
<name>Dean</name>	Dean	Jeb	I was beginning to hate those words from [MASK]. “Do you remember what I was saying about you maybe teaching a little here?” My answer was curt. “Yes.” “Well, how ’bout it?” I didn’t have to think it through.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jamie	The boxes this displaced fell on me like a small avalanche. I rolled away, covering my head with my arms. A heavy one caught me right between the shoulder blades, and I cried out in pain. “Stop hurting her! ” [MASK] howled.
<name>Max</name>	Max	Curt	And the Origin, to boot! There isn’t a school on this planet that wouldn’t love to steal you away from us. [MASK] plots ways to keep you busy so you have no time to consider moving.” “Honorary Professor,” I corrected her.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Kevin	“The word challenging does not quite cover [MASK]’s story,” I whispered. “Yes, well, you preferred to ignore the recommendation.” She held up her hands in a peacemaking gesture when my body tensed, causing the stiff fabric on the narrow bed to crackle softly.
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Ian	[MASK] brought enough for three every time. I found his about-face in regard to me unsettling. Was he really no longer intent on my death? Or just looking for an opportunity? The water always tasted funny here — sulfurous and stale — but now that taste seemed suspicious.
<name>James</name>	James	Jared	He was anxious. This knowledge made my palms sweaty, but I tried to keep the panic from my voice. “I’m so sorry,” I apologized in a loud whisper. I glanced at [MASK], as if checking to see whether our words had woken him.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Kyle	Does that bother you, too?” “Sometimes. We don’t go out during the day much.” “At least she gets to stretch her legs,” [MASK] muttered. “I don’t know why you want to hear her complain.”
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Jamie	" The steel disappears from my throat, only to be replaced by a hand as hard as iron. I can barely breathe under his grip. "Where are the rest of them?" he demands, squeezing. "It's just me!" I rasp. I can't lead him to [MASK].
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Ian	[MASK]’s hand moved to my forehead, holding me down. I twisted my head under his hand, trying to see ... I was outside. Outside. On my left, a rough, tumbled pile of boulders formed a miniature mountain, complete with scrubby brush.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Jared	“Time is on my side,” he said, grinning. “We’ve got the rest of our lives in here. One day you’ll wonder what you ever saw in [MASK].” In your dreams. I laughed with him, happy he was joking again.
<name>Draco</name>	Draco	Doc	I don’t. As disgusted as I am that you would bring back more . . . victims for [MASK], bring them back now! — as much as that turns my stomach, that’s not what upset her. How can you be so blind?
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Jared	I did. “Why don’t you sleep in [MASK]’s room, then? Are you afraid to sleep alone?” I wouldn’t have blamed him for that. It seemed like I was constantly terrified here. “Afraid,” he grumbled, offended.
<name>She</name>	She	Ian	I demanded, still whispering. [MASK] sighed again. “He’s in the south wing. He’s ... not doing well.” “Why didn’t anyone tell me?” “Things have been .. . difficult for you lately, so . ..”
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Ian	But you can’t go like this. You look horrible. It will just upset him for no good reason. Sit down and eat some more food.” “His leg?” I demanded. “There’s a little infection,” [MASK] murmured.
<name>Clare</name>	Clare	Wanderer	Not even you yourself, [MASK].” He kissed me again, his mouth rougher with the return of the anger. His hand curled into a fist around my hair, and he pulled my face an inch away from his. “Good or bad?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jared	It seemed to me that while I lived and [MASK] was in the caves, this must be where I belonged. There was no dim light to greet me now. I was fairly sure I was in the last leg — the turns and twists were still vaguely familiar.
<name>I</name>	I	Doc	So stupidly, blindly stubborn! she growled. He wouldn’t believe you if you told him the sun sets in the west. But [MASK] was beyond caring about the slight to me. “You found something! ”
<name>Jonas</name>	Jonas	Doc	Let’s get it over with.” [MASK], excited again, cut into the Healer until he could see the silver gleam. He set the scalpel quickly aside. “Now what?” I put my hand on his. “Trace up the back ridge.
<name>Numair</name>	Numair	Doc	“That’s good. Now you hold the hair.” [MASK] switched places with me in a smooth, swift movement. He was good at his Calling. He would have made quite a Healer. I didn’t try to hide what I was doing from him.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Jamie	We can’t outrun them, not in this. If we try to run, a thousand of them will swarm after us. Think of [MASK].” The van was slowing, drifting to the shoulder. “Give me one try,” I begged.
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Jared	The words caught in my throat when I saw that it was [MASK] whose arms held me up. “You could have just asked for help,” he said conversationally. “I —” I cleared my throat. “I should have. I didn’t want to ...”
<name>Enrico</name>	Enrico	Wes	It was true she had killed [MASK]. He was so young and so loved. His death left a burning agony in its wake. I understood the claim of human justice that demanded her life in return. It was also true that I wanted her to die.
<name>his</name>	his	Doc	Had I already seen his face, his living face, for the last time? His name was just a whisper on my lips now, low enough that I could hear [MASK]’s quiet snoring. I wiped the tepid cloth across his body without ceasing.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Doc	“She can’t remember her name. [MASK]’s working with her. She’s going to be even more scared when she sees all of you. Try to be quiet and move slowly, okay?” “Yes, yes,” the voices whispered in the darkness.
<name>Bella</name>	Bella	Jared	If it was difficult for me, a soul used to such changes, how hard must it be for the humans? I was working to put the last of the jealousy and the perplexing echoes of the love I still felt for [MASK] behind me.
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Jared	“Those cots aren’t much softer than rock, and she’s got a lot of sore spots.” [MASK] still held my hand. Did he realize how tightly he was gripping it? The pressure was starting to get uncomfortable, but he didn’t seem aware.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Jamie	The light slowly faded until the hallway was black. Then it was silver, a tiny, dim reflection from the moon that was just enough, as my eyes adjusted, to see the man and the boy beside me. [MASK] edged closer to me as the night wore on.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Ian	A big yawn interrupted his sentence. “Next time she raids, I’m coming, too.” “She’s not going out again,” [MASK] answered, his body tensing. I brushed my hand against his face, trying to soothe him.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Jamie	I was not surprised that [MASK] had crept back and slept beside me last night. Maybe it was the change in my breathing that woke him; maybe it was just that our schedules had become synchronized. But seconds after I was conscious, he gave a little gasp.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ian	It’s not fair to ask her things the way we’d ask each other. We stop to think about ourselves. She doesn’t.” It was quiet. No one answered [MASK]. The silence dragged on until I felt compelled to speak for myself.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Doc	I gagged and then shuddered at the image. “It makes me sick, too,” he admitted. “[MASK] gets real bent out of shape. Every time he thinks he’s got it cracked, it goes south again.
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Jamie	My throat thickened, felt oddly swollen. [MASK] patted my face, calling my attention back. I was surprised at how big his hand felt on my cheek. “They let me come on the raid to get you.” “I know,” I muttered.
<name>Spensa</name>	Spensa	Jared	“Lies, of course,” [MASK] whispered back. I could just barely make out their words. They probably didn’t realize how the sound echoed back to me in here. “Only ... I can’t quite figure out what it wants us to believe — where it’s trying to lead us.”
<name>Wanderer</name>	Wanderer	Walter	I would have hidden, too, if [MASK] hadn’t needed me. I was all alone in my head — exactly what I had once wanted. It made me feel lost. Eventually, a dim gray light started to creep in through the high vents overhead.
<name>Oyeronke</name>	Oyeronke	Mel	I was belatedly surprised that the sleeping arrangements by the jeep today had not elicited a reaction from her. [MASK]? No answer. It wasn’t like before, so I didn’t panic. I could definitely feel her there in my head, but she was . . .
<name>Wylan</name>	Wylan	Kevin	The Healer looked down without answering. “What events?” I demanded again. “I believe I have a right to know.” The Healer sighed. “You do. [MASK] . . . physically attacked a Healer while not. . . himself.”
<name>Adrian</name>	Adrian	Jeb	He winked at me, bowed from the waist, and walked away. ♦ Just because I now understood [MASK]’s plan, it didn’t make things easier when he escalated it. He never took the gun anywhere anymore.
<name>Lila</name>	Lila	Wanda	They still would have caught me in the first place, [MASK]. I led them here, not you. I was too miserable to answer her. Besides, if we hadn’t come here, ]amie would be dead.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Ian	“Run . .. its . . . course.” I murmured the words in a daze. “Eat something,” [MASK] urged. “You’ll worry him if he sees you like this.” I rubbed my eyes, trying to think straight.
<name>Olivia</name>	Olivia	Jeb	“Here we are,” [MASK] said enthusiastically, pulling me through the archway. “What do you think?” Visited The heat hit me first — like a wall of steam, the moist, thick air rolled over me and dewed on my skin.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Doc	They were careful not to touch either of us. “Just the length of the scar. That will be enough.” This didn’t seem like enough to him. “You sure?” “Yes. Oh, wait!” [MASK] pulled back.
<name>Jeb</name>	Jeb	Jeb	Can’t you see that?” He stabbed the barrel of the gun toward me, and I cringed away. “She’s no Seeker, this one.” “Shut up, [MASK], just shut up! ”
<name>Rowan</name>	Rowan	Ian	[MASK] paused and leaned closer to me so that I couldn’t seem to see anything around his face, just snow and sapphire and ink. “That maybe you should make the most of what time you have? That you should live while you’re alive?”
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Jared	[MASK]’s lips came down on mine, hard. My eyes flew open in shock. His gold-flecked eyes were open, too, half an inch away. She jerked our head back. “Cut that out! Don’t touch her! ”
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Doc	They darted around the room until she found me, and recognition was quickly followed by a scowl. She looked away, back to [MASK]. “ Well, it feels good to have my head back,” she said in a loud, clear voice.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Ian	He needs you. Then why aren’t we with him? Because he’s probably a bit young to watch this kind of thing. She searched through some more. Wow, [MASK], too. I’m glad I missed that part. I was so worried.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Doc	[MASK] had promised to wait for me. Would that first dose of painkiller wear off soon? My head swam. There was so much to worry about, and I was so tired. The adrenaline had drained, leaving me empty.
