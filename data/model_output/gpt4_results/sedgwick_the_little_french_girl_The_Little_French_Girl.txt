<name>he</name>	he	Giles	She looked more of a child, seen in this setting, than [MASK] had ever seen her look. Her silence was childlike; and her attitude, leaning slightly against her mother, her chair placed a little behind her.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Giles	“Only by constant care do we keep her with us. And now it is time for the little afternoon nap.” The old lady, muttering something about chicory and hygiene, signified her readiness to withdraw and [MASK] assisted her daughter in hoisting her upon her feet.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Giles	In his astonishment [MASK] relinquished his clasp and fixed his broken gaze upon her. “On that first day. When I went to see her. She told me that she could understand the wish to be a nun. She told me that you had them in your Church.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Alix	“ This is the most extraordinary nonsense! Happiness! With another woman! With [MASK]’s mother! She’s old enough to be mine if it comes to that; and as to marrying me — she’d as soon think of marrying a Chinaman.
<name>She</name>	She	Alix	But when he asked her like that, there in the study, with the gas-fire and the untidy heaped books and the Greek temples and the foolish animals on the mantelpiece, [MASK] did not feel so sure.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alix	No; I did not see what I was leaping to, but I saw plainly what I left. And I do not say that I regret. All that I do say is that I wish no leaps for [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Toppie	“I think she does like me. He liked me. It would always be that for [MASK], wouldn’t it? And then I can give her more about him. We talked of that, too. Things she didn’t know.”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Alix	What right have you to call yourself a Catholic? ” “I have been baptized,” said [MASK]. “I have been confirmed. I go to confession, and to Mass, at least at Easter. Most certainly I am a Catholic.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Giles	Wandering in and out with [MASK], the beauty of the town, with its significance, stole upon her mind and senses. Meditative, benign, and so humane, it seemed to smile at you like an old ecclesiastic with kindly eyes for youth.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Toppie	He looked at the scene and was not consciously absorbed in thought; but a process of testing, of reestablishing, went on within him as if he felt about his roots to see that they were firm. He would have need of firmness, and the figure of [MASK] went with him as an exorcising presence.
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Giles	They were simply two girls engaged in a pastime delightful to them both; and [MASK] surmised that such easy intercourse was perhaps only possible in a country where caste was a thing so impassable that intimacy lent itself to no misinterpretation.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Giles	“I do not think that for a French town it has special beauty; yet, seen like this, with the harbours, and the wharves, and houses — all so golden, do you not think it is very lovely? ” [MASK] had just been thinking so.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jerry	“I’m awfully glad to find you here, of course; but you know what I feel about cake and bread-and-butter, and I should like you to eat the full slice. How was the Blue Boy costume? [MASK] told me about that.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mummy	None of us, except perhaps [MASK], have ever meant anything to her. She’s not got much heart, if you ask my opinion. Or, at all events, only heart enough for one person.” “How did you find her?”
<name>Stiva</name>	Stiva	Giles	Only my Church would not allow me to marry a heretic unless I promised about the children. It is simply not allowed with us, [MASK]. — Do you not know? ” “But why not turn heretic yourself, and settle the children like that?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alix	As if they would have been friends. But of course what we most wanted to hear was about [MASK]’s mother. Tell me everything now; everything you thought.” “Everything. Well, that’s rather difficult, you know.”
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Alix	— “I will avoid dancing with him,” thought [MASK]. “He is too stout and he brushes his hair up over his head from behind so that it shall not be seen how bald he is.”
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Giles	She saw now that [MASK]’s large eyes were dwelling upon her from a distance; but they were not like the other eyes. They kept their look of thoughtfulness. He was not seeing her in the magic. He was only seeing her as herself.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Alix	“And for yourself, which do you feel the greater difficulty, [MASK]; — your country or your religion? You never strike me as having any religion at all, you know. You always seem to me, as I told you long ago, just a little pagan.”
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Alix	And now all her light was withdrawn. It was the end, as that had been the beginning. Pale, wraith-like in the dusk, she fixed her eyes upon him and they were dark with their repudiation. “[MASK] is not the product of her mother.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Toppie	This was so much better than talking about the dead. — “You mean a priest could not? We are quite different about that, too. But I see what you mean” — [MASK]’s eyes dwelt on her — “and sometimes I think that you are right.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Giles	She who, for herself, has chosen the path of freedom, should have more courage for her child.” “Isn’t it something of a criticism of the path of freedom that she doesn’t choose it for her child?” [MASK] felt himself impelled to comment.
<name>Stiva</name>	Stiva	Giles	“What I’d like to ask you, if I may,” said [MASK], “is what you feel for mistress number one when mistress number two has deposed her; and what you feel for number two when you are devoting yourself to number three.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Maman	It gave me the strangest feeling; like [MASK] sometimes. And her lovely, small things; like the little pinks and campan- ulas that grow along the banks; so sweet and tiny; and little mesanges with bright blue heads, hanging upside down in the birches.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Alix	“You know she said — funny little darling — that the children would have to be Catholics. Not that I’d care a rap. — Only, it does somehow make everything more difficult.” “It certainly does. [MASK] has all her objections.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alix	Was she unfaithful to her husband? ” “There were faults on both sides, I believe. [MASK] wouldn’t have been given for half the time to her mother if there hadn’t been faults on both sides.”
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Alix	A great many gables, a great many creepers, large windows open to the air. A kind, capacious house, promising comfort; but how ugly, thought [MASK], as they alighted; “Combien peu interessante.”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Giles	You would love her, too, [MASK], if you knew her He had turned, while she spoke, and was looking at her and, lifting her head, she met his eyes and saw how deeply she had touched him.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Giles	[MASK] felt it cruel to ask the further question that came to him, yet he wondered if she had not, often, asked it of herself. “He consents to go, then, because he is hopeless?” She had, indeed, often asked it.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Giles	You did not know?” “No, ” said [MASK], “I didn’t know that. I thought it was only the once.” He stopped. He stopped for a long time after saying this and suddenly she saw the blood mounting to his face.
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Alix	When they passed into the open country the buffs and cinnamons and mole-colours of the fields and uplands were all powdered to paleness. The beauty of the day was like a promise, but [MASK] felt it like a farewell.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Giles	As if by some deep instinct she knew that her destiny had been in question that afternoon. “But do come with us, [MASK],” she now said, and he replied that he really had letters he ought to write. “Letters home.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Alix	“[MASK], do you remember, long ago, you promised me that you would never tell me a lie? ” he said. Not unclosing her lips she nodded. He had glanced at her and met her eyes, but he could not read her look.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Giles	so wanted him — to see and understand. “Let me tell you, [MASK]. When one loves her, that is what one fears for her — those great leaps down from the rocks. So iplendid; so bright and splendid; but so dangerous.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alix	“I am afraid not,” [MASK] owned. “I am afraid I do not take heaven seriously either. But I did not tell her that. It might have grieved her. It always seems to me that we must go out like blown candles, when we are dead.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Jerry	Well, I’d like to do that, you know. I like you to think me worthy of her even if I’m not. I leave it in your hands, then,” said [MASK], getting off the table and turning his head away while he stared before him.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Toppie	She had seen that [MASK] liked her and she had foreseen that she would question her. But as she felt the pressure of her longing she knew how little she could satisfy it. “I think I remember him best of all as I first saw him,” she said, searching her thoughts.
<name>Gisèle</name>	Gisèle	Alix	And though she still kept her French scepticism about marriage, the half-unconscious climax of a long process of change within [MASK] was reached when she added in her own thought: “How sad to be married to someone who is not part of yourself.”
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Corot	The young man in white flashed a smile round at her as he drove. “ [MASK] would see its intimacy, its charm, rather than its gravity. That great design against the sky; — no; we must find somebody else.”
<name>Winifred</name>	Winifred	Ruth	“Oh, well, of course you play tennis,” [MASK] was saying. “Everybody plays tennis. But you must learn hockey at once. It’s the great game at our school and you’re nowhere unless you play it.
<name>Henri</name>	Henri	Andre	I see the happy gentle touches of his brush.” “Elle a raison,” said the young man with the dark square head, and [MASK], driving with his easy skill, waved a hand of contented concession.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Giles	“And it’s true, you say?” ■*Not exactly as she put it, I gather; but true enough. Since it is true enough, it’s better, I suppose, that it came out as soon as possible,” said [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alix	It was strange to hear her say, “my mother,” and pitiful. Her voice was strange; yet he knew, in seeing her, that he, too, whatever her sufferings might be, must count upon [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jerry	“Was that why you thought I’d never guess, even if I saw your letter to [MASK]?” “I did not think you would ever guess.” “I didn’t. I never dreamed there was a chance for me; never dreamed it.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alix	And yet, more than the femme du monde she made him think of the mountain torrent — [MASK] had been right — in its strength, its splendour, and its danger, too. And he knew that he did not like dangerous women.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Giles	“[MASK],” she said suddenly. “What?” He put down his book at once. He, too, was not really reading. Perhaps his heart was trembling, too. “May I say one thing more?” “All right.”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Toppie	He can give her the crystal dress and the prancing steed and the dancing to flutes and cymbals. — Oh, you know perfectly well, [MASK], darling, all the things I can never give her and that she loves with all her heart.
<name>Verena</name>	Verena	Alix	He had felt that day that he would fight her fate for her, and he felt now that the moment had come for the first grapple. But the worst of the problem was that in fighting [MASK]’s fate he must fight her.
<name>Osmond</name>	Osmond	Giles	Yes; — but I am a mother!” “It must be all the harder,” said [MASK]. “You consent to see yourself belittled in her eyes. And you consent to live without her.”
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Toppie	[MASK] would never ask him a question. The past was over; not forgotten; but over. That was what her departure, her silence, had won for them. She could not, at that past time, have kept herself from pressing against the swords of every fullest realization.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Giles	As her piercing intuition on the day among the birch-woods had led her to the portals of the truth, so now it had led her to its heart. She saw at last, truly, what [MASK] had done; she no longer misunderstood him.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Giles	“But that is what good friends ask,” he said. “To be taken advantage of.” “You speak for yourself, [MASK]. There are others besides you. You have no right to speak for them.”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Alix	Now, if other things should fail her,” said [MASK], “she will know that I am there to be depended upon.” And with the words it was as if he saw her go forward and take the tragic unveiled figure by the hand.
<name>Georges</name>	Georges	Andre	She had said no word as yet, but as they emerged into the sunny place she remarked that she had to buy a baba-au-rhum for tea and asked [MASK] to drive them across to the pdtissier’s.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Alix	“No; my father was his son; his only child.” “But you and your mother were often with him?” “Only I. He liked having me alone.” [MASK] did not require consideration to find an answer.
<name>Orual</name>	Orual	Giles	There it sits, on a branch, and stares into the darkness. It is pitiful.” A silence fell for a while after that, and [MASK] heard in it the echoes of the compassionate voice beating softly against each heart.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Alix	“Oh, I am glad of that,” said [MASK], smiling and pass- mg by his allusion to her return. “And there, in the beautiful rooms, you’ll teach philosophy for the rest of your life?” “Well, I expect I shall.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Jerry	“Oh — I’d rather it had never come out at all,” [MASK] objected. “It makes no difference to me. I don’t care a hang about ancestors and all that sort of thing, and I expect we’ve plenty of rotters among our own.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Toppie	— And with his bird-glasses. He would have been watching birds. I see it all,” said [MASK], her eyes before her. “And then?” “Then he came to see us every day.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Alix	“When [MASK] returned to me, when I saw what I had done to her, I knew that it was time.” He could not think of one thing to say to her; not one word of comfort or approbation.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Alix	PART II PART II CHAPTER I “ C’est la Francesaid [MASK]. She leaned beside him on the railing of the Channel steamer and looked through the blue of the July day to where the town thinly shaped itself, like a line of grey-white shells floating between sea and sky.
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Jerry	But she did mind. Since the moment that she had seen his eyes fixed upon her from the stairs she had minded, not because she cared for [MASK], but because she cared, intensely, that he should care for her.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Toppie	“ It’s too beautifully done,” said [MASK]. “How did you manage from memory?” “I drew the doves one day, quickly, when you went out, and the colours are easy to carry in one’s head. I am glad you like it.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Maman	But if all this were so natural, why had she felt that touch of artifice in [MASK]’s manner, that resource in her so many reasons? Perhaps they did not really want her. And perhaps there was some mistake and they did not expect her tonight.
<name>Philippa</name>	Philippa	Alix	“But then the saints were like that; wise and quiet and incapable of anger.” [MASK] had never cared at all about the saints, and it was strange to feel that this heretic lady, creedless and uncloistered, made them more real and more lovable to her.
<name>Godfrey</name>	Godfrey	Giles	“I said I must be back here for your time at home.” “That was awfully sweet of you, my dear child,” said [MASK], who walked about, looking very tall in his new grey tweeds.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Maman	For though, by chance currents, such other aspects of the story as a child may apprehend came drifting to her, the first picture of harsh repudiation made a background to the later knowledge, and she saw [MASK] as a delicate flower or fruit crushed and broken between stony hands.
<name>Willoughby</name>	Willoughby	Giles	Away from the jungle; and away from the citadel, too. “Damn it!” [MASK] heard himself remarking as he marched towards the verandah. “It thinks itself too good for her and she’s too good for it. She shall belong to us.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Giles	“She is so old, so very old, monsieur,” she added, casting a glance of proud possessorship upon [MASK]. “Only by constant care do we keep her with us. And now it is time for the little afternoon nap.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alix	And she had probably herself made the dresses she and [MASK] wore. She could be extravagant if the money were there; if it were not, she was careful. One felt in her the essential freedom from material bondage.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Jerry	“Yes,” he said, then, slowly. “I suppose they are quite decent. Only Frenchmen are different, you know.” He felt [MASK] scanning his face. “You mean that no decent Frenchman would think of marrying her?”
<name>Ursula</name>	Ursula	Alix	Left alone, [MASK] went out to her favourite walk, the little path under the garden wall, half obliterated by heather and grass, its bordering gorse bushes all broken into soft clusters of gold set in prickles and smelling of apricots.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Giles	She had taken off her hat, and [MASK] for the first time saw her bareheaded. She stood there, looking at them, a little preoccupied, her hat hanging against her dress as she held it, and the sun flickered in upon her high-wreathed russet hair.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Alix	I told him to come; — it was but the other day. — I told him that it was best that they should meet, and that I would help him. And [MASK] intercepted the letter. Yes; — you may well stare.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Maman	[MASK] had replied that it made no difference at all as far as an individual, at large, as it were, unattached and irresponsible in a foreign country, was concerned; but that it did make a difference, all the difference, when it came to the family itself and its milieu.
<name>Effi</name>	Effi	Alix	A faint flush rose in [MASK]’s cheeks. “He did not please me in the way he behaved. It could not have happened like that with us. — Our way, I think, is a better way.” “How did he behave?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alix	Write to [MASK], of course; write constantly. Tell her all about it; your feelings, you know, and what you think about her eyes. — You both care for the same things: riding; out of doors; fancy-dress balls, and the ‘Hymn of Pan.’
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Alix	Why impossible since you care for him? ” “Because it would not be happy,” said [MASK], who felt, evidently, no uncertainty. “It would have been an unsuitable marriage before, when mine were the only objections; it is much less suitable now.
<name>Razumov</name>	Razumov	Toppie	“I like it very much.” [MASK] kept her hand, turning her round. “I like seeing your forehead, such a gentle, thoughtful forehead. I like that big black bow at your neck.”
<name>Therese</name>	Therese	Toppie	He seemed to see, as her eyes dwelt on him, what [MASK] would look like as a very old nun. Not so different from now. Nuns had changeless faces. “He loved me,” she said. “But not as I loved him.
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Jerry	The earth was new, seen from this height; one looked into the branches of the beeches at the level where the chaffinches were perching and flitting. “You sit as if you were born to it,” [MASK] told her, and she replied that her father had been a great horse- man.
<name>Sebastian</name>	Sebastian	Jerry	If one gives freedom, one must expect the unforeseen, must one not? — She was very kind. She said she had thought of me and [MASK] as playmates, and that I was right to say to him that we were far, far too young.
<name>Elinor</name>	Elinor	Toppie	She was too fond of pleasure, perhaps; but she is so merry and amusing that one can forgive her that.” “Very much too fond, I am afraid,” said [MASK], colouring above her knitting.
<name>Miles</name>	Miles	Alix	That does offend it. That is one of the reasons, as I have said, for his consent to our parting. It is not a reason, if he stayed, that could repress his heart.” “Couldn’t [MASK] be trusted to do that?”
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Alix	The safe life. The respected life. She’d rather that [MASK] should marry one of their sons than be the most wonderful of actresses.” “It may be so. Gifted and sagacious people have their weaknesses.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Giles	“Forgive me. We will speak of it no more.” “But you’ve spoken of it beautifully. I’m glad to have you know,” said [MASK], and the strange sense that this was so made part of his amazement.
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Jerry	“You’d make her happier than I should,” said [MASK], swinging his foot and looking a little as if he might cry. “You’re much more the ideal English lover than I am. Carry her off from him; for yourself.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Andre	That was the way she began; those the very first words she said after she had led him in, after their long silence, when they found themselves alone together. The throb of [MASK]’s car had long since faded down the lane.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Alix	“ But I believe that in this country everybody is fonder of sons,” thought [MASK], marvelling at the reappearance of the strange cabbage cut into squares and recalling impressions of English literature where, despite romantic surfaces, it was apparent to the discerning eye that men always counted for more than women.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Toppie	Do you find fault with it?” They had reached the road that wound among the birch-woods and dusk had fallen in it. The sky, paled to a faint apricot tint, shone dimly between the trees. [MASK] stood still on the wayside grass and looked at him.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Giles	Let the whole thing rest for ever.” Her eyes were on his while he spoke to her and she listened to him gently; but her face still kept the invulnerable look strange in one so young. “You are kind, dear [MASK],” she said.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Mummy	“Do you think she’s telling the truth?” he then questioned. “Isn’t it still possible that it’s all her pride? If [MASK] could have written to say I was coming and that she gave me her blessing — mightn’t it have been different? ”
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Maman	“Oh, I’m so sorry, dear,” she would exclaim; but [MASK] would have commented, dryly, that a woman so much occupied had better breakfast in bed and get through her correspondence out of sight.
<name>Rachel</name>	Rachel	Alix	A pleasant, heathery common dipping at its further edge to a birch-wood. That was all. And another gabled roof rose among pines on a near hillside. All comfort; no beauty, thought [MASK], and the sky came so closely down that it made her feel suffocated.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Giles	A man of honour will do all in his power for the woman who has been dear to him; who may still be dear. Affection and trust may still be there, though passion has burned itself away.” “That must fill your time,” [MASK] muttered, “pretty considerably.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Toppie	[MASK] said not a word. She stood there, her smile vanished, holding the book, and watched her as she crossed the room to the sofa and sank down upon it. Then, after a moment, she laid down the book and followed her.
<name>Ibsen</name>	Ibsen	Racine	Nothing so trivial and intimate as a bee could be imagined in any play of [MASK]’s; yet its soft drone had accompanied her sense of a pause, of an ominous interlude, like the pause before a scene where the heroine was to enter with some quiet, conclusive word.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Giles	Unready as she must feel herself to face this further predicament, [MASK] heard the muffled murmur of her voice, rising, falling, expostulating; urgent, tender, invulnerable. She would find answers to everything. Or was it that there were some questions her child would not ask of her?
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Jerry	“Well, you mustn’t ask me to say that she would!” [MASK] laughed out at this. He got up as he spoke and went to the mantelpiece, picking up and examining one of the horrid little china animals thereon. But he was not seeing it.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Giles	That life, for a vivid, vigorous nature such as hers, would be, I should imagine, bornee; fade.” “I don’t see why it should,” said [MASK]. “But I wasn’t thinking of country ladies, or of marriage at all.
