<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Edna	She was endeavoring to adjust the bunch of violets which had become loose from its fastening in her hair. [MASK] drew her down upon the sofa, and taking a pin from her own hair, secured the shabby artificial flowers in their accustomed place. “Aren't you astonished?”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Arobin	[MASK] found her with rolled sleeves, working in company with the house-maid when he looked in during the afternoon. She was splendid and robust, and had never appeared handsomer than in the old blue gown, with a red silk handkerchief knotted at random around her head to protect her hair from the dust.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Robert	“Yes; down there in front. He seems to be getting ready to drive away somewhere.” “Call him.” Clatter, clatter! [MASK] uttered a shrill, piercing whistle which might have been heard back at the wharf. “He won't look up.”
<name>Aylmer</name>	Aylmer	Arobin	People turned their heads to look at her, and more than one lent an attentive ear to her utterances, hoping thereby to secure the elusive but ever-desired “tip.” [MASK] caught the contagion of excitement which drew him to
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Robert	Still she was not astonished when, as she was partaking of a modest dinner late in the afternoon, looking into an open book, stroking the cat, which had made friends with her--she was not greatly astonished to see [MASK] come in at the tall garden gate.
<name>Mathilde</name>	Mathilde	Edna	“It seems to me the utmost folly for a woman at the head of a household, and the mother of children, to spend in an atelier days which would be better employed contriving for the comfort of her family.” “I feel like painting,” answered [MASK].
<name>Montgomery</name>	Montgomery	Arobin	“There are so many inquisitive people and institutions abounding,” said [MASK], “that one is really forced as a matter of convenience these days to assume the virtue of an occupation if he has it not.”
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Robert	she entreated. “I will, thank you. Good-by.” How unlike [MASK]! The merest acquaintance would have said something more emphatic than “I will, thank you; good-by,” to such a request.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Edna	I shall only take a hand-bag, and shall pack my trunk in the city.” He turned to answer some question put to him by his mother, and [MASK], having finished her black coffee, left the table. She went directly to her room.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Arobin	“And you ask me why I call it a coup d'etat?” [MASK] had put on his coat, and he stood before her and asked if his cravat was plumb. She told him it was, looking no higher than the tip of his collar.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Arobin	“Then, all things considered,” spoke [MASK], “it might not be amiss to start out by drinking the Colonel's health in the cocktail which he composed, on the birthday of the most charming of women--the daughter whom he invented.”
<name>He</name>	He	Mandelet	After a moment or two she uttered a profound sigh and wiped her face with the handkerchief rolled in a ball. She appeared exhausted. The nurse gave her a fresh handkerchief, sprinkled with cologne water. “This is too much!” she cried. “[MASK] ought to be killed!
<name>Lucullus</name>	Lucullus	Leonce	Why do you call it the 'coup d'etat?' Oh! it will be very fine; all my best of everything--crystal, silver and gold, Sevres, flowers, music, and champagne to swim in. I'll let [MASK] pay the bills.
<name>Osmond</name>	Osmond	Arobin	She kept the young woman occupied in the drawing-room, unwilling to be left alone with [MASK]. “What about the dinner?” he asked; “the grand event, the coup d'etat?” “It will be day after to-morrow.
<name>Mathilde</name>	Mathilde	Edna	“Where are you going?” asked [MASK], seeing that her husband arose from table without having eaten a morsel except a taste of the highly-seasoned soup. “I'm going to get my dinner at the club. Good night.”
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Mademoiselle	There have been so many things--” he turned the leaves of [MASK]'s music nervously. “I started in at once yesterday with the old firm. After all there is as much chance for me here as there was there--that is, I might find it profitable some day.
<name>Harris</name>	Harris	Celestine	“The servants are all gone. They left when the musicians did. I have dismissed them. The house has to be closed and locked, and I shall trot around to the pigeon house, and shall send [MASK] over in the morning to straighten things up.”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Joe	“Bring the tray with the cards, [MASK]. I don't remember who was here.” The boy retired and returned after a moment, bringing the tiny silver tray, which was covered with ladies' visiting cards.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Edna	but he knew his Creole too well to make such a blunder as that. He did not resume his book immediately, but sat for a while meditatively looking out into the garden. XXIII [MASK]'s father was in the city, and had been with them several days.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Edna	[MASK] seated herself with every appearance of discomfort. “Are you tired?” he asked. “Yes, and chilled, and miserable. I feel as if I had been wound up to a certain pitch--too tight--and something inside of me had snapped.”
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Edna	The quadroon was following them with little quick steps, having assumed a fictitious animation and alacrity for the occasion. A fruit vender was crying his wares in the street. [MASK] looked straight before her with a self-absorbed expression upon her face.
<name>Adèle</name>	Adèle	Robert	It was you who awoke me last summer out of a life-long, stupid dream. Oh! you have made me so unhappy with your indifference. Oh! I have suffered, suffered! Now you are here we shall love each other, my [MASK].
<name>Monte</name>	Monte	Mademoiselle	Isn't that enough reason?” “They are your husband's,” returned [MASK], with a shrug and a malicious elevation of the eyebrows. “Oh! I see there is no deceiving you. Then let me tell you: It is a caprice.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Robert	She read a letter from her sister, who was away in the East, and who had engaged herself to be married. [MASK] was interested, and wanted to know what manner of girls the sisters were, what the father was like, and how long the mother had been dead.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Mademoiselle	But the very passions themselves were aroused within her soul, swaying it, lashing it, as the waves daily beat upon her splendid body. She trembled, she was choking, and the tears blinded her. [MASK] had finished.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Adele	[MASK] is full of whims at such times. There were a dozen women she might have had with her, unimpressionable women. I felt that it was cruel, cruel. You shouldn't have gone.” “Oh, well!” she answered, indifferently.
<name>Alcée</name>	Alcée	Victor	The afternoon was already well advanced. [MASK] escorted her out upon the banquette, lifted her parasol, and held it over her while he walked to the car with her. He entreated her to bear in mind that the disclosures of the afternoon were strictly confidential.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Edna	His tobacco pouch, which he laid upon the table, was a fantastic embroidered silk affair, evidently the handiwork of a woman. “You used to carry your tobacco in a rubber pouch,” said [MASK], picking up the pouch and examining the needlework.
<name>Leonce</name>	Leonce	Robert	She was flushed and felt intoxicated with the sound of her own voice and the unaccustomed taste of candor. It muddled her like wine, or like a first breath of freedom. There was the sound of approaching voices. It was [MASK], surrounded by a troop of children, searching for them.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Edna	She was hungry again, for the Highcamp dinner, though of excellent quality, had lacked abundance. She rummaged in the larder and brought forth a slice of Gruyere and some crackers. She opened a bottle of beer which she found in the icebox. [MASK] felt extremely restless and excited.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Arobin	Much to her surprise she received a note from [MASK], written at midnight from the club. It was to say good morning to her, to hope she had slept well, to assure her of his devotion, which he trusted she in some faintest manner returned.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Edna	[MASK] was neither tired nor sleepy. She was hungry again, for the Highcamp dinner, though of excellent quality, had lacked abundance. She rummaged in the larder and brought forth a slice of Gruyere and some crackers. She opened a bottle of beer which she found in the icebox.
<name>Evelyn</name>	Evelyn	Mademoiselle	[MASK] played a soft interlude. It was an improvisation. She sat low at the instrument, and the lines of her body settled into ungraceful curves and angles that gave it an appearance of deformity. Gradually and imperceptibly the interlude melted into the soft opening minor chords of the Chopin Impromptu.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Robert	She has spoiled him into the worthless creature he is. She worships him and the ground he walks on. [MASK] is very well in a way, to give up all the money he can earn to the family, and keep the barest pittance for himself.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Edna	Are you not coming down? Come on, dear; it doesn't look friendly.” “No,” said [MASK], a little sullenly. “I can't go to the trouble of dressing again; I don't feel like it.”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Edna	“Won't you wait for her?” asked [MASK]. “Not if you think she will not be back till late,” adding, as if suddenly aware of some discourtesy in his speech, “and I should miss the pleasure of walking home with you.”
<name>Edgar</name>	Edgar	Edna	She arose, and bowing her stiff, lofty bow, she went away, stopping for neither thanks nor applause. As she passed along the gallery she patted [MASK] upon the shoulder. “Well, how did you like my music?” she asked.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Mariequita	“I'm very hungry; but don't get anything extra.” “I'll have it ready in little or no time,” he said, bustling and packing away his tools. “You may go to my room to brush up and rest yourself. [MASK] will show you.”
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Edna	“Oh! unkind! malicious! Why did you not tell me?” “That he was coming back? No great news, ma foi. I wonder he did not come long ago.” “But when, when?” cried [MASK], impatiently.
<name>Mrs. Sommers</name>	Mrs. Sommers	Edna	[MASK]'s round mahogany would have almost filled it. As it was there was but a step or two from the little table to the kitchen, to the mantel, the small buffet, and the side door that opened out on the narrow brick-paved yard.
<name>Clayton</name>	Clayton	Edna	“Did they embroider slippers and tobacco pouches and hat-bands and things for you?” asked [MASK]. “Oh! my! no! I didn't get so deep in their regard. I fear they made more impression on me than I made on them.”
<name>Clayton</name>	Clayton	Edna	A black woman, wiping her hands upon her apron, was close at his heels. Before she saw them [MASK] could hear them in altercation, the woman--plainly an anomaly--claiming the right to be allowed to perform her duties, one of which was to answer the bell.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Edna	That night [MASK] dined alone. The candelabra, with a few candles in the center of the table, gave all the light she needed. Outside the circle of light in which she sat, the large dining-room looked solemn and shadowy.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Robert	[MASK] was not waiting for her in the little parlor. He was nowhere at hand. The house was empty. But he had scrawled on a piece of paper that lay in the lamplight: “I love you. Good-by--because I love you.”
<name>Thornfield</name>	Thornfield	Robert	In some unaccountable way they had escaped from [MASK]. The walk to the beach was no inconsiderable one, consisting as it did of a long, sandy path, upon which a sporadic and tangled growth that bordered it on either side made frequent and unexpected inroads.
<name>Mrs. Sommers</name>	Mrs. Sommers	Mademoiselle	Her clothes were dripping with moisture. She felt chilled and pinched as she entered the room. [MASK] was poking at a rusty stove that smoked a little and warmed the room indifferently. She was endeavoring to heat a pot of chocolate on the stove.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Edna	“This will do,” he replied. He put on his soft hat and nervously took it off again, and wiping his face with his handkerchief, complained of the heat. “Take the fan,” said [MASK], offering it to him.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Edna	There's always enough for two--even three.” [MASK] had intended to be indifferent and as reserved as he when she met him; she had reached the determination by a laborious train of reasoning, incident to one of her despondent moods.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Robert	Somewhat later [MASK] came up, carrying his hand-bag. “Aren't you feeling well?” he asked. “Oh, well enough. Are you going right away?” He lit a match and looked at his watch. “In twenty minutes,” he said.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Edna	So it was he who in turn mounted the ladder, unhooking pictures and curtains, and dislodging ornaments as [MASK] directed. When he had finished he took off his dust-cap and went out to wash his hands.
<name>John</name>	John	Robert	Then she went across the room to where he sat. She bent over the arm of his chair and called his name. “[MASK],” she said, “are you asleep?” “No,” he answered, looking up at her.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Robert	[MASK], she should in the first place have declined, and in the second place have followed in obedience to one of the two contradictory impulses which impelled her. A certain light was beginning to dawn dimly within her,--the light which, showing the way, forbids it.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Edna	A general air of surprise and genuine satisfaction fell upon every one as they saw the pianist enter. There was a settling down, and a prevailing air of expectancy everywhere. [MASK] was a trifle embarrassed at being thus signaled out for the imperious little woman's favor.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Edna	“You were not so very far, my dear; I was watching you,” he told her. [MASK] went at once to the bath-house, and she had put on her dry clothes and was ready to return home before the others had left the water.
<name>Flora</name>	Flora	Beaudelet	[MASK]'s lugger, that she had come alone, and for no purpose but to rest. “There's nothing fixed up yet, you see. I'll give you my room; it's the only place.” “Any corner will do,” she assured him.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Edna	She was endeavoring to heat a pot of chocolate on the stove. The room looked cheerless and dingy to [MASK] as she entered. A bust of Beethoven, covered with a hood of dust, scowled at her from the mantelpiece. “Ah! here comes the sunlight!”
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Edna	A flush overspread his whole face. “I couldn't believe that my letters would be of any interest to you.” “That is an excuse; it isn't the truth.” [MASK] reached for her hat on the piano.
<name>Mrs. Ramsay</name>	Mrs. Ramsay	Edna	It was with a wrench and a pang that [MASK] left her children. She carried away with her the sound of their voices and the touch of their cheeks. All along the journey homeward their presence lingered with her like the memory of a delicious song.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Edna	Then she went in and assisted the quadroon in getting the boys to bed. They were very playful and inclined to talk--to do anything but lie quiet and go to sleep. [MASK] sent the quadroon away to her supper and told her she need not return.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Edna	The mosquito bar was drawn over her; the old woman had come in while she slept and let down the bar. [MASK] arose quietly from the bed, and looking between the curtains of the window, she saw by the slanting rays of the sun that the afternoon was far advanced.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Robert	[MASK] had pursued a system of lessons almost daily; and he was nearly at the point of discouragement in realizing the futility of his efforts. A certain ungovernable dread hung about her when in the water, unless there was a hand near by that might reach out and reassure her.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Edna	She realized that she had neglected her reading, and determined to start anew upon a course of improving studies, now that her time was completely her own to do with as she liked. After a refreshing bath, [MASK] went to bed.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Edna	But for the past few days the old gentleman had been upon [MASK]'s hands, and in his society she was becoming acquainted with a new set of sensations. He had been a colonel in the Confederate army, and still maintained, with the title, the military bearing which had always accompanied it.
<name>Henrietta</name>	Henrietta	Edna	He was accustomed to them at such times, and was too well convinced of her loyalty to doubt it. He was glad to see [MASK], and wanted her to go with him into the salon and entertain him.
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Edna	“Perhaps I shall be able to paint your picture some day,” said [MASK] with a smile when they were seated. She produced the roll of sketches and started to unfold them. “I believe I ought to work again. I feel as if I wanted to be doing something.
<name>Lucie</name>	Lucie	Edna	Why have you introduced her at a moment when I desired to talk of you?” “Oh! talk of me if you like,” cried [MASK], clasping her hands beneath her head; “but let me think of something else while you do.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Robert	“I'm spoiling your dinner, [MASK]; never mind what I say. You haven't eaten a morsel.” “I only came in for a cup of coffee.” His sensitive face was all disfigured with excitement. “Isn't this a delightful place?”
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Edna	It was musical and true. The voice, the notes, the whole refrain haunted her memory. XV When [MASK] entered the dining-room one evening a little late, as was her habit, an unusually animated conversation seemed to be going on.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	XVI	The present alone was significant; was hers, to torture her as it was doing then with the biting conviction that she had lost that which she had held, that she had been denied that which her impassioned, newly awakened being demanded. [MASK] “Do you miss your friend greatly?”
<name>Almighty</name>	Almighty	Alphonse	Passez! Adieu! Allez vous-en!'” “Perhaps I feared to make [MASK] jealous,” she interjoined, with excessive naivete. That made them all laugh. The right hand jealous of the left! The heart jealous of the soul!
<name>Millicent</name>	Millicent	Edna	As [MASK] seated herself at table with them she thought, “Better a dinner of herbs,” though it did not take her long to discover that it was no dinner of herbs, but a delicious repast, simple, choice, and in every way satisfying.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Robert	“She knew that I adored her once, and she let me adore her. It was '[MASK], come; go; stand up; sit down; do this; do that; see if the baby sleeps; my thimble, please, that I left God knows where.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Edna	“Ah! si tu savais Ce que tes yeux me disent”-- “Oh! you mustn't! you mustn't,” exclaimed [MASK], and pushing back her chair she got up, and going behind him placed her hand over his mouth.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Edna	Her most intimate friend at school had been one of rather exceptional intellectual gifts, who wrote fine-sounding essays, which [MASK] admired and strove to imitate; and with her she talked and glowed over the English classics, and sometimes held religious and political controversies.
<name>Alcée</name>	Alcée	Robert	” asked [MASK], seating himself on the outer edge of one of the steps and taking hold of the hammock rope which was fastened to the post. “If you wish. Don't swing the hammock. Will you get my white shawl which
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Edna	[MASK] was not so consciously gratified at her husband's leaving home as she had been over the departure of her father. As the day approached when he was to leave her for a comparatively long stay, she grew melting and affectionate, remembering his many acts of consideration and his repeated expressions of an ardent attachment.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Victor	When she had finished the garland, she laid it lightly upon [MASK]'s black curls. He was reclining far back in the luxurious chair, holding a glass of champagne to the light. As if a magician's wand had touched him, the garland of roses transformed him into a vision of Oriental beauty.
<name>Olga</name>	Olga	Catiche	However, I don't mind walking. I always feel so sorry for women who don't like to walk; they miss so much--so many rare little glimpses of life; and we women learn so little of life on the whole. “[MASK]'s coffee is always hot.
<name>Phileas</name>	Phileas	Robert	“This afternoon,” returned [MASK], with a shade of annoyance. “At what time this afternoon?” persisted the old gentleman, with nagging determination, as if he were cross-questioning a criminal in a court of justice.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Robert	I don't remember what;--and he became so insulting and abusive that [MASK] gave him a thrashing on the spot that has kept him comparatively in order for a good while. It's about time he was getting another.”
<name>Lawrence</name>	Lawrence	Robert	“Oh! you know I want to stay if you will let me!” he exclaimed. All the softness came back. She laughed, and went and put her hand on his shoulder. “This is the first moment you have seemed like the old [MASK].
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Robert	“Do you know we have been together the whole livelong day, [MASK]--since early this morning?” she said at parting. “All but the hundred years when you were sleeping. Goodnight.” He pressed her hand and went away in the direction of the beach.
<name>Mooney</name>	Mooney	Ellen	She told him it was, looking no higher than the tip of his collar. “When do you go to the 'pigeon house?'--with all due acknowledgment to [MASK].” “Day after to-morrow, after the dinner. I shall sleep there.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Celestine	I don't know how she manages it, here in the open air. [MASK]'s coffee gets cold bringing it from the kitchen to the dining-room. Three lumps! How can you drink it so sweet? Take some of the cress with your chop; it's so biting and crisp.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Edna	With the other chubby fist he rubbed his eyes, which were heavy with sleep and ill humor. [MASK] took him in her arms, and seating herself in the rocker, began to coddle and caress him, calling him all manner of tender names, soothing him to sleep.
<name>Levin</name>	Levin	Edna	“I can't go to the trouble of dressing again; I don't feel like it.” “You needn't dress; you look all right; fasten a belt around your waist. Just look at me!” “No,” persisted [MASK]; “but you go on.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Edna	She talked about music. She hoped that [MASK] would go to see her in the city, and wrote her address with the stub of a pencil on a piece of card which she found in her pocket. “When do you leave?”
<name>Rosalie</name>	Rosalie	Robert	It began with “Ah! Si tu savais,” and every verse ended with “si tu savais.” [MASK]'s voice was not pretentious. It was musical and true. The voice, the notes, the whole refrain haunted her memory.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Edna	She was boiling mullets over a few red coals in the huge fireplace. [MASK], left alone in the little side room, loosened her clothes, removing the greater part of them. She bathed her face, her neck and arms in the basin that stood between the windows.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Edna	[MASK] bit her handkerchief convulsively, striving to hold back and to hide, even from herself as she would have hidden from another, the emotion which was troubling--tearing--her. Her eyes were brimming with tears.
<name>Gaspar</name>	Gaspar	Tonie	I am to take you back in [MASK]'s boat whenever you are ready to go.” He stirred the smoldering ashes till the broiled fowl began to sizzle afresh. He served her with no mean repast, dripping the coffee anew and sharing it with her.
<name>Heidi</name>	Heidi	Mademoiselle	“You will have to come to it, [MASK]. I will give you everything that you like to eat and to drink. We shall sing and laugh and be merry for once.” And she uttered a sigh that came from the very depths of her being.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Tonie	He was reading from a book. [MASK] was no longer with him. She wondered what had become of the rest of the party. She peeped out at him two or three times as she stood washing herself in the little basin between the windows.
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Robert	I hope she has discernment enough to find in me something besides the blagueur. If I thought there was any doubt--” “Oh, enough, [MASK]!” she broke into his heated outburst. “You are not thinking of what you are saying.
<name>Alcée</name>	Alcée	Robert	She went down and led them out of the sun, scolding the quadroon for not being more attentive. It did not strike her as in the least grotesque that she should be making of [MASK] the object of conversation and leading her husband to speak of him.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Edna	[MASK] marveled, not comprehending. She herself was almost devoid of coquetry. There were one or two men whom she observed at the soiree musicale; but she would never have felt moved to any kittenish display to attract their notice--to any feline or feminine wiles to express herself toward them.
<name>Christie</name>	Christie	Mademoiselle	A bust of Beethoven, covered with a hood of dust, scowled at her from the mantelpiece. “Ah! here comes the sunlight!” exclaimed [MASK], rising from her knees before the stove. “Now it will be warm and bright enough; I can let the fire alone.”
<name>Rose</name>	Rose	Robert	They took all his money and one of the children and stole his boat.” “Shut up!” “Does she understand?” “Oh, hush!” “Are those two married over there--leaning on each other?” “Of course not,” laughed [MASK].
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Robert	There was her husband's reproach looking at her from the external things around her which he had provided for her external existence. There was [MASK]'s reproach making itself felt by a quicker, fiercer, more overpowering love, which had awakened within her toward him.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Edna	She sat low at the instrument, and the lines of her body settled into ungraceful curves and angles that gave it an appearance of deformity. Gradually and imperceptibly the interlude melted into the soft opening minor chords of the Chopin Impromptu. [MASK] did not know when the Impromptu began or ended.
