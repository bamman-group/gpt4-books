<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Pat	“Damn if d’ worm ain’ turned.” “Yea—but which a one is d’ worm?” The bystanders crowded about the door, listening. [MASK], grinning, kept his hand on the knob, his ear against the panel.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Baby	“I couldn’ mean it that way—you know that.” “How do I know what you could mean?” “Couldn’ ever say nothin’ common ’bout you. Couldn’ even think it. ‘[MASK]’s’ a nice name.”
<name>Mac</name>	Mac	Jinx	“Well you oughter been slipped,” [MASK] said. “Any bird can’t take kiddin’ no better’n that needs to be kidded and kidded hard.” The customary comments accompanied this discourse : “Tell ’em ’bout it!” “That means fight in my home.”
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Merrit	“The one just starting to dance with the big chap in gray?” “Yes.” [MASK] too looked sharply. Appreciation of unfamiliar features at that distance in a crowd was difficult, but-- “I’ve seen that girl somewhere. You say she’s your maid?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jinx	Dressed like a fortune-teller— wish she’d tell mine. Anything she say ’d be aw-right with me. Tell me I go’n’ die tomorrer, I’d go right on and die happy.” “I mean,” [MASK] agreed.
<name>Dilsey</name>	Dilsey	Bubber	“Ain’ talkin’ ’bout after—talkin’ ’bout from.” “From?” [MASK] stood erect. “Me run from you?” “You do have bright moments, dark as you is.”
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Linda	I b’lieve ’twould near ’bout kill ’im to lose it. But he sho’ is a nice man to work fo’—don’ never bother you ’bout nothin’.” [MASK] decided it would be less exhausting to do some of the talking herself.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Merrit	280 “Got to admit he was wise,” [MASK] mused. “Sent several of those warnings. Wise. Rather admire that chap really. And I swear I’m sorry" it wasn’t the fays.”
<name>Waldo</name>	Waldo	Locke	With a spiritual attitude—an emotional make-up like the Negro’s.” “Just what do you mean?” “This tropic nnnrhalanpp^ as [MASK] calls it. This acceptance nf circumstance not with a shrug, like ,; : the Oriental, but with a characteristic grin.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Mary	“Is that so, mum?” “Yes. So you see, after all, some disaster like this was all that he could expect. It was simply poetic justice, that’s all.” “Justice of the peace,” amended [MASK].
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Shine	“Remember how he held on to that piano the day the roof broke?” But to-day for the first time [MASK]’s preoccupation put him quite off guard; and so to-day his evil pursuer struck.
<name>Smitty</name>	Smitty	Joshua	“After he got through tellin’ ’bout that bird, [MASK], I didn’t know what the—what it was all about. Where’s he get that stuff ’bout knowin’ y’self? How’s a guy go’n’ help knowin’ hisself?
<name>Jericho</name>	Jericho	JERICHO	14 the WALLS OF [MASK] “Don’t let ’im surprise y\ He kin wrastle the hell out of a piano.” “Piano don’t fight back.” “Don’t it? Well—neither will you if he get the same hold on y\” “Humph.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Merrit	rip his yellow arms out—just let him get that close again----- But the vision of [MASK] as he’d last seen him, limp and shuddering amid devastation, grew clear, whereupon, in spite of himself, this redoubled malevolence sagged.
<name>Regan</name>	Regan	Pat	There came a characteristic confidential twist to one side of [MASK]’s mouth. “He put me in some time back, see? Damage suit—ten thousand berries. Hit a guy crossin’ the speedway— knocked him f’ a gool, the dumbbell.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Lindy	Let them think so if that’s any fun. But when you think so yourself—well, you’re kidding yourself, that’s all.” He grasped vaguely for comprehension and captured only excuse: “Well, you kid yourself too sometimes, [MASK].”
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Lindy	I kid myself, too.” There was a long pause. Then, “But I know I’m doing it---You don’t.” “But listen, [MASK]. The only time I tried to tell you, you hauled off and bat me one.”
<name>Jericho</name>	Jericho	JERICHO	“Can you imagine it? A Negro—using white prejudice to cover what he wanted to do—putting *** THE WALLS OF [MASK] *** the blame in the most likely spot—almost getting away with it, too— Can you beat that?”
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Merrit	Even then he had realized that [MASK] would not be found at home during the day, and had finished his afternoon’s work in a silent turmoil. Added delay had not subdued his fury—had merely stored up a greater potential violence, like added tension on a spring.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Merrit	“[MASK]!” “He’s a jig.” “Don’ do it.” “What?” “I said don’ do it.” “Why not?” “Well, I know that bird. I done—I did a job for him once.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Shine	This he did now, as soon as [MASK] stopped talking. For a long time he stood looking down on the Avenue. “Well,” he said at last, “I’ll be tarred and feathered if that isn’t the damnedest--” His office commanded a comer.
<name>She</name>	She	Linda	[MASK] silently annoyed, was on the point of rising to leave. His next remark detained her: “I’m one o’ the judges, y’ know.” Her brows went up and he knew that now, at least, he had her interest.
<name>He</name>	He	Shine	The instrument stood alone and sullen at the edge of the cluttered sidewalk, aloof, superior, apart, permitting the lesser pieces to go first. [MASK] likewise aloof and apart, refused to enter the house with the others.
<name>Milly</name>	Milly	Linda	Extremely pretty, really.” “And she remains a maid?” “Why not? It’s honest work and very good pay.” “The pretty ones usually prefer to go on the stage.” “Oh, [MASK] wouldn’t think of any such thing.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Nora	To save her soul she could not help a momentary brown, was presented as [MASK]’s husband: Intermarriage! She recovered. No. The girl was one of those mulaftoes, of course; a conclusion that brought but temporary relief, for the next moment most of these fair-skinned visitors were
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Lindy	“No—’tisn’t s’posed to be touched, is it?” “You—all right, [MASK]?” “Great. Going home to-day. Wasn’t any sense in them bringing me here anyhow. I wasn’t—I was only scared—I guess.”
<name>Alfie</name>	Alfie	Shine	But you lap it up. You swallow it whole. I mean that’s the way it looked. Naturally I Agger I can get away too, see? Y’ can’t kill me f’ that, can y’?” From [MASK] this was abject apology.
<name>Calpurnia</name>	Calpurnia	Oscar	When you git a letter in yo’ mail what somebody write y’, it’s wrote, ain’t it?’ ’ “You listen, [MASK]. When you git a hole in yo’ hiney where some dog bite y’, you bit, ain’t y’?”
<name>Blackie</name>	Blackie	Jigs	“Well, I know that bird. I done—I did a job for him once. He’s funny.” “What’s wrong with him?” “First thing is, he’s a jig. [MASK] is bad to work for.”
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Jinx	“You know what you is lots better’n I do.” Whereupon he did a triumphant little buck and wing step, which ended in a single loud, dustraising stamp. Dry dust and drier laughter floated irritatingly into [MASK]’s face.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Jinx	I am very humbly requestin’ a share in his hind-parts.” It was apparent that the bristling antagonists bristled no longer, had limply lost interest in their quarrel. “Aw, man,” mumbled [MASK], “what you talkin’ ’bout?”
<name>Yolanda</name>	Yolanda	Dickty	“Yea?” “No lie. And they wasn’t near as easy to gaze on as that sister, either. [MASK]—shuh—that ain’t got nothin’ to do with it. It’s that ball-bearin’ movement, thass what.”
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Linda	But neither succeeded in bantering him into promising to see her safely home after the shout. He caught sight of [MASK] occasionally, dancing with boys, nice, Sunday-Schoolish boys he did not know, and he blamed these occasional views of her for the persistence in his mind of what he had seen.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Bubber	“See what?” “Soon as a old crow gits up in d’ world, he got to grab hisse’f some other guy’s wife.” [MASK] regarded him with pity. “How you fig-ger dat out?”
<name>Ab</name>	Ab	Shine	“Tell ’im ’bout that licker we ruint.” “Try some good licker,” [MASK] invited, turning the rest of his pint over to them. “Go ’head—I got enough.”
<name>Quilty</name>	Quilty	Patmore	Some people might not have cared for the fishy blankness of [MASK]’s gray eyes, nor for his tough-looking tan skin, thickly bespecked with small brown freckles, nor for his rather heavy jowls nor his rather thick neck with its two deep transverse creases behind.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Shine	Suddenly he warned with exaggerated malignancy— “Don’t a man move!— knew I’d turn the bug on you dinkies this time!” And he threw down an ace and a jack, the supreme combination. He was collecting his winnings when [MASK] came in, edging sidewise through the crowd.
<name>Barmaid</name>	Barmaid	Negress	She is very pretty, too. She is so different from what one thinks of on hearing the term, [MASK]. Extremely pretty, really.” “And she remains a maid?” “Why not? It’s honest work and very good pay.”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Shine	It was quite a shock—but it wasn’t the house. Not altogether. That is—the picture, you see, wasn’t insured— can’t replace that.” “That’s too bad,” said [MASK]. 280
<name>Essie</name>	Essie	Linda	“I don’t want to be a K.M. all my life.” “Aimin’ to better yo’se’f, huh?” [MASK] was afraid she had made the wrong move here, but it was too late to change. She nodded with exaggerated vigor.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Shine	“Aw go ’haid, [MASK]. That boogy’s shoutin’ ’cause you was hyeh to protect ’im. I’m go’n’ ketch ’im one these days when you ain’ ’round, and I’m go’n’ turn ’im ev’y
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Pat	If she had been interested enough to ask [MASK] about him, there was no sense in releasing her now so easily, just because she was playing tight. Or maybe she wasn’t playing. Maybe she was scared. “Listen—I admit I got you all wrong.
<name>Zarathustra</name>	Zarathustra	JERICHO	* THE WALLS OF [MASK] *** passage between the saloon and the pool parlor revealed a part view of the latter; and presently forms came into sight, were framed in the doorway, vanished, returned for brief moments.
<name>Septimus</name>	Septimus	Shine	[MASK]’s active participation had so far consisted only in handing things down from the van. Now he must direct the hoisting and so lend a more active hand. It was now that his brooding inadvertence combined with his recently assumed recklessness to make him do an unprecedented thing.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Pat	“What ’d [MASK] say?” She was silent a long time. The lights of a homeward bound excursion boat broke through the river’s moonlit smile, but when the ship had passed, the smile was still ironically there. Wraiths of music and laughter drifted shoreward.
<name>Jericho</name>	Jericho	Shine	[MASK] felt his left hand go numb, felt his hatred 270 *** THE WALLS OF JERICHO *+* break into action. All of a sudden he became a madman with no notion of what he was doing, with no sustained consciousness, only a succession of fragments that thumped in his head.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Click	Just a friend? Sorry. Couldn’t he issuing cards all day. Come at visiting hour to-morrow—two to three p.m. Very sorry, but it was really against the rules. Find out how she is for you, if you like. [MASK] . . .
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Linda	“That’s just what occurred to me [MASK]. Exactly what occurred to me. When I saw you this morning and noticed for the first time how different you were from most colored people? I said to myself, ‘There now—why can’t they all he like that?’
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Bubber	To this duct [MASK] made his major attachments, using many windings of line and an intricate system of knots; and for double security he carried the line ten feet further rearward to a chimney and around this wound the rest of it, fastening it uncompromisingly with a second complex of knots.
<name>thought</name>	thought	XII	“You can be sure,” she said. As he left, he chuckled and chided himself: “Damn shame to worry that poor woman like that—she’ll die before the night’s over. Somebody’ll tell her sure.” [MASK]
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Patmore	[MASK] came hurriedly in from the pool room, flanked by the two who’d summoned him. He paused a moment to listen, his ear against the door. “I hear sump’n,” he said. “Wonder is----?” and at once unlocked and opened the door.
<name>statues</name>	statues	Linda	Thereupon he noticed that everyone else stood like [MASK], motionless, with lowered head, as if it wasn’t proper to look; and he wondered what manner of performance this was, which one might attend, hut on which one might not gaze.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Shine	“What?” “Anybody else—four.” “This,” said [MASK], “is good licker.” “ ’Course ’tis. All my licker is good.” “This ain’ never been yourn—’scription licker.”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Shine	There was a table before this window, and seated at the table, a man. Looking obliquely through the doorway, [MASK] saw that the man did not sit wholly erect, but slumped down in his chair as limply as if his backbone had melted, drooped there almost double, his head 248
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Shine	“One moment please, operator,” returned [MASK]. “What number’d you think I was callin’?” “The number on that policeman’s badge,” she said, although “that policeman” was nowhere in sight. “Where?”
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Pat	[MASK] was not bad with his hands himself, and it is significant that with apparent ease he managed quickly to separate them. “What the hell you think this is?” he inquired, as for a moment they stood off from each other glaring.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Shine	I ought to ’a’ crowned him then, but he was too wise—knew where to meet me and when. So all I could do was pay off. Ten thousand bucks to stay out o’ jail.” “Ten thousand bucks wasted,” [MASK] said.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Pat	I could a’ made fifteen thousand on that ten. Same as he’s doin’ now.” “So now you figger on a come-back?” [MASK] was almost reproachful. “ ’Course not—that ain’t the kind o’ bird I am.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Linda	Doubtfully [MASK] ruminated. “Why—I remember some jubilee singers gave a concert of ’em once at the Parish. And I’ve been to Methodist revival meetings where they sang ’em just like jazz. We only went for fun, to see the folks get happy and shout.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Linda	“Is that so?” “Yea. She ain’ foolin’ nobody but herself. Say —that’s what that guy meant, huh?” [MASK] sniffed and changed the subject. “I’m going to change my job.” “No!”
<name>address</name>	address	Shine	And when they had eventually obeyed, he went on to [MASK]: “Jes’ to show y’ they’s no hard feelin’s, I got a scheme that means bucks, and if you got two good eyes, you kin see how to make some of ’em.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Linda	She fanned her shining round brown face with a limp dishcloth and smiled as she paused for breath. The smile revealed a shining row of white teeth, each of them just half a circle. “It’s nice here,” [MASK] observed, looking about.
<name>Tristram</name>	Tristram	Merrit	And as he continued to stare and wonder on this unfamiliar sight, he became aware of something grasped in one of [MASK]’s extended hands: a fairly large picture-frame, out of which the canvas had been burnt, leaving only a frayed, singed, marginal rim.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Shine	A cabinet lay on its side in a corner, its upper half bared and blackened, its lower still embraced in a scorched, wet covering. Little puddles glistened here and there; a rug protested under [MASK]’s step with the squish of a full sponge, compressed.
<name>Jeff</name>	Jeff	Shine	He illustrated his idea with head-wobblings, shoulder-rollings, and loose backward protrusions and retractions of buttocks. “See what I mean? Tailconscious, man, tail-conscious--” “You jes’ a damn liar,” came unexpectedly from [MASK].
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Linda	Your people are very religious creatures aren’t they?” “Well, some are and some not.” “I thought—er—slavery, you know, would have made you very religious.” “Maybe it did,” said [MASK].
<name>Heyst</name>	Heyst	Shine	The ruined dwelling had simply earned and received the wages of sin-----If [MASK] could have trampled and crushed them all in that moment, he would surely have done so. But as this tide of hatred fell and receded, his original murderous intent emerged like a spire through abating flood.
<name>Alroy</name>	Alroy	Bruce	“Nowadays,” [MASK] observed, “we grow by— well—a sort of passive conquest. The fays move out, and the jigs are so close no more fays will move in. So the landlord has to rent to jigs and the colony keeps extending.
<name>Jericho</name>	Jericho	JERICHO	Nor did she herself. She was tall and her 52 w* THE WALLS OF [MASK] face was pretty, and her body slenderly invited, though her legs perversely eluded, the persistent caress of the sedulous soft black satin.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Linda	“I’ve seen that girl somewhere. You say she’s your maid?” “I’m positive that’s [MASK].” A moment’s rumination; then he remembered. Slowly over his face came an expression of elation far more than commensurate with the recognition.
<name>Kim</name>	Kim	Merrit	“All my life.” “How do you find them?” That [MASK] did not resist temptation and admit his complete identity at this point is easier to explain than to excuse. There was first his admitted joy in discomfiting members of the dominant 105 race.
<name>Conan</name>	Conan	SKme	The heavy ivory sphere missed its mark, sped through the doorway and over the observers’ heads, shattering the great bar mirror behind them. The crash and jangle of the falling glass wallas, was alT that snatched [MASK] out ofmadness.
<name>Blackie</name>	Blackie	Bubber	“Any rats down there?” “Yea—and y’all ’ll make two more.” “Well,” grinned [MASK], “when I walk out, them rats’ll have some bones to gnaw on anyhow,” and he moved off toward the pool room.
<name>Throckmorton</name>	Throckmorton	Bruce	“It’s the old, old story,” said [MASK]. “War— conquest of territory. But our side of the thing isn’t all there is to it. The fays have a side too, you know.”
<name>Studs</name>	Studs	Shine	“Women,” [MASK] had often said, “don’t mean a man no good. Always want sump’m. Always got they hands out. Gimme. Any bird that really falls for a sheba is one half sap and th’ other half sucker.”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Shine	One hook came through just as [MASK] was reaching out of the window to catch hold of the suspended instrument and guide it through the frame. He heard the crackle of broken cement above, saw the instrument sag a little while over it showered crumbs of broken cornice.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Shine	How many nights a week do you have to yourself, and how? When were you last out with the boy-friend? And now you have a pain in the bottom of your stomach----?” The interne dabbed iodin on the denuded area of [MASK]’s forehead.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Fred	So the landlord has to rent to jigs and the colony keeps extending. But if [MASK] wants to return to the older method, I don’t think it will do any great harm to the rest of us. He’s taking all the risk.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Jinx	The piano lay half supine in a grotesque angular posture, its row of white keys gleaming like teeth, the lid of its keyboard sprung back and fixed, like the retracted upper lip of a creature that has died in agony. [MASK] gave forth a prayer of thanksgiving:
<name>Jericho</name>	Jericho	JERICHO	Pounding on his head—pounding— gone quite crazy, pounding. The super was stunned less by the pounding than by the fact that the boy 20 THE WALLS OF [MASK] ***» kept doing it. Even after he was shaken off, the boy kept fighting aggressively.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Pat	Good thing: those two were a constant pain in the what’s-a-name with their continuous quarrel. Over a woman, hey? Huh—jes’ goes to show y’---- [MASK] was called away from his post by some duty in the pool room.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Joshua	Consider it a Jewish legend—a parable of Paradise, if you will—a myth, without any basis of factual truth. Even so, the spiritual value of the story looms and remains tremendous. “You, my friend, are [MASK].
<name>Jericho</name>	Jericho	Pat	He stood set, motionless, blinked once or twice and stared a long moment at [MASK]. Only then, perhaps, did he actually see him, 275 THE WALLS OF JERICHO *** on his knees, gasping, helpless.
<name>Chip</name>	Chip	Linda	Meantime the kacks is closin’ in and you can’t make a quick getaway. And when I come to, I’m down on the floor haulin’ it through the crowd.” “There’s an empty bench under that tree,” discovered [MASK].
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Shrimpie	They were seeing who could pick most in the hour allotted to them for the work. And [MASK], unaware that they were being watched from the window of the nearest cottage, suddenly stopped, staring in surprise and delight at a big, red, prematurely ripe tomato in his hand.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Pott	Just as [MASK] says, they’ll resist. They’ll warn you with threatening notes. They’ll try to buy you out. If these don’t work, they will probably dynamite you.” “I’ve received one warning already.” “You have?”
<name>Jericho</name>	Jericho	JERICHO	It won’t be because you’re crazy about me—that’ll just be the excuse.” He went through a good deal of figuring before he answered that. What he eventually said was: 259 AVS THE WALLS OF [MASK] <
<name>him</name>	him	Bruce	And I recall one day when twelve mounted policemen came galloping up One Hundred Thirty-fourth Street after one little West Indian ice-man—and galloped back without him. It was really comical.” The others gave [MASK] attention, watching him as he spoke.
<name>Blackie</name>	Blackie	Merrit	Coulda’ got out cheaper may be, on’y this bird [MASK] wouldn’ listen to reason. Claim’ he was go’n’ bring in my occupation and lots o’ other stuff if I didn’ come clean—forcin’ my hand, see?
<name>Dilsey</name>	Dilsey	Bubber	Once arrived, there was much palaver about the best way to negotiate the terrain. “This place jes’ sprawls all over this hill,” observed [MASK]. “Looks like a flock o’ hencoops. How we go’n’ git up yonder?”
<name>Jericho</name>	Jericho	Pat	205 <VV"> THE WALLS OF JERICHO standers saw them disappear through the cellar door, which [MASK] promptly closed behind them. “Well, what do y’ know ’bout that?” “Ain’t this a dog?” “Salty dog, I mean.”
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Linda	It surprised him a good deal more, however, when the figure came near enough for recognition. It was [MASK], bareheaded, wrapped in a coat, smiling at his astonishment. “Heard you were coming,” she said. “Got up early and waited.”
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Shine	He’s jes’ makin’ sure o’ friends in case d’ fays start sump’m.” [MASK] said to himself, “If this bird wasn’t a dickty he’d be o.k. But they never was a dickty worth a damn.”
<name>Al</name>	Al	Merrit	He had finally been able to phrase it for himself in terms that brought it home to him, terms that made it ridiculous to feel shame for having let [MASK] off unpunished. He put it thus: “The guy that’s really hard is the guy that’s hard enough to be soft.”
<name>Geoffrey</name>	Geoffrey	Shine	She came now unaccompanied toward the low terrace, reaching it just as the orchestra struck up a new number. Here she and [MASK] met face to face and the argument was settled; she was alone, she was at hand, and a new dance was beginning.
<name>Johnny's</name>	Johnny's	Patmore	But I got to have some o’ [MASK]. So I’m standin’ there wonderin’ what the top card is and lookin’ at you. Then I see you don’ look so good—kinda like a kitten some rough kid won’t turn loose.
<name>Stahr</name>	Stahr	Merrit	“All you put up is experience,” [MASK] said. “You’ve got your own hoisting license, haven’t you? You and that girl can hit it off sooner, maybe —she’s out to the country-place now, by the way.
<name>Snell</name>	Snell	Isaacs	“What?” “Awful hard on old man [MASK].” “What you talkin’ ’bout?” “To lose two good men at once.” “Boy, you done gone crazy?” “No. I was jes’ thinkin--
<name>Know</name>	Know	Dangerous	Then, by way of excuse, “Well she sho’ is good to look at. Ain’ no sense in a woman bein’ that good-lookin’. Ain’ no excuse for it. [MASK], what I mean.
<name>Irene</name>	Irene	Cornelia	“What?” “You can be sure some critic will call it the best thing ever done by a Negro.” ' “Yes,” said [MASK], “as if that’s paying you a hell of a compliment.”
