<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Shane	“Maybe they’re goin’ to migrate,” said the younger of the two armchair carriers, letting drop his half of the burden and staring up at the sky. “Don’t be an idiot, [MASK],” said the other man, a West Indian.
<name>vampire</name>	vampire	Jewess	Beneath the incandescent beauty of her face, behind eyes that concealed centuries yet could be so immediate they drew blood, beneath the deep olive skin, a [MASK]’s skin, there lay feelings that would blister the air if given vent.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Mimi	Any further attempt to explain her suspicions would end in confusion. Besides, [MASK]’s death had begun a new spiral of puzzles. Chief among them: what had the old woman known, or been, that she had to be dispatched?
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Hobart	“They’re making a fool of you,” a second voice said. It was [MASK] who replied. “We’re close, I tell you,” he said. “I’ll have her.” “Never mind the woman,” came the response.
<name>Hitler</name>	Hitler	Hobart	No doubt too he would be the first to be sacrificed to the ferocity of public indignation should the techniques he brought to bear fail. But they did not fail. The elite group he formed—men chosen from the divisions for their sympathy with [MASK]’s methods—was quickly successful.
<name>warehouse</name>	warehouse	Cal	Do you have something to tell me? About [MASK]?” “He went to a warehouse, for furniture and such ...” “Did he indeed. Then we shall find him, and make him a happy man. Was he alone?” “No.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Immacolata	[MASK] could see her willing death upon herself before the needles pricked her secrets out. On the other side of the door the nurse’s inquiries rose in pitch and volume. “Open the door! Please, will you open the door!” Time was running out.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jerichau	He halted for a moment. When he spoke again he’d modulated his strident tone. “I respect your doubts,” he said. “But you must understand the situation’s changed.” “I think we should see this Prophet for ourselves,” said [MASK].
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Suzanna	“Come on now ... let it be . ..” There was something in the tone of his voice of one coaxing an hysteric from the brink of an attack, and [MASK] was glad of his intervention. “... it’s too public,” he said.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Immacolata	Its abdomen had been opened from throat to testicles. It was not the menstruum’s doing, but that of the knife now dropping from [MASK]’s hand. The beast, trailing its innards, stumbled a little way, then keeled over in the mud.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Apolline	I remember it vaguely. [MASK] will tell us better.” “What kind of place?” “A hill, I think it was,” he said, his unblinking stare on the white paper tablecloth between them. “Some kind of hill. ..”
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Cal	Do you have my address?” “Yes. I’ve still got your card.” “Then come. I’d enjoy the company.” These welcoming words, coming after the losses of the night, were almost too much; [MASK] felt his eyes pricking.
<name>Clary</name>	Clary	Apolline	“No,” said [MASK]. She’d thrown a pile of clothes off one of the chairs and was straddling it. “No, all they knew was rumor and hearsay. Called us all kinds of names. Shades and faeries. All manner of shit.
<name>the woman</name>	the woman	Cal	They were there still, the woman’s hand pressed over her offsprings mouth, the child’s eyes turned up to look at her, wide with fear. As the last light was snuffed out, [MASK] saw her mouth ask a question of the man, who in answer jerked his thumb over his shoulder.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Cal	Much was learned on both sides, not least the fact that they might with time become friends. “No more talk,” said [MASK] as they came full circle to the gate of the Mooney house. “You’re a baby, remember?”
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Cal	“I don’t want to hear.” “He said he’d seen some woman killed in the back garden. And some monster on the railway track.” She smiled gently at the lunacy of this. [MASK] stared down at her, suddenly sick to his stomach.
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Hamel	She followed him, her head throbbing, the first step taken through snow, the second through thicket. There was a child crying in the depths of the hideaway, its sobs inconsolable. “See if you can keep her quiet, [MASK],” she said.
<name>her</name> (Note: There is no proper name that fills in the [MASK] token in this passage. The pronoun "her" is the correct answer.)	her (Note: There is no proper name that fills in the [MASK] token in this passage. The pronoun "her" is the correct answer.)	Suzanna	Tears rose in [MASK], seeing her grandmother tucked up like a child, except that she was sleeping not in preparation for a new day but for endless night. She had been so fierce, this woman, and so resolute. Now all the strength had gone, and forever.
<name>the woman</name>	the woman	Immacolata	The Incantatrix swept down upon the woman and snatched her up—the menstruum wrapping them both in light—then threw her across the field. Her body hit the face of the rock upon which [MASK] had been standing with a sickening thud, and dropped, broken, to the ground.
<name>Aslan</name>	Aslan	Hobart	A shudder ran through the ground from the wall where [MASK] stood and through the garden. At its passage the sand forms began to decay, countless plants dropping into dust, avenues of trees shuddering and collapsing like arches in an earthquake.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Suzanna	She turned from the stairs and walked past [MASK] to the door, taking with her a cloud of cold and tainted air, as though the wraiths that had come to her were now wreathed about her neck and clinging to the folds of her dress.
<name>John</name>	John	Romo	“That’s the best advice I can offer.” “Between what?” [MASK] frowned. “Simply between,” he said, as though the sense of this was self-evident. “I know you’re the equal of it.
<name>The Secret</name>	The Secret	Wonderland	But another part said: be quiet, be careful. [MASK] doesn’t come to those who blab about it, only to those who keep their silence, and wait. So that’s what he did. He sat, and shook, and waited.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Mooney	“I’m a little hot, that’s all.” “Got an appointment to keep, have you?” “No.” “Where is she, [MASK]?” “I don’t know.” “There’s no sense in protecting her.
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Cal	Was he closing the dead man’s eyes, offering a blessing as he did so? [MASK] had to make his presence known; had to speak to the man, even if it was just to say that he too had witnessed the horrors here, and that they wouldn’t go unrevenged.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Cal	As the car bolted forward she chanced the briefest of glances at [MASK]’s direction. She saw to her distress that he was engaged in trying to wind his way between the cars. Though she shouted his name, he was oblivious to her. She shouted again.
<name>no one</name>	no one	Suzanna	The intersecting beams were brightening, and the fraught air was soothed by the sound of voices, softly murmuring words so unfixable they were almost music. “You’re too late,” said the Incantatrix, her comment made not to [MASK] but to the dead quartet.
<name>Aragorn</name>	Aragorn	Cal	It was [MASK]. He was walking across the smoking ground that had once been the snow-covered field at the bottom of the hill; walking straight toward the enemy. At the sight of him she didn’t hesitate to break cover.
<name>her</name>	her	Apolline	He then performed the same service for [MASK]. She showed more sign of life—moaning as if about to wake. The clamor of bids was heating up in the adjacent room; it was clear from the din that there were a good number of would-be purchasers involved.
<name>Madam</name>	Madam	Tung	[MASK] was at the door, calling her in. “Hurry, will you? We have precious little time.” She hesitated. The menstruum offered her no courage now; her stomach felt like a cold furnace: ash and emptiness.
<name>Grandpa</name>	Grandpa	Mimi	“There’s no time,” he said. “I’ve got an appointment to keep, on your grandmother’s behalf.” “But there’s so much I don’t understand.” “Didn’t [MASK] leave you instructions?” he said.
<name>Incantatrix</name>	Incantatrix	Immacolata	He looked up as they ascended into darkness, a patter of blood falling. Almost as the night erased them he saw [MASK]’s head loll and the sisters rise to her aid. This time the Incantatrix did not despise their support, but let them bear her away.
<name>mother</name>	mother	Worm	to have made a second womb in the [MASK]’s belly until he was bom back into the world? Too late, damn it; far too late. The pages could contain them no longer. Leaving their confrontation unfinished they broke from the words in a burst of punctuation.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Brendan	He volunteered your name—and lo and behold, you’ve been selected by computer as the recipient of—” “I told you I don’t want it,” [MASK] interrupted, and tried to close the door, but the man already had one foot on the threshold.
<name>her</name>	her	Suzanna	“They’ll be able to see us from up there.” “We’ll make a detour. Get out around the back.” He looked at [MASK]. “Yes?” he said. “Yes,” she replied.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Cal	“He’s been dead eight years,” she said. Her voice had less color than the speaking clock. “What’s your inquiry concerning?” “A carpet,” said [MASK]. “You want to buy a carpet?” “No.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Cal	[MASK] followed, his stupefied brain still grappling with what he’d just experienced. The Kind might be cornered, but they weren’t without a trick or two; the illusion that kept this wood from sight had survived close scrutiny.
<name>Mr. Jaggers</name>	Mr. Jaggers	Hobart	The thought of such a thing began to make her laugh. The sound of her laughter was too much for [MASK]. He retreated and disappeared up the stairs. No further challenge was offered as they made their escape. They climbed the stairs, then crossed the abruptly deserted office.
<name>Tralfamadore</name>	Tralfamadore	Chloe	There was much else he saw, but none of it for more than a few seconds. “You find it unsetding?” said [MASK]. “What’s going on?” “This is paradoxical ground. Strictly speaking, you shouldn’t be here at all.
<name>Madame Ratignolle</name>	Madame Ratignolle	Immacolata	In the face of this feeling all other ambitions—for happiness, for pleasure, for power—all others faded. She looked back at [MASK], and her new eyes saw not an enemy but a woman possessed of the same torrent that ran in her own veins.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Nimrod	“This time, the earth will rise with us. That’s what people are saying. The Cuckoos have made too much mischief. Their Age is over.” “Sounds like wish fulfillment to me.” “You may doubt—” said [MASK].
<name>the portrait</name>	the portrait	Shadwell	It wanted an end to its waiting, and soon. But its majesty was repulsed at the thought of contact with the human world. Like all pure things, it was vain, and easily spoiled. Perhaps, it said. Its gaze moved off [MASK] toward the wall.
<name>the preacher</name>	the preacher	Capra	The hour is near.” With that promise, the lights above the platform went out. When they came on again, moments later, the voice of [MASK] had gone, leaving an empty chair and a congregation ready to follow him wherever he chose to lead them.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Shadwell	[MASK] said. The grip relaxed a little. “Keep your brutalities out of my sight,” said the Salesman. His voice rose. “Understand me?” he said. “Do you? Do you understand?” “Yes, sir.”
<name>Logan</name>	Logan	Shadwell	“It’s unknowable.” “Nothings unknowable,” he growled. “Not to me. Not anymore.” “You’re still a man, [MASK],” she reminded him. “You’re vulnerable.” “Shut up,” he said.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Nimrod	“Who?” But as [MASK] went to answer, the woman, who’d come down the path and was standing half a yard from the door, spoke: “He’s so adorable,” she cooed.
<name>Clarisse</name>	Clarisse	Mimi	But she had no chance to investigate the vision. Behind her, the nurse said: “Oh my God. ” The voice broke [MASK]’s spell, and the patterns burst into a storm of petals, disappearing.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Suzie	“I’ve something for you. ” The child’s heart had fallen from its place, and thumped around in her belly. “Say thank you, [MASK],” her mother chided. The child did as she was told.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Shadwell	“She used me,” [MASK] began. “She’ll tell you lies. Tell you I loved raptures. I didn’t. You must believe me, I didn’t.” He felt the Angel’s countless eyes upon him; their stare silenced him.
<name>her</name>	her	Hobart	“We worked well together.” “You’ve got new allies now,” she replied. “You heard?” “My sisters had been with you now and then.” The thought did not comfort him. “Do you trust [MASK]?”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Apolline	She threw him a baleful glance. “Very well,” she said, and began to tell. Ill whaT she Told We weren’t always lost,” she began. “Once we lived in a garden.” Two sentences in, and [MASK] was interrupting.
<name>Lady Macbeth</name>	Lady Macbeth	Cal	Images appeared: a house, a room. And yes, the carpet, lying in splendor before hungry eyes. The lines twisted; other images fought for her attention. Was that blood spilled so copiously on the floor? and [MASK]’s heel slipping in it?
<name>Trinity</name>	Trinity	Suzanna	They retraced their steps through the throng of pedestrians and found him standing in front of a video rental shop, entranced by bank upon bank of monitors. “Are they prisoners?” he said as he stared at the talking heads. “No,” said [MASK].
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Suzanna	Was it the chill that made him squint, or was he seeing a ghost of something against the glare of snow? “We’re just going to get weaker,” said [MASK], “unless we get help.” “From the jacket?”
<name>the succubus</name>	the succubus	Shadwell	The menstruum flew from her in all directions, wasting its potency on the ceiling and the walls. Those few barbs that found her attacker did nothing but arouse it further. Though it had no sexual anatomy to speak of, [MASK] had trained it in the basic moves.
<name>Max</name>	Max	Hobart	Now more than ever she hoped it could teach her something of what she was, and how to profit by it. She would have to get the volume back, even if it meant confronting [MASK] once more. As she formulated this thought she heard her name uttered, or an approximation of it.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Boaz	That, and their powdered faces, seemed to confuse all the cliches of gender. Their faces were vulnerable, yet implacable; delicate, yet severe. [MASK] looked toward the hill, where the fireflies were still cavorting.
<name>Shadow</name>	Shadow	Cal	It’s just that a thing that grows too certain of itself becomes a kind of he. That’s what you dreamed. That the other place is a place of lies.” [MASK] nodded. The grip on his hand tightened, as though there was a pact in the making.
<name>Godfrey</name>	Godfrey	Elroy	Though released, he could scarcely move; his bruised limbs were rigid with cramp after being held fast for so long. And now he realized that his troubles were not over. He felt the sweat on his face turning cold as the mother of [MASK]’s terrible infant drew herself toward him.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Immacolata	Nor was it stupid. It had learned the lessons he’d taught it well enough. Even now it leapt upon the Incantatrix, wrapping its arms around her neck and its legs about her hips. Such intimacy would, he knew, drive [MASK] to distraction.
<name>Lauren</name>	Lauren	Immacolata	“The rock knows,” she said. “The rock?” “It’ll be sand soon. I told it so, because it’s true. It’ll be sand.” [MASK] took her gaze off her questioner and began to stroke the rock with her open palm.
<name>Joker</name>	Joker	Cal	Confounded as he was by the face below him, [MASK] pursued his assumption, and addressed his reply not to the puppet but the puppeteer. “Throwing your voice like that.” The man still grinned, but showed no sign that he’d understood.
<name>Fafnir</name>	Fafnir	Hobart	When the Salesman talked of the Scourge, [MASK] knew it could only be the Dragon of his dreams by another name. Once, he half- remembered, he’d sought that monster in a forest, but he’d found only confusion there.
<name>life</name>	life	Cal	Open in front of you. Have what you like. Free, gratis, and without charge. You tell me what you see in there, and the next minute it’s in your hands....” Look away, something in [MASK] said; nothing comes free.
<name>Catelyn</name>	Catelyn	Capra	“I do apologize for this unfortunate—” “You’re not welcome here,” one of the number said. “You’ve brought death into [MASK]’s House.” “It was a misunderstanding,” he replied softly. “No.”
<name>Corwin</name>	Corwin	Suzanna	the Incantatrix said. “Make you understand how you’ll be betrayed. Have already been betrayed.” Without seeming to take a step, she moved away from [MASK]. Flickering strands of light were moving past them now, as the Fugue spread from its hiding place.
<name>He</name>	He	Hobart	[MASK] had no intention of deciphering the mewls, but instead leveled his gun at the wreckage shambling toward him. “Come no closer,” he warned. The man, spittle running from his open mouth, made a second incoherent appeal. “Get out!”
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Nimrod	Again, he raised his hands to silence the congregation, but this time they would not be subdued so readily. “Please,” he said, obliged for the first time to raise his voice. “Please. Listen to me!” “We’ll follow you!” [MASK] was shouting.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Apolline	But [MASK]’s appraisal was accurate: she didn’t trust them with their own miracles. Her instinct told her to keep her account of the Loom to herself for a while longer. So instead of spilling the story she said: “At least we’re still alive.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Cal	"Oh.” “Come and sit down. [MASK].” He lingered by the window. The air was balmy, and clean. It reminded him— “What’s wrong?” she said. The words were on the tip of his tongue.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Immacolata	It must come, and then we will all be sand.” She stroked more furiously. “I told the rock.” “Will you tell me?" [MASK] glanced around, and then back to the rock.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Laverick	At the sound of his masters voice, [MASK] looked up, and tried to get his tongue around some words of explanation. But his palate wasn’t the equal of it. Instead, he crawled into a comer and hid his head.
<name>she</name>	she	Apolline	I want to do whatever I can for you.” “So you say,” [MASK] replied, without much conviction. She looked away toward the window, her tongue ferreting in her cheek for a polite word. “Do you know this wretched city well?”
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Shadwell	“Al hiyal,” the man replied, practically spitting the words out. “Huh?” "Al hiyal...” he said again, backing away from [MASK] as from a dangerous idiot, his hand at the knife in his belt.
<name>her</name>	her	Suzanna	What more perfect place for the Incantatrix to keep her Shrine? Death had always been her passion. The priest was scrabbling for a prayer in the passageway outside, but the gray, glittering smudge that hung in the air in front of [MASK] was unmoved.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Shadwell	“You can’t,” he said. “The Gyre’s forbidden territory, even to us. There are mysteries in there even Kind aren’t allowed to set eyes on.” “[MASK]’s going in.”
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Even	[MASK] its wheels seemed to dim, as if at any moment the engine would flicker out. Then, oh so quietly, it shaped the word in his head. Seer. Kind. And with the word came a spasm of energy, like lightning, that erupted in his skull.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Loretta	He heard a sigh, however, a woman's sigh. There was a couple in the shelter of the tree, he decided, doing what darkness had been created to conceal. Perhaps it was [MASK], her skirt up and her knickers down.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Hobart	His breath was rapid and rasping; his sun-skinned face dripped sweat. “Don’t let me fall,” he murmured. “We’re close now.” “Why don’t we wait a while before going any farther?” said [MASK].
<name>Tristram</name>	Tristram	Suzanna	“Go on, write that down. He’s a Cuckoo, and a salesman.” “You know this for certain?” the man said. “Tell me all.” “No time,” [MASK] replied, much to his aggravation.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Boaz	“Like human beings,” he replied. She gave him a tiny smile. “Why do you ask?” he wanted to know. But she didn’t have time to reply before [MASK] spoke. “There’s a Council been called,” he said.
<name>the protagonist</name>	the protagonist	Cal	Then she’d let the subject drop for a few days, only to raise it again when a cue was presented. History was repeating itself. Often in the course of these exchanges, which gradually became more heated, [MASK] could hear echoes of his mother and father: the same routes were being trodden afresh.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Hobart	Only now did she realize that [MASK]’s car was leading a convoy; there were headlamps shining through the back window from the vehicles behind. She summoned up strength enough to turn around. There was a Black Maria following, and several vehicles behind that.
<name>John</name>	John	Shadwell	They had brought four more of the Elite with them, which made up a firing squad of six. “I request you, one final time,” said [MASK] as the squad formed a line to either side of him, “don’t resist me.”
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Immacolata	“The Fugue can’t stay hidden much longer,” said [MASK]. “As soon as it’s moved it creates vibrations. It can’t help itself. So much life, pressed into such a hideaway.” “And do you feel any of these .. .
<name>Stephanie</name>	Stephanie	Suzanna	But that was the only outward damage. “How is he?” said a voice she didn’t know. She looked up to meet the harried gaze of a Cuckoo like herself, muffled up in several layers of clothing. “[MASK]?” he said.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Apolline	“Are you suggesting some kind of.. . offensive?” [MASK] shrugged. “Don’t know,” she said. “Maybe. Most of them are so damn passive. It sickens me, how they lie back and take whatever comes their way.
<name>James</name>	James	Cal	“Tell me, [MASK].” “I don’t know where to begin.” “Are you having a fling with this woman?” “No,” he said. Then thought: At least not that 1 remember. “Tell me then.”
<name>Mr. Radley</name>	Mr. Radley	Cal	At this point [MASK] could no longer countenance the children’s involvement. He told them to stand away as they went to assist in lifting the corpse. “Let them help,” one of the women chided him. “They’re enjoying themselves.”
<name>Morlocks</name>	Morlocks	Riffraff	He went down on his haunches, and examined the markings in the border. They were scarcely recognizable as human; more like commas with eyes. “These are people?” he said. “Oh yes. [MASK]; the lowest of the low.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Madonna	Inside, that instinct was confirmed: she was delivered from a cold, bland street into a haven for mysteries. She didn’t need to be a believer to find the candlelight and smell of incense persuasive: nor to be touched by the image of [MASK] and Christ child.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Shadwell	“You know who they are?” The sand hissed around [MASK]’s feet. I had forgotten. “It’s been a long time.” And you came here, to tell me? “To remind you.” Why? The barbs twitched again.
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Shadwell	They were within a dozen yards of the vestibule now, and with every step they took [MASK]’s courtesy decayed further. “They’ll drain you dry,” he warned. “Those sisters of hers. And I won’t be able to stop them, not once they’ve got their hands on you.
<name>The Doctor</name>	The Doctor	Cal	“Maybe you could tell us what year this is? 1910? 1911?” [MASK] laughed. “Give or take eighty years,” he said. The other man visibly paled, turning his face to the wall.
<name>unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Mooney	“Like I said, I don’t want to spill blood. So go back, [MASK]. Go on. Go on! Back the way you came or so help me I’ll blow your brains out.”
<name>Seer</name>	Seer	Nimrod	It was undoubtedly one of the Seerland, but no one he recognized. Or at least not the body. But the eye . .. “[MASK]?” he murmured. The creature had seen him, and crawled from its place of safety to the edge of the carpet.
<name>Joseph</name>	Joseph	Geraldine	The particulars were altered somewhat (a different street, a different prayer) but it was in essence the same warning; or prophecy. There was a gap of several days before the fourth dream, and this time [MASK] was with him.
<name>He</name>	He	Uriel	How far would he get if he tried to run now? A yard or two, probably. There was no escape. It knew; it heard. ‘Where is she?” [MASK] demanded. The demolished chamber was hushed from one end to the other.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Uriel	The sight of the executions replayed in his head—the bodies withering beneath that merciless fire: an angel’s fire. What had he done, stepping into the presence of such power? This was [MASK], of the principalities... .
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Cal	We boxed them all up, and brought them back down with us to examine at leisure. We could have made them fit our pet theories, you know . . . but now I think much of that’s in ruins.” “I’d like to see that stuff,” [MASK] said.
