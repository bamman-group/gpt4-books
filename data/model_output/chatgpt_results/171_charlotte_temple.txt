<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Montraville	“Well, and suppose he did?” “Why, he should be obliged to keep his word I think.” “Well, but I suppose he has changed his mind,” said [MASK], “and then you know the case is altered.”
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Julia	“Alas!” said [MASK], “I pity you.” “Oh thou condescending charmer,” said he, “how that sweet word cheers my sad heart. Indeed if you knew all, you would pity; but at the same time
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Montraville	The afternoon on which [MASK] had visited her she had found herself languid and fatigued, and after making a very slight dinner had lain down to endeavour to recruit her exhausted spirits, and, contrary to her expectations, had fallen asleep.
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Temple	“This is true philosophy,” said [MASK]. “‘Tis the only way to reconcile ourselves to the cross events of life,” replied he. “But I forget myself. I will not longer intrude on your patience, but proceed in my melancholy tale.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Charlotte	“Oh,” said [MASK], “you are very good to weep thus for me: it is a long time since I shed a tear for myself: my head and heart are both on fire, but these tears of your’s seem to cool and refresh it.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Lucy	My poor [MASK], distracted with her fears for us both, sunk on the floor and endeavoured to detain me by her feeble efforts, but in vain; they forced open her arms; she shrieked, and fell prostrate. But pardon me.
<name>Desdemona</name>	Desdemona	Montraville	“Oh [MASK],” said she, “kill me, for pity’s sake kill me, but do not doubt my fidelity. Do not leave me in this horrid situation; for the sake of your unborn child, oh! spurn not the wretched mother from you.”
<name>Mr. Bingley</name>	Mr. Bingley	Belcour	“Ah no,” said she. “I fear I shall never hear from him again.” “I am greatly of your opinion,” said [MASK], “for he has been for some time past greatly attached--”
<name>Mr. Mason</name>	Mr. Mason	Belcour	“To-morrow--but no, I cannot tell you what to-morrow will produce; [MASK] will inform you: he also has cash for you, which I beg you will ask for whenever you may want it.
<name>Mr. Knightley</name>	Mr. Knightley	Temple	“This is a strange place,” said he to [MASK], “to receive visitors of distinction in; but we must fit our feelings to our station. While I am not ashamed to own the cause which brought me here, why should I blush at my situation?
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Julia	“But where is the picture, Sir?” said [MASK]. “Here, Madam. I would not willingly part with it.” “It is the portrait of my mother,” said she, taking it from him: “‘tis all that remains.”
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Charlotte	“I must leave you.” “Say you will see me once again.” “I dare not,” said she. “Only for one half hour to-morrow evening: ‘tis my last request. I shall never trouble you again, [MASK].”
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Belcour	“If she were here,” she would cry, “she would certainly comfort me, and sooth the distraction of my soul.” She was sitting one afternoon, wrapped in these melancholy reflexions, when she was interrupted by the entrance of [MASK].
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Belcour	After he had sealed this letter he threw himself on the bed, and enjoyed a few hours repose. Early in the morning [MASK] tapped at his door: he arose hastily, and prepared to meet his Julia at the altar.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Charlotte	[MASK] is not dead.” “Then she is very ill, else why did she not come? But I will go to her: the chaise is still at the door: let me go instantly to the dear girl.
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Montraville	Another and another meeting succeeded; and so well did [MASK] improve each opportunity, that the heedless girl at length confessed no idea could be so painful to her as that of never seeing him again. “Then we will never be parted,” said he.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Mademoiselle	This letter has saved me: it has opened my eyes to the folly I was so near committing. I will not go, [MASK]; I will not wound the hearts of those dear parents who make my happiness the whole study of their lives.”
<name>Marianne</name>	Marianne	Lucy	“[MASK] and I have no ambitious notions: we can live on three hundred a year for some little time, till the mortgage is paid off, and then we shall have sufficient not only for the comforts but many of the little elegancies of life.
<name>Voltaire</name>	Voltaire	Blakeney	“My friend [MASK],” said he, addressing the old man, “told me I could be of service to you: be so kind then, dear Sir, as to point out some way in which I can relieve the anxiety of your heart and increase the pleasures of my own.”
<name>child</name>	child	CHARLOTTE	I beseech you, curse me not, my adored parents, but let a tear of pity and pardon fall to the memory of your lost “[MASK].” CHAPTER XXIII. A MAN MAY SMILE, AND SMILE, AND BE A VILLAIN.
<name>the person asking</name> (since there is no specific name given in the passage)	the person asking (since there is no specific name given in the passage)	Temple	“He has been abroad ever since,” replied the old man; “but he has left orders with his lawyer never to give up the note till the utmost farthing is paid.” “And how much is the amount of your debts in all?” said [MASK].
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Lucy	“Late as it was when this event took place, my affectionate [MASK] insisted on coming to me. ‘What must he feel,’ said she, ‘at our apparent neglect, and how shall I inform him of the afflictions with which it has pleased heaven to visit us?’
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	MONTRAVILLE	[MASK] was the youngest son of a gentleman of fortune, whose family being numerous, he was obliged to bring up his sons to genteel professions, by the exercise of which they might hope to raise themselves into notice.
<name>Henrietta</name>	Henrietta	Charlotte	A faint sickness came over her. “Gracious heaven,” said she, “is this possible?” and bursting into tears, she reclined the burning head of [MASK] on her own bosom; and folding her arms about her, wept over her in silence.
<name>Mr. Knightley</name>	Mr. Knightley	Mademoiselle	But,” said she pausing, and drawing the letter from her pocket, while a gentle suffusion of vermillion tinged her neck and face, “he gave me this letter; what shall I do with it?” “Read it, to be sure,” returned [MASK].
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Lucy	said he: “how approach that mansion, so late the habitation of peace? Alas! my dear [MASK], how will you support these heart-rending tidings? or how shall I be enabled to console you, who need so much consolation myself?”
<name>Cecilia</name>	Cecilia	Prithee	[MASK] open the letter, read it, and judge for yourself; if you show it your mother, the consequence will be, you will be taken from school, and a strict guard kept over you; so you will stand no chance of ever seeing the smart young officer again.”
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Charlotte	“I don’t believe it, [MASK],” said she, assuming a little vivacity; “for if you had not gone out, you would not have seen the gentleman who met us crossing the field; and I rather think you were pleased with his conversation.”
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	CHARLOTTE	How should he tell her that he was going to abjure her, to enter into the most indissoluble ties with another, and that he could not even own the infant which she bore as his child? Several letters were begun and destroyed: at length he completed the following: TO [MASK].
<name>Lucie</name>	Lucie	Charlotte	Every eye gave testimony of what each heart felt--but all were silent. When [MASK] recovered, she found herself supported in her father’s arms. She cast on him a most expressive look, but was unable to speak. A reviving cordial was administered.
<name>Juliet</name>	Juliet	Charlotte	My parents would never consent to our union; and even could they be brought to approve it, how should I bear to be separated from my kind, my beloved mother?” “Then you love your parents more than you do me, [MASK]?”
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Charlotte	I shall be alone; and, as we are both strangers in this country, we may hereafter be extremely happy in each other’s friendship.” “Your friendship, Madam,” said [MASK] blushing, “is an honour to all who are favoured with it.
<name>Godwin</name>	Godwin	Charlotte	Methinks I see a sarcastic smile sit on your countenance.--“And what,” cry you, “does the conceited author suppose we can glean from these pages, if [MASK] is held up as an object of terror, to prevent us from falling into guilty errors?
<name>Frank Churchill</name>	Frank Churchill	Montraville	Determined, therefore, to inform her of all that had happened, he again resumed his seat; and finding she began to be more composed, enquired if she had ever heard from [MASK] since the unfortunate recontre in her bed chamber. “Ah no,” said she.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Charlotte	“I can at least die here,” said [MASK], “I feel I cannot long survive this dreadful conflict. Father of mercy, here let me finish my existence.” Her agonizing sensations overpowered her, and she fell senseless on the floor.
<name>Tom Jones</name>	Tom Jones	Montraville	Such was the friend of [MASK]: will not the reader be ready to imagine, that the man who could regard such a character, must be actuated by the same feelings, follow the same pursuits, and be equally unworthy with the person to whom he thus gave his confidence?
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Charlotte	Be assured, my dear father, your happiness is mine. I shall rejoice in it, and sincerely love the person who contributes to it. But tell me,” continued she, turning to [MASK], “who is this lovely girl?
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Charlotte	for my part I could no more let a letter addressed to me lie unopened so long, than I could work miracles: he writes a good hand,” continued she, turning the letter, to look at the superscription. “‘Tis well enough,” said [MASK], drawing it towards her.
<name>Madam</name>	Madam	Charlotte	“Then you confess he sometimes visits you?” “He came sometimes by your desire.” “‘Tis false; I never desired him to come, and you know I did not: but mark me, [MASK], from this instant our connexion is at an end.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Montraville	could I flatter myself that a fear for my safety, or a wish for my welfare occasioned it, how happy would it make me.” “I shall ever wish you well, [MASK],” said she; “but we must meet no more.”
<name>Werther</name>	Werther	Charlotte	“AND am I indeed fallen so low,” said [MASK], “as to be only pitied? Will the voice of approbation no more meet my ear? and shall I never again possess a friend, whose face will wear a smile of joy whenever I approach?
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Charlotte	WHEN [MASK] was left to herself, she began to think what course she must take, or to whom she could apply, to prevent her perishing for want, or perhaps that very night falling a victim to the inclemency of the season.
<name>Strephon</name>	Strephon	Temple	the love-sick girl, when first she heard of [MASK]’s refusal, wept, raved, tore her hair, and vowed to found a protestant nunnery with her fortune; and by commencing abbess, shut herself up from the sight of cruel ungrateful man for ever.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Belcour	Alarming faintings now succeeded each other, and she was conveyed to her bed, from whence she earnestly prayed she might never more arise. [MASK] staid with her that night, and in the morning found her in a high fever.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Charlotte	“Why this seeming agitation? I thought the letter would have rejoiced, instead of distressing you.” “It does rejoice me,” replied [MASK], endeavouring at composure, “but I was praying for merit to deserve the unremitted attentions of the best of parents.”
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Lucy	He rose hastily, and rushing into the apartment where she was, folded his arms about her, and saying--“Let us be patient, my dear [MASK],” nature relieved his almost bursting heart by a friendly gush of tears.
<name>him</name>	him	Belcour	pointing to [MASK]. “As heaven is my witness,” replied she weeping, “I do not know. I have not seen him for these three weeks.” “Then you confess he sometimes visits you?” “He came sometimes by your desire.”
<name>John</name>	John	John	I declare she has flurried me so I shan’t be myself again this fortnight.” [MASK], assisted by his fellow-servant, raised and carried her down stairs. “Poor soul,” said he, “you shall not lay in the street this night.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Charlotte	“She is busy, no doubt,” said the governess, “in preparing [MASK] for her little excursion; but pleasure should never make us forget our duty to our Creator. Go, one of you, and bid them both attend prayers.”
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Belcour	No, [MASK], here let me hide my shame and sorrow, here let me spend my few remaining days in obscurity, unknown and unpitied, here let me die unlamented, and my name sink to oblivion.” Here her tears stopped her utterance.
<name>Mr. Bingley</name>	Mr. Bingley	Mademoiselle	The levity of the gentlemen and the freedom of their conversation disgusted her. She was astonished at the liberties [MASK] permitted them to take; grew thoughtful and uneasy, and heartily wished herself at home again in her own chamber.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Mademoiselle	She is not in the house at present; but as [MASK] is undoubtedly with her, she will speedily return in safety; and I hope they will both be able to account for this unseasonable absence in such a manner as shall remove our present uneasiness.”
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	George	“[MASK] chose the profession of a soldier. I had neither friends or money to procure him a commission, and had wished him to embrace a nautical life: but this was repugnant to his wishes, and I ceased to urge him on the subject.
<name>Werther</name>	Werther	Temple	When the heart has will, the hands can soon find means to execute a good action. [MASK] was a young man, his feelings warm and impetuous; unacquainted with the world, his heart had not been rendered callous by being convinced of its fraud and hypocrisy.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Charlotte	“What can be the matter?” said he, rising and opening the door: “I fear some accident has befallen my dear girl.” The governess entered. The visible agitation of her countenance discovered that something extraordinary had happened. “Where is [MASK]?”
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Julia	I would if I dared, if I thought I merited your attention--but no, I must not--honour forbids. I am beneath your notice, [MASK], I am miserable and cannot hope to be otherwise.”
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	Lewis	He then went to a coffee-house in the neighbourhood and wrote a long affectionate letter to me, blaming himself severely for having introduced [MASK] into the family, or permitted him to confer an obligation, which had brought inevitable ruin on us all.
<name>Mr. Woodhouse</name>	Mr. Woodhouse	Temple	[MASK] was moved even to tears. “You will both live many years,” said he, “and I hope see much happiness. Cheerly, my friend, cheerly; these passing clouds of adversity will serve only to make the sunshine of prosperity more pleasing.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Charlotte	“My dear child,” said the affectionate governess, “what is the cause of the languor so apparent in your frame? Are you not well?” “Yes, my dear Madam, very well,” replied [MASK], attempting to smile, “
<name>John</name>	John	Montraville	It was certainly extremely wrong. It was indelicate. She mentioned her thoughts to [MASK]. He laughed at her simplicity, called her a little idiot, and patting her on the cheek, said she knew nothing of the world.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Mademoiselle	“Perhaps I may,” said she. “Adieu then. I will live upon that hope till we meet again.” He kissed her hand. She sighed an adieu, and catching hold of [MASK]’s arm, hastily entered the garden gate.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Charlotte	Who can form an adequate idea of the sorrow that preyed upon the mind of [MASK]? The wife, whose breast glows with affection to her husband, and who in return meets only indifference, can but faintly conceive her anguish.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Charlotte	Early the next morning she again visited [MASK], and found her tolerably composed; she called her by name, thanked her for her goodness, and when her child was brought to her, pressed it in her arms, wept over it, and called it the offspring of disobedience.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Temple	“You must not go, indeed you must not; it will be of no use.” “[MASK],” said she, assuming a look of firmness and composure, “tell me the truth I beseech you. I cannot bear this dreadful suspense.
<name>Werther</name>	Werther	Montraville	[MASK] placed me here, and promised to defray all my expenses: but he has forgot his promise, he has forsaken me, and I have no friend who has either power or will to relieve me. Let me hope, as you see my unhappy situation, your charity--”
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Montraville	When [MASK] chose the profession of arms, his father presented him with a commission, and made him a handsome provision for his private purse. “Now, my boy,” said he, “go! seek glory in the field of battle.
<name>Sophia</name>	Sophia	Belcour	I would wish every gentleman here therefore to remember that her honour henceforth is mine, and,” continued he, looking at [MASK], “should any man presume to speak in the least disrespectfully of her, I shall not hesitate to pronounce him a scoundrel.”
<name>Imogen</name>	Imogen	Charlotte	“Would I!” said [MASK], clasping her hands; “would not the poor sailor, tost on a tempestuous ocean, threatened every moment with death, gladly return to the shore he had left to trust to its deceitful calmness?
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Belcour	“If I can once convince her that she has a rival,” said he, “she will listen to my passion if it is only to revenge his slights.” [MASK] knew but little of the female heart; and what he did know was only of those of loose and dissolute lives.
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Charlotte	This eloquent harangue was given with such volubility, that [MASK] could not find an opportunity to interrupt her, or to offer a single word till the whole was finished, and then found her ideas so confused, that she knew not what to say.
<name>Belinda</name>	Belinda	Charlotte	“Oh [MASK], conscience tells me it was I, villain that I am, who first taught you the allurements of guilty pleasure; it was I who dragged you from the calm repose which innocence and virtue ever enjoy; and can
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Charlotte	[MASK] watched by him till a late hour, and then, lying softly down by his side, sunk into a profound sleep, from whence she awoke not till late the next morning. CHAPTER XX. Virtue never appears so amiable as when reaching forth her hand to raise a fallen sister.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Charlotte	“Take up this letter,” said [MASK]: “tell her the unhappy writer of it waits in her hall for an answer.” The tremulous accent, the tearful eye, must have moved any heart not composed of adamant.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Montraville	and she had committed the letter to the care of [MASK] to be sent to the post office, she became more calm, and indulging the delightful hope of soon receiving an answer that would seal her pardon, she in some measure assumed her usual cheerfulness.
<name>Mrs. Weston</name>	Mrs. Weston	Temple	“She is a good girl,” said [MASK]. “She is, indeed,” replied the fond mother exultingly, “a grateful, affectionate girl; and I am sure will never lose sight of the duty she owes her parents.”
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Charlotte	The wife, whose breast glows with affection to her husband, and who in return meets only indifference, can but faintly conceive her anguish. Dreadfully painful is the situation of such a woman, but she has many comforts of which our poor [MASK] was deprived.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Montraville	[MASK] started; a momentary flush of resentment crossed his cheek, but instantly gave place to a death-like paleness, occasioned by painful remembrance remembrance awakened by that monitor, whom, though we may in vain endeavour, we can never entirely silence.
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Lucy	“There is one misfortune which is worse than death. But I know my child too well to suspect--” “Be not too confident, [MASK].” “Oh heavens!” said she, “what horrid images do you start: is it possible she should forget--”
<name>Mr. Knightley</name>	Mr. Knightley	Temple	I know she will be delighted; and to complete all, they shall have some music, and finish with a dance.” “A very fine plan, indeed,” said [MASK], smiling; “and you really suppose I will wink at your indulging the girl in this manner?
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Charlotte	whilst I adore the benignant rays that cheered and illumined my heart, I mourn that their influence cannot extend to all the sons and daughters of affliction. “Indeed, Madam,” said poor [MASK] in a tremulous accent, “I am at a loss what to do.
<name>Frank Churchill</name>	Frank Churchill	Montraville	“Did you not notice her?” continued [MASK]: “she had on a blue bonnet, and with a pair of lovely eyes of the same colour, has contrived to make me feel devilish odd about the heart.”
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Montraville	“But come,” continued she tenderly, “you shall go to bed, and I will sit by, and watch you; you will be better when you have slept.” [MASK] was glad to retire, and by pretending sleep, hide the agitation of his mind from her penetrating eye.
<name>Fanny</name>	Fanny	Julia	“Certainly,” said she, “the service you have rendered me, the knowledge of your worth, all combine to make me esteem you.” “Esteem, my lovely [MASK],” said he passionately, “is but a poor cold word.
<name>Mr. Pickwick</name>	Mr. Pickwick	Montraville	“I never think of the future,” replied [MASK]; “but am determined to make the most of the present, and would willingly compound with any kind Familiar who would inform me who the girl is, and how I might be likely to obtain an interview.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Charlotte	“She may be richer, may be handsomer,” cried [MASK], “but cannot love him so well. Oh may she beware of his art, and not trust him too far as I have done.”
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Charlotte	“True,” replied [MASK], “but you do not feel what I do.” She then bade her good night: but sleep was a stranger to her eyes, and the tear of anguish watered her pillow. CHAPTER XII.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	George	Father of mercies, spare me!’ She fell into a strong convulsion, and expired in about two hours. In the mean time, a surgeon had dressed [MASK]’s wounds; but they were in such a situation as to bar the smallest hopes of recovery.
<name>daughter</name>	daughter	Charlotte	“Will my once kind, my ever beloved mother, deign to receive a letter from her guilty, but repentant child? or has she, justly incensed at my ingratitude, driven the unhappy [MASK] from her remembrance? Alas! thou much injured mother!
<name>Fanny</name>	Fanny	Charlotte	However prudent [MASK] might be in these resolutions, she certainly did not take a proper method to confirm herself in them. Several times in the course of the day, she indulged herself in reading over the letter, and each time she read it, the contents sunk deeper in her heart.
<name>Becky</name>	Becky	Montraville	“And you will come to-morrow,” said [MASK]. “Perhaps I may,” said she. “Adieu then. I will live upon that hope till we meet again.” He kissed her hand. She sighed an adieu, and catching hold of
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Charlotte	[MASK] bowed her head in silence; but the anguish of her heart was too great to permit her to articulate a single word. CHAPTER XXX. And what is friendship but a name, A charm that lulls to sleep, A shade that follows wealth and fame, But leaves the wretch to weep.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Charlotte	Adieu, [MASK]: could you still find charms in a life of unoffend-ing innocence, return to your parents; you shall never want the means of support both for yourself and child. Oh! gracious heaven!
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Belcour	Vanity led him to think that pleasure at again beholding him might have occasioned the emotion he had witnessed, and the same vanity led him to wish to see her again. “She is the sweetest girl in the world,” said he, as he entered the inn. [MASK] stared.
<name>Madame Beck</name>	Madame Beck	Charlotte	At length he found an hour to spare, and walked out to spend it with [MASK]: it was near four o’clock in the afternoon when he arrived at her cottage; she was not in the parlour, and without calling the servant he walked up stairs, thinking to find her in her bed room.
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Charlotte	[MASK]! how ill have you requited our tenderness! But, Father of Mercies,” continued she, sinking on her knees, and raising her streaming eyes and clasped hands to heaven, “this once vouchsafe to hear a fond, a distracted mother’s prayer.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Charlotte	“It does,” said she. “[MASK] is well, but cannot return today.” “Not return, Madam? where is she? who will detain her from her fond, expecting parents?”
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Montraville	[MASK] leaned on a broken gate, and looked earnestly at the house. The wall which surrounded it was high, and perhaps the Argus’s who guarded the Hesperian fruit within, were more watchful than those famed of old.
<name>He</name>	He	Montraville	A full sense of her own situation rushed upon her mind. She burst into tears, and remained silent. [MASK] too well understood the cause of her tears. He kissed her cheek, and bidding her not make herself uneasy, unable to bear the silent but keen remonstrance, hastily left her.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Lucy	“I was so weak as to be almost unable to speak. I pressed [MASK]’s hand, and looked earnestly round the apartment in search of another dear object. “Where is your mother?” said I, faintly.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Montraville	She saw, that the contents had awakened new emotions in her youthful bosom: she encouraged her hopes, calmed her fears, and before they parted for the night, it was determined that she should meet [MASK] the ensuing evening. CHAPTER VIII. DOMESTIC PLEASURES PLANNED.
