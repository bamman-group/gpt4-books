<name>Stan</name>	Stan	Boss	[MASK] is better than some others I know. It’s a big job, should keep me goin’ rest of the year.” “That’s good. Is the minister orright?” “The minister’s orright. He got a bloody tartar for a wife.”
<name>Amos</name>	Amos	Mort	For there was no question that the blood of women overrode all kinship loyalty, and yet that he himself must keep to a reprisal list if his soul were not to freeze about the cold fact of the Newby killings. [MASK] must either be incriminated for fear of losing him or lost for fear of incriminating him.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jimmie	Now, coming into the shearers’ cookhouse, [MASK] found he had broken the cook’s concentration and flustered the girl. The cook said bitterly, “But why should you be worked on by an amateur? Here comes the witchdoctor of the shearing floor.”
<name>Warrigal</name>	Warrigal	Jimmie	“Hungry,” the small girl said. “I were hungry.” “There yer are, old girl,” [MASK] said, in the almost Cockney accent of the aborigine speaking English. He gave her the fruit for comfort.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Mort	[MASK]’s eyes also shone. He wanted company. “We wouldn’t hurt him, missus,” he said in actual apology. “Three thousan’ sure t’ catch us in the end. Then he kin come home.”
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Harry	“I’m going t’ see the magistrate. While I’m away I want yer t’ take [MASK] down, take his clothes off and bum ’em, wash him and wrap him up in a blanket, head and everythink. There’ll have to be a inquest.”
<name>Stavrogin</name>	Stavrogin	Jimmie	It gave them leave from the corroding business of being incubi; absolved them from the bogy role. At once [MASK] saw the remote potentiality of becoming a figure of myth in this first breaking of the monumental visage of appal the press had so far turned towards their fumbling homicide and talent for flight.
<name>Alvin</name>	Alvin	McCreadie	A desecrated aisle opened out spaciously, and to one side of the inner wall stood a prow of stone in tilted layers. Perhaps the fertilized ovum, [MASK] surmised, on the womb-wall. Did the elders know as much anatomy as that?
<name>Yob</name>	Yob	Jimmie	We wanted white ones to kill Soon there will be white ones, tribe on tribe. We shall make a mighty killing.” “So’ll bloody they,” [MASK] said. “We shall die in courage. They will chatter about the courage of Tullam man.”
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Clarice	My dear [MASK], I was delighted to have your last and was very touched by your predictions of my success in Federal politics. If I thought that a third of the electorate shared a third of your view I would have no hesitation at all in resigning my State seat and launching out....
<name>Mick</name>	Mick	Jimmie	But [MASK] knew that if he were contradicted, there would be sudden havoc. He put his money into his pocket. “Well, posts is solid, boss, rails cut good. Kin yer give me a ref’rence?” “Bejesus, ye’re a fussy bloody black.
<name>Stan</name>	Stan	Jimmie	It came to [MASK] that although they were church-wed and had been named a family, they still had very little right of reply in a population that sprouted blunt precept. “Some of the stuff I couldn’t tell yer. It was . . .
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Gilda	He thought how close he must have been to siring it; the cruel odds of the seed. -At a second look, he could tell immediately whose child it was. The superior cook’s. But he would never have married [MASK].
<name>Brigid</name>	Brigid	Tabidgi	It’s good o’ yer t’ go t’ the trouble. It’s a long walk yer come.” In invocatory style, [MASK] recited all the well-omened places they had passed, all the evil grounds too, to find their kinsman in his need.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Jimmie	He knew what sickness [MASK] was suffering. Having a true talent for religion, he understood the obsessive spiral, and understood that he himself might have been sent racketing around it if ever he had touched a black woman.
<name>Madonna</name>	Madonna	Virgin	Yes they would, pretty baby.” She produced a brown cord with two little felt squares attached, one of them a picture of [MASK] and Child. She arranged the cord about the child’s neck so that one square lay on its chest, the other fell down its back.
<name>Quilty</name>	Quilty	Jimmie	It was all so simple: they wanted to go on being seen as the two gay fugitives of the caricature. And this teacher was a man to whom they could speak of their crimes in level, wholesome, even comic terms. [MASK] could not have explained all this.
<name>He</name>	He	Mort	[MASK] asked dismally, as if the terms they were negotiating had shrunk to that. “There won’t be anythin’ more bad happen t’ yer, missus,” he muttered at the woman while the teacher went fumbling for rum in the kitchen cupboard.
<name>Barthelemy</name>	Barthelemy	Hyberry	and moment of death were known. He would never have asked if sedatives were used; it was not his business. On the scaffold, [MASK] stood at the left-rear corner. The condemned scarcely ever looked at him when they came up onto the platform.
<name>Sean</name>	Sean	Toban	They ought t’ put out in front of recruiting places a sign that says Recruits ought to be told that if they join Her Majesty’s Forces they might have to bloody well fight Boers.” [MASK], son of the son of an Irish evictee, spoke as expected.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jimmie	Asked if he wanted to say anything, the old man rose and spoke as follows: “1 only wanted to give [MASK] his initiation tooth [a ritual tooth to remind a black of his tribal obligations —Ed.] to let him know he shouldn't have married a white girl.
<name>Thorn</name>	Thorn	Mort	Until the sun was high in the north, he ignored her. Then he told them all to rest and began himself to cook a forequarter of the carcass [MASK] had butchered, quickly bled and cheerfully carried all morning.
<name>Orm</name>	Orm	Hyberry	he wanted to know, as if it was [MASK] who had been delaying him with abominations. By now the Blacksmith brothers had crossed to the rainy side of the mountains. Dying trees wore long mosses, the tree ferns were tall, and underfoot was deep lush mould full of prosperous insects.
<name>Quiggin</name>	Quiggin	Jacko	“[MASK]?” he called. “He’s an honest poor bastard but he’s nearly extinct.” “And, surprisingly, that is the work of those you so fancifully call Australians.” “It’s a hard country. Lower ways of life give way to higher.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Gilda	He had been droving steers to new pasture. [MASK] always avoided him if she could, but he rolled up to her on his horse, vaulted out of the saddle and exposed his patriarchal blunt genitals, slug-white and sitting in his hand for her information.
<name>Willard</name>	Willard	Jimmie	[MASK] hoped it would give onto rain-forest. Soon it did; cluttered, homelier, creeping with insect industry. Staghorns grew on the trees and tipped crystal water into their sleeping faces. Quick wakeful brown snakes were out in their new skins.
<name>He</name>	He	Jimmie	In our world, the delusions that killers let into their bloodstreams are the stuff of newsprint and videotape. A reader should be spared. Enough to say: [MASK] admitted to his body a drunken judgmental majesty, a sense that the sharp-edged stars impelled him.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Clarice	My beloved [MASK], It is ridiculous that I should not be able to see you. I beg of you, leave him. He is a man devoted to failing in life. He is too blunt to succeed.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Nancy	[MASK] took them aside. She had a flat solemn pleasant face. The Blacksmith brothers could hear what she told them. •e two fellers pretty bloody tough, cut yer water off y throat like as not. You git off with yer into bush -.uu catch possum a few hours.
<name>Rowena</name>	Rowena	Mort	The schoolie needs a cup.” “Don’t be such a bloody ole lubra. He’s here fer us. We’re not here fer bloody him.” “[MASK] wants one too.” “Fuckin’ ole women’s church turn-out.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Healy	Damper and butter at breakfast, bacon and etceteras at sunset. At noon he had a drink of tea. After a week he had post-and-railed a hundred yards. Such fast work didn’t quite accord with [MASK]’s mental budgeting.
<name>Francie</name>	Francie	Jimmie	Near dusk they saw the lights and heard the groan of a sawmill on their right. Then the oozing dark came down. They must steal a hurricane lamp, thought [MASK]. The wet brush spanked their thighs. They must steal oilskins.
<name>Rooster</name>	Rooster	Healy	Like the duke, [MASK] had the air of a basilisk. “Yer have any religion? Other than nigger?” “Methodist, boss.” “Then I give yer me Christian promise that I’ll cut yore bloody black balls out if yer mess this job.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Newby	Now it came to him that if one reject married another, the facts of their individual rejections might be added or even multiplied. He suppressed this suspicion for fear of having to unmake his mind to marry, for fear too of [MASK]’s mockery.
<name>Tommo</name>	Tommo	Jimmie	How’s he?” “He’s feedin’ well. Real well. And he slep’ well.” “Righto.” “[MASK]?” “Yair?” “I don’ care if yer shoot me fer sayin’ it.”
<name>She</name>	She	Jimmie	He sat in corners studiously spitting bloody phlegm into a peach tin. You could have fitted a cricket ball between the sagging ganglions at the base of his throat. Of course, [MASK] vacated the marriage mattress and slept wrapped in a blanket, slept strenuously, sapped and in shock.
<name>Jimmy</name>	Jimmy	Dowie	But [MASK] shook his head. He felt he had become a figure of sentiment and that the sentiment must be maintained. He spoke of “being in at the kill”. His father, besides, kept sending bank-drafts, as if their share in a black whore compelled him to it.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Gilda	Of course, [MASK] told him over and over that she had been certain it was his, that it was astounding to her that the baby should have the cook’s long head. There was high moral glee in the women of the homestead.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Jimmie	She was very young and her legs were freckled. Yet [MASK] had seen in her a chance of white marriage very soon after their first meeting, or at least very soon after that Sabbath incident on the riverbank. Even then he had observed her. She was very stupid.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Toban	Secretly he mastered a compul- sion to tell them all to shut up their sombre prognostications. For they nearly all knew what it was to slaver after dark women. Even [MASK]. And he couldn’t blame that on evictions.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	McCreadie	“Wives of schoolteachers,” [MASK] said. “In rural areas . . . Rural areas—Christ! . . . Three shillings allowance a week. For taking sewing lessons . . . Three shillings! ... I call that . . . generous.”
<name>She</name>	She	Jimmie	They had been together for a few hours then, had made love so dismal that [MASK], at the summer’s end when the arrangement was made, could scarcely remember a single tone of its emotion or even a physical feature of it.
<name>he</name>	he	Sally	Then another just for carrying, so that [MASK] lost two. An old man went ahead with a storm lantern, then the eight or nine carriers and a boy dragging a eucalyptus bough. The earth was uneven but the corpse light.
<name>He</name>	He	Jimmie	But it was cold. [MASK] was aware of the precarious warmth of his body moving through absorbent veils of cold. They were above two thousand feet when they stopped. Below them they could see a line of campfires, though they could not afford one for themselves.
<name>Antoine</name>	Antoine	Jimmie	The boy was to be married today but was fatally sad. He could not be persuaded to put on his wedding suit. And so on. [MASK] slept in hell. One day the sun struck at him, quick as a blow. Something had gone wrong.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Jimmie	He had left seven bed frames, a few old copies of the Herald and the Freeman's Journal and one black-and-white coral snake in methylated spirits. It was easy to feel sad at these few relics of hope, though [MASK] remembered immediately his own depredations against far more prosperous hopes.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	McCreadie	Within two minutes he was back with the schoolteacher. He carried [MASK] in his arms, putting him to ground to open and close the yowling country gates. In this way he acted the reliable cross-country traveller.
<name>horses</name>	horses	Jimmie	The balance was adjusted, the junior senior constable thought, by using [MASK] for private convenience, such as for fetching meat from the butcher’s. Sometimes he rode on duty up the pass to that camp of bad omen where the white boy had been knifed and inadequately buried a year before.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Jimmie	From the dark end of the hall he sighted the sick nun, tonight lying blank-faced on a sofa. Another nun, whose back was to him, occasionally wiped her face with a damp cloth. [MASK] coveted the moisture in the cloth but had no compulsion to surrender.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Newby	He had dropped everything, his load of food, his rifle. “I goin’ t’ take yer t’ the Dubbo road. Yer’ll git rescued by a farmer or somethink. Tell the p’lice I said I declared war. Tell ’em about how bloody measly [MASK] was.
<name>Thorn</name>	Thorn	McCreadie	For that insect rant was at the heart of their first memories; their first prey on summer mornings about 1886. They were near the coast road now, going very slowly yet, luckily, in an unlikely corner of the coastal hills. [MASK] was not better.
<name>Jimmy</name>	Jimmy	Blacksmith	As inexcusable as [MASK]'s crimes are, there was almost certainly some white provocation of the young half-caste, especially in the matter of his marriage to a white girl. So that one wonders if society is yet ready to accept the ambitious aborigine.
<name>Pegeen</name>	Pegeen	Jimmie	“I’ll tell you,” said the schoolmaster, “if I get one of my chest inflammations . . .” “Go an’ fill up the can,” said [MASK]. “That’ll help keep yer warm.”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Mort	As long as the boundary fence holds? . . . Why bother? . . . Forty per cent . . . They don’t know . . . They don’t want to know.” Now they were close enough for [MASK] to see the slanting roof of the farm.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jimmie	Beyond the window there was a benign splendour of frost and unequivocal early sunlight. The wet fences of the town ran downhill and, pitched into the bottom of the valley, the main street had a new-born look which [MASK] loved yet knew would not last much beyond nine o’clock.
<name>Stan</name>	Stan	Mort	Off yer go.” Unbuttoning, [MASK] said, “Who’s this Constable Harrogate?” “All the blacks’ camps got a constable, pertect ’em against angry whitefellers. There lot of whites with rifles ridin’ up and down the countryside.”
<name>Alvar</name>	Alvar	Jimmie	Be careful and do not sleep, For nothing more terrible than Tullam man Will ever break the sleep of living man. Be careful, When the moon turns pale, It is for Tullam man. When stars run for the cover of thunderheads, It is for Tullam man.... [MASK] welcomed the song.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Healy	What d’yer need rif’rences for? A job in a bank?” “So I kin show it t’other people wantin’ fences done.” [MASK]’s laugh could not have been understood unless you knew that at its heart stood a primitive algebra.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Jimmie	His decree ran hypnotically between the woman and his visitors. [MASK] was furious with the wrong sort of fury, the anger of a subordinate. He savaged the tins above the mantel but left enough for a meal or two in each.
<name>Desmond</name>	Desmond	Jimmie	A tableau recurred to him, a vineyard of gallows from which hung all the inept, unfortunate race, emphatically asleep. Their limbs span in a breeze, so well had sleep invaded all their ligaments. It’d be a good thing, [MASK] felt sure; like a white realist.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jimmie	The Newby sisters knotted their chins against her screams; hadn’t she earned them? The birth was quite normal, and the Newby girls learned a great deal. [MASK] was not allowed to see the child for several hours—he was kept squatting by the woodheap.
<name>Chike</name>	Chike	Jackie	[MASK] asked but obeyed. There was so much he did not understand about the white world, and perhaps the reasons for carrying a concealed chopper under your coat while interviewing a farmer’s wife were beyond his mental strength.
<name>Sammy</name>	Sammy	Mort	“If yer couldn’ work like yer do, I’d boot yer black arse out of here.” It was, in fact, all nervousness with [MASK], and a desire to give a kind of welcome.
<name>Chigurh</name>	Chigurh	Yair	He three parts white.” “[MASK]. And his kid’ll be an eighth black and his a sixteenth. But it doesn’t matter how many times yer descendants bed down, they’ll never get anything that don’t have the tarbrush in it.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Healy	It could almost be said that he did not choose her as a woman at all, rather as an archetype. In the corner of his glistening property, [MASK] laughed to his neighbour and went to join his wife.
<name>Hyena</name>	Hyena	Mort	The groom was a half-breed half-wit who chuckled like [MASK], yet far more vacantly, far more quietly. He sat in corners studiously spitting bloody phlegm into a peach tin. You could have fitted a cricket ball between the sagging ganglions at the base of his throat.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jimmie	[MASK] glanced at her, very angry that he should be vulnerable before such a poor woman. “I don’t go in fer that son of stuff, Mister cook.” “Aha! Dark and deadly tribal secrets!” the cook called out like a busker at a country sideshow.
<name>Europeans</name>	Europeans	Europeans	“We [MASK] are so poor in spirit that the best we can do is laugh at primitive people who, in my experience, always have something, God knows what it is, but something." The girl sniffed at the word something.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jimmie	It could have been a logger’s. It could as likely have been a miser’s. For [MASK] had heard of misers in this part of the country, where the defiles were said to run with alluvial gold and the jungly ridges hid prodigal veins of quartz.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jimmie	“I wouldn’t boast about the white girl if I was you.” He snatched up two more notes, in token of the hopelessness of [MASK]’s marriage with the nice girl out of a home, and as if he felt he must choose between paying some debt now rather than later.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Jimmie	In any case it was only a formality. Now, although she could see [MASK]’s Enfield, she dropped her own weapon in the corner by the door. She was in her slippers and a comfortable dress, and was not easily made afraid.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Jimmie	[MASK] roared, pointing to it. “Of course we got a fire. This country’s too damp. . . .” With his way of forcing every demand to a peak of challenge, it was a wonder the old man hadn’t been shot fifty years past.
<name>Tristram</name>	Tristram	Dud	For some seconds, he felt he was about to assent. Then something unfortunate happened. [MASK] had not really wished to speak honestly, not with penetrating honesty. He was, in fact, the sort of man whom society could depend on not to let the cat out.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Jimmie	The Verona people were to be punished for their vulnerability. There was a lust in him to punish the race through the man who had done the knifing. Near the dry tip of [MASK]’s tongue the man’s name wavered.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Knoller	At last there was only a sixty-year-old deaf lady buying cat-meat, and [MASK] began on the atrocity of the Friday night before, reading details aloud from the Morning Herald. “I know that area well,” he said.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Farrell	Soon there was a stink of corpse and men warded it off with hands and groans and hysterical chuckling. [MASK] hit one of the laughers and more of them laughed, and attained paroxysms by the time the bones appeared in their remnants of wet flesh.
<name>Why</name>	Why	Chris	An axe was more apt. He eased the cutting edges out of the hardwood block and told his uncle to hide the block-buster under his coat, and then sent him off to the door for one last, formal tempting of white contumacy. “[MASK]’ why?”
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Jimmie	[MASK] thought that if he had her alone for ten minutes, he’d teach her to sniff; though he did not consciously know what he meant by the thought, something less blunt but more compelling than a beating or sexual havoc.
<name>Smudger</name>	Smudger	McCreadie	“Why do we want t’ go buggerin’ round a place like that? ” [MASK]’s wide eyes flitted about for a reason. “There’s no one to visit it any more,” was the best he could manage.
<name>Wesley</name>	Wesley	McCreadie	Against the spitting fire and within the dome-like, hollow noise of rain in timber, the rasp of [MASK]’s patient strangulation could be easily heard. “You better let me go,” he’d murmur. “I wasn’t raised to do this sort of thing.”
<name>Brangwen</name>	Brangwen	Mort	The impact sat her suddenly flat on the boards. How distressed [MASK] was! He knelt by the woman, unable to believe in the rough bloody damage he had done her. He had not learned that a person catches deadliness as a disease is caught.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Jimmie	Perhaps he did not want to be caught by the momentum of her despair, which became more explicit the more she wept. A slowly descending white was wedded to a black in the ascendant. That was what [MASK] hoped had happened. He hoped they might survive on his momentum.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Mort	After a dark glutinous incubation, they now had a short season to rant, to burr and shriek notches in the night’s smoothest edge. For the first time [MASK] felt hostile to them. In his nineteen years he had never thought of being hostile or otherwise.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Gilda	And knowing himself such, he would have untold liberties of rage and rampage. Every night he would buffet and rut away against [MASK], threatening that she’d bear a blackie yet. Her menstrual blood put him to flight one night.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Jimmie	[MASK] crouched and as if from curiosity but with massive secret fear picked up some of the more cleanly broken stones and pieced them together, keeping on his face a handyman frown. Close to him the teacher’s eager breath grated like a pump.
<name>Stanley</name>	Stanley	Mort	He pointed out the weapon, abandoned on the veranda boards. Improbably the woman continued, past the woodheap, bleeding onto the grass and blurring the patterns of her blood with the passage of her knees. “Yer got a dinkum rifle now,” he told [MASK].
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Alort	It was hard for [MASK] to understand that some men’s bodies might put up physical barriers against fifteen-mile-a-day marches in rain forests. It was easier to believe that they—his brother and he—had passed on some malignancy.
<name>he</name>	he	Jimmie	although she had known that this was all she could expect; and if [MASK] had asked her what else she wanted she could not have answered. She knew well enough what her rights were. She could feel them in her marrow. They were not ample rights.
<name>Mac</name>	Mac	Nancy	Everything was so quiet; it was one of those nights when you can almost hear the frost turning to crytal on the earth. “Don’ leave yer food,” [MASK] begged them, for they looked like men about to sprint. “Don’ leave yer bloody blankets.
<name>Roche</name>	Roche	Jimmie	No blackie in her.” “What about the little blackie yer started in her? Eh, [MASK], yer filthy bastard?” “It happens more’n yer think, boss.” “Don’ tell me what happens. I know what bloody happens.”
<name>Desdemona</name>	Desdemona	Jimmie	He would hold his breath and take the risk of beginning to speak of bloodlust and murder. “I can understand your being angry,” he would say in the midst of a night silence. “Oh, I can imagine it, [MASK].
<name>Snobby</name>	Snobby	Jimmie	I told yer. ’Im maybe killed by some bloody Verona black.” All the women at their doors began shrilling. At this stage, the murderer’s name had become an almost involuntary spasm of [MASK]’s tongue and he could not prevent himself taking a risk.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Jimmie	The woods became sparser and there were lamps twenty miles away, across the river, that they could see, and ones nearby, one mile or three. The night was a royal blue but distances were unscannable. [MASK] was about to flit into this soft temperate night.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Healy	It had brought her very close to the homestead gate. But before she had got that far, [MASK] came riding up on a tall black horse with white facing. He was fully visible through the open kitchen door. In his hand was the second household rifle.
<name>Augie</name>	Augie	Jimmy	Without warning, newsprint in disarray all about him, [MASK] understood that he had a copious love in him and had not spent it. He would die with his head full (he thought of it as a headful) of unspent love.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Gilda	“Thanks won’t get yer far. Yer force me to say it. Yore a scandal t’ all of us.” The women watched [MASK] avidly, as if waiting for her to take some decision owed to them. Why was she depended on?
<name>Wickenden</name>	Wickenden	Jimmie	There was one of those near-comic crushes—somehow implying the parlous state of [MASK]’s command—at the doorway, where the schoolmaster halted for the sake of frankness. “By the way, you aren’t going to believe me if I say I’ve got no arms in the house.
<name>Wicksteed</name>	Wicksteed	Hyberry	“Hah!” he’d say secretively, whenever he met [MASK], “tell me, Grand Master, did you ever go to sea? ” They might talk health, weather and the vague politics which are all a politician can afford to speak with strangers.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Mort	The water had a slight vegetable stink to it, but was delightfully chilled. He drank and went back to meet [MASK], whose luck had probably been similar. It was sick-grey quarter-light and the harsh myrtle-trees watched him with the remote quizzicality of witnesses.
<name>Wylie</name>	Wylie	Mullett	Late on an afternoon of blinding headwinds, they crossed the railway two miles east of the Merriwa terminus and, in case their tracks be found, walked four or five furlongs westward on the rails before turning north for [MASK]’s place.
