<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Nerissa	The puppies were sucking; the bitch was proud and requited. All of the litter were well favored and well marked. When [MASK] and the veterinary left the kennels, a cold white light was beating up beyond the dark trees of the estate.
<name>Isadora</name>	Isadora	Marcie	"Then, still feeling very springy and full of fun, I walked back toward the door, stopping to admire the curve of [MASK]’s breasts and deciding, in a blaze of charity, to let her sleep.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Clancy	Traffic was slow on the elevator, and he stood at the front door, watching the people on the sidewalk. Most of them were dressed in their best clothes and they were off to enjoy themselves. [MASK]’s best wishes followed them all.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Cash	Then she would take a bath and put on her best slip. [MASK], passing the bedroom door, would see her. Her slip was transparent, and suddenly he was all repentance, tenderness, charm, wisdom, and love. “Oh, my darling!”
<name>Mrs. Ramsay</name>	Mrs. Ramsay	Esther	Whenever anyone suggested getting a cleaning woman, [MASK] would say, “We can’t afford a cleaning woman, and anyhow I don’t have anything to do. I don’t mind doing the housework, only I just wish you all would remember not to track sand into the living room . . .
<name>Mr. Baxter</name>	Mr. Baxter	Charlie	And if you want to take these things out to the elevator, we’ll have your dinner ready for you in a minute.” He carried the things into the elevator and came back for the tray. “Merry Christmas, [MASK]!”
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Ned	Their pool was perhaps the oldest in the country, a fieldstone rectangle, fed by a brook. It had no filter or pump and its waters were the opaque gold of the stream. “I’m swimming across the county,” [MASK] said.
<name>The narrator</name>	The narrator	Peaches	I made them go. Nothing can be done for me. I get along all right on this wagon. When I’m hungry, I make a sandwich. I wanted them to go. I made them go. [MASK] needed a vacation, and I like being alone.
<name>He</name>	He	Haversham	He thought of not answering or of asking his mother to take it, but his mother was watching television and he had his responsibilities as a well driller. “You’ve got around thirty-five gallons a minute,” he said. “[MASK] will install the pump.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Katherine	Put on the shoes,” she said, and pretended to put on shoes. “Put on the mink coat,” she said. "It’s too hot for a mink coat, dear,” [MASK] told her. “Why don’t you wear a mink scarf?”
<name>Ethan</name>	Ethan	Baxter	Here one of his neighbors, a married woman with four children, sat down beside him and began a general discussion of the nature of married love. It was a conversation, with its glances and innuendoes, that [MASK] had been through many times, and he knew roughly what it promised.
<name>her husband</name>	her husband	Cash	She usually chose a Saturday, when [MASK] would be at home, for her departure. She would pack a suitcase and get her War Bonds from the desk. Then she would take a bath and put on her best slip.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Richard	We had shared a checkered, troubled, and sometimes sorrowful past, and [MASK] had risen from this chaos into a dazzling and resplendent respectability, but perhaps this image of himself would be improved by the lowboy; perhaps the image would not be complete without it.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Justina	Otherwise, I’d advise you to get in touch with the Mayor or someone on the Village Council.” He cut the connection. I was outraged but this did not change the fact that [MASK] was still sitting on the sofa. I poured a fresh drink and lit another cigarette.
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Jack	"He’s on the radio, Friday afternoons at four-fifteen. Isn’t it exciting?” She seemed to be delighted with the count and the terrible restaurant. Sometime the next winter, [MASK] moved from the Village to an apartment in the East Thirties.
<name>Louise</name>	Louise	Irene	the following morning, [MASK] cooked breakfast for the family— the maid didn’t come up from her room in the basement until ten-braided her daughter's hair, and waited at the door until her children and her husband had been carried away in the elevator.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ralph	That’s all I can tell you, and don’t try to get me on the telephone any more.” [MASK] walked the miles from his office to his apartment that night, hoping to free himself in this way from some of the weight of his disappointment.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Artemis	"I’ll go down another fifteen or twenty feet,” [MASK] said. “I think you’ll have a nice well.” "And then you’ll go away,” she said, “and never come back.” She began to cry.
<name>Herbert</name>	Herbert	Will	She cried and he comforted her, where a younger husband might have expressed some impatience. [MASK] did not encourage her inefficiency, but it was a trait that he associated with the fineness of her eyes and her pallor. While she tied flowers she talked about the fete.
<name>he</name>	he	Francis	He struck her full in the face. She staggered and then, a moment later, seemed composed. She went up the stairs to their room. She didn’t slam the door. When [MASK] followed, a few minutes later, he found her packing a suitcase.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dolly	Then in her dream she turned away from the window and went through the bathroom that connected their room and [MASK]’s. Her daughter was sleeping sweetly, and she woke her. At this point, her emotions were at their strongest.
<name>Casey</name>	Casey	Artemis	To get the facts out of the way: [MASK] drilled with an old Smith & Mathewson chain-concussion rig that struck the planet sixty blows a minute. It made a terrible racket and there had been two complaints.
<name>Hemingway</name>	Hemingway	Boobee	A drunken enemy once said that she was the sort of woman for whom the water glasses and toilet seats of motels and hotels are sealed. [MASK] loved her for a variety of reasons, but he particularly loved the fact that she was an American.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Katherine	“Now, I don't want to alarm either of you,” he said, “but would anyone have any reason to kidnap the child? We have to consider every possibility.” “Yes,” [MASK] said suddenly and in a strong voice.
<name>Sam Spade</name>	Sam Spade	Larry	Well, this is one building where you can’t. The management says all deliveries at the back door, and the management is boss.” "I’m not a deliveryman,” [MASK] said. "I’m a guest.” “What’s the box?”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Aphrodite	He was a slender man—he seemed to have the especial slenderness of youth—and while he was far from young he had slid down his banister that morning and given the bronze backside of [MASK] on the hall table a smack, as he jogged toward the smell of coffee in his dining room.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Victor	“Eight years,” he says. He swings the megaphone into the air and peers through it at a star. “Nine, actually,” he says. “What are you doing, [MASK]?” “I’m between jobs now.”
<name>Guido</name>	Guido	Antonio	His mail was kept in a sack, and if it was too heavy for him to carry, [MASK], the postina's son, would walk back with him to the villa. He worked over his mail until five or six.
<name>Signorina</name>	Signorina	Witch	I stood in the door with my coffee, wishing they would schedule their disputes for seme other time of day. The quarrel was suspended while the signorina came down the stairs to get her bread and wine. Then it started up again: ‘[MASK]!
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Tom	I had wanted to know who [MASK] was, but now that I knew, I didn’t feel any better. The graying man and the beautiful girl and the woman, standing together, made me feel worse. That night, I decided to stay in town and go to a cocktail party.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Bascomb	On the other side of the ledger were all frozen foods, cultivated greens, overcooked pasta, and canned soups. In the spring, a Scandinavian admirer wrote, asking if he might have the honor of taking [MASK] for a day’s trip among the hill towns.
<name>John</name>	John	Paul	His hair and forehead were gray. Ruddiness began on his high cheekbones and shaded down to a dark brown that spread from his jaw to his neck. “How much will you charge me for using your horse to cultivate the garden?” [MASK] asked.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Charlie	Indeed, it was impossible to believe that this charming and handsome man had been so offensive. In the morning light, and surrounded by new friends, he seemed to challenge the memory. He seemed almost able to transfer the blame onto [MASK].
<name>John</name>	John	Bradish	He could leave his office for that long. [MASK] was a heavy smoker, and the Surgeon General’s report had made him self-conscious about his addiction. It seemed to him that strangers on the street regarded the cigarette in his fingers with disapproval and sometimes with commiseration.
<name>Colombo</name>	Colombo	Boobee	I am taking the Colombo on the twenty-seventh.” He sobbed. "You know what she is asking me?” he said. “No, [MASK]. What did she ask you?” “She is asking me to change my name.”
<name>Hera</name>	Hera	Tiberio	The ballad was, or had been until he burned it, an exhaustive and revolting exercise in scatology, and going down the stairs to his terrace he felt genuinely remorseful. He spent the afternoon writing a disgusting confession called The Favorite of [MASK].
<name>Antonio</name>	Antonio	Seton	He stood in the dark water with his spear, ready to take on his shoulders the safety and welfare of the community, but they turned their backs on him and sang as they climbed the cliff. To hell with “La Famiglia Tosta,” [MASK] thought.
<name>Uncle Hammer</name>	Uncle Hammer	Pamela	"You were going to build a pen for the pig,” she said. “You were always such a good carpenter. Remember that bookcase you built? Then [MASK] called you up, and you drove over there in the old Cadillac.”
<name>probably</name> (There is no clear proper name in this sentence, so this is a guess based on the context.)	probably (There is no clear proper name in this sentence, so this is a guess based on the context.)	Assunta	In the morning, it was making some coffee, [MASK] large, and I left at about ten. A hot wind later told that this was the sirocco. It was ater. A boat offshore was sounding its fog-both foggy and suffocating.
<name>isolates</name>	isolates	Europeans	Listening to the noise of the ship’s motors and the faint sounds of tenderness next door, I realized that I had left my way of life a thousand knots astern and that there is no inclination to internationalism in my disposition. They were both, in a sense, [MASK].
<name>He</name>	He	Baxter	What—” Her face and her voice were, for a minute, ingenuous and yielding, and then he saw the force of resistance transform them. “You shouldn’t have done it,” she said. “May I come in?” [MASK] asked.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Richard	We went there for dinner—it must have been Thanksgiving. The lowboy stood in the dining room, on its carpet of mysterious symbols, and the silver pitcher was full of chrysanthemums. [MASK] spoke to his wife and children in a tone of vexation that I had forgotten.
<name>Collodi</name>	Collodi	Collodi	Then he had taken private lessons from an old lady. He was supposed to read and translate [MASK]’s Pinocchio, but when he had done a few sentences the teacher would take the book out of his hands and do the reading and translating herself.
<name>Strickland</name>	Strickland	Artemis	There was a swimming pool and seven baths and the well produced three gallons a minute. [MASK] contracted to go down another hundred feet, but even then the take was only six gallons a minute. The enormous, costly, and useless house impressed him with the importance of his trade.
<name>Antonio</name>	Antonio	Seton	Around the cliff the shore is steep, terraced for vineyards, and packed with wild rosemary, and here the sea has beaten into the shore a chain of sandy coves. [MASK] heads for the largest of these, and his sons dive off the boat as he approaches the beach.
<name>he</name>	he	Irene	“It cost four hundred dollars. I hope you’ll get some enjoyment out of it.” “Oh, I’m sure I will,” [MASK] said. "Four hundred dollars is a good deal more than I can afford,” he went on.
<name>her</name>	her	Tibi	Quickly. Quickly. I hate scenes.” If she hated scenes I wondered then why she always made such painful scenes but this was the way we had parted ever since I could remember and I got my suitcase and went out and waited for [MASK] in the courtyard.
<name>Mr. Pym</name>	Mr. Pym	Maria	“You must get [MASK] to tell you what happened at the florist’s this morning,” he said. Late on Sunday afternoon, the Pyms took a walk with their children, as they usually did when the weather was fair.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Jupiter	"Here, pussy, here, poor pussy!” But the cat gives her a skeptical look and stumbles away in its skirts. The last to come is [MASK]. He prances through the tomato vines, holding in his generous mouth the remains of an evening slipper.
<name>The listener</name>	The listener	Artemis	Russian is a more percussive language than English, less musical but more diverse, and this may account for its carrying power. The voice was powerful, not only in volume but in its emotional force. It seemed melancholy and exalted. [MASK] understood nothing beyond the noise.
<name>Rocky</name>	Rocky	Joan	I don’t have any joy in my life any more. When I’m unhappy, I try to remember a time when I was happy, but I can’t remember a time any more.” “[MASK], get up. Get up on your feet.
<name>Wolfgang</name>	Wolfgang	Lovell	Her first son, [MASK], was born in the third year of her marriage. When he was four or five years old, it was decided that he was a musical genius, and he did have unusual manual dexterity. He was great at unsnarling kite lines and fishing tackle.
<name>Mrs. Filmer</name>	Mrs. Filmer	Wilma	There must have been some felicity, some clearness in his feeling for [MASK], but once the lowboy took a commanding position in his house, he seemed driven back upon his wretched childhood. We went there for dinner—it must have been Thanksgiving.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Robert	[MASK] saw that she was drunk. The policeman paid no attention to her. He looked methodically into the cel- lar of each house, and then they went around a comer. There were stores, here, along the front of an apartment house.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Katherine	This sort of thing happens to everyone who has children. My sister’s little girl fell downstairs. She fractured her skull. They didn’t think she was going to live.” "It does happen to other people, doesn’t it?” [MASK] asked.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Seton	There are thongs for oarlocks, and [MASK] rows by standing in the waist and putting his weight against the oars. He thinks that he is quite adroit at this—even picturesque—but he would never, even at a great distance, be taken for an Italian.
<name>Professor</name>	Professor	Lytle	He wrote four themes for this course, which [MASK] charitably graded A. His ear for prose was damaged bv an incurable fascination for words like “cacophony,” “percussion,” “throbbingly,” and “thumpingly.” This may have had something to do with his profession.
<name>darling</name>	darling	Mark	He's coming tonight.” “No, he isn’t, sweetie. You’re going to call him up and tell him not to come.” “He’s human, [MASK].” “Now, listen to me, sweetie. You listen to me.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Kasiak	He carried them to the edge of the garden and dug a hole. [MASK] came by, carrying water for the chickens, and when he had sized up the situation, he spoke mournfully. “Why you dig a grave?” he asked.
<name>Landlady</name>	Landlady	Chester	“Well, I’m going to tell the porters to take your stuff—your things— out now and put them in the alley,” [MASK] said. “They’ll be just as safe there as they will be in here, and if it rains.
<name>son</name>	son	Anne	Each day, after lunch, they would reach the point where he gave her a lecture on self-reliance. “Your mother and I are going away now,” he would say, “and I want you to ski by yourself, [MASK].”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Victor	“Don’t you even know the way?” “I’m not going the usual way,” [MASK] said patiently, “but a few years ago they built a factory down the road, and the traffic is heavy around closing time. It’s quicker this way.
<name>Myrtle</name>	Myrtle	Minnie	She was with a broken-winded gigolo, who kept looking desperately over his shoulder, as if he expected his trainer to throw in the sponge. [MASK]’s plumage was exceptionally brilliant, her face seemed exceptionally haggard, and a lot of people were laughing at her.
<name>the narrator's aunt</name>	the narrator's aunt	Percy	They must have been poor, and I suppose [MASK] did the housework, bought the groceries, and hung out the wash. Late one night when I had gone to bed, I overheard my father shouting, “I cannot support that cigarsmoking sister of yours any longer.”
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Artemis	"Shit," she said. “That’s the name of it. I’m surprised you never heard of it. It sold about half a million copies.” “You’re kidding,” [MASK] said. “No I’m not,” she said.
<name>He</name>	He	Baxter	[MASK] was aware that he had only himself to blame; he had moved too quickly. He knew better. He went to bed feeling angry and sad, and slept poorly. He was depressed when he woke, and his depression was deepened by the noise of a sea rain, blowing in from the northeast.
<name>Baby</name>	Baby	Rachel	[MASK]’s way was not so easy. When she lost her fat she became very pretty and quite fast. She smoked and drank and probably fornicated and the abyss that opens up before a pretty and an intemperate young woman is unfathomable.
<name>she</name>	she	Ned	“I don’t know what you mean.” “Why, we heard that you’d sold the house and that your poor children . . .” “I don’t recall having sold the house,” [MASK] said, “and the girls are at home.”
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Bascomb	They had fallen in love along the lines of the pure and ardent love he described. Thinking of his day’s work, [MASK] hung his head. On the next day he wrote The Confessions of a Public School Headmaster. He burned the manuscript at noon.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Artemis	He opened the cab door and she climbed in and sat beside him. "Is there whiskey in it?” asked [MASK]. “Just a drop,” she said. “It’s mostly tea and lemon. It will help you get better.”
<name>Wilbur</name>	Wilbur	Clancy	The boy had on his best suit and he looked like a million dollars. They shook hands at the corner, and [MASK] limped back to the Building. Traffic was slow on the elevator, and he stood at the front door, watching the people on the sidewalk.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Tibi	There was champagne and cake and my mother’s friend [MASK] would play the piano and they would all stand around the piano and sing "Silent Night” and “We Three Kings of Orient Are” and "Hark, the Herald Angels Sing” and other carols from home.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Ethel	He dried [MASK]’s tears and spoke to her tenderly, and they went in. It was late by then—it was after midnight—and that dance was always a rhubarb. The floor was crowded, and plumes, crowns, animal heads, and turbans were rocking in the dim light.
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Wilma	Why should he endure jealousy as well as love for a stick of wood? I said that I would deliver it to him on Sunday, but be didn’t trust me. He would drive up with [MASK], his small wife, on Sunday morning, and accompany me back.
<name>Pinocchio</name>	Pinocchio	Boobee	You sound like a fruit peddler.” “I am sorry,” [MASK] said. “Please sit down,” my wife said, and he did, but his nose seemed to get very long. He had been injured. The awkward party lasted not much over an hour.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Grace	Or perhaps the man was new and uninformed. Then he heard [MASK] at his back say: “They went for broke overnight—nothing but income—and he showed up drunk one Sunday and asked us to loan him five thousand dollars. . .
<name>Betty</name>	Betty	Phyllis	He was desperate and tired, and where was the sense in his life? When he returned to the living room, [MASK] was attacking the chair again with the beer-can opener. Her excuse was that she had lost a quarter in the upholstery.
<name>Wilbur</name>	Wilbur	Ralph	[MASK] was to borrow money, but neither his salary nor his patent was considered adequate collateral for a loan at anything but ruinous rates, and one day, at his office, he was served a summons by the department-store collection agency.
<name>Lavinia</name>	Lavinia	Nerissa	Everyone adores her. She is too attractive for words." Enter [MASK] then, into her mother’s drawing room. She is a thin and wasted spinster of thirty. Her hair is gray. Her slip shows. Her shoes are caked with mud.
<name>her husband</name>	her husband	Charlie	She had not told her neighbors that [MASK] had left her; she had not even called her lawyer; but she had fired the cook, and she now took a south-south-west course between the stove and the sink, cooking the children’s supper.
<name>Raphael</name>	Raphael	Titian	Above this was a portrait by [MASK] of the first Malvolio-Pommodori pope. “I make my tea on a spirit lamp, because in the time it takes the man to bring tea from the kitchen the water gets quite cold. . .
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Prescott	She found him in the Great Hall and called him aside. He thought he was going to be asked to mix the cocktails. When she made her request, he said that he would be glad to help. He drove to the roadhouse, where he found [MASK] sitting at a table.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Molly	I took [MASK] in my arms. She was completely responsive. I am not a tall man (I am sometimes inclined to stoop), but the conviction that I am loved and loving affects me like a military bracing. Up goes my head. My back is straight.
<name>Big Brother</name>	Big Brother	Khrushchev	It seemed to be the same route he had taken in the car, but all the portraits of [MASK] had vanished. All those pictures that had beamed down on him from bakeries, lampposts, and walls were gone.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Trace	I know that to be a fact. It’s an awful thing, [MASK], and I know it is, but instead of recommending that kid, I’d feel obligated to warn people against him—people who knew his father and would naturally want to step in and do something.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Lovell	[MASK] broke the ice by asking me if I didn’t think her hair was beautiful. I said that it was very beautiful. Well, it’s a lot of work, she said. I have to wash it twice a week in whites of egg.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Francis	“I think it’s all right, Officer,” the secretary began. “I think it will be-” “Let's make sure,” the policeman said, and he began to slap [MASK]’ clothes, looking for what—pistols, knives, an icepick?
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Lawrence	“And look at these doors,” [MASK] said. “Look at these doors and window frames.” I followed him over to a big Dutch door that opens onto the terrace and looked at it. It was a relatively new door, but someone had worked hard to conceal its newness.
<name>Beatrice</name>	Beatrice	Maria	Exhausted and bilious, he felt he needed a disguise for the dance. When he had bathed and shaved, [MASK] helped him strap himself into his coat of mail. She cut some ostrich plumes off an old hat and stuck them gaily into his helmet.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Charlie	‘They’ve got to learn.” Then he stood up and, with the cunning and dexterity of a drunk, got out of most of his clothing before anyone could stop him. "Get out of here,” [MASK] said.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Irene	There were screams of laughter and a dish of some sort crashed to the floor. “Those must be the Fullers, in n-E," [MASK] said. “I knew they were giving a party this afternoon. I saw her in the liquor store.
<name>Her</name>	Her	Irene	She overheard demonstrations of indigestion, carnal love, abysmal vanity, faith, and despair. [MASK]’s life was nearly as simple and sheltered as it appeared to be, and the forthright and sometimes brutal language that came from the loudspeaker that morning astonished and troubled her.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Julia	“[MASK], darling!” he said, but when she felt his hand on her shoulder she got up. “Leave me alone,” she said. “I have to go.” She brushed past him to the closet and came back with a dress.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Katherine	They could hear the rain as it fell against the building and the windows. “She's lying somewhere in the rain!” [MASK] cried. She wrenched her body around in the chair and covered her face. “She’s lying in the • it rain.
<name>his valet</name>	his valet	Evarts	He had several rings, a gold identification bracelet, and a gold bracelet watch, and he carried a heavy gold cigarette case, set with jewels. The case was empty, and [MASK] furnished him with cigarettes as they talked.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Bibber	he asked enthusiastically, keenly aware of the fatuity in his tone, and convinced of the necessity for it. "I want you to show me your favorite place in the whole camp.” "I don’t have any favorite place,” [MASK] said.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Ralph	“We hope to. We’ll know tomorrow." “Is it true that [MASK]’s uncle saved his life?” “That’s true.” “You’re lucky.” “I suppose we are.” "You’re lucky, all right.”
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Jill	"isn’t it divine, isn’t it the most divine period in domestic American architecture?” [MASK] always asked, showing guests through their large frame house. The house had been built in the 1870s, and had long windows, an oval dining room, and a stable with a cupola.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Chaddy	Her shoulders were bare that night, her dress was cut to show the division of her breasts and to show her breasts when she leaned over the board to play. She kept losing and flirting and making her losses seem like a part of the flirtation. [MASK] was in the other room.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Randy	His cigarette was wet. When he sat down again, the long ash spilled onto his vest. “Do I look thirty-seven?” [MASK] asked. “Do you know that you’ve mentioned the fact that you’re thirty-seven eight times today?”
