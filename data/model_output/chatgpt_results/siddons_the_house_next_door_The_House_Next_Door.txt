<name>him</name>	him	Buck	“I know it sounds like a huge assumption, but when you hear [MASK] describe it, it sounds ... plausible, somehow.” “When did you hear him describe it?” I asked. “He called me when it happened. I went over.”
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Susan	“I apologize,” [MASK] began on the landing. “I don’t know what on earth—” She looked into the empty living room and stopped. She looked at her husband. “Where is everybody?” she said.
<name>Rhett</name>	Rhett	Walter	I made it myself and it’s first-rate, if I do say so. Those old Southern aristocrats really knew how to live, didn’t they?” [MASK] gave him an exaggerated leer and said, “Oh, to be sure.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Norman	I gather he must be something of a big deal in [MASK]’s circle, because she said he’d planned the menu already, down to the nth degree, and hired a bartender and a maid to serve and a cleaning crew to come in and do the whole house on the day of the party.
<name>Dill</name>	Dill	Claire	I stopped the weak, hopeless crying after a while, feeling only the currents of our silence and the ache of grief that [MASK]’s hurt, stiff little speech had left. I don’t think I’m going to be able to fix that, I thought.
<name>friend</name>	friend	Col	Then he stepped back and passed a hand over his eyes, and ruffled my hair. “Tantrum’s over,” he said. “Let’s go get another drink. I either need two less than I’ve already had or four more. Thanks for putting up with me, [MASK].
<name>him</name>	him	hirri	I gasped, my face burning at the sheer treachery of it. A babel of voices rose around him assuring [MASK] that it was nothing, he mustn’t worry about it, things like that happened to everybody, the only important thing was the child.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Walter	Do you really want to move?” “No, I—no. I don’t want to move. I just don’t want anything more to happen to anybody over there. I want everything to be like it was. We could warn people, [MASK].
<name>Janet</name>	Janet	Colquitt	They aren’t here anymore.” “Don’t be silly, [MASK],” he said. “She’s probably found something she liked and they’ve put the house on the market, but they wouldn’t have moved away this soon. That takes weeks.”
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Roger	As it is, I’ll bet he’s called her fourteen times a day for the past two weeks and charged it to us, and [MASK] will kill him. I almost wish they’d go ahead and get mar-ried.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Anita	“[MASK]’s illness was emotional, as you’ve probably guessed,” she said. “There was a long time when they didn’t think they’d ever reach her again. She was in deep catatonia. She was hospitalized for a very long time.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Charles	Just like the other night. Even when [MASK] opened the door and pulled her into the kitchen, she just stood there staring past us, making that knocking motion with her fist, in the air. She was white as death.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Luke	No. [MASK]’s missing his watch and thought it might have slipped off when we were over here this afternoon. But I can’t find it. Sorry if we scared you.” “Just for a minute,” I yelled back, beginning to be cold.
<name>Chip</name>	Chip	Walter	We snickered. “Save the whales,” said [MASK], pleased with himself. “Go eat something,” I said. “Go have some of that top grade sirloin steak tartare. You’re a disgrace.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Kim	I had not thought about [MASK] much since he left, but I missed him suddenly and achingly, missed the gray eyes crinkling out of the brick tangle of beard and eyebrows, the tall, shambling figure, the sudden boy’s grin, the big, deft hands.
<name>it</name>	it	Anita	I’ll admit she doesn’t seem the type for hallucinations or whatever, but suggestion is a very powerful thing, and she must have been shocked out of her wits to see [MASK] like that again, so soon after the other thing, after she’d been doing so well.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Walter	Tears I thought were seared forever out of me prick' led in my nose and started through my lashes. The re-membered dearness bloomed into life, hurting unbearably. Perhaps there was still a way ... [MASK] began to talk. He talked for a long time.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Kim	I’m going to finish up on the Douglas site—I can still supervise a crew even if I can’t design— and then I think I might split for a while.” “Oh, [MASK], no!” I stared at him.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Col	“No. I don’t understand. I want more than anything in the world to understand, but you won’t help me. All I do understand is that you could help me and you won’t. Do it, [MASK]. Please. Please tell me.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Claire	I’d almost hope whatever it is over there jerjcs a knot in his stupid Nazi neck, if she wasn’t there.” “But she is,” I said, beginning to sob with weariness and hopelessness. “She is.” Late that night [MASK] called.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Claire	“At least,” I said, “let me tell people what you believe, if you aren’t willing to tell it yourself, [MASK]. What if it goes on the market again? What then? What if somebody buys it? What about those people?”
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Norm	“[MASK], I’m trying to get this eggnog done,” she said. “Don’t worry about it, we have plenty of candlelight. Go on out and mingle. I’ll bring this in a minute.” “No, I’ll do it.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Walter	It was born in him. He’s a carrier, some kind of terrible carrier, and he doesn’t even know it. It will be in everything he ever builds for as long as he lives, and he’ll never know it.” [MASK] looked at me mildly.
<name>she</name>	she	Claire	I’m not excusing her. I think she acted like a real shit to you. I didn’t think [MASK] had that in her. But it’s what you’re going to get from anybody you mention it to. Now, we damned well are going to that party.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Walter	You couldn’t have picked a better way to do it. He’s been as brutal to her as it’s humanly possible to be, and [MASK] has scared her within an inch of her life, and her child is desperately ill, and you can chalk up a good day’s work.
<name>George</name>	George	Buck	What was going on?” “Nothing much was going on. She was still in the chair, but she was pleasant to me, just a little detached. She said she was sleepy and wanted to go to bed, and [MASK] took her upstairs.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Walter	[MASK] painted the woodwork in the dining room and kitchen, and we repapered the downstairs bathroom. We went to few of the small, informal dinner parties that flourish on our street in the cold months. It was not that we were not invited. Few were given.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Anita	Then he turned to [MASK], and we looked too. In the half-light that bathed the chaise she sat with her feet up and her hands folded loosely in her lap, so still that she might have been carved from marble.
<name>Blanche</name>	Blanche	Colquitt	The house did it, the house made them do it!” “ ‘The devil made me do it!’ [MASK], honey, this just can’t go on. You’re making yourself sick. Badly sick.”
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Anita	[MASK]’s the kind of woman who wants everything just so before anybody sees it. And she hasn’t been very well...” He looked at us anxiously, as if silently imploring us to understand something that he could not or would not put into words.
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Claire	But what was left was not the lightness I had yearned for, only this stale, tired emptiness. [MASK] thrust the three newcomers into the kitchen, a man, a woman, and a little girl of about eight, then hugged me briefly and turned to them.
<name>there is no proper name</name>	there is no proper name	Claire	We’re so insulated and fat and happy over here that we’ve forgotten that there’s real pain and trouble in the world. Oh, yes, [MASK], even among ‘nice’ people. Don’t blame the house. That’s just absurd.”
<name>Realtor</name>	Realtor	Walter	If we’ve stopped it from selling, don’t you think it will have been worth it? Any amount of pain, what is that to more death?” “There’s a certain kind of person who’d love to live in that house,” said [MASK].
<name>Doctor</name>	Doctor	Bucky	His face was still and dead. Just that. Lifeless, like a mask. “[MASK], do you have to? Isn’t there any way I could take care of her at home? Couldn’t she stay in her own house?”
<name>Flora</name>	Flora	Rasputin	I nodded and smiled. There was a small, stretching silence. [MASK], our orange tiger cat, appeared from the depths of the McIntyre lot and came to curl around the girl’s ankle, and she swooped at him in an ecstasy of joy.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Buck	She never did, directly. But [MASK] came in last week, one night late, and found her sitting in that rock-ing chair, the one that was in the boy’s room where he found her before. It’s that bentwood by the fireplace.
<name>Bluto</name>	Bluto	Anita	We had not seen him since the incident with [MASK] and the television set, and I wondered if he had heard about it. I hoped not. I did not plan to tell him. “Your favorite mendicant is back with his empty stein,” he said, brandishing the beer can at me.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Anita	She made some hesitant suggestions for building in desk and bookcase units that had not oc-curred to me but would be perfect for the room. “You really ought to consider getting back into the business, [MASK],” I said.
<name>Her</name>	Her	Buck	“Absolutely not. I’m going to be very offended if you even mention that again,” I said. “I mean that. [MASK].” “Well, then, let me talk to her about it, and if she’d like to do it.
<name>Mr. Harrington</name>	Mr. Harrington	Duck	“I hope those kids will behave themselves,” he said. “I didn’t know [MASK] was coming over. The girl’s father is on the board of trustees for City, isn’t he? I don’t need him down on me.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Casey	Let me get the flashlight, and we’ll scout around.” [MASK] wasn’t in our backyard, and he did not come in from the woods when we called and whistled. He wasn’t around the gray Mercedes either, or in the front yard.
<name>Barbara</name>	Barbara	Charles	She looked stunning and imperial in the gunmetal silk that almost precisely matched her prematurely gray hair. [MASK]’s emeralds, the twenty-fifth-anniversary present she so treasured, caught a last shaft of sunlight and sprang into fire.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Walter	I can’t lose you twice.” When she was quieter I bundled her into one of my coats and a scarf, and [MASK] got the flashlight and walked her back home. I went with them to the edge of the driveway.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Kim	[MASK] sauntered behind them. He looked older and thinner in a well-cut summer suit, the only one I had ever seen him wear. His eyes were still smudged with shadows, though he did not look as hangdog as he had when we had seen him last.
<name>Mr. Flood</name>	Mr. Flood	Walter	My mini-mountain. The headlights of the Mercedes swung across the kitchen and stopped, and went out. I heard the nice, solid thunk of its door closing and went out onto the back porch, cats eeling around my ankles, to meet [MASK].
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Kim	“[MASK],” I said, “once, a long time ago, when we’d just met you, you said something about having had two other projects while you were in school, but that they weren’t finished. What happened to them?”
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Walter	“She looks like a Persian cat,” [MASK] said. “One that somebody’s starved and beaten. She looks like she’d bolt if you clapped your hands. Christ, I wonder if they know about what happened over there.”
<name>Hill House</name>	Hill House	Kim	what [MASK] did. I think that there’s ... something ... in that house that is destroying everybody who lives in it. I think it’s something that can somehow isolate what’s the essence of you, the things you absolutely need most to keep on existing, the yow-ness of you.
<name>He</name>	He	Charlie	“[MASK] wouldn’t expect you to leave,” I said, honestly shocked. “No. He wouldn’t. He’d let every account we had go down the tube before he’d suggest breaking things off. That’s why I think I’d pull out.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Frank	I’m designing faster than I can get it down on paper almost, and it’s good, it’s some of the best stuff I’ve ever done. I’ve got three or four ready to go right now, and [MASK]’s got the clients for them.
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	Walter	“I really do. I’m sorry.” And he was gone. [MASK] and I looked at each other, and then we went upstairs and got into bed and held each other, long and hard and quietly, and we did not speak of the evening.
<name>Uncle Axel</name>	Uncle Axel	Kim	He walked with us, quietly, back through the rhododendron hedge and across our driveway and into the den. We sat down on the sofa, and [MASK] brought the brandy bottle from the pantry and took a long pull of it and passed it to us.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Walter	“Beautiful children,” I thought. “They will have beautiful children, tall and coppery, like good colts.” We sat in the late-afternoon sunlight. Ice tinkled. “How long have you been back?” [MASK] asked.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Walter	So we did go to the party, me in a shockingly expensive new dress with a rictus of high spirits pinned to my mouth, [MASK] in the formal evening wear he purports to loathe but looks elegant and saturnine in on the two or three occasions during the year he puts it on.
<name>she</name>	she	Gwen	Oh, come on, we’re among friends,” she caroled when [MASK] attempted to interrupt her. “Everybody knows they’ve had a tiff.” The eyes turned to me, embarrassed but veiled, with speculation and something else behind them.
<name>me</name>	me	Duck	Well, once she asked me to go to lunch and shopping with her, and I said I was busy, and then she called and asked me to come over and have coffee and just talk. I think she’d heard about [MASK] and wanted to help.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Walter	“I’d do the same thing under the circumstances. I can recommend two or three good free-lancers if you’d like to keep things on a small scale.” [MASK] called shortly after noon. “Is it bad?” he said.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Walter	It could not be spoken of, and it could not be gotten around. It canceled our mutual past, and it lay over any mutual future we might have like one of those black holes in space that had frightened me so unreasonably and awfully when [MASK] read about them to me from Time.
<name>Elliot</name>	Elliot	Roger	Something a little funny there—or am I a dirty, paranoid old lady?” “You’re a dirty, paranoid old lady,” said [MASK]. “What do you think, that he’s got a thing for his baby daughter?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Colquitt	If I don’t have you with me I don’t think I can stand it.” He was quiet for a moment, and then he said, “All right, [MASK], I guess we do have to talk about it. Tell me what you think.”
<name>please</name>	please	Claire	Don’t say anything more about it. We won’t talk about it anymore. I promise we won’t ever mention it again. But, [MASK], please don’t just move out tomorrow. Think about it when you feel better.”
<name>Tax</name>	Tax	Vodka	“I switch in April,” he said. “[MASK] touches not my lips until after I’ve given the IRS its pound of flesh.” I thought he seemed quieter that early spring, pre- occupied, though his skirling banter never flagged.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Anita	[MASK] had read it of course. There couldn’t have been any doubt in her mind about what had been going on. And that’s when she went back into the catatonia. She just didn’t move again.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Anita	But he woke up one morning and he said he absolutely knew that if he had one more drink he would be dead. He would just die. So he went home to [MASK], and he was going to straighten things out between them no matter what it took.
<name>He</name>	He	Walter	She was crying with the deep, tearing, uncontrollable sobs that do not allow even breath, and I held her and rocked her shoulders and murmured to her in distress and grief until the awful keening slid into soft, tired breathing. [MASK] went into the kitchen and brought back the brandy bottle and three glasses.
<name>Ed</name>	Ed	Colquitt	I guess I don’t have any pride in me, [MASK], but if you ever change your mind and want your old fat friend back, just whistle. I’ll come running. I always did. But don’t do it until you can do it with no reservations.
<name>whoever</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage, so the answer is "whoever" as a placeholder for any possible name that could fit in the context.)	whoever (There is no proper name given in the passage, so the answer is "whoever" as a placeholder for any possible name that could fit in the context.)	Susan	“Just shut up. You’re making an utter ass of yourself, and I’m not going to listen to you bully [MASK] anymore.” She stood, breathing heavily, for a moment, looking up into his face. He said nothing.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Clark	“What could it hurt, [MASK]?” I asked. “If it’s really so unbelievable, then what’s the harm in it? And if even a few people did believe it, wed be that much to the good.”
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Buddy	That’s just... lunacy. People have strokes all the time. You know what her father was like; you know that eerie, funny little thing she had going with her daddy; you know he never liked poor [MASK].
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Toby	And then we got cut off, there wasn’t any more, but, oh, don’t you see? I talked to him, it was [MASK], and if I talked to him, then of course he’s all right, and it’s all been a horrible mistake.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Walter	“Isn’t it?” he said. “What was all that about?” [MASK] yelled down the stairs. “Just a starving lawyer looking for a watch to pawn,” I yelled back. “Do you want some of this Rocky Road here?”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Walter	I hope nobody finds it necessary to blurt it out. She does look like a breeze would blow her away, doesn’t she? Well, what do you think? Shall we go over and introduce ourselves?” “I guess so,” [MASK] said without enthusiasm.
<name>Sue</name>	Sue	Anita	“Bad week, sort of. I guess. I don’t really know. It will be good to talk to somebody about it.” “[MASK],” I said, looking at her closely in the white noon light.
<name>he</name>	he	Walter	We have careers that we like—or rather, [MASK] has a career; he’s president of a medium-sized, good advertising agency which he formed seven years ago with his friend and then co-worker at a large, exceedingly dull advertising agency.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Walter	Presently I said, “[MASK].” “Yes.” “We have to talk about this now. I know what I promised you. I know I said I wouldn’t talk about it anymore. But that was before this. We can’t pretend this didn’t happen.
<name>her</name>	her	Kim	“The state U was good enough for her daddy and her, and it’s good enough for whatever-Harralson the third.” “Have you ever met her father?” I asked [MASK]. “Once.
<name>Mayella</name>	Mayella	Anita	As though he sensed my slight drawing away, he turned to face us, and his face was very quiet and somehow pleading and tender at the same time. “[MASK] has been sick,” he said. “She was in the hospital for more than eight months.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Colquitt	She’s embarrassed and angry at herself and so anxious not to be a burden to anybody that it’s pitiful to watch. She’s really trying so hard to pull out of this thing, [MASK]. I never saw anybody fight so hard to be strong and well.
<name>Janine</name>	Janine	Frank	I’d have come by sooner, but I’ve been in the office with [MASK] most of the time. I did try to call you, but your number’s not listed.” His voice was level, and he did not look at us.
<name>Cheryl</name>	Cheryl	Charles	One of the most spectacular too. A great addition to the neighborhood. [MASK], you lucky devil, their upstairs bathroom must look right down into your backyard. I give you about two weeks before you get yourself a pair of binoculars and take up bird-watching.”
<name>she</name>	she	Pie	We went out onto the patio with her. The green leash was still affixed to the patio table, but the puppy was gone. “Oh, my God,” [MASK] yelped in distress. “I’ll never find him in this dark.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Ernie	“He was one of our first property owners, has the big contemporary on the beach on the other side of the inn. He was down last week with his family. They came by the house for drinks; his wife was in school with mine. A real go-getter, [MASK] is.
<name>Mercedes</name>	Mercedes	Lincoln	His shining, clifflike [MASK] left early on those mornings; I would hear it start in the drive-way next door before it was light, while I was still showering or dressing in our bedroom. I did not pull aside the curtains to watch him drive away.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Claire	Let her come to your house if you just have to see her, but don’t spend much time in that house. Better still, just don’t see any more of her than you have to—” I stopped. [MASK] looked at me.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Claire	Then I said, “[MASK], I know it’s an awful shock to you, but nowadays—I mean, kids just don’t have to get married anymore—there are ... other options.” “You mean abortion?”
<name>the deceased person</name>	the deceased person	Greene	If we could afford it, we’d buy it ourselves and tear it down. I’m trying to locate [MASK]’s next-of-kin or whoever owns it now, and I plan to call them and tell them just what I’ve told you.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Charles	After she told us about the movie she went back into that horrible stillness and quiet, just like somebody snapping off a light, and [MASK] and I literally pushed and carried her up to our bedroom and laid her down on the bed.
<name>us</name>	us	Walter	I shook my head. I felt nothing but a gentle, vague confusion mingled with a faraway, sleepy, simple relief and the dreaming sense that things were not, perhaps, broken between [MASK] and me. None of it seemed real or seemed to matter a great deal.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Colquitt	I don’t think there have been many of them, but they seem to upset her—out of all proportion.” “I guess maybe they would, if you were sick and jumpy like she is.” “She ... [MASK], she thinks it’s that woman.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Walter	[MASK] and I followed in silence. The house next door was dark and quiet and seemed to breathe sweetly in sleep. 141 12 The week after that evening at the Guthries’ we went down to the island just off the coast that we have both loved since we came to this city.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Walter	The talk turned to other things, and presently he heaved himself up off his chair and walked out to his car. [MASK] walked with him. I carried our glasses back into the kitchen and started a salad, tearing up lettuce and slicing tomatoes blindly and mechanically.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Walter	You’ve let this—this dry spell you’re having make you sick. You need to get some help from somewhere, you need to go away for a while, go home, go to a doctor—” [MASK] broke in.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Colquitt	If I could, I think I’d know what was wrong with me.... [MASK], it’s just all gone. I’m not going to get it back.” His voice broke and he stopped. Tears welled in my own eyes.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Pie	[MASK]’s chatter must drive him mad. Oh, well, I decided. He hasn’t had time to make many friends yet, and he must miss his family. They’re probably like his own children to him.
<name>Uncle Axel</name>	Uncle Axel	Kim	Only [MASK] had refused a drink. He sat quietly for a little while, his long body slouched into the corner of the sofa, deep in some private reverie of his own, saying nothing. Soon he murmured his thanks and good-nights and went away.
<name>her</name>	her	Melissa	“I’m sorry she isn’t feeling well,” I said lamely to fill the prickling silence. “Moving can be upsetting to children, I know.” “There isn’t anything wrong with [MASK],” he said.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Buddy	It was the blood loss that almost killed her. I stayed until one of the older men from the firm came to be with [MASK], then I came on home. I think I felt as sorry for him as I did for her. He was just in pieces.
<name>he</name>	he	Buddy	He says he didn’t, but we were over at the wallpaper place and he found this one book and said this pattern was something hed like to wake up looking at, and when [MASK] saw it, that was it. I was outvoted.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Walter	I could have at least warned off the boys. Ten to one she’s back to square one now. I never saw such ... walking death.” “I think it might have been different if she’d been able to get used to the kids gradually” said [MASK].
<name>he</name>	he	Claire	“Gone out? With her so zonked out on pills she can’t walk?” “I just didn’t think about that, I guess.” “There’s something funny something not right about all this,” [MASK] said.
