<name>Leopold</name>	Leopold	Ofglen	But sometimes it’s as dangerous not to speak. “Yes, we are very happy,” I murmur. I have to say something. What else can I say? j\. block past All Flesh, [MASK] pauses, as if hesitant about which way to go.
<name>George</name>	George	M.	These habits of former times appear to me now lavish, decadent almost; immoral, like the orgies of barbarian regimes. [MASK] loves G. 1972. This carving, done with a pencil dug many times into the worn varnish of the desk, has the pathos of all vanished civilizations.
<name>She</name>	She	Moira	The story passed among us that night, in the semidarkness, under our breath, from bed to bed. [MASK] was out there somewhere. She was at large, or dead. What would she do? The thought of what she would do expanded till it filled the room.
<name>May</name>	May	Jealousy	[MASK] could get her, it’s happened before. All children are wanted now, but not by everyone. But the walk may be a whim of hers, and they humor whims, when something has gone this far and there’s been no miscarriage.
<name>Helen</name>	Helen	Quakers	They hadn’t risked phoning. “The other house was [MASK] too, and they were pay dirt, because they were a station on the Underground Femaleroad. After the first man left, they said they’d try to get me out of the country.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Cora	I am too important, too scarce, for that. I am a national resource. I pull the plug, dry myself, put on my red terrycloth robe. I leave today’s dress here, where [MASK] will pick it up to be washed.
<name>Sophia</name>	Sophia	Janine	“I want to go outside,” says [MASK]. “I want to go for a walk. I feel fine. I have to go to the can.” We all know that she’s in transition, she doesn’t know what she’s doing.
<name>Mrs. Hopewell</name>	Mrs. Hopewell	Rita	[MASK] sees me and nods, whether in greeting or in simple acknowl- edgment of my presence it’s hard to say, and wipes her floury hands on her apron and rummages in the kitchen drawer for the token book. Frowning, she tears out three tokens and hands them to me.
<name>other women</name>	other women	Janine	They aren't squeamish, they don't have the same feelings we do. And the rest of them leaning forward in their chairs, My dear, all horror and prurience. How could she? Where? When? As they did no doubt with [MASK].
<name>Aunt Lydia</name>	Aunt Lydia	Judd	In this connection a few comments upon the crack female control agency known as the “Aunts” is perhaps in order. [MASK] — according to the Limpkin material — was of the opinion from the outset that the best and most cost-effective way to control women for reproductive and other purposes was through women themselves.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Rita	She takes food, a cake or pie or loaf of bread baked by [MASK], or a jar of jelly, made from the mint leaves that grow in her garden. They get sick a lot, these Wives of the Commanders. It adds interest to their lives.
<name>God</name>	God	Lord	Oh [MASK] save us. The air would be clear after that, and lighter. I look up at the ceiling, the round circle of plaster flowers. Draw a circle, step into it, it will protect you.
<name>She</name>	She	Janine	Crouching like that, she’s like a doll, an old one that’s been pillaged and discarded, in some corner, akimbo. [MASK] is up again and walking. “I want to sit down,” she says. How long have we been here?
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name in the given context)	unknown (There is no proper name in the given context)	Jezebel	How can I keep on living? [MASK]'s .£very night when I go to bed I think, In the morning I will wake up in my own house and things will be back the way they were. It hasn’t happened this morning, either.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Moira	Once they would have excited me. They would have meant the after-math, of love. I saw your mother, [MASK] said. Where? I said. I felt jolted, thrown off. I realized I’d been thinking of her as dead.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Nick	There was always that possibility. [MASK], the private Eye. Dirty work is done by dirty people. You shit, I think. I open my mouth to say it, but he comes over, close to me, whispers. “It’s all right.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Cora	I must have pulled it off the hanger, and gone to sleep there; for a moment I couldn’t remember where I was. [MASK] was kneeling beside me, I felt her hand touch my back. She screamed again when I moved. What’s wrong?
<name>Starbucks</name>	Starbucks	Ofglen	[MASK], not missing a beat, pours, and the paper cups pass down the line. I receive a cup, lean to the side to pass it, and the woman next to me says, low in my ear, “Are you looking for anyone?”
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Rita	Some have been sent away, for one reason or another. Or maybe not sent; gone? The lively one. I was guessing. The one with freckles. You know her? [MASK] asked, more suspicious than ever. I knew her before, I lied.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Moira	“Put it this way,” she says, “they’re not too fond of men.” She shrugs again. It might be resignation. Here is what I’d like to tell. I’d like to tell a story about how [MASK] escaped, for good this time.
<name>he</name>	he	Moira	Just don’t, is what he said. Your mother’s neat, [MASK] would say, when we were at college. Later: she’s got pizzazz. Later still: she’s cute. She’s not cute, I would say. She’s my mother.
<name>Zelda</name>	Zelda	Moira	Maybe it was more like throwing peanuts at elephants, I said. [MASK] laughed; she could always do that. Exotic monsters, she said. We stand looking at this building, which is in shape more or less like a church, a cathedral.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Janine	[MASK] looked down at the floor. Whatever it was, she knew she would not be blamed for it, she was blameless. But what use had that been to her in the past, to be blameless? So at the same time she felt guilty, and as if she was about to be punished.
<name>introduces</name> themselves.	introduces themselves.	Moira	“My break’s up anyway,” says one woman, who’s wearing a baby-blue laced-up Merry Widow and white stockings. She stands up, shakes my hand. “Welcome,” she says. The other woman obligingly moves over, and [MASK]
<name>She</name>	She	Moira	We expected her to be dragged in at any minute, as she had been before. We could not imagine what they might do to her this time. It would be very bad, whatever it was. But nothing happened. [MASK] didn’t reappear.
<name>Truman</name>	Truman	Charming	I feel stupid; I want to see myself in a mirror. “[MASK],” he says. “Now for the face.” All he has is a lipstick, old and runny and smelling of artificial grapes, and some eyeliner and mascara.
<name>Tris</name>	Tris	Ofglen	There’s a shock in this seeing; it’s like seeing somebody naked, for the first time. There is risk, suddenly, in the air between us, where there was none before. Even this meeting of eyes holds danger. Though there’s nobody near. At last [MASK] speaks.
<name>God</name>	God	Jacob	The body is marked only with a J, in red. It doesn’t mean Jewish, those would be yellow stars. Anyway there haven’t been many of them. Because they were declared Sons of [MASK] and therefore special, they were given a choice.
<name>Liberty</name>	Liberty	Jacob	It was he who suggested the use of an obscure “CIA” pamphlet on the destabilization of foreign governments as a strategic handbook for the Sons of [MASK], and he, too, who drew up the early hit lists of prominent “Americans” of the time.
<name>her</name>	her	Luke	I’ve helped others.” “Help me?” I say, my voice as low as his. “How?” Does he know something, has he seen [MASK], has he found, can he bring back? “How do you think?”
<name>Aretha</name>	Aretha	Pam	Her real name was [MASK]. I read that in a profile on her, in a news magazine, long after I’d first watched her singing while my mother slept in on Sunday mornings. By that time she was worthy of a profile: Time or Newsweek it was, it must have been.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Nick	Then the car starts and then it stops again, and the Commander is helping me up. “We’ll have to be fast,” he says. “This is a back entrance. You should leave the cloak with [MASK].
<name>Aunt Lydia</name>	Aunt Lydia	Soothing	[MASK] to the eye, the eyes, the Eyes, for that’s who this show is for. We’re off to the Prayvaganza, to demonstrate how obedient and pious we are. Not a dandelion in sight here, the lawns are picked clean.
<name>Mrs. Samsa</name>	Mrs. Samsa	Cora	Truly amazing, what people can get used to, as long as there are a few compensations. It won’t be long now, says [MASK], doling out my monthly stack of sanitary napkins. Not long now, smiling at me shyly but also knowingly.
<name>God's</name>	God's	Moira	I stood up, flushed the toilet. Two of [MASK]’s fingers appeared, through the hole in the wall. It was only large enough for two fingers. I touched my own fingers to them, quickly, held on. Let go.
<name>Mrs. Danvers</name>	Mrs. Danvers	Rita	“She’s out on the lawn.” [MASK] rolls her eyes to the ceiling, as if consulting silently some deity there. Then she sighs, rises heavily, and wipes her hands with ostentation on her apron, to show me how much trouble I am.
<name>Melinda</name>	Melinda	Moira	We, sitting in our rows, eyes down, we make her salivate morally. We are hers to define, we must suffer her adjectives. I think about pearls. Pearls are congealed oyster spit. This is what I will tell [MASK], later; if I can.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Moira	Now, said [MASK]. You don’t need to paint your face, it’s only me. What’s your paper on? I just did one on date rape. Date rape, I said. You’re so trendy. It sounds like some kind of dessert.
<name>she</name>	she	Ofglen	There will be too many people. “Don’t say a word,” [MASK] warns me, though she doesn’t need to. “In any way.” “Of course I won’t,” I say. Who could I tell?
<name>Maya</name>	Maya	Janine	“Breathe, breathe,” we chant, as we have been taught. “Hold, hold. Expel, expel, expel.” We chant to the count of five. Five in, hold for five, out for five. [MASK], her eyes closed, tries to slow her breathing.
<name>She</name>	She	Moira	But maybe not. Maybe it was the place itself. After the first shock, after you’d come to terms, it was better to be lethargic. You could tell yourself you were saving up your strength. I must have been there three weeks when [MASK] came.
<name>Janine</name>	Janine	Jealousy	[MASK], I put that down to. Some of the others were okay though. But when I was six months’ pregnant, a lot of them started sending me these articles about how the birth-defect rate went zooming up after thirty-five.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Moira	Let’s go for a beer. You’re getting ashes in my bed, I said. If you’d make it you wouldn’t have this problem, said [MASK]. In half an hour, I said. I had a paper due the next day.
<name>pride</name>	pride	Ofglen	To him I’m not just a boat with no cargo, a chalice with no wine in it, an oven — to be crude — minus the bun. To him I am not merely empty. I walk with [MASK] along the summer street.
<name>Mrs. Danvers</name>	Mrs. Danvers	Cora	it’s [MASK] who lights the fires, in the sitting room and the dining room, in cooler weather. The matches are wooden ones, in a cardboard sliding-top box, the kind I used to covet in order to make dolls’ drawers out of them.
<name>him</name>	him	Nick	The fact is that I no longer want to leave, escape, cross the border to freedom. I want to be here, with [MASK], where I can get at him. Telling this, I’m ashamed of myself. But there’s more to it than that.
<name>Benny</name>	Benny	Luke	Our happiness is part memory. What I remember is [MASK], with me in the hospital, standing beside my head, holding my hand, in the green gown and white mask they gave him. Oh, he said, oh Jesus, breath coming out in wonder.
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Cora	. “Looks big enough to me,” says [MASK]. Is she standing up for me? I look at her, to see if I should smile; but no, it’s only the food she’s thinking of.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Liebchen	He was not a monster, to her. Probably he had some endearing trait: he whistled, offkey, in the shower, he had a yen for truffles, he called his dog [MASK] and made it sit up for little pieces of raw steak.
<name>he</name>	he	Luke	Will I ever be in a hotel room again? How I wasted them, those rooms, that freedom from being seen. Rented license. In the afternoons, when [MASK] was still in flight from his wife, when I was still imaginary for him.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Luke	Of having something on me, as they used to say. It’s the kind of power you can use only once. I would like to think better of him. That night, after I’d lost my job, [MASK] wanted me to make love.
<name>Lily</name>	Lily	Ofglen	Today there are different flowers, drier, more defined, the flowers of high summer: daisies, black-eyed Susans, starting us on the long downward slope to fall. I see them in the gardens, as I walk with [MASK], to and fro.
<name>The Commander</name>	The Commander	Ofwarren	Probably he’s figuring out when his promotion is likely to be announced, if all goes well. He’s sure to get one, now. [MASK] is in the master bedroom, a good name for it; where this Commander and his Wife nightly bed down.
<name>Rosebud</name>	Rosebud	Mayday	[MASK]? No, I said. It’s a strange word to use for that, isn’t it? Newspapers and coffee, on Sunday mornings, before she was born. There were still newspapers, then. We used to read them in bed.
<name>Luke</name>	Luke	Luke	I’ve never worn anything remotely like this, so glittering and theatrical, and that’s what it must be, an old theater costume, or something from a vanished nightclub act; the closest I ever came were bathing suits, and a camisole set, peach lace, that [MASK] bought for me once.
<name>strangers</name>	strangers	Luke	They lose touch with their feet. They aren’t a patch on a woman except they’re better at fixing cars and playing football, just what we need for the improvement of the human race, right? That was the way she talked, even in front of [MASK].
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Moira	Yes, I say. Relief goes through me. God, do I need a cigarette, says [MASK]. Me too, I say. I feel ridiculously happy. I sink down into my body as into a swamp, fenland, where only I know the footing.
<name>you</name>	you	Luke	All they want is a look at the license, [MASK] does it well. The license matches the passport: we thought of that. Back on the road, he squeezes my hand, glances over at me. You’re white as a sheet, he says.
<name>June</name>	June	Serena	I would come upon them, here and there in the house, the houses; tracks of her presence, remnants of some lost intention, like signs on a road that turns out to lead nowhere. Throwbacks to domesticity. “Well then,” [MASK] says.
<name>she</name>	she	Ofwarren	The siren goes on and on. That used to be the sound of death, for ambulances or fires. Possibly it will be the sound of death today also. We will soon know. What will [MASK] give birth to? A baby, as we all hope?
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Nick	One in front, one behind, they escort me down the stairs. The pace is leisurely, the lights are on. Despite the fear, how ordinary it is. From here I can see the clock. It’s no time in particular. [MASK] is no longer with us.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Luke	One day, when she was eleven months old, just before she began to walk, a woman stole her out of a supermarket cart. It was a Saturday, which was when [MASK] and I did the week’s shopping, because both of us had jobs.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Moira	I waited a while and phoned [MASK]. She wasn’t there either, but when I tried half an hour later she was. In between these phone calls I just sat on the sofa. What I thought about was my daughter’s school lunches.
<name>Ally</name>	Ally	Moira	Then a toilet flushes and [MASK] comes out of a pink cubicle. She teeters towards me; I wait for a sign. “It’s all right,” she says, to me and to the other women. “I know her.”
<name>she</name>	she	Rita	I asked, trying to sound as neutral as possible. But [MASK] clamped her lips together. I am like a child here, there are some things I must not be told. What you don’t know won’t hurt you, was all she would say.
<name>Constance</name>	Constance	Serena	And sometimes from the front sitting room there will be the thin sound of [MASK]’s voice, from a disc made long ago and played now with the volume low, so she won’t be caught listening as she sits in there knitting, remembering her own former and now amputated glory: Hallelujah.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Nick	My back’s to the window. I expect a stranger, but it’s [MASK] who pushes open the door, flicks on the light. I can’t place that, unless he’s one of them. There was always that possibility.
<name>music</name>	music	Nick	It’s not the first such arrangement in history, though the shape it’s taken is not the usual one. I visit the Commander two or three nights a week, always after dinner, but only when I get the signal. The signal is [MASK].
<name>Angels</name>	Angels	Eyes	What male of the Gilead period could resist the possibility of fatherhood, so redolent of status, so highly prized? Instead, he called in a rescue team of [MASK], who may or may not have been authentic but in any case were under his orders.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Rita	I look at the oranges, longing for one. But I haven’t brought any coupons for oranges. I’ll go back and tell [MASK] about them, I think. She’ll be pleased. It will be something, a small achievement, to have made oranges happen.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Luke	We’d all got up in the usual way and had breakfast, granola, I remember, and [MASK] had driven her off to school, in the little outfit I’d bought her just a couple of weeks before, striped overalls and a blue T-shirt.
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Moira	Surely his motivations are more delicate than that. But it may only be vanity that prompts me to think so. “We don’t have much time left,” I say. “Tell me everything.” [MASK] shrugs. “What’s the point?”
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Ofglen	“Head for the back,” [MASK] murmurs at my side. “We can talk better.” And when we are kneeling, heads bowed slightly, I can hear from all around us a susurration, like the rustling of insects in tall dry grass: a cloud of whispers.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Janine	But people will do anything rather than admit that their lives have no meaning. No use, that is. No plot. One morning while we were getting dressed, I noticed that [MASK] was still in her white cotton nightgown. She was just sitting there on the edge of her bed.
<name>Moaning Myrtle</name>	Moaning Myrtle	Moira	We don’t do this too often, and always at different times of day. In the washroom I go to the second-last stall, as usual. Are you there? I whisper. Large as life and twice as ugly, [MASK] whispers back.
<name>her</name>	her	Ofglen	I feel buried. IjAte afternoon, the sky hazy, the sunlight diffuse but heavy and everywhere, like bronze dust. I glide with [MASK] along the sidewalk; the pair of us, and in front of us another pair, and across the street another.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Jezebel	Still, what does he think, why doesn’t he say something? Maybe he thinks I’ve been slutting around, at [MASK]’s, with the Commander or more. It annoys me that I’m even worrying about what he thinks. Let’s be practical.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Moira	She had both hands on the lid when she felt something hard and sharp and possibly metallic jab into her ribs from behind. Don’t move, said [MASK], or I’ll stick it all the way in, I know where, I’ll puncture your lung.
<name>God</name>	God	Nature	Just a fluke. All we’ve done is return things to [MASK]’s norm. Women’s Prayvaganzas are for group weddings like this, usually. The men’s are for military victories. These are the things we are supposed to rejoice in the most, respectively.
<name>Jezebel</name>	Jezebel	Jezebel	This too we shall never know. Did our narrator reach the outside world safely and build a new life for herself? Or was she discovered in her attic hiding place, arrested, sent to the Colonies or to [MASK]’s, or even executed?
<name>Mrs. Dalloway</name>	Mrs. Dalloway	Serena	Without a word. Both of us shaking, how I’d like to. In [MASK]’s parlor, with the dried flowers, on the Chinese carpet, his thin body. A man entirely unknown. It would be like shouting, it would be like shooting someone.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Rita	We are all obliged to sit through this, one way or another. [MASK] scowls at me before slipping in to stand behind me. It’s my fault, this waste of her time. Not mine, but my body’s, if there is a difference.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Moira	and I’m not here, [MASK] said to me, you just have to slap her like that. You can’t let her go slipping over the edge. That stuff is catching. She must have already been planning, then, how she was going to get out.
<name>John</name>	John	Luke	[MASK] was in the living room. He put his arms around me. We were both feeling miserable. How were we to know we were happy, even then? Because we at least had that: arms, around. The cat, is what he said.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Rita	She prods the chicken, flexes a wing, pokes a finger into the cavity, fishes out the giblets. The chicken lies there, headless and without feet, goose pimpled as though shivering. “Bath day,” [MASK] says, without looking at me.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Luke	Maybe they’re clothes belonging to [MASK]’s wife, whom I’ve also never seen; only pictures and a voice on the phone, late at night, when she was calling us, crying, accusing, before the divorce. But no, they’re my clothes all right.
<name>Raymond</name>	Raymond	Moira	What’d you do wrong? Laugh at his dick?” I look up at the ceiling. “Is it bugged?” I say. I wipe around my eyes, gingerly, with my fingertips. Black comes off. “Probably,” says [MASK].
<name>Norma</name>	Norma	Janine	They were rounded, wide, and her teeth were bared in a fixed smile. Through the smile, through her teeth, she was whispering to herself. I had to lean down close to her. Hello, she said, but not to me. My name’s [MASK].
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Moira	I feel as if there’s not much left of me; they will slip through my arms, as if I’m made of smoke, as if I’m a mirage, fading before their eyes. Don't think that way, [MASK] would say. Think that way
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Nick	“I’ll see you later,” she says. She glides away along the sidewalk and I go up the walk towards the house. There’s [MASK], hat askew; today he doesn’t even look at me.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Moira	Not, as they used to say, at this juncture. The scratched writing on my cupboard wall floats before me, left by an unknown woman, with the face of [MASK]. I saw her go out, to the ambulance, on a stretcher, carried by two Angels.
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Moira	but it was the only thing we could find to steal. To give. I am still praying but what I am seeing is [MASK]’s feet, the way they looked after they’d brought her back. Her feet did not look like feet at all.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Moira	People stayed home at night, watching television, looking for some direction. There wasn’t even an enemy you could put your finger on. Look out, said [MASK] to me, over the phone. Here it comes. Here what comes? I said.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Elizabeth	“I left that old hag Aunt [MASK] tied up like a Christmas turkey behind the furnace. I wanted to kill her, I really felt like it, but now I’m just as glad I didn’t or things would be a lot worse for me.
<name>care</name>	care	Luke	I ought to have done that with [MASK], paid more attention, to the details, the moles and scars, the singular creases; I didn’t and he’s fading. Day by day, night by night he recedes, and I become more faithless.
<name>Mrs. Dalloway</name>	Mrs. Dalloway	Moira	A what? I say. There’s no point trying to work, [MASK] won’t allow it, she’s like a cat that crawls onto the page when you’re trying to read. You know, like Tupperware, only with underwear. Tarts’ stuff.
<name>Offred</name>	Offred	Nick	Past the second checkpoint, [MASK] says, “Here, sir?” and the Commander says yes. The car pulls over and the Commander says, “Now I’ll have to ask you to get down onto the floor of the car.” “Down?”
<name>her</name>	her	Ofglen	I hold back until we’re past the final checkpoint and there are only blocks to go, but then I can no longer control myself. “I didn’t know [MASK] very well,” I say. “I mean the former one.” “Oh?”
<name>she</name>	she	Ofglen	I think maybe I should wait before attempting anything further. It’s too soon to push, to probe. I should give it a week, two weeks, maybe longer, watch her carefully, listen for tones in her voice, unguarded words, the way [MASK] listened to me.
<name>Susanna</name>	Susanna	Alma	By that time they were more confident about us; sometimes they left us unsupervised in the classroom and even the cafeteria for minutes at a time. Probably she’d ducked out for a smoke or a cup of coffee. Look, I said to [MASK], who had the bed next to mine.
