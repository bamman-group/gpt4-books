<name>Van_Helsing</name>	Van_Helsing	Claudia	There was noise rising in the street, shouts, the sound of a bell. The room itself had fast become an inferno, and I did see in one clear blast of light [MASK] battling the fledgling vampire. He seemed unable to close his hands on her, like a clumsy human after a bird.
<name>Lilith</name>	Lilith	Celeste	“ ‘I should have known,’ I said, my eyes still fixed on that painting. “ ‘Then, you must stay away. [MASK] has a great deal of power, being one of the oldest, and she is jealous of the child’s beauty.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Claudia	I think I shuddered. And then I felt [MASK]’s hand very gently touch the hand I lifted to my eyes. The thin pines were billowing behind her and the rustle of the leaves grew louder, as if a great mouth sucked the breeze and began a whirlwind.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Armand	“I was not crazed yet, not desperate. I might have said to him, ‘Pass by.’ I believe my lips did form the word [MASK] had given me, ‘Beware.’ Yet I let him slip his
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Claudia	And [MASK] gazed on this with inscrutable liquid eyes. “If there was not understanding in the early years, there was no smattering of fear. Mute and beautiful, she played with dolls, dressing, undressing them by the hour. Mute and beautiful, she killed.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Lestat	I couldn’t imagine this. Never had [MASK] and I really talked. I think I have described to you with accuracy our sparring matches, our angry go-rounds.” “He was desperate for the money, for your houses,” said the boy.
<name>Matilda</name>	Matilda	Morgan	“It turned out the regular coaches did not come this way, and [MASK] had paid a farmer to bring them by cart. But the afternoon they arrived, there was a great commotion in the cemetery outside of town.
<name>Lolita</name>	Lolita	Claudia	He was pensive, suspicious, drew close to me constantly to ask where [MASK] was, where she’d gone, and what she was doing. “ ‘She’ll be all right,’ I assured him, though I was estranged from her and in agony, as if she’d been my bride.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Denis	“ ‘And the boy, [MASK]? What do you plan to do with him?’ “ ‘He’s dead,’ he answered. “I was astonished. Both at his words and his calm. ‘You killed him?’ I gasped.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Claudia	He let out a sigh which had again that longing, that sweet, painful anticipation. ‘Oh . . . [MASK] . ..’ he sighed. ‘You’ve outdone yourself. Where did you find them?’ “She said nothing.
<name>Wanda</name>	Wanda	Claudia	Or pecking out the music of Mozart we’d only heard the night before with an infallible ear and a concentration that made her ghostly as she sat there hour after hour discovering the music— the melody, then the bass, and finally bringing it together. [MASK] was mystery.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Louis	Her wrist burned against me, yet I did not move. ‘Listen to me, [MASK],’ she said, her voice at once desperate and angry. ‘I left him for you, but he’s dying . .. there’s no time.’
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Lestat	So I had to get up quickly so the father wouldn’t hear his voice from a distance. The slaves had run from him. ‘But they’re out there, they’re gathered in the dark. I hear them,’ said [MASK].
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Lestat	‘Good night, sweet prince,’ said [MASK] ‘and here’s your fifty dollars.’ And he shoved the money into his pocket as if it were a capital joke. “Now we slipped in the courtyard doors of the hotel and went up to the lavish parlor of our suite.
<name>Wesley</name>	Wesley	Armand	“ ‘You’ve been with [MASK],’ she said. ‘You want to go with him.’ “I looked up at her. How soft and beautiful her face was, and, suddenly, so much mine.
<name>Leopold</name>	Leopold	Lestat	The young boy wrote good music, and often [MASK] brought fresh sheets of it home and played the songs on the square grand in our parlor. The boy had a great talent, but you could tell that this music would not sell, because it was too disturbing.
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Lestat	“ ‘And neither will I!’ said that young vampire from the darkness outside. And he stood for a second in the open window looking at us. [MASK] looked up at him and then sheepishly away, and his lower lip seemed to thicken and tremble.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Babette	[MASK] knew something dreadful had happened and suspected murder, never the supernatural. She was in the study making a note of the fire in the plantation diary when I found her. It was almost morning. I had only a few minutes to convince her she must help.
<name>Sebastian</name>	Sebastian	Denis	I’ve killed over and over and will do it again. I took that boy, [MASK], when you gave him to me, though I was incapable of knowing whether he would survive or not.’ “ ‘Why does that make you as evil as any vampire?
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Monsters	[MASK]! To give me immortality in this hopeless guise, this helpless form!’ The tears stood in her eyes. The words had died away, drawn in, as it were, on her breast. “ ‘Now, you give her to me!’
<name>Lestat</name>	Lestat	Santiago	But all I could hear was her sobbing. Then I saw her in the whirl, a fixed, frightened thing, surrounded by other vampires. They were laughing that hollow vampire laughter which is like tinsel or silverbells. [MASK] was clutching at his face.
<name>Lucien</name>	Lucien	Armand	And in minutes, heavy with his meal, he was dozing, and [MASK] sat opposite me, his large, beautiful eyes tranquil and seemingly innocent. When I felt them pull me towards him, I dropped my eyes, wished for a fire in the grate, but there were only ashes.
<name>Alais</name>	Alais	Claudia	“I held fast to [MASK], ready in an instant to shove her behind me, to step forward to meet him. But then I saw with astonishment that his eyes did not see me as I saw him, and he was trudging under the weight of the body he carried towards the monastery door.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Louis	‘[MASK]!’ she said; but I only shook my head. For a moment, the whole house seemed to sway. But she said, ‘Look what’s happening to him!’ “He had ceased to move. He lay now on his back.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Claudia	And then she shut her eyes and trembled all over with some terrible vexation, some awful torment. But [MASK] was leading her from the chair, and she was now pliant and shocked and whitefaced, the green taffeta ballooning around the small yellow silk dress.
<name>Ann</name>	Ann	Claudia	But I can truthfully say that I was beyond being afraid. I knew only that I had to get [MASK] back or die in the effort. It was really very simple; not a matter of courage at all.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Lestat	“Then I saw something through the open doorway which was something I’d seen before, a long, long time ago. No one knew of this thing I’d seen years before except myself. No. [MASK] knew. But it didn’t matter.
<name>he</name>	he	Lestat	“But,” he said, “it wasn’t greed, really, as you can see. It was fear of him that made me tight with him.” “You speak of him as if he were dead. You say [MASK] was this or was that.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Madeleine	And I said, ‘No, fire merely destroys. .. .’ “[MASK] had gone past us and was roaming at the top of the street, a phantom in the rain, her white hands whipping the air, beckoning to us, white arcs of white fireflies.
<name>Success</name>	Success	Peace	[MASK] will only come to you when you can do this every night of your life. There is nothing else. But this is everything!’ His voice was almost tender as he spoke, and he rose and put both his hands on my shoulders.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Louis	‘[MASK], come down . . .’ until she threatened to vanish into the darkness. And in a second I’d unfastened the lamp from its hook, and I stood beside her in the tall grass. “ ‘Don’t you sense the danger?’
<name>Loneliness</name>	Loneliness	Lestat	And I treasured in her the signs of this. But I was not aware for quite a few days how much I wanted her, wanted to talk with her and be with her. At first, I thought only of protecting her from [MASK].
<name>Death</name>	Death	Age	He’s immortal. No illness can touch him. [MASK] has no power over him. You threaten a life which might endure to the end of the world!’ “ ‘Ah, yes, that’s it, precisely!’ she said with reverential awe.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Louis	His lips were trembling, and his face so distorted now by his sudden desperation that I might have recoiled from it despite myself. ‘The same blood flows in our veins, you and 1.1 mean, French, English, we’re civilized men, [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lestat	It was a normal enough fear. And now I realized as I protested to [MASK], I did not actually feel this anymore. I was simply remembering it. Hanging on to it from habit, from a deficiency of ability to recognize my present and exhilarating freedom.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Claudia	I saw his hands now on the wrought-iron balcony. [MASK] let out a piercing scream as he threw his weight against the glass doors. “I cannot tell you all that happened then. I cannot possibly recount it as it was.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Lestat	[MASK] was staring at the ceiling. I could see his tongue between his teeth. He lay too still, the tongue, as it were, trying to get out of the mouth, trying to move past the barrier of the teeth and touch the lip.
<name>Estella</name>	Estella	Lestat	[MASK] played with her as if she were a magnificent doll, and I played with her as if she were a magnificent doll; and it was her pleading that forced me to give up my rusty black for dandy jackets and silk ties and soft gray coats and gloves and black capes.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Lestat	“[MASK] had risen, straightened, but only to bend over and slink into the chair. ‘You won’t stay with me,’ he sighed. But then he looked away and seemed suddenly absorbed. “ ‘I wanted to talk to you so much,’ he said.
<name>Merlin</name>	Merlin	Lestat	Only a hunger for new experience, for that which was beautiful and as devastating as my kill. And I saw that if I were to maximize every experience available to me, I must exert my own powers over my learning. [MASK] was of no use.
<name>Lucifer</name>	Lucifer	Lestat	‘You get the carriage!’ he said to her. ‘Get it now, and the horses. You are in mortal danger; don’t talk of devils!’ “I stomped on the flames and went for [MASK], shouting at him to leave her.
<name>Adela</name>	Adela	Babette	[MASK] was putting her hand to her throat. My injured eyes strained to gather the light to see her. Her throat bled. ‘Remember!’ I said to her. ‘I might have killed you! Or let him kill you! I did not.
<name>Irene</name>	Irene	Armand	Above, I could see story after story rising to a lone tower that barely emerged from the dark, teeming rain. ‘Listen to me; we are going to climb to the tower,’ [MASK] was saying. “ ‘I cannot. . .
<name>James</name>	James	Lestat	I knew [MASK] would fill one glass and sit there staring at the pale yellow color. And I, a man in a trance, lay on the settee staring at him as if nothing he could do mattered. I have to leave him or die, I thought.
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Lestat	I ran back up the steps to the parlor, where [MASK] was already at work on the plantation papers, going over the expenses and profits for the last year. ‘You’re a rich man,’ he said to me when I came in.
<name>Ylla</name>	Ylla	Claudia	And then her body began to rock very slowly. ‘[MASK],’ I called to her. She awakened. She was gaunt such as I had seldom seen her. She pointed to the human who lay far across the floor of the tower near the wall.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Louis	I’d watch you playing shadow in the night, staring at the falling rain, and I’d think, He’s easy to manage, he’s simple. But you’re weak, [MASK]. You’re a mark. For vampires and now for humans alike.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Claudia	Otherwise you would not give [MASK] up. You must know you wanted it. . . .’ “ ‘I loathe what I did!’ I said. “ ‘Then loathe me, not yourself.’ “ ‘No. You don’t understand.
<name>Lestat</name>	Lestat	Claudia	he said. ‘Yes, there is a crime. A crime for which we would hunt another vampire down until we destroyed him. Can you guess what that is?’ He glanced from [MASK] to me and back again to her mask-like face.
<name>Yegor</name>	Yegor	Louis	[MASK]!’ he said. ‘Let him in.’ And he gestured frantically, like an invalid, for the young ‘nurse’ to obey. “As soon as the window opened I breathed the stench of the room and its sweltering heat.
<name>Thaddeus</name>	Thaddeus	Lestat	And I stood there staring down not at the remains of [MASK], but at the body of my mortal brother. A quiet descended, as if a veil had fallen over all and made their forms dissolve beneath its soundless folds.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Santiago	I could see it blazing in the corner of my eye. I was on [MASK] now, turning with him, aware of the awful strength of the arms that held me, the hands that sought to get a hold on my throat.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Claudia	Of course, I’d been thinking of him all the while, and how if we were men and [MASK] had been my love I might have fallen helpless in his arms finally, the need to share some common grief so strong, so consuming.
<name>Wolfe</name>	Wolfe	Armand	She had that same dull expression on her face which she’d had all during my talk with [MASK]. It was as if she were deep in her own considerations and saw nothing around her; and I remember noting this, though not knowing what to think of it, that it persisted even now.
<name>Snape</name>	Snape	Lestat	“ ‘It’s she!’ [MASK] hissed from the shadows when I shut the gate. ‘She’s done something to them and brought risk for us all. I’ll make her tell me!’ And he pounded up the spiral stairs from the courtyard.
<name>He</name>	He	Claudia	’ he whispered, his head back, his lids half-mast. I could see the color rushing to his cheeks, rushing into his hands. One hand lay on his bent knee, fluttering, and then it lay still. “[MASK] had not moved.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Madeleine	“ ‘Will you care for her, [MASK]?’ I saw her hands clutch at the doll, turning its face against her breast. And my own hand went out for it, though I did not know why, even as she was answering me.
<name>He</name>	He	Claudia	One long window showed the pale sky beyond it. I sat there, clutching the bench, trying to steady a motion that continued in my head as the carriage settled on its springs. One of the horses whinnied. Then everything was still. “[MASK] was saying.
<name>Africans</name>	Africans	Africans	But in seventeen ninety-five these slaves did not have the character which you’ve seen in films and novels of the South. They were not soft-spoken, brown-skinned people in drab rags who spoke an English dialect. They were [MASK].
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Armand	It seemed I stumbled then, the Louis whom [MASK] held in his arm, and again I saw his brown eyes looking at me, and felt that drowsiness, that sinking. And yet I walked, I moved, I saw the gleam of my own boots on the pavement.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Claudia	And I remember [MASK] leaving me for her. The sight of wilted, writhing yellow hair as she told me to follow. A ribbon fallen underfoot, flapping and floating in a swirl of black water. It seemed they were gone. And I bent to retrieve that ribbon.
<name>Travers</name>	Travers	Lestat	The old man let out a terrible noise, and I suspect I made some sound of my own. I positively loathed [MASK]. I had a mind now to get him out of the room. ‘Well, you know that, don’t you?
<name>Elspeth</name>	Elspeth	Lestat	She seemed very little concerned with me, though. Her eyes fixed on [MASK]. ‘You speak of us as if we always existed as we are now,’ she said, her voice soft, measured, the child’s tone rounded with the woman’s seriousness.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Lestat	It’s all done.’ “She came in then, with her bonnet ribbons undone and her little boots caked with dirt. I watched them tensely, [MASK] with a sneer on his lips, she as unconscious of him as if he weren’t there.
<name>Fairyland</name>	Fairyland	Claudia	I had a vision of houses made for [MASK] in whose garden mice would be monsters, and tiny carriages, and flowery shrubbery become trees. Mortals would be so entranced, and drop to their knees to look into the small windows. Like the spider’s web, it would attract.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Madeleine	‘Fight them, [MASK],’ I was shouting to her. But all I could hear was her sobbing. Then I saw her in the whirl, a fixed, frightened thing, surrounded by other vampires. They were laughing that hollow vampire laughter which is like tinsel or silverbells.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Claudia	Death I couldn’t think of giving them. Life in death— it was monstrous. I turned away from [MASK]. I wouldn’t answer her. But angry as she was, wretched as was her impatience, she could not stand this turning away.
<name>Lucien</name>	Lucien	Santiago	[MASK] drew near, to bring up the subject of our rooms in the Hotel Saint-Gabriel; frightfully unsafe, he said, with an exaggerated stage gesture of the hands. And he showed a knowledge of those rooms which was amazing.
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Freniere	You chase after the phantoms of your former self. [MASK], his sister. .. these are images for you of what you were and what you still long to be. And in your romance with mortal life, you’re dead to your vampire nature!’
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Claudia	Her face was blanched and drawn, and suddenly she was scratching at her lips and staring at the dark stains on her fingertips. ‘No, no!’ I cautioned her gently, taking [MASK]’s hand and holding her close to my side.
<name>Locke</name>	Locke	Louis	And then he glared at the old man. ‘Kill him, [MASK]!’ he said to me, his voice touched with the first pleading I’d ever heard in it. Then he bit down in rage. ‘Do it!’
<name>Dracula</name>	Dracula	Lestat	‘Look at your wrist, your breast.’ And then he touched the wound in her throat. She put her hands to her throat and gasped, her mouth open, the scream strangled. I stared at [MASK]. I could not understand why he did this.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Lestat	“ ‘The wood, the wood,’ said the blond vampire feebly, and, as he motioned to the other to hand him the fuel by his chair, I saw clearly, unmistakably, the profile of [MASK], that smooth skin now devoid of even the faintest trace of his old scars.
<name>Lucifer</name>	Lucifer	Satan	I felt it was, for the priest. I’m sure he’d seen madness. Perhaps he had stood right over raving madness and pronounced it possession. You don’t have to see [MASK] when he is exorcised. But to stand in the presence of a saint...
<name>Help</name>	Help	Claudia	she asked him. “ ‘Something’s wrong with it,’ he gasped, and his eyes widened as if the mere speaking were a colossal effort. He could not move. I saw it. He could not move at all. ‘[MASK]!’
<name>Lestat</name>	Lestat	Lestat	Both of us had hunted the Freniere plantation, [MASK] for slaves and chicken thieves and me for animals.” “You were killing only animals?” “Yes. But I’ll come to that later, as I said.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Lestat	But no one here. No one near us. I could feel the breeze suddenly from the river and the hot air of the night rising and [MASK] near me, so still he might have been made of stone.
<name>Grimes</name>	Grimes	Lestat	A few late passengers came aboard, a couple lingered for hours at the rail nearby. But [MASK] and his apprentice, if they survived the fire (and I was convinced that they had) did not find their way to the ship.
<name>Uther</name>	Uther	Louis	“ ‘Why do you say this?’ he answered. ‘I don’t have the power, you must understand. They’ll rise against me. There is no reason why they should not. [MASK], I tell you, I cannot save her.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Lestat	I sat stunned, staring at her, too weak to move, my head rolling back against the headboard of the bed, my hands pressing down on the velvet spread. [MASK] was snatching her up, talking to her, saying a name.
<name>Grimes</name>	Grimes	Lestat	She stared at me with undisguised horror. It was as if in horror she forgot her own vulnerable position. And now [MASK], who was drawn to weakness like a parched man to water, grabbed her wrist, and she screamed and dropped the lamp.
<name>I</name>	I	Enjoyment	“The next night—after that which I just described to you— he jarred me miserably by asking me to go with him to the boy’s flat. He was positively friendly, in one of those moods when he wanted my companionship. [MASK] could bring that out of him.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Claudia	It was guilt—that shop of dolls [MASK] had described to me, shelves and shelves of the effigy of that dead child. But guilt that absolutely understood the finality of death. There was something as hard in her as the evil in myself, something as powerful.
<name>Oyama</name>	Oyama	Armand	And he looked from one to the other of us, his smooth face and pacific eyes very like they’d been all along, as though there had never been any change in him at all. “ ‘My name is [MASK],’ he said.
<name>Padre</name>	Padre	Armand	A curious and disturbing distance? A dull pain? A nameless tremor? Even in this worldly clutter, I saw [MASK] in his monkish cell, saw his dark-brown eyes, and felt that eerie magnetism. “And yet I did not move to go to him.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Claudia	‘There are things you want to know, and you don’t ask. You see [MASK] slipping away from you, yet you seem powerless to pre- vent it, and then you would hasten it, and yet you do nothing.’
<name>James</name>	James	Lestat	We went to every performance, even those by amateurs, and [MASK] would stride home afterwards, repeating the lines to me and even shouting out to passers-by with an outstretched finger, ‘Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow!’ until they skirted him as if he were drunk.
<name>Gabrielle</name>	Gabrielle	Claudia	[MASK] asked, perhaps just to let me know she hadn’t forgotten me, for she was quiet now for hours; no talk of vampires. But something was wrong. It was not the old serenity, the pensiveness that was recollection.
<name>Raffles</name>	Raffles	Lestat	It was [MASK] beyond question, restored and intact as he hung in the doorway, his head thrust forward, his eyes bulging, as if he were drunk and needed the door jamb to keep him from plunging headlong into the room.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Lestat	I was perhaps incapable of exerting my own will. It seemed more than ever absurd to me that [MASK] should have died, if in fact he had; and looking back on him, as it seemed I was always doing, I saw him more kindly than before.
<name>Montresor</name>	Montresor	Lestat	The girl was looking around like a terrified child. ‘No . . .’ she was moaning. And then, as he closed the lid, she screamed. She continued to scream within the coffin. “ ‘Why do you do this, [MASK]?’
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Lestat	And there now in the coffin, beneath a glass cover, I saw to my horror the skeleton of [MASK], the wrinkled skin now pressed into the very texture of his bones, his eyes but sockets, his blond hair billowed on the white satin.
<name>Lestat</name>	Lestat	Lestat	The fight had got the better of him in some way; or something had. ‘Get in your coffin,’ he said to me, without even the slightest anger. ‘But tomorrow night... we talk.’ “Well, I was more than slightly amazed. [MASK] talk!
<name>Camilla</name>	Camilla	Babette	She had such a sensibility that wealth itself meant nothing to her; family, a line ... this meant something to [MASK]. Though she was able to hold the plantation together, the scandal was wearing on her. She was giving up inside.
<name>Lestat</name>	Lestat	Lestat	[MASK] trusted no one, as you see. He was like a cat, by his own admission, a lone predator. Yet he had communicated with me that night; he had to some extent exposed himself simply by telling the truth. He had dropped his mockery, his condescension.
<name>Pegeen</name>	Pegeen	Death	“The music broke into a jig with their running, as round and round the stage the old woman pursued [MASK], until he finally flattened himself into the dark of a tree trunk, bowing his masked face under his wing like a bird.
<name>Lestat</name>	Lestat	Lestat	the vampire sighed. “Yes. I had it, and with it a supremely resolute anger. To glut himself upon the life of an entire family was to me [MASK]’s supreme act of utter contempt and disregard for all he should have seen with a vampire’s depth.
<name>Gypsies</name>	Gypsies	Babette	(This was true, I would not.) ‘But I can only think that you are an angel.’ And she begged to see my face. That is, she begged in the manner of such people as [MASK], who are not given to truly begging anyone for anything.
<name>Lestat</name>	Lestat	Lestat	As I said, [MASK]’s motives for everything revolved around revenge.” “Was it all started with the father? With the school?” “I don’t know. I doubt it,” said the vampire. “But I want to go on.”
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Armand	I heard [MASK] follow me to the window ledge. I could feel him beside me now, my eyes growing more and more accustomed to the luminosity of the sky, so that now I could see his profile and his eye on the falling rain.
