<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Felix	If he really was going home, she added as an afterthought. He had his own problems tonight; she understood them as little as she understood [MASK] himself. Take the way, for example, by which he always entered and left this house when he came here alone.
<name>her plan</name>	her plan	Finstersee	She has too much sense to mention that miscalculation in any report to her boss until she can make sure of complete success with [MASK]. She needs a triumph to justify, or excuse, the risks she took today.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Mathison	That should start everything moving.” “You mean, that’s all you want me—” began [MASK] in surprise. “It will be quite enough. Keep your visit as natural as possible. I don’t want you to do anything to create any serious doubts.”
<name>Kurt</name>	Kurt	Grell	The safest thing was to keep on being the harmless photographer, who certainly wouldn’t refuse a hot breakfast at the Gasthof Waldesruh. “Only what?” asked [MASK]. “I’m late as it is. My wife will start worrying.”
<name>John</name>	John	Lynn	“[MASK], I need you.” He pulled her around to face him. “Come with me. Please.” He dropped the coat around her shoulders, hurried her over to the front door, unbolted it.
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Greta	“Come in, come in,” she said, dropping the frown and picking up a more amiable look of welcome. “Please wait in there.” Her stick pointed to the room from which the man had appeared so quickly. “I will let [MASK] know you are here.”
<name>John</name>	John	Zauner	“We were ambushed ourselves. My men killed. I was left for dead. He escaped.” “Well, one failure—” “A big one,” [MASK] had said slowly. He fell abruptly silent.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Felix	It’s always very intriguing.” “And dangerous,” she said, eying him in dismay. “[MASK], you shouldn’t talk about it. You must be careful—” “I am,” he told her gently. He studied her troubled face.
<name>guns</name>	guns	Johann	I’d think that any caves were known, too.” “A cave would have to be deep. There is bound to be a guard with [MASK].” “At least one,” he agreed. “I don’t see the Nazis freezing to death.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Jimmy	“[MASK] wants to speak to his legal adviser.” She covered the mouth of the receiver. “He is terribly depressed. He thinks we are going to be caught up in a whopping scandal. Cheer him up a bit.” And who’s going to cheer me up?
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Mathison	“In that case, you’ve just argued yourself out of the job. We’ll avoid all chances; I go it alone,” [MASK] insisted. “Up to a point,” he added with a grin. “You stick fairly near, will you?
<name>Lady Windermere</name>	Lady Windermere	Elissa	He seemed much less annoyed than he was in the hall.” “Oh?” He heard a sound of movement near the door and turned his head. [MASK] was about to leave. She blew a kiss as she held up one glove.
<name>Macomber</name>	Macomber	Johann	Hell, thought [MASK], he wasn’t out there waiting when I came up the path; there wasn’t a movement, or a sound except my own footsteps. He must have slipped around from the kitchen when they heard me come in. “Back to the road!”
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Nield	There just isn’t any—if you treat it as one problem. Cut it into two, and you begin to find some sense.” [MASK] nodded, lit a cigarette. “You know all this. Or you wouldn’t be here.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Johann	“They’re in there,” she said as a return for [MASK]’s greeting. “Drinking.” And she nodded her head, sparse-covered with thin white hair pulled back in a knot from her white face, toward the kitchen.
<name>she</name>	she	Anna	You know what it’s like with adoptions: people don’t want the family to keep in touch. It’s understandable, I suppose. Too bad that [MASK] never had any children of her own. Never could understand it. She’s young, too.
<name>you</name>	you	Bill	We’ll play it down. You talk with him, then keep him beside you while you call me. Right?” “Anything in particular that you want me to say to him?” “Use your own judgment. You’re in charge, [MASK].
<name>him</name>	him	Johann	There was only one man in it then.” She was a dark-haired, dark-eyed girl with glowing cheeks and an easy laugh, but tonight there was no smile on her full red lips and she watched [MASK] anxiously.
<name>He</name>	He	Yates	He says the man is just a psychopathic liar who wouldn’t risk facing any real trouble.” “[MASK] thinks he could handle him alone?” “So I gathered. And I admit I was inclined to believe him.
<name>Ellie</name>	Ellie	Mathison	“Almost all of it.” “They certainly are moving quietly,” [MASK] said. “And the other buildings, too?” “Yes. The search is working from the outside in. Nothing to report as yet.”
<name>Colonel</name>	Colonel	Grell	Remember that large wardrobe in his room? He had an old coat at the back of it. Insignia cut off. But unmistakable cut and color.” Of [MASK] once again: “He reminds me of one of their colonels I caught. Important man.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Johann	Not likely with a job still to be done. Still to be done? [MASK] walked slowly over to the picnic table, put his foot up on a bench, rested one elbow on his knee as he stared across the short stretch of lake toward the hidden ledge.
<name>Phyllis</name>	Phyllis	Bill	He opened his door. “It would give me a chance for another farewell party,” he said lightly. “Now, [MASK]—” she remonstrated, and stepped into his room even as he turned to say good-bye. “I have to telephone.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Mathison	I’d stay close to my room for the next few days if I were you. We’ll send someone to keep an eye on you. Much safer.” He took [MASK]’s arm and led him toward the staircase. A friendly gesture?
<name>Leo</name>	Leo	Dick	He kissed her neck, her chin, her lips. She still strained away from him. “All right. I’ll just have to take [MASK]’s equipment to my place and try to hide it safely there.” He let go of her completely.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Lynn	Then he gave a yelp of pain as the sweater came away from his shoulder. He looked at [MASK], who was watching and suffering with him. “I told you I liked to complain. Would you mind taking over from this heavy-handed monster?”
<name>he</name>	he	Johann	Not so much because I insisted but because he realized he had to—in case something went wrong. But it didn’t, and now I can forget all about the chest. If only [MASK] doesn’t keep asking, asking, asking.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Mathison	Ahead of them, the ambulance was moving slowly, its rear lights rising and falling sharply with each bump on the rough hard ground. [MASK] watched them, flinched at one particularly heavy drop. The ambulance slowed, went on.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Johann	Come on, move out! We’ve waited long enough for you this evening.” He nodded to the man at the kitchen door, who moved quickly across the room, pocketing his revolver, to stand behind [MASK]. “Hands at your back!”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Trudi	“So have I. I won’t live with you and [MASK]. I’ll visit you now and again, that’s all.” She paused. “I’m coming this weekend.” She’s so transparent, he thought, and had to smile.
<name>whoever</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	whoever (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Mathison	And their dynamite exploded. Poor souls.” She stared blankly at [MASK]. “But why did they keep dynamite on my meadow?” she asked, turning indignant. “We could all have been blown to pieces.” She closed her door with a bang.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Elissa	[MASK] was the kind of girl you couldn’t ignore; and besides, he was telling himself, you owe her an apology even if it will have to be unspoken. What would she say if she thought he had blamed her for his own carelessness?
<name>George</name>	George	Dick	He turned his head aside and blew his nose violently. “Has [MASK] any spare handkerchiefs? This cold is all in my head now, blast it.” “I’ll get them. And his slippers.” “They won’t fit.”
<name>please</name>	please	Bill	“In any case, I’ve just been spilling out some of my own worries in the last few minutes. Perhaps they are ill-founded, perhaps not.” “I wouldn’t neglect them.” “Seriously? Go on, [MASK], be honest about them.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Johann	[MASK] can’t help me. You are the only person who could—perhaps—I thought—” She didn’t finish. They had been walking along the continuous stretch of quays that edged the river’s bank, separated from the traffic in the street by a line of trees.
<name>He</name>	He	Mathison	Then she was walking to the door, her heels clicking lightly on the tiled floor. [MASK] sat down at the table. It was small and lonely. He finished his drink, paid, and reached for his coat. The evening ahead of him seemed small and lonely, too.
<name>she</name>	she	Elissa	“Would it be likely that [MASK], even protected by using only a code name, had ever met any of those four? Face to face?” “Normally, no. But today was definitely abnormal. How did she manage to arrange everything so quickly?
<name>the photographer</name>	the photographer	Dick	She laughed as she passed him, hurrying toward the kitchen, already slipping one arm out of her coat. “HI bring around my camera after lunch and hear what [MASK] advises. It’s letting in too much light. I may have to get a new one.
<name>Javert</name>	Javert	Zauner	Haven’t you caught that man you were looking for?” “They are fishing him out of the lake right now.” “Then he didn’t surrender?” [MASK] had made it all seem so simple, a matter of routine. “No.
<name>Don Corleone</name>	Don Corleone	Keller	A good place to talk with various people who came into the shop as possible customers and then walked quietly upstairs for a meeting, or instructions, or delivery of information. [MASK]’s men have already intercepted two of them.”
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Grell	One man. Where had the other been? “I think I’ll call my wife,” he said easily, and waited for an abrupt refusal, a reversal in manner. “This way,” [MASK] said with a polite gesture toward the dining room.
<name>the speaker's</name>	the speaker's	Zauner	“Well, we are getting into the news these days.” “And that will please you,” the red-faced man observed. His face and voice remained genial, but he obviously did not share [MASK]’s amusement.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Anna	He blew his nose again, and that seemed to clear his brain for a moment. “[MASK]! He can’t have found the chest! Don’t you see? He never would be having breakfast at the inn with anything as valuable as that chest lying in his car.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Felix	He stifled some stronger language, thinking of what he was going to say to [MASK], and came back to the table to get another handkerchief. He blew his nose again, and that seemed to clear his brain for a moment.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Lynn	Then he was busy holding the elevator door, escorting her into the lobby, dropping their room keys at the desk, taking her arm as they stepped out into the busy street. “He was in the lobby,” [MASK] said as they walked toward the bridge over the river into the Old Town.
<name>unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Bill	“I’d love that. Good night, [MASK].” She rang off. He replaced the receiver slowly, still hearing the happy excitement in her voice. What have I done? he wondered. But it was too late for afterthoughts.
<name>The woman</name>	The woman	Anna	She moved fast. She knew her way around those streets.” He looked at the cluttered kitchen and then at the opened drawer. “She knew her way around here, too. She knew just what she wanted.” [MASK] looked at him blankly.
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Mathison	She covered the mouth of the receiver. “He is terribly depressed. He thinks we are going to be caught up in a whopping scandal. Cheer him up a bit.” And who’s going to cheer me up? wondered [MASK] as his worry increased.
<name>he</name>	he	Anna	And then, just as [MASK] was looking at him with new hope, he added, “But who is to judge how anything will be used?” “If you couldn’t judge the strength of a rope or the hold of a piton, where would you be?
<name>backup</name>	backup	Andrew	Go beyond it, actually; draw off the road, park in cover; walk back and join me. I’m at the edge of the meadow, in the central clump of trees. Bring that surprise package with you. You had better notify [MASK].
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mathison	“I’ll take care.” [MASK], briefcase safely gripped under one arm, groped for her coat on the chair near the door. “Got your bag, gloves, everything else?” “Yes.”
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Lang	Or perhaps he had been surprised. Only one thing was certain: the woman [MASK] had at least spoken the truth when she had said there was an army of agents pouring into the village, an army of agents moving with dangerous speed. He recovered his wits.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Mathison	Plagued by his own questions, which kept bobbing up no matter how he tried to push them firmly to the back of his mind, [MASK] could imagine the barrage he would have to face over a lunch table today.
<name>he</name>	he	Lev	Sometimes, she thought, watching his deliberate movements as he climbed the bank, it seemed as if [MASK] was more in the habit of giving commands than of taking them. She closed her eyes wearily. She had been traveling for almost six hours and they felt like sixty.
<name>Maxwell</name>	Maxwell	Newhart	At least, they were supposed to be on the same side of the fence. But he wouldn’t describe the placing of one of their agents inside a perfecdy innocuous American firm as exactly a friendly gesture. It was time to get prepared for [MASK]’s call.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Trudi	And keep it short, [MASK].” “About what?” She was frightened. She watched her mother moving with her slow hobbled step into her bedroom. “About the cars, and the direction they took last night.”
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Nield	At least, if I see her, he wants me to let him know.” “That’s one way of dealing with her.” [MASK]’s voice hinted that he could think of other ways, too. “But first we have to find her.
<name>Stradlater</name>	Stradlater	Mathison	“Come on, boys, come on!” he said tensely, revealing his own impatience. They waited in silence for a full minute. Then [MASK] saw a gleam from a far patch of dark shadow, as if someone had just lit a cigarette.
<name>The man</name>	The man	Mathison	[MASK] drew the pistol out of his pocket. “The hotel doesn’t like loud noises either.” He shook his head over his stupidity. And you thought you were so damned smart, he told himself. “I forgot about it,” he added frankly.
<name>Themis</name>	Themis	Nazis	“Who would they be?” He had disbelieved her before, had thought she was irrational, ill. Now he knew she had been telling him the truth as she saw it; she might even have told him some real facts. “[MASK]?”
<name>you</name>	you	Mathison	Roughly he pulled aside the tarpaulin, stared out at the lake. “I saved my wife from a gas chamber in exchange for leading my men into an ambush so that an SS colonel could be freed. What would you have done, [MASK]?
<name>Mr. Gatsby</name>	Mr. Gatsby	Mathison	“You might have trusted me a bit more tonight when [MASK] called you. It’s just possible—” “No,” she said sharply, guessing what was coming. “You’ll only endanger him too.”
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Elissa	“Have a good journey.” “Aren’t you here for the weekend?” [MASK] asked in dismay. “I did hope we’d be seeing each other—once I know where to unpack my things.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Nield	[MASK], he reflected, would have his work cut out for him. He had barely covered the distance of about two hundred yards when a small dark car, almost like one of the less-expensive taxis, pulled up just ahead of him.
<name>John</name>	John	Mathison	“Or perhaps you may have to face it—if enough obedient traitors hand the West over to a ruthless enemy. At least you’ve helped eliminate more than three hundred of them. In one night! My congratulations.” [MASK]’s lips tightened.
<name>Mark</name>	Mark	Trudi	He lit a cigarette, strolled over to the door, then remembered the mattress on the floor. “Okay,” he said, picking it up, “where does this go?” “[MASK] said we could leave it. Put it under the staircase.”
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Trudi	“I’d like to have seen you wrestling this mattress downstairs.” “It isn’t so big. [MASK] helped me. I—I thought I would hear you better—when you got back. But I didn’t. Funny, isn’t it?
<name>her</name>	her	Anna	He took off his sodden gloves, shredded and torn, and dropped them into the first piece of underbrush he passed. It was better to do that and tell [MASK] he had lost them than let her see the damage and start imagining the kind of dangers he had been through.
<name>she</name>	she	Elissa	“That’s grim.” But was it the truth? The trouble with one silly lie was that it kept casting its shadow around. Then he chided himself once more; he was becoming too damned suspicious. Why should [MASK] lie about her grandmother?
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Johann	That’s where I shall stay. Not with friends. [MASK] was wrong about that, but I let him take me to their house because he must find out what happened. I have to know. Don’t you see?” She looked at him pleadingly.
<name>Mr. Dursley</name>	Mr. Dursley	Keller	“At least, we now have something to—” [MASK] stopped short, once more glared up the staircase. “Does no one use the elevator any more?” he demanded angrily, rising quickly to his feet.
<name>Rollo Martins</name>	Rollo Martins	Lev	[MASK] was sitting very still. “You intend to go in by yourself?” “Yes. We can’t risk any complete strangers blundering around. The Austrians would pick them up and deport them. They’ve been doing that all summer.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Lynn	“Around half past two.” “How long will it take to discuss the contract with her?” “You just can’t go in and say, ‘Sign here!’ I can’t time myself. Exactly. Or [MASK], for that matter.
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Nield	[MASK] shot a quick look at him, then nodded briefly. “I’ve read your report, of course. What do you really know about that little lake?” “Just what I wrote.” “That’s all? Nothing to add?”
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Johann	She looked around the kitchen, thinking now of the Lang girl, who had come here in the darkness to steal. One of [MASK]’s girls. Twice she had been here with him, so filled with interest and questions and seemingly so harmless.
<name>Jean</name>	Jean	Anton	“Yes, sir.” “Now remember—get quickly through the village.” [MASK] nodded. He pulled the crumpled beret into an angle to cover the right side of his head, which would be seen from the more populated side of the street.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Bryant	The hunting season had started, but two days ago there had been an unexpected break in the crisp sunshine —a break for me too, [MASK] thought. Wise hunters would wait another day, until the mists and drizzle lifted from those mountainsides.
<name>he</name>	he	Mathison	I had better not, thought [MASK] as he stepped onto the narrow sidewalk and joined the brisk stream of foot traffic. This was a town of walkers; they knew how to step out, had little time for dawdling. That was how he came to notice the two men again.
<name>her</name>	her	Yates	The time for weeping is over. I have been calm, haven’t I?” But a very strange calm, he thought, and his alarm increased. “I wish I could have helped you about [MASK] and—” “Forget all that. Please.
<name>He</name>	He	Johann	[MASK] might wear a hooded jacket or his loden cape, but not an overcoat. “Then he came from some town or city, not from around here. Who drove away in the first car?” “Possibly two or three men.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Trudi	He glanced around; but it was only [MASK]. She came down to meet him as he climbed slowly up the next few stairs. She was barefooted, a shawl over her thick nightgown. “I heard two cars,” she whispered.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Anton	I don’t think he could have found the chest.” “This jacket is too small. I can’t button it.” [MASK] laughed at his wrists popping far out below the cuffs. “You aren’t going to be seen closely by anyone.
<name>Max</name>	Max	Mathison	The two Nazis were out of their car, following the woman. She could run and she could dodge, [MASK] noted; she was taking full advantage of the broken light with its strange patchwork of blacks and grays. She was already at the hiding place.
<name>backup</name>	backup	Bruno	If you act stupidly, you will not only endanger your mission but also destroy my future usefulness to your government. They will not thank you for that.” “You are responsible for me?” “I am in charge here until [MASK] arrives.
<name>Walt</name>	Walt	Johann	“Back to the road!” the newcomer said, and gestured with his revolver. “You have some questions to answer.” “I’ll answer them here,” [MASK] said, and headed toward the stove. “We need some heat in this place.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Zauner	Ten years, and you won’t be much use to anyone.” [MASK] held out the field telephone. “If you are as innocent as you say, use this. Talk to the men in the Sonnblick. Give them no reasons, no explanations.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Andrew	“Like me to take a look down in the Bryant hall?” [MASK] was already moving to the door. “Yes, that’s a— Wait!” The radio had given its muted rasp, three short clearings of its husky throat.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Mathison	“Isn’t that stretching the expense account?” [MASK] asked with some amusement. “Yes, but it may be cheaper in the long run. At least, that’s what I am beginning to think. What’s your opinion?”
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Dick	But his mind wasn’t trained for such deductions either; that was why he had given something away even as he had spoken to her, and she hadn’t the brains to see it clearly. As [MASK] would have.
<name>Roark</name>	Roark	Mathison	The door below the flight of stairs scraped shut; light footsteps came into the hall, walked unerringly. [MASK] relaxed as quickly as he had gone on guard. “Hello, there!” he called down to the woman who was unlocking the kitchen door.
<name>Inspector</name>	Inspector	Mathison	Lightly, he ran toward the rear door. [MASK]’s worry deepened even if that shot had not been fired with a silencer. The man must have made an effort to escape, if shooting had been necessary. Had he managed it?
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Johann	“I still think he is an agent.” “He is coming here with papers to be explained before I sign them, and one of the New York publishers is coming with him too—a woman. It’s all simple business.” “Oh.” [MASK] was deflated.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Lynn	From-the first car, two men slid out quickly and ran up the short path through the garden, heading straight for the door. They did not knock. They shoved it open, vanished inside. [MASK] . . .
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Nield	“Sure. You could have made me meet your unseen agent in the cemetery and had us match the torn top of a Jell-O box.” [MASK] recovered. “Now why didn’t we think of that?” He held out his hand.
<name>Mr. Bunting</name>	Mr. Bunting	Nield	The nearer he came to this house, the more he wondered what had prompted him to volunteer so damned readily for a job he knew little about. He was glad he was not alone, even if [MASK]’s company was ominous.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Bill	Really, [MASK], you are a cruel and horrible man.” “That’s me,” he said cheerfully, and slipped the address book into his pocket. He glanced at his watch, frowned. “You have to leave,” she said slowly.
<name>He</name>	He	Mathison	Traffic was fairly heavy on the street, a swift moving stream of taxis and small cars. [MASK] kept to the outer edge of the sidewalk, resisting the temptation to look around or seem anything other than a man stepping smartly into town.
<name>professor</name>	professor	Bryants	The hall was peaceful, and darker now as the afternoon began to draw to a close. In another hour, its gray shadows would thicken into solid black. Dusk came quickly here in autumn. He knocked on the [MASK]’ door. Knocked again.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Anton	“He has left? Hell take you, you let him leave!” [MASK] listened in silence to a string of curses, but his eyes were widening and his lips beginning to ease before he asked too innocently, “Didn’t you want him to leave?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Felix	So they are getting married, going to run her mother’s Gasthof.” “You believe that?” “For the next few weeks,” [MASK] said smoothly, “we must all appear to believe that.”
