<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Manna	Are you injured?” “I’m all right,” the woman said, still patting her buttocks. “She was so accurate, man. Caught me right between the legs.” Despite trying hard to restrain herself, [MASK] burst out laughing.
<name>John</name>	John	Lin	and she loved each other. Were you sure that you both would enjoy living together as husband and wife? We really loved each other, didn’t we? [MASK]’s temples were throbbing, and he took off his hat so that the cold air could cool his head.
<name>David</name>	David	Lin	She didn’t know how to ride a bicycle. If only she had dared to ask the leaders to assign an automobile to drive her there. She regretted not having listened to [MASK] the previous summer when he had offered to teach her how to bicycle.
<name>Antonio</name>	Antonio	Lake	The aluminum lid of the pot rolled away and hit the threshold, where it came to rest, leaning upright against two bricks piled together as a doorstop. “Even pigs won’t touch this,” she added. From inside the bedroom [MASK] broke out crying, then screamed at the top of his lungs.
<name>John</name>	John	Lin	She had set a record: For the first time a woman on the staff had gotten drunk at a holiday dinner. The word was that she could easily outdrink most men. After being shaken by this holiday incident, [MASK] began to think seriously about getting a divorce.
<name>Yura</name>	Yura	Manna	In a flash the front wheel hit the woman from behind and got in between her legs. [MASK] gripped both brake levers and the bicycle leaped with a screech; the pedestrian was tossed up a little and landed on the front fender.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Lin	“No, no, you don’t understand,” [MASK] said. “She doesn’t want any money. She’s a plain, simple-hearted woman.” “I don’t believe that. If you spend money on the right person, I’m sure it will help.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Manna	The cold water, falling over his cheeks and forehead, refreshed him. No sooner had he turned off the faucet than a piercing scream came from [MASK], which reminded him that he must have stayed in the bathroom at least half an hour and that it was time to go back.
<name>John</name>	John	Manna	I’m leaving now.” “Where are you going?” «'-p rc » lo my orrice. “All right, come back early.” She turned to [MASK] and asked, “Have you reported him to the Security Section?” “No.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Shuyu	But to her dismay, he went on to describe how he hadn’t been able to divorce his wife this summer, how he couldn’t abandon his daughter who was still so young and had hung on his neck all the time calling him papa, how he had tried to broach the topic with [MASK]
<name>Lucia</name>	Lucia	Shuyu	A fierce-looking goose was flapping its wings on [MASK]’s left. In the background were water vats, the thatched adobe house, and half an elm crown over the roof. “Heavens, oh her tiny feet!”
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Lin	All eyes turned to [MASK], who, still laughing, was making a kind of bubbling sound in his nose. He stopped to reply, “Yes, you’re right. You should get rid of the shell, the claws, and the head first.
<name>Susan</name>	Susan	Haiyan	At night when the patients in the ward were asleep, the two nurses had little to do except distribute some medicine in the wee hours and take a few patients’ temperatures, so they would chat. [MASK] was pretty and pert, always smiling with neat teeth and often surrounded by young men.
<name>Daughter</name>	Daughter	Hua	Don’t you want a son?” For a moment he remained silent. Then he said, “No, I don’t need a son. [MASK]’s good enough for me. My brother has three sons. Let them carry on the family line.
<name>Confucius</name>	Confucius	Confucius	“Men are all alike, beasts.” An old man in bifocals retorted, “A woman shouldn’t be allowed to divorce either, or else there’ll be disorder everywhere. The order of the world is rooted in every family, as [MASK] said.”
<name>Yoshioka</name>	Yoshioka	Lin	A ceiling fan chopped away vigorously above [MASK]’s head, yet he was sweating. He didn’t feel like eating anymore, so he finished the rice in his bowl, stood up, saying he had forgotten to put out the lights in his office, and made for the door.
<name>Yun</name>	Yun	Bensheng	He glanced at his daughter, whose face showed little response to his words. [MASK] frowned, then said plaintively, “I received your letter, elder brother. I understand you got what you wanted. But we’re still one family.”
<name>Yoshimoto</name>	Yoshimoto	Manna	“How is your daughter?” asked [MASK]. “She’s doing all right. She returned home yesterday afternoon. My sister-in-law is with her now. The doctor said there wouldn’t be any aftereffects.” “That’s good news.
<name>Ulysses</name>	Ulysses	Lin	Three nights in a row they heard nothing except for a cough made by [MASK]. One of the men sprained his ankle on the granite doorsteps, having trodden on a sleeping toad; another had his eye whipped by a twig in front of the house.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Manna	[MASK] asked, having picked herself up. The woman, remaining on her feet, grumbled, “My goodness, were you aiming for my behind?” “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to—”
<name>Meimei</name>	Meimei	Manna	One day in October, he and [MASK] went to the Marriage Registration Office downtown. They gave each of the two women clerks a small bag of Mouse toffees. Without delay the older woman, who looked wizened and limped slightly, filled out a certificate for them.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Shuyu	From now on you should keep your hair like this.” She turned aside and held up an oval mirror. “Now, how is that? Good?” [MASK] smiled and nodded. Thanking the woman again, she rose from the chair and limped out of the shop.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Manna	Were you sure she was the woman you’d spend the rest of your life with? Be honest now, among all the women you’ve known, who are you most fond of? Isn’t there someone else who is more suitable for you than [MASK]?
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Lin	A shotgun popped in the east; a pair of snipes took off, making guttural cries and drifting away toward the lake in the south. A dog broke out yelping. Someone was shooting pheasants and grouse in the marsh. Unlike the villagers, [MASK] didn’t burn the money.
<name>She</name>	She	Manna	[MASK] was sure he did. In secret she had once searched through the drawers in his desk when she was helping clean the windowpanes of the office he shared with another doctor, but she had found no photograph in them.
<name>He</name>	He	Manna	But he didn’t go to the kitchen. Instead, he went into the bedroom, flopped down on the camp bed, and pulled a blanket over his face. The bedsprings under him creaked as he turned now and then. [MASK] began sobbing.
<name>Yegor</name>	Yegor	Lin	“Well, some dead chickens and ducks, and a mad dog, that was our neighbor’s. The dog bit a schoolgirl and was shot by the police.” He turned to [MASK]. “Elder brother, I meant to ask your professional opinion.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Shuyu	Two days before he left home, his wife took a pillow into his room at night. He was already in bed and was surprised to see [MASK] come in with her face lowered and twisted a little. She sat down on the bed and sighed.
<name>Marni</name>	Marni	Haiyan	“I can’t walk either,” the large-eyed [MASK] broke in. “I have blisters too.” “Let me have a look,” he said. The old woman moved an oil lamp closer.
<name>Chun</name>	Chun	Lin	In the south, elm and birch crowns shaded their neighbors’ straw and tiled roofs. Now and then a dog barked from one of these homes. Having turned over all the books, [MASK] went out of the front wall, which was three feet high and topped with thorny jujube branches.
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Lin	There has to be a male partner who signs all the papers for you, or else no hospital would perform the operation. But by signing the papers, the man would have to take the punishment and all the responsibilities. Who would do that? Even [MASK] might not be willing to help me that way.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Lin	Both of them wore uniforms; the man was a head taller than the woman, who looked rather small and delicate. Every once in a while she would run a few steps to catch up with him. They looked familiar to [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Manna	Few leaders would now bother to criticize young men and women who walked in pairs outside the compound. He had heard that some nurses had even gone into the woods with their patients. Yet somehow to him and [MASK], there still seemed to be a wall around them.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Hua	He said, “[MASK], a man can’t feed a baby like your mom. I have no breasts, see?” He pulled up the T-shirt and showed her his flat chest. A mole like a tiny raisin was under his right nipple.
<name>She</name>	She	Manna	By now she was almost twenty-six, on the verge of becoming an old maid, whose standard age was twenty-seven to most people’s minds. The hospital had three old maids; [MASK] seemed destined to join them.
<name>Mei</name>	Mei	Manna	The movie was to be shown in the Workers’ Cultural Palace, which was just a mile away. The theater was almost full. As they were walking to their seats, [MASK] noticed several of her colleagues sitting among the audience and turning their eyes toward her.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Manna	But he decided not to concoct such a drink, believing those things would help burn him out sooner. He hoped [MASK] could slow down a little, but she was passionate as ever. Are other newlyweds like us? he asked himself.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Lin	[MASK] stood up as she went on, “Isn’t she your mother?” She broke into laughter, bending forward. His eyes flashed behind the lenses of his glasses. He picked up his cap and left the bedroom without a word.
<name>He</name>	He	Lin	The more she thought, the more agitated she became. Yet deep down, she felt she was not wrong. She made wontons for dinner, hoping he would come home on time. She boiled a pot of water and waited for him. [MASK] returned at six sharp as usual.
<name>He</name>	He	Lin	Did you put out the incense?” “Yes.” She climbed onto the brick bed, whose breadth was the same as that of the room, and lay down on the other end. Without a word she closed her eyes. [MASK] looked at her face carefully.
<name>Andrei</name>	Andrei	Bensheng	“Where did you get it?” he asked without taking the paper. “[MASK] gave it to me. He said there was a pile of it in the commune opera house.” She left the newspaper on the short-legged table.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Manna	But occasionally a phrase or a sentence would glow with the genuine feelings of a young man desperately in love. At one place he wrote, “[MASK], whenever I think of you, my heart starts quickening. I couldn’t sleep last night, thinking about you.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Shuyu	He was unhappy about it, believing she was too young to understand love, but he didn’t blame her. While she was helping him pack up [MASK]’s clothes, he continued to ask her about the young man.
<name>He</name>	He	Lin	She reminded her father that purslane might help, since in their home village people always used this herb to treat loose bowels. [MASK] remembered that several years ago when he visited a clinic in the countryside, he had seen barefoot doctors cook purslane stew in a cauldron.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Manna	“What an odd rule. He’s just a little kid,” she muttered. Though they were more careful the next evening, [MASK] rode into a weeping willow. A branch scraped her jaw and left a purple welt there.
<name>Olga</name>	Olga	Lin	He still didn’t see her face, though obviously she and he were the mistress and master of the house. A few of the guests stayed late, playing cards. In the study there were even two children, whom [MASK] taught patiently.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Manna	The hospital leaders told [MASK] to get ready as soon as possible, since it was already Monday. She was granted leave the next day. Because she would have to wear her uniform, there wasn’t much to prepare.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Manna	The gray strands gave him a sense of finality. At medical school twenty-five years before, he had grown some white hair, which later turned black again. Now there was no hope of reversing the gray. One day he and [MASK] jumped into bed after lunch and made love.
<name>Yoko</name>	Yoko	Haiyan	“Like I said, he isn’t a bold man.” “But doesn’t he love you? Maybe he’s no good in bed.” “Come on, he made a baby with his wife, a very healthy one.” [MASK] sighed feebly and clasped her hands.
<name>Andrey</name>	Andrey	Lin	Behind her back, people called her “a typical old maid.” [MASK] noticed the changes in her, but he didn’t know how to help her except to try to get the divorce the next summer. And about that he was uncertain.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Shuyu	She said to him, “Don’t talk too much in court, all right? And don’t argue with the judge.” She bit her lower lip. “I know. There’s no need to worry. I talked to [MASK] yesterday evening.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Manna	Under other circumstances, he wouldn’t dare give such advice that might get himself into trouble, but with [MASK], the words had just flowed out of his mouth. On their way back, she said to him as if embarrassed, “Can I ask you something I can’t figure out by myself?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Lin	Therefore you should treat each other with respect, care, and friendship.” “We will, Judge,” [MASK] said. “Good. The case is now settled.” The judge stood up; so did the woman clerk and the scribe.
<name>John</name>	John	Lin	The creatures were all sound asleep and made no noise except to grunt vaguely once in a while. The boys were actually young men now, tall like their father with thick muscular arms. [MASK] was glad to see them, although he had never known them well.
<name>She</name>	She	Manna	Damn them all! The rain turned heavy, larger raindrops falling on the greenish tiles and the concrete ground with a thickening, crushing sound. Two women in the lecture room stood up and came to the windows to close them, so [MASK] swung around, heading home.
<name>Yosuke</name>	Yosuke	Lin	However, two weeks after the festival she told [MASK] the truth. They were standing near a concrete electrical pole as she spoke to him. Overhead the power lines were swaying in the wind with a fierce whistle. Her words widened his eyes, riveted on her face.
<name>Lin</name>	Lin	Lin	It was said that she often told legendary tales to her roommates, who would treat her to haw jelly and sodas to keep stories rolling out from her tongue. This might have been what made her attractive to [MASK]. To some extent they matched each other; both were bookworms.
<name>Esteban</name>	Esteban	Lin	Their adobe house was the same as two decades before, four large rooms under a thatched roof and three square windows facing south with their frames painted sky blue. [MASK] stood in the yard facing the front wall while flipping over a dozen mildewed books he had left to be sunned on a stack of firewood.
<name>Shanta</name>	Shanta	Haiyan	Seeing the bridegroom’s flushed face, [MASK] pinched her husband’s neck and asked angrily, “Why the hell did you mention that thug here, moron?” She then gripped his ear and tweaked it. “Ouch! Let go.”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Lin	Wordlessly [MASK] took a bar of soap out of his bedside cupboard, picked up his washbasin, and left the room. He was still confused by the dream. In real life he could never imagine lying with an unknown woman in a wheat field and coupling like an animal.
<name>Lin</name>	Lin	Lin	He went on writing the phrase “Warmly Welcome” with a brush on a large sheet of paper. They were making posters for a general’s visit to the hospital. [MASK] was among the few skilled with the writing brush, so he had been assigned to the work.
<name>Ying</name>	Ying	Manna	After wiping the lenses with the end of his jacket and putting the glasses back on, he saw that the rice was already burned through. He picked up an iron scoop and was about to put a little water into the pot when [MASK] came into the kitchen, coughing and buttoning her jacket.
<name>Wang</name>	Wang	Lin	[MASK] was suspicious of this way of being paid, knowing well that once the house was occupied, the new owner could delay giving him the rest of the pay- ment forever, and that he might never receive the other two thousand yuan at all.
<name>Well</name>	Well	Lin	“What should I say?” “Just tell him what you think.” “[MASK], he made me feel like a moron. He really is a character.” “Why is that?” “I wasn’t attracted to him at all.
<name>Xiao</name>	Xiao	Manna	“Twenty thousand yuan.” “Wow, that’s about twenty times the amount you pay a worker. How come you made so much?” His eyes flickered as though fireflies were flitting in his pupils. [MASK] recognized the same lustful look in those eyes.
<name>Yossel</name>	Yossel	Bensheng	I’ll send my grandson over for the meat.” He clasped his hands behind him and strode out with measured steps. A tuft of white hair peeked through a hole at the top of his felt skullcap. [MASK] himself looked like an old man now.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Lin	A moment later [MASK] stood up and whisked the snow off his lap with the mittens. Instead of going up to the summit, he turned back at the middle of the slope, coming down slowly, weak at the knees.
<name>Yasha</name>	Yasha	Uncle	Where can you find a better lad, a real scholar?” “I’ve told you I don’t want to think about him, [MASK].” “He loves you.” “I told you I don’t want a bookworm.”
<name>John</name>	John	Lin	She believed them, since some books she had read had given the same advice. After [MASK] left for his office, she became resdess. More doubts came to her mind and set her imagination on the wing. She couldn’t help wondering if he still loved her.
<name>John</name>	John	Manna	With his forefinger he pressed the red skin around the largest blister, and [MASK] let out a moan. “The blisters must be drained,” he said to the nurses standing by. “Do you know how to do it?” “No.”
<name>he</name>	he	Lin	After that, she insisted [MASK] get another bed so they could sleep separately. “I don’t want to hurt the baby,” she explained, meaning they should stop having sex until the baby was born. He agreed.
<name>Occupations</name>	Occupations	Occupations	After considering several aspects of the poetry for another day, he decided to avoid dealing with the subjects of sexuality and selfcelebration, and instead focus on the symbol of grass and on those poems praising the working class, particularly the one called “A Song for [MASK].”
<name>Timothy</name>	Timothy	Lin	An old maid must be a wolf as well as a tiger, so only a young lion should engage her in battle. From the outset [MASK] should have known he was no match and should have set up a few rules with her. The office echoed with chortles.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Lin	The court advises you to wake up before you fall into the abyss of misfortune and cannot get out. ” Everyone was relieved to see the couple come out of the court still married. Some applauded. Having read the article, [MASK] was wretchedly disappointed.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Manna	He remained awake until midnight. Then in a half-sleeping state he saw himself and a woman, whose face he didn’t see clearly but whose figure resembled [MASK]’s, working together in an office, both in doctors’ white robes and caps.
<name>Yong</name>	Yong	Manna	How come she had blown such a rare opportunity so carelessly? How could she let a caged bird fly away? Indeed, an old maid couldn’t hold a man. Even the jeep driver who had driven [MASK] to the hotel would say, “She wasted our gas.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Manna	“I never thought the mountain looked so awesome,” [MASK] said to him. “Yes, it’s lovely.” “We can hardly see it from the hospital.” “Because of the smog or too many buildings blocking the view, I guess.”
<name>Wang</name>	Wang	Bensheng	The old man looked a little embarrassed, flashing a toothless smile, and then said to [MASK], “I must be going. I’ll send my grandson over for the meat.” He clasped his hands behind him and strode out with measured steps.
<name>She</name>	She	Manna	He had to phone home in the evening to check on her condition. [MASK] realized he had come all the way mainly to meet her. She wondered whether he actually measured five feet ten as his letter claimed. He was a scrawny man and looked older than his age.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Manna	They were both anxious. Meanwhile, [MASK] was aware that people began treating her differently. The hospital leaders became very considerate to her. Every now and then a nurse would fasten meaningful eyes on her, as if to say, “Lucky girl.”
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Lin	He asked [MASK] to help him find a girlfriend in the army hospital, because he would like to marry a doctor or a nurse. His wife had died two years before, leaving him three children. After long grief, he felt ready to continue with his life.
<name>Yanko</name>	Yanko	Lin	One night she even dreamed of a robust tree laden with pomegranates. She told [MASK] about the dream, saying the auspicious fruit portended that they would have a big boy. Somehow the impossibility of coming by a pomegranate corrected her freak appetite, and she began eating normally again.
<name>Aomame</name>	Aomame	Manna	Since his roommates were not in, he picked up his dictionary, Forest of Words, took a photograph out of the vellum cover, and handed it to her. It was a new one, black-and-white and four by three inches. Looking at it. [MASK] couldn’t help tittering.
<name>Grigory</name>	Grigory	In	[MASK] came a bareheaded lieutenant of slender build and medium height, his face marked with a few freckles. His collar was unbuckled and the top buttons on his jacket were undone, displaying his prominent Adam’s apple. He stood beside her, lifted his foot up, and placed it into the long terrazzo sink.
<name>She</name>	She	Manna	He laughed and resumed peeling the apple. He looked thinner than the previous year, but still very robust. He now wore a thick mustache, which made his face look rather Mongolian. [MASK] noticed his sinewy hands and felt that they were not made to handle fruit.
<name>Yingying</name>	Yingying	Shuyu	They clinked the cup and bowls and drank. [MASK] said to him, “Try a pie and see how good we made it.” With her chopsticks she put one of the two chicken legs in his bowl.
<name>Monseigneur</name>	Monseigneur	Lin	I often skip the first chapters, too many descriptions, passage after passage. The pace is too slow.” In fact, it was this little man who had notified [MASK] the previous year that he ought to close his library without delay to avoid having to forfeit his books.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Shuyu	They had never quarreled, and she would agree to anything he said. “[MASK],” he went on, “you know, I need a home in the army. It’s hard to live by myself there. I’m no longer a young man.”
<name>Comrade</name>	Comrade	Granny	He was surprised by the invitation and afraid that if he stayed with the nurses for dinner, people would gossip about him and the leaders might criticize him as well. He forced himself to say, “Good night, everybody. Good night, [MASK].”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Manna	[MASK] wasn’t interested in the illustrations. She had come here to see the man, not his work. She handed them back and said blandly, “Good pictures.” “They are for a children’s book. You like them?” “Yes.
<name>Yasha</name>	Yasha	Uncle	You bully me be-because I don’t have a child. You, you’re my born enemy. I want to get even with you.” He collapsed to the ground, sobbing like a little boy. “[MASK], don’t be so upset.
<name>Yevgeny</name>	Yevgeny	Manna	Moreover, the celebration of the poet’s self seemed to verge on a kind of megalomania that ought to be condemned. But on the whole this must be a good, healthy book; otherwise the commissar wouldn’t have let [MASK] read it.
<name>John</name>	John	Lin	She felt that there must have been something more than the reason he had given. Many men broke rules for the women they loved, and some did not regret having done that even when they were punished. How come [MASK] was so different from others?
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Lin	“Such a wimp!” he cursed himself in an undertone and clutched at his hair. “What did you say?” asked the young doctor who shared the office with him. “Oh, nothing.” For some reason [MASK] felt the case was not over yet.
<name>Lin</name>	Lin	Lin	Outside a few maple leaves were falling. He stood up, wiped his face with a wet towel, then went to bed. Some officers asked [MASK] when they could eat his wedding candies; he said it would be in a few months.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Lin	Putting it down on the kitchen range, she said to [MASK], “Something is wrong with me.” Hurriedly she went into the bedroom, and he followed her in. She looked down at the crotch of her baggy pants and found a wet patch.
<name>Viktor</name>	Viktor	Manna	On the ground, in front of the monument, a slogan was still legible: “Down with Russian Chauvinism!” Those words had been scraped off, but the dark strokes remained distinguishable on the grayish concrete. [MASK] arrived at ten o’clock.
<name>Mei</name>	Mei	Hua	Mother and daughter were making pies together. A round bamboo grid on a kneading bowl held three rows of pies. [MASK] was rolling out the dough with a wooden pin, while her mother was using a spoon to stuff the pies with sugared red-bean paste.
<name>She</name>	She	Shuyu	Thanking the woman again, she rose from the chair and limped out of the shop. Her hips hurt a little from the half-hour in the barber chair. When [MASK] was out of hearing, the people in the shop began talking about her.
<name>Stoner</name>	Stoner	Manna	“So this is a rare book?” [MASK] said a moment later. “Not exactly.” His face turned vivacious again. “In some university libraries you probably can find a copy, but it has been out of print since the early fifties.”
