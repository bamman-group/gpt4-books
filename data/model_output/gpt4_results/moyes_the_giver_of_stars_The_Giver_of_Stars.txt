<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Miss	“Is there something else?” “[MASK], my husband, he loves to read but his eyes ain’t too good in the dark and, to be honest, he struggles to focus because of the black lung. He’s in some pain most days.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Margery	He has some friends in the legal world and apparently across state lines there are some places that allow the children to stay with the mother, and matrons to attend properly to the women. Some have quite good facilities all told.” [MASK] had acted like she hadn’t heard a word.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Alice	“I couldn’t get it all out so there’s still a small mark.” She had paused, and added, “Just like last month.” [MASK] had bristled at the idea of the woman monitoring her “monthlies.”
<name>He</name>	He	Alice	Pulled a handful of it clean out. They say he still had half my scalp attached to it when he dropped it.” “You don’t remember?” “Nope. He’d knocked me out before he did it.” [MASK] stood in stunned silence.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Margery	You want to be very careful before you start throwing accusations around. You’ve caused enough trouble—” But [MASK] squared up to him. “I’ve caused trouble? Says the man who shot my dog? Who knocked two teeth right out of his daughter-in-law’s head?
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Margery	Or how [MASK] had kept a straight face and said, why, yes, of course. It was just the facts, after all. She would still be thinking about it—and still trying not to smile— when they all arrived back at the library the following day.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Kathleen	Eventually, like a wave crashing onto the shore, [MASK]’s sobs slowed, and quieted into sniffs and hiccups, leaving her to shake her head with embarrassment, and wipe at her eyes. “I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m so sorry.”
<name>She</name>	She	Margery	She tried to smile, but there was a warning underneath it. “I’m not asking, I promise. I’m just curious. Because it seems to me there’s not a whole heap of difference.” [MASK] put her knife and fork together on her plate.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Margery	None of them knew what to say to her and found themselves talking as if to a near stranger—did she want some more water? Was there anything they could get for her? Really, [MASK] should only say.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Darling	Around them sat the remains of their picnic. “[MASK]? Do you know what bird that is? I’ve never seen anything as red as that. Look! Even its beak is red.” “I’m not much for reading up on birds and such, sweetheart.”
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Fred	“Here.” He handed her a mug of hot coffee and she closed her hands around it, allowing the heat to seep in, grateful for something to focus on. [MASK] moved around her, shifting books, then reaching into the log basket to load the fire.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bennett	It doesn’t work like that.” “Says who? [MASK]—you don’t love me. And, I can’t... I can’t be the wife you need me to be. We are making each other desperately unhappy and there’s nothing . . .
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Alice	[MASK] thought of the crushing silence of her parents’ front room, the low squeak of the front gate, her father polishing his motor-car, whistling tunelessly through his teeth every Saturday morning, the minute rearrangements of fish forks and spoons on a carefully ironed Sunday tablecloth.
<name>Shirley</name>	Shirley	Sophia	Luckily for her, they seemed to comprise most of the townspeople, who believed that when so much bad had taken place, a new baby, whatever the circumstances, was nothing to get too aerated about. Apart from [MASK], that was.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Alice	They had cleared maybe a third of the library in the past hour but since then the water had risen to the second step and [MASK] was afraid they wouldn’t manage much more before it rose right over. “You okay?”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Margery	Nearly all your animals. So what is the difference between us living like this and doing it but just with a ring on your finger?” [MASK] took a swig of her coffee. “You said we weren’t going to do this any more.”
<name>She</name>	She	Alice	And we’re really sorry to trouble you with this matter. We wouldn’t be here unless we were desperate to help our friend—” “I ain’t sorry,” the girl said. [MASK] swallowed the rest of her sentence. Her shoulders slumped a little.
<name>Ellie</name>	Ellie	Kathleen	“It doesn’t make no sense to me.” “Makes perfect sense to me,” said [MASK], from the corner, where she was stitching a broken stirrup leather, grimacing as she forced the huge needle through the leather.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Fred	“You can’t move all these, just the two of you.” “We’ll save what we can. You need to go home.” When she hesitated again, [MASK] put his hand on her upper arm.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Alice	If you do choose to return without your husband, I have to inform you that you will not he welcome to stay here. Your loving mother [MASK] had held off opening the letter, perhaps because she had known the words she was going to find within it.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Kathleen	But we’d best not be too long. People are already eyeing ’em.” “I just . . . can’t bear it, [MASK]. Seeing her like that. Seeing the town like this. It’s like they just want the slightest excuse to think badly of her.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Margery	“Get a better offer, did you?” He smiled and placed his hand on [MASK]’s leg. She flinched. He removed it, his smile vanishing. “You okay?” “Can you come to mine when you’re done?”
<name>Jon</name>	Jon	Beth	She righted herself but he would not be moved, snorting and running backward until his brain was so addled she feared he would do himself an injury. Cursing, [MASK] had dismounted, thrown his reins over a pole and waded across the water toward them.
<name>Rosie</name>	Rosie	William	“I got [MASK] for company. We get by. And I’m hopeful. Things are good.” She smiled. “Got to count your blessings. I enjoy my job. I got friends here now.” “That’s a little how I feel, too.”
<name>Granny</name>	Granny	Kathleen	“Yes, ma’am,” said [MASK]. There was a brief pause. “Then you’d best come in.” As the librarians watched, the rough wooden door slid open a fraction, and then, after a moment, opened a little wider, creaking on its hinges.
<name>Shadow</name>	Shadow	Alice	She leaned forward and sniffed the baby-soft hair at the mare’s ears. “So you going to make love to her? Or you going to get on and ride?” “Now?” said [MASK].
<name>he</name>	he	Margery	“We can’t leave him.” They turned toward a shout. Two farmers were running toward them from the houses further back. Solid, middle-aged men [MASK] knew only by sight from the corn market, in overalls and oilcloths.
<name>she</name>	she	Margery	Along with food she would bring a change of undergarments, woolen sweaters, if needed, and a book, although the jail was so dark in the basement that there were only a few hours a day in which [MASK] could see to read.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Izzy	[MASK] stared out of the window at the gray skies, her finger tracing the rivulets that zigzagged down the pane, squinting at a horizon that was no longer visible. 1 ft f ell, your father thinks we should stay put.
<name>Boomer</name>	Boomer	Alice	“Well, I ain’t doing it. Got paws for hands.” She thought for a minute. “I got an idea, though.” She got up from behind the table and reached for her hat. “What?” said [MASK].
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Sophia	And you could be back here in an hour each day. We’d be glad to have you.” “It’s a colored library.” [MASK]’s voice hardened. She folded her hands in her lap.
<name>Blue</name>	Blue	Bluey	“Oh, not my boy. No. No.” She cradled the dog’s head, feeling the velvet-soft fur of his cheeks, stroking his muzzle, knowing even as she did that there was nothing to be done. “Oh, [MASK].
<name>Lucinda</name>	Lucinda	Lola	They put a Green Garter around her neck and she was with child the very next week. My cousin said the baby has eyes as gold as a copperhead’s. But then she always was the imaginative type.” “My aunt [MASK] was the same.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Alice	And as the tiny girl let out a thin, lusty cry, the world shifted, and they were suddenly laughing and crying and clutching at each other, and the men in the cells, whom [MASK] had not known were there, were exclaiming in heartfelt tones, “Thank the Lord!
<name>Emmett</name>	Emmett	Fred	[MASK] had closed up the barn and was looking at her expectantly. She thought of the quiet pleasure of sitting alongside him, of watching his strong hands on the wheel, his smile as he told her things in small bursts, confidences offered up like shells in the palm of his hand.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Marge	When she was sure the mare was comfortable, she headed for the back door of the library, from which she could still see a sliver of light through the unpapered gaps in the wood. “[MASK]?” she called. “Well, you sure do take your time.”
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Alice	well, men apparently do love to be touched— “Stop! Why can’t you just ... be a lady?” “What do you mean?” “This touching and this reading of smut. What in hell is wrong with you, [MASK]?
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Charley	“Good boy, [MASK]. Come on, boy.” Time slowed. They seemed to move forward in inches. She had no idea what was underneath. A solitary wooden drawer of neatly folded clothing floated by in front of them, followed by another, and then a small dead dog.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Alice	It was then that [MASK] saw she walked with a pronounced limp, and that her lower left leg was encased in a leather and metal brace, the shoe at the end built up so that it resembled a small black brick.
<name>August</name>	August	Alice	“There is always a way out of a situation. Might be ugly. Might leave you feeling like the earth has gone and shifted under your feet. But you are never trapped, [MASK]. You hear me? There is always a way around.”
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Kathleen	She pressed her head to [MASK]’s, trying to lift a little of the sadness, to tell her silently that there was still beauty in this world, even if some days it took every bit of strength and obstinacy to find it.
<name>Isadora</name>	Isadora	Marge	“You can call me [MASK].” She glanced up at the sky, wedged a wide-brimmed leather hat onto her head, and strode off toward a large mule, which she greeted with the same enthusiastic surprise as if it were an old friend she had just bumped into on the street.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sven	I was thinking I might go in with him. I can’t work down those mines for ever.” She pulled her attention back to [MASK]. “How much land you talking about?” “About four hundred acres. There’s good hunting.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Millie	“I made a pie.” “You made a pie? By yourself?” “From a recipe. In that Country Home magazine you left us. A peach pie. I would offer you a slice but we ate it all.” [MASK] giggled.
<name>Eleanor</name>	Eleanor	Alice	“Well,” [MASK] said, after a moment, “I do believe that if we can encourage godless families to read, we can encourage them to turn to scripture, and the Bible, and that can only be good for everyone.”
<name>Roarke</name>	Roarke	Fred	As she had every morning and every night since, she felt [MASK]’s fingers tracing her cheek, saw his narrowed, serious eyes, wondered how it would feel to have those strong hands tracing her body in that same gentle, purposeful way.
<name>Max</name>	Max	Bluey	She was rigid, her eyes trained on the horizon, her jaw set. [MASK] sat at her feet, glancing up at her from minute to minute, as if her anxiety had rubbed off on him, and shaking in short bursts from the cold.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Alice	But, more importantly, those animated tall tales left [MASK] to eat her food largely unobserved and unbothered. Or, at least, they had. “So when are you two young ’uns going to bless my old friend here with a grandchild or two then, huh?”
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Alice	The two men looked at each other. [MASK] dragged her knife across a piece of chicken, not looking up from her plate. “Knowledge is so important, don’t you think? We all say at the library, without facts we really do have nothing.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Alice	He stopped as the others went inside. “Would you like something to eat before you head off?” [MASK] glanced behind her at the people still spilling out of the upper level of the courthouse and felt suddenly mutinous. Why shouldn’t she eat where she wanted?
<name>Blue</name>	Blue	Alice	What did I say?” Ugly. [MASK] kicked at a stone on the ground, digging her toe in until it dislodged. There is always a way out of a situation. Might be ugly. Might leave you feeling like the earth has gone and shifted under your feet.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Beth	“I can still ride, though, right?” said [MASK], when the doctor had finished. She held her arm in front of her as he looped the sling around her neck and tied it carefully. “Absolutely not.
<name>Aria</name>	Aria	Margery	[MASK] rode home deep in thought, nostalgic for times when all she had to think about was whether she had enough food for the next three days. As she often did, when her thoughts grew deep and cold, she murmured to herself under her breath.
<name>John</name>	John	Sophia	She didn’t speak for a moment, then wiped at her eyes with the heel of her palms. “I’m fine, [MASK]. Thank you.” She looked over her shoulder at the door. “Plenty worse off than me, right?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bennett	All around her the boulders emerged almost horizontally from the side of the mountain in thick layers, or formed natural stone arches, weathered by centuries of wind and rain. Up here she was separated from the town, from [MASK] and his father, by more than geography.
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Alice	[MASK] relaxed. She pulled out a seat, as nobody else was going to, and sat down at the table. “Oh. Those. I . . . took them.” “What do you mean you ‘took’ them? Where’d you take them?”
<name>Calpurnia</name>	Calpurnia	Sophia	She could just make out [MASK] standing, rigid, in the corner, her gaze fixed on some indeterminate point on the floor. “You got a colored in your library.” The boy’s voice held a nasal whine and was slurred with drink. “Yup.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Bluey	“So I guess it’ll be Christmas here, then,” he said. “All the relatives as usual. A packed house,” she said, her lips an inch from his. “Me, you, um . . . [MASK] over there.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Alice	[MASK] felt the little horse shoot forward under her and they were cantering up a long flint track that gradually became more shadowed until they were in the mountains, the horses’ necks extending, their noses lowering with the effort of picking their way up the steep stony pathways between the trees.
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Alice	But there was no escaping it: it was all over her hands, her shirt, in her hair. The creature scuttled off nonchalantly into the night, leaving [MASK] batting at her clothes, as if by waving her hands and yelling she could make it all go away.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Margery	[MASK] walked into the little fenced-off enclosure (it could barely be called a garden) and closed the gate behind them. She appeared not to notice the gun or, if she did, she ignored it.
<name>Stargirl</name>	Stargirl	Margery	“You know what 1 mean.” [MASK] shrugged. “Last time I looked you didn’t need your leg to sing.” “But people wouldn’t listen. They’d be too busy staring at my brace.”
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Alice	[MASK]’s hands flew to her face as she realized she no longer knew what her husband liked, let alone his collar size. She reached for a set of boxed handkerchiefs on the shelf, decorated with a sprig of holly. Were handkerchiefs too impersonal a gift for one’s husband?
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Sophia	“Can we at least wait for her to get here before you start scolding me?” [MASK] raised her eyebrows. “I’m just saying. Life’s hard enough growing up in this town without you giving the poor child another yoke around its neck.
<name>Delilah</name>	Delilah	Nancy	according to this, it’s not far over that ridge,” she said, squinting at the hand-drawn images. “She said the sisters live four miles that way, and [MASK] would always walk the last part because of the hanging bridge, so I make the McCullough house . . .
<name>Delilah</name>	Delilah	Margery	“You can tell me anything, darling.” He raised an eyebrow, his smile knowing. “Anything you like.” [MASK] leaned forward so that she was whispering in his ear. “The hand that’s in my pocket? It’s resting on my gun.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Alice	“Of course it was her! You know darn well that the little polio girl wouldn’t do it and nor would our [MASK]. That leaves the farm girl and the colored. And I’d put money on it she don’t ride.”
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Fred	“I do not.” “I know most of them by person, as do half the good people here. You listing them as mulatto on your books doesn’t change the facts.” “Oh, boy,” said [MASK], under his breath.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Alice	Hey! Stop your yammering and come over here, girl. You got something for me, huh? Cos I got something for you.” [MASK] turned, her face a fury, and placed her hands on her hips. “Oh, do shut up!
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Alice	hillbilly. She—she just hangs off [MASK]’s coattails. Got some kind of fascination with her. You don’t want to listen to anything anyone says about that girl. Hah! Last I heard, her so-called library was on its last legs anyway.
<name>He</name>	He	Alice	But it’ll never forget. And it sure as hell won’t care for you. So if I wouldn’t do it to a horse, I could never work out why I should do it to a human.” [MASK] pushed the bowl away slowly as he continued.
<name>Jasper</name>	Jasper	Margery	The horse and the mule snorted and backed up briefly as a huge truck bearing timber came past, but then abruptly they were out of town and headed up a steep, narrow track. [MASK] pulled back a little as the track widened, so they could travel side by side.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	“Aren’t you meant to be finding your way home?” said [MASK], grumpily. She was forced to conclude she had no clue where she was. She would have to retrace her steps until she found her way back to a landmark.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Izzy	But if they do get satisfaction, ‘every organ in their bodies is influenced and stimulated to play its part, while their spirits, after soaring in the dizzy heights of rapture, are wafted to oblivion.’” “My organs are meant to be wafting?” said [MASK].
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Bennett	It’s about what love can be between a man and his wife. It’s by a medical doctor. And it says that we should feel free to give each other pleasure in all sorts of—” “You’re reading whatV’ [MASK] pushed himself upright.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Izzy	“I was the same when I was a little girl. Should have made myself eat some breakfast.” They walked on in silence. “It’ll probably be better once our side gets to speak,” [MASK] said. “Yeah.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Alice	This time it was [MASK] who rose. She climbed off the bed, picking up the pieces of the lamp so that she didn’t tread on them in bare feet, and placed them carefully on the bedside table.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Sven	He destroys everything that’s beautiful.” [MASK] pulled her to him. “Not everything.” He placed his hand on her belly and left it there until he felt her soften in his arms. “C’mon,” he said, and kissed her.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Alice	[MASK] slammed her book down on the desk. “Some of us are actually trying to work here.” There was a brief silence. The women exchanged sideways looks. “I’m just joking with you.” “Well, some of us don’t want to hear your horrible jokes.
<name>Rose</name>	Rose	Kathleen	“Tell her to go,” he said. “But what will you do?” said [MASK], minutes later. “You can’t move all these, just the two of you.” “We’ll save what we can. You need to go home.”
<name>Jedediah</name>	Jedediah	Bob	“Well, [MASK], I can’t say I’m surprised. You know she’s been causing trouble the whole year, destabilizing our community, spreading wickedness.” He leaned forward and lit the sheriff’s cigar with a click of his brass lighter.
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Spirit	She stopped in a clearing, trying to gauge from her hand-drawn maps where she was meant to be, struggling to see the position of the sun through the dark green canopy above. [MASK] stood stock still, her head drooping in the mid-afternoon heat that managed to penetrate the branches.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Verna	They returned to their old home only to bring back a jute bag of clothing, two pans and the mean dog. “The rest of it stunk of our daddy,” [MASK] said, and never spoke of it again.
<name>Temeraire</name>	Temeraire	Charley	Everything felt wrong while she was locked away, the mountains empty, the library missing some vital piece. Even [MASK] was listless, pacing backward and forward along the rail, or just standing, his huge ears at half mast, his pale muzzle lowered halfway to the ground.
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Alice	[MASK] closed the door behind her, taking in the neatly laid table, with a little vase of coltsfoot, harbinger of spring, in the center, the two chairs, and the oil lamps flickering on the desks nearby, sending shadows over the spines of the books around them.
<name>Irma</name>	Irma	Sophia	It’s bugging me because I got two families asking and nobody seems to know where it’s gone. And you know how ornery [MASK] gets when books go missing.” She adjusted her stick under her arm and moved to her right, peering closely at the titles.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Spirit	We got work to do.” He wrestled the wheel so that the car spun around her and accelerated briskly up the road, leaving [MASK] to prance and shy as the gravel sprayed at her feet. It shouldn’t have been a surprise.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Fred	“If we had done it. Married love.” [MASK] put down his glass. A long, painful moment passed before he spoke. “You don’t . . . know?" “No,” she said miserably. “Whoa. Whoa.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Alice	He broke it, raised his hat in greeting, and trudged back up the wet path to his house. [MASK] stood watching, thinking of the warmth inside, the blue rag rug, the sweet smell of the polished wood.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Alice	He shuddered to an abrupt halt, so that the dog leaped up, its tail between its legs. He was waving at her, his smile wide and uncomplicated. She couldn’t help but smile back: he was as handsome as a movie star on a cigarette card. “[MASK]! . . .
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Alice	[MASK] handed her husband the bottle and waited as he lifted himself on one elbow to take a swig from it, half hoping that he would just lean over her and scoop her up. When he lowered himself down she tucked herself into his arm and placed her hand on his shirt.
<name>Miss</name>	Miss	Henry	“And, [MASK]? I’m a real good shot . . .” The man stumbled over the feet of the stool she was sitting on. He didn’t say a word but walked briskly back to the other end of the bar, shooting glances behind him as he went.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Fred	His eyes were red with exhaustion, and new deep grooves ran down each side of his mouth that had nothing to do with the baby. [MASK] promised him at the first word of anything he would drive right over. “I’ll tell her—I’ll tell her . . .”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Margery	“We need to let our hair down a little. We’re all work and no play.” She grinned. “I think we need to have us a meeting.” “We’re having a meeting,” said [MASK]. “Not this kind of meeting.”
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Alice	“But I promise we’ll bring more next week.” “Can you bring me a comic book? My sister read a comic book and it was awful good. It had pirates and a princess and everything.” “I’ll do my best,” said [MASK].
<name>Clary</name>	Clary	Alice	“I worked it out sitting here. Maybe that’s the thing we need to understand, [MASK]. That some things are a gift, even if you don’t get to keep them.” There was a silence before he spoke again.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Bennett	You and she will become real friends, I know it.” “Oh. Yes. I suppose so.” They stood awkwardly in front of each other for a moment longer. Then [MASK] reached out a hand, and leaned forward as if to kiss her.
<name>Rooster</name>	Rooster	McCullough	“Any beef your family had with my daddy, that’s buried with him. It’s only me left, and I ain’t interested in blood feuds.” [MASK] is directly in her path now, his legs braced in the snow, his finger still on the trigger.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Kathleen	How they would take him quite out of himself.” “Your son? Oh, my goodness. I’m so sorry.” She meant it. “He really did seem the nicest of men. And he and [MASK] were so very fond of each other.”
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Marge	He turned toward her in the dark. “You’re not getting sentimental on me, are you. [MASK]?” “Didn’t say I was going to say it twice.” He smiled and lay back against the bolster.
