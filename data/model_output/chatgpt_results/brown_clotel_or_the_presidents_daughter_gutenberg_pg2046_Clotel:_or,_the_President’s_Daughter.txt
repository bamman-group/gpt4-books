<name>Jenkins</name>	Jenkins	Jerry	The next morning, as the passengers were assembling in the breakfast saloons and upon the guards of the vessel, and the servants were seen running about waiting upon or looking for their masters, poor [MASK] was entering his new master's stateroom with his boots.
<name>Annemarie</name>	Annemarie	Jane	He had in his hand a rope ladder. As soon as [MASK] saw this, she took the sheets from her bed, tore them into strings, tied them together, and let one end down the side of the house.
<name>Uncle Remus</name>	Uncle Remus	Sam	Well den, dat's some exchuse for her," remarked [MASK]; "for I don't like to see dis malgemation of blacks and mulattoes." "No mulatto?" inquired one of the corn-how.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Gertrude	Moreover, [MASK], though inferior in beauty, was yet a pretty contrast to her rival. Her light hair fell in silken ringlets down her shoulders, her blue eyes were gentle though inexpressive, and her healthy cheeks were like opening rosebuds.
<name>principle</name>	principle	Georgiana	From this [MASK] took courage and said, "We must try the character of slavery, and our duty in regard to it, as we should try any other question of character and duty. To judge justly of the character of anything, we must know what it does.
<name>Cleofilas</name>	Cleofilas	Buddington	And, very recently, the following paragraph appeared in the city papers:-- "'There has been quite a stir recently in this city, in consequence of a marriage of a white man, named [MASK], a teller in the Canal Bank, to the Negro daughter of one of the wealthiest merchants.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Johnny	So jist as I was puttin' on my hat, '[MASK],' cries out aunty, 'What,' says I. 'Now I'll tell you, I don't want you to say nothin' about it, but
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Devenant	The ship was to sail at twelve o'clock that night, at high tide; and following the men who were seeking passengers, we went immediately on board. [MASK] told the captain of the ship that I was his sister, and for such we passed during the voyage.
<name>Africa</name>	Africa	Afric	"Our eyes are yet on [MASK]'s shores, Her thousand wrongs we still deplore; We see the grim slave trader there; We hear his fettered victim's prayer; And hasten to the sufferer's aid, Forgetful of our own 'slave trade.'
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sam	Do you think that was [MASK] we heard singing?" "I am sure of it," was the answer. "I could not have believed that that fellow was capable of so much deception," continued he.
<name>Mark Twain</name>	Mark Twain	Diogenes	" "What do you mean by full price?" "What do you charge per hundred-weight for goods?" inquired the Negro with a degree of gravity that would have astonished [MASK] himself. "A quarter of a dollar per hundred," answered the conductor.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Bruin	[MASK] 'sung out' at this, 'and made a dash for his opponent's nose.' "Missing this, the bull turned to the 'about face,' and the bear caught him by the ham, inflicting a ghastly wound.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sam	dat pretty quick, you'll be a gone coon, and dat's sartin." At this the man appeared frightened, and inquired what was the matter with him: in answer, [MASK] said, "I done told you dat your case is a bad one, and dat's enough."
<name>Plummer</name>	Plummer	Sam	[MASK] had him fast. After a great effort, out came the sound grinder, and the young doctor saw his mistake; but consoled himself with the idea that as the wrong tooth was out of the way, there was more room to get at the right one.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Jerry	"Now go back to your bed, and be up in time to-morrow morning to brush my clothes and clean my boots, do you hear?" "Yes, sir," responded [MASK], as he wiped the tears from his eyes.
<name>Uncle Remus</name>	Uncle Remus	Actaeon	What was an irregular cry, now deepens into one ceaseless roar, as the relentless pack rolls on after its human prey. It puts one in mind of [MASK] and his dogs. They grow desperate and leave the road, in the vain hope of shaking them off.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sam	But there was one great drawback to [MASK], and that was his colour. He was one of the blackest of his race. This he evidently regarded as a great misfortune. However, he made up for this in his dress.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Currer	"--Vicksburg Sentinel, Dec. 6th, 1838. [MASK] was one of those who witnessed the execution of the slave at the stake, and it gave her no very exalted opinion of the people of the cotton growing district. CHAPTER IV THE QUADROON'S HOME
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Clotel	The Southerner had to admit that he was beat by the Yankee. During all this time, it must not be supposed that the old gent with the two daughters, and even the young ladies themselves, had been silent. [MASK]
<name>Frederick Douglass</name>	Frederick Douglass	Snyder	"You see," replied [MASK], "no white man is respectable in these slave states who works for a living. No community can be prosperous, where honest labour is not honoured. No society can be rightly constituted, where the intellect is not fed.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Pompey	"How old is you?" asked [MASK] of a tall, strong-looking man. "I was twenty-nine last potato-digging time," said the man. "What's your name?"
<name>Frederick Douglass</name>	Frederick Douglass	William	Slavery is a school in which its victims learn much shrewdness, and [MASK] had been an apt scholar. Without asking any more questions, the Negro took his seat in one of the first-class carriages. He was soon seen and ordered out.
<name>Uncle Tom</name>	Uncle Tom	Carlton	Well, every one to his own way of thinking," said [MASK], as he changed his position. "I confess," added he, "that I am no great admirer of either the Bible or slavery. My heart is my guide: my conscience is my Bible.
<name>Albina</name>	Albina	Mary	Their first-born was named [MASK], and her complexion was still lighter than her mother. Indeed she was not darker than other white children. As the child grew older, it more and more resembled its mother.
<name>the slave</name>	the slave	William	It is usual, before the departure of the boats, for an officer to examine every part of the vessel to see that no slave secretes himself on board. "Where are you going?" asked the officer of [MASK], as he was doing his duty on this occasion.
<name>Nellie</name>	Nellie	Currer	This was the parson's country house, where the family spent only two months during the year. The town residence was a fine villa, seated upon the brow of a hill at the edge of the city. It was in the kitchen of this house that [MASK] found her new home.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	George	The city authorities, at their next meeting, passed a vote of thanks to [MASK]'s master for the lasting benefit that the slave had rendered the public, and commanded the poor boy to the special favour of his owner.
<name>the traveler</name>	the traveler	Johnson	After a conversation of some minutes, and a plea on the part of [MASK] that he did not wish to be delayed owing to his illness, they were permitted to take their passage without farther trouble, and the boat was soon on its way up the river.
<name>The Parson Carlton</name>	The Parson Carlton	Clotel	[MASK] was sold at private sale to a young man for a housekeeper; but even he had missed his aim. CHAPTER XVI DEATH OF THE PARSON CARLTON was above thirty years of age, standing on the last legs of a young man, and entering on the first of a bachelor.
<name>he</name>	he	George	She revealed to him the secret that was then occupying her thoughts, viz. that [MASK] should exchange clothes with her, and thus attempt his escape in disguise. But he would not for a single moment listen to the proposition.
<name>Beau</name>	Beau	Sam	On the evening of the party therefore, when all the servants were at the table, [MASK] cut a big figure. There he sat with his wool well combed and buttered, face nicely greased, and his ruffles extending five or six inches from his breast.
<name>my dear</name>	my dear	Carlton	" "Now, [MASK], you have begun again to harp about man's rights; I really wish you could see this matter as I do. I have searched in vain for any authority for man's natural rights; if he had any, they existed before the fall.
<name>the passenger</name>	the passenger	William	Just before arriving at the end of the journey, the conductor called on [MASK] for his ticket. "I have none," was the reply. "Well, then, you can pay your fare to me," said the officer. "How much is it?"
<name>Nat Turner</name>	Nat Turner	Turner	" He was a preacher amongst the Negroes, and distinguished for his eloquence, respected by the whites, and loved and venerated by the Negroes. On the discovery of the plan for the outbreak, [MASK] fled to the swamps, followed by those who had joined in the insurrection.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Pompey	[MASK] had long been with the trader, and knew his business; and if he did not take delight in discharging his duty, he did it with a degree of alacrity, so that he might receive the approbation of his master.
<name>Belle</name>	Belle	Jane	[MASK] was purchased by a dashing young man, who had just come into the possession of a large fortune. The very appearance of the young Southerner pointed him out as an unprincipled profligate; and the young girl needed no one to tell her of her impending doom.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Clotel	But the degradation and harsh treatment that [MASK] experienced in her new home was nothing compared with the grief she underwent at being separated from her dear child. Taken from her without scarcely a moment's warning, she knew not what had become of her.
<name>Simon Legree</name>	Simon Legree	Huckelby	" "I wonder the Negroes don't attempt to get their freedom by physical force." "It ain't no use for 'em to try that, for if they do, we puts 'em through by daylight," replied [MASK].
<name>Desiree</name>	Desiree	Clotel	Most quadroon women who are taken to the lower countries to be sold are either purchased by gentlemen for their own use, or sold for waiting-maids; and [MASK], like her sister, was fortunate enough to be bought for the latter purpose.
<name>Abraham Lincoln</name>	Abraham Lincoln	Carlton	This chastisement was given because the Negro grumbled, and found fault with his master for flogging his wife." "Well, this is a bad state of affairs indeed, and especially the condition of the poor whites," said [MASK].
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Carlton	But her remarks had done a noble work. The father's heart was touched; and the sceptic, for the first time, was viewing Christianity in its true light. "I think I must go out to your farm," said [MASK], as if to break the silence.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Georgiana	[MASK] was in her nineteenth year, and had been much benefited by a residence of five years at the North. Her form was tall and graceful; her features regular and well defined; and her complexion was illuminated by the freshness of youth, beauty, and health.
<name>him</name>	him	Carlton	Yet there was one way in which the thing could be done. She loved [MASK], and she well knew that he loved her; she read it in his countenance every time they met, yet the young man did not mention his wishes to her.
<name>Simon</name>	Simon	Joe	He lived in disgrace and infamy, and died in wretchedness. You all despised him--you all know his brother [MASK], who lives on the hill? He's not a bit better though he has scrap'd together a little property by cheating his neighbours.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Walker	[MASK] and the parson went into the saloon, talked over the matter, the bill of sale was made out, the money paid over, and the clergyman left, with the understanding that the woman should be delivered to him at his house.
<name>Harriet</name> (referring to Harriet Tubman, who helped slaves escape through the Underground Railroad and often sought refuge at farms)	Harriet (referring to Harriet Tubman, who helped slaves escape through the Underground Railroad and often sought refuge at farms)	George	The men followed, and were but a short distance from [MASK], when he ran up to a farmhouse, before which was standing a farmer-looking man, in a broad-brimmed hat and straight-collared coat, whom he implored to save him from the "slave-catchers.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Snyder	"Yes," replied [MASK], "I did not find anything else up there. The state makes no provision for educating the poor: they are unable to do it themselves, and they grow up in a state of ignorance and degradation.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Carlton	" "Did they catch him?" asked [MASK]. "Yes," replied she. "In chasing him through the woods, he attempted to escape by swimming across a river, and the dogs were sent in after him, and soon caught him.
<name>Temperance</name>	Temperance	Temperance	" "I mean, do you belong to the order of Odd Fellows?" "No, no; I belong to the order of married men." "Are you a mason?" "No, I am a carpenter by trade." "Are you a Son of [MASK]?"
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Clotel	[MASK] was now in her native town, and near her daughter; but how could she communicate with her? How could she see her? To have made herself known, would have been a suicidal act; betrayal would have followed, and she arrested.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Snyder	He encouraged his driver to work the field-hands from early dawn till late at night; and the good appearance of the house-servants, and the preaching of [MASK] to the field Negroes, was to cause himself to be regarded as a Christian master.
<name>Dido</name>	Dido	Althesa	[MASK], although as white as most white women in a southern clime, was, as we already know, born a slave. By the laws of all the Southern States the children follow the condition of the mother.
<name>James</name>	James	William	[MASK] was a tall, full-bodied Negro, whose very countenance beamed with intelligence. Being a mechanic, he had, by his own industry, made more than what he paid his owner; this he laid aside, with the hope that some day he might get enough to purchase his freedom.
<name>William</name>	William	Clotel	The body of [MASK] was picked up from the bank of the river, where it had been washed by the strong current, a hole dug in the sand, and there deposited, without either inquest being held over it, or religious service being performed.
<name>the bull</name>	the bull	Bruin	His horns bore the appearance of having been filed at the tips, and wanted that keen and slashing appearance so common with others of his kith and kin; otherwise it would have been 'all day' with [MASK]--at the first pass, and no mistake.
<name>Eva</name>	Eva	Georgiana	" "Yes," answered he, "I did not know so much about it then." "With great deference to you, papa," replied [MASK], "I don't think that the Bible sanctions slavery.
<name>Harriet</name> (referring to Harriet Tubman)	Harriet (referring to Harriet Tubman)	Clotel	" At first [MASK] feared that it was a plan by which the Negro wished to try her fidelity to her owner; but she was soon convinced by his earnest manner, and the deep feeling with which he spoke, that he was honest.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Clotel	He could feel for [MASK], for he, like her, had been separated from near and dear relatives, and often tried to console the poor woman. One day the quadroon observed to him that her hair was growing out again.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Clotel	[MASK] perceived this, and it gave her unutterable pain. "Tis ever thus with woman's love, True till life's storms have passed; And, like the vine around the tree, It braves them to the last.
<name>Harriet</name> (possible answer could also be <name>Abby</name> or <name>Susan</name>, as the passage is from a conversation between three women abolitionists and it is not specified which one is being referred to)	Harriet (possible answer could also be Abby or Susan, as the passage is from a conversation between three women abolitionists and it is not specified which one is being referred to)	Carlton	" "Now, my dear [MASK], would you really have the Negroes enjoy the same rights with ourselves?" "I would, most certainly. Look at our great Declaration of Independence; look even at the constitution of our own Connecticut, and see what is said in these about liberty.
<name>Harriet</name> (referring to Harriet Tubman, a famous abolitionist and former slave who helped others escape slavery through the Underground Railroad)	Harriet (referring to Harriet Tubman, a famous abolitionist and former slave who helped others escape slavery through the Underground Railroad)	Clotel	With trembling heart the fugitive handed the key of her trunk to the officers. To their surprise, they found nothing but woman's apparel in the box, which raised their curiosity, and caused a further investigation that resulted in the arrest of [MASK] as a fugitive slave.
<name>Columbia</name>	Columbia	Christianity	Our rights are there established, but it is always in connection with our duties. If we neglect the one we cannot make good the other. Our domestic institutions can be maintained against the world, if we but allow [MASK] to throw its broad shield over them.
<name>Uncle Tom</name>	Uncle Tom	Sam	Old master has gone to the slaveholder's rest; He has gone where they all ought to go. [MASK]. "I heard the old doctor say the other night, As he passed by the dining-room door 'Perhaps the old man may live through the night,
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Volney	One bright moonlight evening as she was seated at the window, she perceived the figure of a man beneath her window. At first, she thought it was her master; but the tall figure of the stranger soon convinced her that it was another. Yes, it was [MASK]!
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	George	But neither of them had once thought of a change of dress for [MASK] when he should have escaped, and he had walked but a short distance before he felt that a change of his apparel would facilitate his progress. But he dared not go amongst even his coloured associates for fear of being betrayed.
<name>Mr. Wopsle</name>	Mr. Wopsle	Carlton	" [MASK] complied with the young lady's request, and read aloud the following rare specimen of poetical genius: "MY LITTLE NIG. "I have a little nigger, the blackest thing alive, He'll be just four years old if he lives till forty-five;
<name>Bodacious</name>	Bodacious	Attakapas	"Missing this, the bull turned to the 'about face,' and the bear caught him by the ham, inflicting a ghastly wound. But [MASK] with a kick shook him off, and renewing the attack, went at him again, head on and with a rush.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Crawford	The blood chilled in his young heart as he heard [MASK] tell how, by bartering with the trader, he had bought her for two hundred dollars less than he first asked. His very looks showed that the slave girl had the deepest sympathy of his heart.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Clotel	To have made herself known, would have been a suicidal act; betrayal would have followed, and she arrested. Three days had passed away, and [MASK] still remained in the hotel at which she had first put up; and yet she had got no tidings of her child.
<name>Uncle Tom</name>	Uncle Tom	Carlton	But even all this noise did not drown the singing of a party of the slaves, who were seated near a spring that was sending up its cooling waters. "How prettily the Negroes sing," remarked [MASK], as they were wending their way towards the place from whence the sound of the voices came.
<name>Mr. Tanner</name>	Mr. Tanner	Peter	The next morning, about eight o'clock, [MASK] the gardener came to the jail to see if I had been there the night before, and was informed that I had, and that I had left a little after dark.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sam	"What do you think had best be done for him?" "I think I better bleed him and give him a dose of calomel," returned [MASK]. So to the latter's gratification the master let him have his own way.
<name>him</name>	him	Horatio	She had not looked on [MASK] since she watched him under the shadow of the magnolia, until his barouche passed her in her rambles some months after. She saw the deadly paleness of his countenance, and had he dared to look back, he would have seen her tottering with faintness.
<name>Napoleon</name>	Napoleon	Clotel	A few days after the death of [MASK], the following poem appeared in one of the newspapers: "Now, rest for the wretched! the long day is past, And night on yon prison descendeth at last. Now lock up and bolt!
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Carlton	" "Yes, when they wish. There's some very intelligent and clever chaps among them." "As to-morrow is the Sabbath," said [MASK], "if you have no objection, I will attend meeting with them.
<name>he</name>	he	Devenant	but it was only that affection which we have for one who has done us a lasting favour: it was the love of gratitude rather than that of the heart. We were five weeks on the sea, and yet the passage did not seem long, for [MASK] was so kind.
<name>Shadow</name>	Shadow	Picquilo	They had built a cave on a rising mound in the swamp; this was their home. His name was [MASK]. His only weapon was a sword, made from the blade of a scythe, which he had stolen from a neighbouring plantation.
<name>Undine</name>	Undine	Horatio	The same calm, clear moonlight looked in through the trellis. The vine then planted had now a luxuriant growth; and many a time had [MASK] fondly twined its sacred blossoms with the glossy ringlets of her raven hair.
<name>himself</name>	himself	Sam	The physician having a good business, and a large number of his patients being slaves, the most of whom had to call on the doctor when ill, he put [MASK] to bleeding, pulling teeth, and administering medicine to the slaves.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Huckelby	Slavery is the incubus that hangs over the Southern States." "Yes," interrupted [MASK]; "them's just my sentiments now, and no mistake. I think that, for the honour of our country, this slavery business should stop.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Georgiana	"I think we will walk," said he, at the same time extending his arm to [MASK]. "No," said she; "let's hear them out. It is from these unguarded expressions of the feelings of the Negroes, that we should learn a lesson.
<name>Nat Turner</name>	Nat Turner	George	" Nearly every one present was melted to tears; even the judge seemed taken by surprise at the intelligence of the young slave. But [MASK] was a slave, and an example must be made of him, and therefore he was sentenced.
<name>Uncle Tom</name>	Uncle Tom	Jones	"You see," said [MASK] to the Negroes, as he approached them, you see here's a gentleman that's come to talk to you about your souls, and I hope you 'ill all pay that attention that you ought.
<name>Eli Whitney</name>	Eli Whitney	Huckelby	[MASK] was one morning told that his services would no longer be required. The Negroes, ninety-eight in number, were called together and told that the whip would no longer be used, and that they would be allowed a certain sum for every bale of cotton produced.
<name>Miss Watson</name>	Miss Watson	Sally	"I should tink dat dat gal would not trow hersef away in dat manner," said [MASK]. "She good enough looking to get a house servant, and not to put up wid a fiel' nigger," continued she. "
<name>John</name>	John	Georgiana	In what light would she consider that hypocritical priesthood who gave their aid and sanction to the infamous "Fugitive Slave Law." If true greatness consists in doing good to mankind, then was [MASK] Carlton an ornament to human nature.
<name>Clotelle</name>	Clotelle	Clotel	The young man had just returned from college, and was in his twenty-second year. [MASK] was sixteen, and was admitted by all to be the most beautiful girl, coloured or white, in the city.
<name>John</name>	John	Carlton	Though man has no rights, as thus considered, undoubtedly he has the power, by such arbitrary rules of right and wrong as his necessity enforces." "I regret I cannot see eye to eye with you," said [MASK].
<name>Mr. Oak</name>	Mr. Oak	Peck	Being mechanics, they were let out to greater advantage than to keep them on the farm. However, every Sunday night, [MASK]'s servants, including the bricklayers, usually assembled in the kitchen, when the events of the week were freely discussed and commented on.
<name>the dark ladie</name>	the dark ladie	Clotel	A SLAVE "I promised thee a sister tale Of man's perfidious cruelty; Come, then, and hear what cruel wrong Befell the dark ladie."--Coleridge. LET us return for a moment to the home of [MASK].
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Clotel	" He still loved [MASK]; but he was now becoming engaged in political and other affairs which kept him oftener and longer from the young mother; and ambition to become a statesman was slowly gaining the ascendancy over him.
<name>the visitor</name>	the visitor	Carlton	"My Negroes are well clothed, well fed, and not over worked," said the slaveholder to his visitor, after the latter had been with him nearly a week. "As far as I can see your slaves appear to good advantage," replied [MASK].
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Carlton	"Let's take a walk," said [MASK], as if to turn the conversation. The moon was just appearing through the tops of the trees, and the animals and insects in an adjoining wood kept up a continued din of music.
<name>Mrs. Wiggs</name>	Mrs. Wiggs	Betsy	" "No." "Well, who will you work for?" asked one of the company. "I work for [MASK] and the children, and I have a hard job of it at that," replied the farmer, without a smile.
<name>Mrs. Stowe</name>	Mrs. Stowe	Clotel	You people of the Slave States have no regard for the Sabbath, religion, morality or anything else intended to, make mankind better." Here [MASK] could have borne ample testimony, had she dared to have taken sides with the Connecticut man.
<name>Lucius</name>	Lucius	Sam	On one occasion the old doctor was ill himself, so as to be unable to attend to his patients. A slave, with pass in hand, called to receive medical advice, and the master told [MASK] to examine him and see what he wanted.
<name>coons</name>	coons	Harry	This kind of food, he said, made them eager for their business. Sometimes they would give the dogs meat, but it was always after they had been chasing a Negro." "Were those the dogs you had, papa, to hunt [MASK]?"
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Carlton	The state makes no provision for educating the poor: they are unable to do it themselves, and they grow up in a state of ignorance and degradation. The men hunt and the women have to go in the fields and labour." "What is the cause of it?" inquired [MASK].
<name>none</name>	none	Harrison	Well, then, of course you will go for [MASK]." "No." "Why, don't you mean to work for any of them at the election?" "No." "Well, who will you work for?"
