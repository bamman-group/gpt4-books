<name>Harry</name>	Harry	William	“I don’t know why you’d do this,” she said finally. “[MASK]’s my friend.” “And so you’d go broke—and risk your neck, by the way—for the girlfriend who should have been locked up with him.”
<name>Oy</name>	Oy	Jenny	“I’m sorry.” “Don’t do that!” [MASK] had taken the next Bible herself and by now they had ten piled up in the car. It marked where they’d been in some way, by subtraction, but it also made good camouflage.
<name>Nancy</name>	Nancy	Jenny	The window was open, and [MASK] heard the sound more distinctly—a car engine, straining in its highest gear and seeming to stutter from very slight taps to the gas. It came slowly; there was no sign of lights.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Juan	[MASK] sat across from her, feet up, contentedly paging through Blood in My Eye. “You did say it was urgent?” he asked, his voice not sounding urgent at all. She studied him for a beat before answering.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Juan	She squeezed back through the door. When she found the kitchen light and turned it on her reflection in the window over the sink spooked her. For an instant she thought someone else was outside, peering in. “[MASK]?” cried a voice.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Juan	“Just listen before you say no.” “No! This is your wonderful plan? Are you out of your mind?” “I know it’s not the kind of thing you like to do,” [MASK] went on, seeming unsurprised by her objections.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Jim	[MASK] couldn’t see the driver, but he knew the slowness was no accident.This was someone for him. It was a car he’d never seen, he was sure, although there was nothing distinct about it.
<name>He</name>	He	Pauline	“I’ll go first.” “So you get it?” “There’s not much to get.” “Then you’re ready.” “I’m ready.” [MASK] took a breath and said, “Time.”
<name>Candy</name>	Candy	Sandy	The blinds were up, but the vast room was still pleasantly dim, like a cave. There was an aquarium the size of a coffin against the far wall, making a murmurous sound. He couldn’t see anything in it but rocks. He turned back to the girl, whose name was [MASK].
<name>Oyama</name>	Oyama	Pauline	Her trial began a few months after [MASK]’s, was short and disregarded by the press. But every day the courtroom was full of the Japanese and Filipino and Korean and Chinese faces, the tight-knit people her father had always avoided.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Juan	To her surprise it was [MASK]; he stepped out with a chair and sat down next to her. “What’s so riveting out there?” he asked. “I’m just looking for the first star.”
<name>Max</name>	Max	Juan	Just like you, [MASK]. He’s a miracle worker. He’s discreet, he’s smart, I’m paying him out of my pocket. We need to get this thing going. That editor I told you about is getting very impatient.”
<name>Olivia</name>	Olivia	Jenny	The insult was forgiven. Not long after, standing in the aisle of the hardware store reading down her hst of supplies, [MASK] heard someone say, near the register, “So now we have the privilege of giving the old bitch three dollars to look at her house.
<name>Annie</name>	Annie	Jenny	The odometer still stood at less than halfway to ten thousand. The ashtrays were all still pristine, though there might have been invisible motes in the rugs from [MASK]’s own cigarettes, blown back by the wind as she’d smoked out the window.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Jenny	She and [MASK] should take out an ad like the ones that you saw for the Third World orphans. For a dollar a day you can feed and clothe two fugitives! Help them live on to fight for your rights!
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Pauline	“It just has to cool down. We’ll be fine,” she says. [MASK] smokes enough cigarettes to encircle the spot where they’re parked. On one of these days they see four-foot-tall sandhill cranes rising droopingly out of a field.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Thomas	“He’s the Man,” [MASK] teased. “Naw, he’s a nice man.” “It would be better to work for a black man.” “It would be better to not work at all.”
<name>James</name>	James	William	And this had seemed wonderful, that in the midst of their crisis, in one small respect, they had both understood what to do.Yet the template was limited. Though [MASK]’s letters were more daring than hers were, they still seemed impaired.
<name>Sharon</name>	Sharon	Carol	“Are you?” “I—no, not really. Me and [MASK] are getting divorced. But what the fuck. I didn’t come here to talk about me, if you can believe that. I just wanted to see how you were.”
<name>Blue</name>	Blue	Evan	“Now you’ve seen us,” the one named [MASK] said, and she’d wondered if this was a warning, Now you’ve seen us, and there’s no turning back, but she hadn’t seen them. All of them had been shimmery blotches of color.
<name>Emerson</name>	Emerson	Jim	[MASK] was a stranger, and this was their fault—they had startled awake with their neighbors and friends, and denounced the young man for his rudeness. And then they’d streamed out of Mess Hall 16, not a fraction as angry as they had behaved.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Yvonne	The rainstorm had not slackened at all, and the rich wholesome smell of wet earth, such a strange counterpoint to the gun, billowed into the kitchen.[MASK] suddenly said, “I can’t stand it, I’ve just got to feel it!”
<name>June</name>	June	Sweetheart	He doesn’t know you took off without telling me. He thinks we’ve been in touch all this time. Because he wants me protecting you. Because he loves you. [MASK]. Please. Uncover your face.” He should have been an actor.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Pauline	They turned around to look through the rear windshield and saw the procession of lights streaming forth from the gloom. Each siren screamed as it passed them, so that they could not even hear what they screamed at each other; [MASK] seemed to be saying, “Oh God no!
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jenny	But after all these transient years [MASK] oddly enjoyed, in the context of rootedness, the compactness of her personal effects, the square heap on the royal-blue shag of her folded-up jeans and T-shirts, her paired socks, her sneakers, her hat.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Jim	It was just after this that [MASK] had his first glimpse of his daughter. Not a glimpse that would tell him whether she was in any way malnourished, or drugged, or brainwashed. Not a glimpse of her hair—short or long? he wondered.
<name>Haruki</name>	Haruki	Frazer	“Did I say I had another surprise?” [MASK] said with a show of great cheer. “And you guys, don’t keep me waiting anymore! Why don’t you bring out the pages you’ve got and let me take a look at them.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Juan	When [MASK] finally emerged from the barn he had a long object under his arm which he threw on the grass when he reached them. It was a toy gun—a toy machine gun—which was made out of wood.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Frazer	“I know you wouldn’t.” [MASK] got in his car, slammed the door hard and started the engine, but his window was down and she came to it and looked at the letter, which he’d tossed on the passenger seat.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Jim	[MASK]’s several barely functioning fans feebly stirred the hot air and made a disproportionate noise doing so. The TV volume was all but drowned out. It wasn’t until the next morning, when he opened the paper, that he learned of the other arrest.
<name>Comrade</name>	Comrade	Sister	“I knew the dead comrades, [MASK],” the girl whispered. “There’s still ways you can help.”The girl was one of the dead—or rather, the police would soon learn that three cadre members they thought they had killed were somehow still alive.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jenny	She yelled across the store suddenly and [MASK]’s palms began to tingle with prickly heat, but it was only a summons to a long, lanky boy with a comb in his hair to load the groceries into boxes and get them out to her car.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Pauline	‘“We feel bad if we want to be happy,’” [MASK] reads, and then says, “But it can’t be so selfish. I used to think so, I used to think I was rotten. But is it really so wrong?”
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Pauline	Were they supposed to have certain toppings or something?” “Uh, no. I mean, yeah. One was supposed to be plain. No ketchup or pickle or anything. [MASK] doesn’t like toppings.” “Blech.”
<name>Marilyn</name>	Marilyn	Jenny	Who are on fucking TV every night, [MASK], whose story is wanted by everyone—” Now she’s staring at him, very pale. “My God,” she says. “You’re not talking about who I think you are, are you?”
<name>Jerome</name>	Jerome	Thomas	He was saying things like, “You think all white folks look the same? Bet you’ve seen me before. Or a million dudes like me.” [MASK] laughed. “Where you live, man?”
<name>Jimmy</name>	Jimmy	Jen	“I can hear something rattling in there.” “Don’t shake it. Just deliver it like I told you.” “Fuck, [MASK]. What did you send me? Did you send me one of those things that the roadrunner sends the coyote?”
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Pauline	Although she’d worn the thin gloves that had come in the box, her fingertips still itched and stung. Her eyes were still weeping from fumes. [MASK] had twitched slightly with pain as the bleach began burning her scalp, and now her scalp was erupting with blisters.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Pauhne	When she returned to the front room [MASK] said, blurting it out, “They’ll be all right, won’t they?” “I don’t know,” she said after a moment. “I don’t know what they’re doing.”
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Frazer	Clean house pack call [MASK] need to cars need to get another car maybe after nightfall go back for that car maybe no one but that one man saw have to travel they’ll think it was local not the kind of thing state police local one-off thing ...
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Pauline	By the time he was standing to leave, as sunset began, he had brought them around. They were all laughing, even [MASK]; they were lazily sprawled on the grass in the quickening wind. They had finished their steaks.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Pauline	“Another?” he asked. “I’ll take a whiskey,” [MASK] said. “Rocks?” “Neat. With a little splash of water.” She straightened up, watching. “No, a little more. That’s good.”
<name>He</name>	He	Tom	When he’d started his employment he hadn’t even owned a car; then a sporty brown Gremlin had been advertised on the company bulletin board. [MASK] bought it and tinted its windows, an investment of almost a month’s salary even after his ten percent discount.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Pauline	All they did was cut long rectangles of fabric and sew deep hems at one end for a dowel to run through, but when they were finished it was another improvement the pleasure of which exceeded the purpose it served. “Our beautiful feminist curtains,” [MASK] said.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Alan	[MASK] was one of my boys when I coached at that college I got fired from. He’s a brilliant writer—he’s been my assistant on the last two sports-activist books that I wrote. And he’s a runner.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Pauline	[MASK] talked about her kidnapping: her old comrades grabbing her in her bathrobe, at gunpoint, was so typically masculine, rapacious and violent. It was as if men, even when trying to effect positive change, could only do so in the most backward, masculine way.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Pauline	“You can see him! Why the fuck do you have to not see him?” “Because,” [MASK] said. At last she said, “It just mattered more when I couldn’t see him, and then I did finally see him.”
<name>Malcolm</name>	Malcolm	Frazer	[MASK]’s strange, prominent skull featured a shelf of bone just above the eyebrows that could make him resemble Neanderthal man or a glowering genius, depending on his general expression. She couldn’t decide which he favored right now; his jaw was jutted forward, restlessly working, another tic that betrayed deep anxiety.
<name>Jerome</name>	Jerome	Thomas	You have to go to school.” “You’re just saying what bullshit it is!” “You still have to go. That’s what they expect you to do, as a young black man. Not go to school.” [MASK] considered this a while.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Helen	A person that, under better circumstances, I could imagine as a very close friend. Don’t you think?” And another time: “The whole thing with not knowing your story has gotten kind of hard for [MASK], because she tends to assume the worst.
<name>Steffi</name>	Steffi	William	Feeling as she thought the Christian Reformers might have felt when they seized the Good Book for themselves. Except bombs weren’t inherently good but inherently evil; she and [MASK] had set out with their bombs to expose the real evil of government violence, not to recommend violence to everyone else.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Juan	One night [MASK] said, in the middle of dinner, “We’ll resume combat drills tomorrow. We ought to be in good enough condition. If we aren’t we’ll have to get that way, fast.”
<name>Lila</name>	Lila	Jenny	It was a flat piece of wood so weathered it looked almost silver, with the letters painted on it in black. It wouldn’t be right to say he recognized the handwriting: Rather, he recognized the ability to have unrecognizable handwriting. [MASK] could have been a professional sign painter.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Frazer	She could almost see his calculations: sedate, or confront? Sedate, she was thinking, sedate ... “That’s it,” [MASK] said. “When you can stop acting like a prick you just give me a call.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Yvonne	With what seemed to be her last strength she crept back up the stairs and lay gingerly down on her bed. Some time later she was startled awake by the door to the front room banging open. “It’s too hot,” [MASK] said, from the foot of the stairs.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Thomas	the bartender asked her. “Twenty-five.” “Whoa!” said the boy. The bartender raised her eyebrows. “[MASK] ain’t even sixteen. Don’t believe what he tells you. Why aren’t you at work?” she demanded.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Jenny	and he understood that one significant problem was solved. He would entrust the day-to-day contact to [MASK]. She wasn’t merely the only person he could trust in this way, she was the best he could imagine. He would just have to find her.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Juan	[MASK]’s guerrilla beard was gone, exposing round cheeks and a cleft in his chin. And his hair was cut off—it fell neatly above his ears, and the ears, exposed, stood out alertly. His shirt was tucked in, trousers belted.
<name>She</name>	She	Pauline	Unhooking the chain and moving it aside her palms took on powdery rust. She noticed the small sign she’d painted was gone. In its place was a mass-produced one that said PRIVATE, of about the same size. [MASK] woke as they were moving down the long unlit drive.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Pauline	[MASK] said. “For making cops think you’re a pimp?” “What do you know about pimps? It looks like a car that a surfer would have. And you really can’t see in at all. Doesn’t that seem appealing?
<name>Oedipa</name>	Oedipa	Paulines	IN A MOTEL outside Kingston she bleached [MASK] hair blond, watching the old beet-red dye job and even the new growth of natural brown slowly give up their tints and turn orange, and then yellow, and then a pale yellow closer to white.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Jenny	At some point it had crashed on the floor; [MASK] heard the bright ding of the carriage returning. Compared to those sporadic spasms the tape recording was a constant vague dirge. Someone droned on at length, stopped short, droned again in the same shaky rhythm.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jenny	Now she seems delighted to have [MASK] on the spot. She picks an envelope up off the tea tray and waggles it suggestively. “I knew you had an admirer. From the way he asked questions about you, I could just tell that he’d met you before.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Thomas	She covered the side of her face with her hand. “You know him?” “I don’t know him.” She was trying to subtly speed up, but the car’s solitary presence on the street had caught [MASK]’s attention already.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Juan	The previous morning, her second morning in the house, she had awoken with the dawn light, starving, after eating a bowl of dry cereal for her dinner. Feeling her way into the kitchen, she’d found [MASK] there, hunched under his blanket again.
<name>Connell</name>	Connell	Frazer	[MASK] always cups his hands around the flame and leans near, even when indoors in a place with no drafts. Some men embrace all the retrograde aspects of gallantry because they’ve intuited that to be gallant is to take sexual hold of a woman, however obliquely.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jenny	“This one’s on me,” said the bartender, rapping the bar with his knuckles. A man had come up from the pool table to stand right beside them. “So what are you?” the man demanded of [MASK], leaning hard on his cue.
<name>Holden's</name>	Holden's	Frazers	“I’m sorry,”Juan said, with a terrible calm that dismanded [MASK] own calm completely, “but we are in a state of war, and we cannot be defenseless.There’s no fucking way we’re giving up our guns.”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Pauline	Then she went back in the stable and thrust the wet rag and flashlight at [MASK]. “Put our things in this car. Then get in the Bug and clean off every trace of the blood of your so-called establishment pig. Use the flashlight.
<name>Juan</name>	Juan	Frazer	“I am replacing them.” “With those?”Juan exclaimed. “Not even with these unless you show me you’ve made a real start!” The trio was suddenly silent. “I am helping you,” [MASK] went on, in a quieter voice.
<name>Jonas</name>	Jonas	Jim	They are suddenly silent with terror. It is a winter night, well below freezing. [MASK] is inured to the cold now but sees his breath clouding the air, feels the burn in his throat. Above him he might see the distant pristine Cascade moon.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Helen	This was the change that had prompted them to do something they would never have dreamed of otherwise, and hire a housekeeper/assistant, so that [MASK] could go every day to the tiny Greenwich Village apartment she’d rented for use as a study, to work on her novel.
<name>Sal</name>	Sal	Jenny	When [MASK] turned off the engine they heard hammers tocking briskly, their noise seeming to echo for miles. Besides that the wind, and the voices it snatched. The earth was the color of concrete dust; pale gray, and grainy.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Thomas	“Just kidding around.” “Was he drafted?” “Why?” “ I’m j ust asking.’ ’ [MASK] twisted around in his seat. With another quick glance toward the bar, he fished his cigarettes out of his pocket and gazed down at them.
<name>Arlo</name>	Arlo	Jenny	This thrilled his mother. “Oh, there’s my tree!” she would say. Did [MASK] know that of all of their twenty-four parents, his mother had been the only one to have said she was proud of them?
<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Jenny	Now he feels skinless and broken. He wonders if all his efforts to think like [MASK] are making him into a Jennylike person. But that isn’t fair; she’s not foolish or helpless. Far from it.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Dolly	’You don’t seem to have got very far.” “I ran into delays.” “As I said, I’d prefer not to know what fresh difficulty brings you back here.” [MASK] lowered herself into her favorite armchair and pulled her robe around her shoulders.
<name>Mildred</name>	Mildred	Jenny	“Three hundred fifty,” [MASK] said. “I can’t do any better. If that’s not enough I guess I’ll wait until morning and look in the classified ads.” She sat back in her own chair, heart pounding.
<name>Malcolm</name>	Malcolm	Dick	[MASK]’s specialism was the nineteenth-century American novel but he was really an experimental poet, as yet unpublished, whose heated defense of one of his contemporaries against the assaults of a rival professor was being published, letter by letter, in the journal of the Modern Language Association.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Pauline	At twelve-thirty [MASK] was overcome. “Change the station!” she said. “This is the news station. If they’re going to play it anywhere around here, it’ll be on this station.”
<name>ironic</name>	ironic	ehtist	While all the while, in the shadow of such grand pronouncements, they were harboring FBI agents. Feeling, perhaps, that unlike capitulation to the press this was a worthy crown to their martyrdom, because so [MASK]. Only the innermost circle of agents, the chiefs of their tribe.
<name>Rowan</name>	Rowan	Rob	His expression, while not overtly angry, was sardonic. One corner of his mouth was pinched upward. “So,” he said, reaching her. “They’ve done nothing.” “They’re doing something, [MASK].They finally seem committed to it.
<name>He</name>	He	Frazer	“I have a surprise for you,” he told them. “It’s out in the car.The backseat.You want to go bring it in?” After a long moment the three of them filed out the back door. “Not you,” [MASK] murmured to her.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Jenny	[MASK]’s body, still hoping, leaps up from the table, but her mind knows, and her inner voice echoes the man’s: “Freeze! Put your hands up!” So it happens, at last.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Pauline	but that firm touch to which she’d submitted, the hand on her head, that had made it all real. Across the roof of the car she had seen [MASK]’s head, also clamped by a hand, also next to a car.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Rob	“I’m tired, too. I’ll see you in the morning.” She started upstairs, and he snapped off the kitchen light and followed. “[MASK],” she said warningly. “Just to talk.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Pauline	He spoke confidentially to her, as if she and he were the immediate family and [MASK]’s parents and siblings and cousins some lesser contingent. “There’s so much accumulated expectation and resentment, misunderstanding and disappointment, piled on from way back,” he explained.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Frazer	She and the couple turn out to be kindred spirits, adept in the same obscure language— porte cochere, rococo. The situation worsens for [MASK], because the threesome, elated by their companionship, feel guilty and strive to include him.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Jenny	When she trained her skeptical gaze onto [MASK] again it was scaled back to the usual version, as if they were bickering over their tea. “I suppose you thought of my car because you assume I’d take anything for it. Three hundred dollars!
<name>Yvette</name>	Yvette	Pauline	“You andY both learned to shoot on shotguns, and a handgun’s a whole different creature.” He explained to [MASK] patiently, “You’re small, but you can brace yourself against a shotgun so the kick doesn’t throw you, remember?
<name>Donna</name>	Donna	Pauline	They’d pulled onto the shoulder to study their atlas, afraid they were lost, and then the engine wouldn’t restart. “Okay,” [MASK] said, fighting a cigarette with a trembling hand. “Okay, let’s just think. Try to think.”
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Pauline	Then they both stood awkwardly, like the first guests at a very small party. “I haven’t been in this room since we came up here to get the other bed,” [MASK] offered, after a moment. “There’s not much here,” she said, gesturing.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Carol	From the living room he heard a crash, and then a peal of laughter: [MASK]’s. He swiveled in panic, thinking the lights might come on, and crawled hurriedly back to the living room like a dumb frightened animal.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jenny	She said it as if she’d found [MASK] slaughtering a chicken, or performing some other blood-curdling and difficult task. “Just thinking about it. Don’t worry, I’ll pack soon enough.” “What is that supposed to mean?”
<name>Mice</name>	Mice	Mice	The house was empty and quiet again, as the hills that it lived in flamed red and then faded away and the scalp of the land started showing through denuded trees. [MASK] did their work, with energy and puzzling inconsistency. Why eat soap and not curtains?
<name>Elvis</name>	Elvis	Pauline	The phone calls were a whole year apart. I can’t be sure that the voice was the same. I just can’t believe it was two separate guys and their both calling me was a total coincidence. Sure, nowadays two hundred people a day claim [MASK]
<name>him</name>	him	Pauline	Perhaps this was still why she finally filled up the notepads: for [MASK], not herself. But in the process she slowly recovered; tunneling so long she came back aboveground a vast distance from where she’d last been.
<name>James</name>	James	Pauline	She put down the clippings and fingered the bedsheet, worn and pilled and now damp with her sweat; the night breeze pulsed in through the still-open window, but it no longer chilled her. She watched [MASK] watching her: with satisfaction? with hope?
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Pauline	The downstairs lamp quickly snapped off; its faint glow vanished out of the stairwell. She heard [MASK] rise from the couch, with the same pointless stealth, as if in this house they could hide from each other.
<name>Josephine</name>	Josephine	Pauline	Even history’s most notable women revolutionaries were the helpmeets to more-worshipped men. They’d been dismayed but also electrified to have seen it so clearly; resolved, [MASK] wrote (she kept minutes because she had the best handwriting): Women must assume leadership roles in the revolution.
