<name>Quara</name>	Quara	Tomds	Immature as 1 was, my scent must be working on them. And [MASK]’s healed neck must be working on him. He couldn’t possibly like his growing disabilities—and surely other Humans did not like the way he looked. Humans cared very much how other people looked.
<name>Nikanj</name>	Nikanj	Nikanj	After a moment, he nodded. I put him to sleep. He did not realize it, but I was responsible for strengthening his aversion to [MASK]. No male or female who spent as much time with an ooloi as he had with me would feel comfortable touching another ooloi.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Javier	“We do this now because they left. The elders were afraid we would be invaded. We made more guns and ammunition, and we posted new guards. Many new guards.” “This isn’t really a good place to watch from,” [MASK] said.
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Tomds	You’ll fight so hard, you might win even if the male is much stronger. Or maybe you’ll just make him hurt or kill you." “Then she can’t go,” [MASK] said. “I’ll have to do it alone.”
<name>Lizard</name>	Lizard	Jodahs	“It can’t be you!” he whispered when I let him speak. He remembered a scaly [MASK], like a humanoid reptile. But I could not stay within range of their scent for four days and go on looking that way.
<name>John</name>	John	Nikanj	“You’ll find you won’t like that. But for the sake of her health, I have to do it. Now go ahead. Help her." I lay down alongside the female. I don’t think I could have refused [MASK]’s offer.
<name>another</name>	another	Nikanj	Apart from my Human admixture, the main difference seemed to be that certain genes of mine had activated and caused my metamorphosis. I wondered what might happen if these genes activated in [MASK]. It was mature. Were there other changes it might undergo?
<name>Yeva</name>	Yeva	Tom^s	They’re brother and sister, too. A brother and two sisters, really.” “It would be better, safer to go after people who have already slipped away from your village. Is there a place where such people often meet?” [MASK] sighed.
<name>it</name>	it	Aaor	“I don’t know.” “I won’t go then. I won’t take the chance of being held there. I don’t think [MASK] will either.” “It will. You both will when it finishes its metamorphosis." “No!”
<name>Gregor</name>	Gregor	Aaor	It was starving. I didn’t know what I could do about that, but there must be something. 2 But I had no chance to talk to [MASK] before my second metamorphosis ended. It left home as 1 had.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Nikanj	1 stood with my arms tightly folded and my attention on the now silent male prisoners. I think [MASK] worked quickly for my sake. After a very short time, it stood up and said, “I think she’s inspired you to get control of your abilities.
<name>John</name>	John	Aaor	You should change us and camp here.” “We can’t even see your town from here,” [MASK] protested. “And they can’t see you. If you round that next bend, though, part of our settlement will be visible to you.
<name>Nikanj</name>	Nikanj	Tino	But I would have to encourage him more, and at the same time convince him that his manhood was not threatened. I had heard that males often felt this way about ooloi. I would have to talk to [MASK]. He could help me understand the fear and ease it.
<name>Julie</name>	Julie	Marina	I heard [MASK]’s voice calling me and I realized I’d drifted some distance downstream. I turned and swam back to her. She had not taken off her clothing—short pants that had once been longer and a ragged shirt much too big for her.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Treasure	He had been such a pleasure to touch. Now there was no need to hurry back home. No need to hurry at anything. Two of them. [MASK]. “Move your neck,” I said again. The male moved it, shaking his misshapen head.
<name>Dr. Susan Calvin</name>	Dr. Susan Calvin	Wray	“She seemed to like you very much.” I felt my head and body tentacles flatten to my skin in remembered pleasure. “Very much.” [MASK] laughed. “1 told you it would be sexually precocious—just like the construct males and females.”
<name>Joseph</name>	Joseph	Tomds	Yet his genetic disorder went on causing the growth of more and more useless, dangerous tissue on such finished organs and preventing them from carrying on their function. [MASK] had grown patches of hair on his face overnight. When I touched one of them, he smiled.
<name>AI</name>	AI	Lo	“[MASK] was barely annoyed. It would have survived that war the Humans killed each other with." “It’s part of you and vulnerable to you. You hurt it.” “I know. And I confused it.
<name>they</name>	they	Aaor	She turned her face away from him, rested her head against my shoulder. “I don’t want to do it," she said. “But why should [MASK] die? We know our people will be taken and moved or absorbed or sterilized.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Aaor	They have a dead animal with them, did you notice?” [MASK] nodded miserably. “They’ve been hunting," I said. “Now they’re probably heading home. Although 1 don’t smell anything that could be their home. Do you?”
<name>him</name>	him	Tom&s	1 said nothing. Let her think for a while. She sat silent, frowning, sometimes shaking her head. After a while, she rubbed her face with both hands and moved to sit next to [MASK]. “Shall 1 wake him?” 1 asked.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	1	I almost slept. My guard came back with a dish of cooked beans and some grain and fruit that I did not recognize. A good meal. I thanked him and sent him away because [MASK] was afraid he would speak for me and get into trouble.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Francisco	Sometime later, [MASK] came in. Time woe three more elders with him. From their looks, they were probably the oldest males in die village. They were gray-haired, and their faces were deeply lined. One of them walked with a severe limp.
<name>Alex</name>	Alex	Jesusa	1 had wondered whether they would be able to fmd their way home. They had traveled this route only once, nearly two years before. But [MASK] in particular was at home as soon as the landscape became more vertical than horizontal.
<name>Aro</name>	Aro	Oeka	“No!” “[MASK], you’ve seen it yourself. With a potential mate— even a very unsuitable one—your control is flawless. Without a potential mate, you have no control. You were surprised when I told you you were losing your hair.
<name>Nikanj</name>	Nikanj	Nikanj	When [MASK] brought it to me after several days of reconstruction, it was not yet recognizable. Not like a Human or an Oankali or any construct 1 had ever seen. Its skin was deep gray. Patches of it still glistened with slime.
<name>he</name>	he	Tmo	Yet she and [MASK] went up with us, and absorbed what they could of the complex exchange. The demands of the lowlanders and the people of the ship were surprisingly easy for me to absorb and understand. 1 could handle the intensity and die complexity.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Lo	It was hard not to dare to touch them, not to allow them to touch me. But I would certainly do to some of them what I kept doing to [MASK]—change them, damage them as I kept changing and damaging myself.
<name>Helen</name>	Helen	L	“As long as I don’t develop an illness,” I said. She frowned. “1 wish you could see yourself through my eyes. Deformity is as bad as illness.” I walked away from her. [MASK] had never done that before.
<name>Gregor</name>	Gregor	Joao	It did not seem to edge in slowly as 1 had—though 1 had been so preoccupied with [MASK] that I could easily have missed the signs. It simply went to its pallet and went to sleep. I was the one who touched it and realized that it was in metamorphosis.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Tomds	I turned to face [MASK], and without a word, he lay down beside me, and used his arms to pull me closer to him. When he had kissed me very thoroughly, he said, “Will I always have to wait?"
<name>Akin</name>	Akin	Nikanj	There’s closeness here that I didn’t have with the family I was bom into or with my husband and son.” “But you have Oankali mates other than [MASK]." “You will, too, eventually.
<name>Ooan</name>	Ooan	Aaor	Mated people don’t want that kind of contact with ooloi who aren’t their mates. The reasons are biochemical.” I stopped. “[MASK] smells wrong and tastes wrong to you. I wish 1 could mask that for you, but I can’t.”
<name>the monster</name>	the monster	Hozh	Its skin, very smooth, was protected by a coating of slime. It could not speak or breathe air or make any sound at all. It had attracted [MASK]’s attention by crawling up the bank and forcing part of its body out of the water.
<name>he</name>	he	Jesusa	For me it meant that soon [MASK] would not want to leave me, would not be able to leave me for more than a few days at a time. It worked both ways, of course. Soon 1 would not be able to stand long separation from her.
<name>Nikanj</name>	Nikanj	Joao	“No male or female could regenerate your leg,” I told [MASK]. “I am ooloi.” It was as though the air between us became a crystalline wall—transparent, but very hard. 1 could not reach him through it anymore.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Tino	“And she’s afraid. But something is wrong about this. Her first screams were false. She was not afraid then.” “If she’s being hurt now, that’s enough!” [MASK] said.
<name>Magneto</name>	Magneto	Yedik	“At least, not this kind of deliberate, controlled changing. I wish it didn’t bother other people. I’ve never deformed plants or animals the way people said 1 might.” “Just people,” [MASK] said quietly.
<name>Paulie</name>	Paulie	Aaor	“That was then! They don’t have to kill animals and eat them now!” [MASK] sounded petulant and miserable. It brushed away my sensory arm when 1 reached out to it, then changed its mind and grasped the sensory arm in its strength hands.
<name>Mount Everest</name>	Mount Everest	Santos	“I know. I heard. And 1 still inherit [MASK].” “Use his mind and push his body hard. This trip should do that. You should start down now, too.” “All right.”
<name>Minerva</name>	Minerva	Francisco	We could persuade them to do what they knew they really should do. “You’ll live with your mates,” [MASK] said above much muttering. “Most of us accept that. But wherever you live, you will be guarded. You must be.”
<name>Akin</name>	Akin	Aaor	It was best for us to die on a ship or in one of our towns. Our substance would be safely absorbed into the larger organism. If it were not absorbed, the Oankali organelles in it would find things to do on their own. [MASK] was brought in by young guards.
<name>John</name>	John	Jesusa	Even the ones who choose union with us will be directed to other mates. Mates who are not accidents.” “None of them will accept union,” [MASK] said. “I know them. 1 know what they believe.”
<name>Mother</name>	Mother	Nikanj	When they killed even to save life, they died a little themselves. I knew all this because it was as much a part of me as it was of them. Life was treasure. The only treasure. [MASK] was the one who had made it part of me.
<name>the speaker's interlocutor or the person being referred to</name>	the speaker's interlocutor or the person being referred to	Francisco	It pulled its mouth into something less than a smile. “You were right about being shot. I don’t want to go through it again.” “Where are your mates?” “At their home not far from here—under guard." I faced [MASK] again.
<name>him</name>	him	Aaor	“His body told you. His every look, his reactions, his touch, his scent. He never stopped telling you what he wanted. And since he was the sole focus of your attention, you gave him everything he asked for.” It lay down beside [MASK].
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Nikanj	She stared at the destruction for a moment, then turned away and went to the edge of the garden clearing. There, she stood with her back to us, her body very straight. 1 thought [MASK] would go to her, offer comfort.
<name>Diem</name>	Diem	Tomds	“Everyone said you two were dead,” one guard told diem. “Some hoped they were dead,” another voice said softly. “Better them than all of us.” “No one will die because of us,” [MASK] said.
<name>Elaida</name>	Elaida	Francisco	Of course. 1 shook my head. Someone in the group of elders groaned. “Is he all right?” I asked. “Our guards heard him arguing with someone in your companion’s party,” [MASK] said.
<name>Humanity</name>	Humanity	Oankali	One of my brothers was completely cut off from the family and from [MASK] and construct companionship during his metamorphosis. He reacted to his unrelated, all-Human companions by losing all visible traces of his own Human heritage. He survived all right.
<name>humans</name>	humans	Oankaii	I could only do this by biting through the lianas in a way that would have disturbed the resisters, so I was glad they could not see me. A resister had said to me years before that we constructs and [MASK] were supposed to be superior beings, but we insisted on acting like animals.
<name>that</name>	that	Aaor	“She minds,” he said. “She feels trapped and betrayed. I mind that.” “I know. I’m sorry. I was more afraid of losing you than you can imagine.” “I can see [MASK],” he said.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Aaor	It focused on me with a startlingly quick movement. It was as tight as a fist inside. “[MASK], there are hundreds of other Humans down there. You’ll have a life. Be careful who you give it to.
<name>Nikanj</name>	Nikanj	Nikanj	1 wasn’t shy or afraid, but when I thought of going to her, I felt first drawn, then . . . almost repelled. Finally there was my ooloi parent, [MASK]. It would tell me to go to one of my same-sex parents—one of my fathers.
<name>Wanda</name>	Wanda	Jesusa	“I don’t understand.” “1 know. It has to do with your being with me, letting me heal you, letting me sleep with you. You’ll feel . . . drawn to be with [MASK] and me and strongly repelled by others.
<name>she</name>	she	Jesusa	What to do? They would kill me before I could speak. They would kill me as soon as they reached me. If I went into the area where [MASK] was confined, they might kill her, too. I reached for the two guards and forced them conscious.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Jesusa	I meant to die rather than see it again. You both know that.” I nodded. [MASK] made no move at all. She watched him. “Yet I love those people,” he said. “I don’t want to do this to them.
<name>The Mule</name>	The Mule	Nikanj	“Not yet,” 1 admitted. “[MASK] has avoided sending word to the ship or to any of the towns.” “Because it hoped we would do just what we’re doing." I nodded. “It would not ask either of you.
<name>Gregor</name>	Gregor	Nikanj	My Human mother came in, looked at [MASK] and me, then walked over to me and took my hands. No one had said anything aloud, but she knew something was wrong. She certainly knew that 1 was in metamorphosis. She had seen that often enough.
<name>Mr. Wolfshiem</name>	Mr. Wolfshiem	Nikanj	1 had begun to feel like one of the dormant volcanoes high in the mountains beyond die forest—like a thing that might explode anytime, destroying whatever happened to be nearby. “There is something that you must be aware of, though,” [MASK] said.
<name>humans</name>	humans	Oankali	My only salvation was the certainty that they would not abandon me and the knowledge that this, uncomfortable as it was, was normal. It would be the same if I were being cared for by a pair of [MASK] or a pair of constructs.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Aaor	The rainy season was just ending when the four of us prepared to leave camp. [MASK] was strong again—able to walk all day and live on whatever it ran across. And if we slept with it every two or three nights, it could hold its shape.
<name>John</name>	John	Joao	“No one will guard you,” I told [MASK]. “You are not a prisoner. But I have to monitor your leg. If you leave before the regeneration is complete, before I make certain the growth process had stopped, you could wind up with a monstrous tumor.
<name>robot</name>	robot	Oankali	Left alone in our houses, these Humans were prisoners until some construct, [MASK], or mated Human freed them. Thus, they had been given first a guest house, then a guest area. In that area they had built their dead houses of cut wood and woven thatch.
<name>ET</name>	ET	Aaor	He had been killed by people like the resisters who had shot me. [MASK] came up and stood close so that it could link with me. It was intensely curious about the female. The female stared at it with equal curiosity, but spoke to me.
<name>Zaphod</name>	Zaphod	Jdahya	Its male mate, [MASK], was of an ordinary size. The placement of his sensory tentacles gave him an oddly Human look. They hung from his head like hair. They were placed on his face in a way that could be mistaken for Human eyes, ears, nose.
<name>you</name>	you	Nikanj	“It told me that.” “Good. Because if it hadn’t, I would have. It needs you more than [MASK] ever needed me.” “You want me to stay with it.” “Very much.” “I’m afraid.
<name>her</name>	her	Jesusa	He was the one 1 had touched and studied. He let me take the machete from his hand and put it aside. I already had several body tentacles linked into his nervous system. I put him to sleep so that I could take care of [MASK] before she awoke.
<name>AI</name>	AI	Lo	I got up from my platform as soon as I could and collected dead wood to sleep on. [MASK] ate the wood. It was not intelligent enough to reason with—would not be for perhaps a hundred years. But it was self-aware.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Jesusa	Our work was never finished. “Why does it always feel so disgusting?” [MASK] demanded after a long session. We had washed. Now three of us shared a meal—something we weren’t able to do very often. “Two reasons,” 1 said.
<name>Drizzt</name>	Drizzt	Ahajas	“Why did you attack us?” she asked, sitting down in front of him. The male stared at her, seemed to examine her very carefully with his eyes. Finally he reached out and touched a sensory tentacle on her arm. [MASK] allowed this.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Santos	“1 figured it out, and I don’t mind.” “I’ll do experiments when my mates’ lives are not at stake. Until we’re away from this place, [MASK], try to be quiet unless you have something useful to say.”
<name>them</name>	them	Jesusa	Now I know you never will." I used his muscles to move us both close against [MASK]. There, with me wedged between them, the two could sleep and I could rest and take a little more of their dinner. They wouldn’t feel it.
<name>Murphy</name>	Murphy	Nikanj	There it could be watched, and any damage it did could be spotted and corrected quickly. On the ship, its every move could be monitored. On Earth, it might do great harm before anyone noticed. But [MASK] would not allow me to be sent away.
<name>Tate</name>	Tate	Nikanj	I had nothing between my legs anymore. No one could see me naked and mistake me for male—or female. 1 was an ooloi subadult, and I would be one for years—or perhaps only for months if [MASK] was right about the speed of my maturing.
<name>She</name>	She	Jodahs	So are you. You’ve said you want to stay.” “Yes, but—” “Something is not right. [MASK] sleeps with us and heals us and pleasures us—and asks only for the opportunity to go on doing these things.”
<name>Treeya</name>	Treeya	Tomis	“I don’t know if 1 can do that,” she said. “You’re with me now.” I lay down and moved close against [MASK] so that all the sensory tentacles on his side of my body could reach him.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Aaor	“Yes.” It focused on me, seemed to expect me to say more. I kept quiet. [MASK] broke the silence. "You can’t walk, can you?" it said in Spanish. “We’ll have to carry you.”
<name>Lilith</name>	Lilith	Tomfis	It’s true that our people wiO think badly of us when they find out that we’ve joined the Oankali. But they will find out eventually, no matter what.” “They’ll kill us if they get the chance,” [MASK] said.
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Nikanj	It damaged one of her kidneys and gave her a great deal of pain, but her life was in no danger. Her improved body would have healed quickly even without [MASK]’s help, since the arrow was not poisoned.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jesusa	It could only have been reflex that caused one of them to fire his gun. The bullet glanced off one rock wall and spent itself against another. And suddenly, everywhere, there were voices. [MASK] was so close. ... But there was no time.
<name>Nikanj</name>	Nikanj	Nikanj	I had to touch it sometimes to rouse it. It was as though it were lost within itself, and only surfaced when we were in contact. It rarely spoke. When we were ready to go, [MASK] stood between my Oankali parents to give me final advice and to say goodbye.
<name>Them</name>	Them	Ahajas	They smelled of the powder they used to shoot. They also smelled terrified. They were being held by the people they feared most. They struggled desperately. One of them wept and cursed and stank more than the others. This was one of those held by [MASK].
<name>Edmund</name>	Edmund	Jesusa	[MASK] asked. “Leave my family?” “If you were as I am. If you had no family.” My mother did not answer for a long time. She sighed finally. “I don’t know how to answer that.
<name>AI</name>	AI	Oankali	But you’re . . . we’re strangers." “Are we? Not really. Not after what we’ve shared. I don’t think one of your priests would make us a marriage ceremony, but [MASK] and constructs don’t have much of a ceremony.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Tehkorahs	1 think people like him eased things for me. They made Earth exile feel less objectionable to the truly frightened people who wanted me safely shut away on the ship. “You know I’ll take care of the female,” [MASK] said.
<name>John</name>	John	Tomds	He had sat down beside me to rest. Now he became alert again. “[MASK],” I said softly. He glanced at me. “You won’t feel comfortable about letting them get close to you or letting them surround you.
<name>Ysabeau</name>	Ysabeau	Jesu	With my free sensory arm, 1 touched the skin of his face. “She’s all right,” I made myself say. “Wait.” Perhaps he believed me. Perhaps the expression on [MASK]-sa’s face reassured him.
<name>Bella</name>	Bella	Marina	1 could live five times that long—unless 1 mated with someone like [MASK]. Then 1 would live only as long as I could keep her alive. “If she were younger, I would persuade her myself,” I said.
<name>He</name>	He	Santos	I did not shout with laughter. Laughter would have made the elders even more intensely suspicious than they were. But within myself, I howled. [MASK] was making up for his error. He knew exactly what he was doing.
<name>her</name>	her	Jesusa	“There’s no one around,” he said. “And no house that I can see.” “They didn’t want to be easily visible from the river,” I said. I detached myself from [MASK] and examined her visually. No new tumors.
<name>Wang Lung</name>	Wang Lung	Aaor	“I’m tired,” she said after a while. “Does anyone care if I sleep?” 1 cleared some ground for her and spread a piece of Lo cloth on it. “You two are children, aren’t you?” she asked [MASK].
<name>Rose</name>	Rose	Jodahs	“[MASK], what will happen if someone tries to have sex with me?” I shook my head. “You’ll fight. You won’t be able to help fighting. You’ll fight so hard, you might win even if the male is much stronger.
<name>Mercy</name>	Mercy	Nikanj	[MASK] went to the bloody, unconscious Human woman and lay down beside her. The woman had been beaten about the face, and from her scent, two males had recently had sex with her. I was too involved with my own healing to detect anything else.
<name>Akin</name>	Akin	Ahajas	“Shall we find mates for you?” I asked. He looked at me, then did something very Oankali. He turned and walked away. He walked quickly, would have gone back to the steep road and up to the village if [MASK] had not spoken.
<name>Speaker</name>	Speaker	Tomds	I felt it touch me once more with a sensory arm, then draw me to it and walk me over to [MASK], who was making a pack of the Lo cloth hammock and the other things my parents had given me.
<name>Lilith</name>	Lilith	Jesusa	[MASK]'s voice shook and she paused for a moment. When she began again, the quiver was gone. “I thought that all ooloi had four arms—two with bones and two without.” “Strength arms and sensory arms,” 1 said.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jesusa	[MASK] won’t either. My family will understand that. And no one will touch you— except the children. You won’t mind their touch.” He frowned, gave me a longer look. “I don’t understand.” “1 know.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Santos	I had emptied it and thrown it off the mountain. Then I awoke the man. Seeing me alarmed him, but he never once reached toward the hiding place of the gun. “What’s your name?” I asked him. “[MASK].”
<name>Crazy</name>	Crazy	Joao	The first one 1 met." “And he loves you.” “As you said once: pheromones.” “At first, no doubt. By now, he loves you.” “. . . yes.” “Like [MASK].
