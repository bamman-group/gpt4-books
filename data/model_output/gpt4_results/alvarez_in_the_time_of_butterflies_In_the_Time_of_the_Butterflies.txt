<name>sister</name>	sister	Nelson	he added when he saw the excited look on my face. But you know why that look was there? I’ll tell you. My [MASK] would be in school in the capital until the very end of June, out of harm’s way.
<name>Cleofilas</name>	Cleofilas	Olga	Two divorced mujeronas trying to catch up with what our children call the modem times. With her I can talk over these things. I’ve asked her, what does she think. “I’ll tell you what I think,” [MASK] says.
<name>Juan</name>	Juan	Delisa	He smiled. lines deepened on either side of his mouth. “A man doesn’t know if another man is handsome,” he said at last. I found a way around that by invoking his wife. “Would [MASK] say gringos are good-looking?”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Lio	Yes, years after she had last seen [MASK], he was still a presence in her heart and mind. Every time she went along with some insane practice of the regime, she felt his sad, sober eyes accusing her of giving in.
<name>dog</name>	dog	Nelson	Like I said, it’d been thirteen years and I hadn’t borne fruit. “Let me go in there and see what I can find,” he said, leading me by the hand into our bedroom. Our [MASK] grinned.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Lio	She shut her eyes tight and wished blindly that everything would turn out all right. One night not long after that, [MASK] told them that as soon as his contact in the capital could arrange for asylum, he and several others would be going into exile.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sister	“I do, [MASK], I pray at all times to know His will so it can be done.” She nodded. “We have noticed from the first how seriously you take your religious obligations. Now you must listen deeply in case He is calling.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Minerva	Sunday, February 24 Little Book, The whole school went to the Little Park of the Dead today [MASK] and I had a chance to talk and she told me everything. Now I am worried to death again. I swear my older sister will be the death of me!
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jaimito	She told herself to keep that in mind. No one answered her knock at the rectory, although she kept coming back every half hour, all morning long. In between times, she idled in shops, remembering [MASK]’s look that morning, feeling her resolve draining away.
<name>Mrs. Dalloway</name>	Mrs. Dalloway	Dedfi	[MASK] had appeared with her shears to work on the hedge and keep her eye on “things.” Whenever she didn’t like my tone, she would clip the crown of thorns violently, scattering a spray of leaves and red petals in the air.
<name>midnight</name>	midnight	June	When it was almost [MASK], he finally confided in me. “They’re expecting it this coming month,” he whispered. “The invasion, yes!” he added when he saw the excited look on my face. But you know why that look was there?
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Papd	Several days ago, I had driven out to the yellow house and found it all boarded up. Of course! [MASK] hadn’t broken with this woman but merely moved her off the grounds and into town. I sat, facing forward, not saying a word.
<name>Orwell</name>	Orwell	Llo	A heavy fine was now imposed on anyone who wore khaki trousers and shirts of the same color. It was against the law now to carry your suit jacket over your arm. [MASK] was right, this was an absurd and crazy regime. It had to be brought down.
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	B.	First, I told her my secret about [MASK] and she laughed and said how far ahead of her 1 am. She says she has not been kissed for years! I guess there are some bad parts to being somebody everybody respects.
<name>Mate</name>	Mate	Minerva	I said, [MASK], we’re already half-starved, what more do you want? She held my hands and said, Then do what you think is right, Mate. Of course, I ended up on a hunger strike, too.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Trujillo	“Go ahead,” he says, eyeing me closely. “Highest number wins.” I shake the dice in my hand for all they’re worth. I roll a double and look up at [MASK], trying to keep the glee from my face.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Dede	[MASK] shook her head, remembering. “I got to thinking about it, and I decided to put in half. It wasn’t all that much," she added when she saw my face. I was a little hurt not to be included in this charitable act.
<name>Jennifer</name>	Jennifer	Minerva	Fourteen going on fifteen, she had finally outgrown her dolls and was two, three, who knows, ten years away from her own babies. (The way young women wait these days, look at [MASK]!)
<name>Don</name>	Don	Mirabal	I did not want to be associated with the issue of a campesina who had had no respect for the holy banns of matrimony or for the good name of [MASK]. I nodded towards the garden where no one could overhear our talk.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Patria	The sky was low with clouds, a storm coming. On this lonely mountain road, I felt sorry for him. “What do you say?” I asked the others. We were evenly divided. I said yes, Mate said no, [MASK] said whatever.
<name>Roberto</name>	Roberto	Lio	We are now the playground of the Caribbean, who were once its killing fields. The cemetery is beginning to flower. “Ay, [MASK],” I say it again. I follow his gaze around the room. Most of the guests here are young.
<name>My</name>	My	Jaimito	All eight pardoned prisoners were either women or minorsl My Nelson had only turned eighteen a few weeks ago in prison. Surely, he still counted as a boy? “My God, here’s something else,” [MASK] went on.
<name>Macario</name>	Macario	Johnny	There was a bunch of them already waiting in the interrogation room, tall fat [MASK] with his Hitler mustache. The one called Can-dido with the curly hair. Then a bug-eyed one that kept cracking his knuckles to make the sound of breaking bones.
<name>Molotov cocktails</name>	Molotov cocktails	Nipples	Our mission was to effect an internal revolution rather than wait for an outside rescue. It was on this very Formica table where you could still see the egg stains from my family’s breakfast that the bombs were made. [MASK], they were called.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Dedd	She herself wasn’t sure what. So when she saw her three sisters coming down the path that afternoon, she felt pure dread. It was as if the three fates were approaching, their scissors poised to snip the knot that was keeping [MASK]’s life from falling apart.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Minou	Absently, my hand travels to my foam breast and presses gently, worrying an absence there. “Mi amor,” 1 hear [MASK] say in the background, and I feel goose bumps all up and down my arms. She sounds so much like her mother.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Thursday	Our spirits were so high with the good news we couldn’t wait for [MASK] to tell the men. The night before, we were almost festive as we rolled our hair in the bedroom so it would curl for our men the next day.
<name>mother</name>	mother	Mamita	“Look what the hens left me,” he said each time. His children screamed with delight. Finally, the hens were out of view and the children were sent along with the maid to tell their [MASK] to bring over a cafecito for the seflorita.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Manolo	A zinc roof would be so nice when it rained. What a big yard for her garden and that long storage shed in back sure would come in handy. The show was lost on [MASK], though. Soon after he unpacked the car, he took off.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Patria	If you didn’t let yourself think what this place was, you could almost see it in a promising light. Tentatively, [MASK] brought up the topic. “Have you been told anything about being moved back?”
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Minerva	Not that my stomach needs an excuse for rejecting that watery paste. (What are those little gelatin things I sometimes bite down on?) Saturday, March 26 (65 days) We just had our “little school,” which [MASK] insists on every day, except Sundays.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Minerva	Not for myself but for those I loved. My sisters—[MASK], Mate—I was sick sometimes with fear for them, but they lived at a distance now, so I hid the sun with a finger and chose not to see the light all around me.
<name>Adrian</name>	Adrian	Lio	She had never known an enemy of state before. She had assumed such people would be self-serving and wicked, low-class criminals. But [MASK] was a fine young man with lofty ideals and a compassionate heart. Enemy of state?
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Manolito	So I added, “I’d love to take care of my little godson here!” [MASK] smiled and came readily to my arms. How delicious to hold him like my own baby five months ahead of time.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Tia	July 3 Diary, I know you have probably thought me dead all these months. But you must believe me, I have been too busy for words. In fact, I have to finish writing down [MASK]’s recipe on a card so I can start in on my thank-you notes.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Rufino	[MASK] leaned against the back of the Jeep, his arms crossed. Every so often, he’d look up at the sky—checking the time. “I think maybe I will have a beer,” I said at last.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	LIo	And then, I remember them in the pocket of the lining, [MASK]’s letters! All the way home, I keep going over and over them as if I were an intelligence officer marking all the incriminating passages. On either side of me, my sisters are snoring away.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Mate	All the way down in the car we rented with a driver, we were giddy with anticipation. [MASK] told some of her favorite riddles we all pretended not to know so she could have the pleasure of answering them herself.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Sister	“I’m not sad, [MASK],” I said when I had regained some composure. “These are tears of joy and hope that He will make His will known to me.” “He will,” she assured me. “Listen at all times.
<name>Emmett</name>	Emmett	Ded6	“Men’s business,” he always says. That’s what he’s getting ready to do right now. “You be back before it’s dark.” He scowls. This is the way [MASK] knows he’s granted them permission—when he begins talking of their return.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Dede	[MASK] took out the letter from her pocket and stared at the poorly sealed envelope. She toyed with the flap and it came easily undone. Slipping the letter out, she read haltingly, telling herself after each paragraph she would stop.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Minerva	The OAS Peace Committee comes this Friday. Only one prisoner from each pavilion will be interviewed. The head guards were given the choice. And they picked me. [MASK] says it’s because they don’t think I’ll complain. And you have to, she says.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Pedrito	Or so it seemed for eighteen years. My boy grew into a man, my girl long and slender like the blossoming mimosa at the end of the drive. [MASK] took on a certain gravity, became an important man around here.
<name>Ove</name>	Ove	Pushkin	[MASK]? What kind of a name is that?” I’m summoned to help since the old man can’t read what I wrote. When I finish, the suspicious officer points to the old man, who is nodding away at the names I’ve read off.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Minerva	Fair enough, she says, fair enough. Saturday, August 6 [MASK] has asked me a dozen times what happened. A dozen times I’ve told her and the others the story. Rather, I’ve tried to keep up with their questions.
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Jaimito	Once the goat was a bad memory in our past, that would be the real revolution we would have to fight: forgiving each other for what we had all let come to pass. We made the trip to the capital in two cars. [MASK] and I rode down in the pickup.
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Lio	He understood it was too big a step for me at the moment. Some day in the future, maybe. He could only hope. It seemed suddenly that I’d missed a great opportunity. My life would have been nobler if I had followed [MASK].
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Rufino	I stayed out back with my sisters, and [MASK], standing proud beside them, holding on to the coffins whenever we hit a bump. People came out of their houses. They had already heard the story we were to pretend to believe.
<name>Marmee</name>	Marmee	seflorita	“You are right, [MASK]. Look at me. I never had a chance.” She holds out her empty hands, then looking at her eldest, she adds, “I want better for my girls.”
<name>Lucía</name>	Lucía	Dede	She was becoming too dangerous, the secret heroine of the whole nation. At the pharmacy, in church, at the mercado, [MASK] was being approached by well-wishers. “Take care of our girls,” they would whisper. Sometimes they would slip her notes.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Hilda	She keeps giving [MASK] little booklets to read that will explain everything. I’ve seen what happens to those little booklets the minute our principal turns her back. The nuns have let her get away with her fresh ways for a while, but today, they finally put their foot down.
<name>Orwell</name>	Orwell	Manolo	[MASK] is so worried, he has tapped out a communique that has come all the way down the line. The comrades had his permission to work on that book. There is nothing in it but information the SIM had already collected after months of tortures.
<name>Phaedrus</name>	Phaedrus	Minerva	(God, it seems like I’ll always have a [MASK] by my side being a better person than I am.) Anyhow, I’ve got to memorize this diagram before we bum the master. 'frffcries Vfhto rnlnttt h^rj. completes turn.}
<name>Camila</name>	Camila	Ded£	There is a veritable racket of gratitude on the other end, and [MASK] has to smile at some of the imported nonsense of this woman’s Spanish. “I am so compromised,” she is saying, “by the openness of your warm manner.”
<name>Sugar</name>	Sugar	Balbina	Even [MASK] knew something was up and came and sat right in front of me so she could watch my mouth. I spoke real slow for her to understand that we were talking about love, love among us women. There is something deeper.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Patria	That’s when I remember. “Ay, [MASK], my purse. I left it at the table.” We run back to get it, but can’t find it anywhere. “Probably somebody already took it in. They’ll send it to you.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Dede	Even now, [MASK] hears her sister, reciting that poem she wrote in jail, her voice raspy with the cold she never got rid of that last year. And the shades of night begin to fall, and the traveler hurries home, and the campesino bids his fields farewell....
<name>She</name>	She	Dede	She wishes she had gone through the house and shut the doors to the bedrooms. “No, I mean, where are you in the sequence, the youngest, the oldest?” So the woman has not read any of the articles or biographies around. [MASK] is relieved.
<name>Mildred</name>	Mildred	Minerva	We’ve talked openly about it, and I can’t say I really miss it, but some of the girls are ready to scream, they want a man so. And, I should add, it’s not just the dubious “ladies” saying this. [MASK] is the biggest surprise of all.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Mate	“If you gave me a peso for every premonition, dream, admonition we’ve been told this month, we’d be able to—” “Buy ourselves another set of purses.” [MASK] held hers up and nodded for me to hold up mine.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Dede	The problem is other people confusing things.” The problem is when I open my eyes and see for myself, [MASK] was thinking. But she was too shaken by the night’s events and the long week of indecision to contradict him.
<name>Carajo</name>	Carajo	Dede	I’m thinking. He has got himself his young nurse wife for his old age. I put out my hand, just a reception line habit, I guess. And this man reaches out both hands and clasps mine. “[MASK], caramba, don’t you
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Noris	I asked for a basin for the baby’s bath, and told [MASK] she had to do something about that hair in her eyes. Mate and I moved into a front room with the crib for both our babies.
<name>John</name>	John	Jaimito	I didn’t even ask him why. Did I already guess? I rushed back into the house, into our bedroom, threw open the closet, yanked my black dress off its hanger, ripping the right sleeve, waking [MASK] with my piteous crying.
<name>John</name>	John	Galindez	He sent agents offering him a lot of money for it—$25,000, I’ve heard—but [MASK] said no. Next thing you know, he’s walking home one night, and he disappears. No one has seen or heard from him since.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Rufino	The one time we had stopped here to stretch our legs the whole little village had gathered, offering to sell us anything we might want to buy. “Things are bad,” the villagers complained, looking up towards the big house. [MASK] pulled over and rolled up the side flaps.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Dede	[MASK] catches my eye, smiling only after a lag of a second, for we have to seem pleased. She touches her glass and gives me the slightest nod. Don’t drink anything you are offered, the gesture reminds me. We’ve heard the stories.
<name>She</name>	She	Dede	He’s told me he’ll have to leave me if I get mixed up in this thing.” There, she’d said it. [MASK] felt the hot flush of shame on her face. She was hid- mg behind her husband’s fears, bringing down scorn on him instead of herself.
<name>Camila</name>	Camila	Dede	“No, no, I wasn’t throwing you an indirecta'.’ [MASK] laughs, motioning the woman to sit back down. “We have a few more minutes.” The interviewer perches at the edge of her chair as if she knows the true interview is over.
<name>Marmee</name>	Marmee	Minerva	I better stop till I get over my emotions. Wednesday, in a hurry My dearest Little Book, Oh my dearest, [MASK] asks if I’m ready to hand you over. I say, give me a minute to explain things and say goodbye.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sinita	All around the room, sleepy girls were clapping away in their slippers towards the crowded basins in the washroom. [MASK] grabbed her towel and soap dish from her night table and joined the exodus. As I came fully awake, I felt the damp sheet under me.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Minerva	You are so pretty with a mother of pearl cover and a little latch like a prayerbook. I will have such fun writing on your tissue-thin pages. [MASK] says keeping a diary is also a way to reflect and reflection deepens one’s soul.
<name>Father</name>	Father	Pefta	We could spot them easily. They were the ones who knelt with their butts propped on the pew seats and looked about during the consecration. I caught sight of [MASK] in the back of the church, no doubt taking note of repeaters like me.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Manolo	“Nice poetry.” I laughed to lighten the difficult moment. I had such a hard time saying goodbye. “You’re not going back tonight?” [MASK] looked shocked at the idea. “It’s too late to start out.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Camila	And quickly 1 head back, a moth attracted to that marvelous light. I tuck her in bed and tum off her light and stay a while and talk in the dark. She tells me all the news of what [MASK] did today.
<name>Bep</name>	Bep	Dinorah	Tuesday morning, June 28 (a bad night) I couldn’t sleep all night for how worked up 1 was about the rumors. Then to top it off, the stench kept everyone else up, too. We’re all angry at [MASK] for going in the bucket.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Dede	“We won’t be coming back until late afternoon. I hope that won’t inconvenience you very much?” he apologized. The man was astonishingly courtly. “Not at all,” [MASK] assured him. She could just be dropped off at the church.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Magdalena	I try to be lighthearted, but it takes such effort. It’s as if I am so deep inside myself, 1 can’t come to the surface to be with anyone. The easiest to be with is [MASK].
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jaimito	I believe the woman should be asked first.” That’s when they heard the alerting little cough from the back of the car. She and [MASK] looked at each other in shock. “Who’s there?”
<name>Miranda</name>	Miranda	Ded6	The most embarrassing part, she admitted, was that this made her start feeling that way right there in the middle of the prison hall surrounded by guards. [MASK] sat by, watching our preparations with displeasure. She had gotten into the habit of staying over the nights before our visits.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Minerva	She could have gotten a release, too, since she’s pregnant—yes! Those two are not waiting until she’s done. But [MASK] said there was no way she was going to let all her companeras endure this cross without carrying her share.
<name>Pepe</name>	Pepe	Alberti	We dance several sets, and sure enough, as the campesinos say, Un clavo saca otro clavo. One nail takes out another. The excited rhythm of [MASK]’s “Fiesta” overwhelms the pulsing throb of my headache.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Fela	I’ll sprinkle them all over the letter is what I’ll do. What would happen if I put the name in my right shoe? I ask [MASK]. The right foot is for problems with someone you love. So, I’m walking around doing a double spell,
<name>Delores</name>	Delores	Dede	“It’s still 1960 for you,” she concludes. “But this is 1994, [MASK], 1994!” “You’re wrong,” I tell her. “I’m not stuck in the past, I’ve just brought it with me into the present.
<name>Maria</name>	Maria	Minerva	Five years and a fine of five thousand pesos for each of us. [MASK] just threw her head back and laughed. And of course, I bowed mine and cried. [pages tom out] Wednesday, June 15 (I’ve decided to stop counting—it's just too depressing!)
<name>Stronghold</name>	Stronghold	Berto	I confess I didn’t show her his last one. It’s not that it was mushy, but I felt sort of shy about it. [MASK] wrote so sympathizingly about my homesickness and signed himself, “your Stronghold.” I do like the sound of that.
<name>Lucifer</name>	Lucifer	Manolito	1 ached for him even more without [MASK] in my arms to stanch the yearning. Next thing I knew, His Kingdom was coming down upon the very roof of that retreat house. Explosion after explosion ripped the air. The house shook to its very foundation.
<name>Giuliano</name>	Giuliano	Trujillo	The pope was talking about excommunication. But with everyone against him and no one left to impress, [MASK] didn’t have to hold himself back anymore. One morning, soon after sanctions went into effect, we woke up to the sound of sirens on the road.
<name>Comandante</name>	Comandante	Palomino	I’m a natural for this, really. I’ve always liked men, receiving them, paying them attention, listening to what they have to say. Now I can use my talents for the revolution. But I have eyes for one man only, my [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Minerva	I thought he was going to march right up to the podium and have a word with the rector. [MASK] took it best of all of us. She said now she’d have even more time to Spend with her family.
<name>Lucien</name>	Lucien	Manolo	[MASK] leaned towards me, his lips grazing my cheek. A kiss to mask what he had to say. “Our cells, are they ready?” So that’s what was worrying him. He didn’t know that the revolution was out of our hands.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Minerva	She figured it out from something he said, but she says that he’s so mature at twenty-three, you wouldn’t know it. The only thing, [MASK] adds, real breezy and smart the way she can be so cool, is the poor man’s already engaged to somebody else.
<name>Emmy</name>	Emmy	Sonia	G>rn.fo*cLtr — Put y*t)ity Thursday night, November 7 Today we had a surprise visitor. We were in the middle of making diagrams to go with the Nipples kits when there was a knock at our door. Believe me, [MASK] and I both jumped like one of the paper bombs had gone off.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Minerva	And you are here with me too, my dear Little Book. Thursday, December 20 My dear Little Book, Tomorrow, [MASK] and I take the train home for the holidays. I can’t wait! My soul is full of longing all right.
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Pefla	He was both, angel and devil, like the rest of us. “I have good news for you” [MASK] began. He folded his hands on his lap, waiting for me to gush a little more over him. “What is it, Captain?”
<name>Rufino</name>	Rufino	Rufino	The trial was on TV all day long for almost a month. Three of the murderers did finally admit to killing one each of the Mirabal sisters. Another one killed [MASK], the driver. The fifth stood on the side of the road to warn the others if someone was coming.
<name>Devil</name>	Devil	Lord	“What kind of a name is that?” Like I said, it must have been the [MASK]’s tongue in my mouth because back then, I was running scared. Not for myself but for those I loved.
<name>Franciscans</name>	Franciscans	Yanquis	At last, she added, “You’re right, they’re all scoundrels—Dominicans, [MASK], every last man.” “Not every one,” I said. After all, I had to defend my husband.
<name>Enrique</name>	Enrique	Nelson	But [MASK] found out about the letter from his little blabbermouth aunt in the capital. It was unfair, I wasn’t letting him become a man. But I stood firm. I’d rather have him stay alive, a boy forever, than be a man dead in the ground.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Jaimito	A small diamond set at the center of a gold filigree flower. “Ay, [MASK],” she said, tilting it to catch the light. “It’s lovely” “My heart,” he said. “I know I have to ask your father for your hand.
