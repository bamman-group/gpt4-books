<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Babamukuru	But that, I knew, would do me no good because I was burning up with wanting to escape from there. I did make an effort to improve my state of mind. I scolded myself strongly for not appreciating [MASK]’s concern for my family and me.
<name>Brother</name>	Brother	Chido	The girl, while not actually ignoring him, did not respond to him, casting at intervals probing glances over the gathering and including my brother in her surveillance. [MASK] tried to smile, but the smile was too narrow to dispel the apprehension in his eyes.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Babamukum	Of course we ducked and scuttled away, swallowing great giggles and congratulating ourselves on being so lucky. Of course [MASK] saw us and scraped the back door open and demanded, ‘What are you children doing?’ in stentorian tones that brooked no disobedience.
<name>father</name>	father	Babamukuru	Its phrases told me something I did not want to know, that my [MASK] was not the person I had thought he was. He was wealthier than I had thought possible. He was educated beyond books. And he had done it alone.
<name>dear</name>	dear	Mai	What will her parents think when she tells them how she was punished. Truly, this punishment is too much for the child.’ ‘Now, what is the matter, [MASK]? There is no need to bring up all that.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Maiguru	She thought there was a difference between people deserting their daughters and people saving themselves. [MASK] was doing the latter and would be available to her daughter when she was needed. ‘We’ll survive,’ she assured me. ‘We’ll manage somehow.’
<name>Aunt Ada Doom</name>	Aunt Ada Doom	Anna	The boys wore khaki shirts and shorts as usual, the girls were in dark-blue, belted gym-slips over pale-blue blouses. ‘It’s for them to go to assembly,’ chuckled [MASK] from the diningroom.
<name>you</name>	you	Lucia	‘The woman thinks she can go away. Just like that. Now, [MASK], where do you say you will go? Aren’t you waiting for me to take you to my home?’ Those men!
<name>Maiguru</name>	Maiguru	Lucia	[MASK] laughed. ‘Don’t worry yourself,’ she reassured me. ‘This is a storm. It will pass.’ In the house Babamukuru was deeply perplexed and annoyed with my father for stirring up this trouble.
<name>Two-Tone</name>	Two-Tone	Nhamo	The old building that had disappointed me turned out to be a garage. It was built to shelter cars, not people! And this garage sheltered two cars. Not one, but two cars. [MASK]’s chorus sang in my head and now it sounded ominous.
<name>Aunt Dahlia</name>	Aunt Dahlia	Lucia	‘Exactly,’ she scoffed. ‘As if children were meant to be at their parents’ wedding!’ Looking at it this way it was impossible to be frightened. We grew quite weak with laughter, but [MASK] pursed her lips and went to the living-room.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Tambu	‘You should have told us earlier if it was so important,’ she said. ‘Really, [MASK], you should. Shall I be bridesmaid? Will it be better if all you have to do is sit there?’ I did not answer.
<name>John</name>	John	Babamukuru	I let guilt, so many razor-sharp edges of it, slice away at me. My mother had been right: I was unnatural; I would not listen to my own parents, but I would listen to [MASK] even when he told me to laugh at my parents.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Nhamo	So deep was my disappointment that I was not comforted when [MASK], seduced by our unrestrained voices and the throb of the dram, came out to join us. I thought he was fickle, that he wanted to eat his chicken and have eggs as well.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Nyasha	It was nerve-wracking. Watching [MASK] work her way daintily through egg and bacon and tea, having declined the porridge and toast because too much food would make her fat, I saw myself walking into the classroom late and conspicuous on my first day.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Anna	Besides, it was not to be such a radical transformation that people would have to behave differently towards me. It was to be an extension and improvement of what I really was. [MASK]’s behaviour made me feel uncomfortably strange and unfamiliar with myself, so I spoke roughly to her.
<name>Uncle Tom</name>	Uncle Tom	Babamukuru	[MASK] made his fair-sized form as expansive as possible, holding his arms out and bending low so that we all could be embraced, could embrace him. He was happy. He was smiling. ‘Yes, yes,’ he kept saying.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Tambu	At three o’clock she woke me up. ‘Can I get into bed with you, [MASK]?’ she whispered, but when I rolled over to make room for her to climb in she shook her head and smiled. ‘It’s all right,’ she said.
<name>Mrs. Warren</name>	Mrs. Warren	Maiguru	[MASK] consented readily enough, but you could see she was not appeased. ‘He didn’t make half as much fuss when we got married,’ she confided to her daughter. ‘I had one bridesmaid and tea. No dinner.
<name>Mrs. Oliver</name>	Mrs. Oliver	Maiguru	[MASK] came but could not say where her daughter was. ‘Perhaps playing netball,’ she suggested, so I walked up to the netball field, where I found a group of girls whiling away the time between the end of lessons and supper by shooting into the ring.
<name>He</name>	He	Babamukuru	He threatened all sorts of things, to stop buying me clothes, to stop my school fees, to send me home, but it did not matter any more. [MASK] did not know how I had suffered over the question of that wedding.
<name>Miss Maudie</name>	Miss Maudie	Nyasha	‘Er, [MASK],’ he asked, cutting her greeting short and not even seeing me, ‘can you tell me why you are only coming in at this time, at a quarter to seven?’ ‘I was working,’ she replied, seating herself, ‘in the classroom.’
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Nyasha	In the end [MASK], whether she intended to be rude or not, got up off the floor, where she had been sitting beside her mother. ‘Well, I’ll be more comfortable here even if no one else will,’ she announced, planting herself in the chair.
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Nyasha	Still, [MASK] was concerned for my comfort, so she gave me a box of tampons with the instructions to read. Those instructions, with their curvaceous line-drawings, were intriguing because we had not studied human reproduction at school. Did it really look like that inside?
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Babamukuru	There was not much time to discuss all the things that had needed to be discussed but had had to wait while he was away, so [MASK] and his brothers and sister talked together far into the night and the early hours of morning.
<name>she</name>	she	Nyasha	Of course I didn’t mind - it was all right then. But you wait and see what happens at your wedding. I bet he won’t be so concerned then either.’ Fortunately, [MASK] was not thinking of marriage at the time so the threat did not alarm her.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Nyasha	Didn’t you hear me tell you that just now? Now sit down and eat that food. All of it. I want to see you eat all of it.’ ‘I’ve had enough,’ explained [MASK]. ‘Really, I’m full.’
<name>Summer</name>	Summer	Babamukuru	During the second half of the term her letters became less regular and eventually stopped altogether. Again I must confess that I did not really notice. The thirteen weeks of term galloped by so quickly that while I was still wondering when she would write next, [MASK] came to fetch me.
<name>Gran</name>	Gran	Babamukuru	In fact, there was everything we needed for the two weeks’ stay and more besides, because [MASK] always provided not only the Christmas meal but Christmas itself for as many of the clan that gathered for as long as they gathered.
<name>she</name>	she	Nyasha	I knew I was not evil to have endured all that terror in order to be sure of my decision, so when [MASK] asked whether I would go, I was able to tell her calmly, ‘No.’
<name>they</name>	they	Maiguru	My mother was secretly pleased that [MASK] did not want to stay on the homestead, although naturally she had to make polite protestations, inviting them to sleep over every time that my uncle and aunt left for the mission.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Nyasha	It was good to be feeling superior for a change, for the first time since I entered my uncle’s house, so I ignored my cousin. [MASK] climbed out of bed, advising me to make an effort to stop being a peasant, which distressed me no end.
<name>Linda</name>	Linda	Babamukuru	She was [MASK]’s wife. She lived in a comfortable home and was a teacher. Unlike her daughter, she was grateful for all these blessings, but I thought even the saints in heaven must grow disgruntled sometimes and let the lesser angels know.
<name>Uncle Tom</name>	Uncle Tom	Babamukuru	[MASK] stood over her, distending his nostrils to take in enough air. ‘Today I am going to teach you a lesson,’ he told her. ‘How can you go about disgracing me? Me! Like that! No, you cannot do it.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Maiguru	‘A whole ox would be too much,’ [MASK] pointed out logically. ‘Even a side is too much. But what I object to is the way everybody expects me to spend all my time cooking for them.
<name>Nyasha</name>	Nyasha	Maiguru	Say whatever you are thinking.’ There was a pause during which [MASK] folded her arms and leant back in the sofa. ‘I don’t think,’ she began easily in her soft, soothing voice, ‘thatTambudzai will be corrupted by going to that school.
<name>Mrs. Hopewell</name>	Mrs. Hopewell	Babamukuru	Ya, she really works hard to keep things comfortable here.’ And [MASK] was pleased enough to let the matter pass. The rest of us stood whispering outside, listening to these goings on and peering in at the window when the talking was intense and we thought no one would notice.
<name>Baby</name>	Baby	Maiguru	‘Did you think I wasn’t coming, even after you telephoned to say supper was ready and I said I was coming?’ ‘No, no, my Daddy-dear,’ chirped [MASK], fussing with the dishes. ‘We were only just about to begin.
<name>Aunt Augusta</name>	Aunt Augusta	Nyasha	And now the joke’s over. You told me it wouldn’t last. ‘He won’t send you home,’ [MASK] soothed. ‘Goodness, no! Just imagine what people would say.’ It was very difficult.
<name>Madame Ratignolle</name>	Madame Ratignolle	Nyasha	‘It’s such a waste,’ lamented [MASK], noting the difference. ‘Imagine what she might have been with the right kind of exposure!’ And then she confessed that she was having one of her rare pangs of guilt, because deep down she was glad that her mother had come home.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Maiguru	‘That’s all people ever say.’ [MASK] snorted. ‘And what do you expect? Why should a woman go all that way and put up with all those problems if not to look after her husband?’
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Nyasha	‘Actually,’ confessed [MASK] with unusual diffidence, so that if I had not heard her speak before I would have said she was shy, ‘actually we were frightened that day. And confused. You know, it’s easy to forget things when you’re that young.
<name>his wife</name>	his wife	Maiguru	He was all for going in there himself to drag her to the table, but [MASK] managed to dissuade him. His daughter was so fragile, she said, the shock might do her serious harm. ‘And starving herself,’ he cried, ‘you mean starving herself does her no harm?’
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Anna	The cake was ready to go into the oven, the weather was hot: the cake would rise in the mixing-bowl and flop in the baking-tin if it was not put to bake immediately. [MASK] would show me where to go.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Maiguru	I knew, too, that the fact of menstruation was a shamefully unclean secret that should not be allowed to contaminate immaculate male ears by indiscreet reference to this type of dirt in their presence. Yet at a glance it was difficult to perceive dirt in [MASK]’s house.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Nyasha	Lessons at the secondary school ended at four o’clock, which meant forty minutes to wait and then maybe twenty more to give [MASK] time to pack away her books, have a word with her classmates and walk down to the house.
<name>Hagrid</name>	Hagrid	Babamukuru	I climbed out of the car much less hopefully than I had climbed into it, and followed [MASK] uneasily as he walked towards the house. A huge, hairy hound appeared in front of me from nowhere. It leapt out of thin air and scared me to death.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Anna	So, I was wanted in the living-room! I had expected to be called. [MASK]’s behaviour would have worried me more if there had been time to think about it, but this summons was too important to allow time for brooding.
<name>Nhlanhla</name>	Nhlanhla	Babamukuru	And if she did fail dismally, he would probably have been able to use his influence to allow her to repeat the exam. The authorities thought [MASK] was a good African. And it was generally believed that good Africans bred good African children who also thought about nothing except serving their communities.
<name>Tambu</name>	Tambu	Babamukuru	I washed my hands, sat down beside her and swallowed a few morsels of sadza without tasting them, moulding them much longer between my fingers than was necessary: my appetite had departed with the news I had heard. Hardly able to believe my luck, I told my mother of [MASK]’s decision.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Nyasha	Yet it would be strenuous, disturbing too, to have to share a room with [MASK], who was morose and taciturn, who made me feel uncomfortable because something had extinguished the sparkle in her eyes. Besides, I still disapproved of her.
<name>Imani</name>	Imani	Nyasha	There were no black psychiatrists, but she was persuaded to see a white one. This man was human. She needed to rest, he said. So [MASK] was put into a clinic, where she stayed for several weeks.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Maiguru	The onset of my menses, then, should have been placid, but when it came to washing those rags in [MASK]’s white bathroom, to making a mess in the toilet bowl before I flushed it away, the business became nasty and nauseating.
<name>Mai</name>	Mai	Maiguru	There were many things that were embarrassing about that meal: my place looked as though a small and angry child had been fed there; here I was with a spoon in my hand instead of a fork and now [MASK] was dishing sadza on to my plate, sadza that nobody else would eat.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Doris	‘That’s more than two crates of shumba. Wasted on a kaffir!’ [MASK] allowed her husband to lead her away. I offered my basket, repeating my slogan, for her to choose the biggest cobs. She patted my head and called me a plucky piccannin.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Tambu	I try, [MASK], but there is not much to speak of between us. They resent the fact that I do not read their romance stories and, if I do not read them, then of course I cannot talk about them.
<name>Aunt Alexandra</name>	Aunt Alexandra	Maiguru	Or else [MASK] would apologise at table for not having bought us cream to go with our jelly. ‘I tried to find some,’ she would flutter, ‘but we got there so late everything was gone. As usual!’
<name>I</name>	I	Nhamo	It was a veiy complicated journey that my father and [MASK] were undertaking. Complicated, therefore exciting. I wanted to be part of it. I wanted to juggle with transport timetables as well. I wanted to eat fresh combread, ashy roast peanuts and salty boiled chicken on the train at midnight too.
<name>her husband</name>	her husband	Lucia	‘Oh, my Daddy-dear,’ she laughed. ‘When women get talking! We’d only have remembered the food when we began to cook!’ She disengaged herself from [MASK] for the second time and moved rapidly, gratefully to the car.
<name>Madame de Maisonrouge</name>	Madame de Maisonrouge	Maiguru	If I was daunted by [MASK]’s dainty porcelain cups, the living-room, as I have said, would have finished me off had I not been inoculated by the gradient I have talked of, although calling it a glamour gradient is not really the right way to describe it.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Babamukuru	[MASK] reassured her warmly, looking around for somewhere to sit and finally perching himself on the edge of the bed he had bought for my father in June, and of course not thinking of the unscrupulous twists that my mother’s mind took.
<name>Mock Turtle</name>	Mock Turtle	Babamukuru	Can it be a man that talks such nonsense? A man should talk sense, isn’t it? So what can this be?’ and she tweaked its ears to find out what it would say. ‘Let me tell you, [MASK],’ she continued earnestly.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Nyasha	‘Do you think she doesn’t know what she’s doing, waiting on me like this?’ ‘I don’t like cold food,’ [MASK] pointed out, as willing as her father to engage in dialogue. ‘Are you sure you have enough meat, my Daddy-d?’
<name>Holly</name>	Holly	Lucia	[MASK] had managed somehow to keep herself plump in spite of her tribulations. Maybe, some said, because of them, since her afflictions consisted mostly of dalliances with men who did not want to settle down with her but who were often very rich.
<name>Mr. McGregor</name>	Mr. McGregor	Nyamarira	I was not sorry to be leaving the tedious task of coaxing [MASK]’s little tributary in and out of the vegetable beds. Of course, my emancipation from these aspects of my existence was, for the foreseeable future, temporary and not continuous, but that was not the point.
<name>him</name>	him	Babamukuru	My cousin was pretty and bold and sharp. You never thought about [MASK] as being handsome or ugly, but he was completely dignified. He didn’t need to be bold any more because he had made himself plenty of power. Plenty of power. Plenty of money.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Babamukuru	The honour for teaching them this emancipating lesson was mine. I claimed it all, for here I was, living proof of the moral. There was no doubt in my mind that this was the case. When I stepped into [MASK]’s car I was a peasant.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Maiguru	‘I don’t know what’s wrong with our daughter. She has no sense of decency, none whatsoever.’ So saying, he took the book and left the room, returning a minute later without the offending volume. ‘You think she shouldn’t read it?’ [MASK] asked.
<name>my brother</name>	my brother	Babamukuru	In the excitement, my mother left behind at the mission a lime-green bonnet and a bright pink bootee which she had received at my brother’s birth. I was so impressed with [MASK] I could not stop admiring him.
<name>Maiguru</name>	Maiguru	Lucia	Aren’t our children Sigauke?’ The mutterings and malcontent carried on, my mother and aunts fanning each other’s tempers until [MASK], who enjoyed battle and liked to be ferocious at it, was seething with anger. ‘It is all right for you,’ she boiled.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Nyasha	‘Don’t you hear me speaking to you? Don’t the others have friends?’ ‘They have friends,’ [MASK] muttered, sulking. ‘Then why are you the only one to stay out so late?’
<name>he</name>	he	Babamnkuru	He is finishing Standard Three so there will be no problem with the transfer. I will come to fetch him a few days before the new school year begins. Meanwhile I will have him registered for Standard Four at the mission.’ My aunt was on her feet before [MASK] had finished speaking.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Maiguru	Once, when I passed my hand in front of her eyes, she did not see me either and I had to shout very loudly to bring her back. [MASK] saw that the situation was serious but did not know what to do.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Nyasha	I sat on my bed and waited, not daring to speak to [MASK], whose detachment, when she was not disarming you with the full force of her precocious charm, was very intimidating. Fortunately, it was not in her nature to remain detached for long.
<name>him</name>	him	Nyasha	Really, it’s very difficult.’ The intimacy that had permeated the room by that stage was heady. It made me reckless in the way that draining the dregs in my father’s gourd had done when I was little. It made me tell [MASK] frankly what I thought.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Nyasha	I told you I don’t want you reading books like that.’ [MASK] froze half-way out of her chair and then stood up and confronted her mother. ‘You haven’t taken it, have you?’ she asked, and then answered herself.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Nyasha	In the early hours of the morning something prodded me awake. It was [MASK]. ‘Can you help me?’ she asked timidly. ‘I can’t get the right answer, I ought to be able to, but I keep getting it wrong.’
<name>Shelley</name>	Shelley	Lucia	‘At least the elder one did the respectable thing and went with her man,’ the villagers said. And then they clapped their hands in horror and shook their heads. ‘But look at that [MASK]! Ha! There is nothing of a woman there.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Maiguru	I was sure that my cousins wanted to join the merry-making but [MASK] was not encouraging. I could tell from her voice, which was flat and passive, and from the odd word that I picked up like ‘dirty’ and ‘sleep’.
<name>Wakem</name>	Wakem	Vakomana	‘ [MASK], vakomam,' he must have said, holding his head in his hands and shaking it, possibly even striking his forehead with the flat of his palm. ‘Did you ever see the like of the things that are happening here at your home?
<name>my brother</name>	my brother	Nhamo	‘If I had your brains,’ my father used to say to [MASK] by way of encouragement during my brother’s early school years, his formative years, ‘I would have been a teacher by now. Or maybe even a doctor. Ya!
<name>Dad</name>	Dad	Nyasha	[MASK] thought we should be consistent and avoid them even when they were driving. But I still loved my car-rides and argued pragmatically that we avoided them when it suited us but, since a car-ride suited us, we should not avoid them on such occasions.
<name>Uncle Jack</name>	Uncle Jack	Doris	He told me that [MASK] had commended him for trying to help me, had donated ten pounds towards my school fees. He showed me the money, the crisp clean note. Ten pounds. We never even talked about that much money at home.
<name>Abdul</name>	Abdul	Babamukuru	It smelt good. I was pleased with my efforts, but they had lasted less than half an hour. To kill more time I made sausages out of the tripe and the small intestine of [MASK]’s goat. When I had finished I cooked the vegetables.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Nhamo	The rest of you, the rest of you stand there clapping as though you were at a football game. What’s wrong with you?’ ‘She started it,’ [MASK] said lazily, watchfully. ‘Yes,’ chorused everybody. ‘She charged.
<name>Esme</name>	Esme	Nyasha	We walked down to the car. In the courtyard [MASK] hugged me. ‘Have a good time, you African,’ she grinned. We parted with laughter and requests and promises to write and reply and to visit.
<name>me</name>	me	Nhamo	Sometimes, when my uncle was not too busy with reports and administration at the end of the school term, he was able to come away from his office at three o’clock in the afternoon, sacrificing the remaining hours in the day in order to bring [MASK] home.
<name>him</name>	him	Babamukuru	It was such a bed of confusion. I would not have been here with [MASK] if I had not been able to stand up to my own father, yet now I was unable to tell my uncle that his wedding was a farce.
<name>me</name>	me	Chido	You know how vicious they are. So he didn’t let them out. I said to him, let [MASK] do it when they get back, and he said he would rather do it himself to make sure it was done. That’s how he is.
<name>me</name>	me	Rambanai	Try as I would, I simply could not open my mouth to talk to him. My mother, who was in the first part of the pregnancy that resulted in [MASK], was very distressed by all this. ‘Now what evil spirits have arisen between you two?’
<name>Dad</name>	Dad	Babamukuru	And what cars they were, long, lean and gleaming. I sent up a little prayer of thanksgiving that [MASK] had seen fit to drive the green Ford, but I noticed that he always arrived in the Rover after that.
<name>Aunt Alexandra</name>	Aunt Alexandra	Babamukuru	‘Sit down, my child,’ invited [MASK] cordially as I tiptoed into the living-room. Actually, I walked in normally, placing my whole foot on the floor, but it felt like tiptoeing, so respectful was my gait.
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Tete	‘I am only saying they should rest. You know, a flight is very tiring. But if you say they should dance, they shall. [MASK] has told you to go to the dance,’ she informed her children in her uninflected voice.
<name>Daddy</name>	Daddy	Babamukuru	‘I shall wear shoes and socks, and shorts with no holes in them, all brand new, bought for me by [MASK]. He has the money. I will even have underwear - a vest and pants. I shall have a jersey in winter, and probably a blazer too.
<name>Tendai</name>	Tendai	Nhamo	When a significant issue did arise so that it was necessary to discuss matters in depth, [MASK]’s Shona - grammar, vocabulary, accent and all - would miraculously return for the duration of the discussion, only to disappear again mysteriously once the issue was settled.
<name>Joad</name>	Joad	Mwaramu	And anyway, [MASK], maybe you can tell me plainly: where do you want me to go? We both know I can’t go home. Their sending me here in the first place, it was because there was no food, and no work either at that place, isn’t it?
<name>Dr. John Watson</name>	Dr. John Watson	Maiguru	‘And starving herself,’ he cried, ‘you mean starving herself does her no harm?’ Eventually he allowed himself to be pacified. ‘Perhaps you are right,’ he conceded to [MASK]. ‘She does eat her supper when I have time to supervise her properly.
<name>Melanie</name>	Melanie	Nyasha	I did my best to talk to [MASK] when she came. I racked my brains for odd English words that I could slip into my sentences to help her understand what I was saying, but it was no use. She did not talk beyond a quick stuttered greeting.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Babamukuru	A deep valley cracked open. There was no bridge; at the bottom, spiked crags as sharp as spears. I felt separated forever from my uncle. It all became very depressing and confusing. At first I had been disappointed because I thought the garage was [MASK]’s house.
<name>my sister</name>	my sister	Netsai	To keep the peace I would accompany [MASK] when she needed help, all the way to the shops muttering and fuming to both of us about our brother’s laziness. You may wonder why I did not stand up for my sister, tell my brother to carry his own luggage.
