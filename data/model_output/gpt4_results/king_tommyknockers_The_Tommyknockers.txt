<name>Tyrion</name>	Tyrion	Gard	She stuck out her chin. “You calling me a whore?” He smiled. “You need a pimp? There’s money in it, I hear.” “You want breakfast, [MASK], or do you want to piss me off?”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Nancy	The sifters were lying on their sides. When [MASK] turned on the transformer, a number of filament-thin wires hooked to something that looked like a blender began to scoop first-class mail from a pile on the floor into the sifters, seemingly at random.
<name>George</name>	George	David	He put his foot on the concealed sewing-machine pedal and stepped on it. Hummmmmmmmm. He waited for the sheet to plump up in [MASK]’s shape. He would whip the sheet off him and say, There, ya baby, see?
<name>Althea</name>	Althea	Bobbi	Remember? Remember us?" [MASK] looked down at her hands. Did he see tears in those strange eyes? Probably all he saw was wishful thinking. “When were you in the shed?” “Last night.” “What did you touch?”
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Moss	The army blanket covering the torn seat in the cab of [MASK]’s truck sprang alight, then the seat-covers beneath, then the tindery stuffing; now the entire cab was flickery furnace orange, with the skeletons of springs peering up through the glare.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Del	By then it was coming on dark—” “Dark!" “I know how it sounds, don’t you worry,” [MASK] said crossly—but it was the crossness of someone who is deeply ashamed.
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Ted	But they were all backing away, eyes wide and scared. [MASK]’s hip struck one corner of the buffet. The table rocked forward and upward, silverware sliding down the inclined plane of the wrinkling tablecloth, plates falling and shattering on the floor.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Bobby	And when they came together, they did it snarling and clawing and it was very, very good. Just like old times, [MASK] thought as he drove them out to the Applegate place, and wondered exactly what he meant by that.
<name>him</name>	him	Gardener	In it was a molecule-exciter which could raise the spot heat of anything two inches in diameter roughly one thousand degrees in fifteen seconds. She was hoping to boil [MASK] like a lobster. Just let me get within five feet, she kept thinking.
<name>Valentine</name>	Valentine	Gardener	“Well, it postulates something similar to your Agent Orange from Space or Paraquat of the Gods or whatever you called it.” [MASK] smiled. “In the story, an experimental chemical is sucked out into the atmosphere and falls on a piece of suburban Connecticut.
<name>Arctor</name>	Arctor	Bright	“Yes,” [MASK] said. “Also, this whatever-it-is in the air improved the shit out of his radio reception.” “Right.” “And you think he might be in a lot of trouble.” “Right again.”
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Bobbi	She felt herself stepping backward in a spongy dream. She was trying to scream but there was no air. At [MASK]’s crotch, a grotesque thatch of tentacles like sea-grass wavered from her vagina . . . the place where her vagina had been, anyway.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Gardener	She looked up, and in the slanting light of seven o’clock, [MASK] thought the woman looked both aged and ageless. She also looked evil, he thought—jaundiced and yellowish-black with a heavy freight of evil that was simultaneously wearing her out and eating her up.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Eddie	At the same time, the first drops of rain hit the windshield. “Listen,” [MASK] said, pulling over, “I hate to leave you off like this. It’s starting to rain and you don’t even have any fuckin shoes.”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Gard	Most of it, however, had either been sweated off. . . or washed away by her tears. “I hurt you,” he said. You loved me, she answered. “What?” You hear me, [MASK]. I know you do.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Gardener	The sheets of spray fell back. A last diffuse rainbow wavered in the air and disappeared. [MASK] saw the ship shift as the rock weld which had prisoned it so long let go. It moved so slightly it might have been imagination, but it wasn’t.
<name>Shadow</name>	Shadow	Peter	The branch of a low bush scratched her cheek hard enough to bring blood. “Shit!” she cried, and a bluejay scolded her. [MASK] returned, first sniffing and then licking her nose. “Christ, don’t do that, your breath stinks!”
<name>Clayton</name>	Clayton	Gardener	Bingo! It was gone. Just like that. [MASK] staggered backward, the earphone popping free and hitting the floor. His nose was still bleeding and he had soaked a fresh shirt. How many pints of blood were in the human body? And what had happened?
<name>Images</name>	Images	Images	her, then each other. She could hear machinery throbbing in the woods somewhere—the sound was distant and dreamlike. The Cutlass began to weave back and forth on the deserted road. [MASK] doubled, trebled, came reluctantly back together, then began doubling and trebling again.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Gardener	[MASK] put his hurt foot down and screamed as a savage hand reached all the way up from his ankle to seize the soft double sac of his testicles. The old man: wait wait It rose on its own. Not far; only an inch or two.
<name>Alvin</name>	Alvin	Gard	Sometimes [MASK] felt a sickening surety that cooling out the powderkeg the planet was sitting on was the last thing the New and Improved Haven was concerned with. And so? He didn’t know. Sometimes being a telepathic zero was a pain in the ass.
<name>Ellie</name>	Ellie	Anderson	[MASK] was not really surprised. 3 So about twenty minutes later she stood above it, looking down the forested slope to the trench she had begun in the ground, freeing what she now believed was a very tiny section of an extraterrestrial spacecraft.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bobbi	Before he could make the decision, he had to see what was in [MASK]’s shed. 5 Halfway back he stopped in the cold, slippery moonlight, struck by a question—why had they bothered to hide the car?
<name>Thurlow</name>	Thurlow	Bobbi	Their eyes were filmed over to the whiteness of cataracts. Their lips were drawn back in uniform snarls. Their skins were scaly but transparent—he could see frozen muscles laid in crisscross patterns around jaws, temples, and necks. They had no teeth. 8 [MASK] joined him.
<name>He</name>	He	Ev	But you will. Did she have other friends who’ll be going?” “Yes. Half a dozen or more. I’m going by myself, starting a little early, so I can talk to some people about a related case.” [MASK] nodded.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Andy	Otherwise, you could recite it on your deathbed.” “Look,” [MASK] said, “we ought to get back to work—” “I let her get about four sentences in, then I joined her. Her jaw dropped almost down to her knees.
<name>Alfred</name>	Alfred	Hilly	The panic would be merciful in one way: when it came, it would obliterate thought. But things had not gone that far yet, unfortunately. Two thoughts occurred to [MASK]’s bright mind in rapid succession. The first: I never disappeared anything that was alive.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Hillman	The disappearance of the two troopers, both of whom he had known and liked, had temporarily driven it out of his mind. [MASK]’s visit had brought it back, and that was what sent him after the old man.
<name>Trisha</name>	Trisha	Anderson	[MASK] got up on her knees and dug down along either side. She tried wiggling it again. Still no go. She scraped away more soil with her fingers and quickly exposed more—now she saw six inches of gray metal, now nine, now a foot.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Bobbi	“Fourteen hours, I guess. A little more. [MASK], your new book—” “Yeah. Hold that until I get back.” She walked slowly across the floor toward the bathroom, unbuttoning the shirt she’d slept in.
<name>Chigurh</name>	Chigurh	Gardener	“Maybe because of his spirit,” [MASK] said. “Maybe because he loved you.” He took the pistol out of his belt. He held it (shield-shield-shield-shield) against his inner left thigh.
<name>Haven</name>	Haven	Bobbi	“What’s in them?” “Nothing but good old Haven air. The tanks are small—forty, maybe fifty minutes of air. You clip it to your belt like this, see?” “Yes.” [MASK] offered him one of the rigs.
<name>Gregor</name>	Gregor	Newt	Then it would come back. Its long morning shadow fluttered like the shadow of a window-shade blown by an intermittent wind. [MASK] found the fact that sometimes the shadow of the clock-tower was there when the tower itself was not, particularly disturbing.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Gardener	“Come on out in the kitchen after you do,” she said. “We have to talk.” “Yes. I suppose we do.” In the guestroom, [MASK] took off the T-shirt he had been wearing and put on a clean one.
<name>Severian</name>	Severian	Gardener	The light from the walls glowed softly on the planes of his haggard face, and that light—white, not green—was kind. Someone seeing [MASK] in that light might almost have believed he was not dying. Almost. 41
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Gardener	Its sweet clarity, so old and deep—those rays of sun slanting almost horizontally through the unraveling clouds as this long, confusing, exhausting day neared its end. That ancient light seemed to deny time itself, and [MASK] almost expected to hear a huntsman winding his horn, announcing “All Assemble.”
<name>Susannah</name>	Susannah	Bobbi	That was a question he couldn’t answer. Slishhh-slishhh-slishhh. How long had [MASK] and her company been gone? He didn’t know; hadn’t the slightest idea. Time had no meaning in here; the old man was right.
<name>Connell</name>	Connell	Gardener	My God— There was another crunch. [MASK] seemed to feel the earth actually drop a bit under his feet. At the bottom of the trench, water pressure was finish- ing the work the blasting had begun—widening fissures and holes, pulling the friable rock apart.
<name>Alfred</name>	Alfred	Gardener	If you whiff on what comes out of the ship, it’s going to kill you as quick as a Dran-O cocktail.” “I,” [MASK] said, “am convinced.” He slipped the snorkel mouthpiece into his mouth and used the noseplugs.
<name>Alveron</name>	Alveron	Bozeman	About three minutes later another of those loud, crumping roars shuddered out of the trench. A spray of rocks rose into the sky and came down, rattling off the hull of the ship with dull clangs and clongs. “Well, let’s—” [MASK] began.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Gardener	That light was pulsing in time to the low slurping sound. I don’t want to go in there. There was a smell. Even that, [MASK] thought, was slightly sudsy, bland with a faint hint of rancidity. Old soap. Cakey soap.
<name>David</name>	David	Peter	Old ghosts had stirred when she moved her book of undergraduate poems ... or perhaps it was that high, mild wind, hooting the eaves and whistling the trees. She had almost made it when [MASK] woke her up.
<name>Benjamin</name>	Benjamin	Clover	“[MASK]’s old eyes flitted from one face to another. And as the animals outside looked from pig to man, and man to pig, and pig to man again, it seemed that some strange thing was happening. It was impossible to say which was which. ”
<name>He</name>	He	Swallows	[MASK]. No pain. The fever has gone down a lot, too. Coffee and aspirin, he thinks. You were going to get up for coffee and aspirin, remember? Sure, he thinks, settling more comfortably into the rocking chair and closing his eyes.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Sissy	6 She had dialed back at once, but this time, after a long pause, the telephone began to make a weird sirening noise in her ear. She hung up and went over to her weeping mother and her harp relatives. “Did you get her, [MASK]?”
<name>Thad</name>	Thad	Kyle	It was almost (but not quite) the sound of machinery. [MASK] took an involuntary step backward, his face tightening momentarily into an expression of fright, revulsion, and awe. The smell alone—thick and fetid and organic—was damn near enough to knock a man over.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ruth	(we can wait [MASK]) (shhhh shhhh go to sleep) (yes go to sleep and dream) (dream of things dream of ways) (to “become” ways to “become" ways to)
<name>He</name>	He	Bobbi	“You want to ride up first?” “No, you go. It sounds like you got a schedule and a half still ahead of you.” “I do.” [MASK] swung astride the sling, pressed a button, and started up.
<name>Dirk</name>	Dirk	Gard	“You were here soon enough. You saved my life. I wouldn’t be here without you. So let’s do it together, [MASK]. I bet it’s no more than another twenty-five feet down to that hatchway.”
<name>Danny</name>	Danny	Bobbi	The doors had been torn off the shower stalls but they were still full of some clear liquid—it was being contained in the same way that tiny sun was contained in [MASK]’s water heater, he supposed. If he tried to get into one of those stalls, he would feel a tough springiness.
<name>He</name>	He	Bobbi	He almost overbalanced and fell on top of her. Then he pressed the.45 against the side of her neck and pulled the trigger. Another click. [MASK], screaming and screaming. Screaming inside his head. He tried to pull the slide back again. Almost got it.
<name>Connell</name>	Connell	Bryant	And with the ship gone, there was only this gadget and twenty-four truck batteries between them and eventual strangulation. How long? [MASK] asked, and no one answered. There was only the flat shine of their frightened, inhuman eyes in the fireshot night.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Gard	I’ll do it just as soon as I wake up. [MASK], you are awake. But that, of course, could not be. In the waking world, people don’t shoot green beams from their eyes, beams that cure fevers and sore throats.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Bent	“No. That wasn’t no furnace explosion. And the fumes that kept us from going down in the basement—that smell like oil to you?” [MASK] shook his head. Whatever it was, he’d never before smelled anything like it in his life.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Gardener	One of his loafers was still on, but it was shriveled and useless. [MASK] kicked it off and watched apathetically as it floated down into greeny dark- ness. Something for the lobsters to shit in, he thought, and sat up.
<name>Garrett</name>	Garrett	Dugan	Better if you can believe—even for a little while—that someone or something you can get hold of was responsible. It makes the hole a little smaller. Even a rube knows that much. Sighing, suddenly feeling much older than his age, [MASK] trudged back to the barracks.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Gardener	“Thank you.” “You want to be a little careful of that vodka,” the bartender said. “It has a way of blindsiding you.” “I’m in control,” [MASK] said, and gave the bartender a reassuring wink.
<name>She</name>	She	Gardener	.. nowhere.” She shrugged. “It’s probably like taking ether . . . but it might be painful. Agony, even. Either way, the devil you know is always better than the devil you don’t.” [MASK] suddenly burst into tears.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Bobbi	And for one puzzling moment he saw a new picture, very brief, very clear, and very ominous: it was [MASK] in the cellar of the farmhouse she’d inherited from her uncle. She was hunkered down in front of some piece of machinery, working on it ... or was she?
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Anne	Every now and then a puff of faint breeze would stir, sucking the shades into the openings a little way. When it happened, they looked like the sails of a becalmed ship doing their best and failing. [MASK] sniffed and wrinkled her nose. Bluh.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Andy	Beyond that distance, the gadget became unreliable. She knew she could have improved its effectiveness up to half a mile, and now wished she had done so, but if [MASK] didn’t have at least six fresh shirts in the closet, he was like a bear.
<name>Alan</name>	Alan	Enders	There’s a dictionary back at the house. You need it, asshole?” He took a step toward [MASK] and had the distinct satisfaction of seeing the man fall back two steps, the contemptuous little smile disappearing. It was replaced with a look of nervy apprehension.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Ruth	In the funeral parlor, [MASK] stood looking down into his open coffin for a long time. She had wept almost steadily over the last week, and she suspected that there would be more tears to shed— oceans, perhaps—in the weeks and months ahead.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Ralph	The following Christmas—his last, although at that point he felt fine, the brain tumor that would kill him no more than a microscopic dot in his head—[MASK] gave her another four benches, three new dolls, and a blackboard in scale with the benches.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Gardener	He looked to his left, and sure enough, there it was, a little above him in what must have been his original position, the drinker’s signature—a great big splash of drying vomit. [MASK] wiped a shaking, dirty right hand under his nose and saw flakes of dried blood.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Hilly	Most of these tricks worked, not because of any talent or real flair, but because of the sheer determination with which [MASK] had rehearsed. All the intelligence and determination in the world cannot create art without a bit of talent, but intelligence and determination can create some great forgeries.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Bobbi	He got up and stood swaying on the rocks, looking at the water. Just one big step, that’s all it would take. He could do it in his sleep. Shit, almost had. Not yet. Want to talk to [MASK] first.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Peter	and I’m never going to like it, hut okay, okay, if it’s what you want. By the time they were both in the cab of the pickup, [MASK] was entirely his old self again.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Mumphry	[MASK] 9- Of his nine votes, it would be fair to assume he had gotten those of his wife, his brother, his twenty-three-year-old son, and himself. That left five unaccounted for.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Gardener	“I’m fine,” she said, at last gaining the porch. She stood over him, panting. “Where is she?” [MASK] inclined his head toward the house. The steady hiss of water came from one of the open windows. “Shower.
<name>Arctor</name>	Arctor	Ev	No nothing. This was very wrong. Very bad and very damned wrong. Faintly, far back in his mind, he could hear thoughts like a whisper of shortwave transmissions. He looked at [MASK]. “What the blue fuck is going on here, anyway?”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Leandro	“Yes, Mom,” [MASK] said, resigned. “Some of those places are just havens for microbes,” she said. “The cooks may not be clean, you know. They may not wash their hands after leaving the lavatory.
<name>Roger</name>	Roger	Bobbi	She had been grinding her teeth together madly. 10 [MASK] didn’t return her call that afternoon. Nor that early evening, as the V-2 of the wake entered the boozosphere. Nor that late evening as it went into orbit.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Bobbi	“What was that one?” she asked. “You tell me,” he said, and when her smile began to change to a look of narrow suspicion he added easily, “Come on, [MASK], I was just pulling your string a little.
<name>Deckard</name>	Deckard	Leandro	They were both breathing canned air now; nausea had come on them quickly with frightening power, but with the masks in place, it disappeared completely. [MASK] had been right. The air. Something in the air.
<name>Arnie</name>	Arnie	Anne	By that time the clerk would be off-duty—and besides, she had been so unnerved by [MASK]’s steady flailing that she wouldn’t have cared if the Cutlass had been earmarked for the President of the United States.
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Bozie	“We just brought in our swimming pool, [MASK]!” “Wh—” The hiss suddenly exploded into a soft, steady roar. Water jetted out of the trench and into the sky in a widening sheet.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Gardener	“You sure you don’t want to light off some firecrackers?” [MASK] shook his head, smiling. “Be careful with ’em, okay? People hurt themselves with things that go bang.” “Okay.” He smiled, a little shyly.
<name>Thad</name>	Thad	Gardener	He watched the car pull into the dooryard (missing the mailbox by bare inches) with a drunk’s bleary lack of surprise. He watched the woman get out, stagger, and hold on to the open door for a minute. Oh wow, [MASK] thought.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Anderson	“Go on,” [MASK] said patiently. “We’ve got some talking to do and some hard decisions to make, and I don’t want you breaking in halfway through to say you’ve decided the whole thing was just a hallucination that came out of a liquor bottle.”
<name>Randall</name>	Randall	Dick	The ship had begun to vibrate—the sound filled the air with a thick, subaural hum. [MASK] was aware of this . . . and then, as his eyes blew out of his head like half-congealed chunks of moldy jelly, he knew no more.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Gardener	The drops were lining up in obedience to lines of force which ran down the hull of the ship like lines of longitude on a globe. I can see it, [MASK] thought. I can see the force radiating from the ship’s skin in those drops.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Hank	[MASK] managed to keep a straight face until quitting time, but by the time he got into his car to go home, he was laughing so hard he almost shit his own pants. Twice he had to pull off the road, he got laughing so hard.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Gardener	“Those’re good poems. There’s a lot of them, too.” “I know,” [MASK] said, “but I was cold. Half a cord’ll get me through until spring.” He dropped her a wink.
<name>Hilly</name>	Hilly	Ruth	watching and waiting for. . . For what? But she knew: they were waiting for her to “become.” 8 In the week between the fire at the Paulsons’ and Hilly’s SECOND GALA MAGIC show, things began to go wrong for [MASK].
<name>Meursault</name>	Meursault	Butch	Now some new switch clicked over. [MASK] blinked once or twice, opened a drawer, and drew out a pad of paper. He wrote: I told people Tues. night I couldn’t go to herfuneral because I was sick. That was true.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Gardener	So [MASK] had gotten a crash course in a body function his own body would never perform, and he knew the layman’s idea of menstruation^—a monthly flow of blood from the vagina—simply wasn’t true. Most of the material which made up the menses wasn’t blood at all, but useless tissue.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Anne	The funeral director took one look at her and decided the old mick could rot in his pine box before he got involved. [MASK], who spent the whole day on the phone, would have congratulated him on making a wise decision. Her fury was rapidly passing all previous bounds.
<name>She</name>	She	Sol	She attached the M-16 to the center of the dented place on the great bell. When the hour struck and the hammer fell— Boom. [MASK] will just sit here, she thought. Sit here and wait for the hammer to fall. Droning weariness suddenly washed over her.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Ev	“Oh, don’t worry.” [MASK] leaned back into the Cherokee and rummaged in his bag of tricks again. He brought out a Kodak disk camera and something that looked like a cross between a pistol and a blow-dryer. “Your flare-gun?”
<name>Louis</name>	Louis	Gardener	Now, sitting on the floor in back and reminding himself not to turn around quickly and thump the snare drum again, [MASK] saw the Old Orchard exit coming up. At the same time, the first drops of rain hit the windshield.
<name>Richie</name>	Richie	Gardener	They were all standing chest-deep in radioactive quicksand and trading paper. It was like some crazy game of musical chairs. Of course, the courts had finally given the company permission to begin loading hot rods the month before, and [MASK] supposed that had the motherfuckers breathing a little easier.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Ev	“If they don’t know we’re in town by now, then I’m wrong about everything .. . Look! Didn’t I tell you?” A wide, rutted track wound into the woods. [MASK] bounced onto it. “There was blood on his face.”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Gardener	Then there was [MASK]’s unsettling blankness. You kept running into it like a closed door that should have been open. You’d yell at him to hand you something, and he would go right on with what he was doing. Just ... no response.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Gardener	The sling came back up and [MASK] stepped into it, holding the rope as it began to go down again. He took a final look at the battered old Electrolux and thought again: How the hell did it get out?
<name>Clayton</name>	Clayton	Bobbi	And whether it was boolsheet or not, that voice continued to insist that [MASK] was in a jam. Until he knew one way or the other for sure, he supposed he could table his personal business. As he had told himself not long ago, the ocean wasn’t going anywhere.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Bobbi	Regardless of what it was or what it was doing to [MASK] or anyone else in the immediate area, the ultimate disposition of the ship in the earth would have to be made on the basis of the world’s welfare.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Jim	“You don’t want to . . . to strike out like that, [MASK]. I advise you—we all advise you—never do it again. There are . . . uh . . . changes . . . yes, changes . . .
<name>Tupperware</name>	Tupperware	Snoopy	He headed down the slope, stopping at the last stump before rocky soil gave way to chipped and runneled bedrock. He picked up a cheap transistor radio made of yellow high-impact plastic. It looked like [MASK]. Attached to it was the board from a Sharp calculator.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Ruthie	“Maybe. He acts like he did. This . . . this halfswoon he’s in ... if that’s what it is . . . could be he did something he’s sorry for now. If so, it wasn’t his fault, [MASK].
