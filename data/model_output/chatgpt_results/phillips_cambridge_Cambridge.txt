<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Anna	Our short courtship produced great happiness on both sides, and I therefore thought it only proper to propose a marriage. [MASK], to my barely concealed delight, acquiesced. My master convened an audience with me at which he expounded upon the nature of common opinions pertaining to such a liaison.
<name>Antoinette</name>	Antoinette	Punch	The master, having received warning that such treachery might be abroad, pretended to drink the lethal potion and then observed her reaction by the minute as he went unscathed about his daily duties. Eventually [MASK] broke down screaming, sure that either a miracle had taken place or her master had by stealth become a jumby.
<name>Nurse Edith Cavell</name>	Nurse Edith Cavell	Stella	Then our conversation was terminated by the arrival of the doctor, who delivered me a gaze of such contempt that I was obliged to turn from him lest I provoke his humour to an undignified pitch. [MASK] brought me refreshment, and suggested that I might order my wife to cease her noise.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Cambridge	They then proceeded in quest of [MASK], whom they found at his hut, with his blood-stained garments still upon him, and in the act of washing his unhallowed hands. * The negroes say that no grass has ever grown in the spot where the blood dropped since the time of the murder.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Stella	Upon my return I retired swiftly to my bed-chamber, where I called [MASK] to attend to me. I asked for some thin gruel to drive out the cold for the strength was rapidly quitting my weak womanly body. This fierce headache has reduced me to a parlous state.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Isabella	The ship was one moment being tossed up towards the clouds, the next descending with such violence that she trembled for a full half-minute, beholden to Him that her planks were still joined together. Throughout this torment, [MASK] clung to my sodden hand with her weakening fingers.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Stella	She hoisted herself upwards by a few degrees. She could now see that the sky held the full shield of the moon, clean and white and pure. And then [MASK] emerged from the darkness and spirited away the basin. ‘Travelling companions?’
<name>Mr. Smith</name>	Mr. Smith	Arnold	[MASK] suggested that while our black pair completed their task we might stroll through its deserted shell. Like the greater number of West Indian houses, the cottage was built with open rafters and unglazed windows, to allow maximum circulation of air and penetration of light.
<name>Dr. Cream</name>	Dr. Cream	Punch	In this case of [MASK] the poisoner there was no legal representation on either side, which circumvented the often laborious and time-wasting process of quiz and counter-quiz, and artful cross-examination punctuated by theatrical appeals to the passions.
<name>servant</name>	servant	Stella	In common with English practices, I had expected that in the tropical family a head female servant would be employed to assist the lady in dressing, work with the needle, and attend to the bed-chamber, but clearly this [MASK]’s duties overflowed the mould.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Arnold	In the case of this witless negress, successful flight to a distant shore seemed highly unlikely. We ate in silence for a short while, until I asked [MASK] if surely there was not something else that was troubling him.
<name>Zora</name>	Zora	Stella	According to [MASK]’s testimony, the negro belief in obeah involves the possession of a variety of strange objects which are used for incantations: cats’ ears, the feet of various animals, human hair, fish bones, etc., all of which make their vital contribution to the practice of the magical art.
<name>Death</name>	Death	Fever	The beads of sweat individually spaced on her brow. [MASK] began to disfigure her ivory flesh, and then life was snatched from her just when she thought joy might finally present itself in the form of adventure. Her eyes were open, the stare clear and unglazed.
<name>Obeah</name>	Obeah	Venus	Black men too feeble to work were often turned adrift in their decay of health, and the useless women were generally reduced to advertising themselves as capable of ‘performing the rites of [MASK] as they are done in the Carib seas’.
<name>wife</name>	wife	Anna	I prayed hard to my God to forgive this blasphemer. Winter closed in and my poor wife began to take with fever. Although I was only recently exposed to snow, my [MASK] seemed to suffer even greater discomforts, added to which she was now happily quite large with child.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Emily	But not now. The head ballooning out of her body into the earth. [MASK] squashed a mosquito against her arm, brushed it to the floor, and wiped away the blood with the back of her hand. Her autumnal eccentricities.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Arnold	They unpacked in silence and began to prepare our luncheon. [MASK] and I wandered some twenty yards to the west and discovered a picturesque, shaded, though now deserted cottage, which had the great advantage of a magnificent prospect over the ocean.
<name>Zarafa</name>	Zarafa	Cambridge	* The boy who accompanied his unfortunate master fell from his donkey; but as he was unperceived by [MASK], he was enabled to make his escape into the cane-field, where he remained an unknown observer of the dreadful event.
<name>point</name>	point	Stella	At this [MASK] protested that it was the height of the afternoon, and that I should not be exposed to the vertical rays from on high, but I insisted. The arrogance of the inky wench, who had dared publicly to preside at my table, still burned within me.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Cambridge	No sooner had we stepped from the carriage than we were greeted by a young overseer who was anxious to explain how he had caught the huge negro, [MASK], purloining meat. Some words had been exchanged during which our man accused of theft apparently insulted the overseer.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Arnold	1 must bear some responsibility, for it was I who first encouraged [MASK] to delay his decision so that I might enjoy a selfish evening, free from the emotional stresses that a stem and decisive judgement would have placed upon it.
<name>Auntie</name>	Auntie	Isabella	Then, as though involved in this thundering drama, my dear [MASK] contrived to depart from this world with a theatrical flourish, so that both the tempest and her world were gone as one, and sorrow was stealthily ushered through my door.
<name>maid</name>	maid	Stella	I readily agreed and informed my bouncing black [MASK] of the impending luncheon appointment, to which purpose she immediately began to busy herself. Before I describe the dramatic events of our social interplay, it will serve to record the details of the extraordinary board that was set before us.
<name>Dr. Watson</name>	Dr. Watson	Stella	[MASK] advised me that often, in the middle of the night, a chill can take a sudden grip, and many an unknown visitor to those climes had been stricken (and worse) by the deception that in the tropical zone the temperature never descends.
<name>Desdemona</name>	Desdemona	Emily	I mounted a guard at the door of the woman, [MASK]. She was white with fear that my wife might enter and cause her harm. I assured the fair one that she had nothing to fear, and enquired if she were a Christian believer, to which she answered that she was.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Arnold	Such exquisitely fashioned clothing must, in these climes, give cause to considerable discomfort. [MASK] and I observed a cluster of men half melting under heavy, richly embroidered coats and waistcoats, and a solitary English belle clad in the thickest taffetas and satins, some embossed with gold and silver brocades.
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Happy	[MASK] is the mother who survives this harpy-trial; her issue is added joyously to the list of the slave population in the plantation-book. But sadly, her joy will not endure beyond a few weeks, for these women are soon pressed again into service and driven afield.
<name>María</name>	María	Emily	[MASK] lay in bed. She gazed up at the unceiled roof. The dead of night. Stillness. Then she listened as a lizard played beneath her window, tireless, noisy, awkward. Snatches of remembered prayers andanted their way through her head.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Stella	I then invited him to take up the seat that [MASK] had vacated, and above the noise of the black woman without I related to him the tales of the evening. The chapter which seemed to cause him the most anxiety was that which involved stationing the negro male outside my bed-chamber.
<name>June</name>	June	Emily	She felt weak and empty. Literally empty. She disliked the patronizing tone in the voice of the doctor, as though he had cured her of some terrible ailment. ‘I take it you’re not an emancipationist.’ [MASK] ran an idle hand through her hair.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Stella	I do not know if it was curiosity, or simply surprise that stirred me to agree, whereupon he nodded briskly and withdrew as quickly as he had appeared. The next on the scene was a joyful [MASK], who bustled about as though I had in some way achieved a minor success.
<name>The sergeant</name>	The sergeant	Arnold	To the first he claimed that he was not stealing, for come Sunday he intended to replace the meat with stock from his own provisions. [MASK] asked why permission was not sought to remove the meat if, as he claimed, it would presently be replaced.
<name>Yuki</name>	Yuki	Emily	But it’s said that he’ll stay on as a merchant of some sort. It’s doubtful that he’ll ever leave these parts. Strange fish.’ [MASK] lowered her eyes. The silence was peaceful. She no longer cared for the presence of the doctor.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Stella	I ushered my visitor back into the central hall where I promised I would soon engage with him. [MASK] was unable to erase the smile from her face. She took the flowers and undertook to find them a vase in which they might flourish.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Cambridge	[MASK] then adopted the manner and speech of one familiar with the conventions of the bar and claimed the status of trustee, indicating that it was a much lesser position than that of Head Driver, an office which I was astonished to hear him claim he had twice refused.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Stella	In this frame of mind 1 left the Chapel and began the long walk back to the Great House. Once there I presented myself in the kitchen, where I informed [MASK] that I was hungry. She chose to supply me with beef and bread.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Emily	I’m still here. [MASK] gestured, palms upturned, eyebrows arched. Are there no ships that might take me away? But take me away to what and to whom? She giggled. A man strung up, mouth agape, tongue protruding.
<name>Uncle Remus</name>	Uncle Remus	Arnold	Just beyond the village known as Butler’s, [MASK] drew the carriage to a halt beside a broad stream which coursed through the cane-pieces. He did so in order that I might have the opportunity to observe some negroes engaged in washing clothes.
<name>Black Dog</name>	Black Dog	Massa	‘[MASK], me bones do hurt me bad - me eyes turning in me head so.’ Such sentiments are terminated by a long and mournful howl, as the black strives to effect his lazy deceitful purpose, which is to lie at ease in the sick-house.
<name>Perjury</name>	Perjury	Arnold	It is to be greatly lamented that the dangerous practice of peijury is commonplace among negroes. [MASK] informed me that some have argued that the condition of ignorance to which the negro is deliberately reduced necessarily renders him unable fully to comprehend the serious obligations of an oath, but history apparently proves this claim false.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Arnold	[MASK] stopped briefly by the lamp-lit entrance to one such satanic den, where my ears were assaulted by fearsome curses, idiotic laughter, discordant song, and all the stumbling incoherence that accompanies the advanced stages of intoxication.
<name>Toby</name>	Toby	Stella	Without wishing to gloss over their errors, I must acknowledge that negroes appear to be generally good-humoured in the highest degree, though untempered to the civilized ways of man. This evening I took a recuperative walk in the company of my faithful [MASK].
<name>my cabin</name>	my cabin	Isabella	And, in order that I might be spared potential suffering, the captain insisted that come morning she should be removed to solitary quarters. Although reluctant, I could see that I had little choice but to comply with his wishes, and so I composed myself and returned to [MASK].
<name>Nat Turner</name>	Nat Turner	Cambridge	He asked me which decision, clearly now conscious of the double judgement in his keep. I took it upon myself to suggest that the decision over [MASK] was the more urgent of the two, for the curious behaviour of this over-confident, Bible-reading slave demanded immediate attention.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Emily	How could so much love and care be squandered on the production of a child who selfishly reaches the far side of life without travelling through this one? Like goods in a shop-window, [MASK] knew she was becoming faded by too many bright mornings.
<name>Mrs. Mooney</name>	Mrs. Mooney	Emily	In a high breathless tone she hurriedly recited it, dedicating the prayer to those, like herself, whose only journeys were uprootings. And now she recalled the day. ‘It’s doubtful that he’ll ever leave these parts. Strange fish.’ [MASK] lowered her eyes.
<name>Cambridge</name>	Cambridge	Stella	[MASK] did, however, confirm that in spite of all the barriers in his way, this Cambridge is lettered, can read his Bible, and even endeavours to teach it to his fellow blacks, which leads me to conclude that, indeed, this ancient Cambridge is no ordinary negro.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Stella	Late last night, having no doubt been informed by [MASK] of my extended residence, the negroes took it into their heads to pay me a compliment of an extremely inconvenient nature. In order to display their pleasure at my continued sojourn among them, they thought it proper to treat me to a nocturnal serenade.
<name>John</name>	John	Arnold	Eventually [MASK] spoke, but he would not look me in the eye, offering only the cropped pate of his head. He admitted that due to a virulent strain of cane-blight the sugar was not as healthy as he had hoped, and he feared for the financial returns on this year’s harvest.
<name>Pocahontas</name>	Pocahontas	Isabella	I requested such knowledge having decided that upon my return to my native land I would erect a monument for [MASK], inscribing it with all the details of her life, and sadly her death too. Now I was ready to leave.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Arnold	A formal system of law whereby any offender, irrespective of colour or quality, is meted out just punishment, seems not to have taken hold on this island. At the end of this somewhat afflicting trial, [MASK] and I decided not to wait until another negro’s fate was sealed.
<name>W. E. B. Du Bois</name>	W. E. B. Du Bois	Arnold	The vilifier of the negro remained steadfast in his denial of the assault, but he was discharged after being told that his possession of a white skin was no ground for belief in his word over the negro’s. According to [MASK] the negroes celebrated this decision for several days.
<name>Israelites</name>	Israelites	Adam	Proclaiming himself at our first meeting a son of that over-cooked race of [MASK], this bantam-cock reduced the smaller part of the audience to peals of irreverent laughter with his Drury Lane antics. I prayed hard to my God to forgive this blasphemer.
<name>Isadora</name>	Isadora	Emily	At the dead of night, [MASK] climbed from her bed. She stood naked before a mirror that was powdered with the light dust of neglect. She noted (with a resigned sigh) that the masonry had truly tumbled from all comers.
<name>Aunt Chloe</name>	Aunt Chloe	Lord	[MASK] have mercy, I no want to leave massa!’ Such sentiments are delivered with considerable affection, and more than one imploring dark clasp has been laid upon my dress to solicit my attention to the misery that would ensue should they be spumed.
<name>someone</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	someone (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	Isabella	But my stomach stood up and lay back down again, and still the fever had me in her grip. It was at this juncture that I succumbed to a real fear that I might have contracted the same distemper which carried off [MASK].
<name>Neptune</name>	Neptune	Neptune	This goddess of the deep was soon wrestled onto the deck where her bright colours were observed and admired, that is until the loss of blood caused them to fade and the cook made ready to prepare her for dinner. Other representatives of [MASK]’s family occupy us in our peregrination.
<name>Dinah</name>	Dinah	Stella	[MASK] shook her head and seemed loath to answer my questions as to the cause of this brutality. All I could obtain from her was the intelligence that the black has a history of insubordination, and that massa foolishly seeks to make him more ruly by inflicting stripes.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Stella	For this black woman a terrible ordeal was reaching its conclusion. The man dabbed at his brow and then he was finished. [MASK] retrieved the sodden and crumpled towel and withdrew herself to a far comer of the room.
<name>bulky</name>	bulky	Falstaffian	He is very ill-made, being lame in one leg, stooped in appearance, and [MASK] in girth; he had when he went away a coarse dark blue linen frock, a thick-set waistcoat, tolerably dirty leather breeches, and set about his head an old velvet jockey cap.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Emily	I have been patient. Quick, come quick. Quick. [MASK] stood before the mirror. And now sunrise. She knew that she must bear the weight of yet another day. She knew that she must endure the undignified melee of dawn.
<name>unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name.)	unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name.)	Stella	It is clear that I am in no condition to contemplate a long sea-passage. At the same time I have no wish to remain upon this plantation. In my mind I know the place to which [MASK] and I will retire until I regain my vitality.
<name>The Lady</name>	The Lady	Stella	These swarthy dependants elevate their status by prostrating themselves. [MASK] was vociferous, in defence of whom I am not sure. She spoke against these liaisons with such force that I recalled the proverbial saw that ‘the lady doth protest too much’.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Isabella	the weigher of the anchor; the buntlines, the ropes which move the body of the sail, the bunt being the body; the bowlines, those which spread out the sails and make them swell. Out on deck [MASK] and I surveyed the dingy sky.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Bom	[MASK] on the plantation, her mother had died shortly after her delivery, and her pagan father naturally spumed her. At ten years of age she was married to a man twenty years her senior. For three years this man treated her brutally while she refused to produce children.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Arnold	This we declined to do, though we did bestow upon each one of them a broad smile. Soon they would receive more tangible rewards, for [MASK] informed me that every Christmas the negro enjoys four pounds of pork and two quarters of sugar, with children under twelve receiving half allowance.
<name>ghosts</name>	ghosts	Stella	In the fatigued state that I found myself in, I acquiesced to this curious proposal, and the book-keeper took a relieved leave. His scheme appeared much superior to a night of solitude in my chamber, and certainly preferable to the fear-stricken company of [MASK].
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Stella	As soon as I bathed my face with water, and lay down upon the Holland sheet, I dropped into a repose so deep that it was only a stormy shaking from [MASK], her hands fixed firmly about my shoulders, that raised me. ‘
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Arnold	I continued, pointing out that although I suspected a woman such as myself must occasionally prove an intolerable nuisance for one such as [MASK], I was prepared to risk tarnishing my own reputation as good company if only I might provide him with a secure vessel into which to pour his well-corked grief.
<name>who</name>	who	Stella	Such a noise I never did hear. Having begun shortly after sun-down, the blacks, [MASK] informed me, might continue their revelry until the first peep of day. This being the case it was deemed judicious that I return to the Great House and take my rest.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Stella	Should be a few years before this emancipation thing takes a grip, if it ever does that is.’ [MASK] re-emerged from the shadows with a fresh pitcher of cold water. She poured some into a glass, noisily ringing the two vessels together.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Stella	[MASK], seemingly both exhausted and preoccupied with her own cogitations, informed me that we were entering the time of the rainy season, with its occasional hurricane. Then she closed her eyes. The sultriness began to give way to more windy weather, promising a most boisterous and tempestuous night.
<name>her</name>	her	Isabella	The sailors have found some difficulty in surviving their watch, and I am unhappy to report that three have already been consigned to the ocean, their hardiness expiring in these trying conditions. As for [MASK], I fear the worst. Her malady has assumed a more active appearance.
<name>Sula</name>	Sula	Christiania	Eventually, on the third night, I pulled back a comer of the blind and peered into the darkness, whereupon I observed the re-entry into the drama of my life of the arrogant black wench, [MASK].
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Emily	[MASK] caught and held one. In a high breathless tone she hurriedly recited it, dedicating the prayer to those, like herself, whose only journeys were uprootings. And now she recalled the day. ‘It’s doubtful that he’ll ever leave these parts.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Arnold	I shared some of [MASK]’s relief as we entered our carriage and prepared for the journey back towards the comparative sanity of our plantation. The convivial season of Christmas lay some weeks hence, but the spirit of goodwill was already in the air.
<name>servant</name>	servant	Stella	Within the half-hour the book-keeper arrived, ushered into my bed-chamber by a recalcitrant [MASK]. From the creased wrinkles upon his face, and the heaviness of his fids, I took it that he had been aroused from sleep.
<name>Mammy</name>	Mammy	Stella	Having advanced counsel, and indicated to me these West Indian novelties, [MASK] informed me, with what I took to be a kindly smile writ large upon her black face, that I would not be summoned for dinner until I had rested.
<name>Jane Austen</name>	Jane Austen	Isabella	Were I a poet I would compose some lines to her memory, but I am simply a lady of polite status with little talent, artistic or otherwise. I hope that one day I might persuade others to pay tribute to the greatness of [MASK].
<name>Uncle Hammer</name>	Uncle Hammer	Murderer	With his Bible. [MASK]. A slow chill rippled through her body. (‘Please keep still and stop talking. Stop talking.’) To encourage the delicate head of a child to lie peacefully in the shallow valley between her fallen breasts. But not now.
<name>Assassin</name>	Assassin	Cambridge	His soul was dark within; He lived but in the sound Of shamelessness and sin. Many a minute stole away, and [MASK] (who had concealed himself in a cane-piece, bordering the road his intended victim must necessarily pass) kept his fatal stand.
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Lord	It came to pass that the sailors and myself muttered the same prayer having both witnessed a tremendous scene of suffering. 'At last from all these horrors, [MASK], Thy mercy set us free, While in the confidence of prayer, Our souls laid hold on thee.’
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Stella	It was then that I heard a knock upon the door, and the quiet voice of my companion [MASK]. I drew back the bolt and admitted her to my chamber, whereupon I noted that she seemed equally afflicted by the events that I had recently been compelled to endure.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	obeah	As for information about [MASK], he was hardly helpful, seemingly knowing less than I had already discovered. To his mind it was simply a dark African mystery, and there was little more to say on the matter.
<name>Topsy</name>	Topsy	Massa	Her manner becoming frivolous, she then tossed her head in seeming annoyance. ‘[MASK] say I can eat at table. Why missy not like me?’ This, as you might imagine, only served to compound the insult of her presence.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Stella	Once more he took his seat, but his full attention was now held by the food. [MASK] carried out the operation of serving at table, but the normal intercourse one might expect between host and stranger was sadly lacking in this instance.
<name>the judge</name>	the judge	Arnold	They obviously assume that I am prejudiced on the side of the young overseer in this irksome dispute, but in this they are mistaken. 1 am merely waiting for [MASK] to dispense his justice, being confident that whatever decision he reaches will most likely be the correct one.
<name>Faith</name>	Faith	Anna	But after talking awhile with [MASK], and marvelling at her pure and godly thoughts, I begged my master for full and proper instruction in Christian knowledge so that I might be received into Church fellowship with both experience of the Bible and a conviction of belief.
<name>a woman</name>	a woman	Stella	These hybrid people, who hold themselves above the black, but below the white, abound throughout these island possessions as physical evidence of moral corruption. All of this I conveyed to [MASK] in the hope that she might be persuaded to share her knowledge with me, but I succeeded only in arousing her ire.
<name>Uncas</name>	Uncas	Stella	My veneration for this dusky maiden ever deepens, and by the day I grow increasingly respectful of her honesty with a frail visitor such as myself. [MASK]’s loyalty is, I am led to understand, typical of her people.
<name>Mr. Legatt</name>	Mr. Legatt	Isabella	Disconcertingly, the emotion of fear is becoming increasingly familiar to me. These past nights the sensation has seized me again, causing me to recollect the prior occasion on which I felt such trepidation. After the death of [MASK] at sea, the demon made his last assault.
<name>her</name> (There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to a female person who is experiencing sea-sickness.)	her (There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to a female person who is experiencing sea-sickness.)	Isabella	His parting advice was to inform me that sea-sickness soon masters us all. I am truly distressed to see [MASK] in such a plight and can discover nothing to give her relief. Both food and physic have been employed to little purpose.
<name>he</name>	he	Arnold	We stood together, neither one daring to breach the silence, until [MASK] cleared his throat as though to speak. But he chose to remain silent. He found the courage, I am happy to say, to make contact, and very soon we felt able to hold each other.
<name>Chinua Achebe</name>	Chinua Achebe	Stella	As a result concubinage appears to have become universal. I revealed to [MASK] that I was also aware that the highest position on which a sable damsel could set her sights was to become the mistress of a white man.
<name>Uncle Remus</name>	Uncle Remus	Arnold	But to those of us, black and white, who are familiar with plantation life, this new unease is causing deep distress. This morning, over breakfast, I chanced to mention to [MASK] that he might consider arriving at his decision before Christmas.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Stella	I thought it best not to approach the half-witted creature directly, especially as I was sure that she was unaware of being observed by me. So I called to [MASK], directed her attention to the origin of these noises, and instructed her to drive away the crazy woman.
<name>Jezebel</name>	Jezebel	Punch	The case before us involved a seventeen-year-old girl, of most disgustingly dirty appearance, originating from the plantation below our own. Her name was [MASK], a peculiar appellation which I assumed to be a fond name.
<name>She</name>	She	Stella	I was by now ready to abandon this remedial walk abroad, but [MASK] insisted that I should see something that might help to revive my ailing spirits. And of course she was correct, for indeed I have never witnessed so picturesque a scene as a negro village.
<name>Topsy</name>	Topsy	Stella	To make out either rhyme or reason was impossible, and [MASK] seemed loath to offer me assistance. By this I assumed that the songs were about massa, and were perhaps too ironical in tone to be comfortably translated. Such a noise I never did hear.
<name>Janine</name>	Janine	Emily	She noted that beauty was in the process of abandoning her, that the lined ruins of her face were telling her a story that did not please her. My God, I’m only . . . [MASK] had aged as pregnant women age.
