<name>Finnick</name>	Finnick	Uriah	I am too distracted to protest against the affection. She laughs in my ear. Someone grabs me from behind and shouts in my ear. It’s [MASK]. I can’t turn around, so I reach back and squeeze his shoulder. “Congratulations!”
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Four	As we pass the table, the woman’s body disappears, except in my memory and his. What would it be like to kill someone every time I went through my landscape? Maybe I’ll find out. But something puzzles me: These are supposed to be [MASK]’s worst fears.
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Will	My breaths come fast, and I struggle to grab the paper before anyone can read another word of it. I have to burn it; I have to destroy it; I have to. [MASK] drags me out of the room and into the hallway, his fingernails digging into my skin.
<name>Eric</name>	Eric	Four	“Dauntless-born initiates next.” I stop listening once they’re finished with us. If [MASK] isn’t trying to prove something by choosing the weak, what is he doing? I look at each person he chooses. What do we have in common?
<name>Zeke</name>	Zeke	Uriah	“And then, splatl" “Yeah, yeah,” [MASK] says. “And then our mother would boil you alive.” Hearing him talk about his mother, about his intact family, makes my chest hurt for a second, like someone pierced it with a needle.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Tori	I run. + + + “Here you go,” [MASK] says. She hands me a steaming mug that smells like peppermint. I hold it with both hands, my fingers prickling with warmth. She sits down across from me.
<name>Tris</name>	Tris	Jeanine	“Do it,” hisses a voice next to me. It is female, but harsh, like it’s cluttered with rocks and broken glass. It sounds like [MASK]. The barrel of a gun presses to my temple, a cold circle against my skin.
<name>Alina</name>	Alina	Molly	I wish I could say I felt guilty for what I did. I don’t. CHAPTER FIFTEEN Visiting Day. The second I open my eyes, I remember. My heart leaps and then plummets when I see [MASK] hobble across the dormitory, her nose purple between strips of medical tape.
<name>Tris</name>	Tris	Peter	She nudges [MASK] with her elbow. “Once a Stiff, always a Stiff.” I should ignore her. Her opinions shouldn’t matter to me. “I read an interesting article today,” she says, leaning closer to my ear.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Marcus	[MASK]?” My mother shakes her head. “That poor man. As if he needs to be reminded of his loss.” “Of his son’s betrayal, you mean?” my father says coldly. “I shouldn’t be surprised at this point.
<name>Four</name>	Four	Christina	When we walk in, the Dauntless inside stand. They applaud. They stamp their feet. They shout. The noise surrounds me and fills me. [MASK] smiles, and a second later, so do I. We look for empty seats.
<name>Tris</name>	Tris	Beatrice	I turn away as the glass shatters, and the force of the water throws my body at the ground. I gasp, swallowing water as well as air, and cough, and gasp again, and hands close around my arms, and I hear her voice. “[MASK],” she says.
<name>Coach</name>	Coach	Four	I squint to see the blackboard across the room. The space next to my name is blank—I haven’t gotten an opponent yet. “I got held up,” I say. [MASK] stands in front of the board and writes a name next to mine.
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Four	“I figured you would say that.” “You think it would be a bad idea if I sat up?” “I’ll help you.” [MASK] grips my shoulder with one hand and holds my head steady with the other as I push myself up.
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Four	But my mother would tell me that people are flawed and I should be lenient with them. And [MASK] told me to rely on my friends. I don’t know who I should rely on more, because I’m not sure who my true friends are.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Eric	He has a distinct smell—sweet and fresh, like sage and lemongrass. When he tosses and turns at night, I get a whiff of it and I know he’s having a nightmare. “I just wanted to tell you that you missed [MASK]’s announcement.
<name>Peter</name>	Peter	Molly	M G. Tris Sixth? I can’t be sixth. Beating [MASK] must have boosted my rank more than I thought it would. And losing to me seems to have lowered hers. I skip to the bottom of the list. 7. Pro, 8.41 “4.
<name>Four</name>	Four	Tobias	CHAPTER T H I RTY-TH R E E I try TO get [MASK] alone after the rankings are announced, but the crowd of initiates and members is too thick, and the force of their congratulations pulls him away from me.
<name>Eric</name>	Eric	Peter	I grab the railing next to me and haul myself to my feet. [MASK] wraps a hand around my throat and lifts me up, his thumb wedged under my chin. His hair, which is usually shiny and smooth, is tousled and sticks to his forehead.
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Tobias	I can barely hear her over the pounding in my ears. “By altering what he sees—making him confuse enemy with friend.” One of the guards pulls [MASK] off me. I gasp, drawing a rattling breath into my lungs. He is gone.
<name>Leila</name>	Leila	Drew	I ask, letting my hand drop. “I was coming back from the control room. I heard a scream.” “What did you do to them?” I say. “I deposited [MASK] at the infirmary a half hour ago,” he says.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Molly	Some of my anger has faded, but it isn’t hard to call back. All I have to do is think about how cold the air was and how loud the laughter was. Look at her. She’s a child. [MASK] stands across from me.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Tris	I don’t want to be alone, but I don’t feel like I have much of a choice. I close my eyes and pay attention to the cold stone beneath me and breathe the musty underground air. “[MASK]!” someone calls from the end of the hallway.
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Amity	It will get smaller and smaller until we see where the tracks end, the forests and fields I last saw when I was too young to appre -ciate them. The kindness of [MASK] will comfort us for a while, though we can’t stay there forever.
<name>Rowan</name>	Rowan	Peter	How do you think [MASK] and his idiot friends would have reacted if they discovered that you and I were . . .” He sighs. “You would never win. They would always call your ranking a result of my favoritism rather than your skill.”
<name>Four</name>	Four	Caleb	done that?” he asks between breaths. “Twice now,” I say. He shakes his head. When my father hits the net, [MASK] helps him across. When he stands on the platform, he leans and vomits over the side.
<name>Tris</name>	Tris	Tris	Judging by the wires connected to their heads, and their blank eyes, they are observing the simulation. Behind them is another line of chairs, all occupied now. I am the last to enter, so I don’t get one. “Hey, [MASK]!”
<name>Uriah</name>	Uriah	Peter	“Ready to go back? I think I want to put [MASK]’s hand in a bowl of warm water to make him pee tonight.” I turn away from the chasm and see movement on the right side of the Pit.
<name>Four</name>	Four	Tobias	I feel [MASK] brushing my hair back before the first simulation. I hear him telling me to be brave. I hear my mother telling me to be brave. The Dauntless soldiers turn as if moved by the same mind. Somehow I get up and start running.
<name>Jake</name>	Jake	Peter	This will be bad. I have to get out of here. Out of the corner of my eye, I see a clear path to the door. If I can duck under [MASK]’s arm and sprint toward it, I might be able to make it.
<name>Four</name>	Four	Four	“You won,” [MASK] mutters. “Stop.” I wipe the sweat from my forehead. He stares at me. His eyes are too wide; they look alarmed. “I think you should leave,” he says. “Take a walk.”
<name>Rows</name>	Rows	Aline	It is next to the fear landscape room. I walk past him without looking at him. The room is large and contains another screen, similar to the one outside. [MASK] of people sit in chairs in front of it.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Beatrice	In his reflection, his head is small and pressed in on one side, and his arm looks like it is bending backward. My reflection, however, looks small and squat. “Something big is happening, [MASK]. Something is wrong.”
<name>Tris</name>	Tris	Beatrice	“No.” I shake my head. “I’m not going anywhere without you.” She smiles. “Be brave, [MASK]. I love you.” I feel her lips on my forehead and then she runs into the middle of the street.
<name>Callum</name>	Callum	Christina	Could have been an accident.” “They found him in the middle of the chasm. You think he tripped over his shoelace and . . . whoopsies, just stumbled fifteen feet forward?” [MASK]’s hands get tighter and tighter around my arm.
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Peter	Another thing I can count on: [MASK] is not selfless. He turns his head and focuses a bright eye on me. His teeth close over his lower lip, and his breaths shake on the way out. And on the way in. And on the way out again.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Tobias	how he put his arm around me at the funeral, how he opens doors for me like I’m a girl instead of someone who could beat the crap out of him.” I laugh. Suddenly I want to tell her about [MASK] and everything that has happened between us.
<name>Tris</name>	Tris	Georgie	Did she get it after her brother died? Was the river another fear she overcame? She lowers her voice. “In the second stage of training, [MASK] got really good, really fast. He said the simulations weren’t even scary to him . . .
<name>Uriah</name>	Uriah	Will	“Yeah,” she says. “While you were off having fun, I was doing the dirty work of defending your old faction, eliminating interfaction conflict...” “Come on, you knowyou enjoyed it,” says [MASK], nudging her with his elbow.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Peter	. get ready. Looks like it might take you a while,” she says. I grunt. Trying not to bend at the waist, I fumble in the drawer under my bed for a clean shirt. Luckily [MASK] isn’t here to see me struggle.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Will	“Don’t worry about it,” says [MASK]. “It’s endearing. Look, you’re all red.” The comment only makes my face hotter. Everyone else chuckles. I force a laugh and, after a few seconds, it comes naturally.
<name>blurry</name>	blurry	Al	I drag my heavy hand up, taking the blindfold with it, and blink. The scene before me is sideways and bobs up and down. I see someone running toward us and someone running away—someone large, [MASK].
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Peter	“What?” I demand. Or I try to demand, but my voice comes out strangled and scratchy, and I have to clear my throat and say it again. “What?” [MASK] stops reading, and a few people turn around.
<name>Uriah</name>	Uriah	Uriah	[MASK] calls out from across the room. He sits with the other Dauntless-born initiates. Only four of them are left; the rest have gone through their fear landscapes already. He pats his leg. “You can sit on my lap, if you want.”
<name>Ana</name>	Ana	Tris	Looking him in the eye is a challenge. It’s my choice. Heat rushes into my cheeks. What will happen when this tension breaks? But he just says, “Careful, [MASK].” My stomach drops like I just swallowed a stone.
<name>Haymitch</name>	Haymitch	Eric	[MASK]’s false smiles, his artificial words, his twisted ideals—they make me want to be sick. “He wasn’t brave! He was depressed and a coward and he almost killed me! Is that the kind of thing we respect here?”
<name>Tris</name>	Tris	Tris	“Go ahead, [MASK],” he says softly. “I understand. It’s okay.” My eyes burn. “No,” I say, my throat so tight it aches. I shake my head. “I’ll give you ten seconds!”
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Tori	Clumsily I sit in the chair and recline, putting my head on the headrest. The lights hurt my eyes. [MASK] busies herself with the machine on my right. I try to focus on her and not on the wires in her hands. “Why the hawk?”
<name>Tris</name>	Tris	Uriah	We get there in under a minute, and [MASK] flips on a light switch. It looks the same as the last time I was there: targets on one end of the room, a table with guns on the other. “They just keep these lying around?”
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Caleb	a voice behind me says. I turn, and [MASK] stands behind me, a book in hand. His hair has grown out so it flips at his ears, and he wears a blue T-shirt and a pair of rectangular glasses.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Marcus	I swing my arm as fast as I can, my shoulder socket burning from the sudden motion, and the belt strikes [MASK]’s shoulder. He yells and lunges at me with outstretched hands, with fingernails that look like claws.
<name>Haymitch</name>	Haymitch	Christina	“Good,” I say. “Thanks.” “And don’t pay attention to [MASK]. Your face doesn’t look that bad.” He smiles a little. “I mean, it looks good. It always looks good. I mean—you look brave.
<name>Candor</name>	Candor	Candor	He’s grinning, and I’m not sure I like the look in his eyes. “Maybe you were cut out for [MASK],” he says, “because you’re a terrible liar.” “I think my aptitude test ruled that one out pretty well.”
<name>Four</name>	Four	Four	I can’t even think of life as a Dauntless. All I can think about is making it through initiation. “We will go over technique today, and tomorrow you will start to fight each other,” says [MASK]. “So I recommend that you pay attention.
<name>Alaric</name>	Alaric	Four	[MASK] took it down yesterday so he could calculate our stage one rankings. “There you are!” I say. “Your parents were looking for you. Did they find you?” He shakes his head. I sit down next to him on the bed.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Uriah	[MASK] pulls up his shirt. There is a gun stuck under the waistband of his pants, right under a tattoo. I stare at the tattoo, trying to figure out what it is, hut then he lets his shirt fall. “Okay,” he says.
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Uriah	He points across the room at a boy sitting in the doorway with his legs dangling out of the car. He is slight and short and looks nothing like [MASK], apart from his coloring. “You don’t get to know. That ruins the surprise! ”
<name>He</name>	He	Uriah	In the other direction is the city, and in many ways it is the same, lifeless and with limits I do not know. [MASK] points to something. Attached to one of the poles on top of the tower is a steel cable as thick as my wrist.
<name>Tris</name>	Tris	Erudite	“Okay?” He nods. I don’t even know how I’ll explain it later. I don’t even know how to think straight. But I do know how [MASK] will get us to fight. CHAPTER T H I RTY-TH R E E
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Christina	He still cares too much about me. “Yeah, I think we’d all like to know the answer to that question,” says [MASK] in a singsong voice. “What did he say to you?” “Nothing.” I shake my head.
<name>Four</name>	Four	Four	I close my eyes. I don’t expect [MASK] to reassure me, and he makes no effort to, but I feel better standing here than I did out there among the people who are my friends, my faction. I press my forehead to his shoulder.
<name>She</name>	She	Christina	This is going to be impossible.” “No, it isn’t,” she says. [MASK] reaches for his hand and laces her fingers with his, like it’s the most natural thing in the world.
<name>Four</name>	Four	Four	There is a computer screen on a desk in the corner. “Sit,” [MASK] says. He squeezes my arms and pushes me forward. “What’s the simulation?” I say, trying to keep my voice from shaking. I don’t succeed.
<name>Zeke</name>	Zeke	Caleb	“Please stop fighting,” [MASK] interrupts, his voice chiding. “We have more important things to do right now.” I keep climbing, my cheeks hot. A few months ago I 4-66 would not have dared to snap at my father.
<name>Tobias</name>	Tobias	Tobias	His voice is calm and quiet as he replies, “No.” In seconds we are surrounded. [MASK] helps me up, supporting my weight. I have trouble focusing through the pain. Dauntless soldiers surround us and point their guns.
<name>Rowan</name>	Rowan	Caleb	“At least I know what I’m a part of, [MASK]. You are choosing to ignore what we’ve known all our lives— these people are arrogant and greedy and they will lead you nowhere.” His voice hardens.
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Christina	He waves it away. “Where did you go?” asks [MASK]. “Everyone else went back to the dormitory.” “I just wandered around,” I say. “I was too nervous to talk to everyone else about it.”
<name>Tris</name>	Tris	Rita	[MASK]—” I stand and look over the edge. There is a body on the pavement below us; a girl, her arms and legs bent at awkward angles, her hair spread in a fan around her head. My stomach sinks and I stare at the railroad tracks.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Tris	I switched from gray sneakers to black sneakers a week ago, but the gray shoes are buried in one of my drawers. I can’t bear to throw them away, even though I know it’s foolish to be attached to sneakers, like they can bring me home. “[MASK]?”
<name>Will</name>	Will	Will	“Statistically speaking,” the Erudite boy next to me— his name is [MASK]—says, grinning at me, “you should have hit the target at least once by now, even by accident.” He is blond, with shaggy hair and a crease between his eyebrows.
<name>Tris</name>	Tris	Christina	“Hey!” I say. “Let me out of here!” The water slides up my bare calves as it rises, cool and soft. I hit the glass harder. “Get me out of here!” I stare at [MASK].
<name>Four</name>	Four	Four	“The first lesson you will learn from me is to keep your mouth shut. Got that?” She nods. [MASK] starts toward the shadow at the end of the tunnel. The crowd of initiates moves on in silence. “What a jerk,” she mumbles.
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Peter	I ball up my outer shirt and look over my shoulder, at [MASK]. I throw the ball of fabric at him as hard as I can, my jaw clenched. It hits him in the chest. He stares at me. I hear catcalls and shouts behind me.
<name>Thalia</name>	Thalia	Peter	+ + + I can’t fight in a dress, so I get myself some new clothes from the Pit before I walk to the training room for my last fight. I hope it’s with [MASK]. “Hey, where were you this morning?”
<name>Christina</name>	Christina	Christina	the Candor girl who helped me asks briskly. She is tall, with dark brown skin and short hair. Pretty. I nod. “I’m [MASK],” she says, offering me her hand. I haven’t shaken a hand in a long time either.
<name>masked</name>	masked	Divergent	Does it have something to do with me being [MASK], with me being in danger, or is it something else? I sigh. I have a thousand questions, and she left before I could ask any of them.
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Stupid	I remember his fingers on my hip again, how they kept me from falling, and I almost miss a step on the ladder. [MASK]. Biting my lip, I make it to the top and stand on the roof of the Hancock building.
<name>Tris</name>	Tris	Four	“Let’s divide up transfers first, shall we?” I tilt my head back. If they’re picking us, I will be chosen last; I can feel it. “You go first,” [MASK] says.
<name>Maxon</name>	Maxon	Marcus	“I like how you look. You’re deadly smart. You’re brave. And even though you found out about [MASK] . . .” His voice softens. “You aren’t giving me that look. Like I’m a kicked puppy or something.”
<name>Tris</name>	Tris	Tris	“Yes, while the rest of you were twiddling your thumbs, [MASK] climbed the Ferris wheel to look for the other team,” he says. “What do we do now, then?” asks one of the Dauntless-born initiates through a yawn.
<name>Zeke</name>	Zeke	Tobias	After a moment they all stir, so I know they’re still alive, and the Dauntless soldiers advance. A cluster of black around my brother. “[MASK],” I say. He presses the screen again, and everyone on the first floor goes still.
<name>Eaton</name>	Eaton	Marcus	“The second you orchestrated an attack against innocent people.” “Innocent people.” jeanine laughs. “I find that a little funny, coming from you. I would expect [MASK]’s son to understand that not all those people are innocent.”
<name>Tori</name>	Tori	Tori	Without a faction, we have no purpose and no reason to live. I shake my head. I can’t think like this. I have to stay calm. Finally the door opens, and [MASK] walks back in. I grip the arms of the chair.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Eric	He looks from her to me and says, “Quit it. Both of you.” Part of me wishes that he hadn’t stopped her. A fight would be a welcome distraction, especially now that [MASK] is climbing onto a box next to the railing.
<name>Tris</name>	Tris	Caleb	[MASK] eventually nods. I approach one of the fallen guards and take his gun, keeping my eyes away from the injury that killed him. My head pounds. I haven’t eaten; I haven’t slept; I haven’t sobbed or screamed or even paused for a moment.
<name>Reuben</name>	Reuben	Dauntless	“Insane, no,” I say. “[MASK], yes. If I see him. I’ll tell him you’re looking for him.” My mother, I see, wears the same smile I do.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Will	“Okay.” I smile. As we walk toward the Pit, I repeat the line [MASK] quoted to myself so I don’t forget it. I believe in ordinary acts of bravery, in the courage that drives one person to stand up for another.
<name>Four</name>	Four	Tobias	His eyebrows draw in. He stands. He looks confused. He raises his gun. “Drop your weapon,” he says. “[MASK],” I say, “you’re in a simulation.” “Drop your weapon,” he repeats.
<name>Eric</name>	Eric	Eric	“Climb over the railing,” says [MASK] again, pronouncing each word slowly. “If you can hang over the chasm for five minutes, I will forget your cowardice. If you can’t, I will not allow you to continue initiation.”
<name>Al</name>	Al	Drew	I shouldn’t be able to think of anything but initiation. The simulations should disturb me more; they should break my mind, as they have been doing to most of the other initiates. [MASK] doesn’t sleep—he just stares at the wall, curled in a ball.
<name>Marcus</name>	Marcus	Abelt	[MASK] is curled around one of his fists. Slowly he unwinds it from his fingers. “This is for your own good,” he says, and his voice echoes a dozen times. A dozen Marcuses press into the circle of light, all holding the same belt, with the same blank expression.
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Four	I haven’t seen a blue sky in a longtime, so when it spreads out above me, I feel the breath catch in my lungs and the effect is dizzying. Then the wind starts. It blows so hard I have to lean against [MASK] to stay on my feet.
<name>Tobias</name>	Tobias	Caleb	“We find the computers that control the simulation and destroy the data,” I say. “The program. Everything.” “Easier said than done,” [MASK] says. “It could be anywhere. We can’t just appear at the Erudite compound and start poking around.”
<name>James</name>	James	Will	.. what kind of person am I? Across the room, [MASK] stands with a woman in a blue dress. She doesn’t look old enough to be his mother, but she has the same crease between her eyebrows as he does, and the same golden hair.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Peter	“Therefore each stage of initiation is intended to prepare you in a different way. The first stage is primarily physical; the second, primarily emotional; the third, primarily mental.” “But what. . [MASK] yawns through his words.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Abnegation	At school we try not to draw attention to ourselves, but once were home, the games and jokes start. My natural tendency toward sarcasm is still not appreciated. Sarcasm is always at someone’s expense. Maybe it’s better that [MASK] wants me to suppress it.
<name>Haymitch</name>	Haymitch	Stiffs	“Now I’ve got [MASK], too?” “It must be because you’re so approachable,” I say flatly. “You know. Like a bed of nails.” He stares at me, and I don’t look away.
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Will	They’re calling for an overthrow of the entire government.” [MASK] laughs. “No, they’re not. They’re arrogant and dull, and that’s why I left them, but they aren’t revolutionaries.
<name>He</name>	He	Tori	“I am your mother and I want to keep you safe.” “Is this because I’m a—” I start to say, but she presses her hand to my mouth. “Don’t say that word,” she hisses. “Ever.” So [MASK] was right.
<name>Four</name>	Four	Peter	To tell him that the only reason that I’m doing well is that there’s something different about my brain. [MASK] turns slowly, every limb infused with tension. A glare would have been less threatening than the look he gives me—a look of pure hatred.
