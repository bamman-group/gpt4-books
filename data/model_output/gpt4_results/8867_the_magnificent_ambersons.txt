<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	George	“I don't see why he should be,” [MASK] said. “I didn't say anything about him. He didn't seem to me to be hurt--seemed perfectly cheerful. What made you think he was hurt?” “I know him!”
<name>She</name>	She	Fanny	I, and if you were so sure you were wiser than I, why did you just stand around with your hands hanging down, and let me go ahead? You could have stopped it if it was wrong, couldn't you?” [MASK] shook her head.
<name>John</name>	John	George	“Just--just once,” she whispered, and then was still. She seemed to have fallen asleep, and [MASK] moved to go, but a faint pressure upon his fingers detained him, and he remained, with her hand still pressed against his cheek.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Lucy	She said they were building.” “They did. It's all finished, and they've been in it a month. [MASK] is so capable; she keeps house exquisitely. It's small, but oh, such a pretty little house!”
<name>Harney</name>	Harney	George	“A whole lot of things. Every minute filled up.” “All right,” said [MASK]. “The snow's fine for sleighing: I'll come for you in a cutter at ten minutes after two.” “I can't possibly go.”
<name>Jeff</name>	Jeff	George	Or do you really hate your Aunt Fanny so much that you want to--that you want to--” She choked and sought for her handkerchief; suddenly she began to cry. “Oh, see here,” [MASK] said.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	George	“She doesn't mean what she said, and neither she nor any one else gives the slightest credit to such foolishness--no one in the world!” [MASK] gulped, and wet lines shone suddenly along his lower eyelids. “They--they'd better not!”
<name>John</name>	John	Eugene	He is!” “There, I think I agree with you,” [MASK] said grimly, and in his eyes there was a steady light of anger that was to last. “Yes, I think I agree with you about that!”
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Georgie	That will be a great deal better. You remind me of it, along in September--or October. We'll see what can be done.” He rubbed his hands cheerfully. “We'll see what can be done about it then, [MASK].
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	George	She felt your father's death terrifically, of course, but it seems to me she's had a fairly comfortable life-up to now--if she was disposed to take it that way.” “But 'up to now' is the important thing,” [MASK] said.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Lucy	he called after her. “I'll be careful about proposing to [MASK]!” These were but roughish spots in a summer that glided by evenly and quickly enough, for the most part, and, at the end, seemed to fly.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	George	[MASK] stared at her for a moment in perplexity, then perceiving that her intention was satirical, “Girls really ought to go to a man's college,” he said--“just a month or two, anyhow; It'd take some of the freshness out of 'em!”
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	George	[MASK] had a sudden intuition, as there flickered into his mind the picture of a street-crossing and two absorbed ladies almost run down by a fast horse. “You and she have been talking about it to-day!” he cried.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	George	“Well, I'm unable to see, even if she's yours, that a young man is morally called upon to give up a career at the law to provide his aunt with a favourable opportunity to play bridge whist!” “No,” [MASK] agreed.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Fanny	And, as the pressure of people forced [MASK] and himself against the white marble mantelpiece, he pursued this train of cheery thought, shouting, “Right here's where the Major's wife was laid out at her funeral. They had her in a good light from that big bow window.”
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Fanny	“Whether it mightn't be better, under the circumstances,” he said, “if this family were not so intimate with the Morgan family--at least for a time. It might be better--” [MASK] stared at him incredulously.
<name>He</name>	He	Eugene	I don't claim anything for the power; I only know I have it--and some ways it ain't always such a blessing, neither, I can tell you!” [MASK] did not press an investigation of her meaning, but said vaguely, “I suppose not.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Fanny	This mathematical computation was concerned with her future income to be produced by the electric headlight, now just placed on the general market; but [MASK] was ashamed to be discovered doing anything except mourning, and hastily pushed the sheets aside, even as she looked over her shoulder to greet her hollow-eyed visitor.
<name>Desperately</name>	Desperately	Whereupon	Then, to cover his awkwardness, he coughed, and even to his own rosy ears his cough was ostentatiously a false one. [MASK], seeking to be plausible, he coughed again, and instantly hated himself: the sound he made was an atrocity.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	And”--he	“Take the whole thing as a joke--and in the meantime, if you haven't had your breakfast--” “I haven't!” “Then if I were you I'd go in and gets some. [MASK] paused, becoming serious--“and
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	George	I always think: 'Oh, how you're going to catch it'!” “[MASK]!” “Oh, yes,” he said. “Life's most ingenious: it's got a special walloping for every mother's son of 'em!”
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Fanny	[MASK] and he had one or two arguments in which her fierceness again astonished and amused him. “You drop your criticisms of your relatives,” she bade him, hotly, one day, “and begin thinking a little about your own behaviour!
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucy	[MASK] stroked his hair, which was still almost as dark as her own. “You liked her pretty well once, I guess, papa.” “I do still,” he said quietly. “She's lovely--lovely!
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Isabel	“I don't want anything to eat!” he said savagely. And he began to pace the floor, taking care not to go near [MASK]'s door, and that his footsteps were muffled by the long, thick hall rug.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Eugene	“I see,” said [MASK]. “So that's why they named the place 'They-Couldn't-Help-It'!” “It must have been.” “And so you're going to stay here in your garden,” he said musingly.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	George	The story will grow as it spreads and--” [MASK] unfolded his arms to strike his right fist into his left palm. “But do you suppose I'm going to tolerate such things?” he shouted. “What do you suppose I'll be doing?”
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Fanny	I don't agree with some of the things he implies. You've always been unselfish--nobody knows that better than your mother. When [MASK] was left with nothing, you were so quick and generous to give up what really should have come to you, and--”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Amelia	I'm sorry I gave them the opportunity of making a polished refusal. [MASK]'s letter was about half in Italian; she couldn't remember enough ways of saying no in English. One has to live quite a long while to realize there are people like that!
<name>George</name>	George	George	“But [MASK] isn't saving. He's reckless, and even if he is arrogant and conceited and bad-tempered, he's awfully generous.” “Oh, he's an Amberson,” said her father.
<name>money</name>	money	Amberson	I guess he gets plenty of toadying; but there's certainly a lot of people that are glad to express their opinions about him.” “What's the matter with him?” “Too much [MASK], I suppose, for one thing.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	George	“Your Uncle [MASK] always used to, and so did father, for years; but they both stopped quite a long time ago. Unless there's some special occasion, it seems to me we don't see it done any more, except on the stage and in the magazines.”
<name>Wallingford</name>	Wallingford	Georgie	A disgusted hardware dealer of middle age, one of those who hungered for [MASK]'s downfall, was thus driven back upon the sidewalk to avoid being run over, and so far forgot himself as to make use of the pet street insult of the year: “Got 'ny sense!
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Amelia	Do you really love your Aunt [MASK] so much that you want to please her? Or do you really hate your Aunt Fanny so much that you want to--that you want to--” She choked and sought for her handkerchief; suddenly she began to cry.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	George	Submit to gossip and you kill it; fight it and you make it strong. People will forget almost any slander except one that's been fought.” “Is that all?” [MASK] asked. “I suppose so,” his uncle murmured sadly.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	George	“Work?” “No.” “Well, what's the answer?” Then, with an intentional outbreak of mirth, the answer was given by two loudly whispering voices together: “A stuck-up boarder!” [MASK] didn't care.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucy	He seized that small, troubled hand. “[MASK],” he said huskily. “Don't you know that I love you?” “Yes--I do.” “Don't you love me?” “Yes--I do.”
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	George	This time, I'm going away. That's what I wanted to tell you. I'm going away tomorrow night--indefinitely.” She nodded sunnily. “That's nice for you. I hope you'll have ever so jolly a time, [MASK].”
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Georgie	And he waved his hand, heroically dismissing the tandem. The Major's distress became obvious. “[MASK], I'd like to, but--but I've an idea tandems are dangerous to drive, and your mother might be anxious.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Eugene	Very pretty. She is so anxious for you to understand. She hopes and hopes you will. Someone else wants to speak to you. This is a man. He says--” “I don't want to speak to any one else,” said [MASK] quickly.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Eugene	At his mother's funeral and at the Major's he had been conscious that [MASK] was there: though he had afterward no recollection of seeing him, and, while certain of his presence, was uncertain how he knew of it.
<name>John</name>	John	Lucy	“I wonder, [MASK], if history's going on forever repeating itself,” he said. “I wonder if this town's going on building up things and rolling over them, as poor father once said it was rolling over his poor old heart.
<name>Neptune</name>	Neptune	Neptune	Soot streaks and a thousand pits gave [MASK] the distinction, at least, of leprosy, which the mermaids associated with him had been consistent in catching; and his trident had been so deeply affected as to drop its prongs.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	George	He owns all these buildings now, you know.” “Didn't you, when you were here? Like uncle, like nephew.” “Don't tell [MASK] you think he's like me. Just at this time we should be careful of the young gentleman's feelings.”
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Fanny	“I'm confident that is a pretty conservative investment of its kind, and all the chances are with us, but you must be careful to leave yourself enough to fall back on, in case anything should go wrong.” [MASK] deceived him.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	George	Well, I'm not a boy any longer. I'm a man, and a man has a right to demand a totally different treatment.” “Why has he?” “What?” “I don't seem to be able to understand you at all, [MASK].
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Isabel	When he had hurt her it had been accidental; and his remorse for such an accident was always adequate compensation--and more--to [MASK]. But now he had done a rough thing to her; and he did not repent; rather he was the more irritated with her.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	George	What he felt was, that if he interrupted the scene in his grandfather's room, just at this time, one of the three gentlemen engaging in it might speak to him in a peremptory manner (in the heat of the moment) and [MASK] saw no reason for exposing his dignity to such mischances.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Isabel	And as [MASK] looked inquiring, he laughed, and she saw that she was the “only one person.” His implication was justified, moreover, and she knew it. She blushed charmingly. “Which is it puts the lines on the faces?”
<name>Samuel</name>	Samuel	George	[MASK] looked at it briefly and turned back, rumbling with an interior laugh of some grimness. The house was white no longer; nothing could be white which the town had reached, and the town reached far beyond the beautiful white house now.
<name>the car</name>	the car	Pendennis	Didn't you notice, when you took [MASK] out, yesterday?” “Oh, that will be all right, sir. My mother can lend me her man.” “Can she?” The old gentleman smiled faintly. “I wonder--” He paused.
<name>Emmeline</name>	Emmeline	Amelia	Therefore he turned from the stairway, and going quietly into the library, picked up a magazine--but he did not open it, for his attention was instantly arrested by his Aunt [MASK]'s voice, speaking in the next room.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	George	he cried. “You were talking about it with her not two hours ago. Do you deny it?” “I--” “Do you deny it?” “No!” “All right,” said [MASK]. “That's enough!”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Georgie	an embittered labourer complained, one day, as [MASK] rode the pony straight through a pile of sand the man was sieving. “I will when I grow up,” the undisturbed child replied. “I guess my grandpa owns it now, you bet!”
<name>Eugene</name>	Eugene	George	It seems to me the finest house I've seen in this part of the country.” [MASK] was outraged by an enthusiasm so ignorant--not ten minutes ago they had passed the Amberson Mansion. “Is that a sample of your taste in architecture?”
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	George	[MASK] inquired, not because he misunderstood, but because he wished to prolong the pleasant neighbourliness of whispering. “As your mother! Think of her doing that! She's a darling! And papa”--here she imperfectly repressed a tendency to laugh--“papa looks as if he were either going to explode or utter loud sobs!”
<name>Jonas</name>	Jonas	George	[MASK] was puzzled. “What do you mean: time being like the sky and smoke?” “I mean the things that we have and that we think are so solid--they're like smoke, and time is like the sky that the smoke disappears into.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	George	When the young couples seated themselves in chairs against the walls, round three sides of the room, for the cotillion, [MASK] joined a brazen-faced group clustering about the doorway--youths with no partners, yet eligible to be “called out” and favoured.
<name>India</name>	India	George	She fanned herself, looking out of the open window near her. “Of course, if you want to make more trouble in the family than we've already got, [MASK], with your eavesdropping, you can go and repeat--”
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	George	[MASK] walked through the begrimed crowds of hurrying strangers and saw no face that he remembered. Great numbers of the faces were even of a kind he did not remember ever to have seen; they were partly like the old type that his boyhood knew, and partly like types he knew abroad.
<name>Millicent</name>	Millicent	Fanny	[MASK] stamped her foot. “You little fool!” she cried. “You awful little fool!” “I decline--” “Decline, my hat! Your father's a sick man, and you--” “He doesn't seem so to me.”
<name>Undine</name>	Undine	George	“May I ask what you think I ought to have done?” “Nothing.” “'Nothing?” [MASK] echoed, mocking bitterly “I suppose you think I mean to let my mother's good name--” “Your mother's good name!”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Georgie	and then we'll play euchre & nickel a corner, what we're here for. This meeting will now come to ord--” [MASK] addressed the members. “I'd like to know who got up this thing in the first place,” he said.
<name>Jeff</name>	Jeff	George	Well, I think it's time all their sort found out that three generations can mean just as much out here as anywhere else. That's the way I feel about it, and let me tell you I feel it pretty deeply!” “But what are you going to do, [MASK]?”
<name>Pol</name>	Pol	George	“Well,” said [MASK] finally, “I must say you don't seem to be much of a prattler. They say it's a great way to get a reputation for being wise, never saying much. Don't you ever talk any?”
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	George	But it comes pretty heavily on me, and I feel a certain responsibility.” “Not at all. I'm taking the responsibility.” And [MASK] smiled with one corner of his mouth. “She's not your aunt, you know, sir.”
<name>Inspector</name>	Inspector	George	Then he said, “I should like to revert to the questions I was asking you, if you don't mind.” “No, [MASK]. I think we'd better--” “Your father is a business man--”
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	George	And I don't mind your being such a lofty person at all. I think it's ever so interesting--but papa's a great man!” “Is he?” [MASK] decided to be good-natured “Well, let us hope so.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	George	I tease her a good deal.” “What about?” “Oh, anything handy--whatever's easy to tease an old maid about.” “Doesn't she mind?” “She usually has sort of a grouch on me,” laughed [MASK].
<name>Mildred</name>	Mildred	Fanny	He stopped in amazement: no chair had been left in the kitchen, but [MASK] gave a despairing glance around her, in search of one, then sank abruptly, and sat flat upon the floor. “You're going to leave me in the lurch!”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	George	“Your uncle is going.” The library doors were heard opening, and a moment later there came the sound of the front door closing. [MASK] moved toward the head of the stairs, then stood listening; but the house was silent.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	George	And time means nothing--nothing at all--so in a little while we'll all be back in the sun together. I wish--” He moved his hand uncertainly as if reaching for something, and [MASK] jumped up. “Did you want anything, grandfather?”
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Amberson	“They seem so eager and so confident, all these boys--it's touching. But of course youth doesn't know it's touching.” [MASK] coughed. “No, it doesn't seem to take itself as pathetic, precisely!
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Amberson	What have I done that wasn't honourable and right? Do you think these riffraff can go about bandying my mother's name--” “They can now,” said [MASK]. “I don't know if they could before, but they certainly can now!”
<name>Mrs. Touchett</name>	Mrs. Touchett	Isabel	“Nothing's the matter.” This easy declaration naturally failed to carry great weight, and [MASK] went on, in her troubled voice, “It seems so queer, especially when you feel as you do about his daughter.”
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Fanny	You tell him the doctor said she had to be quiet and peaceful. That's what he did say, isn't it?” [MASK] acquiesced tearfully. “I'll tell him. I'll tell him the doctor said she was to be kept very quiet.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Lucy	“Yes, I will,” she laughed. “You won't be very late.” “Well--it's my last night.” “But I know [MASK], and she knows I want to see you, too, your last night.
<name>Winnemucca</name>	Winnemucca	Vendonah	There was a bad Indian chief lived in the grove before the white settlers came. He was the worst Indian that ever lived, and his name was--it was '[MASK].' That means 'Rides-Down-Everything'.” “What?”
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	George	Its oppression seemed congenial to [MASK]; he sat upon the copestone of the stone parapet, his back against a stone pilaster; his attitude not comfortable, but rigid, and his silence not comfortable, either, but heavy.
<name>Madeline</name>	Madeline	Lucy	Surprise and displeasure were intentionally visible upon the countenance of her companion; and he permitted a significant period of silence to elapse before making any response. “[MASK],” he said, finally, with cold dignity, “I should like to ask you a few questions.”
<name>Millicent</name>	Millicent	Isabel	He can be charming, and he's certainly stunning looking, if only--” “Let the 'if only' go, dear,” [MASK] suggested good-naturedly. “Let's talk about that dinner you thought I should--” “I?”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	George	You want 'em to send for some special doctor?” “No.” [MASK]'s lips formed the word. “Or to take you to some private hospital?” “Tell them to take me,” he said faintly, “to the City Hospital.”
<name>Mrs. Stringham</name>	Mrs. Stringham	George	You say everybody is talking. Is she one?” “Oh, she may have intimated--” “I'm asking you: Has she ever spoken of it to you?” “She's a very kind, discreet woman, [MASK]; but she may have intimated--”
<name>Edison</name>	Edison	Eugene	“No, indeed! These have rubber tires blown up with air--pneumatic! And they aren't so high; they're very easy to get into, and the engine's in front--[MASK] thinks that's a great improvement.
<name>John</name>	John	Isabel	“Well, it's seemed--as if--as if--” [MASK] began timidly. “It did seem--At least, you haven't looked at any other girl, ever since they came here and--and certainly you've seemed very much interested in her.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	George	She was lifted from the chair into a carriage, and seemed a little stronger as they drove home; for once she took her hand from [MASK]'s, and waved it feebly toward the carriage window. “Changed,” she whispered. “So changed.”
<name>Chopin</name>	Chopin	Chopin	She played no marche funebre upon her piano, even though [MASK]'s romantic lamentation was then at the top of nine-tenths of the music-racks in the country, American youth having recently discovered the distinguished congeniality between itself and this deathless bit of deathly gloom.
<name>Milly</name>	Milly	Isabel	It does really seem to already! He's just called in the door to say he's waiting. Don't smoke too much, darling boy. Devotedly, your mother [MASK]. But she did not keep her husband there for the six weeks she anticipated.
<name>Wemmick</name>	Wemmick	George	“I don't know whether [MASK] would let my admirers place a tablet to mark the spot, or not. He owns all these buildings now, you know.” “Didn't you, when you were here? Like uncle, like nephew.”
<name>Millicent</name>	Millicent	Eugene	But, oh, my dear, won't you be strong--such a little short strength it would need! Don't strike my life down twice, dear--this time I've not deserved it. [MASK].
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Fanny	“I suppose you don't know why father doesn't want to go tonight,” he said solemnly. “You're his only sister, and yet you don't know!” “He never wants to go anywhere that I ever heard of,” said [MASK].
<name>Cap'n</name>	Cap'n	George	[MASK] became vociferous with laughter, and coming up at his trotter's best gait, snow spraying from runners and every hoof, swerved to the side of the road and shot by, shouting, “Git a hoss! Git a hoss! Git a hoss!”
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Isabel	The journey had fatigued [MASK], she ate nothing, but sat to observe with tired pleasure the manifestations of her son's appetite, meanwhile giving her sister-in-law a brief summary of the events of commencement.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Fanny	He had lived for years in the same house with his Aunt [MASK], and it now appeared that during all those years he had been thus intimately associating with a total stranger. Never before had he met the passionate lady with whom he had just held a conversation in the hall.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Fanny	[MASK] did not reply at once, and when she did, her voice was almost inaudible, but much more reproachful than plaintive. “I hardly think I'd want any one to get the notion he'd pleased me just now. It hardly seems time, yet--to me.”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	George	He found the doctor standing with the nurse in the hall; and, telling them that his mother was drowsing now, [MASK] went back to his own room, where he was startled to find his grandfather lying on the bed, and his uncle leaning against the wall.
<name>John</name>	John	George	And I think your mother likes him better than she likes any man outside her own family, and that he interests her more than anybody else--and 'always has.' And that's all there is to it, except--” “Except what?” [MASK] asked quickly, as he paused.
<name>Lucetta</name>	Lucetta	George	In fact, encouraged by the two older gentlemen, the entire party, with one exception, decided that the episode was after all a merry one, and began to laugh about it. But [MASK] was glummer than the December twilight now swiftly closing in.
<name>Stebbins</name>	Stebbins	Ambersons	'Carts' they call two of 'em--'way up in the air they are--too high for me! I guess they got every new kind of fancy rig in there that's been invented. And harness--well, everybody in town can tell when [MASK] are out driving after dark, by the jingle.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucy	It's your father's idea that I ought to go into business and that you oughtn't to be engaged to me until I do.” [MASK] gave a start, her denial was so quick. “No! I've never once spoken to him about it.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucy	“About time I knew that! You forget my being so fresh about your father, will you? Of course he's a distinguished looking man, in a way.” [MASK] was still serious. “In a way?'” she repeated.
