<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Joe	[MASK] took off his anorak and dropped it on the floor. Then his jersey and his shirt. Even his vest was wet. It had holes all round the bottom where he kept pulling it down and his fingers had worn their way through the woolly material.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Joe	" ‘Why not?’ asked [MASK] with interest. The question was ignored. ‘I’ll not write. You write and tell him that if you want to. Tell him he’s not welcome in his own home.’ ‘It’s not that.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Joe	His body had become a dead weight which he dragged across the room and down the passage to the door. [MASK] stooped down and picked up the broken pieces of china. The sound of the dragging steps, the heavy breath filled his throat and chest with hate.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Joe	‘Did you know the song I sang?’ ‘My father used to sing it. He didn’t have a voice like you though. He used to crack on the high notes.’ ‘I think,’ said [MASK], ‘we should go home.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Brendan	She took his clothes from him and festooned them like Christmas decorations round the fire. Steam began to rise from them, and the smell of wet wool. [MASK] was sitting in the armchair, his legs stretched out in front of him, as if he owned the place.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Joe	[MASK] laughed. ‘What did she say?’ ‘Wipe the little brat’s nose yourself if you’re so fussy.’ ‘I don’t believe you.’ The thought offended him slightly. He frowned.
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Joe	‘I have your tea waiting ...’ ‘Were they here?’ His mother got up and went over to the oven, [MASK] cut the bread in half and stuck the two pieces together to make a sandwich.
<name>friend</name>	friend	Joe	‘Goodbye, [MASK]. It was nice meeting you.’ $ £ $ His father was up and sitting by the kitchen table when he got home. ‘Were you kept in again?’ ‘No.’ ‘You took your time then.’
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Mam	‘Why don’t you go and play with your friends when you come out?’ ‘[MASK] doesn’t like me to. It’s because of. .. well... you know, the way things are.’ ‘You might be lured to the barricades.’

Mam	‘Monday.’ ‘That’s great.’ £‘It’s driving here and there, [MASK]. I may be away the odd ight.’ ‘Yes,’ was all she said. The conversation fizzled out. Knives and forks rattled and scraped.
<name>Mrs. Joe</name>	Mrs. Joe	Joe	‘I could do with a cup of tea.’ [MASK] brought the kettle out to the scullery and filled it and put it on the stove. ‘I burned myself out. That’s what I did. A burned skeleton, that’s what I am.
<name>Max</name>	Max	Brendan	‘I’ve been alone all day. There’s been no one to see to me at all.’ ‘Well. ..’ ‘Where’s [MASK]?’ ‘I told you. He’s away on a job.’ ‘I’ve been bad.
<name>Water</name>	Water	Brendan	He just had to go back. Kill the fire that burns within. It would only be a temporary measure. Killing time, my friend. Until such time. His behind was wet. [MASK] would half-kill him, but then he was going away.
<name>Bloom</name>	Bloom	Joe	He put his plate on the floor beside him and patted his stomach with what [MASK] considered to be a rather vulgar gesture. ‘I would like to give you something, so I would. That’s made a new man of me. Something in return.’
<name>he</name>	he	Brendan	‘You’re one of the nice people in the world.’ ‘Do I bore you?’ ‘Never.’ ‘Does [MASK] bore you?’ She threw the remains of her cigarette into the gutter, v ‘What a strange thing to ask.
<name>leave</name>	leave	Frederick	The water from the pot splashed into the sink. ‘I would have advised agin it. And let me tell you, the boy \ would have listened to me. His father.’ He would go and visit her. Stay. And [MASK].
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Brendan	Half a dozen cows i cropped the rough grass in the ditch, unperturbed by the passing cars. [MASK] drew up at the beginning of the village street, a long curling street by the water’s edge. ‘Look,’ He pointed across the water towards a wide valley on the other side.
<name>Eileen</name>	Eileen	Joe	‘I’d have passed you in the street, so I would.’ [MASK] couldn’t think of anything to say. ‘Mam won’t like your hair.’ ‘That’s not much of a welcome home. Are you glad to see me?’
<name>Tim</name>	Tim	Fred	He might stay for ages. He could grow up there. He could learn to watch the world as she did. [MASK] would take off his uniform when he came home and you could forget what he was. He would be a man, like any other man.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Joe	‘Who is it?’ <T * — [MASK]. He heard her walk across the room and unlock the door, opened it slowly and stood looking at him. ‘Yes,’ she said. Her voice was cold. ‘What do you want?’
<name>Marion</name>	Marion	Kathleen	‘But. ..?’ ‘I know nothing. I don’t care. Just as long as she gets out.’ She moved slightly to one side to let him pass. He ran up the stairs and knocked on [MASK]’s door.
<name>Donald</name>	Donald	Brendan	The ostrich never wins. ‘Hello, [MASK],’ he said, trying not to sound too unfriendly. ‘Hi, kiddo.’ The three of them stood for a moment looking uncertainly at each other. ‘Quock, quock.’
<name>he</name>	he	Joe	If you gave that fellow a good push in the chest, thought [MASK], those eggs would break. That’d be a laugh ... or majTe it wouldn’t. His feet were frozen. He clutched the school bag close to his side and did a little dance for warmth.
<name>dear</name>	dear	Mam	A bit of air and a run around will do you the world of good.’ ‘Sit down, [MASK], I’ll make a cup of tea.’ He picked up the kettle and went out to the tap.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Joe	[MASK] wondered who his father had killed with his four shots. Who, from his past, had been lined up on the other side of the tiny room? Had his hand shaken then as it shook now? Hard for a marksman to have a shaking hand, no matter how good his eye.
<name>darling</name>	darling	Joe	He gave a final swirl to the water in the sink and wiped his hands on his trousers. ‘Are you in, [MASK]?’ Didn’t she know well he was in, wasn’t his coat hanging there beside hers? ‘I’m in.’
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Joe	The motion of his chewing jaws made him seem as if he were talking internally to himself. ‘Well, I’m not going down there, that’s for sure,’ said [MASK]. ‘Mmm.’ ‘Are you?’
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Brendan	I asked her and she said yes ... If you want to know she said she’d be delighted.’ ‘Can I come?’ ‘No.’ ‘Why not?’ ‘I said no.’ ‘Please [MASK].’ ‘No.’
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Joe	‘Monday. I’ll be away for five days on Monday. That make you happy?’ [MASK] scowled. ‘What’s your new job?’ ‘Just driving. Long-distance lorry. You know.’
<name>Mrs. Mooney</name>	Mrs. Mooney	Kathleen	A right eejit. He picked up his clothes and opened the door. ‘That was quick,’ said [MASK]. ‘Shut the door and don’t let the heat out.’ She took his clothes from him and festooned them like Christmas decorations round the fire.
<name>Mrs. Morel</name>	Mrs. Morel	Dadda	‘It’s muck if you don’t let it draw. Everyone knows that.’ ‘You were banging ...’ ‘Of course, it’s my fault. I might have known.’ ‘Ah, [MASK] ...’ ‘Where’s your brother?’
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Joe	‘Is that you, [MASK]?’ ‘Yes.’ She appeared in the kitchen door. Her face was too tired even to show anger. ‘How many times do I have to tell you to come straight home? Where were you?’
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Joe	They had been, maybe, a figment of his imagination. $ $ $ The moment he opened the door he heard the voice calling him. ‘[MASK].’ He hung his coat up and went into the kitchen. The drums will beat and the bells will ring.
<name>Battenberg</name>	Battenberg	Jaffa	The windows stared back at him as he tried to make sense of the glimpses of light and shadow that he could see beyond them. They were unfriendly. ‘Do you like [MASK] cakes?’ He turned away from the window. ‘Yes.’
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Brendan	Outside, the wind was blowing a hardboard sheet against a window-frame and the rain splashed ceaselessly. ‘Hello,’ he whispered, when [MASK] eventually came in. ‘Aren’t you asleep yet?’ ‘Where were you?’
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Joe	‘Hello.’ ‘I’ll be right down.’ ‘You have to give a man a chance. He’s never really had a chance.’ [MASK] said nothing. There wasn't anything much to say.
<name>you</name>	you	Joe	No damn gut. I burned out, son. I bet no boy in your class has seen his father cry. Has he? Has he?’ He opened his eyes wide and fixed them on [MASK]. ‘Has he?’ He almost shouted the words.
<name>it</name>	it	Mam	‘He’s right about [MASK].’ ‘I’m sorry, pet.’ ‘That’s all right.’ She put her arms round him and kissed him. ‘Tomorrow.’ /~ Her face was soft and smelt of soap.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Mam	He was only looking at his food today, not even bothering to lift his knife and fork. ‘Time enough. Wasn’t I into my forties when I took the plunge.’ ‘And nearly out of them again,’ said [MASK].
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Joe	oh ... [MASK] . ..’ He looked up at her and was suddenly aware of how unhappy she was. He took her hand and rubbed at the finger that wore the ring. He couldn’t think of anything to say.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Brendan	They’ve been everywhere. Sit down and take your tea.’ ‘I don’t want any tea.’ The glue sandwich could have been worse. He stared at [MASK] as he chewed, passing information with his eyes. They said you could do it.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Joe	[MASK] got up and went and stood beside him. He didn’t like to touch"7 him, but he stood as close to his brother as he possibly could. —/ ‘Are you not well?’ ‘I’m tired. It’s odd being here.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Joe	‘I hear your brother’s home, [MASK]?’ ‘Aye ... He’s home.’ ‘More fool he.’ There was a wave of shouting from down the hill, and the sound of glass breaking. ‘I believe he was making good money over there.’
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Brendan	‘Where are you going?’ she asked, coming into the kitchen with the brush in her hand. ‘[MASK] asked me to wake him before I went out.’ ‘I’ll bring him a cup of tea in a few minutes.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Joe	He’s not a child. He doesn’t need caring for any longer. He’ll have to get that into his head if he’s going to stay here.’ ‘I don’t need caring for,’ said [MASK], through a mouthful of toast.
<name>Christopher</name>	Christopher	Joe	‘I’ll be right down.’ [MASK] listened to his feet on the stairs and the sound of him moving round the room above. He buttered a slice of bread and then spread it with jam. It was the thick, gluey strawberry jam again.
<name>David</name>	David	Joe	The wind drove needles of rain along the valley between the houses. Not even the hens next door made a sound. ‘Chook,’ said [MASK], hopefully. There was no reaction from the hens. His father was thumping on the floor with his stick.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Mam	‘Where’s the car?’ At her place.’ (‘[MASK] hit me yesterday.’ ‘I expect you deserved it. She’s nervous. Everyone’s nervous. She doesn’t want you to turn out like me.’ ‘How’s that?’
<name>someone</name>	someone	Brendan	There was no such a thing as silence, and you only became aware of this at night. He didn’t hear [MASK]’s steps approaching the house. The first thing he heard was the creaking of the stairs and then the sound of the door opening slowly.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Brendan	Tea slopped over the top on to the oil cloth. ‘Ah,’ said his father. He moved warily past [MASK], putting a hand out to touch his shoulder just at the last moment before lurching into his chair. ‘You look ... are you well?
<name>Biff</name>	Biff	Brendan	/ son.’ 1 The man threw his hands out in front of him in an awkward 1 gesture of welcome. V- ‘Son.’ [MASK] took another step towards his father. They both stared at each other like dogs at a street corner, and were silent.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Joe	‘Quock.’ He handed her the change. They didn’t bother going upstairs, but sat in drowned silence staring out of the window at the rain and feeling the wetness creeping through them to their bones. ‘I get stitches,’ said [MASK] after a while.
<name>Mrs.</name>	Mrs.	Hi	[MASK] Fed up. And the sun was shining with summer brilliance, showing up the dirty streaks on the windows and the grey cracked paint. ‘Run up with a cup of tea for your Daddy and see if he’s alive at all.’
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Joe	The tobacconist on the corner was locking his door as they went past. He nodded briefly at them, but said nothing. ‘Run away on home now, [MASK]. Quick. Maybe I’ll see you tomorrow.’ He ran until he reached the house.
<name>Mrs. Hopewell</name>	Mrs. Hopewell	Grianan	She picked up the coal hod and emptied it into the stove. ‘One of the teachers .. .’ he tried again. She put a hand to her back and straightened up. She smiled at him. ‘That’ll be nice son. [MASK] ...’
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Kathleen	‘Do that,’ she said. She opened the door. A very cold wind blew in. She got out quickly and banged the door. She thumped with her fist on the window. ‘Bye.’ ‘[MASK] .. .’
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Brendan	‘Now. Sit down.’ She put his plate on the table and pointed to a chair. ‘He’s well able to drag himself up the stairs.’ [MASK] looked briefly at his father and then sat down.
<name>George</name>	George	Brendan	[MASK] patted it like you might pat a dog. He felt in his pocket for the keys. ‘You know, the old fellow’s not as bad as she makes him out to be. He did his bit. You have to give him that.’
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Finagler	[MASK]. ‘That’s good. Why don’t you come too and have a cup of tea?’ She looked a bit embarrassed suddenly. ‘I mean ... you don’t have to . . . or anything ...
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Kathleen	Not by children’s tears of rage or pain, nor his father’s blubberings of self-pity, .but adult tears like hers and [MASK]’s which made him feel that the world might crack open suddenly. ‘I’ll go up and do my homework.’
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Mam	The kettle began to murmur. ‘Do you want anything to eat, or will you wait till [MASK] gets back?’ ‘Huh?’ ‘You were asleep with your eyes open.’ ‘Yes. Sort of asleep. Dreaming anyway.’
<name>Samuel</name>	Samuel	Brendan	There was nothing new in the operation, nothing even very pitiful. ‘Nothing’s changed,’ he heard [MASK] say. ‘I mean here ... In here. Not out beyond. You know, here.’ ‘I know well,’ said his mother.
<name>Miss Marple</name>	Miss Marple	Joe	‘I’m sure I had a full packet. I’m coming slowly to the conclusion, [MASK], that there’s a cigarette rustler in the staff room. Or else I’m smoking in my sleep.’ (‘Are you a teacher?’ \‘Mmmm.’
<name>The man</name>	The man	Peter	‘It wouldn’t have mattered. He got it right in the middle of the head.’ ^ She rubbed fiercely at her face with her hand. Another truck went past them. [MASK] stood up by the corner, not moving. An| ambulance siren was whining towards them.
<name>Mrs. Mercer</name>	Mrs. Mercer	Joe	‘If you ever had any.’ She sat down herself at the table and [MASK] pushed a cup of tea over to her. She held her hands out in front of her and looked at them. She opened them and shut them, moved her fingers stiffly.
<name>Conor</name>	Conor	Brendan	— [MASK] yawned and stretched his arms above his head. His nails were bitten well below the tops of his fingers and the exposed flesh was puckered and sore-looking. ‘I need air.’ ‘A dander down the road?’ ‘Mmm.’
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Cheat	‘We thought we’d go to my place and dry off a bit. Your mother wouldn’t mind that, would she?’ ‘I don’t suppose she would.’ ___Liar. [MASK].
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Joe	‘Man; gets letters ...’ The men were bored. ‘Time you were home anyway.’ The wail of a fire engine, or perhaps an ambulance. [MASK] turned I I his head to see if he could see anything through the broken houses.
<name>George</name>	George	Joe	‘Everyone’s fussing.’ She handed [MASK] his clothes. ‘Do you want to take them down to the bathroom.’ ‘Someone’s in there. Having a bath.’ ‘They’ll be out by now. Our bathroom’s not a place to linger.’
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Joe	She was quite unaware of [MASK]’s arrival, even unaware of the wind that tangled her brown hair, and had changed the colour of her face from the palest cream to a pinched mauve. She sat quite motionless, only the wind lifted and stretched her hair out to one side.
<name>Mother</name>	Mother	Mam	‘I wouldn’t think it was worth much.’ ‘As snotty as ever.’ ‘I am not snotty.’ ‘You certainly used to be. Little yellow ribbons hanging all the time from your nose. I used to complain to [MASK] about it.’
<name>Father Ralph</name>	Father Ralph	Brendan	t Iwo. ‘Aye. That’s what she says too. I don’t think I’d fancy it at all. Sometimes we hear the explosions here.’ Her eyes were startled even by the recollection. ‘It’s the water,’ explained [MASK].
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Joe	He took the top off the bottle and tilted it to his mouth. [MASK] watched the stretching of his throat as he swallowed. He put the bottle carefully on the table and screwed the top back on again. He wiped his mouth with the back of his wrist.
<name>he</name>	he	Brendan	On the pictures they could look down the barrel and tell you. No one would ever know now. Unless, of course, they dragged the river. But they wouldn’t. They wouldn’t do that. A laughable thought. Was [MASK] soft on her?
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Peter	‘What’s on at the pictures?’ ‘I don’t want to go to the pictures.’ [MASK] spat his ball of gum into the gutter and put another one into his mouth. ‘We can’t just stand here all day.’
<name>Nelly</name>	Nelly	Mammy’ll	' ‘I’m parched,’ he whined again. ‘[MASK] be in soon. I’ll make you a cup of tea.’ ‘I could do better with a couple of bottles of stout.’ He groped under his pillows and pulled out a pound note.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Joe	‘Oh, no thanks, I couldn’t.’ ‘Go on, take it. You might as well, better you than some others I could mention.’ [MASK] took the chocolate from his hand. ‘Thanks,’ he muttered.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Brendan	She threw the cloth into the sink and came and sat down beside him on the divan, cigarette and mug clutched in the same hand. ‘Sorry for all that. .. you were saying something about your brother?’ ‘[MASK].’ ‘That’s a nice name.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Wanting	Sometimes I think you’re a bit thick? [MASK].’ ‘Well, I’m not. If anyone’s thick it’s you. You . .. ou ... ou.’ ‘You’ll have someone up.’
<name>Samuel</name>	Samuel	Brendan	He’d cleaned his shoes at any rate. ‘Good night.’ He pushed past her and walked slowly through the kitchen. The two men were sitting staring into space, the space behind their skulls. [MASK]’s fingers drummed unconsciously and nervously on the table.
<name>briefcase</name>	briefcase	Mad	She didn’t argue, just looked down at him with slight amusement. ‘Tooraloo,’ she said, and walked off down the hill swinging her ---- briefcase. ‘[MASK].’ He said the word quiedy to himself as he looked after her.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Brendan	‘That was my brother.’ She shook the match and dropped it on the ground. ‘Yes.’ ‘[MASK].’ They turned and their feet took them up the hill again. ‘Do you know the other fellow?’ she asked casually.
<name>Miss Caroline</name>	Miss Caroline	Joseph	She threw the pieces on to her desk. ‘I am here to teach, [MASK],’ she said. ‘You are here to learn. The law,’ she spoke the word with contempt,’ demands that you attend school.
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Joe	‘If they’d ask me . .. that’s all I need .. . ask me. I have it all at my finger tips.’ [MASK] went over and looked into the stove. Down at the bottom of the darkness was a small red glimmer.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Brendan	At least that put a stop to [MASK]’s carrying on. ‘That’ll be nice.’ ‘I hope so.’ ‘I don’t think I’ll ever get married.’ ‘You’re very pessimistic this evening. Of course you will.’
<name>George</name>	George	Joe	‘That’s a good lad, and look it, before you go, I’m perished, shove on the other bar of the fire.’ [MASK] went over to the fire and pressed down the metal switch. Crackle went the end of the element.
<name>she</name>	she	Joe	‘Saturday’s bath day,’ she said. ‘They’re all queueing up with their flannels and soap.’ ‘We don’t have a bath at home.’ ‘You must come and join the queue some day.’ They laughed and [MASK] felt better.
<name>Ingrid</name>	Ingrid	Kathleen	She dropped her cigarette butt on the pavement and squeezed it out with her toe. They started to walk along the road. ‘If...?’ An army truck drove past. The soldier sitting on the back with his gun on his knee whistled at [MASK].
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Joseph	‘I’m sorry, miss ...’ She spread her hands out towards the rest of the class, who roared in one triumphant voice, ‘60 degrees, miss.’ She wrote 60 degrees on the board and then turned to face [MASK] again.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Kathleen	He felt in his pocket for the keys. ‘You know, the old fellow’s not as bad as she makes him out to be. He did his bit. You have to give him that.’ He looked up towards [MASK]’s window.

<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Kathleen	Something moved in the darkness. He got up in what he hoped was a casual way and looked around for [MASK]. She was up on the top of the fort leaning over the wall. ‘Come on up,’ she yelled down at him. ‘Up.
<name>Mr. Banks</name>	Mr. Banks	Joe	■“''■ilt’s cracked, I’m afraid.’ ‘That doesn’t matter.’ She took it out and held it for a moment over the saucepan and then popped it into [MASK]’s egg-cup. He watched the shell drying.

<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Joe	A cat sat near them, fluffing out its fur to keep the wind from penetrating. ‘Look,’ said [MASK]. ‘A cat. They have a cat. Would you have thought of that?’ sea cat. Lots of boats have cats.’
<name>Mum</name>	Mum	Mam	An| ambulance siren was whining towards them. ' ‘I’ve never seen ...’ ‘Come back home with me and have a cup of tea.’ [MASK] would have a fit, but there was nothing else he could say. She shook her head.
<name>his father</name>	his father	Mam	It was 4J still dark when he woke in the morning and the room was filled with a strange smell, half sweat, half alcohol, which almost choked him. He could hear [MASK] moving downstairs. He got up and pulled his clothes off the end of the bed.
