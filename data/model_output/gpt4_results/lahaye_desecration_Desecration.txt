<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Buck	We all are. We are aliens in this world, homeless if anyone is.” [MASK] thrust his hands deep into his pockets. He couldn’t believe it. The old man had persuaded him. He was going to leave his old friend alone overnight with the enemy.
<name>Chambers</name>	Chambers	Chaim	“Then round up our guys and tell the rest that all Operation Eagle personnel are on combat duty effective immediately.” He turned back to [MASK] and motioned him to lean close. “Doctor, I need to tell you what happened here yesterday. ...”
<name>Sniper</name>	Sniper	Mac	And fifty yards farther, [MASK] was ready. They would fire once in that order, then start over for the second round. Each would watch through high-powered telescopes to try to gauge the adjustment for the second shot.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Mac	But suddenly the GC vehicle disappeared from his vision. In the distance, Operation Eagle cars and trucks roared on, but behind them a great cavern opened and the pursuing GC dropped into it. [MASK] jumped out and realized his front tires were on the edge of the gigantic crevasse.
<name>God</name>	God	Leon	They were.” “But they tested clean.” “Who knows that but you and I?” “Um-hm.” “No one, am I correct?” “You are.” “Whisper it to [MASK].
<name>Yama</name>	Yama	Micah	“You would employ sarcasm with me?” “I shot that man eight times at point-blank range, worshipfulness! The heckler I killed from two feet away. You couldn’t have killed [MASK] yourself.”
<name>Clinton</name>	Clinton	Carpathia	They laughed and laughed as aides rushed to help [MASK] off the animal. He formed a gun with his thumb and forefinger and pretended to pop the sow where she rested. Then he dragged a finger across his own neck, as if remembering the actual plan for the porker.
<name>Albus</name>	Albus	Rayford	When the time comes, help anyone who needs it.” “And if we are stopped?” “You’re on your own,” [MASK] said. “I’m going to tell them I’m on my way to get the mark of loyalty.”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Chaim	I have the potentate on the phone for the troublemaker.” He looked at [MASK], making the pressing crowd laugh. “For some reason my people can’t seem to get through to a demented old man. That has to be you.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Hannah	[MASK] nodded. “And you want to talk to him, so why didn’t you—” “I’m not sure I want to talk to him until I know how he’s going to respond to my E-mail. He should have written me back.
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Wong	“Which I’m not using as long as I’m sitting here.” “Don’t be a hard guy, [MASK]. I’m in a position to do you some good.” “You’re not even in a position to keep your word.”
<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Chang	“Really?” “Oh yeah, it’s quite simple.” “For a brain like yours, maybe,” [MASK] said. “I just know what buttons to push.” “Well, there’s a lot more to it than that.”
<name>Jackson</name>	Jackson	Albie	“Be alert for others,” he said, aware he was speaking too loudly. His words reverberated inside, but he heard none of them. “Let’s see what we’ve got,” he said. [MASK] was the first to the targets.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Hut	“I’m not. I’ll shoot your bad guys and chop their heads off, but I don’t need to check the other victims to see if their—” “Do you not? I do! This is life and death, [MASK]!
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	Moon	“I have a vague recollection of the flash of the camera and being angry at my father. After that, I only remember sitting awhile in a side room with [MASK] and my father and slowly realizing that I had been given the mark of loyalty.
<name>Alia</name>	Alia	Nicolae	“You would disobey me?” [MASK] whispered. “I want to obey, sir, but—” “Sir?!” “Holiness! But I’m not supposed to even be in here, and they aren’t going to listen to me.”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Rayford	“They are, but there’s a clear visual line if they come around.” “I’ll risk it.” “Negative.” “C’mon, [MASK]! They couldn’t hit me from there anyway.”
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Abdullah	“That sounds like milk and honey to me.” [MASK] unbuckled himself and squeezed back between them, kneeling to retrieve the box. He pivoted and opened the lid, revealing a stack of nearly twenty round pitas about ten inches in diameter, steam rising.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Chaim	“You’ve got to hang in there and coordinate until [MASK] arrives, and that could be a couple of days.” “I could appoint one of the first to get here. There’s no science to this. How are you going to handle those big guns by yourself?”
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Georgiana	“The co-op is in the cellar under the pub a block and a half that way?” “And you know the password?” “Of course. They have my stuff.” “And they will confirm that the girl—” “[MASK].”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Chaim	Following [MASK]’s advice, he left his wallet and ID in the room. Finding a place to park was harder than the day before, and he had to walk a half mile farther, finally reaching the streets lined on each side with empty military personnel carriers.
<name>Shevek</name>	Shevek	Chloe	Did it or they want to catch her or scare her off? or simply be aware of what was out there? [MASK] took a deep breath and, trying to relax, worked to regulate the rise and fall of her diaphragm.
<name>John</name>	John	Chang	“Why would I care about being interrogated?” “It’s a waste of time, a nuisance, stressful.” “Not if you’re innocent. I never even heard of the Indian stewards.” “The offer stands.” [MASK] sighed.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Chaim	“Two Nicks,” she said. He peeled off the bills, and [MASK] opened the package on the way out. He discarded the box and the tiny printed scroll and put the palm-sized clay vessel and its miniature top in the pocket of his robe.
<name>dollars</name>	dollars	Nicks	“You use the period after it, so it stands for something. I’d just be guessing.” “Unless you’re lying about hacking into my file, a hundred [MASK] says you couldn’t guess in ten tries.” “I have only one guess.”
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Rayford	“They’re probably within firing range right now,” [MASK] said. “In twenty more minutes they will all be in position. If they advance as soon as they are mustered, they would be able to fight hand to hand within ten more minutes of that.”
<name>He</name>	He	Buck	“So I’ll come without papers, and if they demand to know who I am, I’ll be deemed a vagrant.” “I will identify you as my assistant, and that will satisfy them.” [MASK] looked away.
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Chang	[MASK] could only hope that such detail stayed below the potentate’s radar level. Who knew what could come of it? Yes, he appeared to be loyal, even to the point of the mark. But if investigated, how long could he keep his parents and his sister out of it?
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Carpathia	[MASK] seemed to be stifling a giggle. “You must tell me about the image.” “On the way, sir. I was hoping you’d notice.” “Notice?” “My mark.” “Let me see! On your hand!
<name>John</name>	John	Rayford	And they stood with hands raised, humming and singing, “Amazing grace, how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me; I once was lost but now am found, was blind but now I see. ” “[MASK], my friend, how are you?”
<name>Vasily</name>	Vasily	George	[MASK] had told him it was impossible to judge the wind between weapon and target and so to aim high, accounting for the effect of gravity over two miles, and to not expect accuracy within more than twenty or thirty yards.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Ray	Any hope he’s alive?” “Not if this is his blood.” “How can you know that?” “You sure you want to know?” “Give me your professional opinion.” “There’s an awful lot of blood here, [MASK].
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Figueroa	[MASK] leaned back in his chair and put his feet up on the corner of his desk. Apparently he miscalculated, because as he pulled the huge cigar from his lips, his heel slipped off the desk and his center of gravity shifted.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	David	But [MASK] was my boss and my friend, and this is no picnic for me either.” “I know.” “We’re all going to need some grieving time, and we won’t likely get it until we head back to the States.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	George	As long as he resisted, his captors knew they were getting to him When he ignored them, they had nothing to grab on to, and the insult of not being taken seriously had to drive them crazy. Ironically, [MASK] had learned that from his wife.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	David	“To my right and your extreme left,” [MASK] said, “the first six or so vehicles appear unmanned. Only a few of all the soldiers are still ambulatory, and they seem to be tending to the others either directly below me or to my left.”
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Chloe	[MASK] carefully settled and steadied herself, bracing the instrument and aligning it with what she had seen. At long last she was able to bring the illusive beam into focus and calm the jumpy lens. To her astonishment, the source of light was at ground level.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Fie	Nothing yet, but he heard movement in the rocks below. No way anyone on foot could have arrived before the choppers. [MASK] knelt and crept to the edge, holding his breath to listen. His heart banged against his ribs. He guessed two sets of footsteps, slowly moving.
<name>Valens</name>	Valens	Suhail	“The stewards. Convict them of treason.” “Uh, on what evidence?” “They are the only logical ones, [MASK]. The pilot was not even on board during most of our meetings. They were.” “But they tested clean.”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Leon	But I’d rather not—” “Bring me up-to-date on your assignments, then.” “The animal is in place.” “You may feel free to call it what it is, [MASK].” “The pig.”
<name>Alana</name>	Alana	Leah	“Affirmative. Three clicks when you’re in place, but don’t speak unless you know they’re far enough away.” As soon as he said that, [MASK] began a long but smooth ascent, the side arm in her hand.
<name>Johnson</name>	Johnson	Albie	While there seemed to be countless vehicles and weapons, the personnel seemed to be in trouble. Most languished on the ground or on the beds of trucks, being ministered to by others thus far less affected. He called [MASK] to report.
<name>urgent</name>	urgent	Buck	“I have forwarded a message to your computer that you need to read right away,” he said, knowing his quavering voice scared her. “Is it [MASK]?” she said. He shook his head.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Micah	“Whoever you are, tell your so-called potentate that [MASK] demands an audience with him.” “How did you get this radio?” the voice said. “He will find me and my assistant in the center of the Temple Mount with three catatonic guards.”
<name>Buford</name>	Buford	Laslos	Late one morning he was awakened by footsteps in the gravel above his hideaway. As quietly as a man of his girth and age could manage, [MASK] moved to the edge of his bed and slipped onto all fours on the wood floor.
<name>Trout</name>	Trout	Carpathia	“This is for His Excellency.” “Live or disc?” “I don’t care! Just cue me!” “All right! Hang on!” She spoke into a small radio. “Yes!” she said. “[MASK] himself.
<name>Strangelove</name>	Strangelove	Suhail	“Two planes, two crews, two annihilation devices. We could launch a subsequent missile to ensure thorough devastation, though that might be overkill.” “Ah, [MASK]. You will one day come to realize that there is no such thing as overkill.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	George	The man near him tried the next strategy in the hostage-taker’s guidebook. He laid a hand gently on [MASK]’s shoulder and whispered, “All we need is a specific location. No one knows where we got it, you go free, and everybody’s happy.”
<name>Elon</name>	Elon	ISO	With the illness affecting much of our staff as it has so many around the world, we ask your indulgence, as many of the technicians helping bring you this special event are volunteers. ” [MASK] did here at his temple.
<name>Alfred</name>	Alfred	Tsion	“That is why I wanted you to review it.” “I’m sorry, [MASK]. I assumed you had a reason.” “It is not your fault,” he said, collapsing into a chair. “What was I thinking?”
<name>Arctor</name>	Arctor	One	“Of course.” “You too will soon suffer. The sores have begun to rise on your bodies.” [MASK] looked at the other. “I do have something inside my forearm. Look.” The other said, “Will you stop?
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Mac	Only a few of all the soldiers are still ambulatory, and they seem to be tending to the others either directly below me or to my left.” “Take cover,” [MASK] said, cutting in. “These things take a while to aim.
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Nicolae	He let go of the Peacekeeper’s hand and smoothed his robe back down over his legs, held the rope with both hands, and looked again to the crowd for a response. The pig had moved not an inch under [MASK]’s weight.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Chang	“Not long. Don’t wait too long or he won’t be able to walk by himself.” “Okay. You help.” They returned. “[MASK]?” “Mmm?” “You come with us now?” “Who?”
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Chang	What do you know?” “Nothing to speak of, sir,” [MASK] said. “Have to protect my connection, you know.” “You’re putting me on. You know nothing.” “Of course.” “Seriously, now.
<name>Orual</name>	Orual	Chaim	“If I am not god,” he said, “I challenge yours to slay me now. I spit in his face and call him a weakling. If I remain alive for ten more seconds, he, and you, are frauds.” [MASK] smiled.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	George	“Idiot!” the other man said, and [MASK] heard the girl stifle a laugh. “I’ll kill him!” the one on the floor said, grunting and whimpering in pain as he struggled to his feet and cocked his weapon. “Stop it!”
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Hannah	“Just a sec—oh!” “Just now or . . . ?” “No. Some time ago.” “Anything pertinent? Problems? He need help?” “No,” [MASK] said, scanning it quickly. “Just personal stuff.”
<name>Uther</name>	Uther	Hut	U T ___ 55 1 see. “Do you? As they lie howling and others abandon them in fear, you still have five rounds, do you not?” “Yes.” [MASK] sounded terrified. “Both knees, each shoulder.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Carpathia	I’m not. Obviously, [MASK] will have cameras in the temple and wants the world to see what he does there. My schedule says he’s going to speak afterward, but I can’t tell if that’s inside or outside.
<name>Daniel</name>	Daniel	Hattie	[MASK] was too terrified to say anything eloquent. She said, “What are you supposed to tell me?” He said, “I have come to make you understand what will happen in these latter days.”
<name>Chandler</name>	Chandler	Hannah	We’re not building a computer system here that has to serve a million people.” [MASK] was staring at the screen. The news was nothing but Carpathia propaganda, pundits trying to spin his temple folly into something that made sense.
<name>Rourke</name>	Rourke	Mac	“Not unless they turn back toward her.” He nodded at her. “She’ll reach a flat area up there in thirty minutes.” [MASK] thrust a round into the chamber of the big gun and stretched out on his belly.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Michael	Fear not! Fear not! Fear not! Fear not!” The crowd began to take up the chant, louder and louder, as [MASK] found his way to the edge of the people, facing what was now the middle column of desert dust, fast approaching.
<name>Vicki</name>	Vicki	Buck	“When I come back down, be close by. We may have to take up arms.” “Arms?” [MASK] said. “I heard about those. Count me out.” “You may change your mind if the GC opens fire.”
<name>Jennifer</name>	Jennifer	Leah	He turned his head slightly and saw [MASK] waiting. Their backs were to her. There was no reason she couldn’t take her look, if she hurried. He picked up the radio, while focusing on the targets again.
<name>Jacob</name>	Jacob	Albie	We need to hurry, but don’t waste all your energy.” [MASK] pulled up his trousers, tightened his belt, and retied his boots. Hoisting the weapon, he swung it vertically and leaned it back into one shoulder.
<name>I'm</name>	I'm	Pm	“You be ready to go in ten minutes!” “[MASK] not going!” “You will go or answer to me!” “I’m answering to you now. I’m telling you I’m not going. I don’t want to work here.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	George	[MASK] pressed his lips together and shook his head. “Should have checked with you first. I’ve got a hundred of ’em on the way with all the ammo you’d need, some with incendiary tips.” “Dare I ask?”
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Lord	“That’s what I’m talkin’ about! ” the pilot said, though he hadn’t said a word for an hour. All dug in, tearing at the chewy bread with their teeth. “[MASK], you know we are grateful!”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	David	“These things take a while to aim. It’s going to be hit-and-miss at first, and probably more miss than hit.” “Just don’t overshoot,” [MASK] said. “I’ve got a small cave staked out.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Rayford	Then things would pick up again. How he looked forward to at least some rest between crises. [MASK] pushed his hair back and put on his aviator’s cap. The next few days would determine whether he or his loved ones would even survive to the end.
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Rayford	“How were we to know you would venture out on your own?” “Last time, I discovered the new safe house. And look what has come of this foray.” “You’re lucky what came of it,” [MASK] said.
<name>Rhonda</name>	Rhonda	Smitty	“I can hear, [MASK]. I’ve been healed.” “Really!?” He leaned back and quit shouting, but still talked loudly enough to be heard above the din of the craft. “I have pita bread warm in an insulated box, along with sauce for the dipping.”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Moon	Be able to tell your descendants that His Excellency personally was there the day you made your pledge concrete.” Speaking softly now and making it sound like an afterthought but still clearly reading, [MASK] added, “And please remember that neither the mark of loyalty nor the worshiping of the image is optional.”
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Buck	All [MASK] knew was that what he had endured in three and a half years was a walk in the park compared to what was coming. The entire drive back he spent in silent prayer for every loved one and Trib Force member.
<name>Laurent</name>	Laurent	Nicolae	“I cannot imagine. So how is my inaccurate-shooting friend?” “Very funny.” “Excuse me,” [MASK] said, “but was that two times consecutively you addressed me without title?” “Well, pardon me, your highness.”
<name>Farid</name>	Farid	Leon	“Anyway, I’ll show you the chosen image. It’s life-size and gold and beautiful. And when I had taken the mark of loyalty, I fell before it and worshiped.” “Bless you, [MASK]. And may you heal quickly.”
<name>Charnier</name>	Charnier	Solomon	Someone handed him the robe, sash, and sandals from the day before, and he looked directly into the lens. “Now, once my image is in place,” he said, “we are out to [MASK]’s scaffold.”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Hannah	“If we have to load him on the chopper, can you and I do that?” “Worry about your end, Captain,” she said. Then, whispering and turning away from [MASK], “And you’d better start worrying about that phone and those computers.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Chang	Amen.” Finally alone again, [MASK] waited a few minutes, then moved a chair to his door, stood on it, and secured a latch he had built in along the top that would keep out even those with a master key.
<name>Devon</name>	Devon	Hannah	“I’ve seen those Quasis do amazing things based solely on what the flight management system onboard computer tells it to do. But this is a long flight on its own, and I’ve asked it to do some interesting stuff, barring turbulence.’ “Cross our fingers?” [MASK] said.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Wong	“You intrigue me, that’s all.” “Oh, no. You’re not—” “[MASK]! I’m a married man!” “Thank goodness.” “No, like most everybody else around here, I’m intrigued with your gifts and skills.”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Chloe	“No, I’m making that point. Is it a requirement that they be subordinate to you?” “That’s not it at all, [MASK]. We just don’t have time for squabbles, lack of organization, confusion about responsibility.”
<name>He</name>	He	George	Your information proves correct; you are free to go.” As if they wouldn’t kill him for not having the mark of loyalty. “We have them narrowed to the United Carpathian States.” [MASK] cocked his head ever so slightly.
<name>He</name>	He	Mac	“I won’t be much good to him if I’m dead,” she said. [MASK] handed her his side arm. “It’s only a .45,” he said. “I’ll take it.” “You know how to use it?”
<name>Vik</name>	Vik	George	“I realize I’m the new guy and everything, Captain,” [MASK] said, “but I been wonderin’. Is there anything here worth protectin’ from the GC? I mean, let ’em concentrate their efforts on tearin’ up the dirt we worked so hard to smooth out.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Chang	“Understand the question?” “Of course.” “Then your answer is yes?” “No.” “Don’t start playing games now, [MASK], or we’ll have to do this all over again.”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Figueroa	“You don’t want to just say yes and be done with it?” “That’s the last question?” “Yes.” “How’m I doing so far?” “It looks fine,” [MASK] said. “Then let it ride.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Leah	There was no reason she couldn’t take her look, if she hurried. He picked up the radio, while focusing on the targets again. They looked up and a second later he heard what drew their eyes. Yet another chopper. “[MASK], go and return quickly.
<name>Jackson</name>	Jackson	Mac	Let them waste their time. He was burned out, desolate, and needed the break. If someone else would fly his craft, and if perhaps [MASK] would take over running the operation, at least for a while, he could hang on till daybreak.
<name>Beast</name>	Beast	Carpathia	“Come, sir. You are either drunk or undernourished. Save yourself the grief and me the paperwork. Get your mark.” “And worship the image of [MASK]?” She glared at him and pulled back the firing mechanism on her rifle.
<name>Tiffany</name>	Tiffany	Chang	“Now, watch this,” [MASK] wrote. “The surveillance camera from the hallway picks up that they’re pretty much carrying me down the hall, and look what I’m doing! Crossing myself! I don’t even know where I got that!
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Lars	But there’s either something on the drive or there isn’t, and in this case, there clearly isn’t.” “What if it was on a different drive, named something else?” “You couldn’t do that by accident,” [MASK] said.
<name>Jericho</name>	Jericho	Rayford	Now, what?” “A few more seconds. Ready?” “Been ready, boss. Let’s commence.” [MASK] looked at his watch and settled back in. How loud could it be? How much recoil? The stories had become legends.
<name>Archer</name>	Archer	David	“Do you?” “I think so.” “You will.” “Yes.” “Now go. Big week ahead. Be prepared.” [MASK], chilled and disgusted, scribbled himself a note.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Michael	Our general is better than your general, he thought, so game over. That almost made him smile. Why should he worry about the people who held him now when [MASK] the archangel could step in and make them faint dead away—if they were lucky?
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Chloe	[MASK] tiptoed halfway across the street and noticed a faded sign on the wall, but still it was too dark to make out. She stood there, the camera seeming to study her. Finally the fluorescent light came back on.
<name>Lucifer</name>	Lucifer	Chaim	“You will refer to him as His Excellency or His Worship or as the risen potentate.” “I will refer to him as Satan incarnate!” She pressed the barrel of her weapon upon [MASK]’s chest and appeared to squeeze the trigger.
<name>Valentine</name>	Valentine	Hannah	“His Excellency the potentate guarantees healing from the affliction of sores by 2100 hours Carpathian Time.” “I’m stupid,” [MASK] said. “I know.” “Stop it! We hardly know each other.” “Sorry. Why are you stupid?”
