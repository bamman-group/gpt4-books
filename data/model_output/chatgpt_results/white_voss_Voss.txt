<name>Darnay</name>	Darnay	Voss	‘I will not easily forget,’ he said, ‘my first meeting with the man, and the almost Christlike humility with which he tended one responsible, in a sense, for all his sufferings.’ [MASK] jerked his head.
<name>Ahab</name>	Ahab	Voss	All that morning [MASK] was coming and going at the ship. Some spoke to him as he passed, asked for directions, asked to be commanded. Some did not see him, but took him for granted. He was there, the leader.
<name>Prince Myshkin</name>	Prince Myshkin	Palfreyman	‘I will not split off,’ said [MASK], sadly. ‘I am not of any party.’ ‘Ach, you cannot afford to stand aloof.’ ‘Perhaps I expressed myself badly. Shall we say: I am of all parties?’
<name>Long John Silver</name>	Long John Silver	Turner	And holdin’ forth to the public. Contracted with a practisin’ madman, you was, accordin’ to your own admission, for a journey to hell an’ back.’ Then [MASK] began to laugh, and to wink great face-consuming winks at the listening boy.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Voss	‘No,’ said [MASK]. ‘No. There are too few. It is not worth it.* A flash of green lightning cut the brown air. ‘All sheep must be sacrificed,’ shouted the German against the thunder, and inhaled until it began to appear he might burst.
<name>Thursday</name>	Thursday	Thursday	‘Let me see. [MASK]?’ She had grown contemplative of the whole of time. ‘Now, had it been Wednesday, that is always inconvenient. And Friday, that would be out of the question.
<name>Tess</name>	Tess	Rose	A savage hand had carved the lines deeper in her grey face, which, under light, was more than ever that of a dumb animal. ‘Oh, miss, I cannot bear it,’ breathed [MASK].
<name>Jake</name>	Jake	Judd	Her voice was that of a man. She dared anyone. [MASK] was feeling his way with his hands. ‘Well, you see, if you live and suffer long enough in a place, you do not leave it altogether. Your spirit is still there.’
<name>Lily</name>	Lily	Voss	At that hour of day words might defile the pure pleasure of living. [MASK] lay and listened to the people of the house begin to go about their business. Some of the girls were exchanging the plain, country dreams they had dreamt.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Voss	The native was still standing at the stirrup looking shy when the last of the surviving sheep and a heavy, palpitating cow had shambled past. The men had finished calling, some correctly, others affectionately, one obscenely, to the old black. Now, all were gone, except the dust, and [MASK].
<name>Madame Defarge</name>	Madame Defarge	Boyle	Thus, he could blame no one else for his own human weakness. He had delivered up his throat to the long, cold, glistening braids of her hair, and was truly strangling in them. ‘That is very reasonable,’ commented [MASK].
<name>Reynolds</name>	Reynolds	Topp	Yes, yes. [MASK], the bristling, unpleasant little thing, was sitting forward. In the headmistress’s wooden words, he could hear the stubborn music that was waiting for release. Of rock and scrub. Of winds curled invisibly in wombs of air.
<name>She</name>	She	Laura	All that happens, happens in spite of the horsehair woman, who is, in fact, stuffed. [MASK] is smiling. They are sharing this knowledge. Then, how are names lost, which the hands have known by touch, and faces, like laborious, raw jugs?
<name>Ma Joad</name>	Ma Joad	Voss	Their adam’s apples moved stiffly with some intelligence of weather, flocks, or crops. As they had hewn, painfully, an existence out of the scrub and rocks, so they proceeded to hew the words out of a poor vocabulary. [MASK] appeared to glow.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Jackie	‘Oh, no,’ she begged. ‘Do not go back. They arc dead. It is over. Let them be. We suffered enough, all of us.’ ‘Of all those men, some could have survived. [MASK] did.
<name>Magwitch</name>	Magwitch	Judd	[MASK], I understand, has shown himself to be most commendably adaptable. Because he came out here against his will. In other words, was a convict. Free now, naturally. The circumstances of his transportation were quite ridiculous, I am led to believe.’
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Judd	‘When we first come here,’ [MASK] began dreamily, ‘this was all we had.’ He lathered himself with dreamy soap. ‘I mean, we got here in a dray, along the plain that runs to the South.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Palfreyman	[MASK], however, since he had dared a little, was being sucked back by the dreadful undercurrent of the past. As he could no longer hope for rescue, he continued. ‘My uncle’s vicarage would astonish any stranger expecting to find a house given up to normal human needs.
<name>Kurtz</name>	Kurtz	Turner	Except for the dogs scratching and sighing, the night had grown silent, the fires had fallen into embers, when grass began to rustle, feet approached the leader, and there was [MASK]’s face upon the darkness. Why did I bring the man?
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Belle	‘Oh dear, I would write a letter,’ [MASK] might say, ‘if I had not written to everyone.’ She had, too, but she did receive in return many informative letters from other girls.
<name>Mr. Utterson</name>	Mr. Utterson	Voss	On the following, and several successive mornings, which were all bright and shadowkss, made keener by the red dust that would fill the street in sallies of grit, [MASK] went here and there in his tall, black, town hat.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Belle	‘For perhaps the lion will gobble him up,’ she giggled. ‘But, poor lion, I could wish him better than bones and black hair.’ ‘[MASK] 1 ’ Her mother frowned. And a girl, almost married, who could not learn to eat a peach!
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Dugald	He stood about with the delicacy of a young girl, looking away while absorbing all details, listening with his skin, and quivering his reactions. It was not possible to address him directly, nor would he answer, but through his mouthpiece, [MASK].
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Belle	Indeed, there were mothers who predicted that [MASK] would develop a coarse loo\ later on. But she smelled still of youth and flint, sunlight could have been snoozing upon her cheeks, and, amiably, she would let herself be stroked with the clumsiest of compliments.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Harry	As it was, aware of some disloyalty to his leader, he spat out the remains of the bitter, and now offensive gum. ‘I will stick closer than anyone, in the end,’ said [MASK]. ‘I will sit under the platform.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Ja	These were very prominent, and befitting. Although initiated by sympathy into the mystery of the drawings, of which the details fulfilled needs most beautifully, the German did retreat from the kangaroo. He now said, rather primly: '[MASK].
<name>Lord Peter Wimsey</name>	Lord Peter Wimsey	Voss	‘No, no I’ protested [MASK], with apparent amusement. ‘If she would exist!’ He laughed. ‘Such are the pitfalls of grammar. I acquire a wife by simple misuse of a tense.’
<name>Meg</name>	Meg	Laura	There is many a young fellow in the country would jump at the opportunity of union with such a respectable firm.’ ‘I do not doubt it,’ said [MASK], ‘but I would not care to be the reason for anybody’s marrying a store.’
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Voss	He had been employed those two months at the brickfields, and there was almost always some of the dust from the bricks visible in the cracks of his skin and creases of his clothes. ‘I had news,’ [MASK] said to him, ‘but have almost decided it will not interest you.’
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Boyle	These dirty maggots were at first scarcely visible in the yellow grass, but did eventually move enough, and mill round, and stamp. 'They arc a rough lot,’ said [MASK], ‘but so is your undertaking.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Betty	Particularly she loved [MASK]’s game of smoke. She would try to catch the smoke. She loved doves. She loved the marbles from the game of solitaire. If she loved her mother less than all these, it was because she had not seen her lately.
<name>The riders</name>	The riders	Trees	[MASK], too, were but illusory substance, for they would quickly turn to shadow, which is another shape of the ever-protean light. Later in the morning, when the air was beginning to solidify, the two riders were roused from themselves by sight of the promised waterholes.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Aunt	The younger woman had sat down, and, after she had reconciled her watered silk to the rather awkward litdc chair, announced with a composure that might have been rehearsed. ‘I think, [MASK], that I have a plan.’
<name>Atlas</name>	Atlas	Judd	Afterwards, he would climb back upon his horse, and sit there looking indestructible. Seldom did the action of the sun reduce him to dreams of the future. [MASK], it would sometimes appear, was himself an clement.
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Voss	It appeared that he was fascinated by the insect, glittering in its life with all the colours of decomposition, and that he had barely attended to the words of [MASK]. The latter was glad, but not glad enough.
<name>John</name>	John	Judd	I cannot It is the heat. I will not eat tonight.’ He could not. The liver stank. When [MASK] went away, which he did as respectfully as ever, he had a glittery look in his eye, and pitched the liver to the dogs.
<name>he</name>	he	Voss	He felt that he did not wish to hear his suspicions confirmed. When [MASK] was finished, he cleaned the knife of any traces of green by drawing the blade between his forefinger and thumb. Then he closed it, and put it away.
<name>Mr. Wilcox</name>	Mr. Wilcox	Voss	‘Two years and four months,’ said [MASK]. He had followed suit when she sat down. They were in almost identical positions, on similar chairs, on either side of the generous window. They were now what is called comfortable.
<name>the German</name>	the German	Voss	‘How?’ asked [MASK]. The black boy could not explain his instincts, so he smiled, and swayed his head, and avoided the expectant eyes of his superior. ‘We shall soon see,’ said the German, stooping.
<name>Billie</name>	Billie	Each	As the scum rose from the water, the men would knock it off. [MASK] was seated tailorwise, sticking the fragments of food into his mouth, and staring far too intently at the pot, the alternative of which would have been his mate’s face.
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Liz	This is the point, she felt, at which it will be decided, one way or the other, but by some superior power. Her own mind was not equal to it. ‘Will you take it, [MASK]?’
<name>Sir John</name>	Sir John	Harry	‘That, [MASK],’ he said, ‘is the Southern Cross, I believe, to the 3%> south of the mainmast. That is where, doubtless, their snake will burrow in and we shall not see him again. ‘Arc you frightened?’
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Voss	There, upon those suffocating small flowers, he had failed her kisses, but would offer himself, as another sacrifice, to other spears. The close cave intensified his personal longing. One side of him [MASK], the other his lady sister, in her cloak that was the colour of ashes.
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Belle	‘I will not deny that. And it is by being our friend that I have got to know her.’ ‘I think I shall go to bed,’ [MASK] announced, nibbling without appetite at a little biscuit that she had picked up from the silver tray.
<name>Mrs. Hudson</name>	Mrs. Hudson	Topp	They were, indeed, an ill-assorted pair, alike only in their desperate need of him. Presently [MASK]’s old housekeeper sighed her way to the upper landing with a nice sweetbread for their lodger’s supper, and a 'glass of wine that the latter knew would taste of cork.
<name>it</name>	it	Rose	‘I do not know what you are, [MASK]. You have never shown me.’ ‘Ah, now, miss, you are playing on my ignorance.’ ‘In what way?’ ‘How am I to show you what I am?
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Turner	Before retiring, rewarded the boy with a ration of damper. He was quite pleased. About this time there occurred also the incident of the mustard and cress. [MASK] had been expressing himself in something like the following strain:
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Voss	All this time [MASK] was standing his ground. He was, indeed, swaying a litdc, but the frayed ends of his trouser legs were momentarily lost in the carpet. How much less destructive of the personality are thirst, fever, physical exhaustion, he thought, much less destructive than people.
<name>Starbuck</name>	Starbuck	Jackie	His mouth, thirsty for so long, was drinking down the dark blue. ‘Yes. A comet, evidently,’ he was gulping. Then [MASK] was standing in the silence. ‘Why are you afraid?’
<name>Darcy</name>	Darcy	Angus	It was immediately apparent that this must be [MASK] who had burst in. He would be forgiven almost anything, even his wealth and his ignorance, by all but the most disgruntled, for handsome, clumsy, oblivious young men, together with thoroughbred horses and gun-dogs, cannot be held responsible.
<name>Peter</name>	Peter	Mamma	Now several of those children were kicking and shoudng. ‘We tasted the sillabub,’ they cried. ‘May I stay up tonight, [MASK]?’ ‘I will stay up.’ ‘Who said?’ ‘I did.’
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Jackie	Some were tired. Others shone with a light of inspiration and yearning. Presently, [MASK] came and sat down amongst the white men, whose ways he knew, but it soon became apparent, from his sullen manner, that he was but obeying orders.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Voss	But [MASK] was grumbling. He had grown livid. All that day he remained bones rather than flesh. iff All his days were wasting away in precise acts. His feet were heavy with dust as he tramped between shed, tent, and stock-yard.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Laura	Ah, [MASK] was crying out, bending down through that same dream, extending her hand in its black glove; you are my only friend, and I cannot reach you. As it had to be, he left her to it.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Palfreyman	the sailor asked, and looked at the convenient stranger, into whose keeping he was not afraid to give himself. ‘If it happened in a dream that was not distinguishable from the life, it is still a matter for your conscience,’ [MASK] replied.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Voss	Like all those in love, he would misinterpret lovingly. As for [MASK], he had gone on to grapple with the future, in which undertaking he did not expect much of love, for all that is soft and yielding is easily hurt.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Judd	‘What purpose will it serve?’ asked [MASK], looking at the closed rock. He had grown gloomy. ‘Some people can write it down,’ continued the boy. ‘But I cannot write no'more than speak.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Voss	So that her niece felt it her duty to approach. In leaving, she barely touched [MASK] upon the hand. He was not sure whether he was intended to go or stay, but followed immediately. They came out into the light almost together.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Palfreyman	Remembering a contentment she had experienced in the garden either from illumination or exhaustion, after the daemon had withdrawn from her, the dry mouth of any dying man was a thing of horror. The girl’s lips, in spite of her youth, were dry and cracked, [MASK] noticed with surprise.
<name>The Kid</name>	The Kid	Palfreyman	[MASK] accepted this as a joke. And they pushed on. They were riding eternally over the humped and hateful earth, which the sun had seared until the spent and crumbly stuff was become highly treacherous. It was, indeed, the bare crust of the earth.
<name>the child</name>	the child	Voss	She was consumed by the intense longing of the waves. The forms of burnt rock and scraggy pine were sharpening unbearably. Her shoulders felt narrow. ‘I would not want,’ she began. The disappearing sand that spurted up from [MASK]’s feet did fascinate.
<name>the doctor</name>	the doctor	Jim	Rescued by his wife’s words, he said in a young man’s voice: ‘Yes. The doctor. I will send [MASK] round. He will be here in two shakes. Yes. I will write a note.’ ‘And if he should be at his dinner?’
<name>the German</name>	the German	Voss	‘The map?’ said [MASK]. It was certainly a vast dream from which he had wakened. Even the draper suspected its immensity as he prodded at the coast with his ivory pointer. ‘The map?’ repeated the German. ‘I will first make it.’
<name>Major</name>	Major	Boyle	‘Did you at least question him?’ ‘Useless,’ sighed [MASK]. The Colonel would cheerfully have put under arrest this subordinate who had failed in his duties, but, in the circumstances, had to content himself with a show of blazing heartiness.
<name>unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Laura	‘Do you really think races are necessary?’ asked [MASK], who had raced in the past, but who was now tracing through some slow necessity of her own the path of the sea-worm with her toe. ‘Well, no, races are not necessary.
<name>Agamemnon</name>	Agamemnon	Judd	[MASK] had fixed the carcass above the coals of a fire, in a kind of shallow trench, and now the golden sheep was rusding with juices and spitting fat. Slabs of hot meat were presently hacked off for the whole company, who for once omitted to gnaw the bones before throwing them to the dogs.
<name>Trabb's Boy</name>	Trabb's Boy	Turner	Even so, when he struck the ground, which he did very lightly, on account of his poor condition - no umbrella, in fact, could have landed lighter - he set up a wildly importunate shrieking. ‘Save me, you beggars!’ [MASK] shrieked.
<name>Ornitha</name>	Ornitha	Palfreyman	The riders drew to a standstill, and were exchanging politenesses with the ornithologist, who was by now arrived at their stirrup-irons. ‘I can imagine your emotions, [MASK], on such an occasion,’ said the merchant.
<name>Moses</name>	Moses	Sanderson	They would pick out passages for each other as if they had been titbits of tender meat, and afterwards shine with almost physical pleasure. Beyond this, there was nothing to which a man might take exception. [MASK] tended his flocks and herds like any other Christian.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Belle	‘Where are we going?’ The little girls’ voices were imperious, if frail. Several boys left off torturing one another and ran in the wake of the girls, demanding a denouement. ‘We are going to build a temple,’ [MASK] called.
<name>Pegasus</name>	Pegasus	Birds	Then the goats were dashing down, down, down, deeper than all else. Soon their bobbing tails were lost. The horse had faith that paths do lead somewhere, and did follow, but the country itself was legendary. [MASK] plunged song-
<name>Grendel</name>	Grendel	Vermin	Then he did begin to falter, and was at last openly wearing his own sores than he had kept hidden. [MASK] were eating him. The shrivelled worms of his entrails were deriding him. So he rode on through hell, until he felt her touch him.
<name>the horseman</name>	the horseman	Turner	Nothing untoward occurred during the short journey, except that the two horsemen were soon caught in a black net of flies that had fallen upon the meat dangling from their saddles. This caused [MASK] to curse and kick, and his nag in consequence to sidle and pigroot.
<name>Quatermain</name>	Quatermain	Voss	[MASK] laughed and, looking through the doorway, remarked: ‘Here, I do believe, is the leader of the expedition.’ ‘Sir,’ decided the woman, coming round the sturdy bench, ‘that is something he would never claim.
<name>Bertha</name>	Bertha	Laura	Similar phases mark the cycle of love. Could I forget my own husband? [MASK] asked, as she nursed the baby that was playing with her chin. Yet, she did forget, frequently for whole days, and then was conscience-stricken.
<name>his mood</name>	his mood	Turner	He was so pleased, this large boy, of laughing throat But [MASK] had turned sour. He was harbouring a grievance, against no one in particular. ‘I will turn in, all right,’ he answered. ‘What else would I do?’
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Laura	‘That would be worse 1 Would it not?’ [MASK] laughed. He might have ignored her more completely if he had not permitted himself to frown. ‘In that case,’ he said, and blushed, ‘let us, rather, dance.’
<name>Roderick</name>	Roderick	Palfreyman	The men themselves were cornered by it at the roots of the tree, from where the face of each appeared to the other as desirable as rafts to shipwrecked sailors. ‘Where I have failed most wretchedly,’ [MASK] continued, ‘is in my inability to rescue my sister from her hallucinations.
<name>whoever</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage, so "whoever" is a possible answer.)	whoever (There is no proper name given in the passage, so "whoever" is a possible answer.)	Voss	The birds were screaming and ascending in red riot. ‘It is tomorrow,’ said the German precisely. All round this group hung the heat in sheets of damp silence. ‘It did not occur to me to mention it,’ said [MASK].
<name>Gregor</name>	Gregor	Voss	He could not distinguish the face, but the presence was pervading the whole dream. And now [MASK] was stirring on his straight bed. It was a humid night. His hands were attempting to free his body from the sweat with which it had been fastened.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Albert	‘I will not eat, [MASK],’ he was saying craftily, ‘and the load will be so much lighter for the provisions we do not have to carry. It is surprising how little a man need eat. I will be the headpiece, you will see.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sanderson	‘These are good people. One can see,’ he said. ‘Have they all been free settlers?’ ‘Some. Some are emancipists,’ [MASK] replied from over his shoulder. ‘There are both kinds. And there arc good and bad of each.’
<name>God</name>	God	Harry	And then: ‘Ein guter Junge.’ And again, still fascinated by his own surprising hand: 'Ach, [MASK] is, naturally, dead.’ Only he was left, only he could endure it, and that because at last he was truly humbled.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Laura	But [MASK] was, and continued, content. The vows were rigorous that she imposed upon herself, to the exclusion of all personal life, certainly of introspection, however great her longing for those delights of hell. The gaunt man, her husband, would not tempt her in.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Harry	Yet, paradoxically, his once empty face was filled with those distances. They possessed, but they eluded him; he was still, and perhaps would remain always, lost. Now, however, [MASK] and those with him were riding forth. Their purposes were set in motion.
<name>John</name>	John	Voss	Soon domestic cows had run to look, and horned rams, dragging their sex amongst the clover, were being brought to fold by I27 a youthful shepherd. But it was the valley itself which drew [MASK]. Its mineral splendours were increased in that light.
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Laura	‘Tomorrow at the latest,’ [MASK] replied. ‘I shall make a point of gathering all my strength, all the night.’ ‘Yes, yes. Rest.’ ‘So that I shall be strong enough.’
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Laura	She began to arrange the hairbrushes. ‘If I were to make some big sacrifice,’ [MASK] was saying. ‘I cannot enough, that is obvious, but something of a personal nature that will convince a wavering mind.
<name>Magwitch</name>	Magwitch	Judd	He was continually observing the convict as the latter applied the miserable hot rags, and now, from beneath his eyelids, as he thanked the man for his services. ‘And particularly for seeing fit to assume command.’ [MASK] stood there.
<name>Phileas Fogg</name>	Phileas Fogg	Voss	Although they were shivering, and their teeth chattering, it was from the cold. ‘And the compass!’ laughed [MASK], who had become a thin, distinguished, reasonable being. ‘There is no need for any compass,’ laughed the big, jolly Judd.
<name>Ophelia</name>	Ophelia	Buddhism	If she had not been at the same time, a practical woman, loving wife, and devoted mother, she might have made a religion of it, but a pretty, gentle, saffron-coloured one, like [MASK] perhaps.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Candles	He was complete. The leader looked at his subordinates, and wondered whether they knew. But an unidentified body was falling up the steep stairs of the house. It thumped, drawing all attention, then burst through the doorway of the upper room. [MASK] guttered.
<name>Dr. Jekyll</name>	Dr. Jekyll	Palfreyman	As he was moved back, his bones were creaking, and his skin had erupted in a greenish verdigris. [MASK] nearly put out his hand, to recall them both to their normal relationship, but was restrained by an access of cold.
<name>Tim</name>	Tim	Judd	'I cannot,’ [MASK] kept repeating, as he knelt upon the stones, beside the trench in which it was intended to put the dead man, ‘but would if I had the education.’ It was terrible for him to have to admit.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Voss	In addition to these, there was the invisible Edith, whose oo-errr was heard once from behind doors, and who would gollop the remainders of puddings before walking home. [MASK] ate with appetite, taking everything for granted.
<name>Miss Bates</name>	Miss Bates	Laura	‘Oh yes, thank you, the baby is well,’ she answered, high and bright, descending with some skill to a darker key: ‘I wish I could say the same of [MASK], who devotes herself to the child so unselfishly, her own health must suffer in the end.’
<name>Gregor</name>	Gregor	Palfreyman	Rather was he moved by a dream, [MASK] sensed. Through some trick of moonlight or uncertainty of behaviour, the head became detached for a second and appeared to have been fixed upon a beam of the wooden wall. The mouth and the eyes were visible.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Voss	‘But 1 will ride over and speak with this poet.’ The stone figures of his men submitted. [MASK] rode across, sustained by a belief that he must communicate intuitively with these black subjects, and finally rule them with a sympathy that was above words.
<name>she</name>	she	Laura	She was a golden animal that would fall asleep immediately on curling up. After that, everybody went. So the victim was saved up for the future. During the weeks that followed nothing more was said, and [MASK] could have been happy if she had not suspected silence.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Judd	‘Go to bed now,’ he said. ‘I cannot allow myself to suspect a brave man of cowardice.’ ‘It is not cowardice, if there is hell before and hell behind, and nothing to choose between them,’ [MASK] protested.
