<name>Blanche</name>	Blanche	Warren	Descending the steep stairs, she was so rattled she nearly fell. She’d made up her mind to tell [MASK] the girl would have to go. Go where? I don’t care where the hell. But out of this house. Are you crazy?
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Norma	He went downstairs, to help her in the kitchen. There was [MASK] breathless with her bouquet, a light film of perspiration on her face. She’d picked pale blue hydrangea and a few stems of red climber roses, their leaves stippled with a black fungus.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Marilyn	The white fox stole was slipping from her shoulders. She was in childish terror, she’d be revealed to him only partially clothed. He’d risen awkwardly to his feet, a tall muscular figure with surprisingly dark hair. He said, “[MASK]?”
<name>Reggie</name>	Reggie	Otto	Staring at her old friend [MASK], who’d never been her lover or even, in fact, her friend. He was all she had from the days of her youth. She said in her Marilyn voice, so soft and whis-pery it was almost inaudible, “Oh.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Fleece	’d pulled away the tinsel paper with trembling fingers and at first she’d thought—oh, this was crazy but she thought the tiger might be the one stolen from her at the Home, [MASK] had said she’d stolen it out of jealousy but maybe (maybe!)
<name>Magda</name>	Magda	Angel	I just learned that today. The Dark Prince said Your lover’s a Jew, eh? and quickly she said We are not lovers. We love each other from a distance. The Dark Prince laughed, saying Keep that distance, [MASK]. And you’ll keep your love.
<name>Lolita</name>	Lolita	Angela	It’s no accident that the first time [MASK] is seen, she lies asleep on a sofa in a twisted position and we see her through her elder lover’s possessive eyes. Oh! I must have fallen asleep.
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	Norma	The cats were strangely silent and crouched separate from one another; they kept their distance as [MASK] set down their dishes, then hurried in to eat, swift as little machines, and as soon as they finished eating they trotted away without a backward glance.
<name>Deleuze</name>	Deleuze	Norma	How can we forget the actor “acts”? Is the actor “acting” on our behalf? Is the subtext of the actor’s “acting” always and forever our own buried (and denied) “acting”? One of [MASK]’s numerous books
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	Esther	The Playwright knew, if he embraced [MASK], she would stiffen in irony and say, “Why? Why now?” Hardly could her husband say Because I am falling in love with another woman. Help me! Still, he believed their love hadn’t ceased but had only faded.
<name>Jolene</name>	Jolene	Cherie	I shut my eyes and saw a sandy bank, a shallow muddy creek and a single tall spindly tree with exposed, ropy roots like veins. The family was living in a battered trailer in a mound of rusted cans and vines. [MASK] with her younger brothers and sisters.
<name>She</name>	She	Gladys	People came into her room at night, [MASK] said, and were making a film of her. And doing things to her with surgical instruments. Other patients were encouraged to steal from her. At the time of an earthquake such things happened because there was nobody to govern.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Warren	The buttercup-yellow plastic plates she would set prominently on the kitchen table for [MASK] to discover and wonder—what the hell? She could imagine the quizzical look on his face. And he’d like being told the good news. He’d smile, maybe.
<name>Angelique</name>	Angelique	Marilyn	She did not read the trash tabloids. She saw few Hollywood people. She had a new telephone number and a new address. She’d sent a bottle of champagne to her agent with a note: [MASK] is permanently on her honeymoon. Don’t pursue & don’t interrupt!
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Nell	She didn’t tell N that she was a poet and she deserved words of her own. She was furious with the injustice of [MASK]’s fate. For madness must be punished in a world in which mere sanity is prized. The revenge of the ordinary upon the gifted.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Cherie	I wish we were married now. I don’t think I’d be afraid then. But what are you afraid of, darling? Try to tell me. I can’t hear you, darling. Please. I think . . . I’m afraid of [MASK].
<name>Watch</name>	Watch	Gulls	If you hate your life. [MASK], shore-birds. They circled above her screaming. She ran into the surf, the first of the waves, always you’re surprised at the strength of the surf, the chill of the waves.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Bovary	She sweated, yet she was shivering. And her breath like copper pennies held in the hand. Why was he thinking, panicked, of [MASK]’s dying? The hideous protracted agony. The protruding tongue, the beautiful pale-skinned woman contorted in death.
<name>Orson</name>	Orson	H.	She complained of [MASK] “Everybody says he’s a genius. Some genius! What he loves is gambling and horses. He’s in this project for the money. He doesn’t respect actors.” The playwright husband asked, “Why are we in this project?”
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Rose	Her eyes were narrowed, peering beyond the garishly lit set as into the shadowy regions of the past. “Later, [MASK] took the baby out of the drawer and wrapped it in a towel and buried it in a secret place. No one ever knew.”
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Elsie	There was somebody bawling out of the little plastic radio on the porch railing, sounded like—who was it?—Caruso. [MASK] did what she never would do, switched the radio off. “Ever think about it? Getting married? You’ll be sixteen in June.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Darling	All over the world. My face on the cover! My mother will see it; oh, what if the reporter says awful things about me? About my family? About. . . you? [MASK], I’m sure that won’t happen.
<name>Dostoevsky</name>	Dostoevsky	Dostoyevsky	The Playwright seemed to be impressed with her knowledge of books but sometimes he smiled in a way that meant she’d said something wrong or mispronounced a word. But how do you know what words sound like, from just reading? Those names in [MASK]’s novels!
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Monroe	You could see it was genius and maybe genius turns to sickness if it can’t get out, which I guess eventually happened with her, the way she went to pieces those last years. But I had [MASK] in her prime. There was nobody like her.
<name>David</name>	David	Elsie	There was the age difference, only six years, which would mean nothing to adults—in fact, it would be in the girl’s favor to be six years younger— but at his age, his mother told [MASK], six years seemed almost too much.
<name>Tralala</name>	Tralala	Rose	A woman might be a man’s wife and not love him, and who she wants to make love with is her own choice. Her life’s her own even to throw away. I loved [MASK]. Maybe I was the only woman in the audience
<name>Playwright</name>	Playwright	Norma	The single carved mahogany grandfather clock that [MASK] had managed to rouse into life was calmly ticking, its smooth dully gleaming gold pendulum keeping an unhurried beat. The Captain’s House was a snug ship floating on a grassy-green sea, and the Playwright, the man of the city, was himself the Captain.
<name>Marilyn</name>	Marilyn	Cherie	It was going to be fine. As on the set of Bus Stop he’d seen her panic and freeze and back off, and yet after a while she’d return, and there was [MASK] more intense, more alive, more flamelike and convincing than ever.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Norma	Greeting their guests and hurrying away almost immediately to leave him with his friends, shy as a feral cat. Was this a form of stage fright? He wouldn’t chide [MASK], don’t give them fuel to talk about us! Meaning To talk about you.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Shinn	Or had she misunderstood? She said, faltering, “It comes to the same thing, then. His father disinherited and disowned him. He’s alone.” [MASK] snorted in derision. “No more alone than the rest of us.”
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Magda	The audience relaxed and began to laugh, for the scene was tenderly comic in a mode unlike anything the Playwright, revered for his seriousness, had ever attempted. The scene ended with [MASK]’s “golden laughter.” The Playwright laughed too, a startled laughter of recognition.
<name>We</name>	We	Nerves’—we	There’s nothing wrong with you really. ‘[MASK] all have ‘nerves.’ There’s a fulltime doctor at The Studio who’s hired just to prescribe nerve pills for actors. I refuse. I would rather be nervous, I think.”
<name>X</name>	X	DOC	. seems to have had a number of rather crude abortions. Frankly, it’s a miracle she ever conceived at all. Y: I don’t believe this. My wife has never had— [MASK]: Mr.----------, I’m sorry. Y exits (quickly?
<name>Blond Actress</name>	Blond Actress	Easter	It had something to do with [MASK]. The Blond Actress was brought to the Los Angeles Orphans Home Society in a black limousine with an interior plush and sumptuous as the cushioned interior of a casket. In his uniform and visored cap the Frog Chauffeur was behind the wheel.
<name>Marilyn</name>	Marilyn	Desdemona	American-girl revenge. The renowned British actor O had expected emotional outbursts, crude hysteria; he’d been warned that the Blond Actress was “difficult.” He had not expected so passive and lethal a revenge. Thinking I was dumb-blond [MASK].
<name>Alvina</name>	Alvina	Nell	“Mother, forgive me! I love you.” 8 She had not intended it. She would not have exploited her mother. Perhaps she was unconscious of it, in fact. The hands! [MASK]’s restless seeking hands. Hands of madness.
<name>Isadora</name>	Isadora	Monroe	A ballet of death. The expression on [MASK]’s perfect face when she realizes. She is going to die! Her husband is Death! The Playwright, staring up at the flickering screen images in silence, had been moved as never before by any film.
<name>Mother</name>	Mother	Gladys	I dreamt it died.” “It died, Mother.” “Was it a little girl? Did they tell you?” “I had a miscarriage, Mother. In just the sixth week. I was terribly sick.” [MASK] nodded gravely.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Bucky	[MASK] saw the connection, the way it would figure in the girl’s head. “You didn’t hear it, I guess? Maybe you were too young. We heard it at our house. Oh boy, was that something!
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Rose	(And if circumstances weren’t always ideal, what’s the difference?) She’d have this glazed look like she’d just been fucked. And a smell coming off her you couldn’t mistake. That was [MASK]!
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Nifmski	[MASK]. But I didn’t know what I knew. In practice. It was just. . . what happened when I had to perform. To improvise. Like striking a match. . .. The hell with that. You were a natural actress from the start.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Otto	“American c-collaboration? What do you mean, [MASK]? I thought we s-saved—” “We ‘saved’ the death-camp survivors because it was good propaganda, but we didn’t prevent six million deaths.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Gladys	[MASK] parked the car in front of a cheap Spanish-style stucco building with decaying green awnings and disfiguring fire escapes, the hacienda, rooms & efficency APTS weekly MONTHLY RENTAL INQUIRE WITHIN. The street number was 387.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Holyrod	She was enthusiastic as a young girl when they spoke, yet weeks passed and he would not hear from her or [MASK]; if he telephoned they rarely returned his calls; the project had languished. Because I am too frightened. Can’t face a living audience.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Beautiful	Fire burning inside me! [MASK]. True, at other times she was susceptible to “the blues,” “down in the dumps,” “the pit.” Like my soul is molten lead, leaked out and hardened.
<name>She</name>	She	Nell	6 Calm as a wind-up doll. Yet invisibly she was tense, quivering. Her skin was clammy-pale ([MASK]’s skin was clammy-pale) yet heated to the touch. When we kissed I sucked his soul into me like a tongue.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Elsie	You’d have to love a boy really well for that.” [MASK] said lightly, “There must be one of them you could love, isn’t there? I’ve been hearing some things about you, sweetie.”
<name>Blond Actress</name>	Blond Actress	Marilyn	Only your life is your life, [MASK].” It would not escape the Blond Actress that her dark-mirror sister had been sent to her, an emissary, to deliver a profound truth; yet it was not a truth the Blond Actress could accept.
<name>DeMille</name>	DeMille	H	Trying to read the script 8c her vision was blurred. Already it was noon 8c she’d been due on the set at 10 a.m. 8c she believed she might yet prepare herself to arrive on the set by mid-or late afternoon 8c hoped that [MASK] would be sympathetic.
<name>Blanche</name>	Blanche	Cherie	We stared at this gorgeous woman gnawing at her bitten thumbnail like a girl in acting class, or like an actual simple-hearted girl, knowing damned well she’s been bad and she’s waiting to be scolded. She’d been trailing her bedraggled feather boa along the floor just like [MASK].
<name>He</name>	He	Cass	So many roses thrust at her. And some had fallen to the ground. The plane landing had frightened her, a bumpy landing in sulfurous swirling smog, and this greeting had frightened her even more. [MASK] was deeply moved, gazing into her eyes.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Gladys	For our pride and our stupidity. Earthquakes, fires, and the air smothering us. Some of us were born here, and some of us will die here. It’s a pact we’ve made with the devil. ” [MASK] paused, out of breath.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Cass	Yet the river of night bore her innocently aloft, the river nourished her. Never so healthy, Mother! Why didn’t you tell me having a baby would be like this! [MASK] said, clearing his throat, a little edgy, like an actor not up for his scene, “Hey.
<name>Xenia</name>	Xenia	Rose	The guy is some kind of war-combat psycho, a pathetic case, but the audience doesn’t give a shit about him. Everybody’s always waiting for “[MASK]” to come back on-screen. She’s just luscious and over-the-top evil.
<name>Marilyn</name>	Marilyn	Norma	She was no longer his Magda, nor was she his Roslyn, he knew!—yet he would care for her 8c he would forgive her (if she wished forgiveness; this wasn’t certain). Guardedly he asked, “Are you certain you want to do this film, [MASK]?
<name>Rosemary</name>	Rosemary	V	In his unpressed gabardine suit he wasn’t one of the M-G-M party but it was clear that some of the guests knew him, as [MASK] did, and looked aside embarrassed and frowning. “Excuse me? Excuse me? Will you sign, please?”
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Elsie	It was nearly pitch-dark in the bedroom and [MASK] expected him to fumble for the wall switch but he didn’t and by the time she managed to lean over to reach for the bedside lamp it was too late. He was on her.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Pearlman	[MASK] was always saying how surprised he was by you. What you’re really like. But. . . what’d that be? What I’m really like? Just yourself. But that isn’t enough, is it? Of course it is. No.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Norma	After the trauma of the lassoed and finally released mustangs, they are driving “home.” They are guided by a “north star.” If I couldn’t give you a baby in life, [MASK], I will give you a baby in this dream of you.
<name>Playwright</name>	Playwright	Norma	You know generally, if not in exhaustive detail. You already know, [MASK].” Was this true? It was true. The Playwright was the master of words. When he entered a room, words flew to him like iron filings to a magnet.
<name>Judy</name>	Judy	Marilyn	So drunk, [MASK] had to be aimed from backstage and practically caught by her underarms by the broadly grinning emcee and walked to the microphone. So tightly stitched into that ridiculous dress and in her spike-heeled shoes she could barely walk, in mincing baby steps.
<name>Marilyn</name>	Marilyn	Rose	Never had he seen any woman like [MASK]. He’d seen the movie alone in a Times Square theater and he believed that there could be no man in the audience who felt otherwise than he felt. No man is equal to her. She has to die.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Mouse	You could look nowhere except at ME. “Hey, look at [MASK]. Pret-fy.” One of them had found a compact with loose fragrant peach-colored powder inside and a badly soiled powder puff. Another had found a lipstick, bright coral pink.
<name>Marilyn</name>	Marilyn	Tasting	[MASK] panic, then realizing The hunger of strangers is boundless and can never be appeased. By the very end of the Year of Wonders 1953, the Blond Actress had become skeptical. To be skeptical is to be melancholy. To be melancholy is to be publicly funny.
<name>Georgette</name>	Georgette	Whitey	[MASK]’s deft fingers and cotton swabs soaked in astringent. His soothing ointments, his eyelash curlers and tweezers and tiny brushes and colored pencils, his pastes, rouges, powders working their magic, or almost working their magic.
<name>Madeline</name>	Madeline	Cherie	He seemed to her too scrupulously polite; too much in awe of her; even wary of her. The way he stared when she came on the set as [MASK] in her showgirl costume, tops of her breasts exposed and legs in black fishnet stockings, like a man in a dream.
<name>her</name>	her	Elsie	Some girls looked shocked and scared when she told them; some burst into hysterical giggles; some stared at [MASK] in disbelief. Others were only just embarrassed because they already knew more than they wanted to know about sex.
<name>Star</name>	Star	Marilyn	Maybe, she even thought, if [MASK]’s in the helicopter, it can’t crash. Or maybe, like she assured us, in this little-girl voice to die for—If my number’s up it’s up. Or not.
<name>Yeats</name>	Yeats	Chekhov	Confronted with a woman’s obstinacy, as with his wife’s, and long ago his mother’s. The women he knew were susceptible to single, simple ideas that lodged in their brains like pellets and could not be dislodged by argument, common sense, logic. I am nothing like the poet [MASK].
<name>Marilyn</name>	Marilyn	Russell	Evasively he said, “The deal is pending. [MASK] has to be lent by another studio.” “Yes, but how much?” “The figures aren’t finalized.” “How much?” “They’re asking one hundred thousand.”
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Rose	Maybe I was the only woman in the audience but I’d guess not, the movie was such a smash, long lines waiting to get in like a kids’ Saturday matinee. [MASK] was so beautiful and sexy, you wanted her to get her way.
<name>lotion</name>	lotion	Noxzema	His forehead, nose, and cheeks were sunburnt; her face was pale, for she’d shielded her sensitive skin from the sun with a wide-brimmed straw hat. She rubbed [MASK] into his smarting skin, gently. And were his forearms burnt too?
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Norma	It wasn’t enough to underline these prophetic words in Civilization and Its Discontents. [MASK] was compelled to copy them into her notebook. We are never so defenseless against suffering as when we love, never so helplessly unhappy as when we have lost our loved object or its love.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Fleece	[MASK], you were! To you, maybe. But not in my heart. You were kind to me. I never forgot. That’s why I want to give you things now. And in my will. Hey, don’t talk like that.
<name>Offred</name>	Offred	Marilyn	This had been [MASK]’s secret no one knew. After the Operation. After Baby was taken from her. Her punishment was throbbing uterine pain. At first heavy bleeding (she didn’t dispute, she deserved), and then a slower blood-seeping, hot damp moisture like tears draining from her womb.
<name>Blanche</name>	Blanche	Rose	And the baby died. I didn’t realize it consciously but that’s why I play [MASK] this way. She has to be more than the script says; she’s a woman with a secret. I can remember how it happened.”
<name>Joyce</name>	Joyce	Pearlman	Death is just the last scene of the last act. We’re in rehearsal!” The Playwright, given to brooding self-doubt, afflicted with a vanity very different from [MASK]’s, had to admire this man. What energy! What supreme self-confidence!
<name>Yolanda</name>	Yolanda	Frankie	[MASK], who’d lost her respect when he’d tried to kill himself with sleeping pills. “For love. For me. Somebody called an ambulance, not me, 8c they saved him. I told him, ‘You shithead. Women take sleeping pills.
<name>Yulia</name>	Yulia	Momma	Garlic! So much garlic. Their food was saturated with it. The smell of garlic on her in-laws’ breaths. On the mother-in-law’s breath. And bad teeth. [MASK] leaning close.
<name>Marilyn</name>	Marilyn	Roslyn	The husband would not be jealous of a doomed homosexual actor, he had too much pride. She saw the hurt in his eyes and touched his arm. (Her first touch in days.) Suddenly she was [MASK], blond healing beauty in soft focus.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Bucky	That evening The March of Time thundered. The marching music was so loud and thrilling your heartbeat quickened. This was real-life footage. This was real. For the war news [MASK] sat bolt upright, staring at the screen. His jaws ceased their popcorn grinding.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Warren	and she’d provoked him so there was justice in it, wasn’t there? Before climbing onto the bed [MASK] had unzipped and unbuckled his trousers and kicked them off, but he still wore his smelly undershirt. She would suffocate in the coarse hairs of his body.
<name>Delores</name>	Delores	Cherie	Laughter isn’t cruel? Maybe it is. Not when the performer controls it. You’re the performer, and you’re in control. But [MASK] doesn’t know she’s funny. She thinks she will be a star. That’s why she’s funny.
<name>Marilyn</name>	Marilyn	Meat	Don’t say it’s a joke. If it’s a joke it’s a filthy joke. Breasts spilling out of her clothes. That Photoplay award dinner. At the Oscar award ceremony. Said she wasn’t going, yet she did. Is that what you are? [MASK]?
<name>Blanche</name>	Blanche	Nell	The stranger arrives, knocking at [MASK]’s door. His taunting eyes move upon her; his appraisal is unmistakably sexual. He has brought a bottle of rye, he’s excited and nervous too. Her eyelids quiver as if he’s stroked her belly; her childish voice drops—“You like the way I look?”
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Gladys	After we die, will it be the same thing as it was before we were born? Or a different kind of nothingness? Because there might be knowledge then. Memory.” [MASK] shifted uneasily in her straight-backed chair and made no reply.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Rose	7 The Slut. [MASK] is taunting her husband because he’s no good to her, he’s not a man. She wants him dead and gone. Because he’s not a man, and a woman needs a man.
<name>Shakespeare</name>	Shakespeare	Chekhov	“Certainly not. It’s helpful.” “Your play is nothing like . . . that one.” “No, it isn’t. I’ve never been much drawn to [MASK].” The Playwright spoke with care. He forced himself to smile.
<name>you</name>	you	Cherie	They don’t understand. They laugh because you’re funny. You make [MASK] funny. The laughter isn’t cruel, it’s sympathetic. They see themselves in you. Laughter isn’t cruel? Maybe it is. Not when the performer controls it.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Rollo	She’d been drinking vodka and the Blond Actress laughed in her new gut-laughter way, like a North Carolina farm girl who didn’t give a shit for the film industry or her own beauty or talent. “You said it, [MASK].
<name>He</name>	He	W	In the wicker wastebasket, coiled together and stiffened like slug fossils, you knew what you’d see, so why look? She laughed now, turning with charming awkwardness—“Oh! What—?” so [MASK] could steady her, comfort her as in a gesture of masculine protectiveness.
<name>Thaddeus</name>	Thaddeus	Baby	Suddenly seeing a scattering of feral-cat faces 8c grinning carnivore teeth. The snubbed noses of cats 8c erect, pointed ears. Those cats! At the Captain’s House. The horror of it struck her: “They were the ones, they wanted [MASK] dead.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Fie	[MASK] laughed, finishing his drink, a scotch and soda prepared as ineptly as a child might prepare it, and in the wrong kind of glass and the rim chipped. “ ‘See no evil, hear no evil.’ My strategy, too.”
<name>she</name>	she	Elsie	That was years ago, longer ago than [MASK] wished to recall. In the succeeding years her husband had grown into an even bigger man: shoulders, chest, belly. His massive forearms, his looming head. Wiry tufts of graying-black hair everywhere you could see.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	W	Or waking up in bed?” This was more a breathless inquiry than a statement. In [MASK]’s presence as in the presence of any man of power you didn’t make statements except in the form of inquiries. This was only good manners, female tact.
<name>Norma</name>	Norma	Whitey	She’d kissed [MASK]’s hands in gratitude. Seeing her blond beauty restored in the mirror. If not in her heart, in the mirror. And here was her Magic Friend blond and triumphant looming above the marquee of the Sepulveda Theater laughing as if nothing ugly had ever happened to her, and never would.
<name>Ardis</name>	Ardis	Monroe	but you nobody else This curse of a compulsion! It was the Beggar Maid’s punishment. On the set came spontaneous applause. It was [MASK]’s first full day, she’d been sick 8c absent 8c rumors circulated 8c there was her tall pale bespectacled husband in attendance like a mourner 8c
<name>the girl</name>	the girl	Angela	On the floor, on her back, arms outstretched, the girl earnestly explains to the director that the character’s first scene begins with her asleep on a sofa so she has to lie down on the floor, that’s how she’s been rehearsing. The first time you see [MASK] she’s asleep.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Gladys	And noisy, filling the room. But [MASK] didn’t notice and didn’t scold. In her exaltation staring greedily at the man-in-the-photograph. Saying, in a voice rushing and ecstatic as a singer’s, “ Your father.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Norma	At first [MASK] had tried to befriend them, even to pet them, but they hissed at her and shrank away, baring their teeth. Since there was an outdoor entrance to the cellar it wasn’t unreasonable to think that one of the cats might have gotten inside and become trapped.
