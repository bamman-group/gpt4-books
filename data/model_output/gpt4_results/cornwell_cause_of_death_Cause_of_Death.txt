<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Lucy	Nearby, on a dresser top were FBI credentials, a pistol and car keys. I spotted file folders and pieces of paper scribbled with notes, and I spotted unfamiliar clothing hanging inside the closet. “Tell me about T. C.,” I said. [MASK] opened a tea bag.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Mullen	“Excuse me,” a quavering voice barely said, and at least one of the hostages was a woman. “I need to go to the bathroom.” “[MASK], you take her. We don’t want nobody shitting in here.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Wesley	“He dies, we’ve got this place wired. You understand? We’re going to blow you fucking up if you don’t do something now!” We knew who he meant, so [MASK] did not ask again.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Danny	He crossed the street to his car and opened the trunk. When he returned, he was carrying the usual large brown paper bag police used for evidence. While I held it open, he maneuvered the comb and pencils to drop [MASK]’s leftovers inside.
<name>Raymond</name>	Raymond	Marino	“I spoke the truth, that’s all,” I said. “Maybe someday her family will speak it, too.” We were in sight of [MASK]’s car, and he was sitting in it, as usual, and puffing away.
<name>Interpol</name>	Interpol	CP&L	“[MASK] has made available any resource it has to help us resolve this crisis. The Learjet belongs to them.” The white jet was sleek, with burlwood and teal green leather seats, but it was loud, so we could not speak softly.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Danny	“That means no bragging to the boys, no trying to impress your family or your girlfriend. You got that?” [MASK] held in his anger as he made an incision low around the back of the head, ear to ear.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Marino	“Oh no,” I said as the beating sound got louder. “[MASK], don’t let them get near.” But it was too late, and we looked up as a news helicopter appeared and began circling low.
<name>Reilly</name>	Reilly	Janet	For that matter, we don’t know that she wasn’t the one who poisoned him. After all, she’s a scientist.” “Damn.” “I’m assuming you’ve interviewed her,” I said. “[MASK] has.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Lucy	“And we really can’t be certain he didn’t do that.” “Right,” [MASK] said. “He wipes out all his work so that after he’s gone, no one’s going to see anything he doesn’t want them to see.
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Bear	“Look at him. He is white as snow and does not breathe. He is dead!” They were screaming at each other, and [MASK]’s boots were loud as he strode over to me and demanded, “He’s not dead, is he?”
<name>Lucifer</name>	Lucifer	Eddings	“These people are consorting with evil,” I said. “And I respect that there is evil in the world and it is not to be taken lightly. Where exactly in [MASK]’s house did you find this God-awful book?”
<name>Chubs</name>	Chubs	Jerod	He squatted beside me and lowered his voice as if we were about to conspire. “You, [MASK] and I will be in constant contact with each other over the buddy phones.” They looked like bright red gas masks with a five-strap harness in back.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Janet	It’s not the church. It’s not society. It’s not even [MASK]’s parents, who simply may not understand. I thought you were stronger than this.” “I am strong.” “Well, I’ve had enough,” I said.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Marino	So I could not leave it here, even though I knew how [MASK] would feel when I returned it to his trunk. I found him walking around, his sunglasses on. “What now?” he said. “Please pop the trunk.”
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Marino	I wondered if we would reach a point when all of us lived in bubbles so we did not die of diseases like the Ebola virus and AIDS. “I just think she’s acting a little weird,” [MASK] went on as his window rolled up.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Lucy	[MASK] looked curiously at me. “You’re not getting superstitious on us, are you?” “These people are consorting with evil,” I said. “And I respect that there is evil in the world and it is not to be taken lightly.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Benton	He rubbed the back of my neck and kissed it. “We should get a little something to eat. It’s going to be a long day.” “[MASK], I don’t like living this way,” I said as he shut the door.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Marino	I was pulling off thick athletic socks. “Well, I guess the killer could have taken it, or it could have gotten lost.” I thought of the helicopter making a bigger mess, and I had heard that [MASK] had been on the news.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Marino	“What we need to do is raid the asshole’s farm,” [MASK] said as he got up from the table. “That should have been done a long time “What probable cause would anybody have?”
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Roche	“I’m sorry,” I muttered. He was eyeing me with concern while [MASK] wandered around as if he had never been inside a morgue, peering through glass cabinets and glancing back in my direction. “Everything all right?”
<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Toto	She briefly paused, then went on as if she had not heard what the person just said. “Look, I’ll do the C code before morning. We gotta be sharp or [MASK]’s going to end up stuck or falling down stairs.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Lucy	It was [MASK]’s strained voice. I turned over and slowly sat up. My hands and the side of my face that had been in water were numb, and I looked around, dazed. I was shaking so badly my teeth were chattering as she squatted beside me, gun in hand.
<name>He</name>	He	Marino	[MASK] regarded me in silence for a moment. “See, that’s what I was just saying. You went there tonight.” “Yes, I did.” His jaw muscles bunched as he looked away. “That’s exactly what I mean.”
<name>He</name>	He	Ted	Sometimes she brings him food. [MASK] can never bother with cooking.” “When was the last time she went by?” “I don’t know,” she said, and I could tell she was getting weary of questions.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Danny	“[MASK] picked up your ride around three-thirty, which is the time they told you it would be ready.” “What do you mean, the time they told me?” “The time they told you when you called.”
<name>David</name>	David	Matthews	I looked at peaks and valleys of what could have been a scary cardiogram while [MASK] made notes. “Would you like printouts of all of this?” he asked. “Please. What is depleted uranium used for?” “Generally, it’s worthless.”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Danny	“He allegedly died in a carjacking. Do we have any further information on that?” “Right now we don’t.” “[MASK]’s death could have been signed out as the same sort of thing,” I said. “Or yours could have.
<name>James</name>	James	Mant	“Oh, that’s brilliant. He will be absolutely thrilled.” I caught another taxi as I thought about what I believed she had just said. No matter [MASK]’s reason for what he had done, I could not help but feel slightly furious.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Marino	He looked around some more. “Well, it seems she’s gotten married,” he said. “That’s the headline of the day.” I was quite taken aback. “[MASK],” I quietly said. “I’m so sorry.”
<name>Annabelle</name>	Annabelle	Connie	There’s a rumor in the Bureau that he and [MASK] have split.” I did not know what to say. “Obviously, I can’t verify that this is true,” she went on. “But I’ve heard some of what’s being said.
<name>He</name>	He	Wesley	“It would seem that the revelation most dangerous to them would be the plan they’ve already carried out,” I replied. “Of course. They couldn’t carry it out if someone tipped their hand.” [MASK] looked at me, a thousand thoughts in his eyes.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Lucy	I’ve never understood why people cook lasagne for hours. And then they wonder why everything is leathery.” [MASK] was staring at me, resting a paring knife on a side of the salad bowl. She had cut enough celery and carrots for a marching band.
<name>Janet</name>	Janet	Rose	With a growing sense of hopelessness, I carefully walked over slippery tile while they mopped and wiped. As my office came in sight, I braced myself, then stopped inside my doorway. My secretary was already at work inside. “Okay,” I said to [MASK].
<name>McGraw</name>	McGraw	Young	His long pause was followed by the rather defensive remark, “As far as I know, I’m the first one notifying you.” “An officer named [MASK] called me at quarter past five this morning. Let me see.” I checked the call sheet.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Danny	“Those aren’t normal barns,” the attorney general observed. “What was being shipped off his farm?” “Or to it,” the senator said. I reminded them of what [MASK]’s killer had tracked into the carpet of my former Mercedes.
<name>Dirk</name>	Dirk	Marino	“Absolutely.” “How?” [MASK] wanted to know. “A number of things,” he said. “For example, when ships are stored at the Inactive Yard, their missile and torpedo tubes are covered with steel plates outside the hull.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Kay	“[MASK]?” He waited near my doorway, and I heard ice softly rattle. “Whoever lives here keeps very fine Scotch. I’ve been told we are to help ourselves.” He walked in and set tumblers on the sill.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ted	[MASK] got him to talk when no one else could. That was when everyone was saying the governor was using drugs and associating with immoral women.” “Oh, yes,” I replied as if the same had never been said of other governors.
<name>She</name>	She	Molly	All I want to do is help, if I can.” “[MASK] said I made her feel rejected,” he went on. “And you probably did. How long have you had this problem?” “I don’t know, Thanksgiving.”
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Eddings	“What else did you find in [MASK]’s apartment?” I asked him. I could see his reluctance as he stared off, and I did not understand it. “I’ll serve dinner first and then we’ll sit down and talk,” I said.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Marino	[MASK] took a chair. “You got some other people coming?” “Actually, I do,” he replied. I stood where I was and would not give him my eyes any longer than was polite. “I’ll tell you what,” he reconsidered.
<name>Officer</name>	Officer	Marino	“So that ought to make you feel a little better,” [MASK] went on. I looked at him. His stiff white collar was rimmed in sweat, and his belt with all its gear creaked as he moved.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucy	She says you’re the first woman I fell in love with, and somehow that explains everything,” [MASK] went on in an ironic tone. “Never mind that this would be called incest or that you’re straight.
<name>Chigurh</name>	Chigurh	Green	“Now that boy’s cold.” “He don’t feel it now.” I controlled my mounting irritation as I said to [MASK], “I know you’re eager to get started, and so am I. But I don’t see any rescuers or police.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Roche	“If we forget them, then something is wrong with us,” I said. [MASK] emerged from the locker room looking like a disposable astronaut in his face shield and paper suit. He kept his distance from the gurney but got as close as he could to me.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Marino	“Oh, now here we go.” [MASK] was reviewing a bank statement. “On December tenth, three thousand dollars was wired to his account.” He opened another envelope and looked some more. “Same thing for November.”
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Wesley	I needed a car and wondered if I should rent one, and I needed to change my clothes but did not know what to wear. It bothered me that the thought of [MASK] would still make me conscious of what I put on, and as minutes crept forward I became truly afraid to see him.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Danny	“I’ve never used one.” I undermined the midline chest incision laterally. Reflecting back tissue, I formed a pocket in a side of skin, which [MASK] filled with water. Then I immersed my hand and inserted the scalpel blade between two ribs.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Marino	“Someone shot us in our sleep. Nine-millimeter to the back of the head. They made it look like a robbery.” “Oh really?” [MASK] asked, pulling on rabbit fur-lined gloves. “And where was yours truly?
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Lucy	The windows where we believed they watched were open, but I could not see anything behind their screens. We walked around to the front of the RV where half a dozen police and agents were in plain clothes surrounding [MASK], and the sight of her almost stopped my heart.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Chesapeake	I said to him. “A few.” He looked like he might throw up. “Why don’t you go sit down over there,” I suggested none too kindly as I wondered why [MASK] had assigned him to this case or any case.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Separation	That was our only excuse and would hold up in no court I knew. [MASK] had been very hard, so we were hungry with each other all night. Then at dawn I drifted off to sleep long enough to awaken and find him gone, as if it all had been a dream.
<name>Dirk</name>	Dirk	Lucy	“No arch,” [MASK] noted. “They sure look like dive boots or aqua shoes to me. Now that’s bizarre.” I got up and stared out over the wall at dark, heaving water. It seemed inconceivable that someone could have come up from the sea.
<name>Stevenson</name>	Stevenson	Eddings	“Then they moved it up.” I wasn’t surprised in light of what had happened lately. “Yes,” he said. “It was suddenly rescheduled a couple of days before [MASK] was killed.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Danny	“And sometimes people you don’t know very well are worse than ones you don’t know at all. You trusted [MASK] because you liked him and thought he did a good job. But he could have been into anything behind the scenes, and you weren’t going to know.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Rose	I’ll take care of this.” “[MASK], we will take care of this together,” I stubbornly replied. “I can’t believe that stupid security guard.” “What security guard?” I stopped what I was doing and looked at her.
<name>Yassen</name>	Yassen	Eddings	“What about the hookah’s intake valve and tubes and so on?” “Inconclusive.” I was not surprised, nor did it really matter since there was now no doubt that [MASK] had been poisoned with cyanide gas, his manner of death unequivocally a homicide.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Jerod	“Need some help?” It was [MASK] who spoke. “No. I’ve got him. You can start pulling.” I felt the hose move. “Okay. I’m going to guide him up,” I said. “You keep pulling.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Wesley	“I’m glad you’re here,” I said, because I knew I was part of the reason, no matter what he claimed. [MASK] was back, and he had balanced a paper plate of dough- nuts on top of cups of coffee.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Marino	So I had been here many times, usually with [MASK]. It was a true neighborhood bar, and at this hour, tables were still full, smoke thick in the air, the television loudly playing old Howie Long clips on ESPN.
<name>James</name>	James	Lucy	The mention of his name was disturbing, and I looked out the window at unnavigable water moving thickly between big, dark rocks. The sun was lighting up gray clouds in the eastern part of the sky, and I heard the shower running in the back part of the house where [MASK] was staying.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Frost	[MASK] showed me what looked like a tail coming out of the circular dent left by the firing pin. “And there’s this other mark here, also to the left.” He touched the screen with his finger. “Ejector?” I said.
<name>Hardy</name>	Hardy	Marino	Filter looks all right. Fuel line is intact. That’s all I can tell you.” “The tank’s empty,” [MASK] observed. “I think he ran out of gas after death.” “Why?”
<name>Clayton</name>	Clayton	Lucy	But it sure as hell isn’t something you’d want to read before going to bed.” He glanced at [MASK] again. “Where is it?” I wanted to know. He peeled foil off the top of the bottle and unwound wire.
<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Lucy	We had no reason to know what he did at home, until [MASK] rebooted his computer, did her magic and somehow got into programming files. She disabled the screen saver, then started sorting through WordPerfect directories, all of which were empty.
<name>Stavros</name>	Stavros	Eddings	“Then it’s gone.” “I’m afraid it left port about the same time the nuclear power plant was stormed.” I looked at the three men. “Well, I certainly think we know why [MASK] had gotten increasingly paranoid about self-protection.”
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Marino	You understand me? People just kill like it’s nothing.” Several diners nearby overheard our conversation, but they continued their own without stares or asides. [MASK] was in uniform. He clearly was the brass, and that tended to inspire people to mind their own affairs.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Kay	“Let me answer your question this way. If we’re not alone, [MASK], I’m not going to tell you.” We looked at each other a moment longer, and we had never traveled abroad together, and now did not seem like a good time to start.
<name>him</name>	him	Marino	Oh sweet Jesus, I can’t believe it. It’s been all over the news, people in here talking about it all night ’cause it’s just down the street.” “Yes,” I said. She looked at [MASK] as if pleading with him.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Marino	[MASK] was thoughtfully rubbing his face. “So you’re convinced there’s a connection.” “I think nobody wanted us to know there was. I think whoever is behind this assumed he would look like a carjacking gone bad or some other street crime.”
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Lucy	You going to let me or do I have to go outside?” “Outside,” [MASK] said, jabbing her thumb toward the door and looking meaner than I knew she felt. “And what if I fall into a snowdrift, you little runt?”
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Marino	Everyone just stared at me. Then [MASK] said, “What?” I was getting frantic. “He could die any minute,” I said. “I’ve got to get in there now and buy you enough time to get in, too.”
<name>1</name>	1	Marino	“He didn’t do a very good job unless you didn’t want kids.” “Not with him I didn’t.” “What about now?” “I still don’t want them with him. Here.” 1 handed [MASK] a plate.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Marino	His mortgage payment was a thousand dollars a month, his monthly charge card bills sometimes as much, yet his annual salary was barely forty-five thousand dollars. “Shit. With all this extra cash coming in, he was sucking in almost eighty grand a year,” [MASK] said.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Fielding	It couldn’t have been more than a day before he died,” [MASK] said as he moved the hose. “What did he want?” I asked. “I was down here doing a case, so I never talked to him.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Lucy	“Yeah, go figure. I don’t know where she did her research, but it wasn’t where I grew up.” “I wish you two weren’t at odds.” I made the same comment I had made throughout [MASK]’s life.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Danny	“In the meantime, we’ll thoroughly check out all of his equipment to make sure everything was functioning and that he didn’t, for example, get exhaust fumes down his hose.” “You know much about hookahs?” [MASK] asked me, and he had returned to the table to help.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Fielding	I 1 HAT NIGHT I went home because I needed clothes, and my passport was in the safe. I packed with nervous hands as I waited for my pager to beep. [MASK] had been calling me on the hour to hear updates and air his concerns.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Wesley	By the time she was finished, she had recovered twenty-six files as we watched in amazement. “That’s what’s cool about DOS 6,” she simply said as she began printing. “Can you tell when they were deleted?” [MASK] asked.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Lucy	And right now it doesn’t seem all too safe in this one.” “I’d say that’s a fair assessment,” [MASK] said. I moved close to the window over the sink and could plainly see our vehicles with tires that looked like black rubber puddles in the snow.
<name>Anderson</name>	Anderson	Wesley	The terrorists still have refused contact and we don’t know how many casualties might be inside.” “I hear more helicopters,” I said. We were silent, and then the sound of thudding blades was unmistakable. [MASK] got back on the air.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ted	“No, thank you.” “I discovered it through [MASK],” she oddly went on as tears suddenly spilled down. “He found it when he was skiing out west and brought a bottle home. It tastes like liquid fire with a little cinnamon.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Sanders	asked [MASK], who was no fool. “Certainly, some people know. I’ve been taking his calls.” “So you don’t see that this might be related to who you are and what you do, ma’am.” He was taking notes.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Wesley	I asked, and I wondered how much [MASK] had known and for how long. “Have they said what they want?” He met my eyes. “That’s what worries us the most. We don’t know what they want.”
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Wesley	“You smelled cyanide,” [MASK] said, pointedly. “No one else did, and we don’t have tox results yet.” “What are you implying, that he drowned himself?” I stared at him. “I don’t know.”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Marino	“Now I want you to give me your driver’s license. Slow.” I was on the other side of the car, near the passenger’s door, and I knew who the offender was before [MASK] saw the license, and the photograph on it.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Ted	There are tests to be done.” “What else could it be?” She began dabbing tears with a tissue. “The policeman who came to see me said it happened underwater. [MASK] was diving in the river with that contraption of his.”
<name>John</name>	John	Bear	No one responded. “If you don’t give me these things I’ve requested, I can do nothing more for him,” I flatly stated. [MASK] went over to a desk and got on the hostage phone. He said we needed ice and more drugs.
<name>He</name>	He	Eddings	My spirit shook inside like a small hot flame. [MASK] had worn khaki range pants and a black commando sweater that day, and I tried to remember the look in his eyes. I wondered if there had been anything behind them that might have presaged this.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Benton	“This is not the time or place for anything to be taken personally.” “Well, let me tell you something, [MASK], people aren’t machines. They do take things personally.” “And that’s really what this is all about.”
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Marino	[MASK] went on, and he knew I always kept one here. “Is this really necessary?” I complained. “I’d tell you if it wasn’t.” “Give me just fifteen minutes to finish up this meeting.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Marino	“Of course we do.” I set down my coffee because my nerves were bad enough. “I’m going out to check on things.” “Hold on,” [MASK] said as he started his second doughnut. “I’ll be fine.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	McComb	Silence was thick like the fog outdoors, and then we were released on the first floor. I took my time getting off, and I watched the two agents lead [MASK] away without laying a finger on her. They did not have to, because they could, were it needed, just like that.
<name>Artie</name>	Artie	Lucy	“I just hope he didn’t blow away his entire subdirectory,” said [MASK], who was in the operating system now. “I can’t re- store that without a backup, and he doesn’t seem to have a backup.”
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Wesley	They served themselves pastries and fruit, and some were already mixing Bloody Marys and mimosas. [MASK] and I talked little and constantly scanned the crowd as we held up newspapers like every other proverbial spy or fugitive on the run.
<name>he</name>	he	Christmas	He spoke again. “Any possibility your British colleague simply skipped town? Do you know for a fact that his mother died?” I thought of my Tidewater morgue supervisor, who had quit before [MASK] without giving notice or a reason.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Rose	For a moment, I walked around, confused and upset, until I finally put it back where it had been, because I could not throw it out or subject some other member of my staff to its memories. Looking through [MASK]’s adjoining doorway, I was not surprised that she wasn’t here.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Lucy	“They transferred her out to the Washington Field Office to do white-collar crime. So at least she’s not far away.” “This must have been recent.” I was puzzled. “Real recent.” [MASK] rested her forearms on her knees.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Lucy	He looked around, and the sight of him hitching up his pants and inspecting his car because he could not help himself was too much. [MASK] and I both laughed, and then he tried not to smile. In truth, he secretly enjoyed it when we teased.
