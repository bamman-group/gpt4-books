<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Eli	He was over it and down in an instant. She pulled herself up after him, no longer marveling at the return of her strength, no longer marveling at anything. She had to get out of the house, get back to [MASK] and safety.
<name>Chigurh</name>	Chigurh	Eli	He could be turned again, made to recross the highway. All his effort so far could be for nothing. How had [MASK]'s people gotten ahead of him? He switched out the lights and turned off the road onto a dry wash.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Eli	He put his arm around her as soon as he could free his hands from hers—as soon as the organisms had finished their communication. How the hell could microorganisms communicate anyway, she wondered obscurely. [MASK] answered as though she had asked the question aloud.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Meda	"You know why," she said quietly. He could not keep his hands off her so he settled for holding one of her hands. "You have a son," she said. "Who's his mother?" "[MASK]."
<name>John</name>	John	Blake	It had once run on one-hundred-percent gasoline, though now it used ethanol. It was bigger and heavier than the few other cars on the road, and [MASK] was a good driver. But enough was enough—especially with the girls in the car.
<name>Valentine</name>	Valentine	Lupe	No, human beings did not move that way. How had any disease made such a creature of a child? "He's telling the truth, you know," [MASK] said. “You do look fat and odd to him, though you're not.
<name>She</name>	She	Keira	She went back into the closet, waited to see whether the girl would put the cuffs back on her. But the girl only looked at her, then closed the door. [MASK] waited for the soft click of the lock, but did not hear it.
<name>Valentine</name>	Valentine	Eli	If he spread the disease, it would quickly be traced to him. He would definitely be caged or killed then. [MASK] loved the boy desperately, longed to give him the gift of humanity that children everywhere else on earth took for granted.
<name>Farrell</name>	Farrell	Blake	Present 22 [MASK] regained consciousness in darkness. He lay still, realizing that he was no longer in his car. He was lying on something flat and hard—a carpeted floor, he thought after a moment. His head ached—seemed to pulsate with pain.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Rane	"1 lied," she told [MASK]. "We are going to hurt you. You're going to fight us every chance you get, aren't you? You're going to make us hurt you." The corners of her mouth turned downward. "
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Blake	"Yes." "You're going to trust me enough to let me go into town?" "Yes, but nobody travels alone. There's too much temptation to do harm. [MASK], you aren't ever going to be comfortable among ordinary people again."
<name>Chickens</name>	Chickens	Chickens	"A little nineteenth-century ranch in mountains you can't even see from here. [MASK], hogs, rabbits... The place will work your ass off. So will she, I expect." The man did not smile. "How many others?"
<name>David</name>	David	Jacob	Only her speeded-up reaction time saved her. Her moment of confusion and terror passed so quickly, she was able to keep herself from screaming. Instead, she shut the closet door quickly, quietly, and turned to face [MASK]. He was naked and trembling.
<name>She</name>	She	Rane	She could imagine them all grabbing her. At one point, an animal whizzed past—something lean and brown and catlike, running at a startling speed. It was much bigger than a housecat. [MASK] stared after it, wondering what it had been.
<name>She</name>	She	Meda	"It's her time." [MASK] rubbed her stomach and looked at him. "I don't want you to," she said. He could see that she meant the words, but he heard little passion behind them.
<name>he</name>	he	Keira	She had a beautiful face and a dark, shaggy head of hair. There was something wrong with the way she sat on the woman's arm, though—something [MASK] could not help noticing, yet could not quite identify.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Zeriam	[MASK] grabbed his arm. "Why should you send her in here?" he demanded. "Keep her! You had her before. For all I know, it's your kid she's carrying!" He was not saying what he believed.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Blake	[MASK] lay listening to them, thinking he should say something reassuring, but now that the danger was less immediate, he could not make the effort. His side and head were competing with each other to see which could hurt more.
<name>Linda</name>	Linda	Lupe	"Didn't you have a husband or anything back in the real world? What about your business?" "I was divorced," [MASK] said. "I lived in the truck on the road." She paused. Her voice became wistful.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Meda	Then he avoided temptation as best he could until [MASK] was comfortably pregnant—and her pregnancy did comfort her. She did not understand why. She had been isolated and sheltered by her parents, brought up to believe having a child outside marriage was a great sin.
<name>Lea</name>	Lea	Lorene	The organism is a damned efficient invader. Five people died because I couldn't fight it. Now, it's possible that at least one person will die because you can't fight it." "No," [MASK] whispered, shaking her head.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Eli	"If they were more experienced and better equipped, they would have killed us." [MASK] shook his head. "I doubt it. We don't die that easily. And did you nodce not one of them got off a shot at us after they blew our tire?"
<name>Henrietta</name>	Henrietta	Meda	"1 think I saw lights from State Highway Sixty-two, too. If we accidentally catch anyone important, I don't want search parties coming right to us." [MASK] gave a short, bitter laugh.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Kerry	She wanted to put his head on her lap, but she was afraid she would hurt him more. "[MASK], is that you?" He seemed to be looking right at her. "It's me." "I did it.
<name>Levinson</name>	Levinson	Eli	And infected people who get a lot of attention from us usually survive. The organism doesn't use cells up the way a virus does. It combines with them, lives with them, divides with them, changes them just a little. [MASK] says it's a symbiont, not a parasite."
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Blake	At that moment, someone opened the door of the house from which the noise had come. It was a man, a stranger, who actually managed to catch the car as [MASK] swung it around toward the rocky trail that led down from the ranch.
<name>He</name>	He	Eli	"Don't give me that look. Go do what you're supposed to do. Then you can take care of her! And if she doesn't make it, you can—" [MASK] was on his feet, inches from her, looming over her.
<name>Ennis</name>	Ennis	Eli	When the car people aren't making too much noise, I can hear them talking. I heard [MASK]." "Saying what?" "That if everything goes okay, the car people will go over to him when their symptoms begin.
<name>She</name>	She	Meda	If he did not, [MASK] would look at him and realize he was up to something. She might even figure out what it was. He did not underestimate her any longer. He thought he heard her come in before he dozed off, thought she called his name.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Keira	She did not think he had seen it. But he went straight to the compartment, located the hidden keyhole, stared at it for a moment, then selected the right key on the first try. "You never turn on any lights," [MASK] said.
<name>She</name>	She	Rane	I had to see you to be sure you were okay. But... I'm afraid of you—and of myself. It's so crazy. [MASK] hit me mostly to get my attention so I'd stop fighting her when she tried to pull me away.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Rane	“You do look fat and odd to him, though you're not. And you smell... different. Also, he couldn't miss how much you were repelled by him." "I don't understand how such a thing could happen," [MASK] whispered.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Meda	He worried about [MASK]. Worried that he might not be able to take care of her—that she might die in spite of her apparent adjustment. That would make him a complete failure. That would drive him away even if her sisters-in-law lived.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Rane	He started. "[MASK]?" he said. "Is that you?" "It's me." She sounded half awake. "Are you okay? "Fine," he lied. "Where the hell are we?" "A ranch house.
<name>Abigail</name>	Abigail	Meda	There was the white-haired patriarch of the household—a stem man who believed in an outdated, angry God and who knew how to use a shotgun. He reminded himself of this last when he met the daughter. [MASK], her name was.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Eli	Now what I told your kid, what she was too embarrassed to repeat, was that 1 meant to ask [MASK] for you. I like your looks. It doesn't matter whether you like mine. Everybody here looks like me, sooner or later."
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Meda	What was happening to them? [MASK] took a chair from the desk on the other side of the room and brought it over so that she could sit next to him. He watched her swing her thin body around. She moved like a man.
<name>Alvin</name>	Alvin	Rane	The organism seemed to be making her strong and him weak. That was all that had permitted her to get away from him when [MASK] made her realize what was happening. It occurred to her that as things stood now, each time she saw him might be the last.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Meda	"No, not deliberately." "But if you knew..." "[MASK]..." He wanted to touch her, take her by the shoulders and reassure her. But if he began to touch her, he would not be able to stop. "
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Eli	Her joints hurt her when she moved. She had decided she was to be left alone for the night when [MASK] came in. She could see him vaguely outlined in the moonlight. Apparently, he could see her much better. "Fool," he said.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Eli	[MASK] stood up, took her hands, and drew her to her feet. Her hands tingled, almost burned where he touched her. Confused, she tried to pull away, but somehow her desire to pull away did not reach her hands. They did not move.
<name>Offred</name>	Offred	Rane	We never had anybody who was already sick." "Yeah. I got us a healthy one, though." They talked about her as though she were not there, [MASK] thought. Or as though she were no more than an animal who could not understand.
<name>Leibowitz</name>	Leibowitz	Eli	[MASK] says we're preserving humanity. I agree with him. We are. Our own humanity and everyone else's because we let people alone. We isolate ourselves as much as we can, and the people outside stay alive and healthy—most of them."
<name>Lucifer</name>	Lucifer	Eli	"That's a start. There's a lot to be afraid of." He stifled an impulse to deny his fear or explain it. "You were going to tell me about [MASK]," he said. She nodded. "
<name>She</name>	She	Keira	He certainly would not let the friends they had called reach them. [MASK] did not know what would happen to her, but somehow she was not afraid. She sat on the closet floor with bound hands and feet, reading from cardboard boxes of old magazines.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Eli	She bent forward, crying, all but screaming in anguished protest. With her eyes closed, she could not imagine her father dead. She did not know how to deal with such an unimaginable thing. [MASK] took off his shirt and covered the most damaged parts of her father's body.
<name>John</name>	John	Blake	"Don't hit him," she said. "Don't hurt him!" The car accelerated, leaving the running thing behind. "What the hell was that?" [MASK] asked. "Be careful," she said.
<name>Chumlig</name>	Chumlig	Blake	He obviously feels terrible. Sooner or later, he's going to just grab me." [MASK] opened his bag again, turned it on, and keyed in a prescription form, "are you locked up?" he typed, "are your windows BARRED?"
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Blake	As a final gesture, he managed to release his hold with one hand, raise his fist, and smash it into the window beside [MASK]'s head. Like the lock, the glass held. It broke, cracks raying outward in all directions from the impact of the blow, but it did not shatter.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Meda	The pants were too short. "You look like you haven't eaten for weeks," [MASK] said. "I am hungry," he admitted. "My mother says you just ate enough for two people." He shrugged. He was still hungry.
<name>Ennis</name>	Ennis	Eli	Where did he catch the disease?" She hesitated. "Look, I'll tell you if you want me to. It's my job to explain things to you. But there are some things you'll have to understand before I tell you about [MASK].
<name>Leia</name>	Leia	Eli	She was halfway around and already aware of the distinctive scent of [MASK]'s people when she recognized another familiar scent. The new scent confused her for a moment because of its clarity. She was so utterly certain it was her father's that for a moment she thought she had actually seen him.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Kerry	She's seen them die. She didn't say anything about people with serious illnesses, but [MASK], she didn't have to." He gave her a long look, trying to read her, reach her. She knew he was right.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Andy	She—" "I didn't say she smells bad. Just different. It's a difference you'll learn to recognize." "Hell, I ought to tell you how you smell." "I know how I smell, [MASK]—especially to you.
<name>Tracy</name>	Tracy	Rane	"If you really believe he's the cause of this sickness—and you know he's the guy who kidnapped you..." [MASK] shook her head. "Didn't you have a husband or anything back in the real world? What about your business?"
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Blake	But now... You'll understand eventually. And when you do, I hope you'll accept our way of living. It's so damn hard when people don't. Like having one of my kids go wrong." [MASK] tried to make sense of this.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Rane	But if she escaped, the gang might take their anger and frustration out on her father and [MASK]. She hooked her arms around her knees, pulled her knees up close to her chest. There she sat miserably as though she were still bound, still locked in.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Rane	" There was an odd pause. For the second time in twenty-four hours, [MASK] seemed unwilling to say what was on her mind. "Have you seen him?" she asked. "No. But I don't imagine he would be normal.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Meda	No sense closing this one down." To their surprise, the stationmaster ended their argument for them by poking his head out the station door, then stepping out and making a perfect target of himself. "I don't believe this," [MASK] said.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Blake	It was only one small pane. It might be breakable. It did not break. But the frame gave a little. [MASK] took off his shirt, wrapped his right hand in it, and as quietly as he could, began trying to pound the entire window out.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Eli	She could break it, of course, but that would bring any number of people running. On the bed, [MASK] made a whining sound, and she tore at the window. It opened inward rather than upward, but it had apparently been painted shut.
<name>Arctor</name>	Arctor	Lorene	One of the car people had probably taken a liking to him. They might not have killed him at all if he had cooperated. His voice, his face, his posture said he had not. He was not a homosexual, then—fortunately for [MASK].
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Eli	We were worried about you. You took so long to regain consciousness. But now that you're awake, and it's night... what would you think about one of us hopping over to one of those windows and signaling [MASK]'s people?" Silence.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Eli	"The kids are more nocturnal than we are," [MASK] said. "We try to adjust them more to our hours for their own protection. They don't realize the danger they're in when they roam around at night." He held the door open for her
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Blake	Take away that illusion and what's left is something you wouldn't want to deal with. You'll see." "If your veneer of humanity is that thin," [MASK] said, "it's only a matter of time before someone finds it too thin.
<name>Tranter</name>	Tranter	Eli	He ignored her. If any of [MASK]'s people were outside, he wanted them to know where he was. It was possible, of course, that they would simply shoot him, but he did not believe they would—they could have done that long ago.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Keira	His daughter [MASK] warned him that desert winds could blow cars off the road and that wind-driven sand could blast paint off cars, but he reassured her. He had gotten into the habit of reassuring her without really listening to her fears; there were so many of them.
<name>He</name>	He	Blake	[MASK] was afraid of her. It was ridiculous, but he was afraid. "Get up," she said. "Come on. Believe it or not, I don't like to humiliate people." Sweat ran into her eyes, but she did not seem to notice.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Meda	He had to find something he could use against them. "I could have used you when my children were born," [MASK] told him as he took her blood pressure. "Didn't you have a doctor?" he asked. He checked her pulse.
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Meda	He may have muttered something before the drug took full effect. He awakened on time, clearheaded, aware of what he must do. The room was full of moonlight and [MASK] lay snoring softly beside him. It amused him that she snored.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Petra	He smiled. "I like that better. Thank you, [MASK]." To his surprise, she blushed. "Are my daughters all right?" he asked. She looked surprised. "They're okay. They say you screamed at them to get out.
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	Rane	She could not escape. The woman caught [MASK]'s other arm and held it in a grip just short of painful. The thinness was deceptive. These people were all abnormally strong. "Don't be afraid," the woman said with a slight accent.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Lupe	She shook her head. She knew the request might really be a command, but she decided to wait and see. [MASK] simply shrugged and turned back to the wall she was working on. The two men were on their way to work on the outside of the house.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Keira	Her father was gone. He had escaped! He had used his new strength and gotten away! And what about [MASK]? Perhaps she had gotten away, too. People tended not to pay much attention to her because she looked too frail to try anything.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Lupe	"Its heartbeat," [MASK] said. "He can hear it without putting his ear to me. It's just a game he likes. He says this one's going to be a girl. He doesn't understand how he can tell, but he knows.
<name>Trinity</name>	Trinity	Solemnly	[MASK], she handed him the keys. He stared at them. "I took them," she said. She shrugged. "Now you won't have to worry about touching me." "You exposed yourself just to get the keys?" he demanded.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Keira	It was a Jeep, after all, antique or no. The car struggled for traction in the loose dirt and rock, then shuddered heavily as something landed on its roof. The something made an indentation they could see inside the car. Suddenly [MASK] pushed her door open.
<name>Samuel</name>	Samuel	Blake	[MASK] managed to stifle more laughter. He rubbed a hand across his forehead, and was surprised to find it wet. He was standing in the hot desert sun, but between his daughters and his captors, he had hardly noticed. "What are you going to do with me?"
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Meda	Have you seen him?" she asked. "No. But I don't imagine he would be normal. Not after what the bag told me about [MASK]." "... he isn't." "What's he like?"
<name>Rick</name>	Rick	Blake	"He told me about the disease and... where he got it. I didn't know what to think. Do you believe him?" "'Her' in my case." [MASK] stared through the bars of the window into the desert night.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Stephen	He was distracting. He moved from one subject to another, drawing her with him, keeping her emotionally involved in whatever he chose. "I don't care about food growing," she said. "Listen, [MASK], my father is a good doctor.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Eli	"Amateurs!" "More than that," [MASK] told her. "We scared the hell out of them. We moved so fast we seemed to be anticipating them. If they're amateurs, they must have thought we were pros." He sighed.
<name>Nashira</name>	Nashira	Eli	The moon was waning, but still bright in the clear desert air. It was possible that someone outside might be able to see him in the moon and starlight, but he hoped [MASK]'s people had told the truth when they claimed to be able to see in the dark.
<name>Proxima</name>	Proxima	Keira	She knew that Proxima could not be seen separately by the unaided eye. A red star whose light a little girl bom on Earth longed for. "Hi," a child's voice said from somewhere nearby. [MASK] jumped, then looked around.
<name>Elias</name>	Elias	Eli	He looked at her sidelong. "Girl, even my enemies have more sense than to call me that." "Elias then," she said, smiling. "[MASK]." "Okay." "You tell anybody?" "No."
<name>Jackson</name>	Jackson	Blake	You don't know family like we do. But the hell with that. What I want to know is who else wants you?" [MASK] sat up straighter, staring at the man. "What do you mean?"
<name>Ann</name>	Ann	Meda	"[MASK], listen—" "So if you're afraid of an epidemic, Doctor, don't even think about leaving us. Even if you spread the word, you can't possibly stop us." She switched tracks abruptly. "I'm starving.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Lorene	[MASK], clearly unarmed, had offered to shake the man's hand. With a look of uncertainty and dawning relief, the man had given his hand, then jumped as she scratched him. He jerked his hand away, but let her catch it again as she apologized.
<name>Art</name>	Art	Stephen	"All right, we knew it would happen sooner or later." "But a private hauler," [MASK] said. "They go all over the country, all over the continent. And they deal with people who go all over the world."
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Meda	And here." She handed him a linen napkin—real linen. "Wipe your hands and face. Why are you perspiring so? It's cool in here." Present 6 In surprisingly little time, [MASK] served a huge meal.
<name>Chucky</name>	Chucky	Eli	There was the clock—a nondigital antique with a luminous dial. It ticked loudly and needed neither batteries nor electricity. If she hit [MASK] with it, he could probably be hurt, but would he be knocked unconscious or would he wake up and knock her unconscious?
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Rane	A week, perhaps. The boy had ceased to come near him or touch him exactly when he began wondering if it were not a cruelty to leave such a hopeless child alive. Present 26 [MASK] sat frightened and alone among members of the car family.
<name>Alia</name>	Alia	Eli	Her father realized what they were doing before he died. He first cursed her, called her a harlot. Then he apologized and wept. He seized [MASK]'s wrist with only a ghost of the great strength he should have possessed. "Take care of her!"
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Rane	Are you the oldest or the youngest?" "[MASK] and 1 are twins." A startled glance. "Well, I guess you're not lying about it, but the two of you barely look like members of the same family—let alone twins."
<name>Jerome</name>	Jerome	Meda	But—" "It scares us!" "I know." He paused. "What in this world is going to happen to kids with human minds and four legs? Think about it!" "Who says they have human minds?" [MASK] asked.
<name>Jill</name>	Jill	Keira	Tiny microbes controlled him, had forced him to have sex with a young girl when an instant before, sex had been the farthest thing from his mind. What had they made him do to his daughter? [MASK] came into the room much as she had come into another room—how many days ago?
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Eli	You just catch him." [MASK] turned to look at her. "You know," she said, still laughing, "this is the kind of thing you always read about men doing to women—kidnapping them, then the women getting to like the idea.
<name>Casey</name>	Casey	Lupe	A woman who could be nostalgic for work that kept nearly killing her could probably make any irrational adjustment. "I didn't have anybody," [MASK] said. "We lived in a cesspool. My parents' house got caught in a gang war, got bombed.
<name>Alvin</name>	Alvin	Blake	Let's go in and see if she's set a place for you." They herded [MASK] and the girls into the house, somehow communicating amusement, weariness, hunger, but no threat. It was almost as though the Maslin family had been invited to eat with new friends.
<name>Althea</name>	Althea	Rane	Someone made a grab for the barrel. That was a degree of stupidity [MASK] had not expected. She fired, managed to shoot only the man whose hand had brought the gun to bear on his own belly. She resisted the urge to spray the whole group.
