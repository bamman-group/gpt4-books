<name>Abner</name>	Abner	Jan	[MASK]! For-give! For-give!” The words came so strongly that he arose and shouted “No! No!” He picked up his shotgun, as if by the feel of it he could hold on to his resolution.
<name>Mac</name>	Mac	Marcus	“I don’t know about any bishops,” said the press agent, “but surely this is giving ‘The Garden of the Soul’ a boost no film I know of has ever had. Miracles don’t happen in churches everyday. What’s eating you, [MASK]?
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	WILLIAM	Pay for a messenger to get it there if there’s no office directly in that town. Say: 'DEAR [MASK], IF YOU NEED MORE MONEY, THAT NANTICOKE BANK WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU. HOPE IT IS A SOUND BANK.
<name>Wilmot</name>	Wilmot	Bill	“I’ve persuaded six friends of mine to serve. And what I want to speak to you about is the black gloves--” “I paid for the gloves—a dollar a pair—six dollars in all,” interrupted [MASK] sternly.
<name>Clayton</name>	Clayton	Dunnigan	What a strange bronze group his five would make (thought [MASK]’s theater mind)—the Catholic priest in his cassock, the armored archangel, the barefooted girl as she had looked on the church steps, himself, and the little Jewish picture producer . . .
<name>Pat</name>	Pat	Dunnigan	[MASK] went to her. “My office assistant is waiting in my car. He’ll take you home. Get some more sleep. They want to see how you look on film. The ‘takes’ are already on the way to the laboratories.
<name>Lucia</name>	Lucia	Bill	"But they are saying the dead girl—your friend—must be a holy child—even a Saint!” “Who knows?” said [MASK]. “Perhaps she was! Are you to judge of that—or I?
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bill	It will be very lonely when you go.” “Father,” said [MASK], “you and I are going to stick together. You’re not alone any more. I’m not alone either, as I’ve been most of my life.
<name>Trimalchio</name>	Trimalchio	Dunnigan	Money! Showers of money for her very' own! And this gentleman ([MASK] had now become that) who could hire church bells rung for a week, in whose wake miracles occurred, gave the impression he was not now speaking idle words.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Dunnigan	My name is [MASK], and that doesn’t matter either. You are a woman and I am a man— a man desperately in need of a cultured woman’s advice and succor! There are two of us helpless males here in fact—both equally dumb!
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Dunnigan	He had always walked directly in. He waited ten minutes—fifteen minutes—past the time of his appointment. He smoked half of one cigar, then lit another. Several other studio executives had gone in and out of the sanctum, and [MASK] thought they regarded him curiously.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Dunnigan	[MASK] gazed about at the plateau. It was indeed a wonder spot. Quiet, peaceful, breathtaking, majestic. The distant wooded hills ringed it like battlements, as if they would protect it from all the tragedy and sordidness of the world.
<name>Chaplin</name>	Chaplin	Dunnigan	The genius-producer of his yearly revue suddenly died. That ended the series. It was a personal blow. [MASK] was devoted to this man, admired him greatly. They had been closely associated for ten years. He felt pretty bad.
<name>Napoleon</name>	Napoleon	Napoleon	Didn’t every soldier in the armies of [MASK] feel that there was a Marshal’s baton in his knapsack? Wasn’t that one of the things that made the little emperor great? He didn’t have to let others find him leaders. He found them himself.
<name>Tristram</name>	Tristram	Bill	(so his name had been written in a horribly perfect script on the jinx book) laughed one of those laughs that starts with a small “Ha-ha!” chuckle and proceeds to a crescendo of these monosyllables. “Excuse me,” said [MASK] between chuckles.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Dunnigan	And part of the way, until they reached the bridge and the town, some- one was on the other side of [MASK], walking with him, holding tightly to his hand. And in her uplifted face was reflected the faith and hope of all the world.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Bill	It’s been a day for him! You must go to your friends. They will wonder. I’ll see you. [MASK]—soon—soonl” She was gone. He looked across the Valley. The bells had stopped. It all seemed strangely silent.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Bill	“It isn’t a very good job—[MASK].” She spoke his name awkwardly, as though she were being presumptuous to address him with such familiarity. “It isn’t what I dreamed of you finding me doing.
<name>sinister</name>	sinister	Frankenstein	That hour which marked the dreadful change in this brother. But now that she met this monster face to face, try as she could, she could find no [MASK] leer in the clear grey eyes, in the likable smile of the tall figure that stepped graciously forward.
<name>Gray</name>	Gray	Gray	With the bells it reminded her of—oh yes—[MASK]’s “Elegy”— though, of course, that was English. The curfew tolls the knell of parting day. There was no church in sight, but from somewhere these bells were ringing a curfew.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Koepke	When his muddled brain had somewhat cleared, he had asked them what had happened—just as he had demanded this when he had first struggled to his feet in [MASK]’s. He spoke like an angry child. They now told him briefly—bluntly and cruelly.
<name>John</name>	John	Dunnigan	she responded with no thought of a pun, but with the grim certainty of expert personal observation. “They don’t keep their utensils half clean! They never wash their coffee pots! They never scour their skillets!” [MASK] jumped up from his chair.
<name>Wells</name>	Wells	Dunnigan	[MASK] experienced that most absurdly elusive of mental grasp-ings—trying to place a familiar personage seen apart from his customary background—the bartender away from his bar—the cigar-counter clerk away from his shop—the bellboy out of his uniform.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Dunnigan	The shuffleboard addicts tore their eyes from the polished surface of their chute. All conversation in the room came to a dead and ominous silence. Even the juke box seemed to sense tragedy and ended as abruptly as it had started. Those nearest [MASK] moved back hurriedly.
<name>Poirot</name>	Poirot	Dunnigan	Both were to be ready by six o’clock that evening, were paid for, and could be collected by the Packard driver at this hour. While waiting, [MASK]’s mind again returned to an unsolved problem. He did not like unsolved problems when they concerned the business in which he was supposed to excel.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Marcus	Poor child! But you’re going to make it up to her, I know, with what this great picture will do for her memory! I’m glad it’s you, [MASK], made that film, and I hope she is glad!”
<name>Griffith</name>	Griffith	Dunnigan	“It will be one of the greatest pictures ever shown!” said [MASK]. “You’re beautiful, kid, and you can act!” “Funny, it seems more important to me now that you think I’m beautiful!” How vibrant was her low voice!
<name>John</name>	John	Dunnigan	He took from his pocket the hospital envelope and read its brief contents aloud. The woman wiped her eyes when [MASK] finished. “She was a good girl,” she said, “and always considerate. I never worked for anyone so thoughtful and considerate.”
<name>Hardy</name>	Hardy	Dunnigan	"I don’t like it at all! See if you can reach [MASK] by telephone.” “He’s been trying to reach you,” gasped the mystified secretary. “Has phoned twice and will call again at noon.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Sydra	[MASK] never climbed the hill Where the grave lay, brown and still. Brought no wreaths, no flower-filled pots To outdo the neighbors’ plots. Then one dawn they found her there (Never was her smile so fair) Dew had gathered on her hair.
<name>James</name>	James	Bill	They moved down the side aisle and out of the church by the main doorway. “I am saying the Rosary and other prayers for the dead tonight at seven,” said the priest. “Will you be here—[MASK]?” he added.
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	Dunnigan	“Poor little kid!” said [MASK]. He put the poetry with the other papers. Just before they left he stood in front of the picture called “The Presence.” It was not a large picture—only about two feet square in its frame.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Bill	And she said to be sure to tell you she would care. Would care when you went, she meant.” “When did she say that, mister?” “The last time I talked with her. It was not long ago,” said [MASK].
<name>Archer</name>	Archer	Dunnigan	• The bank president little knew how entirely “out” was his new and apparently wealthy client! The remaining fifteen thousand dollars [MASK] left on deposit, and received therefor a bankbook and a pocket checkbook. “Now please direct me to the nearest garage.
<name>nowhere</name>	nowhere	Heaven	She could not discern clearly the exact appearance of this sudden interceder from [MASK]. Except that he was tall, and wore a light-colored suit, and a dark derby cut at an angle across his forehead. “Oh thank you, sir,” she stammered.
<name>Stanton</name>	Stanton	Harris	The leading man had confirmed it. His cameraman’s unusual admiration. The enthusiasm of all the studio officials when they had viewed the “rushes,” confirmed it. [MASK] knew the difference between mere "yessing” of the opinion of “the Boss” and spontaneous approbation.
<name>Mac</name>	Mac	Marcus	“Kid,” he said, “you mustn’t mind that [MASK] and I may have to put on a little heat. It’s only because they don’t yet know— these so-called picture stars I mean.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Dunnigan	“How old was the girl who died?” “She was twenty-two,” said [MASK]. And with his answer a fierce bitterness again swept over him. They had reached the end of the main street, past the rows of company houses, saloons, dusty stores.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Orloff	It took many kinds of mentality to make up a world! [MASK] held out the pen. “I’ve got a lucky pencil. Think I'll sign with that if you don’t object,” said the press agent.
<name>Mac</name>	Mac	Koepke	Two washrooms radiating their odors led off from here. [MASK]’s had all the conveniences for a complete social life. Women could enter, but were seldom there except on “pay night,” when the place became a gala scene of mixed-company festivity and bickering.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Dunnigan	“I wouldn’t want to make you lose your job! I’m afraid it wouldn’t help if I said, ‘Give the kid a break.’ ” “Well?” said [MASK] into the telephone. Couldn’t he be let alone on this of all evenings!
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Gronka	“You’re foreign looking. You’re [MASK]’s height and size. The costumes all fit you. You’ve had most of them on already. And if you’re not better looking and cleverer than that conceited, rattlebrained dame.
<name>Slade</name>	Slade	Jan.	And I’ll pay for both drinks.” “I pay for my own liquor, and if you don’t like my manners, you know what you can do about it!” replied the man called [MASK] The look in his eyes changed from insolence to truculence.
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Bill	“Kid, this is [MASK],” he said to the sleepy answering voice. “Glad you’ve had some rest, but now comes the dawn and get yourself wide awake. This is important.” “I’m wide awake.
<name>Estelle</name>	Estelle	Dunnigan	And [MASK]’s eyes watched his Spirit of Spring proceed to a new debacle. She was trying to watch the dance director, her own feet, the girl next her, all at the same time, in her desperation to understand and copy a “pivot.”
<name>Julie</name>	Julie	Bill	I’m telling you so you’ll know I really sent it. Don’t be unhappy. [MASK]. There isn’t any death, when there is someone who loves you—someone you love—” There was again only the sound of the distant bells.
<name>Marvel</name>	Marvel	Dunnigan	“Yes,” said [MASK]. He alone knew just what a “marvel” she was. During the rest period the press agent went to her dressing room. “Kid, you were wonderful,” he said. “Are you sure you feel all right today?”
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Dunnigan	I’d see you!” gasped his visitor and looked as though he wanted to turn and run. » [MASK] removed his slippered feet from the window sill and leaned forward so that he could better view his unannounced caller. “You don’t remember me?”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Dunnigan	“Are you telling me there really was a miracle in this Catholic church!” he broke in. “That it wasn’t a job you thought up, and hired to be done?” [MASK] took a deep breath of the carbon dioxide of his phone booth.
<name>Ardis</name>	Ardis	Bill	The managers of the large Intercity houses in the two cities, on a promise of first showings of “The Garden of the Soul,” would have agreed to almost any proposition. Sponsor a series of broadcasts? Gladly! One manager made [MASK] an offer for a “personal appearance”!
<name>Challoner</name>	Challoner	Dunnigan	He was, as indicated, a large, very solidly-built man, quite as tall as [MASK] and much heavier. He wore a well-made black suit o£ good material and the Roman collar of his office. On his large, square-turned head was a black straw hat.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Rubel	Why was he sitting there? He must go out and “get” this man—this cool city mug who, without even taking off his coat and by some shift of boxing, had knocked him down and out before he, [MASK], could get started!
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Boloney	Another millionaire shooting off his mouth. His comment as he left the place had been brief but conclusive. One word—[MASK]! But the man was violating no traffic or other regulation if he chose to preach a lot of bunk in the hotel where he was stopping.
<name>Compromise</name>	Compromise	Loneliness	An abyss that would someday suddenly yawn before him. For he also was a man, and had to live in a world of men. This abyss is called [MASK]. Sooner or later he who determines to walk alone comes to its terrifying edge.
<name>Time</name>	Time	Clocks	He was expert at weeding gardens, cleaning hen houses, splitting wood. [MASK] had no meaning for him, and he had the abnormal peculiarity of staying on a job till it was finished, instead of knocking off at a fixed hour.
<name>Yankel</name>	Yankel	Dunnigan	He knew now that without it no man really lived. For him there was one bridge to that living. This man named [MASK]. These wretched people on their knees about him—the weakest of them (and they were all weak) had something denied to him.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Dunnigan	[MASK] said: “I’ve not had breakfast. I’ll get something to eat and be back.” He felt he could not survive if he had to just stand there and wait. And his empty stomach might feel a little less jittery with some ballast of food.
<name>Theda</name>	Theda	Dunnigan	[MASK] flashed the famous smile—the smile the news editors could never resist—the same smile that had long ago won the co-operation of the dancing Castles and Miss Ruth St. Denis of “Salome” fame.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Dunnigan	But I don’t care. Do you like pictures?” “I hate ’em,” [MASK] said with characteristic honesty. “But don’t let that discourage you. There are a hundred million on your side. Only I don’t know much about that business.
<name>John</name>	John	Bill	[MASK] took out his checkbook and wrote a check for the latter amount He made it payable to the girl. “This is a wedding present to you,” he said. “You’re putting it into the business, not me.
<name>Drummond</name>	Drummond	Bill	Such is the understanding code of bars the world over, a code too little copied in nobler assemblages. [MASK] turned slowly to regard this unexpected and uninvited sharer of his bottle. The man was really huge, a head taller than the six-foot theater agent.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Bill	“Good-by, [MASK].” “Good-by, kid.” He went quickly. He must get a firm grip on himself. She was all too lovely—the touch of her hand was too electric. He was not, he must not fall, in love.
<name>He</name>	He	Dunnigan	He did not get into his car. “Have it taken to the garage,” he told the guard. “I don’t need it any more.” [MASK] walked to the street and hailed a taxi. He went first to his hotel.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Treskovna	Then [MASK] dies! What next? “If there is any money owed you, the treasurer will pay it. If your union requires that you have two weeks dismissal salary, take it. I’ll gladly pay you a full month’s salary.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Bill	Maybe the elderly gravedigger had the Answer, thought [MASK]. Heaven was right here—it there had been a place we loved, and hearts we loved. She was gone, just as, suddenly, the storm was gone. Bright sunlight burst through a cloud.
<name>Rocky</name>	Rocky	Dunnigan	Not all this! This frightens me!” “Hush! Hush!” said [MASK]. “Just let me handle it, kid. Didn’t you always believe in your star! And when you’re shooting at a star, you shoot high, kid!”
<name>Thus</name>	Thus	Unseen	“Here is where I stay through a service whether I want to or notl” he said, and crouched on a small stool at one side. It did not prove too difficult. [MASK], he was able to chew on a cigar.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Bill	“Don’t ever leave me for long! Come to me whenever you can!” “I told you I’d be with you always. It’s you and me. [MASK], for ever and ever!” She was gone as quickly as she came.
<name>James</name>	James	Dunnigan	There was a letter in an envelope beside them. He could not help but see that a doctor’s name was on the top corner of the envelope. [MASK] did not usually open and read other people’s letters, but he took this one from its envelope and spread it open.
<name>Griffith</name>	Griffith	Harris	So while not the largest producer, he soon became known as one of the finest and most careful. When a [MASK] film failed, it was not because it was not well done. The subject matter simply did not have a wide enough popular appeal.
<name>he</name>	he	Dunnigan	After awhile, when the old office was closed and its affairs wound up, when the famous New York theater was leased to pictures, he went to work for a rival management. And swiftly, in one season, five consecutive musical plays [MASK] press-agented failed miserably.
<name>Garbo</name>	Garbo	Treskovna	The director also was an “artist,” his mind on his film story, not the health of such impersonal things as actors. “Don’t worry about [MASK]. It’s hellish hot here. A hundred in the shade today. I’ve lost some weight myself!”
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Rachel	He had always felt sorry for that “billionaire.” “It’s beautiful,” he had said, “I’m proud of you, [MASK].” He loved his wife. He would not hurt her feelings for a world of offices.
<name>Macdonald</name>	Macdonald	Orloff	The keen eyes were a steel-grey. Presently the undertaker reappeared and the long box was pushed into the hearse compartment. “How far to this Coaltown?” asked the man with the cigar. “About ten miles. My name is [MASK].
<name>Raphael</name>	Raphael	Michael	Your Saint [MASK]. I didn’t like him at first because his name was so long—the Archangel part, I mean—but I sort of remember about him now. He was the real McCoy too! “People like you two ought to be known!
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Bill	[MASK] thought there was a catch in her voice. He took her hand and held it a moment. It was the first time he was close to her. He discovered that she was more lovely up close than at thirty or forty feet across the footlights.
<name>Mrs. Hudson</name>	Mrs. Hudson	Martha	The woman [MASK] found her an hour later when she came to clean and prepare dinner. She was a calm, level-headed woman, and she got the girl onto her daybed couch and forced some whiskey between her pale lips.
<name>Reb</name>	Reb	Marcus	He’s not of our faith, but he is a brave man that I have wronged and he deserves our prayers. Ask the Rabbi to help remove a sort of jinx that has hung over this man.” “I will do just as you say, [MASK],” said the voice.
<name>Red</name>	Red	Dunnigan	“You’re better than I am, kid!” said [MASK], and he laughed happily. “But what will you put in it, so that it measures up to all this!” The lad wrinkled a freckled brow under the flaming crown of red.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Dunnigan	“Kid,” said [MASK], “you mustn’t talk like this!” “I must,” she said. “Please listen to me. I want you to buy something for the church. I don’t know what. Something they need badly.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Dunnigan	[MASK] insisted on helping her with the dishes after they finished dinner. He had done this for his mother always. Only now it was not a patched-at-the-elbow sweater jacket that he took off when he rolled up his shirt sleeves, but a Fifth Avenue tailored coat.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Stan	“The second day they had managed to drill through and sink a long length of pipe so they could pour down liquid food. They had [MASK] pour down his music also. He played and sang for the men inside.
<name>Harding</name>	Harding	Tom	Do you think a personal appearance in that district would help us for the next year?” “Your personal appearances have always helped,” replied [MASK], “especially when you wear a soft shirt and that black Stetson hat, and remind ’em how you started life as a worker in the mines.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Dunnigan	“He gave me a dollar if I’d take the message to you right away,” said the boy. Such honest frankness was worthy of some reward. [MASK] flashed his ready smile. “All right, kid. I’ll make good for you!
<name>Slattery</name>	Slattery	Dunnigan	Eyes that had narrowed and for the moment lost their joviality. Did the “gent” suspect what the undertaker had already done? The gent did, if the truth were known. [MASK] had heard certain rumors in a bar about the ten-dollar-a-pallbearer transaction.
<name>George</name>	George	Dunnigan	“You won’t laugh at me, mister, if I tell you? I do feel like talking this morning, and you being a city gentleman—” “Go right ahead!” said [MASK]. “I want to own my own Quick Lunch!
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Dunnigan	“Father,” said [MASK], and the priest was still startled by the dynamic change in the man before him, “I completely forgot the most important item in this funeral!” “What do you mean?” asked the mystified priest. “Those bells!
<name>George</name>	George	Dunnigan	The operator counted the words. “A hundred and twenty-five words. Full rate?” “Full rate,” said [MASK]. The man figured again. “Three dollars and thirty-two cents, including tax.”
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Tom	He wanted that bill vetoed. “You see, Governor,” [MASK] explained, having carefully lit the cigar, “that county is a stronghold of the opposition party. Always has been. Mostly foreigners. Poles and such.
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Dunnigan	“I was looking over some accounts when you came,” he said, and then, as if he must explain, “It is a part of my duty.” “I’ll do my business strictly on a cash basis,” snapped [MASK].
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Dunnigan	“I found it and I ate, as you say, like a horse! I’m going to bed now for I am a little tired.” “Well, see you tomorrow, kid,” said [MASK].
<name>Sammy</name>	Sammy	Stan	But [MASK] was the besthearted fellow I ever dug a grave for. The kindest in this town. He just wanted to make people happy. Like the girl that’s coming here. He could play the accordion fine. The best at that in the whole Valley.
<name>Griffith</name>	Griffith	Dunnigan	“Go to it, kidl” she could almost hear him say with his steady eyes. “Camera! Action!” The girl plunged into the scene—a solo in which she was talking alone. [MASK] knew instantly she would make good.
<name>Blackie</name>	Blackie	Dunnigan	Lengthy news stories in every one of them. Front page in several. The Ambassador’s coming and the City Hall reception had turned the trick. The newspaper boys liked [MASK]. He had “color.” They had all heard rumbles about the “jinx.”
<name>dark-covered</name>	dark-covered	Stanislavsky	“She told me there was five hundred dollars in a glass jar behind a certain book. It is to pay for her funeral. We will now try to find this money.” He located the [MASK] book, a thick, dark-covered volume.
<name>Father</name>	Father	Dunnigan	State Troopers stopped all passing traffic during the service. [MASK] arranged for the newsmen who wished to be inside to go to the choir loft by way of the bell tower. Many reporters, however, preferred to view the unusual scene from the street.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Dunnigan	Even coal in winter. We had to buy that from the Company. And while I could go barefoot in summer, I had to buy shoes in the winter.” “I shouldn’t have thought your father would let you work in this Breaker!” exclaimed [MASK].
<name>Al</name>	Al	Bill	Bring her on to the Coast tomorrow if possible. The office will charter a plane. We’ve got to start shooting at once. Everything’s ready there, if I can land this leading man.” “O. K., boss,” said [MASK].
<name>He</name>	He	Dunnigan	They were mostly receipted bills for rent, groceries, milk, a hairdresser. The large x-ray films were still there, and a large envelope in which they came. [MASK] put the films and all the papers in this envelope.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Dunnigan	He was thinking that she probably never had a single flower sent her while she lived. Even he had never sent her a flower. Organ music was coming from the open doors, and [MASK] climbed to the choir loft. He had another talk with the blind organist.
