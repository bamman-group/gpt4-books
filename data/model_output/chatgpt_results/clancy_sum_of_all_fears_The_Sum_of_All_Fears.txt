<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Cabot	“Yeah, that’s the attitude he conveys.” “Well, we weren’t able to change everything from the previous administration. Of course, he is a pro at this. . . .” Her voice trailed off. “And I’m not?” [MASK] demanded.
<name>President</name>	President	Jack	He ordered his communications officer to place a call to the chairmen and ranking minority members of the Senate and House armed-services committees. When all four were on line, they’d stage a conference call with the Vice President, who was still aboard Kneecap. “[MASK]?”
<name>Abu Mohammad</name>	Abu Mohammad	Ghosn	So many guns, mostly Russian AK-47s at first, but soon he was seeing heavy antiaircraft guns and the odd battery of surface-to-air missiles, tanks, and self-propelled field guns belonging to the Syrian Army. [MASK] noted his guest’s interest and started explaining things.
<name>he</name>	he	Motti	he wondered quickly—was tracing over the rocks toward him. He checked his ESM gear; it had not sensed the attacking missiles. There was no warning beyond what his eyes told him. Instinctively [MASK] clawed for altitude in which to maneuver. Four missiles followed him up.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Zadin	The Arabs were there. It was a disappointment that there were so many, like fleas, like rats in a place they didn’t belong. Just so long as they kept out of the way. They wouldn’t, of course, and [MASK] knew it.
<name>the sniper</name>	the sniper	Paulson	The rifle surged back in recoil, and the sniper’s hand was already moving to work the bolt and load another round. The wind had chosen a bad moment to gust, throwing [MASK]’s aim off ever so slightly to the right.
<name>him</name>	him	Marvin	he asked the sun. The glowing ball of gas was red with yet more blowing dust from this hot, dry summer, and the image that came to [MASK] was of his brother’s face. The stop-motion freeze-frame of the TV news.
<name>John</name>	John	Bock	“Step down. We are going to inspect your vehicle.” The commander, gunner, and driver assembled in front of their vehicle while the other crews boarded theirs. [MASK] waited for the neighboring tanks to button up, then shot all three Russians with his silenced automatic.
<name>30 EAST ROOM</name>	30 EAST ROOM	Jack	“Go to bed. You need sleep more than anything else.” Being married to a physician had its drawbacks. Chief among those was that you couldn’t argue with one. [MASK] kissed her on the cheek and did as he was told. 30 EAST ROOM
<name>Ethan</name>	Ethan	Jack	“Okay, now that the technical side looks possible, I want an operational feasibility evaluation.” “You got it, [MASK]. Goddamn! It’s good to be a real spy again. With all due respect, watching out for your ass does not test my abilities all that much.”
<name>Spock</name>	Spock	Germans	They were arrogant, overbearing, and they hated [MASK], however much they protested otherwise. On the other hand, when browbeaten, they were predictable. Even though his rank insignia was no higher than this man’s, he had a louder voice, and that was all he needed.
<name>Red</name>	Red	Ramius	We must use every trick we have. Why are you not optimistic?” “Even [MASK] only tracked an Ohio once, and that was on builder’s trials, when they had the shaft problem. And even then, he only held the contact for—what?
<name>Chief Bromden</name>	Chief Bromden	Marvin	“Americans.” [MASK] snorted. “Hey, man. I’m a fuckin’ American, okay? My country ain’t what you think. They stole my country from me, just like what happened to these guys here, okay?
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Ryan	“Okay, thanks.” [MASK] hung up. “Shit!” On the other hand, he couldn’t be angry about that, could he? He got up and walked out to his secretary’s office.
<name>The protagonist</name>	The protagonist	Russell	He sat by the window, the lights behind him extinguished, watching the traffic, watching for approaching police, waiting for the phone to ring. How would he make them pay? [MASK] asked himself. He didn’t know, and really didn’t care.
<name>McCabe</name>	McCabe	Goodley	Like that. He moves like an athlete, fluid, economical, but it’s his eyes. They’re always moving around. He looks at you sideways and decides if you’re a threat or not a threat_” [MASK] paused.
<name>Willard</name>	Willard	Russell	That is why they hunt you—because they fear you!” “Hope you’re right, man.” [MASK] stared out the open window, and the dust stung his eyes, 7,000 miles from home. “So, what are we doing?”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Ryan	[MASK] asked over his secure phone. He had missed the morning paper at home only to find the offending article waiting on his desk as part of The Bird. “It sure as hell didn’t come from here.
<name>Langley</name>	Langley	Clark	[MASK] took his seat in that office, going over dispatches that pertained to his duties, in preparation for the morning SPO conference— they concerned themselves with which terrorist group was making noise at the moment. No serious attempt had ever been made on a senior Agency executive, but history was not their institutional concern.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Petra	they both said. The detective switched the TV off. “They’re talking and walking. 1st das nicht wunderbar? Their new mother loves them very much, [MASK]. Well, I thought you’d like to see that. That’s all for today.”
<name>Boss</name>	Boss	Dan	“I need to talk to him.” “The phone lines are down, remember? I can get him in here in a few minutes.” “Do that, and do it fast.” “Yeah, [MASK]?”
<name>Admiral</name>	Admiral	Jackson	To the best of his knowledge, no carrier had ever sailed for a deployment, whether in peace or war, without some fatalities, and as the “owner” of the air wing, the deaths were his responsibility. Wouldn’t it be nice to be the first, [MASK] thought.
<name>Agent</name>	Agent	Elizabeth	“So if they are thinking about an attack, and they launch it within the next hour and a half, we’re dead here?” “Yes.” “[MASK], it’s our job to prevent that, remember?”
<name>Reporter</name>	Reporter	Yankevich	The police officer stuck his clipboard in his belt and went to work, handing them out to the loading dock, where the guard set them on a two-wheel handtruck. Trust the sarge to stick him with this. [MASK] met the Lieutenant at the media entrance.
<name>Marla Singer</name>	Marla Singer	Clark	“There’s something really, really big behind all this, isn’t there?” [MASK] just stared at him. “All I want is a name.” “What will you do with it?” “Nothing that concerns you.”
<name>Jason Bourne</name>	Jason Bourne	Jack	The Intelligence Star was CIA’s highest decoration for performance in the field. [MASK] actually had three. But the citation for the third was locked away in a very safe place, and was something so secret that even the new President didn’t and would never know.
<name>Adrian</name>	Adrian	Sayers	“This is the fifth time the Vikings have made it to the Super Bowl. This time it looks like they’re going to win. That Wills kid they have running for them is the best since [MASK], and because of us nobody’ll see it happen.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Russell	“Tape machine broke in the A unit over there,” [MASK] explained with a wave. “We had to bring down a backup.” “Nobody told me,” the police officer observed. “Nobody told me either until six last night.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Manfred	Who does the welding?” [MASK] asked. “I will. I’m very good at that.” The top half of the bombcase had a wide flange to ensure the safety of that procedure, and it had already been checked for a perfect fit.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Ghosn	For the moment, he set it in the comer and covered it with a toolbox. Then he walked out of the building toward his jeep. The drive to headquarters took fifteen minutes. “I need to see the Commander,” [MASK] told the chief guard.
<name>President</name>	President	Fowler	Finally it was [MASK]’s turn. The President of the United States walked to the lectern, a brown-leather folder in his hands. His shirt was starched stiff as plywood, and it was already chafing his neck, but he didn’t care.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Clark	That might have been evidence right there, [MASK] thought. There was elation that the job was going well, but sadness that such things as this really happened. The party went up the stairs, the door closed, the stairs were hauled off, and the 747 started its engines.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Jack	“After we got back, [MASK] did what he promised. I mean, of course. I’m not surprised he kept it a secret from you. There are aspects to the total operation that I do not know myself.
<name>Fidel Castro</name>	Fidel Castro	Dubinin	Not very friendly back then.” [MASK] paused. “No, that’s not fair. The political climate was very different. The hospitality was cordial, but reserved. They took us to a baseball game.” “And?” the Admiral asked.
<name>Hunt</name>	Hunt	Jones	“Okay, I want you to spend some more time on the simulator with his sonar troops.” “Fair enough.” [MASK] was quiet for a few seconds. “You know, it might be fun to go out, just one more time. . . .”
<name>Yuri</name>	Yuri	Bock	“Well?” “I have the American side of the plan,” [MASK] announced. He opened up a map and set it on the ground. “We will place the bomb here.” “What is this place?”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Bock	“There was a television camera hidden in her cell. They have her suicide on videotape. They watched her do it, and did nothing to stop her.” [MASK] didn’t say anything, and the room was too dim to see how pale his face went.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Alden	“It’s almost four,” [MASK] said, wearily checking his watch. “In three hours people are going to have their breakfasts upset—what a hell of a thing to see in the morning. Gentlemen, I think this one’s going to be big.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Clark	“I can’t, not for a lot of years, but someday I’m going to do a book. . . .” “They got out, too,” [MASK] said. “You’re looking at the guy who got them out of the country.”
<name>Mr. Brown</name>	Mr. Brown	Clark	[MASK] took out their tickets. The police would collect their luggage. The police moved them out very quickly. The business and tourist passengers would not know that anything untoward had happened until they were told by family members in a few minutes. “Very smooth.
<name>Sean</name>	Sean	Ben	“[MASK], believe it or not, I am not always right. I make mistakes. I’ve made some whoppers even, but I am smart enough to know that, and because I’m that smart, I look for people with opposing views to backstop me.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Cathy	It was really bad a few months ago, but it does seem to be getting better. I was just worried that it might be something at the office. . . .” “All behind him, [MASK]. Honest.”
<name>Director</name>	Director	Cabot	“It’s not all that unusual for an agent to want to meet a high Agency official, Director. These people get twitchy, and knowing that some higher-up cares about them is what they need.” “It’ll waste a whole week of my time!” [MASK] objected.
<name>darling</name>	darling	Jack	“Thanks, babe.” “Thank you, [MASK].” She ran a finger down his back. “You mean?” His head moved back to see her face. He got another smile, the gentle kind that a woman saved for her husband.
<name>Spock</name>	Spock	Ghosn	The thought had already occurred to him, but he was too good a leader for that. [MASK] might not be the material of a fighter, but he was an expert at what he did. His service to the organization was as valuable as any man’s.
<name>The journalist</name>	The journalist	Holtzman	But his paper paid much better than any government agency, especially since he’d also penned a few best-selling books on life at the highest levels of government. “This is deep background?” “That’s right,” the National Security Advisor said. [MASK] nodded and made his notes.
<name>boss</name>	boss	Dan	Besides which, the opposition had real limits on how many things they could examine. “Can you have your people do some scratching around?” “Oh, yeah. You’re going up the chain on this?” “I think I have to, [MASK].”
<name>He</name>	He	Jack	[MASK] had given his word. Given his word to what? For what? The worst part of all, it was now affecting him in a way that was both new and Totally unexpected. He’d disappointed his wife again this night. It was incomprehensible to him.
<name>Monica</name>	Monica	Elizabeth	The President had never felt more like a man, a great man to be sure, but at this moment, just a man. His hand slid across her breasts. [MASK]’s eyes opened wide and she smiled, as though in her dreams she had read his thoughts.
<name>Captain</name>	Captain	Dubinin	four thousand meters.” “Very well.” The Lieutenant made the proper adjustments to his board. “Set for tube one... weapon is hot, ready! Outer door is closed. Captain.” [MASK] turned to look at the executive officer.
<name>the President</name>	the President	Kadishev	And most of our problems,” [MASK] said again. “And what of the people who leave? We throw them into chaos and civil war. How many will die, how many deaths on our conscience, eh?” the President demanded.
<name>Edgar</name>	Edgar	Brent	according to [MASK]—God, this is amazing! He had separate solo sessions with both sides, and both of them suggested the same thing ... and to keep them from knowing it, he simply cycled back and forth as he said it would probably be acceptable... then confirmed it on another round trip!
<name>someone</name>	someone	Holtzman	Whenever a politician broke his word, told the most outrageous of lies, took money from a contributor and left the room at once to perform a service for that contributor, it was called “just politics.” That was wrong, and [MASK] knew it.
<name>he</name>	he	Dawkins	The armored car was tossed up and sideways like a toy kicked by a child. The open rear door was slammed shut as if struck by a cannon. The body of the truck sheltered him from the shockwave—as did the body of the stadium, though [MASK] had not the time to realize it.
<name>Secretary</name>	Secretary	Jack	You know, it’s embarrassing to have to send something like this out.” [MASK]’s eyes fell on the Directorate of Intelligence report. Their teams of Russian experts had chewed on spinnaker for a week and decided that it was probably true but could represent a misunderstanding.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Ricks	That happened to a friend of mine once.” [MASK] was truly angry now, but if you had to have such incidents, here was the place for them. “When we get above the layer, I want to go north and clear datum.”
<name>Hitler</name>	Hitler	Abdullah	The German dropped in a crumpled mass. Blood fountained out, but sideways, without reaching [MASK]’s clothing. The guard waited until the blood flow stopped, then summoned two comrades to carry the body to the waiting truck. He’d be buried with the machinists.
<name>Bob Lee Swagger</name>	Bob Lee Swagger	Paulson	Further, [MASK]’s special Sniper Rules of Engagement were explicit. If the subject appeared to threaten any agent or civilian with deadly force, then his right index finger would apply four pounds, three ounces of pressure to the precision set-trigger of the rifle in his grasp.
<name>Neil</name>	Neil	Qati	As [MASK] had noted earlier, the actual death count was somewhat disappointing. It was so easy to think of nuclear bombs as magical engines of destruction, but they were not. They were merely highly powerful bombs with some interesting secondary effects.
<name>Casey</name>	Casey	Ghosn	As long as I can face the question and the answers, then I am safe. Sure. “So?” “So I can do many things,” [MASK] replied. “But not alone. I will need help.” “And security?”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Qati	It had been too long a day for that,. She needed sleep, and knew that she’d only get five or six hours before she was on duty again. Damn these overseas trips. . . . “So what is it?” [MASK] asked just after dawn.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Claggett	So ... we’ll close to fifty-K until we have a better feel for him, then ease it in as circumstances permit. One of us should be in here at all times as long as he’s in the neighborhood.” “Agreed.” [MASK] nodded.
<name>Dr. Susan Lewis</name>	Dr. Susan Lewis	Cathy	She lavished attention on her little patients. The floor nurses loved her for it. Everyone loved her, as a matter of fact. Her surgical team was extremely loyal to her. They didn’t come any better than [MASK]. Trouble at home?
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Fowler	I disagree with him on a lot of things, but he’s never lied to me, and he’s always tried to give me good advice,” [MASK] replied, looking at the plastic-stick microphone. He suddenly wondered if it was working.
<name>Sal</name>	Sal	Clark	[MASK] wondered with a wistful smile. Maybe now he’ll take up an honest trade. . . . “How are the kids doing?” “You know, it’s kinda hard to get used to the idea of having one in college, doc.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bunker	[MASK] set his coffee down. He had decided not to drink. He wanted to be stone sober when he accepted the Lombardi Trophy from the Commissioner. “Yeah, now we just have to figure a way to stop your boy.” “Good luck.”
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Ryan	For them to reduce those sales will cost them billions in hard-currency earnings that they really need.” [MASK] leaned back and whistled. “That is surprising.” “They also want to have a few people at the negotiations. That seems fair enough.
<name>McNulty</name>	McNulty	Bill	“[MASK], the man is a genius with corruption cases—best we’ve ever had. He just doesn’t know dick about the muscle end of the business. He got out of his depth with this one. Luckily enough, no permanent damage was done.”
<name>Donny</name>	Donny	Paulson	“Nice job!” the S-A-C told everyone. That was his last mistake in a day replete with them. “You ignorant, shit-faced asshole!” [MASK] pushed him against the painted block walls. “These people are dead be-
<name>Vito</name>	Vito	Clark	They found the small restaurant quickly, and [MASK] steered everyone into a comer booth. Both the men had their backs to the wall so that they could stare outward at any incoming threat. Both had their coats unbuttoned, though they both seemed outwardly relaxed.
<name>He</name>	He	Fromm	The last bundle went in just after three in the morning, local time. [MASK] didn’t alter his demeanor a dot. He checked this one as carefully as he had checked the first, fixing it in place only after he was fully satisfied.
<name>Palermo</name>	Palermo	Jack	The project, they say, has been quashed, completely and for all time. We’ve had our technical people over everything, and they confirmed everything our German colleagues told us.” “When was this?” “Several months ago. Ever eat here, [MASK]?”
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Mancuso	Little late to talk about "my people, "fella. But [MASK] had to give him the chance, didn’t he? Not much of a chance, but a little one. If there were a miracle, then he might reconsider.
<name>The Cardinal</name>	The Cardinal	D’Antonio	The Cardinal came toward them from his desk, smiling in the way that a king might have done a few centuries earlier to greet a favored minister. [MASK] was a man of short stature, and clearly one who enjoyed good food. He must have been a good forty pounds overweight.
<name>Hitler</name>	Hitler	Petra	Such a cause. How does it feel to be rejected by the entire German Volk?" She stirred in her chair at that, but couldn’t quite bring herself... “What’s the matter, [MASK], no heroic words now?
<name>Captain</name>	Captain	Mancuso	“Well, I have the crew all ready. The sonar troops are hot.” [MASK] looked at his subordinate. At what point, he wondered, does a positive can-do attitude become a lie? “I’m a little concerned with the transfer rate from your ship.”
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Bill	“[MASK], enjoy the kid, just remember to hand him back when he messes the diapers.” “Right. Keep me posted on this. I’ll have to take this to the President myself, you know.” “You expect problems there?”
<name>Eumaeus</name>	Eumaeus	Qati	“I am honored to be of help. What is the problem, my friend?” “It is my father.” “How old is he now?” [MASK] asked. The farmer had occasionally given his men gifts also, most often a lamb.
<name>The realtor</name>	The realtor	Russell	“I know what you mean,” the realtor agreed. “I have a couple of places you might like.” “Then let’s go see them.” [MASK] smiled at the lady. The second one was perfect.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Goodley	That’s an order, by the way.” [MASK] considered that. He wasn’t accustomed to getting or taking orders. “I don’t know that I can do that.” “Why not?” “It’s contrary to my views.
<name>Angleton</name>	Angleton	Gunther	[MASK] muttered. “In yet another remarkable turn in a remarkable time, the Central Intelligence Agency hosted the First Deputy Chairman of the KGB in a conference concerning ‘issues of mutual concern’ to the world’s two largest intelligence empires. . . .”
<name>the enemy</name>	the enemy	Dubinin	The American Mark 50 antisubmarine torpedo was not a smart weapon, but a “brilliant” one. It had identified and ignored the countermeasures [MASK] had ordered only minutes before and, using a powerful ultrasonic sonar, was now looking for the sub in order to conclude its mission.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Ryan	“That is correct,” [MASK] admitted, not knowing how tired he looked. “There aren’t too many agents who could make me do that, but this is one of them.” “What can you do to confirm that?”
<name>Max</name>	Max	Callaghan	What they could see appeared to be a crater whose dimensions were hard to judge, since they could only catch bits and pieces of it at a time. It took a long look to determine that parts of the stadium structure remained standing, perhaps four or five sections, [MASK] thought.
<name>Spock</name>	Spock	Rosselli	“Oh? I didn’t know. I’m sorry. Captain, but what else can we do?” “I know,” [MASK] said quietly. “With luck maybe they can get the crew off. . . .”
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Clark	If he finds out, I’ll probably lose my job, but that’s no big thing. I have my retirement. Besides, I’m about to break bigger rules than that one. Where do I begin?” [MASK] paused before going on.
<name>Maverick</name>	Maverick	Bart	Might, [MASK] told himself, if this arrogant little prick decides to kiss my ass at the main gate at noon on the Fourth of July while the marching band passes by. “Sessions like this are supposed to be uncomfortable for everybody,” the squadron commander said.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Leary	That asshole S-A-C, [MASK] swore at himself. We ought to just back off and wait them out. The situation is stabilized. They're not going anywhere. We could negotiate by phone and just wait them out. . . .
<name>Maverick</name>	Maverick	Sanchez	[MASK] selected a Sidewinder and lined his aircraft up on the “south guy,” the trailing wingman. As the Tomcat continued to close, the pilot got the warbling tone in his earphones and triggered off his missile.
<name>Miller</name>	Miller	Benny	Behind him, about half his men were truly with him, which was possible because [MASK] had worked his watch bill to make it so. He knew without looking that they were not using their Lexan shields; instead, safety switches on their shoulder weapons were now being flicked to the Off position.
<name>he</name>	he	Jack	It just wasn’t an area in which she had much interest—as [MASK] didn’t much care about the developments in eye surgery that his wife was very excited about. Finally there did come a piece about financial impropriety and a “very senior official.”
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Jack	“Did they sweep the wheels today?” “If it’s Wednesday_” [MASK] replied. Every week his official car was examined for possible electronic bugs. “Can we talk about it, then?” “Yes.”
<name>ordnance</name>	ordnance	Zunis	The ordnancemen jostled under the aircraft, two teams each trying to do their jobs, one team trying to remove bombs that they didn’t know to be bombs at all, while the other hung [MASK] on the wings.
<name>advisor</name>	advisor	Kadishev	“How reliable is this [MASK]?” “Mr. President, he’s been in our employ for five years. His advice has been very valuable to us, and to the best of our knowledge he’s never misled us.” “Possible that he’s been turned?”
<name>he</name>	he	Ryan	She’d had a little battle with this bastard’s wife—in front of reporters!—and taken her lumps publicly. Whether [MASK] had had anything to do with it or not, he must have had a good laugh about it last night.
<name>Conn</name>	Conn	Ricks	“Weapon is free.” “Conn, sonar! Transient, transient, bearing one-seven-five—torpedo in the water bearing one-nine-five!” “All ahead full!” [MASK] shouted to the helm. “Captain!”
<name>the President</name>	the President	Ryan	None of the American identities were secret, of course, but even so. . . . “Not a real good picture, sir,” the sergeant noted with a grin. [MASK] was unable to be unhappy.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Fowler	Of course, we have to give him a fair chance... how we do that is rather tricky. We don’t want to dump the country into the hands of their military, do we?” “Are you kidding?” [MASK] observed.
<name>the owner</name>	the owner	Russell	There was clear land in all directions, a pond with some trees half a mile from the house, and plenty of room for the cattle that [MASK] would never see. “This one’s been on the market for five months.
<name>Hiroshima</name>	Hiroshima	Ismael	If the bomb’s yield is as promised, the lethal radius will encompass all of this. Total dead will number between one and two hundred thousand.” “That is all? For a nuclear bomb, that is all?” “[MASK], this is merely a large explosive device.”
