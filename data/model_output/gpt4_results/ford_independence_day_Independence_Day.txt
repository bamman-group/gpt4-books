<name>Corbett</name>	Corbett	Paul	I, of course, can’t see [MASK] on his strapped-in litter, and he can’t see me. I wave as the door slides slap-shut and the rotors rev. A helmeted pilot glances back to see who’s in and who’s not.
<name>Cheryl</name>	Cheryl	Sally	“Well. My goodness. I don’t know,” [MASK] says, acting happily confused. “Where are you right now?” “Right now I’m in the Basketball Hall of Fame. I mean we’re visiting it—we’re not enshrined here.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Sally	[MASK] usually maintains lights-off till there’s none left abroad, then sets scented candles through the house and goes barefoot. It is a habit I’ve almost learned to respect, along with her cagey sidelong looks that let you know she’s got your number.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Frank	I voiced this view meekly. “That’s your philosophy, [MASK], not mine. I’ve heard it for years. It only matters to you how long some improbable thing holds up, right?” I took my first sip of just-cold-enough gin.
<name>She</name>	She	Sally	She looks at me across the shadowy way—a look, like mine, of needing sleep. “Are you still there?” [MASK] says, possibly apologetic. “I was watching a guy make a phone call.
<name>Isadora</name>	Isadora	Clair	Whereas for me, fantasies of permanence aside as she demanded, [MASK] made bachelor life interesting, entertaining and enticingly exotic in a hundred thrilling ways, aroused my keen admiration, and kept me in good spirits, while I acclimated myself to the realty business and my kids being gone.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Paul	When I was gabbing with [MASK] about whether or not he’s truly hopeless. “I called you around nine and left a message. But I really couldn’t say no. They put the money in their trust account night deposit.” “How much?”
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Paul	“You know the tightrope walker act? About falling off and having that be your great trick?” [MASK] is ignoring what I’ve declared about the delicate balance between progressivism and conservatism, with the fulcrum being the realty business. “That was just a joke.”
<name>Trevor</name>	Trevor	Erik	“I’m happy just to play by the rules.” I take a few steps back. The young man waits till I’m ten steps away, then comes round his door and snakes up my license. I can see his idiotic gold nameplate above his blue shirt pocket. [MASK].
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Joe	Otherwise you wouldn’t have called her.” “Oh, absolutely.” [MASK]’s little goatee works first this way and then that, as if he is double-checking his memory on all counts. “No blood let. Ever.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ann	Though none did I immediately bite for, since I still somehow felt frozen in place, unable or unwilling or just uninspired to move into action. Without [MASK] and my kids nearby, I, in fact, felt as lonely and inessential and exposed as a lighthouse keeper in broad daylight.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Frank	“Of course he’s in the hospital,” I say. “Where do you think he is?” “What’s the exact name of the hospital, [MASK]?” She’s as deliberate as a scrub nurse; and I a merely dutiful next of kin.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Carter	[MASK] is still peering at his toes. “When you and I were in college, ideas dominated the world—even if most of them were stupid. Now I can’t even think of a single new big idea, can you?”
<name>She</name>	She	Joe	“We did think about just staying permanently in a motel,” she says almost as a warning. “[MASK] considered becoming an independent contractor at the book company. The money’s so much better that way, but you pay for your own benefits, which is a big consideration for me now.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Phyllis	You should just buy the first house you halfway like from your new realtor and start making yourselves happy. It’s not all that tricky.” “I’m just in a black mood because of my operation, I guess,” [MASK] says.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Nigel	[MASK] smiles introspectively, nods his head, then ducks into the shadows along the bench with his mates. I should’ve taken his picture. For, how else to seize such an instant? How to shout out into the empty air just the right words, and on cue?
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Joe	[MASK] looks toward me but not at me, in fact, looks right straight back over my left shoulder, which is his usual and most comfortable mode of address. “We’re the same age. You’ve been divorced. Had lots of women.”
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Frank	“You just need to remember the three most important words in the ‘relaty budnus,’ [MASK], and you’ll do fine in this shop,” he said, jiggering his heavy brows up and down mock seriously. ‘Locution, locution, locution.’ ”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Phyllis	The places you showed us he didn’t think did that. Your houses might be better for someone else, maybe.” “They aren’t my houses, [MASK]. They belong to other people. I just sell them. Plenty of people do okay in them.”
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Charley	She is for the party of no tradition, no influence, no nothing, also like her father. “He has his rights,” I say, and add a lackluster “I mean that.” I can’t help conjuring what [MASK]’s
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Roily	[MASK] had never mentioned word one about progress, had talked only about risk gauntlets, capital gains taxes and exposure, all of which he was dead against. “I’m not going to ask you about it now.
<name>Yoshi</name>	Yoshi	Carter	Having said this, he looks down, cinches his purple belt tight around his belly and peers at his small feet in their paper sleeves as if something about them has changed. “Why do you think that, [MASK]? Does now seem like a dramatic time to be alive?
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Paul	[MASK] asks sagely to his tanned doctor in a voice as echoless as hers. “Nope,” she says, smiling jauntily. “Not yet.” I should stay now, hear his views on child rearing, a subject he has unique experience with.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Sally	You discover you love someone by trying it without “don’t” in front of the verb? Nothing vectored by your self or by what is} If so, it’s not good. There’s a pause on the line, during which [MASK] is, understand-
<name>Ennis</name>	Ennis	Paul	[MASK] also doesn’t much smell good, smells in fact like unbathed, sleep-in-your-clothes mustiness. He also doesn’t seem to have brushed his teeth in a while. Possibly he is reverting to nature.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Phyllis	“He may be having dosage problems too.” “He’s free to do whatever he wants, as far as I’m concerned.” “I know,” [MASK] says. “You’re very patient with us. I’m sorry we’re so much trouble.”
<name>Arctor</name>	Arctor	Change	Oncology recapitulates ontogeny.” He couldn’t know what this means. “Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark.” This, of course, is very bad, though they’re both laughing like monkeys. [MASK] clicks in a pay phone slot.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Joe	“I think you’re confusing things you’re already sure about, [MASK]. All this has been pretty stressful on you.” “But I’m on the verge of something here, I think. That’s the important part.” “Of what?”
<name>Quilty</name>	Quilty	Paul	“I want him back in good shape for his court appearance Tuesday.” She has sought to lead me the way [MASK] has gone, “back through,” but I’m having no part of her sinister house beautiful, with its poisonous elan, spiffy lines and bloodless color scheme.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Ted	I do think the last house I showed them, though, is the one they ought to buy, and that was yours.” “Super,” [MASK] says. “Just super.” “Anybody else been through to look?” The crucial question.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Kristy	“You’re my whole damn problem. If I didn’t have you with me, somebody would’ve been considerate of me by now.” He gives me a big leer and a roll of the eyes. “Stand up on your feet, [MASK].”
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Charley	Plus other queries: Did she really believe I never told the truth and that [MASK]’s dull truths were better? Did she think I was a coward? Didn’t she know why I never wrote about her? More, even.
<name>Palmer</name>	Palmer	Paul	A headshrinker, I’m confident, would read signs of dread and fear in [MASK]’s dream and be right. Fear of abandonment. Of castration. Of death—all solid fears, the same ones I entertain. He at least seems willing to make a joke out of it.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sally	[MASK]’s job is more admirable but fuller of sorrows. I wouldn’t get within a hundred miles of it. Though suddenly and badly now I want to kiss her, touch her shoulder or her waist or somewhere, have a good whiff of her sweet, oiled skin on this warm evening.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Joe	It’s not what I was hoping for, but anyone could appreciate his predicament. “It is a big decision, [MASK],” I say, wanting to sound sympathetic. “If you buy a house, you own it. That’s for sure.”
<name>Tracy</name>	Tracy	Larry	Though hiking up the front steps I can hear the new window unit humming on the side ([MASK] demanded it, though I got it used out of one of our management properties), and I’m sure someone’s home.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Ted	I would be happy to choke [MASK] with my hands. “We had an exclusive listing with you, we talked about that yesterday, and at the least you were going to get in touch with me so I could put a competitive offer in, which is what I’ve got authorized.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Larry	“That’s good,” I said cheerfully. “I’m sure we’ll be seeing each other.” “Is that it?” [MASK] said. “That’s about it.” “All right then,” he said, and closed the door in my face.
<name>He</name>	He	Joe	But I don’t think you’d say I tried to force you into any of them.” “You don’t offer advice, is that it?” [MASK] is still cemented to his lounge chair, where he obviously feels in a powerful command modality.
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Susan	“Everyone who’s seen it seemed to like it a lot and they all think [MASK] and I did all right here. That’s a good feeling to have. I expected to hate it and feel a lot of grief at having my life invaded.
<name>Mavis</name>	Mavis	Phyllis	[MASK] sounds to me like she’s having to exert physical force to talk, as if she’s being stuffed in a closet or having to squeeze between big rocks. I imagine her in a pink granny gown, her arms plump above the elbows, possibly wearing socks due to unaccustomed air-conditioning.
<name>Rosemary</name>	Rosemary	Liza	[MASK] is singing, and I myself drift like smoke for a minute in the music: “Isn’t it romantic? Music in the night. . . Mov- ing shadows write the oldest magic ... I hear the breezes playing ... You were meant for love ...
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Sally	(This reflects my own wishes, of course—the unhurried nature of my single life in the grip of the Existence Period—though it may also imply that laissez-faire is not precisely the same as independence.) Where [MASK]’s concerned, however, I take responsibility for how things went tonight.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ann	Somewhere, then, another noise—not a hawk but a thumping, a door slamming or a window being shut, a drawer being closed. When I look up, [MASK] is standing at the porch rail, watching down on us across the lawn.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Erik	I wonder if [MASK] got a whiff of the dead-bird stink. “You’d probably be surprised the number of wackos come off that I-Ninety-five and end up back in here, roaming around.” “I believe it,” I say.
<name>It</name>	It	Ann	So then you have to ask somebody. I guess you’d be an obvious choice. [MASK]’s not that simple, as I’m sure you know.” He was doing it already. “I don’t know,” I said. “No.”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Irv	“We’ve probably got a lot of things to talk about,” [MASK] says prophetically, keeping his heavy hand where it is, so that I feel forced to keep mine where it is, in a sort of unwieldy, arms-length non-embrace.
<name>finger</name>	finger	Genny	Or I’d eat something else that was handy. Maybe some tapioca or a sandwich.” I edge in the door to make my presence more a feature in the room. She shakes her frizzy head and thumps her [MASK], still intent on her sex magazine.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Irv	I smile at [MASK], a man with two wives down and one on deck, a man who hasn’t seen me in twenty-five years yet who’s trying hard to console me against bad events by the honest application of his simple self to mine.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Phyllis	I smile a friendly, not-your-business smile. “Oh yeah.” “Let me get [MASK],” I say. “She’ll need a little talking to by you, I think.” “Okay, but let me just ask one thing.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sally	[MASK], though, who’s already as cut off from her past as an amnesia victim, doesn’t see things this way. She is calmer, smarter than I am, less a creature of extremes. Her house, to her, is just a nice old house she up.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ann	But I’m not sorry. Not at all,” [MASK] says, her tan shoe giving another nervous little twitch. “He’s a much better person than you are”—grossly unproved—“not that you have any reason to believe that, since you don’t know him.
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Paul	I take a look back at [MASK], who’s watching me, leaning an elbow on the plywood fence that separates the arena from the waiting line, his face completely unawed, as if he expects to see me do something stupid beyond all previous efforts.
<name>She</name>	She	Ann	[MASK] looks skeptical, her hair flattened by the swirling wind. “I think so,” I say. “He’s mine. I lost almost everybody else.” “Well,” she says and closes her eyes, then opens them, still looking at me.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sally	It’s not unusual.” In [MASK]’s case, it could be any one of a number of things. “Don’t you ever feel that way?” “No. I feel like I have a lot as it is. I have you.”
<name>Orin</name>	Orin	Ann	[MASK] is nodding. Suddenly, though, she peers directly up at my eyes, her gray, flecked irises gone perfectly round and large, shining with straight-ahead imploring. She is not wearing her wedding ring (possibly for the wit’s-end, nerves-stripped-bare look).
<name>Elmer</name>	Elmer	Karl	All of which seemed to please the daylights out of [MASK], from the evidence of how many times he nodded his head solemnly and said, “Yep, sure, okee, yep, sure, okee. Right, right, right.” But who wouldn’t be happy!
<name>Orin</name>	Orin	Carter	[MASK]’s calves are as hairless as a turnip, and above his left knee is a deep and slick-pink dent I’ve of course seen before, where a big gout of tissue and muscle were once scooped violently out.
<name>She</name>	She	Charley	Their union, though, has lasted four years, which seems long enough under the circumstances—since its chief frailty is that [MASK]’s nobody anyone in her right mind should ever marry in the first place. “So look.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Paul	[MASK], then, for no obvious reason, turns his head straight toward us, as if he’s heard something (my hiss?) and knows someone is watching, can imagine me or someone through a red-black curtain of molten dark.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Sonja	She could be down at the Lyndonville Farmers’ Co-op at this very moment, a clean red kerchief on her head, she and [MASK] blithely but responsibly shopping for the holiday—surprise fruits for the “big fruit bowl” she’ll take to the Independence Day bash.
<name>Ennet</name>	Ennet	Irv	[MASK] looks appreciatively down at himself for the eight jillionth time, trying to leech some wafting synchronicity out of his image, then shakep his head and re-snugs it among his other wallet votdves and crams it all back into his pocket, where it belongs.
<name>blind</name>	blind	Gypsy	“Was he hit with a baseball?” This she simply can’t believe; no eye protection, no helmet, no nothing. “A baseball,” I say, possibly inaudibly, my good attitude and [MASK] hope gone, gone.
<name>Algren</name>	Algren	Joe	“Now, I can tell this is a completely stable neighborhood,” [MASK] says with more of an off-duty military style now. (He means, though, no Negroes in evidence, which he takes to be a blessing.)
<name>Clay</name>	Clay	Joe	“Maybe you ought to try looking at things across a flat plain, [MASK],” I say. “I’ve always thought that looking at things from above, like you said, forced you to see all things as the same height and made decisions a lot harder.
<name>She</name>	She	Phyllis	It’s not easy to let someone into your inner circle if you’re both second-timers.” “It’s not easy for first-timers either,” I say impatiently. [MASK] seems to be angling for something. Though what?
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Myrlene	She’s wearing a bright-orange Hawaiian-print muumuu, and her ankles are swollen and bound up in bandages. I am aware she may fall slap over dead if she gets excited. “It’s all right, [MASK],” I call out.
<name>He</name>	He	Joe	“I’m joined at the hip with the tax-and-spenders, I guess.” [MASK] wouldn’t be asking if he weren’t at this very moment vacating long-held principles of cultural liberalism in favor of something leaner and meaner and more suitable to his new gestalt.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Phyl	“Is there any way [MASK] and I could get a peek at that colored rental property you mentioned? I know I got away from myself a little on Friday when I flared up that way. And I probably owe you an apology.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sally	Or I will anyway. Plus, you’re just about the prettiest woman I know.” “I’m just about not the prettiest woman you know,” [MASK] says. “I’m pretty in a usual way. And I’m forty-two.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Clarissa	“I’d like to order one of the twelve-year-old girls and maybe a pizza.” “What color would you like?” [MASK] says gravely, though she’s bored with me already. “White with a yellow top. Not too big.”
<name>Junior</name>	Junior	Paul	Though just as it does, he sways an inch back and lets it thunder past and whop the screen again. “Too close, [MASK],” I say. “That’s too close, son. You’re gonna brain yourself.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Phyllis	The house is warming now, its floors shiny with outside light, its dank odors shifting away through the open windows. “I’ll have to improvise a kiln somewhere else, I guess.” (No mention of [MASK]’s papermaking needs.)
<name>Garbo</name>	Garbo	Siberia	Not only do I not like the idea of them rummaging around in my life’s accoutrements (which they would absolutely do, then lie about it), but since we’re not talking offer, I want them left as solitary as [MASK] so they can get their options straight.
<name>Waldo</name>	Waldo	Paul	We’ve spent forty-five minutes in this hall of fame, which pleases me since we got our fill, exchanged words of hope, encountered specific subjects of immediate interest and concern ([MASK] thinking he’s thinking) and seem to have emerged a unit.
<name>Libby</name>	Libby	Joe	“Nothing’s wrong with it,” I say. “It happens to be in a black neighborhood.” “Oh Je-sus. Here we go,” [MASK] says, as if this was a long-foresee- able and finally sprang trap.
<name>Earl</name>	Earl	Karl	“We had some problems,” I said, feeling numbed by the day’s menu of sad events, plus the driving, plus my skull and all my bones beginning to ache. “Ahh, you prolly got your expectations jacked up too high,” [MASK] said, preoccupied yet annoying.
<name>Yoyodyne</name>	Yoyodyne	Karl	“No burgs, just dogs,” [MASK] answers, and viciously slides back the screen. “Just dogs and birch beer, boys,” he says, turning cheery, leaning into the window, his big damp haunch hoisted once again into the air.
<name>Sheldon</name>	Sheldon	Jake	“I was remembering while I was waiting for you at the hospital”—Irv allows a look of good-willed perplexity to pass over his big Levantine mouth—“that you and I were around [MASK]’s house together while our parents were married. I was right there when your mother died.
<name>Danny</name>	Danny	Paul	I carried that sandpaper regret around in me for a time back in 1970, then simply omitted it the way I’d have [MASK] omit the nightmares and dreads of his child’s life stolen away by bad luck and unconscionable adults. Forget, forget, forget.
<name>Orin</name>	Orin	Karl	“And hot dogs,” [MASK] observes, having heard me say something I haven’t said, his voice faint for most of it being directed into the hot day, and making it easier for me to hear the polka music, which is pleasing.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Joe	[MASK] says enigmatically. “It seems to be, these days,” I say, thinking perhaps he’s talking about real estate. I more noisily jingle the keys to signal my readiness to get a move on—though I have little to do until noon.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Frank	Suddenly my chill is over and I’m hot as a sauna bath. “You might just feel happy for me, [MASK], instead of suing me. I’ll probably be dead in a year. So it’s good I sold my house.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Irv	But that’s interesting for the future,” [MASK] says, nodding, and meaning again that it’s not interesting at all but the goddamn craziest thing he’s ever heard of, though he’ll pretend it isn’t because he feels sorry for me.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Carter	Thanks, but no thanks. I muse up at [MASK]’s small, delicate features, which seem added on to a flat map. I mean to look as though I can’t imagine a single idea, good or bad, but know there to be plenty floating around loose.
<name>James</name>	James	Paul	“What good is it to come to some beautiful place?” [MASK] says broodily, his chin still resting on the green pipe, his heavy, downy-haired legs splayed so as to reveal a scar on his knee, a long and pink and still scabby thing of unknown origin.
<name>Joelle</name>	Joelle	Sally	She keeps shaking her head, though less forcefully. “I just should’ve left, that’s all. Do you even think you know why you and I got unmarried?” She takes a brief, angling look at me—uncomfortably like [MASK]’s look.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Sally	Something like this very thought, of course, is what put me to sleep at [MASK]’s today. “You just want everything to seem perfect and everybody to seem pleased. And you’re willing to let seem equal be. It makes pleasing anybody be an act of cowardice.
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Ann	He is, I know, silently wishing us both clear sailing toward the next horizon. 12 [MASK] is standing in the emergency room lobby all alone, in her but-toned-up tan trench coat, bare-legged, wearing worn white running shoes.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Cathy	See ya. Bye. Of course wait for the beep.” Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep, click, then the yawning, paralyzing opportunity to leave the most appropriate of messages. “Hi, [MASK]?” I say, exhilarated.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Frank	I am made lightheaded at the unexpected arousal of death. “I’ve got it sold, in fact,” I say faintly. “You’ll find them another house, [MASK]. I didn’t think they much liked it here.”
<name>Hal</name>	Hal	Charley	I would miss it with my son. “We’ll have to talk to him. I’ll talk to [MASK]. We’ll have to see what his ombudsman says. In principle it might be all right. Isn’t that okay to say now?”
<name>Morty</name>	Morty	Joe	[MASK] is running his stubby finger and snapping eyes over some listing sheet fine points, undoubtedly pertaining to “extras” and “rm sz,” and “schls.” Noting the “sq ftge” for his new work space.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Clary	It’s surprising we all don’t do it more. “How’s [MASK]?” “Okay. They’ve gone to sleep in his room now. She says she wants to look out for him.” “Girls mature faster than boys, I guess.
<name>She</name>	She	Sally	“I’d be careful about it.” “You’re always careful.” [MASK] knows plenty about my life—that I am sometimes finicky but in fact often not careful. More of irony. “I’d be more careful,” I say.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Phyllis	My old man”—the Chinese-slum king of Aliquippa—“had a wide streak of social conscience. He was a Socialist. But what the fuck. Maybe living here’ll pound some sense in my head. Now [MASK], here, she’s the mahout, she rides the elephant.”
<name>Danny</name>	Danny	Paul	For a brief time I talk about [MASK], noting that he is not much attracted to fire, doesn’t torture animals, isn’t a bed-wetter that I know of, and that my hopes are he will live with me in the fall.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Joe	But the Houlihan house is worth a serious thought. We’ll see some movement there pretty quick if the other agencies are on the case. It may be a good time to make an offer if you thought you wanted to.” “You’re talking to yourself,” [MASK] sneers.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Sally	“Look. I’m in a public phone here. But I feel a lot better. I just want to see you tomorrow if I can’t see you in ten minutes.” “Where?” [MASK] says smally, still susceptible. “Anywhere.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Paul	Another interior whirring sound becomes audible. I watch as another ball wobbles down the metal track, disappears and then is shot through space, hissing across the plate directly under my fists and again whanging the fence behind me, untouched and unswung at. [MASK] again says nothing.
