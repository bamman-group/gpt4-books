<name>she</name>	she	Nina	“It’s a tumor he’s got, you know that, it’s one of them down here,” the nurse said with a clumsy embarrassed gesture, halting the gesture at once so that [MASK] didn’t really have to look. But she knew, she supposed she knew.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Dorie	She had never liked her body. [MASK]’s body was so much more prim and chaste and stylish, and her own body belonged to another age, a hearty nineteenth century where fat had been a kind of virtue.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Peter	I’m sure that everything will turn out well.” “We won’t tell your wife anything, [MASK],” I assure him. He is not shocked by this. I thought it would shock him, but it doesn’t; he nods slowly, gravely.
<name>Uncle Andrew</name>	Uncle Andrew	Dutch	He, being [MASK] (I think), speaks in a very logical singsong voice, as if always speaking to children. Confused, I nod at my mother. I agree. She is telling me what to do with my life.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Simon	A lady in a brown suede coat. Boots of shiny black material, black gloves, a black fur hat. She would be humiliated could she know that of all the people in the world it is my ex-lover [MASK] who walks most like her . . .
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Nina	that perhaps means I am emphasizing this moment, for no reason. [MASK] took the sponge from the nurse and began to wash her father. Her hands were trembling, but her face was set, determined. She had an angry look.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Nadia	I want to go back home, where my mother is,” [MASK] would say, gently and persistently, so that anyone who heard her knew she was demanding something. Of her husband she said little. “It was a mistake. I was too young.
<name>she</name>	she	Eileen	“We’ll go right in and you can introduce us,” the man said. “That won’t be possible,” [MASK] said with a terrified laugh. His grip on her arm was firm and she returned it, her fingers turning rigid on his hand.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Betty	“My wife [MASK]—” This was a surprise: a wife. “Very pleased to meet you,” he heard his voice say. She colored pleasantly, a pretty girl, ordinary and pretty and very young, like all the girls he noticed these days.
<name>my mother</name>	my mother	Miranda	Families. Mothers, fathers. Twin sisters. The family is the deepest mystery, deeper than love or death. I have not seen my father for six years but I think of him every day, just as he thinks of [MASK] and me-—every day.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Conrad	She couldn’t stand him. At first she had drifted into loving him, in that mild maternal way women love men when they are really “between” men but need someone around, need to keep in practice, and [MASK] was the end of that.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Andrew	She stood aside awkwardly and he entered, prepared for the cramped living room and its bargain-basement furniture, the quilt fixed primly over the back of the sofa, the remnant rugs in doorways to protect the ugly brown rug beneath. Familiar, familiar. [MASK] felt absurdly sorry for both himself and this woman.
<name>David</name>	David	Bobby	On that morning [MASK] went to school as usual. A few complaints. No tears. I helped him on with a new shirt and the two of us threw the old shirt in a wastebasket, as if this were an important ceremony, a way of beginning the week.
<name>Ignatius</name>	Ignatius	Buchanan	There is a sharp odor of burning grease; the grease and the burned eggs are scraped into a paper bag under the sink. [MASK] wanders around, out onto the landing. . . . He wanders back inside the crowded flat and the smoke bothers him.
<name>he</name>	he	David	Isn’t this silly?” If she questioned anything, [MASK] lost his capacity to be certain about it. She might have doubted his own past, the years before she came into his life, and he would have had to struggle to retain it.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Eileen	“Let’s walk through here. Inside here,” he said. He meant the Norlans’ park, or what was left of their park. [MASK] stared at him. “But someone might see us—” “The house is empty. Just servants.”
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Jimmy	The soldier comes back. Now I can see that he is really a boy. He runs to the table with the beer before he drops anything. He laughs. “[MASK], your ma wouldn’t like to see you drinking!” the woman says happily.
<name>Gregor</name>	Gregor	Alex	“But why are you sitting like that? You can let your arms rest on the table, please, [MASK], don’t sit there like that— you know you’re perfectly all right, please,” his mother said. “Yes, I know.
<name>Neil</name>	Neil	Peter	—“Your mother has no talent. Your mother is a criminal type,” one of your ex-lovers told us, right in this apartment at a big party; I think it was that Swede who came between Niles-the-plastic-surgeon and [MASK] himself.
<name>John</name>	John	Eileen	The collar gave way and the dog lunged forward and ran blindly across the street. [MASK] looked around in surprise and saw a car bump the dog gently, as if this car had been lying in wait for months or years and only now had the opportunity to leap forward.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Miranda	Mother, or if I could cross over into forgetfulness by taking pills, like [MASK], I would not have to remember so much. The water sparkles in the sunlight—the sunlight is a little strange today, almost oily from the impure air.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Marcey	“You let him get killed—you let him loose! Let him loose! You never liked him and so you let him loose!” Her father’s shouting awakened everyone in the house and out of the kitchen [MASK] came, in a hurry.
<name>Holly</name>	Holly	Nina	They took an apartment together a few blocks from [MASK]’s old place, in a Victorian horror given over to mysterious tenants—bachelors of various ages and sizes, working girls with bright blotched faces, a lady who wore gauzy white gloves every day.
<name>He</name>	He	Mark	that morning he had left the house in a rage and when she went into his study, prim and frowning, she had discovered four or five crumpled papers in his wastebasket. It was all he had accomplished that week. [MASK] had never won the Pulitzer Prize for anything.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Honey	His whole face was a mask, she thought wildly, tanned down to his throat but then running out as if he had plastered makeup on his face but had forgotten about his throat. “[MASK]—? Listen, here’s how it is.
<name>he</name>	he	Andrew	I won’t be staying long.” She hadn’t the shrewdness to disguise her relief at these words. She sat facing him on a footstool, the sort of odd piece of furniture [MASK] remembered as a hassock—how strange that such things had disappeared forever from his life!
<name>Dolores</name>	Dolores	Nina	All the words they had used up, the avalanche of meanings they had summoned!—and now it was silent, the house was sold to someone else and [MASK] hadn’t even thought of driving past it, all that was forgotten. She wondered how this had happened.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Dorie	“I would like children, maybe three of them,” [MASK] said. “Three is a good number, yes.” “But I’d be afraid ... I wouldn’t know what to do. . . . I don’t know what to do now. . . .”
<name>the lawyer</name>	the lawyer	Buchanan	And he remembers a consultation with his mother’s lawyer, at home. His mother said, “Then if that’s the case, if we know all these things, then why can’t the visits be revoked?” And [MASK] had held his breath, waiting.
<name>She</name>	She	Eileen	His body was warm and damp. [MASK]’s heart began to beat violently and she thought, I’m going to die, and a part of her fled backward to the old house in which her parents awaited her, asking them for help.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Shelley	He had been given a grant to write a book and to use the excellent library of an excellent university forty miles away. His book was going to explain the theory of space-time relativity in nineteenth-century poetry, with an emphasis on [MASK], I think ...
<name>divorce</name>	divorce	X.	I was thinking about divorce, theoretically. I was thinking about how it would shake everything loose, make us see ourselves plainly and terribly. . . .” But she is only toying, only toying with [MASK] She will never divorce him. He will never divorce her.
<name>her</name>	her	Nina	He had wanted to lead people. A leader of minor causes, dedicated, arrested, marked for execution by his own men. . . . People told [MASK] about him, warning her, but she wouldn’t listen; she said, So what?
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Vince	Nothing is expected to change. “What did the doctor say?” [MASK] asks. v. “The usual thing.” “That you’re accusing her . . . ? Threatening her?” “Yes. I don’t want to talk about it.”
<name>era</name>	era	Dorie	He was a rather stout man. He had played football once in a past [MASK] could not quite imagine, though she wanted to imagine it, and he had been in the war—one of the wars—she believed it had been World War II.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Connie	What do you want?” [MASK] said. “If I call the police they’ll get you, they’ll arrest you—” “Promise was not to come in unless you touch that phone, and I’ll keep that promise,” he said.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Elaine	Before it was too late and too many secrets were told, so that the four of them would be bound together for eternity.... “I’m very sorry to hear that,” [MASK] said. “Yes, that’s . . .
<name>Mrs. Bixby</name>	Mrs. Bixby	Nina	yes, [MASK] said angrily, she had understood all along. She wanted to see her father. It seemed that he had changed from the day before, that quickly. So a person can change that quickly. There was a soft, bloated look about his wasted flesh.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Weinstein	She could only be one person in her lifetime. That was the ugly truth, she thought, that she could not really .regret [MASK]’s suffering and death; she had only one life and had already given it to someone else. He had come too late to her.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Nina	[MASK] wasn’t a woman with much memory, no interest in memory, and yet she began to wonder automatically about death, arrangements, a funeral, a burial plot. . . and would the grief be much? Already she feared the grief.
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	Duane	Yeah, really?” “It was in the newspaper. His mother-in-law or somebody called the police, he was breaking windows in her house.” ‘That [MASK] was always a nut!” “Is he out now, or what?”
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Alex	Some other car would hit it, not us. We could watch. . . . We could stuff that blanket in its mouth, what do you think, isn’t that wild? What do you think?” [MASK]’s head was pounding violently.
<name>Dolores</name>	Dolores	Nina	Her love for him ran round and round in a circle as she touched him, not quite caressing him but only touching him, examining him with her fingertips. “Ah, [MASK],” he said, “you’re not like those other bitches. . .
<name>unknown</name>	unknown	Connie	said, still laughing. The way he straightened and recovered from his fit of laughing showed that it had been all fake. “How do you know what my name is?” she said suspiciously. “It’s [MASK].” “Maybe and maybe not.”
<name>Uncle Oscar</name>	Uncle Oscar	Dorsey	He wondered suddenly if there might not be some danger of their infecting the baby. His hands were very large, holding it; his skin looked dangerous and flaky in the mottled light. “I know what, let’s play a trick on [MASK].
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Alex	The special soap in this bathroom was ballshaped, gold and white, and it gave off a lovely sweet scent. But sometimes the soap balls grew dusty because they were never used. This feeling for the bathroom was important, because it might have had to do with [MASK]’s decision.
<name>Darry</name>	Darry	Randolph	Don’t you know they hate you? They want you to fail, like them, they want you to get burned up in a fire from them smoking in bed. ...” I began to cry again. “[MASK] doesn’t smoke,” he muttered.
<name>Dean</name>	Dean	Conrad	[MASK] showed surprise at this. “I can’t imagine anything that temporary,” he said. “I’m really monogamous, I have a monogamous soul. It’s just that marriage repels me, the papers and the blood test, and it does nothing for love, and. . . .
<name>someone</name>	someone	Nina	She was embarrassed and, to explain everything fast, held out an envelope to [MASK]. “It just came special delivery and the man knocked at my door. It must be important, so . . . so I came over, I’m sorry to barge in here like this.”
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	David	Now they were talking about politics, and [MASK] could at least handle his side of the conversation. He felt aged, weary, a tennis player trapped in a game with someone twenty years younger, lunging to get shots no one expected him to get. He drank.
<name>Don</name>	Don	Vince	but I am here a few yards from him and I prefer the image on the television screen: more vivid, more handsome, without distractions, winking intimately to the housewives and to me, only to me. . . . After lunch, [MASK] takes me to lunch.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Turner	Then he followed it, every detail. “[MASK]—what’s that?” I said. “A book I need. I’m going to drive to the library.” “When?” “I thought around noon.” My heart pounded viciously.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Pauline	She too collected things, antiques and jewels, and kept up what she thought to be an enthusiastic interest in “culture”; it was something to talk about with enthusiasm. “We’re stopping at the auction after lunch,” she told [MASK].
<name>Mr. Spencer</name>	Mr. Spencer	David	He had a thin, earnest, eager face, this boy who was no longer a boy but a man, growing into manhood and therefore forcing men like [MASK] on into middle age before they were ready for it.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Doris	The girl was slight and had the frail powdery look of a moth, a colorless fluttering insect of some sort. It was embarrassing that her mother was so solid and horsey; in fact the girl, [MASK], called her mother “the horse” behind her back with a kind of smirking, satisfied affection.
<name>Edmund</name>	Edmund	Jerry	You hate men because of their weaknesses; then you love them because they are so weak. You take [MASK]’s hands in yours. You are half a head taller than he, but you are not old enough to be his mother. You can’t be everyone’s mother!
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Frank	Just a little porch and I can stand out there and let my hair dry or anything. It’s funny that [MASK] never saw it, because now it’s a place I go all the time and stand there and, you know, think about things. . . .
<name>Socs</name>	Socs	Alex	She was associated with a crowd [MASK] had been aware of for years, without taking any real interest, having heard of their perpetual adventures and daring every Monday throughout high school. He had heard a number of things about them but did not exactly believe everything he heard.
<name>John</name>	John	Weinstein	If she had been deceived by him, she made herself think angrily, it was as a teacher and not as a woman. He had promised her nothing. [MASK] appeared the next day near the steps of the liberal arts building.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Conrad	She would force them to nothing. [MASK] came up finally, by bus. He stormed around, arguing. He’d been drinking on the bus and he had a pint of liquor with him. “What the hell is this? What’s going on?”
<name>She</name>	She	Frank	There was no hint of any man having lived here and he realized suddenly that [MASK] had never lived here. He felt a vague curiosity about the rest of the apartment. “Why did you move here?” he said. She turned to him at once, at his service.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Greg	Today the sky is blue. The trees are changing colors, it is October 20, I have got to buy some new clothes sometime soon, we’ve changed dentists, doctors, everything is lovely here and I hope the same with you. [MASK] is working hard as usual.
<name>Sebastian</name>	Sebastian	Allen	“Should I call you Professor? We don’t . . . you know ... we don’t understand the technicalities that go with—[MASK], my son, wanted to go here to the Catholic school; I told my husband why not? Why fight?
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Vince	[MASK] makes a bow, he presents me with the “flower.” “Do you love me a little?” he says as a joke. I take the flower from him. It is not a flower, and it will never be a flower now.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Buchanan	He sleeps in a crib with a giant rubber doll, a naked doll with many nicks and scratches on its body. [MASK], suddenly tired, kicks some things together in a corner and lies down to sleep. He puts his hands over his ears.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Elaine	“Yes, tomorrow, you’ll be coming home tomorrow . . . ?” “Yes.” “I’m so glad.” They had stared uneasily at each other. He said her name to himself, [MASK], but he could not believe it.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Frank	[MASK] says. “What?” “Out for a boat ride.” “What? No, next week. Do it next week. We’re going to play cards.” “You said—” “Shut up, we’ll do it next week.”
<name>He</name>	He	Buchanan	He looks down into the rumpled back yard that ends in a clutter of lilac bushes and brambles; next door is an abandoned house, boarded up. [MASK] can see right over into its attic, where pigeons are strutting. A dead house. Boarded up.
<name>Donald Trump</name>	Donald Trump	Bobby	The shirt was not tucked in his pants. I hated that look, it reminded me of [MASK] and his friends. “Please, please . . .” he said. I closed my fist and hit the table. “Why is he still upstairs?”
<name>John</name>	John	Buchanan	[MASK] tells him, every week. He is dutiful and tedious. The very tedium of his story means that it is true, everyone believes him, they are relieved that he is doing so well because then they needn’t hear much more of it.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Nina	They embraced. They were friends, though perhaps not best friends, they were in love. When they made love [MASK] thought, There, that’s accomplished, if we die now we’re that much to the good. . . . Danger was all about her.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	X	The dialogue, the duet, had stretched out for hours; we had tugged back and forth, this exquisite, powerful, venomous woman, a married woman, the wife of my friend [MASK], and I, rather thin-armed in my sports shirt and no match for her, no match.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Conrad	“But beneath it we understand each other,” [MASK] liked to say. They drank beer in one of the neighborhood bars, or lounged around with friends in someone’s apartment, drinking, or they strolled hand in hand through the dreary city park.
<name>girl</name>	girl	Connie	They were maybe ten feet apart. After his hand fell back to his side the X was still in the air, almost visible. [MASK] let the screen door close and stood perfectly still inside it, listening to the music from her radio and the boy’s blend together.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Frank	“You kids watch out. Where’s your father?” the man says. “He’s gonna take us for a ride,” says [MASK]. “Where is he?” The boys run along, looking at the boats that are tied up.
<name>Rachel</name>	Rachel	Sharon	So much blood! The bathroom door is closed. I mold my face out of my hands, still seeing her. Why did she do it? Why not my aunt, why not the woman next door? Why not my friend [MASK]’s mother?
<name>Nanny</name>	Nanny	Marcey	His business day began at nine in the morning and ended usually about ten; he used the telephone. “[MASK], bring me out some biscuits. And butter. And jam.” He went back to his study and left them, his daughters. Two women!
<name>Lolita</name>	Lolita	Sonya	Through her ears are two enormous red hoops of plastic, with smaller black hoops inside them. They all turn and move by themselves. She has clear, radiant skin, this [MASK], and her eyes are rather large and protruding as if with perpetual excitement.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	David	“. . . What do you think about that new law? Stopping and frisking men on the street?” [MASK] tried to think what this was. He no longer read the newspapers; he had just forgotten about them. “Is it constitutional?”
<name>David</name>	David	Frank	If it could get free it would fly and be safe, but the scum holds it down. One of the kids throws a stone at it. “Stupid old goddamn bird,” somebody says. [MASK] throws a stone. They are all throwing stones.
<name>he</name>	he	Toni	and I moved right in here when [MASK]—that’s the wife, you know her—when she didn’t want to stay here— I moved in, it was real convenient for me—” “He’s dead?” “I’m awful sorry.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Buchanan	Saw lions and tigers. Saw elephants. The lady made a lunch and we had sandwiches in the park.” “Why do you lie? Why are you lying to me?” “We had hot dogs in the park!” [MASK] shouts.
<name>the girl</name>	the girl	Barbara	“Stop thinking about it. Sit still.” “Yes,” the girl said listlessly. They drove on. Something began to weigh at [MASK]’s heart, as if her flesh were aging moment by moment. She had never liked her body.
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Connie	You’re crazy!” [MASK] said. She backed away from the door. She put her hands up against her ears as if she’d heard something terrible, something not meant for her. “People don’t talk like that, you’re crazy,” she muttered.
<name>it</name>	it	David	They walked along briskly. The corridor was gray and made [MASK] feel nearsighted: something vague and fuzzy about the way it was lighted. “We were lucky to get in here, so near school. . . . Someone said he was moving out. . .
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Jesse	The screens at the windows don’t fit right; you can see why flies get inside. [MASK] opens the door for me and I go in. All bars smell alike. There is a damp, dark odor of beer and something indefinable—spilled soft drinks, pretzels getting stale?
<name>Mr. Bell</name>	Mr. Bell	Jerry	If he could get to the moment at which they offered him a drink he would be all right. [MASK] indicated the best chair. He sat. The little girl asked him about drinks and he said, “Yes, anything,” and she disappeared.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Doris	but if I go back he’ll make me stay . . . he’s sort of strange. . . . He’s twenty-four.” “[MASK], we’d better go back. Let’s take the baby back.” He felt a little sick.
<name>She</name>	She	Conrad	He lived alone, yes, he was a strange man and had never cared much for her, and she hadn’t cared for him, and now . . . now he was dying and what the hell did he want with her? “How do you know he’s dying?” [MASK] said.
<name>Mrs. Hale</name>	Mrs. Hale	Nina	“And what else? Anything else?” “I’m going to wash him a little. . . .” “No, I’ll do that. I’ll do that myself.” [MASK]’s teeth were nearly chattering, she was so nervous.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Frank	[MASK] has gone off with some friends of his, to a stock-car race. There are some people here, sitting out at the tables, but they don’t notice us. “Why doesn’t he hurry up?”
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Barbara	“Why, don’t you like her?” “She’s nice. She smells nice. Is she going to stay long?” “Go ask your father that,” [MASK] said angrily. The girl was officially boarding with them; it was no lie.
<name>Constance</name>	Constance	Pauline	Her back is shaking. A friend of her mother’s talks patiently to [MASK], who lies hunched up in bed, rigid. “If you would try to relax. If you would let us dress you,” the woman says.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Alex	[MASK] watched the doorway of the house for someone to appear and shout at them, but no one came. “Why don’t you have a car? Why don’t you have a girl friend?” “I don’t know. Don’t want them.”
<name>he</name>	he	Buchanan	His mother will call the police and have his father arrested. . . . What woke him was someone talking hysterically in the other room, telling a story, and [MASK]’s head aches with the desire to know what is going on. But he does not move.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Bobby	Nothing has been decided, I thought. Why was I happy? It was two-thirty already. I hadn’t eaten. I felt sick. I drove around until quarter to three, then I drove to [MASK]’s school. My happiness made me dizzy.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Eileen	[MASK] did not want to see what the word was, but she supposed it was the same word she’d seen scrawled in white, or black, or red, quite frequently around the neighborhood. Little Negro boys, no kin to the Heilmans’ Negro, were the criminals.
<name>Unknown</name>	Unknown	V	She had the immediate thought that she must be safe—if it was morning she must be safe—and someone had taken care of her, had seen what was best for her and had carried it out. [MASK]
<name>Raymond</name>	Raymond	Greg	I had to wake [MASK] up. I couldn’t stop trembling, I wanted to tell him of the waste, the waste of joy and love, your being mashed soundlessly into a road and pounded into a shape no one would recognize as yours. . . .
<name>The narrator</name>	The narrator	David	And so on until dinner. They ate in the kitchen, but the overhead light had been turned off and there were candles on the table. [MASK] was touched by how hard the little girl was trying. “More of this sauce?” “No, thank you.”
