<name>Papa</name>	Papa	Sam	[MASK] grew solemn and held up his hand, “Kids, I want you to listen: she’s been crying all night; this is the end; soon you’ll hear a new kind of cry. That will be the new baby. Listen, listen!”
<name>her mother</name>	her mother	Sam	She wondered vaguely, from time to time, if she would have been any different if her mother had lived. But she did not believe it, and the picture of a yearning, tragic, sickly young woman that [MASK] drew did not catch her fancy.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Sam	[MASK] was delighted. He wheeled the twins round cheerfully and began to march them. “Now then,” he said, “To market, to market to buy a fat pig, home again, home again, jiggity-jig!”
<name>Mrs. Joe</name>	Mrs. Joe	Henny	I’ve always been your friend, you know that.” “Go up, go up at once, or I’ll let them know what you put in the washhouse,” said [MASK] with a spot of color under her rouge.
<name>Babbitt</name>	Babbitt	Sam	“Yessah.” “That’s a bit of irony,” yelled [MASK], putting his hand between [211] his mouth and his secretary’s ear: “he can’t make himself heard to sell his noisemakers.”
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Clare	When examination results were posted, [MASK] appeared in most [344] lists at the top or as runner-up. Most often she would be “sick” the day before a test, or her aunt would be sick the week before a term examination.
<name>The Snake</name>	The Snake	Megara	Are you mad? What are you doing? [403 ] Embrace, kiss me. (Aside) The snake? (He tries to hiss to himself.) [MASK]: (Shrieking) I am dying. You are the stranger. You are killing me.
<name>Parnassus</name>	Parnassus	Naden	‘Oh, [MASK],’ said I, ‘I would ask the Lord at Judgment Day to leave a little bit of my own earth and make me forever mortal on it; then under a great green-headed native elm I would sit and [312] watch the little mortal birds.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Louisa	“I’ll never do it again,” thought [MASK] a thousand times, more miserable than she had ever been before, as if one of those dreams had come true, those dreams where she found herself walking down the street in a hat and a bodice without any skirt or shoes.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Sam	The communication between men ought to be the most sacred of all things: and if we weren’t so busy building warships,” declared [MASK], in a temper, “we would have money for better mail services: and if we weren’t despised by people because we live in a mudhole.
<name>it</name>	it	Megalops	“Don’t be a fool! I can’t stand any more of it; I’ll kill myself. You’re going crazy. No wonder you’re a laughingstock, believing every horrible bit of paper.” “There must be some basis for this; is [MASK] mine?
<name>Ron</name>	Ron	Ernie	Pottering dolefully to the room he shared with the twins, [MASK] pried up the loose board (loosened by him) under which he kept his money box and sat down with it in his hand, wondering and occasionally shaking it a little.
<name>Louise</name>	Louise	Bonnie	[MASK], with her hair damp and tumbled, was holding helplessly in her hands, so that they could see, a blouse so badly burned that the burned piece flapped in and out like a shutter. It was a fine em-
<name>Aunt Alexandra</name>	Aunt Alexandra	Sam	After this came a calm, during which the girls, both bawling, cleaned up the room and stripped the beds to air, while [MASK], in a low, sad voice, lectured the boys outside on female sluttishness, and told them the sort of wives they must pick.
<name>Snape</name>	Snape	Olive	“How does he know?” “He went down to ask why his kids didn’t pass and he found out everything.” [MASK] sidled down the street again and, without another word, but with a few backward grins and grimaces, made towards the Middenway store.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Sam	[MASK] swam up to the surface of the river of moisture that was drowning, suffocating him, and looking at all these happy or inquisitive dark faces, flashed smiles at them, talked to them all, felt the great urge of love of man rise up in his throat.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Looloo	I was patient at first, many years. You were too young then, [MASK]: you did not see how kind I was, hoping for an improvement: constant dropping wears away a stone, and it was only much later that I found out hardness worked better than love.
<name>Auntie</name>	Auntie	Sam	“I can’t believe he would do that, even so.” “Come and get a bite to eat at home with me: I’ll ring up [MASK] and keep you overnight. Then you simply have to go back and face the music.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Pet	I want to be happy. Kiss me, my girl: let this be our fortress against the world. I will make you understand me. You see, [MASK],” he said very low, “I need a woman to understand me. That is my softness.
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Sam	a barbarian chant with which they raised the roof and restored good humor. When this was done, they slid out of their places, and [MASK] pleasantly went to fit the hinges and watch the sailing of the quite-finished whaleboat and part-finished buckeye in the creek.
<name>Nietzsche</name>	Nietzsche	Nietzsche	“What do you mean?” “But I know something else: if it is chaos, it will not be chaos forever: ‘out of chaos ye shall give birth to a dancing star!’ [MASK] said that.”
<name>Aunt Alexandra</name>	Aunt Alexandra	Sam	But at any rate he intended to oil the universe with the game, and make the luxurious sportsmanlike spearfish work for mankind. At four o’clock sharp, the children were lined up for the ice cream that [MASK] had just sent for in pails, ranged from the biggest to smallest and the smallest first.
<name>Mrs. Prothero</name>	Mrs. Prothero	Pollitry	They told her something about their lives, which were not cataclysmic, such as [MASK] lived, but lives lived in neat corpuscles, lives which only looked out, squinted-eyed, askance, dubious, through two fishy eyes.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Henny	It was for a little bride of fourteen; but I got the man to give it to me.” He had forgotten that he had taken it as a childbed present to [MASK]. She watched him depart with it, with a bitter look, but said nothing.
<name>him</name>	him	Barry	If they give me a little corner to go and live with [MASK] when he’s dead, that’s all I ask. Let her get it and enjoy it: she’s got life before her. Let her enjoy life over my old stringy carcass.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Looloo	“Then you don’t believe me?” “Of course not. Do you think I’m going to be taken in by a silly girl’s fancies? You must think me a nitwit, [MASK], after all.”
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Sam	“A nice sort of thing to make up,” said [MASK]. “You are too much alone: I hear so much stupidity, I can’t understand it. Get up and get dressed, I want to talk to you.”
<name>Madame Sosostris</name>	Madame Sosostris	Henny	Darkness poured from the sky with the hissing as of falling ashes, trickles of fire, and sudden explosion. [MASK] got out her cards and started to play her famous double patience (with two packs of cards).
<name>Macaulay</name>	Macaulay	Tuan	‘[MASK],’ he said (though I told him many times I was no master but the servant of the people), ‘I am surprised at this, for you are one of the Heaven-born.’
<name>Harlan</name>	Harlan	Sam	[MASK] believed that it was opposition to this grand socialist plan which was fermenting in the Department; and to his proposition that a quarter of a million dollars should be the petty cash at first allocated to the new branch of Federal Government therein proposed.
<name>Louisa</name>	Louisa	Bonnie	[MASK], pale, looked over the balustrade at her brother, who however said nothing, only looked foolish and helpless there in his overalls, half naked, with spots on his face. She started up the stairs again.
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Naden	It was for pure goodness of heart and kindness and duty that he got himself indebted; perhaps they will throw him into prison-all for being profuse with the milk of human kindness. Is that bad?” “One is obliged to consider ways and means,” said [MASK], unshaken.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Ernie	[MASK] rushed past the knot of children and threw himself on his mother, pulling at the bosom of her dressing gown, disarranging it wildly, screaming, "Mother, Mother, you aren’t dead? [ S08 ] Is she dead? Is she dead?
<name>Galileo</name>	Galileo	Samuel	He would not change his opinion for anyone, once he had one. [MASK] does not really care for success, but for science and getting at the truth of things. I think he is a really remarkable man; but I suppose that’s foolish of me.”
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Henny	“No, but you’re dying to,” said [MASK] with a grimace, "I should like a stiff drink. I wish the churches and the smug big shots with cellars of their own hadn’t passed this law.”
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Henny	I’ve got no use for it. I eat my breakfast in the upper kitchen. It’s sunny. You take it, [MASK]. You know what I’d like to do? Give all the furniture away before next time He comes! Ha-ha!
<name>Hiram</name>	Hiram	Rosalind	Hit’s a crostword puzzle. Blow me darn, here’s anotherl Pearlshell, pearl, and madrepore. Purple wampum, rich fish dyes. Of gold and silver a great store. In megaron, in mattamore; But, [MASK], thou art much more.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Sadie	“[MASK] was a lady,” she would suddenly say in the stillness, and, “Hrmph!” or, “If I had a ladida like that to deal with I’d drown her when a pup.”
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Henrietta	[MASK] looked at him, pulled her glasses down on her nose, and sang. Like his father, like his father, He has the cut of a kangaroo, Bandy-legged and ginger too; And his nose is very pecu-li-ar—
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Louie	All the children watched and showed her where to lay the cards, until she said good-humoredly, “Oh, go and put your head in a bag!” and she taught [MASK] how to play, saying she must never touch them when her father was round, that was all.
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Louie	There’s my sister and brother and two [342] mortgages—the only thing that worries me is the boys: the brutes won’t look at a poverty like me! What does it matter what I am?” [MASK] was silent.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Louie	[MASK], who was standing at the top of the stairs ready to answer her whistle, started to come down, stumbled on the oilcloth, and sat down three steps below. She had hurt herself, but at the present time she was practicing to be a Spartan and so said nothing.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Sam	For [MASK] could rave and the little children could look at her queerly when she blurted out the half-formed thoughts in her mind, but she felt sure that she only felt what was going on under the ribs of the visible world.
<name>Doodle</name>	Doodle	Jo	I can’t stand it: it’s like a birch broom in a fit. I wish she would stop pawing and mugging me. Ugh!” And the children pondered once more over this mystery; why was [MASK]’s fine corn-silk hair so ugly?
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sam	She had heard his whistle and had rushed upstairs with her book. “Why, why?” thought [MASK]. “She could have waited to hear what her daddy has been doing all day. She is so dogged—and she has her little burdens.”
<name>successfully</name>	successfully	Looloo	They may not be all exactly as I would have wished, but they are dear to me: they will go the right path and follow the light; they will come through, [MASK]. I want you to know I am optimistic for you all.”
<name>Simon</name>	Simon	feyther	It had been a great day, this day of welcome, and they were glad to sink on the grassy bank and swell his humming. And thar we see a swampin gun Large as a log of maple Upon a dandy little cart A load for [MASK]’s caytle ...
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Henny	“Oh, I’m too tired to fight him,” [MASK] said in the kitchen. She dawdled in, her color high and her eyes black, and sat down stiff as a poker in her armchair, which was always left vacant for her.
<name>Kid</name>	Kid	Louie	“Yes,” said [MASK]. “That quench the fire of your pernicious rage; but it’s a long one. Do you want to hear it? Besides I don’t know much more.” “What else do you know, kid?”
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Nellie	[174] “You’re going to the reform school for children,” [MASK] said sharply. “That’s where they send bastards. You see. Someone told me. You stole a cooky at the grocer’s.”
<name>Myrtle</name>	Myrtle	Jo	Why can’t they work in the daytime? I nearly fell asleep on the bus coming over.” [MASK] sniffed and nodded her bright-colored head, "It’s a scandal 1” “Why don’t you get a little car?”
<name>Mr. Kurtz</name>	Mr. Kurtz	Sam	[MASK], looking keenly at him, because there was no reply, saw the smile and asked, “Do you think I have feet of clay?” “That is the only safe thing to have, sah.
<name>She</name>	She	Louie	He saw [MASK] come to the veranda and look out, look down on him, and then go back. He thought, “It’s early, nearly light, and she’s awake: we’ll go for a little walk since she’s awake.”
<name>Aunt Dahlia</name>	Aunt Dahlia	Sam	[MASK] testily cried, “Like what? Like what? What is all this about? I never heard so much idiotic drivel in my born days. Go [ 405 ] and put your fat head under the shower.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Sam	But [MASK] was quick enough to catch a little smile on his friend’s face, so he led him round to look at the new aquaria, and then into the boys’ room to ask his advice about the darkroom.
<name>Dorothy</name>	Dorothy	Pet	“Oh, I’m a brute; but the way they drive me mad and I feel as weak as a cat through getting nothing to eat!” “Let me make you a little bite, [MASK]!”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Sam	[MASK] read them all two or three times, but presently the leaden air pressed him down, and he put out the light, crept under the mosquito nets, and lay on his pillow. In a little while it was sweat-drenched: his blood beat feverishly and his head ached, ached.
<name>Evelyn</name>	Evelyn	KCN	It am death, com- [483 ] plete—to-tal annihilation: yes, rabbits take a whiff of that, and they don’t even wait for the Angel of Death. Light doesn’t go as fast as [MASK].
<name>He</name>	He	Ernie	But [MASK] was different. He went to look at the table and count the places, see that all was there, spoons, forks, knives, when he saw the glass, sitting solitary as a lighthouse on an atoll.
<name>Matilda</name>	Matilda	Isabel	[MASK] went to school (in the corner), put up her hand, scribbled on the floor, and after a surprisingly short morning came home for lunch. At lunch she was invariably rude to her mother and had to be slapped.
<name>Maugham</name>	Maugham	Sam	“You will not mind if my friends are there,” he asked in the tone of one repeating a question. “Your friends are my friends, only they probably like you better,” said [MASK]. The thick, moist Singapore night closed round them.
<name>Jon</name>	Jon	Louie	And your father doesn’t like you because he beats you. I know. I heard. A little bird told me. I know. You’re a bastard. You get beaten.” [MASK] was perplexed and ashamed.
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Henny	[MASK] got up and started to play patience on her dressing table, brushing aside the extensive toilet set and looking at herself occasionally in the mirror. She liked to do this: it refreshed and encouraged her. “Good God, what an old hag!”
<name>Rembrandt</name>	Rembrandt	Rumpelstiltskin	He’s forged ahead. He’s a nice man. He came round last week and that Gray woman made up to him shamefully, to try and get that position. She sat up all night making a picture of [MASK] and she signed it! ‘Rembrandt’!
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Sam	At Christmas and for the various birthdays, he disbursed handsomely and strictly in order and percentage of age. He had a calculator in the back of his notebook, which now stood as follows: New Year’s Day, 1936. [MASK] (father) Mother Louisa Myself
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Evie	“A man should travel,” he told [MASK] suddenly: ‘‘home deadens a man’s wits: I’m a better man away from home”—but scarcely were these words out of his mouth than he regretted them, dark treachery to his home, his native land, and his loved ones!
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Louie	Don’t you notice when we walk down the street together that the women and men too look after me with a smile; and that they look at you surprised at your glum, stupid, sullen air?” “I notice,” said [MASK].
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Pete	I couldn’t have borne to have seen it. I’ve had bad luck myself! That boy of mine in the shop ran a bone into his finger and got blood poisoning, and just five weeks after [MASK] got his finger into the sausage machine.”
<name>God</name>	God	Bonnie	He was grave and deeply ashamed, offended with Fate, not [466] with [MASK]; he muttered his favorite saying over and over as the train racketed along, Good name—in man—and woman—good my Lord, Is—the Immediate—Jewel—of their—souls!
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Sam	[MASK] stared at her, “What do you mean, you don’t care? You [438 ] don’t care for my thought for you? You don’t care for my years of torture and what might well have been mental rot and spiritual death for me?
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Ernie	You know it’s going to rain, perhaps.” “The sun draws up the water, the water makes clouds and when they reach an icy layer the water is precipitated,” [MASK] explained. “The teacher told us, the teacher told us.”
<name>Mrs. Dubose</name>	Mrs. Dubose	Louisa	“[MASK], mind your own business! Kids, go to bed, and if one of you mentions it, I’ll beat you till I can’t stand up! What will I do with that child?” she moaned, going back into the warm room.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Louie	“Oh, why don’t you write. Dad? Why don’t you put it all down and send it in?” cried [MASK], wringing her hands, with long, drooping cheeks, “Why do you let them say it?”
<name>Mr. Wopsle</name>	Mr. Wopsle	Bonnie	[MASK] ignored all this, calling out, “Now let’s have a little song before we break up, not too loud, but not too soft.” “Yes,” said the old man eagerly, “yes.”
<name>the child</name>	the child	Evie	Go to sleep. You had too much fun. Ssh!” But [MASK] had opened the sluice gates, “I can’t, I can’t.” “Ssh! I’ll tell you a story.” This had no effect.
<name>Nanny</name>	Nanny	Henny	Upstairs, [MASK] could not sleep and went downstairs to get the baby, which she took back upstairs with her. She got into bed, holding the heavy body of the unconscious child as long as she could, and then placed it in the bed alongside her.
<name>anyone</name>	anyone	Sam	Permanganate, or carbolic acid, or arsenic, who would take it? There are so many things. Why, [MASK] has cyanide in the house any time: that’s what they kill vermin with, you blow it in the holes. Why?
<name>Tagore</name>	Tagore	Naden	“And particularly by your own people or peoples, [MASK], [217] whom I love, respect, and wish to understand. How otherwise can we teach them the few things we ourselves know in human progress?
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Louie	The cleaning-up was a great satisfaction to him. The entire crew of children (except [MASK]) was around him, grunting as they carted the gluey soup out in all the large household utensils, buckets, basins, watering cans, and pots.
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Ernie	His passion interested all his relatives, and they liked to give him money to add fuel to the flames! Odd human race, thought [MASK]. But he himself was no miser. At Christmas and for the various birthdays, he disbursed handsomely and strictly in order and percentage of age.
<name>Eddie</name>	Eddie	Henny	What’s new? That’s fine, that’s fine!” He gave their order and then, one hand washing another, leaned over the table to [MASK], “Now then, what’s new? Want to hear the latest?
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Louie	[MASK] sank down on her bed in a stupor, her heart beating hard. It was not the quarrel, nor even the threats of murder, but the intensity of the passions this time that stifled them all. And why, out of a clear sky?
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Sam	He took another swig of the claret cup, which was beginning to blush his ancient mind. [MASK] was unhappy and irritable, “Father, you know what my principles are. Fermented and spirituous liquors dethrone reason, deform morals, and disgrace social gatherings.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Henny	It was halfwater; the surface was dull, and the sky was windy. At that particular moment, [MASK] awoke from a sort of sullen absence and knew what was happening; her heart was breaking. That moment, it broke for good and all.
<name>Marmee</name>	Marmee	Sam	I wanted us to be so happy today, happy and rejoicing because your poor little [MASK] loves you and is doing what is best for everyone.” Looking at them all tenderly, he cut up the fruit himself and poured out the tea.
<name>Marco</name>	Marco	Sam	Some discussion ensued as to whether he was going by bus, boat, or airplane. [MASK] let them spar for a while and then went into detail, dreamy-eyed, warmly describing the journey over land and sea, the peoples he would come into contact with.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Tommy	“Would you care for a cup of tea?” “Yes, I should be very glad of it.” She rooted [MASK] out of the armchair, saying, “You and your everlasting messing,” and flopped into the chair sighing.
<name>Lady Bracknell</name>	Lady Bracknell	Barry	“And did you hear the latest about My Lord? [MASK] saw me burrowing into the dirty-clothes basket and thought it was the washerwoman and started to feel my sitdown! Did I turn round like a fury and give him something to think about!”
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Louie	My silly [MASK] has written a motto on a piece of paper and stuck it on the side of her bookcase, ‘By my faith and hope I conjure thee, throw not away the hero in thy soul.’
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Louie	I have got to take you away from school and keep you at home with me until you recover. You are not yourself.” “You don’t notice anything. Everything has to be what you say,” said [MASK].
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Henny	3 ^ Conversation. “He lives,” said [MASK] to herself, in her bed, “in a golden cloud floating about over a lot of back alleys he never sees; and I’m a citizen of those back alleys, like a lot of other sick sheep.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Looloo	(For don’t think I don’t understand this foolish little passion of [MASK]’s: it is good in itself, it needs only direction: I am not unsympathetic as she thinks in her poor big silly obstinate skull!)
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Looloo	I’m sick myself, [MASK],” he said breaking down suddenly. “I can’t go much further myself.” He stumbled into the riotously littered dining room and across it, skirting every manner of grotesque and outlandish thing to the sunroom, where he threw himself on the settee.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sam	“Yessah,” he said firmly. “Wouldn’t you like to be light-colored like me?” “No, tuan: I am not Heaven-born as you are.” “You must not say that to a poor mortal like me,” said [MASK].
<name>Uncle Tom</name>	Uncle Tom	Sam	Get out of my sight: go to bed. I don’t understand you.” Half smiling, bursting with confusion, the hulking child rose, gathered together her papers, and went into her bedroom. [MASK] flung himself into his armchair and then got up and went out.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Evie	She looked at him, the image of his father, and repeated, “I’m a greasy old soup plate,” making them all laugh, laughing herself. “Mother, you’re so silly,” [MASK] said.
<name>Jordan</name>	Jordan	Sam	[MASK] laughed. The water was almost smooth, with long splintershaped ripples, and the long, delicate shells of rowboats stood obliquely along the near jetties, which were mere sticks and runways. Two handsome steam yachts were anchored in close, and a small two-master with a schooner prow.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Looloo	I heard you speak the other day of the Augustan Age, [MASK]: now, that was a wicked age. I wish they would not teach you history, for the pages of history are blotted with crime—only in the good around us, and in our own lives, can we do good.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Louie	[MASK] was deeply puzzled and sin-filled. But at once she began inventing, in the cockles of her heart, a hocus-pocus of denial, and explanation, about the cookies and the flowers. But how, in the name of everything under the sun, did anyone find out about them?
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Cathleen	She was deeply ashamed of her figure, stooped to hide it, and clung fervently to her mother’s side. [MASK] had been one of those rare children who love dolls passionately: her entire uncompanioned childhood had been spent nursing dolls and dreaming of them.
