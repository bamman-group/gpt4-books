<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Bill	All of them moved away from the table. [MASK] had not opened his own fortune cookie, but now he could see its sides moving slowly in and out—bulge and relax, bulge and relax, bulge and relax—as his own party-favor tried to escape.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Richie	The gun went off below him, the sound nearly deafening in the closed room. Gunsmoke, sharp and acrid, stung [MASK]’s nose. It shocked him back to some sort of awareness and he realized that he had been trying to turn the thumb-latch the wrong way.
<name>Delores</name>	Delores	Belch	It went down like cool silk and hit his stomach like an explosion of lava. He shuddered all over, moaning . . . and then began to feel a little better, a little more connected to the world. “Thanks,” he said. [MASK]’s head turned toward him.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Mikey	I asked him about the Black Spot for no real reason; it had just jumped into my mind and I seized on it. His eyes sharpened and he smiled a little. “You ain’t never forgot that, have you, [MASK]?”
<name>Roland</name>	Roland	Bill	It was turning, presenting Its stinger. It means to kill him. . . kill his body, anyway. . . while his mind is somewhere else. It means to shut him out forever. It’s winning. . . [MASK], where are you?
<name>Ritchie</name>	Ritchie	Richie	“Right here.” “I love you, man.” “Same here.” “Okay. Keep your thumb on it.” “Beep-beep, [MASK].” He laughed. “Yeah, yeah, yeah.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Henry	Then there had been the rockfight, and [MASK] had been chucking M-80s at people’s heads. You could kill somebody with one of those things. You could kill somebody easy. He had started to look different. . . haunted, almost.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Bill	She was gone before any of the men could rise. [MASK] shook out his napkin and threw it over the fly, which was the size of a baby sparrow. Nothing so large could have come from something as small as a Chinese fortune cookie . . .
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Eddie	He scrounged a hank of rope from one of the empty quonset warehouses and tied the crate onto the package carrier of his bike. His mother had peered inside the crate even more warily than [MASK] himself, and then she screamed—but with delight rather than terror.
<name>Vincent</name>	Vincent	Denbrough	I’m going, and I think maybe I’ll stay gone. I think maybe it’s over.” “Who’s this guy [MASK]?” “Forget it. I was—” She realized almost too late that the question had been a distraction.
<name>Stevie</name>	Stevie	Mikey	And in his soul he would raise a silent cheer that shook the walls of that mostly cheerful room. He felt love for everything around him, and most of all for his dad, who would grin over at him and holler: “Hold on, [MASK]!
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Richie	And [MASK] felt his grip slipping. He heard Its guttural roar of triumph and concentrated his being on holding . . . but he continued to slip. He bit down frantically, but Its tongue seemed to be losing substance and reality; it seemed to be becoming gossamer.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Richie	A FOR sale sign flapped forlornly from the porch of one. To [MASK] the sign looked about a thousand years old. The sidewalk stopped, and now they were walking along a beaten track from which weeds grew half-heartedly.
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Mike	A low mist, smoky and thick, lay in the hollows of the land and crept around the boys’ legs. It had a thin acrid smell like burning green wood. He and [MASK] began to move toward the sound of the running water without speaking, pushing their way through the strange foliage.
<name>Alvin</name>	Alvin	Richie	But, [MASK] believed, it was the reversion that was the hallucination, not the present life. Maybe the child was the father of the man, but fathers and sons often shared very different interests and only a passing resemblance. They— But you say grownups
<name>Catelyn</name>	Catelyn	Sonia	“All I know is that we’re standing here doing nothing while we should be setting your son’s arm.” “Are you suggesting—” [MASK] began, her voice rising toward the high, bugling note it took on when she was most upset.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Richie	“I thought two, maybe as many as three of you would be gone by the time we started our meeting tonight. Missing or dead. Just seeing you turn up gave me reason to hope.” [MASK] looked at his watch. “Quarter past one.
<name>Stu</name>	Stu	Mike	But he forgot all about that and everything else when [MASK] spoke again. “This bird was bigger than a housetrailer,” he said. He looked at their shocked, amazed faces. He waited for their laughter, but none came.
<name>Emmett</name>	Emmett	Henry	For awhile, [MASK] thought they were coming from the moon. In the late afternoon, looking up from where he was hoeing in the garden, he could see the moon in the blue daytime sky, pale and small. A ghost-moon.
<name>Danny</name>	Danny	Eddie	“A silver suit with big orange buttons down the front.” [MASK]’s mouth dropped open. He shut it and said, “If you’re kidding, say so. I still ... I still dream about that guy under the porch.”
<name>Ben</name>	Ben	Beverly	“A-All of you b-b-behind me. Then into the suh-suh-cellar.” “If you go first and that thing jumps you, what do I do?” [MASK] asked. “Shoot through you?”
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Beverly	“I believe you,” [MASK] said. “After what happened at my house, I’d believe anything.” She got up suddenly, almost knocking over her chair, and went to the dryer. She began to pull out the rags one by one, folding them.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Stanley	[MASK] ran back down the stairs (somehow he had climbed more than a dozen, although he could only remember climbing two, three at most), very much afraid now. It was too dark in here to see any- thing.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Beverly	[MASK] spied a babydoll, its plastic skin so brightly pink it looked almost boiled. She picked it up, then dropped it with a little cry as she saw the whitish-gray beetles squirming from beneath its moldy skirt and down its rotting legs.
<name>John</name>	John	Eddie	Where’s the place for me in any of that? the panicky bird-voice would cry when these strange, almost nightmarish thoughts came. Where would my place he in a life like that? I love you, [MASK]! 1 love you! I take care of you
<name>Abner</name>	Abner	Alfie	[MASK] claimed the coming winter was going to be a jeezer. He had seen as many as eight rings on some of the mohair caterpillars, he said, an unheard-of number. Another man held out for ice; another for mud. The Blizzard of’01 was duly recalled.
<name>Jon</name>	Jon	Eddie	And still he did not reply. “[MASK], are you hearing me?” “You sent my friends away,” he repeated. “Yes,” she said, dropping the pretense, and said no more. Two could play at that game.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Beverly	By the time they arrived, the beans were doing their work quite nicely. 4 Little by little, [MASK] got herself under control again. She knew she had to get out; beating a retreat was ultimately less dangerous than hanging around.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Bill	Not me.” “[MASK] will write,” she agreed. “But he’ll never write anything as nice as that. May I use your handkerchief?” He gave it to her and she began to clean her face as best she could.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Bill	The feeling was warm and comforting and deeply familiar. [MASK] felt the sense of power that he remembered from before, but understood with some desperation that things really had changed. The power was nowhere near as strong—it struggled and flickered like a candle-flame in foul air.
<name>Piggy</name>	Piggy	Bill	“Duh-duh-duh-hon’t g-g-go!” [MASK] cried. He put his empty hands up in the air, palms out, to show he was harmless. “W-W-We need some huh-huh-help.”
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Beverly	But every twenty-seven years—although the cycle has never been perfectly exact—that violence has escalated to a furious peak . . . and it has never been national news.” “You’re saying there’s a cancer at work here,” [MASK] said.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Bev	You’ll snap. He had answered: You do it my way, [MASK], and that day will never come. Now, before the rage blotted out everything, he wondered if that day hadn’t come after all. The cigarette.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Freddie	It didn’t take long to tell; doors were still slamming and engines starting in the parking lot outside when she finished. [MASK] was silent for some time, looking out his window. Then he swung back to her. “He’s had a nervous breakdown of some sort.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Bill	[MASK] felt the familiar weight of dread settle around his heart again—was it something you could get used to so quickly, then? Or had it been something he had carried all along, simply unfelt and unthought-of, like the inevitable fact of his own death?
<name>Granny</name>	Granny	Bill	If an animal’s grunt could have a smell (and, [MASK] supposed, if the animal in question had been eating the right things, it could), it would be like this undersmell. We’re headed in the right direction, all right.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Ben	He turned back to the young woman, who was looking at him, puzzled. “Is anything wrong?” “No,” [MASK] said, smiling. “I thought I heard something. I guess I’m more jet-lagged than I thought.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Mike	The marks he was following could have been made by a dragging pair of shoes or sneakers, he supposed. [MASK] shivered and looked around uncertainly. The story was somehow a little too real. And suppose that it wasn’t a man who did it but a monster.
<name>David</name>	David	Billy	I suppose they must.” “[MASK], I know that I love you,” she said. “For eleven years that’s been enough.” “I know.” He smiled at her—the smile was sweet, tired, and scared.
<name>Georgie</name>	Georgie	Belch	His face was a hanging ruin. One of his eyes was gone, and a rotted hole in one parchment cheek revealed blackened teeth. Perched on [MASK]’s head was the New York Yankees baseball cap he had been wearing the day he died. It was turned around backward.
<name>Daffy</name>	Daffy	Bill	“Shoot through you?” “If y-you have to,” [MASK] said. “But I suh-suh-suggest y-y-you try guh-hoing a-around, first.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Bill	[MASK] swerved to avoid an overturned trashcan and barrelled out into the street again. Brakes squealed. He saw the grille of a big truck approaching and still couldn’t seem to stop laughing. He ran through the space the heavy truck wound up occupying a full second before it got there.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Ben	There were softball sign-up sheets and Community House Children’s Theater sign-up sheets. And, of course, one inviting kids to JOIN THE summer reading program. [MASK] was a big fan of the summer reading program.
<name>Algren</name>	Algren	Richie	“It’s bad, I know, but it’s true,” [MASK] said. “Your nose is the first thing to go. Some guys with the Syph, their noses fall right off. Then their cocks.”
<name>Colt</name>	Colt	Walther	— something about the way it leaned, mute and oily, in the corner of the garage closet; as if it might say / could be mean if I wanted to; plenty mean, you bet if it could speak). But this pistol, this [MASK] ...
<name>Artie</name>	Artie	Mike	“You reh-reh-reh-recognized him?” “I think so,” [MASK] said. “I have to check something before I say it’s for sure. My father’s got some pictures. . . . He collects them. . . .
<name>Tabitha</name>	Tabitha	Marty	“I know,” he said, and realized that, even though she was hugging him with rib-breaking tightness, his asthma had eased. That whistling note in his breathing was gone. “I know, [MASK].” The taxi-driver honked again.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Stanley	“Think of procreation during. ” She began to giggle, even though she was by then feeling a bit lonesome and frightened. And that night, lying in bed, long after she believed that [MASK] must be asleep, he had frightened her by speaking out of the dark.
<name>He</name>	He	Bill	There were more comics, plus a few models and toys and a stack of 45s, on the desk. There was also an old Underwood office model typewriter on it. His folks had given it to him for Christmas two years ago, and [MASK] sometimes wrote stories on it.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Tom	Moving with careful agility, her mouth turned down at the corners and jerking as if in prelude to some sort of convulsion, she skirted the vanity, toe-stepping through the broken glass, and grabbed the belt just as [MASK] heaved the vanity off to one side.
<name>Politics</name>	Politics	Ayuh	It was like politics, in a way. [MASK], like that. Like town business. Best let people who understand politics take care of that and people who understand town business take care of that. Such things be best done if working men don’t mix in.”
<name>Stevie</name>	Stevie	Ben	He was about to turn away when something else caught his eye: a cement cylinder with a heavy steel cap on the top. Morlock holes, [MASK] used to call them, laughing with his mouth but not quite laughing with his eyes.
<name>Tim</name>	Tim	Mike	“Stand back!” [MASK] shouted. “There it goes, there it goes!” They stood away and watched as the big circular cap overbalanced, then fell. It dug a slash in the wet earth and landed upside-down, like an oversized checker.
<name>Frances</name>	Frances	Tom	Don’t, I love you, can’t it be over? No—it could not. Because that was not the bottom of her wanting, and both of them knew it. Say it. I forgot about smoking in front of you, [MASK].
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Bev	“Rock and roll in the sticks really sucks,” he said. His voice was not quite steady. “[MASK]’s right, we’ll leave it off, what do you say?” No one replied.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Mike	“A dream. Really.” He looked at [MASK]. “I don’t mind taking a walk, though. It’ll kill the afternoon. Views of the old homestead.” “So we’re agreed?”
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Eddie	He and [MASK] had lowered the seat as far as it would go, and it now bumped and scraped against the small of his back as he worked the pedals. A woman digging weeds in her flower-garden shaded her eyes to watch him pass.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Eddie	Then she was in darkness, alone with the sound of the falling web and [MASK]’s simple moveless weight. She didn’t want to let him go, didn’t want to let his face lie on the foul floor of this place.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Beverly	That fly business has been on my mind a lot lately, because I’ve sort of been planning this novel—Roadbugs, I’ve been thinking of calling it. I know the title sounds p-pretty stupid, but you see—” “Excuse me,” [MASK] said distantly.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Eddie	It meant to take him back to the Canal, to carry him down into the dank blackness of the Canal’s underground passage. To eat him there. [MASK] put on a burst of speed. The arc-sodium light at the gate drew closer.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Richie	“Yeah, not bad,” [MASK] agreed. “The blackflies are gone and there’s enough of a breeze to keep the mosquitoes away.” He looked at her hopefully. “Got any cigarettes?” “No,” she said. “I had a couple
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Bill	“Maybe we better try to go a little faster.” They went on for half an hour, [MASK] calling the lefts and rights. The sound of the water continued to swell until it seemed to surround them, a scary Dolby stereo effect in the dark.
<name>Alvin</name>	Alvin	Richie	[MASK] elbowed him aside enough so he could look, too. The basement was a dim litter of crates and boxes. The floor was earth and, like the leaves, it gave off a damp and humid aroma. A furnace bulked to the left, thrusting round pipes at the low ceiling.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Ben	They matched the pompom buttons which ran down the front of his suit. One hand grasped a bundle of strings which rose to a bright bunch of balloons, and when [MASK] observed that the balloons were floating in his direction, he felt unreality wash over him more strongly.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Eddie	[MASK] stood like a boy in a dream, hearing the muffled screams and sounds of struggle as his friends were being pulled in. He sensed the tentacles around him but none had as yet actually landed on him. Run home! his mind commanded him quite loudly.
<name>David</name>	David	Richie	Both boys screamed. [MASK] heard snarling sounds. They were very loud—the sounds a wild animal in a cage might make. He saw loafers descend the steps. Faded jeans on top of them—swinging hands— But they weren’t hands . . .
<name>He</name>	He	Richie	She looked at him for a moment, her lips trembling, and [MASK] thought she would cry. Instead, she exploded. “Well, fuck you!” She whirled around to look at the others, and they flinched from her gaze, so hot it was nearly radioactive.
<name>Quiller</name>	Quiller	Henry	He picked his aspirator out of a puddle of carbonated water, stuck it in his mouth, and triggered it off. He shuddered at the taste, then gave himself another blast. He looked around at the body on the carpet—could that be [MASK]?
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Henry	Even through the intervening bushes and trees he could see it was much wider than the one into which he and [MASK] had fallen. Here was another of those concrete cylinders, barely visible amid a snarl of blackberry creepers, humming quietly to itself.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Bill	“I-I-If you guh-guh-guys 1-1-laugh, I-I’ll never h-hang around with you again,” [MASK] said. “It’s cuh-cuh-crazy, but I swear I’m not muh-haking it up.
<name>Georgie</name>	Georgie	Richie	It’s g-g-got me!” [MASK] turned around on his hands and knees and saw the terrified circle of his friend’s upturned face in the square of the oversized cellar window through which a winter’s load of coal had once been funnelled each October.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Belch	“No.” “I think yes. Maybe you yo-yos did Its work, but It didn’t exactly play favorites, did It? It got both of your friends, and while [MASK] was fighting It, you got away. But now you’re back.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Henry	[MASK] watched the fat little prick scutter across the street; his belly bouncing, the cowlick at the back of his head springing back and forth like a goddam Slinky, his ass wiggling like a girl’s inside his new bluejeans.
<name>Ennis</name>	Ennis	Will	“I don’t mean just a little crazy,” [MASK] said, lighting a home-rolled Bugler cigarette and looking at his son. “He’s about three steps away from the boobyhatch. He came back from the war that way.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Bill	And suddenly it was in his hands, a great living thing that pumped and pulsed against his palms, pushing them back and forth. (NONONONONONONO) Yes! [MASK] cried, choking, drowning. Yes! Try this, you bitch! TRY THIS ONE OUT!
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Eddie	But he needed the aspirator worse than ever four hours later, coming out of a light doze all in a single spasmodic jerk that caused the fellow in the business suit across the way to lower his paper and look at him with faintly apprehensive curiosity. I’m back, [MASK]!
<name>Shakespeare</name>	Shakespeare	Bill	Cause if a kid like me—a fat kid like me—did something like that, the girl would probably laugh at him.” “I didn’t laugh. I thought it was beautiful.” “I could never write anything beautiful. [MASK], maybe.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Richie	[MASK]’s gonna have a bird.” He reached for her in the dark. She felt his hand touch one of her breasts, then jerk away, as if burned. She groped for him, got hold of his shirt, and drew him close.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Mike	“We mean the same thing, I think, but they’re not getting it.” [MASK] coughed into his fist and then looked up at the others, almost apologetically. “I don’t know just how to tell you,” he said.
<name>Bev</name>	Bev	Georgie	There had been a time when the TV room opening off the kitchen would have been full of talk and laughter, sometimes so much of both you couldn’t hear the TV at all. “Shut up, [MASK]!”
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Bill	Looking inside as the cab idled at a stoplight, [MASK] could see a record shop, a natural-foods store, and a toys-and-games shop which was featuring a clearance sale on all dungeons and dragons supplies. The cab pulled forward with a jerk.
<name>Bev</name>	Bev	Marty	That was how he knew. So terrified. “[MASK],” he said across this gulf of years, “would you give me a kiss?” She kissed him and hugged him so tightly while she was doing it that the bones in his back groaned.
<name>Cholly</name>	Cholly	Richie	Although his trombone-playing was really not much better than [MASK]’s Voices, he was fond of the instrument, and whenever he felt blue a half an hour of fog-horning Sousa marches, hymns, or patriotic airs cheered him right up again.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Richie	The things that happened next seemed to [MASK] both then and later like something out of a movie—such things simply did not happen in real life. In real life the little kids took their beatings, picked up their teeth and went home.
<name>Delbert</name>	Delbert	Bowers	First he saw [MASK], standing tall and paunchy and nearly ridiculous in his johnny, his loose flesh doughy in the light spilling in from the corridor. Then he looked left and screamed out two lungfuls of silent spun glass.
<name>Roland</name>	Roland	Patrick	She had lost all interest in target-shooting. Also, she had to pee. Come on, she thought. Come on, hurry up and go, hurry up and go, puh-LEEZE! A moment later she heard [MASK] roar with mixed laughter and pain.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Richie	They ran around to the front of the house and [MASK] thought, It won’t dare chase us anymore, we’re on the street now, it won’t dare chase us, won’t dare, won’t dare— But it was coming.
<name>Roarke</name>	Roarke	Audra	And this woman was drowning—” “[MASK], don’t.” Her eyes were steady, holding his. “Oh, why not? Let us tell the truth and shame the devil. I was drowning.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Henry	Whatever the reason—cuts, sprain, library books, or even the thought of the soggy and probably illegible rank-card in his back pocket—it was enough to get him moving. He lumbered forward, squashy Keds spatting in the shallow water, and kicked [MASK] squarely in the balls.
<name>Porky</name>	Porky	Bill	“I don’t think you’re crazy.” “Well, we-we won’t th-think you’re cruh-cruh . . . nuts, e-e-ei-ther,” [MASK] said.
<name>Quiller</name>	Quiller	Eddie	His shoulder struck the heavy ice-cream-soda glass. It toppled off the desk and shattered on the floor like a bomb. [MASK] heard that only dimly. He was clawing the top off the aspirator, slamming the nozzle into his mouth, triggering it off.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Kay	So where is she, you numb cunt? Tell me.” [MASK] turned then and ran for the end of the hall, wanting to get into the parlor, rake the sliding mahogany doors closed on their recessed tracks, and turn the thumb-bolt.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Stan	His mother made him promise to keep the hood of his slicker up, but [MASK] would have done that anyway. He was a fastidious boy. There were never any fights about getting him to wear his rubbers or his snowpants in the winter.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Bill	In his effort to reconcile these two emotions—his love and his terror—[MASK] felt that he was closest to finding where final acceptance lay. These were not things of which he could have spoken; to his mind the ideas were nothing but an incoherent jumble.
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Beverly	He looked at [MASK]. “Like your folks never saw the blood that came out of the drain, even though it was everywhere.” “Yes,” she said. They stood looking at each other in the fine spring rain.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Ben	He took a honk on his aspi- rator as [MASK] pulled a rusty nail from a board with the claw end of his hammer. The nail squealed like some small unpleasant animal that had been stepped on and didn’t like it.
<name>Smirnov</name>	Smirnov	Eddie	His glasses fell off. He cursed, groped for them, and set them, dripping, back on his nose. He pulled in breath and shouted again: “You’ll get lost without [MASK], you fucking asshole! Wait up! Wait up for us!
<name>Lois</name>	Lois	Richie	“Beep-beep, [MASK],” she heard herself reply from roughly a thousand miles away. The Werewolfs head was suddenly there, in the wishbone. She covered one of Its green eyes with the cup and released.
<name>Stuart</name>	Stuart	Stan	He and his father usually went out together, but his father had had to “work over” that night and had called specially at suppertime to talk to [MASK]. One of his customers at the agency, another birdwatcher, had spotted what he believed to be a male cardinal—
<name>Bev</name>	Bev	Betty	I heard [MASK] somewhere down in those friggin pipes. Laughin. She was somewheres down there in the dark, laughin. Only it sounded more like she was screamin, once you listened a bit. Or both. Screamin and laughin down there in the pipes.
