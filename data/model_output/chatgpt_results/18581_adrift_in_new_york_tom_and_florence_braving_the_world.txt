<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tim	However, I never looked upon him as a man who would shrink from any violation of the laws, except murder. I don't think he would do that." "No; [MASK] isn't quite so bad.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Dodger	"Lie flat on your back," said the steward. "You will feel better if you do." "How long is it going to last?" groaned [MASK], feeling quite miserable. "Oh, you'll feel better to-morrow.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Curtis	"How do you feel this morning, uncle?" he asked, with feigned solicitude. "Ill, [MASK]. I didn't sleep well last night." "I don't wonder, sir. You had much to try you."
<name>Lord Peter</name>	Lord Peter	Bolton	Where will we all be at the end of that time?" "Not in jail, I hope," answered [MASK], jocularly. "I am afraid your uncle will no longer be in the land of the living."
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Dodger	"No; if I had she'd have said so." "Humph! this is strange. What is your name?" "[MASK]." "That's a queer name; have you no other?" "Not as I know of."
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Tim	Sometimes I feel like leaving [MASK], and settin' up for myself. I wonder how 'twould seem to be respectable." The boy approached the secretary, and with some tools he had brought essayed to open it. After a brief delay he succeeded, and lifted the cover.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Dodger	Now I shall summon the police, and you can do as you please about going." [MASK] struck the stick sharply on the sidewalk three times, and the ruffian, apprehensive of arrest, ran around the corner just in time to rush into the arms of a policeman.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dodger	But when the boat came in he just mixed in with the passengers, and came up to the entrance of the pier. Two boys asked to carry his valise, but he shook his head till [MASK] came round, and he engaged him right off."
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Florence	"Very well; I will call upon her and make inquiries. If you will call to-morrow morning, I can give you a decisive answer." [MASK] fervently hoped that this might prove favorable; but was apprehensive, and with good reason, it appeared.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dodger	The important point is, what are we to do with ourselves during the four or five months we must spend on shipboard?" "I don't know what I can do," said [MASK]. "I can't sell papers, and I can't smash baggage."
<name>Mr. Jaggers</name>	Mr. Jaggers	Linden	Young man, did you open my secretary?" "Yes, sir." "And robbed it into the bargain," continued [MASK], going to the secretary, and examining it. He did not, however, miss the will, but only the roll of bills.
<name>Indiana</name>	Indiana	Dodger	"Sometimes I think he is too daring. He is liable to get into trouble." "If he does he'll get himself out of it, never you fear. [MASK] can take care of himself."
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Jane	"It's a great shame--you, a lady born." "No, [MASK], I do not look upon it in that light. I shall be happier for having my mind and my hands occupied." "What work will you do?"
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dodger	Yes, but I'd likely be robbed; I had a bartender once who robbed me of two or three dollars a day." "But you trusted the boy?" "Yes, [MASK] wouldn't steal--I can say that much for him."
<name>Claude</name>	Claude	Curtis	He has always been kind to me till now." "Why, what's up? What's the old gentleman mad about?" "He wants me to marry my cousin [MASK]--a man I do not even like." "That's a shame!
<name>him</name>	him	Tim	"I understand that you have left [MASK] now?" "Yes." "Why, may I ask?" "Because I didn't like the business he was in. But I liked it better than the one he wanted me to go into."
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Curtis	"Yes, I am. Go ahead." [MASK] thrust his hand into the pockets of the boy, who, boy as he was, was as tall as himself, but was not repaid by the discovery of anything. He was very much perplexed.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Florence	"Yes, uncle," faltered [MASK]. "Then you can join the young person you have selected whenever you please. For your sake I will not have him arrested for attempted burglary. He is welcome to what he has taken, since he is likely to marry into the family.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Florence	"Nor on any other, I hope. As governess in my family, I think I have a right to command your services." "I will come," said [MASK], meekly. She felt that it would not do to refuse after this.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Dodger	He'll half murder me, I expect. He'll be sure to cut up rough." "Do right, [MASK], whatever happens. Promise me that you will never steal again?" "There's my hand, miss--I promise.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Dodger	"So he is," answered [MASK], who was not quite clear in his mind as to what a viper was. "I'd like to step on his necktie." "If it wasn't for him, my dear young mistress would be back in the house within twenty-four hours."
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Florence	" "I'm sure you'll suit. How nice you look!" [MASK] smiled, and looked pleased. She had taken pains with her dress and personal appearance, and, being luckily well provided with handsome dresses, had no difficulty in making herself presentable.
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Curtis	"I mean," replied [MASK], lamely, "that I have heard of this man Bolton. He keeps a saloon on the Bowery, doesn't he?" "Yes." "I thought you would be living with some such man.
<name>David</name>	David	Florence	"I'm too rough for that, [MASK]. I'm only an ignorant street boy." "You are not going to be an ignorant street boy all your life. I don't see why you should not grow up a polished gentleman."
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Dodger	"I think I would prefer to remain in the city." "Good! How is your education?" "I have never been to college," answered [MASK], with a smile. "Good! I don't care for your college men.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Dodger	"No. Tell him I will be ready to accompany him at once." She went out into the hall, and when the door was opened the visitor proved to be [MASK]. He had improved his appearance so far as his limited means would allow.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Florence	After a brief pause [MASK] seated herself at the table, and drew toward her writing materials. "It is I whose heart should be broken!" she murmured; "I who am driven from the only home I have ever known.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dodger	He's taken one of my apples, widout lave or license!' "Upon that, [MASK], brave as a lion, walked up to the man, and, says he: "'Give back that apple, or pay for it!'
<name>Mr. Utterson</name>	Mr. Utterson	Julius	After reading it, the young man looked up and said: "I'll go around to the door and inquire." He was as good as his word. He went to the outer door and rang the bell. [MASK] came to the door.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Florence	"How could she live?" asked [MASK], startled, for she knew very little of the starvation wages paid to toiling women. "She didn't live. She just faded away, and it's my belief the poor thing didn't get enough to eat.
<name>Mr. Bingley</name>	Mr. Bingley	Tucker	"Let me see," said [MASK], reflectively, "you are the ninth young man who has applied--but the place is still open." "Then I am afraid you won't want me, as you have rejected so many."
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dodger	[MASK], who was a strong, stout boy, gathered himself up and dashed against the ruffian with such impetuosity that he fell over his intended victim, and his bludgeon fell from his hand. It was the work of an instant to lift it, and raise it in a menacing position.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Florence	"I've been waitin' half an hour to see you, [MASK]," he said. "I've got some work for you." "What is it--sewing on a button, or mending a coat?" "No, I mean workin' for money.
<name>Rachel</name>	Rachel	Florence	You say he was instrumental in getting his Cousin [MASK] out of the house?" "Yes; he wanted to marry her." "And she would not consent?" "No; I think she hates him." "How old is she?"
<name>Morpheus</name>	Morpheus	Bolton	"Yes, [MASK], I have found my way here." "I have been expecting you." "I came to you for some information." "Well, ask your questions: I don't know whether I can answer them."
<name>He</name>	He	Dodger	Did he tell you?" [MASK] asked, after a pause. "No; he didn't say." "When is he coming here again?" "Said he'd come to-morrow most likely." "Will you bring me a light?"
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Dodger	"Don't know nothin' 'bout that, either. I'm actin' accordin' to orders." "Look here," said [MASK], bethinking himself of what had just happened. "Did you tell that young man who called here just now that I was crazy?"
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Florence	It isn't time for the evenin' papers yet, so I shall go 'round to the piers and see if I can't get a job at smashin' baggage." "But I shouldn't think any one would want to do that," said [MASK], puzzled.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Florence	But the idea of receiving in my house an inmate of a tenement house! I am truly shocked. Is this apple-woman your mother?" "I assure you that she is not," answered [MASK], with a smile which she could not repress.
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Curtis	"What has come over him?" [MASK] asked himself. "Some influence hostile to me has been brought to bear. It must be that nurse. I will quietly dismiss her to-morrow, paying her a week's wages, in lieu of warning.
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Linden	I haven't taken a cent." "Then why did you open the secretary?" "I did mean to take money, but she stopped me." "Oh, she stopped you?" repeated [MASK], with withering sarcasm. "
<name>he</name>	he	Curtis	When you've lived as long as I, you'll look at things different. Well, I'm glad to hear from the lad. If [MASK] had done him any harm, I'd have got even with him if it sent me to jail."
<name>Mr. Wopsle</name>	Mr. Wopsle	Dodger	"No fear of that, [MASK]. As long as I see that you are improving, I shall feel encouraged to go on." "I wish I knew as much as your other scholar." "You will in time if you go on.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tim	When the last drop was drunk, he breathed a deep sigh of measureless enjoyment. "If either of you bring that boy in here," said [MASK], "I'll stand a couple of glasses for both."
<name>Sherlock Holmes</name>	Sherlock Holmes	Florence	"No; I've asked him more'n once. He always says he's my father, and that makes me mad." "It is strange," said [MASK], thoughtfully. "I had a young cousin stolen many years ago."
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Florence	His hands and face were thoroughly clean; he had bought a new collar and necktie; his shoes were polished, and despite his shabby suit, he looked quite respectable. Getting a full view of him, [MASK] saw that his face was frank and handsome, his eyes bright, and his teeth like pearls.
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	Curtis	that is a young girl's extravagant nonsense." "No, uncle." "There can be no reason for such a foolish dislike. What can you have against him?" "It is impressed upon me, uncle, that [MASK] is a bad man.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Jane	She that was always brought up like a lady!" "She's teachin' a little girl three hours a day." "Well, that isn't so bad!" said [MASK], relieved. "Teachin' is genteel. I wish I could see her some day.
<name>Mr. Wopsle</name>	Mr. Wopsle	Tim	answered [MASK], crossly. "He hasn't left you, has he?" "Yes; he's cleared out, the ungrateful young imp! I'd like to lay my hands on the young rascal." "Was he your son?" "
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Curtis	[MASK] glanced angrily at his cousin's devoted friend, and then, turning on his heel, left the room. "I'll bring her to terms yet," he muttered. "No girl of seventeen shall defy me!"
<name>Becky</name>	Becky	Bouvier	[MASK] was to have charged ten dollars--"and you will be kind enough to come in your best attire. You seem to be well provided with dresses." "Yes, madam, there will be no difficulty on that score." "Nor on any other, I hope.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Florence	"I have not seen him since the night of the robbery." "If he has read the will, it may lead to dangerous suspicions." "He would give it to your cousin, [MASK], would he not?" "Perhaps so.
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Curtis	"You may be speaking the truth, or you may not. I will talk with you again to-morrow," and [MASK] arose from his chair. "You don't mean to keep me here?"
<name>Bonnie</name>	Bonnie	Florence	"I am sure you could," said [MASK], confidently. There was something in this boy, young outlaw though he was, that moved her powerfully, and even fascinated her, though she hardly realized it. It was something more than a feeling of compassion for a wayward and misguided youth.
<name>Miss Taylor</name>	Miss Taylor	Jane	"I shouldn't mind that so much, if that was the only objection." "It'll be a great deal better marryin' a young man." "I don't care to marry any one, [MASK]. I don't think I shall ever marry."
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Tim	As they left the saloon, the colonel turned to [MASK], and said: "I like whiskey, sir; but I'll be hanged if I can respect such men as those." "They're bums, colonel, that's what they are!"
<name>the man</name>	the man	Dodger	I will pay you well." "All right, sir," answered [MASK]. It was just the job he was seeking. "We will have to walk a few blocks, unless you want to take a carriage." "It isn't necessary.
<name>Sydney</name>	Sydney	Dodger	You are fit for something better." "Do you really think so?" asked [MASK], doubtfullly. "Yes; you have a good face. You were meant to be good and honest, I am sure." "Would you trust me?"
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Carrie	"Very well, indeed." "It must be an awful bore, I think." "I don't think so. [MASK] is a warm-hearted, affectionate girl. Besides, she is very bright and gives me very little trouble."
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Dodger	I had a girl in [MASK]'s room last year who used to sew for a livin'. Early and late she worked, poor thing, and she couldn't make but two dollars a week." "How could she live?"
<name>the doctor</name>	the doctor	Dodger	"Where am I?" asked the prostrate man, in a bewildered tone. "I will take care of him, if you will take charge of that fellow." "Can you get up, sir?" asked [MASK], bending over the fallen man.
<name>David</name>	David	Dodger	"You have not exaggerated your ignorance," he said to [MASK]. "You have a great deal to learn, but on the other hand you are quick, have a retentive memory, and are very anxious to learn. I shall make something of you."
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Jane	"Did she say where she was going, [MASK]?" he asked. "I don't think the poor child knew herself, sir." "Did she go alone?" "No, sir; the boy that was here last night called for her."
<name>the stranger</name>	the stranger	Dodger	he asked himself. At length they reached a wooden house of three stories, standing by itself, and here the stranger stopped. He rang the bell, and the door was opened by a hump-backed negro, who looked curiously at [MASK].
<name>Dr. Watson</name>	Dr. Watson	Dodger	The first step had already been taken; what the next was will soon appear. Scarcely had [MASK] failed in his attempt to obtain outside assistance when an unaccountable drowsiness overcame him, considerably to his surprise. "I don't know what's come to me," he said to himself.
<name>Melrose</name>	Melrose	Florence	"I have been expecting you." "I came to you for some information." "Well, ask your questions: I don't know whether I can answer them." "First, where is my Cousin [MASK]?" "How should I know?
<name>David</name>	David	Dodger	It was necessarily a slow process, but she began to find after a time that a gradual change was coming over him. "I want you to grow up a gentleman, [MASK]," she said to him one day.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Florence	"If her being here is to prolong my uncle's life, and keep me still waiting for the estate, I must clear the house of her." "You must not allow her to buoy you up with unfounded hopes. She has been telling you that [MASK] will soon return."
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Curtis	Her mother seemed to live again in her. Have I not acted cruelly in requiring her to obey me or leave the house?" "You have acted only for good. You are seeking her happiness." "You really think this, [MASK]?"
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dodger	"[MASK]!" he repeated. "How should I know? I supposed that you had lured him away from me." "He didn't like the business you were in. He preferred to make a living in some other way." "
<name>please</name>	please	Jane	No; she just walked." "But she took some clothing with her?" "She took a handbag--that is all. She will send for her trunk." "If you find out where she is living, just let me know, [MASK]."
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Dodger	That was not all. At the bottom of the valise was an envelope, sealed, on which was inscribed the name: "[MASK]." "That is for me, at any rate," thought our hero.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Bolton	What is your business, my man?" It was [MASK]'s turn to be embarrassed. "My business?" he repeated. "That is what I said." "I'm a blacksmith, but I'm willing to do any honest work."
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Florence	"You lodge with an apple-woman, do you not?" "I do," answered [MASK], calmly. "In a tenement house?" "Yes, madam." "And you actually come from such a squalid home to instruct my daughter!"
<name>Joad</name>	Joad	Dodger	"It doesn't take long to come back by cars, does it?" "No; but it costs a great deal of money. Why, it may take [MASK] a year to earn enough to pay his way back on the railroad."
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Florence	"To be thrown in the shade by a governess is really too humiliating!" she murmured to herself in vexation. "If it were a girl in my own station I should not care so much," and she eyed [MASK] with marked hostility.
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Bolton	"No. He goes up to his chamber directly after dinner." "How is he?" "I think he's failing." "I hope there is no immediate danger," said [MASK], anxiously. "
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Jane	"Did--did she leave a message for me?" he asked, slowly. "She asked me to bid you good-by for her," answered [MASK], quickly. "Uncle, don't let yourself be disturbed now with painful thoughts.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Percy	"At my residence." "Good Heavens!" exclaimed the scandalized lady. "Does my nephew [MASK] visit at the house of this apple-woman?" "No, madam. He does not know where I live."
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Florence	"I do mean it, and I shall not allow your tears to move me. Not another word, for I will not hear it. Take twenty-four hours to think over what I have said." [MASK] bowed her head on her hands, and gave herself up to sorrowful thoughts.
<name>Paddy</name>	Paddy	Dodger	"Wid that the man up with his fist and struck at [MASK], but he dodged the blow, and gave him one for himself wid his right. Just then up came a cop. "'What's all this?' says he.
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Dodger	He was a man of about the average height, probably not far from fifty, dressed in a neat business suit, and looked like a substantial merchant. "Please be seated." [MASK] sat down in an easy-chair conveniently near him.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Dodger	"No, I don't want to get him into trouble, or you either. Better tell me all, and I will be your friend." "You're a better sort than I thought at first," said [MASK].
<name>Scudder</name>	Scudder	Curtis	"Very well. I believe there is no more to be said. Good-night!" "Good-night, sir." "So he is well out of the way for five months!" soliloquized [MASK]. "In five months much may happen.
<name>he</name>	he	Tim	I couldn't pretend to remember them all." "Was [MASK] a relative of yours?" "I don't believe he was. I always thought that he got hold of me when I was a kid. I don't remember the time when I wasn't with him."
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Dodger	"I know that, but I ain't goin' to give in, and let a little gal get ahead of me!" "Keep to that determination, [MASK], and you will succeed in time, never fear."
<name>someone</name>	someone	Bolton	"I thought you had taken the will from my uncle's desk, but I am inclined to think you had nothing to do with it. If you know where it is, or whether [MASK] has it, I expect you to notify me in return for the money I have expended in your behalf.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Hooker	Could the boy have heard anything? he wondered, for his suspicions were very near the truth. "It's all nonsense!" he said, roughly. "Next time you see him, [MASK], foller him home, and find out where he lives."
<name>The woman</name>	The woman	Florence	He is about the same as ever. One thing would do more for him than anything else." "What's that?" "Your agreement to marry me," and he fixed his eyes upon her face eagerly. [MASK] shook her head.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Bolton	"Yes; I am the gentleman," remarked [MASK], coolly. "I am not in the habit of receiving visits from gentlemen of your class. However, I suppose you have an object in calling."
<name>the protagonist</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	the protagonist (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Dodger	"No." "There may be some tendency to disease in your system--some hereditary tendency," said the captain, after a pause. "Were your parents healthy?" "They--died young," answered [MASK], hesitatingly. "
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Dodger	"I suppose you don't want me any longer," said [MASK], preparing to resign the valise he was carrying, and which, by the way, was remarkably light considering the size. "Yes, I shall need you," said the other hurriedly.
<name>Mr. Bingley</name>	Mr. Bingley	Florence	" "I have no doubt of that," said [MASK], feeling very much relieved. "If I might be so bold, what kind of work are you going to do?" "I hardly know. It has come upon me so suddenly.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Florence	After completing the note, [MASK] let her head fall upon the table, and sobbed herself to sleep. An hour and a half passed, the servant looked in, but noticing that her mistress was sleeping, contented herself with lowering the gas, but refrained from waking her.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tim	On the sanded floor were set several tables, around which were seated a motley company, all of them with glasses of beer or whiskey before them. [MASK], with a white apron on, was moving about behind the bar, ministering to the wants of his patrons.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Dodger	It was clear that she was ill and in trouble. [MASK] possessed quick sympathies, and his own experience made him quick to understand and feel for the troubles of others. Though the woman made no appeal, he felt instinctively that she needed help.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Curtis	"Come, you'd better examine your pockets. In the hurry of the moment you may have taken it without knowing it." "No, I couldn't." "Didn't you take a paper of any kind?" asked [MASK], eagerly.
<name>she</name>	she	Florence	But it must be stopped!" she exclaimed, wildly. "He is my husband. I shall not give him up to any one else." "So far as [MASK] is concerned--she is the cousin--she has no wish to deprive you of him.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Florence	"That I will. If I don't, I'll give you leave to lick me." "I shan't forget that," said [MASK], amused. "I will buy a ruler of good hard wood, and then you must look out.
<name>Biddy</name>	Biddy	Dodger	She's very anxious to see her husband." "The more fool she. Kape her at home and out of his sight, or there's no knowin' what he'll do. And, [MASK], dear, kape an eye on the apple-stand.
