<name>Kunta</name>	Kunta	Fingers	He leaned against the wall and raised his hands again to the iron around his neck. With the tiredness, came a heaviness to his arms. [MASK] not quite touching it, he waited. I could take it off now, he thought. Stash it somewhere.
<name>the</name> (There is no proper name that fits in this context. The word "the" is the most appropriate option to fill in the [MASK] token.)	the (There is no proper name that fits in this context. The word "the" is the most appropriate option to fill in the [MASK] token.)	Gorgik	the High Court of Eagles . . . ,' and one black and sweaty-armed driver, whose beast was halted on the road with a cartwheel run into a ditch, wrestled and cursed his heavy-lidded charge as [MASK] walked past. '
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Gorgik	Do you see it?' 'See what . . . ? Oh, there, you mean?' 'But what is it?' Frowning, [MASK] turned over on the rug. 'A cat — at least that's what it looks like.'
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Udrog	'At the tent's front hanging, I pulled the flap a little aside to peer in. 'What I saw within that drab canvas, lit by the lamp on its low table, stays with a vividness I doubt I can convey to you, [MASK].
<name>Dracula</name>	Dracula	Vrach	'After a while, I said, again: "[MASK], he's making that sound. Again. You said . . . Perhaps you should come and look at him." 'He took a breath. "Very well. Perhaps I should."
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Clodon	And remember — ' The man yawned, then recovered, looking down into his cup — 'there’s nothing you need do really foreign to that nature you've already drawn for me in some detail.' [MASK] said: 'This is really something.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Clodon	that's all!' 'Am I supposed to say at this point,' she asked, a bit guardedly, ' "You know, [MASK], you really are a good man?”' She put her hands behind her now as they walked. '
<name>Baron</name>	Baron	Gorgik	He looked around. They were standing by the table end. 'And there is the door.' The Baron shrugged. 'Take the first two and use the last.' [MASK] took a breath which made the cloth of his tunic slide on his wet back.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Funig	Get out of here! Go look after your sister!’ And he thought: No. No, she couldn’t have the feet too . . . And he smiled. ([MASK], after a moment, lurched off around the building comer.)
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Clodon	He set them on a table. 'Now come. Let's have a drink. It will lighten all this heavy talk.' It was cider, not beer. And this time — perhaps it was the amount he'd already drunk — [MASK] didn't mind it.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Clodon	The lady there, she has to go. You know where it is?' The boy moved one foot on the dirt and scowled, as if debating with himself whether to say. 'Come on, now!' [MASK] said.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Clodon	Thinking he'd been found out, he tried to look sheepish. 'I'm a good deal closer to thirty than I am to twenty — and from the wrong direction, too. At least if you're in my line of work.' [MASK] was startled.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Clodon	And [MASK] realized how much the water's roar had subsided. The last time she'd spoken, he hadn't been able to hear her. 'Isn't this incredible?' she said, a few steps further. She'd said it several times before.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Clodon	This, he knew, was the one he should remember Was it dawn? Was it evening? The older man stood, holding back the hanging, half in and half out of the shack and growling at [MASK]: 'He's a pig, I tell you!
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Clodon	Certainly the first woman whose hands had held his silent, if never-articulated, attention had been his cousin the bailiffs wife. She'd been a shy, dark, gentle thing — and often ill. [MASK] had been an intractable boy.
<name>he</name>	he	Gorgik	For moments, he was dizzy. The shock was as intense as heat or cold. When his vision cleared, the next thing [MASK] saw were the scars. They were thick as his fingers and wormed around the boy’s soiled flanks.
<name>the Empress</name>	the Empress	Myrgot	'But -' 'You came to court with the favor of the Vizerine. Everyone knows — or thinks they know — that such favor from [MASK] is only favor of the flesh, which they can gossip about, find amusing, and therefore tolerate.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Clodon	Ten years later he was living with two other criminals. The younger one had even more flogging marks than [MASK], a lazy, foul-tempered boy, who, for all his complaining, hated above all things to be alone.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Clodon	You know, I was once as lean a boy as you.’ 'What's honest about you, you old thief?' [MASK]'s water hit the bark, dribbled to the dirt, to separate in dusty worms that crawled beside the roots to run away between his bare feet.
<name>Cleopatra</name>	Cleopatra	Jahor	There will be people at this funeral I shall probably never have another chance to see in my life. Besides, I wouldn't miss it for the world!' Well, perhaps . . . said the servants. Would she require her eunuch to accompany her? '[MASK]?
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Clodon	We just can't let them stay around a moment more than necessary.' Under the assault of the stench, the echoes, and the drink, [MASK] saw movement now on all the tables. Shadows shifted and drifted between . . . 'This way.'
<name>He</name>	He	Clodon	He told me to ask you,' she repeated. 'Don't worry. He's all right.' 'What does he want to do?' [MASK] asked. Though there was no one near them, she stepped closer and began to talk more softly.
<name>taboo</name>	taboo	Namyuk	But though I'd snickered to myself over leu-Forsi's violation of [MASK], I was wholly surprised at the sudden knowledge of this shared perversion that, tonight, we would not share. ' "Now," he said, "let's go see how our man is doing."
<name>Zarathustra</name>	Zarathustra	Udrog	Once you left the living quarters here, it was about half a mile away." ' "You mean the place where they're going to have the ceremony . . . ?" She was a barbarian, like you, [MASK]. But her skin was burned so brown
<name>Conan</name>	Conan	Clodon	'Why don't you go?' [MASK] asked. The barbarian ran a hand through his bronze hair and grinned over a gap in his teeth. 'I'm the wrong color. He doesn't want fellows who look like me. He wants respectable looking drivers.
<name>Cixi</name>	Cixi	Curly	Ws. She said she was kept there as a girl before she was Empress. [MASK] told me later about when the two of them were in prison —' 'I know all about that time. I was in a cell only two away from theirs.
<name>John</name>	John	Clodon	They're dead people in here?' [MASK] asked. 'With us?' 'Some dead,' the man said, a step ahead. 'Some very much alive.' At which point a shadow moved toward them from the man's right.
<name>him</name>	him	Clodon	Imrog the smith's apprentice had done that one but had said nothing when everyone in the village thought it was [MASK]. As well, there were various assaults on various youngsters — all infractions that, till then, he'd felt supremely smug about having gotten away with.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Clodon	Could it be that just by sitting here he would meet them all? The man had said women dwelled here, too ... ? Might one of the inhabitants, [MASK] wondered, be a strong, young, dark-eyed creature with beautiful feet and cunning hands?
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Clodon	So you have to make it worth —' Well, we're going to try and find some things you do like.' With a hand on [MASK]’s shoulder, the man moved him between the poles and into the street, laughing loudly — to cover the bumptious remarks.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Clodon	The thing is, I really have known a fair number of your sort. If it's what you want to hear, and will make you happier for the day, I suppose I can say it.' 'Me?' [MASK] said. '
<name>Mrs. Moore</name>	Mrs. Moore	Har'Ortrin	I told them: "Let's sit and talk." 'The five of us went and sat. It all began very well. ' "Yes, that's right, sir. [MASK] told me where she'd pointed out the old barracks to you.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Clodon	Was that what began it — between the younger and the older? Though [MASK] had shouted too. Still, mostly, while they'd argued he'd been looking for more beer. There was a lot of yelling — Oh, certainly the younger one began it.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Clodon	Not really. Who ever gets close enough for that . . . ? I don't really think I'd want to.' Then she asked: 'Did you?' Wait here a minute.' [MASK] pushed off into the underbrush beside the road.
<name>Salman</name>	Salman	Clodon	It had not been a happy life. In a village by low scrub, set among tangled ravines that flattened into desert, [MASK] had spent a childhood in which he'd been mostly hungry or angry. Often he said (not that it was true)
<name>Alec</name>	Alec	Myrgot	If you can remember it word for word, so much the better.' 'She said she had heard of me. And that she would not have me put out of the party because my clothes were poor —' [MASK] grunted. 'Well, it's true.
<name>Red</name>	Red	Clodon	[MASK] stuck a thumb beneath his own leather clout to tug it up a bit. Well, you need all the men you can get. Especially those who know this kind of work. You said that, yourself. This is quite a job — you're coming along well, too!'
<name>Jacob</name>	Jacob	Venn	Down there.' He pointed through the country alley. When it splits, you go that way,' which was a jerk of his head to the left. 'Puts you right out at the bottom of [MASK]'s Stair.’ 'And that's it?'
<name>Morgoth</name>	Morgoth	Venn	Ahead, they could see it rise, in several sets of steps, at some places even cut into the wall to form a corridor with a ceiling and sided by squat stone columns. 'That must be what they call [MASK]'s Stair,' she said.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Gorgik	When he returned in the lowering light an hour on, the boy was gone from the wall. Seconds later, [MASK] saw him, on the other side of the yard, by one of the buildings, curled up with his back against the sandstone, asleep.
<name>Gorgik</name>	Gorgik	Vrach	'I've thought about it often. It might even make a better story — another mummer’s tale — to say it was my anger, my rage at [MASK]'s murder that spurred me to freedom, to my own liberation, to the liber- ation of all Neveryon's slaves.
<name>Kunta</name>	Kunta	Jahor	Oh . . . ,' the slave grunted. 'You again?' 'Come with me,' [MASK] said. 'She wants you now.' The reddened eyes narrowed; the slave pushed up on one great arm. His dark face crinkled around its scar.
<name>something</name> (There is no proper name in the given sentence)	something (There is no proper name in the given sentence)	Udrog	'I'm talking, understand, [MASK], of an incident almost wholly outside the chain of language that holds us to the social world, as far outside those chains as a true, observed, and social incident can be.
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Clodon	But no one wanted to come with him. That night, [MASK] crawled from under the straw and the old leather robe he'd been sleeping in, blinked at a sliver of moon caught in cloud and branches, then started for the road.
<name>he</name>	he	Clodon	'If you want to do anything — ' Walking out, [MASK] spoke too loudly, searching for the belligerence he was sure he must feel at the renewed prospect of unwanted intimacy, though its absence seemed to be the most annoying thing about the situation — 'you still have to give me some money.
<name>Arnold</name>	Arnold	Clodon	He was no longer a lean-hipped youth. But he was not yet a fat man. In his first day, walking through the town, [MASK] looked for things he might steal that would not be missed.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Clodon	'You stay here —' [MASK] said, suddenly, and hurried off after him. Hey -!' The boy kept walking. 'Hey, you hear me talking to you?' The boy glanced back, but kept going. 'Here, stop up a minute!
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Gorgik	Still, minutes at a time, [MASK] could entertain the notion that the only difference between then and now was that — now — he was a little sicker, a little lonelier, and was in a situation where he had been forced, for reasons that baffled him, to pretend to be well and happy.
<name>Lady Bracknell</name>	Lady Bracknell	Inige	A young duchess, who had been standing only a few feet away, turned to [MASK]. Do you know, if I'm not mistaken, I believe I just saw your inelegantly dressed companion, who, only a moment ago, was conferring with Her Highness, do the strangest thing —' '
<name>he</name>	he	Clodon	'Oh, it's very much for the living.' The man chuckled. The echo made the space sound vast. Since he could see nothing ahead and down save the light over the man's arm and the glow edging his ear, [MASK] looked up.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Funig	Sometimes he said it hurt him. 'If you get drunk again,' [MASK] said, who wasn't sure if he were nineteen, twenty, or twenty-one, 7 won't come to wake you any more. You're dirty when you're drunk.
<name>Lord Henry</name>	Lord Henry	Jahor	It was only when I was unexpectedly deprived of the information that I learned how used I was to receiving it from my other noble guests; and how much more than pleasures of the flesh or the intellect I desired it. ' 'Where is [MASK]?"
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Clodon	But that's how I always come in. It's nothing to do with you personally.' He pushed aside the leather hanging. [MASK] ducked after him into a wooden vestibule where several lamps, two burning and three out, stood on a stained wooden shelf. '
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Clodon	Not that it made any difference. For a while he sat on the ground, his back against the cistern. Did he doze a bit? Finally, growing truly tired, [MASK] went over by one of the buildings, lay down, and slept for a few hours.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Teren	But [MASK] pulled him forward once more. 'Do you hear what I'm saying? There's the path down to the highway. You keep on it. There's nobody in this town you need to say another word to.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Funig	'That's just what I’ll say to him!' [MASK]'s lurch took his head away and back, away and back. They turned beside the bark fence, beyond which stood the first inhabited shacks. 'See if I don't.
<name>Black Dog</name>	Black Dog	Vrach	That is, if you can beat me . . . ?" [MASK] was one of some half-dozen miners whom I'd already decided that, because of their strength (or because they were simply half-mad), I would never fight.
<name>Aslan</name>	Aslan	Jahor	The boy whom [MASK] guided before him into the clearing limped a few steps forward, then turned his face up in the light drizzle, that had begun minutes back, opening and closing his mouth as if around a recently forgotten word.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Myrgot	At least two meals out of every three were spent with some ambassador, governor, or petitioner, if not at some affair of state. To do her credit, in that first month, we can thus account for all twenty-two evening meals [MASK] did not share with her slave.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Gorgik	[MASK]'s main interest in the encounter was the story it would make at the next night's supper of gruel and cold pig fat, though that interest was somewhat tempered by the prospect of the ten-hour workday with no sleep to come.
<name>Conan</name>	Conan	Gorgik	Or had the barbarian — far more likely — already run off? [MASK] put his hand on his chest and slid it to his shoulder. Moving his thumb against his neck, he frowned. Then, on the rug, he sat up fully, looking to see where the collar had fallen.
<name>he</name>	he	Clodon	The masculinity [MASK] treasured and that, yes, he would admit it, seemed so subtly compromised by the homosexual encounters that, despite his basic inclination, from time to time necessity forced him to take part in, at first seemed easier to secure by showing no sign at all.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Clodon	I don't do that. You tell him I don't do that.' 'Why not?' she said. Hell pay you good.' 'No,' [MASK] said. Then he said, 'No, don't tell him . . .
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Clodon	8. But while [MASK] smiled, he thought — indeed, for the first time, in a while — about the hare-lipped girl he'd brutalized again and again at home. She had had such eyes! They returned to him with astonishing shock.
<name>Stoney</name>	Stoney	Babara	The balls were small enough for a big man to hide one in his fist and made of some barely pliable blackish matter that juvenile dissection revealed hid a knucklesized bubble. With the balls came the rhyme that you bounced to on the stone flags around the neighborhood cistern: I went out to [MASK]'s Pit
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Anuron	The key still in one, both hands again on his knees, he looked up at [MASK]. When he spoke, a tremor touched his voice that made my flesh glitter, as the tingles already about my neck, free of iron for the first time in a year, went on down my body.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Clodon	I'm the wrong color. He doesn't want fellows who look like me. He wants respectable looking drivers. You'll get the job — if you wash and wear a shirt.' [MASK] did neither. But he did stroll down to look for the merchant.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Clodon	But he said, 'Ha!' Did the man, he asked, want to go somewhere and have sex? 'No. At least not now. Maybe another time —' [MASK] grunted and looked away. 'People tell me that a lot.'
<name>Dany</name>	Dany	Jahor	She watched the women in red scarves go off among other tents. '[MASK] . . . ?' The eunuch with the large nose stepped from behind her, tur-baned and breeched in blue wool. 'I have dismissed my maids for the night.
<name>Indiana</name>	Indiana	Clodon	she said, 'that's something, somewhere in your travels, you've actually learned. It's very valuable knowledge, too.' [MASK] drew himself up. 'Still,' he said, 'you're asking a lot of a man like me.'
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Udrog	For many years later, when I — ’ But [MASK], about to protest that this was not the particular type of torture he'd had in mind for the evening, pushed suddenly to his knees, pointed off from the rug, and cried out: 'What’s that?'
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Clodon	Some say they're only waiting to make him a minister.' 'Now if I said that in the tavern — ’ [MASK] spat — 'they'd only think it was more lies and rumors and gossip — and pay it no mind.'
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Clodon	You can't just go like that — Why not?' [MASK] pushed the older man back against the jamb, realizing as he did so that this was the first he was sure that the boy was, this time, dead. It's your mess!'
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Funig	He pushed himself up to a squat with burning bladder, then crawled from under the lean-to thatch, standing and narrowing his eyes against bright convercast. 'Was I drunk again last night, [MASK] — no, more's the pity. I wasn't!
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Clodon	You thought it was lust? No. And where does desire fit in the tale we've so far told? You must read it, as it grew and developed for [MASK] to the point we've recounted, down the margin of every page we've written.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Gorgik	She had agreed to take him with her; and had kept her agreement. But the relationship was of a volatile and explosive sort that made her, from time to time, look back with fondness on the weeks with [MASK].
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Clodon	Jamb and lintel were heavy beams set in yellowish stone — gone gray-blue in evening. 'My family has its business on the ground floor,' the man responded to [MASK]'s questioning glance. 'We live upstairs. This is the back entrance, of course.
<name>Douglass</name>	Douglass	Clodon	([MASK] hadn't till now. It made it all seem odder.) 'It's how I think we all know he's sincere. But all his rebellion came only once he managed to get free: no, he avoided flogging while he was in servitude.
<name>Hadrian</name>	Hadrian	Gorgik	[MASK] had at least ascertained that his new and precarious position meant keeping silent. The caravan steward put him to work grooming oxen by day — which he liked. The next night he spent in the Vizerine's tent.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Clodon	The boy was standing and staring. Well, they could go down a little ways above and catch the same big path — if it was the one [MASK], now, was sure it was. 'Come on.' He started again. She walked with him.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Vrach	'In his fur-edged cloak, the tall lord walked out to join them. [MASK]'s moan came from among them. I couldn't hear what they were saying, but from their whispers and consultations, they were talking about the fallen miner.
<name>The man</name> (The [MASK] refers to the same person who is speaking in the previous sentence)	The man (The [MASK] refers to the same person who is speaking in the previous sentence)	Clodon	The man said: 'I don't do the usual either. That's why I asked you. What do you say. How much?' [MASK] considered a moment. Then he said. 'No. I don't feel like it. Forget it.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Clodon	The boy looked up, saw him, and nodded, grinning. [MASK] walked between dug-up piles of earth to step over the handles of a wooden barrow, turned with its wheels in the air. 1 see you finally got him to bend his back!'
<name>Miss Ivors</name>	Miss Ivors	Jahor	The lamp flared. She replaced the cmet on the low table. 'Oh, [MASK], there must be someone there . . . you know what I like. Really, our tastes are not that different. Try again. Bring someone else.'
<name>Proximo</name>	Proximo	Vrach	' "Are you ready to wrestle for your freedom, [MASK]?" ' "My Lord . . . ?" ' "You heard me. A fair fight to a single fall — yes, between you and me. How do you like that?
<name>She</name>	She	Har'Ortrin	'How could the tall lord not have known ours? 'The three slaves had begun to talk of their coming freedom, where they would go, what they would do. [MASK] had free family in the south, who she was sure would take her in.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Clodon	Seven days from now I'll put it on again — if I still want to. Maybe that time I can get his purse. But [MASK] had a purse already. The man had given it to him. It was tucked under the leather he wore at his waist now.
<name>Leopold</name>	Leopold	Clodon	[MASK] went over to the oak to pee. 'How did I get this fat, Funig? You know, I was once as lean a boy as you.’ 'What's honest about you, you old thief?'
<name>John</name>	John	Jahor	With his scarred and puggish face and dirt-stiffened hair he was no one's handsome. But he was animally strong, of a piece, and had enough pit dirt ground into him to satisfy anyone's nostalgie de h boue, thought [MASK] as the foreman lumbered off back to his own sleeping quarters.
<name>Curley's</name>	Curley's	Krator	Then he swung left and stalked into the grass, to step the blades with one foot down on top of the other, rubbing them back and forth, wiping his right foot, then his left, free of [MASK]'s slop. Those eyes, he thought.
<name>Emmett</name>	Emmett	Clodon	But when the man brushed the leaves away and turned back the cloth, [MASK] looked down at a bloated, black face, with some sort of metal band across the forehead. Drool wet the chin. Under the shroud the chest swelled toward the barrel belly.
<name>Aragorn</name>	Aragorn	Clodon	And this shadow before them was another man — a big one, too. Was that a weapon at his side? The guard moved away first one plank, then another for them. At the top of the dim steps [MASK] could see light . . .
<name>Uncle Tom</name>	Uncle Tom	Namyuk	As we talked more and more easily, I began to wonder Though I'd never thought much about it, I'd just assumed the conversation with the tall lord that night thirty years ago had been the first he'd ever had with slaves such as [MASK] and I.
<name>Gorgik</name>	Gorgik	Udrog	We need no more detail how, by age fourteen, [MASK] had learned that the root of his passions thrust directly through what was, after all, one of the more common perversions in a Neveryon so recently awakened from a troubling dream of slaves.
<name>Louise</name>	Louise	Curly	'The Empress is perfectly charming,' [MASK] went on as they walked. 'The Empress is more charming than I've ever seen her before. Really, she is the most charming person in the entire court . . .'
<name>Don Giovanni</name>	Don Giovanni	Clodon	Though we have written of [MASK]'s encounters with lust, what we have not written of here is the shifting emotional calculus in which the appetite was embedded. Whatever sort of bedmate he might have been — and we have said he was a considerate one — he was certainly no good lover.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Feyev	Maybe you could help me some. I mean, afterwards. With some money." ' "Tell me," I said. "Do you like doing it? That way, I mean?" '[MASK] shrugged again. "I don't mind."
<name>him</name>	him	Gorgik	The Vizerine was silent long enough for [MASK] to suspect she disapproved of his request. 'Of course you're right,' she said at last, so that he was surprised and relieved. 'No, you can't stay on here. Especially after last night.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Clodon	But in the evenings between, there was sex — with a woman about ten years older than he, who lived in a hovel at the town’s edge: she was not pretty and was a little crazy. [MASK] would visit her with a jug of beer.
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Gorgik	no, that is a tasteless joke. Forgive me.' 'There is nothing to forgive, My Lady,’ though [MASK]'s heart had suddenly started. While it slowed, he ventured: 'Any post you can put me to, I would happily fill.'
