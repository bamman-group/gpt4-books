<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Freddie	But not every robber was logical, he thought, maybe especially an Italian robber. And not every murderer was logical, either. His mind drifted back to the conversation with [MASK]. ‘... an Italian fellow. Just a young kid... ’
<name>He</name>	He	Tom	He left a message that he was not in to anybody except the police, and that they were to let nobody up to see him. Positively no one. After that the telephone did not ring all afternoon. At about eight, when it was dark, [MASK] went downstairs to buy the evening papers.
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Tom	In the water? It was slightly cloudy, though not cold. [MASK] racked his brain. It would be easy in the hotel room, too, but how would he get rid of the body? The body had to disappear, absolutely.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Tom	When the druggist had looked at him suspiciously the second time he had been there, [MASK] had said that he was waiting for a call from his girl friend. Last Friday when he had answered the telephone, a man’s voice had said, ‘You know what we’re talking about, don’t you?
<name>James</name>	James	Tom	I can forge a signature, fly a helicopter, handle dice, impersonate practically anybody, cook - and do a one-man show in a nightclub in case the regular entertainer’s sick. Shall I go on?’ [MASK] was leaning forward, counting them off on his fingers.
<name>Ossipon</name>	Ossipon	Tom	The younger policeman saluted him as he went out, and [MASK] gave him a nod and closed the door. He could have flown - like a bird, out of the window, with spread arms! The idiots! All around the thing and never guessing it!
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Marge	But it was nothing really to worry about, he thought, even if the same police officer were to come back. He showed [MASK] the front entrance of the house, with its broad stone steps. The tide was low and four steps were bared now, the lower two covered with thick wet moss.
<name>Levin</name>	Levin	Greenleaf	‘The mystery is,’ the officer was quoted, ‘not only who the forger was but how he gained access to the letter, because the porter of the hotel remembers putting the registered bank letter into [MASK]’s hands.
<name>Wolfe</name>	Wolfe	Freddie	‘Oh, just because he had some drinks with [MASK] that day. You saw the papers, didn’t you? The papers make it ten times more important than it was for the simple reason that the dopes haven’t got any clues at all about anything.’
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Tom	He said he didn’t know, but something might.’ [MASK] paused deliberately. ‘He didn’t seem more depressed at that particular moment than a lot of other times I’d talked to him, so it didn’t cross my mind that he was going to kill himself.
<name>James</name>	James	Tom	We’re going to start in about fifteen minutes.’ [MASK] sat up politely in his chair. ‘Thank you very much, but I think I prefer to stay outside. Besides, I’m not too good at bridge.’ ‘Oh, neither are we!
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Anna	He took a silver cigarette box, which he had bought only two days ago and had had initialled, from the living-room table and put it in the bottom drawer of a chest in the dining-room. [MASK] was in the kitchen, preparing lunch.
<name>Reardon</name>	Reardon	Tom	But maybe it meant that something had happened on the Miles case, too, [MASK] thought. The Italians didn’t summon an American in words like these. That last paragraph was a plain threat. And of course they knew about the forged cheque by now.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Tom	[MASK] followed him toward the door. ‘You know, your father’s very concerned about your coming home. He asked me to give you a good talking to, which of course I won’t, but I’ll still have to tell him something.
<name>John</name>	John	Tom	In particular, the remittances ofjanuary and February?’ ‘I saw him sign one of them,’ [MASK] said. ‘But I am afraid it was in December. I was not with him in January and February.
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Tom	[MASK] turned and yanked at the rope frenziedly, until he realized that he was only making it tighter. His cigarette lighter. He fumbled for it in the pocket of his trousers on the bottom of the boat. He lighted it, then held a dry portion of the rope over its flame.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Tom	He blamed her. [MASK] took a sip of his martini, looked up at the ceiling, and thought that in another few months his nerves, his patience, would be able to bear even people like this, if he ever found himself with people like this again.
<name>John</name>	John	Tom	‘I am sorry, but we still must expect you to be in reach for the next couple of days,’ he repeated quietly, as if there were no question of [MASK]’s arguing about it, even if he was an American.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Dickie	[MASK] came out and poured himself a cocktail from the pitcher on the table. He wore badly ironed white duck trousers and a terra cotta linen shirt the colour of his skin. ‘Sorry there’s no ice. I haven’t got a refrigerator.’
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Dickie	The upstairs was disappointing: [MASK]’s bedroom in the comer of the house above the terrace was stark and empty - a bed, a chest of drawers, and a rocking chair, looking lost and unrelated in all the space - a narrow bed, too, hardly wider than a single bed.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Tom	At least half a dozen of the guests he had been presented to were counts and countesses. An American informed [MASK] that the young man and the girl who had invited him were going to be married, and that her parents were not enthusiastic.
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Dickie	‘I think your father said he was going to write you about me.’ ‘Oh, yes!’ [MASK] said, touching his forehead as if it was stupid of him to have forgotten. He stood up. ‘
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Fausto	He always made gestures when he spoke Italian, graceful gestures as if he were leading an orchestra in a legato. ‘You’d better listen to [MASK] more and read that grammar less. I picked my Italian up off the streets.’
<name>Venice</name>	Venice	Capri	He marked both envelopes ‘Urgentissimo’, went downstairs and bought stamps from the porter and posted them. Then he went out for a walk. His desire to go to [MASK] had vanished. It was four-fifteen in the afternoon. He kept walking, aimlessly.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Dickie	It seems the boat was missed on the day or around the day [MASK] and I were there, and we’d taken a ride in the same kind of boat. They were the little motor-boats people rented there.
<name>McEwan's</name>	McEwan's	Angelo	‘Oh, all right. [MASK]’s?’ ‘You can’t miss it. On the street straight in front of the hoteL Bye-bye.’ He whirled around to finish his packing. He really was finished except for the coats in the closet.
<name>He</name>	He	Tom	Now and then he caught glimpses of little villages down at the water’s edge, houses like white crumbs of bread, specks that were the heads of people swimming near the shore. [MASK] saw a bouldersized rock in the middle of the road that had evidently broken off a cliff.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Tom	He had signed three remittances, beginning in December. Were they going to go back and check on all his signatures now? Would an expert be able to tell that all three signatures were forged? [MASK] went upstairs and immediately sat down at the typewriter.
<name>Elvira</name>	Elvira	Freddie	For the benefit of the police, he wanted to look as if he was not too upset by the news of [MASK]’s death to do a little painting while he waited for them, though he was dressed to go out, because he had said he intended to go out.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Tom	The Italian police just might not be that interested. Might, might, might not. [MASK] folded up his papers, paid his check, and went out. He asked at the hotel desk if there were any messages for him. ‘Si, signor.
<name>Bloom</name>	Bloom	Dickie	He slid [MASK]’s top drawer out: letters, two address books, a couple of little notebooks, a watchchain, loose keys, and some kind of insurance policy. He slid the other drawers out, one by one, and left them open.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Tom	‘I shall tell them,’ the officer said mildly, and spoke into the telephone again. Now he was arranging for the Rome police to come to him. Being an American citizen still commanded certain privileges, [MASK] supposed. ‘At what hotel are you staying?’
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Tom	Will eleven o’clock this morning be convenient?’ ‘I’ll be very glad to help if I can,’ [MASK] said in a properly excited voice, ‘but can’t the interrogator come now? It is necessary for me to leave the house at ten o’clock.’
<name>She</name>	She	Marge	I’ll write the address down for you.’ ‘That’s a good idea. He doesn’t like me, does he?’ [MASK] smiled a little. ‘Well, frankly, no. I think he’s a little hard on you, considering.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Tom	... If you really didn’t know that I had been by your hotel, that only means that [MASK] didn’t tell you, which leaves the same conclusion to be drawn. It’s pretty obvious now that you’re running out and can’t face me.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Freddie	He opened the door with his left hand. His right hand with the ashtray was drawn back and down. [MASK] came into the room. ‘Listen, would you mind telling—’ The curved edge of the ashtray hit the middle of his forehead.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Marge	After a look at himself in the mirror he decided to shave first, and he went back to the room to get his electric razor which he had removed from the bathroom, for no particular reason, when [MASK] arrived. On the way back he heard the telephone ring.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Tom	[MASK] expected the police to come knocking on his door at any hour of the day or night. The contrast between his tranquil self-confidence of five days ago and his present apprehension almost tore him apart. He could neither sleep nor eat nor sit still.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Tom	There were no police waiting for him on the dock, anyway. [MASK] looked for them. He bought a couple of newspapers, then took a taxi with his luggage to the Hotel Palma. There were no police in the hotel lobby, either.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Marge	He wanted to make coffee and wake [MASK] up, so he would have someone to talk to, but he couldn’t face going into that room and seeing the underwear and garter belts strewn all over the place, he absolutely couldn’t.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Dickie	He had an impulse to go back, not necessarily to go back to the Italian, but to leave [MASK]. Then his tension snapped suddenly. His shoulders relaxed, aching, and his breath began to come fast, through his mouth.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Freddie	The arm was too tired even to circle [MASK]’s body. He set his teeth harder and staggered down the four front steps, banging his hip against the stone newel post. A man approaching him on the sidewalk slowed his steps as if he were going to stop, but he went on.
<name>James</name>	James	Tom	[MASK] made a batch of martinis, and arranged the glasses and a plate of canapes on a tray in the living-room. When he heard the door knocker, he went to the door and swung it open.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Tom	He’s very upset — naturally.’ She sat down on the sofa. [MASK] settled himself in a chair opposite her. ‘Have they found anything new? One of the police officers there has been keeping me posted, but he hasn’t told me anything that really matters.’
<name>James</name>	James	Tom	I think she’d prefer it, and after all I owe something to her, a pleasant holiday at least. You don’t seem to be too enthusiastic about ski-ing.’ [MASK] went rigid and cold, but he tried not to move a muscle.
<name>He</name>	He	Tom	His mind seemed blocked as to how to get rid of the boat. Now he could see pine trees, a dry empty-looking stretch of tan beach and the green fuzz of a field of olive trees. [MASK] cruised slowly to right and left of the place, looking for people.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Marge	‘A year. All last winter, and it was quite a winter. Rain every day except one for three whole months!’ ‘Really!’ ‘Um-hm.’ [MASK] sipped her martini and gazed out contentedly at her litde village.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Dickie	Some mornings were like that, and then the evening papers would have something about them again, even if there was no real news to report, just by way of reminding people that [MASK] was still missing and the Miles murder was still unsolved.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Paul	It was a sunless day, and the city on their right was already like some grey, distant land that he might be looking at from mid-ocean -except for those bastards inside his stateroom. ‘Where’ve you been keeping yourself?’ [MASK] asked.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Tom	‘She said we were the nicest Americans she’d ever met!’ ‘You know what most crummy Americans would do in a case like that — rape her,’ [MASK] said. ‘Now where are we?’
<name>He</name>	He	Tom	He was not too drunk to drive or I would have gone with him.’ The officer asked another question that [MASK] pretended not quite to grasp. The officer asked it a second time, choosing different words, and exchanged a smile with the younger officer.
<name>Stonor</name>	Stonor	Dickie	He went to a window and looked out, looking automatically for [MASK]’s big house and projecting terrace among the pink and white houses that dotted the climbing ground in front of him. He found the sturdy reddish balustrade of the terrace.
<name>He</name>	He	Tom	‘Just about an hour ago. I’ve just parked my suitcases at the post office.’ He laughed. ‘Don’t you want to sit down? Here’s another towel.’ She spread a smaller white towel beside her on the sand. [MASK] accepted it gratefully.
<name>Raffles</name>	Raffles	Tom	[MASK] turned suddenly and ran up a narrow, ladderlike flight of stairs. At the top of it he was confronted by a cabin class only sign hanging from a chain, but he threw a leg over the chain and stepped on to the deck.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Marge	He glanced around to see if he could climb in anywhere, but he couldn’t even reach a window ledge from the steps. Before he even said anything, [MASK] burst out laughing. ‘You didn’t bring the key!
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Marge	It wasn’t good in his opinion, probably in anybody’s opinion. The wild enthusiasm of her smile was a bit off. Her skin was as red as an Indian’s. If [MASK] hadn’t been the only girl around with blonde hair, he wouldn’t have noticed any resemblance at all.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Dickie	[MASK] was kissing her, little pecks on her cheek, smiling at her. They were only about fifteen feet from him, but the room was shadowed compared to the bright sunlight he stood in, and he had to strain to see.
<name>Carlo</name>	Carlo	Dickie	‘I know a good place for lunch,’ [MASK] said. ‘A real Neapolitan pizzeria. Do you like pizza?’ ‘Yes.’ The pizzeria was up a street too narrow and steep for cars.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Tom	The Italian took them to the nearest landing at the steps of the Santa Maria della Salute church. He refused to take any money for his trouble, but he accepted the rest of [MASK]’s pack of American cigarettes.
<name>Francis</name>	Francis	Tom	The sun had enervated [MASK]. The muscles of his legs trembled on the level stretches. His shoulders were already pink, and he had put on his shirt against the sun’s rays, but he could feel the sun burning through his hair, making him dizzy and nauseous.
<name>She</name>	She	Dickie	‘Have they any concrete clues at all that would make them think [MASK] killed him?’ ‘Of course not!’ ‘Then why don’t the so-and-so’s get down to the business of finding out who really did kill him?
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Tom	The tenente studied the picture closely, while [MASK] assumed the faintly anxious expression, the faintly parted lips, of the passport photograph. The glasses were missing from the photograph, but his hair was parted in the same manner, and his tie was tied in the same loose, triangular knot.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Dickie	Both bore [MASK]’s initials. He had thrown the shabbier of his own two suitcases away, and the remaining one he kept in a closet of his apartment, full of his own clothes, in case of an emergency.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Tom	Why in hell hadn’t he put the rings somewhere else, like in the lining of that suitcase? ‘I don’t really know,’ [MASK] said. ‘A whim or something. You know how he is.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Dickie	[MASK] was lucky. What was he himself doing at twenty-five? Living from week to week. No bank account. Dodging cops now for the first time in his life. He had a talent for mathematics. Why in hell didn’t they pay him for it, somewhere?
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Tom	I put them away so they wouldn’t get lost and I never thought of looking at them since the day he gave them to me.’ ‘He either killed himself or changed his identity - didn’t he?’ ‘Yes.’ [MASK] said it sadly and firmly.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Tom	[MASK] said it might take fifteen minutes or more, and she would probably catch a cold there, so she finally got in. The Italian took them to the nearest landing at the steps of the Santa Maria della Salute church.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Dickie	He felt afraid, but it was not of the water, it was of [MASK]. He knew that he was going to do it, that he would not stop himself now, maybe couldn’t stop himself, and that he might not succeed.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Tom	‘Oh, that’s fine,’ she said. ‘Oh, that doesn’t matter if we don’t.... Yes, I’ll tell him.... All right, we’ll hurry. [MASK]’s just washing up.... Oh, less than an hour.
<name>People</name>	People	Policemen	‘I don’t know what the trouble is, but when I saw in the papers that I am believed missing—’ It was all dreary, dreary, just as he had anticipated. [MASK] standing around blank-faced, staring at him.
<name>Donal</name>	Donal	Tom	Out of that placid yet alert Irish face could come anything, a challenging question, a flat statement that he was lying. [MASK] clung harder in his mind to his own facts, determined to defend them unto death.
<name>Neutral</name>	Neutral	ferma	He headed in for the shallow, short beach, handling the throttle respectfully, because he was not sure it wouldn’t flare up again. Then he felt the scrape and jolt of earth under the prow. He turned the lever to [MASK], and moved another lever that cut the motor.
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Tom	‘By the way, your father showed me around the Burke-Greenleaf yards before I left,’ [MASK] said. ‘He told me he’d made a lot of changes since you’ve seen it last. I was quite impressed.’
<name>Aschenbach</name>	Aschenbach	Marge	‘Mi dispiace, signore!’ replied the gondolier. ‘Mandaro un altro gondoliere!’ [MASK] laughed again. ‘Oh, some other gondolier’ll pick us up. Isn’t it beautiful?’ She stood on tiptoe. It was not at all a beautiful night.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Dickie	They walked for several blocks without finding a landmark or a familiar street name. They urinated against a dark wall, then drifted on. ‘When the dawn comes up, we can see where we are,’ [MASK] said cheerfully. He looked at his watch. ”
<name>She</name>	She	Tom	He stiffened, sensing danger. You’re not out of the woods yet, he told himself. You’re not out of the house yet. ‘Ready to go?’ [MASK] asked. ‘You do live here, don’t you?’ ‘No!’
<name>Levin</name>	Levin	Tom	A man who lived in the house, whose name [MASK] didn’t know, had seen him come in last night at about a quarter to nine, and they had said good evening to each other. ‘You took a walk alone?’ ‘Yes.’
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Tom	[MASK] leapt again, then sank lower, so low the water closed over his head again with a deadly, fatal slowness, yet too fast for him to get a breath, and he inhaled a noseful of water just as his eyes sank below the surface.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Tom	Then the bus went on, and [MASK] was alone at the side of the road, his suitcases at his feet. There were houses above him, straggling up the mountain, and houses below, their tile roofs silhouetted against the blue sea.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Tom	‘How long’ll you be gone? — What’s the matter, [MASK]? Are you sick?’ It was awful. It went on, the noise and the laughter and the girls feeling the bed and looking in the john.
<name>Guido</name>	Guido	Tom	The voice made a little moan and said it was doubtful, but they would try it. If they could not come before ten o’clock, it was very important that he should not leave the house. ‘Va bene,’ [MASK] said acquiescently, and hung up.
<name>Leamas</name>	Leamas	Tom	The red-haired man waved a hand, and [MASK]’s hand went up limply in response. He slid one leg over a stool and faced the door challengingly, yet with a flagrant casualness. ‘Gin and tonic, please,’ he said to the barman.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Tom	Not with a refrigerator that had the distinction of being one of only about four in the village, a refrigerator with six ice trays and so many shelves on the door that it looked like a supermarket swinging out at you every time you opened it. [MASK] fixed himself an iceless drink.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Tom	But [MASK] made a tremendous effort to behave in the proper way. He saw himself as if he were standing apart from himself and watching the scene. He corrected even his stance, and made it more relaxed by resting a hand on the end post of the bed.
<name>Wemmick</name>	Wemmick	Tom	‘You’re very welcome. Good luck.’ Then [MASK] waited quietly in his house for several days, just as anybody would do, if the search for a missing friend had reached its intensest point. He declined three or four invitations to parties.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Tom	[MASK] felt shaky and lightheaded. The glare of sunlight under the edge of the roof hurt his eyes. Automatically he followed the porter with his luggage towards the customs counter, and tried to realize, as he stared down at his open suitcase that the inspector was hastily examining, exactly what the news meant.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Tom	Anybody else would have, [MASK] thought, anybody, but he hadn’t, and that counted for something. He stood at the corner of the terrace, staring out at the vague empty line of the horizon and thinking of nothing, feeling nothing except a faint, dreamlike lostness and aloneness.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Tom	It was obvious that he hadn’t a great deal of money, [MASK] thought, and also that he was the kind of young man who would prefer to rough it with a guidebook and a volume of Silone or Dante, than to stay in a fancy hotel.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Tom	Even now she had that energetic buoyancy that made [MASK] think of the typical Girl Scout, that look of taking up a lot of space, of possibly knocking something over with a wild movement, of rugged health and vague untidiness.
<name>She</name>	She	Marge	Suppose he’d been under the shower? [MASK] would have yelled up, anyway, simply assuming that he would be able to hear her. He would be glad when she was gone, and he hoped she left this morning.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Tom	‘Well — actually, I do,’ [MASK] replied. ‘There’s also the advantage that they speak Italian and they can get around everywhere and investigate all kinds of suspects. I suppose the man you sent for speaks Italian?’ ‘I really don’t know.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Bob	[MASK] wrote. ‘Do you take a lot of gondola rides? How are the girls? Are you getting so cultured you won’t speak to any of us when you come back? How long are you staying, anyway?’
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Dickie	He looked at his watch. ”S only a couple more hours.’ ‘Fine.’ ‘It’s worth it to see a nice girl home, isn’t it?’ [MASK] asked, staggering a little. ‘Sure it is.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	‘It’s only a quarter to twelve. We can make the twelve o’clock bus.’ They took nothing with them but their jackets and [MASK]’s book of traveller’s cheques. The bus was just arriving as they reached the post office.
<name>He</name>	He	Tom	He was saying that they were Americans, and they didn’t have their passports because they had only gone out for a little walk to look at the stars. [MASK] had an impulse to laugh. He stood up and staggered, dusting his clothing.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Tom	She pointed. ‘See it? The squarelooking white one with the darker red roof than the houses just beside it.’ It was hopeless to pick it out from the other houses, but [MASK] pretended he saw it. ‘Have you been here long?’
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dickie	Where’ve you been all this time?’ , She offered them a drink, but discovered there was only half an inch of gin in her bottle of Gilbey’s. ‘It doesn’t matter, we’re going to my house,’ [MASK] said.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Tom	She was back in her bathing suit. too, a tomato-coloured bathing suit, and she wore a striped shirt over it. She wasn’t bad-looking, [MASK] supposed, and she even had a good figure, if one liked the rather solid type.
<name>Signor</name>	Signor	Tom	‘At what time was he found?’ ‘At dawn this morning. By some workmen who were walking along the road.’ ‘Dio mio!’ [MASK] murmured. ‘He said nothing about making an excursion yesterday to the Via Appia when he left your apartment?’
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Tom	and he’s coming at noon. ’ ‘He is? When did you get the telegram?’ ‘This morning early. If I wasn’t dreaming.’ [MASK] looked for it. ‘Here it is.’
