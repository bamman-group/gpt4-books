<name>Frederick</name>	Frederick	Reverend	he exclaimed. “Christianity is finished and done with. Don’t you know that, [MASK]? And don’t you realize further that it was the message contained in Holy Scripture that was the cause, the ■prime mover, of this entire miserable catastrophe?
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Moore	But since I was neither sullen nor impudent but comported my- self with studied meekness, even a man so shaken with nigger-hatred as [MASK] could only treat me with passable decency and at the very worst advertise me to his neighbors as a kind of ludicrous freak.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sam	All in all it was a never-endingly ugly and dispiriting situation. And easily the most sinister aspect of the matter was what this treatment had done not so much to their bodies but to their minds. Of the two Negroes, [MASK] was the less affected.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Isham	“White man eat!” [MASK] said, still clinging to the traces. “White man eat! Nigger baby she stahve! How come dat ’plies, white fuckah? How come dat ’plies dat white man eat bacon, eat peas, eat grits?
<name>Dillinger</name>	Dillinger	Reverend	but it’ll surer’n hell look better for you in court. Speak up, [MASK].” When I made no reply to him he left without further word. I heard the cell door slam shut and the bolt thud home in the slot with its slippery chunking sound.
<name>Salome</name>	Salome	Celia	“Then [MASK] says: Oh, I would fain swoon into an eternity of love! “Curtain! That’s all!” she said brightly, proudly, looking toward me. “Isn’t that a wonderful masque?
<name>Miss Caroline</name>	Miss Caroline	Nell	“Well, natchel he wam’t exackly readin’,” the old man adds contemptuously. “He jes’ lookin’ at de pitchers, dat’s all. Hit was on account of de pitchers dat he took de book anyways—” “But there are no pictures, are there, [MASK]?
<name>Dave</name>	Dave	Isham	He did not do what a few years of proximity to such an impassioned nigger-hater made me think he would do: he did not strike [MASK] with his whip nor shout something back nor clout him on the side of the head with his boot.
<name>Chris</name>	Chris	Travis	On the morning following my revelation to my followers, for example, when I came back out of the woods as I returned to [MASK]’s, I was smitten by this hallucination to an intense degree. Now overtaken with weakness again from my fast, I headed east to the farm just before noon.
<name>David</name>	David	Nat	I looked about me too but could see nothing out of the ordinary: apple trees, road, fields, distant woodland—all seemed to be in place. He turned and regarded me soberly. ‘Those deer now, [MASK]. Take those deer for example.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Nat	I sensed her eyes again, the saucy tilt of a dimpled chin, her face turned, poised, waiting. I struggled for an answer. “I mean just wouldn’t you, [MASK]?” she repeated, the girlish voice whispery and near. I mean.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Moore	Without these qualities, the fact that I could read and that I was also a student of the Bible might have become for [MASK] (he being both illiterate and a primitive atheist) an insufferable burden to his peace of mind.
<name>Booker</name>	Booker	Nat	But one must begin at a tender age, and thus, sir, you see in [MASK] the promising beginnings of an experiment. Of course, it is late for this child, compared with white children, yet ...”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Nelson	“What’s gone wrong with you, [MASK], anyways? You supposed to be my right arm, an’ now look what’s done happened already! Twas you been sayin’ all along we got to keep the niggers away from the stills and presses!
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Hem	“[MASK]. *. . . Viewed the mangled bodies as they lay, in silent satisfaction.’ My emphasis. Well, that last item—gildin’ the lily, maybe?” I made no reply.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Nat	Again he ceased speaking and then, as if struggling to choke back his own feelings, began to say all sorts of commonplace things in a forced voice touched with false cheeriness: “Come now, [MASK], chin high! . . .
<name>John</name>	John	Lord	He pulled his pants up and I led him to the edge of the creek. “[MASK],” I said in a loud voice, “witness these two sinners who have sinned and have been unclean in Thy sight and stand in need to be baptized.”
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Joseph	[MASK] he was at least a man, not no four-legged dog. My brothers, laughter is good, laughter is bread and salt and buttermilk and a balm for pain. But they is a time for ev’y thing. They is a time for weepin’ too.
<name>Uncle Remus</name>	Uncle Remus	Hark	“Red bar’l, massah. Dat’s de bar! fo’ a gennleman, massah.” When the desire to play the obsequious coon came over him, [MASK]’s voice became so plump and sweet that it was downright unctuous.
<name>Dolores</name>	Dolores	Margaret	Again the rage returns and I cannot tell why my heart is pounding so nor why my hatred for [MASK] is, if anything, deeper than my hatred for her mother. “God damn her soul,” I whisper—not an oath but a supplication.
<name>Jody</name>	Jody	Abraham	“Shoot,” I hear my mother say, “dat man ain’t no trouble. He gib me a bad time an’ I smack him one wid dis yere kettle—” “But you ain’t seed him dis time!” [MASK] breaks in.
<name>Shadrach</name>	Shadrach	Will	The headless body, nightshirted, slid down the wall with a faint hissing sound and collapsed in a pile of skinny shanks, elbows, knobby knees. Blood deluged the room in a foaming sacrament. “Dar now, preacher manl” I heard [MASK] howling at me.
<name>Mr. Hawkins</name>	Mr. Hawkins	Abraham	I possessed an un- usual position and authority, especially for a Negro who was so young, and I was certainly fully conscious of the respect and even awe in which I was held by all the black people at the Mill now that it had become known that I was second only to [MASK] in control.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Nat	I could almost die ... “No, [MASK], you right. Hit sinful to do dat to folks. So when you ax me kin I kill, I Aggers I kin, easy ’nough. Thout Tiny an’ Lucas I wouldn’ like to hang roun’ dis
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Sleepyheads	“[MASK], I seel” he said with a chuckle. ‘Well, you’ll find the Major’s wagon a cozy enough place for a snooze. Hop to now, me young bucks! Hurry up and we’ll be on our way!”
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Brantley	“[MASK] is a poor man,” I said. “He hasn’t got ten cents. And he is very sick. And lost. Doesn’t the Bible say that the Son of man is come to save that which was lost?”
<name>Moses</name>	Moses	Reverend	Divine guidance. Holy will. Messages from up above. Dumdest slop ever I heard of. And what did it get you? What, [MASK]?” I made no reply, even though now I had begun to understand what he was trying to say.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Travis	Besides myself, [MASK] owned only two Negroes—a number, however, not unusual in its smallness, inasmuch as few white people in the region could any longer afford to support more than five or six slaves, and it was rare indeed to find a citizen prosperous enough to own as many as a dozen.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Hark	Certainly it would not do to have a chief lieutenant who was at heart only an abject nigger, full of cheap grins and comic shufflings, unable to gut a white man and gut him without a blink or qualm. In short, [MASK] was for me a necessary and crucial experiment.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Hark	[MASK]’s soft eyes rolled toward me, trusting yet fearful. “How come—” he began in an abrupt startled voice. “Hush your face, man!” I said. I was furious. I wanted to let him have the back of my hand flush in the mouth.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Sam	Because of the isolation of the estate I told [MASK] that they could use guns. It should be easy work. We waited in the hushed hot woods for this group to rejoin us before we set out in full strength on the next stage of our attack.
<name>Red-Eye</name>	Red-Eye	Francis	I saw the vicious scars implanted upon his flanks by [MASK]’s lash and suddenly, though without spirit for the move, I relented. (Then I would know the truth of this beast, which was diverse from all the others . .. )
<name>someone</name>	someone	Benjamin	Softly, gently, kindly treat her .. Though usually the sedulous snoop, I had paid no attention to the conversation, fascinated instead by [MASK], wondering if this would be one of those evenings when he fell out of his chair.
<name>Rachel</name>	Rachel	Maria	Like I was cornin’ roun’ de side of de bam yestiddy evenin’ and dere’s ole Miss [MASK] a-feedin’ the chickens. She seed me afore I could take off. ‘Hark I’ say she.
<name>Custer</name>	Custer	Henry	“Git after them!” I cried to [MASK] and his men. “They won’t git far!” I wheeled and shouted to the others: “Second and Third Troops, take the gun room! On to the house!” Ah Godl
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Gray	Across the room I saw [MASK] murmuring behind his hand to a cadaverous man in a black frock coat, then he quickly arose and addressed the bench. And immediately, with no shock, I realized he was now speaking in tones that he always reserved for court, not for a nigger preacher.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Thaniel	Grasshoppers sail through the weeds with small scaly whickerings, and ever so often a blacksnake slithers among the green, and on August days the odor is ripe and rank and very close, like a hot handful of grass. “How come you all de time studyin’ dat grabeyard, [MASK]?
<name>Faulkner</name>	Faulkner	Travis	Behind and below the seat were the dogs, three flop-eared hounds yapping at one of [MASK]’s yellow cur dogs who was trying to get at them through the spokes of the wheels. It was, I think, the first time I ever saw a dogcart with dogs.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Will	Now, it is curious indeed, but [MASK] was one of the few niggers actually slain during the course of this ruction. So it is your word alone I’ve got to take. And that you killed only one and were reluctant to kill more is a line of goods mighty hard to buy.
<name>Kafka</name>	Kafka	Mercy	“[MASK], it’s gotten cold,” he said, shivering, buttoning his greatcoat. “Anyway—” And he paused, gazing at me. “You know, first thing today after the trial’s over I’m going to try to requisition you some winter clothes.
<name>John Wilkes Booth</name>	John Wilkes Booth	Les’see	I’ll repeat: ‘It was intended by us to have begun the work of death on the fourth of July last. Many were the plans formed by us,’ et cetera, et cetera. [MASK]: ‘And the time passed without our coming to any determination how to commence.
<name>Mammy</name>	Mammy	Nat	Then she trembled as if with a chill, saying gently, “We’d better hurry back, [MASK].” And I, walking beside her now, replied, “Yes, missy,” and this was the last time—but for one—that I ever looked into her face.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Willis	Minutes afterward I heard [MASK] murmur: “Man, I sho liked dat. Want to do it agin?” For a time I couldn’t bring myself to look at him, averting my eyes, keeping my gaze up toward the sun through leaves atremble like a forest of green fluttering moths.
<name>Morgan</name>	Morgan	Hark	For added illumination I had torches made of lightwood stakes and rags soaked in a gallon cask of camphene—turpentine mixed with grain alcohol—that [MASK] had stolen from the wheel shop. These torches would be used indoors and with care on the march, whenever the moonlight failed us.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Henry	Then the Negroes one by one straggled away across the gallery, some with troubled looks, some stupid and uncomprehending, some fearful. Others drew toward me, radiant; and [MASK], who was deaf, who had read my lips, came up close to me and silently clasped my arm.
<name>Uncle Remus</name>	Uncle Remus	Henry	Some of the other Negroes swore that [MASK] could sniff bacon cooking at five miles, was able to track the scent of a possum like a hound, could point with his big toe to a plot of earth and disclose an underground cache of fish-bait earthworms swarming like maggots.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Hark	It was not easy to make of [MASK] a potential killer, to generate true hatred in that large-hearted breast. Without causing him, as I did, to brood on the sale of his wife and child, I might have failed.
<name>Uncle Remus</name>	Uncle Remus	Moore	After the lesson, which might last until well past noon, I bade them all a friendly good-bye and then retired by myself to the shade beneath [MASK]’s wagon where I would have my midday dinner of pone and bacon.
<name>Mr. Ferguson</name>	Mr. Ferguson	Reverend	No offense. All in all you’ve been pretty fair and square with me. In spite of what I said, I reckon a man has to act according to his own lights, even when he’s the victim of a delusion. Good night, [MASK].
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Nat	As she speaks, I feel her closeness, oppressive, disturbing, almost frightening, the flutter and tremble of her linen dress against my sleeve. Oh yes, it is so beautiful I could just weep. You’re so good at remembering the Bible, [MASK].
<name>Jem</name>	Jem	Hark	Besides, it’s always been my idea that a nigger should follow all the rules and regulations so far as he was able.” “Yah, yah, yah.” “Anyway,” I went on. “[MASK] ain’t been quite right ever since then.
<name>John</name>	John	Hark	I felt too exhausted to rise from my pine-needle bed and so stayed there reading and praying as the hot morning lengthened. When [MASK] came up from the creek I bade him go back to the house since I wanted to remain alone. He was reluctant to leave.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Nat	“You kin still go to de camp meetin’, boy.” he insisted, “you jes’ ain’t gwine git a whole lot of sleepin’, dat’s all. Now git on, [MASK], and carry dem boys on up dere in de wagon.
<name>Holcombe</name>	Holcombe	Trezevant	It was obviously he—not the prosecutor [MASK]—who was in charge of things. “How did it hap- pen?” he repeated in a slow, measured voice. “From what dark wellspring did it flow? Will it ever happen again?”
<name>Cudjoe</name>	Cudjoe	Cobb	He began to scramble to his feet. “I fix de brandy fo’ you, massah.” But again [MASK] motioned him back with a brisk wave of his hand. “Go on, go on,” he said.
<name>John</name>	John	Hubbard	It was [MASK], and others like him living in proximity to any of my men in houses up and down the county, that gave me nightmares and grounds for my most piercing disquiet. But as the warm days passed with their blue skies and sweet smell of hay and as summer reached its zenith, I be-
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Mercy	Reckon he might be a likely stud, too. [MASK], ain’t this been a winter?” Then without further comment he turned and on a frosty blast of air was gone. I cannot make sense out of most of the rest of that day.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Nelson	an’ he say he ’spect he gwine be all right time we gits dere.” “Report from the Second Troop!” I said. The Second Troop, a body of six, was [MASK]’s. “All my niggers is ready an’ rarin’ to go,” he said.
<name>Macomber</name>	Macomber	Reverend	But your goose is cooked already.” He looked at me intently, then spoke in a cajoling, hearty voice: “Come on now, [MASK]. Let’s be realistic about this matter! I mean— well, to call a spade a spade—” He halted.
<name>Joad</name>	Joad	Will	I yelled. “Stop! We done it! Yes, yes, we done it! We done what had to be done! But stop recitin’ about me and [MASK]! Leave off studyin’ about all this! We done what had to be done!
<name>Salinger</name>	Salinger	Gray	As I spoke I saw that [MASK] was glaring at me, and I wondered just how much of the truth I was telling him might find its way into those confessions of mine that he would eventually publish. I assumed not much, but it no longer mattered to me.
<name>evil</name>	evil	Satan	The sweat poured down my sides beneath my shirt. Then I uttered a silent prayer, and furiously thrust the thought out of my mind as one thrusts away the very body and spirit of [MASK]. How did I dare think such disastrous thoughts with my great mission so near?
<name>Jake</name>	Jake	Hark	But of all the Negroes, [MASK] was the most surely and firmly under my domination. We congregated together often, the five of us, mainly on the free Sunday afternoons we were given throughout most of the year.
<name>Isham</name>	Isham	Moore	And immediately I sensed madness roving through his soul. “Ho, white man!” he said to [MASK] in a garbled, crazy voice. “You isn’t give Isham ary bit to eat! Not ary bit!
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	Gray	I closed my eyes for a second, opened them again: in the cold, pale, diminishing light [MASK] seemed to be smiling at me, though perhaps it was only the dimness of the twilight which blurred and made indistinct the configurations of his heavy round face.
<name>Poverty</name>	Poverty	Drought	They didn’t have enough to eat neither, just some miser’ble corn-meal with weevils in it an’ sour milk an’ a little fatback that done got so high it would turn a buzzard’s stomach. [MASK] an’ hunger run throughout the land, just like now.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Reverend	“All it proves to me is that—a certain observance. The rights of property, like you done already pointed out.” "Now wait a minute, [MASK],” he retorted. “Wait a minute 11 want to advise you not to get impudent with me.
<name>Eben</name>	Eben	Moore	Even the cur dogs in [MASK]’s barnyard sensed something gone wrong in the atmosphere; they snuffled and whimpered in their limitless misery, and the pigs lay snout-deep amid a stinking wallow, while the chickens squatted inert like swollen feather dusters in the steaming pen.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Nat	Now, about the confession, [MASK], I got everything down that’s important; worked dum near all night on it too. Well, like I already hinted, this confession will, I’m afraid, comprise the evidence for the prosecution and there won’t be any other issue or issues at stake.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Abraham	There is nothing else that I can say. Understand again: I had no idea that [MASK] would fall ill and that you would become the—the instrument by which those boys were delivered into—into other hands.” He halted then and looked at me, lapsing into silence.
<name>Death</name>	Death	Gray	Suddenly I felt the approach of my own death, and with a prickling at my scalp, considered that death with mingled dread and longing. My hands trembled, my bones ached, and I heard [MASK]’s voice as if from a broad and wintry distance.
<name>preacher 2</name>	preacher 2	Brantley	Then next Sunday I will baptize you in the Spirit and you will be redeemed.” “Oh Lord have mercy, preacher 1” [MASK] cried, all asnufile. “You done saved my life I I’m so happy I” He tried to clutch my hand and kiss it
<name>my dear Watson</name>	my dear Watson	Nat	We shall always be in touch by the post. And you—” He paused for an instant, and I knew that he too was moved. “And you—you, [MASK]—think of the freedom that you will have, after all!
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Gray	For a moment, despite myself, something wrenched painfully at my heart, and I had a brief blinding flash of recollection and longing. But only for an instant, for now I heard [MASK] say: “That’s the first item I’m curious about, right there.
<name>Jem</name>	Jem	Will	Now you jes’ cool off yo’ black headl” Then he turned and lumbered back to the cooking fire beneath the trees, leaving [MASK] briefly chastened, sulky-looking, and abashed. Yet although this crisis had been disposed of, I could not rest easy.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Nat	Once from the veranda she called me to help her hang a flower pot; in my jangled fumbling and confusion I nearly allowed the pot to fall, and when, standing at my side, she caught my bare arm amid a shower of earth and cried in a sharp voice, “[MASK]!
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Nat	I mean, and you ... That seems so very strange. She is silent for a moment. Then: [MASK], why do you call yourself a nigger like that? I mean it sounds so—well, so sad somehow. I much prefer the word darky.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Abraham	I press on in despair, searching for the key, hunting for the soft and sweetly familiar, SUGAR, GINGER, CAPSICUM, CLOVES. Suddenly I hear footsteps stamping up the dirt path from the cabins and I draw back underneath the house, hidden again, watching. It is the black driver, [MASK].
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Sam	His head moved from side to side in a wary, dangerous rhythm like that of a bobcat I had once seen cornered by a pack of dogs. “Kill him!” I heard [MASK] roar behind me. But 1 was not ready.
<name>Temple Drake</name>	Temple Drake	Hark	Having just stolen a plump little shoat from the Francis farm nearby, [MASK] declared that he would have nothing to do with fasting himself. But he said he was eager to accompany me to the woods and hoped that the odor of barbecued pork would not prove too much of a trial for my spirit or stomach.
<name>Antonio</name>	Antonio	Cobb	My fear receded. The yellow cur dog came snuffling up and I hurled into his face a slippery blue handful of rabbits’ guts, which he made off with into the cotton patch, groaning with pleasure. “A Greek word,” [MASK] went on.
<name>he</name>	he	Turner	Who knows what she is thinking at the moment [MASK] draws near? Although his face is illumined by a beneficent smile, to her it is a fiendish smirk, and besides he is white, white as bone or skulls or deadwood, whiter than those malevolent ancestral ghosts that prowl the African night.
<name>Mr. Norton</name>	Mr. Norton	Henry	So too for [MASK], who, despite or perhaps because of his deafness, seemed to be craftily alert to his surroundings like no Negro I had ever known. He was about forty, square, squat, black as a tar pit.
<name>Joseph</name>	Joseph	Hark	The following day [MASK] and the others came as I had ordered. I bade them sit around the fire next to me. Then after a session of prayer I turned to the subject at hand. I told them the seal had been removed from my lips and that I had received the last sign.
<name>David</name>	David	Yessum	Now— What is man— “[MASK]. What is man that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visiteth him? Well, uh— And, For thou hast made kirn a little lower than the angels and hast crowned him with glory and honorT
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Nat	“I hope you are aware of how much money one thousand dollars is,” she was saying. “One does not pay that type of money for something one does not really value, or treasure. You are aware of that, [MASK], aren’t you?”
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Gray	That—” He passed his hand across his brow, a gesture of real lament. “That the people can’t understand.” Again I had the impression, dim and fleeting, of hallucination, of talk buried deep in dreams. I stared long and hard at [MASK].
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Hark	It must have been August by now and the chiggers and sweat flies and the mosquitoes were out in full swarm. Some days on [MASK]’s pine-needle bed were almost impossible for sleep. Thunderstorms rumbling out of the west drenched him and froze him and scared him half out of his wits.
<name>Bigger</name>	Bigger	Lord	I’ll lay in de grave and stretch out my arms . . . Suddenly the voice ceased, and all was quiet. Then what I done was wrong. [MASK]? I said. And if what I done was wrong, is there no redemption?
<name>the priest</name>	the priest	Hark	I make no reply, the sound of flowing water ceases, and [MASK]’s voice too falls still. Somewhere far off in the town a dog howls on and on without lull or respite, a continuous harsh lonely cry from the bowels of the dark morning, touching me with dread.
<name>Mahatma</name>	Mahatma	Brantley	Although obviously weak from his fast, [MASK] looked somehow healthier: a pink glow of anticipation suffused his face, and he confided to me that his bowels, for the first time in years, were notably under control. “Oh, I’m so happy!”
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Gray	For as I told [MASK], late that afternoon just before twilight at the Harris farm we had seen a young white girl of fourteen or so flee to the woods, screaming her terror as she rushed into the haven of a grove of juniper trees.
<name>he</name>	he	Travis	Or traded, I should say—traded for two months fair-and-square, as the phrase went, for a yoke of oxen that [MASK] sorely wanted to yank stumps on bumt-off land he intended to plant in apple trees.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Gray	[MASK] halted, then resumed: “Thus, not without some reluctance, I concluded that in terms of this beaucowp important item—the killing of one individual, and one individual alone—the prisoner was speaking the truth . . . “But why?”
<name>Roy</name>	Roy	Hark	“Your mistress pointed you out to me just now. Even so, I would have known, I could have distinguished between you two. The other Negro, what’s his name?” “[MASK],” I said.
<name>Kunta</name>	Kunta	Samson	Then he heard a sudden voice and he awoke in terror to see a white man standing over him with a musket, hammer cocked, ready to shoot. “One move and I’ll blow your head off,” said the white man. “Tie him up, [MASK].”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Preacher	And he gave a vicious yank upward on the thick blood-drenched haft of the ax and pulled the mirror tightly, possessively against the saddle. “[MASK] man”—and his voice became a snarl—“less’n you kin make de ax sing a tune you is all done.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Travis	“Awright,” I went on, “forget all that now. Just mind from now on to keep them niggers out’n them stills. Now listen here, one last time. Give me the plan for [MASK]’s so we git it straight with no trouble.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Lord	A thrill of joy coursed through me as I thought: He’s just testing me now. He’s just seeing if I can baptize. He’s going to save His voice for another time. That’s all right, [MASK].
<name>Miss Rachel</name>	Miss Rachel	Travis	There was no sound from the woods save for the katydids’ high-pitched cheercheer-cheer-cheer and the peeping of crickets among the weeds. In the flat blazing yellow of the moonlight [MASK]’s house slumbered, dark within and still as the halls of death.
