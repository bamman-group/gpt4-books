<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Miller	In the upstairs bathroom the barber gave [MASK] one of the shortest haircuts he had ever had. The white scalp gleamed through the stubble almost up to the crown of the head by the time he had finished. The rumpled look was gone, but he also looked older.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Wiesenthal	[MASK] shook his head. “I doubt it. The moment she learned of the bigamy, she spilled the beans to the police as far as she knew anything. There’s nothing more she knows beyond what she has said, for she now hates him like poison and wants him arrested.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Miller	“I don’t know any names,” said [MASK]. “Anyone will do. Here is my card.” He thrust his press card through the aperture, forcing the man to take it. Then at least he knew it would go inside the building.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Miller	What did you do?” [MASK] looked surprised. “Well, I got out, didn’t I? I discharged myself. I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t go home in case they were waiting for me there.
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Miller	The fourth man was evidently in command. He sat at ease in his chair while his three lieutenants stood or perched around him. [MASK] judged him to be about sixty, lean and bony, with a hollowcheeked, hook-nosed face.
<name>Hitler</name>	Hitler	Tauber	Money. Where did [MASK] get his money? He didn’t work. He refused to accept any compensation from the German state. Yet he paid his rent regularly and must have had something left over with which to eat.
<name>He</name>	He	Vulkan	“You’re not on that list. I am, so I have to get out. Go back to your flat and wait until my successor contacts you. For the rest, it’s over. [MASK] has fled and won’t come back.
<name>Karl</name>	Karl	Roschmann	The captain moved toward his orderlies. As I watched, [MASK] drew his SS officer s Luger from its holster, took careful aim, and fired between the captain’s shoulders. Everything stopped at the crash from the pistol. The Army captain staggered and turned.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Mackensen	[MASK] surveyed the skeleton with a grim smile and walked over to the bundle of scorched clothes and their contents on the ground twenty feet away. Something about the size of the corpse caught his attention, and he stooped over it for several minutes.
<name>He</name>	He	Miller	So if you want to make a big issue out of this, you’re on your own. Count me out.” [MASK] sat and stared through the windshield. “All right. If that’s the way it is,” he said at length.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Miller	With his purchases made, he took a room in the Hohenzollern Hotel overlooking the square, so that he could keep an eye on the parking area, to which he was certain [MASK] would return, while he worked.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Miller	“I brought a letter of introduction from the man who suggested I come to you, sir.” The Odessa man took the letter without a word, slit it open, and cast his eyes quickly down it. He stiffened slightly and gazed narrowly across the sheet of paper at [MASK].
<name>me</name>	me	Miller	The driver of the car ahead of [MASK] climbed out and walked back towards him. He approached the left-hand window, then realized that the driver’s seat was inexplicably on the right and came round the car. He wore a nylon-fur-collared jacket.
<name>newspaper</name>	newspaper	Cadbury	Yes, [MASK], yes, newspaper chap. I remember him now. Haven’t seen him in years. Well, don’t let’s stand here. It’s cold and I’m not as young as I was. Come in, come in.”
<name>Private</name>	Private	Miller	Whatever they did can’t change that. So smarten up, [MASK]. So long as you are in this house, this is the procedure. “When I walk into a room, you leap to attention. And I mean leap.
<name>Yuri</name>	Yuri	Leon	Supposing he doesn’t check in?” [MASK]’s anger was barely controlled. It was evident they had been through this argument before. “Now, listen one more time. This man is my discovery. His infiltration into the Odessa was my idea.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Miller	“Well, there was a brief note. I had to take it and include it in my report on the suicide. By now it will have been filed away. And the file’s closed.” “What did he say in it?” asked [MASK].
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Oskar	Outside in the driveway, the man called [MASK] pedaled toward the door, his errand to report the broken phone line accomplished. He paused in surprise on seeing the Jaguar, for his employer had assured him before he went that no one was expected.
<name>Mengele</name>	Mengele	Roschmann	As a Kapo I wore an armband and carried a club, and the extra food rations had increased my strength a little. Although [MASK] had seen my face, he did not seem to remember it. He had slashed so many across the face that one more or less would not attract his attention.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Miller	“Because there’s no story in it,” said [MASK]. “What am I supposed to say? ‘Surprise, surprise, I’ve found a loose-leaf folder in which an old man who just gassed himself describes what he went through during the war’?
<name>the target</name>	the target	Miller	The frame and the floors were in place, with a rough concrete stairway leading up to the second and third floors. He could wait; [MASK] was not going anywhere. He walked purposefully back to his car and the hunting rifle locked in the trunk.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Miller	“That’s what he said in his diary.” “Mmmm. Two and a half years before we got him. And do you know where he was?” “No,” said [MASK]. “In a British prisoner-of-war camp.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Bayer	He took off the gag again. “I can break every finger on both your hands, [MASK],” he whispered. “After that I’ll take the bulb out of the table lamp, switch it on, and stuff your prick down the socket.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Mackensen	He didn’t see the shadow that fell onto the carpet from the open French window; he felt it and spun around, ready to fire. But the man was unarmed. “Who the hell are you?” growled [MASK], keeping him covered.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Leon	Although he did not know it, he stood just twelve hundred meters from the black Jaguar with the yellow stripe, which was parked inside the walled courtyard of the antiques shop and private house where [MASK] lived and ran his small and fanatic organization.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Miller	You get anything else there is on hand. Okay?” “Well, since it’s you, all right. Let’s get it over with.” “There’s one last thing. The place has a live-in maid,” said [MASK].
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Miller	Never let journalism get personal. It’s bad for reporting, and it’s bad for the reporter. Anyway, how are you going to finance yourself?” “I’ve got some savings.” [MASK] rose to go.
<name>He</name>	He	Miller	I’d hoped to catch him before he went to work,” he said. “He hasn’t gone to work, sir. Not this morning. He’s gone off on vacation,” replied the girl helpfully. [MASK] fought down a rising feeling of panic.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Miller	[MASK] took his eyes off the road and stared at the dimly illuminated band of frequencies along the upper edge of the radio, as if his eyes would be able to deny what his ears had heard, assure him he was tuned in to the wrong radio station, the one that broadcast nonsense.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Mackensen	Six weeks of searching, and all you can tell me is that he hasn’t been seen. . ..” [MASK] waited until the outburst of frustration had spent itself. “Nevertheless, it's true,” he pointed out at length.
<name>Randle</name>	Randle	Roschmann	He had got up into third gear and was boring down the slippery track as fast as he could take it when he hit the snow-covered telegraph pole lying across the road. [MASK] was still sawing at the chain linking the two bracelets when the shattering roar in the pine forest stopped him.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Miller	“Yes, I’m afraid I do.” “Too bad. I’d like to have kept it. A remarkable diary.” He rose and escorted [MASK] to the front door. “Good luck,” he said, “and let me know how you get on.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Mackensen	asked [MASK]. “You get lost,” replied his chief. “You’re not on that list. I am, so I have to get out. Go back to your flat and wait until my successor contacts you. For the rest, it’s over.
<name>Cherry</name>	Cherry	Winzer	I don’t want no part of violence.” “We’ll wait until two in the morning. She’ll be fast asleep.” They walked the mile to [MASK]’s house, cast a quick look up and down the road, and darted through the gate.
<name>Klaus</name>	Klaus	Miller	About your father, I mean. I never thought I’d say that to a German. Now about the file. What was it?” [MASK] told him. “Then why the hell couldn’t you let us have it? You’re an ungrateful man.
<name>David</name>	David	Motti	“Do be careful. These men can be dangerous.” Then he remembered [MASK] and wondered how one of them could have been reading a Hebrew newspaper in the Jewish Community Center. The car drove for twenty-five minutes, then slowed and stopped.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Sigi	Just before five in the morning he heard the flat door open, and [MASK] came in from work. She was startled to find him still awake. “What are you doing up so late?” she asked.
<name>George</name>	George	Miller	It’s cold and I’m not as young as I was. Come in, come in.” Without waiting for an answer he turned and walked back down the hall. [MASK] followed, closing the door on the chill wind of the last day of 1963.
<name>Lois</name>	Lois	Miller	“I am told you are a journalist. Yes? A freelance journalist. A very good one.” He smiled brightly. “You have a reputation for being very thorough, very tenacious.” [MASK] remained silent, waiting for him to get to the point.
<name>He</name>	He	Miller	“Yes. Now. I would come to the hotel, but I’m with my friends here. Come right away.” He hung up. [MASK] took his coat and walked out through the doors. He turned left and headed down the pavement.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Kolb	Oh—er—June eighteenth, sir.” “The year, [MASK]?” “Nineteen twenty-five, sir.” The lawyer considered the driving license for another few minutes. “Wait here,” he said suddenly, got up, and left.
<name>Jack Reacher</name>	Jack Reacher	Mackensen	“You little shit,” he told the body and held the gun at arm’s length pointing downward, lined up on the forehead. Years of living like a predatory animal and surviving where others, victims and colleagues, had ended on a pathologist’s slab had given [MASK] the senses of a leopard.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Miller	In every state police force there are men I can call and know I’ll get action if necessary. There are others to avoid. So call me first, right?” [MASK] pocketed the paper. “I’ll remember that,” he said as he left.
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Marx	“You must realize that nobody would ever believe his story?” [MASK] shifted his gaze off the river and looked up at the reporter. “Oh yes,” he said softly. “He knew that. You see, that was why he killed himself.”
<name>Klaus Barbie</name>	Klaus Barbie	Roschmann	At that time the Odessa was in close contact with the recruitment section of the French Foreign Legion, into which scores of former SS soldiers had fled. Four days after contact was made, a car with French number plates was waiting outside the town of Ostermieting and took on board [MASK] and five other Nazi escapers.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Mackensen	In his left hand he carried his crash helmet, gripped by the short peak and held across his stomach. The man flicked a glance at the body at [MASK]’s feet and the gun in his hand. “I was sent for,” he said innocently.
<name>the man</name>	the man	Bayer	He had never killed a man before and had no desire to start now. Slowly he eased off the scarf and pulled the rolled socks out of [MASK]’s mouth, keeping the lamp poised in his right hand, high over the fat man’s head.
<name>the protagonist</name>	the protagonist	Brandt	“Then I’m calling back.” He slammed down the receiver. An hour later [MASK] was as angry as ever and more than a little frightened. He heartily wished he had kept the diary to himself and thrown it away. THE ODESSA FILE 117
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Miller	“What do you want, [MASK]?” “Sit down,” said the reporter. “Not at the desk—there in the armchair, where I can see you. And keep your hands on the armrests.
<name>The Kid</name>	The Kid	Miller	If you attempt to yell, you get this right across the head. I don’t really care if I crack your head or not. Got it?” [MASK] was not telling the truth. He had never killed a man before and had no desire to start now.
<name>Paymaster</name>	Paymaster	PENSIONS	He approached the window marked [MASK]. “Can you tell me when the pensioners collect their money?” he asked the fat lady behind the grille. “Last day of the month, of course,” she said. “That will be Saturday, then?”
<name>Eddie</name>	Eddie	Peter	“I had to do it,” he said, bereft of an explanation for things that now seemed to him to have been crazy. “All this for a rotten old Nazi? You’re nuts. It’s over, [MASK]. All that is over.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Roschmann	After drinking his fill from a water butt, my room neigh- bor remarked that perhaps it would not be too bad after all. We had not yet met [MASK]. As summer merged into autumn and autumn into winter, the conditions in the ghetto grew worse.
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Esther	I still stood there, unable to move. He put his face closer to mine and whispered, “You have ten seconds to pack her in, or you will go yourself.” Slowly I held out my arm and [MASK] leaned upon it.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Tauber	Did [MASK] leave anything else behind when he died?” “Well, there was a brief note. I had to take it and include it in my report on the suicide. By now it will have been filed away. And the file’s closed.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Miller	“I didn’t know he was Jewish. What about him?” “I want to talk to you,” said the police inspector. “But not on the phone. Can we meet?” [MASK]’s reporter’s mind clicked into gear immediately.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Miller	[MASK] grew serious. At length he rose, still naked, crossed the room, and came back with his document case. He seated himself on the edge of the bed. “You’re going to learn pretty soon what I’ve been up to,” he said.
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Miller	Anyway, with the shortage of newsprint in those days, the Christmas Eve edition must have been tiny.” He laid the sheet on the writing desk and shone the Anglepoise lamp onto it. [MASK] leaned over to read it.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Miller	Where’s the lever that opens the brickwork?” “I don’t know,” muttered [MASK] back, imitating the low murmur of the burglar, who had learned the hard way that a murmur is far more difficult to detect than a whisper.
<name>Winston Churchill</name>	Winston Churchill	Amit	“Agreed,” said [MASK], “but without a military attack. We shall just have to try to force the German scientists to resign before they have finished their work. Remember, the research stage is almost at an end. We have six months.
<name>Obanno</name>	Obanno	Miller	But [MASK] was on the carpet a few feet away from him, his bodyguard was certainly dead, and time was running out without hope of reprieve. He leaned his head against the chill metal of the fire-surround and closed his eyes.
<name>the informant</name>	the informant	Roschmann	There’s nothing more she knows beyond what she has said, for she now hates him like poison and wants him arrested. Needless to say, after being ‘blown,’ [MASK] is not likely to reveal his whereabouts to her again. Or his new name.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Marta	The money helped [MASK] and the kids have a real good time over Christmas and the New Year. If ever I can do you a good turn back, just let me know. Yours with respects... But what was the name on the bottom of that letter?
<name>he</name>	he	Miller	With obvious reservations, she agreed. Playing his cards coolly, [MASK] made no pass at her that night. It was early spring, and she emerged from the cabaret, when it closed, clad in a most unglamorous duffel coat, which he presumed was intentional.
<name>Mikhail</name>	Mikhail	Leon	In fact, he had been abducted by a group of men led by a shadowy figure called [MASK], and his body dumped in the Starnberg lake, assisted to the weed bed by a corset of heavy-link chain.
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Nasser	[MASK] is determined on it, but he will not fight until he is ready. But if we force it on him now, the simple answer is that he, with his Russian weaponry, is more ready than we are.” There was silence again.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Miller	He was a big man, standing six feet three, and in his rain cape, with his arms spread wide to hold back the crowd, he looked as immovable as a barn door. “What’s up, then?” asked [MASK].
<name>Elsa</name>	Elsa	Roschmann	In the parlance of the ghetto the expression “Diina-miinde convoy” henceforward came to mean “death by gassing.” On March 3 the whisper went around the ghetto that there was to be another Diinamunde convoy, and sure enough, at morning roll call [MASK] announced it.
<name>the person</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	the person (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Miller	I think I may be able to help you. Rather, some friends may be able to. Would you like to meet them?” “I’ll meet anybody who can help me,” said [MASK], intrigued by the maneuvers.
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Leon	“I gave him a two-hour interrogation yesterday, and he could pass. Until someone starts asking for specific details of his career. Then he knows nothing.” [MASK] nodded for a while, examining some papers he had taken from his attache case.
<name>Miss Marple</name>	Miss Marple	Miller	“So he lives here alone, then?” “Well, except for me. I mean, I live in. It’s quite safe. From that point of view.” She giggled. “I see. Thank you,” said [MASK] and turned to go.
<name>Dumbledore</name>	Dumbledore	Cadbury	“My generation wasn’t told much about all that. Nobody wanted to tell us anything.” [MASK] shot him a shrewd glance under his bushy eyebrows. “But you want to know now?” “We have to know sooner or later.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Miller	“I wonder why he didn’t call me if he wanted to talk to me,” he mused. Then he evidently waited for an answer. “Maybe he didn’t want to use the phone on a matter like this,” [MASK] suggested hopefully.
<name>Hitler</name>	Hitler	Klaus	His father backed [MASK]. “Are you saying, foolish woman, that our son’s ration cards are inferior to the Yankee ration cards?” The argument was unanswerable, the more so when they sat down to a four-course meal that night.
<name>her</name>	her	Sigi	He took his attache case out from under the bed, and on a plain sheet from it wrote a message for [MASK] to read when she awoke. It said: “My darling. I am going now to see the man I have been hunting.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Marx	“Is that all?" he asked. “That’s all,” said the man, regarding him sourly from the shelter of the back door. “Do you have any tenant by the name of [MASK]?” “Nope.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Roschmann	[MASK] knew he was up against a man whom no argument could influence. He stared, as if mesmerized, at the gun. “You’re going to kill me. You mustn’t do that, not in cold blood. You wouldn’t do that.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Rivka	He took a taxi back home to his flat in the suburbs and let himself in with the key that had just been returned to him with his other effects. In the darkened bedroom he could make out the sleeping form of [MASK], his wife, the light blanket rising and falling with her breathing.
<name>Hitler</name>	Hitler	Hitler	He had been three years old when [MASK] came to power, seven when his parents had been taken away in a black van; he had been hidden in an attic for another three years until, at the age of ten in 1940, he too had been discovered and taken away in a van.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Miller	He looked at the parcel under [MASK]’s arm and nodded slowly. “Yes. Yes, it did. I just never thought it was that bad. And by the way, it’s not all past history.
<name>Mountains</name>	Mountains	Miller	“One last question about the camp, Staff Sergeant. When you looked up, from anywhere in the camp, what did you see?” [MASK] looked puzzled. “The sky,” he said. “Fool, I mean what dominated the horizon?”
<name>you</name>	you	Sigi	The diary’s gone. The file is gone. All that remains is your personal word. If you insist on talking, nobody will believe you except the Odessa, and they’ll come for you. Or rather, they’ll probably hit [MASK] or your mother.
<name>The Jackal</name>	The Jackal	Miller	“What happened?” “The first was found floating in a canal without his fingernails. The second disappeared without trace. Do you still want to go ahead?” [MASK] ignored the question. “If your methods are so efficient, why were they caught?”
<name>He</name>	He	Miller	After the war he transcribed them all. They make up the diary.” [MASK] looked at the parcel with scant interest. “Where did you find it?” “It was lying next to the body. I picked it up and took it home.
<name>The Misfit</name>	The Misfit	Roschmann	[MASK] fired his last three slugs into the sand in front of her face, blasting the sand up into her eyes. Between the crash of each shot came the old woman’s rattling wheeze, which could be heard across the parade square.
<name>Hitler</name>	Hitler	Hitler	It made for itself almost everything it could ever need, and used the slave laborers, which by [MASK]’s decree were the property of the SS, to do the work. The third stage of the exploitation lay in the corpses of the dead.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Miller	[MASK] shrugged. “I’m a reporter. It’s a good story.” “But not one you will ever sell to the press, I fear. And hardly worth your own money. Are you sure there’s nothing personal in this?”
<name>Rainsford</name>	Rainsford	Roschmann	After that everyone on that list is on borrowed time. That includes [MASK], the owner of the house you’re in, and me. I’ve spent the whole morning trying to warn everyone concerned to get out of the country inside twenty-four hours.”
<name>He</name>	He	Miller	“I’m afraid I have to go out to dinner tonight,” he said. “The only things left to look through are these.” He gestured to the box files on shelves along two of the walls. [MASK] closed the file he had been searching.
<name>the suspect's name</name>	the suspect's name	Miller	The man took it, flicked it open, and digested the details inside. He glanced over it at [MASK], comparing the photograph and the face. They matched. “What is your date of birth?” he snapped suddenly. “My birthday?
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Miller	“Thank you.” [MASK] was back on Friday morning, watching the queue of old men and women begin to filter through the doors of the post office when it opened. He positioned himself against the wall opposite, watching the directions they took as they departed.
<name>Colonel</name>	Colonel	Roschmann	It was gray with exhaustion, with dark smudges under the eyes. There were lines down each side of the nose and several weeks of stubble on his chin. Seeing the loading work begin again, he made to march past [MASK] to supervise his orderlies.
<name>Churchill</name>	Churchill	Hitler	They had seen it coming and had pleaded with [MASK] to pull back the forty-five divisions inside the enclave. He had refused, reiterating his parrot-cry, “Death or Victory.” All he offered those 500,000 soldiers inside the enclave was death.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Brandt	After a quick glance, [MASK] pulled the blanket back and nod- ded to the ambulance attendant behind him. He stepped back as the man rammed the stretcher into its berth, locked the doors, and went around to the cab to join his partner. The ambulance surged away.
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Josef	Ignoring the words, [MASK] wrote down the figures in a long line. The five-figure groups into which the marks and pfennigs were divided disappeared. When he had them all in a line, he split them up into groups of six figures.
<name>him</name>	him	Miller	sixteen It was already dark when the Jaguar slid into the small spa town in the eastern foothills of the mountain range. A glance at his map told [MASK] he was less than twenty miles from the private estate he sought.
<name>Franz</name>	Franz	Tauber	But so precise. [MASK] would have made a perfect witness. He noticed everything, even the small details. And noted them—at the time. That is very important to get a conviction before German or Austrian courts. And now he’s dead.”
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Tauber	His face had a flush, either from drinking or from the country air, and his hair was gray at the sides. He looked the picture of middle-aged, upper-middle-class, prosperous good health. But although different in detail, the face was the same [MASK] had seen and described.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Miller	The clerk took these also and placed them all in a tray behind him, whence the sheets were whisked away through an aperture by an unseen hand. “Please wait. It will take about ten minutes,” the clerk told [MASK] and the other man.
<name>he</name>	he	Miller	The receptionist looked worried. “I don’t know if he’s still here. It is Friday afternoon, you know.” “Please try,” said [MASK], and proffered his press card. The receptionist looked at it and dialed a number on her house telephone.
