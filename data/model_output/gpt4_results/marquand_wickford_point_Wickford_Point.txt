<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Jim	I don’t like to be wondering about them. I don’t see why anyone bought that story of yours, [MASK]. It was such a stupid story.” “The only time you heard it, you went to sleep,” I said.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jim	You don’t think he’d do that, do you, [MASK]?” “Get this into your head,” I said. “No one can do that. The only one who can destroy you is you.” “You really think so?”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Bella	The trees close to the bank cast shadows over the brown surface, and little puffs of breeze rattled through the marsh grasses, which were already sere and frostbitten. “Are we almost there?” [MASK] asked. She never could sit still in a canoe for long.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Sarah	The furniture still remained almost exactly as my great-aunt [MASK] had arranged it. There were even the same ornaments upon the mantelpiece and on top of her desk, except for a few delicate ones, like the small blue china dog that had held lamplighters in its mouth.
<name>Wolfe</name>	Wolfe	Bella	When he got it, he dropped everything. He’ll be there any minute. You’ve got to get her out before he comes.” He began speaking with a frantic sort of patience more irritating than his haste. I had suspected that [MASK] had been lying.
<name>She</name>	She	Bella	They’re asking if I’m sure I want to marry him.” “Well, why aren’t you dressed?” I asked. [MASK] raised her clenched hands in a hopeless gesture. “Howcan I get dressed if they haven’t got my dress ready?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Allen	“Thank you for everything, [MASK],” he said. “We’ll have to be going now.” We did not speak until we reached the car, and I was the one who spoke first. “God damn him,” I said.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bella	I asked. [MASK] began to laugh. “You have such funny ideas,” she said. “You’re just like all the family. You always think I’m up to something. I don’t see why you all keep spying on me.
<name>Wolfe</name>	Wolfe	Harry	“Precisely three-and-three-quarters minutes ago,” [MASK] said, “I telephoned. Oddly enough, the man who answered me was in complete possession of his faculties. Why should there be any reason for mendacity? He said the God-damned boat had docked.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Bella	My hand was on the stern and I was just about to get in, when I heard someone calling me and saw [MASK] standing on the bank. “Where are you going?” she asked. “Upriver,” I answered, and I knew what she would be asking next.
<name>Rosemary</name>	Rosemary	Belle	“She’s told you something.” “There’s no use talking about it, [MASK],” I said. “I’m through. I don’t care what anybody says about you. It isn’t important any more.” “I knew it,” she said.
<name>Wolfe</name>	Wolfe	Harry	“Sit down and take the weight off your feet,” I said. “What’s the matter with her reputation?” [MASK] did not sit down; instead he squared his shoulders and looked at me speculatively down the bridge of his long nose.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Jim	“[MASK],” she said, “for heaven’s sake, what is it?” She backed away from me when I came near her. “So you lied to me?” I said. “So you just came down here for fun?”
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Jim	I listened while I drove the car. The whole thing made me sick and she would be ashamed of herself when it was all over. Her voice went on against my silence and finally died away. “[MASK],” she said at length. “What?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bella	Don’t you want me to get you some toast? Don’t you want anything besides coffee?” Then the telephone rang again. “I’ll go,” said [MASK], and she skipped away like a dancer—and she was a pretty dancer.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bella	I began to think that [MASK] had grown hard. I did not like the way she was behaving. “Where have you been?” she said. “You always keep going away, abroad and places for months and years, and we always just sit here.
<name>Wemmick</name>	Wemmick	Harry	“It would have to be absolutely iron-clad. Now my idea is this—” [MASK] began counting off points on his fingers. “One: so much for light, heat, rent and service, computed from a monthly average which could easily be arrived at.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Jim	Well, he’s on his way here now.” “[MASK],” she said, “don’t look like that.” “Never mind how I look,” I told her. “I said you were a liar.
<name>Balzac</name>	Balzac	Balzac	He had owed a clothing bill for two years, and then there was a set of [MASK]’s Human Comedy and a special edition of the unabridged Arabian Nights and some other similar items purchased from a book agent, and a typewriter and a camera.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	George	“He’d better stay here and fix it,” [MASK] said. “Tell the Old Man he’ll fix it. When they meet for the first time at the house-party, they’ll hate each other.”
<name>Wolfsheim</name>	Wolfsheim	Stanhope	“I hired one.” “Oh,” I said. “How did you hear about that wire?” he asked, and then before I could answer his face cleared and he grinned. “[MASK]’s been after you, has he?”
<name>He</name>	He	Avery	“Yes,” I said, “with limitations.” [MASK] blushed. “Yes,” he said. “Of course I didn’t mean you really loved her.” That reply of his made me feel very old, and burdened by the weight of my experience.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Harry	“I don’t suppose it means anything to you,” said [MASK], “because you always take this sophisticated attitude that nothing means anything. I am the head of the family and I have to think of my sister’s reputation.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jim	He has to buy five hundred lanterns and a lot of those things that they have at tables sometimes that make noises, but the main thing is the car. Did he speak to you about it, [MASK]?” “Not yet,” I said.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Bella	“I see what you mean,” he said. “That’s true. She’s so like [MASK] . . . with no one to look after her. Well, I mustn’t stay here running on in this vein.
<name>Frances</name>	Frances	Jim	[MASK]—” “What?” I said. “Don’t say anything about it, please.” “You don’t have to ask me that,” I said. She leaned her shoulder against mine. In a way she was saying good-by to the last few days.
<name>George</name>	George	Archie	Do you think my dress is all right, dear? It’s one that [MASK]’s fond of.” Her dress was dark blue, very long, and it fell in folds like a Grecian drapery—not mourning, for the family did not believe in mourning.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Mary	She always knew how to dress, although I had never seen her take any care of her clothes. When her clothes were not on her back, they were usually in a ball in her bureau drawer or somewhere in the bottom of a suitcase, except the ones which belonged to her mother or to [MASK].
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	George	“They think he wet the rug, and he didn’t do it, and then he is beaten and the Master is going to have him chloroformed until the dog finds a Prowler in the cellar, but the Mistress understood him all the time.” “And here’s a Stickney,” [MASK] said.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bella	It was like a crowded room when I stood beneath the trees. It Won’t Take a Minute to Pack [MASK] was out on the lawn when I got back. She must have been working hard on herself, because she was nearly ready to leave.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	George	“We’re rather short on aviation.” “That’s it,” [MASK] said. “I picked it up last night, and I couldn’t put it down.” “Is there a hostess in it?”
<name>Wolfsheim</name>	Wolfsheim	Harry	“Not small-town,” he said; “race-track—pari-mutuel.” “It’s exactly what I said,” [MASK] said, and he pointed at me again. “Everyone will say exactly what I said, if they see him in those clothes.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bella	“Well, how about [MASK]?” I said. “Perhaps she wants to do something for someone too, if that’s what every woman wants; and she hasn’t a chance to do it here. You do too much for everybody, and now they all expect it.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Joe	“That’s very, very timely,” I said. I was glad to be back with [MASK], not that anything he was saying made much sense, but it was nice to talk to someone who thought the same way you did.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Jim	I stood listening to her and looking at the pieces of the broken glass. “Yes,” she was saying, “yes, he’s here. It’s for you, [MASK].” “How the devil can it be for me?” I asked.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Patricia	[MASK] laughed. There was always something about me which amused her. “She can stand it if I can,” she said. “I’m awfully glad to see you.” She drew away from me, but her hands were still on my shoulders.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Sid	[MASK] was the one who opened the door and he was entirely grown-up, a frailer edition of Harry with the same distinguished Brill nose and the rather small Brill mouth. I recognized him at once by the limp way that his hands hung out of his sleeves.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Belle	Think it over, that’s all, [MASK].” “All right,” she said, “but I’m still going to marry him, darling.” Dreadfully, Dreadfully Happy I was very busy that autumn and winter, although I cannot recollect much of what I did.
<name>Macomber</name>	Macomber	Joe	“Why should he be lonely?” I asked. “Why shouldn’t he be?” said [MASK]. “I’d be lonely in his shoes. Or maybe he was full of fun.” I did not agree with him about the last.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bella	“All right,” I said. “Did she say why?” “I’m sure I don’t know what she wanted,” [MASK] said, “and she wouldn’t tell me. I think it was rather fresh of her.”
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Bella	“I can’t help it,” [MASK] said. “I just keep thinking that I’m different from everybody else and it makes me lonely when I try to be like other people.” “Well, don’t let it worry you,” I said.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Bella	Those moods of hers had always hurt him and what was worse, he could never take her seriously when it was necessary. “[MASK],” he said, “you don’t know what you want right now. Let’s talk about it later.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jim	I don’t want to be disturbed unless it’s important—only an important call. Sit down, [MASK]. Take off your coat. All you and I need is half an hour to fix it up. I told the Old Man you would.
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Pat	“She would wait until just the wrong time and bring it up. Or else she would get me to do something for her so she wouldn’t mention it.” [MASK]’s voice, tinged with a note of amusement, came to me through the dark again.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Bella	“If [MASK] would only get married, it would be all right,” she said. “It must be funny coming back and finding everyone grown-up.” “Yes,” I said, “it’s funny.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Joe	“You have it in your hand,” I said. She had a look of blank surprise when she saw my handkerchief still dangling from her fingers. “Don’t you see what I’m saying, [MASK]?” she asked.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Joe	“You’re looking tired,” I said. [MASK] shook his head and grinned at me. “I’ve been working all day,” he said. “You know the way it gets you when nothing’s coming out just right.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	She’s beautiful, and everything she says is kind—but it’s not for you, [MASK], is it?” “No,” I said, “it shouldn’t be.” “What are all those little stones?” she asked.
<name>Clarence</name>	Clarence	Harry	“Your remark,” said [MASK], “has nothing whatever to do with the situation. The point is that my sister, my own sister, is being made to live the life of the second-class. I sit here night after night and see it.”
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Henry	Funny, isn’t it, how suddenly people pass out of the picture?” “Well,” I said, “it all depends on what the picture is. You can pass out of some pictures rather quickly, [MASK].”
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Joe	“Has she enough money?” I drove the car over to the curb and stopped it. We were right in front of the Harvard Business School with a fine view of the new Houses across the river. I turned around so that I could look at [MASK].
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Allen	There’s so much I want to see, so much I want to think about.” “That’s all right, [MASK],” I said. “I’m glad you like it here, but I’m going to bed. Good night.”
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Joe	“That’s what you always kept hoping, wasn’t it, dear?” she said. “We can’t. It wouldn’t be fair to try, because I don’t want you enough, [MASK]. I thought I did, but I don’t.”
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Harry	Our paths had grown so divergent that I had not seen [MASK] for quite a long while. He was engaged in 192 a great many activities that kept him out of his room most of the time—which was just as well, as he was having a great deal of trouble with his bills.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sid	I think this coffee has been boiled too long.” “It’s been on the back of the stove for four hours,” I said, “lean tell it,” agreed [MASK], “by watching it drop from the spoon.” I sat down.
<name>Frances</name>	Frances	Sid	You’ll drop me off, won’t you, darling?” “Yes,” I said, “I’ll drop you off.” “In the ocean,” said [MASK], “with a stone around your neck.”
<name>Frances</name>	Frances	Bella	I don’t know why it is that no one can do anything. You must talk to [MASK], darling.” “All right,” I said. “And you must tell me what you’re going to do, arid everything you’ve been doing.”
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Avery	And I don’t need three guesses either. You were—” “Be quiet,” I told her, “be quiet, honey bee. I’m talking to [MASK] now.” “You want to change the subject, don’t you?”
<name>Ulysses</name>	Ulysses	Southby	I believed that I was under no illusion about my literary skill. I was not fool enough to attempt such a thing as [MASK] was attempting. It was all well enough to think of it, but even as I thought I knew that I should never do it.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Bella	“No one knows I’m here.” [MASK] put her hands on her hips. “Well, why the devil can’t it be?” she said. “You must have told someone.” We seemed to be dropping back again into our old friendly relationship.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Joe	“If we do it all over, we can do it without you this time.” “You’re going to, [MASK],” I said. I had often prided myself on my composure, but now I felt that my hands and my voice were shaking.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Sidney	I just let things go. I sit and watch it all move. It’s very, very interesting.” “Where’s it moving to?” I asked. Sometimes I had a respect for [MASK] because he had a way of seeing things.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Bella	His voice trailed off into silence as I followed him down the hall to the living room. The sun was shining through the windows upon that disorderly room, which I had always thought was so much like [MASK]’s mind.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Jim	She had spoken in a gentle, stunned way, as though she could not understand why she had done it. “[MASK],” she said, “I didn’t have to.” “No,” I said, “that’s true.”
<name>George</name>	George	Allen	“I haven’t forgotten a word,” I told him, “and that’s the truth. Go out and get me a little ice while I read it. I’ll need another drink.” “Haven’t you had enough?” said [MASK].
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Joe	“[MASK] didn’t say anything silly?” he asked. “He didn’t say anything about your going away with him somewhere?” “He suggested it,” I said. “I’d rather like to go.”
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Marie	There were lights above the streets also, puncturing the black shadows of the buildings that stood out against the fading glow in the sky. It was cooler than on the ground, but it was very hot. [MASK] was waiting to ask me something.
<name>Timothy</name>	Timothy	Joe	“Oh,” said [MASK], and he did not speak again. I was feeling the old sort of anticipation which came over me every time I went down that hill, although nothing had ever come of it.
<name>Conrad</name>	Conrad	Allen	“If I did, I wouldn’t act like a prima donna when you read it.” [MASK] sat down stiffly and jammed some tobacco into his pipe. “If you mean I can’t stand honest criticism,” he said, “you’re very much mistaken.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Jim	“Oh,” she said, “that little—Excuse me, [MASK].” “That isn’t fair,” I said. “You don’t know her well.” “I’m just speaking in generalities, darling,” she answered.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mary	I’ll help or someone will help. My purse is upstairs in the upper bureau drawer.” “There isn’t any money in it,” [MASK] said. “I looked.” I was right; it hadn’t changed at all.
<name>Wolfe</name>	Wolfe	Allen	I know it’s going to be good.” The cocktails were a credit to [MASK] in that they proved conclusively that he seldom drank them. He must have been aware himself of their deficiencies, for he came back with a pewter mug when he brought the ice.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Harry	“It won’t do you any good.” “I’ll play around with anyone I want,” I answered. “All right,” said [MASK], “but it won’t get you anywhere.”
<name>myself</name>	myself	Archie	Nearly all my teachers were very disagreeable people, but I try all the time to make [MASK] and the children and other people happy. That’s what I live for, dear, and I think that’s what every woman wants to live for.
<name>Louise</name>	Louise	Bella	“Because everybody here,” I said, “does everything for everybody.” [MASK] looked at me out of the corners of her eyes. “Don’t get off any cracks, darling,” she said. “I do do everything for everybody.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Henry	“Well,” said [MASK], “I’ll see you around here sometime. We must get together.” As I sat down at the writing table, my mind was still occupied by the phrase he had used. It was really more applicable to life than it was to death.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Belle	Everything’s all right when he’s with me.” “Oh,” I said, “that’s fine. So you love him, do you, [MASK]?” “Yes,” she said, “I love him when he’s with me.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mary	Men don’t like it, and you don’t need to.” [MASK] laughed, a high, delighted laugh. “Don’t be so silly, dear,” she said. “I’m not running after him, he’s running after me.”
<name>Pat</name>	Pat	Jim	“It doesn’t do any good to lie like that, [MASK], just because no really fine novelist, no really worth-while writer, no really worthwhile anything, has ever honored you by his acquaintance.” “All right,” I said.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Bella	“No,” I said, “I’ve been abroad.” “You’re related to [MASK], aren’t you?” she asked. “You don’t look like any of the Brills.” And that was all I can remember.
<name>Genevieve</name>	Genevieve	Allen	“Yes,” 1 said, “she’s a shepherdess.” “And she’s so alone,” [MASK] said. “Has it ever occurred to you that she seems to be afraid of being alone?” “You may be right about that,” I answered.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Bella	Somebody must have been.” “What’s the matter with you?” [MASK] asked. “I’m trying to get things into some sort of order,” I said. “I’m trying to find out what the matter is with all of us.”
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Sid	“Of course,” I said, “[MASK] and the little girls had grown up, but it didn’t really make much difference because they were just what I had expected them to be. They had grown up, but they hadn’t changed at all.
<name>Roger</name>	Roger	Archie	There were all sorts of things that she wanted to do, and no one understood her except [MASK]—sometimes. She wanted to go out to the war and drive an ambulance, or perhaps to go on an exploring expedition. There must be all sorts of places where you could go.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Bella	It was clear enough, just then, why they had never got on together. There was something that did not mix, some lack of sym-3 80 pathy, which made them like two individuals speaking in different tongues. “I’m so ashamed,” [MASK] said.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Joe	“And I hired an airplane.” Suddenly he grinned at me. “And I was sick in one of those paper bags.” “Hire another, [MASK],” I said. “It’s the first break you’ve had in quite a while.”
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Clothilde	“It was all in the family Bible, the large one, the Breeches Bible. It isn’t my fault if I can’t remember where it was put, [MASK]. It always used to be in the cupboard by the back parlor fireplace.”
<name>Matilda</name>	Matilda	Bella	In [MASK]’s eyes and at the corners of her lips—she had been at work with her mother’s lipstick, which was of a slightly different color tone from hers—was the bright anticipatory look of one of our Wick-ford Point barn cats waiting for the wire mouse-trap to be opened.
<name>he</name>	he	Avery	Have you been out to see the tennis?” “No,” I said. “Have you?” “Yes,” [MASK] answered. “The tennis was very good this year.” I could not help but wonder about him and about his life.
<name>Jenkins</name>	Jenkins	Southby	I have given this a good deal of thought. It helps me to size up people. You can tell the fifty-thousand or the hundred-thousand-a-year man as easily as the ten-thousand. Yes, [MASK] is ten-thousand.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Harry	“It isn’t up to you,” he said, “to defend my sister’s reputation. It just happens that you don’t move around with anyone who matters. Now the question is just this.” [MASK] leveled his finger at me and shook it gently.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Clethra	“Common sense was just left out of them. [MASK] never understood where money came from, but she was worth it. She was the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen.” He paused because a clerk had come in from the outer office.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Harry	Now he’s trying to suck up to everyone. He knows you can’t refuse when he asks to go to a funeral.” “He never had any such idea,” I said. “Oh,” said [MASK], “didn’t he?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sue	She’s in the back parlor now, and no one else can make the flowers look well. I certainly don’t want [MASK] to try to do it, and I certainly don’t want that man to touch them. The whole place is full of flowers and they keep coming and coming.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bella	I thought—” “What did you think?” I asked. “Oh hell,” said [MASK], “I don’t know what I thought. Let’s forget about it. We’re having some people over for dinner, lots of people.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bella	“Everybody knows,” she began, and stopped. I turned away toward the telephone and I could hear her running out of the room. I could hear her footsteps on the stairs in cautious haste. [MASK] would be going to the extension in the upper hall.
<name>George</name>	George	Josie	I asked. “That kind of powder you put on the dishes,” [MASK] sa;d. “I asked that man if he could get me some this afternoon, but he forgot.” I took a ten-dollar bill from my pocket.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Sid	“Oh yes,” said [MASK], “yes, that. That was very interesting. Experiences like that are a very real help in finding out what I am finally going to do.” “Well,” I said, “I’m in a hurry.
<name>everyone</name>	everyone	Mary	Perhaps I’m getting old.” “No, you’re not,” I said. She looked surprisingly young. “Nothing was restful last night,” she said. “Everyone was moving about so. I don’t know why [MASK] couldn’t be still.
<name>Waldo</name>	Waldo	Clothilde	“Just by not trying,” he said. “The trouble with everyone here is that they try, except [MASK]. It’s always struggle, misdirected effort; and frankly, I’ve given up.” “Oh,” I said.
