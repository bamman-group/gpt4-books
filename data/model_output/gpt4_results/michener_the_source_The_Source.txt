<name>Aziza</name>	Aziza	Hoopoe	And seven came at the former slave with spears, and his powerful arms gathered them to his chest as flint sickles once gathered wheat, and he fell at the feet of the king, where he was stabbed many times until his blood flowed across the temple floor to where [MASK] lay.
<name>Yossi</name>	Yossi	Tabari	In a soft voice, barely audible above the November breeze that was coming down the wadi with the first hints of winter, [MASK] said, “You went to the beach, where the boats were filling up with Arab refugees, and you pleaded with every man you could reach: ‘Don’t run away.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Urbaal	The infant of months”—and here he looked at [MASK] and his wife—“is as notable a hero as the general of forty. Men are bom to die gloriously and those who do so as children achieve greatness earlier than we who grow older. For them we do not grieve.
<name>Boethius</name>	Boethius	Akiba	When his students, some of them hotheaded young men who were growing restless under Byzantine rule, brought the discussion down to the present, asking how he would behave toward the Byzantine invaders, he replied, without equivocation, “Study the final hours of [MASK].
<name>Livia</name>	Livia	Shelomith	[MASK] moves to my side, her right hand in mine. We watch the important men in short military skirts stride down the street and swing into the forum. Between the columns they march, not looking at our prison, and they head for the governor’s palace.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Judaism	In circulating this necessary but unpleasant letter we are not concerned with his faulty decision in the Damascus case. That was an error which can be forgiven. But we are concerned with the majesty of law as it operates to save [MASK].
<name>Enkidu</name>	Enkidu	Baal	But the third pagan he approached was a member of the great Family of Ur, and although this man had clung to [MASK] through many former vicissitudes, it now required him less than one second to decide in favor of the new religion. “I accept the Prophet!”
<name>Yahweh</name>	Yahweh	Rimmon	“What?” “This year we shall build our booth in the holy city.” “You?” the governor sputtered, then he asked, “Does [MASK] know of this?” “Not yet, but . . .”
<name>Yonatan</name>	Yonatan	Zaki	“This Pope promised. The next Pope can revoke,” [MASK] argued carefully. “But he gave the promise because he knew that we were baptized forcibly. We were never true Christians, and like the good man he is he has allowed us to be Jews again.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Urbaal	She was especially amusing when she described in a husky voice, which [MASK] relished, how the local priests had coached her to look shy: “Keep your fingertips close to your knees and your eyes lowered. When you look sideways try to press your chin into your shoulder.”
<name>Yigael</name>	Yigael	Eliav	“We’ve reached three major decisions about the kibbutz,” [MASK] explained as the group approached a large dining hall. “We won’t sleep here. We will eat here. And up till harvesting begins we’ll be allowed to employ the kibbutzniks on the dig.”
<name>Yaroslav</name>	Yaroslav	Ur	He sensed that he must be going, and although he felt a kind of animal fear of death, he found much joy in the fact that his son-in-law was such a stalwart hunter. The boy was swift and daring, as brave as [MASK] had hoped his own son would be.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Muzaffar	One of the Italians dashed back to the door of the church, screaming, “The infidels are upon us!” on which the others unsheathed their daggers and lunged at [MASK], slashing him severely across the right shoulder.
<name>Jose</name>	Jose	Shmuel	It was waiting for me, he told himself. It had been [MASK]’s intention to spend this lucky coin toward the purchase of his own home in the new settlement, and he had resisted all temptations to waste it otherwise, but now he was trapped.
<name>Waterloo</name>	Waterloo	Timri	“You were seven years old, and you cursed me, and was it not then that I spoke to you for the first time? On the morrow of [MASK] when your father was sleeping near the serpent that would have bitten him?”
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Leah	Oh, you rode so swiftly over the meadows and down the roads and when you came to a brook you would lean forward like this and spur your horse and . . . Oh!” [MASK] threw her hands in the air.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Rachel	“And he has agreed to let us go.” “Where?” “I’ve also been to see the captain and he has agreed . . .” “Where?” “There’s no turning back, [MASK],” the fat rabbi pleaded.
<name>John</name>	John	Tabari	How it eliminates some kinds of female cancer? How it insures better sexual relations in that it decreases man’s sexuality somewhat but increases his ability to perform well when he does?” “I never found that circumcision slowed me down,” [MASK] reported.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Mark	[MASK] heard rumors of his father’s expeditions but he ignored them, for in the barracks he had entered upon another area of argument among Christians, less critical perhaps than the first but of greater ultimate importance to him.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Tabari	“There was one additional factor,” [MASK] began hesitantly. “It doesn’t appear in official reports, but in this part of the world it was rather potent.” He leaned back, then continued, “Many Englishmen who came here had enjoyed homosexual experiences.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Menahem	“Your son? Found these?” Uneasily the big stonecutter mumbled, “The other children won’t play with [MASK]. He went digging . . . out there. Uncovered the end of one column. It wasn’t gold.” He waited apprehensively.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Vered	He made the marriage a deeply tender thing, a true religious ritual, and at the end he asked shyly, “Since there is no one to give away the bride, may I be permitted to kiss the beautiful lady?” He was barely as tall as [MASK].
<name>Kahlil</name>	Kahlil	Ur	There were dead trees in the wadi where bees kept their homes, and [MASK] sprang to his feet, chasing after the insect, for if he could keep pace with it he might find his next cache of honey.
<name>Youssef</name>	Youssef	Tabari	“Why?” “I’m taking the cabinet job. The prime minister announces it tomorrow. And my first appointment will be you. Director-general.” He extended his hand to the Arab. [MASK] drew back. “You know what you’re doing?”
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Gottesmann	When she saw [MASK] packing she said, “Don’t go,” and later, when he recalled that first meeting, he remembered principally the great tenseness of her mind and body. She stood forward against her toes, not back on her heels.
<name>them</name>	them	Jews	Their families argue that the girls should have died in their shame, and an uncle says that they should have cut off their arms before allowing [MASK] to see the uses to which they were put. What to do? Response: The law on this matter is so clear that any man can understand it.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Rachel	“[MASK] is sometimes a trial,” he muttered to himself, “but no man can desert his wife. Besides, she’s given me three lovely daughters.” For her sake he prayed that he could persuade her to leave the city.
<name>Vercingetorix</name>	Vercingetorix	Josephus	Could their roofs support fighters? Could their sides resist Roman siege engines? If they failed either test he said simply, “Tear them down.” To the homeless ones from outside the walls [MASK] said, “Sleep in the Roman temples. We are at war.”
<name>Irish</name>	Irish	Jews	She considered this and replied slowly, “We [MASK] always find it difficult to support our own people. We seem to prefer being governed by others.” Then she added, “It’s something you won’t understand.
<name>Zeus</name>	Zeus	Epiphanes	They found the name [MASK] to be especially arrogant—“God-Made-Manifest”—and they wondered how their Greek masters could delude themselves into believing such folly. They saw only an ordinary stone statue of an ordinary man, and they could not visualize him as a god.
<name>Torquemada</name>	Torquemada	John	[MASK], your Inquisition burned to death more than thirty thousand of our best Jews. I read the other day that a leading German had confessed that his nation had ‘treated the Jew rather badly.’ He had fallen back upon this inoffensive term to cover the destruction of a people.
<name>Adonai</name>	Adonai	Urbaal	They sent for their priests, and when these came in regalia the captain explained, “[MASK] is here, but this stranger refuses to deliver him.” “He has taken refuge at my altar,” the Habiru said.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Cullinane	“Of course.” “I’ve had a premonition recently that you might not be.” “How silly,” she said in Hebrew. The unexpected shift of language caught [MASK] off guard, as if she had winked at him or blown a kiss.
<name>David</name>	David	Menahem	“Without question.” “I could not be a Jew nor take part in any services.” [MASK] hesitated and said a boyish thing, recalling an old hurt, “When I was thirteen I was not allowed to read the Torah.”
<name>Leakey</name>	Leakey	Cullinane	the men of the Mount Carmel caves had produced flint stones with serrated edges that could be used for scraping skins, so it was likely that they had at least begun the tanning process. But the word skins conjured up related technical problems that were even more fascinating. It’s probable, [MASK] reasoned,
<name>Rosa</name>	Rosa	Cullinane	[MASK] asked, and the inevitable papers were pushed before him. “This my birth paper. Good Jewish parents. This my wedding paper. Signed by rabbi. This is a photograph my husband’s death paper. Notary public American here, rabbi’s name here.
<name>Kabbalah</name>	Kabbalah	Zohar	Ashkenazi legality versus Sephardi mysticism; or, to put it another way, the conservative force of the rabbi versus the expanding social vision of the community; or, the great restraining tendency of Talmud versus the explosive liberation of [MASK]. On these grounds the battle was fought.
<name>Zeus</name>	Zeus	Baal	The big temple was no more, for [MASK] resided on top of the mountain in the back of town, but there were homes for his priests, whose principal job was to guard the underground silos where grain was stored and the water cisterns where emergency supplies were kept in case of siege.
<name>Aslan</name>	Aslan	Gunter	“For the next two or three weeks [MASK] will remain preoccupied with cleaning out his well. But when that is done he shall have to turn to other matters.” Silence . . . “If I were you, I would place myself so that when he turns you are plainly visible.”
<name>Leila</name>	Leila	Leah	He rode along the olive groves on a horse. And once he met her at the door of the shop where clay goddesses were sold. He had an ingratiating smile and a generous manner, which [MASK] appreciated after the rough customs she had known in the desert.
<name>Yusuf</name>	Yusuf	Tabari	Such behavior was not surprising, for [MASK]’s brother-in-law had warned him that Arabs like the qadi and the mufti would be unhappy with a fellow Arab for kaimakam: “They’d prefer outsiders. A Bulgarian, for example.
<name>Yankel</name>	Yankel	Shmuel	When his arrival became known, representatives of the thirty families crowded into the small stone house attached to the synagogue to launch their protests. [MASK] said, “I’ve worked forty years building my shop. People won’t leave the town to buy bread.”
<name>Emmanuel</name>	Emmanuel	Gershom	Then [MASK] had arrived, empty-handed and without a history except for the charge of murder, and in simple words that soared through the dimly lit white-walled rooms and through the narrow alleys of the town itself he had stated that all she had been dreaming of was true.
<name>Giordano</name>	Giordano	Ximeno	He thought of [MASK] looking at him through the flames. “The Inquisition trapped him. Through what trick, I don’t know. They tore his joints apart, ripped out the lining of his throat, burned holes in his feet.
<name>Rommel</name>	Rommel	Reich	If [MASK] did suffer shock at seeing the Arab positions, he hid the fact. “Back to headquarters,” he snapped, and in the quiet hours of the night he held a commanders’ meeting that none who attended would ever forget.
<name>Hadrian</name>	Hadrian	Jerusalem	You’ve finished the town walls and you’re afraid that if you don’t start something right now [MASK] will take away your slaves. Isn’t that it?” “I’m concerned not about slaves but about the safety of my town.” He corrected himself.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Cullinane	refused to move. “No, [MASK]. It would be most improper for me to see her. Not at this point.” “You won’t talk to her?” “Look! I know more about her problem than she does. I sympathize.
<name>Eliezer</name>	Eliezer	Jehubabel	He wanted to believe that his pitiful remnant was not alone in that swamp. And then the voice came again: “[MASK], we know you are here. If you are zealous for the law, if you stand by the covenant, come out with us, for we are not a rabble.
<name>Lucius</name>	Lucius	Tarphon	And he accompanied his friend to the exit. But as they left the gymnasiarch’s room, from the other end of the building appeared a group of seven handsome young men—the athletes with whom [MASK] had been wrestling.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Vered	“Wait a minute! [MASK]’s a widow.” “More important, she’s a divorcee.” “I don’t get it.” “I knew her husband well. We fought together at many places ... a handsome, dashing young lady-killer.
<name>John</name>	John	Eliezer	Our children are happy here and we have a good life.” But [MASK] knew that she was not right. No life that involved the hatreds he had seen that day, even though no man had been killed or no house burned, could possibly be termed good.
<name>Thaddeus</name>	Thaddeus	Urbaal	[MASK] was a husky man, stout and strong as becomes a farmer, with big teeth that flashed when he smiled. Unlike others of his age, he was not bald nor was he inclined to fatness. In war he had proved himself a good soldier and in peace a productive farmer.
<name>Mithras</name>	Mithras	Baal	It was simplest, perhaps, to allocate the mystery to [MASK], who lay hidden in the‘earth under the Christian altar, for it could not have been by accident that the priests of the basilica had chosen that precise spot for the heart of their structure.
<name>Jews</name>	Jews	Jews	Because the soldier couldn’t be Jewish. He had to be an enemy. It’s no small thing to see a Jewish soldier, standing on his own soil, protecting [MASK] . . . not persecuting them.” More silence.
<name>Arvad</name>	Arvad	Urbaal	With an aching pain in his chest [MASK] led his two wives along the twisting street to the temple square, but before he entered that sacred place he took a deep breath, set his shoulders and did his best to quell the panic in his guts.
<name>Ali</name>	Ali	Elijah	“Now you’re as good a Jew as we are,” she said in good English. “What’s this about [MASK]?” he asked. “We’re marching to his cave,” she explained. “Where’s that?”
<name>Baruch</name>	Baruch	Aaron	She did not finish the sentence, for she knew how impossible it would be for her to prove that [MASK] was the murderer, and she foresaw that the rabbi could enlist a considerable pressure, forcing her finally to accept the red-stained master of the dye vats.
<name>Clasping</name>	Clasping	Yohanan	Clasping his knuckles firmly, until the tips of his fingers were white, he said, “Now come the difficult years, when those who break the law begin to reap their rewards.” “What do you mean?” [MASK] demanded.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Jael	[MASK] drew away from him, as people do instinctively from things they cannot understand, and as she left she asked, “Have you placed yourself against your brothers?” “They placed themselves against me. When I was born,” he replied.
<name>Enkidu</name>	Enkidu	Hoopoe	Bad luck brought an Aramaean to the eating place, and he ordered beer, which he drank in four huge draughts, throwing the last inch of liquid onto the pavement in front of [MASK]. “They don’t strain the husks out,” the Aramaean said, ordering a second jug.
<name>Moses</name>	Moses	Moses	As a result the Talmud would constitute an inexhaustible source of wisdom which men could study all the days of their lives, still finding rewards even if they lived, like [MASK], to be a hundred and twenty. One day in the year 335
<name>Yacoub</name>	Yacoub	Volkmar	He thanked the Mameluke officer for his courtesy and the former slave bowed, and as he did so [MASK] cried to his son, “Look! Look! There’s a Jew.” And for the first time in his life the boy saw a Jew.
<name>Maimonides</name>	Maimonides	Eliezer	The legal structure of Judaism was vanishing, and if this continued, the Jewish people must perish. For all such Jews, [MASK] would provide one massive book containing a summary of all law. His ambition was to save Judaism, no less.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Petronius	In the hot baths [MASK] muttered such prayers. But no solution came. Finally at one meeting he shouted at the Jews, “For weeks you meet with me and don’t even have the grace to bring before me the man who started all this.”
<name>Chaim</name>	Chaim	Eusebius	For a long moment [MASK] watched the punishment, then cried, “Enough!” But the culprit was dead. A great sigh rose from the assembled Jews, accented by the crackling of the flames and the hopeless shouts of the fire fighters.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Gottesmann	Instead, he drew up a chair and placed his fat hands on the table. “To tell the truth, [MASK], I don’t have much hope, either. That is, not unless a miracle happens. But I’m sure one will.”
<name>Justinian</name>	Justinian	Baal	As they knelt to do so the man of Ur stood aside at a spot from which he could see both the basilica where [MASK] lay buried and the top of the mountain where he reigned, and he reassured himself: It won’t be any more difficult under the Arabs than it was under the Byzantines.
<name>Mordecai</name>	Mordecai	Shmuel	The conflict became intensified when his parents wanted him to enter the yeshiva to prepare himself for a lifetime of study, since they recognized that he was an able boy. Again [MASK] refused, for he had already decided to enter some kind of business.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Shimrith	Whenever she was in sight he stared at her, lasciviously. Ignoring his own wife he tried to place himself so that [MASK] would have to pass close, and at each opportunity his red-stained hands reached for her legs.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Ur	They were two handsome men in the strong middle years of their lives: the ascetic Jew, tall and serious, with hollow cheeks and cautious manner; the man of [MASK], with his five children, heavier, browner, with a quicker wit and a more congenial smile.
<name>Reuven</name>	Reuven	Cullinane	[MASK] asked. “Simple. Judaism had its day, and if the Jews had been smart, when Christianity came along they’d have joined up. Christianity has had its day, and if you were intelligent you’d both join the newest religion. Islam!”
<name>Yossi</name>	Yossi	Tabari	“Yes,” the kibbutznik said. “I think I’ve found something,” and he handed [MASK] a coin, which later occasioned much debate at the mess. LEVEL 1! O ABOUT 1B75 C.E. Turkish cold coin
<name>Yossel</name>	Yossel	Eliezer	Then [MASK]’s dismay became unbelieving tragedy when the workmen ripped down the cupboard and shook it to dislodge the parchment scroll of Torah. As the holy book rolled in the dust, the destroyers kicked it toward the flames.
<name>McTeague</name>	McTeague	Ur	Once as [MASK] watched the two and saw the warm affection the bird had for his daughter, hopping after her on his one good leg and using the other as a balance, he threw his arms about the girl and cried for no apparent reason, “Soon you’ll have real babies of your own.
<name>Donoso</name>	Donoso	Jeremoth	And the soldiers embraced the governor and assured him that he had done right, and at the height of the celebration [MASK] stood under a flare and announced, “Old men and women built the walls. Young men shall defend them.”
<name>Francisco</name>	Francisco	Eusebius	[MASK] nodded. “In the years ahead many will use this church. Pilgrims from lands you’ve never heard of.” “But thirty homes!” “What would you prefer?” the Spaniard asked, endeavoring to be conciliatory yet determined to be firm.
<name>Nash</name>	Nash	Gimzo	and [MASK] replied, ‘I shall explain. There were two men on a roof, and they climbed down the chimney. One’s face became sooty. The other’s not. Which one washed his face?’ The Roman said, ‘That’s easy, the sooty one, of course.’
<name>Francisco</name>	Francisco	Rimmon	[MASK] stopped this argument by saying, “I was making faces at the water snake that slipped from the rock,” and his mother grew silent and moved closer to him, for the nearness of a poisonous snake was frightening when she knew that her son had been singled out for some austere purpose.
<name>Yoram</name>	Yoram	Eliav	How could there possibly be any empty space left?” “He’s probably right,” [MASK] confirmed, and the kibbutzniks dissected the theory for some time, concluding in the end that it could not have been a cave.
<name>Mariam</name>	Mariam	Timna	[MASK] began to scream, but her husband placed his hand over her mouth and the priest nodded his approval, carrying the child from the house. After a while the drumming resumed and cymbals clashed. A trumpet blew and excited mutterings were heard in the town.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Cullinane	all were reserved for the other group. “I doubt it’s as bad as you say,” [MASK] argued, “but let’s suppose that it’s half true. Who’s at fault?” “We’re not talking about fault, we’re talking about fact.
<name>Roark</name>	Roark	Meshab	“It’s very clever,” she said. “Your husband is the clever one,” [MASK] informed her. “I could go elsewhere now and dig another tunnel like this one, but I could never have foreseen the many little problems . . .”
<name>Chigurh</name>	Chigurh	Cullinane	Coming out of the desert and seeing our explosive richness . . . the greenness. His company had merely to march westward to the ocean and the land was theirs.” “How do you see it?” [MASK] asked. “Me?”
<name>Yael</name>	Yael	John	On the faces of our kids at the kibbutz, don’t you sense a kind of radiance? ‘We stand where the fires are hottest. We’re at the focus of forces.’ [MASK], don’t you sometimes see it on their faces?”
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Timna	Leaving [MASK] and the slave girl mourning at the altar of the fiery god, he moved into a front position among the crowd and saw for the first time the tall priestess Libamah appear through the temple doors, a living goddess moving with more than human grace.
<name>Islam</name>	Islam	Judaism	“You say you were lucky that in the critical years between 100 and 800 c.e. Christianity went forward, and we were unlucky that during the same years [MASK] went backward. Don’t you see that the real question is forward to what, backward to what?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Vered	He kissed her again and said most seriously, “[MASK], if he’s held back this long, why not marry a man who means business?” She hesitated, as if inviting him to kiss her again, then pushed him away.
<name>Vered</name>	Vered	Vered	She was unlike liana in that she dressed with the flair of a girl who enjoyed clothes, but she was obedient to the other rules of the sabra: no lipstick, no rouge, no shaving. She served as Palmach secretary and was known simply as [MASK], the Hebrew word for rose.
<name>Levi</name>	Levi	Hagarzi	In those years the Jews in cities like Gretz lived pretty much as they wished. Fanatic Christians sometimes howled against the commingling of Jew and Catholic, but no restrictive measures had yet been promulgated, so that a distinguished banker like [MASK] could be accepted as one of the city’s important citizens.
<name>Wells</name>	Wells	Stekelis	Such fractures were common throughout the world, but imbedded in his tilted areas [MASK] found parts of a skeleton and unmistakable tools of men who had been living before the upper soil had been laid down or the area tilted . . . say, a million years ago.
<name>McMahon</name>	McMahon	Cullinane	[MASK] asked. “Yes. I’m the only general in history to command four thousand one-man armies. We had Iraqi Arabs who had slipped in for the kill. We had Lebanese Arabs who had come down to open shops as soon as we had won.
<name>Yossi</name>	Yossi	Schwartz	As he sat down to dinner he saw before him a tureen of soup, some chunky meat, some butter ... He looked aghast at the combination of meat and butter and called for a waiter. He happened to get [MASK], the kibbutz secretary.
<name>Lucinda</name>	Lucinda	Gomer	[MASK] tried to pass the barrier but could not; her feet were nailed to the tunnel floor. “Are you Yahweh?” she asked. “I am that I am,” the voice replied, echoing from all sides.
<name>Yonatan</name>	Yonatan	Hoopoe	The warrior looked up at the enticing woman and smiled. “Help him to build his tunnel. When it’s finished the king will surely hear of it.” And before he fell asleep he pictured [MASK] on the hill, waving his arms.
<name>Yitzhak</name>	Yitzhak	Bagdadi	and with desperation the reinforced Jews rushed at the powerful concrete installation, again accomplishing nothing. The rain halted, and [MASK] promised, “Now we can explode the place,” but again the fuses failed to work and his valiant effort came to naught.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Ur	and he began to laugh, but as he did so a tiny pebble, scarce bigger than a bee’s wing, tumbled into the well and set up ripples which distorted the image of his face, and something in the way the water moved, taking his eyes and ears and mouth with it, frightened [MASK]
<name>Moses</name>	Moses	Moses	And I’m particularly covered by this injunction. Here [MASK] surely had me in mind: “And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall say, What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted? let him go and return unto his house . .
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	John	But from the bedrock of the tell, insofar as we can identify it, to the top, is a distance of seventy-one feet, and we have a right to suppose that many good things lie buried in that vast accumulation. [MASK] will explain what we’re going to do.”
<name>Ormazd</name>	Ormazd	Melak	Equally acceptable was the progression whereby [MASK]’s appetite had expanded from the blood of a pigeon to the burning of a dead sheep to the immolation of living children, for with each extension of his appetite he became more powerful and therefore more pleasing to the people he tyrannized.
<name>Yossi</name>	Yossi	Bagdadi	The Jew in charge therefore came up with an expedient that horrified [MASK]: before the davidka was fired, a length of ordinary fuse was jammed into the nose and lit with a match. Then the firing charge was ignited and the burning potato masher was sent through the air.
