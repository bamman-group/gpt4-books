<name>Olga</name>	Olga	Savi	The green table was also put in the hall, but in that jumble of unmatching furniture was scarcely noticeable. The rockingchair was taken to the verandah upstairs. [MASK] was pained to see the furniture so scattered and disregarded, and angered to see the rockingchair being misused almost at once.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Seth	But now in the shape and position of everything around him, the trees, the furniture, even those letters he had made with brush and ink, there was an alertness, an expectancy. [MASK] announced one Saturday that there were to be changes on the estate at the end of the crop season.
<name>He</name>	He	Anand	a penny. ‘I could keep it?’ ‘But is yours,’ the younger man said. ‘You find it.’ The game went on for some time. [MASK] found two more cents. Then the fat man appeared to lose interest.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Shama	He painted cool, ordered forest scenes, with gracefully curving grass, cultivated trees ringed with friendly serpents, and floors bright with perfect flowers; not the rotting, mosquito-infested jungle he could find within an hour’s walk. He attempted a portrait of [MASK].
<name>Maclain</name>	Maclain	Misir	You don’t know my family. I think we better leave them out.’ ‘This is a helluva man,’ [MASK] said. ‘You want to convert three hundred million Hindus and you let one backward litde family of country bookies frighten you?’
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Anand	‘Quick. Before they go to the theatre.’ [MASK] knew the Sunday routine: the bridge, the ping-pong, lunch, the sea, the shower, dinner, then the evening show. The cousins could be heard assembling in the diningroom.
<name>Galileo</name>	Galileo	Billy	You leaving. I come to move you. You got everything pack?” None of them had anything pack, and [MASK] start getting into one big temper, saying how they make him waste his time, and he was mad not to move them at all.
<name>Yanko</name>	Yanko	Bissoondaye	‘Boy, boy,’ the midwife cried. ‘But what sort of boy? Six-fingered, and bom in the wrong way.’ The old man groaned and [MASK] said, ‘I knew it. There is no luck for me.’
<name>Comrade</name>	Comrade	Mohun	He sucked his teeth, took a film booklet from the bookcase and flicked through it, breathing loudly, his small eyes intent, his prognathous sneer more pronounced. He threw the booklet back on the bookcase and said, ‘How is everything, [MASK]?’
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Anand	He wanted to climb mountains, to exhaust himself, to walk and walk and never return to the house, to the empty tent, the dead fire-holes, the disarrayed furniture. He left the wharves with [MASK] and they walked aimlessly through the city.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Kamla	‘Don’t leave us,’ [MASK] cried. All four children left the house and walked past the newly-forked land in front to the path that led to the road. Just below the brow of the hill they were surprised by an absolute darkness.
<name>Makola</name>	Makola	Moti	The anointing was repeated in the evening, when the sun had dropped and the surrounding bush had begun to sing. And it was at this time, some six months later, that [MASK] came to the shop and rapped hard on the counter.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Anand	‘All right,’ he said. ‘Going to get you a car.’ Immediately [MASK] broke away and ran back through the gate to the yard, riding an imaginary horse, wielding an imaginary whip and shouting, ‘And I going to get a car!
<name>Lennox</name>	Lennox	Jagdat	‘Hear him,’ [MASK] said. ‘But don’t give me that, eh, man. Listen. I was driving motorcars before you even learn to drive a donkey-cart. Look at me. You think I pining to drive in your sardine can?
<name>Crusoe</name>	Crusoe	Govind	Abruptly the bawling ceased. ‘Yes, is he!’ the god said. ‘Is he. He asking for this a long time now.’ And at every cuff and kick [MASK] gave, the god grunted, as though he himself had given the blow.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Shama	He didn’t say. It was something that concerned him alone. By speaking of it he would have exposed himself to the disregard of [MASK] and the children; he would also have involved them in his own humiliation.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Seth	Look at me. I look like [MASK]? You could look at me and say that this is my sort of work?’ He came back from the fields sweated, itching and dusty, bitten by flies and other insects, his skin tom and tender.
<name>France</name>	France	Tobago	It seemed there was no one in the world but themselves, nothing alive but themselves and the sea and the wind. They had been told that on a clear day they could see [MASK]; but that never happened.
<name>Titus</name>	Titus	Anand	‘Go on, haul your little tail.’ ‘Is not your road,’ [MASK] said. ‘Is the PWD road.’ ‘So you is a smart man into the bargain? Who the hell you think you talking to?’ The fat man rose.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Tara	Her breathing had grown worse and she couldn’t move about easily; her body had broadened and become slack; her hair had thinned; her eyes had lost their brightness. The servant girl brought him a cup of tea and [MASK] followed the girl back to the kitchen.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Shama	Roman Catholic, that’s what she is!’ ‘Why don’t you shut your mouth?’ [MASK] tried to sound amused, but he could tell that she was getting angry. ‘Ro-man Cat-o-lic! Roman cat, the bitch.
<name>He</name>	He	Shekhar	He told stories about civil servants, spoke of the trouble he had making up his expense sheets, the work he had looking for work. But soon he made his annoyance plain. ‘You take these things too personally,’ [MASK] said, still playing the game.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Edgar	‘But he a litde too erratic and don’t-care. [MASK], now, does do the work of two men. The only trouble is, you got to keep a eye on him all the time. Look at him.’
<name>He</name>	He	Shama	‘That is the whole blasted trouble,’ he said. ‘I don’t look like anything at all. Shopkeeper, lawyer, doctor, labourer, overseer - I don’t look like any of them.’ The Samuel Smiles depression fell on him. [MASK] was a puzzle.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Shama	‘They must be so used by now to seeing you with a water-set in your hand that I am sure they would believe that you did carry one.’ ‘I know what I am doing,’ [MASK] said.
<name>Rose</name>	Rose	Govind	It could no longer be forded by the car, and the car stayed on the road. The sisters were puzzled by the erosion, which seemed to them sudden; but they accepted it as part of their new fate. [MASK] stopped looking after the cows.
<name>Indian</name>	Indian	Tulsi	In the store the [MASK] name had been replaced by the Scottish name of a Port of Spain firm, and this name had been spoken for so long that it now fully belonged and no one was aware of any incongruity.
<name>Alcina</name>	Alcina	Shama	[MASK] had maintained her martyr’s attitude throughout, sitting on the low bench, her skirt draped over her knees, one hand supporting her chin, her staring eyes misting over with tears. ‘Spitting on me, eh?’ the god said. ‘Go ahead.
<name>Bless</name>	Bless	Mark	‘[MASK] you, the teacher knows his stuff.’ But he couldn’t keep this up. ‘Careless boy, too, you know. Left out one whole question. In the spelling paper. Synonyms and homonyms.’ He began to lose his audience.
<name>He</name>	He	Anand	The little thug. He joined a group of fatherless who had gathered around the class-teacher. No longer posing for the Daddies or one another, they were anxious, excited and shrill. [MASK] avoided them when he came out.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Lakshmi	‘You can’t call me a labourer either.’ ‘They could bring you up for this.’ ‘Let them try.’ ‘You better go now, man.’ The baby was stirring. ‘Hello, [MASK].’
<name>Chinonso</name>	Chinonso	Chinta	That is the only way your mother’s family like to get their fat little hands dirty. Look, the next time [MASK] or anybody else says I am a grass-cutter, you just tell them that it is better to be a grass-cutter than a crab-catcher.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Savi	‘What’s the matter?’ ‘The heat,’ [MASK] said. ‘You just carry on. See if you don’t get hot somewhere else. Clowns. That’s what I’m raising. A pack of clowns.’
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Tara	There was more advice from the men. ‘Make them look at the coffin.’ ‘At the mother.’ ‘At the youngest boy.’ The photographer settled the matter by telling [MASK], ‘Tell them to look at me.’
<name>Leiningen</name>	Leiningen	Anand	Lightning, flashing inter-mittendy, steel-blue exploding into white, showed the ants continually disarrayed, continually re-forming. Then [MASK] saw a light swaying in the dark. It was a man, bending forward against the rain, a hurricane lamp in one hand, a cutlass in the other.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Mohun	He was passing a curtained doorway when a shrill voice cried out, almost gaily, ‘[MASK]!’ He felt he had become a boy again. All the sense of weakness and shame returned. It was a low, windowless room, lit only by the light from the passage.
<name>Quarrell</name>	Quarrell	Seth	But [MASK]’s irritability had disappeared. He took out the ivory cigarette holder which had been pushing up through the buttoned flap of the pocket on his khaki shirt, put it in his mouth and blew whistlingly through it.
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Shama	He felt her standing at the side of the fourposter, looking down at him. He stiffened; his breathing changed. ‘Well, you make me really proud of you today,’ [MASK] said. And, really, it wasn’t what he was expecting at all.
<name>Yash</name>	Yash	Shama	‘No, the both of you go.’ To [MASK], who began to complain of his ‘strictness’ — a word which gave him a curious satisfaction - he said, ‘It is not strictness. It is training.’
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Anand	And there was hi i hope that living in a new house in the new year might brng about a new state of mind. He if he had been alone, for he feared solitude more than people. But, with [MASK], he had enough company.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Shama	‘Who you writing to?’ She couldn’t read more, for beyond the first line the handwriting had deteriorated into a racing scrawl. He didn’t reply. For some time, until the position became uncomfortable for [MASK], they remained like that, silent.
<name>Kim</name>	Kim	punditji	He tied the almanac together and rolled it in the red cotton wrapper which was also spattered with sandalwood paste. ‘I believe that is all.’ ‘We forgot one thing, [MASK]. The name.’ ‘I can’t help you completely there.
<name>Antonio</name>	Antonio	Shama	‘She is not a old hen at all. Nor a old cow.’ ‘I glad you learning gratitude,’ [MASK] said. ‘She is a she-fox. A old she-fox. What they call that? You know what I mean, man.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Shama	He gave himself a longer midday break and stayed later in the office in the afternoons. Then once more [MASK] started to bring out her account books, and once more she showed how impossible it was for them to live on what he earned.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Savi	She wept over her plate. Later she wept over the washingup, repeatedly interrupting her tears, first to blow her nose, then to sing sad songs softly, and finally to ask about [MASK]’s behaviour during the week.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Dehuti	It was altogether less depressing than the crumbling, neglected hut in the back trace. But it seemed that to [MASK] marriage had brought no joy. She was uneasy at being caught among her household possessions, and tried to hint that they had nothing to do with her.
<name>Moses</name>	Moses	Shama	You know the government and nobody else did want to believe that 1 was even born. People had to swear and sign all sort of paper.’ ‘All of we was register,’ [MASK] said. ‘All of all-you would be register.’
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Anand	As usual, it turned out that she did have some money. ‘How much you want?’ [MASK] calculated. Adult, twelve cents, children, half price. Just to make sure, however, he said, ‘Thirty-six cents.’
<name>Anancy</name>	Anancy	Shama	He walked slowly around the brass plate. ‘Walk,’ [MASK] said. ‘You walk until you tired. But wait until you provide your own food before you start criticizing the food other people give you.’ ‘Who give you that message to give me?
<name>Leila</name>	Leila	Ajodha	The top shelves of the bookcase were still packed with the disintegrating volumes of The Book of Comprehensive Knowledge, for which [MASK] had not paid. The lower shelves contained magazines, motor manufacturers’ catalogues and illustrated trilingual souvenir booklets of Indian films.
<name>Clive</name>	Clive	Shama	In the days that followed they made more discoveries. The landing pillars had rotted because they stood next to a tap which emerged from the back wall of the house. The water from the tap simply ran into the ground. [MASK] spoke about the possibility of subsidence.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Anand	The error had been acknowledged. ‘What about it, boy?’ he said to [MASK] later that day. ‘Series of letters. To a doctor. A judge. Businessman, editor. Brother-in-law, mother-in-law.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Seth	‘The child,’ he said desperately. ‘What about the child?’ ‘What about her?’ [MASK] said. ‘She is a good child. A litde bit of reading and writing even.’
<name>Samuel</name>	Samuel	Govind	‘They paying me enough.’ ‘So you say. But those people are bloodsuckers, man. Rather than work for them, I would catch crab or sell coconut.’ At the mention of his former profession [MASK] gave a nervous laugh and swung his legs agitatedly.
<name>Rosaura</name>	Rosaura	Lena	[MASK], va a llamarle. Vamos, vamos. Es demasiado tarde. Well, all right, people,’ she would say, turning to the outraged sisters and the wondering readers and learners, ‘we got to go.’
<name>Arjun</name>	Arjun	Anand	‘You did your best. And no true effort is ever wasted. Remember that.’ ‘What about you?’ [MASK] said. And though they slept on the same bed, neither spoke to the other for the rest of the evening.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Seth	There was little need for her to worry. For some time after the death of his wife [MASK] had acted wildly. He had been charged with wounding and using insulting behaviour, and had lost much local support. His skills appeared to have left him as well.
<name>Manuel</name>	Manuel	Ghany	‘It must be that.’ ‘All right,’ [MASK] said. ‘Eighth ofjune. Who to tell you no?’ Smiling, he put a hand to the drawer of his table and pulled it this way and that before it came out.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Anand	Then he saw that on the geography paper [MASK] had written his initials elaborately, outlining them in pencil, shading them in pencil; and this dismayed him entirely. The afternoon session was shorter, and at the end of it few Daddies were in the schoolyard.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Boss	‘[MASK], I know you want pitchpine for the floor. I know pitchpine nice. It does look nice and it does smell nice and it easy to keep clean. But you know it does burn easy. Easy, easy.’
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Tara	He entered by the side gate. From the cowpen came a familiar early evening sound: the unhurried stir and rustle of cows in stalls laid with fresh straw. The back verandah outside [MASK]’s kitchen was warm with light. He heard the steady drone of someone reading aloud.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Shama	He stooped to pick the books up, then decided it would be a sign of self contempt to do so. Better for them to lie like that for [MASK] to see and even rearrange. He passed a hand over his face. It felt heavy and dead.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Dhari	‘Don’t provoke him.’ Then, as though it not only belittled [MASK]’s behaviour but gave protection to them all, she added, ‘He is only after your father’s money. Let him look.’
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Georgie	It rattled and glittered; it was hung on the inside with strings of tin cups. ‘Is about a house.’ ‘Oh. Repairs?’ ‘Not exactly. It ain’t build yet. As a matter of fact —’ ‘[MASK]!’
<name>Chichikov</name>	Chichikov	Mungroo	‘He want to see you now.’ ‘Just let me get this straight. [MASK] owe me money. I say so and I damage his credit. So now he can’t go around taking goods on trust and not paying. So he bring me up.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Shekhar	To fix up [MASK]. One to an editor. Fix up the Sentinel. Publish them as a booklet. Dedicate it to you.’ But the wound was still there, too deep for anger or thoughts of retribution. What had happened was locked away in time.
<name>Chike</name>	Chike	Anand	Somebody else to get a share of your father’s property.’ And they told [MASK], ‘You are lucky. You are still the only boy. But wait. One day you will get a brother, and he will cut off your nose.’
<name>Ratan</name>	Ratan	Raghu	If you do anything stupid now the responsibility will be yours.’ From his string bed the old man muttered abuse at [MASK]. ‘Shameless, wicked. When I see the behaviour of this man I begin to feel that the Black Age has come.’
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Shama	The fourposter, [MASK]’s dressingtable, the bookcase and desk and the table were in this room; the rest of his furniture, rockingchair, hatrack, kitchen safe, was disposed, like his children at night, about the house.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Tara	The absurd story he had just made up didn’t sound convincing, and he hoped he would be allowed to drop it. ‘And how was your mother?’ [MASK] asked. ‘I heard nothing.’ ‘Oh, she. She was all right.
<name>Olivia</name>	Olivia	Govind	It was left to the sisters to comment on [MASK]’s behaviour. There were times when she wished to have children about her. Then she summoned the readers and learners to scrub the floor of the drawingroom and verandah, or she made them sing Hindi hymns.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Anand	At last they found one which was suitable. On a high red stool, a revelation and luxury in itself, [MASK] sat at the counter, and the icecream came. In a cardboard tub, frosted, cold to the touch. With a wooden spoon.
<name>Margo</name>	Margo	Shama	They pushed coconut branches and coconut shells and bits of driftwood under the wheels and at last got the car out. [MASK] said she was convinced that the car now leaned to one side; the whole body, she said, had been strained.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Vidiadhar	For he had not won an exhibition, [MASK] who had brought home clean question papers with ticks beside the questions he had done and a neat list of correct answers to the arithmetic sums, who had begun to leam Latin and French, who had gone to the intercollegiate football match and uttered partisan cries.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Bhandat	The woman ran to the bed and opened her mouth wide. No words came out of that mouth: only a clacking of the tongue that erupted, at the end, into a shrill croak. The tea had spilled on the bed, on [MASK].
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Seth	And [MASK]. Rough and managerial in his khaki uniform and heavy bruised bluchers, the ivory cigarette holder held down in one shirt pocket by the buttoned flap. He saw it clearly. For what seemed a long time he contemplated it.
<name>he</name>	he	Anand	The exhibition candidates, prepared for years for the sacrificial day, had all come dressed for the sacrifice. They all wore serge shorts, white shirts and school ties, and [MASK] could only guess at what charms these clothes concealed. Their pockets were stuffed with pens and pencils.
<name>Esteban</name>	Esteban	Savi	‘You know what your father was doing when I pick him up and marry him to your mother? You know? He tell you? He wasn’t even catching crab. He was just catching flies.’ ‘[MASK]!
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Dehuti	I didn’t want it. I wish you would stop running round giving people the idea that I have modem ambitions.’ He laughed uneasily and scratched his bare leg; the nails left white marks. ‘I have no hat to hang on a hatrack,’ [MASK] said.
<name>K</name>	K	Seebaran	And one of the best lawyers here too, I can tell you. We should be proud of him. The man who was here before you - what’s his name? - anyway, the man before you had a lot to thank [MASK] for.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Shama	He had built his own house, in a place as wild and out-of-the-way as he could have wished. But [MASK] had to walk a mile to the village to do her shopping, water had to be brought up the hill from a spring in the cocoa woods.
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Dhari	Carefully he unbolted the small window, then pushed it out with sudden vigour. The garden was lit up by a hurricane lamp. A man was working a fork into the ground among the bottle-borders. ‘[MASK]!’
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Shama	At the end of the first month he found he had made the vast profit of thirty-seven dollars. He knew nothing about keeping books and it was [MASK] who had suggested that he should make notes of goods given on credit on squares of brown shop-paper.
<name>Queenie</name>	Queenie	Shama	‘I going to take this money and pay down right away on the house I want to buy,’ the solicitor’s clerk said. ‘Wait until the old queen hear. She going to be so glad.’ When [MASK] heard she burst into tears.
<name>Really</name>	Really	Registry	‘And what sort of dowry did they give you?’ she asked. ‘Dowry? They are not so oldfashioned. They didn’t give me a penny.’ ‘[MASK]?’ He bit at a slice of pickled mango and nodded.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sushila	Her only solace was talk. Daughters were always at hand, but talk with them seemed only to enrage her; and as her body decayed so her command of invective and obscenity developed. Her rages fell oftenest on [MASK], whom she ordered out of the house once a week.
<name>Rosa</name>	Rosa	Bipti	The blanket was hairy and prickly; it seemed to be the source of the raw, fresh smell he had been smelling all day. [MASK] let him scream until he was tired and fell asleep in the yellow, wavering light of the oil lamp which left the comers in darkness.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Anand	They were the exhibition results. In a page of names the name stood out. [MASK] had been placed third, had got one of the twelve exhibitions. As bewitching as the news was the generosity with which it was welcomed by the older members of the staff.
<name>Shekhar</name>	Shekhar	Owad	They were brighter and talked more easily. Then they were silent. The men had returned. They heard their loud talk, their footsteps; [MASK]’s voice raised in friendliness, breaking into laughter; the light inquiries from aunts; Shekhar’s goodbyes, his car driving off.
<name>Anand</name>	Anand	Chinta	She looked unhappy. ‘Anand upstairs.’ When they were halfway up she whispered, ‘He kneeling down.’ In the hall [MASK] was singing. ‘Kneeling down? What for?’ ‘He mess up himself at school today and had to leave.’
<name>Annie</name>	Annie	Basdai	News of her advance and her pause to break a whip from the neem tree at the side of the yard was relayed by hoots and shouts and giggles. Some orphans, disdaining to run, were flogged on the pavement. There was crying, and [MASK] said, ‘Well, some people satisfy now.’
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Shama	‘If they did just push me so much farther,’ he told [MASK], ‘I would have resigned.’ ‘Yes. You would have resigned.’ ‘Sometimes I don’t know why the hell I ever bother to talk to you.’
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Ramchand	He thought of taking up sign-writing again. But how was he to go about it? Could he simply put up a sign in front of the house and wait? [MASK] said, ‘Why you don’t try to get a job in the Mad House?
<name>Ram</name>	Ram	Jairam	[MASK] stood scowling in the doorway. ‘You are no Brahmin,’ he said. ‘I take you into my house and show you every consideration. I do not ask for gratitude. But you are trying to destroy me. Go and look at your work.’
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Savi	She also burned certain evil-smelling herbs to purify and protect the house. ‘[MASK],’ the children said, ‘something happen to your pappa.’ And they stuck pins in the wicks of lamps to keep misfortune and death away.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Savi	They were considered beautiful; though the sentiments, from a man long thought to be an atheist, caused some astonishment. The placards were hung in the hall and the Book Room, and when the children said, ‘[MASK], your pappa did really paint those signs?’
<name>Spenser</name>	Spenser	Wordsworth	But when he thought of the land as the site of his house, the trees did not seem unfriendly; and he liked to think of the spot as a ‘bower’, a word that had come to him from [MASK] by way of the Royal Reader.
<name>Wenceslas</name>	Wenceslas	Hanuman	A large red advertisement for Bata shoes hung below the statue of [MASK], and the store was bright and busy. But at the back the house was dead. The courtyard was littered with packing cases, straw, large sheets of stiff brown paper, and cheap untreated kitchen furniture.
<name>Myra</name>	Myra	Kamla	He could not fully understand it, but it was his habit whenever he bought anything new, whether a pair of shoes or a bottle of patent medicine, to read all the literature provided. [MASK] came into the room and said that the orphans had been fingering the car and blurring the shine.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Anand	There was excitement among them, not only at the unusual weather and unexpected holiday, but also at the overnight disturbance. Some had memories of being awakened briefly during the night; now [MASK] was with them and his father was in the Blue Room.
