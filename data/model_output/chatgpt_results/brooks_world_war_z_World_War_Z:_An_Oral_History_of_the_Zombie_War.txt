<name>zombies</name>	zombies	Fragmuts	We never got them. “A waste of valuable resources.” Cocksuckers. Putting a wounded soldier out of his misery was a waste but turning them into [MASK], now, that they’d consider! Excuse me?
<name>Cheng</name>	Cheng	Zheng	A half second later, the Admiral [MASK]’s foghorn sounded. As we raced back to the boat, my wall of calm, my sense of security, came crashing down around me. I knew that missile had come from one of our subs.
<name>reinforcements</name>	reinforcements	Zack	Maybe it wouldn’t have turned the tide ... but... Goddammit! The fire was dying, [MASK] was still coming ... and the fear . .. everyone was feeling it, in the orders from the squad leaders, in the actions of the men around me . . .
<name>Ellis</name>	Ellis	Renard	The bottle in [MASK]’s hand might be the last of its kind, the perfect symbol of a world we might never see again. It was the only personal item he’d managed to save during the evacuation. He carried it with him everywhere, and was planning to save it for .. .
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Sinclair	“They don’t need fish,” [MASK] used to say, “they need fishing poles.” Still, every autumn, we dropped a lot of fish, and wheat, and salt, and dried vegetables and baby formula... Winters were hard.
<name>Dragonfire</name>	Dragonfire	Zeus	[MASK] was originally designed for munitions clearing, zapping land mines and unexploded bombs. It was small and light enough to be mounted in a specialized Humvee. The gunner sighted a target through a coaxial camera in the turret.
<name>Doc</name>	Doc	Mets	I started limping, splashing away with upwards of a hundred Gs on my ass. It must have been comical, this frantic race of cripples. [MASK] yelled, “If you can stand on it, you can run on it! It’s not a weightbearing bone!
<name>He</name>	He	Xu	His wife had left him in the early eighties. It was a devastating scandal, especially in those days. It still astounds me how he managed to both salvage his career and raise his son. He had a son? Did he come with you? [[MASK] evades the question.]
<name>the virus</name>	the virus	Zack	That’s how [MASK] operated, swelling his ranks by thinning ours! And it only worked one way. Infect a human, he becomes a zombie. Kill a zombie, he becomes a corpse. We could only get weaker, while they might actually get stronger.
<name>Bath</name>	Bath	Rodina	He even went so far as to recommend him for a first-class Order of the [MASK]. You can’t stop the rumors, and nothing is worse for a unit’s morale than to know that one of their officers had deserted.
<name>Eckhart</name>	Eckhart	Ivan	The only reason [MASK] ended his program was the same reason we never began ours: the situation was no longer desperate enough. How fucking desperate do you have to be? They’ll never say it, but I think what stopped them was the threat of another Eckhart incident.
<name>Tris</name>	Tris	Sharon	[She makes the sound of gunfire then . . .] “I won’t let them get you, I won’t let them get you.” [[MASK] suddenly looks away, over my shoulder to something that isn’t there.] “The children!
<name>biomed</name>	biomed	Phalanx	That’s all I was selling. Hell, because of [MASK], the biomed sector started to recover, which, in turn, jump-started the stock market, which then gave the impression of a recovery, which then restored consumer confidence to stimulate an actual recovery!
<name>Baker</name>	Baker	Eckhart	The swarm was only a few steps away. [MASK] grabbed a rifle, tried to go out after him. Some officer got in her face, started spouting regs and half-assed justifications. She emptied half a clip in his mouth.
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Zack	[Strokes the back of her neck.] [To me.] By the time [MASK] got back up, you’d bought yourself five, maybe ten, fifteen seconds. We had our share of casualties. Some Ks would have a fall, break a bone ...
<name>youngest</name>	youngest	smallest	If you had given each citizen a gun, a rock, or even their bare hands, pointed them at approaching zombies and said “Fight!” they would have done so down to the oldest woman and [MASK] tot.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Darnell	The ability to go through a pipe, an airshaft, in between walls, whatever, without losing their cool, was a major survival asset. [We are interrupted. As it on cue, a dog limps over to [MASK]'s side. She is old.
<name>the enemy</name>	the enemy	Zack	It’s a lot like what they teach you in the civilian manual: movement, stealth, how to take out [MASK] before he can howl your position. We all “made it,” lived, I mean, although a couple of pilots washed out on a 4.
<name>Rick</name>	Rick	Hill	1 warned him that when the hordes of starving refugees showed up to finish what the living dead started, he’d have no government protection whatsoever. [MASK] was a brave, stubborn bastard, but he wasn’t an idiot.
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Mets	or something like that, pushing me to get a move on. I told her to just wait a minute, I leaned my head against the driver’s side window, I sighed and felt beat again, drained. [MASK] got on my ass, pushing me.
<name>my partners</name>	my partners	Graziela	Now it was my turn to get slapped, several times by [MASK], before I came to my senses and telephoned the police. Were you arrested? Are you crazy? These were my partners, how do you think I was able to get my homegrown organs.
<name>Necrophilia</name>	Necrophilia	Horseshit	I’m addicted to murder, and that’s about the nicest way I can put it. You might say that’s not technically true, that since they’re already dead I’m not really killing. [MASK]; it’s murder, and it’s a rush like nothing else.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Mets	I saw something up ahead, a lump that was almost a thicket, but too boxy and shining in places. I reported it to [MASK]. She warned me not to go near it, keep on going and keep my eyes on the prize.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Slug	[MASK] from a high-powered hunting rifle. I never complained about our hard covers anymore after that. The gang in the tower, they had their little kingdom, and they weren’t giving it up for anyone.
<name>Zombie</name>	Zombie	Zack	Whenever you spotted [MASK], either in a group or just on his own, a FAR unit would halt... FAR? Force Appropriate Response. You couldn’t stop, like, the whole Army Group, for one or two zombies.
<name>Mommy</name>	Mommy	Abbie	She balls her hands into a large double fist, bringing it down hard on an invisible form.] Now the kids started crying. [She simulates stabbing, punching, striking with objects.] [MASK] cried hard.
<name>Bella</name>	Bella	Perdy	Fourteen times they chased off feral packs, twice they really got into it. I watched [MASK] go after this two-hundred-pound mastiff, grab its skull in her jaws, you could actually hear the crack over the harness’s surveillance mic.
<name>101</name>	101	Dax	Now, this is the only one left.l They never get enough credit, I think. There is that story [MASK], nice little children’s book, but it’s pretty simplistic, and it’s only about one Dalmatian that helped an orphan kid find his way to safety.
<name>zombies</name>	zombies	Zack	I can’t believe I was still standing when [MASK] began to show up. It was just a trickle at first, ones and twos staggering between the abandoned cars that jammed the deserted freeway. At least the refugees had been evacuated. Okay, that was another thing they did right.
<name>the FBI</name>	the FBI	Honolulu	What? They never found her. No. Or the cabin. No. And [MASK] never had any record of a Skywatcher with the call sign Mets Fan. You’ve done your homework. I... You probably also read my after-action report, right?
<name>JSOW</name>	JSOW	JSOW	And that was when the line collapsed. I don’t remember it all at once. I see these flashes: people running, grunts, reporters. I remember a newsman 4- JSF: Joint Strike Fighters. 5. [MASK]: Joint Standoff Weapon.
<name>you</name>	you	Zack	The initial induction was the first and most important phase. You took a group of pups, a random group, or even a whole litter, put them in a room divided by a wire mesh. They’re on one side, [MASK]’s on the other.
<name>Chief Bromden</name>	Chief Bromden	Oliveira	He’d stay and watch him and call me if there was any change. [[MASK] purses his Ups angrily and chews another wad of the mysterious leaves at his side.] And what was I supposed to think? Maybe it was the drugs, the OKT 3.
<name>Porfirio Díaz</name>	Porfirio Díaz	Pinochet	Maybe in the end, they had brought justice for the future. Now, my people have little love for the northern gringos, and my family suffered enough under [MASK] to make that animosity personal, but there comes a point where private emotions must give way to objective facts.
<name>British</name>	British	Canadian	I turned to look at him and was surprised to see a white man, American maybe, or [MASK] . .. no, he had to be American, his English was too loud. “C’mon, I’m fine!” He shouted and struggled.
<name>Hitler</name>	Hitler	Redeker	There was another reason for this partial evacuation, an eminently logical and insidiously dark reason that, many believe, will forever ensure [MASK] the tallest pedestal in the pantheon of hell. Those who were left behind were to be herded into special isolated zones.
<name>Picasso</name>	Picasso	Song	The only way to quell any further “dangerous thought” was to replace speculation with hard facts. We’d been in total blackout for almost a hundred days and nights. We needed to know what was happening, even if it was as dark and hopeless as [MASK]’s painting.
<name>Powerloader</name>	Powerloader	G	You either had four-pronged claws or simple, industrial pincers. Both worked as hand-to-hand weapons—just grab a [MASK]’s head and squeeze—but they made it impossible to fire a gun. The M-9 was fixed to your forearm and could be fired electrically.
<name>Zombie</name>	Zombie	Zombies	The bottom churns up, your visibility is shot, like fighting inside a glass of milk. [MASK] don’t just die when you hit them, most of the time they disintegrate, fragments of muscle, organ, brain matter, mixed up with the silt and swirling around you.
<name>Brian</name>	Brian	Aiden’d	He had the volume jacked up too high. I kept telling him he had to get his hearing checked, you just don’t spend your twenties in a speed metal band without ... (sighs!. [MASK] heard something. He asked me what it was.
<name>Zaroff</name>	Zaroff	Zack	How else could you have sent them on so many different missions? There were Lures, the kind that the Battle of Hope made famous. Pretty simple stuff; your partner hunts for [MASK], then leads him into our firing line.
<name>Washington</name>	Washington	Azania	The embrace by our nation’s father, this genuine emotion piercing his impenetrable shell. .. [[MASK] smiles sheepishly.] Perhaps this is all too sentimental. For all we know he was a heartless monster, and the old man’s embrace had absolutely no impact.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	WRP	Although [MASK] claims to have made substantial progress, none can claim to see any end in sight.] I don’t blame them, the government, the people who were supposed to protect us. Objectively, I guess I can understand.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Stick	She laughed and said, “Don’t worry, honey. I have. [MASK] with me and I’ll get you home.” And I did. I stayed away from anything even resembling a road and stuck to as pure a wilderness track as I could.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Mets	I felt good again, strong and confident. [MASK] warned me that all these distractions had erased any chance of making it to the 1-10 before nightfall, and that I should probably start thinking about where I was gonna catch my forty.
<name>Roxy</name>	Roxy	MPs	Some officer got in her face, started spouting regs and half-assed justifications. She emptied half a clip in his mouth. [MASK] tackled her ass, held her on the ground. She could hear everything as the dead surrounded her partner. What happened?
<name>Rocky</name>	Rocky	Zack	I was, like, “C’mon, [MASK], let’s fuckin’ do this!” Just before they reached the front range marker, the music began to fade. The squad leaders shouted, “Front rank, ready!” and the first line knelt.
<name>the drug</name>	the drug	Phalanx	OH! [He stands, mimes the act of frantic fornication.] God freakin’ bless that dumbass, whoever he was. But that wasn’t because of [MASK]. Your drug didn't protect people at all. It protected them from their fears.
<name>Scrapyard</name>	Scrapyard	Alang	I’d expected to find a construction site cranking out hull after hull to carry us all to safety. I had no idea that it was just the opposite. [MASK] didn’t build ships, it killed them. Before the war, it was the largest breakers yard in the world.
<name>John</name>	John	Redeker	Sacrificed? [MASK] believed that to try to protect everyone would stretch the government’s resources to the breaking point, thus dooming the entire population. He compared it to survivors from a sinking ship capsizing a lifeboat that simply did not have room for them all.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Something	[MASK] grabbed me from behind, pulled at my collar, tore the fabric. I spun, ducked, and kicked hard. He was large, larger and heavier than me by a few kilos. Black fluid ran down the front of his white shirt.
<name>Captain</name>	Captain	Choi	[We hit the whitecaps with a jarring thud. [MASK] grins, checks his instruments, and shifts the channels on his radio from me to the mother ship. The water before my observation dome froths white for a second, then gives way to light blue as we submerge.]
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Mets	I took my time, checked my remaining ammo and waited for the next wave to come. None did. It was another twenty minutes before [MASK] asked me for an update. I gave her a body count and she told me to remind her never to piss me off.
<name>Sergeant</name>	Sergeant	Todd	The opening bombardment took out at least three-quarters of them. Only three-quarters. [[MASK] finishes his cigarette in one long, angry drag. Immediately, he reaches for another.] Yep, and that’s what should have made us worry right then and there.
<name>Jimi</name>	Jimi	Hendrix	Now, personally, I’ve never been a metal fan. Straight classic rock’s my thing, and [MASK]’s “Driving South” 5. The assegai: An all-steel, multipurpose implement named after the traditional Zulu short spear. is about as heavy as I get.
<name>Christine</name>	Christine	Americans	He said that [MASK] are the only people he’s ever met who just can’t accept that bad things can happen to good people. Maybe he’s right. Last week I was listening to the radio and just happened to hear [name withheld for legal reasons].
<name>zombie</name>	zombie	Zack	They pop right up like a cork. The only risk might be if [MASK] were clinging to you during the ascent. A couple times I’ve had buddies surface with uninvited passengers hanging on for dear life ... or undeath. [Chuckles.]
<name>Watergate</name>	Watergate	Phalanx	Then winter came, [MASK] hit the shelves, cases dropped. Maybe they “dissuaded” a few younger crusading reporters, but, in reality, the whole thing was pretty much old news after a few months. It had become “manageable.”
<name>John</name>	John	KONDO	We would care for her, we would preserve her, we would annihilate the walking blight that infested and defiled her and we would restore her beauty and purity for the day when her children would return to her. [MASK]: I thought he was insane, and told him so right to his face.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Arkady	“You see! This is what they’re not telling us! This is what they have us breaking our backs to find!” You could see heads start to nod, a few gmnts of agreement. [MASK] continued, “What if these things are everywhere?
<name>Zombies</name>	Zombies	Ignorance	Imagine if the undead vims had been as understood as, say, tuberculosis was. Imagine if the world’s citizens, or at least those charged with protecting those citizens, had known exactly what they were facing. [MASK] was the real enemy, and cold, hard facts were the weapons.
<name>patron</name>	patron	Moses	Our client liked to know people who were known by all. His plan was to provide safety for those who could raise his image during and after the war, playing [MASK] to the scared and famous. And you know what, they fell for it.
<name>Bucky</name>	Bucky	Mukherjee	[MASK] and I looked at each other, without much hesitation, I’m happy to say, and took off after him. Now we wanted to be heroes, too, to protect our general and shield him from the crowd. What a joke.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Mommy	They came bigger. [Again she moans. Then follows up by pounding her right fist on the table.] They wanted to come in. [Her blows are powerful, mechanical.] People screamed. [MASK] hugged me tight. “It’s okay.”
<name>the enemy</name>	the enemy	Zack	What if the brass had goofed, hadn’t packed enough rounds or underestimated how strong [MASK] would be that day? It could have been Yonkers all over again; worse, because no one would be getting out of there alive. But you did have enough ammunition.
<name>her</name>	her	Maze	The toughest part for me was making sure [MASK] stuck to the mission. She always wanted to fight. [Smiles down at the sleeping dachshund.] They were good escorts, always made sure she got to her target objective, waited for her, and always got her home safely.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Devil	[MASK]’s mother, I thought, they are going to bomb the bridge! They’d given up on the evacuation and were going to kill everyone! “Off the bridge!” I started shouting. “Everyone get off!” Panic shot through the crowd.
<name>McQueen</name>	McQueen	Gs	with a big Yosemite Sam mustache trying to pull a Beretta from his vest before three burning [MASK] pulled him down... I remember a dude forcing open the door of a news van, jumping in, throwing out a pretty blond reporter, and trying to drive away before a tank crushed them both.
<name>Nelson</name> (referring to Nelson Mandela)	Nelson (referring to Nelson Mandela)	Paul	Then, gesturing to [MASK], he said, “This man will save our people.” And then came that moment, the one that historians will probably debate until the subject fades from memory. He embraced the white Afrikaner.
<name>Chopper</name>	Chopper	Choi	There they are. [I look up to see the swarm, roughly sixty of them, walking out of the desert night.] And here we go. [[MASK] maneuvers us above them. They reach up for our searchlights, eyes wide and jaws slack.
<name>troops</name>	troops	Gs	The second “steel rain” didn’t have half the impact of the first, no more gas tanks to catch, and now the more tightly packed [MASK] just happened to be shielding each other from a possible head wound. I wasn’t scared, not yet.
<name>Ellis</name>	Ellis	Redeker	[MASK] believed both love and hate to be irrelevant. To him, they were “impediments of the human condition,” and, in his words again, “imagine what could be accomplished if the human race would only shed its humanity.” Evil?
<name>the virus</name>	the virus	Zack	They probably killed more people, the Rambos and the runaway fires, and the traffic accidents and just the ... the whole shit storm that we now call “the Great Panic”; I think that killed more people at first than [MASK].
<name>Socs</name>	Socs	Zack	More hands, stronger, were trying to haul me somewhere. Kicking, squirming, cursing, crying ... suddenly a fist clocked me in the jaw. It didn’t knock me out, but I was suddenly relaxed. These were my buddies. [MASK] don’t punch.
<name>Bradleys</name>	Bradleys	Bradleys	You know they even tried to dig fighting holes for the tanks? The engineers blasted them right out of the A&P parking lot. You had tanks? Dude, we had everything: tanks, [MASK], Humvees armed with everything from fifty cals to these new Vasilek heavy mortars.
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Arkady	“... because I wanted you all to see!” [MASK] lifted the chain, pulling the old babushka up by her throat. He grabbed the hood and ripped it off. Her face was gray, just like the rest of her, her eyes were wide and fierce.
<name>Andrew</name>	Andrew	Mister	I saw this one real queeny hairdresser stab an actress in the mouth with a letter opener, and, ironically, I watched [MASK] “Get It Done” try to wrestle a grenade away from the talent show guy before it went off in their hands.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Arkady	[MASK] roared. His fist caved in the old woman’s face. She fell to his feet, writhing and gurgling 2. Semnadstat was a Russian magazine aimed at teenage girls. It’s title, 17, was illegally copied from an American publication of the same name.
<name>Oroville</name>	Oroville	Bastard	[MASK]. They had enough troops to wage open warfare in almost every major city, but they couldn’t spare a couple of traffic cops to protect against a catastrophe waiting to happen? No one could imagine the repercussions of abandoning both the seismic warning stations and the emergency spillway controls?
<name>Carl</name>	Carl	Kondo	I could tell that his path would take him directly underneath the limbs of my tree. I crouched slowly, quietly. I wasn’t sure if he was hostile, insane, or even recently bitten. I was taking no chances. [At this point, [MASK] chimes in.]
<name>someone</name> (There is no clear indication of a specific name in this passage)	someone (There is no clear indication of a specific name in this passage)	Zack	Outstanding design. It would shatter on entry into [MASK]’s skull and fragments would fry its brain. No risk of spreading infected gray matter, and no need for wasteful bonfires. On BS4 duty, you didn’t even have to decap before you buried them.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Arkady	I was in my bunk, rereading an outdated copy of Semnadstat.21 heard a commotion, vehicle engines, voices. A crowd was already assembled on the parade ground. I pushed my way through and saw [MASK] standing in the center of the mob.
<name>the enemy</name>	the enemy	Zack	SC is Sweep and Clear, just attached to a regular unit, like conventional warfare. That’s where training really paid off. Not only could they sniff [MASK] out miles before us, but the sounds they made always told you exactly what to expect.
<name>He</name>	He	Tim	I’m not sure when the other dogs started barking, or when I heard the car alarm down the street. It was when I heard something that sounded like a gunshot that I went into the den. [MASK] hadn’t heard anything. He had the volume jacked up too high.
<name>Marvin</name>	Marvin	Gu	Now, this is a man who has never said a positive thing in his life. [MASK] was a worrier, a neurotic curmudgeon. If he had a headache, it was a brain tumor; if it looked like rain, this year’s harvest was ruined.
<name>her</name> (Note: There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to a pronoun)	her (Note: There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to a pronoun)	Arkady	He grabbed the hood and ripped it off. Her face was gray, just like the rest of her, her eyes were wide and fierce. She snarled like a wolf and tried to grab [MASK]. He wrapped one powerful hand around her throat, holding her at arm’s length.
<name>prey</name>	prey	Zack	They’d lost it. They were nothing like the As. Those pups would lock eyes with [MASK], that was the key. They’d stand their ground, bare their teeth, and let out this low growl that said, “Back the fuck off!”
<name>Timmy's</name>	Timmy's	Finley	I was unloading the Maytag so I didn’t hear [MASK] barking. Well, maybe I did, but I never gave it any thought. Our house was in the community’s last row, right at the foot of the hills.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Mets	Only neither of us had counted on my injury or my undead tail. There was no immediate entrance so I had to limp to one of the small, adjoining roads that [MASK] had originally warned me to avoid. I could see why as I began to get close.
<name>Danny</name>	Danny	Mukherjee	The voice shot back that the road would never be clear, that the only thing behind those people was a raging swarm of God knows how many million zombies. [MASK] answered that he would blow it when the zombies got here, and not a second before.
<name>Private Slovik</name>	Private Slovik	Chernov	That guy they keep talking about, [MASK], he was killed after the war, on land, when he got wasted and passed out on a tram line. Fuckin’ politicians. Maybe ROVs are more cost-effective, but one thing they’re not is better.
<name>Glen</name>	Glen	Mets	Wrecked and rusting cars were piled up by the hundreds and every tenth one had at least one G locked inside. They saw me and started to moan, the sound carried for miles in every direction. [MASK] shouted, “Don’t worry about that now!
<name>me</name>	me	Tim	Little things like that. I don’t think they were exposed to any more information than [MASK], or I, but maybe they didn’t have the adult distractions to shut it out. How did you and your husband respond?
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Arkady	Her dress was tom and the skin of her legs had been scraped clean off. There was no blood, just this black pus. [MASK] was well into a loud, angry speech. “No more lies! No more orders to shoot civilians on sight!
<name>Elvis</name>	Elvis	Michael	But the new faces, they could have been from anywhere: your neighbor, your aunt, that geeky substitute teacher, or that fat, lazy slob at the DMV. From former insurance salesmen to a guy who I’m damn sure was [MASK] 4.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Baburin	I knew those were the kinds of emotions I should have been feeling; at that point the only thing I could feel was fear. I kept thinking about what [MASK] had said, that something bad was going to happen. I just wanted to go home, see my parents.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Sharon	[MASK]'s voice suddenly simulates the sound of something large breaking, a deep phlegm-filled rumble from the bottom of her throat.] “They’re coming in! Shoot ’em, shoot ’em!” [She makes the sound of gunfire then . . .]
<name>diver</name>	diver	JIM	I knew one guy, from the British Special Boat Service. He had these mondo blood blisters all along his inner thighs from where the [MASK]’s leg joints pinched his skin. Kick-ass divers, the SBS, but I’d never swap jobs with them.
<name>Herman</name>	Herman	Mao	With their vast stockpiles of conventional armaments, with their “bottomless well” of manpower .. . “bottomless well,” unforgivable. Do you know why we had such a population explosion during the 1950s? Because [MASK] believed it was the only way to win a nuclear war.
<name>Lenin</name>	Lenin	Gu	I don’t really believe in an afterlife—the old revolutionary to the end—but if there is, I can imagine my old comrade [MASK] laughing down at me when I say, with all honesty, that everything’s going to be all right.
