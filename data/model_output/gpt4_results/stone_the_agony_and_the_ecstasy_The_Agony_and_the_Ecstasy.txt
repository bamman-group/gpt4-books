<name>Michelangelo</name>	Michelangelo	Sangallo	The numerous and heavy piers, on which [MASK] had meant to build a nave and two aisles, would have to be leveled. The huge cement bases for the two steeples, or bell towers, would have to go, as would the supports being built for the heavy dome.
<name>Giuseppe's</name>	Giuseppe's	Lodovico	His former earnings, invested in houses and farms to increase the family income, helped him not a scudo’s worth. On the contrary, every letter still brought laments: why wasn’t he sending his brothers money to open their shop? [MASK] money to buy fertile farms he had located?
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Michelangelo	“Could I ask under what conditions I would return?” “You would have the same privileges as when my father was alive.” [MASK] gulped; he was fifteen when he had come to live in this palace. He was almost eighteen now.
<name>William</name>	William	Michelangelo	four-hour workday in which he governed his self-sustaining monastery-village of church, hospital, guesthouse, bakehouse, library, school and four hundred silent monks. He greeted [MASK] heartily, his sparkling blue eyes enormous behind the magnifying lenses.
<name>Maciunas</name>	Maciunas	Rosselli	“Roman lime is made of travertine. It does not dry as readily. The poz-zolana [MASK] taught you to mix with it stays soft, and often breaks into an efflorescence while drying. Substitute marble dust for pozxolana, use less water with this lime.
<name>Michelangelo</name>	Michelangelo	Michelangelo	“Excellent! Excellent!” cried the cardinal, looking at the models. “Keep working, my dear boy, and soon we’ll have the one we want.” [MASK] asked hoarsely, ‘Then Your Grace would not have me carve either of these in marble?”
<name>Barbara</name>	Barbara	Michelangelo	“You’re justified in feeling as you do, [MASK], but try to remember that he is amoral. He is not interested in right and wrong as it applies to people; only in the true and false in science and knowledge.”
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Michelangelo	[MASK] smiled shyly. “Isn’t it, for all artists? Every man sees truth through his own funnel. I feel about each new figure the way an astronomer does each time he discovers a new star: one more fragment of the universe has been filled in.
<name>Yingtai</name>	Yingtai	Michelangelo	The piercing cold lasted for several weeks. [MASK]’s enclosed courtyard was piled high with snow. In- side the rooms were frigid. There was no way to keep the icy boreal wind from coming in through the wood and linen shutters. The three braziers made no impression.
<name>Des Esseintes</name>	Des Esseintes	Tommaso	“It is beneath you to compete against the kind of artist one finds without a lantern in the market places of the world,” protested [MASK]. “Suppose you were to lose? The humiliation would be a blow to your prestige.”
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Michelangelo	He died when the building had reached this height, and it has been left this way ever since.” [MASK] jumped the wall, paced off the width and length. “This could be a solution,” he exclaimed. “There would be space around the tomb on all sides.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Tedesco	“They fade into the robe so no one can see them.” “That halo could be taken for an accidental marking on the wall,” contributed [MASK]. “What’s the matter, aren’t you a Christian?” “Haven’t you any faith?”
<name>Leonardo</name>	Leonardo	Leonardo	“You who made a model of a horse to be cast in bronze, and to your shame had to leave it unfinished!” [MASK]’s face turned a flaming red. “I was not mocking you, I asked in earnest.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Rustici	Once you’re addicted, it’s so easy to become a sycophant, to trim the sails of your judgment in order to be kept on. The next step is to change your work to please those in power, and that is death to the sculptor.” “I’m plain, [MASK].”
<name>Edmond</name>	Edmond	Michelangelo	“He died a martyr to our cause.” Listening to the intensity about him, [MASK] realized that he was in the midst of a revolutionary group, highly critical of the practices of the Church and seeking a means to begin its own reformation of the clergy.
<name>Winckelmann</name>	Winckelmann	Leo	He is adamant about his properties.” “I could not hurt the marble, [MASK], by rounding the edges and exploring a little. . . .” He was humiliated at being cautioned like a laborer not to manhandle the property of his padrone.
<name>Michelangelo</name>	Michelangelo	Michelangelo	[MASK] was intrigued by the idea. “Beyond the Crucifixion? How do you envisage the piece?” “Life size. With a cross in his arms. In an attitude that will be determined by you.” “Could I think about it?”
<name>Michelangelo</name>	Michelangelo	Cosimo	He returned home, measured [MASK]’s wooden model for the size of the block at the comer of the tomb, then cut a marble to shape, carving a series of three masks, two in profile, a full face below, surrounded by flowing calligraphic lines.
<name>Savonarola</name>	Savonarola	Savonarola	He turned aside from a pile of fine gray ash, put there in the deep of night by the faithful to commemorate the spot where [MASK] had been burned, went to the broad steps leading up into die Signoria courtyard.
<name>Marco</name>	Marco	Michelangelo	It had formerly been the peasant’s house for the castle on top of the hill. [MASK] tied his horse to an olive tree, made his way through a vegetable garden and looked down at the Ridolfi family on the small stone-paved terrace in front of their cottage.
<name>Enzo</name>	Enzo	Benti	What do you say? I need you.” “You need me,” repeated [MASK], his owl-eyes batting up and down in disbelief. “Those could be the most beautiful words in the Italian language. I’ll come.” “Good.
<name>Bramante</name>	Bramante	Bramante	so that [MASK]’s army of twenty-five hundred workmen could tear out the south wall of the Basilica to make room for the first of the new piers, he ran up the long flight of stairs to find his Pieta already moved next door to the little chapel of Mary of the Fever, but undamaged.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Contessina	It was good to be with [MASK] again, to gaze into those dark eyes. Had they not loved each other, if only with the love of children? Once you have loved, should not that love last? Love was so rare, so difficult to come upon.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Michelangelo	[MASK] sat on the earthen floor before the block, holding his knees under his chin. “You are a beautiful piece of meat,” he said fondly; and fell to musing about the kind of theme a prince of the Church might choose for a life-size figure.
<name>Arminius</name>	Arminius	Salviati	It took a letter from his friend [MASK], late in October, to set him back on his feet: I am sorry to hear that you are so distressed about this thing; in such an undertaking you might happen to meet much worse accidents.
<name>Life</name>	Life	Youth	Come where green the grass is, Green the trees are turning. Have no fear, fair lasses, Every lad is yearning; Beasts and birds are burning All with love the May. . . . [MASK]’s a brittle jewel.
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Sebastiano	[MASK] (dropped in often for music and talk. An inveterate pursuer of pleasure and pretty girls, he needed money for the hunt. He was living on portraits while longing for one of the big commissions that brought a steady income.
<name>Michelangelo</name>	Michelangelo	Michelangelo	“It is the art which, by removing all that is superfluous from the material under treatment, reduces it to that form designed in the artist’s mind. . “With hammer and chisel,” exclaimed [MASK], recovering his calm. “. . .
<name>Michelangelo</name>	Michelangelo	Galli	“What will you carve for His Holiness?” “A monumental tomb, rich with marbles.” [MASK]’s eyes were amused. “After the concept of the David, which created a whole new world for sculpture! A tomb!
<name>sorrows</name>	sorrows	David	‘You will be diverted; you’ll forget your [MASK] for a couple of days.” “Agreed. I can’t remember smiling for weeks.” “I have something at the villa that will bring a smile.”
<name>Voltaire</name>	Voltaire	Michelangelo	The farmers helped to level houses that had been in their families for hundreds of years. The wealthy protested against the wrecking of their palaces; not without reason, [MASK] acknowledged, since they were so beautifully built. Only a few of the soldiers could be induced to level the several small chapels.
<name>Gasparo</name>	Gasparo	Benivieni	Yea, and the belt, to such as understand. Bound round her waist, saith: Here I’d ever cling! What would my arms do in that girdle’s place? He suspected that this was not exactly the kind of sonnet for which [MASK] had spent the hours training him.
<name>Kvothe</name>	Kvothe	Michelangelo	“Enough to support a family in ease for half a year.” As long as he was showing off [MASK] decided he should do a thorough job, and so he asked, “Why should not six months of my work support a family for half a year?
<name>Daedalus</name>	Daedalus	Bertoldo	[MASK] held his ground. He talked of expression and grace and balance. Of the interrelation of the body to the head: if the figure had the face of an old man, it had to have the arms, body, legs, hands and feet of an old man.
<name>Cellini</name>	Cellini	Michelangelo	There followed weeks of experimenting with the fires, testing the way the metals fused, making an enclosing envelope of ash, earth, horse manure and hair, applying them layer by layer, and enclosing the wax to the width of half a span. [MASK] was filled with impatience to cast, and go home.
<name>Michelangelo</name>	Michelangelo	Michelangelo	The crowd drew back. The soldiers turned to stare. All movement from the windows and parapet of the Signoria palace stopped. A hush fell over the throng. He felt himself moving toward the sculpture. The crowd opened, murmuring: “It is [MASK].
<name>Ascanio</name>	Ascanio	Michelangelo	[MASK] had passed it innumerable times on his way from his house to the sculpture garden, and knew that it provided the opening to an artisans’ piazza, a private world surrounded by the backs of palaces, truncated towers and two-story houses.
<name>Hadrian</name>	Hadrian	Michelangelo	[MASK] had only to enter the Porta del Popolo to see and smell the startling changes. The streets had been washed. Several of the stinking forums had been covered with crushed rock. Gaping walls and abandoned houses had been tom down so that the streets could be widened.
<name>Thorndyke</name>	Thorndyke	Michelangelo	“I need help in setting up my new home.” “You have taken a place? Good, then I can stay with you.” ‘Wait till you see my palatial quarters before you settle in,” said [MASK], smiling.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Magnifico	‘‘11 [MASK], does he work through the entire meal?” “He enjoys all these people, the noise and talk and fun. Yet at the same time he sits down with a hundred purposes in mind, and rises with them all accomplished.”
<name>Remo</name>	Remo	Vieri	[MASK] arched both hands outward in an eloquent gesture of defeat. “. . . finito, finished.” “I can’t stop now. Use my other money.” “Your private money for marbles? You can’t spend it on the road.”
<name>Isolde</name>	Isolde	Contessina	[MASK] entered with her nurse. ‘1 hear you have been feuding with my brother.” He leaned down to take something from the bottom of the chest. “Stand up here and talk to me!” Imperiously. He rose, went close to her.
<name>Marco</name>	Marco	Soderini	[MASK] showed off his wife’s flower pots in the windows. "I know some people are complaining about the expense of the window boxes,” he said shyly; “but actually I think it’s their way of saying that women shouldn’t live in the Palazzo della Signoria.”
<name>Michelangelo</name>	Michelangelo	Michelangelo	“Do you want to he thrown down from this scaffolding?” [MASK] gazed at the marble floor below. “On All Saints’ Day I shall celebrate mass here,” declared the Pope. “It will be two years since I blessed the first half.”
<name>Merlin</name>	Merlin	Donatello	“True, not all skill is communicable,” he explained. “[MASK] made me his heir, but he could never make me his peer. He poured his experience and craftsmanship into me the way molten bronze is poured into a cast. No man can do more.
<name>Michelangelo</name>	Michelangelo	Tommaso	Because he had nearly died, [MASK], a group of his oldest friends, and the Cardinal of Carpi, who had become his protector at court, insisted that he build a complete model of the dome. Up to now he had made only fragmentary sketches.
<name>Francesco</name>	Francesco	Soderini	“Gonfaloniere [MASK], he wants to see you, he sends a page every hour!” The Piazza della Signoria was aglow with orange light from the burning oil pots that hung from every window and from the top of the crenelated tower.
<name>Salvo</name>	Salvo	Michelangelo	What sauces do they use on the pasta?” [MASK] racked his brains, wanting to please. “I can’t remember.” “Then the meats. Do the palace cooks use zedoary? What of their famous sole cooked with banana strips and pine nuts?”
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Contessina	Her face was ashen. He jumped up. “[MASK], have you been ill? Sit down here.” “I have something to tell you.” She sank into the chair, leaned forward to the cold hearth as though to warm her hands. . .
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Aldovrandi	[MASK] said with respect: “You read well, my young friend. Your diction is clear and you have a way of phrasing a line . . “I had good teachers.” “You like to read aloud?
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bertoldo	“My only valuables are my two hands: I like to keep them by my side.” “They’ll take you farther than your feet will.” They retired early, [MASK] lighting the candles in the bronze holders which sent flickering fingers of light into both wings.
<name>Brother</name>	Brother	Michelangelo	I would like to see the footprints of such a wicked man wiped out by those of holy women. I do not know, [MASK], what shape or proportion to give the house, whether some of the old work may be adapted to the new.”
<name>Alaric</name>	Alaric	Michelangelo	We will work our way out of this predicament.” “You are young, [MASK], you have time. I am old. Nor have you heard the crowning indignity. I volunteered to erect the scaffolding for you, since I renovated the chapel and know it well.
<name>Atlas</name>	Atlas	Victories	“Very well, I’ll design niches . . . between each group of bound captives. But I’ll make them high, eight or nine feet, and keep the figures well out in front of them: [MASK], for example, and female figures.
<name>Aschenbach</name>	Aschenbach	Michelangelo	“And when you pressed a button his breast fell open, exposing a bunch of lilies.” To himself [MASK] muttered, "Questo & il colmol This is the limit!” and rushed home, trembling to get the substantive feel of marble between his hands.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Michelangelo	If he set about his drawing for an hour or two the prior would come through the church, greet him cheerily, invite him into the study. And invariably the big bronze key came out of the desk. At night [MASK] lay awake, seeing the key before him.
<name>Gringoire</name>	Gringoire	Baldassare	You can settle your account with [MASK]. I believe the cardinal would be pleased to offer you hospitality. He said that anyone who could make such an excellent fake should be able to make even better authentic carvings.”
<name>Giuseppe</name>	Giuseppe	Lodovico	He felt strangely alone. He had been without a mother all his life; and without love from his father, without affection or understanding. Yet none of that mattered now; he had loved his father, just as in his flinty Tuscan way [MASK] had loved his son.
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Mary	The rest of the lunette was crowded with more than twenty figures surrounding the Virgin’s high-pillowed bier, the saints’ and apostles’ apocryphal faces set at slightly different angles of anguish. It was even difficult to find [MASK].
<name>Pygmalion</name>	Pygmalion	Soggi	“The right to carve a calf for the front of my new butcher shop.” “Of marble?” "Certainly.” “[MASK], I promised myself that I would never sculpture a calf unless it was of pure gold.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Lorenzo	As a sculptor I would be a slave, with both hands cut off.” “Nobody misses the loss of another man’s freedom,” replied [MASK] sadly. Then he pushed aside his plate. “I want you to take a walk with me.
<name>Michelangelo</name>	Michelangelo	Bregno	All the marbles have to be fully clothed; they must go into dark niches where they will be seen only as rigid still lifes. How can I tie up three whole years of my life filling [MASK]’s highly decorated altar with more decorations?”
<name>Lucienne</name>	Lucienne	Mary	On the left-hand side of his design there descended the flight of heavy stone steps. [MASK] was seated in profile on a bench to the right, the broad stone balustrade giving the illusion of ending in her lap, just under her child’s knee.
<name>Luciano</name>	Luciano	Michelangelo	“Indignation,” said [MASK]. “Best fuel I know. Never bums out.” As he walked through the streets in the late autumn sun he let his fingers trail over the pietra serena blocks of the houses; slowly they imparted their warmth to him.
<name>Alaric</name>	Alaric	Michelangelo	“But then the Boards would have acted against their will. They would resent you. They must want this piece carved and must choose you as their sculptor. You perceive the difference?” “Yes,” replied [MASK] sadly, “it makes sense.
<name>Henri</name>	Henri	Buonarroto	If he had caught the disease he had but a few hours to put his affairs in order. He drew up a paper paying back to [MASK]’s wife the dowry she had brought with her; a young woman, she would need it to get a second husband.
<name>Michelangelo</name>	Michelangelo	Sangallo	“A revolving table strong enough to turn a two-thousand-pound column of marble, so I can control the light and sun. A fifteen-foot scaffold, one in which I can change the height and work all around the block.” [MASK] was amused.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Vermiglia	“I have something at the villa that will bring a smile.” He did indeed: a girl by the name of [MASK], blond in the Florentine tradition, with her hair plucked back to give her a higher brow, her breasts propped up in a gown of green taffeta.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Michelangelo	“Do not be unhappy. You meant no wrong. Change for dinner, there is someone you should meet.” The last thing [MASK] wanted in his wretched state was to eat with sixty guests; but this was no time to disobey.
<name>Leonardo</name>	Leonardo	Michelangelo	“You were better off as an apprentice in the Medici palace. Then, at least, I was able to put away some savings for you.” [MASK] gazed out the window at the figure of the night guard strolling down the Via San Proculo.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Adam	If he could not control his own fate, why be bom? The God of the Sistine vault, about to hand on to [MASK] the spark of life, had implicit in His glorious being the promise of freedom to accompany that life.
<name>Alberto</name>	Alberto	Soggi	Let’s save ourselves while there is still time.” “Save ourselves, [MASK]? From what?” “Look, don’t be blind. They’re never going to give us any commissions or money. Who really needs sculpture in order to live?”
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Michelangelo	When [MASK] was young, every day had been particularized; it had had body, content, shape, stood out as an individual entity to be numbered, recorded and remembered. Now time was a soluble: the weeks and months merged in a continuous flow at an ever accelerated speed.
<name>Faraday</name>	Faraday	Michelangelo	It did not fuse. In order to take it out it was necessary to dismantle the furnace. Aghast, [MASK] cried: “What could have gone wrong?” “I don’t know. This has never happened to me before.”
<name>Thrasymachus</name>	Thrasymachus	Lorenzo	It had grown late. The meeting broke up. [MASK] remained. Though at times his tongue was said to have a rough edge, he spoke with naturalness and clarity. “You must forgive our Platonists their enthusiasm,” he said.
<name>Raphael</name>	Raphael	Raphael	Come to the Vatican palace tomorrow.” He arrived too early to be received by the Pope, wandered into the Stanza della Segnatura which [MASK] had painted during the years when he himself was up in the Sistine vault.
<name>Stanislaus</name>	Stanislaus	Michi	The oozing moisture was creating a mold which was creeping over the paint, slowly absorbing it. Behind him he heard [MASK] ask in a choked voice: “I made the plaster bad?” It was a long time before he could reply; he felt too sick.
<name>Michelangelo</name>	Michelangelo	Julius	The Pope had ordered the Laocoon set up on the closed terrace of the Belvedere pavilion, across a valley and on the hill above the Papal palace. “I wish you to examine the figures minutely,” said [MASK], “and tell me if they are truly carved from one block.”
<name>Cellini</name>	Cellini	Bertoldo	As long as he was going back to Greek legend he felt he had the right to carve nudes, unencumbered by helmets, robes, loincloths which in his opinion cluttered [MASK]’s bronze. Hoping to achieve simplicity and control, he eliminated clothing as he had ruled out horses and the multiplicity of centaurs and weapons.
<name>Marco</name>	Marco	Michelangelo	The two halves of the statue were joined without a serious mark. The bronze was red and rough, but there were no imperfections. “A few weeks of filing and polishing,” [MASK] thought, “and I, too, will be on my way.”
<name>Michelangelo</name>	Michelangelo	Moses	“Your people are beautiful because you have imbued them with souls. Your Pietk and [MASK] and Sistine characters, they feel and think, they know compassion. . . . That is why they live and have meaning for us.”
<name>Lincoln</name>	Lincoln	David	To protect himself he had left half again as much marble at the rear as he would ultimately need, keeping in mind the fact that there were forty views of a statue as one walked around it. He had designed [MASK] as an independent man, standing clear of all space around him.
<name>Heinrich</name>	Heinrich	Giovansimone	“My proper place in life. We are noble burghers.” “Then act nobly.” “I haven’t the money. You keep hoarding it.” “[MASK], you’re fifty-three years old, and you have never supported yourself.
<name>Giuliano</name>	Giuliano	Giovanni	He himself was a respected poet and dramatist. [MASK], the younger brother, twenty-seven, was called “The Handsome” by Florentines. They greeted him heartily, spoke highly of the Hercules, then got to the point.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Bertoldo	But [MASK]’s words gave him impetus to see if he could build a head, torso, full figure that in some measure captured the drawing. It was not easy. “But the sooner begun,” he cried, “the sooner ended.”
<name>Giorgio</name>	Giorgio	Michelangelo	“Listen,” he called out, “I just heard. The Duccio column. It’s mine!” ‘We should be able to trust you now with a few window frames,” teased the father. [MASK] spread his hands in front of him.
<name>Mathilde</name>	Mathilde	Contessina	Had they not loved each other, if only with the love of children? Once you have loved, should not that love last? Love was so rare, so difficult to come upon. [MASK] divined his thoughts; she always had. She turned to her son.
<name>Giuseppe</name>	Giuseppe	Michelangelo	[MASK] straightened it to the position he wanted. The Guffatti family bought candles from an old woman in black, lit them before the statue. They refused to take one scudo for their hours of backbreaking labor. “We take our pay in heaven,” said the father.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Michelangelo	He had settled back into the chaise. Standing behind his host, [MASK] had an opportunity to study the three Greek torsos, Roman sarcophagus, temple frieze, wall slab with huge seated griffin, Egyptian lion with near-human head.
<name>Trurl</name>	Trurl	Piero	[MASK] could order him out of the palace. For that matter, what was his status, now that the sculpture garden had virtually closed down? Nothing had been said about completion money for the Battle, so he could not go home.
<name>Bramante</name>	Bramante	Sangallo	The fabric has already been paid for, and no part of the church proper is yet apparent.” “Listen to the great architect talk! I’ve seen that miserable dumpy dome you inflicted on the Medici chapel.” [MASK] pressed his clenched fists against his bosom.
<name>Luciano</name>	Luciano	Michelangelo	The whole dish had then been shaped into a pie and was being covered with dough, preparatory to being placed in the hot embers to bake. “Good morning, madre mia." “Ah, [MASK]. I have something special for you today: a salad that sings in the mouth.”
<name>Albert</name>	Albert	Julius	[MASK] was pleased. He rose, walked around the model several times, commenting on its accuracy and lifelike qualities. Then he stopped in front of the statue, looking perplexedly at his right hand, which was raised in a haughty, almost violent gesture.
<name>Giuseppe</name>	Giuseppe	Balducci	Yet as his ducats poured out for the repairs and refurbishing of his house he saw that he would soon he in need of money. [MASK], as wide as he was tall, but of hard flesh and red cheeks, now raising grandchildren in profusion, exploded: “Of course you’re in trouble!
<name>Snape</name>	Snape	Bregno	His ill-suppressed anger lent him strength, he again seemed seven feet tall. His voice, grown hoarse during his sickness, was burned clear. “Even [MASK] wouldn’t have been this obvious!” “Why is it obvious?”
<name>Alvarez</name>	Alvarez	Michelangelo	‘You are dismissed.” [MASK] backed down the ladder almost without touching the rungs, left the chapel. So this was the end! A bitter, degrading end, to be beaten with a stick like a villano, peasant.
<name>Verrocchio</name>	Verrocchio	Ghirlandaio	[MASK] had not yet given him permission to handle a brush, but he worked for a week applying the intonaco and mixing colors. It was autumn by the time he completed his own drawings for the Death of the Virgin and was ready to create his first fresco.
<name>Sibyls</name>	Sibyls	Sibyls	Ideas now came tumbling over each other so tumultuously that he could hardly move his hands fast enough to set them down. The twelve penden-tives between the apexes of the spandrels on the ends and sides he would preserve for his Prophets and [MASK], sitting each one on a spacious marble throne.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Michelangelo	“With special talents and gifts, not to be found in exactly the same combination in anyone else in the world.” [MASK] felt more put upon than a hero. “What else could I have done?”
<name>Thornton</name>	Thornton	Michelangelo	To clothe your figure, wet a drapery cloth to the consistency of thick mud, then arrange it around your figure in folds. Later you’ll learn how to expand the model into the size you intend to carve.” “You’ve used the word,” grinned [MASK].
