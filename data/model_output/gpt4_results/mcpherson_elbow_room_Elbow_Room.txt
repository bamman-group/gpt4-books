<name>Stavrogin</name>	Stavrogin	X	We could wander about the city on our own, call [MASK] again, or wait politely for him to call on us. But the thought of waiting in the room through the morning was distasteful. Looking around, I saw again what I had been too reluctant to perceive when we checked in the evening before.
<name>He</name>	He	Billy	I thought what he said was kind of funny, and so I laughed. But I should of knowed better. He give me a cheese sandwich and started right off preachin’ at me about the lowlife in the back room. [MASK] couldn’t stand none of ’em.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Bob	mr. jones: Like I say, he was always off in a comer, sulking or something. [MASK] was a good worker, tops. But even when he was working, it was automatic-like, like his mind was always on something else.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Green	The next customer, a little girl, arriving well after 10:30 a.m., selected a candy bar from the rack beside the counter. “Free,” [MASK] said cheerfully. The little girl left the candy on the counter and ran out of the store.
<name>Raymond</name>	Raymond	Harper	As a favor to his mother, who could not go herself, I took off from college and went by bus to [MASK]’s farm, where, in those days, black men were stocked for the road gangs.
<name>Africans</name>	Africans	Israelis	She still knew the names, the accents, the personal quirks of individual Indians, Asians, [MASK], but more and more they fragmented into pieces of memory. There was no longer the sense of a personal epic. She no longer existed inside her own stories.
<name>Polyphemus</name>	Polyphemus	Billy	Knowing this, I wonder about the agony you will suffer with only one eye in service. Won’t it take twice as long, and prolong your pains, before your full life passes and goes away?” [MASK] looked hurt.
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Ginny	He just knows a little part of the world. He’s never talked seriously with anybody that’s not like him. He doesn’t understand black people, and he would have a hard time understanding [MASK].” He laughed, his clear eyes flashing.
<name>Jerome</name>	Jerome	Billy	[MASK] had been droppin’ strong hints that we might git married after he got his degree, in two or three years. He was plannin’ on being a high school teacher. But outside of being married to a teacher, what was I go’n git out of it?
<name>John</name>	John	Milford	At this hearing all we do is tape all relevant testimony and forward it on to the central officer at the state capital. The boys up there make the final decision.” [MASK] felt a knee press against his under the table.
<name>Jefferson</name>	Jefferson	Mohammed	“You are not just black,” she discloses to me. “We, of course, knew it all along. But now the truth can be revealed. You are a descendant of [MASK]’s beloved muezzin, the greatly respected Bilalia.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Virginia	When they invited me to dinner in early December, [MASK] said, “This old rascal thinks that one day he’ll have to kiss a pickaninny. If I had a cold heart I’d send him one of them minstrel pictures.”
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Louis	She seemed flustered and embarrassed, almost like a child caught in error. She said to [MASK], “See, she don't treat me right. No, she don’t treat her mama right. I have work my fingers to the bone, and she still don’t treat me right.”
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Billy	I looked closely at him and saw a gangster. He was not the kind of man I wanted to meet my family. I glanced at my watch and sipped my drink. I listened to his stories. [MASK] spun his usual lies.
<name>Miss Moore</name>	Miss Moore	Thaap	She would spell out this rule for us as she paced before her desk, slapping a thick, homemade ruler against the flat of her brown palm. “There ain’t no babies in here,” she would recite. [MASK]! “Anybody thinks he’s still a baby..."
<name>Sweet</name>	Sweet	Jones	Paying-up time is Friday mornings, before noon. You can play ball or close down now.” “Can I ask who go’n do the collecting for the community?” [MASK] asked, his voice humble.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Suspect	His vocabulary was precise, his delivery flawless. When he reached the part of his testimony concerning the sobriety test, he pulled a sheet of paper from his coat pocket and recited, “. . . [MASK] was informed of her legal obligation to submit to the test.
<name>John</name>	John	Milford	“T knows good English,” he said. “Don’t you forget, I worked round white folks, too. They hears what they wants to hear.” Then he looked at [MASK] and said, “No offense intended.”
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Clair	But now, listening to the speaker, half his mind began to put the question. There was no response from the other half. That part of his mind was occupied with the speaker, and with [MASK], up on the platform.
<name>Jerome</name>	Jerome	Gilmore	There’s two different styles.” [MASK] licks some lather off his lips with a delicate flicker of his tongue. He moistens both lips in the process. “That don’t make a difference no more,” he says. “People thinkin’ ’bout unity these days.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Billy	“These here come from runnin’ round the country,” he grinned. “And I’m keep runnin’ till the pork chops get thicker and they give me two dollars more.” “Please, [MASK],” I pleaded.
<name>James</name>	James	Billy	Whenever I am confronted by members of the family with one of his lies, I say this in response. For whatever it is worth to them, or to [MASK]. The man is, after all, my cousin. It is a point of family pride.
<name>Muhammad</name>	Muhammad	Paul	He returned home briefly and confronted his family and the members of a selective service committee. These were people who had watched his growing up. They were outraged at his refusal. Watching their outrage and remaining silent made [MASK] cry inside himself.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Billy	“No,” he answered, looking out over the crowded room. “Bring me a side of fries, hold the salt.” Then he laughed, a strange, uncaring demon laughter. The sound bragged of his urge to self-destruct. Ah, [MASK]!
<name>Rearden</name>	Rearden	Thomas	From these parameters, they staked out an area between fifteen and forty percent, and agreed that someplace between these two borders lay an amount of return that could be called fair. This was easy, but then [MASK] introduced the factor of circumstance.
<name>She</name>	She	Chelseia	But in the rush of excitement while reciting the punch line, he laughed lustily, screeched, and tore off his glasses. This one gesture destroyed all his mystery. His single eye, red-rimmed and watery, flashed horribly in the soft glow of the green and red Tiffany lamp. [MASK] gasped.
<name>Arctor</name>	Arctor	Green	Again [MASK] laughed. He gulped his coffee awkwardly, as if eager to go. Yet his motions slowed once he had set his coffee cup down on the blue plastic saucer. “Place yourself in my situation,” he said, his voice high and tentative.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Virginia	“The story or the mask?” [MASK] called from the stove. She laughed with just a hint of self-derision, but the sound contained the image of a curtain being pulled across a private self. “The mask, of course!”
<name>Rooster</name>	Rooster	hisself	In fact, the average man would run away if he found [MASK] standing alone facin’ down a adversary. I have done that too many a time in my life! But not no more. Better to be once was than never was a man.
<name>Jerome</name>	Jerome	Jones	“Naw, man,” he said, his voice even but still a bit too high, “I mean what you got in the register?” And he made a fist with his right hand inside the pocket of his jacket. [MASK] eyed him, sucking his teeth.
<name>Heinrich</name>	Heinrich	Eunice	Then he shook my hand again, bowed smartly to the students, and went on his way up the block. “What was that foolishness you were talking?” [MASK] asked. The English-speaking student strolled closer to me.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Teddy	He had come down just to give us a ride home. I’ll never forget that day as long as I live. [MASK] was dressed in a pink silk shirt with black ruffles on the sleeves, the kind that was so popular a few years ago.
<name>Man</name>	Man	Lawd	[MASK], it was a sight! But even in all them lights I saw this white cop turn red in the face; his own strobe lights made his face look like it was Weedin’. I seen that. I seen the driver get out of the car.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Eunice	But the man was already moving down the hall toward the next door. “Who was it?” [MASK] asked from the bed. “Time for breakfast,” I said, and slammed the door. I had been expecting something more than a call for breakfast.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Billy	Bein’ as much like [MASK] as you are, you must understand what I’m tryin’ to say. On one of my nights off, when we went out to a movie, he asked, ‘What time did you get in this momin’?’
<name>Yura</name>	Yura	Billy	Yet she still loved her son, and often sent messages and food to him by me. But during this time I began avoiding most social contacts with [MASK], because I too believed that he was guilty. Besides, our vocabularies were growing rapidly apart.
<name>Colette</name>	Colette	Dante	I always come back for another look. I prowl the aisles and watch her. I study the face intently while I pretend to read the books. Her own imagination seems to be living elsewhere. Always open on the counter beside her register is a book by [MASK].
<name>Wong</name>	Wong	Lester	But [MASK] seems disturbed by this affirmation of her beauty from a stranger. He smiles desperately while frying hamburgers, his round eyes roaming up and down the counter. He is nervous when he makes a joke. I have never seen a Chinese insecure about his woman.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Butler	Again he shapes the white sheet-square; again he brushes. The boy steps down, still whimpering softly. The board goes back behind the hot-water tank. And [MASK] lifts him up to the long mirror. The last whiffs of steam curl out from the cooling coffee.
<name>Suttree</name>	Suttree	Billy	She say, “Now ain’t you a sight? Don’t even know whichaway is up. But you my sweetmeat now, and there ain’t a damn thing you can do about it.’ ” [MASK] looked calmly around the barroom, like a priest about to say Mass.
<name>Wesley</name>	Wesley	Aubrey	“This here’s a small dynamic. Besides, I had to cut [MASK] in on your share. You’ll get twelve, maybe more, when you line up some more of these blights on the community.”
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Clair	The second this energy made contact with his eyes he knew he loved her. [MASK]’s dress was of burnished red. Around her neck, hugging snugly against her full breasts, a string of pearls, matching her teeth in whiteness, glistened in the glare of the overhead lights.
<name>Alvin</name>	Alvin	Virginia	In the beginning it was a subtle process. During conversation someone might say a casual “You know?” and there would be a hesitation, slight at first, denying affirmation. [MASK] had painful stories to tell about increases in the periods of silence during the reacculturation.
<name>Flaubert</name>	Flaubert	Editor	This was an effort toward preserving a certain morality of technique. [MASK] speaks here of a morality of morality, of that necessary corroboration between unyielding material and the discerning eye of absolute importance in the making of a final draft.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Billy	I looked hard at him and wanted to weep. “Is that all you want?” I asked. [MASK] chewed steadily. “No,” he answered, looking out over the crowded room. “Bring me a side of fries, hold the salt.”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Rays	That’s what I’m doing. That’s all I’m doing.” ‘Til take over your regulars.” “What regulars?” [MASK] says. “There ain’t no regulars to divide. I cut your hair, you cut mine.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Reed	“In the supermarkets, you know, they have more subtle ways of accomplishing such feats.” [MASK] slapped his coffee cup with the back of his right hand. The brown liquid swirled across the counter top, wetting the books. “Damn this!”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Paul	One part of her was a resigned mother-to-be, but the other part was becoming a country teller of tall stories with an international cast. I have said it was the nature of the times. Something was also happening to [MASK].
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Lester	Well, they are not going to stand for too much of that They’ll make you suffer.” [MASK] calls down the counter, “I don’t cheat nobody in here. I charge what I have to and get along with everybody.”
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Willis	“Now you go’n get it, no matter whichaway you turn. Don’t think that old Jones go’n keep his mouth shut about what happen today.” “What can I do?” [MASK] asked, his lowered voice begging support.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Ray	[MASK], sitting in his own chair, looks np from the paper he has been reading and says: “Hey, I see where they arrested a trig shot for tax evasion. First of the year they bound to hamstring one for example.”
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Milford	The longer [MASK] studied him, the more he became convinced that it was not the smell of the cologne but something else, possibly something about his carriage, that made him seem so familiar. The man seemed eager to be in motion.
<name>Yakov</name>	Yakov	Thomas	“Yes,” [MASK] said, sipping coffee from the Styrofoam cup. “But suppose that in addition to his hurry to sell, the owner was also of a weak soul. There are, after all, many such people.” He smiled.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Eunice	We were inside the lobby before I remembered the telephone did not work. After getting directions from a passerby and advising [MASK] to wait outside, lest the Bulgarian should be lurking in our room, the two Japanese and I walked toward a bobby station, said to be about a mile from the hotel.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Billy	Tiny flecks of dried blood flew from the keys as they clinked against the glass. Then [MASK] laughed loud and confidently. It was an even, bass-filled laughter that sounded the image of a persistent demon pounding happily against a friendly door.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Billy	At first I did not recognize [MASK]. The years had treated him so unkindly. A single red eye inspected me as I approached the booth where he sat drinking. His left eye socket was hollow, no more than a shriveled piece of flesh pressed grimly against skull.
<name>Artie</name>	Artie	Willis	You’ll get twelve, maybe more, when you line up some more of these blights on the community.” “I don’t wanna get involve no more,” [MASK] said. “I figured that. That’s why it’s six.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Red	He said, ‘It’s time for you to go home,’ with that voice of his that was too cold to be called just mean. I sat there lookin’ up at him. [MASK]’s voice was even colder.
<name>Marco</name>	Marco	Green	“I did not make the world,” [MASK] began, recognizing at once the seriousness in her stare. “My father came to this country with nothing but his shirt. He was exploited for as long as he couldn’t help himself. He did not protest or picket.
<name>Roark</name>	Roark	Butler	[MASK] loosens the smile and lowers his voice. “No,” he says. “Better go somewhere else. I got me some heavy hands.” The young man laughs. “A heavy hand make a rusty register in your business, don’t it?”
<name>He</name>	He	Butler	It ain’t their fault you goin’ out of business.” [MASK] looks over at her. She is chewing with a deliberation calculated to enrage him into an argument. “Whose fault you reckon it is?” he demands. She continues chewing, looking wise.
<name>Green</name>	Green	Insufficient	The grocer smiled. “There is your answer,” he told his wife. “Green is the only color I am interested in.” His wife did not smile. “[MASK],” she said. ‘The world is mad!” he moaned.
<name>Clarence</name>	Clarence	Billy	He broke up your romance with [MASK], then he lived off you, cheated on you, and cut you when you confronted him.” So pathetic and gross seemed her elevation of the fellow that I abandoned all sense of caution.
<name>Snip</name>	Snip	Butler	“A heavy hand make a rusty register in your business, don’t it?” And backs out the door before the barber can form an answer. At the end of the day some regulars do come in; but they are losing more hairs than [MASK] clips.
<name>Manny</name>	Manny	Lester	They just want to teach us there ain’t no such thing as a jree lunch!” He smiles benignly around the counter. Everyone is silent, watching him. [MASK] concentrates on scraping hot grease from his grill.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Dewey	But there wasn’t no sense in takin’ a chance like that. A guy would have to be crazy to call a bluff like that,” he said, peering through his fingers at [MASK]. “I tell you, his hands was under the counter.”
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Slick	As a matter of fact, he did not know this for certain, but he did not really want to do the job. Also, no one could remember having seen [MASK] around the neighborhood for the past three years.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Billy	Later, when [MASK] asked me what I said, I told him there wasn’t no use tryin’ to fight the government. ‘That’s true,’ he told me— and I thought I saw some meanness in his eyes—‘but there are some other things you can fight,’ he said.
<name>Yankel</name>	Yankel	Ray	[MASK] looks sad. His fat jaws break out in sweat. He wipes it away, turning up the edge of his mustache. Lately he has taken to wearing his hair long about his ears: a steady warning, but of unsuspected proportions.
<name>Rosalie</name>	Rosalie	Red	He sat across from me, flashin’ those diamond rings every time he poured more Scotch in our cups. [MASK] was sittin’ back with a smile on her face, watchin’ us like a cat that had just ate.
<name>Baley</name>	Baley	Smothers	“Are you authorized to choose, arbitrarily, a test of your own devising?” “My choice was not arbitrary!” [MASK] protested. “The policy is to use that one on the scene. Usually, the others are given down at the station.”
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Billy	She is steady and refined, and will bear me sturdy children. In short, [MASK], in my manhood I have become aware of complexity. You owe it to the family, and to the memory of your mother, to do the same.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Gentlemens	[MASK], the onliest thing I regret is the gun broke before I could pump more than six slugs into the sonofabitch.” Thus ensuring his doom, the defendant sat down. The entire courtroom was hushed, except for defense counsel’s condemnation of his client.
<name>Lindenberry</name>	Lindenberry	Franklin	mr. lindenberry: At this point it is really not in my interest to object, but I will. Hearsay. Besides, the best witness is available right in this courtroom. court: Again I ask, [MASK], where is this going?
<name>Selina</name>	Selina	Clair	Oh, don’t my baby look fine, though?” He turned his head and [MASK] looked beautiful. Her smooth brown face had rounded some, but it still projected, when she smiled, an aura of careless energy, promising the most subtle excitement to anyone on whom she looked.
<name>Mrs. Hudson</name>	Mrs. Hudson	Eunice	The taller student spoke to his companion. “He complains for police,” the spokesman translated. I agreed that should be done. Leaving [MASK] at the table gloating pridefully over the sharpness of her insight, I led the two students back into the kitchen.
<name>Thurlow</name>	Thurlow	Paul	The eyes were mere slits. Teeth protruded from a broad mouth at unexpected angles. From the forehead of the face, curving upward, were appendages resembling a mountain goat’s horns. [MASK] sipped his wine. He said, “It’s very nice.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Milford	It was a close-up of her face as it must have looked years ago. There were fewer wrinkles and no strains of gray in her ebony-black hair. She was smiling contentedly. This, [MASK] thought, was not the face of an alcoholic.
<name>She</name>	She	Virginia	I said, “A descendant of Proteus, an expression of the highest form of freedom.” He hung up on me. I did not call him back. I was convinced he had to earn his own definitions. In early March [MASK] found out she was pregnant
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Clair	He did not turn to look with the others. “May I have your attention, please,” [MASK]’s voice called again. There was a rapping of glasses, a clearing of throats, all from the same direction. The noise in the room did not abate.
<name>Mr. Grant</name>	Mr. Grant	Franklin	Where do you hope to take us, [MASK]? mr. grant: I am only trying to show the jurors that the defendant had an interest in his son’s education. I want to show that he placed much value on his boy’s progress.
<name>Maya</name>	Maya	Virginia	In late February, when he was walking with [MASK] in the rain through the Sunset district, two younger children called him nigger. “What’s a nigger?” he asked me on the telephone. “I mean, what does it really mean to you?”
<name>Yoko</name>	Yoko	Clair	At the gate, when he kissed [MASK] again, he felt the mystery calling him on. It seemed to be saying, “Here. Here." It was a quiet sound speaking secretly inside him. In the airport coffee shop they sat quietly and looked each other over.
<name>Asimov</name>	Asimov	Boone	At this point the defendant interrupted. The judge placed the page neatly, face down, on the top of the pile. Elbow Room “[MASK]’s genius was to recognize the difficulty as neither material nor political but one purely moral and aesthetic.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Paul	[MASK]’s many books were stacked neatly in high brown bookcases in the small living room. The few times I saw them after the wedding they seemed very happy. They seemed eager to pick up and mend the broken pieces of fragmented lives.
<name>Roseanne</name>	Roseanne	Virginia	[MASK] now wore a maternity smock over her pants, but her mug’s cap still rode defiantly atop her curly hair. Her belly protruded with the expanding child. Her brown cheeks were fleshy and her eyes looked very tired. She said, “I’m black.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Robert	But he does have a genius for cars, for repairing cars. He repaired cars on weekends at his home. But for some reason he was ashamed of this. He came to me one Sunday and confided that he was losing the respect of his oldest boy, [MASK], Jr.
<name>Jeff</name>	Jeff	Tommy	“Then you should of sent him somewhere else!” [MASK]’s mouth is open. He is crying without sound. “Look at him! You can’t tell me he don’t look better now.” “We go’n close you down, old man.
<name>Anse</name>	Anse	Butler	“Times being what they is in religion and all,” he says, “I been wonderin’ what you been plannin’ to do.” “About what?” [MASK] says, not pausing in his work.
<name>Raymond</name>	Raymond	Butler	Maybe we ousrht to go into processes. Nobody can say now that’s imitating the white man. And there’s guys on the block still wearing them.” [MASK] turns from the window, his face twitching. Images of winos and hustlers flash through his mind.
<name>God</name>	God	Church	Just look at that boy cuss. I want to cut him down, [MASK], but I ain’t got the strength. My arm is raised up to him, but my razor’s kind of rusty. So can I git an anien over here ... ?”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Louis	The women looked sober. But the older men, [MASK] saw, fidgeted uncomfortably, like little boys in church accused of mischief. Plump, round-faced, stylishly dressed, they seemed to him now sullen, now bored, then restless.
<name>Helga</name>	Helga	Hindus	Deciding then that [MASK] were more “black” than anyone she had ever seen at home, she began calling herself “nigger” in an affirmative and ironic way. She developed a most subtle and delicious sense of humor.
<name>Obama</name>	Obama	Paul	I closed my own eyes and tried to lose myself in the music. But I was made humble and hopeful by that other thing, and I thought to myself, This one’s a man. From January on, [MASK] began confronting the hidden dimensions of his history.
<name>Tina</name>	Tina	Clair	He stepped past [MASK], grabbed a dress from its hanger, and threw it at her. “Wear this!” he shouted. “There’s so many lights in this city, a mismatched one won’t dull the glow of things.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Green	Many of them he had carried on the cuff during hard times. Yet, through some mysterious access to a television station, the poor folk were now empowered to make grand denunciations of the grocer. [MASK]’s children now saw their father’s business being picketed on the Monday evening news.
<name>Korean</name>	Korean	Chinese	Standing straight as a Samurai, he seemed more intent on studying my movements, without seeming to, than on commandeering the john. I wanted to communicate with him, but did not want to presume that he spoke English. To further compound the problem, I could not tell if he was Japanese or [MASK].
<name>Capone</name>	Capone	Dewey	[MASK] himself argued that at least four guys were looking for him, day and night, and liked it known that he walked the streets unarmed, all the time. In fact, each time he was seen walking, his reputation grew.
<name>Boomer</name>	Boomer	Dewey	The funds from this one joint is pure chicken shit compared to the total proceeds we could plow back into community organizations by combining our individual efforts into one dynamic and profound creative approach.” “Yeah?” asked [MASK], his head cocked to the side.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Louis	“You looked so good when you had that beard,” she told him. “I can’t see why you went and cut it off.” [MASK] stood holding her hand. While his eyes lingered on her face, he tried to recall the outcome of this lovers’ rendezvous.
