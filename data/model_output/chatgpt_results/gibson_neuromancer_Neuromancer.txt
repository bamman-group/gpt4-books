<name>Case</name>	Case	Case	The second step took her over an outstretched arm. Uniform sleeve bright with fresh blood. Glimpse of a shattered fiberglass shockstave. Her vision seemed to have narrowed to a tunnel. With the third step. [MASK] screamed and found himself back in the matrix.
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	CASE	[MASK], flashed her chip. “Hey,” she said. “Waiting for a guide.” She settled back on her haunches, the arms and knees of her Modem suit the color of the blue-gray paint on the girders.
<name>Bud</name>	Bud	Maelcum	“What? He’s takin’ off? Shit!” He kicked off from the bulkhead and shot through the tangle of printout. “We gotta open this door, man!” But [MASK] could only tap the side of his helmet.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Case	Save a little money_____I got the one who had the laser to tell me all about it. Coincidence we were here, but I had to make sure.” Her mouth was hard, lips pressed into a thin line. [MASK] felt as though his brain were jammed.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Case	His suit had taken on a weird angular pattern of beige and pale avocado. “She needed her medical team. She’s with them. We’ll watch out for her. Everything’s fine.” He smiled again. “Pay him,” [MASK] said.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Case	It’s time we talk.” It was a chip voice. “Don’t you want to talk, [MASK]?” He hung up. On his way back to the lobby, his cigarettes forgotten, he had to walk the length of the ranked phones.
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Molly	“She dreamed of a state involving very little in the way of individual consciousness,” 3Jane was saying. She cupped a large cameo in her hand, extending it toward [MASK]. The carved profile was very much like her own. “Animal bliss.
<name>Case</name>	Case	Armitage	[MASK] walked to the opposite end of the projection. “This end does.” The interior detail of the hologram ended here, and the final segment of the spindle was empty. “This is the Villa Straylight. Steep climb out of gravity and every approach is kinked.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Maelcum	Into [MASK]’s stare. “You dead awhile there, mon.” “It happens,” he said. “I’m getting used to it.” “You dealin’ wi’ th’ darkness, mon.” “Only game in town, it looks like.”
<name>Disneyland</name>	Disneyland	Cath	And none of this was anything like the Villa Stray-light he would have expected, some cross between [MASK]’s fairy tale castle and a half-remembered childhood fantasy of the Yakuza’s inner sanctum. 07:02:18. One and a half hours.
<name>Casey</name>	Casey	Case	If she remained in the building for more than twenty minutes, it was highly unlikely she’d be coming out at all. [MASK] gulped the last of his coffee, settled the trodes in place, and scratched his chest beneath his black t-shirt.
<name>Cheryl</name>	Cheryl	Case	Sick, [MASK] decided. Or drugs. “I don’t cry, much.” “But how would you cry, if someone made you cry?” “I spit,” she said. “The ducts are routed back into my mouth.”
<name>Chunk</name>	Chunk	Case	Beyond the white pool furniture, there was darkness, shadows of the ragged, waist-high maze of partially demolished walls. The water lapped patiently against the side of the pool. “They’re here,” [MASK] said. “They gotta be.”
<name>the fish</name>	the fish	Maelcum	A pale corrugated gangway curved out of the yacht, snaked sideways to avoid the tug’s engines, and covered the aft hatch. There was something obscene about the arrangement, but it had more to do with ideas of feeding than of sex. “What’s happening with [MASK]?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Marlene	They’d each had a dozen beers, the afternoon a wasp stung [MASK]. “Kill the fuckers,” she said, her eyes dull with rage and the still heat of the room, “bum ’em.”
<name>she</name>	she	Case	A dozen meters ahead, the tunnel curved. Harsh yellow light threw hard shadows on the seamed pseudo-rock of the walls. With a start, [MASK] realized that the gravity here was near earth normal, which meant that she’d had to descend again, after the climb.
<name>Virgil</name>	Virgil	Hideo’ll	“[MASK] get him, even blind?” he asked 3Jane. “When I was a child,” she said, “we loved to blindfold him. He put arrows through the pips in playing cards at ten meters.”
<name>Clarice</name>	Clarice	Peter	Give her something. For that and for the pain. She’s very striking, don’t you think, [MASK]? These glasses, are they a fashion where she comes from?” Cool hands, unhurried, with a surgeon’s certainty. The sting of a needle.
<name>Shadow</name>	Shadow	Riviera	“I have an audition this afternoon,” [MASK] said. “I’ll need to be at my best.” He cupped the foil packet in his upturned palm and smiled. Small glittering insects swarmed out of it, vanished. He dropped it into the pocket of his seersucker blouse.
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Molly	They chose to regard the entire operation as an elaborate private joke, and their choice of comsats seemed to have been deliberate. [MASK]’s signals were being beamed up from a one-meter umbrella dish epoxy-ed to the roof of a black glass bank tower nearly as tall as the Sense/Net building.
<name>Meursault</name>	Meursault	Molly	You’re real scared.” It was Sunday afternoon and he stood with [MASK] in a sort of courtyard. White boulders, a stand of green bamboo, black gravel raked into smooth waves. A gardener, a thing like a large metal crab, was tending the bamboo.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Peter	I learned it as a child. 1 think I learned it in a dream.... Or somewhere in the thousand hours of my mother’s diaries. But I think that [MASK] has a point, in urging me not to surrender it.
<name>Trinity</name>	Trinity	Ninsei	Get just wasted enough, find yourself in some desperate but strangely arbitrary kind of trouble, and it was possible to see [MASK] as a field of data, the way the matrix had once reminded him of proteins linking to distinguish cell specialties.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Molly	The corridor widened. The sea of rich carpets undulated gently beneath an enormous candelabrum whose lowest crystal pendant reached nearly to the floor. Crystal tinkled as [MASK] entered the hall. THIRD DOOR LEFT, blinked the readout. She turned left, avoiding the inverted tree of crystal.
<name>Case</name>	Case	Case	“Go on. You’ll enjoy this, [MASK]. Like Christmas morning.” Summer in the Sprawl, the mall crowds swaying like windblown grass, a field of flesh shot through with sudden eddies of need and gratification.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Case	The shadow thing was growing, spreading, blotting out the city of data. [MASK] took them straight up, above them the distanceless bowl of jade-green ice. The city of the cores was gone now, obscured entirely by the dark beneath them.
<name>Jordan</name>	Jordan	Marlene	When he did hit the ignition, it exploded with a thump, taking an eyebrow with it. Five floors above him, from the open window, he heard [MASK] laughing. He woke with the impression of light fading, but the room was dark.
<name>Deckard</name>	Deckard	Case	Hood up to hide the pink, the suit exactly the right shade of gray, mottled and stained as the sidewalk he stood on. The eyes winked back the red of a stoplight. And then he was really gone. [MASK] closed his eyes, massaged them with numb fingers, leaning back against peeling brickwork.
<name>Mark</name>	Mark	Riviera	“I heard that about lots of different things. You always make it into a little show?” [MASK] loosened and removed the elastic length of surgical tubing from his arm. “Yes. It’s more fun.” He smiled, his eyes distant now, cheeks flushed.
<name>Offred</name>	Offred	Terzi	He’s done eighteen in three years. All women age twenty to twenty-five. It kept [MASK] in dissidents.” She thrust her hands into her jacket pockets. “Because if he found one he really wanted, he’d make sure she turned political.
<name>Case</name>	Case	Maelcum	[MASK] nudged him, pointed, and he saw a monitor set into a curved wall. On the screen, a tall young man with the Tessier-Ashpool features was brushing something from the sleeves of his dark suitcoat. He stood beside an identical hatch, in an identical chamber.
<name>3Jane</name>	3Jane	Molly	“Where’d he go?” [MASK] asked. “To take his shot?” 3Jane shrugged beneath the folds of the pale heavy robe and tossed a strand of dark hair away from her eyes. “He told me when to let you in,” she said.
<name>Mark</name>	Mark	Molly	“How about me?” [MASK] asked. “I got chores today?” “I want you to hike up the far end to the axis, work out in zero-g. Tomorrow, maybe, you can hike in the opposite direction.”
<name>Case</name>	Case	Case	“So it’s getting ready to bum itself?” [MASK] began to punch the deck nervously, at random. The matrix blurred, resolved, and he saw the complex of pink spheres representing a sikkim steel combine.
<name>Leo</name>	Leo	Riviera	“He killed the puppet. It looked like you.” “He was fond of broad gestures,” she said, and then [MASK] was beside her, radiant with drugs, in the seersucker convict outfit he’d worn in the roof garden of their hotel.
<name>her</name>	her	Case	The ugliness of the door struck [MASK] as she reached for it. Not the door itself, which was beautiful, or had once been part of some more beautiful whole, but the way it had been sawn down to fit a particular entrance.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Ali	“It’s the meperidine. I had [MASK] make me up a custom batch. Speeded up the reaction times with higher temperatures. A'-methyl-4-phenyl-1236,” she sang, like a child reciting the steps of a sidewalk game, “tetra-hydro-pyridene.”
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Case	Give me the mainland for a nerve job any day. Fix you right, mate____” “Now that,” [MASK] said to his glass, all his bitterness suddenly rising in him like bile, “that is so much bullshit.”
<name>Vesper Lynd</name>	Vesper Lynd	Case	“It would be customary,” the old man said, “for me to kill you now.” [MASK] felt her tense, ready for a move. “But tonight I indulge myself. What is your name?”
<name>Rasta</name>	Rasta	Aerol	[MASK], with no particular provocation, related the tale of the baby who had burst from his forehead and scampered into a forest of hydroponic ganja. “Ver’ small baby, mon, no long’ you finga.” He rubbed his palm across an unscarred expanse of brown forehead and smiled.
<name>Sonny's</name>	Sonny's	TTie	I guess it’s your show. But all this shit, you know, it’s getting kind of.. .old.” He raised the gun with both hands, aiming for the center of the desk, and pulled the trigger. [MASK] recoil nearly broke his wrist.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Terzibashjian	The pavement was uneven and smelled of a century’s dripping gasoline, absorbed by ancient limestone. “Can’t see shit,” he whispered to the Finn. “That’s okay for sweetmeat,” the Finn said. “Quiet,” said [MASK], too loudly.
<name>Cortana</name>	Cortana	Molly	My mind. It’s my party. The cores woke me. Twenty hours ago. Something was afoot, they said, and I was needed. Were you the something, [MASK]? Surely they didn’t need me to handle you, no. Something else...
<name>Mr. Bell</name>	Mr. Bell	Armitage	“Truer words were never spoken.” “I let you out of my sight for two hours and you score.” She shook her head. “I hope you’re gonna be ready for our big dinner date with [MASK] tonight. This Twentieth Century place.
<name>Casey</name>	Casey	Molly	[MASK] ignored her, bending over to peel the derm from the guard’s neck. Then she kicked the white pants and the pink raincoat out the door, tossing the dark glasses after them, and drew the hood of her suit down across her forehead.
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Case	The library, the white steel shelves with their labels. “I know where we are,” [MASK] said. He looked back at the service cart. A curl of smoke was rising from the carpet. “So come on,” he said.
<name>John Wayne</name>	John Wayne	Pauley	Had themself two goddam brains, one in the head an’ one by the tailbone, kept the hind legs movin’. Hit that black stuff and ol’ tailbrain jus’ kept right on keepin’ on.” The cowboy elite in the Loser shunned [MASK] out of some strange group anxiety, almost a superstition.
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Molly	The operation hadn’t worked. He was still here, still meat, no [MASK] waiting, her eyes locked on the circling knives, no Armitage waiting in the Hilton with tickets and a new passport and money. It was all some dream, some pathetic fantasy....
<name>Casey</name>	Casey	Case	“Yeah,” said the Finn, somewhere behind him, “you got it.” “Fuck off.” [MASK] sat up, rubbing his wrists. “Come on,” said the Finn, stepping out of a sort of alcove in the wall of junk.
<name>Cyberspace</name>	Cyberspace	Case	The key rotated smoothly when she tried it. “The head,” [MASK] said, “there’s a panel in the back of the head. Zircons on it. Get it off. That’s where I’m jacking in.” And then they were inside.
<name>Mr. Tilly</name>	Mr. Tilly	Ashpool	The betaphenethylamine gave it a voice. It wouldn’t stop. Not in the crowded gallery, the long corridors, not as it passed the black glass entrance to the T-A crypt, the vaults where the cold had seeped so gradually into old [MASK]’s dreams.
<name>Case</name>	Case	Yonderboy	“Wintermute,” [MASK] repeated, nodding, bobbing his crest of pink hair. His suit went matte black, a carbon shadow against old concrete. He executed a strange little dance, his thin black arms whirling, and then he was gone. No.
<name>Case</name>	Case	Case	Some of the material had been print records, reeling smoothly down the screen, too quickly, and [MASK] had had to ask the computer to read them for him. Other segments were audio recordings of the Screaming Fist hearing.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Wintermute	It made him remember the magnetic locks on the door of her cubicle in the puppet place. The door had opened for him, even though he’d had the wrong chip. That was [MASK], manipulating the lock the way it had manipulated the drone micro and the robot gardener.
<name>Case</name>	Case	Case	[MASK] felt the stuff had grown somehow during their absence. Or else it seemed that it was changing subtly, cooking itself down under the pressure of time, silent invisible flakes settling to form a mulch, a crystalline essence of discarded technology, flowering secretly in the Sprawl’s waste places.
<name>Eddie</name>	Eddie	Case	I was real happy. You ever been happy, [MASK]? He was my boy. We worked together. Partners. I was maybe eight weeks out of the puppet house when I met him....” She paused, edged around a sharp turn, and continued.
<name>Julius</name>	Julius	Finn	“Yeah, it’s all weird. You’re weird, this hole’s weird, and who’s the weird little gopher outside in the hall?” “[MASK]’s an old connection of mine. Fence, mostly. Software. This privacy biz is a sideline.
<name>Trishka</name>	Trishka	Bonn	Holograms twisted and shuddered to the roaring of the games, ghosts overlapping in the crowded haze of the place, a smell of sweat and bored tension. A sailor in a white t-shirt nuked [MASK] on a Tank War console, an azure flash.
<name>??? (unknown)</name>	??? (unknown)	Dying	I built all this, and now I’m busy. [MASK].” “I could go out the way I came,” she said. He laughed, a harsh high sound. “You intrude on my suicide and then ask to simply walk out?
<name>Orpheus</name>	Orpheus	Neuro	[MASK] from the nerves, the silver paths. Romancer. Nec- romancer. I call up the dead. But no, my friend,” and the boy did a little dance, brown feet printing the sand, “I am the dead, and their land.”
<name>Bobby</name>	Bobby	Case	The dragon was a Frisco flamethrower, a thing like a fat anglehead flashlight. [MASK] checked the batteries, shook it to make sure he had enough fuel, and went to the open window. The hive began to buzz. The air in the Sprawl was dead, immobile.
<name>William</name>	William	Maelcum	[MASK]’s Zion dub. There was a gray place, an impression of fine screens shifting, moire, degrees of half tone generated by a very simple graphics program. There was a long hold on a view through chainlink, gulls frozen above dark water.
<name>it</name>	it	SAS	“You’ve still got [MASK]. You won’t have time for it to wear off. You’re going to learn to work with it.” “So I do the run from here?” “No.
<name>Case</name>	Case	Case	[MASK] jacked in and flipped for the matrix. “Get my wire?” “Yeah.” He saw that the Chinese program had grown; delicate arches of shifting polychrome were nearing the T-A ice. “Well, it’s gettin’ stickier,” the Flatline said.
<name>T-A</name>	T-A	Peter	A patch of brilliantly white micropore covered her damaged lens; the other flashed emptily as her head bobbed with the motion of the chair. “A familiar face,” 3Jane said, “I saw you the night of [MASK]’s show. And who is this?”
<name>Liz</name>	Liz	Marlene	He’d spent a month, his fifteenth summer, in a weekly rates hotel, fifth floor, with a girl called [MASK]. The elevator hadn’t worked in a decade. Roaches boiled across grayish porcelain in the drain-plugged kitchenette when you flicked a lightswitch.
<name>Deckard</name>	Deckard	Ratz	“Super fine.” He sagged into the chair opposite [MASK], hands still in his pockets. “And you wander back and forth in this portable bombshelter built of booze and ups, sure. Proof against the grosser emotions, yes?”
<name>Major</name>	Major	Case	Sir,” he added, on impulse. “But, sir. Colonel, what exactly should we do? Now, I mean.” “Our duty at this point, [MASK], lies in flight. Escape. Evasion.
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Molly	“Another injection, probably,” 3Jane said, straightening up. “He was quite impatient for your arrival. I think it might be fun to nurse you back to health, [MASK].” She smiled, absently wiping a bloody hand down the front of the robe.
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Molly	3Jane asked, her voice a child’s. “I think you would.” “The code,” [MASK] said. “Tell the head the code.” Jacking out. “She wants it,” he screamed, “the bitch wants it!”
<name>Lolita</name>	Lolita	Michael	He found a girl who called herself [MASK]. And one October night, punching himself past the scarlet tiers of the Eastern Seaboard Fission Authority, he saw three figures, tiny, impossible, who stood at the very edge of one of the vast steps of data.
<name>Chili</name>	Chili	Armitage	[MASK] got dissolving inside you?” “I’m an easy make.” She smiled. “Anybody any good at what they do, that’s what they are, right? You gotta jack, I gotta tussle.” He stared at her.
<name>Trish</name>	Trish	Case	“Not really,” [MASK] said. “That’s a problem?” “Just go down to the lowest level and find your friend’s cubicle. If they let you in, fine. If they don’t wanna see you...” She shrugged.
<name>Bubba</name>	Bubba	Case	You may know him by a code name. You do know the man of whom I speak.” “Yeah,” [MASK] said, as the tears continued to flow, “I guess I do. Sir,” he added, on impulse.
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Riviera	The black flower lay at the foot of the bed, still seething with its blue inner flame. Then the torso formed, as [MASK] caressed it into being, white, headless, and perfect, sheened with the faintest gloss of sweat.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Echoes	“I had a cigarette and a girl and a place to sleep. Do you hear me, you son of a bitch? You hear me?” [MASK] moved through the hollow of the arcade, fading down corridors of consoles. He stepped out into the street.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Molly	Just say it was [MASK]. He’ll know. Okay?” She glanced around the empty hallway, the bare walls. The floor here was raw lunar concrete and the air smelled of resins. “Shit, man, I don’t even know if you’re listening.”
<name>probably</name>	probably	Case	Speeded up the reaction times with higher temperatures. A'-methyl-4-phenyl-1236,” she sang, like a child reciting the steps of a sidewalk game, “tetra-hydro-pyridene.” “A hotshot,” [MASK] said.
<name>Case</name>	Case	Case	Bought a go-to for each of your aliases and ran the skim through some military software. You’re suicidal. [MASK]. The model gives you a month on the outside. And our medical projection says you’ll need a new pancreas inside a year.”
<name>Marla Singer</name>	Marla Singer	Case	His shaven head was filmed with sweat. “You look bad, friend artiste,” he said, flashing the wet ruin of his teeth. “I’m doing just fine,” said [MASK], and grinned like a skull. “Super fine.”
<name>Phineas</name>	Phineas	Hideo	[MASK] was another. Ageless, he radiated a sense of qu:et, an utter calm. He wore clean, frayed khaki workpants and soft dark shoes that fit his feet like gloves, split at the toes like tabi socks.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Case	“Well, I’ll tell you, the man’s definitely on to something. He’s got big money now, and he’s never had it before, and he gets more all the time.” [MASK] noticed a certain tension around her mouth.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Riviera	He was projecting. [MASK] smiled. He wore a white dinner jacket. On his lapel, blue coals burned in the depths of a black carnation. His fingernails flashed as he raised his hands in a gesture of greeting, an embrace for his audience.
<name>unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Finn	They crossed die lobby. “How much you get paid to come over here, [MASK]?” She lowered her bag beside die armchair. “Bet not as much as you get for wearing that suit, huh7"
<name>3Jane</name>	3Jane	Molly	“Take this off,” [MASK] said, raising her captive hands. “You killed my father,” 3Jane said, no change whatever in her tone. “I was watching on the monitors. My mother’s eyes, he called them.”
<name>Casey</name>	Casey	Case	“Stay in web ’til 1 tell you.” He tapped a final sequence into the module and grabbed the worn pink handholds on either side of the navigation board. [MASK] saw the green square shrink a final few millimeters to overlap the red square.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Moll	Quick, nicotine-stained fingers secured it with a white velcro border. A hidden exhaust fan began to purr. “Time,” the man said, straightening up, “and counting. You know the rate, [MASK].”
<name>Finn</name>	Finn	Wintermute	But you had to be. Our 3Jane, she’s too jaded now to open the back door for just any petty thief. So [MASK] dug you up. The ultimate taste, if your taste runs that way. Demon lover.
<name>lobster</name>	lobster	Jane	He coughed wetly, the muzzle of the pistol jerking as he convulsed. He spat on the carpet near his one bare foot. “How I do wander. Through the cold. But soon no more. I’d ordered a [MASK] thawed, when I woke.
<name>Truman</name>	Truman	Case	The one we bought for you frees you from a dangerous dependency.” “Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.” “Good, because you have a new one.” “How’s that?” [MASK] looked up from his coffee.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Terzibashjian	His ears rang. Then the light returned, bobbing now, searching the shadows. [MASK] was leaning against a steel door, his face very white in the glare. He held his left wrist and watched blood drip from a wound in his left hand.
<name>he</name>	he	Maelcum	The yacht, which had been assembled in orbit, had never been intended for re-entry. Her smooth, wasplike line was simply styling, and everything about her interior was calculated to add to the overall impression of speed. When [MASK] removed his battered helmet.
<name>Logen</name>	Logen	Case	[MASK] remembered, the fingers curled, thumb aligned with blade. The knives seemed to move of their own accord, gliding with a ritual lack of urgency through the arcs and passes of their dance, point passing point, as the men waited for an opening.
<name>Jay Gatsby</name>	Jay Gatsby	Case	The two men sat side by side on the couch, their arms crossed over tanned chests, identical gold chains slung around their necks. [MASK] peered at them and saw that their youth was counterfeit, marked by a certain telltale corrugation at the knuckles, something the surgeons were unable to erase.
<name>Red</name>	Red	Pauley	There were at least twenty other hopefuls ghosting the Loser, that summer, each one bent on working joeboy for some cowboy. No other way to learn. They’d all heard of [MASK], the redneck jockey from the ’Lanta fringes, who’d survived braindeath behind black ice.
<name>Case</name>	Case	Case	“Well, come on. I’ll show you a little bit of Straylight while I got you here.” He lifted the comer of the blanket. White light poured out. “Shit, man, don’t just stand there.” [MASK] followed, rubbing his face.
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Molly	Numbered doors. A hush like the halls of an expensive clinic. He found his cubicle. He’d been looking for [MASK]’s; now, confused, he raised his chip and placed it against a black sensor set directly beneath the number plate. Magnetic locks.
<name>Casey</name>	Casey	Armitage	[MASK] had them designed to bypass that shit.” She tapped the octagon with one burgundy nail. “You’re biochemically incapable of getting off on amphetamine or cocaine.” “Shit,” he said. He looked at the octagon, then at her.
<name>partner</name>	partner	Julie	“Just taking care, you understand. Nothing personal. Now tell me what you want.” “I need a history lesson, [MASK]. And a go-to on somebody.” “What’s moving, old son?”
<name>the buyer</name>	the buyer	Armitage	Not the hamburger that got tossed out of sight. Real cute. Well, help ’em get his ass outa here. I gotta scan all that gear before he wakes up, make sure [MASK] is getting his money’s worth.”
