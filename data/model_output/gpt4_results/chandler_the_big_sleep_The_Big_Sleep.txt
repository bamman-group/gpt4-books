<name>Geiger</name>	Geiger	Vivian	We walked up the steps and around to my car. The gardens seemed deserted. The sunshine was as empty as a headwaiter’s smile. We got into the car and I drove down the sunken driveway and out through the gates. "Where’s [MASK]?”
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Geiger	1 went through the house again. Everything was exactly as it had been. [MASK] wasn’t in his flounced bed or under it or in his closet. He wasn’t in the kitchen or the bathroom. That left the locked door on the right of the hall.
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Brody	You with a gun in your hand and him holding nothing but a cigar and his thumb?” “I like it,” [MASK] said. “The guy’s got good ideas. Shut your trap and keep it shut, or I’ll slap it shut for you with this.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Agnes	“Listen, you got what you came after, got it plenty cheap. You done a nice neat job. Now go peddle it to your top man. I’m clean. I don’t know nothing about any photo, do I, [MASK]?”
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Swell	He exploded then. “That goddamned little hot pants!” 82 he yelled. “She would, god damn her! She would—just that! I leaned back and grinned at him. “[MASK]. I thought you had those nude photos of her.”
<name>Wolfe</name>	Wolfe	Ohls	[MASK] looked sideways along his eyes at me, and twitched his little cigar like a cigarette. “Drunk?” he asked, of nobody in particular. The man who had been toweling his head went over to the rail and cleared his throat in a loud hawk that made everybody look at him.
<name>Marcone</name>	Marcone	Eddie	I’ll go see him after I get some rest. I’ll handle [MASK].” “He’ll try to kill you.” “Yeah,” I said. “His best boy couldn’t. I’ll take a chance on the others.
<name>George</name>	George	Carmen	I took [MASK]'s little revolver out of my pocket. The sound of the steps grew louder, and the whistling went on cheerfully. In a moment the jerkin showed. I stepped out between the two cars and said: "Got a match, buddy?”
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Joe	We ain’t licked yet, baby.” “Oh, [MASK],” the blonde wailed. She came over and sat next to me on the davenport and pointed the gun at my leg artery. I didn’t like the jerky look in her eyes.
<name>Wolfsheim</name>	Wolfsheim	Gregory	We’re friends, aren’t we, soldier?” “Sure.” I stood up and we shook hands. “Maybe I can do you a real favor some day,” he said. “You got it all from [MASK] this time.”
<name>Pat</name>	Pat	Carmen	No excited neighbors hung out of doorways. A small gun had gone off and broken a pane of glass, but noises like that don't mean much any more. I held the door open and jerked my head at [MASK]. She came towards me, smiling uncertainly.
<name>Brigid</name>	Brigid	Harry	“You lied to him and you drank your cyanide like a little gentleman. You died like a poisoned rat, [MASK], but you’re no rat to me.” I had to search him. It was a nasty job.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Geiger	He scowled bitterly. “How’d you get to me?” I flicked my wallet out and let him look at my buzzer. “I was working on [MASK]—for a client. I was outside last night, in the rain. I heard the shots.
<name>Chalmers</name>	Chalmers	Geiger	Then [MASK] would have tightened the screws. Do you know what he was afraid of?” He was looking at me. I shook my head. “Have you told your story complete in all relevant details?” “I left out a couple of personal matters.
<name>Velma</name>	Velma	Regan	I stood up and grinned at him and started for the door. When I had almost reached it he cleared his throat suddenly and said in a harsh voice: “I’m wasting my breath, huh? You still think you can find [MASK].”
<name>Velma</name>	Velma	Agnes	“I ain’t so brittle.” “[MASK] must have something I didn’t notice.” “She’s a grifter, shamus. I’m a grifter. We re all grif-ters. So we sell each other out for a nickel.
<name>Pat</name>	Pat	Brody	‘‘I suppose that’s funny,” the blonde squealed. “It has been,” I said. “ But it probably isn’t any more.” ‘‘Save the gags,” [MASK] advised me.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	EIGHT	It was all I could do to keep it out of my lap. [MASK] There was dim light behind narrow leaded panes in the side door of the Stern wood mansion. I stopped the Packard under the porte-cochere and emptied my pockets out on the seat.
<name>Terry</name>	Terry	Carmen	“Was it about [MASK]?” “I can’t even say that.” I finished filling a pipe and put a match to it. She watched the smoke for a moment. Then her hand went into her open bag and came out with a thick white envelope.
<name>He</name>	He	Cronjager	I told the rest of it just as it happened. [MASK] never took his eyes off my face and no expression of any kind crossed his as I talked. At the end of it he was perfectly silent for a long minute.
<name>Rusty</name>	Rusty	Geiger	“I’m not ready to give out. Killing [MASK] to grab his racket would be a dumb trick and I’m not sure it happened that way, assuming he has been killed. But I’m sure that whoever got the books knows what’s what,
<name>Wolfsheim</name>	Wolfsheim	Geiger	Some of [MASK]’s stock was being moved out. When the door shut I put my dark glasses on again and touched my hat. “Tomorrow, then. I’d like to give you a card, but you know how it is.” “Ye-es.
<name>Doyle</name>	Doyle	Geiger	How do you figure it?” “1 think [MASK] was rubbed. I think that is his blood. And the books being moved out gives a motive for hiding the body for a while. Somebody is taking over the racket and wants a little time to organize.’’
<name>Waldo</name>	Waldo	Regan	We were alone for a minute and he asked me whether you had told me 211 you were looking for [MASK]. I said you had told me you wished you knew where he was and that he was all right.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Rusty	Meantime I am being blackmailed again.” I said: “Again?” He brought his hands from under the rug with a brown envelope in them. “I should have been very sorry for anybody who tried to blackmail me while [MASK] was around.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Eddie	The purring voice was now saying quite pleasantly: “Sure, a guy could sit on his fanny and crab what another guy done if he knows what it’s all about. So you go to see this peeper. Well, that was your mistake. [MASK] don’t like it.
<name>girl</name>	girl	Agnes	Are you a citizen?” He just stared at me, jiggling the cigarette. The blonde [MASK] turned her head slowly and stared at me along the same level. Their glances contained almost the exact same 92 blend of foxiness, doubt and frustrated anger.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Eddie	But that would be small change to what [MASK] expects to collect one of these days, wouldn’t it?” “You son of a bitch!” she said. “Uh-huh. I'm a very smart guy.
<name>Rebus</name>	Rebus	Ohls	The uniformed police driver was standing besides [MASK]’ car. The boy was inside it, leaning back sideways in the corner. “Has he said anything?” I asked. “He made a suggestion,” the copper said and spat.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Okey	I guess you thought that was a secret.’’ “Uh-huh.” “[MASK], keep buttoned, kid. No hard feelings.” He came around the desk tapping his pockets and reaching for his hat.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Eddie	“I thought [MASK] wasn’t a killer.” She turned away quickly and went back to her chair by the lamp and sat down and put her face in her hands. I swung my feet to the floor and stood up. I tottered around, stiff-legged.
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Brody	The only ways you could know enough to do that would be by seeing what happened or by holding the photo and knowing where and when it was taken. Cough up and be sensible. ” “I’d have to have a little dough, ” [MASK] said.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Wilde	He had a soft spot where he was and he walked out on it.” [MASK] snorted. “The softness of that spot neither you nor I could judge. If he was a certain sort of man, it would not have been so very soft.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Geiger	I put on another lamp and stepped into the hallway at the back of the living room. [MASK]’s bedroom didn t seem to have been touched. 1 opened the door, not locked now, of the bedroom across the hall from it.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Regan	“I’m not looking for [MASK], I said. He fixed the lock on his door and we went down to the official parking lot and got into a small blue sedan. We drove out Sunset, using the siren once in a while to beat a signal.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Ohls	“That would come under the heading of police business, ” he said. “If they did, it had three empty shells in it.” “How the hell did you know that?” [MASK] asked quietly.
<name>Velma</name>	Velma	Joe	“I was trying to get a line on you, sure,” he said. “I’ve 162 got something to sell—cheap, for a couple of C notes. How’d you tie me to [MASK]?” I opened a letter and read it.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Naughty	She said: “[MASK],” and wagged a finger at me. Then she whispered: “Can I have my gun?" “Not now. Later. I’ll bring it to you.” She grabbed me suddenly around the neck and kissed me on the mouth.
<name>Velma</name>	Velma	Agnes	The air of the room was poisonous and unreal. I went out and shut the door again and went back to the living room. The boy hadn’t moved. I stood still, listening for sirens. It was all a question of how soon [MASK] talked and what she said.
<name>Regan</name>	Regan	Carmen	It’s a question of professional pride. You know— professional pride. I’m working for your father. He’s a sick man, very frail, very helpless. He sort of trusts me not to pull any stunts. Won’t you please get dressed. [MASK]?”
<name>Velma</name>	Velma	Mona	The little man wasn’t so dumb after all. A three for a quarter grifter wouldn’t even think such thoughts, much less know how to express them. I said: “So he ran away.” “He started to run away, maybe. With this girl [MASK].
<name>Regan</name>	Regan	Eddie	She went back across the room and stood with her side to me, bent forward a little, looking down at the floor. “Why did you come here and stick your neck out?’’ she asked quietly. “[MASK] wasn’t doing you any harm.
<name>him</name>	him	merit	The three shots had been somebody else’s idea of how the proceedings might be given a new twist. The idea of the lad who had gone down the back steps and slammed into a car and raced away. I could see [MASK] in his point of view.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Geiger	The smoke came towards me in a lazy, contemptuous puff and behind it words in a cool, unhurried voice that had no more inflection than the voice of a faro dealer. “You said what?” “[MASK].
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Norris	I was thinking about going out to lunch and that life was pretty flat and that it would probably be just as flat if I took a drink and that taking a drink all alone at that time of day wouldn’t be any fun anyway. I was thinking this when [MASK] called up.
<name>Dorothy</name>	Dorothy	Vivian	She shook her head earnestly. “It’s a pushover,” I said. “You don’t have to give it another thought. Don’t tell a soul you were here, last night or today. Not even [MASK]. Just forget you were here.
<name>Chappie</name>	Chappie	Geiger	I went over and kicked at the rug that lay where [MASK] had lain. “It’s old blood,” I said. “Dried blood.” “Just the same we ll have some law. ” “Why not?” I said.
<name>Regan</name>	Regan	Geiger	She let out a thin sigh. “Wha—what do you want?” "Who killed him?” Her shoulders jerked, but nothing more moved in her face. “Who else—knows?” “About [MASK]? I don’t know.
<name>Alley</name>	Alley	Brody	He didn’t like my watching him. After a while I said: “Watch the weight, bud. She’s only tested for half a ton. Where’s the stuff going?” “[MASK], four-o-five,” he grunted.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Wilde	“Has he said anything?” I asked. “He made a suggestion,” the copper said and spat. “I’m letting it ride.” I went back into the house, put the book on [MASK]’s desk and opened up the wrappings.
<name>Doyle</name>	Doyle	Norris	He didn’t get up today. You could at least stop questioning me." “I remember a time when I thought the same about you. How much does the General know?” “He probably knows everything.” “[MASK] would tell him?”
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Brother	“So you got yourself in another jam. ” “Oh, you heard about it.” “[MASK], I sit here all day on my fanny and I don’t look as if I had a brain in my head. But you’d be surprised what I hear.
<name>Geiger</name>	Geiger	Regan	“I didn't drive down here to make a touch. I get paid for what I do. Not much by your standards, but I make out. One customer at a time is a good rule. You didn’t bump [MASK] off, did you?”
<name>Quiller</name>	Quiller	Eddie	He wrinkled his nose. “That—” he chopped it off quickly. “I expected you would know the girl,” I said. “Who got the books, soldier?” “Not ready to talk, [MASK]. Why should I?”
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Marlowe	Her eyes too. “Nice work, [MASK]. Are you my bodyguard now?” Her voice had a harsh note. “Looks that way. Here’s the bag.” She took it. I said: “Have you a car with you?”
<name>Slugger</name>	Slugger	Brody	So you ran after him and took the photo from him. How else would you have got hold of it?” [MASK] licked his lips. “Yeah,” he said. “But that don’t make me knock him off.
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Brody	He knocked ash from his cigar on the carpet and stared at me with eyes that were a tight shine between narrowed lids. “I guess you think I’m dumb,” [MASK] said. “Just average, for a grifter. Get the pictures.”
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Brody	He didn’t believe me. While he was still not believing me the door buzzer started to ring again. [MASK] stood up sharply, hardeyed. He glanced over at his guns on the desk. 95 “So she’s back again,” he growled.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Joe	She looked hurt. Her chin came down an inch. “Yes,” she said solemnly. “[MASK] did it.” “Why?” “I don’t know. ” She shook her head, persuading herself that she didn’t know.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Brody	The blonde didn’t like it. She stood up in a surge and chipped at the air with one hand. Nerve tension made her face old and ugly. Watching me, [MASK] jerked a small drawer in the desk and picked a bone-handled automatic out of it.
<name>the job</name>	the job	Brody	You’re not kidding me about [MASK]?” She shook her head earnestly. “It’s a pushover,” I said. “You don’t have to give it another thought. Don’t tell a soul you were here, last night or today.
<name>He</name>	He	Ohls	“Which means there won’t be much water in him. Which means he’s due to start getting stiff pretty quick now he’s out in the air. Better get him out of the car before he does. You won’t like doing it after.” [MASK] nodded.
<name>Canino</name>	Canino	Canino	He’s whatever looks good to him, whatever has the cabbage pinned to it. Don’t try to sell me on any high-souled racketeers. They don’t come in that pattern. ’’ “He’s not a killer.” Her nostrils flared. “Not personally. He has [MASK].
<name>Francie</name>	Francie	Okey	* “[MASK],” she giggled. I went back around the sump and set the can up in the middle of the bull wheel. It made a swell target. If she missed the can, which she was certain to do, she would probably hit the wheel.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Rusty	He had it when I married him and he had it when he left me. No—[MASK]’s not in on any cheap blackmail racket.” She reached for the envelope and stood up. “I’ll keep in touch with you,” I said.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Geiger	A radio sounded loudly from a house low down the hill. The boy swung the car over to the box hedge in front of [MASK]’s house, killed the motor and sat looking straight before him with both hands on the wheel.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Vivian	We went up the tiled staircase and turned the opposite way from [MASK]’s room. With each step the house seemed to grow larger and more silent. We reached a massive old door that looked as if it had come out of a church.
<name>Velma</name>	Velma	Canino	A little 195 bird that used to hop in and out of cocktail bars picking up horse bets for crumbs. Picking up information too. This little bird picked up an idea about [MASK]. One way and another he and his friends found out where you were.
<name>Johnson</name>	Johnson	Realito	“Open up. I’ve got two flats back on the highway and only one spare. I need help. " “Sorry, mister. We re closed up. [MASK]’s a mile west. Better try there.” I didn't like that.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Carmen	I saw [MASK] about halfway down, sitting on a stone bench, with her head between her hands, looking forlorn and alone. I went down the red brick steps that led from terrace to terrace. I was quite close before she heard me.
<name>Gray</name>	Gray	THIRTEEN	[MASK] He was a gray man, all gray, except for his polished black shoes and two scarlet diamonds in his gray satin tie that looked like the diamonds on roulette layouts. His shirt was gray and his double-breasted suit of soft, beautifully cut flannel.
<name>Geiger</name>	Geiger	Canino	The house had already gone dark. That was all. I dropped quietly on the running board and waited. No soap. [MASK] was too cagey. I straightened up and got into the car backwards, fumbled around for the ignition key and turned it.
<name>Leslie</name>	Leslie	Regan	“You tire me,” she said in a dead, exhausted voice. “God, how you tire me!” “I’m sorry. I’m not just fooling around trying to be clever. Your father offered me a thousand dollars this morning to find [MASK].
<name>Terry</name>	Terry	Regan	“A nice new Buick sedan all messed up with sand and sea water. . . . Oh, I almost forgot. There’s a guy inside it.” I let my breath out so slowly that it hung on my lip. “[MASK]?”
<name>Levy</name>	Levy	Geiger	After lunch I walked east on the boulevard to have another look at [MASK]’s store. 50 TEN The lean black-eyed credit jeweler was standing in his entrance in the same position as the afternoon before. He gave me the same knowing look as I turned in.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Lash	Her voice spoke through the lisp of the rain, saying slowly, without any tone: "I can’t see a thing, [MASK]. The windows are misted.” He grunted something and the girl’s body jerked hard, as though he had jammed a gun into her back.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Joe	“I knew damn well you were trouble,” she snapped at me. “I told [MASK] to watch his step.” ‘‘It’s not his step, it’s the back of his lap he ought to watch,” I said.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	94	“Yeah,” he said. “But that don’t make me knock him off. Sure, I heard the shots and saw [MASK] this killer come slamming down the back steps into the Buick and off. I took out after him.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Eddie	138 The girl flushed. Her cheekbones stood out white in her face. Then she laughed off-key. She said bitterly: “One more play, [MASK]. Everything I have on the red. I like red. It’s the color of blood.”
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Regan	I laughed. “No. I was just kidding. I think what you think, Captain. That [MASK] ran away with a woman who meant more to him than a rich wife he didn’t get along with. Besides, she isn’t rich yet.”
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Brody	79 “Don’t kid yourself I won’t use this heat, if I have to,” he said. “What’s your story?” “Have your friend with the pointed slippers come on in. She gets tired holding her breath." [MASK] called out without moving his eyes off my stomach.
<name>Yow</name>	Yow	Brody	“You’re a funny guy,” he said tonelessly. “Who has this lovely racket?” “Yow have,” I said. “Almost.” The blonde choked and clawed her ear. [MASK] didn’t say anything. He just looked at me.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Art	Get moving.” 186 I said: “They’re front and rear, on the right side. You could use the spare for one spot, if you're busy.” “Take two jacks, [MASK],’’ the brown man said.
<name>The floor</name>	The floor	Cars	It was still paved with brick and still sloped down to a grating in the middle. [MASK] glistened and a man in a brown smock got up off a stool and came forward. “Is my boy friend still blotto?”
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Marlowe	“No’m.” His hands were doing frantic things with the fistful of money he was holding. 145 ? “You’ll get to love it here,” she said. She took hold of my arm. “Let’s ride in your car, [MASK].”
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Marlowe	‘‘Oh, go to hell, [MASK].” She went on out and didn’t look back. I let the door shut and stood with my hand on it, staring at the hand. My face felt a little hot.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Canino	[MASK] killed a man tonight, a harmless little guy who was trying to help somebody out. I almost saw him killed.” She laughed wearily. “All right," I growled. “Don’t believe it.
<name>Willens</name>	Willens	Mars	But her voice didn’t change. “Then I’m afraid you’re in a bad spot. And I hate killing.” “And you Eddie [MASK]’ wife? Shame on you.” She didn’t like that. She glared at me. I grinned.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Brody	“Not from my client.” “Listen—” “Get the pictures, [MASK].” “Oh, hell, ” he said. “You win. ” He stood up and slipped the Colt into his side pocket. His left hand went up inside his coat.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Brody	[MASK] said tightly: “You’re not going , to any cops, brother. Not if it’s the Sternwoods you’re working for. I’ve got too much stuff on that family. You got your pictures and you got your hush. Go and peddle your papers.”
<name>Danny</name>	Danny	Brody	[MASK] swallowed and tried to grin. “Sure, kid, sure.” He said it in a small flat voice that was as much like the voice he had used to me as a scooter is like a ten-ton truck.
<name>Archer</name>	Archer	Brody	That left the east wall, in which there were no doors. There was a davenport backed against the middle of it, so I sat down on the davenport. [MASK] shut the door and walked crab-fashion to a tall oak desk studded with square nails.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Agnes	I got paid, sure, but I’d of had to do it anyway. She’s too screwy for a simple guy like me.” He cleared his throat. “How about a little dough? I’m down to nickels. [MASK] and me gotta move on.”
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Agnes	I licked my lips. They tasted dry and salty. “I think I would,” I said. “Where?” “[MASK] found her,” he said grimly. “Just by a lucky break. Saw her out riding and managed to tail her home.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Carmen	The boy must have got home when I was away taking [MASK] to her house. He was afraid of the police, of course, being what he is, and he probably thought it a good idea to have the body hidden until he had removed his effects from the house.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Carmen	[MASK] was up on her feet too, coming towards me with her hand out, still giggling and hissing. There was a little froth at the corners of her mouth. Her small white teeth glinted close to her lips. “Can I have them now?”
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Brody	1 fell back on the davenport. The blonde was strong with the madness of love or fear, or a mixture of both, or maybe she was just strong. [MASK] grabbed for the little revolver that was so close to his face. He missed.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Ohls	He took a silk handkerchief from the breast pocket of the dinner jacket he was wearing and touched his lips with it and tucked it away again. “There’s a couple more deaths involved,” [MASK] said, pinching the soft flesh at the end of his chin.
<name>Wemmick</name>	Wemmick	Geiger	“Uh-uh. [MASK] worked that one on everybody. It was strictly his own idea. He’d get notes from people that looked legal—were legal, I dare say, except that he wouldn’t have dared sue on them.
<name>Norris</name>	Norris	Norris	’’ It was like that, over and over again, lying on the bed and watching the patch of sunlight slide down the corner of the wall. Then the phone rang, and it was [MASK], the Sternwood butler, with his usual untouchable voice.
