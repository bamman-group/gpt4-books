<name>Septimus</name>	Septimus	Hannah	“Let’s have some tea,” she said. “I’ve hot water all ready,” she said over her shoulder as she hurried down the hall. Let her, [MASK] thought, following. By all means. “Goodness no, it’s boiled away!
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Joel	“In his condition the news might kill him. I told her I simply don’t see how they can avoid it. They’ll have to account for coming away to the funeral, after all.” “Just tell him he’s hurt,” [MASK] said.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Catherine	But if anyone teased either of them about not being an orphan at all, then he would certainly speak of that. He decided that [MASK] should be warned of this, so that if they were teased, they could back each other up.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Mary	It was instantaneous.” She was silent; he felt that she must be doubting it. Christ, he thought furiously, at least she could be spared that! “He can’t have suffered, [MASK], not even for a fraction of a second.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Rufus	“I guess not,” [MASK] replied shyly. He began to realize that for some moments now a bell, the school bell, had been weltering on the dark gray air; he realized it because at this moment the last of its reverberations were fading.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Rufus	After a while [MASK] said, “Did it hurt him bad?” “He could never have felt it. That’s the one great mercy” (or is it, she wondered); “the doctor is sure of that.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jay	“Naww; I dusted it off. ” She said, shyly, "I’ll be glad when I can stoop again. ’’ He put his hand on her shoulder. "So will I. ’’ “[MASK], ” she drew away, really offended.
<name>John</name>	John	Joel	Ym so glad." And her heart was restored from its desolation, into warmth and love and almost into wholeness. Again they were all thoughtfully silent, and into this silence [MASK] spoke quietly and slowly, “I don’t—/(now. I just—don’t— know.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Jay	The fecund air lavished upon their faces the tenderness of lovers’ adoring hands, the dissolving fragrance of the opened world, which slept against the sky. “What a heavenly night, [MASK],” she said in the voice which was dearest to him.
<name>Andrei</name>	Andrei	Rufus	“And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil,” and with this his hand left [MASK]’ head and he crossed himself, immediately restoring the hand, “for Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Andrew	Perhaps I do, too, [MASK] thought, and once again, as he had felt when he first saw the dead body, he felt absurd, ashamed, guilty almost of cheating, even of murder, in being alive.
<name>Chardin</name>	Chardin	Andrew	There they stayed quiet, the deceived mother, the false son, the fatally wounded daughter; it was thus that [MASK] found them and, with a glimpse of the noble painting it could be, said to himself, crying within himself, “It beats the Holy Family.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jay	Tell them, don’t promise them or anything of course, but tell them I’m practicly sure to be back before they’re asleep. Tell them I’ll do my best.” He got into his coat. “All right, [MASK].” “Yes.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jay	“[MASK], ” his wife called softly. “Isn’t he asleep yet?” “Yeah, he’s asleep,” he said, getting up and dusting his knees. “Reckon it’s later than I knew. ”
<name>Grandpa</name>	Grandpa	Rufus	“He was born in a log cabin,” [MASK] said. “That’s right, and he became the greatest man we’ve ever had.” He said nothing for a moment and they wondered what he was going to tell them about their father.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Catherine	Then after standing for a moment again, he turned away and walked even more quickly and quietly out by the way he had come in, and his face was so tucked down that [MASK] was sure she had not been seen. Now
<name>George</name>	George	Jay	But we just can’t afford to take that chance.” “Of course not, [MASK].” There was a loud stirring as she got from bed. “Whatyou up to?” “Why, your breakfast,” she said, switching on the light.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Rufus	“He says to kiss both of you for him and he’ll probably see you before you’re asleep tonight.” “When?” [MASK] asked. “Way, early this morning, before it was light.” “Why?”
<name>Azazal</name>	Azazal	Darkness	The curtain sighed as powers unspeakable passed through it. [MASK] purred with delight and said: What is this change your eye betrays? Only a moment ago, I was your friend, or so you claimed; why this sudden loss of love?
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Mary	[MASK] met his eyes. “He said that if there had to be such an accident, this was pretty certainly the best way. That with such a thing, a concussion, he might quite possibly have been left a hopeless imbecile.”
<name>Camilla</name>	Camilla	Catherine	Mother will see you soon.” And [MASK], feeling that for some reason to do with her father, who was not where he ought to be, and her mother too, she must try to be a very good girl, came away with him without further protest.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Catherine	He leaned towards her: “So do I.” “There must have been others injured, as well.” Again he leaned towards her. “Maybe. We don’t know.” “Even killed, perhaps.” “We don’t—know, [MASK].”
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Andrew	“[MASK],” she whispered loudly. With a contortion of the face which terrified her he slapped his hand through the air at her as if she had been a mosquito. “Just that one place, on the point of the chin,” he was saying.
<name>John</name>	John	Mary	He’ll very likely be back by supper time, or a little after. He was sure he could—if—everything was, well, relatively all right. All right. All right; good-bye. Good-bye. Good-bye, [MASK]’s voice trailed, gently.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Mary	she said in a pinched, almost crying voice, and they embraced. “There, there, there,” her mother said in a somewhat cracked voice, clapping her loudly on the back. “[MASK], dear. There, there, there!”
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Joel	But lest any of them should feel that this was in any sense a reproach, or should in the least feel sorry for her, she kept her little smile, thinking, how foolish, how very foolish, to smile. Smiling at grief, [MASK] thought.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Andrew	“There is something,” [MASK] whispered. Whatever it might be, it was never for an instant at rest in one place. It was in the next room; it was in the kitchen; it was in the dining room.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Mary	“Tell the children good-bye for me. Tell them I’ll see them tonight.” “I better not promise that, had I?” “No, but probably. And [MASK]: I hope I can make supper, but don’t wait it.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ralph	I won’t even imagine it. I just don’t see how I could bear to live if that were so. But there he was, all that day, with [MASK]. He must have. Well he probably did. That was no part of the promise.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mary	But she found that she herself could not bear to be present, and say nothing which might in some degree protect, and postpone. She was about to speak when [MASK] burst out: “In heaven’s name, why didn’t I ask him!
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Rufus	Whenever she did have a purchase to make, she got hold of a clerk and conducted the whole transaction with a graceful efficiency which had already inspired in [MASK] a certain contempt for every other woman he had seen shopping.
<name>Granma</name>	Granma	Sadie	“Times she can,” [MASK] said. “Times she can’t. Ain’t only so seldom call for talk, reckon she loses the hang of it. But 1 jigger she knows ye and I am tickled she does. ”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Mary	It was probably better for her not to face it if she could help until it had to be faced. If it had to be. Just quiet, she said to herself. Just be quiet. “You know,” [MASK] said slowly, “the queerest thing.”
<name>Enoch</name>	Enoch	Ralph	He slowed down a little. “Way I remember it, ” he said, “there’s some stretches you can’t hardly ever get a mule through, we’re coming to, ain’t they [MASK]?” “Oh mercy, ” his mother said.
<name>her</name>	her	Jay	“That’s a mean way,” he said. Suddenly he looked [MASK] in the eyes: his own were strangely shy. Then he looked again into the brown water, and continued to haul at the line. “Well, good luck,” he said.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Hannah	“That’s what’s so unbearablel" She drank half her tea at a gulp; it burned her painfully but she scarcely noticed. She continued to glare at her aunt. [MASK] could think of nothing to say.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mary	There were all kinds of—terrible misgivings; and not without good reason, as you both came to know.” “Plenty of good reasons,” [MASK] said. “But that didn’t make it any easier for us.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Joel	“He was at the blacksmith shop. They’d even brought in the auto. You know, they say it ran perfectly. Except for the top, and the windshield, it was hardly even damaged.” [MASK] asked, “Do they have any idea what happened?”
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	Hannah	She poured the tumbler full while they watched her, feeling they must not interfere, and took a deep gulp and choked on it, and swallowed most of it. “Dilute it,” [MASK] said, slapping her hard between the shoulders and drying her lips and her chin with a dish towel.
<name>Waldo</name>	Waldo	Rufus	When [MASK] arrived, all out of breath, he found her on a hard little couch in the living room, sitting carefully, not to rumple her long white-speckled black dress, and poring gravely through an issue of The Nation which she held a finger length before her thick glasses.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Mary	No, I don’t see quite how.” “You learned how yourself, [MASK].” “Did I!” “You learned there was a lot in what your father—in all our misgivings, but learning it never changed your essential opinion of him, did it?
<name>Maisie</name>	Maisie	Catherine	“Stay with me one minute,” she whispered, “just one minute, my dearest”; and in some force he did return; she felt him with her, watching his child. [MASK] was sleeping with all her might and her thumb was deep in her mouth; she was scowling fiercely.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Catherine	They all three talked. A small, sudden noise frightened [MASK]; then she realized it came from the living room. There was no more sound. She got from the chair in perfect silence and stole to the window in the angle of the porch.
<name>John</name>	John	Jay	“I wouldn’t think of it, except: well” (she was reluctant to remind him), “if worst comes to worst, [MASK], you might be gone longer than we hope.” “That’s perfectly true,” he said, gravely.
<name>Macbeth</name>	Macbeth	Macbeth	“Oh, good Lord! You’ve got it going and coming, haven’t you!” “Is this a dagger that I see before me? Wasn’t, you know. But you could never convince [MASK] it wasn’t.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Andrew	Always. And then a terrifying thought occurred to her, and she looked at [MASK]. No, she thought, he wouldn’t lie to me if it were so. No, I won’t even ask it. I won’t even imagine it.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Mary	“Let me pour my own,” [MASK] said. “Because,” she added with deliberation while she poured, “I want it just as strong as I can stand it.” She tasted the dark drink, added a little more whiskey, tasted again, and put the bottle aside.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jay	“Twarn’t rightly a dark crossing, mister. I can’t charge ye but the daytime toll.” “All right,” [MASK] said, giving him fifteen cents. “And much obliged to you.” He put out his headlights and stooped to crank the car.
<name>Stevie</name>	Stevie	Mary	[MASK] asked quietly. “Nothing,” he said, “just the way things go. As flies to wanton boys. That’s all.” “What do you mean?” “As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods; they kill us for their sport.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Mary	you see? It’s as if we were driving him away when he wants so much to be here among us, with us, and can’t.” “I’m awfully sorry, [MASK]. Just awfully sorry. Yes, of course I do see.
<name>George</name>	George	Ralph	“[MASK] says that’s easily arranged. He can come down first thing tomorrow.” “Well, then we just can’t. We just won’t, no matter what. Tell him how very very much I appreciate it and thank him, but I just can’t.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sally	Just not to have to worry about whether people respect you. Not ever to have to feel that people are being nice to you because they are sorry for you, or afraid of you. He looked at [MASK]. Poor girl. Afraid of me.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Andrew	“Thought [MASK] had phoned.” “Yes ...” She drank tea. “He scared me half out of my wits.” “He had no business phoning. He was a perfect fool to phone.” “I don’t blame him.
<name>Georgiana</name>	Georgiana	John	In a glimmer of gaiety, both were on the verge of parting with their customary morning farewell, she singing, “Good-bye [MASK], don’t stay long,” he singing back, “I’ll be back in a week or two,” but both thought better of it.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Rufus	“It’ll be what happened this afternoon.” [MASK] looked up at him carefully. “There were a lot of clouds,” his uncle said, and continued to look straight before him, “but they were blowing fast, so there was a lot of sunshine too.
<name>John</name>	John	Ralph	He felt he understood very well how it had happened. Actually, he understood only a little about it, and [MASK] understood very little more. Late in the evening before, their father had suffered a much more severe and painful attack than any up to then.
<name>Essie</name>	Essie	Jay	“Right hyer!” and she slapped her hand hard against her stomach and laid her hand back on ^e e^Se °f aut°- “Ifig!t like that too, ” she said to [MASK], "then who’s agonna look out fer her?”
<name>Corley</name>	Corley	Andrew	“And let them know when—-why; why we don’t even know, do we? When the—what day he’ll—be—the funeral, [MASK]!” “Not for sure. I told them I’d see them in the morning about all that.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ann	Oh, I look a way down yonder, [MASK], uh what dyou reckon I see, A band of shinin angels, A cornin’ after me. Git on board, little children, Git on board, little children, Git on board, little children, There’s room for many and more.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Andrew	There was a noise on the porch; [MASK] got from his knees and kissed his sister on the forehead. “Don’t be sorry,” she said. He looked at her, tightened his lips, and hurried to the door.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jay	The wagon grew larger and larger, and now the dark, deeply lined faces of the man and woman became distinct: the sad, deeply lined faces of the profound country which seemed ancient even in early maturity and which always gave [MASK] a sense of peace.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Hannah	“It wasn’t Aw fault it was good,” [MASK] said. “Of course it isn’t his fault and I had no business waiting it but I did, and I was so angry with him—why I even—I even ...”
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Jay	“Going to make them, going to make em anyhow, ” his father said. "But [MASK], there’s no use simply forcing it on his att-eigh-ten-ten, his attention, now, is there?
<name>Emmy</name>	Emmy	Catherine	he demanded, in angry disappointment, but she thrust through these words with her own: “Go wake— little [MASK] and bring her straight here,” she said in a voice which puzzled him; “there’s something I must tell you both together.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mary	So you can feel you’ve got some control over the death, you own it, you choose a name for it. The same with wanting to know all you can about how it happened. And trying to imagine it as [MASK] was.
<name>Yessir</name>	Yessir	Eah	“Run all winter?” “[MASK],” said the man, warping his line. “Tain’t so bad,” he added after a moment, “only for sleet. I do mislike them sleety nights.” Both were silent, fay filled his pipe.
<name>Stevenson</name>	Stevenson	Joel	And with mild surprise she found that this was true. “Well, it’s simply that I thought of all the old tales and beliefs about the souls of people who die sudden deaths, or violent deaths. Or as [MASK] would prefer it, not souls.
<name>Doc</name>	Doc	Ralph	Just think it over. And remember nobody’s goin to think bad of you if you change your mind, or for calling either. Just how sick is he really, [MASK]?” “Course if you don’t want to take my word for ...”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jay	“You’ll«’/ here.” She sat down. “How about you?” “I couldn’t sleep.” “I know what.” He got up and went to the icebox. “What are you—oh. No, [MASK]. Well.
<name>Phronsie</name>	Phronsie	Rufus	At length they found the right formula. They would put some boys as small as he was, up to some tpcf which nobody bigger would have any right to do. After dinner the babies and all the children except [MASK] were laid out on the beds to ta\e
<name>Inspector</name>	Inspector	Mary	“No, [MASK],” he said. “I have the doctor’s word for that. He says the only thing that could have caused death was concussion of the brain. He says that when that—happens to kill, it—does so instantly, or else takes days or weeks.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Mary	I know we must. It’s just, this waiting in the dark like this, it’s just more than I can stand.” “We ought to hear very soon.” [MASK] glanced at the clock. “Almost any minute,” she said.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Hannah	A cut so small—they can close it with one stitch. And a little blue bruise on his lower lip. It wasn’t even swollen.” “That’s all,” she said. “All,” [MASK] said.
<name>Francie</name>	Francie	Rufus	Of the first three who came up, two merely looked at him and the third said, “Huh! Betcha he ain’t”; and [MASK], astounded that they did not know and that they should disbelieve him, said, “Why he is so!”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Mary	Everything there is to tell. And if I do break down, why don’t reproach yourself. Remember I asked you. But I’ll try to not. I think I’ll be all right.” “All right, [MASK].”
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Ralph	“Look here, [MASK],” he said, in a different voice. “I’m talking too much. I...” “Yeah, reckon our time must be about up, but what’s a few ...” “Listen here. I’m starting right on up.
<name>She</name>	She	Rufus	But almost the moment he understood he started to laugh, so he must have been teasing, after all. [MASK] was deeply hurt. Then almost immediately he stopped laughing as if he were shocked at himself. “Well now,” he said.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Rufus	“Thy will be done,” his mother said. “On earth,” she continued, with some strange shading of the word which touched him with awe and sadness; “as it is in heaven.” “Give us this d .. [MASK] was more careful this time.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Rufus	With his nasty little cane; hooking up skirts and things, and that nasty little walk!” His father laughed, as he always did, and [MASK] felt that it had become rather an empty joke; but as always the laughter also cheered him; he felt that the laughter enclosed him with his father.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Hannah	“I’ve made up the downstairs bedroom” (she waved vaguely towards it), “where he stayed when his poor back was sprained, you remember.” (Of course I do, [MASK] thought; let her talk.) “It’s better than upstairs.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Rufus	And looking backjust as earnestly the boy said, "Cross my heart and body, ” and did so. Then there was a snicker again from somebody, and [MASK] realized that some of them were undoubtedly teasing; but he felt that he did not much mind, if these central boys were not.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mary	Chapter 8 A few minutes before ten, the phone rang. [MASK] hurried to quiet it. “Hello?” The voice was a man’s, wiry and faint, a country voice. It was asking a question, but she could not hear it clearly.
<name>She</name>	She	Mary	“[MASK] was saying, perhaps he was only unconscious. That maybe if the doctor had been there right on the spot, he could have been saved. I was telling her, no. Because I asked the doctor everything I could think to, about that.
<name>Regina</name>	Regina	Mary	“Good night, [MASK].” "Bless you,” her mother exploded, almost as if she were cursing; deaf, near-sighted, she caught her daughter in her arms with all her strength and patted her back with both hands, thinking: how young and good she smells!
<name>he</name>	he	Rufus	There was no flurry and no dawdling as there would have been with any other woman [MASK] knew; none of the ceremony that held his grandmother’s shopping habits in a kind of stiff embroidery; none of the hurrying, sheepish refusal to be judicious in which men shopped.
<name>Sarty</name>	Sarty	Rufus	he asked; he was frowning slightly. “My daddy’s dead,” [MASK] said, expectantly. “You mean that sure enough?” the man asked. “He died last night when I was asleep and now he can’t come home ever any more.”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Jay	They kissed, and her head settled for a moment against him. He stroked her hair. “I’ll let you know,” he said, “quick as I can, if it’s serious.” “I pray it won’t be, [MASK].”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Andrew	Just in bravery and nobility and anger and perfect confidence he could. It’s how he’d look Death itself in the face. It’s how he did! In his strength. Those are the words that are going to be on his gravestone, [MASK].”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Ralph	“Of course not.” Her hand moved to pat him; his hand moved on hers. “Has the doctor seen him?” she asked cautiously. “He says he has a chance, [MASK] says.” “That could mean so many things.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Catherine	He did not look at them; he had not looked at them during all of this time. They watched the shadows work, and the leaves waving. He got out of the car, and opened the door on their side, and held out his hands to [MASK].
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Hm	He said the words over, drily within himself, and heard the melody; a child’s voice, his own, sang it in his mind. [MASK]. He tried to remember when he had last walked in the open night at such an hour.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Victoria	Spic and span. [MASK] would not allow his mother to get dinner and after they had eaten she also took entire charge of packing some of his clothes into a box, asking advice, however, on each thing that she took out °f drawer.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Rufus	Then we are! [MASK] thought, and knew that he was very bad. “Guard them in all temptations which life may bring. That when they come to understand this thing which in Thy inscrutable wisdom Thou hast brought to pass, they may know and reverence Thy will.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Andrew	“That’s all,” [MASK] said. “The doctor said it was concussion of the brain. It was instantaneous.” She was silent; he felt that she must be doubting it. Christ, he thought furiously, at least she could be spared that!
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Victoria	“Is that why you’re colored, [MASK]?" He felt a change in her hand when he said the word "colored.” Again she did not answer immediately, nor would she look at him. “Yes, ” she said at length, “that’s why I’m colored. ”
<name>Al</name>	Al	Poll	She kept looking at him. “See here, [MASK],” he said. “It’s bad enough right now, but it’s going to take a while to sink in. When it really sinks in it’s going to be any amount worse.
<name>evening</name>	evening	Ralph	His moment of reflection and light-heartedness was overtaken by shadow, and he felt a little foolish, for he couldn’t be sure there was anything to worry about yet, much less feel solemn about. That [MASK], he thought, hoisting the trousers and buttoning the top button.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Victoria	“Don’t tell [MASK] she smells. ” “Or say anything about it where she can hear. ’’ “Or say anything about it where she can hear. ” “Why not?” “Because she might cry. ’’ “That’s right.
<name>James</name>	James	Rot	[MASK]! he said to himself. “Our place,” he said rather more loudly, “is to stay where she prefers us to be.” He began to realize that she had not meant our place in mere propriety.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Rufus	Long after we are all dead.” [MASK] wondered what was the good of that, then, but he was sure he should not ask. “So I don’t want you to wonder about it, children.
