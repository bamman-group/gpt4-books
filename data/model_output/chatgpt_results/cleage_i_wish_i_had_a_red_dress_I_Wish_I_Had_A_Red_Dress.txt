<name>Smitherman</name>	Smitherman	Junior	He’s agreed to take the shift between classes and football practice.” “What shift?” “That’s the idea,” he said. “We’re going to watch the Smitherman house in shifts around the clock until they find [MASK], or we do.”
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Tee	Of course he was right, but I was too. We sat there for a minute pushing our food around and trying to find some common ground. “It’s not my decision,” I said finally. “[MASK]’s in charge and then the group votes.”
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Bill	“The partnership must be working.” [MASK] laughed. “Now that’s a match made in heaven. The only person who’ll have a chance of out talking either one is the other!” “She’s going to buy a gun,” I said.
<name>danger</name>	danger	Junior	That’s what you were trying to tell me the other night and it’s true. If I can’t figure out how to protect you from [MASK], what kind of man does that make me?” “I don’t know,” I said.
<name>Miss Gates</name>	Miss Gates	Lynette	But she was cool about it. She told me not to pretend anything because it was too much work and didn’t get you anyplace but further behind.” [MASK] had a firm belief that anybody could learn anything once they quit pretending that they already knew it.
<name>Blair</name>	Blair	Sister	“Okay,” [MASK] said. “What was weird? The kiss itself or the fact of it?” “The fact of it?” “Did you want to kiss him?” “Yes.” Oh, yes! “Did you initiate the contact?”
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Tee	It was entertaining, it had real use and educational value and it generated income. I looked at [MASK]’s careful calculations and then at her, perched expectantly on the corner of the desk. “You’ve done it again,” I said.
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Sister	He even rumbled on the phone. “How’s the anti—Super Bowl party going?” He had been really curious when I was talking about it at [MASK]’s. I think he was a little surprised when I said no men were allowed.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Sister	This free-floating rage was getting to be a constant companion and I didn’t like the feeling at all. I tried to match [MASK]’s equanimity. “They said there’s not much they can do until he actually puts his hands on her.”
<name>Curley's wife</name>	Curley's wife	Nate	[MASK] looked a little surprised by the question. “I’m not sure I know what you mean.” “I mean”—Tee sounded firm but not unpleasant—“that when the guys usta come over here for activities and stuff, they’d always mess it up.
<name>the nephew</name>	the nephew	Sheila	I wondered suddenly if it was a real gun or simply another one of his nephew’s toys. I couldn’t tell and I couldn’t take a chance. He was too angry and [MASK] was too scared. “My mama scoped it out first,” he snarled.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Mitch	I am no blushing virgin or desperate widow. I’ve been doing fine by myself, and there was no reason for my hormones to go adolescent on me now. I remember this feeling well. [MASK] and I started having sex the night he asked me to marry him
<name>Eric</name>	Eric	Sister	[MASK] chuckled. “So are you calling me for advice or absolution?” “Don’t make fun of me,” I said. “It was very weird.” “Did you like it?” Why did the question make me feel so guilty?
<name>Miss Caroline</name>	Miss Caroline	Patrice	“Well, we were wrong,” [MASK] said quickly. “Let’s vote again.” Before she could even state the question, everybody in the room raised a hand, even the boys, manfully silent but totally engaged.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Tomika	I refilled our cups and [MASK] chuckled softly. “What?” She pointed at the bag of videos she’d picked up on our way out. “They been fussin’ at me about these videos all day and we never even got to ’em.”
<name>her</name>	her	Tomika	I’m just not very good at keeping secrets.” Especially from [MASK]. The effort required was not only superhuman but doomed to failure. She always finds Out. “Okay, well, how about don’t tell her unless she ask you specifically?"
<name>Marisol</name>	Marisol	Tee	“See what I’m sayin’?” [MASK] frowned, using her good hand to point to the cast that made her right hand useless for combing hair. “You see I’m helpless here, right?”
<name>Stanley</name>	Stanley	Jimmy	“I don’t know about that, but I know I went home and told [MASK] he was going to have to make other living arrangements.” “Is that when he moved out?” “That’s when I put him out.”
<name>Chen</name>	Chen	Bill	[MASK] closed his eyes, placed his hand over his heart dramatically and did the simultaneous translation. “A broken shadow/without you, Only the twilight accom- panies me now. Now your love is gone/there is no happiness for me.”
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Bill	“You’re a big help!” “You can ask him yourself as soon as he gets here,” [MASK] said. “But for now—cheers!” We clinked our glasses lightly and I took a long, cold swallow and sighed.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Nikki	" She leaned over and hugged [MASK], who hugged her back, hard, then stepped away quickly and left the room without a word. Neither one of us spoke for a minute and then I picked up the poetry book that had been left behind.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Bill	“Me too. That’s why we’ve got to figure out something else fast!" “Can’t be fast enough for me,” I said, opening the door for her and stepping out. “Think [MASK] will stay mad at me?”
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Nikki	“Around nine-thirty?” The last thing [MASK] had said to me was forget it, so I was not optimistic about us showing up anywhere by nine-thirty. “We’ll be there soon as we can get there,” I said.
<name>my</name>	my	Nate	“The more the merrier.” “Good,” she said, beaming. “You’re incorrigible! Good night!” I laughed, slipping out fast to let in a minimum of cold air and to cut off any further conversation about [MASK]’s romantic potential.
<name>Aunt Dahlia</name>	Aunt Dahlia	Sister	“I thought you might,” [MASK] said. She was holding my coat with a look of pure innocence, which didn’t fool me for a second. “Stop matchmaking. I’m old enough to be his mother.” “You are not!”
<name>Mrs. Dubose</name>	Mrs. Dubose	Anita	In the rearview mirror, I could see them pull out behind me and turn toward town. At the very least, I figured that would give [MASK] food for thought before she got too self-righteous about her sorry son.
<name>John</name>	John	Nate	If all women’s studies classes ever do is get a man or two to hesitate, however briefly, like [MASK] was doing, before deciding they automatically know more/better/best, just on the basis of maleness, those programs will be worth all the struggles it took to get them.
<name>Destiny</name>	Destiny	NIKKI	FORTY a p In’ customer I SAW [MASK] IN town today. She hasn’t been around as much lately because her hours are still crazy at the club. The place seems to open early and close very late. She says they even have a lunch special.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Sister	“No,” I said, laughing at what a mess I was making of a simple introduction. “I just didn’t want you to be startled when you meet him. [MASK] didn’t warn me, and when I turned around and saw him, I’m sure I was visibly surprised.”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Tee	By now, of course, I understood that. What I didn’t understand was how I was supposed to tell [MASK] it was safe to come home when that was a lie. Nobody was safe around here. Not yet.
<name>he</name>	he	Johnny	What’s important is that [MASK] now had a new piece of information he could use. “How about I call you in the morning,” I said. “And we’ll try to come down then?” “Around nine-thirty?”
<name>the killer</name>	the killer	Junior	“Sure,” he said, looking genuinely disappointed. Things had been so crazy around here lately with [MASK] on the loose and the festival opening Friday that we’d barely seen each other, and when we did we were working. I missed him.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Tee	“Fine,” I said, sounding as stressed out as I felt. “What’s wrong?” His voice deepened with sudden concern. “[MASK] okay?” “Coming home tomorrow,” I said. “Remember?” He let that pass.
<name>Santa</name>	Santa	Sister	The floor had been swept, the bathrooms had been scrubbed and the only snow on the front steps had fallen after midnight. There was absolutely nothing else left to do, so I sat down to open [MASK]’s bag of goodies.
<name>Ms. Appleby</name>	Ms. Appleby	Sister	“When I asked them to share what they’d written, the first two were so pornographic I told them we were out of time and sent them home.” [MASK] patted his hand sympathetically. “I’m sorry, sweetie.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Sheila	[MASK] and I were a captive audience and the words came tumbling out of his mouth like a river of poison. He squinted at me and wagged the gun in my general direction. I wondered suddenly if it was a real gun or simply another one of his nephew’s toys.
<name>hers</name>	hers	Tee	What he didn’t seem to understand was, she wanted him to look over her shoulder. We both did, but he was shooting a much bigger gun at a target much farther away than [MASK]’s and we were on our own.
<name>Sal</name>	Sal	Tomika	“Sort of, but it’s open in the daytime, so I won’t always have to be workin’ late.” She offered this last with a hopeful look and I smiled encour-agingly. “That’s good, right?” “Go on!” said [MASK].
<name>Malcolm</name>	Malcolm	Tee	You so busy savin’ your shit for some imaginary Denzel Washington clone, you done forgot how good the real shit can be.” The teakettle was whistling weakly and I got up to turn it off. “I ain’t forgot nothin’,” [MASK] said quietly.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Baby	Always the pragmatist, [MASK] looked at us and decided that if I was telling the truth, we weren’t worth the trouble. “Fuck this,” he said, climbing back into his car and peeling out of the yard in a hail of rock salt and day-old snow.
<name>he</name>	he	Sister	I sat down on the couch wondering how many times he’s been asked about the weather up there, and how long I could resist the temptation to inquire. “Sit down, sit down,” [MASK] said. “You have any trouble finding us?”
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Nikki	“Go on what? [MASK] snapped at her. I m not talkin fast enough for you?” “You’re not talkin’ straight enough for me, how’s that?” “Maybe I should go out and come in again,” I said.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Tee	“I wish I could say you’re wrong about my brothers, but you’re right. Listening is definitely not our strong point.” [MASK] grinned back at him, relieved that he understood; emboldened by her own ability to present her case and hold her own.
<name>Punk</name>	Punk	Junior	“Back off, [MASK],” she said. “Right now!” “Or what?” He sneered. “You gonna shoot me?” “I’m gonna do the best I can.” “What if you miss?”
<name>Darry</name>	Darry	Junior	“Why?” But I knew why. The only thing that would make her walk all the way over here in this kind of weather was [MASK]. “I had to pick up the b-b-boys,” she said, her eyes searching for them.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Philistine	“You should know that.” The air was so cold and clear I wanted to drink it like water. “Then what good are they?” That made him laugh. “[MASK]!” he said, finishing up and stashing the scraper back in the trunk.
<name>anyone</name>	anyone	Tee	“It’s a deal,” she said, with her first genuine smile of the day. I could tell she was relieved to be able to confess her ambivalence. I hadn’t promised, but I don’t think I’ll mention it to [MASK] right away.
<name>mother</name>	mother	Nettie	She shook her head sadly at me like of all people I should know that there are situations where offers of help are completely beside the point. “No one can help,” she said. “My [MASK]’s heart is broken and there is nothing anyone can do.”
<name>him</name>	him	Nate	She looked at [MASK] and hesitated. He spoke up instantly, his voice a reservoir of reassurance and calm. “If you need to speak privately, I can wait—” She didn’t let him finish the sentence before she laid a delicate hand on that same tree-trunk arm
<name>she</name>	she	Junior	and we’d welcome her and drive her crazy fussing over her, until she made us stop and we all got back to the things we were doing before [MASK] started acting a fool. Especially in one critical area ... I went upstairs and ran myself a hot bath.
<name>Darlene</name>	Darlene	Tee	“Because everybody ain’t like you, [MASK]. Everybody can’t just close that shit off and keep on like nothin’ happened. Some of us need a man’s hands, you know what I’m sayin’?
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Tiffany	[MASK] said, finally, still sniffing. “You voted not to,” I reminded her. I had shown them a few minutes of it and they groaned and giggled and complained mightily about the strange music and the stilted language.
<name>over</name>	over	Tee	“These are mostly why and why-not questions. That usually helps get things going.” “Absolutely,” I said, happy to have something tangible to hand [MASK] in the morning along with the name of her first senior volunteer.
<name>Sylvia</name>	Sylvia	Dandridge	The tragedy of [MASK]’s life is so perfectly portrayed in the callousness of the police photographer taking photos of her naked body that we just sat there together for a minute absorbing it, our postfilm discussion questions forgotten in our shared despair at the waste of so much beauty and talent and heart.
<name>Ellison</name>	Ellison	Bill	“I am calm. I’m just saying I thought that was what black writers were supposed to do. Tell the truth to the people." “You don’t have to lecture me,” [MASK] snapped. “I’m not the enemy.”
<name>Tupac</name>	Tupac	Bill	No hitting women & kids 6. No raping 7. Use a rubber 8. If you make a baby, be a father 9. Respect the old-timers 10. Bring the love ([MASK]’s note: “I added that one.”)
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Sister	“That may be the maybe,” he said, “but I’m not too far gone to see the value of a strategic surrender.” “Especially when there’s peach cobbler at stake,” said [MASK], herding us both back into the house.
<name>her daughter</name>	her daughter	Mavis	I went to the kitchen and poured myself a cup of peppermint tea, complimented [MASK] on her ability to stay within the lines of her new Barney activity book and made a mental note to schedule an appointment with the new kindergarten teacher at the public school.
<name>Spenser</name>	Spenser	Bill	“We’re not cops,” [MASK] said, not backing down any more than I was. “What do you want us to be? Vigilantes?” He hardly got it out of his mouth before I answered him. “I want you to be men!”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Junior	“Her brother [MASK] came by here yesterday, grabbed his ex-girlfriend by the arm and tried to drag her off.” “Why?” “She had just quit him because he objected to her new job.” “He doesn’t want her to work?”
<name>his father</name>	his father	Junior	He always gonna be my big brother and blood is blood, right?” Right. “Did [MASK] hit you?” She shook her head. “Then who?” “My mama.” “Why?” Was the whole family insane?
<name>Shaniqua</name>	Shaniqua	Deena	“They know better,” [MASK] whined. “She gonna play what she want anyway.” I took a deep breath. This is the way they all tend to think: 1. Identify the problem (always someone else’s fault); 2.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Bill	“That was [MASK]’s contribution about her being happy.” “That’s because he’s a poet,” I said. “No,” she said, still grinning. “That’s because he’s happy.”
<name>Tea Cake</name>	Tea Cake	Babydaddies	Boyfriends? [MASK]? “Lovers?” “Right!” “A lot of them are truly sorry, but since they all we see, we ’bout to forget what a good man even look like, much less how one ’spose to act.”
<name>Fools</name>	Fools	Fools	I admired her work in Why Do [MASK] Fall in Love?, especially her character’s vulnerability even as the woman’s life added harder and harder layers. I liked her even more in Set It Off, especially when she gets angry at the timid girl in the gang after their first successful bank robbery.
<name>Bunk</name>	Bunk	Tiffany	“They think once they hit it, it belong to ’em.” “That’s why they always be askin’ you What's my name? Say my name!" [MASK] said. “It gets on my nerves. Sometimes I got another thought goin’ good
<name>Easy</name>	Easy	Bill	“I was a Detroit beat cop for six years before that, until it occurred to me that my time might be better spent trying to interpret these young brothers before I had to put the cuffs on them.” “Well, don’t give up on those cuffs just yet,” [MASK] said.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Sister	It’s all one cloth, which is the whole trick—to sync up who you are with what you do. “Okay,” said [MASK], smoothing out her list, her eyes scanning it quickly. “These are mostly why and why-not questions.
<name>Halloween</name>	Halloween	Halloween	“When I was a cop we always dreaded [MASK] because that’s when the young brothers collectively lose their minds. They rob the trick-or-treaters. They do home invasions when people open their front doors to give out candy.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Junior	“You haven’t seen [MASK] yet, have you?” I busied myself with the tea, trying not to rush her if she had come to tell me something, or spook her if she hadn’t. She shook her head and her eyes filled with guilty tears.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Junior	When I stepped out on the back porch, [MASK] looked at me like I was the last person he expected to see. I’ve known him since he was a kid, and I was counting on that connection, however tenuous, to help me convince him to go home and cool off.
<name>Barbara</name>	Barbara	Sheila	“I will,” she said, stuffing her feet into a pair of barter closet boots that were a couple of sizes too big, but fleece-lined and dry. With the big red socks they almost fit and [MASK] smiled for the first time tonight.
<name>Yanira</name>	Yanira	Sister	“I’ve got a dozen.” She held open the bag excitedly and there they all were, each one more photogenic than the last. I wondered if [MASK]’s candles were really scented today or if the mangoes were perfuming this cold air in self-defense.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Nate	“[MASK]!” He stopped and turned in the direction of my voice. “Down here on the dock,” I called. “Do you want me to come up?” “No,” he said. “I’ll come down.”
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Tee	For me, he had a warm squeeze. “How’s [MASK]?” “She’s amazing,” I said. “Her leg is mending perfectly and she’s already trying to talk them into taking the cast off her wrist.”
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Tee	“You think they’d let me see the pictures?” [MASK] said. “Maybe we could make a display or something.” “Let’s go ask them.” She looked at me and something dawned on her.
<name>She</name>	She	Tee	“It’s only been a day,” I said. “How about we wait until the swelling goes down a little and then you can decide?” [MASK] had come through the surgery just fine, but she was pretty banged up from the accident.
<name>Shug</name>	Shug	Patrice	1 was the one talkin’, so then I told him he wasn’t my man no more, and if he brought his sorry ass up in my place of employment, I’d have them great big bouncers throw him out the back door with the rest of the trash!” [MASK] gasped.
<name>Darry</name>	Darry	Junior	Her legs crumpled and she almost fell. I started to move toward her to help, although I don’t know what I thought I was going to do once I got to her. [MASK]’s voice brought me up sharp. “Where you goin?”
<name>her</name>	her	Tee	“What did you tell her?” “I told her she needed a project to give her something else to focus on instead of her regrets and suggested that she talk to you about helping [MASK] with the film festival.”
<name>Beyoncé</name>	Beyoncé	Bill	Their mission seemed to be to make you throw caution to the winds and shake it. Knowing [MASK] would take it as a compliment and not a sign of insanity, I cranked the music up another few notches and started dancing around all by myself.
<name>he</name>	he	Sister	“Sit,” [MASK] said, poking the logs in the fireplace as he disappeared into the kitchen and 1 sank into a cozy corner of her pillow-strewn sofa. Her earrings glowed in the firelight against the copper-colored smoothness of her cheek.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Nate	Fluttering is not my style. I grabbed my coat and my purse and opened the door. [MASK] was standing so close to it that my forward motion literally bounced me off his chest. His arm shot out to steady me and I grabbed it. “Careful!”
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Mitch	The intensity of the orgasm shook me awake and I called his name out loud. “[MASK]!” Once my heart slowed down, I looked at the clock—five-thirty. The sun wasn’t even up yet. Plenty of time for a fast forty winks.
<name>He</name>	He	Bill	“I’ll handle it and keep you posted.” “Don’t bother,” he said. That didn’t leave me much room to be conciliatory, so I stopped trying. “All right,” I said. “I won’t.” [MASK] looked hurt.
<name>contentment</name>	contentment	Bill	“A broken shadow/without you, Only the twilight accom- panies me now. Now your love is gone/there is no happiness for me.” The music ended on a note of perfect longing and [MASK] sighed with satisfaction and glided across the room to give me a welcome squeeze.
<name>the lawyer</name>	the lawyer	Johnny	On the other end of the phone, [MASK] reminded me gently that time is of the essence in harassment cases. “If the perpetrator has an opportunity to feel his own power, the victim may be putting herself at increased risk by waiting.”
<name>her partner</name>	her partner	Junior	She supplemented her income by turning tricks when the manager wasn’t looking and becoming a willing part- ner in the many illegal get-rich-quick schemes that [MASK] dreamed up during his hours spent smoking dope, drinking beer and watching television on his mother’s tattered living-room sofa.
<name>her</name>	her	Tee	“Welcome,” I said, wondering if I’d done the right thing by not warning [MASK] any more specifically than a fairly generic “he’s tall.” I could have added bald and smart and fit and fine, but I thought the basics should suffice.
<name>John</name>	John	Mitch	My husband, [MASK], died five years ago, which is when I really started noticing it, but he was just the last of a long line. My father passed when I was sixteen. My mother committed suicide on my wedding night a year later.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Tee	[MASK] nodded, setting her braids into motion. “The main thing we can never get ’em to do is listen. They always busy arguin’ their side of it, when most of the time, they ain’t even got no side.
<name>Mira Nair</name>	Mira Nair	Tomika	[MASK] looked suspicious. “How come I never heard of it?” I shrugged. I knew exactly why. “It was directed by a woman too. “A sister?” “An Indian.” That was why.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Tomika	“I woke up!" “Come here, baby,” [MASK] said to her daughter, who stag- gered over sleepily, fell into the safe haven of her mother’s arms and went immediately back to sleep.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Nik	he bellowed. “Get your ass out here!” My heart sank. So much for the thirty-minute window. “Tell [MASK] to stay out of sight,” I said, pulling on my coat. “I’ll handle it.”
<name>Stephanie</name>	Stephanie	Tee	[MASK] frowned. “What you mean nasty stuff?" This kind of call-and-response was getting us noplace fast. “Be specific,” I said. She looked at me and sighed, clearly hating having to have this conversation at all.
<name>Ben</name>	Ben	Tiffany	Nobody said anything for a minute and then [MASK] grinned at me. “I knew this was a trick question.” “They’re all trick questions until you answer them,” I said, glad we had come to a conclusion that was easy to remember and easy to pass on.
<name>Julie</name>	Julie	Sheila	He rocked the car to a stop, jumped out, strode around to the passenger side, jerked it open and dragged [MASK] out by her arm. She was wearing gray sweats, no coat, and her eyes were swollen from crying or something worse.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Nate	They gotta hear us for a change!” [MASK] looked at her for a minute, debating his options, then he sat back and grinned, shaking his head. “I wish I could say you’re wrong about my brothers, but you’re right.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Regina	“There’s Indians in it too.” “That must be where the masala comes in,” said [MASK], rolling her eyes. “Whatever that is!” “It’s an Indian stew,” I said. “Like gumbo.”
<name>Barney</name>	Barney	Barney	I closed my eyes and invited all the spirits I could stand, but what about the song? The only one that came immediately to mind was the [MASK] classic, “I love you, you love me.” I was hoping for something a little more soulful, but first thought, best thought.
