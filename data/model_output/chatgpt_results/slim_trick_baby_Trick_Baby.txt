<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Midge	It was three a.m. I heard the toilet flush. I finished my adventure story and went to the bathroom to take a leak. I heard a hissing sound in [MASK]’s room. I wondered if she was letting a snake take a turn.
<name>Griffin</name>	Griffin	Flunkies	“[MASK] strip the fake stores of the convincing props until time to play for another mark. Now the—” I was so excited I cut him off, “I look white. Let’s get a bunch of real white guys together and open a store.
<name>The Professor</name>	The Professor	Folks	There are charming, likeable suckers that you’ll meet socially. But [MASK], a grifter true to the con code never likes a sucker enough or lets the sucker come close enough to get the secrets of con. “Let their stupid brains stay asleep in their chump world.
<name>Patrick</name>	Patrick	Midge	In a moment I heard him wake up [MASK]. He roared, “What is this damn thing doing in your room? If you lie to me I’ll cut the blood out of you. I’ve got a bellyful of your freakish shit.”
<name>Sammy</name>	Sammy	Lester	We met on an el. We had been going steady for about six months. She was a beautiful yellow-skinned girl. We went on double dates with [MASK] and his girlfriend. We went to amusement parks and movies.
<name>Jim's</name>	Jim's	Blue	But the buyer must believe the final decision to buy is his alone. The Reverend had to believe at the end of the tale that the decision to hide us out was his. The Reverend’s conscience had to be allowed to take over and buy [MASK]’s tale.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Blue	[MASK], stop it! You make me want to vomit! You’re talking like a lop-eared mark. Were going to come through this thing alive. I suffered through your lousy confession. But damn if I can stand any more of the same bullshit.
<name>Dolly</name>	Dolly	Pearl	The tiny mouth opened and finked on a decayed jumble of uneven teeth. She said, “I’m [MASK]. Who the hell are you?” She had the sweetest softest voice I’d ever heard. It was hard to believe it came out of her.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Jackie	My fever was gone when I got home. I took a bath and went to bed. I turned on the radio. An announcer said it was eleven a.m. I felt sorry for [MASK]’s husband. He was going to be a bore in bed.
<name>Darry</name>	Darry	Blue	Then for the ten-thousandth time I told myself it had had to happen to her. It wasn’t really my fault. It would have happened at some other time and place. I heard [MASK] coming slowly up the stairs. His face was tense when he came through the doorway.
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Joe	No one would possibly imagine that [MASK]’s house could be the hideout for two fast grifters. It was a nineteenth-century cadaver, hacked hideous by weather and time. The ancient white paint on the brown-stone had rotted away in scabby slabs.
<name>her</name>	her	Fixer	Or you could let [MASK] find her for you. Wait until three like you said. No point in getting upset about the unknown. Only suckers do that.” He said, “I’m not the worrying kind.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Pocket	[MASK] gave each of us three dollars in quarters to play the numbers on a long oilcloth strip stretched the length of the pine-board counter. Those numbers matched the numbers on the wheel in the center of the counter.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Midge	I wondered if she was letting a snake take a turn. I flushed the toilet, turned out the light and walked over and banged the door shut on my side of the bathroom. I kneeled down at [MASK]’s keyhole and peeped inside. Her night light was on.
<name>She</name>	She	Midge	1 flushed the toilet and went to the beige leather chair at the window. I sat there thinking about what I’d heard. None of it was too clear to me. [MASK] had to be out of her mind not to realize how lucky she was to live in a house like this.
<name>someone</name>	someone	pappy	You got looks, youth and a gift of gab. For you, broads are like streetcars. You miss one, it’s a cinch another will come along. You want to tell [MASK] what the hell happened?”
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Midge	I think I’ll take a bath and go to bed.” He said, “You’ll find towels in the cabinet. I’ll bring you a pair of pajamas. Christ! I wish [MASK] would come in.” He went down the hall.
<name>Hitler</name>	Hitler	Blue	THE GODDESS I was twenty-two years old in the spring of Nineteen Forty-five. It was the year that [MASK]’s princess bubble burst. It shook him up. But: I was glad he lost her. It was better for both of us.
<name>hers</name>	hers	Phala	She was in Cook County Hospital’s Psychiatric Division. She couldn’t receive visitors. She was too disturbed. The guy said that in cases like [MASK]’s, it could be weeks, even months, before they could release them. I stood there at the phone.
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Dot	Many times in the past I had noticed how the con charged him up. [MASK]’s lips pouted to a smooching stance. Tiny springs of sweat welled inside the sudden tattoo of wrinkles on his chin. He opened his mouth to speak. He didn’t make it.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Pocket	We guzzled beer and rehearsed our lines until a quarter of three. I was propped up in bed and [MASK] was in a chair beside me. We stared silendy at the door. At five after three my heart leaped at the three raps on the door.
<name>Mississippi</name>	Mississippi	EG	I went down to the streetcar stop and waited for her. She had scarcely stepped off the streetcar when I tugged at her sleeve. I said, “What is a trick baby, [MASK].?” She was startled like I had cursed at her.
<name>Babette</name>	Babette	Albert	There was a bright full moon lighting the beach. I didn’t see her anywhere. Then I heard a faint jabbering. It seemed to be coming from a cluster of beach cabanas a couple hundred yards away. As I walked closer, I knew it was [MASK].
<name>Willie</name>	Willie	Blue	We see something nice, I’ll buy us a piece of black ass. How about it?” It was pitch verbatim what [MASK] had taught me. It worked like black magic. The mark’s eyes lit up like a lucky guy about to shove it into a virgin.
<name>Billie</name>	Billie	Phala	I’d left, alone, from the front of the cabaret. [MASK] and the young cabby would come out arm and arm on their way to some after-hours-spot. She liked him even though he was only twenty-two or so.
<name>Jimmy</name>	Jimmy	Red	[MASK] would shake our hands and say, ‘Friends, I told you we could count on my boss. That wallet belonged to an old business rival of his. He’ll give us smaller bills for the big ones.
<name>my wife</name>	my wife	Cleo	But a fin will get a C-note that for them the reward outweighs the tensions. “Don’t be a sucker, son. All the milk and honey is on the other side of this hell.” He glided through the bedroom doorway. I lay there hoping [MASK] was home.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Blue	I’ll give your idea some thought. Our big problem now is to get my boss to agree to changing those big bills for us so we can get our share.” [MASK] came back with the lyrical account of my boss’s virtues and love for me.
<name>Herb</name>	Herb	Blue	I wondered how she could get kicks with freakish lesbians and get sick with boys, I was still trying to solve the riddle when dawn’s bleak blade slit night’s miserable throat. I heard [MASK] moving around in his room down the hall.
<name>Betty</name>	Betty	Johnny	I’d have to pay her a personal call. I went back to the apartment and dressed. On my way out, the whore across the hall stuck her head through her open door. She whispered, “Come in here, [MASK], quick.”
<name>George</name>	George	Blue	We ordered ham and eggs with coffee and toast. [MASK] gave me an argument but I paid for our orders. We took our trays and sat down at a long table facing the front window. I hadn’t eaten a meal in a long time.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Blue	By the spring of Nineteen Forty-three, we were playing four alternate con games. I was going great for a twenty-year-old grifter. [MASK]’s nose was wide open for a young, shapely shake dancer.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Midge	I was looking out my bedroom window when [MASK]’s muffled voice said behind me, “Peek-a-boo. I see you.” I spun around. I saw a vague lump in my bed. She said, “Stop wandering around, square.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Blue	It was Sunday, our day off from the con. I went to the kitchen. [MASK] was sitting at the table sipping coffee with a grin on his face. He said, “Good morning, stranger. That must have been a helluva pussy you laid.
<name>Bubba</name>	Bubba	Blue	She held her wide-apart thighs against her fat breasts with her hands. She scooted her massive rear-end to the edge of the dresser and leaned her back against the mirror. [MASK] said, “That filthy slut is posing for dirty pictures.
<name>names</name>	names	Grigsby	After all, she was now at least in her late forties. She shouldn’t have any color regrets. With her dark brown skin, she had done better in life than my near-white mother. It took a while to scan through all the listed [MASK]’s.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Blue	We’ll go to the Cadillac people tomorrow and drop my car off. The transmission is slipping. I’ll take a cab to the mark for the lug back to you.” [MASK] and I got out of the house the next morning around eleven-thirty a.m.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Mule	He didn’t get it with a permanent lock on the safety of that magnum. That mark must be leery and jumpy as hell after [MASK] tried to sting him. “It’s going to be hard to take him off just on the authentic appearance of our stuff.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Phala	I felt so sad to think that [MASK] was probably in the sun on that bench near the weeping willow tree. I could almost see her pitiful vacant eyes and smell the sharp odor of the lye soap in the faded blue smock.
<name>Jackie</name>	Jackie	Blue	I was enjoying the delicious juices flooding my taste buds when a fearful silence crushed down on the crowded room. I swung my eyes to the bar. The hustlers were like mute crows still-lifed on a mahogany fence. [MASK] was staring toward the door.
<name>Darling</name>	Darling	Darling	She picked up on the fourth ring. The sound of her lilting contralto voice soothed arid cooled me. She said, “Oh! [MASK], we’ve suffered through the first five times you called, haven’t we? Please tell me where you are.
<name>Folks</name>	Folks	Blue	I said, “No, [MASK], I haven’t seen a broad in there.” He said, “Goddamn it Folks, don’t get cute with me. You wouldn’t have to see a broad to know. Did you hear a broad in there?”
<name>Blanche</name>	Blanche	Midge	He laughed and said, “Thrown out? You deserve a medal. It was just what she needs most. Go on and finish out your nap. I’m going to let some fresh air into [MASK]’s room.” He went through the bathroom.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name that should be filled in for this passage as the language used is offensive and inappropriate.)	unknown (There is no proper name that should be filled in for this passage as the language used is offensive and inappropriate.)	Phala	That dizzy bitch, [MASK] just had to fuck your tramp pecker-wood father, huh? She’d open her legs for any bum, wouldn’t she?” I stood up in the bed and clawed the wall. Another black rat scampered before my terrified eyes.
<name>Bessie</name>	Bessie	Tanja	“That last night when I caught her wrong, I had pulled up near the hotel where she was dancing. I waited and waited until I saw the cabaret’s neon go out. “A nigger flunkey that had seen me with [MASK] walked up to me with a sly grin on his face.
<name>Cherry</name>	Cherry	Midge	I guess it’s a hurting thing for a girl to know she hasn’t got enough on the ball to hook a guy. Too bad about you, [MASK]. But as they say, that’s life.” The dreamy eyes blazed angrily. She was trembling.
<name>Grady</name>	Grady	Blue	I thought sure he’d whack me on the top of my head and say, “Now! Folks!” Instead [MASK] said, “When is the best Nigger con man in the country going to get some respect from his partner?
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Blue	Our old cleaning woman was hard at work in the hall. [MASK] came to the side of the bed and said, “How are you doing?” I said, “I don’t feel like I could touch the sky. But I’m not sick.”
<name>the bank</name>	the bank	Percy	I stood there on the corner waiting for them to see me so we could work the blowoff on [MASK]. With an ordinary mark, I would have come a half a block closer but I didn’t know the range of that forty-five.
<name>she</name>	she	Blue	You’ll like her. “You’ll get work in the flat-joint for the rest of the summer. I’ll find out the score on your mother in the morning. You haven’t any reason to worry when [MASK]’s your friend. Okay?”
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Blue	No answer. I was getting worried. Had she decided to dump me even before we started? I called home to find out if she’d called there. [MASK] said she hadn’t. I gave him the booth phone number so she could reach me.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Blue	I was glad I hadn’t said the things I started to say. I followed him to his bedroom. I said, “[MASK], you’re right. It wasn’t your fault that I wasn’t in town when she died. Where is she?”
<name>Wally</name>	Wally	Goddamn	In fact, I thought you were two guys. When did you get out?” He stepped back and said, “This morning. I been sitting on these steps since four o’clock. I oughta kiss you, old buddy. [MASK], you’re tall.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Johnny	[MASK] and I witnessed the most distressing thing at the theater. “An adult coon was doing the most horribly despicable things to an underaged white baby girl. It’s nothing short of social catastrophe when coons can publicly violate the flower of white womanhood. “Oh!
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Blue	It was a chaotic pattern of disjointed lines and angles. [MASK] came back with a tall glass filled to the brim with whiskey. He put it on the nightstand and said, “Folks, this is it for tonight. I’ve locked the juice cabinet.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Blue	I said, “What happened? What did you do?” She looked away at the sky and said, “I won’t tell you. It’s too awful. Say, listen, I didn’t mean half of that stuff I said to [MASK] this morning.
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Pocket	The mark wavered and rubbed his nose. [MASK] punched the old man hard in the side with his elbow and shouted, “Are you crazy? You can’t lose now. Ain’t you got as much faith in yourself as I got in you?
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Pete	He’ll be back momentarily. You remember [MASK]. He was our weekend guest last year.” She said, “Of course I do. A sourpuss, but really a thoroughly nice fellow.” I raised the fragile crystal to my mouth and sipped the amber bubbly.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Pocket	We got some muscle nailing down this hotel. So, don’t try to take a powder while we’re gone.” [MASK] followed them to the door and blubbered, “This poor white boy is blind. His rocks got a eighty-grand legit value.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Phala	“Sure I took you in off those brutal streets. I took the risk and sheltered you from the juvenile authorities who wanted to make you a ward of the court, after those filthy black dogs drove [MASK] to madness.
<name>Streeter</name>	Streeter	Lord	‘“He’s got a big fine office no more than two blocks from here. [MASK] have mercy, I just remembered I was on an errand for my boss when I had this good luck. Friends, you wait right here until I get back.
<name>The narrator</name>	The narrator	Shorty	But who the hell is the roller?” [MASK] shouted, “I don’t know. He’s a brown-skin, speckled sonuvabitch—real lanky, with a funny walk like a broad. I know one thing, he’s the screwiest roller these eyes have saw.”
<name>Mayella</name>	Mayella	Johnny	Her answer summed up the way I feel now about the whole God thing. “She said, ‘[MASK], the white people have all the nice things of life and all the money. Niggers have all the misery and poverty and their religion.
<name>Benny</name>	Benny	Jack	For a moment he looked puzzled. Then he said, “Yeah, [MASK], I’m hip to the scene. You want one for all night, or just a quickie?” I said, “I don’t want a broad.
<name>Folks</name>	Folks	Blue	I’m sorry, [MASK].” He threw his head back and laughed. He said, “You work fast, Folks. Forget it. She likes you. She was smiling when she walked away from you. “Say, kid, I called about your mother.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Blue	I had died. That was it. And the undertaker was beside me pumping embalming fluid into my arm with a rubber tube attached to a bottle above me. He was smiling down at me. [MASK] must have bought one of the more expensive funerals for me.
<name>Baby</name>	Baby	Blue	I remembered how happy she had been when she thought she had my baby inside of her. I remembered my contentment with my head resting on her warm satin bosom. She’d croon and baby talk to me. [MASK] was all wrong. I had to have her back.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Blue	[MASK] came back and slid into the booth beside me. I turned and looked at him. He thumb-stroked the lobe of his right ear. It was our secret crossfire signal. He was ready to play. I heaved a sigh and leaped into the center of the fire.
<name>Dodger</name>	Dodger	Pocket	I fired all of my thieving boost last night. [MASK], I could use you on the outside to feed the belly-sticks and to heckle the marks for the usual ten percent of the box. Don’t worry, you’ll make a buck.
<name>Satan</name>	Satan	Satan	We still in love. Don’t the Lord work in mysterious ways his wonders to perform? It’s been over five years since I seen you right on this corner. He sent you to drive [MASK]’s imps away.
<name>Harlem</name>	Harlem	Cleo	“Don’t worry. When we get to the Thirty-first Street neighborhood, we’ll only have to cruise a couple of streets. It will be a cinch to spot [MASK]’s purple Thunder-bird parked near one of the after-hours joints.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Phala	Maybe I’m better off that he never came back. He might have made a drummer out of me. At least as a con man I could give my brain a play. Yes, [MASK] really needed her waitress-hostess job. But there was one awful drawback.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Celeste	She’s not forty years old for nothing. She’s got three girls shoplifting for her. “I’m going to keep the apartment and make love to [MASK] like a good little wife while those boosters steal our living. “So, don’t worry about me.
<name>She</name>	She	Phala	She was drinking heavily, both on the job and at home. There were piles of empty Old Crow whiskey bottles throughout the apartment and on the back porch. [MASK] never felt like cleaning the house anymore. I did the best I could at cleaning.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Pocket	Besides, at six tomorrow night we show the stuff to a buyer who knows what we got and won’t hassle. Forget it. We don’t want to sell.” [MASK] angrily scooped up the nine rings and hurled them into the bag.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Whisty	I envision a warm relationship between us. [MASK] has already laid the foundation. I’ve told her a thousand times what a great P.R. talent was going to waste.” A waiter came with chilled glasses on a silver tray.
<name>Annabelle</name>	Annabelle	Phala	“[MASK] was drinking and tired. She didn’t see the pill go in her glass. Two of them dirty niggers carried her out to the back door of the flea-bag across the street. They had rented a back room on the alley for the night.
<name>Brigid O'Shaughnessy</name>	Brigid O'Shaughnessy	Dawn	A DOLL WITH A LUST FOR DAMES I awoke and felt the pajama silk plastered to my sweaty chest. I thought I’d heard an angry female voice. [MASK]’s gray drab brush had blotted out the moon’s soft-blue tapestry on the ceiling.
<name>Spats</name>	Spats	Polack	He glared down at the fake leg wound and said, “[MASK], dis stuff looks kosha. But I ain’t inna mood fuh no fuckin’ pig inna pok. I want ya boids should go wid us and lat a jooler peep at de rocks.
<name>He</name>	He	Blue	Nothing can change that or the sincere affection I feel for you. We’re not going to die. Like always, we’ll come up with the perfect con to escape the trap.” It was pure bravado. [MASK] didn’t answer.
<name>he</name>	he	Blue	Believe me, the flue had not been devised to bilk a dangerous roller out of his shakedown. The most disturbing question was, what if he was wise to the flue? When [MASK] went to the john I was only partially in the heat of the dangerous affair.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Midge	Why hadn’t [MASK] cooked? My leaden eyes searched the gloom. I went to the frosted window and peered out. Green plastic rings of holly and cutout Santa Claus faces with red cheeks and cheerful smiles hung in the neoned windows of the deserted stores across the snow-mantled street.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Livin	A tiny, dapper guy came through the door and stood at the bar next to [MASK]’. I wouldn’t have noticed the dwarf if he hadn’t had such a strange face. He looked like a pure-blooded Chinese that had been painted black.
<name>her</name>	her	Camille	I wanted to walk out of there and throw the roses in the gutter and forget [MASK]. But I just couldn’t slough off a Goddess like that. I was sweaty and disgusted when I dialed her number the sixth time. She picked up on the fourth ring.
<name>myself</name>	myself	Blue	I’d show the cocky author of that article that his rundown on chump drunks didn’t really fit me after all. For the next two days I didn’t take a drop. I slept worse and I had no pep in the street with [MASK].
<name>Sam Spade</name>	Sam Spade	Blue	He said, “[MASK], I’ll die and go to the bottomless pits of hell before I let you flimflam me out of my two grand. We’ll drop it in the box together.” I palmed the two grand off the seat.
<name>Mark</name>	Mark	Blue	I slipped the mark’s sawbuck back to him. The mark grinned. [MASK] said, “Goddamnit, I’m going to chill your shit now. Let’s flip for twenty.” I said, “You can’t scare us.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Bill	He said, “[MASK], I hope I’m not disturbing you. I got lonesome, so I thought I’d drop over for a chat.” I stepped aside and said, “No, you’re not disturbing me. Come in and have a drink with me.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Blue	I fell asleep and had freakish erotic dreams about the Goddess until six P.M. I got up and warmed up Swiss steak with macaroni and cheese. [MASK] was out so I went to the phone to call the Goddess. I walked away from it.
<name>She</name>	She	Johnny	She was here last night. “[MASK], we are madly in love. Nobody can make love the way she does. I can’t live without it. She’s got a fabulous apartment. She’s begged me to live with her.
<name>Betty</name>	Betty	Midge	At first [MASK] and I would be kissing and fooling around. Then I’d be taking a sweet ride. A burly broad would pop up. She had a loud coarse laugh. The ugly big-tit broad would stand there buck naked with a jock three times the size of my own.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Blue	I’m known as White Folks now. “[MASK]’s going to call me tonight around nine. He’s heard me talk about you. I’m pretty sure it will be okay with him for you to stay here until you get on your feet.
<name>the mark</name>	the mark	Blue	I winked at the mark and said, “What makes you think we’re pikers? We’re not afraid to bet even as much as ten dollars or more. Just make it light on yourself, boy.” [MASK] said, “I take that bet.
<name>Bigger</name>	Bigger	Blue	My mother’s brain withered. She died a drooling mental cripple. The first time I went to see her she tried to snatch my balls off. “So, [MASK], I could get a license to bellyache. You’re lucky to be jet black.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Sugarkins	The ceiling light burst on. She walked over to the bed and sat on the side of it. I flinched as she dabbed gently at my stained crotch and thighs with a hot damp towel. She said, “[MASK], don’t look so unhappy.
<name>Jan</name>	Jan	Pocket	It half closed its eyes and squeaked, “Like I told [MASK], I ain’t hip to a white trick baby like you so dumb you’re passing for a nigger. I just ain’t never heard of it.” I shrieked!
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Pocket	Deadly silence hammered my eardrums. I was about to deliver the tale when [MASK] cut in and blurted, “It’s a twenty-grand line. And we’re not dealing with people who look at real stuff and don’t know it.
<name>Holly</name>	Holly	Phala	Then I remembered that sweetly poisonous voice. I just couldn’t understand, how could she have been so cruel? [MASK] and I needed her so much. I rode to the Sixty-third Street stop. I got off and went to the opposite platform.
<name>Bigger</name>	Bigger	Honest	He slipped it into a leather case. The crowd moved away. I said, “Listen, Mister, I’m not a white boy. I’m colored like you. [MASK], I’m really colored. My mother is about your color.”
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Midge	I went to the bathroom and brushed my teeth. I opened the door to [MASK]’s room. Her furniture was like mine. I went back to my room and put the light out. Moonlight flooded the room when I pulled the drape cord.
