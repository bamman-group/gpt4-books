<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Jane	"Are you apprehensive of the new sphere you are about to enter?--of the new life into which you are passing?" "No." "You puzzle me, [MASK]: your look and tone of sorrowful audacity perplex and pain me. I want an explanation."
<name>God</name>	God	Heaven	"My spirit," I answered mentally, "is willing to do what is right; and my flesh, I hope, is strong enough to accomplish the will of [MASK], when once that will is distinctly known to me.
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Leah	"She is a good hand, I daresay," said the charwoman. "Ah!--she understands what she has to do,--nobody better," rejoined [MASK] significantly; "and it is not every one could fill her shoes--not for all the money she gets."
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Sophie	We stayed there nearly a week: I and [MASK] used to walk every day in a great green place full of trees, called the Park; and there were many children there besides me, and a pond with beautiful birds in it, that I fed with crumbs.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Adele	She hastened to ring the bell; and when the tray came, she proceeded to arrange the cups, spoons, &c., with assiduous celerity. I and [MASK] went to the table; but the master did not leave his couch.
<name>Persians</name>	Persians	Persians	You seem to doubt me; I don't doubt myself: I know what my aim is, what my motives are; and at this moment I pass a law, unalterable as that of the Medes and [MASK], that both are right."
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Jane	"Oh, lean on me, sir." "[MASK], you offered me your shoulder once before; let me have it now." "Yes, sir, yes; and my arm." He sat down, and made me sit beside him.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Helen	[MASK] regarded me, probably with surprise: I could not now abate my agitation, though I tried hard; I continued to weep aloud. She sat down on the ground near me, embraced her knees with her arms, and rested her head upon them; in that attitude she remained silent as an Indian.
<name>Quixote</name>	Quixote	Rochester	"Did you not know he was called [MASK]?" Of course I did not--I had never heard of him before; but the old lady seemed to regard his existence as a universally understood fact, with which everybody must be acquainted by instinct.
<name>you</name>	you	Pilot	"I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night," he repeated, "and that is why I sent for you: the fire and the chandelier were not sufficient company for me; nor would [MASK] have been, for none of these can talk.
<name>Bertha</name>	Bertha	Mason	"You know this place, [MASK]," said our guide; "she bit and stabbed you here." He lifted the hangings from the wall, uncovering the second door: this, too, he opened.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Jane	Of yourself you could come with soft flight and nestle against my heart, if you would: seized against your will, you will elude the grasp like an essence--you will vanish ere I inhale your fragrance. Oh! come, [MASK], come!"
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Eliza	She was fast relapsing into stupor; nor did her mind again rally: at twelve o'clock that night she died. I was not present to close her eyes, nor were either of her daughters. They came to tell us the next morning that all was over. She was by that time laid out. [MASK]
<name>Miss Temple</name>	Miss Temple	Adele	I well remembered all; language, glance, and tone seemed at the moment vividly renewed. I was now in the schoolroom; [MASK] was drawing; I bent over her and directed her pencil. She looked up with a sort of start.
<name>Mademoiselle</name>	Mademoiselle	Barbara	" She rang her bell. "[MASK]," she said to the servant who answered it, "I have not yet had tea; bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies." And a tray was soon brought.
<name>the land</name>	the land	Morton	He said it was a very old name in that neighbourhood; that the ancestors of the house were wealthy; that all [MASK] had once belonged to them; that even now he considered the representative of that house might, if he liked, make an alliance with the best.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Adele	Yes; what then?" "In that case, sir, [MASK] ought to go to school: I am sure you will perceive the necessity of it." "To get her out of my bride's way, who might otherwise walk over her rather too emphatically?
<name>Nature</name>	Nature	Jane	'Where are you?' seemed spoken amongst mountains; for I heard a hill-sent echo repeat the words. Cooler and fresher at the moment the gale seemed to visit my brow: I could have deemed that in some wild, lone scene, I and [MASK] were meeting.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Hannah	I think this is a peculiar case--I must at least examine into it. Young woman, rise, and pass before me into the house." {Hush, [MASK]; I have a word to say to the woman: p323.jpg} With difficulty I obeyed him.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Janet	Just put your hand in mine, [MASK]--that I may have the evidence of touch as well as sight, to prove you are near me--and I will in a few words show you the real state of the case. Can you listen to me?"
<name>unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Jane	"Humility, [MASK]," said he, "is the groundwork of Christian virtues: you say right that you are not fit for the work. Who is fit for it? Or who, that ever was truly called, believed himself worthy of the summons?
<name>John</name>	John	Mary	"But you shall have some to-night. I am hungry: so are you, I daresay, only you forget." Summoning [MASK], I soon had the room in more cheerful order: I prepared him, likewise, a comfortable repast.
<name>Edmond</name>	Edmond	Jane	"Yes, sir; for hours if you will." "I ask only minutes. [MASK], did you ever hear or know that I was not the eldest son of my house: that I had once a brother older than I?"
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Georgiana	[MASK] almost started, and she opened her blue eyes wild and wide. "I know she had a particular wish to see me," I added, "and I would not defer attending to her desire longer than is absolutely necessary."
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Morton	[MASK], when I came to it two years ago, had no school: the children of the poor were excluded from every hope of progress. I established one for boys: I mean now to open a second school for girls.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jane	"You know I am a scoundrel, [MASK]?" ere long he inquired wistfully--wondering, I suppose, at my continued silence and tameness, the result rather of weakness than of will. "Yes, sir."
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Miss	She said "Good morning, [MASK]," in her usual phlegmatic and brief manner; and taking up another ring and more tape, went on with her sewing. "I will put her to some test," thought I: "such absolute impenetrability is past comprehension."
<name>Jane Eyre</name>	Jane Eyre	Jane	I know my Leader: that He is just as well as mighty; and while He has chosen a feeble instrument to perform a great task, He will, from the boundless stores of His providence, supply the inadequacy of the means to the end. Think like me, [MASK]--trust like me.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Helen	Why, then, should we ever sink overwhelmed with distress, when life is so soon over, and death is so certain an entrance to happiness--to glory?" I was silent; [MASK] had calmed me; but in the tranquillity she imparted there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness.
<name>the watch-dog</name>	the watch-dog	Pilot	The candle, wasted at last, went out; as it expired, I perceived streaks of grey light edging the window curtains: dawn was then approaching. Presently I heard [MASK] bark far below, out of his distant kennel in the courtyard: hope revived.
<name>Thornfield</name>	Thornfield	Ferndean	"I'll tell you, if I can, the idea, the picture these words opened to my mind: yet it is difficult to express what I want to express. [MASK] is buried, as you see, in a heavy wood, where sound falls dull, and dies unreverberating.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Jane	"What for, [MASK]?" "Just to comb out this shaggy black mane. I find you rather alarming, when I examine you close at hand: you talk of my being a fairy, but I am sure, you are more like a brownie.
<name>Madame Bovary</name>	Madame Bovary	Rasselas	"Is it still '[MASK]'?" I asked, coming behind her. "Yes," she said, "and I have just finished it." And in five minutes more she shut it up. I was glad of this.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Jane	You will not be my comforter, my rescuer? My deep love, my wild woe, my frantic prayer, are all nothing to you?" What unutterable pathos was in his voice! How hard it was to reiterate firmly, "I am going." "[MASK]!"
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Diana	Both the sisters seemed struck: not shocked or appalled; the tidings appeared in their eyes rather momentous than afflicting. "Dead?" repeated [MASK]. "Yes." She riveted a searching gaze on her brother's face. "And what then?
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Sarah	[MASK] came back with her; they both went to bed; they were whispering together for half-an-hour before they fell asleep. I caught scraps of their conversation, from which I was able only too distinctly to infer the main subject discussed.
<name>Bertha</name>	Bertha	Sophie	There was a light in the dressing-table, and the door of the closet, where, before going to bed, I had hung my wedding-dress and veil, stood open; I heard a rustling there. I asked, '[MASK], what are you doing?'
<name>Lucie</name>	Lucie	Jane	"I will at least choose--_her I love best_. [MASK], will you marry me?" "Yes, sir." "A poor blind man, whom you will have to lead about by the hand?" "Yes, sir."
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Jane	Yes; but the time is of no consequence: what followed is the strange point. You will think me superstitious,--some superstition I have in my blood, and always had: nevertheless, this is true--true at least it is that I heard what I now relate. "As I exclaimed '[MASK]!
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Helen	"How are you to-night, [MASK]? Have you coughed much to-day?" "Not quite so much, I think, ma'am." "And the pain in your chest?" "It is a little better."
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Mary	"Because I had come in, in [MASK]'s stead, with the tray." "And there is enchantment in the very hour I am now spending with you. Who can tell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life I have dragged on for months past?
<name>Dr. Watson</name>	Dr. Watson	Mason	"But under such circumstances, what could one do?" returned [MASK]. "Oh, it was frightful!" he added, shuddering. "And I did not expect it: she looked so quiet at first."
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Rochester	shall we run?" was demanded confusedly on all hands. But for the moonlight they would have been in complete darkness. They ran to and fro; they crowded together: some sobbed, some stumbled: the confusion was inextricable. "Where the devil is [MASK]?"
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Jane	You, penniless! Famous equality and fraternisation! Close union! Intimate attachment!" "But, [MASK], your aspirations after family ties and domestic happiness may be realised otherwise than by the means you contemplate: you may marry." "Nonsense, again!
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Mason	He held out the tiny glass, and I half filled it from the water-bottle on the washstand. "That will do;--now wet the lip of the phial." I did so; he measured twelve drops of a crimson liquid, and presented it to [MASK].
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Adele	I have a place to repair to, which will be a secure sanctuary from hateful reminiscences, from unwelcome intrusion--even from falsehood and slander." "And take [MASK] with you, sir," I interrupted; "she will be a companion for you."
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	John	I followed, taking care to stand on one side, so that, screened by the curtain, I could see without being seen. The ten minutes [MASK] had given seemed very long, but at last wheels were heard; four equestrians galloped up the drive, and after them came two open carriages.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Jane	why. I forget she knows nothing of the character of that woman, or of the circumstances attending my infernal union with her. Oh, I am certain [MASK] will agree with me in opinion, when she knows all that I know!
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Mary	Then why does he follow you so with his eyes, and get you so frequently alone with him, and keep you so continually at his side? [MASK] and I had both concluded he wished you to marry him." "He does--he has asked me to be his wife."
<name>Prince</name>	Prince	Adele	"She is far better as she is," concluded [MASK], after musing some time: "besides, she would get tired of living with only you in the moon. If I were mademoiselle, I would never consent to go with you."
<name>John</name>	John	Carter	"Now, [MASK], be on the alert," he said to this last: "I give you but half-an-hour for dressing the wound, fastening the bandages, getting the patient downstairs and all." "But is he fit to move, sir?"
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Jane	" "On this arm, I have neither hand nor nails," he said, drawing the mutilated limb from his breast, and showing it to me. "It is a mere stump--a ghastly sight! Don't you think so, [MASK]?"
<name>Reader</name>	Reader	Jane	I was glad to give her a sufficient sum to set her up in a good line of business, and so get decently rid of her. But, [MASK], I see by your face you are not forming a very favourable opinion of me just now.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Jane	Nothing else that has being would have been tolerable to me in the character of creditor for such an obligation: but you: it is different;--I feel your benefits no burden, [MASK]." He paused; gazed at me: words almost visible trembled on his lips,--but his voice was checked.
<name>me</name>	me	Hindostanee	"Only me." "Did you ask to learn?" "No." "He wished to teach you?" "Yes." A second pause. "Why did he wish it? Of what use could [MASK] be to you?"
<name>St. John</name>	St. John	Wondering	It aroused him; he uncrossed his legs, sat erect, turned to me. "Leave your book a moment, and come a little nearer the fire," he said. [MASK], and of my wonder finding no end, I complied.
<name>Wuthering</name>	Wuthering	Rivers	I am obscure: [MASK] is an old name; but of the three sole descendants of the race, two earn the dependant's crust among strangers, and the third considers himself an alien from his native country--not only for life, but in death.
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Mason	"Sir--sir," interrupted the clergyman, "do not forget you are in a sacred place." Then addressing [MASK], he inquired gently, "Are you aware, sir, whether or not this gentleman's wife is still living?"
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Jane	"Yes: but remember, [MASK], you promised to wake with me the night before my wedding." "I did; and I will keep my promise, for an hour or two at least: I have no wish to go to bed."
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Helen	I stopped, distressed. While I tried to devour my tears, a fit of coughing seized [MASK]; it did not, however, wake the nurse; when it was over, she lay some minutes exhausted; then she whispered--
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Janet	he cried: "I should never dream that. Besides, there is that peculiar voice of hers, so animating and piquant, as well as soft: it cheers my withered heart; it puts life into it.--What, [MASK]! Are you an independent woman?
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Jane,--the	I wonder how you will answer me a year hence, should I ask a favour it does not suit your convenience or pleasure to grant." "Ask me something now, [MASK] least thing: I desire to be entreated--" "
<name>Jove</name>	Jove	Jove	She says, sir, that she'll have no gentlemen; they need not trouble themselves to come near her; nor," he added, with difficulty suppressing a titter, "any ladies either, except the young, and single." "By [MASK], she has taste!"
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Saul	"You mocking changeling--fairy-born and human-bred! You make me feel as I have not felt these twelve months. If [MASK] could have had you for his David, the evil spirit would have been exorcised without the aid of the harp."
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Bessie	They will have a great deal of money, and you will have none: it is your place to be humble, and to try to make yourself agreeable to them." "What we tell you is for your good," added [MASK], in no harsh voice,
<name>Miss Temple</name>	Miss Temple	Jane	"[MASK], your little feet are bare; lie down and cover yourself with my quilt." I did so: she put her arm over me, and I nestled close to her. After a long silence, she resumed, still whispering-- "
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Helen	I advanced; then paused by the crib side: my hand was on the curtain, but I preferred speaking before I withdrew it. I still recoiled at the dread of seeing a corpse. "[MASK]!" I whispered softly, "are you awake?"
<name>Cathy</name>	Cathy	Diana	"You still look very pale--and so thin! Poor child!--poor girl!" [MASK] had a voice toned, to my ear, like the cooing of a dove. She possessed eyes whose gaze I delighted to encounter. Her whole face seemed to me full of charm.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Mary	[MASK] would sit and watch me by the hour together: then she would take lessons; and a docile, intelligent, assiduous pupil she made. Thus occupied, and mutually entertained, days passed like hours, and weeks like days.
<name>John</name>	John	Alice	It has seemed to me more than once when I have been in a doze, that my dear husband, who died fifteen years since, has come in and sat down beside me; and that I have even heard him call me by my name, [MASK], as he used to do.
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Jane	"Who the deuce have you been with?" "If you twist in that way you will make me pull the hair out of your head; and then I think you will cease to entertain doubts of my substantiality." "Who have you been with, [MASK]?"
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Jane	Presently she said, in the sweetest tone-- "How comfortable I am! That last fit of coughing has tired me a little; I feel as if I could sleep: but don't leave me, [MASK]; I like to have you near me."
<name>Mason</name>	Mason	Jane	No--a mere scratch. Don't be so overcome, man: bear up! I'll fetch a surgeon for you now, myself: you'll be able to be removed by morning, I hope. [MASK]," he continued. "Sir?"
<name>Bessie</name>	Bessie	Varry	"We mean to teach it some time--or at least the elements, as they say; and then we shall get more money than we do now." "[MASK] like: but give ower studying; ye've done enough for to-night."
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Janet	Let me look at your watch." "Fasten it into your girdle, [MASK], and keep it henceforward: I have no use for it." "It is nearly four o'clock in the afternoon, sir. Don't you feel hungry?"
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Leah	I rang the bell, for I wanted a candle; and I wanted, too, to get an account of this visitant. [MASK] entered. "What dog is this?" "He came with master." "With whom?"
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Jane	I looked up at him to read the signs of bliss in his face: it was ardent and flushed. "Give me your confidence, [MASK]," he said: "relieve your mind of any weight that oppresses it, by imparting it to me.
<name>John</name>	John	Hannah	"Eat that now," she said: "you must be hungry. [MASK] says you have had nothing but some gruel since breakfast." I did not refuse it, for my appetite was awakened and keen.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Helen	I was asleep, and [MASK] was--dead. Her grave is in Brocklebridge churchyard: for fifteen years after her death it was only covered by a grassy mound; but now a grey marble tablet marks the spot, inscribed with her name, and the word "Resurgam."
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Jane	I wanted to feel the thoughts whose force he seemed breasting and resisting. At the churchyard wicket he stopped: he discovered I was quite out of breath. "Am I cruel in my love?" he said. "Delay an instant: lean on me, [MASK]."
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Mason	"One never knows what she has, sir: she is so cunning: it is not in mortal discretion to fathom her craft." "We had better leave her," whispered [MASK]. "Go to the devil!" was his brother-in-law's recommendation.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Georgiana	[MASK] also advanced to look. The other drawings pleased her much, but she called that "an ugly man." They both seemed surprised at my skill. I offered to sketch their portraits; and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline.
<name>Lowood</name>	Lowood	Lowood	"Only such books as came in my way; and they have not been numerous or very learned." "You have lived the life of a nun: no doubt you are well drilled in religious forms;--Brocklehurst, who I understand directs [MASK], is a parson, is he not?"
<name>Bessie</name>	Bessie	Bessie	Even for me life had its gleams of sunshine. CHAPTER V Five o'clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of January, when [MASK] brought a candle into my closet and found me already up and nearly dressed.
<name>madame</name>	madame	Jane	But as you are rich, [MASK], you have now, no doubt, friends who will look after you, and not suffer you to devote yourself to a blind lameter like me?" "I told you I am independent, sir, as well as rich: I am my own mistress."
<name>Mason</name>	Mason	Hannah	Move off, I say!" "Hush, [MASK]! I have a word to say to the woman. You have done your duty in excluding, now let me do mine in admitting her. I was near, and listened to both you and her.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Jane	"Rain and wind, indeed! Yes, you are dripping like a mermaid; pull my cloak round you: but I think you are feverish, [MASK]: both your cheek and hand are burning hot. I ask again, is there anything the matter?"
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Jane	"That was a strange question to be put by his darling [MASK]." "Indeed! I considered it a very natural and necessary one: he had talked of his future wife dying with him. What did he mean by such a pagan idea? _
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Abbot	"What a dreadful noise! it went quite through me!" exclaimed [MASK]. "Take me out! Let me go into the nursery!" was my cry. "What for? Are you hurt? Have you seen something?"
<name>Little</name>	Little	Jane	"Well, [MASK], do you know me?" asked the familiar voice. "Only take off the red cloak, sir, and then--" "But the string is in a knot--help me." "Break it, sir."
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Charles	If he had but been able to look to a distance, and see how what they call the spirit of the age was tending! Still, I like [MASK]--I respect him--I pity him, poor murdered king!
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Jane	she exclaimed. "You would not live three months there, I am certain. You never shall go: you have not consented, have you, [MASK]?" "I have refused to marry him--" "And have consequently displeased him?" she suggested.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jane	[MASK], you please me, and you master me--you seem to submit, and I like the sense of pliancy you impart; and while I am twining the soft, silken skein round my finger, it sends a thrill up my arm to my heart.
<name>the doctor</name>	the doctor	Bessie	I feel ashamed for him when I see him." She was getting much excited. "I think I had better leave her now," said I to [MASK], who stood on the other side of the bed. "
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Jane	I did so: she put her arm over me, and I nestled close to her. After a long silence, she resumed, still whispering-- "I am very happy, [MASK]; and when you hear that I am dead, you must be sure and not grieve: there is nothing to grieve about.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Jane	"[MASK], do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood? Listen!" In listening, I sobbed convulsively; for I could repress what I endured no longer; I was obliged to yield, and I was shaken from head to foot with acute distress.
<name>they</name>	they	fortune	"Friends always forget those whom [MASK] forsakes," I murmured, as I undrew the bolt and passed out. I stumbled over an obstacle: my head was still dizzy, my sight was dim, and my limbs were feeble. I could not soon recover myself.
<name>Dr. Livesey</name>	Dr. Livesey	Carter	"She's done for me, I fear," was the faint reply. "Not a whit!--courage! This day fortnight you'll hardly be a pin the worse of it: you've lost a little blood; that's all. [MASK], assure him
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Jane	"Oh, [MASK]! my hope--my love--my life!" broke in anguish from his lips. Then came a deep, strong sob. I had already gained the door; but, reader, I walked back--walked back as determinedly as I had retreated.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Janet	"I don't care about being married." "You should care, [MASK]: if I were what I once was, I would try to make you care--but--a sightless block!" He relapsed again into gloom.
