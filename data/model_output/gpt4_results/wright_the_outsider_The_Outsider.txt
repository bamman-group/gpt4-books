<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Sarah	“It’s all my fault,” [MASK] wept. “I pushed him to disobey the decision . . . He did what I asked and now they got ’im . . . He was screaming when they took him away.” She clenched her teeth.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Dot	Her knowing about [MASK] would redouble her hate for him. She would bare the details of his private blunderings before the domestic courts . . . He had to try to stop her. But could he? Maybe it was already too late?
<name>Martin</name>	Martin	Cross	[MASK] was on his feet before he knew it and had traversed the aisle and was standing between the woman and the waiter, fronting the woman, blocking her action with his uplifted right hand which still clutched his napkin. The woman sighed and lowered her hand.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Cross	[MASK] did as he was told; when seated in the car he leaned back and sighed. His despair drained off him in one second and he felt that he wanted to sleep. And in the next instant he knew exacdy what he had to do.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Damon	The voice was insistent. Yes; he’d try to answer; he struggled to move his tongue and shape his lips and he whispered: “I don’t know. I think so . . .” “Don’t try to talk too much, [MASK].
<name>Leslie</name>	Leslie	Joe	“You’ve been wanting to talk to me. Now, I’m listening . . .” He lifted himself on an elbow, his eyes on her face, but he was really seeking over the snowdrifts outside, looking for [MASK]’s body.
<name>Algy</name>	Algy	Cross	“Gosh, I don’t know. I only got a glimpse of ’im,” [MASK] was purposefully vague. “Look, you ought to come over and I could explain it all. I just moved in this morning, see?
<name>Stavrogin</name>	Stavrogin	Houston	“When did I mention ideas?” [MASK] asked scornfully. “Ideas are just so much froth on the top of a mug of beer, my dear boy. Men are inventing ideas every day to justify for themselves and others their actions and needs.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Gladys	[MASK] followed and stood at the other end of the room and regarded him with hostile eyes. He could feel that she was clamoring for an emotional scene. Well, he would refuse her any such satisfaction. He would be polite, bantering, if possible.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Cross	We pretend that we have law and order. But we don’t, really. We have imposed a visible order, but hidden under that veneer of order the jungle still seethes.” “But why do you call it a jungle?” [MASK] asked.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Hilton	When he reached the third floor corridor, he looked for the number. He came to the door of [MASK]’s room and paused; the door stood open and he could hear the whirr of a vacuum cleaner. He stepped to one side and waited.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Eva	[MASK] pulled down the shades and he could feel that the room had grown dark. She cradled his head in her arms and whispered to him: “Can I get you something?” “No.” He was fighting the fight of his life.
<name>He</name>	He	Cross	“Then what was it?” “You’ll never know.” “Another revolutionary group?” “No.” “You’re with the police, then?” “Hell, no.” “Then why did you do it?” [MASK] laughed.
<name>Lucasta</name>	Lucasta	Hattie	He had to break out of this dream. [MASK] was already the melancholy memory of a woman he had tried to help and failed. He felt that his fleeing was best for her, not the best that could be for her, but his best.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Gladys	He caught hold of her shoulder and she lifted her eyes and stared at him and he returned her stare with make-believe astonishment until her eyes fell. “What’s the matter, [MASK]! You’re shaking] Here, let me put you to bed.
<name>me</name>	me	Dot	“Sure; if I had it.” “Can’t you borrow some?” “I’m already up to my neck in debt.” “Give her monthly payments—” “And what’ll be left for [MASK], then?
<name>Gruber</name>	Gruber	Hilton	So they chewed each other up. When gods fall out, little worms can live . . . “But, joking aside . . . You killed [MASK] with his own gun and you didn’t leave a clue. How did you get into the hotel?
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Eva	She would never be able to comprehend that he was a lost soul, spinning like a stray atom far beyond the ken of her mind to conceive. The extremity of his state had unveiled [MASK], had made hope and trust rise in her for the first time since her deception.
<name>Malcolm</name>	Malcolm	Cross	“Fine,” [MASK] answered. “And you?” “Just dragging my black ass, serving these white sons-ofbitches,” the waiter said in a sniggling whisper. “Be with you in a sec. I’m the only waiter in this car.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Hilton	His fingerprints— Suddenly he did not want to try to save himself. What was the use? But he had to. He took a dirty shirt of [MASK]’s and wiped wherever he thought he had touched. He had to go, had to get out of this room.
<name>Malloy</name>	Malloy	Cross	The cop broke the gun and extracted the bullets. “I’ve a permit to carry a gun,” he told them gently. There was a moment’s silence. [MASK] took his wallet from his inside coat pocket and tendered the permit. “Jesus!
<name>Bigger</name>	Bigger	Eva	He leaped clear of the steps of the stoop and saw that a crowd of Negroes had already begun to gather in a knot near the edge of the sidewalk. He sprinted to them, plowing them aside. Yes . . . There was [MASK] . . .
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Cross	[MASK] watched her closely, wondering if she remembered his confessional babblings. For a moment her stare was full on him, then she looked at the floor. Suddenly she reached for his hand and squeezed it tightly. “These Communists are mad!”
<name>Al</name>	Al	Jack	“Say, [MASK], what in hell do we do with ’im?” The older clerk pulled down his mouth and muttered: “Hell, go ahead and give ’im a certificate if he was born around here. These clowns don’t mean any harm.”
<name>Trask</name>	Trask	Houston	“Why?” “Because you know the answer.” “You would kill them, wouldn’t you?” “I decline to answer.” “Goddammit, I’ll break your spirit yet!” [MASK] raged.
<name>Yasha</name>	Yasha	Sarah	“Don’t, [MASK],” he protested good-naturedly. “You bastard! You’re making jun of me! I could kill you, kill you ... I swear, I could! You hear, I could kill you . . .”
<name>Myrde</name>	Myrde	Dot	“Oh, boy, I’d have you in a way that you’d never forget!” “Do you think I don’t know that?” “I’d get your money, your job, and throw you smack into jail!” “Oh, Myrde, no . . [MASK] protested.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Cross	[MASK] thumbed through the book, found the number, then walked slowly toward the telephone. His mind clearly grasped the entire situation and every muscle of his body was relaxed. Now, I’d like to see them figure that out, he told himself with a grim smile.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Cross	He saw policemen pouring upon the underground tracks and heard someone shout: “Tell ’em the current’s cut off!” [MASK] felt hands lifting him on to the platform, and now another nurse had hold of his arm. About him was a babble of voices.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Damon	I had to see how you would react when I told you of your mother’s death, how you would react when you saw your sons . . . I’m a District Attorney, [MASK]; I was tracking down emotional clues; I was doing my police work . . .
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Gladys	Realizing that she was blocking his path, she stepped cautiously to one side. He went into the bedroom and began to pack. She waited in the doorway, still nervously clutching the gun. “[MASK],” he ventured to protest. “Get out!”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Eva	He realized as he went down the steps that he was acting more as a kind of proxy for the feelings of [MASK] than his own. I really don’t care, he thought. When he reached the landing of the first floor, he paused.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Cross	“My friend’s dead now. Come on, have a heart.” [MASK] aped the sentiment of nostalgic distress. “I want to see his mother—” “Why don’t you try his pastor at his church?” the girl suggested.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Houston	[MASK] rubbed his hands nervously across his eyes. “Goddammit, I was your unwitting accomplice for seventy-two hours! I just couldn’t bring myself to admit what I knew in my heart to be true! And no doubt you were banking on just that.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Sam	“I can’t remember everybody who rides in this elevator,” the boy complained. “Maybe he’s in the dining room,” the clerk said. “Maybe,” [MASK] said, getting into his elevator to ride another load of passengers up.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Cross	“Get some help, please,” [MASK] pleaded. “Somebody— Somebody do something— She’s hurt!” An elderly Negro with white hair bent to him and whispered: “I sent in an alarm for the police.” “Did she jump outta a window?”
<name>Grimesby</name>	Grimesby	Herndon	That blow could have caused death, not at once, but certainly [MASK] would have died of it eventually. Most certainly he was stunned by it and we further surmise that he kept on his feet and continued the fight . . .
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Hilton	She was lying on the floor of her bedroom; she had fainted. He lifted her to her bed, got a wet towel from the bathroom and patted her face with it. Her eyelids fluttered. “Give me [MASK]’s phone number,” he asked her.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Cross	“I mean this— Your appearance in our midst coincides with death and violence! I’m talking to the point now ... In the eyes of the Party you are under suspicion.” “You suspect me of what?” [MASK] asked boldly.
<name>loneliness</name>	loneliness	Eva	A sense of [MASK] flashed through him and he knew that the bleakness he was now feeling came from the desire he had had of having her with him . . . This homelessness would not have been so difficult to bear if he had not based his hopes on being with her.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Dot	She can get you into serious trouble . . .” [MASK] was talking to his wife! This was the end! The void in him grew hotter. A widening circle of people were becoming acquainted with his difficulties.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Blimin	[MASK] slapped his hand through the air with a gesture of disdain. “I mean this— Your appearance in our midst coincides with death and violence! I’m talking to the point now ... In the eyes of the Party you are under suspicion.”
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Ely	“We are not now keeping the Negro on such a short chain and they are slowly entering into our culture. But that is not the end of this problem. It is the beginning . . .” “What do you mean, [MASK]?”
<name>Claggart</name>	Claggart	Hilton	the captain continued to ignore his request for more information. “You saw him?” “No.” “Did [MASK] ever direaten you?” “No; why should he? Look, let me explain . . .
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Hilton	He’s prepared to die.” “I’m so new at all of this—” “You’re not so new. You know what you’re doing.” “But I don’t understand—” “You understand enough,” [MASK] cut him short.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Lionel	He should leave; his staying was no good for her . . . He pictured himself getting his suitcase, hat, and coat and going in search of a hiding place ... A slight nervousness went through him and he was about to act when he heard her voice. “[MASK]?”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Sarah	What kind of life had [MASK] lived that made it possible for her to laugh so openly at him? Pity for her came into his mind, but he banished it, realizing that it was hard to hold pity for someone who most likely did not want it.
<name>Jefferson</name>	Jefferson	Cross	[MASK] went to his room and stretched out on his bed, thinking, mulling. His was the hungry type of mind that needed only a scrap of an idea to feed upon, to start his analytical processes rolling. This thing of power . . .
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Dot	What excuse would she give? Then he guessed her strategy; she would give none. She would just be a helpless, hard-put-upon, suffering woman playing her oldest and strongest role. “[MASK], I’m talking to you,” he said.
<name>Milly</name>	Milly	Gladys	How fantastic it seemed! How did his grave look? And where was it? He did not even know the name of the cemetery ... He sighed and closed his eyes. Wonder what did [MASK] engrave on my tombstone . . . ?
<name>Malloy</name>	Malloy	Cross	one of the men asked. “That’s right,” he answered. One of the men pulled his right hand from his coat pocket and pushed his outstretched palm under [MASK]’s nose; in that palm gleamed a police badge.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Mills	[MASK] was no policeman, but he could slip a ten-dollar bill to a cop and he could be picked up and put in the Tombs for investigation. The police could always say that he resembled somebody they were looking for. His fingerprints would be taken . . .
<name>Harlequin</name>	Harlequin	Hilton	“Had they asked you to join?” “Of course.” “And what did you say?” “I stalled. I talked with them about general subjects—” “And you did not see [MASK]?” “I did not.”
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Cross	[MASK] watched the waiter place a tumbler of orange juice before the woman, then a platter of ham and poached eggs. The waiter was about to lift a silver pot of steaming coffee to fill her cup when the woman turned abruptly with her whole body, opening her mouth to speak.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Dot	Without answering, she caught hold of his arm and drew him forcibly into the hallway of the apartment. “Where’s [MASK]?” he asked, trying to keep his voice calm. “In bed,” she said flatly. “What’s happened?”
<name>Chris</name>	Chris	Cross	It wasn’t pleasant; hell, no. At first I felt inferior. But now I have to struggle with myself to keep from feeling superior to the people I meet. . . Do you understand what I mean?” “I do,” [MASK] said quietly.
<name>John</name>	John	Lionel	He wanted to lift her from the floor and take her into the bed, but he felt that such would violate her budding trust. “[MASK],” she called in a whisper. “Yes?” She controlled her sobbing and was silent for some moments.
<name>O'Brien</name>	O'Brien	Hilton	“Look, I’ve been in connection with the Party for only twenty-four hours,” he argued. “I’ve worked for [MASK], so far . . . I’d like to set his mind straight. What does he drink I’m after?”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Houston	[MASK] was attempting to bring him repentantly to his knees, trying to rule him through the deep conditioning that all men felt in common for their parents. “No,” he said, the words coming softly from his lips.
<name>Jimmy</name>	Jimmy	Bob	“I’m going to be a professional revolutionary, working twenty-four hours a day beating these rich white bastards. It makes me feel good]” [MASK] went into the kitchen and brought out two bottles of cold beer and, opening them, sat them on the table.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Dot	If she’d only trust me . . . But he knew that her trusting him would not get her what she wanted; he was in no position to marry her. All right; suppose [MASK] was in trouble? Did that justify her subjecting him to shame?
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Hilton	“I don’t know,” he answered her sofdy. “What did [MASK] say?” “He said for us to stay here; he’s on his way over now. He’s phoned the police and the Party.”
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Junior	“Nobody,” she breathed. “Who else saw me come in here?” “Nobody,” she whispered, her eyes widening with understanding. “Look, [MASK]’s coming,” he spoke in a low, rapid voice. “Brace up . . .
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Dot	On his tongue was a storm of reproaches he wanted to hurl at [MASK], but he checked himself. To lose his temper would be playing into her hands, giving her an opportunity to wallow in an emotional scene.
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Menti	“The whole Central Committee is meeting just about you,” [MASK] informed him. “You sure bring trouble. You’ve been in this city just a few days, but wherever you show your face, death’s not far behind ...”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Cross	There was a low rumble of voices in the hallway and then [MASK] saw a slender man of about thirty enter the dining room with his overcoat still on. Flakes of melting snow clung to his hat, and a faint haze of vapor, precipitated by the warm air of the apartment, rose from his clothing.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Hattie	They paused, looked back, all round them, then hailed a taxi and climbed in; the taxi, no doubt at their bidding, shot off wildly down the snow-covered street. “They seemed to be in a hurry,” [MASK] sighed.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Myrtle	A gurgle of water sounded in the kitchen. That pot that [MASK] had told him to look after! He ran and turned out the gas just in time, for there were but a few bubbles left in the pan. The telephone rang.
<name>Hardy</name>	Hardy	Cross	There was a shy fanaticism in the man’s deep, brown eyes, an apologetic inferiority in his demeanor, an ingratiating humility even in the way he talked—all of which hid something that [MASK] could not fathom. What was this man up to?
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Cross	“They had a hot argument, but nobody threatened anybody.” “By the way, let me see your draft card.” [MASK] tendered his draft card; the captain examined it, copied down some information from it and handed it back to him.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Dot	He knew them as women better than they knew him as man. “[MASK], I want to talk to you,” he began. “Are you up to it, or should I come back in the morning?”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Lionel	“Very well,” she muttered. “And why aren’t you going to exhibit again soon?” “Oh, [MASK], I must go,” she said hurriedly, ignoring his question. “Stay and look at them as long as you like . . .
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Menti	“Personally, nothing.” [MASK]’s voice was affable. “What do you think I’m up to?” “I don’t know.” “Have you seen me do anything that would make you suspicious of me?” “No.”
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Cross	[MASK] advanced to the canvas upon which she was c videndy working and which rested upon a huge easel. Between irregular volumes and planes was a feeling of tremendous tension created by points of quiet and steady light, a light that seemed hardly there, yet tying all of her space into one organic whole.
<name>Corley</name>	Corley	Cross	“I don’t give a damn what you heard,” [MASK] muttered. Tiny crystals trembled whitely between their dark faces. The shoulders of their overcoats were laced with icy filigrees; dapples of moisture glowed diamondlike on their eyebrows where the heat of their blood was melting the snow.
<name>him</name>	him	Gil	.’’He paused and rubbed his eyes; then he seemed to remember that he was telling her about what had happened. “Then I hit [MASK]. . . He wasn’t expecting it ... I was mad with them . . . No; not personally mad.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Hilton	“Naw; wait,” [MASK] said, speaking in a vague tone with bated breath, his eyes straying from face to face. “Look, don’t touch anything here . . . Let’s get upstairs!”
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Herndon	Fingerprints on the knob . . . ? No; he would not bother about them. After all, if he made things too clean, the police would get suspicious . . . And he had been down here talking to [MASK] earlier this afternoon . . .
<name>John</name>	John	Cross	Ha-ha-ha,” the man laughed cynically. An “L” train rolled to a stop and [MASK] hurried into it; he had seen and heard enough. He rushed to his rented room and sat at a window overlooking the church entrance.
<name>John</name>	John	Myrtle	She sprang from the bed in her nylon gown and screamed, then ran on bare, scampering feet across the room to the window. He walked toward her, calmly. The door burst open and [MASK] stood staring at them with parted lips and tense eyes.
<name>O'Brien</name>	O'Brien	Cross	Each step he took carried him deeper into a morass of lies and deceit. “The Party feels an obligation,” [MASK] said, trying to make his lie sound genuine. “If you refuse, they’ll wonder what reasons you could have.”
<name>John</name>	John	Cross	He looked at [MASK], smiled, then asked teasingly: “You call this civilization? I don’t. This is a jungle. We pretend that we have law and order. But we don’t, really.
<name>Brother</name>	Brother	Sarah	He was suddenly resentful of the fact that [MASK] had failed to see that he, of his own accord, was about to move. “Is your telling me to move so bluntly your first act of Christian charity?”
<name>Stavrogin</name>	Stavrogin	Cross	The end and the reason are for us to say, to project. That’s all. My wanting to live even in this reasonless way is the only check and guarantee you have that I’ll keep my promise.” “That’s not enough!” [MASK] shouted.
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Blimin	All of the vast dramas which man once thought took place in the skies now transpire in our hearts and we quake and are moved compulsively to do what we know not. . .” “You deliberately and consistendy omit to mention the role of the working class,” [MASK] pointed out, smil- ing.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Gil	“How are you, darling?” “I’m fine,” he lied. She sat at [MASK]’s desk and began sorting papers. “You have no more fever?” “None at all. I’m all right.”
<name>Chigurh</name>	Chigurh	Cross	“Such a killer, if he existed, would have to, for psychological reasons, be akin to both of them, wouldn’t he? At least he’d have to understand them . . “Why?” [MASK] asked, smiling.
<name>John</name>	John	Gladys	He rushed to the front of the car and when it slowed he swung off. As he neared the house his steps faltered. He was doubtful if [MASK] would help him, but his predicament was so knotty that he had to try, whatever the outcome.
<name>George</name>	George	Doc	He fumbled for the bottle and took a deep swallow. Yes; he had to get some sleep or go mad. He went out of the telephone booth and waved good-bye to [MASK] and kept on out of the door and walked along the snow-piled sidewalks.
<name>She</name>	She	Dot	“Are you up to it, or should I come back in the morning?” [MASK] lay without moving. He knew that she was debating. Finally she slowly turned over and faced him, the mass of her tumbling brown tresses framing an oval of face delicate and demure.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Cross	They pushed through the door and went in. [MASK] followed solemnly, his hands dug into his overcoat pockets, a cigarette stub glowing in his lips. He sat with the others in a booth and looked at them with quiet eyes and an enigmatic smile.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Cross	“No answer?” the clerk asked. “But I saw him go up a few minutes ago.” “I’ll try again,” the girl said. “Won’t you wait a second?” the clerk asked [MASK].
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Dot	Yes, he had to see [MASK]. The thought made tension rise in him and he went into a bar and had a double whiskey. When he came out a bluish mist hung in the air and the sun was a faint red ball.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Myrtle	Longing for a drink, he rummaged in the kitchen and found an inch of gin in a bot-de and drained it. The hall door lock clicked and [MASK] entered without glancing at him. Yes; she was in on this too.
<name>Lenin</name>	Lenin	Gil	Long queues of workers were entering the doors and filing slowly past die dark, shining coffin in which [MASK] lay with ashen and upturned face. Huge wreaths of flowers were banked about the coffin which was surrounded by Communist militants standing stiffly at attention.
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	Gil	She was edging away from him; her eyes reflected horror. “But I thought you were against brutality— I thought you were going to tell me what [MASK] had done to you— I thought you hated suffering—” “I do!” he shouted.
<name>Rubashov</name>	Rubashov	Lane	“Could I ask you a direct question?” “Of course.” “[MASK], are you now, direcdy or indirecdy, verbally or organizationally, by proxy or on your own behalf engaged in anti-Party activity?”
<name>Life</name>	Life	Man	Men hate themselves and it makes them hate others ... We must find some way of being good to ourselves . . . [MASK] is all we’ve got... I wish I could ask men to meet themselves . . . We’re different from what we seem . . .
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Gil	“Yes,” [MASK] answered, but not turning or looking at her. “Maybe it’s Herndon— Shall I answer?” she asked in a whisper. “You’re always to answer the door,” he said calmly.
<name>Connell</name>	Connell	Cross	He was rigid a moment, then he turned and strode out of the captain’s office, leaving the door ajar. [MASK] watched his humped back disappear down a dim corridor. He didn’t dare . . . The hunchback had looked right at it and had turned his face away!
