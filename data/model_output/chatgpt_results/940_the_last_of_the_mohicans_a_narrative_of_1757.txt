<name>man</name>	man	Delaware	On the delivery of this solemn judgment, the patriarch seated himself, and closed his eyes again, as if better pleased with the images of his own ripened experience than with the visible objects of the world. Against such a decree there was no [MASK] sufficiently hardy to murmur, much less oppose himself.
<name>him</name>	him	Duncan	The look of innocence and surprise which he received in return convinced [MASK] of the necessity of being more explicit. “This is neither the place nor the occasion to detain you with selfish wishes,” he added; “but what heart loaded like mine would not wish to cast its burden?
<name>I</name>	I	Duncan	The native, like himself, seemed occupied in considering the low dwellings of the village, and the stolen movements of its inhabitants. It was impossible to discover the expression of his features through the grotesque mask of paint under which they were concealed, though [MASK] fancied it was rather melancholy than savage.
<name>Magua</name>	Magua	Hawkeye	Again the same sounds were repeated, evidently proceeding from the mouth of the beast. Once more the eyes of the youth roamed over the interior of the lodge, and returning to the former resting place, he uttered, in a deep, suppressed voice: “[MASK]!”
<name>Hawkeye</name>	Hawkeye	Duncan	At that instant, several loud blows were struck on the water, and [MASK] turned his eyes just in time to perceive that a hundred dark forms were plunging, in a body, into the troubled little sheet. Grasping his rifle his looks were again bent on the Indian near him.
<name>Indians</name>	Indians	Webb	Their deliberations were short, and it would seem, by the silence of most of the party, the decision unanimous. By the frequency with which the few speakers pointed in the direction of the encampment of [MASK], it was apparent they dreaded the approach of danger from that quarter.
<name>Magua</name>	Magua	Uncas	“Has a Huron no ears?” scornfully exclaimed [MASK]; “twice, since he has been your prisoner, has the Delaware heard a gun that he knows. Your young men will never come back!” A short and sullen pause succeeded this bold assertion.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Duncan	[MASK] soon detected their searching, but stolen, looks which, in truth, scanned his person and attire inch by inch; leaving no emotion of the countenance, no gesture, no line of the paint, nor even the fashion of a garment, unheeded, and without comment.
<name>Chingachgook</name>	Chingachgook	Magua	“They will not find the Lenape asleep.” “It is well. The warrior whose eye is open can see his enemy,” said [MASK], once more shifting his ground, when he found himself unable to penetrate the caution of his companion.
<name>Hawkeye</name>	Hawkeye	Chingachgook	At that instant the whoop was given, and a dozen Hurons fell by a discharge from [MASK] and his band. The shout that followed was answered by a single war-cry from the forest, and a yell passed through the air that sounded as if a thousand throats were united in a common effort.
<name>Ichabod</name>	Ichabod	Heyward	said [MASK], apprehensive the unconscious sisters might comprehend the nature of the detention, and conquering his disgust by a train of reflections very much like that of the hunter; “'tis done; and though better it were left undone, cannot be amended.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Heyward	I had her but a single year, though; a short term of happiness for one who had seen her youth fade in hopeless pining.” There was something so commanding in the distress of the old man, that [MASK] did not dare to venture a syllable of consolation.
<name>Chingachgook</name>	Chingachgook	Hawkeye	“Would ye bring certain death upon us, by telling the Mingoes where we lie?” demanded [MASK], sternly; “'Tis a charge of powder saved, and ammunition is as precious now as breath to a worried deer!
<name>Count Dracula</name>	Count Dracula	Heyward	When the eyes of [MASK] first met those of his recent guide, he turned them away in horror at the sinister though calm look he encountered. Conquering his disgust, however, he was able, with an averted face, to address his successful enemy.
<name>Tecumseh</name>	Tecumseh	Hawkeye	Animating his followers by his voice, and his own example, [MASK] then gave the word to bear down upon their foes. The charge, in that rude species of warfare, consisted merely in pushing from cover to cover, nigher to the enemy; and in this maneuver he was instantly and successfully obeyed.
<name>Becky</name>	Becky	Duncan	“Go you, [MASK],” he said; “go with this marquess, as, indeed, marquess he should be; go to his marquee and arrange it all. I have lived to see two things in my old age that never did I expect to behold.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Cora	[MASK] regarded him not, but dropping on her knees, she raised her eyes and stretched her arms toward heaven, saying in a meek and yet confiding voice: “I am thine; do with me as thou seest best!”
<name>Chingachgook</name>	Chingachgook	Uncas	“With what?” coolly demanded the scout. “The arrows of [MASK], or such tears as women shed! No, no; you are young, and rich, and have friends, and at such an age I know it is hard to die!
<name>Chingachgook</name>	Chingachgook	Magua	The other acknowledged the pacific compliment by a gesture of the hand, and remained silent. Then [MASK], as if recalled to such a recollection, by the allusion to the massacre, demanded: “Does my prisoner give trouble to my brothers?”
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Uncas	And yet,” he added, bending his head aside, to catch the sounds of the distant combat, “if we are to be of use to [MASK], these knaves in our front must be got rid of.”
<name>Chingachgook</name>	Chingachgook	Duncan	“They will yet find the Huron a singing-bird,” said [MASK], endeavoring to adopt the figurative language of the natives. “It is good. We will know who can shut the ears of men.
<name>Napoleon</name>	Napoleon	Magua	Their distant villages, their hunting-grounds and hundreds of their women and children, together with a material part of their physical force, were actually within the limits of the French territory. Accordingly, this alarming annunciation was received, as [MASK] intended, with manifest disapprobation, if not with alarm.
<name>Ichabod</name>	Ichabod	David	Then, seizing the hand of the other, he squeezed it with a grip that brought tears into the eyes of the placid [MASK], and wished him joy of his new condition. “You were about opening your throat-practisings among the beavers, were ye?”
<name>Magua</name>	Magua	Magua	The escape was soon known; and the whole tribe crowded, in a body, around the council-lodge, impatiently awaiting the instruction of their chiefs. In such a sudden demand on their wisdom, the presence of the cunning [MASK] could scarcely fail of being needed.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Duncan	The chief himself waved his hand for [MASK] to proceed, saying aloud, in a firm voice, and with a lofty manner: “Go; I am a man, and I will enter the rock and fight the wicked one.”
<name>Hawkeye</name>	Hawkeye	Heyward	Imbibing renewed confidence from the security of these experienced foresters, [MASK] soon imitated their example; and long before the night had turned, they who lay in the bosom of the ruined work, seemed to slumber as heavily as the unconscious multitude whose bones were already beginning to bleach on the surrounding plain.
<name>Chingachgook</name>	Chingachgook	David	Now let us to business.” “First tell me of the maiden, and of the youth who so bravely sought her,” interrupted [MASK]. “Ay, they are happily freed from the tomahawks of these varlets.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Heyward	“God forbid!” exclaimed [MASK]. “Surely we have had enough of bloodshed!” While he spoke, however, the young soldier seized his rifle, and advancing toward the front, prepared to atone for his venial remissness, by freely exposing his life in defense of those he attended.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Alice	[MASK] listened with breathless interest; and though the young man touched lightly on the sorrows of the stricken father; taking care, however, not to wound the self-love of his auditor, the tears ran as freely down the cheeks of the daughter as though she had never wept before.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Cora	Name not the horrid alternative again; the thought itself is worse than a thousand deaths.” “That such would be your answer, I well knew!” exclaimed [MASK], her cheeks flushing, and her dark eyes once more sparkling with the lingering emotions of a woman.
<name>Natty</name>	Natty	Hawkeye	[MASK] started, and dropped his rifle, when, directed by the finger of his companion, the stranger came under his view. Then lowering the dangerous muzzle he stretched forward his long neck, as if to assist a scrutiny that was already intensely keen.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Heyward	they respect the dead, and it has this time saved their own lives, and, it may be, the lives of better men too.” [MASK] lent his attention for a single moment to his companion, but without replying, he again turned toward those who just then interested him more.
<name>Imogen</name>	Imogen	Alice	oh! how surpassingly fair!” laying her own beautiful, but less brilliant, hand in melancholy affection on the alabaster forehead of [MASK], and parting the golden hair which clustered about her brows; “and yet her soul is pure and spotless as her skin!
<name>Tonto</name>	Tonto	Hawkeye	Again the scout and his companions made the circuit of the halting place, each slowly following the other, until they assembled in the center once more, no wiser than when they started. “Such cunning is not without its deviltry,” exclaimed [MASK], when he met the disappointed looks of his assistants.
<name>Chingachgook</name>	Chingachgook	Uncas	returned the scout, dropping his rifle, and turning away like a man who was convinced of his error. “I must leave the buck to your arrow, [MASK], or we may kill a deer for them thieves, the Iroquois, to eat.”
<name>Daniel</name>	Daniel	Hawkeye	Not one of the three appeared in the least to doubt their perfect security, as was indicated by the preparations that were soon made to sit in council over their future proceedings. The confusion of nations, and even of tribes, to which [MASK] alluded, existed at that period in the fullest force.
<name>Mr. Croup</name>	Mr. Croup	David	The suddenness and the nature of the surprise had nearly proved too much for--we will not say the philosophy--but for the pitch and resolution of [MASK]. He fumbled for his pitch-pipe, and arose with a confused intention of attempting a musical exorcism.
<name>Professor</name>	Professor	Munro	[MASK], instead of demanding the result of the young man's mission, paced the room for a few moments, with his hands behind his back, and his head inclined toward the floor, like a man lost in thought.
<name>He</name>	He	David	The meter is common, and the tune 'Southwell'.” Then, extending the little volume, and giving the pitch of the air anew with considerate attention, [MASK] recommenced and finished his strains, with a fixedness of manner that it was not easy to interrupt.
<name>Chingachgook</name>	Chingachgook	Uncas	If however, they take your scalp, as I trust and believe they will not, depend on it, [MASK] and I will not forget the deed, but revenge it as becomes true warriors and trusty friends.” “Hold!”
<name>Elliot</name>	Elliot	David	As minute after minute passed by, leaving them in undisturbed security, the insinuating feeling of hope was gradually gaining possession of every bosom, though each one felt reluctant to give utterance to expectations that the next moment might so fearfully destroy. [MASK] alone formed an exception to these varying emotions.
<name>Hawkeye</name>	Hawkeye	Heyward	In that moment of surprise, the self-possession of [MASK] did not desert him. He observed by the vacant expression of the Indian's countenance, that his eye, accustomed to the open air had not yet been able to penetrate the dusky light which pervaded the depth of the cavern.
<name>Uncas</name>	Uncas	David	But when [MASK], unconscious of being observed, turned his head, and exposed his simple, mild countenance, in place of the haughty lineaments of their prisoner, it would have exceeded the credulity of even a native to have doubted any longer.
<name>Chingachgook</name>	Chingachgook	Magua	“They ask for the hunter who knows the paths through the woods,” returned [MASK], in his broken English, laying his hand, at the same time, with a ferocious smile, on the bundle of leaves with which a wound on his own shoulder was bandaged.
<name>Laurence</name>	Laurence	Duncan	I hear a more unworthy conjunction of execution and language than that to which I have been listening; and I was far gone in a learned inquiry into the causes of such an unfitness between sound and sense, when you broke the charm of my musings by that bass of yours, [MASK]!”
<name>Magua</name>	Magua	Alice	At first he relinquished his hold of [MASK]; then he caught up a thong of buckskin, which had been used around some bundle, and when he beheld his enemy with his two arms pinned to his side by the iron muscles of the scout, he rushed upon him, and effectually secured them there.
<name>Chingachgook</name>	Chingachgook	Menowgua	Then suddenly lifting his voice to a pitch of terrific energy, he concluded by demanding: “Are the Hurons dogs to bear this? Who shall say to the wife of [MASK] that the fishes have his scalp, and that his nation have not taken revenge!
<name>John Willoughby</name>	John Willoughby	Hawkeye	The presence of the latter created so many unexpected hopes relative to the sisters that, without a moment's hesitation, the young man broke out of his ambush, and sprang forward to join the two principal actors in the scene. The merriment of [MASK] was not easily appeased.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Alice	[MASK] trembled violently, and there was an instant during which she bent her face aside, yielding to the emotions common to her sex; but they quickly passed away, leaving her mistress of her deportment, if not of her affections.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Heyward	“We are likely to have a good day for a fight,” he said, in English, addressing [MASK], and glancing his eyes upward at the clouds, which began to move in broad sheets across the firmament; “a bright sun and a glittering barrel are no friends to true sight.
<name>Uncas</name>	Uncas	Duncan	He seized the highly prized jewel; and as he proclaimed the fact, it vanished from the eyes of the wondering scout, who in vain looked for it on the ground, long after it was warmly pressed against the beating heart of [MASK].
<name>Chingachgook</name>	Chingachgook	Magua	“Some the Great Spirit made with skins brighter and redder than yonder sun,” continued [MASK], pointing impressively upward to the lurid luminary, which was struggling through the misty atmosphere of the horizon; “and these did He fashion to His own mind.
<name>man</name>	man	Yengee	Then will they go on happy; and our children will say, 'So did our fathers to their friends, so must we do to them.' What is a [MASK]? we have slain many, but the earth is still pale.
<name>Job</name>	Job	Huron	Then, [MASK], take thine own and depart.” On the delivery of this solemn judgment, the patriarch seated himself, and closed his eyes again, as if better pleased with the images of his own ripened experience than with the visible objects of the world.
<name>James Fenimore Cooper</name>	James Fenimore Cooper	Hawkeye	But it was not the policy of [MASK] to affect the least concealment. Presuming on his disguise, and his ability to sustain the character he had assumed, he took the most plain and direct route to the place.
<name>Lucie</name>	Lucie	Cora	[MASK] had cast herself to her knees; and, with hands clenched in each other and pressed upon her bosom, she remained like a beauteous and breathing model of her sex, looking up in his faded but majestic countenance, with a species of holy reverence.
<name>speaker</name>	speaker	Duncan	Tis from a fire; but one that, in my judgment, has been suffered to burn low.” “Let us, then, push for the place, and relieve our doubts,” said the impatient [MASK]; “the party must be small that can lie on such a bit of land.”
<name>Magua</name>	Magua	Chingachgook	One little knot of Hurons, however, had disdained to seek a cover, and were retiring, like lions at bay, slowly and sullenly up the acclivity which [MASK] and his band had just deserted, to mingle more closely in the fray.
<name>Chingachgook</name>	Chingachgook	Hawkeye	“Can any here give a name to such a cry?” demanded [MASK], when the last echo was lost in the woods; “if so, let him speak; for myself, I judge it not to belong to 'arth!”
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Duncan	Though for that matter, major, you are none of the most inviting yourself in your paint.” [MASK], who had already swung eagerly forward, drew instantly back on hearing these discouraging words. “Am I, then, so very revolting?”
<name>Heyward</name>	Heyward	Uncas	“Now let the devils strike our scent!” said the scout, tearing two rifles, with all their attendant accouterments, from beneath a bush, and flourishing “killdeer” as he handed [MASK] his weapon; “two, at least, will find it to their deaths.”
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Heyward	While the words were still on the lips of [MASK], there had arisen such a tumult of yells and cries as served to drive the swift currents of his own blood back from its bounding course into the fountains of his heart.
<name>Ismael</name>	Ismael	Heyward	“Cannot we make a circuit to avoid the danger,” asked [MASK], “and come into our path again when it is passed?” “Who that once bends from the line of his march in a fog can tell when or how to find it again!
<name>Tamenund</name>	Tamenund	Montcalm	“Let us go to [MASK], and demand admission: he dare not deny a child the boon.” “You would scarce find the tent of the Frenchman with the hair on your head”; said the blunt scout.
<name>Hiawatha</name>	Hiawatha	Chingachgook	The manual rites then ceased and all present reverted to the more spiritual part of the ceremonies. [MASK] became once more the object of the common attention. He had not yet spoken, and something consolatory and instructive was expected from so renowned a chief on an occasion of such interest.
<name>Isaac</name>	Isaac	Heyward	[MASK] would gladly have heard more, but a gentle push from his friend urged him toward the door, and admonished him of the danger that might attend the discovery of their intercourse. Slowly and reluctantly yielding to the necessity, he quitted the place, and mingled with the throng that hovered nigh.
<name>Tamenund</name>	Tamenund	Hawkeye	The awakened spirit of the young soldier gleamed in his eyes, and his form became imposing under its influence. [MASK], though too much accustomed to Indian artifices not to foresee the danger of the experiment, knew not well how to combat this sudden resolution.
<name>Gabriel</name>	Gabriel	Uncas	Still no discovery was made. At length [MASK], whose activity had enabled him to achieve his portion of the task the soonest, raked the earth across the turbid little rill which ran from the spring, and diverted its course into another channel.
<name>Uncas</name>	Uncas	Cora	Let the daughter of the English chief follow, and live in his wigwam forever.” However revolting a proposal of such a character might prove to [MASK], she retained, notwithstanding her powerful disgust, sufficient self-command to reply, without betraying the weakness.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	David	It was profusely strewed with the plunder of that unlucky fortress. In the midst of this confusion he found her he sought, pale, anxious and terrified, but lovely. [MASK] had prepared her for such a visit.
<name>Hawkeye</name>	Hawkeye	Heyward	To [MASK] this was a moment of feverish and impatient suspense; though the scout saw fit to select it as a fit occasion to read a lecture to his more youthful associates on the art of using firearms with discretion.
<name>Uncas</name>	Uncas	Heyward	His proposal was received with acclamations, and executed with the swiftness of thought. Two powerful warriors cast themselves on [MASK], while another was occupied in securing the less active singing-master. Neither of the captives, however, submitted without a desperate, though fruitless, struggle.
<name>Hawkeye</name>	Hawkeye	Uncas	“There goes [MASK]!” said the scout; “the boy bears a smart piece! I know its crack, as well as a father knows the language of his child, for I carried the gun myself until a better offered.” “What can this mean?
<name>Montcalm</name>	Montcalm	Munro	The news had been brought, toward the decline of a day in midsummer, by an Indian runner, who also bore an urgent request from [MASK], the commander of a work on the shore of the “holy lake,” for a speedy and powerful reinforcement.
<name>Magua</name>	Magua	Magua	“Monster! there is blood, oceans of blood, upon thy soul; thy spirit has moved this scene.” “[MASK] is a great chief!” returned the exulting savage, “will the dark-hair go to his tribe?” “Never!
<name>solitude</name>	solitude	Hawkeye	The rocky island and the two caverns are known to every traveler, since the former sustains the pier of a bridge, which is now thrown across the river, immediately above the fall. In explanation of the taste of [MASK], it should be remembered that men always prize that most which is least enjoyed.
<name>him</name>	him	Heyward	They encountered, grappled, and fell to the earth together. The naked body of his antagonist afforded [MASK] no means of holding his adversary, who glided from his grasp, and rose again with one knee on his chest, pressing him down with the weight of a giant.
<name>Burgoyne</name>	Burgoyne	Montcalm	Just as the day dawned, they entered the narrows of the lake*, and stole swiftly and cautiously among their numberless little islands. It was by this road that [MASK] had retired with his army, and the adventurers knew not
<name>Father Paneloux</name>	Father Paneloux	David	“It may be so,” said [MASK]; “but I have seen strange and fantastic images drawn in their paint, of which their admiration and care savored of spiritual pride; especially one, and that, too, a foul and loathsome object.”
<name>Uncas</name>	Uncas	Heyward	On the contrary, [MASK] thought the manner of the young Mohican was disdainful, if not a little fierce, and that he suppressed passions that were ready to explode, as much in compliment to the listeners, as from the deference he usually paid to his white associate.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Cora	To you, [MASK], I will urge no words of idle encouragement; your own fortitude and undisturbed reason will teach you all that may become your sex; but cannot we dry the tears of that trembling weeper on your bosom?”
<name>Tecumseh</name>	Tecumseh	Huron	[MASK], I love you not; nor can I say that any Mingo has ever received much favor at my hands. It is fair to conclude that, if this war does not soon end, many more of your warriors will meet me in the woods.
<name>Hiawatha</name>	Hiawatha	Manitou	In the heavens, oh, I see many clouds.” “In the woods, in the air, oh, I hear the whoop, the long yell, and the cry: In the woods, oh, I hear the loud whoop!” “[MASK]!
<name>Natty</name>	Natty	Heyward	Those curious and admiring eyes which had been turned again on [MASK], were finally directed to the weather-beaten form of the scout, who immediately became the principal object of attention to the simple and unsophisticated beings by whom he was surrounded.
<name>Corporal</name>	Corporal	Uncas	Put on the skin; I doubt not you can play the bear nearly as well as myself.” Whatever might have been the private opinion of [MASK] of their respective abilities in this particular, his grave countenance manifested no opinion of his superiority.
<name>Hawkeye</name>	Hawkeye	Hawkeye	As [MASK] and the Mohicans had, however, often traversed the mountains and valleys of this vast wilderness, they did not hesitate to plunge into its depth, with the freedom of men accustomed to its privations and difficulties.
<name>someone</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	someone (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	Duncan	After uttering the usual words of greeting, he turned to [MASK], and continued, with a smile of recognition, speaking always in French: “I am rejoiced, monsieur, that you have given us the pleasure of your company on this occasion.
<name>Indian</name>	Indian	Indian	And the fellow will drink when he can get an opportunity; your drinking [MASK] always learns to walk with a wider toe than the natural savage, it being the gift of a drunkard to straddle, whether of white or red skin. 'Tis just the length and breadth, too!
<name>Crazy Horse</name>	Crazy Horse	Uncas	[MASK] moved with a slow and dignified tread toward the post, which he immediately commenced encircling with a measured step, not unlike an ancient dance, raising his voice, at the same time, in the wild and irregular chant of his war song.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Hawkeye	said [MASK], bending to catch a glimpse of the direction, and then instantly moving onward. Cries, oaths, voices calling to each other, and the reports of muskets, were now quick and incessant, and, apparently, on every side of them.
<name>Hiawatha</name>	Hiawatha	Magua	When [MASK] reached the cluster of lolling savages, who, gorged with their disgusting meal, lay stretched on the earth in brutal indulgence, he commenced speaking with the dignity of an Indian chief. The first syllables he uttered had the effect to cause his listeners to raise themselves in attitudes of respectful attention.
<name>Magua</name>	Magua	Magua	An unwilling maiden makes an unhappy wigwam.” “She speaks with the tongue of her people,” returned [MASK], regarding his victim with a look of bitter irony. “She is of a race of traders, and will bargain for a bright look.
<name>Magua</name>	Magua	Duncan	But while [MASK] resorted to these words of consolation to quiet the apprehensions of the sisters, he was not so weak as to deceive himself. He well knew that the authority of an Indian chief was so little conventional, that it was oftener maintained by physical superiority than by any moral supremacy he might possess.
<name>no one</name>	no one	David	Though the rock, the trees, and the shrubs, were cut and torn in a hundred places around the besieged, their cover was so close, and so rigidly maintained, that, as yet, [MASK] had been the only sufferer in their little band.
<name>Uncas</name>	Uncas	Heyward	The sound of approaching footsteps were now too distinctly audible to leave any doubts as to the nature of the interruption. They were soon mingled with voices calling to each other in an Indian dialect, which the hunter, in a whisper, affirmed to [MASK] was the language of the Hurons.
<name>Huron</name>	Huron	Delawares	“Now let it be proved, in the face of this tribe of [MASK], which is the better man,” cried the scout, tapping the butt of his piece with that finger which had pulled so many fatal triggers.
<name>Edgar</name>	Edgar	Alice	It was followed by a stillness apparently as deep as if the waters had been checked in their furious progress, at such a horrid and unusual interruption. “What is it?” murmured [MASK], after a few moments of terrible suspense. “What is it?”
<name>Hawkeye</name>	Hawkeye	Hawkeye	“These devils will scale heaven to circumvent us to our ruin,” said [MASK]; “keep him in play, boy, until I can bring 'killdeer' to bear, when we will try his metal on each side of the tree at once.”
<name>Hawkeye</name>	Hawkeye	Hawkeye	[MASK] dropped the breech of his rifle to the earth, and drawing a long, free breath, exclaimed, in an audible whisper: “Ay! they respect the dead, and it has this time saved their own lives, and, it may be, the lives of better men too.”
<name>Heyward</name>	Heyward	David	[MASK] gazed about him, at the fierce and wild-looking chiefs, in mute wonder; but assured by the presence of faces that he knew, he soon rallied his faculties so far as to make an intelligent reply.
