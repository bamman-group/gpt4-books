<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Tara	Usually the mother did not take exercise. She either sat up at the card table, playing, or lay very still on her bed, with a suffering face tilted upwards in warning so that [MASK] did not dare approach. Even now she kept her distance.
<name>Prue</name>	Prue	Tara	Some of the sand had been flung into their eyes. They were all rubbing at the grains. [MASK] jumped up and down on her toes, watching them still. ‘And his dog,’ she cried. ‘See the lovely dog running after the horse.’
<name>Rusty</name>	Rusty	Tara	Then [MASK] breathed ‘Bim, we’re right next to the well,’ and instinctively they moved closer to each other in order to face together what was such a source of horror to them all and definitely out of bounds as well.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Baba	Nor did she seem to think it necessary to speak to or be spoken to by [MASK]. She said, ‘Look at her. You’d think I had given her enough but no, if we take any ourselves, she feels it’s come out of her share.’
<name>Raman</name>	Raman	Bim	And her white sari crackled with starch, like a biscuit. And her hair gleamed with coconut oil, and flecks of gold glinted at the lobes of her ears and in the ringed folds of her neck. Altogether a piece of confectionery, thought [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bim	They stood watching, waiting for him to obey. He made protesting sounds, turned around in circles, pawed [MASK]’s feet with his claws, even whined a bit under his breath. Finally he yawned in resignation and sank onto his haunches.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Tara	‘Come on,’ she hissed sharply at [MASK] who then came scurrying and squealing after her. They tumbled down the stairs into the garden together, then the blank white glare and the brazen heat made them blink and falter.
<name>Ratan</name>	Ratan	Baba	Out in the garden a koel called its wild, brazen call. It was not answered so it repeated the call, more demandingly. For a while [MASK] paced about the room, his head hanging so low that one would have thought it unnatural, physically impossible.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Raja	She strutted about the room, feeling the cigarettes and matches in her pocket, realizing now why [MASK] walked with that fine, careless swagger. If she had pockets, if she had cigarettes, then it was only natural to swagger, to feel rich and superior and powerful.
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Bim	‘Music is one of the greatest joys we can have on earth. If one has that pleasure, then one can bear almost anything in life.’ [MASK] at last paid him the little attention that he craved. ‘Yes?’ she asked in slow surprise.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Baba	Once, when he had ventured out, a bicycle had dashed against him as he stood hesitating at the edge of the road, wondering whether to cross. The bicyclist had fallen and cursed him, his voice rising to a shrill peak and then breaking on [MASK]’s head like eggs, or slivers of glass.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Bim	‘And here I am - too ill to even get up and help. And the only time in my life that I’ve ever been ill,’ he added bitterly. [MASK] was quiet, floating the sponge back and forth in the bowl with wrinkled, frozen fingertips.
<name>Stoner</name>	Stoner	Raja	That’s not what [MASK] had wanted from life. He doesn’t need a hobby, he needs a vocation. He knows he has given his up, just given up what used to be his vocation, turned it into a silly, laughable little hobby . . .
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Bim	When she lowered his head, he shrank into a heap, shivering, and she stayed a while, smoothing his hair and patting his cheek till she thought he was quieter, nearly asleep, then went to find [MASK].
<name>Hercule</name>	Hercule	Baba	‘Let’s go and look in the servants’ quarters - there may be someone there.’ But [MASK] would not go. He stood there Angering the smooth shining metal gadgetry in the green box, his long fingers closing about the curved silver horn, admiringly, lovingly.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bim	She had one bite to nurse, on her knuckles, but although the sting was still embedded in it like a needle in a pocket, she dared not ask for any attention or sympathy - she knew [MASK] deserved it all.
<name>Yoko</name>	Yoko	Bim	‘Are you tired, [MASK]-ma»'?’ they laughed at her. ‘Aren’t you awake yet? What have you been doing all night? Your room looks like a storm’s been through it.’ ‘Tired? Not awake?’
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Bim	and he let go of the chair and spread out his arms as if to push everything out of his way. [MASK] tried to stay calm. She merely tapped her pencil against her teeth and found it better not to look at his face - she had not suspected it capable of such ugliness.
<name>McAlmon</name>	McAlmon	Mulk	It was only whisky pouring out of an overturned glass and [MASK] struggling to get out of the canvas chair, too tight for his heavy frame. As they all stopped talking to stare at him, he gestured widely and shouted dramatically, ‘Where is my toh/a-player?
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Bim	Now the engagement book lay at the bottom of her trunk. [MASK] had said nothing of engagements and, really, she could not bear to have any in this heat. The day stretched out like a sheet of glass that reflected the sun - too bare, too exposed to be faced.
<name>James</name>	James	Bakul	That’s what I’m really looking forward to - a few quiet weeks while [MASK] does all the travelling. The girls will love it.’ The cat sprang up in protest and fled. The girls rocked with laughter. ‘Do they love quiet times?’
<name>Shelley</name>	Shelley	Raja	To cover up a confusion she failed to resolve, she said ‘Yes, and d’you remember [MASK] marching up and down here on the roof, swinging his arms and reciting his poems to us while we sat here on the balustrade, swinging our legs and listening?
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Bim	‘Oh, [MASK],’ she said distractedly, ‘won’t you get me your father’s brandy bottle from the sideboard? A drop - just a drop in my tea -1 do need it - it might help - it isn’t safe . . .’
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Mulk	[MASK] was chaffing him now, teasing him, but the old man, resting the palms of his hands on his knees and leaning forwards, did not smile or in any way respond. He seemed to be having trouble with his teeth which were false and did not fit.
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Bim	‘It’s making you worse,’ [MASK] cried angrily, mopping his face with a sponge and going to get a change of nightshirt for him. ‘How will you get better if you keep worrying about fighting in the streets? What fighting in the streets?’
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Bim	‘Yes?’ said [MASK] with scorn, turning around to stare at her sister. ‘I don’t think so. I don’t think it is unnecessary to take offence when you are insulted. What was he trying to say to me?
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Bim	She opened her mouth to drink. She whimpered for that drink. The tea party was of course a mistake and [MASK] scowled and cursed herself for having softened and let herself in for what was a humiliation and a disaster for everyone concerned.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Raja	‘That is what I am going in for, father,’ [MASK] said steadily, somehow managing to imply his pride in his unusual choice, and his steadfastness, and his scorn for this vague old man who could not understand. ‘Rubbish,’ said his father flatly.
<name>Priscilla</name>	Priscilla	Bim	[MASK] was calmly unaware of any of her sister’s agonies, past or present. ‘Only I was not at any extremity like those explorers in the icy wastes who used to see ghost figures,’ she continued. ‘I was not frozen or hungry or mad.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Bim	Look, you’ve smashed another bulb. D’you think they belong to your father that you can go smashing them up as you like?’ [MASK] gave a snort of disgust. ‘I don’t know why they’re in such a hurry to get married,’ she said.
<name>Parvez</name>	Parvez	Bim	‘None of the Muslim girls come any more. ’ ‘Her parents must be afraid to send her out of the house. I wish I could go and see her. ’ ‘Go and see her?’ [MASK] repeated, puzzled. ‘Why?’
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Bim	[MASK] did not notice her. She was looking down, across the lighted, bustling garden to her own house, dark and smouldering with a few dim lights behind the trees, and raised her hands to her hair, lifting it up and letting it fall with a luxuriant, abundant motion.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Tara	The children fondled her pink, opaque ears that let in the light and glowed shell-pink in the sun. [MASK] laid her face against the folds of her neck, milky white and warm. She smelt sweetly of straw, and cud. She was housed in a shed.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Bim	‘What makes you think that?’ asked [MASK] in wonder, and her sister’s expression which was rather as if a tooth were being extracted from her mouth very slowly, made her take off her spectacles and hold them in her hand so that they could face each other directly-
<name>Camilla</name>	Camilla	Bim	But if I turned my head very quickly - then she would vanish - just disappear into the hedge -’ and [MASK] touched it again, to remember, and had the back of her hand scratched by a thorn and heard some small creature skitter away into the leaves.
<name>Raju</name>	Raju	Donkey	‘They’re getting married afterwards anyway.’ The Misra boy standing below shouted ‘[MASK]! Fool! Look, you’ve smashed another bulb. D’you think they belong to your father that you can go smashing them up as you like?’
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Tara	She had left, with her bags, without a word, without a goodbye to a single girl, not even to [MASK] who stood at the open door of her room, holding the bunch of pansies with their wide-eyed step-child faces.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Tara	They had such very sarcastic tongues and always seemed to single out [MASK], as if sensing her distaste and disapproval, for their sharpest tongue-lashings. The other girls, instead of siding with her against the enemy, tittered and smirked to see her scolded and have her homework flung at her in rage.
<name>Mirza</name>	Mirza	Bim	[MASK] had to admit that he had learnt his craft well. He had acquired a surprising command over the craft of writing Urdu verse. He had learnt his lessons in metre, rhyme and rhythm and acquitted himself well. But would he like her still to keep them?
<name>She</name>	She	Bim	When she wakes up, give her this much,’ and he got up stiffly, brought out a bottle from his bag and poured some into a tumbler. [MASK] gasped at the amount and began to protest but he said ‘She must have it.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bim	He knew her. He left her, saying ‘Then I’ll tell Uncle you are busy with your own family and will come another time,’ and went out to wait for the car. He passed [MASK] as he went through the drawing room.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Tara	Once again, she felt with a certain bitterness, what a strain [MASK]’s visit had been, what it had cost her by constantly dragging her apart into love and hostility, resentment and acceptance, forgiveness and hate.
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Bim	[MASK] was holding her head in both her hands, shaking it slowly from side to side. ‘That’s my trouble,’ she mumbled. ‘I do foresee all these terrible things. I see them all,’ she said, closing her eyes, as if tired, or in pain.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Baba	It had reached its peak, its acme, like a great glittering wave that had hovered over everyone and that now collapsed, fell on the sand and seeped away, leaving nothing but a soggy shadow in the shape of [MASK]’s silence.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Bim	‘You’re making fun of me now,’ said [MASK], finding her way back to her aunt-self, her aunt-persona. ‘Come along, come out to the veranda - I want some light - I want my tea.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Tara	In fact, he was still in training. He did not really know what was to be done. Still, he did like everyone to think he did. So he sat down again beside [MASK] and picked up her hand and squeezed it lightly.
<name>Salim</name>	Salim	Baba	The cook had gone out to market. She tilted the earthen water jar to fill a tumbler and hurried back with it, her legs cutting into her nightgown and the water spilling in splashes onto the tiles as she hurried, thinking of [MASK]’s face.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bakul	‘What, haven’t they made up that quarrel yet?’ [MASK] asked in a bored voice. Really, the house had an atmosphere - a chilling one, like a cemetery. ‘I can’t even remember what it was about - it was so long ago.’
<name>Velutha</name>	Velutha	Sala	Suar! [MASK]! Suar ka bachcha!’ All the time his arm rose up in the air and came down, cutting and slashing the horse’s flesh till black stuff oozed onto the white dust and ran and spread, black and thick, out of the horse.
<name>Esteban</name>	Esteban	Baba	They sat together in the dusty, darkened room, running their fingers through their hair with a twin gesture of distracted contemplation, and listened to [MASK]’s record ‘The Donkey Serenade’ trotting in endless circles and the parrots quarrelling over the ripe guavas in the garden.
<name>God</name>	God	Bim	A part of her twitched, stirred like a fin in resentment: why was the pond so muddy and stagnant? Why had nothing changed? She had changed - why did it not keep up with her? Why did [MASK] allow nothing to change?
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Bakul	Elegantly holding his cigarette in its holder at arm's length, [MASK] told them in his ripest, roundest tones, ‘What I feel is my duty, my vocation, when I am abroad, is to be my country’s ambassador.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bim	‘Yes, but how can you bear them jingling so?’ [MASK] asked querulously, pressing her hand to her head. The electric fan creaked and complained over their heads for want of an oiling. A gecko on the wall let loose a series of clucked warnings.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Bim	[MASK] slapped the tabletop with her hand, loudly. ‘You see,’ she said, in triumph, ‘what did I tell you? He may be a grown man, respectable citizen, father of a family and all that — but what is he still trying to do, to be?
<name>Uma</name>	Uma	Jaya	They were sitting - wordlessly and expressionlessly - inside this great bubble of light when a black smudge beetle-like entered it at its circumference and came crawling up the drive, in the shade of a white cotton sari, for it was only [MASK].
<name>Ernest</name>	Ernest	Baba	‘Are you, [MASK]?’ He glanced at her very quickly, with a kind of pleading, and then looked away and shook his head very slightly. This made her cry out ‘But don’t you go to the office in the mornings?’
<name>Hamid</name>	Hamid	Raja	A dog barked in the Hyder Alis’ garden. That was all. It was nothing. One day, less than nothing. ‘The house seems empty,’ she told [MASK] bluntly as she came down. ‘I think they’ve gone.’
<name>Beethoven</name>	Beethoven	Mulk	Am I to kick him out of the house and flog him down the road to the office? And look at [MASK] - our great musician - all he does is wave his hand in the air and look at the stars in the daytime sky, and sing.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bakul	‘I didn’t think of it that way then,’ she said seriously. ‘At that time I was just - just swept off my feet,’ she giggled a bit. ‘[MASK] was so much older, and so impressive, wasn’t he?
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Tara	Then the sisters’ heads drew closer still to [MASK], their voices dropped an octave, and they murmured, one from the left and one from the right, ‘But how much longer can you keep your girls abroad? Mustn’t they come home to marry now?’
<name>Now</name>	Now	Tara	‘And she seemed contented, too, didn’t she?’ ‘Contented?’ he asked. ‘Contented enough,’ he answered. ‘No more and no less than most of us.’ Now [MASK] was not satisfied.
<name>Rukmani</name>	Rukmani	Bim	The old ayah shook her head over such inefficacious treatment and fetched her betel-nut box and dipped her finger into the jar of lime paste and smeared it on [MASK]’s stings till she looked as if she had dabs of cotton wool stuck to her, or a strange, erratic growth of feathers.
<name>Shyam</name>	Shyam	Bim	‘They could have been taken away - dragged out and taken away -’ ‘Of course not’ [MASK] snapped. ‘In that case, we would all have come to know, all the neighbours would have heard.
<name>End</name>	End	Bunkum	‘Rubbish,’ said his father flatly. ‘[MASK],’ he said, using one of his favourite phrases, and tore the form in two before marching off to his room. It was a stormy summer.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Raja	‘He could have picked up a germ while drinking tea from a dirty cup, from using a soiled towel somewhere. Anywhere. But it is t.b.,’ he insisted in the face of her incredulity. [MASK], too, was incredulous. He felt ill.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Bim	She felt [MASK]’s hold on her again - that rough, strong, sure grasp - dragging her down, down into a well of oppression, of lethargy, of ennui. She felt the waters of her childhood closing over her head again - black and scummy as in the well at the back.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Tara	‘Why, because they might find marriage isn’t enough to last them the whole of their lives,’ she said darkly, mysteriously. ‘What else could there be?’ countered [MASK]. ‘I mean,’ she fumbled, ‘for them.’
<name>Rhoda</name>	Rhoda	Bim	‘Oh, to going on - to growing up - leaving - going away - into the world - something wider, freer-brighter,’ [MASK] laughed. ‘Brighter! Brighter!’ she called, shading her eyes against the brightness.
<name>Polynesia</name>	Polynesia	Tara	The queen said to her pet parrot. Go to the king and tell him I want the red ruby that the king cobra keeps hidden under its hood . . and [MASK], who believed ardently in jewels, gave a wriggle of pleasure.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Bim	It’s written all over your face. Just go, go. take your face away. Don’t sit there staring. Don’t stop me.’ ‘I won’t stop you.’ ‘I’m going.’ ‘Go,’ said [MASK].
<name>Lucien</name>	Lucien	Bakul	No one feels the atmosphere more keenly - or catches all the nuances, all the insinuations in the air - or notes those details that escape elders because their senses have atrophied, or calcified.’ [MASK] gave an uncomfortable laugh.
<name>Luz</name>	Luz	Tara	and, before [MASK]’s startled eyes, a bicycle with a small painted van attached to it that had been rolling down the empty, blazing road, stopped and turned in at the gate with its Sikh driver beaming broadly at the laughing girls and their professor.
<name>Myra</name>	Myra	Bim	‘Amusing isn’t exactly the word, but interesting - interesting enough.’ He sucked at his cigarette, regarding her, his eyes openly admiring her. Suddenly he took the cigarette from his lips and exclaimed ‘[MASK], why do you have grey hair already?
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Bim	Then [MASK]’s mind seemed stilled at last. A silence settled upon it as a shroud that is drawn up over the dead. Laying her open book across her chest, she lay with her eyes closed, repeating the emperor’s last words to herself like a prayer.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Benazir	They walked down the tiled passages, opening frosted glass-paned doors to the left and right, peering in, half-expecting to And someone left behind - perhaps an old sick aunt with embroidery spools heaped on her lap and fluttering a ghostly fan, or the kittens [MASK] used to play with and cuddle.
<name>Fluffy</name>	Fluffy	Tara	[MASK] was still the baby of the family. She did not know her days were numbered, that she was soon to lose all her privileges and be removed to a distance, disregarded, as another made its appearance into their lives.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bimla	He sank back, sighing ‘Nothing, nothing, [MASK], my daughter, it is only old age. Just fate and old age and none of us escapes from either. You won’t. You don’t know, you don’t think-and then suddenly it is there, it has come.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bakul	It seemed so incredible that she hadn’t had to go anywhere to find it, that she had stayed on here in the old house, taught in the old college, and yet it had given her everything she wanted. Isn’t that strange, [MASK]?’
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Bim	‘Young?’ said [MASK] wonderingly, and as they were now near the veranda, she sank down on the steps where the quisqualis creeper threw its bunches of inky shadow on the white-washed steps, and sat there hugging her knees.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Bim	So she huddled inside her kimono and tore at her hair, trying to get on with the letter. It would not go. She laid down the pen. Suddenly coming to a decision that pinched her nostrils and made her look almost severe, she said ‘[MASK], you must come.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bim	He handed [MASK] the letter to share the joy of it with her. She sat on the edge of his bed, reading, and laughing with relief, relief as much for his sake as for theirs. It seemed the evening light that came in that day was softer, milder, not so lurid.
<name>Prudence</name>	Prudence	Tara	[MASK] was doubled over with laughter, stuffing her hands into her mouth, and crying tears of laughter to see the preposterous figure of her sister in the bunched up old khaki trousers over her flowered frock, with her black hair tumbling about her hot, excited face.
<name>Geoffrey</name>	Geoffrey	Bakul	Much travelled, brought up in embassies, fluent in several languages, they were far too sophisticated for such rustic pleasures, she knew, and felt guilty over her own lack of that desirable quality. She had fooled [MASK] into believing that she had acquired it, that he had shown her how to acquire it.
<name>Mildred</name>	Mildred	Bim	The driver, after waiting a while as if in expectation of the car being returned to him, finally got to his feet and began to help the gardener by mending his hose pipe and oiling his shears while [MASK] wondered what to do.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Tara	It seemed to [MASK] that there had been far more roses in it when she was a child - luscious shaggy pink ones, small crisp white ones tinged with green, silky yellow ones that smelt of tea - and not just these small negligible crimson heads that lolled weakly on their thin stems.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Tara	[MASK] did not see, kept her fingers pressed into her eyes till blue and red stars burst out of them, but she was aware that blood had been spilt and washed over her feet, warm and thick and living.
<name>Timothy</name>	Timothy	Baba	[MASK]’s head wagged in agreement and, when she had stalked out of the room, continued to wag as if he could not stop. Then the record ran down and he put out his hand to wind it up again.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bim	‘I mean,’ she fumbled, ‘for them.’ ‘What else?’ asked [MASK]. ‘Can’t you think? I can think of hundreds of things to do instead. I won’t marry,’ she added, very firmly.
<name>Lata</name>	Lata	Bim	But [MASK] would not listen. The last time she had accepted an invitation to ‘pot luck’ she had been distressed to see the two Misra sisters halving and sharing a chapati between them, and jars of pickles had had to be opened to make up for the lack of meat and vegetables.
<name>John</name>	John	Raja	At first she thought it might be someone planning a burglary. She watched while [MASK] dozed. When he woke, she told him. He realised at once that his terrorist friends had warned the police that he was a Muslim sympathiser.
<name>Camilla</name>	Camilla	Tara	She would have liked to wave [MASK] away, to be alone to mutter to herself, make gestures, groan aloud and behave like the solitary old woman she was, not as a sister or an aunt. ‘Haven’t you to pack?’
<name>Bahrain</name>	Bahrain	Hyderabad	They were visiting too, as if they were pashas, with presents to dazzle us with. He brought me a string of pearls -imagine, pearls! - and told me how [MASK] was known for them. And I just told him “
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Raja	Would it not sink? Would it not be better to jettison everything, to lighten the bark and go free, with ease? ‘Many were around me when I was born but now I am going alone. ’ But they were [MASK]’s papers, not hers.
<name>Ratib</name>	Ratib	Bakul	‘[MASK]-b/iat, tell me,’ said the older brother, rolling the ice cubes around in his glass, ‘as a diplomat in an Indian embassy, how do you explain the situation to foreigners?
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Tara	‘No, don’t worry him,’ she said sharply. ‘I don’t like you having all the worries of the family.’ ‘You are lessening them, aren’t you, by taking [MASK] off my hands?’ ‘Will I?
<name>Emer</name>	Emer	Bim	‘I’ll have to buy you a bottle of Blacko for your hair, [MASK],’ he teased. ‘I won’t have you coming grey-haired to my wedding. Can’t have such an elderly sister-in-law, I can’t.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Tara	Imagine eating so much!’ ‘Why do you imagine they eat all day?’ cried [MASK] in distress. ‘I know. They did visit me once. Have you forgotten? After their marriage, after their first baby was born, they did come to visit us.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bim	he chuckled and now his head wobbled on his neck as if something had come loose. ‘Much worse than any of them,’ he repeated with desperate pride. [MASK], red-faced in the dark shadows, let down her feet cautiously and searched for her slippers.
<name>He</name>	He	Bakul	She felt she had followed him enough, it had been such an enormous strain, always pushing against her grain, it had drained her of too much strength, now she could only collapse, inevitably collapse. [MASK] had married her when she was eighteen.
<name>Raman</name>	Raman	Bimla	and so I came back with money and no discipline and no degree,’ he laughed, deliberately spilling some more soda water as if in a gesture of fatalism. ‘What, all to satisfy a swamiT ‘Yes, yes, it is true, [MASK].
