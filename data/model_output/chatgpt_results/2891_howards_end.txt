<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Charles	"It's all right!" he called. "It wasn't a dog, it was a cat." "There!" exclaimed [MASK] triumphantly. "It's only a rotten cat. "Got room in your car for a little un?
<name>Benjamin</name>	Benjamin	Leonard	Don't drag in the personal when it will not come. Forget him." "Yes, yes, but what has [MASK] got out of life?" "Perhaps an adventure." "Is that enough?" "Not for us. But for him."
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Margaret	We shan't be there very long, either." "You, too, on the move?" "Next September," [MASK] sighed. "Every one moving! Good-bye." The tide had begun to ebb.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Margaret	" "I can diagnose the case more bluntly if you wish," he retorted. "You could, but you have not. You are, therefore, not qualified to attend my sister." "Come, come, [MASK]!"
<name>Stratton</name>	Stratton	Margaret	So when the concert was over and [MASK] said, "We live quite near; I am going there now. Could you walk around with me, and we'll find your umbrella?" he said, "Thank you," peaceably, and followed her out of the Queen's Hall.
<name>Shelby</name>	Shelby	Jacky	Teeth of dazzling whiteness extended along either of [MASK]'s jaws, and positively weighted her head sideways, so large were they and so numerous. Take my word for it, that smile was simply stunning, and it is only you
<name>Mrs. Bates</name>	Mrs. Bates	Margaret	The chauffeur could not travel as quickly as he had hoped, for the Great North Road was full of Easter traffic. But he went quite quick enough for [MASK], a poor-spirited creature, who had chickens and children on the brain.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Charles	my new car's been driven!" "Has it, sir?" "Yes," said [MASK], getting rather red; "and whoever's driven it hasn't cleaned it properly, for there's mud on the axle. Take it off."
<name>Miss Marple</name>	Miss Marple	Margaret	"As I have actually been forgiven--?" "Never mind for the moment what I mean by that," said [MASK]. "Answer my question." Perhaps some hint of her meaning did dawn on him. If so, he blotted it out.
<name>Jareth</name>	Jareth	Beethoven	Panic and emptiness! Panic and emptiness! The goblins were right. Her brother raised his finger: it was the transitional passage on the drum. For, as if things were going too far, [MASK] took hold of the goblins and made them do what he wanted.
<name>God</name>	God	Chinese	Having helped himself, he put it down to warm in the hearth. His hand stretched towards the Grammar, and soon he was turning over the pages, raising his eyebrows scornfully, perhaps at human nature, perhaps at [MASK].
<name>John</name>	John	Helen	" they shouted, long before she could possibly hear. [MASK] ran down to meet her. The highroad passed over a saddle, and a track went thence at right angles along the ridge of the down. "Have you got the house?"
<name>My</name>	My	Tibby	" "I shall miss the Four Serious Songs if I do." "[MASK] love, you must go." "It isn't of any consequence," said the young man, in truth a little uneasy about his umbrella. "But of course it is.
<name>the Duchess</name>	the Duchess	Charles	"We don't want any more mess." "Who's 'we'?" asked his father. "My boy, pray, who's 'we'?" "I am sure I beg your pardon," said [MASK].
<name>George</name>	George	Charles	"That woman means mischief," thought [MASK], and compressed his lips. In a few minutes he followed her indoors, as the ground was getting damp. Mists were rising from the river, and presently it became invisible, though it whispered more loudly.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Decidedly	And he'll have to get another place!" "Will have? Let him leave the ship before it sinks. Let him get one now." "Rather than wait, to make sure?" "[MASK]." "Why's that?"
<name>Mrs. Dalloway</name>	Mrs. Dalloway	Parliament	[MASK], the Thames, the irresponsive chauffeur, would flash into the field of house-hunting, and all demand some comment or response. It is impossible to see modern life steadily and see it whole, and she had chosen to see it whole.
<name>them</name>	them	Helen	I shall do what I can for [MASK], but on the understanding that they clear out of the house at once. Do you see? That is a sine qua non." "Then at eight tomorrow I may go up in the car?"
<name>Mr. Wilcox</name>	Mr. Wilcox	Henry	There was something uncanny in her triumph. She, who had never expected to conquer anyone, had charged straight through these Wilcoxes and broken up their lives. "In consequence, I leave my wife no money," said [MASK]. "That is her own wish.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Charles	[MASK] was depressed. That woman had a tongue. She would bring worse disgrace on his father before she had done with them. He strolled out on to the castle mound to think the matter over. The evening was exquisite.
<name>Lily</name>	Lily	Margaret	[MASK] went to the kitchen, and struggled between packing-cases to the window. Their visitor was only a little boy with a tin can. And triviality returned. "Little boy, what do you want?" "Please, I am the milk."
<name>the man</name>	the man	Henry	It need not take the form of a good "talking." By quiet indications the bridge would be built and span their lives with beauty. But she failed. For there was one quality in [MASK] for which she was never prepared, however much she reminded herself of it: his obtuseness.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Margaret	"At all events, you mustn't worry," he said. "This is a man's business." He thought intently. "On no account mention it to anybody." [MASK] flushed at advice so elementary, but he was really paving the way for a lie.
<name>he</name>	he	Love	Yet his impact deluges a hundred shores. No doubt the disturbance is really the spirit of the generations, welcoming the new generation, and chafing against the ultimate Fate, who holds all the seas in the palm of her hand. But [MASK] cannot understand this.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Margaret	"Was it townees?" he asked, greeting her with a pleasant smile. "You'll never believe me," said [MASK], sitting down beside him. "It's all right now, but it was my sister."
<name>Rachel</name>	Rachel	Margaret	It pleased [MASK] to hear her brother and sister talking. They did not get on overwell as a rule. For a few moments she listened to them, feeling elderly and benign. Then something occurred to her, and she interrupted: "
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Charles	[MASK] had never been in such a position before. It was a woman in revolt who was hobbling away from him, and the sight was too strange to leave any room for anger. He recovered himself when the others caught them up: their sort he understood.
<name>Irene</name>	Irene	Helen	He built up a situation that was far enough from the truth. It never occurred to him that [MASK] was to blame. He forgot the intensity of their talk, the charm that had been lent him by sincerity, the magic of Oniton under darkness and of the whispering river.
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Helen	Make light of the whole thing." [MASK] came and behaved with a cheerfulness that reassured their visitor--this hen at all events was fancy-free. "He's gone with my blessing," she cried, "and now for puppies."
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Henry	"You might have given me a knock with the gate," was another of his remarks. Presently she heard herself speaking. She, or someone for her, said "Go away." [MASK] came nearer.
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Margaret	She looked at the sorrel, and the red and white and yellow clover, and the quaker grass, and the daisies, and the bents that composed it. She raised it to her face. "Is it sweetening yet?" asked [MASK]. "
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Margaret	"I am glad to have seen you and the things." She looked at the bookcase lovingly, as if she was saying farewell to the past. [MASK] unbolted the door. She remarked: "The car has gone, and here's your cab."
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Wagner	He treats music as music, and oh, my goodness! He makes me angrier than anyone, simply furious. With him I daren't even argue." An unhappy family, if talented. "But, of course, the real villain is [MASK].
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Margaret	He seemed unsatisfied, and said: "So you wouldn't give me your word that you DON'T hold with astral bodies and all the rest of it?" "I could," said [MASK], surprised that the point was of any importance to him.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Charles	She fell on her knees, cut her gloves, shook her hat over her ear. Cries of alarm followed her. "You've hurt yourself," exclaimed [MASK], jumping after her. "Of course I've hurt myself!" she retorted. "
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Margaret	"But you can give that up now." "Er--no," said [MASK], after a moment's thought. "Oh, that'll be all right. I'll speak to her." "This visit is a high solemnity.
<name>Miss Prism</name>	Miss Prism	Helen	As she spoke, the door was flung open, and [MASK] burst in in a state of extreme excitement. "Oh, my dears, what do you think? You'll never guess. A woman's been here asking me for her husband. Her WHAT?"
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Charles	[MASK] saw them in, civil to the last, and in a moment the offices of the Imperial and West African Rubber Company faded away. But it was not an impressive drive. Perhaps the weather was to blame, being grey and banked high with weary clouds.
<name>he</name>	he	Charles	Even the Bible--the Dutch Bible that [MASK] had brought back from the Boer War--fell into position. Such a room admitted loot. "Now the entrance-hall." The entrance-hall was paved. "Here we fellows smoke."
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Hen	"I can't congratulate you on your proteges," he remarked. "[MASK], don't go. You do love me, dear, don't you?" "Bless us, what a person!"
<name>Mr. Collins</name>	Mr. Collins	Henry	The house was insignificant, but the prospect from it would be an eternal joy, and she thought of all the friends she would have to stop in it, and of the conversion of [MASK] himself to a rural life.
<name>Beatrice</name>	Beatrice	Meg	He says the most horrid things about women's suffrage so nicely, and when I said I believed in equality he just folded his arms and gave me such a setting down as I've never had. [MASK], shall we ever learn to talk less?
<name>The Lady</name>	The Lady	Margaret	he asked. "She's out," was the answer. "When will she be back?" "I'll ask," said the parlourmaid. [MASK] had given instructions that no one who mentioned her name should ever be rebuffed.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Margaret	And it was here that [MASK] hoped to help him. It did not seem so difficult. She need trouble him with no gift of her own. She would only point out the salvation that was latent in his own soul, and in the soul of every man.
<name>them</name>	them	Helen	I understand it, but most good people would think you mad. Imagine how disconcerting for [MASK]! What is wanted is a person who will go slowly, slowly in this business, and see how things are and where they are likely to lead to."
<name>the child</name>	the child	Tom	They're going to be lifelong friends." "Starting at the ages of six and one?" "Of course. It will be a great thing for [MASK]." "It may be a greater thing for baby."
<name>someone</name>	someone	Helen	Most important. How old would the son be? She says 'younger son.' Would he be in a position to marry? Is he likely to make [MASK] happy? Did you gather--" "I gathered nothing." They began to talk at once.
<name>Oscar</name>	Oscar	Tibby	First of all the street lamps, then the trees, and towards morning it got cloudy." [MASK], who preferred his comedy undiluted, slipped from the room. He knew that this fellow would never attain to poetry, and did not want to hear him trying.
<name>the other person</name>	the other person	Helen	His sympathy lacks poetry, and so isn't sympathy really. I'd even say"--she looked at the shining lagoons--"that, spiritually, he's not as honest as I am. Doesn't that satisfy you?" "No, it doesn't," said [MASK].
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Auntie	The servants need seeing to at the farm. [MASK] is so odd at times." Gathering up her elegancies, she retired defeated, and, as if her departure had loosed a spring, the front door opened at once.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Margaret	She exaggerated the Punch and Judy aspect of life, and spoke of mankind as puppets, whom an invisible showman twitches into love and war. [MASK] pointed out that if she dwelt on this she, too, would eliminate the personal.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Mounting	A reticent fellow, he made no reply. [MASK] by her side, he put on gloves and spectacles, and off they drove, the bearded porter--life is a mysterious business--looking after them with admiration.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Dolly	She read the card with annoyance. It was covered with instructions in domestic French. When she and her sister had talked she was to come back for the night to [MASK]'s. "Il faut dormir sur ce sujet."
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Helen	[MASK] was amused. She opened the gate on to the downs so that her brother might lead the pony through. "It's just like a widower," she remarked. "They've cheek enough for anything, and invariably select one of their first wife's friends."
<name>Tess</name>	Tess	Margaret	The room was a little dark and airless; they were obliged to keep it like this until the carting of the hay. [MASK] joined the family without speaking; the five of them had met already at tea, and she knew quite well what was going to be said.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Margaret	Were both these loud-voiced parties right? On one occasion they had met, and [MASK] with clasped hands had implored them to argue the subject out in her presence. Whereat they blushed, and began to talk about the weather.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Henry	She was ashamed of her own diplomacy. In dealing with a Wilcox, how tempting it was to lapse from comradeship, and to give him the kind of woman that he desired! [MASK] took the hint at once, and said: "Why later on?
<name>Lily</name>	Lily	Henry	"[MASK] would resent so strong a grasp of the situation. She must not comment; comment is unfeminine. "I think that'll about do," she thought. Then the sense of his degradation choked her. Was he worth all this bother?
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Margaret	Stunned, [MASK] did not move from the best parlour, over which the touch of art nouveau had fallen. But the other rooms looked in keeping, though they conveyed the peculiar sadness of a rural interior. Here had lived an elder race, to which we look back with disquietude.
<name>Judy</name>	Judy	Margaret	"You don't know what you want yourselves," said [MASK], folding her arms. "For one sensible remark I will let you in. But you cannot make it. You would trouble my sister for no reason. I will not permit it.
<name>away</name>	away	Charles	"How much have you a year? I've six hundred." "My income?" "Yes. We must begin with how much you have, before we can settle how much you can give [MASK]. Justice, and even generosity, depend on that."
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Margaret	It's better like this." "Why better?" asked [MASK]. "No, it is better not to risk a second interview. I shall always look back on this talk with you as one of the finest things in my life. Really.
<name>Aunt Pittypat</name>	Aunt Pittypat	Tibby	Men don't know what we want--" "And never will." "I don't agree. In two thousand years they'll know." "But the chairs show up wonderfully. Look where [MASK] spilt the soup." "Coffee.
<name>Leonard</name>	Leonard	Paul	She was parting from these Wilcoxes for the second time. [MASK] and his mother, ripple and great wave, had flowed into her life and ebbed out of it for ever. The ripple had left no traces behind: the wave had strewn at her feet fragments torn from the unknown.
<name>She</name>	She	Evie	"Sounds a most original entertainment!" he exclaimed, and laughed in his pleasant way. "I wish [MASK] would go to that sort of thing. But she hasn't the time. She's taken to breed Aberdeen terriers--jolly little dogs.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Helen	"We shan't consult him." "Go if you like; I should have stopped without leave." It was the touch of selfishness, which was not enough to mar [MASK]'s character, and even added to its beauty.
<name>Enkidu</name>	Enkidu	Prospero	Perhaps the whole visible world rests on it, and if they were one, life itself, like the spirits when [MASK] was reconciled to his brother, might vanish into air, into thin air. "Your protege has made us late," said he.
<name>Mr. Wilcox</name>	Mr. Wilcox	Paul	She intends to diminish her income by half during the next ten years; she intends when she dies to leave the house to her--to her nephew, down in the field. Is all that clear? Does every one understand?" [MASK] rose to his feet.
<name>outsiders</name>	outsiders	Society	In a long letter she pointed out the need of charity in sexual matters: so little is known about them; it is hard enough for those who are personally touched to judge; then how futile must be the verdict of [MASK].
<name>Mr. Bingley</name>	Mr. Bingley	Margaret	we're worth. We're costing these ladies pounds and pounds already to get work for us, and they never will. There's nothing we're good enough to do." "We would like to find you work," said [MASK] rather conventionally.
<name>Elvira</name>	Elvira	Helen	"No; look out for the part where you think you have done with the goblins and they come back," breathed [MASK], as the music started with a goblin walking quietly over the universe, from end to end. Others followed him.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Helen	And went into a bank instead?" "I told you all that," said [MASK]; "and they reduced their staff after he had been in a month, and now he's penniless, and I consider that we and our informant are directly to blame."
<name>Mr. Wilcox</name>	Mr. Wilcox	Leonard	They moved to a long table behind which a servant was still standing. Iced cakes, sandwiches innumerable, coffee, claret-cup, champagne, remained almost intact: their overfed guests could do no more. [MASK] refused.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Helen	"I don't agree there, my dear! [MASK] will have her share of the goods wherever she goes--possibly more than her share, for you are so fond of her that you'd give her anything of yours that she fancies, wouldn't you?
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Charles	The motor, loaded with refugees, continued to travel very slowly down the hill. "The men are there," chorused the others. "Men will see to it." "The men CAN'T see to it. Oh, this is ridiculous! [MASK], I ask you to stop."
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Charles	[MASK], vexed both with his father and his wife, then repeated: "The question is--" He had cleared a space of the breakfast-table from plates and knives, so that he could draw patterns on the tablecloth.
<name>Mrs. Gummidge</name>	Mrs. Gummidge	Evie	He rose to his feet and looked out of the window, for [MASK] had come in with the letters, and he could meet no one's eye. Ah yes--she had been a good woman--she had been steady. He chose the word deliberately.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Margaret	" "I mean reasonable comforts, of course. I shouldn't like to think that you--" He bent nearer; the sentence died unfinished. [MASK]'s head turned very stupid, and the inside of it seemed to revolve like the beacon in a lighthouse.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Charles	[MASK] took no notice. The motor, loaded with refugees, continued to travel very slowly down the hill. "The men are there," chorused the others. "Men will see to it." "The men CAN'T see to it.
<name>Louisa</name>	Louisa	Helen	Then she would have kissed her sister, but [MASK], in a dignified voice, that came strangely from her, said: "Convenient! You did not tell me that the books were unpacked. I have found nearly everything that I want.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Leonard	"I tempted him, and killed him and it is surely the least I can do. I would like to throw out all my heart to [MASK] on such an afternoon as this. But I cannot. It is no good pretending. I am forgetting him."
<name>the father</name>	the father	Charles	He found his father in the garden shading his eyes from the sun. "It has been pretty horrible," said [MASK] gravely. "They were there, and they had the man up there with them too." "What--what man?"
<name>Albert</name>	Albert	Margaret	"If that is so," said [MASK], "if I have happened to be of use to you, which I didn't know, you cannot pay me back with anything tangible." " I suppose not, but one would like to.
<name>Judy</name>	Judy	Paul	Without their spirit life might never have moved out of protoplasm. More and more do I refuse to draw my income and sneer at those who guarantee it. There are times when it seems to me--" "And to me, and to all women. So one kissed [MASK]."
<name>Aunt Ada Doom</name>	Aunt Ada Doom	Dolly	She got twice or three times into the nursing home. Presumably she is awaiting developments." "What a horrid woman!" And [MASK], who had recovered, cried, "Why, she may be coming down to turn us out now!"
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Henry	He would settle down--though she could not realize this. In her eyes [MASK] was always moving and causing others to move, until the ends of the earth met. But in time he must get too tired to move, and settle down. What next?
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Henry	"[MASK] dear, look at me. No, I won't have you shirking. Look at me. There. That's all." "You're referring to last evening," he said huskily. "I have released you from your engagement.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Helen	The father is in the Indian army--retired; the brother is in the army. The mother is dead." So perhaps these were the "chinless sunburnt men" whom [MASK] had espied one afternoon through the window.
<name>Beryl</name>	Beryl	Margaret	"It isn't meant as a compliment, my dear. I just won't have you going about in the dark. Such people about too! It's dangerous. " "Can't I look after myself? I do wish--" "Come along, [MASK]; no wheedling."
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Margaret	That's the type of thing. I like this place, for a joke, once in a way. It is so thoroughly Old English. Don't you agree?" "Yes," said [MASK], who didn't.
<name>Will Ladislaw</name>	Will Ladislaw	Henry	In spite of imagination and poetry--perhaps on account of them--she could sympathize with the technical attitude that [MASK] would adopt. If possible, she would be technical, too. A night's lodging--and they demanded no more--need not involve the discussion of general principles.
<name>cooking</name>	cooking	Araby	But the servants were so new that they did not know one another's names. In the still-room sat the band, who had stipulated for champagne as part of their fee, and who were already drinking beer. Scents of [MASK] came from the kitchen, mingled with cries.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Jacky	"That's what I am, [MASK]. I don't take any heed of what anyone says. I just go straight forward, I do. That's always been my way. I'm not one of your weak knock-kneed chaps.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Helen	She said: "But we would still see each other very often, and--" "It's not a thing like that," sobbed [MASK]. And she broke right away and wandered distractedly upwards, stretching her hands towards the view and crying.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tibby	Just as another house that I can mention, but I won't, sounded irrevocably masculine, and all its inmates can do is to see that it isn't brutal." "That house being the W.'s house, I presume," said [MASK].
<name>James</name>	James	Tibby	At lunch her brother, seeing her inclined for silence, insisted on talking. [MASK] was not ill-natured, but from babyhood something drove him to do the unwelcome and the unexpected. Now he gave her a long account of the day-school that he sometimes patronized.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Henry	I am so very glad about it, [MASK] dear; I only hope that the guests at ours may be half as comfortable. You must all remember that we have no practical person among us, except my aunt, and she is not used to entertainments on a large scale."
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Beethoven	Panic and emptiness! Panic and emptiness! Even the flaming ramparts of the world might fall. [MASK] chose to make all right in the end. He built the ramparts up. He blew with his mouth for the second time, and again the goblins were scattered.
<name>Lily</name>	Lily	Helen	For the second time that day she saw the appearance of the earth. There were the greengage-trees that [MASK] had once described, there the tennis lawn, there the hedge that would be glorious with dog-roses in June, but the vision now was of black and palest green.
<name>his brother</name>	his brother	Charles	"That time may prove," murmured [MASK]. "How?" asked his sister. "Presumably she knows--mother will have told her. She got twice or three times into the nursing home. Presumably she is awaiting developments." "What a horrid woman!"
