<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Luke	“The doctor—” “Nonsense,” the doctor said heartily. “You certainly wouldn’t think of asking me, an older man; anyway, you know she adores you.” “Insolent graybeard,” [MASK] said. “Sacrificing me for a cup of coffee.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Theodora	“The rooms are exactly alike.” Green dimity curtains hung over the windows in [MASK]’s room, the wallpaper was decked with green garlands, the bedspread and quilt were green, the marble-topped dresser and the huge wardrobe were the same.
<name>She</name>	She	Theodora	Make a note of it, my dear, and try to describe it exacdy.” [MASK] was puzzled. She stood in the hallway, turning, looking back of her at the staircase and then around again at the front door. “Are there two front doors?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Luke	“Please, sir,” [MASK] was saying meekly, “who is planchette?” The doctor sighed irritably. “Imbeciles,” he said, and then, “Sorry. The whole idea annoys me, but if she likes it . . .”
<name>Lord Peter Wimsey</name>	Lord Peter Wimsey	Luke	“It’s worse if you try not to show it,” the doctor said. “Stuff yourself very full of kippers,” [MASK] said. “Then it will be impossible to feel anything at all.”
<name>Mrs. Ramsey</name>	Mrs. Ramsey	Theodora	“You couldn’t get them back on the right shelves anyway, and she’d have to do it all over again just to get your fingermarks off things.” “If I just took the silverware and let it soak—” “No,” [MASK] said, catching her hand.
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Theodora	She began to pull at the tight knot she had put in the bathrobe cord, and said, “Intense cold is one of the symptoms of shock.” “Intense shock is one of the symptoms I’ve got,” [MASK] said.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Temptation	“Influences prevailing, you know. Older influences hanging around,” he explained more fully. “It sounds very much like broken vows, does it not? Very much.” “Had a lot of that back then, you know. [MASK], probably.”
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Theodora	[MASK] wheeled one of the big stone vases from the corner of the hall, and they stood it in the doorway and rested the door against it. The fading sunlight outside was bright after the darkness of the house, and the air was fresh and sweet.
<name>Justice</name>	Justice	Theodora	Not hearing the startled voices behind her, not seeing where or how she went, she blundered somehow to the great front door and out into the soft warm night. “I had to come,” she said to the world outside. Fear and guilt are sisters; [MASK] caught her on the lawn.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Luke	Many women, on the other hand, find a beard distasteful. A clean-shaven man—you’ll excuse me, my boy—never looks fully dressed, my wife tells me.” He held out his glass to [MASK].
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Arthur	“You’ve been here nearly a week and I suppose you’ve done nothing with planchette? Automatic writing? I don’t imagine either of these young women has mediumistic gifts? Those are [MASK]’s bags right there. He brought his golf clubs, just in case.”
<name>Hugh</name>	Hugh	Eleanor	“And waiting,” [MASK] said. “And waiting,” the doctor confirmed. “Essentially,” he went on slowly, “the evil is the house itself, I think. It has enchained and destroyed its people and their lives, it is a place of contained ill will.
<name>Dr. Robinson</name>	Dr. Robinson	Luke	“She wasn’t any more frightened than I was; we scared each other to death over a rabbit.” “Horrible creatures, rabbits,” [MASK] said. The doctor laughed. “I suppose we were all nervous this afternoon, anyway.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Eleanor	“—cannot tell you how sorry I am,” he was saying. “If there is ever anything I can do . . [MASK] laughed. “But I can’t leave,” she said, wondering where to find words to explain.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Theodora	“I am horrible,” [MASK] said, good-humored again. “I’m horrible and beasdy and no one can stand me. There. Now tell me about yourself.” “I’m horrible and beastly and no one can stand me.”
<name>Peter</name>	Peter	Arthur	Solemnly they watched [MASK] go down onto his hands and knees and look under the beds and then rise, dusting his hands. “Perfectly safe,” he said. “Now, where am I to be?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Luke	“You know what I want to do?” [MASK] said. “I want to explore. Let’s follow the brook up into the hills and see where it comes from; maybe there’s a pond somewhere and we can go swimming.”
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Eleanor	[MASK] moved the car slowly, but the alacrity with which he leaped to the side of the road made her think for a minute that he had perceived the fleeting impulse crossing her mind; she laughed, and then stopped the car because he was coming toward her—safely, from the side.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Theodora	A most suitable spot, certainly; more suitable for suicides I would think, than for books. She is supposed to have tied the rope onto the iron railing and then just stepped—” “Thanks,” [MASK] said from within.
<name>but I</name>	but I	Eleanor	He does not name it, [MASK] noticed. “I’ve been waiting for a long time,” he said. “You think we are right to stay?” “Right?” he said. “I think we are all incredibly silly to stay.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Luke	“I guess I don’t, really.” She lingered to look uneasily at the table, at the crumpled napkins and the drop of wine spilled by [MASK]’s place, and shook her head. “I don’t know what my mother would say, though.”
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Theodora	She backed away, overwhelmed with the cold air of mold and earth which rushed at her. “My mother—” she said, not knowing what she wanted to tell them, and pressed herself against the wall. “Indeed?” said the doctor, regarding her widr interest. “[MASK]?”
<name>him</name>	him	Luke	Grant that [MASK] take me at my worth, she thought, or at least let me not see the difference. Let him be wise, or let me be blind; don’t let me, she hoped concretely, don’t let me know too surely what he thinks of me.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Luke	You won’t believe me,” [MASK] said, the brandy decanter rattling against the glass as he tried to pour, “but I no longer think of it as a pun. That is what living in a haunted house does for a sense of humor.”
<name>Shakespeare</name>	Shakespeare	Richardson	If any of you has trouble sleeping, I will read aloud to you. I never yet knew anyone who could not fall asleep with [MASK] being read aloud to him.” Talking quiedy, he led them down the narrow hallway and through the great front hall and to the stairs.
<name>Mrs. Danvers</name>	Mrs. Danvers	Luke	“I’ll have to lead you upstairs,” the doctor said. “Tomorrow we must really start to learn our way around. [MASK], will you screen the fire?” “Had we better make sure that the doors are locked?”
<name>the doctor</name>	the doctor	Eleanor	I cannot perch for long on anything here; I skid,” he said confidentially to [MASK]. “Tomorrow,” the doctor said. “Tomorrow, as a matter of fact, we will explore the entire house and arrange things to please ourselves.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Theodora	“At the nursery door; don’t.” And he put out a hand to stop the doctor. “Purest love,” [MASK] said madly, “purest love.” And she began to giggle again.
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Luke	“How would one reckon success, exactly, in an affair like this?” [MASK] inquired curiously. The doctor laughed. “Put it, then,” he said, “that I hope that all of us will have an exciting visit and my book will rock my colleagues back on their heels.
<name>Aslan</name>	Aslan	Eleanor	[MASK] leaned down and held out a hand to help her up. “We’d really better hurry back,” she said and, because she did not herself understand her compelling anxiety, added, “The others might be there by now.”
<name>the Count</name>	the Count	Luke	He smiled in the firelight. “A pilgrim. A wanderer.” “Truly a congenial little group,” [MASK] said approvingly. “Destined to be inseparable friends, in fact. A courtesan, a pilgrim, a princess, and a bullfighter.
<name>he</name>	he	Luke	The table was set for four, with a lavish display of candles and damask and heavy silver. “No stinting, I see,” [MASK] said, taking up a fork with a gesture which would have confirmed his aunt’s worst suspicions.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Luke	Their separate stares, captured forever in distorted laughter, met and locked at the point of the hall where the vicious cold centered. “When you stand where they can look at you,” [MASK] explained, “they freeze you.”
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Theodora	“We’ll have to come back here for a picnic soon,” [MASK] said, following carefully up the path, which went steadily uphill. “We really must have a good old-fashioned picnic down by the brook.”
<name>Louise</name>	Louise	Theodora	“In my mother’s house the kitchen was dark and narrow, and nothing you cooked there ever had any taste or color.” “What about your own kitchen?” [MASK] asked absendy. “In your little apartment?
<name>Mrs. Wix</name>	Mrs. Wix	Theodora	“Too much vermouth,” the doctor said, and followed them lingeringly, watching the nursery door over his shoulder. 5 “I propose,” the doctor said, setting down his napkin, “that we take our coffee in our little parlor. I find that fire very cheerful.” [MASK] giggled.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Nell	“You never know what you are going to want until you see it clearly,” he said. “If I never had a chance of owning it I might feel very differently. What do people really want with each other, as [MASK] asked me once; what use are other people?”
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Luke	“After five,” [MASK] said. “Cocktail time. I suppose,” he said to the doctor, “you will trust me to mix you a cocktail again tonight?” “Too much vermouth,” the doctor said, and followed them lingeringly, watching the nursery door over his shoulder.
<name>Marion</name>	Marion	Eleanor	“An exquisite refinement, exquisite. Because of course the chalk strokes would have been almost unbearable, excruciating, if the victim were ticklish.” I hate her, [MASK] thought, she sickens me; she is all washed and clean and wearing my red sweater.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Arthur	[MASK], let that young man help you to asparagus.” “My dear.” The doctor looked fondly upon his wife. “It has become our custom to rest for an hour or so after lunch; if you—” “Certainly not.
<name>Mrs. Ramsay</name>	Mrs. Ramsay	Murmur	“I never had a mother,” he said, and the shock was enormous. Is that all he thinks of me, his estimate of what I want to hear of him; will I enlarge this into a confidence making me worthy of great confidences? Shall I sigh? [MASK]?
<name>Miss Giddens</name>	Miss Giddens	Arthur	“It is such a blessing,” she said once, “to know that the beings in this house are only waiting for an opportunity to tell their stories and free themselves from the burden of their sorrow. Now. [MASK] will first of all inspect the bedrooms.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Luke	Behind her she could hear the gentle sound of chessmen being set down on a board and the comfortable small movements of [MASK] and the doctor taking each other’s measure, and in the fire there were points of flame and little stirrings.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Eleanor	[MASK] looked at her feet again. “It’s wicked,” she said inadequately. “I mean—on my feet. It makes me feel like I look like a fool.” “You’ve got foolishness and wickedness somehow mixed up.”
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Theodora	“I hate writing these notes; I feel like a damn fool trying to write this crazy stuff.” “I’ve been wondering.” “Well?” [MASK] smiled a little. “You look so serious,” she said.
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	Eleanor	“The library,” he said. “In the tower.” “I can’t go in there,” [MASK] said, surprising herself, but she could not. She backed away, overwhelmed with the cold air of mold and earth which rushed at her.
<name>Uncle Axel</name>	Uncle Axel	Arthur	“Get a bad hat now and then,” [MASK] said, shaking his head. “No taste for sports, you know. Moping in corners. Crybabies. Knock that out of them fast enough.” He reached for the butter.
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Theodora	After a minute, nearly asleep, she felt the odd cold little touch of the brush on her toes, and shivered. “Surely a famous courtesan like yourself is accustomed to the ministrations of handmaidens,” [MASK] said. “Your feet are dirty.”
<name>Mrs. Danvers</name>	Mrs. Danvers	Eleanor	“Maybe you wrote it yourself.” Angry, [MASK] almost shouted. “You think I want to see my name scribbled all over this foul house? You think I like the idea that I’m the center of attention?
<name>Lady Windermere</name>	Lady Windermere	Eleanor	I am, in private life—assuming that this is public life and the rest of the world is actually private—let me see, a bullfighter. Yes. A bullfighter.” “I love my love with a B,” [MASK] said in spite of herself, “because he is bearded.”
<name>Louise</name>	Louise	Eleanor	“Did I make a fool of myself? It’s probably because I’m tired.” “Not at all,” the doctor said, still grave. “Drink your brandy.” “Brandy?” And [MASK] looked down, realizing that she held a brandy glass.
<name>Miss Marple</name>	Miss Marple	Theodora	“Delightful old body.” [MASK] turned, regarding her room. “I take it back, that about the best hotels,” she said. “It’s a little bit like a boarding school I went to for a while.”
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Eleanor	“Go away, go away, don’t hurt me,” and, after, sobbing, “Please don’t hurt me. Please let me go home,” and then the little sad crying again. I can’t stand it, [MASK] thought concretely.
<name>Marion</name>	Marion	Eleanor	“It was a picnic,” [MASK] said. She had fallen into a kitchen chair and she looked down at her hands, scratched and bleeding and shaking without her knowledge. “We tried to get out,” she told them, holding her hands out for them to see.
<name>her</name>	her	Eleanor	Her fingers trembled around the stem of her glass, and then she said, “That was the neighbors. My mother said the neighbors did that. People are always jealous.” “Perhaps so.” The doctor spoke quietly and smiled at [MASK].
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Theodora	My brother still hates me.” “I fell down during the graduation procession.” “I forgot my lines in the operetta.” “I used to write poetry.” “Yes,” [MASK] said, “I’m positive we’re cousins.”
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Luke	[MASK] sat in a chair by the window; his face was bruised and his shirt was torn, and he was still drinking brandy. The doctor sat back in another chair; his hair freshly combed, looking neat and dapper and self-possessed.
<name>the doctor</name>	the doctor	Luke	“Good-by.” “Drive carefully,” [MASK] said politely. “You can’t just make me go,” she said wildly. “You brought me here.” “And I am sending you away,” the doctor said.
<name>Theo</name>	Theo	Arthur	“Not much to do around here, is there?” [MASK] said. “How d’you pass the time generally?” “Working,” the doctor said shortly. “You writing down what happens in die house?” “Yes.”
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Eleanor	“[MASK],” the doctor called, “can you turn around and start down slowly?” Above her was only the little trapdoor leading out onto the turret; she stood on the little narrow platform at the top and pressed against the trapdoor, but it would not move.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Eleanor	“Are you awake? May I come in?” “Come, of course,” [MASK] said, looking at her own face in the mirror. You deserve it, she told herself, you have spent your life earning it.
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Luke	But when I am afraid I no longer exist in any relation to these things. I suppose because things are not afraid.” “I think we are only afraid of ourselves,” the doctor said slowly. “No,” [MASK] said.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Theodora	She realized that she was clutching at the doorknob and, under [MASK]’s quizzical eye, unclenched her fingers and walked steadily across the room. “We’ll have to find some way of opening these windows,” she said.
<name>Mr. Osborn</name>	Mr. Osborn	Theodora	“And take notes,” [MASK] murmured. “Notes. Yes, indeed. Notes. However, I realize that it is most impractical to leave you entirely without background information, largely because you are not people accustomed to meeting a situation without preparation.”
<name>the man</name>	the man	Eleanor	“Not here they don’t.” “Or remodeling old houses—” “Privacy,” the girl said, and laughed again. “It just seems surprising,” [MASK] said, feeling the man looking at her. “Yeah,” the girl said.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Theo	“Maybe I can’t take it seriously,” she said, “after the sight of [MASK] screaming over her poor clothes and accusing me of writing my name all over her wall. Maybe I’m getting used to her blaming me for everything.”
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Eleanor	[MASK] chose a red sweater, thinking that in this room in this house the red of the sweater and the red of the sandals bought to match it would almost certainly be utterly at war with each other, although they had been close enough yesterday in the city.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Luke	After a minute [MASK] went on idly, “I wonder what the doctor’s book will be like, when he writes it? Do you suppose he’ll put us in?” “You will probably turn up as an earnest young psychic researcher.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Eleanor	“It has an echo.” It sounded, [MASK] thought, like a hollow noise, a hollow bang, as though something were hitting the doors with an iron kettle, or an iron bar, or an iron glove.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Theodora	“What will you do when you go back? Do you have a job?” “No, no job right now. I don’t know what I’m going to do.” “I know what I’ll do.” [MASK] stretched luxuriously.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Luke	“Then I suggest,” [MASK] said, “that we first of all finish off the coffee in the pot, and then go nervously from room to room, endeavoring to discover some rational plan to this house, and leaving doors open as we go.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Eleanor	“No.” And [MASK] felt the words stop in her throat; she had seen her name as the doctor read it. It is me, she thought. It is my name standing out there so clearly; I should not be on the walls of this house.
<name>Miss Golightly</name>	Miss Golightly	Theodora	“I haven’t any apartment,” she said to [MASK]. “I made it up. I sleep on a cot at my sister’s, in the baby’s room. I haven’t any home, no place at all.
<name>John</name>	John	Theodora	“I’m horrible and beasdy and no one can stand me. There. Now tell me about yourself.” “I’m horrible and beastly and no one can stand me.” [MASK] laughed. “Don’t make fun of me.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Eleanor	“Here,” she said, but the door opened into a dim, echoing room neither of them had seen before. “Here,” [MASK] said, but the door she chose led onto the narrow passage to the little parlor where last night they had sat before a fire.
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Eleanor	Maybe I’m getting used to her blaming me for everything.” “Nobody’s blaming you for anything,” the doctor said, and [MASK] felt that she had been reproved. “I hope my clothes will be good enough for her,” she said tartly.
<name>the doctor's name</name>	the doctor's name	Luke	“It’s not safe,” [MASK] said, closing the door to a crack and coming back to sit on the floor, “that man’s going to shoot somebody.” “I don’t like it,” the doctor said, worried.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Theodora	“It looks like paint,” she said hesitantly. “Except”—realizing—“except the smell is awful.” “It’s blood,” [MASK] said with finality. She clung to the door, swaying as the door moved, staring. “Blood,” she said.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Eleanor	“Don’t be so afraid all the time,” she said and reached out to touch [MASK]’s cheek with one finger. “We never know where our courage is coming from.” Then, quickly, she ran down the steps and out onto the lawn between the tall grouped trees.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Eleanor	The sickening cold was gone, except for a reminiscent little thrill of it down [MASK]’s back when she looked at the door. She began to pull at the tight knot she had put in the bathrobe cord, and said, “Intense cold is one of the symptoms of shock.”
<name>Bobby</name>	Bobby	Eleanor	“Good night,” the doctor said. “Sleep tight.” 6 “Coming, mother, coming,” [MASK] said, fumbling for the light. “It’s all right, I’m coming.”
<name>Blanche</name>	Blanche	Theodora	“You’re wearing my bathrobe.” “I forgot mine. Is it really over?” “For tonight, anyway.” [MASK] spoke with certainty. “Can’t you tell? Aren’t you warm again?”
<name>Gray</name>	Gray	Pamela	Farther down the hall the doctor, reading [MASK], lifted his head occasionally to listen, and once went to his door and stood for a minute, looking down the hall, before going back to his book. A nighdight shone at the top of the stairs over the pool of blackness which was the hall.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Eleanor	“At home there would be people around, and lots of talking and laughing and lights and excitement—” “I suppose I don’t need such things,” [MASK] said, almost apologetically. “There never was much excitement for me.
<name>you</name>	you	Carrie	“I mean to take it.” “Suppose even [MASK] got sick? Suppose we couldn’t get a doctor and needed to go to a hospital?” “I want it. I mean to take it.” “I don’t think so.”
<name>Poltergeist</name>	Poltergeist	Arthur	Materializations are often best produced in rooms where there are books. I cannot think of any time when materialization was in any way hampered by the presence of books. I suppose the library has been dusted? [MASK] sometimes sneezes.”
<name>a book</name>	a book	Pamela	“In any case,” the doctor said, “I will not sleep for an hour or so yet; at my age an hour’s reading before bedtime is essential, and I wisely brought [MASK] with me. If any of you has trouble sleeping, I will read aloud to you.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	John	“It is a legend. A story. A libel circulated—” “All right, [MASK]. We won’t quarrel over it. You may believe whatever you choose. Just understand, however, that sometimes purely materialistic views must give way before facts.
<name>Eleanor</name>	Eleanor	Eleanor	“It’s the house. I think it’s biding its time.” “Waiting until we feel secure, maybe, and then it will pounce.” “I winder how long it can wait.” [MASK] shivered and started up the great staircase.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Luke	“I saw it run past my door,” the doctor said, “just caught a glimpse of it, slipping along. I woke [MASK] and we followed it down the stairs and out into die garden and lost it somewhere back of the house.”
<name>Mrs. Price</name>	Mrs. Price	Theodora	She had been rocking a little, each crash against the door pushing her a little backward, and now she was still because the noise was fading. “I’m going to complain to the janitor about the radiators,” [MASK] said from behind her.
<name>George</name>	George	Theodora	If you like, I will go along.” “Anything,” [MASK] said. “To frighten away rabbits. If you like, I will carry a stick. If you like, I wall not come at all.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Theodora	“Everyone laughs. I found myself telling my colleagues at the university that I was going camping this summer.” “I told people I was participating in a scientific experiment,” [MASK] said helpfully. “Without telling them where or what, of course.”
<name>Mr. Stevens</name>	Mr. Stevens	Luke	We left them open so you could find your way. We sat here and watched them swing shut just before you called. Well. Good morning.” “Kippers,” [MASK] said from the table. “Good morning. I hope you ladies are the kipper kind.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Eleanor	“You would hear me whistling, and calling you, while you wandered from door to door, never opening the right one, and I would be inside, not able to find any way to get out—” “And nothing to eat,” [MASK] said unkindly.
<name>The patient</name>	The patient	Eleanor	I slept with my light on all night,” she confided to the doctor, “but nothing happened at all.” “It was all very quiet,” the doctor said. “Did you watch over us all night?” [MASK] asked.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Eleanor	Yes, indeed. Of course, none of us . . .” He hesitated, frowning. “Certainly not,” he said and took three quick agitated sips at his cocktail. “Everything’s so strange,” [MASK] said.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	John	I can’t imagine why none of you thought to do it.” “I was going to,” the doctor said apologetically. “But I thought—” “You always think, [MASK], and that’s your trouble. Naturally I examined the room at once.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Eleanor	“[MASK]? In here.” “Coming.” No time for the light; she kicked a table out of the way, wondering at the noise of it, and struggled briefly with the door of the connecting bathroom.
