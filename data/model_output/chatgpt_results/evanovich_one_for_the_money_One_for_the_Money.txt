<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Rex	Someone tapped on my front door, and both [MASK] and I sat perfectly still with our radar humming. I wasn’t expecting anyone. Most of my neighbors were seniors. No one I was especially chummy with. No one I could imagine knocking on my door at nine-thirty at night.
<name>Stephanie</name>	Stephanie	Vinnie	“It’s what I do best.” Good answer, I thought. More eloquent than mine. “Maybe someday I’ll be good at this, too. Right now my motive is steady employment.” “[MASK] give you a skip?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Morelli	All were stuffed with envelopes. [MASK]’s was more stuffed than most. I crossed the breezeway and knocked on his door. No answer. Big surprise. I knocked again and waited. Nothing. I walked around to the back of the building and counted off windows.
<name>Elvis</name>	Elvis	Carmen	Nothing useful. No pictures of [MASK]. For the most part his drawers had been emptied. He’d taken all his socks and underwear. Too bad. I’d been sort of looking forward to seeing his underwear. We ended up back in the kitchen.
<name>Marcel</name>	Marcel	Morelli	Call the fucking Marines.” “I’m naked!” He smiled and winked and walked out the door. I heard the front door to my apartment close and lock. I didn’t expect an answer, but I felt compelled to call out to [MASK] as a test.
<name>Eddie</name>	Eddie	Ranger	[MASK] had tried to tell me, but it hadn’t taken hold. Never let your guard down, he’d said. When you walk the street, you have to see everything, every second. You let your mind wander, and you could be dead.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Morelli	“Heh, heh, heh.” “It’s not funny. [MASK] broke into my apartment while I was in the shower, and the son of a bitch handcuffed me to the shower rod.” “You gotta like the guy.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Morelli	“Shit,” [MASK] said. He turned his attention back to me. “Now for the good part. I had a recorder attached to the utility pole on the far side of your parking lot. I was using it for backup when I wasn’t around.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Morelli	My knees had stiffened up, and the blood had dried and caked on what was left of my pantyhose. Limping seemed like an indulgent weakness not to be witnessed by the likes of [MASK], so I forged ahead, thinking ouch, ouch, ouch but not saying a word.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Morelli	The moon was low in the sky, spilling silver dollars of light onto the water. We looked back at the white refrigerator truck. The cooler motor hummed quietly in the darkness. “Maybe we should take another look at the truck,” [MASK] said.
<name>the suspect</name>	the suspect	Morelli	I rapped on doors and asked questions and showed pictures. The responses were all similar. No, they didn’t recognize [MASK]’s picture, and no, they hadn’t seen anything unusual from their back windows on the night of the murder or the fire.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ramirez	They gonna say she got what she deserved and probably her old man beat her and leave her for you to see. Maybe they say you been doing some whoring and not paying the price and this be a lesson to you.” “Have you seen [MASK] today?
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Stephanie	I started the engine and turned the air on full blast, positioning all the vents so the cold hit me in the face. “Come on, [MASK],” I said. “Get a grip.” But I couldn’t get a grip.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Morelli	[MASK] sighed. ‘Teah,” he said. “I know.” He took my pocketbook from the counter, turned it upside down, and let the contents fall to the floor. He picked the cuffs out of the mess and took a step forward.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Morelli	“He can’t have you,” I said. “You’re mine, and I’m not sharing.” [MASK] grimaced. “I’ll be under the bed if you need me.” I went to the door and took a look for myself.
<name>Victorian</name>	Victorian	Morelli	I’d opted for a professional image this morning, dressing in a tailored beige linen suit, complete with pantyhose and heels and tasteful pearl earrings. I parked at the curb, climbed the porch stairs, and knocked on the [MASK] front door.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Morelli	Even when I’m on guard, being watchful, [MASK] can piss me off, turn me on, make me question my judgment, and, in general, provoke inconvenient emotions. Concern pinched the comers of his eyes, and there was a seriousness to his mouth that belied the casual tone of his question.
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Benito	I’d tom the page advertising the gym out of my phone book, so I di- aled information. I thanked the operator and dialed the number. I told the man who answered the phone that I was supposed to meet [MASK], but I’d lost his address.
<name>her</name>	her	Morelli	I took a shower and had ice cream for supper. Every ten minutes, I’d look out the window to see if there was any sign of [MASK] in the lot. I’d parked in a far comer where the lighting was poor.
<name>Doc</name>	Doc	Eddie	“I think he’ll stick around and work to improve his odds on longevity ... or die trying.” I was relieved to hear my opinion reinforced. “You have any suggestions?” “None you want to hear.” “Come on, [MASK].
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Clarence	Time to wake up.” [MASK] choked on some spit and opened his eyes. ‘Where am I?” “Police station,” I said. “Everybody out.” He stared at me in unfocused drunken stupidity, and sat as still and unyielding as a sandbag.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Mooch	It didn’t take a genius to notice a missing distributor cap. [MASK] pulled his head out from under the hood, slammed the hood down, kicked a tire, and said something colorful. He jogged back to his car and peeled out of the lot.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Morelli	There were sporadic patches of quiet, followed by mutterings. I tried hanging my full weight on the bar, hoping to bend it, but the rod was industrial strength, built to endure. At last [MASK] appeared in the bathroom doorway. ‘Well?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Ramirez	He plugged the TV in, set the pizza and the beer on the floor, and hit the remote. “You get any phone calls?” “Nothing.” He opened a beer. “It’s early yet. [MASK] does his best work at night.”
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Ranger	He shrugged. “Just repeating what I heard.” “The plot thickens,” I said to [MASK]. “Like I said before, you don’t care about the plot. Your job is simple. Find the man, bring him in.”
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Vinnie	I asked which he recommended and followed his advice. “MasterCard?” he asked. “I just got a fifty-dollar check from [MASK]. Can I sign it over to you?” “Sure,” he said. “That’d be okay.”
<name>Boinlang</name>	Boinlang	Morelli	“Nope. [MASK] nailed you when you were in high school. I don’t think you’d let a second boinlang go to your head.” “How do you know about high school?” “Everybody knows about high school.” “Jesus.”
<name>Wall Street</name>	Wall Street	Ramirez	I diversify, I make a shitload of money, excuse my language, and I get out. “You know what it means to diversify? It means I take the money I make on [MASK], and I invest it in other businesses.
<name>Hamster</name>	Hamster	Rex	fOURTffN Rain pattered gently on my living room window, competing with the sound of [MASK] running in his wheel. It had been four days since I’d been shot, and the pain was down to an annoying but manageable ache. The mental healing would be slower.
<name>Hammy</name>	Hammy	Rex	The first thing I did on waking the following morning was to check my peephole. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary, so I took a fast shower and dressed. [MASK] was sound asleep in his soup can after a tough night of running on his wheel.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Lula	They were sweating and swaying in the heat, yelling out intimate pet names and graphic suggestions to ONE FOR IHF MONEY potential customers. I parked close by, set the six-pack on the hood, and popped one open. [MASK] eyed the beer.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Morelli	[MASK] played his light over the back comers of the tmck. I could barely see him in the dark, but I could hear the scrape of his feet as he moved. “What are you doing?” I asked. “I’m looking for a gun.
<name>the person's name is not given in the passage</name>	the person's name is not given in the passage	Gruber	He was a maggot then, and he was a maggot now. Unfortunately, he was a maggot with a just cause. I was behind on my Miata payments, and [MASK] worked for the repo company. . Six months ago, when I’d bought the car.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Dillon	I resisted the urge to swallow and go “gulp.” I knew the name of the big, huge guy. “I’ll try to get the lock on tomorrow,” [MASK] said. “In the meantime, how about a beer?”
<name>911</name>	911	Morelli	I don’t know how she ever made it home. By the time we heard about it she’d already called [MASK].” “Now what?” He leaned back against the wall. “Now we wait.”
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Connie	“Ten thousand dollars for finding one guy? What’s the catch?” “Sometimes they don’t want to be found, and they shoot at you. But that hardly ever happens.” [MASK] leafed through the file. “The guy who came in yesterday is local.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Cupcake	“It’s not your style, [MASK].” He was still sleeping on the floor in front of the television when I got up at eight. I tiptoed past him and went out to run. He was reading the paper and drinking coffee when I returned.
<name>Bella</name>	Bella	Ramirez	Not smart. I’d been on adrenaline overdose ever since [MASK] appeared at my side, and now that the adrenaline was slacking out, exhaustion and pain were creeping in. My arm and my jaw ached and my pulse rate felt like it had dropped to twelve.
<name>she</name>	she	Carmen	“And you’ll let me collect the finder’s fee on you when we get the missing witness?” “Absolutely.” “You said [MASK] was an informant. What sort of stuff was she informing about?” “She sold whatever scraps came her way.
<name>Rocky</name>	Rocky	Benito	He’s not a bad kid. He just doesn’t know a lot of stuff. All he knows is boxing. All this success is hard on a man like [MASK], who comes from nowhere.” He looked up to see if I was buying.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Morelli	I wasn’t sure if I was relieved or disappointed. I had no idea if [MASK] was listening, protecting me as agreed, so I slept with my defense spray, my portable phone, and my gun on the nightstand. My phone rang at six-thirty.
<name>John</name>	John	Morelli	“I didn’t know. ...” “There’s a lot you don’t know.” His attitude was beginning to piss me off. I was only too well aware that I had a lot to learn about apprehension. I didn’t need [MASK]’s sarcastic superiority.
<name>Spiderman</name>	Spiderman	Morelli	He looked over at my window. Rain was spattering on the dark pane, and a piece of tom screening draped over the sill. “I only do the Spiderman shit in nice weather.” “[MASK] wrecked my screen.” “Guess he in a hurry.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Sal	One of them’s heavy. You’ll need the dolly.” [MASK]’s attention turned back to the fish. “How you gonna cook these fillets?” he asked me. “You know you can pan fry them, or bake them, or stuff them.
<name>The store</name>	The store	Bemie	He didn’t sound friendly. [MASK] had called to say they were having a storewide sale and I should drop by. Twenty percent off blenders and a complimentary bottle of daiquiri mix to the first twenty customers. My eyes glazed over at the thought of a daiquiri.
<name>Betty</name>	Betty	Jackie	I set the alarm, and [MASK] and I took off at a trot. She had about two hundred pounds on the hoof, and she wasn’t even breathing hard when we pushed through the double glass doors. I guess humping all day keeps you in shape.
<name>Ranger</name>	Ranger	Morelli	‘What’s it set at?” I asked. “Twenty.” ONE fOR THE MONEY “Why so cold?” [MASK] stepped down and moved to the back door. “Why do you think?” “Somebody’s trying to freeze something?”
<name>Dr. Karen Fletcher</name>	Dr. Karen Fletcher	Vinnie	I was now an official deadbeat. And if that wasn’t depressing enough, I’d weakened halfway through dessert and promised my mother I’d go see [MASK]. I dragged myself into the shower and stumbled out a half hour later after an exhausting crying jag.
<name>Marv</name>	Marv	Sup-	[MASK] pose I lay down on the pavement and you run over me a few times with my own car. . . just for old times. Would you like that? Do you get your money dead or alive?” “No reason to get testy about it.
<name>Max</name>	Max	Vinnie	I let myself into my apartment, dug out an auxiliary phone cord, put a new tape in the answering machine, and took a shower. It was Sunday. [MASK] had given me a week, and the week was up. I didn’t care.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Alpha	“You have any more trouble, you call me right away. If he damaged your door I’ll make good on it.” “The door’s okay. Just keep him away from me.” [MASK] pressed his lips together and nodded.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Jackie	Two hours dragged by without further information. We’d eaten all the pastries and were forced to eat the oranges. “Don’t like this,” [MASK] said. “Don’t like being cooped up in institutions. Whole fucking place smells like canned green beans.”
<name>Stephanie</name>	Stephanie	Bemie	[MASK] turned to me. “So what are you doing now?” I fiddled with my fork. My day hadn’t exactly been a success, and announcing to the world that I was a fugitive apprehension agent seemed presumptuous.
<name>anyone</name>	anyone	Striker	Then I leave some high-quality H spilled in the boat and on the barrel so the cops figure out the operation and shut it down. Now no ones left to talk about me behind my back, and I’m too risky for [MASK] to use for a while.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Eddie	Every table was filled now, and there was a knot of people waiting at the door. No one wanted to cook when it got this hot. “So what’s the second problem?” [MASK] asked. “If I tell you, you have to promise not to get overwrought.”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Morelli	I laced up my Reeboks and went downstairs to take another look. The parking lot and adjoining streets were filled with fire trucks and police cars and ambulances. Barricades had been set up, holding the curious away from the smoldering remains of [MASK]’s Jeep.
<name>Papa John's</name>	Papa John's	Pino	He was out of uniform, back to wearing jeans and a navy T-shirt. “Another day in that van, and I might be glad to go to jail,” he said. “Is that a [MASK]’s pizza?”
<name>Holly</name>	Holly	Morelli	“Thanks for the offer, but I have a busy morning, and I really should be moving along. If you spot [MASK], I’d appreciate a call.” “Most girls think it’s a treat for the champ to buy them a soda.”
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Morelli	This would be a reasonable place for [MASK] to watch or listen, I thought, but there was no sign of him. I drove through the service road and circled the block, methodically enlarging the area until I’d covered all dri-vable streets for a nine-block square.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Morelli	And it belonged to [MASK]. It didn’t seem fair that a scofflaw like him should have such a great car and I should have such a piece of shit. Probably as long as I had the car open, I should start it up for him, I thought.
<name>Robin</name>	Robin	Morelli	[MASK]’s $10,000 recovery fee would go a long way toward restoring some semblance of normalcy to my life, but it was a stopgap measure. Probably I should still be applying for jobs. Who was I kidding. I’d covered all the bases in my field.
<name>insurance</name>	insurance	Vinnie	“Had to go to the dentist. Having his incisors sharpened, I think.” She pulled her master copy of the file and took my receipt. “We don’t need [MASK] to do this. I can write you a check.”
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Ranger	“I’m multilingual,” [MASK] said. I followed him to the door, feeling jealous, wishing I knew a second language. My sleep was deep and dreamless, and I might have slept until November if it weren’t for the relentless pounding on my front door.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Rex	Housewives in the Burg were always prepared for disaster, stockpiling toilet paper and cans of creamed com in case the blizzard of aughty-aught should ever repeat itself. Even [MASK] was excited by the activity, watching from his cage with his little pink hamster feet pressed against the glass.
<name>George</name>	George	Morelfi	“I talked to her neighbors yesterday, and it turns out one of the tenants who remembered seeing [MASK]’s alleged witness has suffered sudden death.” “What land of sudden death?” “Hit and run in front of the building.”
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Morelli	I didn’t want [MASK] to know I’d been scared and lonely. so I lied. “I cleaned the sink, and he didn’t like the smell of the cleanser, so I brought him into the bedroom.” The silence stretched for a couple beats.
<name>Uncle Enzo</name>	Uncle Enzo	Connie	“Such as?” “Such as try to drive with a 150-proof blood alcohol level. On this particular occasion he had the misfortune to total a police cruiser.” “He ran into a cruiser?” “Not exactly,” [MASK] said.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Ramirez	If you think he’s that dangerous, you should get a restraining order.” “I don’t have a lot of confidence in a restraining order. Besides, what am I going to tell the judge . . . that [MASK] threatened to send me a present?
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Morelli	You know how bad it is for the battery to let a car sit. Well one thing led to another and next thing I’d agreed to drive the car around for her.” “So you’ve been driving [MASK]’s car as a favor to his mother?”
<name>John</name>	John	Morelli	There was definitely regret. “Do you think it could have ended any other way?” I asked. “No,” [MASK] said. “He would have killed you if you hadn’t killed him first.” This was true.
<name>the bar</name>	the bar	Bemie	I looked at my watch. It was almost nine. I couldn’t get to [MASK] before closing. Too bad. I was pretty sure if I had a daiquiri I could think much more clearly and probably figure out who tried to send me into orbit.
<name>they</name>	they	Morelli	The controlling supervisor keeps all the cards in a locked file. I guess in this case it was released as necessary information to the investigation.” “So maybe this is more complicated than it would first appear. Maybe the killing tied in to something [MASK] had been working on.”
<name>my mother</name>	my mother	Ranger	I set the alarm and dragged myself out of the car and up the stairs. I left my shoes in the foyer and put the answering machine and my pocketbook on the kitchen counter. I cracked open a beer and called the hospital to check on [MASK].
<name>Boss</name>	Boss	Gee	“[MASK], I’m glad you shared that with me.” His smile lit up the room. “I figured you’d want to know.” He tipped back in his chair and folded his arms across his chest. “You know any of the background on this case?”
<name>Connor</name>	Connor	Ramirez	I lost footing and went facedown to the floor, my hands hitting first, skidding over unvarnished wood, my body following, the impact knocking the air from my lungs. [MASK] straddled me, his butt on my back, his hand fisting in my hair, pulling savagely.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Ramirez	“You ask a lot of questions,” [MASK] said. We were standing close to the big old-fashioned windows in the front of the room, and for no reason other than instinct, I shifted my attention to the building across the street.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Morelli	Looked like an emergency to me. There was an added advantage to snitching [MASK] s car. I was pretty sure he wouldn’t like it. And if he was pissed off enough, maybe he’d do something stupid and come after it.
<name>Chad</name>	Chad	Ramirez	I felt tendrils of panic curl into my stomach, and I cautioned myself not to overreact. [MASK] was playing with me. Showing off in front of his friends. Probably stung because I hadn’t succumbed to his charms. Now he had to save face.
<name>Irish</name>	Irish	Hungarians	Houses were attached and narrow. Yards were small. Cars were American. The people were mostly of Italian descent, with enough [MASK] and Germans thrown in to offset inbreeding. It was a good place to buy calzone or play the numbers.
<name>Officer</name>	Officer	Dillon	Can’t complain. What can I do for you?” FOR IH£ MONEY “I’m worried about crime, [MASK]. I thought it would be a good idea to get another dead bolt put on my door.” “That’s cool,” he said.
<name>John</name>	John	Morelli	..” “Female logic? Excuse me?” [MASK] turned from the door, shrugged into a lightweight sports coat, and grabbed the black nylon duffel from the floor. “I’ve got to get out of here.” “Where are you going?”
<name>guilty</name>	guilty	Morelli	If I was [MASK], I’d want to get those two missing persons, either to prove my innocence, or to make sure they couldn’t prove my guilt. I haven’t a clue how you do this. We can’t find them and chances are you can’t find them either.”
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Ramirez	I’d gotten a city map at the supermarket, and I spread it out on my table while I picked at dinner. Tomorrow I’d be methodical about searching for the blue van. I’d check the area surrounding the gym, and I’d also check out [MASK]’s home address.
<name>the informant</name>	the informant	Ramirez	He said you were cool. Said you switched on the recorder when [MASK] came on the line.” “You should have seen me five minutes before. I couldn’t remember 911.” “I don’t suppose you’d consider taking a vacation?”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Ramirez	He’s not going to be pleased if I’m late.” I took a step backward, and [MASK] grabbed me by the scruff of my neck, his fingers digging in with enough force to make me hunch involuntarily.
<name>the driver</name>	the driver	Morelli	The sky was starless and moonless. Traffic was sporadic. Easier to spot a tail, I told myself, but I didn’t believe it. I had minimal confidence in my ability to spot [MASK]. There was no sign of the van. That didn’t mean much.
<name>partner</name>	partner	Morelli	We both know you aren’t capable of bringing me in by force. The only way you’re going to collect your money is by my permission. You’re just going to have to sit tight.” “I don’t like your attitude, [MASK].”
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Sunny	“Make sure you know how to use it.” I stepped outside, held my arm straight out, and sprayed. The wind shifted, and I ran inside and slammed the door. “That wind can be sneaky,” [MASK] said.
<name>insurance</name>	insurance	Morelli	And that chances of this being meant for me were large. On the positive side, I didn’t have to sweat [MASK] finding out about yesterday’s accident damage. I backed away from the fire and eased my way through the small crowd that had formed.
<name>Chili</name>	Chili	Morty	“[MASK] sort of did himself. You have anything easy come in? I could use some fast money.” “I have an exhibitionist gone FTA on a $2,000 bond. He’s been kicked out of three retirement homes. He’s currently living in an apartment somewhere.”
<name>she</name>	she	Lula	the cop wanted to know. “No. I live here. I don’t know where [MASK] lives. I don’t even know her last name.” The phone rang and I automatically reached out to answer. The caller’s voice whispered from the handset.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Joe	“Who’s this?” “I’m a friend of [MASK]’s. He asked me to run his car once in a while for him.” “That’s a lie,” she said. “I know who I’m talking to.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Stephanie	“You can’t stay in hiding for the rest of your life. What about your mother? What about your phone bill?” “My phone bill? Oh shit, [MASK], you haven’t been running up my phone bill, have you?”
<name>Tony</name>	Tony	Sal	A chicken franchise, a Laundromat, maybe even a butcher shop. Maybe I can get a butcher shop real cheap because the guy who owns it can’t make good on some bad bets he took.” “[MASK].” “Yeah.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Morelli	“I hadn’t noticed.” “There was powder on the floor of the boat. And now you picked some up from the drum and wiped it on your pants.” “Jesus,” [MASK] said, staring at his hand. “Holy shit.”
<name>probably</name> (There is no clear indication of a proper name in this passage, so this is a guess based on the context.)	probably (There is no clear indication of a proper name in this passage, so this is a guess based on the context.)	Connie	You able to get a fix on him?” “Not exactly a fix, but I know he’s still in town.” “He’s a serious babe,” [MASK] said. “Saw him six months ago, before all this happened.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Alpha	It was about forty degrees in his office, but [MASK] had dark stains under his armpits. If I was in his place I’d be sweating, too. He was watching his dream turn into a nightmare, and he didn’t have the guts to face up.
<name>John</name>	John	Gruber	I thunked my forehead on the steering wheel. “Damn.” I’d gone to high school with [MASK]. He was a maggot then, and he was a maggot now. Unfortunately, he was a maggot with a just cause.
<name>him</name>	him	Ramirez	Anyone but [MASK]. My heart beat with a ragged thud, and my stomach sickened. As I saw it, I had two choices. I could run for the front door or dive down the fire escape. That was assuming my feet would move.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Stephanie	“Where’s my distributor cap?” When in doubt, always take the offensive. “If you don’t get out of my bathroom this instant I’m going to start screaming.” “It’s two o’clock in the morning, [MASK].
