<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Grandma	(For [MASK] paid me, of course.) Would I drive her to some other old woman’s house, or to visit some pathetic old cripples in some nursing home & wait around for her & drive her back home & that was O.K.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	SQUIRREL	Fuck off! & clapped my hands & kicked at it, & it ran away. Was it [MASK]’S dog? My .38 pistol in my pocket, should I kill the dog? No sound inside the van.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Grandma	& the beer gut, & tight belt if I’d worn a belt which I did not, with these khaki shorts. & returned to the kitchen where [MASK] & the other old woman were talking about Q_P__, I know.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	SQUIRREL	[MASK] is smart & sexy & knows it for sure. A better muscle-build than his friend, too. His skin is slightly blemished on his jaws & he has a habit of grimacing & rolling his eyes, that mocking look you see in kids that age.
<name>Mr. Antolini</name>	Mr. Antolini	Grandma	I ripped it up without opening it & tossed the pieces away. Mowing [MASK]’s lawn one Saturday in July & trimming the evergreen hedge & I heard kids shouting & laughing next door in the neighbors’ swimming pool. DON’T LOOK the voice said calmly.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	SQUIRREL	It was easy to trail [MASK] home on his bicycle. It is easy to trail anyone home, of your choosing. No need even to be INVISIBLE. I learned the family name. & telephoned once or twice just to hear the phone ring in that house.

<name>anyone</name>	anyone	Junie	& all of it blind & chance & yet there’s the DNA CODE. & that is why a sister (or a brother) knows you that way you don’t want to be known. Not that [MASK] knows me.

<name>Distractions</name>	Distractions	Eyes	[MASK] are avoided. O.K. men let’s get the ball rolling, who wants to begin? There was a weird buzz at the back of my head. Kept looking back over my shoulder & shifting my ass in the chair but there was nobody behind me or nobody I could see.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Grandma	Trying to get me to stay for supper etc. There was another old woman, a widow who was a friend of [MASK]’s & sometimes I would drive this other old woman to her home & she would tip me, too. Like a taxi service.
<name>Eugene</name>	Eugene	Dr.	At last it is 4:49 p.m. [MASK] E_writes out a refill for my prescription. Asks if I have anything to ask him & I can’t think of anything & THANK YOU DOCTOR & the session is over. S2 For all that has happened, has happened.
<name>his</name>	his	Q_his	but I think it’s like he is fearful of me as in the past he was impatient & always finding fault. Like [MASK] only son was a stu- dent failing a course of his. Yet I believe he is thinking we are all pretty lucky like my lawyer said.
<name>someone</name>	someone	SQUIRREL	BUT YOU MASTER. FUCK ME IN THE ASS MASTER UNTIL I BLEED BLUE GUTS. & I wipe the sticky cum in wads of tissue & return to the booth where I will leave it hidden inside my napkin for [MASK] to clear away unknowing. MY ZOMBIE!

[MASK] ceased to take note of precise time but remained calm, controlled.
<name>John</name>	John	Lucille	I got it at the reservation upstate.” & [MASK] says, touching it, “It’s unusual. Does it have any symbolic meaning? Is it some Chippewa custom?” & I say, “I guess so. I don’t know.”
<name>MY CAR</name>	MY CAR	BARRY	Nor did I give any sign. & NOW [MASK] WAS RETURNED TO ME! But golden-shining in the sun & in fact better-looking, sexy that way young teenaged boys are so self-assured & swaggering with their buddies & showing off to girls.
<name>God</name>	God	Junie	I’m eating frozen Taco Bell beef burritos & drinking Bud out of the can. Flicking through the TV channels. Fifty-two channels & back again to the beginning. I’m edgy like there is something I am seeking & don’t know what it is. [MASK] is TALKING.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Mon	So quick & friendly I could not prevent EYE CONTACT. But it will not be repeated. Nor any of them beneath this roof. I never think of it. [MASK]. 4:00 p.m.-4:50 p.m. Mt. Vernon Medical Center on the other side of the campus, in good weather
<name>someone</name>	someone	SQUIRREL	& turned on the radio to listen for news, for it was 8:08 p.m. now & by now [MASK] would be missed. & maybe the police had been notified? & beginning to search, & set up roadblocks? There was nothing on the news.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Quen	Like I am one of her problem students only needing to be redeemed by some adult. Like I am somebody you can tease & nag with a smile saying [MASK], you’d be really good-looking if you didn’t mope so much.
<name>Emily's</name>	Emily's	Grandma	Of course, not Q_P_ her only grandson, nor anyone else, would ever disclose such a cruel truth to a woman so old. Maybe I am wrong to say it is [MASK]’s blame, I think probably it is no one’s.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Flatface	& I’m getting a little pissed but not showing it. Saying, “O.K., where are your vocal cords exactly?” & [MASK] puts her fingers to her throat like she’s checking does she have any. “You can feel them,” she says.
<name>Brock Turner</name>	Brock Turner	Q____P__was	If your son had come up before a black judge, or a woman judge—it might’ve been much, much worse. [MASK] allowed after negotiation (in which Q__P___took no part) to plead guilty to sexual mis- demeanor committed against a minor.

<name>Earth</name>	Earth	Jupiter	but it was just little black puffs going off on the screen. Flashes & fireballs & plumes of flame. Meteor trails how many millions or billions of miles away colliding with [MASK]’s atmosphere & going off. Fragment Q hit about the time I nodded off.
<name>David</name>	David	Bruce	The principle (though not articulated at the time, being too young) of pushing up close behind the boys in the cafeteria line, [MASK] & his friends. Or entering the showers in high school at the right instant, with just the right stride & angle of head & shoulders.

<name>Enoch</name>	Enoch	Akhil	[MASK] is shy & dusty-skinned & slender as a girl. In his mid-twenties at least but looks fifteen. Their blood so different from ours. Ancient civilization. Monkey-like. He speaks English so soft & whispery I almost can’t hear—Thank you sir.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Junie	He said, “Are you out of your mind? Absolutely not.” “O.K.,” I said. Labor Day, & a few days later. [MASK] called & left a message on the tape. Did I see the morning paper.
<name>Home Depot</name>	Home Depot	Sears	who except Q__P_, CARETAKER? & if a ZOMBIE is a faii- ure there is the earthen floor for safe & sanitary disposal. & there is a new door replacing the old rotted door & last week I purchased a steel padlock from [MASK] for added security.
<name>Cheryl</name>	Cheryl	Mister	Two giant Cokes & cups of black coffee for a caffeine buzz. & the uppers I’d taken that morning. Dazed & shaky from jerking off so hard & my vision fading in & out of focus & the gum-chewing waitress asked me something—[MASK]?

<name>Professor</name>	Professor	Professor	Or somebody pretending to be [MASK] P__with his nasal drone & habit of clearing his throat & pausing to let his words sink in. Cosmic rays from outer space. Of an age many millions of years. More concentrated at higher elevations than lower.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Akhil	Also would I like to come to dinner Sunday. At the time the phone rang I was on the third floor in [MASK]’s room using a screwdriver to open the rusted furnace vent which had been only partway open. Crouched over & my face heavy with blood.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	QUENTINS	Standing on tiptoe to pat my cheek. A fattish old woman but frail, too. They say their bones are weak, hollowed out inside & easy to break. Her washed-out no-color eyes I had a weird flash miniature [MASK] were mirrored in!

<name>Betty</name>	Betty	Grandma	I have been driving [MASK] to senior citizens’ affairs & visiting friends. I have told them how sorry I am that I have hurt them. & how much it means to me that they trust me. I will live up to your trust from now on I told them.
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Grandma	[MASK] says. The foundation of our house was laid 1892 & it is still firm. The cellar Grandpa P_had renovated in the 1950s (as I have been told, I was not bom yet) is such that there are two sections: the new, & the old.
<name>Ben</name>	Ben	Grandpa	& the promise of more, & MORE! & I was seeing with NEW EYES, & needed but a few hours’ sleep crowded with plans, & such muscle-energy & zest & hope for the capture of the prey & MY ZOMBIE awaiting in [MASK]’s old cistern!
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Grandma	& that was O.K. in theory. [MASK] would pay me $50 to $75 cash for just a few hours’ work & I did not need to be too thor- w ough, she never came out to examine it.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	DEKE	Some shift to the left, or right, or up, or down, or in thickness, or in thinness. Some alteration of skin tone, or freckles. Or a more baritone voice not reedy & nasal any longer. & Q__P___would be pledged to [MASK] for instance!
<name>Papa</name>	Papa	SQUIRREL	& seeing me turning my wristband round & round sort of compulsive like I do she asks what is it?—-my memento of [MASK] which is part of his blond-brown hair from his little pigtail & some of my own hairs braided together with leather thongs & red yam.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	SQUIRREL	Why didn’t Q_P__have friends like that, guys who liked me, guys like brothers? twins? & now when they see me their eyes flick carelessly over me. Little cocksuckers don’t see me at all. My hand was shaky!—dropped my fork & it clattered to the floor as [MASK] was passing near.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Junie	A light touch. You can feel them. They vibrate when you speak. [MASK] & her friends are talking about religion now I guess. & one of the men says religion is tyranny, & delusion. & responsible for much of the cruelty of mankind.
<name>Zombie</name>	Zombie	Quentin	A voice said If you go down into the cellar, [MASK], he awaits you. Who? Who awaits me? You know who. My ZOMBIE? My ZOMBIE? But the voice disappeared into the TV ads & foot- % steps overhead & plumbing.
<name>Q___P__</name>	Q___P__	SQUIRREL	“O.K.,” I said, sliding out of the booth, on my unsteady legs & the sunglasses sliding down my nose, “—that’s cool. That’s just fine.” If [MASK] was looking on, & gazed after Q___P__walking away with his head high, I could only guess.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Junie	& I’m trying to finish the burrito & staring at the TV screen knowing there is some message here, something urgent. [MASK] says she would like to speak with me, she is worried about me, the influence the wrong kind of associates can have on me.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	SQUIRREL	& that little pigtail! & his tanned good-looking face lifted, the forehead slightly creased in that way you see in kids & it surprises you, a kid thinking let alone worrying. Like [MASK] knows himself the bearer of a SPECIAL DESTINY.
<name>me</name>	me	Junie	Maybe she would leave something to her grandson & granddaughter? In recent months I was led to believe that I was her favorite & not [MASK] any longer. But I could be mistaken—with females & their feelings about one another you can’t tell.
<name>He</name>	He	SQUIRREL	For what other destiny. & [MASK] staring in disbelief seeing the bright yellow Easter chicks so fluffy & cute in the alley in his path had no choice but to slow & brake his bike. & straddling his bike laughed saying Hey what’s up? Baby chicks?
<name>Sodapop</name>	Sodapop	SQUIRREL	[MASK] with his TIGERS cap backward on his blond-brown hair & his lean shoulders hunched over the lowered handlebars & the belt & waist of his jeans so narrow it looked like I could circle my fingers around him. & that little pigtail!
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Junie	[MASK] has gone through stages of being pissed as hell at her kid brother Q___& not speaking to me & one time (I was drunk or in some state not 100% conscious, in my leather clothes & ponytail) not acknowledging me when we ran into each other on the street.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Grandma	A strong smell lifted off me I guess, hadn’t taken time to shower as [MASK] had invited. My baffle that day was a birthmark on my left cheek. Inscribed with blueberry juice & red Magic Marker. Sort of star-shaped, about the size of a dime.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	SQUIRREL	8c I knew I was moving into the future. There is no PAST anybody can get to, to alter things or even to know what those things were but there is definitely a future, we are already in it. l&h44 Pl*yOl4 My name for him was [MASK].
<name>him</name>	him	SQUIRREL	but I track [MASK] in the comer of my eye where he’s clearing tables of dirty dishes etc. Perspiration gleaming on his upper lip. If you would look at me. If you would smile. Just once!
<name>UNCLE</name>	UNCLE	SQUIRREL	GROUND ZERO so close it is almost like it has happened. & when I return to 118 North Church Street MY ZOMBIE [MASK] will be awaiting me in the cellar. Food & drink & a full-length mirror for his (& his master’s) use.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	SQUIRREL	with a smile. & I said O.K. thanks! & though I lifted my eyes to his there was no eye contact, [MASK] was already moving on. A clear glimpse of his greenish-cool eyes, though. Like no other eyes I have ever seen.
<name>Queequeg</name>	Queequeg	Quentin	[MASK], O.K.? Agreed? In fact Q_P____was visibly ashamed & repentant & had “learned his lesson”—one look at him, his grainy red-rimmed eyelids & parched lips, you knew. Two years’ sentence—suspended. Psychotherapy, counseling. Regular reporting to probation office.
<name>Edgar</name>	Edgar	Dr.	There is a flurry of leaves against the window behind him & the sky is darkening so early. I sit & frown & an oily sweat on my forehead & upper lip & there is a long silence. Then I say, A dream of being in some water. & [MASK] E__says
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Grandma	Farther up is a Burger King just opened that [MASK] has not seen yet where sometimes I get hamburgers & fries I bring back to my room to eat & watch TV or do my homework for my courses. C/>*£TAK£* This is a small white card tacked beside my door.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	SQUIRREL	[MASK] again pedaling oblivious! Like he is in a movie, & does not know it. But I know it. & I park at the curb & allow him to pass me. His strong legs pedaling, & his lean back bent over like in a swoon!
<name>June</name>	June	Grandma	& I’m licking cherry-swirl ice cream from the spoon looping my tongue around the spoon saying, “[MASK], hey no. Don’t cry. The world is not ever that different.” HOW THINGS PLAY OUT.
<name>Edgar</name>	Edgar	Dr.	To confide in [MASK] E_____________________________. Something that might be a dream. Such as a person might have. Flying?
<name>Montmorency</name>	Montmorency	Akhil	& the tea kettle was boiling & singing, so I took it off the heat, & called [MASK] & his friend back, & said the fumigation was over, & I did not think they were in any danger now.
<name>Benny</name>	Benny	SQUIRREL	“[MASK]” just came to me & so it was. This could not be just chance. Q__P___struck like somebody’d hit me over the head with a hammer. & my cock alert, in wonderment. For here was my true ZOMBIE. No questions asked.
<name>The lashes</name>	The lashes	Arteries	from the margin of the upper eyelid. Again I sight the instrument as carefully as possible, and take a profile photograph of it in this position. This is the nearest approach to precision of which the method can boast. Then comes the ticklish part. [MASK] are within reach.
<name>you</name>	you	Quentin	A pause & she says [MASK]? are you there? & I grunt yeah yeah & I’m thinking how your sister (or it could be your brother) comes out of the identical hole you came out of. & shot from the identical prick.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Grandma	[MASK] is to blame for much of it. She would be hurt to know but that is so. Of course, not Q_P_ her only grandson, nor anyone else, would ever disclose such a cruel truth to a woman so old.
<name>Mr. Antolini</name>	Mr. Antolini	Grandma	(In fact the semester was over, the courses were ended.) & then [MASK] got the idea to hire me for yard work, mow the lawn (which is approximately one half-acre) & trim the hedge & sprinkle fertilizer in the rose beds etc.
<name>my father</name>	my father	SQUIRREL	& it was snowing & so the landscape was altered, like a new place or even a planet where I could not get my bearings. Could not find the road I had taken with [MASK] & so could not find the river.
<name>the boy</name>	the boy	SQUIRREL	& pulled the burlap sack over [MASK]’S head & secured that too with tape. & now the face & head were gone, & the boy’s body lay shuddering with breath. & a stain darkening his crotch. & the smell of urine.
<name>Miss Emily</name>	Miss Emily	Grandma	[MASK]’s house is an old faded-red brick Victorian as they call it. With a smudged look in the front like somebody moved his thumb across it. Three storeys, plus the attic. An old addition at the rear used for storage.
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	Junie	[MASK] repeats she’s inviting me for dinner tomorrow night, not just to talk but there’s this friend she’d like me to meet & I say I’m busy. Well, the night after that?—& I’m busy.
<name>McDonald's</name>	McDonald's	Grandma	Q_P____the invisi- ble man. What I was wearing: khaki shorts & a soiled tank-top (loose-fitting to hide my little pot-belly), & my aviator sunglasses, & battered sandals. Working at [MASK]’s
<name> Lance </name>	Lance	SQUIRREL	That route he took, I’d memorized. Following in my van at a safe distance. Or, circling the block to park & wait for him to pass oblivious. The way [MASK] rode his bicycle!—fast, & hunched over, & no wasted moves.
<name>Mr. B</name>	Mr. B	Quentin	[MASK]. But now we are going to turn over a new leaf aren’t we son. You get to the attic by a steep narrow stairs at the rear of the third floor hallway. The attic is locked & OFF LIMITS to tenants like the cellar.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Quentin	Those piss-eyes alert & wondering, the first time in sixteen months. “Well—what did you dream about the baby chicks, [MASK]?” “I don’t know,” I said, & this was true, at that time, “—they were just there.”
<name>Arnold</name>	Arnold	Barry	Nor the insides with more such drawings on centerfold models of male muscle-bodies & the young guy who looked like [MASK] might’ve been in a few years & many pounds heavier & a shiny pink upright banana lifting from his groin & parts of certain photos scissored out.
<name>He</name>	He	Quentin	Nor what kind of “justice” would be extracted. Just plead guilty, it’s worked out & you’ll be O.K. But if my son is not guilty?—what a travesty! [MASK] would not do such a thing. He is my son, my boy & I know.
