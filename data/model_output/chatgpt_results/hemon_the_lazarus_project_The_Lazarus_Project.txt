<name>God</name>	God	Mary	Have some coffee. We sipped coffee in silence. Hear my sorrow, may it break your fucking heart, I hummed to myself. But I could not be quiet. I talked to [MASK], I said. That’s nice.
<name>Marion</name>	Marion	Iuliana	“When a patient dies,” she explained, rather unhelpfully, “I feel that he is dead.” As [MASK] and I parted for good, I kissed her cheek; it was as soft as an inside of a thigh.
<name>Tzeitl</name>	Tzeitl	Roza	They swept the books off the shelf. Our life was blowing up, the shrapnel flying around the room. With his sleeves rolled up for hard work, one pogromchik grabbed [MASK]’s hair and pulled her off the chair.
<name>Neo</name>	Neo	Brik	Let me tell you what the problem is, [MASK]. Even if you knew what you want to know, you would still know nothing. You ask questions, you want to know more, but no matter how much more I tell you, you will never know anything.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Rora	She clearly knew these lines by heart; she seemed to be indifferent to [MASK] taking pictures of her or browsing through the photos. At the curve of her jaw, there was a birthmark, a slight spot whose color rhymed with her eyes.
<name>John</name>	John	Isador	The men are large, wearing suits and bowler hats. One of them has a neatly trimmed mustache. They are speaking without excitement or urgency. “Get in,” he says and points at the casket. “You go first,” [MASK] whimpers.
<name>Mr. Ripley</name>	Mr. Ripley	Rora	[MASK]’s black, polished, possibly Italian shoes looked uncannily out of place on the dirt road—he picked a stone out of his leather sole and threw it over his shoulder, as though performing a good-luck ritual.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Isador	I just hope I don’t have to relieve myself, [MASK] said, but she didn’t laugh. She will never laugh again. She has washed herself over the basin, scrubbed her hands many times, but the stench is pasted against the walls of her nostrils.
<name>Patrick</name>	Patrick	Hammond	A throe climbs from her heels to her spine to lodge itself in her skull. The camera flash goes off, a cloudlet of acrid smoke drifts toward the bedroom. “Goddamn it,” [MASK] says. “This one is messed up.
<name>myself</name>	myself	Rora	But what do you see when you look at a picture you took? I see the picture, [MASK] said. What’s with these questions? When I look at my old pictures, all I can see is what I used to be but am no longer.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Rora	The blackjack woman said: “Hullo!” She was small-shouldered, her twiggy arms emerging like tongues from the puffy sleeves. [MASK] went straight to the blackjack table, sat across from her, and grinned.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Iuliana	[MASK] and I, we could keep each other sad and live off sardines for the rest of our lives and through the nothingness beyond. I would stroke her hair with my heavy hand; I would write my book and read it for her, very slowly; I would kiss her dimple before heavy sleep.
<name>John</name>	John	Rambo	And I don’t care. Nobody cares. [MASK] is pretty much part of the government now; the business is running smoothly: he gets them the money, does not misbehave, they treat him as a war hero. It doesn’t matter what I could say.
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Taube	“Say something.” She looks at him as though surprised that she can hear him at all, that he can speak. “Allow me to get you another glass of water,” [MASK] says and stands up. “You look pale.”
<name>Sal</name>	Sal	Rora	Hoydee-ho, haydee-hi, all I ever do is die. [MASK] was falling behind, getting ahead, photographing without pause. I could not understand what he saw, what there was to photograph, how he could not feel helpless and hopeless.
<name>Manon</name>	Manon	Olga	“Leave me alone,” [MASK] growls. The woman has only lower teeth, her tongue lapping at the upper gums. “Unbind him,” the woman caterwauls. “Unbind him and let him go.”
<name>Dr. Shepherd</name>	Dr. Shepherd	Mary	“I see,” I said. Once [MASK] lost a patient on the surgical table. He was a gang member taken down in a drive-by shooting. The bullet was lodged in his frontal lobe; somehow he was conscious when they brought him in.
<name>Gregor</name>	Gregor	Olga	The petrified rye loaf appears on the table, then it vanishes. The fire in the stove is still expiring with nauseating smoke; cinereous flakes slip through the cracks in the stove and land on [MASK]’s hair and face, light as breath.
<name>Yulia</name>	Yulia	Iuliana	[MASK] had a pale face with deep, mournful eyes and dark eyebrow dashes. Her hair seemed to be ponytailed to the point of pain. She greeted us in English and firmly shook our respective hands, yet she frowned at us sorrowfully as though our presence made her want to weep.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Kaplan	Neighbors said he had been at home all day and had acted in a particularly nervous way, seemingly expect- ing something. The arrest was made after a detective overheard the message given to [MASK] over a crossed telephone wire. (“The jig is up,” someone said.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Rora	Girls in heavenly-blue and sun-yellow shirts were playing soccer on the Parker High School field. We parked the car and watched them. You should go back where he came from, [MASK] said. There is always a before and an after.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the context)	someone (There is no proper name given in the context)	Mary	I could not think of what I was going to do, and I was frighteningly alone with it. I sat there, waiting for the molasses of fear to thin out so I could call [MASK] and share the happy news.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Isador	A white cross is chalked on her door; she wipes it with her hand, puts the key in, but the door is unlocked. Maybe [MASK] has left, somehow getting past this shmegege. It is a miracle they have not found him yet.
<name>you</name>	you	Olga	I look at the pictures of you, my son, and remember how good-natured you were as a boy. Don’t despair, she writes, but be brave and work hard. Know that we think of [MASK] and you, ceaselessly.
<name>Snopes</name>	Snopes	Rora	There were no lights in those homes and the curtains blacked out the windows, so when some concerned citizen spread his curtain apart, [MASK] could see, from a hundred yards away, the white of his eye sparkling.
<name>Colonel Kurtz</name>	Colonel Kurtz	Miller	But with time it becomes something else, the war becomes this space where anybody can kill anybody at any time, where everybody wants everybody dead, because the only way you are sure to stay alive is if everybody else is dead. And did you find [MASK]?
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Olga	It soothes [MASK] that her companion is not worried about the detective, but she says nothing, and so they ride in silence. It is probably a symptom of her mind decomposing that she feels a certain pleasure in not knowing where they are heading.
<name>Rothschild</name>	Rothschild	Averbuch	“They came with carriages full of carpets and chandeliers. He brought a grand piano. He lost it all gambling, my grandmother said. His daughter married an actor.” “Did your grandmother remember a family named [MASK]?”
<name>Lily</name>	Lily	Azra	I did not ask him to stop; being in the same picture with [MASK] somehow brought me close to her. She had a gold necklace, the lily pendant resting in the dimple below her throat. I imagined her standing tall in a purple velvet skirt, her hair held high by a pin.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Isador	He was still asleep when she came back, so that when [MASK], reeking of the cesspit, walked by him in woman’s clothes, his face tucked into the scarf, he woke up only to utter a comment about stinking foreigners, but was too dazed to notice anything.
<name>children</name>	children	Fata	He decides to read some philosophy and for years studies everything from the old Greeks onward, but can’t find the meaning of life. Maybe it’s the family, he thinks, so he spends time with his wife, [MASK], and the kids, but finds no meaning in that
<name>Tzeitel</name>	Tzeitel	Mary	She smelled of warm cleanliness; her tight hair shone; I wanted to embrace her and comfort her, the way I embraced and comforted [MASK] when she cried after our fights. “This was a few years after the pogrom, in 1908.
<name>Hawaii</name>	Hawaii	Lviv	“Great,” she said. “I’m so happy for you.” I told her [MASK] was depressing; I told her about the natives not using deodorant, the women not shaving their legs, which ought to have discouraged her possible jealousy.
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Roza	I could not feel his breathing. Oh, don’t go, I thought. Please don’t go. But then he sniffled again. Such a boy he was. [MASK] was still sitting at the table, now holding her fork and knife, looking furious.
<name>Anton</name>	Anton	Rambo	What’s with the questions? You are not going to write about this, will you? No, of course not. I’ve got another book to write. [MASK] caught him. He beat him for days, then stuck his gun up his ass and fired.
<name>Tashi</name>	Tashi	Azra	I did not know what to do exactly, so I watched [MASK], did what she did. I folded my hands over my groin, remained standing when the men squatted; I dropped a clod of earth on the coffin after she did.
<name>he</name>	he	Taube	She pulls them back, but not far enough to get out of his grip. “Please. I beg you. We would do anything you ask us to do.” Would you? “We would,” [MASK] says. “Anything within our power.”
<name>Turk</name>	Turk	Rora	[MASK] socked him instantly, stepped in, and closed the door. I remained outside like an experienced accomplice and bodyguard (except for my Samsonite on wheels) and listened, with acute, indecent pleasure, to the sounds of smacking and whimpering and toilet flushing.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Mulligan	“You must consider having a bath, ma’am,” [MASK] says to her back. “You smell like shit.” Last night, the unwieldy, ungainly silence of the city would not allow her to sleep, reminding her of the absence.
<name>Gregor</name>	Gregor	Isador	[MASK] is under a pile of rags, in the airless wardrobe, his limbs benumbed and aching. He listened to her restlessness all night: the creaking of the bed frame, the cracking of the mattress, the crinkling of her writhing body, the music of her nightmare.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Lux	[MASK] would carry our schoolbags. He would sit outside waiting for us, while we were in class, afraid he might be gone before school was out. And once we found him terrified and stuck up in a tree— someone had put him up there.
<name>Lolita</name>	Lolita	Olga	The politsyant circles around the table, picks up a fork, and drops it into a tin bowl to hear it clang. He goes to the bedroom ([MASK]’s heart stops), opens the wardrobe and leaves it open, lifts the veil covering the mirror to look into it, touching his chin.
<name>Nicola</name>	Nicola	Lazarus	On the front page of the Tribune is a photo of [MASK] in profile, his eyes closed, a dark shadow over his eyes and in the hollow of his cheeks, the anarchist type the heading says; numbers are strewn around his face.
<name>Dad</name>	Dad	Elena	Maybe they all lived underground, in hiding from some peril invisible to me. By the time we reached the top of the hill and the asphalt, the car was hot: the smell of [MASK]’s skin turned slightly manure-sour.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Lazarus	Her dress reeks of doleful sweat and policemen’s cigars, her stockings are torn, the heel is broken on her left shoe. He cried when he lost one of the calf-skin gloves he received as a bar mitzvah present. [MASK] in his silly boy-sailor suit.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Mary	I did want to be a perfect husband, and I did love [MASK], her hands bloodied daily by love, but I never stopped being aware of the possibilities that existed beyond the boundaries of our marriage, of the freedom to pursue gratification instead of perfection.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Andriy	The steppe seems exhausted from stretching so far. One feels so small in this place. This must be how settlers felt facing the prairie. But [MASK] finally slowed down and shifted gears and the Ford Feces was now purring and rocking, and my letter transmogrified into a dream.
<name>Meursault</name>	Meursault	luliana	The cemetery-roaming had created an odd intimacy between [MASK] and me, so we went to a coffee shop, in front of which the same gangstermobile as in front of the McDonald’s was parked, but no businessman in sight.
<name>James</name>	James	Rora	Tourists loved the ghosts; the stories inspired them to pull the wallets out of their traveling pouches and tip him in hard currency. This guide and photographer experience helped [MASK] when he slipped through the Tunnel out of the siege in ’94.
<name>the driver</name>	the driver	Rora	There were apple trees among the houses, their fruit-heavy branches bending and breaking—everything seemed forsaken. I didn’t know where I was, nor who the driver was. I snapped out of oblivion when [MASK] lazily said from behind, I think he is planning to murder us.
<name>Susie</name>	Susie	Rora	The Susie grant required no specific itinerary or activity report; I could do whatever I wanted, as long as I eventually showed them something for it. As far as [MASK] was concerned, it was all the same to him, we could go anyplace, do anything, we could just keep going forever.
<name>Salander</name>	Salander	Rora	[MASK] kept drinking his coffee and smoking, his Canon quiet in his lap, as though he could not hear the businessman barking power-wielding Russian into the cell phone, as though he were oblivious to the goon leaning on the car and watching.
<name>Haruki</name>	Haruki	Iuliana	“I think it is about life. I think there is always more life than death,” [MASK] said. “Those who lived are always alive for someone. Those who are alive remember life, not death. And when you are dead nothing happens.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	George	Yet I could recognize [MASK] in her: she was prone to self-righteousness; she snapped at me for no obvious reason, for she held a deep, hurtful grudge she repeatedly refused to talk about; after bad fights she took on grueling extra shifts, as though to expiate her sins.
<name>Rearden</name>	Rearden	Beno	He went completely insane: the government sent, stupidly, a couple of young policemen to arrest him, and he killed them on the spot and sent their balls back in an envelope addressed to their bosses. He wanted [MASK]’s government protector, and he was going to get him.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Mary	[MASK] said: “We can get him when he’s ripe.” But then the captain of the ship shot at him with a sniper rifle and the kid burst like a balloon and, in my dream, I thought: That kid, that’s me.
<name>He</name>	He	Taube	I assure you.” [MASK] sits back down to face her and grabs her hands. She pulls them back, but not far enough to get out of his grip. “Please. I beg you. We would do anything you ask us to do.”
<name>his</name>	his	Taube	He is conspicuous in his determination to stay close, awkwardly looking past the two of them. The crowd presses [MASK]’s body toward her, but he pushes back against it and makes a quick, barely visible, bow. She imagines his heels clacking.
<name>my husband</name>	my husband	Rora	I turned off the TV and listened to [MASK]’s breathing, conjuring up crashing waves. Outside, a man and a woman were talking and giggling, stumbling on something. A dog barked, then squealed; then there was the sound of glass crashing and shattering.
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Rora	I ignored his remark and reported on tomorrow’s transportation arrangements. I turned and faced the wall, stared at the cracks before I tried to sleep, but couldn’t. [MASK] was flipping through the silent channels. I could hear a rare car circling the bronze heroes in the square.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Rora	[MASK] walked out of the bathroom, glanced at the TV disinterestedly, and switched on the light: for a moment, the two narrow cots and the socialist-fifties furniture were overlit like a prison cell, until a couple of bulbs hiccupped and died; the air stank of lead-based paint and suicide.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Isador	His arms were so bony, his elbows were like featherless wingtips. [MASK] cracks one of the eggs against the table edge and, before it can dribble out, he drops the yolk and the white into his mouth. His long throat swells briefly with a gulp.
<name>Walden</name>	Walden	Iuliana	[MASK] had to ring a bell, and a man in tall rubber boots unlocked it, then restretched himself on a bench from which he had obviously just arisen. It was a beautiful sunny day; there was a pleasant whiff of summer abundance in the bright air; birds were deliriously atwitter.
<name>Isaac</name>	Isaac	Lazarus	Upon hearing the news, the Jewess wept: “Leave me alone to die with my grief. All I had in the world was my brother [MASK] and now he is lost forever—I cannot even talk to his grave. I am alone for eternity. ”
<name>David</name>	David	Mary	[MASK] and I, we used to look at our pictures together; it was one of our marital rituals. But we could only go so deep into the common past: its rock bottom was a picture taken by a photographer at the Art Institute the night we met.
<name>his father</name>	his father	Rora	But the collection was not what he wanted [MASK] to see: on his garage wall, lit like an altar, was a steering wheel and a horn, the kind that used to be used for talking to the driver from the backseat.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Lazarus	His voice is deep, his English un-American. She hurries forward, hobbling, catching with her hip a basket laden with fish, their doll eyes bulging. “I’m very sorry about your brother, [MASK],” the man says, panting a bit.
<name>Henri Cartier-Bresson</name>	Henri Cartier-Bresson	Rora	That’s a stupid question, [MASK] said. I take pictures. Why do you take pictures? I take pictures because I like to look at the pictures I take. It seems to me that when people take a picture of something, they instantly forget about it.
<name>Comrade</name>	Comrade	Olga	We are the many, this is the life of the many. Do you know, [MASK], that I do not feel anything in my fingertips after work? When I write, I cannot hold the pen. Whatever I touch feels like an egg.
<name>her</name>	her	Taube	She shakes her head, first slowly, then fast, until the pins loosen and her hair unfurls and now it just whips around. The glass escapes [MASK]’s grip and rolls under the chair, but he pays no heed to it.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Rora	And she would be elsewhere, beyond my reach, leagues upon leagues of distance between us I could never tell her about. For if I did, it would have belied all that we had together and called love. Let’s go and eat, [MASK] said.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Rora	Why would they only be interested in a rabbit from the other side?” I had no answer, as it had never crossed my mind to ask [MASK] such a question; the story and its reality disintegrated right before me.
<name>Mr. Gatsby</name>	Mr. Gatsby	Suljo	And see that bank at the bottom floor? I see it. That’s my bank. And see that silver Rolls-Royce parked in front? I see it. That’s my Rolls-Royce. Congratulations, [MASK] says. You’ve done well for yourself.
<name>he</name>	he	Rora	The waiter listened to him in disbelief, tapping his pen against the notepad, until [MASK] said, sternly: “Write it down.” A scabbily dressed man trembled in the corner; a yuppie in a full-fledged suit was ordering his grand latte; the espresso machine hissed like a geyser.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Taube	[MASK] falls silent. His cheeks are aflame, his knee is hopping in excitement—yet another job well done. He looks out at the small patch of prairie, the dispirited weeds enclosed in meaningless fences; a flock of birds is flapping in disarray across the sky toward the vacant horizon.
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Lazarus	The swine pulled up my dress all the way to cover my face. He was groping for my undergarments. His breath stank of kvass and garlic. [MASK] jumped on his back and dug his nails into his cheeks. The swine stood up and screamed, thrashing.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Olga	[MASK]? She yelps with horror, coils up to protect the good book and her heart from whatever it is that is speaking to her. The voice is sourceless and hoarse, coming from the darkness around her. More lightning, her feet are freezing.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Rora	I knew the joke; it used to be funny. I stretched on the bed; [MASK] got hold of the TV remote: a herd of bicyclists climbing a hill; a man in a gray suit with an eternal wheat field behind him, reporting on the harvest prospects;
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Mary	I returned to my hotel room, stuffed myself with sleeping pills, and called [MASK]. I incoherently told her about the murder and the funeral and then sobbed into the earpiece, while she maintained her silence at the other end.
<name>Vladimir</name>	Vladimir	Noble	It was black-and-white and the glorious absurdity of my predicament was well manifested: kneeling like a klutzy knight in front of an aged lady, touching her shriveled knee with my left hand. I have to say, however, that my face was beautiful. [MASK], I dare suggest.
<name>Algren</name>	Algren	Lazarus	Money castles rose over the space where the Maxwell Street Market used to be, where in [MASK]’s times peddlers had peddled and liquefied rot had clotted in the gutters, where the streets used to teem with people and gossip used to spread like flu.
<name>John</name>	John	Rora	I have to confess that I was aroused by the dispirited cunnilingus on the TV screen as well as by the utopian iniquity [MASK]’s story implied, by the plain possibility of the world governed by the depraved triumvirate of power, survival instinct, and greed.
<name>he</name>	he	Rora	And I no longer noticed when [MASK] took pictures. The presence of his Canon used to turn everything into a possible image for me; I looked at things and faces before us and tried to imagine what they would look like in the photos.
<name>Scotty</name>	Scotty	Rora	How is that related to anything? I have been thinking about the Lazarus stuff. Stop thinking, [MASK] said. Have some coffee. We sipped coffee in silence. Hear my sorrow, may it break your fucking heart, I hummed to myself.
<name>he</name>	he	Lazarus	How can you lie so? And maybe [MASK] shot himself seven times after he delivered the message? What else you want me to believe?” “Allow me to advise you that you ought to recognize we have a bit of advantage in this situation.
<name>Sacco</name>	Sacco	Olga	I am freezing and starving. The shit is rising. It was all your anarchist nonsense, all the angry talk. What was wrong with the life he had? We just wanted better things. We were just reading and talking, [MASK]. I am going to die here.
<name>Tony</name>	Tony	Fitzpatrick	“Things are a wee bit crazy today, don’t you think?” [MASK] says. He lights a cigar and sits in a chair next to her, putting his hand on her knee. “Now is the time for all to stick together.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Isador	“And fast.” The wardrobe door is flung open, the rags are pulled apart, and before [MASK] can think or say anything, a hand grabs him by the scruff of his neck, another quickly covers his mouth, and he is whisked out.
<name>Orwell</name>	Orwell	Miller	Those who dare to object to the farce of political freedom, those who resist the social and economic slavery are branded criminals.” [MASK] leans over to the fat little man, who is fluttering on the tip of his toes, extending his little arms to applaud, and asks: “Who’s this?”
<name>Herbert</name>	Herbert	George	How is your dead? [MASK], her dead, had had his prostate taken out and was currently wearing diapers. Once, I had found him weeping into the open fridge; the tears on his face were emblazed by the fridge light.
<name>whoever is being addressed</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	whoever is being addressed (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Iuliana	Silence. Then she said: “That outburst of bestial anti-Semitism is indelibly stamped upon our national consciousness.” I chortled, but she was not kidding. I said: “No, really. How do you—you, [MASK]—feel about it?
<name>Steve</name>	Steve	Brik	The actors stood in a circle and smoked. The men took off their tall hats and wiped their foreheads with their sleeves, perfectly simultaneously, as though they had rehearsed that, too. Fuck me, I said. See what happens, [MASK]? See where we are now?
<name>he</name>	he	Lazarus	We are tired of the preponderance of lies.” Afterward, [MASK] remained in his seat, as the hall was emptying, still struck by the intensity of the speech, by the thoughts that raced through his head as he took notes.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Beno	He was crazy. They couldn’t control him. They thought they were using him, until it dawned on them he was using them. They thought [MASK] would be more pliant, promised him friendship and steady business, and he went for it.
<name>Communists</name>	Communists	Lazarus	I had plenty more research to do in the libraries, many more books to read about [MASK] and anarchists and the sumptuous palette of American fears. Maybe in two, three years, there was no rush; nobody was waiting for my book to arrive.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Shippy	They are lying. [MASK] killed him because he was there. Now they are going to arrest whoever they don’t like. They are going to clean up what they see as filth. Those they don’t arrest will be grateful and grovel and slobber at their feet.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Taube	[MASK] caresses the brim of his hat, as though the answer is inside it. She sits back into the chair, brushing off the hems of her dress. Biting his lip, he goes on: “Your brother’s body was missing for almost two days.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Rora	A Viennese coffee, then, I said. And one more for him. [MASK] put his black Canon down in his lap, then under the table. He snapped a picture of the graces’ legs, covering the click with a false cough.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Azra	Under the desk, a pair of low-heel shoes, one of them on its side, like a slumberous dog. [MASK] wore white hospital slippers; her feet were long and narrow, her heels small, her ankles frail.
<name>the body</name>	the body	Isador	The casket lid is pried open; the corpse is lifted off [MASK]. The light blinds him again, but when his eyes get used to it, he can see the two men and a few more, standing around, staring into the casket in silence, as though contemplating their own mortal existence.
