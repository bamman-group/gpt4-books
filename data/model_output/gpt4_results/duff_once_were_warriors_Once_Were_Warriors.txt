<name>Geordie</name>	Geordie	Jake	[MASK]’s eyes flashing briefly wide as the sentence tried to cognite in his mind. Then his face relaxing when he rejected the pronouncement as his friend meaning he liked his missus for what she had on live-in tap for his choice of taking — her sex.
<name>Trainspotting</name>	Trainspotting	Jake	(Oh they were listening alright.) I don’t like all that speeches and singing fuckin hymns stuff, thas why I wasn’t there, [MASK] hearing himself explain without consciously deciding he would. Adding, All that bawlin, howlin stuff.
<name>Chigurh</name>	Chigurh	Wankah	Of fear. ([MASK].) Dunno, man. Thas your lookout. You the one called us. And this whispering and low-voiced talking going on and the crowd — not a one ofem — unable to hear it.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Grace	That’s alright then. Was having a bad dream . . . these dudes all kicking and punching me and I couldn’t hurt em with my punches back, like my fists were feathers. Sumpthin else too — oh shit. [MASK]. They’re buryin her today.
<name>Essie</name>	Essie	Grace	But [MASK] wasn’t the all of it. No. A woman’d just woke up one morning and thought: Streets. I’ll go out onto the streets where all this misery’s at and do what I can. She told them, You’re hungry, I’ll feed ya.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Maoris	But it’s something else; maybe it’s us, [MASK], our whole damn race, we’re just a bit lost when it comes to this money thing, how to get things, how to go about borrowing the bread, mortgages and that, to get them.
<name>She</name>	She	Wanna	but I don’t want to be awake. [MASK] die. Closed her eyes, felt immediate pain in one of them. And her heart ached just as bad. She lay there, staring at the ceiling, gathering her thoughts, the events of this early morning rapidly reshaping.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Bennett	Arm coming in (oh hell!) and the kid’s body jolting like a train’d hit it. (You bitch! You fuckin bitch!) [MASK] saying. What the — when the woman came back with another swing.
<name>He's</name>	He's	Jake	I know who he is. [MASK] picking the fulla out in the crowd and the semi-gloom and the smoke, assessing the dude, working out to stay left of that right — if the fulla got to throw it, that is — to lessen the distance it travelled.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jake	[MASK] tooting the horn at them: Eat ya fuckin hearts out! He turned the volume up on the radio. They got the red at the first set of lights, and he waited patiently; drumming fingers on the windowsill, head moving in time to the music.
<name>Tralala</name>	Tralala	Nig	What, lotsa times? Sure. As often as we could. So whassa big deal about it? What, sex? Well we weren’t talkin about fishnchips, mista. It’s good. It feels good. [MASK] stroking her, rubbing against her skin.
<name>He</name>	He	Jake	Cos a man didn’t wake up and have a drink of sherry withem first thing in the morning. That’s why. How come? How come what? You didn’t want a drink of sherry in the morning? [MASK] had to think a moment. . .
<name>Yanks</name>	Yanks	Pakehas	Imagining the novelty of havin not just [MASK] in their midst but posh ones at that; all over em, breathin beer fumes over em, gettin over-friendlv the way they do when they’re drunk, askin em stupid questions, rude questions, insulting questions.
<name>Ray</name>	Ray	Sonny	I c’n sing better’n you. Oh yeah? Yeah. Oh yeah? Yeah. Shit, woman, may’s well bring the fuggin cat in here than listen to you singing. So juss fug up. You fuck up. Don’t play her song, [MASK].
<name>Effi</name>	Effi	Beth	Comes natural to most of us; plays a bigger part in our lives, I think. Though [MASK] couldn’t be entirely sure on that, since she hardly knew a European, not to talk to go to their house see how they lived.
<name>Rosie</name>	Rosie	Grace	And smoke. And the smell of beer: in the bottle, in the glass, in the air from a thousand taken mouthfuls and a thousand breaths. Heyyy! A croaky-voiced man calling at the sight of her. It’s [MASK].
<name>George</name>	George	Toot	So gooooood. (I don’t want this to end.) [MASK]? Wha’? I never want this, you know, this feeling to end. Never. Yeow, G. Never. Never, never, never (never, never . . . )
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	Beth	One more day. (Sorry, darling. Not that I want you to go. But you’re sending a mother mad.) [MASK] buried her face in her hands (and everyone thinking it was her grief, her love for her tragically self-taken daughter.
<name>Rawiri</name>	Rawiri	Beth	And everyone gone quiet. My branch of the Heke line was descended from a slave. A fulla taken prisoner by the enemy when he shoulda — he woulda — been better off dyin. In the fight. [MASK] hearing the rustle of the kids coming forward in their seat.
<name>McClutchy</name>	McClutchy	Fuckem	Next week, next week. In that way everyone knows means ya not gonna pay back. And McClutchy people, they should know that. They know the rules. [MASK]. Doin most of his eating at wherever he landed a bed for the night.
<name>Rangi</name>	Rangi	Jake	Man, now this is what I call the real people, at the prevalence of Maoris out there doing their late-night shopping. Brown faces, brother, [MASK] saying with unnecessary force to a similarly brown-skinned friend. Brown and black and fat and roily polly, hahaha!
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Beth	Then closed — or half closed — her eyes waiting for the retaliation. (But it’s worth it.) Up his arm came, except it went no further. His jaw was trembling though. And [MASK]’s insulting discharge was sliding down his nose.
<name>Lennox</name>	Lennox	Guzzlin	[MASK]. Like our olds, eh? Haha, finding it funny now, after all this time, your olds boozin their lives away and now you doing the same. Man. The SOUNDS, keep on callin to a man, tellin im sumpthin, I dunno.
<name>Rosa</name>	Rosa	Beth	(I know you, mista.) [MASK] ready for him with a defiant look of her own. Him appraising her through those wild brown eyes, that flashing look in em. Coming into the room a few steps. You wan’ somemore, woman?
<name>They</name>	They	Eyes	[MASK] hardly stayed in contact with each other — those that weren’t hidden or lurking behind the shades — just a flicker, a stolen glance, a shy dart of vision that they, none of em, could hold. But things started expanding again.
<name>Hone</name>	Hone	Jake	What about the Maori priest? the woman wanting further to know. [MASK] peering through the crowd to see who it was askin these questions. Askin her: What’s with the Maori priest bit? (I know who it is, it’s
<name>Jimmy</name>	Jimmy	Jake	Half. Half what, man? Ta give the bitch half, and she can’t run a house on half, kick the bitch out. Aw c’mon, [MASK]. No fuckin c’mons, man. But I like my missus.
<name>Jake</name>	Jake	Nig	And, man, all the mad bruthas and sistas standin around and juss dying ta go ta war. [MASK] Heke there with his face tats lookin good, real Maori warrior stuff, man, and soon as the scabs healed it’d look mean as.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Grace	What’ve I got to be sorry for? Tell HIM to say sorry! Next instant the noise ofem all leaving. The door finally slamming. Silence again. [MASK] squeezing shut her eyes, pulling the blanket over her head waiting for the inevitable to follow.
<name>Stevie</name>	Stevie	Stevie	Laughin at that, fallin about emselves at the fuckin joke of it: love. Oh man. It’s more like, you know, belonging. Yet when [MASK] got to the chorus of his I just called, it was when they sang loudest: ... to say: I LOVE YOU!
<name>Ignatius</name>	Ignatius	Jake	(So I could die forem. I could die of just love forem all right here.) Tears in [MASK]’s eyes. Because he (I) was their light, their hope burns eternal flame (who else they got to do this kinda thing forem?)
<name>Trainspotting</name>	Trainspotting	Toot	It ain’t a good way to go . . . But does it take you out of it more than this dope. [MASK]? Take ya right out, enda fuckin story, for some ofem. What, like in — I mean dead, G.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Mark	I, uh . . . Sucking in again. I was so ... so happy, you know, with [MASK] findin this five bucks just when we needed it most . . . And uh, uh . . . Well, I came back and . . .
<name>Teuta</name>	Teuta	Beth	As I slept I was walking in the underworld with plumes in my hair. The tokens, ee, of my gannet feather that I allowed to leave me. My heart string is quite cold — she is taken from me! Aee, [MASK], my niece.
<name>Rosa</name>	Rosa	Nig	Heavee. Then another bro must’ve smacked the lady one because when [MASK] turned she was on the floor bleeding. And all these brown leather jackets and Brown Fist headbands and boots and filthy jeans and shades . . . (Man oh fuckin man, what’ve
<name>Jake</name>	Jake	Jake	Closer. A left — a dozen lefts — from heaven ready to machine gun in the cunt’s face, a dozen rights ready to slip in between lefts (left-left and a RIGHT! And a LEFT HOOK! it was going in [MASK]’s mind.)
<name>Waldo</name>	Waldo	Nig	Oh man, we know bout your sis-ter. [MASK]. Clicking his tongue. (No eyes a kid can read. For a clue.) Her’s was a, you know, a hea-vee trip, man. It was.
<name>Hemi</name>	Hemi	Jake	Five hundred years, that’s what they used to tell us Heke kids. Five hundred years of the slave curse bein on our heads. Teeth clacking together, jaw muscles pulsing out and in. (You never told me, [MASK]. You never told me . . . )
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Beth	And when the kid sighed his last pathetic breath of not utterance but simply expiry, [MASK] did not yet weep. It wasn’t till she heard the distant wail of the ambulance siren, how forlorn was its sound on a cold Pine Block evening.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Grace	Soon as they’ve fed they’ll be falling asleep where they are. [MASK] falling away back into dreams. She thought it was a dream: someone asking for eggs. Then someone, her mother, saying, What, eggs with a boiled feed?
<name>Tracy</name>	Tracy	Loveless	Yet they wouldn’t treat a dog like that a dog was sent to em been kicked and abused all its life and carrying on the kicking but under a different name, and expect the dog to not wanna bite em. Now would they? [MASK], She Stumbled
<name>Draco</name>	Draco	Jake	But even that was just barely enough to control [MASK]. They were near face to face. And everyone in the crowd near pissing emselves with excitement. They’d never known this place so quiet. Not ever. This was unbelievable. Indescribably sweet.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Beth	and she pulled out from under it a plastic bag containing a dress, a change of underpants, and casual shoes. Out in the backyard shed (unused, naturally) [MASK] had another change of clothing, and underneath the house yet another.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Fuckim	And anyway, too many people calling out hello to a man, touching him, to waste his thoughts on a stupid kid who can’t fight to save himself and maybe if they sent him away it’ll do him some good, he might have to toughen up. [MASK].
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Bullshet	. it’s, you know, it’s kinda special. Oh yeah? Yeah. For fullas it is. And for sheilas too. [MASK]. It’s for fullas; all they think about, most ofem. Well I don’t think about just that.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Jake	A bigtime crim comin into my pub thinkin he c’n blow away people and not invite some himself. Same height, maybe an inch shorter. Solid, not lean like [MASK]. Bit of a paunch there, so musta been outta the boob a little while to grow that beer belly.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Beth	I know I didn’t.) But he missed [MASK] sometimes. Maybe more’n sometimes. As the days went by. Then one day struck by an idea. A brilliant idea. Why didn’t I think of it before? Get a job as a bouncer.
<name>Rusty</name>	Rusty	Jake	I’m fifteen. I got a boy fifteen. I know. And you got one in the Brown Fists. How do you know all this, man? [MASK] getting annoyed. Everyone knows it. And the one in the Brown Fists he can rumble.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jake	And pretending to be confused: All these damn gadgets every- where. You worked em out, [MASK]? Looking at him, and he was acting up himself, real casual like: Yeah, sure. Piece a cake. Doing a fancy flick of the volume and the tone controls.
<name>Tralala</name>	Tralala	Jake	People looking at me . . . [MASK] sitting there fuming, hating the people, the fuckin lights for not changing. I’ll spit at anyone they look at me too hard, like I’m a fuckin monkey. Givem monkey.
<name>Georgie</name>	Georgie	Jake	jukebox going up an down in competition depending on what was played; and over at the jukie, look atem, a middle-aged couple dancing out their dumb fantasies and the coloured lights from the jukebox thrown on their oblivious features sort of telling a man sumpthin about em but what, [MASK] did not know.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jake	Yet said out the side of his mouth as though he was snarlin at [MASK]. Y’ can’t do this, man. I got my boys watching ... I lose my, uh, my pride here, man, and I’m coming back with a shotgun.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Boogie	Well, maybe not that, but something high up. Silence. Magistrate had imposed his desire for silence on all. Only his breathing, the odd rustle of clothing, someone shifting position. A cough. A sigh. And [MASK] won’t stop scuffing his feet!
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Boogie	[MASK], pictures of him, of his face and the look of having been let down by her dancing into her mind and being shoved away as soon as they appeared. (I couldn’t help it.) The third bottle.
<name>Blunts</name>	Blunts	Smoke	SOUNDS, bruthas! Sounds. And just the hint of things in the movements of hips, hands, groovin bodies. But too soon yet. Too soon. [MASK] got passed around. Big fat joints half a fuckin yard long. Heads. Sins, man.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jake	And she knew, within her bones, that this was gonna turn out a very nice day. Smiling at him (I can just tell). Past the vacant land and [MASK] saying whyn’t we take a cruise round, and everyone in agreement, why not?
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jake	You tellem ta say that to my face an — / didn’t think it. But they did. Yeah, sure, kid. Sure. Honest, I didn’t. So what else you fullas been saying about me? That you’re tough. Made [MASK] smile.
<name>Legba</name>	Legba	Churchy	Long time no see. We heard you’d turned [MASK]. That kinda shet. Didn’t worry her. In fact, I feel almost superior. Looking at people she knew well, not so well, the all ofem suddenly lighting up in her mind as kinda lost.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Grace	[MASK] heard her — in snatches — this woman her mocking laughter at the mayhem happening around her, sort of like a TV documentary describing a scene, the sequence of mad events taking place before and around her: Yah!
<name>She</name>	She	Grace	Oh . . . ? Ohh, at the person playing the piano when she lifted her head. She can’t be . . . she can’t be any older than me! [MASK] astonished. Crushed. At the girl her ability. But mostly her confidence.
<name>Wesley</name>	Wesley	Bennett	The rot’d set in early. Now look at him, sitting here with his face on permanent S for scared, he’s been running scared all his life. And then [MASK] came out. They here yet? Who? Your mother and father. Or one ofem’d do.
<name>He</name>	He	Jake	[MASK] returning her look. It’s alright, it’s alright, even though he was slowing. Just gonna pull up so someone can see us. Grinning like a little kid with a new Christmas toy. Fair enough. They sat there, engine idling.
<name>Clarisse</name>	Clarisse	G	and — Oh, and I’d grab [MASK] here, a course I would, she’s my only real close friend — and we’ll find somewhere where we can sit down and laugh our heads off at them up there burning, burning . . .
<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Beth	Cos that’s who he spends more time with. At cars pulling up, except when the people got out they didn’t start cartin in crates a beer, nope. So who are they? Oh, must be [MASK]’s people.
<name>Hec</name>	Hec	Jake	And back in the wash-house a fulla’d filled the stone sinks with cold water and filled em with beer bottles. Full ones a course. [MASK] in the kitchen sat at the table sayin, Comin, comin, to all and sundry like he was a fuckin king or sumpthin.
<name>Trainspotter</name>	Trainspotter	Toot	No way, G. Oh, maybe ya right, [MASK]. And spose it wears off, eh? just like this smoke? And, you know, fuckin life comes back stinkin as usual. Gotta go now. Shrugging out of the blanket.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Tellim	We’ll visit soon. [MASK] we got a flattie. Two ofem. Carrying the jugs in two trips back to the table. No one so much as sayin a thank you, kiss my arse, nuthin. Hurting a woman: (I saved for this.
<name>Moira</name>	Moira	Beth	Or I’d hearem: See [MASK] over there, she’s a spunk. That’s what the boys used to say. Made a girl come over all funny, except she didn’t know what it was that felt funny, but now knew it as sex.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Jake	Her heart doing a little leap at that: What, you mean no worries about where the next meal is coming from? Surely not. So she stopped her doings. Looked up at him, his head poking over the washing line wire. No fooling around, [MASK].
<name>He</name>	He	Beth	[MASK] listening quite intently now . . . Hei tuupoho ake te wahine a tangi aurere nei: Making glad the hearts of women who bitterly lament . . . The line of bare lightbulbs glowing brightly down the centre of the room, strung over the cross-members.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Jake	Y’ can’t do this, man. I got my boys watching ... I lose my, uh, my pride here, man, and I’m coming back with a shotgun. Promise you, man. I’ll be back to waste you, [MASK].
<name>Spud</name>	Spud	Dooly	Don’t see no zebra out there, man, only a packa wankers. Next one to look in here and I’m gettin out cloutin the cunt. Hey, eeeasy, brotherrr, [MASK] tried to lighten it up. You not that thirsty are y’?
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Jake	And a coke. Ya like coke? Yeow. What about Christmas, [MASK]? You and, uh, me, we gonna be together then? Well, I don’t think I got nuthin else planned for that day, boy. Tousling the boy’s hair.
<name>Emmett</name>	Emmett	Beth	Grabbing a handful of black dress and squeezing till it hurt and her rage’d subsided. Then another elder stood. He coughed his throat clear. And off he went into a foreign-languaged speech whose only quality [MASK] could hear was that eerie clicking pattern of rhythm.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Grace	Yeah, yeah, I know what it looks like. Think I can’t look in a mirror? So how was school? And where’s [MASK]? Her two youngers’ horror at her facial injuries not lasting long, as she knew it wouldn’t.
<name>God</name>	God	Trambert	To dream. Of peace in the world; like [MASK] must have peace in his nice white world. While here, down there on the street below, are kids practising to be the nothing nobody, but violent, adults of the future.
<name>Willy</name>	Willy	Jake	(Oh [MASK], it’s not just the car and cars, is it? It’s more. If I’d’ve thought you were gonna be a better man, a happier man if only you had a car, I’d’ve worked my butt off till we got the bread to buy it.
<name>Rose</name>	Rose	Grace	And it did. And [MASK] laying there, moving her jaw rapidly but regularly from side to side and making a low ahhhhhh under the blankets as she did. It blocked the sound out completely. Didn’t even allow thoughts of it to enter her head.
<name>anyway</name>	anyway	Grace	And staring into the semi-gloom and the silence and that funny sumpthin that only they could feel because they were, well, you know how it is, kids get to know each other. Specially sad ones. Cunts, aren’t they? Yeah. Who needs parents, [MASK]?
<name>Margo</name>	Margo	Jake	Then the thought was gone (I just want my husband and out of here.) Made for [MASK]’s corner. On the way being stopped by someone, kissed, hugged, asked what she was drinking, being welcomed like a long-lost friend.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Grace	[MASK] said she thinks it was him — Nope.) Unable to believe otherwise now. I’ll killim. Telling herself, Think of the letter, think of the letter, to give herself the courage. Lettin em settle in. Coming down the stairs.
<name>you'd</name>	you'd	Beth’d	Only thing different was the colour of the paint job, and even then you hardly noticed it. And your neighbour through a few inches of wall. And [MASK] watch the kids; the scab-kneed, snot-nosed, ragamuffin-clothed kids of the area doing their various things out there.
<name>Art</name>	Art	Nig	Come onnnn. [MASK] chuckling at her nipple hard to his touch. So ya do want to? she seemed unsure. Oh I might, he teased. And tried to concentrate, not think of burnt children and a dead sister with a broken neck . . .
<name>Rawiri</name>	Rawiri	Nig	They were beating someone. Over and over with steady, rhythmic punches going thud . . . thud . . . thud into the man’s face. [MASK] askin em: Are you my Maori ancestors? Because they looked so much like him, mirrors of himself.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Jake	How much? Oh, you know, you being drunk and saying things to yourself . . . And? And nothing else. [MASK] shrugged, oh well, if he’d been observed in his most private moments so be it. Least he was talking to someone.
<name>Stanley</name>	Stanley	Beth	Uh? How many jugs? Oh, uh . . . (Come on, woman. Get yourself together.) Make it six. Yeh, six’ll do. What of, [MASK]? Eh? What beer? Oh anything.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Beth	[MASK] half resenting the male elders, their privileged position, their secret language that only they and a few others knew; remembering that this very place, its cultural practices, had always been a mystery to a young girl growing up: a males-only domain.
<name>Essie</name>	Essie	Kaput	A member of a race on its way out. [MASK]. My own children. And all that hope a woman’d once had forem. Though it did occur to her that never had she anything specific laid out in her mind as to how to secure this future for her kids.
<name>She</name>	She	Beth	Does it? You got to . . . you got to . . . Well, work for it, [MASK] supposed in her unenlightened state and general misery. Oh, but don’t forget the anger. Hours of it — thinking. Just thinking. And waiting.
<name>Trainspotter</name>	Trainspotter	Toot	And spose it wears off, eh? just like this smoke? And, you know, fuckin life comes back stinkin as usual. Gotta go now. Shrugging out of the blanket. See ya, G. See ya, [MASK]. Hey! Whatcha doin’?
<name>Seamus</name>	Seamus	Jake	[MASK], the father, doing his grieving at where he felt he belonged. Light rain pitterpattering on the iron roof; it’d been like that all day. Ah, the sky weeping. A sure sign from the heavens of exceptional grief. And rightly so.
<name>Me</name>	Me	Jake	Good punch. (Hmm, good punch.) [MASK] taking note of the dude. (I’ll get him after.) Just in case the fulla thought that king-hit made him king. Not here it didn’t. Onward. Then instantly another fight.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Beth	If one went out, the other made sure he/she’d stay. You’d think they had a treasure in there to look after stead of a usual Pine Blocker’s miserable possessions. To hell withem. Though [MASK] needed them. And they both knew it.
<name>Beloved</name>	Beloved	Beth	But still the message not reaching home. So reading it again. Again (Got to get it right.) But each time the message so overwhelming [MASK] could not think straight. As if being dead — by her own hand — is not enough . . .
<name>Bro</name>	Bro	Jeeves	Yet there was another car-crasher up the street a bit who told the driver, Home please, [MASK]. A stranger he was. And the driver laughing, and thus so did his passengers, and he said to the cheeky fulla, Wha’, party at your place?
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Bully	oh but does she know it. And the men yelling and laughing, and saying, Whooaa at probably the combatants falling over them, pushing em away, laughing, Go fight over there, spill your blood on [MASK]’s shirt, I had my share.
<name>Casey</name>	Casey	Jake	You useless at stealing things? No response. But [MASK] knew the kid had been deserted by his fellow streetkids, he’d seen the face when it was a member of a group ofem who’d always kept their distance from his overtures to come talk with him.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jake	She standing there, feeling . . . feeling almost exultant. Go to hell, mista. Neighbours across the street watchin [MASK] walk fuming down the footpath not long after the main lot’d come unexpectedly out; followed him with their eyes, striding up the street.
<name>He</name>	He	Jake	(I think.) [MASK] never completely sure who he was one of. The popularity sometimes adding to his unsureness, hard that it was in knowing people’s motives. Yet accepting, on the surface of his thoughts, that he was one ofem alright.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Beth	[MASK] asking the kids if they liked this rubbish playing on the radio and getting a strong reaction in reply that they sure did and where was she living, it sure wasn’t 1990. No way. So she grinned and said no more.
