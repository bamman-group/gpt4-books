<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Diana	There’s a piece of a plate with a spray of red and yellow ivy on it that is especially beautiful. We keep it in the parlor and we have the fairy glass there, too. The fairy glass is as lovely as a dream. [MASK] found it out in the woods behind their chicken house.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Anne	But just now I don’t know them and they don’t know me, and probably don’t want to know me particularly. Oh, it’s lonesome!” It was lonesomer still when [MASK] found herself alone in her hall bedroom that night at twilight.
<name>Avril</name>	Avril	Diana	“He’s got one about eleven. Her name is [MASK].” “Oh!” with a long indrawing of breath. “What a perfectly lovely name!” “Well now, I dunno. There’s something dreadful heathenish about it, seems to me.
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Marilla	“She is,” said [MASK], “and she’s real steady and reliable now. I used to be afraid she’d never get over her featherbrained ways, but she has and I wouldn’t be afraid to trust her in anything now.”
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Anne	“And that is just why you should be sorry for me,” said [MASK], “because the thought that it is all my own fault is what makes it so hard. If I could blame it on anybody I would feel so much better.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Anne	[MASK] took the dress and looked at it in reverent silence. Oh, how pretty it was--a lovely soft brown gloria with all the gloss of silk; a skirt with dainty frills and shirrings; a waist elaborately pintucked in the most fashionable way, with a little ruffle of filmy lace at the neck.
<name>Becky</name>	Becky	Anne	She was worried about her valuable brooch. What if [MASK] had lost it? And how wicked of the child to deny having taken it, when anybody could see she must have! With such an innocent face, too!
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Anne	What is the matter with them? Aren’t they neat and clean and new?” “Yes.” “Then why don’t you like them?” “They’re--they’re not--pretty,” said [MASK] reluctantly. “Pretty!”
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Anne	And of course he did right to punish her yesterday for giving way to temper. But today it was different. The others who were late should have been punished as well as [MASK], that’s what. And I don’t believe in making the girls sit with the boys for punishment.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Anne	[MASK], bursting into tears, rushed to the hall door, slammed it until the tins on the porch wall outside rattled in sympathy, and fled through the hall and up the stairs like a whirlwind. A subdued slam above told that the door of the east gable had been shut with equal vehemence.
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Marilla	But the worst of imagining things is that the time comes when you have to stop and that hurts.” “You’d better get dressed and come down-stairs and never mind your imaginings,” said [MASK] as soon as she could get a word in edgewise.
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Matthew	She’d go there and catch cold like as not, and have her head filled up with nonsense and excitement. It would unsettle her for a week. I understand that child’s disposition and what’s good for it better than you, [MASK].”
<name>Diana</name>	Diana	Diana	I look at my elbows every morning when I get up to see if any dimples are coming. [MASK] is having a new dress made with elbow sleeves. She is going to wear it to the picnic. Oh, I do hope it will be fine next Wednesday.
<name>Almanzo</name>	Almanzo	Jerry	Wash your face and comb your hair and put on your gingham. I’ll fill a basket for you. There’s plenty of stuff baked in the house. And I’ll get [MASK] to hitch up the sorrel and drive you down to the picnic ground.”
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Anne	[MASK]’s plan was hailed with enthusiasm. The girls had discovered that if the flat were pushed off from the landing place it would drift down with the current under the bridge and finally strand itself on another headland lower down which ran out at a curve in the pond.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Josie	I suppose people of that kind serve some useful purpose in society, but I must say I don’t know what it is any more than I know the use of thistles. Is [MASK] going to teach?” “No, she is going back to Queen’s next year.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Marilla	I hope he has roses like them in heaven. Perhaps the souls of all those little white roses that he has loved so many summers were all there to meet him. I must go home now. [MASK] is all alone and she gets lonely at twilight.”
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Marilla	That was why I confessed. Punish me any way you like but that. Oh, [MASK], please, please, let me go to the picnic. Think of the ice cream! For anything you know I may never have a chance to taste ice cream again.”
<name>Diana</name>	Diana	Diana	[MASK] and I make necklaces of roseberries but what are roseberries compared to amethysts? So I took the brooch. I thought I could put it back before you came home. I went all the way around by the road to lengthen out the time.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Diana	“I’d let myself be torn limb from limb if it would do you any good. But I can’t do this, so please don’t ask it. You harrow up my very soul.” “Just think of all the fun you will miss,” mourned [MASK].
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Diana	But oh, [MASK], tomorrow the geometry exam comes off and when I think of it it takes every bit of determination I possess to keep from opening my Euclid. If I thought the multiplication table would help me any I would recite it from now till tomorrow morning.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Marilla	It seemed to her that she could _not_ speak. Then she said bravely, but with a catch in her voice: “[MASK], _don’t_ think of it. You know he has given you hope.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Anne	You must go to school; but it’s only a fortnight till vacation so it isn’t worth while for you to start before it opens again in September.” “What am I to call you?” asked [MASK].
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Anne	She was looking very pretty herself on this particular night in a dress of the lovely wild-rose pink, from which [MASK] was forever debarred; but she was not to take any part in the concert, so her appearance was of minor importance.
<name>Matthew</name>	Matthew	Matthew	[MASK], with a suspicious moisture in his eyes, got up and went out-of-doors. Under the stars of the blue summer night he walked agitatedly across the yard to the gate under the poplars. “Well now, I guess she ain’t been much spoiled,” he muttered, proudly.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Marilla	“Oh, [MASK], there is something in me today that makes me just love everybody I see,” she exclaimed as she washed the breakfast dishes. “You don’t know how good I feel! Wouldn’t it be nice if it could last?
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Diana	I did not mean to--to--intoxicate [MASK]. How could I? Just imagine if you were a poor little orphan girl that kind people had adopted and you had just one bosom friend in all the world. Do you think you would intoxicate her on purpose?
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Anne	Why, child, whatever is the matter?” “I’m crying,” said [MASK] in a tone of bewilderment. “I can’t think why. I’m glad as glad can be. Oh, _glad_ doesn’t seem the right word at all.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Marilla	There are so many things to be thought over and decided when you’re beginning to grow up. It keeps me busy all the time thinking them over and deciding what is right. It’s a serious thing to grow up, isn’t it, [MASK]?
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Anne	Again that sudden sensation of startling sweetness thrilled her. She was secretly vastly pleased at [MASK]’s impulsive caress, which was probably the reason why she said brusquely: “There, there, never mind your kissing nonsense. I’d sooner see you doing strictly as you’re told.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Marilla	[MASK] looked rather relieved. “So you do know something then, thank goodness! You’re not quite a heathen. Where did you learn that?” “Oh, at the asylum Sunday-school. They made us learn the whole catechism.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Anne	[MASK] felt that she could not bear it and it would be of no use to try. Her whole being seethed with shame and anger and humiliation. At first the other scholars looked and whispered and giggled and nudged.
<name>Leonard</name>	Leonard	Anne	“I haven’t got the grit to go there and look at a paper in cold blood,” he told [MASK]. “I’m just going to wait until somebody comes and tells me suddenly whether I’ve passed or not.”
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Gil	I won’t be able to go around for six or seven weeks and I’ll miss the new lady teacher. She won’t be new any more by the time I’m able to go to school. And [MASK]--everybody will get ahead of me in class.
<name>Diana</name>	Diana	Diana	But oh, I shall be so glad when I can go to school for I’ve heard such exciting things about the new teacher. The girls all think she is perfectly sweet. [MASK] says she has the loveliest fair curly hair and such fascinating eyes.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	Oh, [MASK], how could you pretend not to listen to him? When he came to the line, ‘_There’s Another_, not _a sister_,’ he looked right down at you.”
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Marilla	“It won’t be the same thing as having her here all the time,” sighed [MASK] gloomily, determined to enjoy her luxury of grief uncomforted. “But there--men can’t understand these things!”
<name>Diana</name>	Diana	Diana	But alas, he had forgotten he couldn’t swim, and they were both drowned, clasped in each other’s arms. Their bodies were washed ashore soon afterwards. They were buried in the one grave and their funeral was most imposing, [MASK].
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Susan	And [MASK] said, ‘Yes--no--I don’t know--let me see’--and there they were, engaged as quick as that. But I didn’t think that sort of a proposal was a very romantic one, so in the end I had to imagine it out as well as I could.
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Marilla	[MASK] thought it all rank foolishness. “It’s just filling your heads up with nonsense and taking time that ought to be put on your lessons,” she grumbled. “I don’t approve of children’s getting up concerts and racing about to practices.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Emily	“Thank you so much. I don’t believe you ought to be so kind to me--it’s making it harder every day for me to go away.” The green dress was made up with as many tucks and frills and shirrings as [MASK]’s taste permitted.
<name>Diana</name>	Diana	Diana	Three mean ‘yes’ and four ‘no.’ Five mean, ‘Come over as soon as possible, because I have something important to reveal.’ [MASK] has just signaled five flashes, and I’m really suffering to know what it is.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Marilla	“Oh, [MASK]--and what happened?--why didn’t you--” “We had a quarrel. I wouldn’t forgive him when he asked me to. I meant to, after awhile--but I was sulky and angry and I wanted to punish him first.
<name>Matthew</name>	Matthew	Matthew	“I’m extremely grateful to you and [MASK]. And I’ll study as hard as I can and do my very best to be a credit to you. I warn you not to expect much in geometry, but I think I can hold my own in anything else if I work hard.”
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Anne	[MASK] smiled wanly. “Pretty well. I imagine a good deal, and that helps to pass the time. Of course, it’s rather lonesome. But then, I may as well get used to that.”
<name>Diana</name>	Diana	Diana	I am _not_ superstitious and I know it can make no difference. But still I wish it wasn’t thirteen.” “I do wish I was going in with you,” said [MASK]. “Wouldn’t we have a perfectly elegant time?
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Matthew	But things would only go behind worse and worse all the time, till nobody would want to buy it. Every cent of our money went in that bank; and there’s some notes [MASK] gave last fall to pay.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Anne	Well, I suppose I shall just have to resign myself to it.” “But you have such dimples,” said [MASK], smiling affectionately into the pretty, vivacious face so near her own. “Lovely dimples, like little dents in cream.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Anne	“Oh, but there’s such a difference between saying a thing yourself and hearing other people say it,” wailed [MASK]. “You may know a thing is so, but you can’t help hoping other people don’t quite think it is.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Marilla	“Oh, [MASK], isn’t it too late?” “No, it’s only two o’clock. They won’t be more than well gathered yet and it’ll be an hour before they have tea. Wash your face and comb your hair and put on your gingham.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Diana	[MASK] was sitting on the sofa, reading a book which she dropped when the callers entered. She was a very pretty little girl, with her mother’s black eyes and hair, and rosy cheeks, and the merry expression which was her inheritance from her father.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Diana	“I thought you _liked_ me of course but I never hoped you _loved_ me. Why, [MASK], I didn’t think anybody could love me. Nobody ever has loved me since I can remember. Oh, this is wonderful!
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Anne	The Lord’s Prayer is on it and you’ll devote your spare time this afternoon to learning it off by heart. There’s to be no more of such praying as I heard last night.” “I suppose I was very awkward,” said [MASK] apologetically, “
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Marilla	What time did I tell you to come in?” “Two o’clock--but isn’t it splendid about the picnic, [MASK]? Please can I go? Oh, I’ve never been to a picnic--I’ve dreamed of picnics, but I’ve never--”
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Jane	“Well,” said [MASK] with a sigh, “I feel as if I’d lived many moons since the morning. I ought to be home studying my Virgil--that horrid old professor gave us twenty lines to start in on tomorrow.
<name>Dr. Watson</name>	Dr. Watson	Marilla	She was a tall black-eyed, black-haired woman, with a very resolute mouth. She had the reputation of being very strict with her children. “How do you do, [MASK]?” she said cordially. “Come in.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Anne	The latter was, as she admitted, growing old, but her black eyes were not dim nor the vigor of her tongue in the least abated. But she never sharpened the latter on [MASK], who continued to be a prime favorite with the critical old lady.
<name>Herbert</name>	Herbert	Marilla	“You’re sure it hasn’t fell down behind the bureau?” was the only suggestion he could offer. “I’ve moved the bureau and I’ve taken out the drawers and I’ve looked in every crack and cranny” was [MASK]’s positive answer.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Marilla	[MASK] was out milking and I fully intended to ask her when she came in if I’d give the sauce to the pigs; but when she did come in I was imagining that I was a frost fairy going through the woods turning the trees red and yellow, whichever they wanted to be,
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Anne	“What a girl you were for making mistakes in them days, [MASK]. You were always getting into scrapes. I did use to think you were possessed. Do you mind the time you dyed your hair?” “Yes, indeed.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Anne	I don’t believe in pampering vanity, [MASK], I’ll tell you that right off. Those dresses are good, sensible, serviceable dresses, without any frills or furbelows about them, and they’re all you’ll get this summer.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Marilla	It will be better for you than straining your eyes over that book. She reads entirely too much--” this to [MASK] as the little girls went out--“and I can’t prevent her, for her father aids and abets her. She’s always poring over a book.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Anne	I had my suspicions of that bak--” “Baking powder fiddlesticks! Go and bring me the bottle of vanilla you used.” [MASK] fled to the pantry and returned with a small bottle partially filled with a brown liquid and labeled yellowly, “Best Vanilla.”
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Anne	“It does seem as if it was the end of everything, doesn’t it?” she said dismally. “You oughtn’t to feel half as badly as I do,” said [MASK], hunting vainly for a dry spot on her handkerchief.
<name>Diana</name>	Diana	Diana	Young men are all very well in their place, but it doesn’t do to drag them into everything, does it? [MASK] and I are thinking seriously of promising each other that we will never marry but be nice old maids and live together forever.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Marilla	Her face was pale and tense. “Oh, [MASK], you’d be excited, too, if you were going to meet a little girl you hoped to be your bosom friend and whose mother mightn’t like you,” she said as she hastened to get her hat.
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Marilla	“I don’t believe in imagining things different from what they really are,” retorted [MASK]. “When the Lord puts us in certain circumstances He doesn’t mean for us to imagine them away. And that reminds me.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Anne	“It’s five miles; and as you’re evidently bent on talking you might as well talk to some purpose by telling me what you know about yourself.” “Oh, what I _know_ about myself isn’t really worth telling,” said [MASK] eagerly.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Diana	“Why it’s dreadfully wicked to swear,” she said rebukingly. “Oh no, not my kind of swearing. There are two kinds, you know.” “I never heard of but one kind,” said [MASK] doubtfully. “There really is another.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Anne	“I--I--must go right home.” “Oh, you mustn’t dream of going home without your tea,” cried [MASK] in distress. “I’ll get it right off--I’ll go and put the tea down this very minute.”
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Marilla	“But have you ever noticed one encouraging thing about me, [MASK]? I never make the same mistake twice.” “I don’t know as that’s much benefit when you’re always making new ones.”
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Anne	“I’m sure the Debating Club is a most respectable affair,” pleaded [MASK]. “I’m not saying it isn’t. But you’re not going to begin gadding about to concerts and staying out all hours of the night. Pretty doings for children.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Marilla	A haunted wood is so very romantic, [MASK]. We chose the spruce grove because it’s so gloomy. Oh, we have imagined the most harrowing things. There’s a white lady walks along the brook just about this time of the night and wrings her hands and utters wailing cries.
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Marilla	[MASK] is a very generous woman. She said we could have fruit cake and cherry preserves for tea. But it isn’t good manners to tell your company what you are going to give them to eat, so I won’t tell you what she said we could have to drink.
<name>Matthew</name>	Matthew	Matthew	And mind, [MASK], you’re not to go interfering with my methods. Perhaps an old maid doesn’t know much about bringing up a child, but I guess she knows more than an old bachelor. So you just leave me to manage her.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Diana	It makes me thrill to think of it. Your solo was perfectly elegant, [MASK]. I felt prouder than you did when it was encored. I just said to myself, ‘It is my dear bosom friend who is so honored.’”
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Anne	“If I had been the boy you sent for,” said [MASK] wistfully, “I’d be able to help you so much now and spare you in a hundred ways. I could find it in my heart to wish I had been, just for that.”
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Marilla	I wish I had dimples in my cheeks, [MASK]. I’m not half so skinny as I was when I came here, but I have no dimples yet. If I had perhaps I could influence people for good.
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Marilla	what, and I’ve ached to tell her so plainly a dozen times. I’ve held my tongue though, for I can see [MASK] doesn’t want advice and she thinks she knows more about bringing children up than I do for all she’s an old maid.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Anne	“We were born to be good friends, [MASK]. You’ve thwarted destiny enough. I know we can help each other in many ways. You are going to keep up your studies, aren’t you? So am I. Come, I’m going to walk home with you.”
<name>Matthew</name>	Matthew	Matthew	When [MASK] and I took you to bring up we resolved we would do the best we could for you and give you a good education. I believe in a girl being fitted to earn her own living whether she ever has to or not.
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Marilla	It’s almost a pity, isn’t it, now that I’m really growing big enough to say them if I did want to. It’s fun to be almost grown up in some ways, but it’s not the kind of fun I expected, [MASK].
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Marilla	I can’t cook, as you know, [MASK], and--and--I don’t mind going to a picnic without puffed sleeves so much, but I’d feel terribly humiliated if I had to go without a basket.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Marilla	It would have been such a romantic experience to have been nearly drowned. It would be such a thrilling tale to tell. And we had the ice cream. Words fail me to describe that ice cream. [MASK], I assure you it was sublime.”
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Marilla	“She’s got too much to say,” thought [MASK], “but she might be trained out of that. And there’s nothing rude or slangy in what she does say. She’s ladylike. It’s likely her people were nice folks.”
<name>Pollyanna</name>	Pollyanna	Anne	Just the same, [MASK] has no business to leave the house like this when I told her she was to stay home this afternoon and look after things. I must say, with all her faults, I never found her disobedient or untrustworthy before and I’m real sorry to find her so now.”
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Marilla	Even although we meet as strangers now I still love her with an _inextinguishable_ love. It makes me very sad at times to think about her. But really, [MASK], one can’t stay sad very long in such an interesting world, can one?”
<name>Pollyanna</name>	Pollyanna	Anne	“We’re not talking about poetry, [MASK]--we are talking about saying your prayers. Don’t you know it’s a terrible wicked thing not to say your prayers every night? I’m afraid you are a very bad little girl.”
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Anne	But her conscience pricked her. “[MASK], you do beat all! But I was wrong--I see that now. I shouldn’t have doubted your word when I’d never known you to tell a story.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Anne	[MASK], clinging desperately to her precarious foothold, saw their flying forms and heard their shrieks. Help would soon come, but meanwhile her position was a very uncomfortable one. The minutes passed by, each seeming an hour to the unfortunate lily maid.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Anne	[MASK] flew to the door, face alight, eyes glowing. On the very threshold she stopped short, wheeled about, came back and sat down by the table, light and glow as effectually blotted out as if some one had clapped an extinguisher on her.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Anne	I’m so afraid I’ll do something silly or forget to do something I should do. Would it be good manners to take a second helping of anything if you wanted to _very_ much?” “The trouble with you, [MASK], is that you’re thinking too much about yourself.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Anne	Wouldn’t you just love to be rich, girls?” “We _are_ rich,” said [MASK] staunchly. “Why, we have sixteen years to our credit, and we’re happy as queens, and we’ve all got imaginations, more or less.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Anne	“Oh, of course he’s good,” agreed [MASK], “but he doesn’t seem to get any comfort out of it. If I could be good I’d dance and sing all day because I was glad of it.
<name>Eben</name>	Eben	Marilla	“It’s a big tree,” said [MASK], “and it blooms great, but the fruit don’t amount to much never--small and wormy.” “Oh, I don’t mean just the tree; of course it’s lovely--yes, it’s
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Diana	Let’s run a race and see who’ll get to the bed first.” The suggestion appealed to [MASK]. The two little white-clad figures flew down the long room, through the spare-room door, and bounded on the bed at the same moment.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Matthew	Of course it wasn’t exactly necessary to starch [MASK]’s handkerchiefs! And most people when they put a pie in the oven to warm up for dinner take it out and eat it when it gets hot instead of leaving it to be burned to a crisp.
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Marilla	“I apologized pretty well, didn’t I?” she said proudly as they went down the lane. “I thought since I had to do it I might as well do it thoroughly.” “You did it thoroughly, all right enough,” was [MASK]’s comment.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Anne	“I wish you had,” sighed [MASK], “because then you’d be able to sympathize with me. You can’t sympathize properly if you’ve never studied it. It is casting a cloud over my whole life.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Anne	[MASK] looked thoughtful. “I read in a book once that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet, but I’ve never been able to believe it. I don’t believe a rose _would_ be as nice if it was called a thistle or a skunk cabbage.
