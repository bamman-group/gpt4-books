<name>Death</name>	Death	Ther	"Afraid to risk gettin' there. An' the town's full of rebels who need hosses." "Then straight north?" "Shore man, you're crazy. [MASK]'s no water, no grass for a hundred miles.
<name>George</name>	George	Belding	"He's asleep yet, wife," replied [MASK]. "Guess he was pretty much knocked out.... I'll close the door there so we won't wake him." There were slow, soft steps, then the door softly closed.
<name>El Pípila</name>	El Pípila	Quinteros	In the hearts of the people he stands next to the national idol--the bull-fighter, the matador. The race has a wild, barbarian, bloody strain. Take [MASK], for instance. He was a peon, a slave. He became a famous bandit.
<name>Johnsy</name>	Johnsy	Mercedes	But his skin was cool. The heat came from an inward burning. He stopped the horse and raised the coat up, and helped [MASK] put it on. "I should have thought of you," he said. "But I seemed to feel warm...
<name>Montezuma</name>	Montezuma	Thorne	A Mexican with a blanket round his shoulders stood in the front entrance. Back toward the patio there were sounds of boots on the stone floor. Shadows flitted across that end of the corridor. [MASK] entered a huge chamber which was even more poorly lighted than the hall.
<name>General Pershing</name>	General Pershing	Belding	"Don't give them an inch. We're in bad, and the bigger bluff we put up the more likely our chance." "[MASK], you're an officer of the United States. Mexicans are much impressed by show of authority.
<name>John</name>	John	Gale	Not for some distance beyond, where the street ended in open country, did they halt to wait. The desert began here. [MASK] felt the soft sand under his feet and saw the grotesque forms of cactus. Then he came up with the fugitives.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Nell	She's wilder than any antelope out there on the desert. [MASK]'s nearly twenty now, and so far as we know she's never cared a rap for any fellow. And she's just as gay and full of the devil as she was at fourteen.
<name>daughter</name>	daughter	Nell	Forlorn and lonely, yes, especially for women like my wife and [MASK]; but I like it.... And between you and me, boys, I've got something up my sleeve. There's gold dust in the arroyos, and there's mineral up in the mountains.
<name>Stonewall</name>	Stonewall	Gale	The blow swept him backward against his men. Then [MASK]'s heavy body, swiftly following with the momentum of that rush, struck the little group of rebels. They went down with table and chairs in a sliding crash.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Senorita	As he bent over her hands and kissed them he seemed to feel himself renewed, remade. "[MASK]," he said, "I am happy to be your servant. I can conceive of no greater pleasure than giving the service you require." "
<name>her</name> (Note: There is no proper name that fits the description in this sentence, so the answer is a pronoun.)	her (Note: There is no proper name that fits the description in this sentence, so the answer is a pronoun.)	Dick	Her sweet, red lips, with the soft, perfect curve, had always fascinated [MASK], and now drew him irresistibly. He had always been consumed with a desire to kiss her, and now he was overwhelmed with his opportunity. It would be a terrible thing to do,
<name>David</name>	David	Gale	That was where his old training, the higher order of human feeling, made impossible the following of any elemental instinct of self-preservation. All the same, [MASK] knew he multiplied his perils a hundredfold by burdening himself with a crippled Indian.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Gale	[MASK] felt a ripple pass over him that was at once a shudder and a contraction of muscles. Used as he was to the desert and its oppression, why should he feel to-night as if the weight of its lava and the burden of its mystery were bearing him down?
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Gale	He fixed a changeless, gleaming gaze on the slow descent; but did not seem to look afar. Suddenly he uttered his strange cry--the one [MASK] considered involuntary, or else significant of some tribal trait or feeling. It was incomprehensible, but no one could have doubted its potency.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Cameron	He had faith--he saw into the future. The fateful threads of the past, so inextricably woven with his error, wound out their tragic length here in this forlorn desert. [MASK] then took a little tin box from his pocket, and, opening it, removed a folded certificate.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Laddy	Presently the glass became stationary. "I see half a dozen small animals, brown in color. They look like sheep. But I couldn't distinguish mountain sheep from antelope." "Shore they're bighorn," said [MASK].
<name>George</name>	George	Dick	You've got your girl, an' this can be a honeymoon. Now with a few tools an' little material see what a grand house you can build for your wife. [MASK], you're lucky, too.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Gale	[MASK] shuddered. The Indian was digging in the sand and dust under the shelving wall. He threw out an object that rang against the stone. It was a belt buckle. He threw out old shrunken, withered boots. He came upon other things,
<name>he</name>	he	Gale	Yet the desert stretched away down between and beyond them. When the sun set and [MASK] could not see so far, he felt a relief. That grand and austere attraction of distance gone, he saw the desert nearer at hand--the valley at his feet.
<name>Yakima</name>	Yakima	Yaqui	The sun hung red in a golden sky. The last the watchers saw of [MASK] was when he rode across a ridge and stood silhouetted against the gold of desert sky--a wild, lonely, beautiful picture. Then he was gone.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Yaqui	He tapped the breech of his Winchester with a sinewy brown hand, and he did not appear to be addressing any one in particular. "[MASK]'s opened the ball. Look up your pardners there, gents, an' get ready to dance."
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Cameron	Since then I have taken to the wilds, hunting gold on the desert." "Yes, it's the old, old story, only sadder, I think," said [MASK]; and his voice was strained and unnatural.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Gale	For the first time in hours, as it seemed, [MASK] took note of the physical aspect of his surroundings. He began to look upon them without keen gaze strained for crouching form, or bobbing head, or spouting carbine.
<name>her</name> (Note: There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to a female person who is not explicitly named in the context.)	her (Note: There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to a female person who is not explicitly named in the context.)	Nell	You've always been strange, even silly, about that. I've done my best for [MASK]--loved her as if she were my own daughter. I've changed many business plans to suit your whims. There are rough times ahead, maybe.
<name>Godfrey</name>	Godfrey	Richard--	Now I see no need for further delay. My stay here has greatly benefited my health. I shall never forget your hospitality. This Western trip would have made me a new man if--only--[MASK]" "Sure.
<name>The Lone Ranger</name>	The Lone Ranger	Gale	But he knew he had gone back to the old desert mood. He knew something hung in the balance. No accident, no luck, no debt-paying Indian could account wholly for that moment. [MASK] knew he held in his hands more than gold.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Dick	Then he bent over, listening. The beautiful notes of the bugle floated out of the darkness, clearer, sharper, faster. "It's a call, [MASK]! It's a call!" he cried.
<name>Talking God</name>	Talking God	Yaqui	[MASK] had returned to his own--the great spaces, the desolation, the solitude--to the trails he had trodden when a child, trails haunted now by ghosts of his people, and ever by his gods.
<name>Cowboy</name>	Cowboy	Jim	"When'll that be?" inquired [MASK]. "Soon as it's light enough in the mornin'. That Greaser outfit will hang till to-morrow. There's no sure water ahead for two days, you remember.
<name>John</name>	John	Gale	It was as if these aged walls resented the violating of their silent sanctity. [MASK] felt himself a man, a thing alive, something superior to all this savage, dead, upflung world of iron, a master even of all this grandeur and sublimity because he had a soul.
<name>John</name>	John	Laddy	[MASK], you're right," he replied, presently. "I've got to stand it. I can't leave the women and my property. But it's sure tough. I'm sore way down deep, and nothin' but blood would ever satisfy me."
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Cameron	Here in the desert he was confronted by the spectacle of a splendid man, a father, wasting his life because he could not forget--because there was nothing left to live for. [MASK] understood better now why his comrade was drawn by the desert. "
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Dick	"If there's only grass for the hosses! We can't get out of here without hosses. [MASK], take the Indian an' scout down the arroyo. To-day I seen the hosses were gettin' fat. Gettin' fat in this desert!
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Gale	Probably for her the night had terrors beyond [MASK]'s power to comprehend. He looked down into the desert, and would have felt no surprise at anything hidden away among the bristling cactus, the dark, winding arroyos, the shadowed rocks with their moonlit tips, the ragged plain leading to the black bold mountains.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Gale	There was no other sound. The coyotes had ceased their hungry cries. [MASK] dropped to sleep, and slept soundly during the first half of the night; and after that he seemed always to be partially awake, aware of increasing cold and damp.
<name>me</name>	me	Belding	Think of that! He makes the most ridiculous excuses. He bothers mother to death. I feel like a poor little rabbit holed by a hound. And I daren't peep out." Somehow the thing struck [MASK] as funny, and he laughed.
<name>Buffalo Bill</name>	Buffalo Bill	Gale	Closer and closer crept that white, smoothly gliding, beautiful machine of speed. Then, like one white flash following another, the two horses gleamed down the bank of a wash and disappeared in clouds of dust. [MASK] watched with strained and smarting eyes.
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Gale	[MASK] saw a heavy man of medium height. His head was large and covered with grizzled locks. He wore a short-cropped mustache and chin beard. His skin was brown, and his dark eyes beamed with a genial light.
<name>Aragorn</name>	Aragorn	Gale	One stood up, his back to the fire; another sat with shoulders enveloped in a blanket, and the third lounged in the sand, his feet almost in the blaze. They had cast off belts and weapons. A glint of steel caught [MASK]'s eye.
<name>anyone</name>	anyone	Cameron	The sand grew moist, then wet. At the bottom of the deep pit the sand coarsened, gave place to gravel. Finally water welled in, a stronger volume than [MASK] ever remembered finding on the desert. It would soon fill the hole and run over.
<name>Hazel</name>	Hazel	Gale	Rabbits were frisking in the short willows, and some were so tame he could have kicked them. [MASK] walked swiftly for a goodly part of the distance, and then, when he saw blue smoke curling up above the trees, he proceeded slowly, with alert eye and ear.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	George	How good it was to meet a friend--some one to whom to talk! He had never appreciated his loneliness until that moment. "[MASK], how I ever drifted down here I don't know. I didn't exactly quarrel with the governor.
<name>Black Beauty</name>	Black Beauty	Gale	Other horses looked in the same direction, and their ears went up, and they, too, whistled. [MASK] knew that other horses or men, very likely both, were approaching. But the Mexicans did not hear the alarm, or show any interest if they did.
<name>he</name>	he	Ladd	He began to climb. The horse was superb, infinitely more courageous than his rider. Zigzag they went up and up, and when [MASK] reached the edge of the slope they were high along the cracked and guttered rampart.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Gale	This time it caught in a crack. He pulled hard. Then, holding to the lasso, he walked up the steep slant, hand over hand on the rope. When he reached the shelf he motioned for [MASK] to follow.
<name>he</name>	he	Gale	The field of craters rose in high, dark wheels toward the dominating peaks. When [MASK] withdrew his gaze from the magnitude of these spaces and heights the crater beneath him seemed dwarfed. Yet while he gazed it spread and deepened and multiplied its ragged lines.
<name>Blackie</name>	Blackie	Gale	It was a fleet, beautiful, magnificent race. [MASK] thrilled and exulted and yelled as his horse settled into a steadily swifter run and began to gain. The dust rolled in a funnel-shaped cloud from the flying hoofs.
<name>Lawrence</name>	Lawrence	Cameron	Did not the desert magnify men? [MASK] believed that wild men in wild places, fighting cold, heat, starvation, thirst, barrenness, facing the elements in all their ferocity, usually retrograded, descended to the savage, lost all heart and soul and became mere brutes.
<name>Yakima</name>	Yakima	Yaqui	"[MASK] will slip through. If we thank any lucky stars let it be for the Indian.... Now, boys, put on your thinking caps. You'll take eight horses, the pick of my bunch. You must pack all that's needed for a possible long trip.
<name>him</name>	him	Gale	He disappeared in the gloom. The sound of his dull footfalls gradually died away. For a moment the desert silence oppressed [MASK]. He was unaccustomed to such strange stillness. There was a low stir of sand, a rustle of stiff leaves in the wind.
<name>John</name>	John	Jim	"I reckon if you'll pull around to the east an' search under that long wall of lava--there--you'll see what I see," added [MASK]. The glass climbed and circled, wavered an instant, then fixed steady as a rock.
<name>Binti</name>	Binti	Gale	Certainly it already took a grim resolution to raise the heavy .405. His shot killed the big leader. The others bounded away with remarkable nimbleness. [MASK] used up the remaining four shells to drop the second ram, and by the time he had reloaded the others were out of range.
<name>Tonto</name>	Tonto	Ladd	I mean to tell you just that there," replied the ranger. "I'll--I'll bet a--" "We're wastin' time," curtly interrupted [MASK]. "You can gamble on this if you want to.
<name>He</name>	He	Dick	When he again unclosed his eyes the room was sunny, and cool with a fragrant breeze that blew through the open door. [MASK] felt better; but he had no particular desire to move or talk or eat. He had, however, a burning thirst.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Rojas	She had a gun. He doubted not at all that she would use it. But, remembering her terror of this savage, he feared for her. [MASK] reached the level of the ledge. He halted. He crouched. It was the act of a panther.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Thorne	He rose abruptly; he gave the waiter money to go for drinks; he looked into the saloon, and then into the street. On this side of the house there was a porch opening on a plaza with trees and shrubbery and branches. [MASK] peered out one window, then another.
<name>Rainsford</name>	Rainsford	Gale	The splendid leader stepped closer, his round, protruding amber eyes, which [MASK] could now plainly see, intent upon that fatal red flag. Like automatons the other four crowded into his tracks. A few little slow steps, then the leader halted.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Ladd	He had that kind of power. The first thing [MASK] asked was to have the store of food that remained spread out upon a tarpaulin. Assuredly, it was a slender enough supply. The ranger stood for long moments gazing down at it.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Thorne	He seemed to have lost the faculty of estimating time. A long while, strong in its effect upon him, appeared to have passed since he had met [MASK]. He accepted things as he felt them, and repudiated his intelligence. His old inquisitive habit of mind returned.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Lash	[MASK], what do you say?" "It's been gettin' hotter round this Greaser corral for some weeks," replied the other cowboy. "If that two-bit of a garrison surrenders, there's no tellin' what'll happen.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Gale	In the corridor [MASK] stopped long enough to pull on a pair of heavy gloves, to muss his hair, and disarrange his collar. Then he stepped into the restaurant, went through, and halted in the door leading into the saloon.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Carter	I've been down the road. An' I found hoss tracks an' steer tracks goin' across the line. But I seen no sign of raiders till this mornin'. Slept at [MASK]'s last night. That raid the other day cleaned him out.
<name>Clarisse</name>	Clarisse	Gale	The sultry air seemed to be laden with some burden or quality that was at once composed of heat, menace, color, and silence. Even the light glancing up from the lava seemed red and the silence had substance. Sometimes [MASK] felt that it was unbearable.
<name>Dr. T.J. Eckleburg</name>	Dr. T.J. Eckleburg	Belding	He saw [MASK] lean over him, feel his face, and speak, and then everything seemed to drift, not into darkness, but into some region where he had dim perceptions of gray moving things, and of voices that were remote.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Belding	The red left his face. His son slunk back against the fence. "I say you never held this secret over the heads of my wife and her daughter?" thundered [MASK]. He had his answer in the gray faces, in the lips that fear made mute.
<name>God</name>	God	Yaqui	Now as to the future, I'd like to know mebbe as well as you if we're ever to get home. Only bein' what I am, I say, Quien sabe? But somethin' tells me [MASK] knows.
<name>Tess</name>	Tess	Mercedes	The priest has betrayed me or has been stopped. [MASK] is here alone, waiting, absolutely dependent upon me to save her from--from.... She's the sweetest, loveliest girl!... In a few moments--sooner or later there'll be hell here!
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Nell	"I knew she'd say that.... My dear wife, I would be simply overcome with joy if [MASK] did fall in love once. Real good and hard! She's wilder than any antelope out there on the desert.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Rojas	Then there was a long silence during which the men gazed into the fire. Each, perhaps, had some vague conception of the enormity of [MASK]'s love or hate--some faint and amazing glimpse of the gulf of human passion.
<name>The man</name>	The man	Cameron	Hello there," the man called, as he came to a halt and gazed about him. "I saw your fire. May I make camp here?" [MASK] came forth out of the shadow and greeted his visitor, whom he took for a prospector like himself.
<name>John</name>	John	Gale	The Indian had brought with him a red scarf and a mesquite branch. He tied the scarf to the stick, and propped this up in a crack of the lava. The scarf waved in the wind. That done, the Indian bade [MASK] watch.
<name>Jean</name>	Jean	Gale	She seemed a white-faced girl now, with staring, frightened black eyes that flashed up at him. If the loneliness, the silence, the desert, the unknown dangers of the night affected him, what must they be to this hunted, driven girl? [MASK]'s heart swelled.
<name>Prospector</name>	Prospector	Cameron	The campfire burst into a bright blaze, and by its light [MASK] saw a man whose gray hair somehow did not seem to make him old, and whose stooped shoulders did not detract from an impression of rugged strength. "Find any mineral?"
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Mercedes	[MASK] smiled and lightly thanked him in Spanish. The flash of mood was in direct contrast to the appealing, passionate, and tragic states in which he had successively viewed her; and it gave him a vivid impression of what vivacity and charm she might possess under happy conditions.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dick	The hum of the many voices grew louder, and when [MASK] lurched against a table, overturning it and spilling glasses into the laps of several Mexicans, there arose a shrill cry. He had succeeded in attracting attention; almost every face turned his way.
<name>McGill</name>	McGill	Gale	Certain it was when [MASK] passed one, if he did not put all attention to avoiding it, he was hooked through his chaps and held by barbed thorns. The pain was almost unendurable. It was like no other. It burned, stung, beat--almost seemed to freeze.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Lash	We didn't kill anybody, but I shot a Greaser's arm off, an' [MASK] strained friendly relations by destroyin' property. We know people who'll take care of the senorita till your friend can come for her."
<name>Pecos</name>	Pecos	Rojas	[MASK] may be nutty about women, but he's afraid of the U. S. Take my word for it he'd discover the trail in the mornin' an' light out on it. I reckon with ten hours' start we could travel comfortable."
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Gale	In agony now, both mental and physical, cold and sick and weak, [MASK] gripped his rifle and aimed at the struggling forms on the ledge. He pulled the trigger. The bullet struck up a cloud of red dust close to the struggling couple.
<name>Desiree</name>	Desiree	Belding	I was about ready to give up and go mad when you--you came home." She ended in a whisper, looking up wistfully and sadly at him. [MASK] was a raging fire within, cold without.
<name>Prospector</name>	Prospector	Cameron	That day, while it was yet light, and he was digging in a moist white-bordered wash for water, he was brought sharply up by hearing the crack of hard hoofs on stone. There down the canyon came a man and a burro. [MASK] recognized them.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Gale	He began to look upon them without keen gaze strained for crouching form, or bobbing head, or spouting carbine. Either [MASK]'s sense of color and proportion had become deranged during the fight, or the encompassing air and the desert had changed. Even the sun had changed.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Belding	Then, as he viewed his stained and torn shirt, he laughed and said "[MASK], while I'm getting rich I'd like to have some respectable clothes." "We've a little Mex store in town, and what you can't get there the women folks will make for you."
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Gale	[MASK] found that he could not sleep. His eyes were weary, but they would not stay shut; his body ached for rest, yet he could not lie still. The night was so somber, so gloomy, and the lava-encompassed arroyo full of shadows.
<name>Woman</name>	Woman	Mercedes	Was this because of her beauty? he wondered. He thought not altogether. [MASK] was a woman. She represented something in life that men of all races for thousands of years had loved to see and own, to revere and debase, to fight and die for.
<name>he</name>	he	Belding	They had exerted every influence to obtain right to connect these ditches by digging through his land, but [MASK] had remained obdurate. He refused to have any dealings with them. It was therefore with some curiosity and suspicion that he saw a gang of Mexicans once more at work upon these ditches.
<name>Red</name>	Red	Belding	[MASK]'s voice thickened, and he paused, breathing heavily. He stepped back a few paces; and this, an ominous action for an armed man of his kind, instead of adding to the fear of the Chases, seemed to relieve them.
<name>Pancho</name>	Pancho	Camp	We had acquaintances--four fellows from the Cross Bar outfit, where we worked a while back. This Del Sol is a billiard hall, saloon, restaurant, an' the like. An' it was full of Greasers. Some of [MASK]'s rebels were there drinkin' an' playin' games.
<name>Benjamin</name>	Benjamin	Dick	It was as stiff, as unyielding as steel, and bore the name choya. [MASK]'s enthusiasm was contagious, and his earnest desire to learn was flattering to his teachers. When it came to assimilating Spanish, however, he did not appear to be so apt a pupil.
<name>anyone</name>	anyone	Chase	He did not think any argument or inducement offered by [MASK] could change his mind on past dealings or his purpose of the present. But he believed by listening he might get some light on what had long puzzled him.
<name>Meeker</name>	Meeker	Gale	The pack animals at times crashed and ripped through the narrow places. It seemed to [MASK] that any one within a mile could have heard these sounds. From the tops of knolls or ridges he looked back, trying to locate the mesas where the light had danced and the dog had barked alarm.
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Gale	In the soft sand his steps made no sound. The twinkling light vanished occasionally, like a Jack-o'lantern, and when it did show it seemed still a long way off. [MASK] was not seeking trouble or inviting danger.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Yaqui	[MASK]'s our godsend. Now as to the future, I'd like to know mebbe as well as you if we're ever to get home. Only bein' what I am, I say, Quien sabe?
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Nell	"Yes. Sometimes when I get blue--as I am to-day--I think I'll go. But, in sober truth, [MASK], it's not likely that I'll spend all my life here." There was no answer to this.
<name>Abel</name>	Abel	Cameron	Wait--listen!" panted [MASK]. "I've got that marriage certificate--I've had it by me all these years. I kept it--to prove to myself I did right." The old man uttered a broken cry.
<name>John</name>	John	Gale	The night was so somber, so gloomy, and the lava-encompassed arroyo full of shadows. The dark velvet sky, fretted with white fire, seemed to be close. There was an absolute silence, as of death. Nothing moved--nothing outside of [MASK]'s body appeared to live.
<name>Chris</name>	Chris	Gale	But in his case the judgment would have hit only externals, would have missed the vital inner truth. For [MASK] was happy with a kind of strange, wild glory in the privations, the pains, the perils, and the silence and solitude to be endured on this desert land.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Gale	He pointed up to the roof of the sloping yellow shelf of stone. Faintly outlined there in red were the imprints of many human hands with fingers spread wide. [MASK] had often seen such paintings on the walls of the desert caverns.
<name>Aragorn</name>	Aragorn	Belding	There came a low knock on the door. It may have been an ordinary knock, for it did not disturb the women; but to [MASK] and his rangers it had a subtle meaning. "Who's that?"
