<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Lamont	It means you’re all right. Do you understand me? I’ve met this man. I know him. I think he’s all right. Do you see it now? There’s nothing to worry about, boy, said [MASK].
<name>Shanahan</name>	Shanahan	Lamont	That's a quare one! Do you mind that now, said [MASK]. It’s a quare one and one that takes a lot of beating. Not a word to nobody, not a look to left or right but the brain-box going there all the time.
<name>uncle</name>	uncle	Brinsley	He is a special friend. Well, that is very good of you, said [MASK]. Oh, not in the least, said my uncle. There is a way of doing things, you understand. It is a great thing to have a friend in court.
<name>Black Jack</name>	Black Jack	Lamont	Bending his head forward as if with the weight of the frown he had arranged on his brow, [MASK] said in a dark voice: Do anything to spoil the good yarn you have made of it so far, and I will arise and I will slay thee with a shovel.
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Byrne	After enunciating a quiet chuckle, [MASK] made a noise in the darkness of a kind associated with the forcible opening of the lid of a tin container. He then moved about the room, a cigarette for each voice in his enterprising hand.
<name>Ignatius</name>	Ignatius	Shanahan	He is standing as you find him with his blue pants and his big canal-barges on his two feet. I’m telling you it was something to look at. It was a sight to see. I don’t doubt it, said [MASK]. Yes.
<name>Bloom</name>	Bloom	Brinsley	He chewed thickly, pointing to the play. The craft of billiards was unfamiliar to me but in politeness I watched the quick darting of the balls, endeavouring to deduce from the results of a stroke the intentions which preceded it. Gob, there’s a kiss, said [MASK].
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Lamont	Do you know that? A false step now and we’re all in the cart and that’s a fact. [MASK] came forward from a couch where he had been resting and inclined his head as a signal that he was taking an intelligent interest in the conversation.
<name>Uriah</name>	Uriah	Shanahan	I believe, said [MASK] in a treacherous manner, I believe that you can do more in the line of music than give out a song. I’m told -no names, of course - I’m told the fiddle is no stranger to your hand.
<name>Gregor</name>	Gregor	Trellis	Conclusion of extract. Further extract from my Manuscript, descriptive. Oratio recta: [MASK] stirred feebly in his room in the stillness of the second floor. He frowned to himself quietly in the gloom, flickering his heavy lids and wrinkling his brow into pimpled corrugations.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Teresa	Conclusion of the Book, penultimate: [MASK], a servant employed at the Red Swan Hotel, knocked at the master’s door with the intention of taking away the tray but eliciting no response, she opened the door and found to her surprise that the room was empty.
<name>Wyatt</name>	Wyatt	Shorty	The bloody Indians started squealing at the back and slapping their horses on the belly, the policemen were firing off their six-guns and their batons in the air and [MASK] and myself behind a sack of potatoes picking off the snipers like be damned.
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Shanahan	I admit, gentlemen, he said at last, I admit that there is a certain amount to be said for your point of view. Sometimes... There’s this, too, said [MASK] with a quick continuance of his argument, there’s this, that you have to remember the man in the street.
<name>Dr. Watson</name>	Dr. Watson	Orlick	This caused the outside corners of his mouth and eyes to be pushed up in a similar manner, imparting an inscrutable oriental expression to his countenance. Do you think it would be safe to go to bed and leave him where he is to the morning? he asked. I do not, said [MASK].
<name>Barney</name>	Barney	Peacock	A newspaper, soiled and damp, was on the floor at his feet and his eyes strained narrowly at the print. Gob I see that horse of [MASK]'s is going today, he said. I folded my manuscript without a word and replaced it in my clothing.
<name>the person</name>	the person	Brinsley	A number of male students, the majority of whom were unacquainted with me, were present in the hall in the vicinity of the steam-heaters, conversing together in low tranquil tones. I inspected the features of each but could not identify the face of [MASK].
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Furriskey	The important apartment to which you refer, Sir, answered [MASK] with gravity, is on your left on the first landing on your way up, you can’t miss it. Ah. In that case there will be a slight intermission. I must retire for meditation and prayer.
<name>Davy Byrne</name>	Davy Byrne	Byrne	We then saluted in formal fashion and talked on general academic topics, continuing to walk in the Grafton Street direction. Where are you going, I asked him. To [MASK]’s, he answered. Where are you going?
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Shanahan	A more ferocious beating was never handed out by the hand of man. Gentlemen, said [MASK], we’re taking all the good out of it by giving him a rest, we’re letting him get his wind. Now that’s a mistake.
<name>Mr. Henchy</name>	Mr. Henchy	Lamont	I mean to say, said [MASK], whether a yarn is tall or small I like to hear it well told. I like to meet a man that can take in hand to tell a story and not make a balls of it while he’s at it.
<name>Templeton</name>	Templeton	Furriskey	Practically every bone and sinew in his body was gone by the time he found himself dropped again on the grass. That’s right, you know, remarked [MASK], a rat’s bones are very weak. Very soft, you know. The least thing will kill a rat.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Furriskey	By God you could take off your hat to what you'd get at five o’clock from that crowd and that’s a sure sharkey. You’d be wasting your time if you waited till five o’clock if you ask me, said [MASK] with a nod of complete agreement.
<name>O'Brien</name>	O'Brien	Brinsley	Newspapers were widely read and notices posted on the wall were being torn down or altered by deletion of words or letters so as to impart to them an obscene or facetious import. A friend of mine, [MASK], came in and looked about him at the door.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Teresa	He then turned and coughing slightly, stared at her as she stood there, the oil-lamp in her hand throwing strange shadows on her soft sullen face. Ah, [MASK], he muttered. Where were you in your night-shirt, Sir? she asked.
<name>Paddy</name>	Paddy	Slug	Keep your hands up or I’ll paste your guts on that tree, says he, you swine. You can’t cow the like of us with your big gun, says [MASK], and don’t think it my boyo.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Lamont	He gave a small smile and took advantage of the parting of his lips for a brief spell of pen-tap at the teeth. You can do better, man, said [MASK], that's the way to look at it.
<name>Tom's</name>	Tom's	Kiersay	Let the lot of us meet at [MASK]’s at a quarter past eight. (Fair enough, fair enough.) Off went the two at a half-canter on the buckboard and the super and myself got stuck into a dozen stout in the back-room.
<name>Old Man</name>	Old Man	Furriskey	You’re polished off before you know you’re hurt at all. There’s no nonsense about the gun. It’s quick, it’s merciful, and it’s clean. I’m telling you now, fire's a fright, said [MASK].
<name>MacMurrough</name>	MacMurrough	Shanahan	Now take that stuff your man was giving us a while ago, said [MASK] without heed, about the green hills and the bloody swords and the bird giving out the pay from the top of the tree. Now that’s good stuff, it’s bloody nice.
<name>Jimmie</name>	Jimmie	Lamont	The ear is the main thing, observed [MASK]. You can wear the last tatter of skin off your knuckles with a fiddle and a bow and you won’t get as far as your own shadow if you haven’t got the ear. Have the ear
<name>Billy Pilgrim</name>	Billy Pilgrim	Trellis	Certainly I like it, says [MASK] through a hole in his head - he had no choice because orders is orders, to quote a well-worn tag. Why wouldn’t I like it? I think it’s grand.
<name>the bartender</name>	the bartender	Brinsley	The best I ever drank, he said. As I exchanged an eye-message with [MASK], a wheezing beggar inserted his person at my side and said: Buy a scapular or a stud, Sir. This interruption I did not understand.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Lamont	[MASK] extracted a small box from his pocket, exhibited it and proved to the company beyond doubt that it contained but one cigarette; he lit the sole cigarette with the aid of a small machine depending for its utility on the combustibility of petroleum vapour when mixed with air.
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Casey	Keep that bloody gun down, said [MASK] sharply, the voice that spoke was the voice of a bloody poet. By God I know a bloody poet when I hear one. Hands off the poets. I can write a verse myself and I respect the man that can do the same.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Shanahan	A plot that will be acceptable to all. You, gentlemen, will like it in particular. It combines justice with vengeance. As long as the fancy stuff is kept down, said [MASK], well and good.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Brinsley	No, I said. I struck a match and lit my ‘butt’ and also another ‘butt’, the property of [MASK]. We smoked there together for a time. The floor was wet from foot-falls and a mist covered the high windows.
<name>Blackie</name>	Blackie	Lamont	Good its water greenish-green good its clean strong wind, good its cress-green cresses, best its branching brooklime. Quick march again, said [MASK]. It’ll be a good man that’ll put a stop to that man’s tongue.
<name>Professor Challenger</name>	Professor Challenger	Orlick	As long as you realize the importance of the step that is about to be taken, said [MASK], I have no objection. I only hope that nothing will happen to us. I don’t think the like of this has been done before, you know.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Shanahan	Symbolism of the foregoing: annoyance. I will now continue, he announced. Certainly man, said [MASK], a hand to the writer’s biceps. We’ll get him yet! We’ll take the skin off his body.
<name>St. Cuthbert</name>	St. Cuthbert	Sweeny	[MASK] then left the cleric sad and sorrowful over the godless battery of the king and lamenting his psalter. This, however, an otter from the murk of the lake returned to him unharmed, its lines and its letters unblemished.
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Furriskey	Twenty ... bloody ... years in bed, eh? Every Christmas he was carried out by his brother and put in a bath. He was better dead, said [MASK]. He was better in his grave than in that bed.
<name>Pop</name>	Pop	Shanahan	I’ll tell you what's hard, too, said [MASK], a bad knee. They say a bad knee is worse than no knee at all. A bad knee and an early grave. Water on the knee, do you mean?
<name>Sloth</name>	Sloth	Lord	Sloth - [MASK] save us - sloth is a terrible cross to carry in this world. You are a burden to yourself... to your friends ... and to every man woman and child you meet and mix with. One of the worst of the deadly sins, there is no doubt about it.
<name>Edgar</name>	Edgar	Shanahan	I have devised a plot that will lift our tale to the highest plane of great literature. As long as the fancy stuff is kept down, said [MASK]. A plot that will be acceptable to all. You, gentlemen, will like it in particular.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Trellis	These are eight agonies, responded [MASK], that I would not endure for a chest of treasure. To say which of them is worst, that would require a winter in a web of thought. A glass of milk, that is the delicacy I offer you before you go.
<name>Simon</name>	Simon	Casey	I was in the centre of the yew distraught with suffering, the hostile branches scourged me, 1 would not come down. You’re all right man, said [MASK] with kindly pats of his hand on the mossy side, you’ll get over that.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Peggy	The girl [MASK] made a neat and homely housewife. Tea was dispensed in a simple but cleanly manner. For the rest of their time, they did not use it too well. They consorted with sailors and cornerboys and took to drink and bad company.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Trellis	That is an elegant definition, said [MASK], affording an early-morning smile for the enjoyment of his guest. A grain of knowledge with the dawning of the day is a breakfast for the mind. I will now re-enter the darkness of my sleep, remembering to examine it anew on my recovery.
<name>Archer</name>	Archer	Trellis	There are two men in the court here and you can now be at the choice of them. I did not expect this, said [MASK]. He found that his voice was loud and probably strengthened by the agency of the one that was whispering at his ear.
<name>Bertie</name>	Bertie	Shanahan	I will pierce him with a pluperfect. Pluperfect is all right, of course, said [MASK], anybody that takes exception to that was never very much at the bee-double-okay-ess. I wouldn’t hear a word against it.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Orlick	Please be quiet, said [MASK]. The following, imperfect resume or summary as it is, may be taken as a general indication of the scholarly trend of the conversation sustained without apparent effort by the three of them.
<name>Shakespeare</name>	Shakespeare	Casey	Oh I’m telling you, [MASK] was a man in twenty thousand, there’s no doubt about that. He knew what he was at, too true he did. If he knew nothing else, he knew how to write a pome.
<name>Gregor</name>	Gregor	Alexander	[MASK], who had chosen a scheme of studies similar to my own, answered with my voice at lecture roll-calls. It was in the New Year, in February, I think, that I discovered that my person was verminous.
<name>David</name>	David	Lamont	His voice when he spoke was light and musical, a fact that was more than once commented on by people who had no reason for praising him and indeed by people who had the opposite. Thanks, said [MASK].
<name>Mr. Cramer</name>	Mr. Cramer	Lamont	Do you mean to say it is wrong to call it piano? asked [MASK]. His attitude was one of civil perplexity; his eyelids fluttered and his lower lip drooped as he made his civil inquiry. Well, no . .. It’s not wrong.
<name>Uriah</name>	Uriah	Brinsley	I will certainly, said [MASK]. My uncle smiled warmly and held out a hand. Good, he said. God bless you. Description of my uncle: Rat-brained, cunning, concerned-that-he-should-be-well-thought-of.
<name>Uncle Axel</name>	Uncle Axel	Furriskey	If a man’s station is high or low he is all the same to the God I know. Take the bloody black hats off the whole bunch of them and where are you? That’s the way to look at it, of course, said [MASK].
<name>Whitman</name>	Whitman	Shanahan	But there’s one man, said [MASK], there’s one man that can write pomes that you can read all day and all night and keep reading them to your heart’s content, stuff you’d never tire of.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Brinsley	Nature of my reply: Civil, perfunctory, uninformative. My uncle leaned over towards [MASK] and said to him in a low, confidential manner: Do you know what I am going to tell you, there is a very catching cold going around.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Peacock	What horse? Grandchild. [MASK]’s horse. Here I uttered an exclamation. Nature of exclamation: Inarticulate, of surprise, recollection. Wait till I show you something, I said groping in my pocket. Wait till you read this. I got this yesterday.
<name>Dr. Johnson</name>	Dr. Johnson	Brinsley	He is a philosopher and a moralist. He is appalled by the spate of sexual and other crimes recorded in recent times in the newspapers - particularly in those published on Saturday night. Nobody will read the like of that, said [MASK]. Yes they will, I answered.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Orlick	The right hand of [MASK] was fastened about his jaw. Interpretation of manual attitude mentioned: a token of extreme preoccupation and intense thought. I admit, gentlemen, he said at last, I admit that there is a certain amount to be said for your point of view.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Trellis	It was quiet, servile and emasculated; its twin alarming gongs could be found if looked for behind the dust-laden books on the mantelpiece. [MASK] had three separate suits of sleeping-clothes and was accustomed to be extremely fastidious as to the manner in which they were washed.
<name>Mr. Holmes</name>	Mr. Holmes	Kelly	One night we were followed in our turn by a member of the police force attired in civilian clothing. On the advice of [MASK] we hid ourselves in the interior of a church until he had gone. I found that the walking was beneficial to my health.
<name>Leopold</name>	Leopold	Furriskey	[MASK] experienced the emotion of fear which distorted for a time the character of his face. He also experienced a return of his desire for enteric evacuation. Yes sir, he answered. Biographical reminiscence, part the fourth: The further obtrusion of my personal affairs at this stage is unhappily not entirely fortuitous.
<name>Shader</name>	Shader	Brinsley	Here [MASK] interposed a laugh. I thought my stomach was on the floor, I said. Take it easy, says the Shader, you’ll be better when you get that off. Better? How I got home at all I couldn’t tell you.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Orlick	The members of the unseen orchestra were meticulously picking out an old French tune without the assistance of their bows, a device technically known as pizzicato. [MASK] laid down his pen in the spine-hollow of the red sixpenny copybook he was writing on, the nib pointing away from him.
<name>Caedmon</name>	Caedmon	Sweeny	Well dear the man it nourished, dear its perfect sand, beloved its dear waters. Melodious was the talk of [MASK] long shall I hold his memory, I implore the King of Heaven on his tomb and above his grave.
<name>Evelyn</name>	Evelyn	Furriskey	By God he can jump. That's one thing the Irish race is honoured for no matter where it goes or where you find it - jumping. The world looks up to us there. We were good jumpers from the start, said [MASK].
<name>Myers</name>	Myers	Brinsley	Oh, yes, said [MASK]. His tone was disquieted. Well, indeed, you are a wise man, said my uncle. Every evening in life I go for a good four-mile tramp myself. Every evening, wet or fine.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Furriskey	Don’t hang on to a vehicle or climb on to it! Don’t forget to walk on the footpath if there is one! Safety First! He read the last two phrases aloud, rubbing his eyes. [MASK] sat opposite in a downcast manner.
<name>Buck Mulligan</name>	Buck Mulligan	Lamont	That’s the ticket, said [MASK]. Anyway, didn’t your man get into a dark corner with his butties till they hatched out a plan to best the sergeant. All right. Back went your man to the sergeant, who was taking it easy in the shade of a tree.
<name>Dracula</name>	Dracula	Trellis	Do you wish to cross-examine the witness? I do, said [MASK]. He endeavoured to rise and place his hands in the pockets of his trousers in a casual manner but he found that much of the supernatural strength had been withdrawn.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Brinsley	I have had enough. I will now rise and use my God-given strength to the best of my ability and according to the duties of my station in life. To the flesh we say: Thus far and no farther. Yes, said [MASK] nodding.
<name>Mr. Bloom</name>	Mr. Bloom	Furriskey	He can sing like a lark when he feels like it. Because when you were listening to my singing this morning, my good woman, said [MASK] stressing with his finger the caesura of his case, I was blowing my nose in the lavatory.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Lord	[MASK] save us but it was the right hard battle. I fired off my six bullets without stopping. A big sheet of plate-glass crashed from the tram to the roadway. Then with a terrible scutter of oaths, the boys began to get busy.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Orlick	I have been engaged, said [MASK], in profound thought. It is only now that the profundity of my own thought is dawning on me. I have devised a plot that will lift our tale to the highest plane of great literature.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Brinsley	Two laughs in unison, these were my rewards. I frowned and drank unheedingly, savouring the dull oaten after-taste of the stout as it lingered against my palate. [MASK] tapped me sharply on the belly. Gob you’re getting a paunch, he said.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Slug	You keep your trap shut for five minutes, said [MASK] with fierce shoulders towering over the head of his friend, shut your bloody mouth now, do you hear me? This gentleman and his spirit are friends of mine, mind that now, and when you insult them you insult me.
<name>Macomber</name>	Macomber	Furriskey	It was here that [MASK] held up the further progress of the tale with his hand in warning. Maybe were going a bit too hard on him, he warned. You can easily give a man a bigger hiding than he can hold.
<name>She</name>	She	Brinsley	he said. [MASK] responded according to the practices of polite society, utilizing a formal good evening for the purpose. My uncle conferred a warm handshake and immediately placed his cigarettes at the disposal of the company. Well it isn't often we see you, he said.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Brinsley	Oh, we do indeed, said my uncle, and faith it would be a very nice world to live in if we didn’t. Oh, yes. I agree with you, said [MASK]. We can say to ourselves, continued my uncle, I have now rested.
<name>the Pooka</name>	the Pooka	Trellis	I will not have any of it, thank you, said [MASK]. That is a pity, rejoined the Pooka, cracking a brown-baked crust in the crook of his clean-shaven jaws. Not to eat is a great mistake.
<name>Jelly Roll</name>	Jelly Roll	Shanahan	Nobody can raise any objection to that. The piano and the fiddle, the two go well together. Some of the stuff I've heard in my time, said [MASK], is no joke to play for the man that has only two hands.
<name>Nanny</name>	Nanny	Byrne	I'm not ashamed to admit that I love my bed, said [MASK]. She was my first friend, my foster-mother, my dearest comforter .. . He paused and drank. Her warmth, he continued, kept me alive when my mother bore me.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Sweeny	Dark is the deed you have done, Oh herd, said [MASK], for owing to the wound you have dealt me I cannot henceforth escape through the hedge. I did not know you were there, said the herd.
<name>you</name>	you	Mister	It is very necessary in the times we live in, it is, faith. He turned to me. Now [MASK]-my-friend, he said, when are we going to hear from you? When are you going to bring home a prize?
<name>Uncle Pumblechook</name>	Uncle Pumblechook	Shanahan	The fiddle is an awkward class of a thing to carry, said [MASK], it’s not what you might call a handy shape. They say you get a sort of a crook in the arm, you know ...
<name>Hannibal</name>	Hannibal	Orlick	[MASK] placed his pen in the centre of his upper lip and exerted a gentle pressure by a movement of his head or hand, or both, so that his lip was pushed upwards. Result: baring of teeth and gum. You overlook my artistry, he said.
<name>mentioned</name>	mentioned	Whitefoot	My name is not [MASK]. You have stated that a cow will suffer considerable pain if not milked at regular times. There is, however, another important office discharged by the cowkeeper, a seasonal rite not entirely unconnected with the necessity for providing milk for our greatgrandchildren ...
<name>Swami</name>	Swami	Moling	A quantity of dried mucus had been lodged in a lump in his wind-pipe and for this reason the tone of his voice was not satisfactory. He followed his question without delay with a harsh coughing noise, presumably in order to remedy his defective articulation. I am [MASK], said the cleric.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Shanahan	Very early in the morning, I’m thinking. They tell me if you steam the face, said [MASK], the pores will - you know - open. That’s the man for blackheads, plenty of steam.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Orlick	A snail would be too fast for him, a snail could give him yards. [MASK] detached his hand from his jaw and passed it slowly about his brow. I could begin again, of course, he said with a slight weariness, but it would mean wasting some very good stuff.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Trellis	The air was heavy and laden with sullen banks of tobacco smoke; this made respiration an extremely difficult matter for a person like [MASK], who was not in perfect health. He felt a growing queasiness about his stomach and also tormina, griping pains in the region of the bowels.
<name>Buckley</name>	Buckley	Grogan	He purported to be a medical student but he had failed at least once to satisfy a body of examiners charged with regulating admission to the faculty. He suggested that we should drink a number ofjars or pints of plain porter in [MASK]’s public house.
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Shanahan	Ah. In that case there will be a slight intermission. I must retire for meditation and prayer. The curtain will be lowered to denote the passage of time. Gentlemen, adios! Safe home, cried [MASK], waving his hand.
<name>Antonio</name>	Antonio	Trellis	Easily accomplished, said [MASK], as he crawled in his crimson robe to the interior of his fine room, but give me time, for a leg that is in halves is a slow pilgrim and my shoulder is out of joint.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Trellis	You hog of hell, you leper's sore you! said [MASK] in a queer voice that came through the grid of his bleeding mouth-hiding hand. He reclined on the mud-puddled cobbles, a tincture of fine blood spreading about his shirt.
<name>Oscar</name>	Oscar	Brinsley	I am a great believer in the smile and the happy word. A sovereign remedy for all our ills, said [MASK]. A sovereign remedy for all our ills, said my uncle. Very nicely put. Well... He held out a hand in valediction.
<name>Ignatius</name>	Ignatius	Brinsley	Without addressing my uncle I made it known that there was but one chair in the room. You mean this lying in bed during the day? said [MASK]. His voice was innocent. He was intent on discussing my personal habits in a sympathetic manner with my uncle in order to humiliate me.
