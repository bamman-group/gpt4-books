<name>excitement</name>	excitement	Saxon	"All right, my hearty, I'll look after you," sang out Good in nervous [MASK]. "Come, get up, there's a good girl," and he stooped and caught her hand.
<name>Tico</name>	Tico	Macumazahn	"It is food and water, [MASK]," and again he waved the green thing. Then I saw what he had found. It was a melon. We had hit upon a patch of wild melons, thousands of them, and dead ripe.
<name>the enemy</name>	the enemy	Twala	Meanwhile we had leisure to observe [MASK]'s entire force, which evidently had been reinforced since the morning attack, and could not now, notwithstanding their losses, number less than forty thousand, moving swiftly up towards us.
<name>Tarka</name>	Tarka	Jim	On the day of their arrival he was sitting by the stream, and [MASK] was extracting the honey from the nest of a stingless bee which is to be found in the desert, on the top of a bank immediately above him.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Good	For a moment we did not dare to fire--though at that distance it would have been of little use if we had done so--for fear of hitting one of them, and the next a dreadful thing happened--[MASK] fell a victim to his passion for civilised dress.
<name>Livingstone</name>	Livingstone	Infadoos	Hastily we put on the chain shirts that the king had sent us, and taking our rifles and ammunition with us, so as to have them handy in case we had to fly, as suggested by [MASK], we started boldly enough, though with inward fear and trembling.
<name>She</name>	She	Twala	Behold your king, chiefs, captains, and soldiers! Now do your homage to the sacred Snake, and then follow on, that Incubu and I may show you a road to the heart of [MASK]'s host."
<name>Tybalt</name>	Tybalt	Scragga	_ art thou mad? Be careful, lest this chicken's fate overtake thee, and those with thee. How canst thou save her or thyself? Who art thou that thou settest thyself between me and my will? Back, I say. [MASK], kill her!
<name>you</name>	you	Heaven	he asked anxiously. I got up and shook myself before replying. "Pretty well, thank you," I answered. "Thank [MASK]! When I saw them carry you in, I felt quite sick; I thought you were done for."
<name>Allan</name>	Allan	Umbopa	[MASK], assegai in hand and a rifle across his shoulders, looked out fixedly across the desert a few paces ahead of us; while the hired natives, with the gourds of water, and Ventvögel, were gathered in a little knot behind. "
<name>Thakur</name>	Thakur	Ignosi	Each chief in turn drew near and examined the sign by the dim light of the lamp, and without saying a word passed on to the other side. Then [MASK] resumed his moocha, and addressing them, repeated the history he had detailed in the morning.
<name>Long John Silver</name>	Long John Silver	Good	Have we offended my lord that he should do such a thing?" Here I nearly exploded with laughing; and meanwhile one of the men started on with the garments. "Damn it!" roared [MASK], "that black villain has got my trousers.
<name>Kurtz</name>	Kurtz	Scragga	The figure seated itself upon a stool, [MASK] took his stand behind it, and the withered-up monkey crept on all fours into the shade of the hut and squatted down. Still there was silence. Then the gigantic figure slipped off the karross and stood up before us, a truly alarming spectacle.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Good	I entered the hut carefully. The lamp placed upon the floor showed the figure of [MASK] tossing no more, but lying quite still. So it had come at last! In the bitterness of my heart I gave something like a sob.
<name>the Inquisition</name>	the Inquisition	Gagool	she cried, "throw over me the mantle of thy protection; let me creep into the shadow of thy strength, that I may be saved. Oh, keep me from these cruel men and from the mercies of [MASK]!"
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Good	and I lay, with my eyes half shut, upon that fragrant bed of fern and watched them. Presently I missed [MASK], and I looked to see what had become of him. Soon I observed him sitting by the bank of the stream, in which he had been bathing.
<name>Dr. Roylott</name>	Dr. Roylott	Foulata	Shriek upon shriek, such as we have never heard, then a long sickening _crunch_, and the door was shut just as, rushing down the passage, we hurled ourselves against it. It was all done in four seconds. Then we turned to [MASK].
<name>Leonidas</name>	Leonidas	Scragga	Then turning to the guards--"Bring her hither; [MASK], make sharp thy spear." Two of the men stepped forward, and as they advanced, the girl, for the first time realising her impending fate, screamed aloud and turned to fly.
<name>Heaven</name>	Heaven	Jove	It was heavy and jingled. "By [MASK]! I believe it's full of diamonds," he said, in an awed whisper; and, indeed, the idea of a small goat-skin full of diamonds is enough to awe anybody.
<name>Desdemona</name>	Desdemona	Gagool	"I have saved her alive but for this. Stay, she shall choose," and calling to a messenger he ordered [MASK] to be brought before him. In a few minutes she came, hurried along by two guards, whom she was cursing as she walked.
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Ignosi	[2] It often puzzled all of us to understand how it was possible that [MASK]'s mother, bearing the child with her, should have survived the dangers of her journey across the mountains and the desert, dangers which so nearly proved fatal to ourselves.
<name>Livingstone</name>	Livingstone	Good	" I did so, and the chiefs withdrew. So soon as they had gone [MASK] went to the little box where he kept his medicines, unlocked it, and took out a note-book, in the fly-leaves of which was an almanack. "
<name>Beowulf</name>	Beowulf	Ignosi	"It is," answered the soldiers. "I am the king; I say to you, I am the king," went on [MASK], drawing up his great stature to its full, and lifting his broad-bladed battle-axe above his head.
<name>Hop-o'-my-Thumb</name>	Hop-o'-my-Thumb	Gagool	But the strong hands caught her fast, and brought her, struggling and weeping, before us. "What is thy name, girl?" piped [MASK]. "What! wilt thou not answer? Shall the king's son do his work at once?"
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Good	you fellows?" "I almost wish I were back," said [MASK], with a sigh. As for myself, I reflected that all's well that ends well; but in the course of a long life of shaves, I never had such shaves as those which
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Twala	_ I go to look upon their faces once more, and [MASK]'s also! Come on, come on, here is the lamp," and she drew a large gourd full of oil, and fitted with a rush wick, from under her fur cloak.
<name>Benaiah</name>	Benaiah	Scragga	Thou hast made me foolish; prepare for death." "I am the king's ox," was the low answer. "[MASK]," roared the king, "let me see how thou canst use thy spear. Kill me this blundering fool."
<name>Nada</name>	Nada	Gagool	A groan of terror burst from the onlookers. Some stood petrified with dread, others threw themselves upon their knees and cried aloud. As for the king, he sat still and turned pale beneath his dusky skin. Only [MASK] kept her courage.
<name>Beowulf</name>	Beowulf	Curtis	The ex-king laughed savagely, and stepping forward faced [MASK]. For a moment they stood thus, and the light of the sinking sun caught their stalwart frames and clothed them both in fire. They were a well-matched pair.
<name>Stonewall</name>	Stonewall	Infadoos	Men," said [MASK] calmly, as between the intervals of binding a wound on his arm he surveyed what remained to him of his corps, "ye have kept up the reputation of your regiment, and this day's fighting will be well spoken of by your children's children.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Infadoos	"It is well, [MASK]; if I conquer, thou shalt be the greatest man in the kingdom after its king. If I fail, thou canst only die, and death is not far off from thee. Rise, my uncle." "
<name>the guard</name>	the guard	Infadoos	"Tell me," I asked [MASK], "are we in danger?" "I know not, my lords, I trust not; but do not seem afraid. If ye live through the night all may go well with you.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Ignosi	Is it not so, O king?" [MASK] covered his face with his hands for a while before answering. "My heart is sore," he said at last; "your words split my heart in twain.
<name>Kaffir</name>	Kaffir	Gagool	Across the threshold of this door lay a skin bag, formed of a goat-skin, that appeared to be full of pebbles._ "_Hee! hee!_ white men," sniggered [MASK], as the light from the lamp fell upon it.
<name>Joseph</name>	Joseph	Umbopa	"Whence come you?" he went on, "who are you? and why are the faces of three of you white, and the face of the fourth as the face of our mother's sons?" and he pointed to [MASK].
<name>King Solomon</name>	King Solomon	Solomon	There, alone, was enough ivory to make a man wealthy for life. Perhaps, I thought, it was from this very store that [MASK] drew the raw material for his "great throne of ivory," of which "there was not the like made in any kingdom."
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Good	"Why?" asked [MASK]. "Because it has struck me that--what we saw--may be my brother." This was a new idea, and we re-entered the place to put it to the proof.
<name>Wamba</name>	Wamba	Twala	[MASK] started. "Thou speakest boldly, boy," he replied angrily; "presume not too far." "He may well be bold in whose lips are truth. The truth is a sharp spear which flies home and misses not.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Ventvögel	The other Kafirs we left with instructions to skin the lion and the sable antelope, and to cut up the latter. We had no difficulty in finding the broad elephant trail, which [MASK], after examination, pronounced to have been made by between twenty and thirty elephants, most of them full-grown bulls.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Umbopa	To my surprise I was understood. "Greeting," answered the old man, not, indeed, in the same tongue, but in a dialect so closely allied to it that neither [MASK] nor myself had any difficulty in understanding him.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Ventvögel	On a dark night a single star is better than nothing. Meanwhile [MASK] was lifting his snub nose, and sniffing the hot air for all the world like an old Impala ram who scents danger. Presently he spoke again. "I _smell_ water," he said.
<name>Captain</name>	Captain	Good	I never saw a more curious thing. "Curse it!" said [MASK]--for I am sorry to say he had a habit of using strong language when excited--contracted, no doubt, in the course of his nautical career; "curse it!
<name>Long John Silver</name>	Long John Silver	Silvestra	He could not have buried him alone. Look!" he went on, stooping down to pick up a queerly-shaped bone scraped at the end into a sharp point, "here is the 'cleft bone' that [MASK] used to draw the map with."
<name>Caspian</name>	Caspian	Infadoos	"The first," said I unthinkingly. Next second I regretted it, for I remembered that [MASK] had told us that the fairest woman must be offered up as a sacrifice. "Then is my mind as your minds, and my eyes as your eyes.
<name>Uncas</name>	Uncas	Ignosi	Has any white man to thy knowledge set his foot within the land?" "None, O [MASK]." "If any white man had been seen or heard of, wouldst thou have known?" "I should certainly have known."
<name>Zula</name>	Zula	Gagaoola	"Ay, my lord the king! Thy father's father and I were born on the same day." "Tell me, when thou wast little, didst thou know [MASK] the witch doctress?" "Ay, my lord the king!"
<name>Hecate</name>	Hecate	Gagool	See, [MASK], mother of evil, thou art so old that thou canst no longer love thy life. What can life be to such a hag as thou, who hast no shape, nor form, nor hair, nor teeth--hast naught, save wickedness and evil eyes?
<name>Stonewall</name>	Stonewall	Ignosi	Another minute and the onslaught grew fainter. "Ah, these are _men_, indeed; they will conquer again," called out [MASK], who was grinding his teeth with excitement at my side. "See, it is done!"
<name>Wilson</name>	Wilson	Ignosi	We kept up a steady fire from our rifles as they came, [MASK] joining in occasionally, and accounted for several men, but of course we produced no more effect upon that mighty rush of armed humanity than he who throws pebbles does on the breaking wave.
<name>Dolores</name>	Dolores	Gagool	I always keep my word--_ha! ha! ha!_ Once before a woman showed the chamber to a white man, and behold! evil befell him," and here her wicked eyes glinted. "Her name was [MASK] also. Perchance I was that woman."
<name>Undine</name>	Undine	Curtis	"If we do not return to-night he will search for us in the morning, [MASK]." "He may search in vain. He does not know the secret of the door, nor even where it is.
<name>the enemy</name>	the enemy	Twala	When the sun has turned and travelled a little way towards the darkness, let thy regiment, my uncle, advance with one other down to the green tongue, and it shall be that when [MASK] sees it he will hurl his force at it to crush it.
<name>Achilles</name>	Achilles	Twala	Is the dance ended?" "It is ended," [MASK] answered sulkily. "Let these dead dogs," pointing to the long rows of corpses, "be flung out to the hyænas and the vultures," and he lifted his spear.
<name>Kilimanjaro</name>	Kilimanjaro	Sheba	At the approach of evening we marched again, and, to cut a long story short, by daylight next morning found ourselves upon the lowest slopes of [MASK]'s left breast, for which we had been steadily steering.
<name>Ignosi</name>	Ignosi	Twala	The excitement in [MASK]'s camp on the plain beyond was very great, and regiment after regiment was starting forward at a long swinging trot in order to reach the root of the tongue of land before the attacking force could emerge into the plain of Loo.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Solomon	"Isn't there something on the map about [MASK]'s Great Road?" he said. I nodded, for I was still gazing out over the far country. "Well, look; there it is!" and he pointed a little to our right.
<name>Santa</name>	Santa	George	If you start on receipt of this you will reach here by Christmas, and I book you to stay with me for that. Good is coming, and [MASK]; and so, by the way, is your boy
<name>Desdemona</name>	Desdemona	Bougwan	"Say to my lord, [MASK], that--I love him, and that I am glad to die because I know that he cannot cumber his life with such as I am, for the sun may not mate with the darkness, nor the white with the black.
<name>Old Man</name>	Old Man	Silvestre	About eleven o'clock he grew quieter, and I lay down for a little rest and went to sleep. At dawn I woke again, and in the half light saw [MASK] sitting up, a strange, gaunt form, and gazing out towards the desert.
<name>Caesar</name>	Caesar	Infadoos	That was but the other day. But, fear not, fear not, I live only to do the bidding of the king. I have done the bidding of many kings, [MASK], till in the end they did mine. _Ha! ha!
<name>Alonso</name>	Alonso	Gagool	Mayhap; if they are there," he said, "ye shall have as many as ye can take hence--if indeed ye would leave me, my brothers." "First we must find the chamber," said I. "There is but one who can show it to thee--[MASK]."
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Silvestre	It even seemed to me that I could trace in his strongly-marked features a likeness to those of my poor friend [MASK] his descendant, who had died twenty years before in my arms, but perhaps that was fancy.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Tremble	That I am indeed the king these"--pointing to the chiefs--"can tell you, for they have seen the snake about my middle. If I were not the king, would these white men be on my side with all their magic? [MASK], chiefs, captains, soldiers, and people!
<name>Umslopogaas</name>	Umslopogaas	Infadoos	Holding each other by the hand we stumbled on through the darkness. CHAPTER XII BEFORE THE BATTLE Luckily for us, [MASK] and the chiefs knew all the paths of the great town perfectly, so that we passed by side-ways unmolested, and notwithstanding the gloom we made fair progress.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Good	They were about three hundred yards from us, and therefore practically out of shot, but [MASK], who was walking ahead, and who had an express loaded with solid ball in his hand, could not resist temptation. Lifting his gun, he let drive at the last, a young cow.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ventvögel	It was all very well for [MASK] to say that he smelt water, but we could see no signs of it, look which way we would. So far as the eye might reach there was nothing but arid sweltering sand and karoo scrub.
<name>Crusaders</name>	Crusaders	Crusaders.--Editor	We must wait." So we lit our pipes and waited. [1] In the Soudan swords and coats of mail are still worn by Arabs, whose ancestors must have stripped them from the bodies of [MASK]. CHAPTER XI WE GIVE A SIGN
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Umbopa	[MASK] rose to the occasion, and with something as nearly resembling a grin as I have ever seen on his dignified face he handed me the gun. "It is here, O Lord of Lords," he said with a deep obeisance.
<name>Umslopogaas</name>	Umslopogaas	Macumazahn	There is a saying, that those who enter there will die within a moon, even as the white man died in the cave upon the mountain, where ye found him, [MASK], and therefore the kings do not enter. _Ha! ha!
<name>Mr. Harris</name>	Mr. Harris	Good	The others agreed, and we proceeded to make our preparations. [MASK] took off his clothes, shook them, put his eye-glass and his false teeth into his trousers pocket, and folding each article neatly, placed it out of the dew under a corner of his mackintosh sheet.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bougwan	Oh, [MASK]! help! help! the stone falls!_" "Leave go, girl! Then--" "_Help! help! she has stabbed me!_" By now we are running down the passage, and this is what the light from the lamp shows us.
<name>Okoye</name>	Okoye	Good	"What did I tell you, that the white man who came here fled in haste, and dropped the woman's bag--behold it! Look within also and ye will find a water-gourd amongst the stones." [MASK] stooped down and lifted it.
<name>Polyphemus</name>	Polyphemus	Twala	[MASK] scowled, and his one eye gleamed fiercely, but he said nothing more. "Let the dance begin," he cried, and then the flower-crowned girls sprang forward in companies, singing a sweet song and waving the delicate palms and white lilies.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Scragga	She ceased struggling, and clasping her hands convulsively, stood shuddering from head to foot. "See," cried [MASK] in high glee, "she shrinks from the sight of my little plaything even before she has tasted it," and he tapped the broad blade of his spear.
<name>Mopo</name>	Mopo	Ignosi	"Come hither," he called, to a very old Induna or councillor, who was sitting with others in a circle round the king, but out of ear-shot. The ancient man rose, approached, saluted, and seated himself. "Thou art aged," said [MASK].
<name>Umslopogaas</name>	Umslopogaas	Good	Shortly after this somebody knocked me down, and I remember no more of that charge. When I came to I found myself back at the koppie, with [MASK] bending over me holding some water in a gourd. "How do you feel, old fellow?"
<name>the enemy</name>	the enemy	Twala	It seems that though we have beaten off the attack, [MASK] is now receiving large reinforcements, and is showing a disposition to invest us, with the view of starving us out." "That's awkward." "
<name>Conrad</name>	Conrad	Quatermain	By the way, [MASK], has he heard anything of--of my brother?" "Nothing; he has asked everyone he has become friendly with, but they all declare that no white man has ever been seen in the country before."
<name>Tabaqui</name>	Tabaqui	Gagool	With a wild yell [MASK] sprang to her feet, then fell again and rolled upon the floor. "Nay, I will show thee. Only let me live, let me sit in the sun and have a bit of meat to suck, and I will show thee."
<name>Scudamore</name>	Scudamore	Ventvögel	Presently we caught sight of the herd, which numbered, as [MASK] had said, between twenty and thirty, standing in a hollow, having finished their morning meal, and flapping their great ears. It was a splendid sight, for they were only about two hundred yards from us.
<name>Quatermain</name>	Quatermain	Twala	When we reached the great space, where a day or two previously we had seen the review and the witch hunt, we found it deserted. No, not quite deserted, for there, on the further side, in front of his hut, sat [MASK] himself, with but one attendant--Gagool.
<name>the dead man</name>	the dead man	Gagool	"He may search in vain. He does not know the secret of the door, nor even where it is. No living person knew it yesterday, except [MASK]. To-day no one knows it. Even if he found the door he could not break it down.
<name>us</name>	us	Twala	Is not the darkness they have brought upon the land to confound [MASK] and cover our flight, darkness even in the hour of the full moon, yet before your eyes?" "It is," answered the soldiers.
<name>Cleopatra</name>	Cleopatra	Gagaoola	there is [MASK], if she was a woman, and not a fiend. But she was a hundred at least, and therefore not marriageable, so I don't count her. At any rate, I can safely say that there is not a _petticoat_ in the whole history.
<name>Umbopa</name>	Umbopa	Ignosi	Then if this child [MASK] had lived he would be the true king of the Kukuana people?" "That is so, my lord; the sacred snake is round his middle. If he lives he is king; but, alas! he is long dead."
<name>Nyanga</name>	Nyanga	Gagool	"[MASK], mother of the witch-finders, has smelt him out; he must die, white men," was the sullen answer. "Nay, he shall not die," I replied; "he who tries to touch him shall die indeed."
<name>Trelawney</name>	Trelawney	Good	I suppose this was the money to pay the workmen and merchants." "Well," put in [MASK], "I think that is the lot; I don't see any diamonds, unless the old Portuguese put them all into his bag."
<name>the cook</name>	the cook	Good	All next day we rested and slept, and at sunset ate a hearty meal of fresh beef washed down with tea, the last, as [MASK] remarked sadly, we were likely to drink for many a long day.
<name>Franklin</name>	Franklin	Good	But now a new difficulty arose, we had no fuel, and therefore could make no fire to cook them. We gazed at each other in dismay. "Starving men should not be fanciful," said [MASK]; "we must eat raw meat."
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Good	"By heaven! it's running water," said [MASK]. "Come on." Off we started again in the direction from which the faint murmur seemed to come, groping our way as before along the rocky walls.
<name>Achilles</name>	Achilles	Gagool	piped [MASK]; "hear the liar who says that he will put out the moon like a lamp. Let him do it, and the girl shall be speared. Yes, let him do it, or die by the girl, he and those with him."
<name>Strickland</name>	Strickland	Macumazahn	Is this so also, '[MASK]?'" "Why do you ask whither we go? What is it to you?" I answered suspiciously, for the objects of our journey had been kept a dead secret.
<name>Baba Yaga</name>	Baba Yaga	Gagool	Yet the old witch [MASK] was right, the land shall run with blood first, and hers shall run with it, if she has any and can die, for she killed my father with her words, and drove my mother forth.
<name>Black Dog</name>	Black Dog	Death	It seemed to us that we had escaped [MASK] in the darkness of the treasure chamber only to meet him in the darkness of the tunnels. As we stood, once more utterly depressed, I thought that I caught a sound, to which I called the attention of the others.
<name>King Solomon</name>	King Solomon	Twala	"My friends," he answered, "I have discovered this. It is there that the three great figures sit, who here are called the 'Silent Ones,' and to whom [MASK] would have offered the girl Foulata as a sacrifice.
<name>Mount Everest</name>	Mount Everest	Sheba	We did not accomplish more than seven miles that day. Just before sunset we found ourselves exactly under the nipple of [MASK]'s left Breast, which towered thousands of feet into the air, a vast smooth hillock of frozen snow.
<name>people</name>	people	Zulus	" I was rather puzzled by this man and his way of speech. It was evident to me from his manner that in the main he was telling the truth, but somehow he seemed different from the ordinary run of [MASK], and I rather mistrusted his offer to come without pay.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Ignosi	Taking due precautions against treachery, we marched on into the town. All along the roadways stood thousands of dejected warriors, their heads drooping, and their shields and spears at their feet, who, headed by their officers, saluted [MASK] as king as he passed.
<name>Long John Silver</name>	Long John Silver	Gagool	As soon as she was clear of her hammock, [MASK] cast one evil grin upon us, and then, leaning on a stick, hobbled off towards the face of this wall. We followed her till we came to a narrow portal solidly arched that looked like the opening of a gallery of a mine.
<name>Umslopogaas</name>	Umslopogaas	Umbopa	That is not the way to speak. What is your name, and where is your kraal? Tell us, that we may know with whom we have to deal." "My name is [MASK]. I am of the Zulu people, yet not of them.
