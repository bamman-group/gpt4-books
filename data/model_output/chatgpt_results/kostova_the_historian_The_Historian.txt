<name>Brida</name>	Brida	Helen	Her sheets were hopelessly stained, but only in small spots. ‘We will let the monks think — well, that there have been women in their dormitory,’ [MASK] said in her forthright way. ‘It is surely not the first time they will have washed out some blood.’ ”
<name>David</name>	David	Barley	[MASK] said. “School paper,” I repeated, but our eyes met strangely over the book, and he looked as if he were seeing me for the first time. “Is your French very good?” I asked humbly. “Of course.”
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Rossi	You know, I’d never thought of the thing as a map — the dragon in my book. That’s an extraordinary idea.’ “ ‘Yes, and possibly a matter of life or death for [MASK],’ I said. ‘But now it’s your turn.
<name>Jay Gatsby</name>	Jay Gatsby	Turgut	[MASK] lapsed into a genial smile again. ‘Well, excuse me for climbing up onto my soap dish. My wife says I am intolerable.’ He toasted us with a subde, courtly gesture before sipping from his little vase again.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Erozan	A few minutes ago, this damnable man went for a strange doctor without consulting me, but the doctor was out. That, at least, is fortunate, because we do not want a doctor here now. But he left [MASK] alone just at sunset.’
<name>John</name>	John	Selim	The man backed away and then we heard his terrified descent down the stairwell. [MASK] locked the door behind him and looked out the window to the street, as if to satisfy himself that the fellow wouldn’t be returning. Then he knelt byTurgut and they conferred in low voices.
<name>Brother Cadfael</name>	Brother Cadfael	Dracula	At the abbot’s gentle insistence, however, [MASK] has had himself rebaptized in the true faith to show his repentance for his temporary conversion to the heretical Western church. The abbot has forgiven him everything, privately — everything.
<name>Vlad the Impaler</name>	Vlad the Impaler	Dracula	The library had provided a translation sheet, in fact, and there I reread with a shudder some of [MASK]’s crimes against humanity. He had had people roasted alive, he had flayed them, he had buried them up to their necks, he had impaled infants on their mothers’ breasts.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Helen	[MASK] touched her father’s forehead with two fingers, as if conferring a blessing. She was fighting sobs now. ‘How can we move him out of here? I want to bury him.’ “ ‘There’s no time,’ I said bitterly.
<name>Ying-ying</name>	Ying-ying	Helen	“[MASK] murmured something that could have been either apology or self-defense, and shook her head. She looked as stunned as I felt. Throughout the story she had sat quiet, translating as if barely breathing, murmuring something else only when her mother described the dragon on her shoulder.
<name>he</name>	he	Helen	‘But, you see, we are on a peculiar mission and we have not known whom to trust.’ “ ‘I see.’ He smiled. ‘Perhaps you are wiser than you know.’ “That gave me pause, but [MASK] nodded again, and I continued.
<name>Xi Jinping</name>	Xi Jinping	Nagy	It’s my belief that the study of history should be our preparation for understanding the present, rather than an escape from it.’ “ ‘Very wise. Well, then, to satisfy your curiosity — [MASK] enjoys great popularity among our people and is carrying out reforms in line with our glorious history.’
<name>Beowulf</name>	Beowulf	Dracula	Some of them are much more than folk songs — they are epic poems.’ “I felt a little disappointed; I had been expecting some kind of rare historical document, something about [MASK]. ‘Do any of them mention our friend?’
<name>Icarus</name>	Icarus	Lucifer	“I wanted to fall free, like [MASK], like an angel, but I had not seen those rocks. I fell on them instead and cut my head and arms, but there was a large cushion of grass there, too, and the fall did not kill me or break my bones.
<name>work</name>	work	Helen	I bent and kissed her again, but this time on the mouth. Her lips were warm and sweet. As I released her, turning swiftly back to my briefcase and to [MASK], I saw on the older womans face the gleam of a single tear.
<name>Brianna</name>	Brianna	Georgescu	It was a wolf of startling size; in the dim light I could see its shaggy fur and massive head for just a second before it slipped out of the ruin and vanished. I lay down again, unwilling to wake [MASK] now that the danger seemed past, but I could not sleep.
<name>Dracula</name>	Dracula	Dracula	and I saw the small white scar I had already noticed many times. “I knew in my bones that [MASK] had not forgotten about me, and that he might search for me again. I filled my pockets with garlic and my mind with strength.
<name>Sylvester</name>	Sylvester	Rembrandt	I called him [MASK]. Thinking of him, I lifted the edge of the blind, pushed up the window, and called him, waiting for the thud of feline feet on the windowsill. I could hear only distant night traffic from the center of the city.
<name>Abilene</name>	Abilene	Ranov	“[MASK] shrugged and herded us away toward the church, but not before I’d seen one of the men working around the wood suddenly lean forward and ignite the pile. It caught quickly and blazed up, then spread, then began to roar.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Helen	Everywhere there was a drowsy humming in the air; nature was only a step away, if you knew which direction to step. “Then the street ended abruptly in a weedy field, and [MASK] knocked at the door of the last house.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Rossi	I put my briefcase down in the dust and went back to her so quickly that I didn’t know for a moment I had moved at all. Then, re- membering [MASK], I took her in my arms and kissed her soft, lined cheek.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Rossi	[MASK]’s papers rested securely in my briefcase, and perhaps the next few hours would bring me a step closer to his whereabouts. Soon, at least, I might be able to compare his copies of the documents with the originals he had examined so many years before.
<name>Professor</name>	Professor	Stoichev	“‘How fortunate.’ [MASK] folded one veined hand over the other. ‘And what is your dissertation about?’ “ ‘Well,’ I began, and this time it was my turn to flush.
<name>justice</name>	justice	Rossi	I caught myself hoping that we would indeed find just a few holy shards of bone, and then close the whole thing up. But then there was the emptiness that would follow — the lack of [MASK], the lack of revenge, the loss.
<name>Quasimodo</name>	Quasimodo	Stoichev	He was followed by a wiry little bureaucrat in dark suit and hat, with a heavy dark mustache. There was another figure, too, one who moved haltingly, and whose slow progress, I realized now, must have hampered them at every step: [MASK].
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Paul	“ ‘[MASK], my dear man!’ I thought I’d never heard anything sweeter than that rumbling, distant voice. ‘There’s some problem on the line — give me your number there in case we are cut asunder.’
<name>Samurai</name>	Samurai	Dracula	“Open it,” he says, smoothing his mustache. His muscular legs are braced far apart in his chair; the ever-present sword still hangs at his side. The abbot wishes [MASK] would give his gifts with more humility, but he quietly opens the sack.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Helen	I took the wooden box without another word and fitted it in next to my dragon book. And while you are interviewing [MASK]’s mother, I will be digging around here for every possible hint of a tomb. I have not given up on the idea yet.’
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Rossi	I suspected, also, that daylight, morning, would bring a return of confidence and reason. Perhaps I wouldn’t even believe [MASK]’s story by the time I awoke, although I also felt sure it would haunt me whether I actually believed it or not.
<name>Darcy</name>	Darcy	Stoichev	I hoped they meant she would have a long life and good fortune, both shared by me. ‘What do you make of [MASK]’s having that letter?’ “ ‘It might be a stroke of luck for us,’ she mused.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Helen	‘“Isn’t there anything unusual here?’ [MASK] was looking at the low, vaulted ceiling now, trying to reach it with her fingertips. “ ‘I don’t see anything.’Then a sudden thought made me snatch a candle from the stand and crouch down.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Helen	“ ‘Your aunt?’ “[MASK] glanced out the window, toward the mellowed stucco of the old houses across the street. It was nearly evening, and the Mediterranean light I had already come to love was deepening to gold on every surface of the city outside.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Rossi	It was hard for me to imagine eating now, but I made my cup of soup and cut a slice of bread to go with it. Then I sat down at the desk again and cleared away [MASK]’s papers, putting them neatly back in the envelope.
<name>Prince</name>	Prince	Dracula	[MASK] demanded to know why they were dishonoring him in this way, and they replied that they were simply acting in accordance with their own customs. “Then I shall help you to strengthen your customs,” replied the prince, and he had their turbans nailed to their heads.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Barley	[MASK] turned to look at me, his eyes full of faraway thoughts, or perhaps just full of the land beyond the window, no longer flat but rolling, a modest French farm country. After a minute he smiled.
<name>Guido</name>	Guido	Bartholomew	I believe he was sacrificed as a mere warning — to me. And to you, as well, unfortunate reader? Yours in profoundest grief [MASK] Rossi My father stirred the ice in his glass, as if to steady his hand and give himself something to do.
<name>Romanian</name>	Romanian	Roumanian	They talk of wolves, and bears, and of course vampires — pricolici, they call them in their language. I’m getting the feel for a few words of [MASK], and my French, Italian, and Latin are all of the greatest service while I try to puzzle things out.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Rossi	I thought with sudden fierce longing of [MASK], pouring out far finer coffee than this for himself and me — his exquisite hospitality. Oh, I had other questions for this strange young woman. “Someone obviously doesn’t want you — me — anybody — checking out that book,” I observed.
<name>Leia</name>	Leia	Helen	‘My maternal grandfather, actually, was a very active member of the Guard and he could not endure for the line to die with him, but he had only a daughter. When he saw that the Empire would end forever in his lifetime —’ “ ‘Your mother!’ [MASK] exclaimed.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Helen	Hur to Benedictine.” With my head bent over it, I could still see the circulation desk; [MASK] was getting a permission slip to enter the stacks, her form tall and slim in the black coat, her back turned decisively on the long nave of the library.
<name>Dr. Seward</name>	Dr. Seward	Turgut	They were Latin, I was sure, although my Latin, dating back to my first two years of college, had never been impressive and was now rusty, to boot. “ ‘What does that say? Do you read Latin?’ “To my relief, [MASK] nodded.
<name>Simon</name>	Simon	Barley	I remembered now the peculiar beasts carved in stone around it: griffins and lions, dragons and birds, strange animals I couldn’t identify, hybrids of good and evil. [MASK] and I both looked at the church, but the doors stayed firmly shut, and we crept across the courtyard to the crypt doorway.
<name>he</name>	he	Ranov	We all stood staring at him; his face was white, and where he grasped the torn cloth of his jacket, a little blood was already trickling between his fingers. After a long minute [MASK] spoke. ‘What the hell is this about?’
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Helen	“The stone steps were steep, and the breath of cold that reached us from below made the church itself seem warm. I gripped [MASK]’s hand tightly as we picked our way down after the priest’s lantern, which illuminated the old stones around us.
<name>Ali</name>	Ali	Turgut	“When we were nearly bursting, we leaned back against the low divans — I now understood their use, recovery after a large meal — and [MASK] looked at us with satisfaction. ‘You are sure you have had enough?’
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Helen	“‘Your mother,’ I echoed, with a sudden image of [MASK]’s mother standing in her doorway, watching us leave. ‘He never meant not to go back. He suddenly forgot everything. And that’s — that’s why he told me he couldn’t always remember his research clearly.’
<name>Orpheus</name>	Orpheus	Stoichev	It was half song, actually, and half howl, a baritone melody so wrenching that I found my heart constricting with loss, with all the losses of my life. ‘What is he singing?’ I asked [MASK], to cover my emotion.
<name>Corcoran</name>	Corcoran	Rossi	But a map of what?’ His eyes gleamed. “ ‘That is what [MASK] was trying to figure out in the archives here,’ I said with a sigh. ‘If only he had taken more steps, later, to find out its significance.’
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Helen	But what use I can put it to I do not know yet. While 1 work I am waiting to discover this. Your loving mother, [MASK] September 1963 My beloved daughter: I am ready, almost, to give up and return to you.
<name>Barty Crouch Jr.</name>	Barty Crouch Jr.	Rossi	I wanted to. It wasn’t fair. He took [MASK] instead of me! He took him by force — I would have gone willingly to serve him, to help him, to catalog —” He suddenly clamped his mouth shut. “What?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Stoichev	“As soon as the door closed behind them, [MASK] leaned forward and read the letter with greedy concentration. When he was done, he looked up at us. His face had lost ten years, but it was tense, too.
<name>Chess</name>	Chess	Black	Sure enough, the two men were just setting up their pieces on a worn-looking wooden board. [MASK] was arrayed against ivory, knights and rooks guarded their lieges, pawns faced one another in battle formation — the same arrangement of war the world over, I mused, stopping to watch.
<name>Abdullah</name>	Abdullah	Jj	peared to be a record of expenses — the objects purchased had been noted down on the left and the cost, in an unspecified currency, noted neatly down on the right. “Five young mountain lions for his Gloriousness the Sultan, [MASK],” I read with interest.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Rossi	And how, I asked myself — outside now, passing under [MASK]’s windows and glancing up involuntarily to where his lamp still shone — how could I not believe my adviser on any point related to his own scholarship? Wouldn’t that call into question all the work we had done together?
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Helen	As I cut up my lunch, and eat it alone, someone smiles at me and I smile back. Then I look away. You are not the only person with whom I am not ft to associate. Your loving mother, [MASK]
<name>Moriarty</name>	Moriarty	Selim	‘So [MASK] — he never sleeps, you know — went for his morning coffee, because he did not wish to surprise you right away — ah, here he is!’ “The bell at the pension door rang and a slender man stepped in, pulling the door shut behind him.
<name>Sebastian</name>	Sebastian	Helen	I hoped someday she might meet him. But I did not know he was at the university you went to there,’ [MASK]’s mother added, turning almost reproachfully to her daughter, and in this abrupt way she finished her story.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Turgut	[MASK] drew from the box another parchment. ‘This is the last document in here,’ he said. ‘I have never been able to make sense of it. It is listed in the library catalog as a bibliography of the Order of the Dragon.’
<name>Shah</name>	Shah	Shah	Checkmate, I think you say in English. [MASK] is the word for king. A batde of kings.’ “I watched the two men beginning their game, their gnarled fingers selecting the first warriors. Jokes flashed between them — probably they were old friends.
<name>Whistler</name>	Whistler	Stoker	I hurried to the “St” drawer. No entries for “[MASK]” appeared there — only further signs of a hasty theft. I sat down hard on the nearest wooden stool. This was too strange. Why would anyone have ripped out these particular cards?
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Barley	“We don’t have a light,” he whispered. “Well, we can’t go into the church for one,” I pointed out unnecessarily. “I’ve got my lighter.” [MASK] took it out of his pocket. I hadn’t known he smoked.
<name>the</name> (There is no proper name that fits in this context. The word "the" is the most appropriate option to fill in the [MASK] token.)	the (There is no proper name that fits in this context. The word "the" is the most appropriate option to fill in the [MASK] token.)	Barleys	Each garment seemed to me a momentous decision, [MASK] pajama shirt first of all; its removal revealed an alabaster torso and surprisingly muscled shoulders. The shedding of my blouse and ugly white brassiere was as much my decision as his.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Helen	There was a note for [MASK] from her aunt, which she read eagerly. ‘I thought so. She wants us to have dinner with her this evening, here in the hotel. She will tell us her good-byes then, I suppose.’
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Ifelt	The air was cold and dank, and whatever I lay on was cold, so that [MASK] chilled all over. This sensation was followed by light — a dim light but enough to convince me that I was not blind and that my eyes were open.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Helen	“You’re right,” said my father. “Come to think of it, I did forget.” [MASK] turned to him with her lovely smile. “Do you know I had never seen that book before?
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Helen	‘She is a very pretty girl,’ he remarked complacently as we walked to his car, and [MASK] rolled her eyes at me behind his back. “It wasn’t until evening that we had a few minutes alone together.
<name>history</name>	history	Dracula	“ ‘What?’ Now it was my turn to be irritable. ‘Oh, very simple. We just hop a train with your Hungarian passport and my — oops — American passport, and drop by to chat with one of your relatives about [MASK].’
<name>Vesper</name>	Vesper	Helen	“ ‘That is not such a bad idea,’ [MASK] said softly. ‘The palace of the Byzantine emperors must have had an underground area.’ She almost smiled, but her hand went up to the scarf at her neck, as if something troubled her there.
<name>Safiya</name>	Safiya	Helen	“She could ride as well as any cavalryman of the sultans’ and — although very few people knew this — shoot like one, also.’ He almost winked at [MASK], and I remembered her little gun — where did she keep it, anyway?
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Helen	‘But I also thought he might mean simply that it was politically sensitive material, like so much of his work — because it involves the history of the church.’ “ ‘I know.’ [MASK] sighed. ‘It might mean only that.’
<name>Dirk</name>	Dirk	Ranov	It didn’t falter for a second — [MASK] might have been shooting into air. Then the evil librarian was gone, so suddenly that I wasn’t sure whether he’d actually reached the passage or vanished before our eyes.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Paul	Why had I left her alone, then or on any night? “ ‘[MASK],’ she said, as if puzzled. ‘What are you doing here?’ Then she seemed to struggle to sit up and discovered the disarray of her gown.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Hedges	His eyes were open, staring hard past me. For an endless second 1 thought he was dead. Then his head moved and he groaned. I crouched beside him. “[MASK]!" He moaned again and blinked rapidly. “Can you hear me?"
<name>Bones</name>	Bones	Yankee	“ ‘Come on, [MASK],’ she said. ‘We have some new business to attend to.’ “Normally I would have smiled at her epithet for me, but this time something made me turn and look at her with a deep shudder.
<name>Dracula</name>	Dracula	Dracula	My blood had already non cold in every extremity. ‘This book was like no other, an empty book, very old, with a dragon in the middle and a word — drakulya. I had never heard about [MASK] before. But the picture was very strange and strong.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Stoichev	I wished I could thank [MASK]’s niece. She setded her uncle comfortably in his chair and made us sit down, and I realized that the morning’s excursion had left me terribly hungry. “ ‘Please, honored guests, make yourselves welcome.’
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Selim	‘Quick, we must take him home. Professor, madam, help me. We will call a taxicab and carry him to my apartment. My wife and I can care for him there. [MASK] will stay here with the archive — it must open very soon.’
<name>Godot</name>	Godot	Dracula	“At that moment there was a step in the hall. I looked around nervously, half expecting to see [MASK] himself, whatever he looked like, but it was only a small man in a white cap and shaggy gray beard.
<name>Brother William</name>	Brother William	Turgut	‘I don’t see how we can do this.’ “[MASK] leaned forward and set before me the English translation of the monk’s letter. ‘He did not know either.’ “ ‘Who?’ I groaned.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Helen	I dropped to my knees on the stones and traced it with one hand. It was so familiar to me that I could have carved it there myself. [MASK] crouched next to me, her shoe forgotten. ‘My God,’ she said.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Barley	I looked warily up at him, but his face was mostly obscured by the sandwich. When he emerged from it to drink a little orange soda, I said, “[MASK], I’d like you to do me a favor.” “Now what?”
<name>Lenin</name>	Lenin	Helen	It all set me to pondering more than ever the possible inaccuracies of our letter of introduction, but I followed [MASK]’s lead and merely smiled, or made neutral remarks. He toasted friendship among the workers of every nation, refilling our glasses and his own.
<name>she</name>	she	Helen	The sight of the wound up close was so terrible to me that I thought for a minute I would have to leave the room and give way to my tears outside. But although [MASK] moved weakly, I could see the set determination in her face.
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Helen	He rose to his feet, and the last languor of the afternoon vanished. [MASK] stubbed out her cigarette and rose, too, her sleeve brushing my hand. I followed. ‘Please come into my study for a moment.’
<name>Mr. Spencer</name>	Mr. Spencer	Barley	“In the first place,” [MASK] said (and I hated him for his didactic tone), “we don’t know who that was on the train. Maybe it wasn’t the villain himself. He has his minions, according to your father’s letters, right?”
<name>Dr. Sarah Frank</name>	Dr. Sarah Frank	Turgut	“ ‘Let me stay,’ she told [MASK] in a low voice. ‘I want to know how it is done.’ For a moment, I wondered why she craved this knowledge and found myself remembering — surreal thought — that she was, after all, an anthropologist.
<name>his</name>	his	Helens	In the niche on the back wall where an icon might once have stood, I saw a trickle of black slime on the bare stones — blood? An infiltration of moisture from the earth? “The door behind us burst open and we swung around, my hand on [MASK] free arm.
<name>Nurten</name>	Nurten	Helen	“ ‘You think these monks, if they were the same ones, brought plague to the city?’ “ ‘Of course, we do not know,’Turgut admitted. But if your song describes the same group of monks —’ “ ‘I have been thinking of something.’ [MASK] set her cup down.
<name>Antarctica</name>	Antarctica	Barley	[MASK] seemed very far away; earlier, I had been glad for those thoroughly separate beds, so that there could be no awkwardness about sleeping arrangements, but now I wished we’d been forced to sleep back-to-back.
<name>Tom Riddle</name>	Tom Riddle	Bartolomeo	I know this is because she has [MASK]’s blood in her. I told her about her father — I never lied to her. Maybe I didn’t tell her enough, but she was too young to understand that love makes people blind and foolish.
<name>the librarian</name>	the librarian	Turgut	‘It was that man,’ [MASK] said, pointing, too. ‘He says it was the man who came in a little while ago, to whom he was talking.’ “We all turned, aghast, and the librarian gestured again, but it was too late.
<name>Aunt Polly</name>	Aunt Polly	Barley	You’ve given me a pretty chase — what are you up to, anyhow?” I evaded the last question for now. “I didn’t mean to worry you, [MASK]. I thought you’d gone on the ferry and would never know.”
<name>John</name>	John	Helen	A mortal man would have been seriously wounded by such shots.’ She sighed and adjusted the handkerchief. “I looked from one to the other in bewilderment. ‘Have you been carrying around that gun all the time?’ I asked [MASK].
<name>my host</name>	my host	Helen	In fact, I thought, I would do well to keep a low profile and make as little trouble as possible for my hosts. I was lucky to be here at all, and the last thing I wanted was any problem for [MASK] or her family.
<name>Dr. Mortimer</name>	Dr. Mortimer	Stoichev	“[MASK] looked almost as awed as I felt, although the sight of such an old manuscript must have been his daily fare. ‘I have translated it into Bulgarian,’ he said, after a moment, and drew out another sheet, this one typed onionskin.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Rossi	It was odd for me to think of myself as someone interested in the occult; I wasn’t, in the slightest, when you got right down to it. I was interested in finding [MASK]. The last letter, unlike the others, was handwritten — on lined notebook paper, in a dark ink.
<name>Judas</name>	Judas	Dracula	1 was already at risk for becoming like [MASK], and legend asserted that any suicide might become undead without the added contamination I had received — a cruel legend, but still I had to heed it. That way was closed to me.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Geza	— flash over her face. She made her way toward us immediately, as if to intervene. “ ‘How are you, [MASK]?’ She was shaking hands with him, formally and a litde coldly, before I’d even had time to greet the man.
<name>Aunt Alexandra</name>	Aunt Alexandra	Logic	“[MASK] tells me that it is an absurd idea. But —” She folded her gloves carefully in her black-skirted lap. “I wonder if there’s not another source of information were overlooking.” Her mouth drooped. Silently, I thanked her for that we.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Barley	Then the train was picking up speed, pulling around a curve. I turned to [MASK], and we glared at each other. Except for a few villagers sitting in the little rural station, we were alone in the middle of a French nowhere. Chapter 32
