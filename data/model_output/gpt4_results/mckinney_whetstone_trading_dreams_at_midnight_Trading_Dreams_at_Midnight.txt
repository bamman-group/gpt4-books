<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Alfred	[MASK] had fallen back asleep against her chest, had slobbered all over her dress, and she realized she’d have to change it. Realized something else as she sat on the porch floor rocking him. She’d have to let him go.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Richmond	For real, for real, I understand,” [MASK] said. His breath was hot pushing in her ear. He kissed the back of her neck then, allowed his body to brush harder and harder against hers.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Cliff	“Actually [MASK],” she said as she squeezed his hand, “I’ve yet to hear a cliche.” “That’s very sweet of you,” he said. “You’re very sweet.”
<name>Yolanda</name>	Yolanda	Neena	She held the wall and made it through the dim hallway into the ladies’ room. The young girls were in the mirror combing their hair and putting gloss to their lips. [MASK] rushed past them into a stall as one of them said, “Ooh, a Gucci bag.
<name>her</name>	her	Neena	Put on her gushy smile as he stood there looking at her deciding. “You come with me,” he said finally as he motioned her to the end of the counter, then pressed a buzzer to lift up a square of counter for [MASK] to pass through to get to the other side.
<name>She</name>	She	Freeda	[MASK] learned to keep his visits to herself. She figured out that as long as she did what he told her to do, he kept the devil from her view. When he told her to leave, she left.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Neena	She clothed them in white cotton blouses that had been freshly line-dried, starched, and ironed, and newly made pink and white gingham skirts with kick-out pleats. It felt like Easter to [MASK] because she was wearing a nylon slip and her barely walked-in patent leather shoes.
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Neena	He answered and it was [MASK] and his stomach dropped. She apologized; she was on a pay phone, she said, and had to put more money in. “So do I still have your ear for free?” she asked, laughing.
<name>Jerome</name>	Jerome	Alfred	She never heard the cymbal-like sound as it clanged against the wall because [MASK] took over once she was free of the pot. He was both gentle and ferocious as he lifted her short self onto the bed and slipped his hands under her housedress and squeezed her to him.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Freeda	“Leave, [MASK], leave” was his usual sing-songy command. She always complied; the only way to shut down his voice was for her to comply. Not that middle of the night, though, in 1984.
<name>Skeeter</name>	Skeeter	Goldie	And whatever they put on him is fixing to work because his silver is turning red. Wasn’t you, was it? You didn’t fix him, did you?” “Come on, [MASK], I don’t know nothing about working no roots.
<name>Arjun</name>	Arjun	Cliff	He was playing “Let It Be” and [MASK] allowed the melody to move through him, such a large sound, that flute had in the warm moist predawn air. He saw the hair first moving in the direction of the sound of the flute.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Neena	[MASK] had wished for her mother’s appearance whenever there was a chance a wish might come true, like right before she blew out the candles on her last birthday cake, or when a star seemed to shoot across the sky, or she caught a whiskered dandelion, even before she fell asleep on Christmas Eve.
<name>Arnold</name>	Arnold	Cyrus	He remembered the rage thinning out some when he found his mother-in-law stretched across a bench in the park talking to the sky as if she was talking to [MASK], her doctor-husband who’d died not long ago.
<name>Rowena</name>	Rowena	HUP	he asked as they walked through the kitchen, then out into the garage. “I’ve got to get a message to the little lamb,” he said, clutching his flute case under his arm. So it’s not for you? [MASK], I mean.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Lynne	He tipped across the Berber-covered floor and stood over [MASK], turned back the covers and kissed her cheek. He pictured the broad curve of her hips in the tight jeans, his throbbing increasing to unbearable at the thought. He pulled at her shoulder.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Neena	[MASK] did smile for real then. She kissed his cheek and then headed in. So now she stared at the pole of light and came to the realization that she couldn’t do it again. Couldn’t go through another tryst with a married man.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Neena	“Yo,” he said into the phone. Silence. Then a thin line of a voice saying, “Please, I’m trying to reach my granddaughter, [MASK]. She called me from this number. Might she be there, please?”
<name>Miranda</name>	Miranda	Tish	[MASK] hit the remote and flicked the channels on the television. “I hope the ratings don’t go up this week while I’m off air. That perky replacement of mine would love nothing better. Did you ever hear the story about her running away?”
<name>John</name>	John	Alfred	She fitted the bottle in the palm of her hand and brought her hand up to scratch her cheek and in one quick motion lowered her hand and dumped the contents of the bottle into [MASK]’s drink. She dropped the empty bottle back into her clutch purse.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Neena	Told them that the only way they were going to have peace about their mother was just to accept her as dead. “But what about when she comes back?” [MASK] asked. “Well, then, we can be happy that she’s resurrected.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Freeda	Had shaken her mother far too many times to bring her attention back when that hollowed-out stare overtook her eyes. Had crossed too many big streets alone to find a store that sold Argo starch when [MASK] was running low.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Freeda	Her mouth was wide open but she wouldn’t let the scream out; the scream stayed locked in the back of her throat as if this was all she had left of [MASK], a scream that wouldn’t come.
<name>him</name>	him	Tish	She was shaking with emotion and she hated for [MASK] to see her lose control. So she lost control anyhow. She didn’t even try to rock herself to calm herself. She allowed herself to shake, allowed cracked sniffing sounds to come up from her nose, her mouth.
<name>them</name>	them	Lynne	He remembered that the air was warm and smelled of rubbing alcohol and baby talc. There were two lumps in the bed for sure. Told himself he’d not expected otherwise. The gooseneck night lamp was angled toward the bed and drizzled [MASK] with yellow light.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Cliff	“And the tie would represent?” she asked. “What? Choices?” “Exactly, “[MASK] said. “Choices that men make, middle-aged men who feel that they’ve gotten the butter from the duck in terms of, in terms of what?
<name>Fireworks</name>	Fireworks	Sirens	She wasn’t entirely surprised by the lights. She’d had a feeling that she’d return to lights. [MASK] in fact would not have been a complete surprise. She had after all lived out her grandmother’s prophecies tonight.
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Freeda	Any longer and she’d start to wonder about her real father, which would spiral into thoughts about [MASK], indictable thoughts and she had enough self-awareness to know that she was constitutionally incapable of holding on to any thought that might indict her mother.
<name>Samuel</name>	Samuel	Delilah	Talked about the dinner he had at [MASK]’s at the train station, and how, when he returned, he’d had to compete with a shoe box preacher proclaiming the end of the world just steps from where he played.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Nan	She was seventeen and her menstrual cycle became erratic and she was afraid she was pregnant though she hadn’t actually had sex by then. Her junior prom date had come on her clothes, a sky blue satin gown hand-sewn by [MASK].
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Nan	and they’re tears of relief, but really it’s because I’ve been in the middle of going through something and my situation is making me tender and then her voice just, you know, makes me cry.” “No, I didn’t know that,” [MASK] said.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Neena	Now he was saying how unbelievably good the cake was, offered [MASK] a taste. “I’m still working on my soup,” she said. “Yeah? Were you an only child? They say only children eat slowly because they can.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Neena	The host took [MASK]’s coat and led her to a table in the corner near the back of the small room. The tablecloth was white muslin like the young man’s shirt, the walls were peach stucco, matching, she noticed, the color of the sweater she wore.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Neena	“Actually, I’m working tonight,” [MASK] said. “Yeah? What do you do? May I ask?” “Actually my employer sent me to seduce you, get you caught up in a scandal to bring you down.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Neena	“As a lawyer, [MASK], I’d advise you never to admit guilt, at least not right away. May I sit?” “Please, feel free,” she said. “Feel free, huh?” he said as he eased into the booth.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tish	She stopped at the pay phone in the hotel lobby and once again tried [MASK]’s number. Hung up as soon as she heard the click of the answering machine. Back in her room she slept some more. It was mid-afternoon when she woke.
<name>scarf</name>	scarf	Freeda	A hot pink raw silk [MASK] was when she was a happy girl, spreading herself out into a mesmerizing display with her thunderstorm hair and butter brown lips until her sadness hit and she’d scrunch herself up into a tight bland button and then poof, she was gone.
<name>Wendy</name>	Wendy	Lena	She was right about that, it was killing him the hard way, over and over, every night a new awful death; every morning a head-in-the-toilet resurrection. He started to cry then. “Save me, [MASK], please baby, save me.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Freeda	Forced to make that decision when she was trying to raise the girls and stretched to the end of her emotional capability dealing with the roller coaster of [MASK]’s comings and goings and she’d had to determine how best to parcel out what was left of her good attention.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Nan	She didn’t want to know. From minute to minute didn’t even believe this was her, [MASK], good-raised southern Christian girl going to these lengths to get the man of her obsessions with whom to make the daughter she was desperate for.
<name>Delores</name>	Delores	Freeda	Her mother’s bottomed-out moods always sending her down here to grovel with people she would barely acknowledge when she was up. When she was up she’d socialize with respectable men who’d take [MASK] and the girls to wholesome places like the Franklin Institute where they’d walk through the giant-sized heart.
<name>Lila</name>	Lila	Neena	One had to decide for himself if [MASK]’s features came together in a pleasing way: the droopy eyes that had a wildness about them, the pouty heart-shaped mouth, the asymmetrical cheekbones. Most men deciding her look was pleasing when taking into consideration the way her hips jutted despite her tall slender build.
<name>Tina</name>	Tina	Freeda	Even with the tug-of-war then in her mind that persisted up to today about whether [MASK] was mentally incapacitated or not, was it a chemical imbalance or the devil trying to get to her through her child.
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Alfred	Dresses worn by half of the women in here could have benefited from a redesign, she thought. Smiling now that [MASK] had told her to pretty up the area. She did giggle now and let out a small belch that made her laugh even harder.
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Freeda	To go where, to do what, she didn’t know. Continue her search for [MASK]? She’d been aware—though made a conscious decision not to dwell on, the fact—that she’d avoided punching in her mother’s name each time she’d used the library’s computer.
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Freeda	It would fill me up and empty me at the same time when she asked such a thing. On the one hand I loved the adoration we shared; on the other hand I knew that [MASK] should of been the recipient.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Tish	she said as soon as she heard the nonmale “hello” on the other end. The “hello,” though, hadn’t come from [MASK]. The “hello” was in that flat, airless tone.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Nan	She’d pour strong black coffee down his throat come morning so that he could go to work. To his credit he remained a hard worker, brought most of his pay-check home. He was never violent or excessively argumentative with [MASK].
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Really	[MASK] sat down beside him on the porch where he’d landed the night before trying to get to his keys; his urine glistened as it trailed down the steps and seeped into the garden where pink begonias were on display. “Do you think you even have it in you to stop?
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Neena	“I’m okay,” [MASK] said as she looked at the fallout and began unwinding toilet paper, to do what with it she didn’t know, toilet paper with this situation about as effective as cleaning chemical waste with an alcohol swab.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Tish	Then the first contraction hit, catapulting [MASK] from her dream. She felt as if her pelvis was a wishbone, Sumo wrestlers on either side fighting for the larger break. The alarm on the monitor strapped across her stomach began to cry and she squeezed the cord to call the nurse.
<name>Alfred</name>	Alfred	Nan	His pin-striped suit pressed to [MASK]’s high standards, his shirt crisply starched, a shine to his shoes. He was going to pick up his paycheck, he said, make sure he still had a job to go to come Monday given that he’d been absent for a week.
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Tish	You can finish the story.” “Story?” [MASK] said, a widening smile taking over her face, such a classic face with the pert nose and cleft in her chin and Gerber-baby brown eyes.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Nan	Wanted to say that her voice was music enough though he didn’t say it; this too was something he was unaccustomed to doing without benefit of strong drink, acting on his impulse with a woman. Though he felt moved to be impulsive with [MASK] right now.
<name>James</name>	James	Neena	He was coal black with silky straight hair; told [MASK] over the lavish dinner paid for by the drug company so that he would write their prescriptions that his wife married him mainly because she wanted her children to have pretty hair.
<name>Rita</name>	Rita	Nan	She was all dolled up with lipstick and rouge, her hair out, her voice like honey with a hint of a rasp that made his manhood stir. He smiled back at [MASK]. “Hey there, gorgeous.” “Do you even want to?
<name>Lenore</name>	Lenore	Neena	He banged his fist against the desk to stop himself. Asked [MASK] to excuse him for a second as he pushed the hold button and grabbed his fist and stood and yelled out, fuck, from the pain in his hand. Hoped he’d not broken his hand.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Tish	Today as she walked through the hotel lobby after her morning routine, she heard mention of her sister on the noon news. She stopped, paralyzed. There on the screen was a clip of her sister from a prior newscast. Had something happened to [MASK]?
<name>She</name>	She	Cliff	And she says, I don’t have a back door. And he looks at himself again in her pink robe, and he says, Okay, so where would you like a back door? [MASK] remembered that he’d laughed. Laughed so hard until his eyes ran.
<name>Algie</name>	Algie	Alfred	The seven months of married life with [MASK] had been filled to brimming with the embarrassing consequences of his love for drink. His putting his key in the wrong apartment door, and when the door didn’t open, just passing out there anyhow.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Neena	That fact nearly horrified [MASK] when she was finally able to admit it to herself. The night before she’d fallen asleep thinking how the lumps in the mattress had seemed to shift so that they were no longer rocks under her back; now they surrounded the print of her body, nestling her.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Sam	Then she went to visit her aunt and came back with a special solution for me to mop down the floors with, gave me special bath crystals, gave me candles to light, I ’clare it wasn’t a month later before [MASK] started bringing me ladylike gifts, perfumes, a charm bracelet.
<name>She</name>	She	Neena	They were at the edge of the creek that smelled of honeysuckle and sewage and he looked away from the creek, looked up at the sky and squinted, and [MASK] thought he had the saddest eyes. “Meaning?” she asked.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Tish	[MASK]’s condition as of yesterday was still fair. Today as she walked through the hotel lobby after her morning routine, she heard mention of her sister on the noon news. She stopped, paralyzed. There on the screen was a clip of her sister from a prior newscast.
<name>God</name>	God	Lord	You happy now, I’m saying it out loud. I was wrong. [MASK] knows I was wrong.” She placed his hand atop his thigh and lifted his left hand and began pulling and massaging each of those fingers.
<name>He</name>	He	Cade	She knew without having yet checked that the credit cards [MASK] had opened for her would be dead now, the bank accounts that he’d controlled where she’d foolishly put money that was legitimately hers; her cell phone too she was sure would be without service.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Nan	She didn’t say, just unfolded herself from his flute case and asked if she could please use his phone. She’d never called her in the middle of the night like this. She was surprised at how quickly she answered, how wide awake her voice. “[MASK],” she said.
<name>She</name>	She	Nan	Please be mine.” [MASK] could hear the snickers jumping from bed to bed and she told herself that the women were jealous; their husbands were neither as devoted nor as good-looking as her Alfred. She turned around then.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Freeda	She paused every time she walked through the dining room after that and looked at the envelope and said a prayer that was filled with expectation of good. Felt in her heart that the man, the envelope were a good sign that [MASK] would turn up soon.
<name>Francie</name>	Francie	Neena	“Well, then, we can be happy that she’s resurrected. But for now, she’s dead, [MASK], like that woman back there is dead. Let your mother be dead and ask the Good Lord to heal your broken heart.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Cliff	Though the basement had low ceilings because of the piping, so [MASK] refused to finish the basement, determined that if they had children they’d party upstairs so that some teenage boy in the middle of a growth spurt wouldn’t have to suffer as he did.
<name>Jimmy</name>	Jimmy	Malcom	As the heater man bit at her neck and struggled to free his manhood from his pants, she remembered how [MASK] had run behind her after he’d bagged her elbow macaroni and can of sockeye salmon, jar of Hell-mann’s mayonnaise and sweet pickled relish.
<name>Tasha</name>	Tasha	Goldie	She knew such relationships existed, but she’d never seen one up close. “Plus you used to could take a joke,” [MASK] went on. “You not going crotchety on me, are you?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Neena	Because the big bad wolf waits and waits and waits, nothing to do but sit and wait. He sits and waits.” He kept repeating himself then and [MASK] felt as if the lights had just been dimmed on the corner.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Neena	[MASK] realized that she still didn’t know what consumption was, though she never changed out of winter garb until after mid-March. Warm as it was today, she was wearing the peach cashmere sweater under her black wool coat.
<name>She</name>	She	Neena	“Well, the place I’m thinking about is five blocks away. You mind the walk?” [MASK] said that no, she didn’t mind the walk, even as her head made its objection known, light-headed from hunger, though she walked anyhow.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Mnh	[MASK].” She was quiet for a minute as she folded and refolded her hands in her lap. Then her nose started to run so she reached behind her to where she’d hung her purse on the back of her chair and pulled out her handkerchief.
<name>She</name>	She	Neena	If I say no, I’m saying you’re not ir-restible. And I’m not about to say you’re not irresistible.” [MASK] lowered her eyes, feigning shyness, though she actually felt shy.
<name>her</name>	her	Lynne	He came and cried. He kissed [MASK] and squeezed her and made cracked moaning sounds in her chest. He remembered that she held him; she held him and held on, her eyes pressed shut, he guessed, so that she couldn’t see him cry.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Neena	I have an emergency, my mother-in-law suffers from dementia and I just got a call, something’s happened at home and I need to get there.” “Oh God, no,” [MASK] said.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Neena	“Will you promise to call me tomorrow? Please, [MASK]. We could try again for tomorrow,” he said as he pulled the back of her chair out so that she could stand. She nodded as she reached around to the arm of her chair to retrieve her purse.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Almost	[MASK] wanted to put her feet up on the coffee table. The coffee table familiar, the brown and white tile shaped in a diamond that was at the center of the table. Her coffee table this was. The end tables and lamps hers too.
<name>Jackson</name>	Jackson	Ted	“What y’all drinking?” the waitress shouted just as they freed themselves from between the table and the mirrored wall. [MASK] pointed to the bar indicating they’d order there, their seats quickly taken up by a pair of women with big frosted hair.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Freeda	Mom!’ And meanwhile her mother is struggling to break free from [MASK]’s hug. ‘What’s happening in here?’ she asks. I guess it took a few seconds for her eyes to adjust to the dimmed view coming from the hurricane lamp.
<name>Lucifer</name>	Lucifer	Nan	[MASK] asked, crying openly now. “You yourself said I had the devil in me.” “That’s a manner of speak—” “But he has been after me—the devil. That’s why I left.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Alfred	And I asked her what’s pulling her down like that and she said a strong wind that has hands and eyes, big rough hands and Doberman pinscher eyes.” [MASK]’s voice caught in his throat and he swallowed hard.
<name>She</name>	She	Nan	He’d cry and sing “ ’Round Midnight” and then pass out. [MASK] convinced herself he was the best possible of drunks, told herself that if this was the worst storm life was sending her way, she could weather it. Except that she couldn’t.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Cliff	He didn’t tell [MASK] his rudeness was disrupting a transformation in the early stages. The first stage was always the stopping to listen the way this young lamb just had, meant that the receptivity was already in place.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Freeda	She started counting the money, hundred-dollar bills, and her jaw dropped lower the longer she counted. She could scarcely pick her jaw up from the floor to ask [MASK], who, who was he, why’d he leave money like that.
<name>Stevie</name>	Stevie	Goldie	Such a scene down home would mean a brick coming through the window with a stick of dynamite attached. Then [MASK] said, “Uh oh, that Negro look like he getting away. He fixing to cross the street and I didn’t even finish totaling you.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Nan	I sat out back and read my book. What is wrong with you anyhow?” “You big liar, you—” “I’m not lying—” “You will lie, I know that about you.” “Jesus, [MASK].”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Neena	Now he apologized to [MASK] for his rudeness just then by cutting her off. “It’s been a grueling day,” he said, “but that doesn’t excuse my poor manners.” He didn’t say that he was mainly irritated because it should have been his wife calling.
<name>Play</name>	Play	Face	“Oh, you a kidder, huh,” he said on a laugh. “Well, I like to play.” “No, no. For real,” she said. “That’s really my name. My last name is [MASK].
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Neena	“So this kid is a poster child for profiling, you know what I mean, [MASK]? Good student, from a good home, raised by both parents so they can’t throw around that no-father-around-drug-dealer-in-the-making bullshit.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Gordon	His finger should throb too, she thought, as she looked at the bottle of [MASK]’s to measure how much he’d drank. Told herself this was indeed a drunken stupor as she tugged and twisted the ring and thought about rubbing the finger down with shampoo, remembering then
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Neena	“No inkling her mind would go,” he’d say. “Sweetest girl you’d ever want to meet growing up, she would turn the lights on in here with her smile, like your smile, [MASK]. Never underestimate the power of a beautiful smile,” he’d say.
<name>Tasha</name>	Tasha	Goldie	And she was repulsed too. Had the simultaneous urges to both giggle and vomit as she followed [MASK] past women in painted-on clothes—that’s how tight their apparel—and men with shiny processed hair and suits cut too loud to wear to church.
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Nan	She took the cup and sat on the lopsided couch and sipped the coffee. She hadn’t had perked coffee in years, her coffee mostly coming from automatic drip—type machines. It was fresh and strong and reminded her of [MASK].
<name>Grizzly</name>	Grizzly	Devil	Feed it or watch it come after her with its big bear paws and tear the skin from her short cube of frame, crush her bones to the gristle, all the way to her soul that she didn’t even know who owned these days. [MASK] himself might own it by now.
<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Neena	“You want us to hold the bus? ” [MASK] nodded. “I think that creamer in my coffee must have been bad,” she said as she listened for the whoosh of the car door shutting, the music now muffled inside the closed-up car.
