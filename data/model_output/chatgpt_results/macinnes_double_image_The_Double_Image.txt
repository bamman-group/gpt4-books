<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Rosie	It was [MASK]’s way of giving an order. He rose from the abominable chair, caught sight of the giant yellow roses on the blue wallpaper, and groaned. “I hope you don’t ever have to sleep here.”
<name>Roark</name>	Roark	Partridge	“It’s better than having her dead, isn’t it?” Put that way, it was. “Well, I’d better get back to the Saint- Honore,” [MASK] said, glancing at his watch.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Chris	“Fine.” “But how did she delay—” “Post-mortems later,” [MASK] said, dropping his voice from its low tone into a whisper. “From now on, let our Greek friend do the talking.”
<name>Holly</name>	Holly	Craig	“At least,” he corrected himself, “that’s how it would appear to most people.” If I hadn’t been watching [MASK]’s face for the last ten minutes. I’d have called it casual, myself.
<name>He</name>	He	Partridge	That would only prove to the world that we are very, very stupid. It is not an agreeable label to have hung around our necks.” [MASK] stubbed out his half-finished cigarette. “Self-defeating,” he admitted.
<name>Ned</name>	Ned	Partridge	When they are on the point of hooking the really big fish, you know they aren’t going to waste time or run any unnecessary risks with a minnow.” “I wouldn’t rate you quite as small as a minnow,” [MASK] said with a smile.
<name>she</name>	she	Veronica	How was [MASK]? He looked over his shoulder, up towards where he had left her. He could see nothing except the deep band of heavy shadow under the long ledge of rock. He could stop worrying about her. It was the safest spot on all that bleak slope of hillside.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Duclos	If you can’t get it there, where can we meet you?” He halted as he stepped in front of [MASK], blocking his way. “Or perhaps you’d leave word at the desk for me where you’ve found a room?
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Craig	For at least ten seconds, he stared at [MASK], desperately searching for an evasion, another plausible defence, a subterfuge. His lips tightened, his eyes narrowed, his voice rose. “And you are prepared to stand in court and swear to it?
<name>her</name>	her	Craig	He was at his door, waving a good early morning to her, as the elevator reached his floor. She stepped inside quickly, not looking back, doing nothing to attract the attendant’s notice to [MASK]’s closing door. What, he thought, not even a blown kiss?
<name>someone</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	someone (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	Veronica	Waited. And then signed to [MASK] that they were moving on, over the rough flank of hill stretching northward. Let’s get as far away from that house as possible, he was thinking; as far away from that road into town, too.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Craig	“Any time, frankly.” “And meanwhile, I just keep looking across the harbour?” [MASK] asked, and did. “So far, no twin-diesel job is anywhere on the horizon. There’s that cabin cruiser over at the anchorage.
<name>Rainsford</name>	Rainsford	Tony	“But they all want to come,” [MASK] said in mock despair. “Then let them. They can sail over there and back, anyway. The launch will hold about thirty, tightly packed. In this sea there’s no danger.”
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Tillier	And he was thirsty. Not hungry—some of the awakening nausea still clung to his throat. He tried to forget his thirst by thinking about the Frenchman who had used the name of [MASK]. That was the man who had placed him, he was convinced.
<name>the interrogator</name>	the interrogator	Andre	He will be goaded to talk more, change his story, forget what he said hours before. And then, we have him.” “So you do think he is important?” [MASK] insisted, and some of his pride surged back.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Mimi	My news will keep, he thought, looking at the expectant faces. He put aside the memory of a hurried and horrible lunch, of the long, long journey to cover the equivalent of ten blocks between the restaurant and [MASK]’s. “Sorry I’m late.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Sue	“Smart to change them,” [MASK] said with one of her old light laughs. “Rouses hope way back in our minds that the secret police changes its nature along with its name. But security remains security, whether it’s KGV or any other title.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Partridge	Yes, if I were in [MASK]’s field, I’d be interested in recommendations. Because anyone ran make a mistake in recommending a man for a job, but no one can go on making recommendations that somehow always turn out to be against his own country’s interests.
<name>Don</name>	Don	Craig	His smile divided his face into two camps: below, was a rounded jaw line, a full underlip, a chin with a marked cleft; above, was a sharp nose, clever brown eyes, a remarkable brow. He’d probably sell a lot of refrigerators, [MASK] decided.
<name>Mr. Gatsby</name>	Mr. Gatsby	Holland	“Put away those silly pistols. What a ridiculous figure you cut!” Then he looked at [MASK]. “A man of your age, and of some experience no doubt, ought to know better than to come in here like an American gangster.”
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Madame	He rose to open the dining-room door still more for [MASK]’s wide-spread elbows. “You swim also?” she asked. “Our visitors admire our beaches.” “I think I’ll walk around the town and admire the windmills. ”
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Partridge	Or to listen to me? “She’d think we were—” he half smiled, in spite of his worry—“crazy.” “You just can’t warn people by telling them a little,” [MASK] agreed. As I’ve found out, he thought.
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Maritta	“He’s been trying to make up his mind whether he ought to keep an eye on [MASK], or whether he should ’phone in his report. I know the feeling well... The telephone wins, I hope... Good.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Elias	“She does nothing without a purpose. Well— make up your mind. I’m leaving. The same way as I came in?” she asked [MASK]. “Do you remember it?” “I hope so. I spent a lot of energy memorising it.”
<name>He</name>	He	Craig	Trade routes and colonies and coaling stations have had their eras. Of course, you might say that today the new control points for extension of power are newspapers, radio, televis—Something wrong?” “Nothing.” [MASK] hoped his voice was nonchalant enough.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Bannerman	It was forty minutes later, almost six o’clock, before [MASK] strolled in. He looked around the few tables that were occupied— this was a fisherman’s haunt; later in the evening it would be crowded with them—and said, “You’ve got good taste in cafes.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Partridge	“She knows nothing at all.” “Why did they invite her?” “Not out of the kindness of their hearts,” [MASK] told him. “How well do you know the girl? And that’s not a casual question.
<name>Lang</name>	Lang	Washington	“I know,” he sympathised, “you must feel completely frustrated. Such a brilliant operation to end with the capture of the wrong man. What will [MASK] say?” He turned to the two Greeks, who were taking their place on either side of him.
<name>Draco</name>	Draco	Andre	“How could there be? It was you who insisted on searching him when we brought him here. You wouldn’t let anything slip past you. Of course not—” “He was of no importance anyway,” [MASK] said, tightfaced.
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Craig	He stood there only for a few seconds as he recovered breath and dignity, then stalked off in high dudgeon. To the nearest telephone? His report would be a shocker. [MASK] thought, watching the dwindling figure of the hurrying man, watching the two official cars speed away with their prisoner.
<name>Mr. Stevens</name>	Mr. Stevens	Craig	[MASK] asked, clearly but pleasantly. The man who had opened the door, a dark silhouette against the light from the hall behind him, stood in stolid silence, unmoving. Then, “Come in,” he said, drawing aside. “That’s all right.
<name>Langley</name>	Langley	Bannerman	[MASK] nodded. “There was one of our agents with him constantly—pretended he was some kind of assistant and close friend. We couldn’t have a phalanx of guards around the pseudo expert; that would have looked too obvious, as if we were expecting trouble.
<name>she</name>	she	Elias	He looked over his shoulder, up towards where he had left her. He could see nothing except the deep band of heavy shadow under the long ledge of rock. He could stop worrying about her. It was the safest spot on all that bleak slope of hillside. And where was [MASK]?
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Ronnie	But irony was lost on her. Or she had finished with the topic of uncle. She said, “You are telephoning [MASK] tomorrow morning, aren’t you?” “I said I would.” “She won’t be able to lunch with you.”
<name>Alcohol</name>	Alcohol	Suspicions	[MASK] could become a neurosis, even a mania. They could destroy his work, all his career. “I’m going back to my hotel and telephone the Embassy. If it is closed, I shall visit it tomorrow morning on my way to the airport.
<name>He</name>	He	Partridge	And there are a couple of other men who have been making weekly visits behind stage. They’re due to turn up this evening. So the cloakroom attendant tells me.” “Have you talked much with her?” [MASK] asked quickly. “No, no.
<name>Irene</name>	Irene	Ronnie	“No, no, no,” she said quickly, “I was only thinking that my uncle would be very shocked if he heard that [MASK] had— what do you say?—picked you up. It really is a joke, you know.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Craig	“I like it. Especially the bit where you make them break their rules. They’ll learn each other’s real names from you.” He laughed softly. “They don’t know—” began [MASK] in astonishment. “Neither name nor occupation.
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Partridge	And that’s all, he reminded himself as he reached the three steps to the porch. Keep it simple: that’s what [MASK] advised you. And check your arsenal. The automatic was deep in his right-hand pocket; the knife in his left.
<name>Rainsford</name>	Rainsford	Ardouin	[MASK] asked, shaking his head. These Americans... “Why not? This place seems to have its regulars.” He glanced at some new arrivals, recognising them faintly from his last visit “She may be one of them. Good luck with the war machines!”
<name>she</name>	she	Sussman	She was in control of herself by the time he had handed them over. She could face him for a moment, saying, “Thank you,” before she stepped out into the street. Quite beautiful, [MASK] had said, and the old boy had been right.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Names	[MASK] had a habit of slipping out sometimes, as he had just proven to himself. “// you insist on talking with her. But why? And have you a real excuse? You’ll need it, or you’ll be blown sky-high.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Duclos	“If you prefer it that way—” He shrugged, walking beside [MASK]. “Just one thing,” he added, “have you got a room definitely at the King George? That’s where I am and it’s crowded.
<name>He</name>	He	Duclos	“Nothing to declare,” he told the Greek who had checked his two cases. Nothing except good intentions and high expectations. [MASK] picked up his luggage and started towards the wall of glass windows which lay at the end of the small Customs Hall, separating it from a corridor packed with waiting people.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Tony	“Much too good a tune to let die away unsung.” [MASK] addressed the distant cafe impatiently in his low voice, “Come on, boys, come on. You finished the introduction six bars ago. Must do better than that for the party tomorrow night.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Tillier	“How did he die?” The two policemen exchanged glances. “He fell from his window,” [MASK] said. “And it was of such a nature, I assure you, that he could not have overbalanced and fallen.
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Partridge	Here, with open ground around and a chance to dodge and run, he doubted if any man was going to find it intimidating. [MASK] pulled a revolver and a silencer from a pocket, fitted them together, handed the complete weapon over, and took the automatic in exchange.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jules	“Let’s get the dust out of my throat, first, shall we? And what about resting our backs in a comfortable chair?” He took a sip of his drink, gave [MASK] his approval, and led the way to a table against a wall.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Rosenfeld	That is what we were supposed to think, I’m sure. And that’s how we gave it out to the press.” [MASK] was still thinking about the pencil stub. “It’s all wrong—using a valuable drop for a simple message like that.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	John	All I do is eat and eat. And sit brooding. Don’t be so alarmed, [MASK]. I’ll soon get rid of this.” She smacked her waistline lightly, threw her arms wide. “I’m free, I’m free, I’m free!
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Craig	[MASK] stared. “It’s a bit late in the year for that.” “You know, funny thing, that’s how I remembered your face. I’ll never forget you hobbling on crutches around the campus— broke a leg, didn’t you?
<name>Mr. Duffy</name>	Mr. Duffy	Paul	The inter-island boats were that way, not over here, this was where the liners docked and there the freighters; aim left now, go beyond the wharves, those ones—see? “I know the way,” said [MASK] and made a wrong turning.
<name>who</name>	who	Maritta	“No, no,” he said urgently, “keep smiling as we talk. Please. The monster is watching us.” Her eyes flickered over towards the man [MASK] had sent. He was staring at her, in that grim and sullen way which she disliked so much.
<name>her</name>	her	Craig	she told him, and led the way. It was a quick and complete tour through corridors, under arches that supported ceilings, up and down narrow staircases, past corners of rooms jutting at odd angles. It left [MASK] a little dazed, almost breathless.
<name>Cleopatra</name>	Cleopatra	Madame	The coffee arrived with one of [MASK]’s laughing handmaidens, and they could drop the light chitchat. Upstairs, the beds had been made, the rooms tidied, and there was no more rustling at the windows, no more whispered comments on the two men sitting so lazily in the garden.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Veronica	And I thought you were someone [MASK] could trust, quite apart from being two Americans in a foreign land. Then she said that she had wanted to speak to you, this morning, but—just couldn’t; you might be embarrassed, you weren’t really interested in her or her troubles.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Craig	“My one mistake,” he said, half to himself. The mask was back in place. “Is that how you like to imagine yourself?” He smiled tolerantly. [MASK] was empty-handed, his revolver stuck back in his belt.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Partridge	The dark-haired one—” “I haven’t seen the photograph, just heard about it,” [MASK] told him. “There was a fair-haired girl at the table, too. Who was she?”
<name>Mr. Norton</name>	Mr. Norton	Partridge	A sleeper, they’d call me in the trade. [MASK] isn’t trusting me for my honest grey eyes; or the books I’m planning to write; or the friends I have chosen. He isn’t judging me on these things, not by a long, long mile.
<name>probably</name>	probably	Craig	All set? Remember—fast and silent, don’t give him time to yell a warning. A shout could carry back to the headland.” And there were two men near there, [MASK] remembered, guarding the approach to the house itself.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	John	How nice that some people don’t change much! Reassuring, somehow. But what are you thinking about, [MASK]?” It certainly wasn’t about college dramatics, or week-end skiing parties, or all the girls he hadn’t married.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Craig	[MASK] always found that his brain worked best if he brought himself right up against his problems, examined their variables, and then established the precedence of their importance. Nice comforting procrastinations, a general wait-and-see feeling, were not for him.
<name>Renault</name>	Renault	Craig	“Friends sheltered my wife and children, got them false names, false papers, saved them. There wasn’t much that could be done to disguise me.” He tapped his nose, smiling, but watching [MASK] closely. “I almost reached the Swiss border.
<name>Trump</name>	Trump	Stalin	Now what? he wondered. He thought he might try a question to start them off again; they were looking at him with polite expectancy. What about something wild like when will [MASK] become an okay word again?
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Craig	[MASK] saw him, froze for a moment, reached back into the car for his raincoat. “That’s everything, I think.” His words felt as tight as his face. He avoided glancing in the man’s direction.
<name>Straker</name>	Straker	Paris	“Still talking with [MASK] and points west. He’s on the upper floor of that windmill just above the breakwater with a couple of other hard-working types. Don’t tell him I know.” He stopped, listening, his head cocked to one side.
<name>I</name>	I	Duclos	“Don’t worry,” she said. “She will be luckier than [MASK].” She left them, walking swiftly, her graceful stride surviving even the broken paving stones. She waved back. “See you tomorrow,” she called over her shoulder.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Partridge	“Perhaps I’m jumping off on the wrong foot.” A smile flickered at the back of [MASK]’s eyes. “You’ve saved me a lot of time,” he said blandly. “Any further ideas?” “Just one question.
<name>Krebs</name>	Krebs	Partridge	He could see no join, no seam in the heavy bar of the clip. “This way,” [MASK] said, taking it from him, sliding the top apart. In the lower section, there nestled a small strip of microfilm protected by an equally small strip of tissue paper.
<name>he</name>	he	Craig	Last time, perhaps you were listening to depressing talk?” From the doorway farther down the curving street, on its opposite side a man in a black overcoat stepped out and came walking slowly towards the cafe. For a moment, [MASK] had no answer.
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Craig	But there was no retreat in the quieted voice. “You know, I agree with every word you say. Only, I do see things from a different angle, from a different set of facts.” “Of course,” said [MASK], coldly.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bannerman	It’s a damned loud whistle from here to there.” “Relax, relax... That’s all set up. Why do you think I’ve been waiting here?” [MASK] glanced at his watch. “They should be passing any minute now.”
<name>McCarthy</name>	McCarthy	Rosenfeld	“Yet we had information that a Communist agent was going to be at that party tonight.” [MASK] halted completely. “Are you serious?” “Never more serious.” “Any name?” “No. But there was a photograph of the man.
<name>Aravis</name>	Aravis	John	“I won’t draw her into danger, [MASK],” she said very softly. “Let me worry about her. Meanwhile. You can’t.” “All right,” he said, and stood aside to let her enter.
<name>her</name> (Note: There is no proper name that fills in the [MASK] token in this passage. The answer is "her," which is a pronoun.)	her (Note: There is no proper name that fills in the [MASK] token in this passage. The answer is "her," which is a pronoun.)	Erica	Don’t underestimate her, my friend. You did not like her? In one way, that has a big advantage. You will be able to keep your mind on business when you work with her. Oh, yes, you may have to see more of [MASK].
<name>Mr. Gatz</name>	Mr. Gatz	Androuet	But even if it had no stretch of front windows, or no view of the rear courtyard, its position was good: it lay along the side wall of the apartment house, right up against the four-storey building of [MASK]’s garage.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Craig	In a few minutes, they had walked through five of those quiet criss-crossing streets, the porter always a little ahead, for there was no room for two to walk abreast in comfort unless closely arm in arm. A town with possibilities, thought [MASK].
<name>Calypso</name>	Calypso	Mimi	Think—” “I’ve thought of it,” he said bitterly. Marble shimmering in the moonlight, a mile of ancient columns and temples, a silver sea around them. “An island all to ourselves. I can even set it to music.” [MASK] shrugged.
<name>himself</name>	himself	Rosie	He gave [MASK] six minutes before he buckled the belt of his coat, turned up its collar to hide his clean shirt, pulled on a battered hat with a dipping brim, slipped off his glasses and put them into his pocket.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Craig	[MASK] could be a tough customer if he chose. “Yes. We’ll catch him, and a lot more besides.” “Well, what’s being done about it? Don’t you think you owe me a holding explanation ast least?
<name>Uncle Tom</name>	Uncle Tom	Craig	The entry through the gate in the white wall was sedate, circumspect. Sweat could now break out on four brows. Firmly, [MASK] turned the mule’s head towards the path on his left. It was quite dark here, with bushes and shrubs growing wild.
<name>The receptionist</name>	The receptionist	Madame	Reservation, passport... It was the usual routine. [MASK] made it protocol. He floundered through a Greek phrase, trying to ease the extreme formality, and was corrected firmly. So he fell silent. She studied him as he signed the register.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Jordan	“Tough,” said [MASK]. “You always liked him. When did you last see him?” “We had a drink together on the day he died.” “How was he then? I mean—it’s a really terrible thing, suicide.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Madame	[MASK] whispered as she led him along a twisting corridor. Indeed, he did. That morning, it had been part of their tour of inspection. The rooms were unused in this wing of the house, under change and construction for the summer season.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Veronica	He complained a lot, though.” “And it happened just before you left?” “Why, yes.” “[MASK],” he asked quickly, “will you help me?” He looked deep into her blue eyes. “I mean that.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Craig	There was a mixed stream of Mykoniots and visitors beginning to run up the quay. [MASK] bundled his coat tightly around the camera case, looked for the likeliest small boy. He found one, trying to edge his way into the steadily growing crowd.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Ardouin	He noticed that the car, parked not far away, had started to leave, too. He wondered whether he might not have ended inside it if he had started to tell [MASK] to ’phone for the police, for anyone, to catch a man who was possibly connected with a murder.
<name>he</name>	he	Craig	“I like it, but I’m not going to let you do it. You’ve forgotten two things: yourself, and what could come afterwards.” “But I’m leaving that to you,” [MASK] said with a smile.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Insarov	[MASK] wasn’t even flattered. He looked at the Frenchman contemptuously. Did he really think this was a proper interrogation? “If you had questioned the cloakroom attendant thoroughly, for several days, we might have had one piece of information to rely on.
<name>Miss Caroline</name>	Miss Caroline	Mimi	[MASK] shrugged her shoulders as much as to say, “Well, it isn’t my fault.” Then she smiled gently. “They don’t come into town. They seem to stay around the garden, in the shade of the trees or on the porch, which is well covered.
<name>the body</name>	the body	O’Malley	They worked quickly and silently. The unconscious men were dragged to the side of the road, their jackets and rough sweaters removed, their mouths gagged with tape, their hands and feet tied. Two of the Greeks were improvising a sling to carry [MASK] down to the beach.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Demetrios	“Everything according to plan,” [MASK] assured him, and laughed contemptuously. He was beginning to feel very, very good, indeed. Quickly—and it was a pleasure to speak in Greek again—he rattled off the orders for the disposal of the body.
<name>James</name>	James	Craig	And their height? Around average, no more than a couple of inches’ difference between them. They both could qualify. So did every other man at the party, last night, except [MASK] and the Australian.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Partridge	He picked up both their cups, rose, and emptied them into a pot of flowers. [MASK] had been studying him as if he were deciding something. Suddenly, he made up his mind. “What worries me is simply this. Everything is moving far too quickly.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Ronnie	“My uncle—I suppose [MASK] told you all about him?” “No. We had scarcely time to talk about families. She just mentioned that an uncle had lent you a house for the summer, and she was going to spend a few weeks with you.
<name>Max</name>	Max	Veronica	“I think,” he said, moving towards the hall, “I hear [MASK] now.” He ignored the servant with the tray, although it was hard to be oblivious of someone he had shouldered off the jetty into the harbour only four hours ago.
<name>Pablo Escobar</name>	Pablo Escobar	Rosenfeld	“That implies he was trying to get rid of you.” “Then who is he?” “Perhaps working for Interpol—narcotics.” “But the connection with [MASK]—” “There is no actual connection we have been able to discover.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Craig	It must have. The boy’s eyes opened wide, bright with a new excitement. He grinned widely, tapped the side of his nose, pushed his way through the fringes of the crowd, headed for town. [MASK] straightened his legs, pulling on his sweater.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Androuet	“[MASK] didn’t see them, anyway. I drew him out of the garage by pretending to notice something interesting on the street, and then wandering out to have a look at it. He followed me like a lamb.”
<name>Anatole</name>	Anatole	Partridge	[MASK] said, “The men who escaped turned out to be very much alive. After the war was over, they appeared in their own countries—mostly Eastern European—where they helped establish Communist governments. That was what they were, Communists.
