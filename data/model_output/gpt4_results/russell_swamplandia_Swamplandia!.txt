<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Emily	Did [MASK] wish for the hand to be there? Was she just sort of tolerating it on her thigh for now, like a benign starfish that had become mysteriously attached to her? He ran a finger around the thin band.
<name>Tadashi</name>	Tadashi	Louis	I couldn’t have held on to their real bodies more forcefully. At no point do I remember wanting to let go. When I flipped onto my side, making a panicked grab for my mother’s yellow cloth and [MASK]’s sinking coat, I saw the alligator.
<name>Marco</name>	Marco	Kiwi	“I’m going to drink from the faucet. [MASK], I’m going to drink water for an hour.” “Sure. Come on, get in the shade.” They were on a strip of rocky beach surrounded on all sides by mangroves and thin palms.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Ava	The note was very formal. “Sincerely, [MASK],” I wrote, because the Bird Man was watching me and “I love you” or even just “Love” struck me as a childish sign-off. Then I took the telephone off the hook.
<name>Quoyle</name>	Quoyle	Kiwi	FERRY SERVICE SUSPENDED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE said a sign on the gangplank. [MASK] sat through the intensifying rain for an hour and fifty minutes, the time it took for the bus to repeat its loop, and for that entire period he stared in the direction of the island.
<name>Jacob</name>	Jacob	Leo	Fucking unbelievable, right?” He rolled his eyes toward the stage. There was something puppyish about the conflict on [MASK]’s face. He was clearly torn between his first impulse toward wonderment, a panting and ignorant enjoyment, and his obedience to their pack of three.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Ava	You’re scared. See? You’re angry because you think the Chief is going to die, too.” “Huh? No I don’t!” “You’re angry at him but it’s too early, [MASK].” “Never mind.”
<name>Wolff</name>	Wolff	Leo	Instead, he took his uniform shirts and his losery boxer shorts into the dormitory showers and washed them with [MASK]’s dark green dandruff shampoo, which burned like acid on your skin. Somehow it had gotten onto his balls and into the webbing between his fingers and the shit just hunkered there like cold fire.
<name>Yolanda</name>	Yolanda	Harold	For some reason he told him the exact date in a whisper. He could hear [MASK] coughing up banana inside the cabin; another resident was cycling through her television channels. “We didn’t tell you, I don’t know, we didn’t want to . . .”
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Kiwi	Real whales, [MASK] had to believe, were less orderly but more expedient about their consumption of plankton. There were no lines winding around outside their great teeth, no hand stamps and tickets; the real whales just opened wide and destroyed.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Ossie	My sister! I couldn’t quit rubbing at my eyes. “You okay?” [MASK] walked over to my bed. Like me, she was quilted with rashes and burn; she’d showered for close to an hour and her skin had a scoured look.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Kiwi	Rationalizations buzzed inside him as he slid the bills out. Owed me, these shrill voices in [MASK] droned on and on, bees swaying in columns in the dark room, until he’d pocketed even the change. Pennies. A lintlike currency, value that collected in corners.
<name>Chaz</name>	Chaz	Ava	“You got to remind the mainlanders that your alligator is a no-shit dinosaur, [MASK],” the Chief used to lecture me. “Those bored, dead drylanders. They act like they think they’re watching robots up here!” He’d shake his head.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Ossie	Then it was over; I was a jumble of limbs in the marl. Somehow I managed to hang on to the thin stem all the way to the bottom. “Here!” I screamed, thrusting the crushed orchid at [MASK]. “Your ghost is a jerk.
<name>Kiwi</name>	Kiwi	Kiwi	[MASK] was the only Bigtree with zero injuries—no stitches, no scars. He’d once cut his pointer finger opening a can of cherry soda after a wrestling match. He tried to imagine his ladylike hands throttling up inside a floatplane.
<name>Elara</name>	Elara	Louis	The cattails hushed around the dredge, shushing each other and brushing close to the ship like alien observers. That’s what [MASK] remembered, the purple sky and the grasses winding upward—the world felt as though it were a bubble curving in on itself.
<name>Franklin</name>	Franklin	Kiwi	[MASK]’s plans to save the park—or at least to forestall bankruptcy, to keep the family afloat until August or even September—these plans were off to a sluggish start. He had an envelope of twenties, but it wasn’t his salary—he had stolen this money from the Chief.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Kiwi	It was a communication so private even [MASK] wasn’t certain what he was trying to tell his father. With the money he was saying “thank you” and “keep this job.” So far as he knew.
<name>He</name>	He	Kiwi	Wrists and elbows went flying through the air in some jujitsu of lady-empathy. [MASK] thought that he should take down Field Notes but he was still smarting from night school and his testing hand was actually cramping. The girls never bothered to exchange names with him.
<name>Lincoln</name>	Lincoln	Kiwi	Success, in this instance, meant an outpouring of terrible yellow bile from the plunger cap. The good news: [MASK] had a place to live. Employees at the World of Darkness could apply to live in a block of staff dormitories in the basement of the complex.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ossie	I lay awake waiting for her return until 3:22 a.m. When you are waiting for somebody for that long, your ceiling fan can whip ordinary air into a torture. I must have finally nodded off, because when I woke again there was [MASK], snoring lightly in her black cotton dress.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Vijay	[MASK] was wearing dark wraparound sunglasses and eating Advil in Halloween fistfuls. “I’ll put the mace into your face, bitch!” he sang along with the radio. They pulled into a space between two whiskery palms, both boys shading their eyes from the sun’s rays off the white quartzite.
<name>Alaska</name>	Alaska	Ossie	And on a calendar that summer really is over, I guess. Full stop. [MASK] and I attended a public school in the fall where they made us wear uniforms in the dull sepias and dark crimsons of fall leaves, these colors that were nothing like the fire of my alligator’s skin.
<name>He</name>	He	Whip	He had picked up on his fear and now he was tailoring the show for him. “My cousin has been telling me stories about her mother. I never knew her, regrettably—wrong side of the family,” the Bird Man said. [MASK] shot me a look.
<name>Callum</name>	Callum	Euphon	[MASK] had whispered, both of them staring at the hulk of the dredge. Its digger arm was as tall as a house and sunk deep into a quagmire. A pair of enormous cast-steel feet gave the contraption a drunken, donkey-legged appearance.
<name>Enoch</name>	Enoch	Kiwi	“substantial debt load.” So after work, [MASK] mailed a money order directly to the bank. Fourteen dollars and twenty-two cents, the change in his stupid World trousers. What was left of his salary after food and rent.
<name>Stevie</name>	Stevie	Denny	“Ha-ha! Four months does sound like a long time. And there’s no way to, ah, expedite the process?” “Ex-speed-ite.” [MASK] frowned. “You sure that’s how it’s pronounced?
<name>Bradley</name>	Bradley	Kiwi	His rage felt wonderful, like cake icing in his mouth. Pure lipids dissolving onto his taste buds. [MASK] didn’t care for middle-aged women. He found them all to be ugly, flighty, soft. Their wrinkles enraged him. Their dyed or graying hair.
<name>Eleanor</name>	Eleanor	Ava	“[MASK], come here,” the man said to me again—shouted, really— in his new voice. In the history of sound, nobody has ever said a girl’s name that way before. Like it was a string you could pluck.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Kiwi	She is staring at me! Their eyes met. Her hair was rising and twirling continuously into a slow fountain above her pale temples and her two eyes were open, black and alert. She’s conscious, [MASK] had time to think. Awake under the lake.
<name>Moths</name>	Moths	Moths	She freed a tiny, beating moth from my bangs. [MASK] kept coming at us in unbelievable numbers. “My God,” she whispered, “there must be thousands of them in here!” “More than that.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Kiwi	They were busy chatting up two old women, two gargoyles in flowery pantsuits near the roulette wheel, hoping to find “female patrons” to support their gambling. They had a little routine, which they’d explained to [MASK] in the car. “The pitch.”
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	Kiwi	[MASK] got paid $5.75 an hour to work as part of an army of teenage janitors. Park greeters, security officers, customer service reps, costumers, janitors: all of them pimpled gum chewers, deodorized for war.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Kiwi	Look anywhere hut at my mother, he’d think at thirteen, and also: Stand up for her ovation, you assholes.) Someone was taking a photograph of him, and others followed suit. Someone patted a thick towel around [MASK]’s shoulders.
<name>Sharks</name>	Sharks	Seths	Every Saturday evening (and most weeknights!) of our childhoods, our mom performed the Swimming with the [MASK] act and she always won. For a thousand shows, we watched our mother sink into black water, rise.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Kiwi	“So we decided to get you a little something. Think of it as an early birthday present, like . . He swung the closet door open and [MASK]’s heart stopped. The boys had put up a poster: a shiny centerfold from a porn magazine.
<name>Case</name>	Case	Kiwi	The Chief sat down at a small table. His wrestler’s fists joined into one tremendous, pale stone under the microphone; he stared sightlessly out at the crowd of slot machines. The first thing [MASK] noticed was the complex graininess of the Chief’s skin.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bella	[MASK] dropped her hand and frowned at him. “This money isn’t for . . . that. I’m here to repay a loan. Miss, could you give this to that man over there?” “Who?
<name>Francis</name>	Francis	Louis	[MASK] was often awake until the filmy predawn, listening to the hum of the mosquitoes as if even this were something holy. He was in love with everybody, with the heat and the stink and the foul teakettle dredge that had cut a channel so far from his childhood.
<name>Brad</name>	Brad	Vijay	Their polo shirts might as well have been rags soaked in kerosene. “You sure you’re okay to drive, [MASK]?” “What, do you want to drive, asshole? No? You want to walk? All right then.”
<name>Stanton</name>	Stanton	Bigtree	You speak like an orator. Look at that hair. I thought you were a professor emeritus. Ohkaaay, so let’s review—you broke the vacuum. What is this, your first week? Your third week. Terrific. Keep up the good work, [MASK].”
<name>Connor</name>	Connor	Kiwi	If it was the second one I needed to stay quiet. Oh but [MASK], I can’t guess the answer from his voice. “Kid, pull another stunt like that one and you will get yourself killed.” I nodded my chin into his hand.
<name>Jonah</name>	Jonah	Louis	I mean I actually pictured myself inside of him. Black hair and swinging elbows. When I closed my eyes I pretended I was [MASK], being carried. I could see him rising like a limp balloon into the clouds beneath the birds’ beating wings.
<name>Callie</name>	Callie	Ava	Only a traitor talks that way.” “Why do you want to stay here so badly?” I kicked a rock. Why save your own life? “Because it’s our home, dummy.” “But everybody moves, [MASK].
<name>Wonders</name>	Wonders	Darkness	One Tuesday in late January, just a week or two after the World of [MASK]’s grand opening, the morning ferry failed to show. On an ordinary weekday, the double-decker ferry departed from the Loomis County Ferry Port at 9:05 and arrived at our park’s landing a few minutes after ten o’clock.
<name>Nurse Ratched</name>	Nurse Ratched	Ossie	“What’s everybody so damn glum about?” the Chief mumbled. He swallowed his humongous second serving of cake in three bites, and then he quickly finished the half piece that [MASK] had left on her plate, his shoulders glugging up and down like an anhinga swallowing a fish.
<name>L.T.</name>	L.T.	Louis	“We are a couple now. We live together here—” She touched her heart through the thin cotton. I noticed two initials embroidered on the shirt pocket in raspberry thread: L.T. “You and the ghost.” “Me and [MASK].”
<name>Zephyr</name>	Zephyr	Ossie	Hours had passed since we’d returned from the Last Ditch, and already the dredge had taken on a pleasant, hallucinatory quality in my memory. [MASK] did a studious belly flop onto her mattress, frowning down at the Model Land Company map through her white bangs.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ossie	I’d think very loudly across the chasm between our two beds. Get back in your grave! You leave my sister alone! [MASK] told me that when she left our room at night she was going on “dates” to meet these ghosts in the woods.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Elsewhere	The swamp was a waste and men had built the machines to fix it. Something was happening down below. The whole deck had begun to vibrate. [MASK] the other cranemen were racing around, hauling water to put out the small fires that had spread now to the houseboat.
<name>He</name>	He	Kiwi	A woman was standing on the coastline, jumping up and down. [MASK] looked closer, startled: she was waving and waving at them, in some kind of real distress. All he could really make out was the frenzy of her beating arms. Later
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ava	My father was sipping at a third cup of black coffee. He glanced up at us with the dreamy look of a mutt leashed to a tree. “It’s a stage, [MASK]. We’ve been over this. You want me to talk to her?”
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Bobby	“This money isn’t for . . . that. I’m here to repay a loan. Miss, could you give this to that man over there?” “Who? [MASK]?” “May-be ...”
<name>August</name>	August	Ossie	“Shh, [MASK]. He’s taking this news okay.” But at one point I looked up at him and saw a shock of orange. My father had put a whole small orange in his mouth, peel and all, and he was chew-
<name>Junior</name>	Junior	Kiwi	He waited for his father to throw the first punch. What the heck kind of wrestling move was this? [MASK] wondered, watching the Chief’s palms lift and separate. Some kung fu trick? With his huge palms held outward, the Chief shaped a prodigious apology on the air.
<name>Victor</name>	Victor	Vijay	[MASK] was looking at him strangely. “You cannot work there. Not to sound arrogant, bro? But without me around, they will destroy you.” “What are you talking about?” Who could he mean, “they”? The skanks?
<name>grouper</name>	grouper	Seth	We ate the rest of lunch in silence: tinned ham and little pinkie-length fishes packed in oil, most of which I fed to the red [MASK]. Our food was running low now. We had, what? Cooler i contained six hard-boiled eggs.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Kiwi	“Can you at least put her name in there? It’s H-I-L-O-L-A.” [MASK] started talking faster. He heard his voice taking on the Chief’s ringleader intonations. This is how I can help them.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ossie	The Chief had started screaming at these men on the ferry dock, but now that we were home he seemed angry with us: “What’s wrong with you girls? You need to calm down.” He patted [MASK] stiffly. “Those clowns are gone.
<name>Yvette</name>	Yvette	Louis	And I could feel them, under the jacket, eight points of pressure against my sternum. This wasn’t a real possession: I could also feel the mud squeeze into my sneakers, hear thunder. I could fold [MASK]’s thin collar under my fingers and inhale the chalky mosquito wire.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Ava	Sky-wise, he’d fallen out of [MASK]’s kapok tree house at age ten and broken both arms. “Huh. Forty-five thousand dollars. And how does one enroll in the, uh, the flight school?”
<name>Auschenbliss</name>	Auschenbliss	Louis	The Mariner, [MASK] thought—this line bubbled up to him from some long-forgotten event, a poetry recitation that the youngest Auschenbliss had given at a church assembly many winters ago. The bright-eyed Mariner . . .
<name>Orpheus</name>	Orpheus	Louis	I thought of how he’d left his surname “Auschenbliss” floating miles behind him like molt feathers or snakeskin. “My mom had a name that she tore off, too,” I heard myself saying. “Like [MASK].
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Ava	“No, [MASK]. I haven’t heard anything.” She smiled an old, brave smile at me. “I’m looking.” Somehow I had worked it out in my mind to where I could believe in our mother without having to believe in ghosts exactly.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Ephraim	[MASK] said. His reedy voice was loud enough to echo throughout the Coils, the purple foyer to the whale’s belly. A few young mothers pushing their whale-fluked rental strollers looked over disapprovingly. “I do not want to sleep with you, dude!
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	Ava	I pictured this withdrawal as something invisible, painful, autonomic, a reflexive ejection, like a Seth disgorging feathers. “Oh, it’s much worse than that stuff you hear on the radio. Your heart breaks, too, but that’s just kid’s stuff, [MASK].
<name>Remy</name>	Remy	Kiwi	Crutches were bad for business, the Chief liked to say. “Why announce your infirmities to the tourists, kids?” Can he see me? Do I want him to? [MASK] blinked out of the shadows, mere feet from the seething lights of the casino floor.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Kiwi	[MASK] stood for a moment longer outside the cherry-red door that led back into the World of Darkness, enjoying the feeling of the warm outside air against his back. The outermost rail of the overpass glowed in a thin gold parabola at this hour, like some interplanetary racetrack.
<name>Arturo</name>	Arturo	Kiwi	In the back lot a few motorcycles and one dust-red Chevrolet were parked beneath the lamps. The night was a bowl of heat. No moon, no stars. [MASK] was surprised to see the Chief working here, but it was a dull and terrible surprise.
<name>he</name>	he	Kiwi	Even the behat-ted, popcorn-munching tourists in the stadium got the scoop on him. His parents, his grandfather, his sisters, the alligators, his own deep tissues—everybody had him figured for a coward, but [MASK] wouldn’t catch on until he heard his own scream.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Whip	“What in the hell is wrong with your cousin, honey?” [MASK] mumbled, almost to himself. “He thinks it’s Halloween or something? That’s some coat he’s got.” He munched another tiny cracker.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Kiwi	His arms surprised me with their thinness. Nobody was really eating right, and [MASK] wasn’t wrestling. I would never have guessed that the cessation of our alligator wrestling would make the least difference to him, to his body.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Louis	At first,” she added with the terrible new shyness. “We had an accident. The second day. I lost the bag that had our camp stuff, our food, [MASK]’s old machete, everything went overboard ...
<name>Leo</name>	Leo	Narcissus	Greek guy. [MASK]! Just making puppy eyes down at your face in that bucket.” “Sorry. I was getting a little . . . homesick, I guess. So you’re excited for the end? For the Gulf side of things?”
<name>Blue</name>	Blue	Ava	Something was changing here, speeding up like a heartbeat. “Okay. And when can I meet him?” “My ghost is on the move, [MASK],” she said—as if her ghost were some prowling scoundrel or a moon on the wane.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Louis	The birds had completely swallowed the dredge now. They were perched all along the trusses and gunwales and the cabin roof so that the whole structure looked upholstered in black velvet; it didn’t seem possible to [MASK] that there could be so many birds in all the world.
<name>Dad</name>	Dad	Kiwi	You neither, right? I mean, I bet [MASK] likes it. I think it could be okay to go visit him. Remember when we stayed on the mainland during the hurricane? At the Bowl-a-Bed hotel? That wasn’t so bad.”
<name>Abra</name>	Abra	Ossie	The ghost went moving through her, rolling into her hips, making [MASK] do a jerky puppet dance under her blankets. Get out of here, ghost, I’d think very loudly across the chasm between our two beds. Get back in your grave!
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Kiwi	Carnival Darwinism seemed more impossible than ever before, now that [MASK] understood how the Chief had planned to fund it. Onstage, the Chief was handing the Queen of Beauty a metal crown and a fountain of white carnations. His bum leg stuttered on the carpet.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Ava	“Every time I get afraid he won’t come back, [MASK]. He’s my same age, can you believe that? He’s a teenager. He’s like us.” “Oh boy. I bet we have so much in common.”
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Ossie	And maybe the rag.” “Oh, gee, thanks...” I stared into the crowd of shadows toward the barge’s stern. The buzzards had all vanished from the railings. The hull was rocking slightly. “We should go pretty soon, [MASK].
<name>Blue</name>	Blue	Ossie	Some underworld this turned out to be, [MASK]. I started to think it might not be a terrible thing if the Bird Man found me. A little later I began drafting my apologies to him for leaving. If he had water, I wanted him to find me now.
<name>Ransom</name>	Ransom	Louis	The cook told [MASK] to collect two dozen leathery eggs from these alligator nests, and then he made the whole crew a dinner of fishy-tasting omelettes. When the light expired, they slept. White-tailed deer sprinted like loosed hallucinations between the tree islands.
<name>Werewolf</name>	Werewolf	Blah	He’s been hiding here all this time!” She made claws with her hands and rose onto her toes, pretending to menace me. “[MASK]!” We giggled for too long; then we turned to stare at a padlocked hatch door in the center of the cabin.
<name>Wick</name>	Wick	Osceola	This voice was very primitive. It was some amalgam of the Chief and my mom and a much, much older creature. A dry rasp like a fingernail, a scale. You are both alone out here, you and [MASK], if your sister is alive out here.
<name>Zeke</name>	Zeke	Kiwi	“Wait, they made me pay for this shirt?” [MASK] stared down at his chest, which glowed like a barbecue coal. “Is that hopefully against some law?” This uniform was starchy, ill-fitting. It had a huge puffy flame exploding out of it.
<name>Blue</name>	Blue	Ava	“I just . . . I’m really worried here?” I kept my gaze fixed on the blue quicks of my fingernails. “I think we made a mistake.” “You need to be brave now, [MASK],” the Bird Man told me seriously.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Louis	He’d pushed a thumb through the furry skin and released the kiwi’s subliminal perfume through the tent. The first time [MASK] had done this, he’d watched as the men smiled in their sleep; after that he did it nightly, smiling himself as he imagined pleasant dreams wafting over them.
<name>Libby</name>	Libby	Seth	She’s a [MASK] from my family’s alligator-wrestling park. She has this, ah, this special condition, I don’t think it’s a mutation, exactly, my brother will know . . .”
<name>Mara</name>	Mara	Osceola	Wet mangrove leaves clung to every clothed and unclothed inch of her, even her fingers, even the line of her scalp. Where had she been? In a gator hole? Crawling around a tunnel? [MASK] was smiling, some good dream rippling over her.
<name>Arturo</name>	Arturo	Margaret	“[MASK]!” he’d shout. “Look! I am the referee for a girls’ soccer game in hell!” Forty dollars had been deducted as well, a “processing” fee for his ID badge and locker assignment.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Ossie	place?—but if there were other living people in this underworld I wanted to know if they’d seen [MASK]. And these guys seemed like happy drunks, not ghosts. “No,” the Bird Man said before I could ask. “Better keep your mouth shut.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Everybody	[MASK], all the dredgemen, they survived. At first I didn’t understand the scene in front of me: forty-odd i yards from where I was standing the line of saw grass ended, and I could see beyond it to maple and bay trees and the brown water of an alligator hole.
<name>Arvin</name>	Arvin	Sawtooth	Felt his grandfather’s thick hands around his throat. He saw colors and they were slow and round as bubbles: black as bad purpose. Red as purpose (his fists were flailing now, falling down on [MASK], he could hear the old man cry out in pain).
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ossie	After a possession came a condition called Spellbreak (The Spiritist’s Telegraph, page 206). This was when your ghost left you, the end of your seance experience. [MASK] said the loss of contact with her ghost was absolute.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Kiwi	[MASK] did not run, exactly. “Excuse me . . . ,” he kept saying, pushing past low tables covered in empty pitchers. If anyone follows me I'll pretend to throw up, he thought. With any luck I won’t even have to fake it.
<name>Thalia</name>	Thalia	Osceola	This time when I ate the saw-grass buds I got a bad stomachache. [MASK] was barely talking to me. I’d trot after her toward the Last Ditch until she turned and shouted at me to leave her alone. One time she sprayed insect repellent at me.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ossie	“It’s a secret!” But then I saw, through the open fists of my binoculars, that [MASK]’s pale eyes above her laughing mouth were filling with tears. It was strange to watch a face having that kind of secret disagreement with itself.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ossie?—had	A small bat shot through the door; moonlight pricked at the strings of hanging sleeves. Somebody—who else but [MASK] stolen our mom’s wedding dress. I’d discovered this theft while cleaning out the museum earlier in the day.
<name>Lucifer</name>	Lucifer	Bigtree	“Whadduppp, [MASK]!” Sergio from concessions appeared in one of the labyrinthine hallways, wheeling a trash can behind him. His name tag was coming loose on its pin and the great red moose fans of his devil horns hung around his scrawny neck.
