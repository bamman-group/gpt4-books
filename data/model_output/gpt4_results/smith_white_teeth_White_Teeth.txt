<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Archie	“Now you know better than that. It’s self-service around here, gentlemen. This ain’t the fucking Waldorf.” “I’ll get it,” said [MASK], sliding out of his seat.
<name>Marcus</name>	Marcus	Marcus	To make sense of the world. To eliminate the random.—Magid. And then there was the mutual admiration. That lasted a good few months: What you are working on, [MASK]—these remarkable mice—it is nothing less than revolutionary.
<name>Minerva</name>	Minerva	Marcus	Consequently invitations to [MASK]’s study at the very top of the house, by far her favorite room, had become more frequent. “Well, don’t stand there grinning like the village idiot. Come on up.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Archie	all round?” The doctor opened his mouth as if to say something, but [MASK] shook his head again. “I’ve never done this before and I’m a bit . . . well, pissed, frankly ... I drank quite a bit. . .
<name>Donnie</name>	Donnie	Joyce	“Well, she refuses to meet me, doesn’t she? As if it were some kind of competition.” “Shut the fuck up, [MASK].” “Well, there’s no point, is there? Going into ... it upsets you to ...
<name>Miss Matty</name>	Miss Matty	Hortense	You’ve never gone without food for more than three hours in your life. You’re eighty-five.” “You forget,” said [MASK] with chilling curtness, “I was born in strife. Me a survivor. A little no-food don’ frighten me.”
<name>Maxwell</name>	Maxwell	Magid	“[MASK] is so impressive intellectually for a nine-year-old—everybody says so. I mean, he’s really remarkable. You must be so proud. He’s like a little adult. Even his clothes ...
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Clara	and I’ll get on with it, OK?” [MASK] watched him roll up his sleeves with some determination, and tackle the coffee table once more. “If you really want to be of some help, love, you can start bringing in some of your clothes.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Marcus	There was one on its neck that appeared practically the same size as its ear. But the mouse looked quite pleased about it. Almost as if it had purposefully grown new apparatus to hear what [MASK] was saying about it.
<name>Rez</name>	Rez	Millat	Halfway up platform 12, about to board a train they had no tickets for, a King’s Cross security guy stopped [MASK]’s Crew to ask them a question. “You boys not looking for any trouble, are you?” The question was fair.
<name>James</name>	James	Samad	None of them had seen anyone else but each other for three weeks. “I mean merely that it is likely we have another two years stuck in this thing.” A voice crackled through the radio, and [MASK], not wishing to be seen neglecting his duties, answered it speedily and efficiently.
<name>Grigory</name>	Grigory	Samad	Woken by shouts and whooping laughter, [MASK] struggled into uniform and wrapped one hand around his gun. He stepped into the sun-drenched courtyard to find Russian soldiers in their dun-colored uniforms leapfrogging over each other, shooting tin cans off one
<name>Flintlock</name>	Flintlock	Winterbottom	What we have here is the barrel of the musket belonging to . . . He sat with the phone under his right hand so that in the event of such a scenario he could phone the BBC and demand the said [MASK]’s address and asking price.
<name>Almustafa</name>	Almustafa	Allah	“He learns nothing from a man who knows nothing! Where is his beard? Where is his khamise? Where is his humility? If [MASK] says there will be storm, there will be storm. If he says earthquake, it will be earthquake.
<name>Thornhill</name>	Thornhill	Marcus	Mice and men, genes and germs, that was [MASK]’s corner. Seedlings, light sources, growth, nurture, the buried heart of things— that was hers. As on any missionary vessel, tasks were delegated.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Mo	“I shouted through the car window and told the guy to move on and he says, ‘I am gassing myself, leave me alone.’ Like that.” “No one gasses himself on my property,” [MASK] snapped as he marched downstairs.
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	Shiva	What kind of talk? What happened to respect? What kind of talk is this?” “And you can fuck off too,” said [MASK], brandishing a ladle in his direction, “you old fool. You’re not my father.”
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Irie	“Bloody hell,” said the journo. “Scary shit.” “Yeah, I guess,” said [MASK] vacantly (she had ten more calls to make this morning). “Do you want me to post on some of the photographic material?”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Archie	I’m going to put my gun down here . . . slowly . . . here.” [MASK] crouched and placed it on the ground, roughly between the two of them. “That’s so you can trust me. I’ll stand by my word.
<name>Willy</name>	Willy	Archie	[MASK] reached into his pocket and pulled out five thin pink strips. The boy distributed them snootily among his friends. They began chewing wildly, eyes bursting from their heads with the effort. Then, as the flavor subsided, they stood in silent, awed contemplation of their benefactor.
<name>them</name>	them	KEVIN	Still, he understood that to rely on faith, as his own father did, was contemptible. And no one could say he didn’t give 100 percent to the cause. That seemed enough for [MASK]. They were more than happy with his real forte, which was the delivery of the thing.
<name>Wemmick</name>	Wemmick	Roy	“I just told him to shut it, and he’ll shut it if he knows what’s good for him, the Indian Sultan bastard. No disrespect to you, sir, ’course,” added [MASK], as a polite gesture.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Durham	He still retains enough of his English education to feel slighted when he spots two American soldiers who have docked without permission (all landings must go through [MASK] or his superiors) standing outside their consulate building, insolently chewing their tobacco.
<name>Brer</name>	Brer	Denzel	“Do you think I should meet with my brother?” “Hmm. I don’ tink me can say,” replied [MASK], after a spell of thought in which he laid down a five-domino set.
<name>Fred</name>	Fred	Samad	[MASK] sheepishly recounted the damage so far. “Ah, now you see, that’s not your windows—they’re fine, I put them in—it’s the frames. Just ripped out of that crumbling wall, I’ll bet.”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Irie	“Do you understand, child? I know you understand.” And what he really meant was: do we speak the same language? Are we from the same place? Are we the same? [MASK] squeezed his hand and nodded vigorously, trying to ward off his tears.
<name>he</name>	he	Archie	“I like you,” [MASK] remembered saying help- lessly, as she replaced the gloves and put on her stockings. She turned, smiled. And though she was a professional, he got the feeling she liked him too.
<name>Quisling</name>	Quisling	Coward	The first definition we agree on: my great-grandfather was a mutineer and I am proud to say this. I concede matters did not go quite according to plan. But traitor? [MASK]? The dictionary you show me is old—these definitions are now out of currency.
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Samad	For what is the point, [MASK] would think, pushing aside two mints and a receipt to find fifteen pence, what is the point of tipping a man the same amount you would throw in a fountain to chase a wish?
<name>Boy</name>	Boy	Ryan	“Like a whore!” said [MASK], the word exploding from him like it was a relief to be rid of it. “Like a loose woman!” “Oh bwoy, I heard everyting now . . . take me home, man.”
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Alsi	“I just heard the latest on the radio—ten thousand!” “And the survivors are floating on rooftops while the sharks and crocodiles snap at their heels.” “It must be terrible, [MASK], not knowing, not being sure ...”
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Millat	You have made a war between my sons. You are splitting them apart!” A minute earlier [MASK] had turned the key ever so softly in the front door. Since then he had been standing in the hallway, listening to the conversation and smoking a fag.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Nervous	“Not a Catholic priest.” “Right. Of course. Sorry. [MASK].” The stuffy registrar said, “Shall we get on? We’ve got a lot of you to get through today.” This and little more had constituted the ceremony.
<name>Orleanna</name>	Orleanna	Alsi	parts." Niece-of-Shame, who is sitting between them, sucks her teeth. “Bloody hell, [MASK], he must’ve been involved in your parts sometime, or is this the immaculate bloody conception?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Joshua	“I like what you’ve done with your hair.” “Are you taking the piss?” “No, I like short hair on girls. I like that androgyny thing. Seriously.” “What is your fucking problem?” [MASK] shrugged.
<name>Trillian</name>	Trillian	Joyce	[MASK] took in a little gasp of air. “I think you’re being very cruel. That’s exactly the kind of comment that isn’t helpful.” She stalked over to the breadboard, tearfully cut off a huge lump of cheese, and said, “Look.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Irie	im to tink you some devilish heathen gal? Why kyan you say stamp-collecting or some ting? Come on, I gat to clean deez plates—finish up.” [MASK] looked at the pile of food left on her plate and guiltily tapped her stomach.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Irie	We’ve got history. You’re a real friend. They don’t really mean anything to me.” [MASK] liked to believe that. That they had history, that she was different in a good way. “Thy black is fairest in my judgement’s place ...”
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Muhammed	[MASK] looked up from his pot-scrubbing and shook his head again and again. To no one in particular he said, “These young people—what kind of talk? What kind of talk? What happened to respect? What kind of talk is this?”
<name>Imelda</name>	Imelda	Irie	[MASK], ignorant of all this, turned up for her appointment three-thirty on the dot, intent upon transformation, intent upon fighting her genes, a headscarf disguising the bird’s nest of her hair, her right hand carefully placed upon her stomach.
<name>Esme</name>	Esme	Hortense	[MASK] set the plastic carnations straight on her hat and stabbed them fiercely, then brought the pin back up through the felt, leaving two inches of exposed silver sticking up from the hat like a German pickelhaube. “Well, don’ look so shock.
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Millat	Since then he had been standing in the hallway, listening to the conversation and smoking a fag. It was great! It was like listening to two big Italian matriarchs from opposing clans battle it out. [MASK] loved clans.
<name>Stanhope</name>	Stanhope	Marcus	In the outside world, outside of his college and home, one had to add things to speech. Particularly if one was somewhat strange-looking, as [MASK] gathered he was; if one was a little old, with eccentric curly hair and spectacles missing their lower rims.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Alsana	screamed [MASK], the smile leaving her face, falling to her knees in front of the television, tracing her finger past the burning book to the face she recognized, smiling up at her through light tubes, her pixilated second son beneath her picture-framed first.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Millat	So. How are things?” [MASK] sat down at the table with violence and eyes that looked like they had recently seen tears. He pulled out his pouch of tobacco and litde bag of weed. “Fuckin’ awful.”
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Irie	Because homeland is one of the magical fantasy words like unicorn and soul and infinity that have now passed into the language. And the particular magic of homeland, its particular spell over [MASK], was that it sounded like a beginning. The beginningest of beginnings.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Millat	That’s three. Don’t worry, I’ll let myself out.” This was the kind of thing [MASK] did so expertly. The door slammed. The nice girls looked at each other in that way. (He’s just so out of control, so crazy ...
<name>McGonagall</name>	McGonagall	Joyce	Nurture, thought [MASK]. Be patient, water regularly, and don’t lose your temper when pruning. “. . . and your headmaster explained to us how your own home environments aren’t exactly . . . well. . .
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Ardashir	I have the deposit for the house, it is our house now, we have moved in—” How on earth has he afforded it, he must work his wife like a bloody slave, thought [MASK], pulling out another paper clip from the bottom drawer.
<name>Mo</name>	Mo	Sophie	The orchestra, unaware that this is what they had been doing, but aware that this was the most heinous crime in the Manor School rule book, looked to their collective feet. “Do you? Do you? How would you like it, [MASK], if someone made fun of Queen?”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Clara	I fail to see how some electric tape will change the fact there is a half a tree in the kitchen.” “Man, I’m terrified,” stuttered [MASK], after a few minutes’ silence, as the storm lulled. “The quiet is always a bad sign.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Alsana	and not so much as a photograph.” [MASK] makes an unpleasant noise at the back of her throat, her signal for disbelief. “So look at it—no, dearie, it must be done—look at it close up. Look at what is left.
<name>Enoch</name>	Enoch	Archie	[MASK] dragged his head off the steering wheel. And in the moment between focusing on the sweaty bulk of a brown-skinned Elvis and realizing that life was still his, he had a kind of epiphany. It occurred to him that, for the first time since his birth.
<name>Blankenship</name>	Blankenship	Archie	If I may say so . . .” The doctor’s mouth hung open, waiting for [MASK] to insert a name but none came. “Lieutenant ... if I may say so, Lieutenant, it appears to me you are in something of a . . .
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Jocelyn	Have them out early, that’s what I tell my granddaughter [MASK] in regard to her sons. You simply must. You can’t fight against it. I wish I had. I wish I’d given up early and hedged my bets, as it were.
<name>Rushdie</name>	Rushdie	Millat	In the language of the street [MASK] was a rudeboy, a badman, at the forefront, changing image as often as shoes; sweet-as, safe, wicked, leading kids up hills to play football, downhill to rifle fruit machines, out of schools, into video shops.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Joyce	“Can I ask? Your father? What does he—?” ([MASK] wondered what the parents did, what they had done. When she found a mutated first bloom, she wanted to know where the cutting had come from. Wrong question.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Samad	Maybe all.” [MASK] scowled at his wife and continued, “And here, here where he talks about his nose: ‘It seems to me that a vase should not be in such a silly place where it can fall and break a boy’s nose.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Samad	[MASK] was in his television mode: garish V-neck, stomach swelling like a tight hot-water bottle beneath it, long moth-eaten dressing gown, and a pair of paisley boxer shorts from which two stick legs, the legacy of his youth, protruded.
<name>Reggie</name>	Reggie	Archie	Once upon a time he had been a track cyclist. What [MASK] liked about track cycling was the way you went round and round. Round and round. Giving you chance after chance to get a bit better at it, to make a faster lap, to do it right.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Archie	“All right, all right,” said the butcher, freeing himself from [MASK]’s fingers and brushing himself clean, “move along now. I’ve got meat coming. I’m in the business of bleeding. Not counseling.
<name>her</name>	her	Karina	Which was weird. He usually showed [MASK] everything. Now just her asking him grated somehow. And what was she wearing? Same top she always wore. Except wasn’t it shorter? Weren’t the nipples clearer, more deliberate? He said, “Nothing.”
<name>Henrietta</name>	Henrietta	Irie	Genetic result: the same. You see? And it’s only with transgenic mice, by adding experimentally to the genome, that you can understand those kind of differences. And this mouse, the one you’re looking at, is a unique mouse, [MASK].
<name>Chango</name>	Chango	Millat	All women, of every shade, from midnight-black to albino, were [MASK]’s. They slipped him phone numbers, they gave him blow jobs in public places, they crossed crowded bars to buy him a drink, they pulled him into taxis, they followed him home.
<name>Quiller</name>	Quiller	Archie	Man makes himself, after all. And he is responsible for what he makes.” “There you are, then. End of conversation.” [MASK] placed his legs apart, spread his weight, ready to take the kick-back—and cocked the gun once more.
<name>Trish</name>	Trish	Neena	She acted so sensible, so straight-down-the-line in her long sensible coat, but you got the feeling . . . “Oi! Miss! There’s shoes back here that need your attention,” came a voice from the storeroom. “Keep your tits on,” said [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Irie	He looks like he’s pulling faces a lot of the time. You forget how alert-looking mice are. Terrible trouble to look after, of course. That’s why he never got one for [MASK] when she was small.
<name>Lord</name>	Lord	Lord	On her first day at the school her mother had explained to her she was about to enter the devil’s lair, filled her satchel with two hundred copies of the Watchtower, and instructed her to go and do the [MASK]’s work.
<name>Briony</name>	Briony	Marvin	He was thinking like a Christian again; he was saying Can’t say fairer than that to the Creator. “Instruments down. Yes, you, [MASK]. Thank you very much.” “What’ll we be doin’ instead, then, miss?”
<name>England</name>	England	Joyce	It was quite therapeutic, switching [MASK] off. This was not entirely personal. It just seemed tiring and unnecessary all of a sudden, that struggle to force something out of the recalcitrant English soil. Why bother when there was now this other place?
<name>Millat</name>	Millat	Zinat	I want my Alsana well provided for after my death—but!” he said, waggling a finger at his sparkling, jewel-covered interrogator, who wore too much eyeshadow, “I don’t want her to know! Thoughts of death are abhorrent to her, [MASK].”
<name>Yvonne</name>	Yvonne	Magid	I don’t want you participating in that nonsense. It has nothing to do with us, [MASK]. Why are you always trying to be somebody you are not?” There was a mutual, silent anger as each acknowledged the painful incident that was being referred to.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Joshua	I smoked it without really thinking, then I gave it to [MASK] to hold for a second while I tied my shoelace, but he really had nothing to do with it. OK? Can we go now?” “Yes, I did!”
<name>Gibran</name>	Gibran	Rodwell	It is not a rock concert. At least with [MASK] there is some attempt to capture the poetry, the remarkable nature of the Arabic: And should they see a fragment of the heaven falling down, they would say, ‘It is only a dense cloud.’
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Archibald	December 28,1992 My dearest [MASK], ’Tis the season to be jolly ... so it has been claimed, but from my window I see only turmoil. At present six felines, hungry for territory, are warring in my garden.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Marcus	This was a new experience for [MASK]. Meeting one of his readers. Meeting one of his readers in the waiting lounge of an airport. He had been a writer of academic texts all his life, texts whose audience was tiny and select, whose members he more often than not knew personally.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Irie	Outside the woman put her hairpins in her pocket. She looked exhausted. “I hate that place,” she said. “But I need hairpins.” “I need hair,” said [MASK]. The woman shook her head.
<name>Mangal</name>	Mangal	Pande	I never thought where it came from . . . [MASK] was the rebel, didn’t like the English, shot the first bullet of the Mutiny. I remember it now, clear as a bell. And that was your grandfather!” “ Great- grandfather.”
<name>Finch</name>	Finch	Mickey	“No, no. My .great-grandfather is not up for discussion today. We have other business.” “Well, thank fuck. Repetitive syndrome is what it is.” [MASK] patted his book, affectionately. “’Sail in ’ere, mate.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Archie	House is torn to shit.” “Ditto. It’s been madness around here too.” “I’d like to know where you’d be without me, young lady,” said [MASK], banging another nail into some plywood.
<name>Meera</name>	Meera	Neena	Now, enough of the philosophy: samosa?” She peels the lid off the plastic tub and sits fat, pretty, and satisfied on her conclusion. “Shame that you’re having them,” says [MASK] to her aunt, fighting a fag.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Millat	It is a great project.” “It is an abomination” (leaflet: The Sanctity of Creation). [MASK] pulls out a chair from one of the desks and sits on it backward, like a crab in a trap, legs and arms splayed either side.
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Archie	you said that I might plead . . . ?” Keeping his hands behind his head, the doctor made a move to get on his knees, but [MASK] shook his head and groaned. “I know what I said . . . but there’s no . . .
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Mickey	For that reason alone he has been the guiding spirit, if you like, behind the research group, and is, as ever, my mentor, a position he has filled for twenty years now . . .” “You know who my mentor is?” says [MASK].
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Archie	These pigeons had an instinct for the Unlucky, and so they passed [MASK] by. For, though he did not know it, and despite the Hoover tube that lay on the passenger seat pumping from the exhaust pipe into his lungs, luck was with him that morning.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Samad	Same sort of ball-park, then.” “Just about the same stadium, yes.” There was a bit of a difficult pause, in which [MASK] saw clearly that he wanted her more than any woman he had met in the past ten years.
<name>Ruma</name>	Ruma	Samad	[MASK] noticed too that a gurgling sound was emanating from the pleasant fat that vibrated in the gap of her sari; she waved her hands at him and then put them over her ears. “Is this really necessary?”
<name>Barry</name>	Barry	Millat	Was he the one who was supplying the gear?” “No,” said [MASK], stubbing his fag out on the windowsill. “It was my gear. He was talking to me, and I was smoking it.”
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Alsana	The relevant passages have been photocopied for me.” “Will someone remind my husband,” said [MASK], speaking to the newsreader, “that he does not even know what the bloody book is about because the last thing he read was the bloody A—Z.”
<name>Artie</name>	Artie	Archibald	Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil. Dat my motto.” “He was the tickle in the sneeze, [MASK]. It is as simple as that. I do believe that.” There was quiet for a minute.
<name>Yaxley</name>	Yaxley	Archie	It cannot be found in books.” “Oi-oi,” said [MASK], trying to diffuse a row. “You do know Last of the Summer Wine’s on in ten minutes? BBC Two.”
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Archie	She patted her pitted pink thighs encased in their white tights. “Oh, [MASK], love, I shouldn't. Goes straight on the legs and hips, don’t it? An’ neither of us is getting any younger, are we, eh?
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Irie	Durham from his perch on [MASK]’s windowsill, and she carefully reerected him. “Yeah, nice to see you too, man. Why don’t you sit down and slow down. Sick of what?” “Them. They sicken me.
<name>Trillian</name>	Trillian	Irie	“What now?” [MASK] looked down to where the pain was. In any war, this was too low a blow. The front set of some false teeth, with no mouth attached to it, was bearing down upon her right foot. “Fucking hell!
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Irie	“Yes,” said [MASK], as he stood there sheepish. “I’m looking at you.” Quickly and quietly she explained to him about the neutral place, about the room, about the date, about the time.
<name>Lucifer</name>	Lucifer	Magid	He just taketh the fuck away. [MASK] was proud to say he witnessed every stage. He witnessed the custom design of the genes. He witnessed the germ injection. He witnessed the artificial insemination. And he witnessed the birth, so different from his own.
<name>Spider</name>	Spider	Merlin	“Hundred percent, bona fide blessing.” “Did you, er, dig the sign, then?” asked [MASK], taking a step back behind the doorstep in case the man was violent as well as schiz. “You into that kind of scene?
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Samad	Alibi done, three minutes were left for [MASK] to consider what an old man brings a young girl; something an old brown man brings a young white girl at the crossroads of four black streets; something suitable . . . “A coconut?”
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Samad	Sun,” he said, squinting. “Hurts my little peepers. It was nice to have met you.” “Yes, indeed,” said the Russian, following [MASK] with his eyes until he had disappeared into the recesses of the church.
<name>Rastas</name>	Rastas	Blessed	“Him was never my objection as such. He always been a level-headed sort a fellow. [MASK] are de peacekeepers. He always strike me as a peacekeeper. But it more de principle of de ting, you know? Black and white never come to no good.
