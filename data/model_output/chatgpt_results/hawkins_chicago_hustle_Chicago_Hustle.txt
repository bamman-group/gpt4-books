<name>Mr. Thompson</name>	Mr. Thompson	Simon	Five minutes to twelve. This was the part he hated most of all. No matter how soon you finished up, you still had to drop your keys off in [MASK]’s office and wait until he dismissed you, at exactly twelve o’clock.
<name>Marcello</name>	Marcello	Elijah	“A lot of them belonged to my husband.” “Your husband?” Now we gettin’ somewhere. “I was married, once upon a time.” [MASK] sat comfortably close to light her cigarette and his, a question mark in both eyes.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Benny	why don’t you pick me up in the momin’?” [MASK] shrugged behind the wheel. “That’s cool with me, what time?” “I go to work at eight,” she answered promptly. “I hear ya, baby ...
<name>George</name>	George	Elijah	“Crawl up on top of each other, don’t stand up!” The last four men crawled in over the backs of the others, mad, disgusted. When the last man had crawled in, [MASK] stuffed a nearby chair under the knob.
<name>Werner</name>	Werner	Benny	In order not to make their stuff look hidden, arousing someone’s suspicions maybe, before they could get back to it, they crushed the wrapped-up shotgun and [MASK]’s luger into a jumbled heap on the sofa, along with a pile of other rags, and eased up the stairs to the party.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Dig	you scared me, man ... I thought...” “Yeah, I know. [MASK], I thought I’d hip you to the fact that most of the people here know that the gamblin’ joint down the street’s been ripped off” ...
<name>Bull</name>	Bull	Zelma	Never could tell, not with a bitch that looked strong as [MASK], and it would be terrible to get your ass kicked on the street . . . even if it was by a bulldagger ... like, well, after all, she was still a woman.
<name>Art</name>	Art	Browney	“I got in touch with [MASK] and he said he wouldn’t be able to handle it ’til Monday. Unless ... hahhahhah ... you wanted to do a credit thing with him.” “Credit?! Credit what?!”
<name>Spider</name>	Spider	Benny	Once again, he felt like fainting when he realized that they had not searched anyone, and that every one of the dudes crawling into the toilet might have a piece on him. “Search ’em before they crawl in, man!” he called out to [MASK].
<name>He</name>	He	Elijah	The mingling of perfumes, perspiration, the smoke, music and the flickering light pushed them closer together, established a moment. [MASK] slid his hand down to her lower back, testing. She protested by nibbling on his right earlobe. The music played on.
<name>Jude</name>	Jude	Elijah	They stood, swaying in each other’s arms,locked up. “No, baby . . . this is no game. I’m fo’ real,” [MASK] mumbled into her ear and squeezed a little more gently.
<name>Waldo</name>	Waldo	Ramona	Once, twice, three times. Yeahhh, uhh huh. I’m for real, they seemed to say. He looked around coolly, cautiously. Where is [MASK]? What the hell, he decided, I shouldn’t even be here with her square ass anyway.
<name>Maude</name>	Maude	Chink	“I’m expensive, how about a drink?” “Mix me somethin’ strange ’n wonderful.” “How *bout a Haitian voodoo?” “That sounds groovy. [MASK] been through?” She checked her watch as though she were timing something.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Benny	I guess.” [MASK] fumbled with the keys trying to open the car door. “Where we goin’?” he asked slyly, as they positioned themselves in the car . . . single man driving, the couple being chauffeured.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Elijah	What am I gon’ do with you?!” He began to struggle out of his pants. “I already got one thing in mind.” She stood up and began to disrobe. [MASK] smiled and thought to himself .. . doubleheaders can wear you out.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Toni	[MASK] studied his reactions carefully. “Look!” he finally burst out. “You say that to say what!? awright! awright! take me off into you li’l ol* thang if you want to.
<name>Old Man</name>	Old Man	Elijah	Heyyyy, that’s kinda steep for my pocket,” the short one announced and looked up to his tall buddy. [MASK], feeling the hook slip, quickly rebaited it. “Hell! who am I to quibble ’round with a couple groovy young soldiers.
<name>Foxy</name>	Foxy	Toni	Parking on the side street, hearing much less noise than usual, made him feel uneasy, vaguely apprehensive. He got out of his car, probing the possibilities of what life would be like with [MASK]. She’s really a sho’ ’nuff dynamite sister.
<name>Stanley</name>	Stanley	Toe	She reappeared from one of the other rooms, billowing in in a see-through caftan, her reddish-black hair streaming down behind. Was she an Arab? No wonder [MASK] was sitting up in blood-red polka-dot drawers and undershirt.
<name>Duke</name>	Duke	Elijah	[MASK] felt like running back across the lobby and thumpin’ the old dude’s ass, but for what? and besides it would be a total waste of good cocaine feeling. He stood in front of the elevator, steaming. Talk about bad vibes . . .
<name>Dillinger</name>	Dillinger	Elijah	[MASK] held his hands behind him for the cold manacles, dumped back into the seat after they were shackled on. Well, at least I’ll be able to get a good lawyer with the dough from the holdup.
<name>Tony</name>	Tony	Elijah	“Don’t mention it. Just make sure you don’t miss any payments, I got a couple guys over here who don’t do anything but leg work for me.” [MASK] hung up the telephone coolly, cursing the voice, the man and everything he represented.
<name>Margo</name>	Margo	Clotille	He stepped into the carpeted elevator, feeling good about having figured it all out, and kept his cool. [MASK] leaned against the wall outside her apartment, a drink in one hand, a joint in the other hand, half high and half drunk.
<name>Red</name>	Red	Elijah	And then divided the price of the grass between them, and the “commission.” Twelve dollars and fifty cents apiece. [MASK] smiled indulgently and looked off into the distance as they surreptitiously placed the money in his hand. “It’s really good, huh?”
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Brookes	“You know, you ain’t such a bad guy as you pretend to be, [MASK] ... if you would go ’head ’n do your work when you was supposed to, and do as good a job as you can, you wouldn’t have no trouble outta me.
<name>Maude</name>	Maude	Elijah	She laid an expansive gesture on him. “That’s your job, isn’t it?” The fox fur was joined by a pair of rhinestone spectacles in dumpy slacks and two-toned platform shoes. [MASK] slid through his speech in a dry monotone, feeling vaguely trapped.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Elijah	“Well, it’s all safe for a while, I guess,” [MASK] whispered, mad and disgusted, “unless they decide to push every goddamned thing off the sofa.” “Nawww, they won’t do that, be more likely that they would be layin’ up on stuff.”
<name>Myrtle</name>	Myrtle	Elijah	Can you make it? We can sit off in a corner somewhere and rap.” [MASK] gave the card an elaborately shaped kiss. “I’ll be there with bells on.” “Beautiful! see you,” she sang out and glided away.
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Leelah	“I ain’t sayin’ that to say nothin’. I just don’t want that bitch laughin’ ’n grinnin’ in my face.” He made a spontaneous decision to defuse the situation. “Awww goddamn! [MASK]! pull your ass off your shoulder!
<name>Tony</name>	Tony	Elijah	[MASK] settled himself down on the side of the bed, the beers, gin ’n tonics, the heavy smoke and now, looking forward to the cocaine,he felt relaxed. Not to mention the release of tension he felt because his woman was back.
<name>George</name>	George	Elijah	“Be rally great to get out of the country for a while, won’t it, fella?” “Huh?” [MASK] responded, tom out of his dream-thought. “I said ...” the voice started to repeat. “Oh yeah, really!”
<name>Keisha</name>	Keisha	Elijah	“[MASK], don’t you ever get tired of playin’ games?” The comers of his mouth sagged. Don’t tell me that you gon’ take me through your li’l oF thang again. I thought we had finished with all that.
<name>man</name>	man	Leo	I done dropped three o’ those bullets I . .. uhhh ... copped from you yes-ta-day and I don’t feel. Git no kinda feelin’ at all. I don’t feel shhhiiit!” “You a motherfuckin’ lie, [MASK]!
<name>him</name>	him	Elijah	“How much I owe you, doll?” The bartender lady moved quickly to the space in front of [MASK], doing abacus calcu- lations as he moved. Wonder if I could pad it for a dollar ’n a quarter? he looks fucked up.
<name>Tony</name>	Tony	Elijah	“How much, man?” the luger man cut in. “Well, I can give you a couple bills now . . . and then, when my ... uhhh ... deal comes through ...” “Fuck the con, [MASK], we want the dough.”
<name>you</name>	you	Nick’ll	Maybe [MASK] have some. He popped up at his stop, pleased to see the early birds, the fifteen minute to five guys, rushing onto the El, anxious to get back to their necks of the woods. Yeahhh, the more the merrier.
<name>Elmore</name>	Elmore	Browney	Money, honey. I need some clothes and a decent ride.” [MASK] shifted his bulk around in his chair and swung his heels up onto his desk, searching in his desk drawer for a pack of cigarettes. “Damn it!” “Huh?!”
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Browney	“I ain’t got a goddamned thing, man ... that’s why I’m callin’ you.” [MASK]’s caution skipped from there to outright coldness, now that the reading had been made. “Uhh, what can I do for you?”
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Elijah	“You really know how to turn folks on and off, don’t you?” “I’m in no position to take chances with strays,” she spoke in the same quiet voice. [MASK] bristled up slightly, the cocaine feeding him little jolts of ego.
<name>Elijah</name>	Elijah	Elijah	She moved to the closet with her usual quick, precise movements, pulled a shoebox out and handed it to [MASK]. “’Lijah, you still didn’t answer my question.” “What question was that, baby?” he asked, smiling up at her innocently.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Momma	He reviewed possible methods of attack. Can’t drive on her. I tried that. He straightened up slowly. “[MASK]’s on her bad days.” I’ll bet she was connin’ me. Yeahhh, I’ll bet she was connin’ me.
<name>Tyrion</name>	Tyrion	Leelah	[MASK], stroking his neck and back, whispered into his ear, “How could I ever leave a motherfucker as rotten as you?” He found himself, smiling over her shoulder despite the gentle insult, pushed her back onto the bed and stood up to take off the rest of his garments.
<name>Annabelle</name>	Annabelle	Leelah	He stood looking down at [MASK] on the bed, her royal blue robe slit open to the thigh, not sure of whether he wanted to strangle her or jump on top of her and start humping like a love-crazed Congolese gorilla.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Browney	“[MASK], your friend, sent us over to remind you that you owe him, as of today, exactly one thousand, two hundred bucks and ten cents interest, phis two hundred bucks. You wanna pay all or part of it now?”
<name>Benny</name>	Benny	Mabel	At some point during the night, while I was feelin’ on [MASK]’s ass, he went down and cleaned up, got all the dough and stashed the pieces somewhere else. Sneaky, rat-faced son of a bitch! yeahhhh,he would do something like that.
<name>Chinaski</name>	Chinaski	Elijah	[MASK] sprawled out in his favorite easy chair, music on his box, a stick of high-grade grass in the corner of his mouth, slowly roving his eyes around his new apartment. Furnished with all the necessities, ultra delooxe, two hundred and seventy-five a month.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Mabel	He shut off the water to listen to [MASK]’s laughter. She really is a sho’ ’nuff, down to earth, stone soul to the bone, bitch. She was still laughing, sprawled across her bed, when he popped out of the bathroom, a towel saronged around his waist.
<name>Bigger</name>	Bigger	Elijah	As the heavy door slowly resettled itself, [MASK] spoke quickly. “If it wasn’t for Unca’ Tom ass dudes like you, niggers wouldn’t be havin’ such a tough time tryin’ to get over today!” The doorman hurriedly reopened the door and shouted across the expensively carpeted lobby.
<name>Bumpy</name>	Bumpy	Elijah	“Get in, blood ... let’s cut up a few minutes.” [MASK] straightened his back. “I’m in a hurry, that is, less y’all makin’ me get in?” The two detectives exchanged snide looks.
<name>He</name>	He	Toe	He flipped his attache case open and slid the contract inside. Women were so fuckin’ gullible when they wanted to be, it seemed. Here’s a chick working hard all day who’d sign her fuckin’ life away, maybe ... and not even suspect it. [MASK] was right.
<name>Leelah</name>	Leelah	Elijah	She counted the money out into [MASK]’s outstretched hand. “Goddamn, Leelah baby! I thought you said we cleared six bills!” She glared at him fiercely. “Don’t I get none of it?
<name>Zeke</name>	Zeke	Elijah	You gave me that and I’m grateful ... but now it’s time for me to get down with my very own thang.” “Yeah, I hear ya, biuh ... I hear ya, whatchu got in mind?” [MASK] looked around the room, collecting himself.
<name>Imogene</name>	Imogene	Phil	He stared at her. Five feet, two inches tall, coffee ’n cream colored, one hundred and fifteen delicious pounds, unmarried, under twenty-four years old and square as a brick. “[MASK]?”
<name>He</name>	He	Mable	He ignored the curious stares of the two women waiting to get into the toilet. No time for any off-brand bullshit. [MASK] stared at the backs of the two men, making their way, super-casually, it seemed at first glance, back to the kitchen.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Elijah	[MASK] slumped a little lower on the bench, tired of the sounds of the eternal discussions, debates, that started from the time they were clanged awake ’til the time they were told, “Lights out, beddy bye!”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Browney	peanuts! and now you gon’ try to tell me you can’t stake me for ... ?” “Now just a minute!” [MASK] interrupted abruptly, 4chold on there a minute! then was then and now is now. Deals made yesterday are old deals.
<name>no proper name fits here</name>	no proper name fits here	Simon	he screamed when he was certain that [MASK] was halfway to the next floor. “Niggggerrrr!” He rolled the word off his tongue as he readied for the buffer handle. “Nigggerrrrr,” he rolled out again, praying inside that
<name>Stoner</name>	Stoner	Elijah	“What’s that supposed to mean?” [MASK] retrieved the joint from the ashtray and took a couple deep hits before answering. “Heyyyy, what do I look like to you? Some new kind o’ fool!?
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Simon	[MASK] growled out over his shoulder as he walked under the exit sign, heading for the seventeenth floor. The throbbing in the back of his head and the rage he felt at being treated like a child clashed inside his brain, made him feel helpless.
<name>Raymond</name>	Raymond	Benny	with them on they bellies, with they asses heisted up in the air. Just think man! For five grand or more! My man told me he had blown three bills himself before he cut out.” “Five grand, huh?” [MASK] nodded affirmatively, emphatically.
<name>his</name>	his	Elijah	Yeah, why not? nothing else to do ’til two p jn. tomorrow. “Yeah, baby ... gon’ do it again.” The bartender lady refilled [MASK]’s glass, looking up as quickly as he did when two neighborhood regulars popped in.
<name>Bledsoe</name>	Bledsoe	Elijah	[MASK] strolled toward the exit, frowning. Asshole! He was worse than one of those ol’ time cotton field strawbosses, the kind the Great White Father used to have keeping all the rest of the hands in line.
<name>Two-Bit</name>	Two-Bit	Benny	“Looka here, dog nuts ... the next time you get ready to go stick somebody up, be sure ’n come get me, okay?” [MASK] hung his head a little. “Awwww,well, you know how it goes sometimes, man.”
<name>Mrs. Hopewell</name>	Mrs. Hopewell	Elijah	[MASK] looked at him as though he were speaking a lost language. “How much?” He finally worked the question out. “One thousand, two hundred and ten cents plus two hundred. Which comes to one thousand, four hundred ’n ten cents.
<name>Uncle Remus</name>	Uncle Remus	Monkeydude	His curled-down lips altered to form the essence of a smile as the light changed from red to green and back to red again while they stared. No, it wasn’t [MASK]’s story tellin’.hoppin’around, diggin’ in his ass and laughin’ at his own lies that held them His smile flared slightly.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Elijah	[MASK] pursed his Ups, carefully reviewing the dangers connected to robbing a crap game. It was a little bit like winner take all. The loser would have nothing, and there was nothing that they could legally do about it.
<name>'Lijah</name>	'Lijah	Elijah	“Yeah, you goin’? Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do,” his partner added. [MASK] smiled indulgently at both of them and kept on steppin’. “Psssst! pssssst! ’Lijah! over here, man!”
<name>Marilyn</name>	Marilyn	Momma	“Awwww, did [MASK] give you a bad time, baby? here, let me kiss the bad vibes away.” She reached out for both sides of his face with her long-nailed fingers and spooled a half yard of lascivious tongue into his mouth.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Sid	The two men sat next to each other for a full minute, sipping their drinks, unhurried by life, into games and scenes, fraternity brothers. “Couple dagos was through here a lil while ago, askin’ *bout you,” [MASK] opened up casually.
<name>He</name>	He	Elijah	he whispered near her ear. She gazed up at him from her seat on the bricks, a nice even expression in her eyes. “Fine and you?” she answered in a low, private voice. [MASK] shrugged expressively. What could you say?
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Home	“And to top it off,” [MASK] swept grandly from one section of his spiiit life to another, “would you b’lieve this chick comes to the door after I done sat out front on the steps, drinkin’ moonshine ’n cryin’ ...
<name>Easy</name>	Easy	June	“[MASK] broke in on some cold-blooded dudes with no bullets in his piece. One of the dudes called his bluff, took his piece, what little money he had, stuffed boot in his ass and pushed him back out on the streets with nothin’ but his socks ’n shorts on . . .
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Lijah	She smiled indulgently at his blustering behavior and sucked on the joint again before answering. “Awwww, you know I sold that shit, ’[MASK]. You don’t have to stand there wolfin’ at me. I ain’t scared o’ you, and you know it.”
<name>Raymond</name>	Raymond	Wimpy	I got word in the joint that [MASK] had gotten hisself together, got somebody to write him up a proposal, sent it to some government office and would up with twenty-five grand to set up an anti-drug rehab program ... twenty-five grand!”
<name>Snake</name>	Snake	Browney	Automatically he dialed into their code . . . three rings. hang up ... two lings, hang up, and then let it ring. If there was anybody who would help him get his shit back together again, it would be old cold-blooded ass [MASK].
<name>Bigger</name>	Bigger	Elijah	The three men, into their neighborhood in a way that the white men could never be, faded away into familiar passageways, disappearing for the period of time it would take the squad car to find something else to do. [MASK] tried to ease his squatting position into something more comfortable.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Sid	[MASK] grimaced behind a swallow of his drink and signalled silently for the bartender to give him a glass of water. “Nawww, not really, I know their types though. You got a bad scene goin’ on somewhere?”
<name>Mr. Harvey</name>	Mr. Harvey	Elijah	[MASK] carefully placed his cup and saucer on the tray before going on. “What we’re asking you, and nine other depositors, to do is this ...” The telephone ringing caused him to clench his back teeth together.
<name>Jackie</name>	Jackie	Elijah	[MASK] allowed himself a self-indulgent chuckle before settling back to the business at hand. A gambling house robbery could be a super tricky proposition if it wasn’t handled right. “Uhh, lemme check the piece that I’m gon’ use out.”
<name>She</name>	She	Elijah	“Don’t say a word about,..” She nodded in agreement, picking up the telephone. “Hello ... yes, I thought it would be you, dear ... yes ...” [MASK] groaned inwardly. Was it going well? badly? was it going at all?
<name>Shug</name>	Shug	Beautiful	Ain’t this somethin’ ... a sister talkin’ ’bout she’s “en- gaged.” Why didn’t she just come on out and say she ’n some dude is fuckin’ regular. Lawwwd, I swear! my people! “[MASK]! that’s fine!
<name>man</name>	man	Murph	“Looka here, [MASK], both of you dudes are righteous brothers. Lemme slide and I’ll make it worth your while. I promise on my momma’s grave, even if I have to send it back by carrier pigeon.”
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Benny	He paid for the dinner and stepped away with a grin on his face, liking the down home flavor of the place, the music coming from the front, the food and the woman serving it. “How is it, man?” [MASK] asked, pointing at the food with his nose.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Elijah	“How long you and that broad been into it?” [MASK] followed the woman’s body passing by with an expert’s interest. Forty-two, three, on her last legs but still tryin’ to look good.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Elijah	[MASK] frowned at the late middle-aged black man, turning him off. He had enough to think about, the last thing he needed was the clammy friendship of a dumb sap doing bad time on an alimony beef.
<name>Opie</name>	Opie	Bennie	“Last time I saw [MASK], a couple brothers was spreadin’ some o’ his shit on they dicks;” “Really?! that’s too bad.” “Yeah, well, you know how it is, if you can’t hold your mug.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Elijah	The foreman of the building’s custodians, a large, grim-faced black dude who always seemed to be prowling around, trying to catch someone doing something they shouldn’t be doing, glared down into [MASK]’s face.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Elijah	“But, [MASK],” die started off, knowing that he would never give her a chance to cany on, now that he was tuned up. “Naw! naw! lissen t’ me, baby ...
<name>the cops</name>	the cops	Leelah	He swept his eyes around in a sneaky review of the streets. Be just my fuckin’ luck for [MASK] to catch me out here with this bitch hangin’ onto my arm. "I thought you had better sense than to be lettin’ people tell you what to think.
<name>Herbert</name>	Herbert	Leelah	Downstairs, on the street, he paused in front of his apartment building, looking up one side of the street and down the other, both fists on his narrow hips, wishing that he could spot [MASK] somewhere.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Leelah	The last thing I need is some square bitch bullshit about V011 was ’sposed to call at noontime!’ ” [MASK] withdrew her bottom lip slightly, her bluff called. “Well, you said you was! I didn’t ask you to.”
<name>Pony</name>	Pony	Elijah	We just wanted to rap with you for a bit. No hard feelin’s, huh?” [MASK] tried, but couldn’t prevent himself from scowling. “Would it matter if I had hard feelin’s?”
<name>W.C. Fields</name>	W.C. Fields	Elijah	can’t cheat an honest man.” [MASK] carefully recounted the money on the dining room table, keeping his voice to a steady monotone as he came to the final figure again. Two thousand, five hundred dollars.
<name>Bubba</name>	Bubba	Murphy	You acted like you was gon’ chew my nuts off back there in the joint.” [MASK] smiled across the distance between them maliciously. “I’ve told you two or three times, brotherman. Stop tryin’ to be cute with me.
<name>Pablo</name>	Pablo	Benny	“What kinda heat you got?” [MASK]’s eyes glittered a little in the shadows as he recited the pieces in his armory. “Sawed-off shotgun, two .45s and a luger.” “How much did you say was in the game?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Elijah	Might not remember whether or not his partner had a double or a single ... “That’ll... be ten dollars even.” [MASK] gave her a nasty, sneering smile and announced in a loud, loud voice, “My tab is eight dollars and seventy-five cents.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Murphy	“You better put the cuffs on him, I feel some bad vibes startin’ to creep up.” [MASK] backhanded him in the mouth. “You wasn’t thinkin’ about doin’ anything nasty, was you?”
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Elijah	“What made you think a thing like that?” [MASK] snuffed up one line and down the other, his actions precise and well-ordered. “Well, when I was worried about you today, lookin’ everywhere ...
<name>Tyrone</name>	Tyrone	Elijah	[MASK] slumped down on the wooden bench, feeling gritty under the arms from not washing, a strong crotch funk floating up to his nostrils. Nine months in the county jail. He turned his attention back to his fellow inmates, avoiding the seductive looks of a couple drag queens . . .
<name>Bessie</name>	Bessie	Precious	you were cut out for it, and believe me, I wouldn’t say that to one nigger in a thousand ... 'course, I have to admit that ho’s ain’t quite what they used to be .. “Too much strain 'n pain, [MASK].
