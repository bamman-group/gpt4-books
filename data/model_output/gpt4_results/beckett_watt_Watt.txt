<name>Tristram</name>	Tristram	Watt	So he took it from its hook and held it before his eyes, at arm’s length, upside down, and on its right side, and on its left side. But in these positions the picture pleased [MASK] less than it had when on the wall.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Watt	But [MASK] had hardly said this when he regretted having done so. But then it was too late, the words were said and could never be forgotten, never undone. But a little later he regretted them less. And a little later he did not regret them at all.
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Watt	But there were connoisseurs on whom the exceptional quality of [MASK] was not lost, of his entry, his fall, his rise and subsequent attitudes. These were content. Among these was the newsagent. He had seen all from his warm nest of books and periodicals.
<name>Murphy</name>	Murphy	Watt	And the reason for that was perhaps this, that the ashes would not redden any more, but remained grey, even in the dimmest light. Finding himself now alone, with nothing in particular to do, [MASK] put his forefinger in his nose, first in one nostril, and then in the other.
<name>Newton</name>	Newton	Watt	So [MASK] considered, not only some of those solutions that had not apparently prevailed, but also some of those objections that were perhaps the cause of their not having done so, distributed as follows: Solution ist ........ 2nd ........ 3rd ........ 4th ........ Number of Solutions 4 ...... 3 ......
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Louit	The square root of the square root of the square root, said [MASK]. It was question-time. Rose and gloom, farewell and hail, mingled, clashed, vanquished, victor, victor, vanquished, in the vast indifferent chamber. And the ninth root?
<name>Quilp</name>	Quilp	Watt	Or it might have lost weight. This coat was of such length, that [MASK]’s trousers, which he wore very baggy, in order to conceal the shapes of his legs, were hidden by it from view.
<name>Godot</name>	Godot	Watt	He admired the permanent way, stretching away on either hand, in the moonlight, and the starlight, as far as the eye could reach, as far as [MASK]’s eye could have reached, if it had been inside the station.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Watt	Yet what could be more uncertain, than such a correspondence? As there seemed no measure between what [MASK] could understand, and what he could not, so there seemed none between what he deemed certain, and what he deemed doubtful.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Erskine	The only other object of note in [MASK]’s room was a picture, hanging on the wall, from a nail. A circle, obviously described by a compass, and broken at its lowest point, occupied the middle foreground, of this picture. Was it receding?
<name>Inspector</name>	Inspector	Watt	Nor was it possible, slipping the two keys off the ring, to hand them to [MASK], saying, Here, Sir, is the key of our waiting-room door, and here that of our booking-office door, I shall call for them on my way out.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Ifor	What was changed, if my information is correct, was the sentiment that a change, other than a change of degree, had taken place. What was changed was existence off the ladder. Do not come down the ladder, [MASK], I haf taken it away.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Watt	Then, as [MASK] still waited for the figure to draw very near indeed, he realized that it was not necessary, not at all necessary, that the figure should draw very near indeed, but that a moderate proximation would be more than sufficient.
<name>Larks</name>	Larks	Robins	[MASK], in particular, thanks to their con-fidingness, we destroyed in great numbers. And larks’ nests, laden with eggs still warm from the mother’s breast, we ground into fragments, under our feet, with peculiar satisfaction, at the appropriate season, of the year.
<name>Tristram</name>	Tristram	Watt	But on fine nights apparently not. For [MASK]’s eyes, when he put himself out, were no worse than another’s, even at this time, and the night was exceptionally fine, even for this part of the country, reputed for the fineness of its nights.
<name>He</name>	He	Watt	But in the kitchen a strange man was sitting, in the gloaming of the expiring range, on a chair. [MASK] asked this man who he was, and how he had got in. He felt it was his duty to do this.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Watt	But there was something wanting to [MASK]'s smile, some little thing was lacking, and people who saw it for the first time, and most people who saw it saw it for the first time, were sometimes in doubt as to what expression exactly was intended.
<name>Watt</name>	Watt	Watt	Then [MASK], for want of something to do, went back to his little game, with the colours. But he soon gave over. And the reason for that was perhaps this, that the ashes would not redden any more, but remained grey, even in the dimmest light.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Watt	The gentleman wore a fine full apron of green baize. [MASK] thought he had never seen a finer apron. In front there was a great pocket, or pouch, and in this the gentleman’s hands were buried.
<name>Tristram</name>	Tristram	Watt	Of [MASK]'s coat and waistcoat, of his shirt his vest and his drawers, much might be written, of great interest and significance. The drawers, in particular, were remarkable, from more than one point of view.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Watt	In front there was a great pocket, or pouch, and in this the gentleman’s hands were buried. [MASK] saw the little movements of the stuff, the little bulgings and crumplings, and the sudden indrawings, where it was nipped, between forefinger and thumb probably, for those are the nippers.
<name>Swift</name>	Swift	Fellowship	And yet, when I sat for [MASK], but for the boil on my bottom... The rest, an ordure. The Tuesday scowls, the Wednesday growls, the Thursday curses, the Friday howls, the Saturday snores, the Sunday yawns, the Monday morns, the Monday moms.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Watt	The most meagre, the least plausible, would have satisfied [MASK], who had not seen a symbol, nor executed an interpretation, since the age of fourteen, or fifteen, and who had lived, miserably it is true, among face values all his adult life, face values at least for him.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Watt	This chair then had been with [MASK], all this time, in the waiting-room, all these hours, of scant fight, of no fight, and it was with him still, in the exhilarating dawn.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Watt	For were their cries not heard, then their chances of rescue were small, so vast were these gardens, and so deserted, in the ordinary way. Some time passed, after [MASK]’s transfer, before we met again.
<name>He</name>	He	Watt	This further modification [MASK] carried through with all his usual discretion and sense of what was acceptable to the ear, and aesthetic judgement. Nevertheless to one, such as me, desirous above all of information, the change was not a little disconcerting.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Watt	And yet he was not a snorer. So the sound of the hell came always on the stillness. But on further reflexion it seemed to [MASK] that the bell’s coinciding with the snore would not have dissipated the mystery, but left it entire.
<name>Beecham's</name>	Beecham's	Bando	A capsule, before and after meals, in a little warm milk, and again at night, before turning in. I had tried everything, and was thoroughly disgusted, when a friend spoke to me of [MASK]. Her husband was never without it, you understand.
<name>Ramsay</name>	Ramsay	Watt	What so agitated [MASK] was this, that in the ten minutes or half-an-hour that had elapsed, since he first became aware of this figure, striding along, on the crest of the road, towards the station, the figure had gained nothing in height, in breadth or in distinctness.
<name>Tristram</name>	Tristram	Watt	But he was not so foolish as to found in this a principle of conduct, or a precedent of rebelliousness, ho no, for [MASK] was only too willing to do as he was told, and as custom required, at all times.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Watt	Its effect on the porter was to suggest to him words infinitely more disobliging than any he had already employed. But they were never spoken, by him, to [MASK], for suddenly the porter seized his can and wheeled it rapidly away.
<name>Phoebus</name>	Phoebus	Watt	With the result that though the sun though bright were not so bright as it might have been, if the wind were high [MASK] did not audibly complain, and that I, when illuminated by rays of appropriate splendour, could forgive a wind which, while strong, might with advantage have been stronger.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Watt	The grass was sparse, sere, and overrun with what [MASK] took to be a species of cockle. The horse seemed hardly able to stand, let alone run. This object too had not been always here, would perhaps not be always here.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Watt	The porter chose with care a can in one group and wheeled it to the other. Then he chose with care a can in the other and wheeled it to the one. He is sorting the cans, said [MASK]. Or perhaps it is a punishment for disobedience, or some neglect of duty.
<name>John</name>	John	Erskine	and [MASK] get up and go down. He would hear the sound of the bell because he was not asleep, or only half asleep, or sleeping only lightly. For it is rare that the sound of a bell not far away is not heard by the only half asleep, the only lightly sleeping.
<name>Gavroche</name>	Gavroche	Watt	This horse, its four hooves firmly planted on the ground, its head sunk, seemed to consider, without appetite, the grass. [MASK] pushed forward his head, to see if it was really a horse, and not a mare, or a gelding.
<name>Rinaldo</name>	Rinaldo	Watt	Heroic quatrains are not otherwise elaborated. As [MASK] came, so he went, in the night, that covers all things with its cloak, especially when the weather is cloudy. It was summer, he thought, because the air was not quite cold.
<name>John</name>	John	Watt	’s threshold than he saw that the house was not in such darkness as he had at first supposed, for a light was burning in the kitchen. When [MASK] reached this light he sat down beside it, on a chair.
<name>He</name>	He	Watt	Or perhaps it is a punishment for disobedience, or some neglect of duty. [MASK] sat with his back to the engine, which now, having got up steam, drew the long line of carriages out of the station.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Watt	[MASK] wondered how this picture would look upside down, with the point west and the breach north, or on its right side, with the point north and the breach east, or on its left side, with the point south and the breach west.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Watt	When he had led them to the music-room, and left them there, [MASK] wondered if he had done right. He felt he had done right, but he was not sure. Should he not perhaps rather have sent them flying about their business?
<name>Septimus</name>	Septimus	Erskine	For would [MASK] have got up and gone down if the bell had not sounded? No. He might have got up, without the bell’s sounding, to do his number one, or number two, in his great big white chamber-pot.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Watt	Sometimes he emptied the bowl, scraping its sides, and bottom, with the trowel, until they shone, and sometimes he left the half of it, or some other fraction, and sometimes he left the whole of it. Twelve possibilities occurred to [MASK], in this connexion:
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Watt	[MASK] was so busy doing this, moving his hat to and fro behind him, that he neither saw, nor heard, the door open and a gentleman come in. So his surprise was extreme, when he looked up from his little game.
<name>Phileas</name>	Phileas	Watt	It had left on time, it had passed on time, and it would arrive, at its destination, if nothing supervened to delay it, on time. Here then was the explanation of the recent external commotion. It was now fully two hours since [MASK] had passed water.
<name>Molloy</name>	Molloy	Watt	No, there was so to speak nothing that [MASK] could forget, that he could not do without, for the fourteen or fifteen hours that his day lasted, for the ten or nine hours that his night lasted. And yet every now
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Watt	If he had been able to accept it, then perhaps it would not have revisited him, and this would have been a great saving of vexation, to put it mildly. But he could not accept it, could not hear it. One wonders sometimes where [MASK] thought he was.
<name>Jean</name>	Jean	Watt	[MASK] waited, with impatience, for this man, if it was a man, or for this woman, if it was a woman, or for this priest, if it was a priest, or for this nun, if it was a nun, to draw near, and set his mind at rest.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Watt	[MASK] picked up his bags and got into the train. He did not choose a compartment. It happened to be empty. On the platform the porter continued to wheel cans, up and down. At one end of the platform there was one group of cans, and at the other end there was another.
<name>Zaphod</name>	Zaphod	Watt	On. Taw ta kool tonk? Nilb, man, mud. Tinfo trap,yad la. Nem owt, disyb dis. It took me some time to get used to this. Nodrap, nodrap geb, said [MASK], nodrap geb.
<name>Herodotus</name>	Herodotus	Watt	To such an extent is this true, that one is sometimes tempted to wonder, with reference to two or even three incidents related by [MASK] as separate and distinct, if they are not in reality the same incident, variously interpreted.
<name>announce</name>	announce	Watt	But in a short time the gentleman reappeared, to [MASK]. He was dressed for the road, and carried a stick. But no hat was on his head, nor any bag in his hand. Before leaving he made the following short statement: Haw!
<name>Tristram</name>	Tristram	Watt	So we walked to and fro, neither in his garden, in the way described. So we began, after so long a time, to walk together again, and to talk, from time to time. As [MASK] walked, so now he talked, back to front.
<name>He</name>	He	Watt	But they were hidden, coat and waistcoat, shirt and underclothes, all hidden, from the eye. [MASK] wore no tie, nor any collar. Had he had a collar, he would no doubt have found a tie, to go with it.
<name>Swann</name>	Swann	Watt	By wearing, on the foot that was too small, not one sock of his pair of socks, but both, and on the foot that was too large, not the other, but none, [MASK] strove in vain to correct this asymmetry.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Watt	He was short and limped dreadfully. When he got started he moved rapidly, in a series of aborted genuflexions. He picked up [MASK]’s hat and brought it to him, saying, Your hat, sir, I think.
<name>Meursault</name>	Meursault	Evans	The next morning he would carry his bicycle up the stairs again. It was heavy, being a very good bicycle. It would have been simpler to leave it below, but he preferred to have it near him. This man’s name was [MASK].
<name>Molloy</name>	Molloy	Watt	For the belch was never the same, two days running, to go no further than the belch. [MASK] had no hand in these transformations, and did not know at what hour of the twenty-four they were carried out.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Watt	But in a short time it returned, the same smell exactly, dilated and passed off, as before. In this way it came and went, for some hours. There was something about this smell that [MASK] could not help but like.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Erskine	But he would have appreciated it more if it had come earlier, before he had grown used to his loss of species. The song that [MASK] sang, or rather intoned, was always the same. It was: ?
<name>Flora</name>	Flora	Miss	thanks and you thanks withered too granma J J syj , J J 171 J/l TEN. thanks and you thanks drooping too mamamam 1 J J J 7 J , J J / 7/ / BAS. thanks and you thanks blooming too [MASK]
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Watt	That before him, behind him, on all sides of him, there was something else, neither sky nor waste, was not felt by [MASK]. And it was always their long dark flowing away together towards the mirage of union that lay before him, whichever way he turned.
<name>Jean</name>	Jean	Watt	But [MASK] knew too well, too too well, of what dimensions certain women, and certain nuns, were capable, to conclude, from those of this night-wanderer, that this night-wanderer was not a woman, nor a nun, but a man, or a priest.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Watt	he said. [MASK] did not cry out on this extravagant suggestion, let fall, it is only fair to say, in the heat of anger. He stooped to pick up his hat and bags, but straightened himself up without having done so.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Watt	[MASK] picked himself up, little the worse for his fall, as usual. The devil raise a hump on you, said the porter. He was a handsome if dirty fellow. It is so difficult for railway porters to keep sweet and clean, with the work they have to do.
<name>He</name>	He	Tetty	Then it moved on, disclosing, on the pavement, motionless, a solitary figure, lit less and less by the receding lights, until it was scarcely to be distinguished from the dim wall behind it. [MASK] was not sure whether it was a man or a woman.
<name>Murphy</name>	Murphy	Watt	So [MASK] busied himself a little while, covering the lamp, less and less, more and more, with his hat, watching the ashes greyen, redden, greyen, redden, in the grate, of the range.
<name>Wang</name>	Wang	Knott	But while it sounded he was gladdened, as by the rain on the bamboos, or even rushes, as by the land against the waves, doomed to cease, doomed to come again. [MASK] was also addicted to solitary dactylic ejaculations of extraordinary vigour, accompanied by spasms of the members.
<name>He</name>	He	Watt	But why do I trouble you with this, you, a perfect stranger. It is because tonight I must speak, to a fellow wanderer. Where do you get down, sir? [MASK] named the place. I beg your pardon?
<name>Woolf</name>	Woolf	Watt	The following is an example of [MASK]’s manner at this period: Of nought. To the source. To the teacher. To the temple. To him I brought. This emptied heart. These emptied hands. This mind ignoring. This body homeless.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Watt	Then one hitter night [MASK] left his warm bed and went down, and took in the key, and he wrapped it in a snippet of blanket, that he had snipped, from his own blanket. And then he put it out again, under the stone.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Tetty	He slipped down with the little sunlit fields, he toiled up with the foothills to the dark bluff, and he heard the distant clink of the hammers. She left you all alone in the yard, said [MASK], with the goat.
<name>Chuzzlewit</name>	Chuzzlewit	Arthur	Good-day. I helped to lay out this darling place, said the old man. In that case, said [MASK], perhaps you can tell me the name of this extraordinary growth. That’s what we calls a hardy laurel, said the old man.
<name>gentleman</name>	gentleman	Ash	This [MASK] was what I believe is still called an Admiralty Clerk of the Second Class and with that a sterling fellow. Such vermin pullulate. He died of premature exhaustion, the following week, oiled and houseled, leaving his half-hunter to his house-plumber.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Watt	For since when were [MASK]’s concerns with what things were, in reality? But he was for ever falling into this old error, this error of the old days when, lacerated with curiosity, in the midst of substance shadowy he stumbled.
<name>Murphy</name>	Murphy	Watt	It was not part of the ceiling, nor of a wall, nor, though it seemed in contact with the floor, of the floor, that was all that [MASK] could affirm, of this object, and even that little he affirmed with reserve.
<name>Lucien</name>	Lucien	Watt	There were four armpits, where the friezes met, four fair armpits. [MASK] saw the ceding with an extreme distinctness. It was of a whiteness that he would not have believed possible, if it had been reported to him. It was a rest, after the wall.
<name>Shem</name>	Shem	Watt	Say he’d, Shave. These were sounds that at first, though we walked pubis to pubis, seemed so much balls to me. Nor did [MASK] follow me. Pardon, pardon beg, he said, pardon beg.
<name>Quin</name>	Quin	Watt	they were all cut short, all without exception, at the same point. And the reason for that was this, that [MASK], where he stood, swaying, murmuring, was nearer the waiting-room door than the waiting-room door was wide.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Watt	[MASK] did not of course wonder all these things at the time, but some he wondered at the time, and the others subsequently. But those that he wondered at the time, he again wondered subsequently, together with those that he did not wonder at the time, over and over again.
<name>Tristram</name>	Tristram	Watt	Then [MASK] began to invert, no longer the order of the letters in the word together with that of the sentences in the period, but that of the letters in the word together with that of the words in the sentence together with that of the sentences in the period.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Watt	But that would come, [MASK] knew that would come, with patience it would come, little by little, whether he liked it or not, over the yard wall, and through the window, first the grey, then the brighter colours one by one, until getting on to nine a.m.
<name>Macalister</name>	Macalister	Watt	This boot [MASK] had bought, for eight pence, from a one-legged man who, having lost his leg, and a fortiori his foot, in an accident, was happy to realize, on his discharge from hospital, for such a sum, his unique remaining marketable asset.
<name>Asimov</name>	Asimov	Watt	Here was a teaser, to be sure. The voice said further, A friend. It might have been a high male voice, or it might have been a deep female voice. [MASK] stated this incident as follows:
<name>Ulick</name>	Ulick	Watt	For [MASK]’s sense of chronology was strong, in a way, and his dislike of battology was very strong. Often my hands left his shoulders, to make a note in their little notebook. But his never left mine, unless I detached them personally.
<name>She</name>	She	Arthur	He enjoyed this incident too, at the time, more than he had enjoyed anything for a long time, or would enjoy anything again, for a considerable time. But it tired him, in the end, and he was glad when [MASK] left off, and went away.
<name>Providence</name>	Providence	Mary	At the moment that the one hand presses, with open palm, between the indefatigable jaws, a cold potato, onion, tart or sandwich, the other darts into the pouch and there, unerringly, fastens on a sandwich, onion, tart or cold potato, as [MASK] wills.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Watt	These are delicate questions. For when [MASK] at last spoke of this time, it was a time long past, and of which his recollections were, in a sense, perhaps less clear than he would have wished, though too clear for his liking, in another.
<name>Ransom</name>	Ransom	Watt	Ot niks, sorg sam, sorg sam. Ot lems, lats lems, lats lems. Otgnut, trat stews, trat stews. These were sounds that at first, though we walked breast to breast, made little or no sense to me. Nor did [MASK] follow me.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Watt	This fugitive penetration took place shortly after [MASK]’s arrival. On his answering the door, as his habit was, when there was a knock at the door, he found standing before it, or so he realized later, arm in arm, an old man and a middleaged man.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Watt	When the express-train had come, and gone, and he was free to go home, to his unquiet wife, then he could do something, then he could admit [MASK] to the waiting-room, and leave him there.
<name>Watt</name>	Watt	Watt	Thus of the pseudopot he would say, after reflection, It is a shield, or, growing bolder, It is a raven, and so on. But the pot proved as little a shield, or a raven, or any other of the things that [MASK] called it, as a pot.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Watt	For [MASK] considered, with reason, that he was successful, in this enterprise, when he could evolve, from the meticulous phantoms that heset him, a hypothesis proper to disperse them, as often as this might be found necessary.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Boss	He lifted them towards the maker, and giver, of all things, of him, of the daisies, of the grass. Thanks [MASK], he said. He stood easy. He moved on. This is said to be good for the health, he said.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Watt	[MASK] was not a man’s man either, possessing as he did none of those properties that attract men to men, though of course he had had male friends (what wretch has not?) on more than one occasion.
<name>Beckett</name>	Beckett	Watt	The following is an example of [MASK]’s manner, at this period: Day of most, night of part, Knott with now. Now till up, little seen so oh, little heard so oh. Night till morningjrom. Heard I this, saw I this then what.
<name>Bandylegs</name>	Bandylegs	Erskine	and [MASK] very much mine, that is to say little fat shabby seedy juicy or oily bandylegged men, with a little fat bottom sticking out in front and a little fat belly sticking out behind, for what would a little fat bottom sticking out in front be without a little fat belly sticking out behind?
<name>he</name>	he	Watt	The waiting-room was empty of furniture, or other objects, as far as [MASK] could see. Unless there was something behind him. This did not strike him as strange. Nor did it strike him as usual.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Watt	So [MASK] waited, with impatience, for the figure to draw near. He waited and waited, his hands curled round the bars, of the wicket, so that his nails pricked his palms, his bags at his feet, staring through the bars, staring at this incomprehensible stallage, suffering greatly from impatience.
<name>Wegg</name>	Wegg	Watt	His habitual tone was one of assurance. But what kind of witness was [MASK], weak now of eye, hard of hearing, and with even the more intimate senses greatly below par? A needy witness, an imperfect witness. The better to witness, the worse to witness.
