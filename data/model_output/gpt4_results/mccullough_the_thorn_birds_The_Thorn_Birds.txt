<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Teresa	[MASK] had innumerable toys; besides being much younger than her nearest sister, she belonged to an Italian family, which meant she was passionately and openly loved, and indulged to the full extent of her father’s monetary resources.
<name>Arnie</name>	Arnie	Luke	One thing [MASK] was never afraid of, and that was hard work; he thrived on it the way some men thrived on its opposite, whether because his father had been a barfly and a town joke or because he had inherited his German mother’s love of industry no one had ever bothered to find out.
<name>it</name>	it	Gilly	The Home Paddock was nothing less than a gigantic circular firebreak. Everyone talked of the fires [MASK] had seen in its seventy-odd years of existence. Curiously enough, fires were never a major threat during prolonged drought, because there wasn’t sufficient grass then to keep a fire going far.
<name>missa</name>	missa	Missa	What I grope for, you knew by instinct. It isn’t you who is unhappy, it’s those of us here, left behind. Pity us, and when our times come, help us. “Ite, [MASK] est... Requiescat in pace...
<name>Severian</name>	Severian	Dane	We are first men, and it is with men you will deal in this world as in others.” [MASK] bowed his head, then leaned forward to stroke the cat, pausing with his hand extended. “May I? I love cats, Your Eminence.”
<name>She</name>	She	Meggie	I wonder how many people will be smart enough to read between the lines of what you said?” “He will, anyway, if he ever sees it.” “I wonder does he remember us?” [MASK] sighed. “Undoubtedly.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Dane	She leaned forward. “[MASK]! What are you up to? Come out of there this instant!” He crawled out from under the closest bottle brush, his hands full of black earth, suspicious black smears all around his mouth.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Paddy	Out here it’s sheep, but in the city it’s people.” Only [MASK] was far afield that day in August when the big storm broke. He got down from his horse, tied the animal securely to a tree and sat beneath a wilga to wait it out.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Fee	He bent over [MASK], his hand picking up one limp wrist. “What is it, dear?” he asked in tones more tender than any of his children had ever heard him use; yet somehow they knew they were the tones he used with her when they were not around to hear.
<name>John</name>	John	Dominic	“[MASK], I hate to ask it of you, but when these people come in they’re going to be half dead. We’ll have to hold the funerals tomorrow, and even if the Gilly undertaker could make the coffins in time, we’d never get them out through the mud.
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Justine	He popped into a chemist shop while [MASK] waited outside, emerged beaming happily. “Now we’re all set, my love.” “What did you buy? French letters?” He grimaced. “I should hope not.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Meggie	They drove between the cliff and the angling water in a wet, glittering archway of fantastic light and shadow. And as they climbed the air grew cool, exquisitely fresh; [MASK] had forgotten how good cool air made her feel.
<name>Fee</name>	Fee	Rain	Nor could the Drogheda people help, because she had always withheld herself from them, too. She had had to run from [MASK]. To say yes, commit herself to him, and then have to watch him recoil when he found out the extent of her inadequacy?
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Frank	Believe me, you’re going to pay. You won’t get away with it any more than I did. I lost [MASK] in the worst way a mother could; I can’t even see him and I long to.... You wait!
<name>Woland</name>	Woland	Bob	the Cardinal asked. “I’ve seen millions of burrows, but nary a rabbit.” “The rabbits are all dead,” [MASK] answered. “Dead?” “That’s right, from something called myxomatosis.
<name>Moira</name>	Moira	Meggie	“You’re a good girl, wee [MASK].” He tugged at the white taffeta bow on the back of her head until it hung lopsided. Up came the big grey eyes to his face adoringly; over the nodding head of the baby she might have been his own age, or older.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Jus	“It does, doesn’t it? Life wouldn’t be the same if I couldn’t talk to you.” “That’s what I was afraid you were going to say.” He grinned. “But seriously, [MASK], you worry me.
<name>Wally</name>	Wally	Bob	Went through them big buggers of tanks like a dose of salts.” “Oh, yeah, tell me another!” said [MASK] skeptically. “I’m a sergeant and I never heard a whisper, you’re a private and you know all about it.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Luke	“Isn’t this nice?” [MASK] asked, apparently not upset at her lack of enthusiasm. “Just turn a key and press a button on the dashboard and the car starts. No cranking a handle, no hoping the darned donk catches before a man’s exhausted.
<name>Ron</name>	Ron	Dane	“I give up on you, [MASK], I really do. Some of the best-tasting things are the most poisonous.” “Name one!” he challenged. “Treacle!” she said triumphantly.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Dane	[MASK] was a grown man, not a helpless baby. I let him go, didn’t I? If I had let myself feel the way you do, I’d be sitting here blaming myself into a mental asylum because I had permitted him to live his own life.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Meggie	And besides, the land’s demanding in a neutered way. It takes just about all they’ve got to give, because I don’t think they have a great deal. In a physical sense, I mean. Hasn’t it ever struck you, [MASK]?
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Luke	Was it just a figment of women’s imaginations? Or was it something only women were able to feel, or men with a little woman in them? No woman could ever hold [MASK], no woman ever had. What he wanted no woman could ever give him.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Luke	The big Rolls engine ticked gently in the silence, warm air pouring almost soundlessly through the vents; two separate kinds of lulling noise. [MASK] unknotted his tie and pulled it off, opened his shirt collar. Their jackets were on the back seat, too warm for the car.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Frank	“It isn’t dirty,” she repeated wearily, and looked at him from her clear tired eyes as if she had suddenly decided to put shame behind her forever. “It’s not dirty, [MASK], and nor is the act which created it.”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Dane	Two young Englishmen talking in drawling Oxford accents lay like broiling lobsters not far away, and beyond them two women drowsily speaking in German. [MASK] glanced at the women and self-consciously hitched his swimsuit, aware they had stopped conversing and had sat up to pat their hair, smile at him.
<name>Jimmy</name>	Jimmy	Frank	Put up against a flyweight because of his size, [MASK] knocked him out with the third punch he threw, and offered to fight someone else. By the time he was on his third professional the word had got around, and the tent was so jammed they could not fit another eager spectator inside.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Drogheda	Did I give you the kid you wanted? Funny, how women get their hearts set on kids. I reckon that’s what really broke us up, eh? Let me know how you’re getting on, and how [MASK] weathered the drought.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Rob	But she didn’t yearn to go again, or make friends with the couple [MASK] brought along. She immersed herself in the sea, and walked, and lay in the sun. Curiously enough, she didn’t even miss having books to read, for there always seemed to be something interesting to watch.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Anne	“I just want to see her for a little while, that’s all.” “I’m well aware of it. Your Grace. But the fact remains that you’d harm her a great deal less if you wanted more,” said [MASK].
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Frank	Little enough to make life easier for you.” “It’s my job, [MASK]. I don’t mind.” “I just wish we’d get rich one of these days, so you could have a maid.” “That is wishful thinking!”
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Dane	It would change too many things, and I’d lose my friend. I need my friend, I can’t afford to be without my friend. I shall keep him as I keep [MASK], a male human being without any physical significance for me.
<name>Brigid</name>	Brigid	Meggie	He could hear her moving about, shedding her wrapper. And tomorrow morning I’ll say Mass. But that’s tomorrow morning, and the magic has long gone. There is still the night, and [MASK]. I have wanted her. She, too, is a sacrament.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Meggie	“Do you mind if we cut the rest of our tour short?” the priest asked. “I think we could all do with a rest and a cup of tea at the presbytery.” He pinched the tip of [MASK]’s nose.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Dane	Asking herself why it should go on hurting so. When [MASK] was alive she hadn’t really thought very much about him except when she was with him, and after they were grown up their time together had been limited, their vocations almost opposed.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Meggie	No doubt everyone will sleep in, but if someone’s awake at the usual time you’ll be in the soup. And you can’t say you’ve been with me, [MASK], even to your own family.” She got up and stood staring down at him.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Luke	[MASK] is the kind of man who quite genuinely doesn’t care if he eats his food off a packing crate and sleeps on the floor. Don’t you see? One can’t appeal to him as to one who likes nice things, because he doesn’t.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Meggie	[MASK] was terrified of infantile paralysis, diphtheria, anything which might swoop out of nowhere to carry them off, so whatever vaccines became available they received. It was an ideal existence, full of physical activity and mental stimulation.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Luke	It hasn’t been pleasant, this thing with [MASK], but it was far better for me to stay and work it out.” The rain was beginning to inch its way across the dimming cane blotting out everything behind its edge, like a grey cleaver.
<name>Fiona</name>	Fiona	Meggie	They took no notice of [MASK] as she stood crying; it did not occur to her to seek help, for in the Cleary family those who could not fight their own battles got scant aid or sympathy, and that went for girls, too.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Fee	“You’re remorseless. Tell me, then, where do we go wrong?” “In being bom,” said [MASK]. Men were returning home in thousands upon thousands, shedding their khaki uniforms and slouch hats for civvies.
<name>the painting</name>	the painting	Agnes	How fine it was, how rich and full of color! It took him half an hour of cajoling to make her look at [MASK], and half an hour more elapsed before he could persuade her to peer into the scalped hole.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Frank	The atmosphere inside had not agreed with his gorge either, and he wished the dignity of his calling permitted him the relief of releasing it in public. “Do you want to wait for [MASK], or would you rather we went now?”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Jims	As far as I can judge, his gut’s in one piece, so is his bladder. The only thing is . . .” “Well, what?” [MASK] prompted impatiently; he was still shaking, and blue around the mouth.
<name>Fiona</name>	Fiona	Meggie	“Well, children, are we not honored? Another Cleary in our school, and she cannot wait to broadcast her name!” She turned back to [MASK]. “Stand up when I address you, you ignorant little savage! And hold out your hands, please.”
<name>dear</name>	dear	Meggie	“You can’t, my [MASK].” “Yes, I can. I was going to find him tonight, but my legs wouldn’t hold me up, and I don’t like the dark. But in the morning I’ll look for him.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Luke	I’m not going to touch a penny of it, you know that. It’s to buy our station later on. For the next few years we’re both going to work hard, and save every penny we earn. All right?” She nodded. “Yes, [MASK].”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Bob	Not too often a gun shearer will give up the boggi for a saddle. Be handy paddock-crutching, though, eh?” With the passing of the years [MASK]’s accent grew more drawling and Australian but his sentences shorter in compensation.
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Paddy	“You’re no better than a shitty old dog after any bitch you can stick your thing into!” “And you’re no better than the shitty old dog who fathered you, whoever he was! Thank God I never had a hand in it!” shouted [MASK], and stopped.
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Paddy	Yes, it was possible to believe these two men in their simple uniforms, slouch hats pinned above their left ears with the badge of the AIF rising sun, had killed fellow men. It was in their eyes, blue as [MASK]’s but sadder, without his gentleness.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Luke	Her excellent eyesight just discerned a black-haired man in the back, and she crowed with relief and joy. “I don’t believe what I see, but I think [MASK]’s finally remembered he’s got a wife!”
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Luke	I think so. I’ll never understand why, but I think so. There’s something in [MASK] and in you which believes that needing a woman is a weakness. I don’t mean to sleep with; I mean to need, really need.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Meggie	“Well, if you aren’t a woman by now, you’ll never be one. I’d say you qualified. I must be getting old; I feel garrulous.” [MASK] laughed, delighted at her mother’s overture, and anxious not to destroy this new mood.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Luke	“I’m not ready to leave the sugar yet,” he said, stubbornly, still staring at his daughter’s strange light eyes. “And that’s the truth at last, isn’t it? Why don’t you admit it, [MASK]?
<name>Victoria</name>	Victoria	Rain	Since [MASK] liked unadorned styles, she put on a floor-length silk jersey dress of dull burgundy red, high to the neck, long tight sleeves. She added a big flat collar of tortuous gold studded with garnets and pearls, and matching bracelets on each wrist.
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Patsy	I wouldn’t have believed anyone could stimulate [MASK] into speech, but he’s doing it, bless him. They’re talking away like old hens, and where did he get Australian beer for them? He likes them, and he’s interested, I suppose.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Fritz	7 am to be entrusted to a cabby, but not the future of the Common Market, eh? Well, just to show you how little I need a taxi or your security-clearanced [MASK], I’m going to catch the tube home.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Meggie	Did I sense it, all those years ago? I must have, I suppose. My passion for titian hair! Little did I know where it would lead me. I love you, [MASK].” “Are you leaving?” “Tomorrow. I must.
<name>Arinze</name>	Arinze	Ralph	Jealousy and resentment are not strangers to seminaries any more than they are to secular institutions. You will suffer a little because they think [MASK] is your uncle, your mother’s brother, but you would suffer far more if they thought no blood bond linked you together.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Fee	“I doubt I’ve managed to earn this much in all my working days,” he said. “What shall I do with it?” [MASK] asked, staring at it and then looking up at him, eyes blazing.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Meggie	[MASK] gave in, the enormity of her relief showing in the way she sat, loosely now, relaxed. “The distance in his eyes. That’s what I notice myself most of all. Is it so obvious?
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Fascinated	[MASK], terrified, meaning to free himself at any cost, he pulled her head away; but somehow all he succeeded in doing was having her back in his arms, a snake coiled tightly about his will, strangling it.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Paddy	[MASK] took the boys up on deck and kept them there in spite of the bitter wind and constant spray, only going below to see his women and baby when some kind soul volunteered to keep an eye on his four miserable, retching boys.
<name>Francis</name>	Francis	Dane	“Because of the love I bear Our Lord. I want to serve Him as His priest all of my days.” “Do you understand what His service entails, [MASK]?” “Yes.” “That no other love must ever come between you and Him?
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Dane	But I pray that with His help I shall find the strength.” “Must it be this, [MASK]? Will nothing less than this content you?” “Nothing.” “And if later on you should change your mind, what would you do?”
<name>he</name>	he	Meggie	“I would only ask you to think about what I’ve said, and take your time.” But even as he made his request, he couldn’t help feeling that [MASK] had reaped far more benefit from his visit than he had.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dane	[MASK] would understand, he always did. Only somehow she didn’t think she’d tell him all the reasons why she wasn’t able to go. Much as she loved her brother, she didn’t feel like listening to what would be one of his sternest homilies ever.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Meggie	[MASK] stared dismally at the blue-and-white designs gamboling all around each small piece; at the fantastic trees with their funny puffy blossoms, at the ornate little pagoda, at the strangely stilled pair of birds and the minute figures eternally fleeing across the kinky bridge.
<name>Albus</name>	Albus	Luddie	The grey eyes crinkled at the comers. “I’ll try!” “I’ve picked up most of [MASK]’s tomes over the years, when I’ve run out of my own books. Especially the ones with the ancient Greek stories, because they fascinate me.
<name>He</name>	He	Stuart	[MASK] had gone a bare half mile when he noticed that a stand of burned timber drew very close to the fire’s demarcation line. There was a little wilga as black and crinkled as a pickaninny’s mop, and the remains of a great stump standing close to the charred boundary.
<name>Clatterina</name>	Clatterina	Justine	“What are you going to call your noisy daughter?” he asked as the door closed and they were alone. “[MASK].” “It’s a very good name, but why did you choose it?” “I read it somewhere, and I liked it.”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Paddy	On [MASK]’s face he glimpsed an expression which mirrored his own thoughts, and smiled faintly. What bliss it would be if just once in his life he could show his feelings! But habit, training and discretion were too ingrained.
<name>Shaddam</name>	Shaddam	Frank	Thus his size was never the obsession with him it was with [MASK]. Now he watched the boy carefully, trying to understand him and failing; this one had always been the farthest from his heart, no matter how he struggled against discriminating among his children.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Gillanbone	So she had abjured the flesh, preferring to wield power; it was inconceivable that she should take a lover, for when it came to gossip [MASK] was as receptive as a wire to an electrical current. To prove herself human and weak was not a part of her obsession.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Luke	“Let me give you a little word of advice, [MASK]. In case you ever get yourself another woman, when you’re too old and too tired to give yourself to the cane any more. You can’t kiss for toffee.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Ralph	I just can’t!” She got to her feet quickly, straightened her blouse, stood looking down at him and smiling a twisted smile which only threw the failed pain in her eyes into greater emphasis. “It’s all right, [MASK].
<name>Rosemary</name>	Rosemary	Meggie	And for my punishment I’m going to live a long, long time.” He got up and pulled her to her feet, put his arms about her loosely and affectionately. “I think this is goodbye, [MASK]. We can’t be alone again.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Drogheda	It’s so good to see [MASK] coming back, I feel better within myself because of it. For the first time in years I feel like talking.” “Well, I must say when you decide to talk you really know how to pick your subject!
<name>Gandalf</name>	Gandalf	Rainer	“I’ve dithered long enough. Sitting here ever since [MASK] came, hoping I wouldn’t need to do anything at all, hoping the decision wouldn’t rest with me. Yet he was right. In the end, it’s been for me to do.”
<name>Lord</name>	Lord	Lord	We shall pray now, and I shall add the Rose to my prayers for the rest of my life. Our Dear [MASK] sends us many griefs and much pain during our progress to eternal life. We must learn to bear it, I as much as you.”
<name>Shakespeare</name>	Shakespeare	Dane	He tried for ten minutes to get the words of the quotation in their right order and couldn’t, then he gave up, put one of the daffodils between his teeth instead and did a dance. Can you ever imagine [MASK] doing that?
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Luke	To go for dinner and a walk with [MASK] she had dressed as custom demanded in heeled shoes, silk stockings, satin slip, floating silk frock with belt and elbow sleeves. On her head was a big straw hat, on her hands were gloves.
<name>Una</name>	Una	Meggie	You at least have your family.” “You have your God.” “Well said, [MASK]! You are growing up!” But, tenacious female, her mind had returned to the question she had ridden three miles without a chance to ask.
<name>Mildred</name>	Mildred	Meggie	“You’re becoming a real old woman, [MASK]. Stop!” “I can’t, I can’t! And I am an old woman.” “Nonsense, you’re just in brisk middle age. Well and truly young enough to hop on that plane.”
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Fee	She was like a lighthouse, he thought; flashes of grief every time her mind came round to that pitch of emotion which was too great to be contained. A huge flare, and then a long period of nothing. “[MASK], I want you to think about something.”
<name>God</name>	God	Dane	“I am a Catholic, and my religion has been the one thing in my life which has never failed me, though I have failed it many times. I dislike speaking of [MASK], because my heart tells me some things are better left undiscussed.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Vittorio	In death he will find the peace he could not find here in this life.” “The boy, [MASK]! A tragedy.” “Do you think so? I like rather to think of it as beautiful.
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	Paddy	“As far as I know, yes.” “And she gave it to you as late as last night?” “Yes.” “Then why didn’t you destroy it, make sure poor old [MASK] got what’s rightfully his?
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Fee	“All right,” said [MASK], “now we can move up from the creek. I’ll do the other rooms at my leisure. Oh, isn’t it lovely to have money and a decent home to spend it on?”
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Meggie	But her head was down, she wouldn’t look at him. “It’s time we were going, [MASK],” he said. Without a word she turned to her horse, mounted and waited for him; usually it was he who waited for her.
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Meggie	How anyone so precariously mounted and hatted could stay unruffled upon a horse at anything faster than an amble was beyond [MASK]’s imagination, until she saw one splendid creature take her prancing animal over a series of difficult jumps and finish as impeccable as before she started.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Justine	Disgusting. How do I know who kissed it last? They might have had a cold.” “You don’t have to kiss my ring, [MASK]. I’m here on a holiday; I’m not being a cardinal at the moment.”
<name>Lucius</name>	Lucius	Justine	It was the same Roman emperor’s face, and imperially unperturbed by threats of insurrection. “[MASK], this is not something to play with, nor am I someone to play with. There’s plenty of time. You have every reason to know I can be patient.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Justine	He leaned back in his chair, crossed his legs and lit another cigarette. “[MASK] has donned some kind of hair shirt, but for all the wrong reasons. If anyone can make her see it, you can.
<name>Two</name>	Two	Ralph	Something in her little soul was old enough and woman enough to feel the irresistible, stinging joy of being needed; she sat rocking his head back and forth, back and forth, until his grief expended itself in emptiness. TWO jg2i-1928 ‘[MASK] g ft S
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Justine	It could not dare be otherwise. He threw the packet into the basket for general nonsecret correspondence, immediate reply, and opened the letter from [MASK]. It began badly, without any kind of salutation. Thank you for the cable.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Ralph	“I’ve got the part of [MASK] the Church can never have, the part of him which carries on from generation to generation. Through me he’ll continue to live, because I know it’s going to be a son!
<name>Yegor</name>	Yegor	Dane	A chuckle very like her own echoed from the interior of the bottle-brush shrubbery nearby, its drooping scarlet cylinders hiding the author of the chuckle. “Listen! There he is, that’s [MASK]! Do you know at his age he can sit a horse as well as I can?”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Frank	“A cup of tea? Very good idea.” The Cleary men came into the room together, and that was very hard, for they hadn’t forgiven him at all. [MASK] knew why; it was the way he had hurt their mother.
<name>Meggie</name>	Meggie	Meggie	He watched [MASK] as she stood on the front veranda, peering up the track toward Drogheda big house. “She’s so pretty, your daughter. I have a fondness for titian hair, you know. Hers would have sent the artist running for his brushes.
