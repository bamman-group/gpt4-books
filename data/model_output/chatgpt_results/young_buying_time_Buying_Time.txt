<name>Someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the context)	Someone (There is no proper name given in the context)	Claire	“And frankly, I don’t view what I have in mind as murder. [MASK]’s going to die. We’re just going to speed the process along. Anyway, you haven’t heard my plan yet.” Plan?
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Quincy	I swear this guy is on the up-and-up.” “Sure he is. He’s probably looking for somebody to launder his drug money. I’m not interested.” “C’mon, at least meet the dude,” [MASK] begged.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Flanagan	“Anything’s possible.” He could almost see the wheels turning in [MASK]’s head. True criminal attorneys didn’t care about guilt or innocence. For them, the intellectual challenge came from winning an unwinnable case.
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Dre	“No, she’s not.” [MASK] hurried over, but froze when he was only inches away. He stared down at her bruised and bloated face, then pulled her into his arms. “Dude put his hands on you?” There was bewilderment in his voice.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Waverly	I have some cash I want you to invest for me. I understand you get your clients a pretty nice rate of return.” [MASK] struggled to sound undaunted. “How do you even know what I do?” “You invest in dying people.”
<name>Terry</name>	Terry	Waverly	“You gotta help me out on this. They’re kinda expecting to talk to you. If they don’t, they’re going to take it out on me.” [MASK] lowered his head and exhaled. He should just hang up the phone.
<name>Janine</name>	Janine	Barnes	“And why?” “Three o’clock in the twelfth floor conference room,” [MASK] said. “Make sure your memo really pumps up your case. He’ll probably use it as a basis for deciding whether to shut it down permanendy.”
<name>Marty</name>	Marty	Waverly	[MASK] stepped back into the garage, his legs shaky with anxiety. What should he do? Call the police? And say what? The guy I was laundering money for came to my house to kill me. He looked around, scanning the garage shelves in search of a weapon.
<name>he</name>	he	Waverly	“Man, you’re a piece of work. Did you even ask her if she saw the whole thing?” “Not really,” [MASK] said, obviously embarrassed. “I guess I just assumed she did.”
<name>Love</name>	Love	Becker	He never would have shipped off one of his kids to some boarding school to be raised by strangers. [MASK] existed for his wife and kids. Sometimes, he just enjoyed watching his children at play, quiedy reveling over the young miracles that he had produced in his own image.
<name>David</name>	David	Waverly	As he climbed into his Lexus, [MASK] scolded himself for staying as long as he had. He was giving the girl mixed signals. He hoped she didn’t call him again. If she did, he would befriend her from a distance, and that was it.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Becker	“I’ll be one of those lawyers who dies keeled over a brief.” [MASK]’s face turned serious. “I think it’s time for you to start thinking about a suitable successor. And when you do, can I assume that my name is at the top of your list?”
<name>Kim</name>	Kim	Angela	“No way,” [MASK] laughed. “I don’t think I’m judge material.” “I disagree. We need sharp young lawyers like you on the bench. And needless to say, the federal courts could certainly use some diversity.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jon	[MASK] could feel his heart beating at double its normal pace. “We’re going for a ride,” the man said, opening the back door and positioning himself behind the driver’s seat. “Make a right out of the lot and just keep driving.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Wrigley	He glanced around to confirm that no one could overhear the conversation. “You lied to me,” [MASK] roared. “You said your wife died of cancer. Have you seen the papers? We don’t need this crap!”
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Angela	She squirmed away and climbed on top of him, sitting up. “I don’t have any tattoos, but I was thinking about putting your name right here.” [MASK] pointed to her left breast. “You always got jokes this early in the morning?”
<name>him</name>	him	Cornell	“And I know I shouldn’t say this, but I’m glad that asshole is dead. If you hadn’t been driving my car last night, you wouldn’t have had my gun to protect yourself, and you’d probably be the one dead, not [MASK].”
<name>Shug</name>	Shug	Dang	“[MASK], you look good, girl.” “Thank you, sir. And you’re looking pretty nice yourself. Is that a new shirt?” Actually, it was, but she wasn’t supposed to know that. “Uh, naw.
<name>she</name>	she	Dre	At least not one that would be acceptable to her. “You probably can’t tell,” [MASK] said, “but I’ve always been a little hardcore.” “Oh, so your life of crime was genetic. Is that what you’re telling me?”
<name>She</name>	She	Claire	“Unfortunately, no. [MASK] didn’t want to get their hopes up, so she never told them she was even considering it. Anyway, I thought you said your plan was failsafe. Sounds like you’re planning on someone pointing the finger at us.”
<name>she</name>	she	Angela	When [MASK] read his note, it only enraged her. There’s no excuse for my behavior. I guess I just lost it. Sorry. If you’ll forgive me, I’ll FORGIVE YOU. LET’S PUT ALL THIS BEHIND US. CALL ME.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Jon	“I think we could be close to figuring out who killed [MASK].” “I’m afraid your task force is probably at the top of his list. The viatical investigations in the other states already have enough evidence for indictments.
<name>Olivia</name>	Olivia	Jada	He was obviously upset that she hadn’t confided in him. [MASK] spun her around and hugged her. “Have you forgotten about all those domestic abuse cases you handled when you were a D.A.? If a man hits you once, he’ll hit you again.
<name>Dr. Lecter</name>	Dr. Lecter	Zack	“And she probably did. The asshole could convince her to do anything.” [MASK] rested an elbow on the small table. “May I ask why you seem to have such animosity for your stepfather?” “Because he’s an asshole.”
<name>The speaker</name>	The speaker	Angela	I knew one of the detectives. I think he cut me some slack. But I’m going to have to tell my story eventually.” “Well, you’re going to tell them that I pulled the trigger.” [MASK] was dizzy with confusion.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Waverly	It would be a shame if you got all mixed up with that stuff, too. I certainly wouldn’t want my daughter exposed to something like that.” “Neither would I.” [MASK] stood up, towering over his father-in-law.
<name>Casey</name>	Casey	Ashley	“[MASK]?” The woman acknowledged the greeting by walking over, but didn’t speak. She was dressed like a college student: faded blue jeans, white ducktail shirt, large red shoulder bag. She looked much younger than twenty-four.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Cornell	She hit redial and waited as the phone rang. “I’m so sorry,” she cried, as soon as she heard his voice. “You don’t have anything to be sorry about.” “I shot [MASK], but everybody thinks you did.”
<name>He</name>	He	Waverly	[MASK] flinched. “You okay?” she asked. “You look like you just saw a ghost.” He quickly tucked the newspaper underneath his arm. He leaned down to kiss her, glad to have a wife who never bothered with things like current affairs, politics or newspapers.
<name>he's</name>	he's	Angela	All of this stuff leads straight back to him and he can’t afford to let that happen. But if you’re dead, it would be easy to pin everything on you.” “So, you’re saying he back?” [MASK] asked.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Sophia	The screen door opened and [MASK] stepped onto the patio. “I have some errands to run,” she said. “Anything you need me to pick up while I’m out?” Yeah, a little privacy. “No,” he said curtly.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Randolph	[MASK] often called him for quotes on controversial Supreme Court decisions. He was one of only a handful of reporters who had his personal cell phone number. “Congrats on the new job.” “Thanks. What can I do for you?”
<name>He</name>	He	Erickson	I said I would think about giving it to you. I’ve changed my mind about that, too.” [MASK] wasn’t sure he could control his temper. “I understand that you want to ruin me, but what if somebody found it?
<name>someone</name>	someone	Britney	If she was undergoing radiation rather than chemo, that meant she had a good chance for survival. He always found it difficult to tell people that he couldn’t help them because they weren’t dying fast enough. He could not bring himself to say those words to [MASK].
<name>Adnan</name>	Adnan	Waverly	“All I want is for you to make sure I get a fair shot. I didn’t murder anybody. I need you to help me prove that.” “You need to call the DATs office.” [MASK] ignored the advice. “We need to talk.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Cornell	He shut the car door, slammed her against the hood, then back-handed her across the face. Blood splattered from her nose, spotting [MASK]’s grey suit. “You bitch! Who do you think you are?”
<name>he</name>	he	Becker	“Make sure your memo really pumps up your case. He’ll probably use it as a basis for deciding whether to shut it down permanendy.” “Is [MASK] meeting with anyone else while he’s here?”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Veronika	The men dumped her face down onto the bed, her arms still restrained behind her back. The big hand slipped from her mouth and [MASK]’s first cry escaped, but was quickly muted when a much heavier hand gripped the back of her neck and pressed her face into the comforter.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Britney	“I have to tell you something,” she said. “You can tell me later. We have to get out of here because—” “No, I have to tell you now!” [MASK] insisted. “Somebody just got shot downstairs!”
<name>John</name>	John	Dre	He was so excited that he’d probably blow the second he saw her naked. Five minutes later with no change in his condition, [MASK] gave in to the fact that his Johnson had a mind of its own.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Becker	“Don’t worry,” [MASK] said. “I don’t have a weapon, but I do have evidence that proves he’s a pedophile. I was about to hand you a DVD I have in my pocket.”
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Dre	Next, he held the base of the beaker underneath a stream of cold water, swirling it around, allowing a few drops of water to get inside. [MASK] watched with pride as the concoction hardened into a flat, solid cookie.
<name>The doctor</name>	The doctor	Waverly	If you’re not sure, we shouldn’t proceed. Have you discussed this with your family?” “No, I can’t seem to find the right time to bring it up.” [MASK] closed the folder. “I think you may want to do that.”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Billington	“I haven’t been notified that [MASK] died. How would you know that?” “You think I’m going to let you give that guy one hundred and fifty grand of my money and not keep track of him?”
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Angela	“If you’re asking me if I’m currently a drug dealer, the answer is no.” [MASK] folded her arms across her chest. “Currently? So, if I asked if you were previously a drug dealer, the answer would be different?”
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Sophia	His tone demanded privacy. “This isn’t easy for any of us,” she said. “I never said it was.” [MASK] seemed to be searching for more to say. Instead, she picked up his gardening gloves and headed into the house.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Erickson	There was absolutely no reason to think he wasn’t legit.” [MASK] rubbed his forehead. “Is there anything else?” “They think he’s involved in a scam to buy policies and kill off the clients before their time.” “What!”
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Dre	“You okay?” [MASK] gently took her upper arm and guided her down the last few steps. To her surprise, his touch sent a flutter of arousal through her body. “They should tell you how much this hurts before you go through the first class.”
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Billington	“We’ve gone over most of your information on the telephone and I have your application here. All we need to do now is—” “I’m not sure I understand how this all works,” [MASK] interrupted. “Can you explain it to me again?”
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Angela	Can you believe that?” There were two ways to look at that, [MASK] thought to herself. It was either the action of a guilty man or an innocent one. “That’s how I know he did it. He’s trying to shut me up.
<name>me</name> (since the speaker is referring to themselves)	me (since the speaker is referring to themselves)	Ashley	“Don’t you dare humor me! You read that story! Some prosecutor with a bug up his ass would love to further his career by putting me behind bars. Just tell me what evidence you have against [MASK] so I can get this thing over with.”
<name>the person</name>	the person	Vincent	He was about to repeat the same spiel [MASK] had given him, but stopped. Selling the insurance policies of dying people sounded too morbid. “It looks like this insurance investment business might be pretty lucrative, which means we should be able to buy our dream house sooner rather than later.”
<name>anyone</name>	anyone	Salina	Will you help me?” “Sure,” he said. “And, remember, this is just between us. Don’t tell [MASK] the information is for me and don’t bring anybody else in on this.” He wasn’t stupid.
<name>Becky</name>	Becky	Angela	You’ve been following me?” “No, not really. I happened to drive by your place one day and saw the two of you getting out of his car. A Volkswagen? C’mon, [MASK]. If you don’t want to be with me, fine.
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Waverly	Viatical brokers are like real estate brokers. Except they don’t sell homes, they sell hope.” [MASK] chuckled. “Now hope is something I could definitely use.” He was anxious to hear the get rich part. “So, how does the broker make money?”
<name>He</name>	He	Becker	“I told you I was only going to do it when you were out of town. And I wouldn’t be stupid enough to inject her with a drug like morphine. That’s what you’ve been thinking all this time? That I killed her?” [MASK] began to sweat.
<name>He</name>	He	Dre	He had a bad vibe about the girl. And when the vibe was this strong, it was usually right. [MASK] picked up his toothbrush, then suddenly set it on the sink and marched down the hallway to his bedroom.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Dre	She charged through the glass doors and trotted to her car. [MASK]’s decision to keep the car parked out front had been a smart move. She snatched open the door and retrieved the keys from underneath the floor mat.
<name>she</name>	she	Veronika	“It says here that your mother died in the hospital. From brain cancer.” “That’s not true,” [MASK] snapped, her response a little too sharp and a tad too loud. Yes, her mother had brain cancer, but she wasn’t on her deathbed.
<name>Rico</name>	Rico	Waverly	You don’t have anything to bargain with. Any deal I might be able to make would require you to lead the police to this Rico person, but you’ve never even met the guy-” [MASK] began to wonder if reaching out to her had been a mistake.
<name>had</name>	had	constandy	He wished his whack job of a father, who [MASK] told him he’d never be worth a damn, could see him shooting the bree2e with the President of the United States. This would’ve killed him. Not sclerosis of the liver.
<name>He</name>	He	Quincy	He wanted it to ring, but at the same time, he prayed that it would not. [MASK] had really screwed up this time. He checked the BlackBerry’s charge level for the third time, then glanced at the time display. Two more minutes.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Waverly	“Listen to me. This is serious. Whoever is killing my clients might come after you and your parents to get back at me. Do you understand me? You can’t stay in town.” [MASK] heard a soft cry of alarm.
<name>Cookie Monster</name>	Cookie Monster	Dre	Once the entire kilo had been converted into cookies, [MASK] cut them into pieces with a razorblade and put them into plastic bags after weighing them on a digital scale. A rock weighing .01 grams would sell for five dollars, .03 grams for ten dollars.
<name>the detective</name>	the detective	Waverly	“What does she look like?” he asked [MASK]. “Five-three, a hundred and ten pounds, late twenties with short sandy brown hair.” He paused. “And she’s white.”
<name>Wife</name>	Wife	Deidra	“[MASK]?” The timidity in his voice sounded foreign even to him. He should just demand that she come home. She had taken an oath to stick with him for better or worse, richer or poorer. She owed him loyalty more than anything else.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Erickson	We’re just going to speed the process along. Anyway, you haven’t heard my plan yet.” Plan? [MASK] was happy to know that he’d given it that much thought. “I’m listening.”
<name>Hank</name>	Hank	Erickson	Most men were not strong enough to control their sexual urges. He was not like most men. He was not some pervert. “C’mon back,” [MASK] said, leading them out to the backyard. “I was just relaxing outside.”
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Becker	[MASK] had never practiced criminal law, but his corporate clients often needed his assistance with criminal matters. A teenage son picked up for drunk driving. A wife with an unexplainable penchant for shoplifting. A domestic violence allegation that needed to be quietly erased from the books.
<name>Rachel</name>	Rachel	Dre	“The night she told him she was calling off the engagement.” “Why didn’t you tell me?” Anger flooded [MASK]’s face. “Because this is my problem and I want to handle it my way.” “You call this handling it?”
<name>Jackie</name>	Jackie	Dre	The other man had composed himself and started pummeling him with what felt like a steel pole. [MASK] let go of the gun as he fell back onto the hood of the car. He felt his trench coat being ripped open as three wads of cash wrapped in rubber bands, fell to the ground.
<name>she</name>	she	Waverly	“Did you already know this guy?” “Not really,” [MASK] said. “I met him at a conference.” “Somebody you don’t know offers you some get rich quick scheme and it didn’t raise any red flags?”
<name>She</name>	She	Angela	When they don’t, they find excuses to stay.” [MASK] started to say something, then reached for her purse instead. “I have something to show you.” She removed an envelope and handed it to him. “What’s this?”
<name>Jeffrey</name>	Jeffrey	Waverly	[MASK] tried to apply logic to his situation. If his clients really were being murdered, there was no way he could be linked to their deaths because he hadn’t killed anyone. In just a matter of months in the viatical business, he’d made over five hundred thousand dollars in commissions.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Angela	He made the effort and now he would walk away with both of his balls securely intact. “Let’s go make this special delivery. I’m not exacdy sure where the room is.” [MASK] pointed down the hallway. “It’s down there.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Claire	“I’ve never touched a child and I never would.” [MASK] laughed. “You’re amazing, but I guess that’s why you’re such an excellent lawyer. You see the truth as you want it to be, not as it is.”
<name>Tony</name>	Tony	Willie	It wasn’t like he didn’t have the smarts. But sometimes circumstances took you in a different direction. [MASK] walked into the reception area and embraced him warmly. He was a stocky, muscular guy with a friendly face.
<name>her</name>	her	Britney	He had to find a way to convince [MASK] that her life could be in danger. He thought about proceeding to her place anyway, but that would only freak her out. He drove toward home, racking his mind for a solution.
<name>She</name>	She	Angela	She had watched too many of her friends wait and hope until it was too late, then run off to adoption agencies or sperm banks and struggle as a single parent. [MASK] wanted nothing less than the traditional family unit. Two parents, two kids, a minivan and a vacation home.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name to fill in the [MASK] token.)	Unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name to fill in the [MASK] token.)	Victor	“So, how does the broker make money?” “The policies are purchased through a trust As soon as the parties sign on the dotted line, the broker gets ten percent of the face value of the policy, paid by the investor,” [MASK] explained.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Waverly	You should probably let me call him. He’s going to think something’s up if I don’t.” “So let him,” [MASK] said bitterly. He paced back and forth across the living room.
<name>Investor</name>	Investor	Waverly	Guilty people always claimed they were set up. But she was here, so she might as well hear his story. “And exactly who would want to set you up?” [MASK]’s eyes flicked around the room. “One of my investors.”
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Angela	“You need to slow up or you’ll miss the driveway.” This time, [MASK] didn’t bark at him. She slowed and made a right turn, which took them up a short incline to the entrance of the hotel.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Waverly	He gave the group leader brochures to pass around, took a seat and waited to be introduced. [MASK] looked across a narrow aisle to his left and saw an attractive young woman with sandy brown hair styled in a short, spiky cut.
<name>Officer</name>	Officer	Angela	[MASK] seemed to be listening and that encouraged him. “I spent most of my days sitting in a guard booth reading. One day, this dude from my old neighborhood came up to me. I knew he was cracked out. He asked to borrow ten dollars.
<name>Willy</name>	Willy	Billington	“[MASK] cashed that check before he died. There’s no way to get the money back.” “Then it looks like you’re going to have to give me my money out of your own pocket.”
<name>John</name>	John	Becker	Normally, [MASK] respected people who had principles and stood by them. These days, he didn’t come across many people who were willing to risk their careers for something they believed in. If this had been a different case, their actions would have been admirable.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Sheila	His son jumped into his arms before he was barely out of the car. “Hey, dude. Ready to go?” “Yep. Gotta go get my stuff.” [MASK] stepped out of her apartment, leaned over the railing and smiled seductively.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Ashley	If you weren’t family, he would’ve already sued you for defamation.” “He’s not my family,” she hissed. “Just back off, okay?” [MASK] laughed. “He murders my mother and then sends you over here to threaten me.
<name>Jennifer</name>	Jennifer	Angela	By the time the music stopped, [MASK] was huffing and puffing so hard she was sure she had sweated off at least ten pounds. When she climbed off the bike, every muscle in her body shrieked in unison.
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Angela	[MASK] blinked then used that precise moment to take a noisy sip of her drink. “Am I right?” “Maybe,” she said coyly. “What’s up then? If you’ve got the hots for me, why you marrying dude?”
<name>The protagonist</name>	The protagonist	Joanna	But it wouldn’t make sense to tire herself out. Though her doctor was constandy sugarcoating her prognosis, [MASK] knew the end was near. She had researched acute renal failure on the Internet. At least she could take comfort in the money sitting in her bank account.
<name>he</name>	he	Sophia	How are you?” “I’ve been better,” [MASK] said. “And you?” “As well as can be expected under the circumstances.” He cleared his throat and decided to skip the phony chitchat.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Angela	When she’d pulled into the parking structure earlier, she’d found herself excited about the prospect of seeing him. [MASK] chuckled and slapped the side of her thigh. “I assure you, there will still be plenty of meat left to spare.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Cornell	Maybe it was better to just keep him talking until another car entered the garage. She looked past him to where the woman had been, but saw no one. Where in the hell is the security guard? “C’mon,” [MASK] said.
<name>Janine</name>	Janine	Dre	The woman put a hand on her hip and tossed a handful of hair over her shoulder. “Oh, so you can hang out during the week, but I can’t?” “I asked you who’s taking care of my son?” [MASK] demanded.
<name>Goldman</name>	Goldman	Rico	Try the first name [MASK], too. Then I need to find out if a company called Goldman Investments, Inc., has any connection to Live Now, The Tustin , Group or any of its affiliated companies.”
<name>Olivia</name>	Olivia	Dre	[MASK] looked away. “Do you understand what I do for a living? I’m not just a lawyer, I’m a federal prosecutor. I can’t be dating a drug dealer.” “I just told you. I don’t deal anymore.”
<name>She</name>	She	Angela	“And I can see from the expression on your face that my friend must have quoted you correctly. You help me cut a deal and I guarantee you my witness will never surface.” [MASK] did not know how to respond. She needed to know everything his witness knew.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Angela	“Can’t say you look too great,” [MASK] joked, “but it looks like you’re going to make it.” She reached out and gave his right hand, the only body part that didn’t appear bruised, a gende pat.
