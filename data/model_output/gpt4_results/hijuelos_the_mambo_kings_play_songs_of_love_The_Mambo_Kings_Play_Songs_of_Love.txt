<name>Oscar</name>	Oscar	Cesar	One thing I have to say about my Uncle [MASK], there was very little he wouldn’t do for me in those days, and so he nodded, tried to push himself off the floor, got to his knees, had trouble balancing, and then fell backwards.
<name>Tytos</name>	Tytos	Pedro	He might have fathered a brood of loving sons, instead of a single daughter, to keep him company in his sunset years. And instead of all that pussy? He might have contented himself with a mistress or two in town, the way his father, [MASK], had.
<name>David</name>	David	Nestor	“Bitch! Whore!” She wept, and [MASK] stood on the corner, no longer wanting to continue his walk. He did not want to move away from her, and though they did not have much to say, they stood side by side, silently.
<name>daughter</name>	daughter	Papi	His voice tired and trying to explain the pains in his body and the pains in his heart. Then it was: “Well, I’m sorry we did not get the chance to see each other, [MASK].” “Yes, daughter.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Cesar	What could thirteen musicians plus a manager plus the union plus the IRS plus the equipment managers and drivers make if they were paid $500 for a weekend job? One of his biggest problems was that [MASK] had never agreed to sign an “exclusive management contract.”
<name>Cesar</name>	Cesar	Delorita	Or she sat beside him just to keep him company and in a few minutes found her undergarments pulled down to her knees, and her dress hitched up over her waist. She was always happy with him because during the act of love the younger Mambo King would say, “Te quiero, [MASK].
<name>Putin</name>	Putin	Batista	“Yes, he’s being beaten. You don’t see [MASK] leaving the country.” That’s what the official version was on the radio. And the only change he’d noticed at all was that there were more police and military personnel at the airport.
<name>Tio</name>	Tio	Uncle	His whole face was red and immense, his breathing heavy. “Que yo te quiero. I love you, nephew. You understand?” “Yes, [MASK], is that why you told me to come here?”
<name>Junior</name>	Junior	Eugenio	“Tell him it’s not good for him to be like that.” “I will.” On their way to these jobs he’d tell [MASK] to listen to his mother, to forget about the kids on the street.
<name>Nestor</name>	Nestor	Manny	And he wanted to get a nice new automobile. He had bought [MASK] the bassist’s used Oldsmobile for a few hundred dollars, and while it ran well, it was quite beat up from being used for all these Mambo King jobs.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Delores	He bought [MASK] and her sister drinks from the bar, wiped a bead of sweat from her brow with his lilac-scented handkerchief, and when she said, “I like to dance, but my feet get so sore,” he offered to rub her warm, nyloned soles.
<name>Elvis</name>	Elvis	Cesar	These girls weren’t sure if [MASK] was a star, but he certainly had taken to looking like one, wearing dark Italian sunglasses, a brilliant white ascot, and eight rings on his hands. And he’d sign these autographs as if it was the most natural thing in the world.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Nestor	He let out a sigh. “You go, and that will be the end of normalcy for us!” He was up out of the chair. “Do as you please, see if I care.” “But what is the big deal, [MASK]?
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Delores	He loved [MASK], loved his children—why, then, were things so wrong? He tore up most of his photographs of her, save for one, and this he kept hidden in a box thick with sheet music, stuck in the living room between a bass drum and a quinto.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Papi	“[MASK], I want you to come home.” He didn’t even answer that, just made a looping motion with his cigarette and said to the woman, “Now, can you see that? My own daughter’s giving me orders.
<name>Mathilde</name>	Mathilde	Maria	He sometimes felt so bad that he told himself, “If I had remained with [MASK], I would have found my happiness.” He would go over his romance again and again in his head, though it had ended years before.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Delores	When she came, her whole body shuddered in waves, as if the building was shaking. That was something nice to remember, something nice to look forward to. That, and some of the flan [MASK] said she was going to make for him.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Cesar	And he dropped a five-dollar bill on the counter, saying, “Give my friend here a drink.” Then he embraced [MASK] and made his way to his table: “Now don’t forget.” Thereafter, the two men were friendly again.
<name>Orpheus</name>	Orpheus	Cesar	Nothing like [MASK], who’d turn up in these brothels and spend the night among these women, entertaining them with his trembling, quivering baritone: he’d sing and they would cook for him and sometimes he would slip off into a room and take a woman to bed.)
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Eugenio	“Yes!” “[MASK], don’t be so cross with me. She was a dish, huh?” “She was a pretty woman, Uncle.” Then: “Are we going to be here for a long time, Uncle?”
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Nestor	And he gave her a little bottle of Chanel No. 5. It was perfume and a hat for his mother, and Italian wallets and Ronson lighters for his three brothers. And, yes, a bundle of recordings and some photographs of [MASK] and the family.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Nestor	I’m pregnant.” [MASK] took a deep breath, stared out into the middle of the living room, where sat a dolly and the black case of a bass American kit drum, blinked, sighed, and then said to her, “Are you sure?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Eugenio	“Why, hellllllo.” [MASK] was friendly to her, but once the introductions were over, his mood reverted and he sat by the window, thinking. The older he got, the more he picked up on his long-dead father’s temperament.
<name>Danny</name>	Danny	Nestor	Sounded as if there was a river rushing in the distance and the chaos of a hundred automobiles honking their horns all at once. Plus he hadn’t really remembered that the trumpet solo played by his dead brother [MASK] had been so long, it seemed to go on forever in the version he was now hearing.
<name>Dream</name>	Dream	Maria	“Dior mio, you’ve got to stop humiliating yourself this way.” (Then the voices went on until the last fading trumpet line of “Beautiful [MASK] of My Soul,” inhalation of a cigarette, sip of whiskey, and the record-player arm lifts up again.)
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Machito	“Men should stick together, boy, to avoid suffering. Friendship and a few drinks, that’s good. Friends. You know who was good to me? A good guy? Let me tell you, boy. [MASK].
<name>who</name>	who	Maria	“If you want a woman, treat her good sometimes, but don’t let her get too used to it. Let her know that you are the man. A little abuse never hurt a romance. Women like to know who’s the boss.” “But abuse [MASK]?
<name>Arturo</name>	Arturo	Cesar	And then he played all the others, and as he did he kept asking, “Are you sure you want to give these to me?” “They’re yours.” Then they just sat for a time and [MASK] asked, “And your senora?
<name>Enrique</name>	Enrique	Nestor	“But for now ... I don’t know.” But the truth was that hearing a melody, humming a song, thinking of a lyric reminded him of [MASK]. Never happy in life, his brother had died. Period. Punto, end of the cancion.
<name>She</name>	She	Luisa	But as soon as he stepped out into the street he became a different man. When other women walked by, he would look, his penis would get stiff in his trousers, and [MASK] would know it. Quickening her pace, she would march off and leave him behind.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Delores	The man smiled. A little later, he came over and respectfully asked [MASK] to dance. She’d already turned down a number of other requests, and she turned him down, too. “I just wanted to talk to you anyway. My name’s—
<name>Consuelo</name>	Consuelo	Papi	What the hell’s wrong with you, anyway?” Then it hit her all at once that she was about to lose her virginity in the worst way imaginable. With this pendejo! Oh, [MASK]! There was nothing she could do to avoid it.
<name>Europa</name>	Europa	Solitude	Like his older brother, who had slipped back, he was decked out in a white silk suit, flamingo-pink shirt, and sky-blue tie. He was playing the solo to his brother’s composition “[MASK].” “Isn’t he beautiful?”
<name>him</name>	him	Delorita	There were things you don’t understand about us, she used to tell [MASK]—but now she was starting to understand. Hadn’t he spent many nights away from their home, back when? Weeks would go by in which she would await an answer, never receiving one.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Lydia	There are a lot of wolves out there. Come on, let me buy you an ice cream, and then I want you and your children to meet someone.” He made a burning sound: “Psssssssh, my, but you look good, [MASK].”
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Delores	The night of the benefit he approached [MASK] at the table, hat in hand and heart brimming with respect. The fact that he stuttered when he spoke and that he averted his eyes, staring over her shoulder and up the stage, touched her.
<name>Estelle</name>	Estelle	Cesar	Everything on the menu was written in a florid script and had a French name, and many of the items cost as much as what he earned in a week at the meat-packing plant. “Order whatever you like,” [MASK] told everybody.
<name>Orpheus</name>	Orpheus	Lydia	From the stage he watched [MASK] like that hound who watched the basement entrance of the building down the street. An old German shepherd with matty coat and milk-cornered eyes, barking at every passerby and sniffing between the legs of every canine interloper.
<name>Putin</name>	Putin	Castro	In those days it was a big subject with him. “I haven’t been back in twenty years. With [MASK] there now, I don’t think I’ll ever get back.” “And you have family there?” “Some.
<name>Alonso</name>	Alonso	Cesar	Circling around the arcade, [MASK] followed this woman, who avoided him coyly, as if they were playing a game, disappearing among the columns. He would turn up at her solar in the afternoons when her husband was working.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Lucy	“We’ll see, [MASK].” And shaking his head, he started speaking rapidly in Spanish to the brothers: “Si ustedes supieran las cosas que tengo que aguan-tarme todos los dtas! Dios mio! Me vuelvo loco con estas americanas!
<name>Arturo</name>	Arturo	Cesar	When he was not with her he was miserable, and after playing these jobs he would rush out to meet her. For his part, [MASK] was curious about this Beautiful Maria who had taken his maudlin, quiet brother and made him happy.
<name>Yuri</name>	Yuri	Cesar	A tingle went through her body, because when [MASK] said “job” he pronounced it “yob,” just like that Ricky Ricardo fellow. She smiled and let him into the chaos of her living room, which smelled of mildewy rugs, beer, and cabbage.
<name>Estrella</name>	Estrella	Maria	As the blades churned he would pass the time staring at the whipping entrails—intestines, stomachs, backbones, brains—as if at a sunny garden. The crush of bones, the whirring of machines, memories, music, and his dreams of [MASK].
<name>Rose</name>	Rose	Raul	“My own mother, [MASK], listen to me. My own mother was always giving money to the poor, even when we didn’t have very much. What more could anyone ask?” Sometime later in the nigbt in the Hotel Splendour 261 “More.”
<name>Chano</name>	Chano	Nestor	The glint of old and new record spines in the cabinet, the half bottle of Bacardi rum, his black instrument case, all communicating love. He kept a little Cuban flag on the television and in the comer of the room a little cabinet dedicated to the memory of [MASK].
<name>Arturo</name>	Arturo	Victor	“Look here, [MASK], you want to know how I feel about this business? It’s just that I’d rather go out like a man, rather than slowly rotting away like a piece of old fruit, like those viejitos I see in the drugstores.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Nestor	And it was [MASK], as if she had wished him there. He took her over to the bar, drank down a glass of whiskey, and said, “We have to play one more set, and then afterwards we’re going out, around three o’clock or so, to get something to eat.
<name>She</name>	She	Amaz	The maid brought in our sandwiches, nice thick roast beef, lettuce, and tomato, and mustard, on rye bread, and the beers. We ate quietly. Every now and then, [MASK] would look up at me through heavy-lidded eyes and smile.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Cesar	After a while [MASK] and his friends got used to the camera, but not to the fact that a woman was giving the orders. She was tall, with a great head of hair and fierce-looking, intelligent eyes.
<name>the baby</name>	the baby	Eugenio	But something got to him: the utter helplessness of the baby, its crying for attention, its need for care. Holding [MASK] in his arms and examining the fresh veins under the scalp of his soft pink and sweet-smelling head, he was frightened by all the things that might go wrong.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Perez	“We shouldn’t lose more time in our friendship. Life is too short.” They talked: [MASK] had just gotten over a heart attack, and in the flush of appreciation for finding more time in this world, he had apparently turned into a more magnanimous soul.
<name>father</name>	father	Papi	You and I were together for a month before they found us out, kissing in the parks and behind bushes, two happy children, and then your [MASK], a judge and highly placed in the Gal-lego Club, found out through gossip, and they sent you away to live with your aunt.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Cesar	He walked around his neighborhood for hours and then finally climbed the stairs to the solar which he had been sharing with his older brother, [MASK]. He found him cooking some pork chops over a little stove they had there. He was in his T-shirt and boxer shorts, and looked somber.
<name>Byron</name>	Byron	June	“I said that I would help you, my friend.” By [MASK] he had assumed the ownership of the Shamrock and its ice machines, meat freezer, meat grinder, horseshoe bar, lunch counter, jukebox, tables and chairs, cash register, speckled mirror and bar stools.
<name>Celina</name>	Celina	Genebria	When they turned into the farm road, he saw his mother for the first time in many years. She was on the porch of their simple, tin-roofed house, conversing with [MASK], the woman who’d wet-nursed the Mambo King.
<name>Antonio</name>	Antonio	Georgie	Packs of wild hounds barked and howled their joy. Then they spilled into their friend [MASK]’s little house, with its pink and light blue walls, and rolled around on the floor, laughing and kissing their new lady companions. The men were having such a good time they hardly slept.
<name>Maria</name>	Maria	Frankie	There had been a young Puerto Rican nurse who had seemed like a bitch at first, never smiling at him or even saying hello, but then he softened her up with compliments, and in the days when he seemed to be getting better told [MASK] to buy her a bouquet of flowers.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Cesar	[MASK] had a picture from one of those nights, tucked in the *Puff of smoke, a swallow of whiskey, the sensation that something was pinching the small of his back, something with razorlike claws, making its way along the mysterious passages of his kidneys and liver . . .
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Nestor	“She said that I was her true love but . . “[MASK], stop it. Where are your balls, man? You’re better off without her.” “Yes, better off.” And what happened?
<name>Aureliano</name>	Aureliano	Nestor	She was cooking up a pot of chicken and rice on the white enamel stove with animal feet, and then, ladle in hand, she stuck out her rump, pulled up her dress, and said, “Come on, [MASK].”
<name>Alfred</name>	Alfred	Amaz	But then for a moment [MASK] looked off, as if at the corner of the stage-ceiling molding, momentary exhaustion and a slight weariness in his eyes. “. . . But this life is always so much work, though.” And he exhaled.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Eugenio	and they spent hours running back and forth on the rooftop, laughing and watching it rise high into the wind, its balsa cross-beams bending and the paper fluttering in the air. He stood by the edge of the roof with [MASK] in his arms.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Luisa	He was the handsome young crooner at the end of the table, reveling in the friendship of this older man, guzzling Spanish brandy all night and feeling light-headed enough to easily fall in love. And there she was, [MASK].
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Eduardo	When his mother had died in 1962, the news came in a telegram from [MASK], and a funny thing, too, because he had been thinking about her a lot that week, almost a soft pulsing in his heart, and his head filled with memories.
<name>Lucia</name>	Lucia	Hombre	He won’t even let me go out on the street unless he’s with me in the wheelchair.” Then: “[MASK]...” and she undid the front buttons of her dress, from her neck to the hem of her skirt, and spread it open.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Poppy	She then served the brothers their coffee. When I thought, [MASK], my father looked up at me and smiled sadly. “I’m so happy to see you again.” “And, son, I’m happy to see you.”
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Pablo	[MASK]’s wife would cook breakfast, fried chorizos and eggs, and then iron their clothes. She sighed a lot, but immediately after sighing, she smiled, a statement of fortitude; her plump, dimpled face highlighted by long, long eyelashes whose shadows were like the hands of a clock.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Maria	And yet, when he saw [MASK], he pictured her in a room, and in that room a doorway through which could be seen the sickbed of his youth and himself, unable to move, calling out, “Mamd/” and waiting, waiting.
<name>Marta</name>	Marta	Daniel	[MASK] was forty and did not speak English, and that made finding a job difficult, manpower shortage or not. Each evening she waited for him by the window, listened for his footsteps in the hall. For three months he looked for work without success.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Cesar	The band’s morale was low: it wasn’t a question of finding a replacement trumpet player—there were a hundred trumpet players who could have played the same lines and solos—but his brother’s absence just took [MASK]’s spirit out of everything.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Lydia	By then, he’d tried calling her a dozen times without getting a response, and he fantasized that she was cuckolding him. He said to himself, I don’t need anything from a woman. Around one o’clock, [MASK] called him.
<name>Yemayá</name>	Yemayá	Chango	He lorded over them with his music and made them sing, “Caaaaacccckkkaka.” He’d made his own guitar out of plywood, wire, and nails, and it looked like a Dominican harp. But he knew how to play, knew magic, knew the chants to [MASK].
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Marfa	Without a good word for anyone, he would head out to the tub in the back yard, where he would soak in a bath to which [MASK] had added a rose-scented lotion, with an alcohol base, that only made his condition worse.
<name>He</name>	He	Amaz	Do you ride horses?” “No.” “A shame.” He winced, straightening up his back. “Do me a favor, boy, and give me a hand up.” [MASK] reached out and I pulled him to his feet.
<name>Ed</name>	Ed	Arnaz	Or perhaps they’d simply met [MASK], who liked their music and, approaching them at the bar, said, “Would you fellows like to be on the show?” All business, with the fatigue of responsibility showing on his face.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Luisa	Now as he sat in the Hotel Splendour his life with [MASK] fluttered like a black moth through his heart. He felt a great sadness, recalling how in his youth he had never believed that love really existed—for him.
<name>father</name>	father	Papi	His [MASK] was so tense that he suffered from a plague of maladies that had to do with his bad moods, debts, and hard work. He sometimes suffered from a hysterical eczema and prurigo that so dried his skin it became as hard and brittle as parchment.
<name>Mrs. Hudson</name>	Mrs. Hudson	Carmen	“[MASK]’s taken it upstairs. She said she didn’t think the heat would be good for it.” Then the cook, in a long, sauce-stained apron, pointed out to a back door that opened into a yard.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Delores	The idea of this beautiful dream of their love cracking open because of jealousy would send her into despair. She would take to her books and maintain her silence. For three months this had kept the peace. At twenty-seven, [MASK] was still an attractive woman.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Pablo	When he finished emptying the first bottle, he opened a second and filled up his glass. Then he sat back, enjoying the music, a little number called “A Woman’s Tears,” an earnest ballad written out on the fire escape of [MASK]’s apartment during the old days.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Bobo	“I sometimes feel like a ghost, tit sabes, as if I’m not really part of this world.” “No! [MASK]! You’re very much a part of this world.” Then they went to sit on a nice grassy hill.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Nestor	It’s perfect. It’s a great song, brother.” And he slapped him on the back. “Now enjoy your peace.” But [MASK] didn’t enjoy anything, brooding constantly like a ruined poet or an old man.
<name>Arturo</name>	Arturo	Pedro	You must be tolerant of him. Forgive your father. He loves you, nino. His heart is made of gold. Never forget that he is your father. Never forget that he is your blood.” No softness in [MASK]’s face, no kindness, no compassion.
<name>Maria</name>	Maria	Maria	The next day, he went to [MASK]’s house and she was not there, and he went there the next day and she was not there, and then he went to the Havana Hilton and she was not there. What if something had happened to her?
<name>Jimmy</name>	Jimmy	Eugenio	And still during this time he attended to his work in the building, though now he had the luxury of hiring friends to perform certain jobs for him. He paid [MASK], who had washed out as a musician, to take care of things.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mariela	And how did she have the right to deprive his baby of her father? Hadn’t she watched him with [MASK]? Seen how the baby cooed and fell happily asleep in his arms . . . Hadn’t he told her about the rough circumstances of his upbringing?
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Cesar	The family gripped their seats, but [MASK] laughed and whistled. Sparks sometimes flew from the friction of hubcaps hitting the highway curb. He drove into a state park, where the forest’s noble pine trees towered over them.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Delores	he kicked swiftly and with Herculean effort made his way toward the shore. Wrapping a towel around him, [MASK] covered his shivering body with her own. A chill wind had started to blow across the lake surface, and the greenish water, as if filled by shadows, darkened into black.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Delores	“Thank you, [MASK].” And when he saw his nephew sitting nearby, he called the boy over—well, he was a man, wasn’t he?—grabbed him by the shoulder and squeezed. “Well, you glad I’m okay?
<name>I</name>	I	Ido	Then this, in a frame: I come here because I do not know when tbe Master will return. I pray because [MASK] not know when tbe Master will want me to pray. I look into tbe light of heaven because I do not know when tbe Master will take tbe light away.
<name>Cesar</name>	Cesar	Eugenio	“Are you sure?” “Yes, hombre! Come on,” said another of the musicians. But he kept to the bongos. And just then the Mambo King thought that [MASK] was even more reserved than his father, his poor father.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Cesar	“You know, [MASK], if you don’t want to go through the grind of an orchestra again, maybe we could do something on the other end, like put together a supper club. A quiet place, not so much for a younger wild crowd but for people our age.
<name>Enrique</name>	Enrique	Genebria	[MASK], whose breast had tasted like cinnamon and salt, would bring the boiled water, and this water, tinged pink and yellow and blue by the sunlight, would drip down over his head and onto his privates, what a pleasure that was, looking up into the attentive and loving eyes of his mother.
<name>Enrique</name>	Enrique	Cesar	And [MASK] remembered hearing her voice as she’d wash his hair in a metal tub in the back yard, the sunlight breaking up the flowing water into pink- and red-tinged sprays, and the wonderful sensation of her hands moving over the back of his neck and through his hair.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Nestor	[MASK] slapping his older brother’s then-troubled back. He’d work in the little kitchen behind the bar, making crustless ham sandwiches, and drinks. He whistled, he smiled, he sang happily. He’d look out across the dining room through open French doors to the patio and garden.
<name>Desperado</name>	Desperado	Babalu	“Why not”—and he placed the guitar on his lap and strummed a C-minor chord, flailing his hand quickly over the strings so that its soundbox vibrated like the wind hitting a shutter, and began to sing one of his biggest hits, “[MASK]. ”
<name>Cuban</name>	Cuban	Cuban	It goes all the way up.” They stood for a few minutes in silence, and then he asked her, “Are you [MASK]? j Tu eres cubana?" “Oh, yes, I am.” “I knew it.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Vivian	I was insatiable as a young man, [MASK], insatiable, and that’s why my fingers would crawl through your defenses until you had no choice but to turn red in the face and run home to your family, but I loved you, understand? ...
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Cesar	But even back then, he knew that something was wrong, because of the way people looked at him. The old Irishman with the strawberry-red chin who always tipped his crooked gray hat looked the other way when [MASK] passed by.
