<name>Mildred</name>	Mildred	Harpo	There she’ll be, as usual, in the Sunday magazine section—only dead! I must turn back before I have this ridiculous suicide forever on my conscience! I should have telephoned [MASK]! I didn’t even think of it—just ran for my life.
<name>MacGuffin</name>	MacGuffin	Portnoy	Will that shake them up too much out in the waiting room? Because that’s maybe what I need most of all, to howl. A pure howl, without any more words between me and it! “This is the police speaking. You’re surrounded, [MASK].
<name>Solomon</name>	Solomon	Anne	That’s it, take a nice piece of real Jewish rye, now take a big fork full of the real Jewish chopped liver”—and on and on, right down to the jello—“that’s right, [MASK], the jello is kosher too, sure, of course, has to be—
<name>Marvelous</name>	Marvelous	Ami	“The indifferent beak! I just understood more poem!... Didn’t I?” “Christ, you are a marvelous girl!” That took her breath away. “Oh, am I?” “Yes!” “[MASK]?” “Yes!
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alex	Because his breakfast consists of, do you know what? The most important meal of the day—not according just to your mother, [MASK], but according to the highest nutritionists—and do you know what that child eats?” “A doughnut.”
<name>Sheldon</name>	Sheldon	Kay	Everything I see, taste, touch, I think, “Goyish!” My first morning I squeeze half an inch of Pepsodent down the drain rather than put my brush where [MASK]’s mother or father may have touched the bristles with which they cleanse their own goyische molars.
<name>Ignatius</name>	Ignatius	Alex	No, it’ll be more ghastly than that: she’s going to telephone the Mayor! And that’s why I’m running! But she wouldn’t. But she would. She will! More than likely already has. Remember? I’ll expose you, [MASK].
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Kay	“I just don’t want to see you any more, [MASK]. I can’t hide my feelings. I’m sorry.” She wept pitifully: she carried around the campus terrible little pouches underneath her bloodshot blue eyes, she didn’t show up for meals, she missed classes . . .
<name>Susan</name>	Susan	Lina	But that doesn’t mean I want to!” And then, Doctor, she began to berate me about [MASK]’s tits, how I hadn’t played with them enough. “All you ever talk about and think about is tits! Other people’s tits!
<name>Yvonne</name>	Yvonne	Arnold	Inside the restaurant the best I could do was say that I wanted her to come with me to the Mayor’s formal dinner party. “[MASK], let’s have an affair, okay?” “—Meaning?” “Oh, don’t be cautious.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Miltaleh	Ha ha! You did it, [MASK], and without even lifting a finger! Of course! Let the shikse do the killing for you! You, you’re just an innocent bystander! Caught in the crossfire!
<name>Steeply</name>	Steeply	Bubbles	Only, reclining as I am, the jet leaves my joint on the horizontal, rides back the length of my torso, and lands with a thick wet burning splash right in my own eye. “Son of a bitch kike!” [MASK] screams.
<name>Susie</name>	Susie	Toby	Your little cousin [MASK] can sit down at the piano and play whatever song you can name. All she has to do is sit at the piano and play ‘Tea for Two’ and everybody in the room is her friend.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Alex	“I’m not interested, [MASK], in what’s growing up inside there, not at dinner.” “But it’s too big." “What? What’s too big?” says my father. “My nose!” I scream.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Alex	The utter incomprehensibility of the situation causes her eyes to become heavy with tears. “[MASK], why are you getting like this, give me some clue? Tell me please what horrible things we have done to you all our lives that this should be our reward?”
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Alex	How could he enjoy triumph, when he so despised the triumphant—and probably the very idea. “They worship a Jew, do you know that, [MASK]? Their whole big-deal religion is based on worshiping someone who was an established Jew at that time.
<name>Alfie</name>	Alfie	Max	Being with such a person is for me all wrongI Mean-ing-less! A waste of everybody’s energy and character and time!” “Okay,” says The Monkey in the taxi, “what’s bugging you, [MASK]?” “Nothing.”
<name>Nora</name>	Nora	Alex	I can spot the whispering coming a mile away. We are about to discuss my father’s headaches. “[MASK], he didn’t have a headache on him today that he could hardly see straight from it?” She checks, is he out of earshot?
<name>Stevie</name>	Stevie	WABC	Only an hour into the trip, she found [MASK] and began to move in her seat to the rock music. Then all at once she said, “Ah, fuck that noise,” and switched the radio off.
<name>Leopold</name>	Leopold	Zoom	[MASK], he’s dressed, and in his hat and coat, and with his big black collection book in one hand he bolts his stewed prunes and his bran flakes standing up, and fills a pocket with a handful of dried fruits that would bring on in an ordinary human being something resembling dysentery.
<name>Severin</name>	Severin	Breakie	Oh, [MASK], darling, eat me,” she cries, thrusting a handful of fingers into my mouth—and she pulls me down upon her by my lower jaw, crying, “Oh, eat my educated cunt!” Idyllic, no?
<name>Roark</name>	Roark	Smolka	So [MASK] goes back in for a second conference, and returns nearly half an hour later with the news that the girl has changed her mind: she will jerk off one guy, but only with his pants on, and that’s all.
<name>me</name>	me	Mommy	In the meantime, it is afternoon, it is spring, and for me and me alone a woman is rolling on her stockings and singing a song of love. Who is going to stay with [MASK] forever and ever? Me.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Sarah	“I will, 111 choke—” “[MASK], the best safeguard against asphyxiation is breathing. Just breathe, and that’s all there is to it. More or less.” God bless her, she tried. But came up gagging.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Freud	Oh, [MASK], do I know! This one has a nice ass, but she talks too much. On the other hand, this one here doesn’t talk at all, at least not so that she makes any sense—but, boy, can she suck!
<name>Portnoy</name>	Portnoy	Naomi	Self-deprecation—and self-defecation too! Whining, hysteria, compromise, confusion, disease! Yes, [MASK], I am soiled, oh, I am impure—and also pretty fucking tired, my dear, of never being quite good enough for The Chosen People!
<name>Janet</name>	Janet	Hannah	She’s not even supposed to eat chocolate pudding. Yeah, that’s why I took it! Tough shit, [MASK], it’s what the doctor ordered, not me. I can’t help it if you’re fat and “sluggish” and I’m skinny and brilliant.
<name>God</name>	God	Sophie	But is that me—or my father hollering out his defense before the jury? Sure, that’s him —he did it, okay, okay, [MASK], leave me alone already, I did it, but I didn’t mean it!
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Lina	She moves across to [MASK], above whom she towers (oh God, isn’t she enough? isn’t she really sufficient for my needs? how many cocks have I got?), and puts her hand between the whore’s legs.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alex	Not, she says, if I know what is good for me. “There are plenty of good things to eat in the world, [MASK], without eating a thing like a lobster and running the risk of having paralyzed hands for the rest of your life.”
<name>Sturdiness</name>	Sturdiness	Rooted	Oh, perfectly ill-proportioned girl! No mile-long mannequin you! So she had no tits, so what? Slight as a butterfly through the rib cage and neck, but planted like a bear beneath! [MASK], that’s what I’m getting at!
<name>Janice</name>	Janice	Sally	What [MASK] couldn’t do was eat me. To shoot a gun at a little quack-quack is fine, to suck my cock is beyond her. She was sorry, she said, if I was going to take it so hard, but it was just something she didn’t care to try.
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Alex	It’s something I’ve known for a little while now. “You’re the ignorant one! You!” “[MASK]!” cries my sister, grabbing for my hand, as though fearful I may actually raise it against him. “But he is!
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	Breakie	Is this coherent?” «ri » Sure. “Because that’s what I really want to be: so coherent. Oh, [MASK], I adore you. Now, anyway. Hey,” she whispered, “want to smell something—something staggering?”
<name>Sal</name>	Sal	Mandel	We flip a coin—and I win the right to get the syph! [MASK] claims the coin grazed the ceiling, and is ready to murder me—he is still screaming foul play when I enter the living room to reap my reward.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	inherently!”—yes	Because I know that inherently—do you understand, [MASK], I understand! English happens, oddly enough, to be my mother tongue!—“inherently the system in which I participate (and voluntarily, that is crucial too—voluntarily!), that that system is humane and just.
<name>Augie</name>	Augie	Mandel	“She called me a kike!” I answer self-righteously. “I thought I was blind. Look, she’s anti-Semitic, Ba-ba-lu.” “Yeah, what do I give a shit?” says [MASK].
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Bubbles	Unfortunately, however, I get just about where I want to be when [MASK]’ workday comes to an end. “Okay, that’s it,” she says, “fifty,” and stops! “No!” I cry. “More!”
<name>Sheldon</name>	Sheldon	Milt	Of course! Let the shikse do the killing for you! You, you’re just an innocent bystander! Caught in the crossfire! A victim, right, [MASK]? Lovely, isn’t it, the business of the bed?
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Hannah	Simultaneously with the tears she is screaming so loud at him that her veins stand out—and screaming at me, too, because, looking further into this thing, I find that while [MASK] hides behind my mother, I take refuge behind the culprit him- self.
<name>Alexander</name>	Alexander	Alex	Walk natural, will you! Stop favoring that Oscar Shattered leg, [MASK], or you are going to wind up a cripple for the rest of your days!” For skating after shikses, under an alias, I would be a cripple for the rest of my days.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alex	“I—I just don’t do that, that’s all.” “But that brings us back to why. Why?” “[MASK], I can’t. I just can’t.” “Give me a single good reason!”
<name>Algie</name>	Algie	Alex	Why is your throat red? Do you have a headache you’re not telling me about? You’re not going to any baseball game, [MASK], until I see you move your neck. Is your neck stiff? Then why are you moving it that way?
<name>Rumpole</name>	Rumpole	Doctor	And, [MASK], Your Honor, whatever your name is—it seems to make no difference how much the poor bastard actually gets, for he is dreaming about tomorrow’s pussy even while pumping away at today’s! Do I exaggerate?
<name>Doctor</name>	Doctor	Breakie	Sometimes he coughs, sometimes he grunts, sometimes he belches, once in a while he farts, whether voluntarily or not who knows, though I hold that a fart has to be interpreted as a negative transference reaction on his part. “[MASK], you're so brilliant!”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Thanksgiving	Who the fuck are they, I’ll ask, to think they own [MASK]! Then at the railroad station her father says, “How do you do, young man?” and I of course answer, “Thank you.” Why is he acting so nice?
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Lina	She sat down on the edge of the bed, her little features smaller than I had ever seen them, and declining an invitation to participate, silently watched until I had had my orgasm and [MASK] had finished faking hers.
<name>David</name>	David	Heshie	I watched from behind a shade in the living room, as the rabbi strode impressively up the front stoop in his big black coat. He had given [MASK] his bar mitzvah lessons, and I trembled to think that one day he would give me mine.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Heroine	You really like victory, don’t you, honey? Know how to take it in your stride! Wow, are you guiltless! Terrific, really—an honor to have met you. Look, take me with you, [MASK]! Up to the mountain.
<name>Freud</name>	Freud	Freud	So I have desires—only they’re endless. Endless! And that, that may not be such a blessing, taking for the moment a psychoanalytic point of view . .. But then all the unconscious can do anyway, so [MASK] tells us, is want.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Bubbles	This is what I have been imagining for myself . . . Which is how it occurs to me what to do. I will forget that the fist tearing away at me belongs to [MASK]—I’ll pretend it’s my own!
<name>son</name>	son	Alex	From my bed I hear her babbling about her problems to the women around the mah-jongg game: My [MASK] is suddenly such a bad eater 1 have to stand over him with a knife. And none of them apparently finds this tactic of hers at all excessive.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Hannah	[MASK] tells me what you’re doing, so don’t think I don’t know.” She’s missed the underpants! I’ve been caught! Oh, let me be dead! I’d just as soon! “Yeah, what do I do ... ?”
<name>Ignatius</name>	Ignatius	Schmuck	Should I just take hold of it and begin to wash, or should I maybe run a little water over it first, just to be safe. But safe from what? [MASK], maybe you want to get a piece of soap to wash the soap with!
<name>Trichotillomania</name>	Trichotillomania	Kenneth	“How unlike my model friend,” I think, “with the wigs and the hairpieces, and the hours spent at [MASK]’s. How my life would change! A new man!—with this woman!” Her plan for herself was to camp out at night in a sleeping bag.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Ronald	Followed by, “You couldn’t look for a boy more in love with his mother than [MASK]!” I swear to you, this is not bullshit or a screen memory, these are the very words these women use.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Pig	“OH, YOU SON OF A BITCH!” Well, why, damn it, can’t I have some fun! Why is the smallest thing I do for pleasure immediately illicit—while the rest of the world rolls laughing in the mud! [MASK]?
<name>Estelle</name>	Estelle	Heroine	Yes, stay! Buy a pair of those khaki short pants—become a man!” “Do as you wish,” she said. “I am leaving you.” “No, [MASK], no,” I cried—for I was actually begin-
<name>Sheldon</name>	Sheldon	Alex	“Oh, don’t you shout at me, [MASK]. I’m not the one who gave you diarrhea, I assure you. If all you ate was what you were fed at home, you wouldn’t be running to the bathroom fifty times a day.
<name>Yossi</name>	Yossi	Heshie	“Over an hour of his time,” they all said later, as though that alone should have changed [MASK]’s mind. But no sooner did the rabbi depart than the flakes of plaster began falling once again from the ceiling overhead.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Kay	I was, fortunately, so astonished by my indignation that I couldn’t begin to voice it. How could I be feeling a wound in a place where I was not even vulnerable? What did [MASK] and I care less about than one, money, and two, religion?
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	mel	A talent for frankness, yes—for reason, no!” “Then leave [MASK] You’ve got what you wanted! Leave!” “Maybe I will!” “To you I’m just another her, anyway!
<name>Asimov</name>	Asimov	Alex”—she	Is that not true, too? Because your system is basically exploitive, inherently debasing and unjust. Consequently, [MASK] used my name as a stem teacher would, there was the thrust of admonition in it—“there can never be anything resembling genuine equality in such an environment.
<name>Humbert</name>	Humbert	Mommy	Who does [MASK] love more than anything in the whole wide world? I am absolutely punchy with delight, and meanwhile follow in their tight, slow, agonizingly delicious journey up her legs the transparent stockings that give her flesh a hue of stirring dimensions.
<name>Orin</name>	Orin	Mandel	“—right in the”—erupts [MASK], and folds in half onto the floor, beating at the linoleum with his fists—“right in the fuck- mg— “Water, you shits, I’m going blind! I’m on fire!”
<name>Sheldon</name>	Sheldon	Alex	Subsequently she was over the toilet all night throwing up. “My kishkas came out from that thing! Some practical joker! That’s why to this day I tell you, [MASK], never to commit a practical joke—because the consequences can be tragic!
<name>Mother</name>	Mother	Mommy	“Will you leave me, my baby-boy, will you ever leave [MASK]?” Never, I would answer, never, never, never . . . And yet now that she is hollowed out, I cannot even look her in the eye!
<name>Lo</name>	Lo	Morty	imagine what would have been had I been caught red-handed! imagine if I had gone ahead and come all over that sleeping shikses golden arm!) and then for dinner [MASK] had ordered me a lobster, the first of my life.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Bubbles	“Then stop holding it back on me.” “I’m not. I am trying, [MASK]—” “Cause I’m going to count to fifty, and if you don’t do it by then, that ain’t my fault.” Fifty?
<name>Alexander</name>	Alexander	Ronald	[MASK] Now, how’s that for good to the last drop? How’s that for a good boy, a thoughtful boy, a kind and courteous and well-behaved boy, a nice Jewish boy such as no one will ever have cause to be ashamed of?
<name>Goneril</name>	Goneril	Cordelia	When actually what we are playing in that house is some farce version of King Lear, with me in the role of [MASK]! On the phone she is perpetually telling whosoever isn’t listening on the other end about her biggest fault being that she’s too good.
<name>Rumpelstiltskin</name>	Rumpelstiltskin	Scrooge	But on it goes, my mother’s monologue. As other chil- dren hear the story of [MASK] every year, or are read to nightly from some favorite book, I am continually shtupped full of the suspense-filled chapters of her perilous life.
<name>Yale</name>	Yale	Hunter	You, who gave me that U.S.A. to read! you’re why I got that application blank to [MASK]! You’re why I’m killing myself to be something more than just somebody’s dumb and stupid piece of ass! And now you want to treat me like I’m nothing
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sophie	And did my mother oblige? Did [MASK] put together the two tits and the two legs and come up with four? Me it seems to have taken two and a half decades to do such steep calculation. Oh, I must be making this up, really.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Momma	and I just washed the kitchen floor!” “But, [MASK], he’s here to stay, he has to stay—he’s a seeing-eye dog. I’m blind.” “Oh my God!
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Alex	All she has to do is sit at the piano and play ‘Tea for Two’ and everybody in the room is her friend. She’ll never lack for companionship, [MASK], she’ll never lack for popularity.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Alex	[MASK], are you listening to me? I am offering you something that could change the rest of your life!” But what he had to offer I didn’t want—and what I wanted he didn’t have to offer. Yet how unusual is that?
<name>Portnoy</name>	Portnoy	Doc	What do you think, [MASK]? Has a restriction so pathetic been laid upon my object choice? Is it true that only if the sexual object fulfills for me the condition of being degraded, that sensual feeling can have free play? Listen, does that explain the preoccupation with shikses?
<name>Reuven</name>	Reuven	Alex	I assure you, [MASK], you are never going to hear such a mishegoss of mixed-up crap and disgusting nonsense as the Christian religion in your entire life. And that’s what these big shots, so-called, believe!”
<name>God</name>	God	Cod	[MASK] only knows what kind of disease I am going to pick up off those seats! “Go in anyway, fuck the disease,” says the maniac who speaks into the microphone of my jockey shorts, “don’t you understand what you’re going to see inside there?
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Alex	“[MASK], please,” my mother says, “it is a very worn rug.” “You’ll trip on that thing,” my father says, “and throw your knee out of whack, and then you’ll really be in trouble.”
<name>Archer</name>	Archer	Morty	[MASK] pulls back onto the highway, and right then and there I take my vow, I swear that I will dedicate my life to the righting of wrongs, to the elevation of the downtrodden and the underprivileged, to the liberation of the unjustly imprisoned.
<name>Radcliffe</name>	Radcliffe	Hunter	Not a word about her cunt, as far as I could tell. The next day she went off to [MASK], and that night, for a surprise, showed me the application blank she had gotten from the admissions office. Which I praised her for.
<name>McClane</name>	McClane	Blaze	“[MASK], you bastard cop, what do I give a shit? I tore the tag off my mattress—” “Two.” “—But at least while I lived, I lived big!" Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!!!
<name>Mother</name>	Mother	Momma	It’s a family joke that when I was a tiny child I turned from the window out of which I was watching a snowstorm, and hopefully asked, “[MASK], do we believe in winter?” Do you get what I’m saying?
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Alex	Yet how could I expect otherwise? Can I ask the impossible of my own mother? “[MASK], to pick up a phone is such a simple thing—how much longer will we be around to bother you anyway?”
<name>Portnoy</name>	Portnoy	Portnoy	I am afraid to open my mouth for fear that if I do no words will come out—or the wrong words. “[MASK], yes, it’s an old French name, a corruption of porte noir, meaning black door or gate.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Hannah	The way it usually works, my mother cries in the kitchen, my father cries in the living room—hiding his eyes behind the Newark News—[MASK] cries in the bathroom, and I cry on the run between our house and the pinball machine at the corner.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Pumpkin	Oh, [MASK]—baby, say it again, Why would I want to do a thing like that? Someone who knew who she was! Psychologically so intact as not to be in need of salvation or redemption by me! Not in need of conversion to my glorious faith!
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Alex	Did you eat French fries after school? Is that why you’re sick like this?” “Nuhhh, nuhhh.” “[MASK], are you in pain? Do you want me to call the doctor? Are you in pain, or aren’t you?
<name>Gregor</name>	Gregor	Alex	Caught! As good as dead! “Open up, [MASK]. I want you to open up this instant.” It’s locked. I’m not caught! And I see from what’s alive in my hand that I’m not quite dead yet either.
<name>Salinger</name>	Salinger	Markfield	The novelist, what’s his name, [MASK], has written in a story somewhere that until he was fourteen he believed “aggravation” to be a Jewish word. Well, this was what I thought about “tumult” and “bedlam,” two favorite nouns of my mother’s.
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Dorothy	Once [MASK] chanced to come back into the kitchen while my mother was still standing over the faucet marked H, sending torrents down upon the knife and fork that had passed between the schvartze’s thick pink lips. “Oh, you know how hard it is to get mayonnaise off silverware these days.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Alex	“Don’t ask what kind of day I had with him yesterday.” So I don’t. “[MASK],” sotto voce still, “when he has a day like that you don’t know what a difference a call from you would make.”
<name>Tiffany</name>	Tiffany	Korvette	Was she a call girl? A maniac? Was she in cahoots with some Puerto Rican pusher who was about to make his entrance into my life? Enter it—and end it, for the forty dollars in my wallet and a watch from [MASK]’s?
<name>Susie</name>	Susie	Smolka	Bad enough, rotten enough, and you get your cock-sucking head blown off by boogies. Now that’s the way the world’s supposed to be run! [MASK] comes back into the kitchen and tells us she doesn’t want to do it.
<name>Augie</name>	Augie	Jack	“[MASK], what is it going to be with you, with those bowels?” “They’re turning into concrete, that’s what it’s going to be.” “Because you eat too fast.” “I don’t eat too fast.”
<name>Barney</name>	Barney	Alex	“I’m getting radiation poisoning, [MASK], from what you’re giving off.” “I’m not giving off shit! I’ve said nothing.” “You’ve got those black Hebe eyes, man, they say it for you.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Mandel	What happened when you came inside her? Did she come too? [MASK], clarify something that I have to know—do they come? Stuff? Or do they just moan a lot—or whatP How does she come! What is it like!
<name>Freud</name>	Freud	Freud	A shikse has touched my dick with her bare hand, and now I’ll be blind forever! Doctor, my psyche, it’s about as difficult to understand as a grade-school primer! Who needs dreams, I ask you? Who needs [MASK]?
