<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mary	Twelve years, but I had not forgotten how to talk to [MASK]. ‘Pretty, and nice.’ The Sister and the aunts held me to them and we wept for all sorrow that had occurred since last we had met, but especially for this one.
<name>David</name>	David	Reuben	I suggest that you keep strictly to facts if in future you feel you need to make further representations to this office. . . When [MASK] finished school he began to study law, but in the evenings and at weekends he would talk about the land and the letters, to his parents and his brother.
<name>Rangi</name>	Rangi	Puti	‘Too hoha, come on, [MASK].’ He and our cousin shouldered in under my armpits and linked hands behind me, as I draped my arms about their necks. ‘Go on ahead, we’ll catch you shortly,’ our Aunty said.
<name>St. Joseph</name>	St. Joseph	Mary	She sang quietly as she dusted and polished, or loudly as she banged the chalk-dusters on the concrete ledge outside. Sometimes she would fall asleep with her head against the statue of [MASK], her mouth open a little, showing her strange teeth that looked as though they had been filed.
<name>Talutah</name>	Talutah	James	It was not easy by then, for me to be without my chair. My uncles planned and built the special door for me, and the people made the ramp and path. My brother [MASK] carved the doorway, and in his carvings told the special story of the joining.
<name>Jonny</name>	Jonny	Toko	I would have got up quickly then to help [MASK] with his chair. We did not want him to be using his small strength, wheeling his chair on his own. We wanted to be his strength, and to be with him at any waking time.
<name>Wiremu</name>	Wiremu	Hemi	On most days they worked until they could no longer see, but that day [MASK] had told them to pack up the gear and take it to the shed. He’d told them to go and have a kai because he felt sorry for them, felt aroha for them.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Hemi	In the darkness the hills, the broken hills, had become whole again. We were close to the second buoy before we saw it. The water had roughened and I had to turn the dinghy several times before [MASK] could grasp the ball and rope.
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Son	You’re telling me that now too.’ ‘It’s not that, [MASK]. It’s not what we mean. You’ve got the brains. You should use them.’ ‘I am. That’s what I’m doing right now, using my brains.
<name>Nan</name>	Nan	Hemi	The eel flesh was goldy and smelled of the sea and the trees. We wanted to eat some of it right then but [MASK] was a little angry with us and told us you didn’t eat food until it had been shared, especially if it was from the sea.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Manu	The big machines that would slice the morning’s light were hidden somewhere in the hills’ shadows. My brother [MASK] was not in his bed when I woke. Perhaps it was his getting up that woke me. His bed was empty and our door was open.
<name>My father</name>	My father	Hemi	[MASK], I knew, would be asking the man to stay and have lunch with all of us in the wharekai, but the man was shaking his head. There we were with everyone else gone. My father and the man were going towards the door.
<name>limpets</name>	limpets	ngakihi	Our eyes are shore eyes, the shoreline being patterned, mapped, indelibly on the eyes. ‘One evening I collected [MASK] from a rock and baited my hooks with them. I uncoiled a length of line and threw it out over the sea of polished dark.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Tangi	She was putting it in the water. O Mummy it isn’t a fish!’ [MASK] never cries from anything except temper but I could see she was close to crying. What she held out to me, what I took from her, was a misshapen and cauled baby boy.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Mary	So [MASK] and her man were the first new breath. People coming in trucks were the second. From there had come a growth and a flourishing, a leaping from within the dark sea, a deep and excited breathing. At another level there was pain.
<name>he</name>	he	Manu	I don’t remember if [MASK] cried in the night, and called and kicked and struggled in the dark. I don’t remember if that was one of the nights that I woke with his fingers pinching hard into my arm.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Toko	It was a bright, starry night and I could see her quite clearly though there were no lights on in the house. The side entrance of the house I could not see, but I could hear [MASK] backing his chair up the ramp.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	James	It was worse than a horse dying inside, he said. But [MASK] didn’t think there had been anything about a mountain. He reckoned that their uncle was just a fat man with a coffin the size of a kitchen that it took forty men to carry.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Tangimoana	‘The clearing.’ ‘Someone done it. We’ve just seen. . . .’ And [MASK] said, ‘Why? What do you mean?’ ‘Channelling down the side. . . .’
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	James	But I remember waiting, and the light going, and the soft splash sounds of the water with all the colour gone. I remember when the pull came. [MASK], who was sitting by me, grabbed and held onto me so that I wouldn’t go over the side.
<name>Rangi</name>	Rangi	Hemi	Then she plaited the muka ends together until her work looked like the long bone that [MASK] had taken out of my fish. While she worked she was telling me and showing me which to lift and which to pull but it was too much to remember.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Reuben	It told about the mayor of those days promising to do everything he could and to look into the matter, personally it said, and to discuss the matter with councillors, but first of all [MASK] and the others must move themselves and all their things.
<name>Strider</name>	Strider	Stan	. understood, and not believed. What we told you then was turned against us, was given other meaning.’ ‘We'll have another look round.’ ‘Be our guests,’ said [MASK]. ‘Look anywhere you like, talk to anyone.
<name>Brigid</name>	Brigid	Stan	It spiralled thinly upwards, linking the earth that we are, to the sky that we are, joining the past that we are to the now and beyond now that we are. And when she had finished they helped her home. ‘We’ll do what we can now,’ [MASK] said.
<name>had</name>	had	Roimata	We did not get in under our rugs because the weather was warm. Earlier when preparing the house for the meeting some had thought that we should bring in a table for the man’s plans and papers, and a chair for the man to sit on, but my mother [MASK] disagreed.
<name>John</name>	John	Hemi	So we went in and collected all the clothing they had been wearing and distributed it to be washed. [MASK] and some of the others hosed down the verandah floor, and cleaned the footwear that had been left there. We washed the clothing and hung it on our lines.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Tangimoana	It was then that we all realised that the man had not, had never, understood anything we had ever said, and never would. My uncle tried to explain it all again. I think he felt sorry for the man. My sister [MASK] was not sorry for the man at all.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	James	At the same time I was feeling appalled at the humpy shape of the child’s back and the turned wispiness of his legs. ‘[MASK], go and open the door and the gate,’ I said as I heard the car coming.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Granny	‘Had?’ ‘Gave birth to, down on the beach.’ They looked in some disbelief at the bundle that I held out to them. ‘It must be hers,’ I said. ‘Well someone done wrong to her,’ said [MASK].
<name>Maxwell</name>	Maxwell	Mr	your shark tanks . . .’ (Plenty of sharks around . . .) \ . . trained whales and seals etcetera. As I’ve outlined in writing, and as Ive discussed with [MASK] um . . . here and . . . one or two others.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Reuben	The old man didn’t answer [MASK]’s questions about school, but he said, ‘Don’t go out on the streets, go on the land. Our land, yours. Belongs to all of us, all of yous.’
<name>Rangi</name>	Rangi	Mary	My Granny remained seated with me and so did my first mother, [MASK]. As the hymn ended everyone moved out of the house, the children to play with their ball out on the marae, and the adults towards the wharekai. The man was standing with my father.
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Mary	‘Put jam on. Nice jam.’ [MASK] stabbed her knife into the jar and levered the jam. It was lumped with fruit and wine-dark and she spread it into the melting butter. ‘Eat it my darling. Drink your tea.’
<name>Mass</name>	Mass	karakia	About two hundred people went there with food and blankets and guitars. They had [MASK] first, with prayers and hymns. Then they spread the blankets on the playing-fields and sat down with the food and guitars. They had a concert too, using the stand as a stage.
<name>Father</name>	Father	Roimata	The old man’s hair was white against the dark clothes that people wore, and when he stood to speak he said that our grandmother, lying in her coffin in the glinting house, was a singing bird and a soul of joy. That’s what [MASK] has told us.
<name>She</name>	She	Hemi	important.’ ‘And you came.’ We did not speak for a long time after that. We joined in the singing and the talk going on about us. Then [MASK] said, ‘I didn’t think there would be anyone. . . .’
<name>Aunty</name>	Aunty	Kui	He and our cousin shouldered in under my armpits and linked hands behind me, as I draped my arms about their necks. ‘Go on ahead, we’ll catch you shortly,’ our Aunty said. ‘What about you, [MASK]?
<name>Winnemucca</name>	Winnemucca	Roimata	These were the places wanted by the money men, that they would pay thousands of dollars to have. These were the places that the council people tried to assist the money men to get from us. My mother [MASK] said that they think differently in their heads and have different importances.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Toko	One night when the meeting-house was full of people [MASK] leaned towards me and said, ‘These are the people of hunger and anger that will come when everything is grown and green.’ His face was hot and his hair was damp but he was not, just then, in pain.
<name>Nyame</name>	Nyame	Roimata	Then [MASK], who is a mother to me, took me and peeled the skin from my two-colour eyes so that I could see. She turned me up to let the stone fall from my throat, then she shook breath into me and wrapped me in warm towels.
<name>grouper</name>	grouper	kahawai	And the shores, the meeting places of the land and sea, if left will become clean again. We will put the boats out into clear water again and go for [MASK], moki and shark, and will put lines down for kelpie and cod.
<name>Grimes</name>	Grimes	Matiu	‘But nothing to do with workers, or supervisors of work,’ [MASK] said. ‘More like the top ones, the ones we don’t see. Into bad business, so we hear. The big man does a fair bit of dealing.
<name>Flanagan</name>	Flanagan	Rupena	The houses at cheap rent were in return for using the land. Using. But there was nothing in that letter about the pulling down of houses. No payments had been made. It was all as old [MASK] had said.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Pena	‘And that might be almost the same.’ [MASK] thought it was enough and they have been together much of the time since then. In the evenings the Te Ope people talked about their struggles of the past, of their new work, and of their hopes and dreams.
<name>Millie</name>	Millie	Tangimoana	‘She was going to chuck it away. Mum, Mum, in the sea!’ ‘Where was it. . . ? Where did she. . . ?’ But [MASK] was a breath ahead of me.
<name>Santiago</name>	Santiago	James	[MASK] wanted me to have his line for a little while because he cannot enjoy without sharing. But I waited strongly holding my strong line with its big old hook that had been fixed for deep water, and its heavy sinker bigger than my fist.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Mary	He would dip tea for them out of the billy and toast slices of bread. He had always seemed a kind man. It was difficult to believe that he would lie with [MASK] knowing that she really was a child still, and that she would never come to an understanding of it all.
<name>Nora</name>	Nora	Granny	They would go into [MASK]’s kitchen where the fire was always going and where the table would be set with best cups, and glass dishes of butter and jam. The big new round of bread would be on the board wrapped in a cloth.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Tangimoana	‘What colour are their kitchens?’ So [MASK] said, ‘Yellow. Their kitchens are yellow. And there aren’t any windows. You can’t see out or in. They sit all day and night in their kitchens, wrapped in blankets, and they mumble and stare.
<name>Old Ben</name>	Old Ben	Mary	He kept to himself for the most part but he had become a friend to the children and to [MASK]. They were always excited to wake, and looking out, to see the smoke from his fire and know that he had come.
<name>Orual</name>	Orual	Roimata	It was a quiet place for me. I could listen there, or rest. Because I had been given special oldness I could speak from there to the heke, or to the quiet, waiting hearts. One night [MASK]
<name>Seamus</name>	Seamus	Reuben	At the time when he himself was working the land, learning what he could, [MASK] was standing up to them all, digging his toes in. Years of his young life, and all on his own at first.
<name>Marama</name>	Marama	Granny	We stood there quietly for some moments, then [MASK] began to chant a waiata, one that was known only to her. It spiralled thinly upwards, linking the earth that we are, to the sky that we are, joining the past that we are to the now and beyond now that we are.
<name>Kiri</name>	Kiri	Mary	Afterwards the cat followed her back to the house and curled itself up on the paepae where the sun hit. ‘Here’s me,’ [MASK] said to the tipuna as she went in. ‘Come back to my work now and make you beautiful and nice.’
<name>Rangi</name>	Rangi	Mary	When daylight came we went out to look at the ruin that had been the house of genealogies, of living and dying and dreams. [MASK] had gone out ahead of us and was standing amongst the disintegrated timbers pulling a scarred and blackened poupou from the pile.
<name>Rosie</name>	Rosie	Mary	My father and the man were going towards the door. My mother [MASK] was standing on her mattress singing to the house, to the shadowy, quick-eyed figures, rocking her body from side to side and beginning to sing louder and louder.
<name>mokopuna</name>	mokopuna	Mary	We would not have wished that the old lady in her ninety-third year would be in the wharekai daily, sitting by the fireplace preparing vegetables, but it was what she chose to do. ‘I’ll help my [MASK],’ she said.
<name>Granny</name>	Granny	Granny	I sat down on her doorstep to take my boots off, although that is not a rule for me. I am allowed in houses wearing my special boots as long as I wipe them carefully. But I was pleased to get the big boots off and go into [MASK]’s kitchen.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Reuben	The land still belonged to the people just as [MASK] and his family knew it did. And at last the court of enquiry showed it too. But what about the sports people and their lease? They had a lease of the land, they said.
<name>Becky</name>	Becky	Mary	He could hear it snuffling and stamping in the dark, and he could see the darker-than-black shadow of it as he made his way, first to the shed with the gear, and then to the house. He could hear [MASK] in the house singing.
<name>John</name>	John	Pena	Then after a while she’d gone, and so far hadn’t contacted them. [MASK] had gone to get her but she’d sent him away. It was almost dark. He stopped work and began to collect the vegetables that would be needed for the next day.
<name>Koro</name>	Koro	Hemi	Good can come from what is not good, good can come from sorrow, new life from old, but is it enough? [MASK] and I will put down the nets again and we will have butterfish and moki. We will fish from the dinghies or from the shores.
<name>Rawiri</name>	Rawiri	James	There will be tuna to hang above the smoke fires. [MASK] The young man said to the people, ‘There’s a story that says that the finishing of this poupou - this last for the old house, first for the new - goes into the future.
<name>Mpho</name>	Mpho	Reuben	‘It’s true that I am only a child,’ [MASK] said, ‘but it’s not true that I want to be a chief. I want those elders that you speak of, my uncle who said it, to support me and lead me.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Reuben	We the owners of the land do not have any agreement with you regarding lease. We the owners of the land have never received any rents or payments of any sort for our land, and this has been shown by the courts.’ These are some of the things [MASK]’s father said.
<name>him</name>	him	Toko	On the way up there was a large manuka that stood by itself, that they should not touch, so they did not touch it. They would move on to the narrow path that led to the gate, helping each other, helping [MASK] so that he would not lose balance and fall.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Mary	There were patterns made out of crying and knowledge and love and quarrelling. There was a pattern, or a person, for every piece of our lives. The house was polished and loved by my first mother [MASK] every day. And behind the house is where the dead are buried.
<name>Aniela</name>	Aniela	Mary	‘You leave us two here and not to worry. Otherwise I rattle in my own kitchen good for nothing. Go to your other work.’ We would not have wanted to take [MASK] away from the work she loved, and we did not.
<name>Jill</name>	Jill	Manu	And then [MASK] began to shout too, ‘It is! It is! Oh it’s real! We’re all awake, and it’s real! Fire is here, and burning!’ ‘Leave me,’ I said. ‘Go and help them.’
<name>Tai</name>	Tai	Mary	This poupou, found in the dust by my first mother [MASK], was the link from old to new, that’s what everyone said. It was the piece that showed that there had been no real death, or showed perhaps that death is a coiled spring.
<name>Emmeline</name>	Emmeline	Mary	It was my own mother [MASK] who had sat amongst the water-soaked ruins of the first house and pulled the loving-man from the ash. She had held him to her, put her ear to his heart, and had begun, softly, to sing.
<name>Kereopa</name>	Kereopa	Hoani	‘I understand you,’ [MASK] said. ‘Nevertheless we must put all that aside. We must put the hurt aside, and we must approach the burial ground of the whanau without anger. Those other things . . . they are other matters.
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Stan	It was more than thirty years ago, at fifteen, that he’d left school to work the land when his father died. He’d had to take much of the responsibility for the gardens then, while his older brother [MASK] was away getting further education and his cousins were doing their trades.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Tangimoana	It is in my memory that the big fish was much much bigger than me, and longer than the little dinghy sitting on the shore. ‘We got it, we got it,’ [MASK] was shouting, and there was talking and noise from everyone.
<name>Nyasha</name>	Nyasha	Roimata	Part of the story is old and part of it is new. The old part of the story has been told to us by my second mother [MASK]. The new part has been told in the newspapers and on television in words and pictures.
<name>Yanko</name>	Yanko	Mary	‘Very beautiful my [MASK].’ ‘Beautiful and nice.’ ‘Very beautiful and nice. . . . You come and have a cup of tea now.’ ‘Cup of tea.’ ‘Come and have a cup of tea and a bread.’
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mary	By ten o’clock he would be running back home along the beach calling to me and to [MASK], and to his little brother. He would be trembling and exhausted, and at night he would call out and cry in his sleep.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Tangimoana	‘Who? Who from the job?’ [MASK] was shouting too. ‘Someone. Don’t know who, but we know they’re a crook lot, they’re dealers. We’re packing it in, that’s the finish for us . . .
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Matiu	They had brought hot drink and food. We set the kai down in one of the dinghies and stood about to drink the tea and eat the food that [MASK] and the others had brought. We were too tired to speak of what had happened and why.
<name>And</name>	And	Roimata	Then they put their arms round each other holding each other closely, listening to the beating and the throbbing and the quiet of their hearts. Behind them were the soft whisperings of the sea. [MASK] I decided not to ring or write, but to take what I owned and go there.
<name>Marama</name>	Marama	Marama	She blew his mouth and nostrils, and with two fingers lightly massaged his chest until the mucus began to drain freely. She took a pendant from her ear and put it on the blanket beside him. ‘Tokowaru-i-te-[MASK].
<name>Abigail</name>	Abigail	Roimata	At last they had a place to put their feet, and it was their own place, their own ancestral place, after all the years and all the trouble. Our mother [MASK] made books for us and we had stories of our own, in our own school.
<name>Toko</name>	Toko	Hemi	The dull, hard sound of when my father [MASK] whacked my big fish with the heavy stick came back to my mind. And the life of the long-ago Toko and the life of my big fish seemed somehow to come together. There was a big kehua there.
<name>Moko</name>	Moko	Marama	‘That’s Tokowaru-i-te-[MASK], your great-granduncle, and he’s been dead for seventy years. Only me and him, you know,’ she said, ‘the two of us. And after that, only me.’
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Dollarman	‘I’ll explain about that, about access from behind. Access from behind is . . . not impossible, but almost. Certainly not desirable. We need to get people in, quick. . . .’ ([MASK]) ‘. . .
<name>John</name>	John	Stan	Gradually we were able to make a narrow clearing so that the water began to flow again, slowly at first, and then more rapidly as we pulled away more and more of the rubble. ‘They did this,’ [MASK] said. No one had spoken until then.
<name>Manolin</name>	Manolin	James	It’s tied.' I didn't hear him, and I don't remember. I was holding and pulling, and [MASK] was holding me. “My fish, my big fish,’ I remember calling.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Hemi	[MASK] The sun would not go down for another hour yet, and even after that there would still be enough light to work by for a while. It was setting further round now, getting down a lot earlier. Each year you noticed it at about this time -suddenly.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Sue	Couldn’t imagine a life with anyone else, even if it was true that there had been someone else in his life for a while. Couldn’t remember where he’d met [MASK], but it was probably at a party. At the rugby club, most likely.
<name>Lenina</name>	Lenina	Matiu	‘It took a man and a machine to do all this.’ ‘And. That’s the finish for us,’ [MASK] said. ‘We quit. There’s a lot’ll walk off once they know.’
<name>Rangi</name>	Rangi	Hemi	Then we all went up back into the bush to get green manuka brush for the smoke fire. [MASK] started the sweet-smell fire in the smoke drum and we took the eel pieces out of the brine and dabbed the wetness away from them with a cloth.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Hemi	Soon the light went off the water and then the sea was only a sound - a soft sucking sound and a fish splash sound. When the dark came so did the cold, and I’ve been told [MASK] put a jersey on me. I do not remember the cold
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Hoani	‘Build something, and it builds you,’ was what [MASK] said, and I thought of a long time ago when the old lady had said to me, ‘You know what I do, I make myself.’ And she had given me the little kit which I have still.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	‘The sirens,’ he said. ‘Burning. Burning in the night, but then . . . nothing. Nothing’s real.’ Ahead of us [MASK] was running, in her own shuffling way, and she was calling and crying, ‘Oh don’t!
<name>Francie</name>	Francie	Tangi	[MASK] put bread on to the water to bring the herrings. The water was a soft orange colour I remember, and little herrings put their mouths to the water’s skin making sharp circles which widened and widened on the surface of the water.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Manu	No one called to them, no baby cried, no one whispered to them the secrets of under the ground. ‘What colour are their kitchens?’ They stopped listening for the secrets of under the ground and sat up, looking at [MASK].
<name>Jonas</name>	Jonas	Manu	[MASK] got into my bed so that he wouldn’t call out and cry in the night. We went right under the blankets and we were big conger eels living under the water at the base of the snow mountain. We had little eyes like pips and long fins from head to tail.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Tangimoana	It’s a way [MASK] has, a sharp boldness that will make people listen to her. Also it is a way of hers to act alone. The machines were not heard that day on the hills, and have not been heard since, except once.
<name>Timothy</name>	Timothy	Stan	Our Uncle [MASK] spoke about foresight. ‘We have our eyes,’ he said, ‘We have our eyes, and after years of trying to please others we’re going on our own, and we can see. There’s no lack of foresight, as you put it.
<name>Orual</name>	Orual	Hemi	I have [MASK] who is father to me. I was born on the beach stones on a day with no colour and my borning mother carried me into the water. She would have left me there for the birds, mistaking me for something she had found.
