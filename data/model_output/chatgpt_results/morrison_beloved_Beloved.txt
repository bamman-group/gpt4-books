<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Sethe	they ask him. It will be dry, he says, when the corn is tall. There is no food to put by, but [MASK] says she will get a jug of cane syrup or molasses, and some bread when it is near the time to go.
<name>they</name>	they	Ella	“Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,” and nobody needed more; nobody needed a grownup evil sitting at the table with a grudge. As long as the ghost showed out from its ghostly place—shaking stuff, crying, smashing and such—[MASK] respected it.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Sethe	Do we need one about her too?” asked [MASK]. “I just don’t understand what the hold is. It’s clear why she holds on to you, but I just can’t see why you holding on to her.”
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Sethe	So who was this woman with a mouth that was not [MASK]’s, but whose eyes were almost as calm as hers? Whose head was turned on her neck in the manner he loved so well it watered his eye to see it. And he said so.
<name>Mr. Garner</name>	Mr. Garner	Garner	As soon as the whitemen get to where they have tied their horses and mount them, they are calmer, talking among themselves about the difficulty they face. The problems. Voices remind schoolteacher about the spoiling these particular slaves have had at [MASK]’s hands.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Denver	[MASK] was swaying with delight. And on the way home, although leading them now, the shadows of three people still held hands. a fully dressed woman walked out of the water. She barely gained the dry bank of the stream before she sat down and leaned against a mulberry tree.
<name>Dr. Mandelet</name>	Dr. Mandelet	Baby	She took the newborn and handed it to a young woman in a bonnet, telling her not to clean the eyes till she got the mother’s urine. “Has it cried out yet?” asked [MASK]. “A little.” “Time enough.
<name>Mrs. Smith</name>	Mrs. Smith	Sethe	If [MASK] wanted any, she put them aside soon as they were ready. But there was some passable stew. Problem was, all her pies were sold too. Only rice pudding left and half a pan of gingerbread that didn’t come out right.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Sethe	“I’ll do what I can, miss.” [MASK] never expected to see another thing in this world, so when she felt toes prodding her hip it took a while to come out of a sleep she thought was death.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Devil	He is looking at her. Bare feet and chamomile sap. Took off my shoes; took off my hat. Bare feet and chamomile sap. Gimme back my shoes; gimme back my hat. Lay my head on a potato sack, [MASK] sneak up behind my back.
<name>she</name>	she	Denver	Death is a skipped meal compared to this. She can feel her thickness thinning, dissolving into nothing. She grabs the hair at her temples to get enough to uproot it and halt the melting for a while. Teeth clamped shut, [MASK] brakes her sobs.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Halle	Because I had to take it apart afterwards and put all the pieces back where they were. Now [MASK] was patient, waiting for me to finish it. He knew I wouldn’t go ahead without having it. Finally I took the mosquito netting from a nail out the barn.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Beloved	Took her a long time to finish with blue, then yellow, then green. She was well into pink when she died. I don’t believe she wanted to get to red and I understand why because me and [MASK] outdid ourselves with it.
<name>Slave</name>	Slave	Sethe	“The daughter? The killed one?” “That’s what they tell me.” “How they know that’s her?” “It’s sitting there. Sleeps, eats and raises hell. Whipping [MASK] every day.” “I’ll be.
<name>Myop</name>	Myop	Denver	With those assurances, [MASK] left, but not before she had seen, sitting on a shelf by the back door, a blackboy’s mouth full of money. His head was thrown back farther than a head could go, his hands were shoved in his pockets.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Windows	Things became what they were: drabness looked drab; heat was hot. [MASK] suddenly had view. And wouldn’t you know he’d be a singing man. Little rice, little bean. No meat in between. Hard work ain’t easy, Dry bread ain’t greasy.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Beloved	[MASK] heard them as soon as the door banged shut behind her. She jumped at the slam and swiveled her head toward the whispers coming from behind the white stairs. She took a step and felt like crying. She had been so close, then closer.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sixo	“You stole that shoat, didn’t you?” “No. Sir,” said [MASK], but he had the decency to keep his eyes on the meat. “You telling me you didn’t steal it, and I’m looking right at you?”
<name>Beloved</name>	Beloved	Sethe	“No more powerful than the way I loved her,” [MASK] answered and there it was again. The welcoming cool of unchiseled headstones; the one she selected to lean against on tiptoe, her knees wide open as any grave.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Beloved	[MASK] went to look, pausing to watch a cardinal hop from limb to branch. She followed the blood spot shifting in the leaves until she lost it and even then she walked on, backward, still hungry for another glimpse. She turned finally and ran through the woods to the stream.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Halle	Exactly like that afternoon in the wild onions—when one more step was the most she could see of the future. Other people went crazy, why couldn’t she? Other people’s brains stopped, turned around and went on to something new, which is what must have happened to [MASK].
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Vashti	She was drinking out of it and just gazing out over the yard. I went over. Stood back a ways and took off my hat. I said, ‘Scuse me, miss. Scuse me?’ She turned to look. I’m smiling. ‘Scuse me. You seen [MASK]?
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Sethe	“Milk.” “You one mess.” [MASK] looked down at her stomach and touched it. The baby was dead. She had not died in the night, but the baby had. If that was the case, then there was no stopping now.
<name>Ma Joad</name>	Ma Joad	Sethe	“No.” [MASK] tried to shift to a sitting position but couldn’t. “I like to die I’m so hungry.” The girl moved her eyes slowly, examining the greenery around her. “Thought there’d be huckleberries. Look like it.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Stamp	You choose. You ain’t got to sleep in no cellar, and I apologize for each and every night you did. I don’t know how that preacher let you do it. I knowed him since he was a boy.” “Whoa, [MASK].
<name>Eveline</name>	Eveline	Beloved	But it was a need that went on and on into glowing health because [MASK] didn’t go anywhere. There didn’t seem anyplace for her to go. She didn’t mention one, or have much of an idea of what she was doing in that part of the country or where she had been.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Stole	So you protected yourself and loved small. Picked the tiniest stars out of the sky to own; lay down with head twisted in order to see the loved one over the rim of the trench before you slept. [MASK] shy glances at her between the trees at chain-up.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Judy	“I said I had two things to say to you. I only told you one. I have to tell you the other.” “I don’t want to know it. I don’t want to know nothing. Just if [MASK] will take me in or won’t she.”
<name>Mrs. Brisby</name>	Mrs. Brisby	Sethe	And since that was so—if her daughter could come back home from the timeless place— certainly her sons could, and would, come back from wherever they had gone to. [MASK] covered her front teeth with her tongue against the cold.
<name>Rocky</name>	Rocky	Mister	There was this one egg left. Looked like a blank, but then I saw it move so I tapped it open and here come [MASK], bad feet and all. I watched that son a bitch grow up and whup everything in the yard.”
<name>Judy</name>	Judy	Denver	“Filed a claim and rode on off. They going to let you out for the burial,” she said, “not the funeral, just the burial,” and they did. The sheriff came with me and looked away when I fed [MASK] in the wagon.
<name>Granny</name>	Granny	Sethe	During the whole hateful crawl to the lean-to, it never bucked once. Nothing of [MASK]’s was intact by the time they reached it except the cloth that covered her hair. Below her bloody knees, there was no feeling at all; her chest was two cushions of pins.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Halle	Into the empty space of not knowing about [MASK]—a space sometimes colored with righteous resentment at what could have been his cowardice, or stupidity or bad luck—that empty place of no definite news was filled now with a brand-new sorrow and who could tell how many more on the way.
<name>Sookie</name>	Sookie	Sethe	“What? What? What? You talking back to me?” “I’m telling you don’t say nothing to me.” “You better get them pies made.” [MASK] touched the fruit and picked up the paring knife.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Denver	She can hardly walk without holding on to something.” “That’s what I mean. Can’t walk, but I seen her pick up the rocker with one hand.” “You didn’t.” “Don’t tell me. Ask [MASK].
<name>she</name>	she	Sethe	Although her eyes were closed, [MASK] knew his gaze was on her face, and a paper picture of just how bad she must look raised itself up before her mind’s eye. Still, there was no mockery coming from his gaze. Soft.
<name>Brett</name>	Brett	Sethe	[MASK] looked at him. In that unlit daylight his face, bronzed and reduced to its bones, smoothed her heart down. “You want to tell me about it?” she asked him. “I don’t know. I never have talked about it.
<name>the woman</name>	the woman	Sethe	A short woman, young, with a croaker sack, greeted her. “Saw the sign a while ago,” she said. “But I couldn’t get here no quicker.” “What sign?” asked [MASK].
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Sethe	The road curved like an elbow, and as he approached it he heard the singers before he saw them. When the women assembled outside 124, [MASK] was breaking a lump of ice into chunks. She dropped the ice pick into her apron pocket to scoop the pieces into a basin of water.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Stamp	[MASK] leaned down and untied his shoe. Twelve black buttonhooks, six on each side at the bottom, led to four pairs of eyes at the top. He loosened the laces all the way down, adjusted the tongue carefully and wound them back again.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Sethe	Just curiosity. But the thing that leapt up in her when he asked it was a thing that had been lying there all along. She never went back. The second day she didn’t go, [MASK] asked her why not.
<name>July</name>	July	Sixo	It is sprinkling now. A teasing August rain that raises expectations it cannot fill. He thinks he should have sung along. Loud, something loud and rolling to go with [MASK]’s tune, but the words put him off—he didn’t understand the words.
<name>Death</name>	Death	Nonono	He is coming into her yard and he is coming for her best thing. She hears wings. Little hummingbirds stick needle beaks right through her headcloth into her hair and beat their wings. And if she thinks anything, it is no. No no. [MASK].
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Sethe	As it was, he went alone from house to joyous house drinking what was offered. But she hadn’t waited and he attended her funeral more put out with her than bereaved. [MASK] and her daughter were dry-eyed on that occasion.
<name>Ida</name>	Ida	Amy	She had not died in the night, but the baby had. If that was the case, then there was no stopping now. She would get that milk to her baby girl if she had to swim. “Ain’t you hungry?” [MASK] asked her.
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Sethe	So [MASK] and the girl Denver did what they could, and what the house permitted, for her. Together they waged a perfunctory battle against the outrageous behavior of that place; against turned-over slop jars, smacks on the behind, and gusts of sour air.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Denver	Something privately shameful that had seeped into a slit in her mind right behind the slap on her face and the circled cross. “Why they hang your ma’am?” [MASK] asked. This was the first time she had heard anything about her mother’s mother.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Halle	He did.” “Well?” “If he hadn’t of, she would of dropped in his cooking stove.” “Still, he did it. Let you work it off.” “Uh huh.” “Wake up, [MASK].”
<name>Cassie</name>	Cassie	Sethe	Together they stood in the doorway. For [MASK] it was as though the Clearing had come to her with all its heat and simmering leaves, where the voices of women searched for the right combination, the key, the code, the sound that broke the back of words.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Denver	Instead he nodded and asked the question he wanted to. “Your mother all right?” “No,” said [MASK]. “No. No, not a bit all right.” “You think I should stop by? Would she welcome it?”
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Beloved	Brightly colored clothes lie on the floor. Hanging from a wall peg is the dress [MASK] wore when he first saw her. A pair of ice skates nestles in a basket in the corner. He turns his eyes back to the bed and keeps looking at it.
<name>Artemis</name>	Artemis	Aw	And when the top of her dress was around her hips and he saw the sculpture her back had become, like the decorative work of an ironsmith too passionate for display, he could think but not say, “[MASK], Lord, girl.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Whitepeople	He was too good, she said. From the beginning, she said, he was too good for the world. Scared her. She thought, He’ll never make it through nothing. [MASK] must have thought so too, because they never got split up.
<name>she</name>	she	Sethe	“Girl, give it up. We been friends too long to act like this.” “Well, who can tell what all went on in there? Look here, I don’t know who [MASK] is or none of her people.” “What?!”
<name>Mrs. Smith</name>	Mrs. Smith	Denver	A woman, standing at the open door, lifted her hand halfway in greeting, then froze it near her shoulder as she leaned forward to see whom she waved to. [MASK] lowered her head. Next was a tiny fenced plot with a cow in it.
<name>the guide</name>	the guide	Amy	Panting under four summer stars, she threw her legs over the sides, because here come the head, as [MASK] informed her as though she did not know it—as though the rip was a breakup of walnut logs in the brace, or of lightning’s jagged tear through a leather sky.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Sethe	[MASK], you hear me? Come away from that window and listen.” “Yes, ma’am.” “Ask my brother-in-law to come up after supper.” “Yes, ma’am.” “If you’d wash your hair you could get rid of that lice.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Denver	When her tooth came out—an odd fragment, last in the row—she thought it was starting. “Must be a wisdom,” said [MASK]. “Don’t it hurt?” “Yes.” “Then why don’t you cry?”
<name>William</name>	William	Howard	Devil of a time keeping her off the stairs. Nowadays babies get up and walk soon’s you drop em, but twenty years ago when I was a girl, babies stayed babies longer. [MASK] didn’t pick up his own head till he was nine months.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Paul	[MASK] D. That’s my heart. I’m proud of that girl. She was the first one wrestle her mother down. Before anybody knew what the devil was going on.” “She saved his life then, you could say.” “You could.
<name>Sissy</name>	Sissy	Soon	They were a family somehow and he was not the head of it. Can you stitch this up for me, baby? Um hm. [MASK]’s I finish this petticoat. She just got the one she came here in and everybody needs a change.
<name>Old Dan</name>	Old Dan	Sixo	His tobacco tin, blown open, spilled contents that floated freely and made him their play and prey. He couldn’t figure out why it took so long. He may as well have jumped in the fire with [MASK] and they both could have had a good laugh.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Sethe	Building voice upon voice until they found it, and when they did it was a wave of sound wide enough to sound deep water and knock the pods off chestnut trees. It broke over [MASK] and she trembled like the baptized in its wash.
<name>him</name>	him	Garner	“She need another white on the place.” “What for?” “What you think? What you think?” Well, that’s the way it was. Nobody counted on [MASK] dying. Nobody thought he could. How ’bout that?
<name>Grendel</name>	Grendel	Sethe	It was the second question that made it impossible for so long to ask [MASK] about the first. The thing that leapt up had been coiled in just such a place: a darkness, a stone, and some other thing that moved by itself.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Sethe	Another woman would have squinted or at least teared if the wind whipped her face as it did [MASK]’s. Another woman might have shot him a look of apprehension, pleading, anger even, because what he said sure sounded like part one of Goodbye, I’m gone.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Carmine	[MASK]. You don’t even know about that, do you? Now you never will. Bet you never even sleep with the sun in your face. I did it a couple of times. Most times I’m feeding stock before light and don’t get to sleep till way after dark comes.
<name>Jody</name>	Jody	Halle	Maybe schoolteacher shot after him, shot at his feet, to remind him of the trespass. Maybe [MASK] got in the barn, hid there and got locked in with the rest of schoolteacher’s stock. Maybe anything. He disappeared and everybody was on his own.
<name>she</name>	she	Sethe	“Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle too.” “And left when he found out what [MASK] did?” “Look like he might have a place to stay after all.” “What you say casts a different light.
<name>Momma</name>	Momma	Beloved	There was no nursing milk to call my own. I know what it is to be without the milk that belongs to you; to have to fight and holler for it, and to have so little left. I’ll tell [MASK] about that; she’ll understand.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Baby	[MASK] had no back door; so he braved the cold and a wall of talk to knock on the one she did have. He clutched the red ribbon in his pocket for strength. Softly at first, then harder. At the last he banged furiously— disbelieving it could happen.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Denver	Trailing a yard or so behind the women, he fought the anger that shot through his stomach all the way home. When he saw [MASK] silhouetted in the lamplight at the window, he could not help thinking, “And whose ally you?”
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Beloved	Her problem at first was trying to find out who was to blame. Her eye was on her mother, for a signal that the thing that was in her was out, and she would kill again. But it was [MASK] who made demands.
<name>Schoolteacher</name>	Schoolteacher	Paul	“Maybe it does have plans.” Whatever they were or might have been, [MASK] D messed them up for good. With a table and a loud male voice he had rid 124 of its claim to local fame.
<name>Mrs. Higgins</name>	Mrs. Higgins	Sethe	He had no smoking papers, so he fiddled with the pouch and listened through the open door to [MASK] quieting her daughter. When she came back she avoided his look and went straight to a small table next to the stove.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Beloved	“This place is heavy.” “Would you like to sit up?” “No,” said the raspy voice. It took three days for [MASK] to notice the orange patches in the darkness of the quilt.
<name>Jolene</name>	Jolene	Ma’am	Kneeling next to you while you were praying. Had its arm around your waist.” “Well, I’ll be.” “What were you praying for, [MASK]?” “Not for anything. I don’t pray anymore. I just talk.”
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Halle	He looked at her then, closely. Closer than he had when she first rounded the house on wet and shining legs, holding her shoes and stockings up in one hand, her skirts in the other. [MASK]’s girl—the one with iron eyes and backbone to match.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Denver	Talking of a war full of dead people, she looked happy—flush-faced, and although her voice was heavy as a man’s, she smelled like a roomful of flowers—excitement that [MASK] could have all for herself in the boxwood.
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Sixo	She was ashamed, too, because it was stealing and [MASK]’s argument on the subject amused her but didn’t change the way she felt; just as it didn’t change schoolteacher’s mind. “Did you steal that shoat? You stole that shoat.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Halle	Pick me up on her way back. I believe she would a done that if I was to ask her. I never did, ’cause that’s the only day [MASK] and me had with sunlight in it for the both of us to see each other by.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Baby	It wasn’t white-folks—that much she could tell—so it must be colored ones. And then she knew. Her friends and neighbors were angry at her because she had overstepped, given too much, offended them by excess. [MASK] closed her eyes.
<name>Ol' Dan</name>	Ol' Dan	Buglar	I could have used that. I tied [MASK] when we had all that pork to smoke. Fire everywhere and he was getting into everything. I liked to lost him so many times. Once he got up on the well, right on it. I flew.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Janey	“It’ll be a spell, I guess, before it get took off his hands.” “He don’t plan on taking her to the law?” “Don’t seem like it. [MASK] say all he wants to know is who was the naked blackwoman standing on the porch.
<name>Bigger</name>	Bigger	Sethe	Just outside music it lay, with a cadence not like theirs. “Your woman she never fix up your hair?” was clearly a question for [MASK], since that’s who she was looking at. “My woman? You mean my mother?
<name>Boxer</name>	Boxer	Sixo	But. After the conversation about the shoat, [MASK] is tied up with the stock at night, and locks are put on bins, pens, sheds, coops, the tackroom and the barn door. There is no place to dart into or congregate.
<name>Mayella</name>	Mayella	Sethe	“It’s her, ain’t it?” “Her who?” “[MASK]. He took up with her and stayed in there and you don’t want nothing to—” “Hold on. Don’t jump if you can’t see bottom.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sethe	They would not go. Sadly, they split them down the heel, sorry indeed to ruin so valuable an item. [MASK] put on the boy’s jacket, not daring to ask whether there was any word of the children.
<name>Garbage</name>	Garbage	Cincinnati	It was three in the afternoon on a Friday so wet and hot [MASK]’s stench had traveled to the country: from the canal, from hanging meat and things rotting in jars; from small animals dead in the fields, town sewers and factories.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Denver	They remembered the party with twelve turkeys and tubs of strawberry smash. One said she wrapped [MASK] when she was a single day old and cut shoes to fit her mother’s blasted feet. Maybe they were sorry for her.
<name>she</name>	she	Beloved	Seeing how it must have looked. And the more fine points she made, the more detail she provided, the more [MASK] liked it. So she anticipated the questions by giving blood to the scraps her mother and grandmother had told her—and a heartbeat.
<name>Reba</name>	Reba	Halle	So Baby’s eight children had six fathers. What she called the nastiness of life was the shock she received upon learning that nobody stopped playing checkers just because the pieces included her children. [MASK] she was able to keep the longest. Twenty years. A lifetime.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Vashti	I say, ‘Yes’m, [MASK]. My wife. She say she owe you all some eggs. You know if she brung em? You know her if you see her. Wear a black ribbon on her neck.’ She got rosy then
<name>my husband</name>	my husband	Nan	I couldn’t have done more for that woman than I would my own ma’am if she was to take sick and need me and I’d have stayed with her till she got well or died. And I would have stayed after that except [MASK] snatched me back.
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Sixo	[MASK] is about to crawl out to look for the knives he buried. He hears something. He hears nothing. Forget the knives. Now. The three of them climb up the bank and schoolteacher, his pupils and four other whitemen move toward them. With lamps.
<name>her</name>	her	Denver	She smelled like bark in the day and leaves at night, for [MASK] would not sleep in her old room after her brothers ran away. Now her mother was upstairs with the man who had gotten rid of the only other company she had.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Sethe	a day? a day and a night?—in her lifeless body grieved her so she made the groan that made the person walking on a path not ten yards away halt and stand right still. [MASK] had not heard the walking, but suddenly she heard the standing still
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Pickaninnies	All of this was advertisement, read by those who could and heard by those who could not, and the fact that none of it was true did not extinguish their appetite a bit. The barker called them and their children names (“[MASK] free!”)
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Sethe	“Running,” [MASK] told her. It was the first word she had spoken all day and it came out thick because of her tender tongue. “Them the feet you running on? My Jesus my.”
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Beloved	“I was on the bridge,” said [MASK]. “You see me on the bridge?” “No, by the stream. The water back in the woods.” “Oh, I was in the water. I saw her diamonds down there.
