<name>Lila</name>	Lila	Fulton	She is an Intuitionist but is not a fan of the new additions to [MASK]’s work that come from overseas, are debated in the rooms below her by Intuitionism’s epigonic practitioners. They muddle through and sometimes the journals are not all empty, but she prefers her own extrapolations.
<name>Cheradenine</name>	Cheradenine	Pompey	You worry about what you got to do and I’ll worry about what I got to do.” “I’ll tell you what—after I talk to [MASK], I’ll go to Lift and try to find where their copies are.
<name>He</name>	He	John	He’s still searching for a concordance between the loss of his virginity (purchased) and an ankle sprain (accidental) exactly three years later, give or take an hour. [MASK] is sure it will come, awaiting another item in the series or a new perspective on the extant ones.
<name>Stromboli</name>	Stromboli	Arbo	To send me a message. But then I remembered the shirts and started doing some legwork.” “You found out they were [MASK].” Of course, of course. “I got out some old surveillance photos I took a few years back.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Grady	And still. [MASK] placed a trembling hand on her shoulder and it stopped trembling once he put it there, once he had a place to place it. She felt she was supposed to look at him, and did so.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Pompey	She shakes her head. [MASK] extricates his shoe from a tentacle of newspaper that’s just attacked him. “I just want to clear my name—and for you to get what belongs to you. How did you know what to do to the elevator?
<name>Travers</name>	Travers	Pompey	I need money to take them out of here.” “Why should I believe you, [MASK]?” she demands. “You’ve been just as bad as the rest of them ever since I joined the Department. Worse. Laughing at me with them.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Billy	I’m here to inspect your elevators.” [MASK] holds his paperback in the air and asks, “What’s ‘paraffin’?” “A waxy substance used in candles. Mostly. Do you want to see my badge?”
<name>Salazar</name>	Salazar	Arbo	“The pictures are here somewhere,” he says. “Here they are.” He flips through a stack of glossies. “I found the men pretty quickly. That’s them leaving the office with the rest of [MASK]’s muscle. Right there.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	John	Something in the bones, and inherited, [MASK] decides after an appraisal of her mother. Children are doomed to reiterate the mistakes in their parents’ physiognomies, as if trapped by curses that mark generations and wait for unknowable acts of atonement.
<name>Fontaine</name>	Fontaine	Fulton	She mastered his hand, its reticent parabolas and botched vowels. Here it is now, on the familiar notebook paper [MASK] preferred. She tracked down the manufacturer once; they have a plant across the river where they still turn out the Fontaine line.
<name>Plants</name>	Plants	Ants	As we did when we lived in bubbles. Sentient insofar as we knew it was warm: Silence provided that warmth. The womb. [MASK] have it easy for speaking in chemicals. Food. Flight. Follow. Nouns and verbs only, and never in concert.
<name>Interpol</name>	Interpol	IAB	“Now why don’t you get away from my stoop before I get on the phone to [MASK] and tell them that their public enemy number one has finally shown up?” He glances quickly up and down the street to see which of his neighbors is cataloging this incident.
<name>They</name>	They	Prey	The animals don’t move. Men and women in conservative businesswear keep their distance as they navigate the plaza, towards subways and watering holes and lunch establishments. [MASK], afraid deep in the strata of their consciousness of the predator’s waking, improbable and impending.
<name>Brer</name>	Brer	Hambone	Say, you evah hear de one about de fine genimun?” “What fine genimun dat be?” “Dis fine genimun is walking home late one night when he come on dis nigguh lying down on de street.” “Do say, [MASK].
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Jim	But I know it was another one of your mendacities because I can see your watch right there, right below where [MASK] is holding your wrist. And that’s the worst lie of all, because when a stranger asks you the time, you should never lie.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Fulton	There ain’t much to do out here, but you don’t have to think about some kid knocking you over the head for your money.” “You were friends then, you and [MASK].” “I worked for him and we became friends.
<name>Apple</name>	Apple	United	“They’re in bad shape, that’s for sure. Overseas sales down forty-five percent, domestic thirty. Ever since their Jupiter line never took off and [MASK] came back swinging. Got it!” he says, returning to his desk.
<name>Amara</name>	Amara	Natchez	[MASK] is new to the city and she remembers her first slow steps on this concrete, looking up at the scuffed knees of the structures girding above her. (The very same buildings that at this moment accelerate sunset.
<name>Hannibal</name>	Hannibal	Johnny	Because if you really did know—didn’t just cook something up from what you picked up in the tabloids or god forbid the movies—you would have never ever, ever, ever done anything to make [MASK] angry. You would have known better.
<name>Galadriel</name>	Galadriel	Chancre	“I’m glad to hear it,” [MASK] says brightly. “You have a great future ahead of you, I can see that. If only you don’t misstep. And it’s easy to take a wrong step.”
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Marvin	Beyond the shaft the people hustle on their angry ant errands, a legion of impulse and need. [MASK] wears the same uniform he has worn for too many years now, a red double-breasted lackey’s getup that radiates threads here and there and strains against his burgeoning belly.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Marberley	“No, it’s a checkup. [MASK] wrote it up for some violations a few weeks ago.” She’s in her car five minutes later, uptown in her room at the Friendly League Residence half an hour later. This is the smallest room yet.
<name>Easy</name>	Easy	John	She can envision [MASK] mangled at the bottom of the stairs, where all the rough trade ends up. Unless, she thinks, he kills the gorillas or incapacitates them, distracts them with two slabs of raw beef. He is the only colored gentleman waiting to dance.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Natchez	She’s just reached the end of her conversational props. [MASK] doesn’t mind. “I’ll see you tomorrow then,” he says. “My uncle, he’s still sick.” “What’s wrong with him?”
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Chuck	Or that you were afraid to come in because of what the papers have been saying. He’ll listen.” “[MASK], I want you to get close to him. I need to know what else he’s got and what Forensics has to say.”
<name>Jackson</name>	Jackson	Ben	We could be taking you out to dump you in a landfill for all they know, and they just keep on driving. They’re more concerned about their lackluster driving skills than their fellow man.” [MASK] looks up groggily at the rearview mirror.
<name>Godzilla</name>	Godzilla	IAB	He taps the light ash from his cigar and takes a deep drag. “You can tell them about me. Call the cops or [MASK], whatever you want. I’m gonna be here on this stoop until I finish this here cigar I got.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Natchez	She told me her brother ran away when he was sixteen and she never saw him after that.” Her hand grasps the photograph of him and [MASK]’s mother and grandmother. “All this time,” she murmurs. To turn his back on these two women.
<name>Trillian</name>	Trillian	Chuck	[MASK] starts whispering and she can see him turning away from the Pit to hide the receiver. “Where have you been?” he whines. “Things are going crazy around here.” “I’ve been around.” “Everyone’s been asking where you are.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Chancre	“Did you see [MASK]’s last statement? I’ll try my memory . . . ‘My opponent and his cronies have been trying all sorts of tactics since the start of the campaign, but I think this incident says more about their tomfoolery than any of their dirty tricks.’ ”
<name>slowly</name>	slowly	gradual	I’m not like the rest of the fellas, though. I’m all for your people. You might not think so, but I am. I’m all for colored progress, but [MASK]. You can’t do everything overnight—that would be chaos.”
<name>Yaa</name>	Yaa	Brute	Everything is there. She thinks, these white men see her as a threat but refuse to make her a threat, cunning, duplicitous. They see her as a mule, ferrying information back and forth, not clever or curious enough to explore the contents. [MASK].
<name>Lovecraft</name>	Lovecraft	Fulton	but he never gets invited to conferences and his monographs wilt on the shelves of his relatives’ libraries. Did it decide to pass? To lie and betray itself? Even [MASK] stayed away from the horror of the catastrophic accident: even in explicating the unbelievable he never dared broach the unknowable.
<name>Junior</name>	Junior	Pompey	He be doing nuttin all naht long but tekkin’ me upstairs an trowing me down de elevator shaft!’ ” Even though she knows what she will see, she looks over at [MASK]. His mouth is cracked open with laughter. He slaps the table and shakes his head.
<name>he</name>	he	Natchez	“Got it right here.” She’s relieved that [MASK] does not start talking again. Not that she does not like what he says, but it is too much for her in this tiny car, and so quickly after so much time.
<name>Griggs</name>	Griggs	Arbergast	“You can leave anytime you want,” [MASK] grants, rubbing his lips with his sleeve. “But if you want to help your friend, you might think about helping me out with some things that are bothering me.” He waves his sandwich nowhither.
<name>Blue</name>	Blue	John	Calculates her lead on [MASK]: not much. She jumps right, into a doorway that opens up to steps. Wants to get out of plain sight before he reaches the street. Too bad it’s only a few doors down from the Lift building and an obvious refuge.
<name>Nell</name>	Nell	Fulton	Once they break [MASK]’s code and hieroglyphics, which should take them a long time without the key she possesses, the elevator should hold them for a while. It is not perfect but it’s pretty good. She particularly likes the cab design, which takes care of engineering necessity without sacrificing passenger comfort.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Ned	“You think that’s gross, [MASK] my good man, let me tell you about the first time I ever saw the bastards. My first month out— this is Before the Code, I’ll have you know, and the Department didn’t even have the motor pool yet.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Natchez	“Are you sure they’re in the Department? They might have taken them somewhere.” “I’ll find them,” [MASK] says. “If they’re there, I’ll find them, and if they’re somewhere else, I’ll find where that place is.
<name>Edison</name>	Edison	Arbo	He instructs the receptionist to let her pass. The carpet is pliant under her feet, chewing up those brogues of hers. In the hallway she passes a display case containing a miniature replica of [MASK]’s first machine, the Excelsior.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Huntley	If the other elevator operators in [MASK]’s trade in this kind of gossip, and if he has heard that way, the phone in the hallway outside her apartment ringing and her not there to talk to him. She says dully, “You don’t want to hear about that.
<name>Vertigo</name>	Vertigo	Natchez	She will keep the city vertical and intact, and the city will leave her alone. And now look at her: she let the city down last Friday, was remiss in her duties, and look at the metropolis’s retribution. It has given her [MASK].
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Chancre	He says, “[MASK]’s holding a press conference from his hospital bed tonight. I’m sure he’ll address the Fulton rumors— everyone knows about the black box at this point. But we’ll take care of it. I’ll take care of it.”
<name>Cortázar</name>	Cortázar	Urich	He flips the dime in the air, as is his habit, but he’s not used to his left hand yet. He misses the silver on its descent and it rolls away into the darkness. “What are you trying to tell me, [MASK].
<name>Salander</name>	Salander	Fulton	It turned out [MASK] was just trying to add up his dry cleaning bill. He put all kinds of shit in there. So, no, at first your name being in his notebooks didn’t mean anything in and of itself, but the guys upstairs wanted us to follow up every lead.”
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Ben	Indeed the velocity has increased. These men and their boss are why his expost; did not run. “Yes, I do,” [MASK] says. Best to play along and escape this night with his hide intact. He knows the drill.
<name>Alabama</name>	Alabama	Natchez	[MASK]?” “That’s where my mama’s from,” he replies. He leans against the door. “She didn’t like it enough to stay there, but she liked it enough to name me after it. She still wants to hear people say it.”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Pompey	“It’s one-way.” “Then you’ll have to follow him on foot until I can get into position on the next avenue. He knows me, but he doesn’t know you.” [MASK] does not turn down the street.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Arbergast	“She deserved it.” “Deserves got nothing to do with it,” [MASK] grunts. “One of the stack crashes, coincidentally just as the Mayor is about to take a test drive. That makes it a high-profile mess-up.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Hardwick	Whiteness throbs behind the opaque glass and he hears grunting. [MASK] shouldn’t be here this late, but then liquor stores aren’t open on Sunday and perhaps he needed to retrieve a bottle of whiskey from his office stash.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Natchez	and I didn’t have no money for a decent place. 1 mean—I didn’t have any money for a decent room.” “You don’t have to act any way for me, [MASK].” He’s taken the only chair in the room.
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Natchez	If he considers his position and place, his face does not betray it. They walk toward the parlor, [MASK] trailing a step behind her. She wants him parallel, equal. “Your uncle is still sick?” she asks.
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	John	She is trying to convince other people that she lives here, but the impression instead is that of slow moving-out, piece by piece. Nothing rattles in the piggy bank. “This place must get a lot of light,” [MASK] says.
<name>Ylvis</name>	Ylvis	Otis	They can barely make sense of the cities they have now. The ones [MASK] gave them. They bump into each other going through doors and execute ridiculous pratfalls. He wants to be there now, in the places they will build when they have the perfect elevator.
<name>Tayber</name>	Tayber	Fulton	“[MASK] was my uncle.” * * * The boy dreams of places that are not like this, where there is no mud and there is pavement, where there are not wood walls that don’t keep the cold out but buildings that erupt from the ground like ancient gods awakening.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Chuck	His students should be acquainted with the entire body of elevator knowledge, not just the canon. [MASK] feels his future in the Guild is assured. For now, in one ear and out the other with all the “tread jockey” jokes.
<name>Wrigley</name>	Wrigley	Bogart	The admission of colored students to the Institute for Vertical Transport was staggered to prevent overlap and any possible fulminations or insurrections that might arise from that overlap. The previous tenant of the janitor’s closet had had a sweet tooth. Every cleaning produced yet another crumpled wrapper of [MASK]’s Chewing Gum.
<name>Leopold</name>	Leopold	Pompey	(She adopted a circuitous route to avoid [MASK]’s table: she doesn’t want to press her masquerade, but considers strychnine. He drinks copiously. He is not one of those grabbing at the white cigarette girls’ gams. He knows better than that.)
<name>Jedediah</name>	Jedediah	Jim	Children are doomed to reiterate the mistakes in their parents’ physiognomies, as if trapped by curses that mark generations and wait for unknowable acts of atonement. [MASK]’s parents are obviously close kin, and if you ask him he won’t deny it.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Lever	[MASK] is a perennial sapling despite his gray hair and loose neck-flesh. There is room at his cuffs, his collar, and his pants drape deflated off small knees. She cannot remember if he looked this wasted the last time she saw him, but that was before the campaign.
<name>Thaddeus</name>	Thaddeus	Fulton	His skin. Picture this: [MASK], the Great Reformer, the steady man at the helm of the Department of Elevator Inspectors, gives up his chair when the elevator companies try to buy his favor, place him in their advertisements.
<name>Yamazaki</name>	Yamazaki	Chancre	Homs, boiling cysts, the occasional cussword inked in across [MASK]’s slat teeth—they add up after a while, somehow more personal and meaningful than the usual cartoons and pinups of office homesteading. No one notices them but they’re there, nearinvisible, and count for something.
<name>She</name>	She	Chancre	“I can go?” “We’ll even give you a ride. Aren’t a lot of buses around here.” She hears the door open behind her. [MASK] stands. “So we understand each other, right?”
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Natchez	Not that she does not like what he says, but it is too much for her in this tiny car, and so quickly after so much time. She had entered into a contract with the city similar to the one she has lately arranged with [MASK].
<name>Marco</name>	Marco	Freeport	The street noise returned to them after a few minutes’ reprieve, through the open window, marching across the dirty green blinds: honks, catcalls, collisions. The city’s raspberry. She saw the bathroom and its cold tile: [MASK] was drying three pairs of exhausted socks on the shower rod.
<name>McGonagall</name>	McGonagall	IAB	“If you really want to help ... if you’re not going to take my advice and talk to [MASK], it’s best if you just stay out of sight. I’ll have more information in a few days and we can talk about it then.”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Sven	The man whose house she sits in front of now, with a man who does not speak in the driver’s seat. [MASK] breathes heavily through his mouth like a horse. The tap at the window startles her.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Fulton	“It’s [MASK]’s notebook. It’s what you’ve been looking for.” “Why?” “I just wanted to help,” she says. On her way to the elevator, she considers for a moment breaking the glass protecting the small Arbo Excelsior.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	James	He starts fussing and telling me to go out to the store—suddenly he got to have fish for dinner. So I leave, and when I get back, she’s gone and [MASK] is sitting in his study reading his journals like nothing’s strange.
<name>Leclerc</name>	Leclerc	Erlich	Possessed the usual spectrum of elevator emotion, yes, but did it have articulate self-awareness. [MASK], the mad Frenchman, of course, posited such but he never gets invited to conferences and his monographs wilt on the shelves of his relatives’ libraries.
<name>Willoughby</name>	Willoughby	Kwicky	One item looked promising—a copy of [MASK]’s Weekly Crossword, with two-thirds of the puzzles attempted to varying degrees of completeness and accuracy. But despite my best efforts, I could not find any hidden messages or other concealed meanings in the puzzles.
<name>Lucien</name>	Lucien	Fulton	There’s a dumbwaiter in the kitchen. A primitive hand elevator containing all the principles of verticality. She hears rocks scraping. When the old woman returns, she holds a stack of notebooks, [MASK]’s cherished Fontaines, wrapped loosely in a shred of stained leather.
<name>Malcolm</name>	Malcolm	James	One day he’s off giving a speech and one of them comes in here, some dried-up old white boy, comes into my kitchen and tells me ‘they’d appreciate it if I kept them informed’ about [MASK]’s coming and goings and what he does in his room at night.
<name>Zeus</name>	Zeus	Arbo	She has always considered herself an atheist, not realizing she had a religion. Anyone can start a religion. They just need the need of others. They haven’t made much headway into the mess left, presumably, by [MASK] and their bruiser army.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Natchez	The progress of their scheme: [MASK] hadn’t developed his film of the Intuitionist pages because he had never taken any photographs; he had been studying them all along. Tried to keep her from going to the Lift building for fear she might discover their plan.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Fulton	[MASK] was colored. In his books, the hatred of the corrupt order of this world, the keen longing for the next one, its next rules. He was the perfect liar the world made him, mouthing a supreme fiction the world accepted as truth.
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Pompey	You’d go to jail to protect them, after all they’ve done to you?” He pulls his suspenders off his flesh as if they were chains, lets them snap back. [MASK] holds his cigar in front of his eyes and stares at the smoldering red tip.
<name>Carlo</name>	Carlo	Shush	Trying to come off like mob guys, but I knew they weren’t mob. Could tell by the shirts. They were corporate boys, wore the downtown uniform right down to their cotton oxford shirts. Mob guys, [MASK]’s boys, they got their own style.
<name>Clarence</name>	Clarence	Pompey	I’m really tired of people telling me lies. I’m through kidding with you people.” “ ‘You people’? And just what people would that be?” “You don’t have to shuffle for me, [MASK]. I know your game.”
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Arbergast	It complicates things, all this interdepartmental paperwork you guys cause.” “If the higher-ups would recognize that escalators are just as important for speedy conveyance as elevators, there wouldn’t be such headaches all the time.” [MASK] inspects the soft brown matter beneath his fingernail and eats it.
<name>China</name>	China	Arbo	Sometimes in her new room she wonders who will decode the elevator first. It could be [MASK]. It could be United. It doesn’t matter. Like the election, their petty squabbling feeds the new thing that is coming. In its own way, it prepares them.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Natchez	On the dresser, a soft pyramid, was another note from [MASK]. Hope you. enjoyed yourself, he wrote, and included a phone number. She introduced the note to its older brother in a wallet nook.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	McKean	No one asked him for details, there were rumors of course, but no one asked him and he did not speak of it. [MASK] was tall and gaunt, with gray hair still grazed down to a military buzz. Gray hair even though he was still quite young.
<name>the party</name>	the party	Chuck	He’ll help you out. You’re one of us.” She considers, for a second or two, if they’ve gotten to [MASK]. It could be any number of parties. But she has called him because she trusts him, and she needs that trust.
<name>Rearden</name>	Rearden	Chancre	“If they don’t have it, they don’t control it. Suppose it’s not Intuitionism-based. Suppose, for the sake of argument, it’s Empirical. Or it’s Intuitionist but [MASK] finds it first with his Shush and United muscle and keeps it under wraps.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Lever	That’s probably a more constructive use of your time than worrying yourself over these matters.” [MASK] nods and gathers his speech. “Yes, yes,” he agrees sleepily, “You’re right. I’ll be upstairs if you need me.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Chuck	he whines. “Things are going crazy around here.” “I’ve been around.” “Everyone’s been asking where you are. Are you alright?” “I’m fine. [MASK].” “This place is a madhouse!”
<name>Hitchcock</name>	Hitchcock	Fulton	“By leaving the camera there, you’ve created what [MASK] calls ‘the expectation of freight.’ The camera is a passenger who declines to get on the elevator, not a phantom passenger. The film would record that the doors open, the elevator waits, and then the doors close.”
<name>Wilder</name>	Wilder	Chancre	Of course the city has never answered [MASK]’s repeated requests for sirens. No one outside the Guild seems to think they’re necessary for some reason. Over the radio, one of the WCAM sentries ahead comments on how long it’s taking the emergency techs to remove the children from the schoolbus.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Pompey	She has never thought of herself as an imposing person (that’s how little self-perception she has), but he is new to the city and maybe that explains it. “I think I know why [MASK] went to that building last night,” she says.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Fulton	Boiling water. What did [MASK] say as she remade his house. Too far gone to notice the world around him, or too intent on his black box to care about the shells of things. The appearance of matter.
<name>Tristero</name>	Tristero	Fulton	The biggest problem, she finds, is nailing [MASK]’s voice as it appears in Volume Three of Theoretical Elevators, as opposed to the arid academic voice of Volume One and the aimless mystic voice of Volume Two. The rhythms of the first two books have been scored into her brain.
<name>Waldo</name>	Waldo	John	[MASK] needs patterns, and labors after them even when circumstances betray him. Because there must be patterns, experience is recursive, and if the pattern has not announced itself yet, it will, eloquent and emphatic in a mild-mannered sort of way.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Junior	I ran out that room, shut the door behind me and got the hell out of there. Hours later I still had roaches crawling out of my pockets. I don’t know what happened to [MASK]. Maybe the little black bastards ate him.”
<name>Atwood</name>	Atwood	Fulton	It’s a miracle she lives there, how accustomed she is to this small world. How small her expectations are. Which part of [MASK]’s writing affected her most? The first line that comes to her head is an incandescent flare: There is another world beyond this one.
<name>Rocco</name>	Rocco	Chancre	She pulled her suitcase from under the bed and packed again, this time for a much longer stay. She did not know when she would be back. After last night, there was no telling when the Shush boys would be back to enforce [MASK]’s threat.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Rick	The band gets a lot of gigs on account of [MASK]’s preternatural resemblance to a popular singer and matinee idol. He is not above stealing some of that singer’s more famous moves, like he is now, cradling the microphone stand as if it were some swooning lass, petting invisible blonde hair.
<name>Angels</name>	Angels	Arbo	[MASK] cannot fill the entire building, but they’ve got dibs on the top floors. It keeps them on their toes: no matter how high they are, the sky still distracts and reminds that there is always higher.
