<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Mildred	[MASK]’s hand had frozen behind the pillow. Her fingers were tracing the book’s outline and as the shape became familiar her face looked surprised and then stunned. Her mouth opened to ask a question. . . .
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Montag	He and the white plaster walls inside were much the same. There was white in the flesh of his mouth and his cheeks and his hair was white and his eyes had faded, with white in the vague blueness there. Then his eyes touched on the book under [MASK]’s arm
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Mildred	“[MASK], do you know that girl I was telling you about?” “What girl?” She was almost asleep. “The girl next door.” “What girl next door?” “You know, the high-school girl.
<name>The Giver</name>	The Giver	Faber	His hands stayed on his knees, numbed and useless. “I don’t talk things, sir,” said [MASK]. “I talk the meaning of things. I sit here and know I’m alive.” That was all there was to it, really.
<name>his eye</name>	his eye	Montag	The light from the overhead lamps seemed as bright and revealing as the midday sun and just as hot. He listened to the sound of the car picking up speed two blocks away on his right. Its movable headlights jerked back and forth suddenly, and caught at [MASK].
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Montag	“You are!” “/am?” “You’re mad!” “Why would I be mad!” “Because!” “That’s all very well,” cried [MASK], “but what are they mad about? Who are these people?
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Montag	The gas was being pumped outside. The men in the beetles were talking and the attendants were talking about the engines, the gas, the money owed. [MASK] stood trying to make himself feel the shock of the quiet statement from the radio, but nothing would happen.
<name>He</name>	He	Montag	His lips were scalded, but that was good. The faces around him were bearded, but the beards were clean, neat, and their hands were clean. They had stood up as if to welcome a guest, and now they sat down again. [MASK] sipped.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Montag	“[MASK], old men who stay at home, afraid, tending their peanut-brittle bones, have no right to criticize. Yet you almost killed things at the start. Watch it! I’m with you, remember that. I understand how it happened.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Granger	Something must be wrong with me.” “Listen,” said [MASK], taking his arm, and walking with him, holding aside the bushes to let him pass. “When I was a boy my grandfather died, and he was a sculptor.
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Montag	“Goodbye.” “Goodbye. . . o o o One two three four five six seven days: the firehouse. “[MASK], you shin that pole like a bird up a tree.” Third day.
<name>Dean</name>	Dean	Mildred	The gasoline refugee. Towns turn into motels, people in nomadic surges from place to place, following the moon tides, living tonight in the room where you slept this noon and I the night before.” [MASK] went out of the room and slammed the door.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Montag	and . . . my uncle . . . and . . . my uncle . . .” Her voice faded. [MASK] turned and looked at his wife, who sat in the middle of the parlor talking to an announcer, who in turn was talking to her.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Mildred	He’s right. Happiness is important. Fun is everything. And yet I kept sitting there saying to myself, I’m not happy, I’m not happy.” “I am.” [MASK]’s mouth beamed. “And proud of it.”
<name>David</name>	David	Montag	On one wall a woman smiled and drank orange juice simultaneously. How does she do both at once, thought [MASK], insanely. In the other walls an X ray of the same woman revealed the contracting journey of the refreshing beverage on its way to her delighted stomach!
<name>Beatty</name>	Beatty	Montag	Didn’t I hint enough when I sent the Hound around your place?” [MASK]’s face was entirely numb and featureless; he felt his head turn like a stone carving to the dark place next door, set in its bright border of flowers.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Montag	The air over and above the vast concrete river trembled with the warmth of [MASK]’s body alone; it was incredible how he felt his temperature could cause the whole immediate world to vibrate. He was a phosphorescent target; he knew it, he felt it.
<name>Ed</name>	Ed	Montag	.. watch for a man alone, on foot. . . watch . . .” [MASK] pulled back in the shadows. Directly ahead lay a gas station, a great chunk of porcelain snow shining there, and two silver beetles pulling in to fill up.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Montag	Their faces grew haunted with silence. They leaned forward at the sound of [MASK]’s swallowing his final bite of food. They listened to his feverish breathing. The three empty walls of the room were like the pale brows of sleeping giants now, empty of dreams.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Faber	Quick victory is ours if the war comes. . . .” Music flooded over the voice quickly and it was gone. “Ten million men mobilized,” [MASK]’s voice whispered in his other ear. “But say one million. It’s happier.”
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Beatty	“What a dreadful surprise,” said [MASK]. “For everyone nowadays knows, absolutely is certain, that nothing will ever happen to me. Others die, I go on. There are no consequences and no responsibilities. Except that there are.
<name>an exam</name>	an exam	Beatty	But he read and the worlds fell through, and he thought, in a few hours, there will be [MASK], and here will be me handing this over, so no phrase must escape me, each line must be memorized. I will myself to do it.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Faber	Someone who may have been a friend was burnt less than twenty-four hours ago. You’re the only one I knew might help me. To see. To see . . .” [MASK]’s hands itched on his knees. “May I?”
<name>him</name>	him	Montag	He walked out of the house into the rain. o o o The rain was thinning away and the girl was walking in the center of the sidewalk with her head up and the few drops falling on her face. She smiled when she saw [MASK].
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Montag	He crouched and then he sat and the voice of the front door spoke again, more insistently. [MASK] picked a single small volume from the floor. “Where do we begin?” He opened the book halfway and peered at it.
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Montag	The other firemen waited behind him, in the darkness, their faces illumined faindy by the smoldering foundation. [MASK] started to speak twice and then finally managed to put his thought together. “Was it my wife turned in the alarm?”
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Mildred	Under the doorsill, a slow, probing sniff, an exhalation of electric steam. [MASK] laughed. “It’s only a dog, that’s what! You want me to shoo him away?” “Stay where you are!” Silence. The cold rain falling.
<name>Frost</name>	Frost	Granger	The difference between the man who just cuts lawns and a real gardener is in the touching, he said. The lawn-cutter might just as well not have been there at all; the gardener will be there a lifetime.” [MASK] moved his hand.
<name>Beetle</name>	Beetle	Montag	She glanced nervously at the long emptiness of the walls enclosing them. “[MASK], go through with this and I’ll cut off, I’ll leave.” The beetle jabbed his ear. “What good is this, what’ll you prove!”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Montag	His eyes watered. The thing that had saved him was falling flat. The driver of that car, seeing [MASK] down, instinctively considered the probability that running over a body at such a high speed might turn the car upside down and spill them out.
<name>Casey</name>	Casey	Montag	It’s like a lesson in ballistics. It has a trajectory we decide on for it. It follows through. It targets itself, homes itself, and cuts off. It’s only copper wire, storage batteries, and electricity.” [MASK] swallowed.
<name>Faber</name>	Faber	Faber	The only thing I positively knew was gone was the books I’d burned in ten or twelve years. So I thought books might help.” “You’re a hopeless romantic,” said [MASK]. “It would be funny if it were not serious.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Helen	When it comes time for the missing lines, they all look at me out of the three walls and I say the lines. Here, for instance, the man says, ‘What do you think of this whole idea, [MASK]?’
<name>Hugh</name>	Hugh	Montag	Even though our rule book claims it was founded earlier. The fact is we didn’t get along well until photography came into its own. Then—motion pictures in the early twentieth century. Radio. Television. Things began to have mass!' [MASK] sat in bed, not moving.
<name>Ma’s</name>	Ma’s	Beatty	“See what you’re doing? You’ll ruin us! Who’s more important, me or that Bible?” She was beginning to shriek now, sitting there like a wax doll melting in its own heat. He could hear [MASK]’s voice.
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Montag	In all the rush and fervor, [MASK] had only an instant to read a line, but it blazed in his mind for the next minute as if stamped there with fiery steel. “Time has fallen asleep in the afternoon sunshine.” He dropped the book.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Montag	walk on water with your books. Well, the world can get by just fine without them. Look where they got you, in slime up to your lip. If I stir the slime with my little finger, you’ll drown!” [MASK] could not move.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Beatty	He began to put on his clothes, moving restlessly about the bedroom. “Yes, and it might be a good idea. Before I hurt someone. Did you hear [MASK]? Did you listen to him? He knows all the answers. He’s right.
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Montag	“You should’ve gone two hours ago. I just noticed.” “It’s not just the woman that died,” said [MASK]. “Last night I thought about all that kerosene I’ve used in the past ten years. And I thought about books.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Montag	They were like a monstrous crystal chandelier tinkling in a thousand chimes, he saw their Cheshire cat smiles burning through the walls of the house, and now they were screaming at each other above the din. [MASK] found himself at the parlor door with his food still in his mouth.
<name>Marilu Henner</name>	Marilu Henner	Simmons	All of us have photographic memories, but spend a lifetime learning how to block off the things that are really in there. [MASK] here has worked on it for twenty years and now we’ve got the method down to where we can recall anything that’s been read once.
<name>Jake</name>	Jake	Mildred	“Wasn’t he a European?” “Something like that.” “Wasn’t he a radical?” “I never read him.” “He was a radical.” [MASK] fiddled with the telephone.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Montag	These men who looked steadily into their platinum igniter flames as they lit their eternally burning black pipes. They and their charcoal hair and soot-colored brows and bluish-ash-smeared cheeks where they had shaven close; but their heritage showed. [MASK] started up, his mouth opened.
<name>Mildred</name>	Mildred	Mildred	He carried the books into the backyard and hid them in the bushes near the alley fence. For tonight only, he thought, in case she decides to do any more burning. He went back through the house. “[MASK]?”
<name>The Phoenix</name>	The Phoenix	Man	He must have been first cousin to [MASK]. But every time he burnt himself up he sprang out of the ashes, he got himself born all over again. And it looks like were doing the same thing, over and over, but we’ve got one damn thing the Phoenix never had.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Beatty	[MASK] nodded. “But her friends turned in an alarm earlier, that I let ride. One way or the other, you’d have got it. It was pretty silly, quoting poetry around free and easy like that. It was the act of a silly damn snob.
<name>Meursault</name>	Meursault	Harris	“Walk carefully. Guard your health. If anything should happen to [MASK], you are the Book of Ecclesiastes. See how important you’ve become in the last minute!” “But I’ve forgotten!” “No, nothing’s ever lost.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Montag	The men walked clumsily to the door. They glanced back at [MASK], who stood near the woman. “You’re not leaving her here?” he protested. “She won’t come.” “Force her, then!”
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Granger	The sun was touching the black horizon with a faint red tip. The air was cold and smelled of a coming rain. Silently, [MASK] arose, felt of his arms and legs, swearing, swearing incessantly under his breath, tears dripping from his face.
<name>Solomon</name>	Solomon	Denham	They toil not— “[MASK]’s—” Consider the lilies of the field, shut up, shut up. “Dentifrice!” He tore the book open and flicked the pages and felt of them as if he were blind, he picked at the shape of the individual letters, not blinking.
<name>Joshua</name>	Joshua	Montag	The helicopters were closer, a great blowing of insects to a single light source. With an effort, [MASK] reminded himself again that this was no fictional episode to be watched on his run to the river; it was in actuality his own chess game he was witnessing, move by move.
<name>Ethan</name>	Ethan	Montag	[MASK] felt the slow stir of words, the slow simmer. And when it came his turn, what could he say, what could he offer on a day like this, to make the trip a little easier? To everything there is a season. Yes.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Montag	The house was silent. [MASK] approached from the rear, creeping through a thick night-moistened scent of daffodils and roses and wet grass. He touched the screen door in back, found it open, slipped in, moved across the porch, listening.
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Montag	What do you think, [MASK]?” “I think I was blind trying to go at things my way, planting books in firemen’s houses and sending in alarms.” “You did what you had to do. Carried out on a national scale, it might have worked beautifully.
<name>Mrs. Prothero</name>	Mrs. Prothero	Mildred	You drowned in music and pure cacophony. He came out of the room sweating and on the point of collapse. Behind him, [MASK] sat in her chair and the voices went on again: “Well, everything will be all right now,” said an “aunt.”
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Mildred	“What good is this, what’ll you prove!” “Scare hell out of them, that’s what, scare the living daylights out!” [MASK] looked at the empty air. “Now, Guy, just who are you talking to?”
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Montag	It listens! If you put it in your ear, [MASK], I can sit comfortably home, warming my frightened bones, and hear and analyze the firemens world, find its weaknesses, without danger. I’m the Queen Bee, safe in the hive.
<name>she</name>	she	Clarisse	What kind of suicide would you call thatr Five, six, seven days. And, then, [MASK] was gone. He didn’t know what there was about the afternoon, but it was not seeing her somewhere in the world.
<name>Irene</name>	Irene	Beatty	“He’s muddying the waters!” “Oh, you were scared silly,” said [MASK], “for I was doing a terrible thing in using the very books you clung to, to rebut you on every hand, on every point!
<name>Bartleby</name>	Bartleby	Mildred	No matter when he came in, the walls were always talking to [MASK]. “Something must be done!” “Yes, something must be done?’ “Well, let’s not stand and talk!” “Let’s do it!”
<name>Ignatius</name>	Ignatius	Montag	What do the books say, he wonders. Oh, to scratch that itch, eh? Well, [MASK], take my word for it, I’ve had to read a few in my time, to know what I was about, and the books say nothing!
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Montag	What for}” “What for! Why!” said [MASK]. “I saw the damnedest snake in the world the other night. It was dead but it was alive. It could see but it couldn’t see. You want to see that snake?
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Montag	“No.” [MASK] gazed beyond them to the wall with the typed lists of a million forbidden books. Their names leapt in fire, burning down the years under his axe and his hose which sprayed not water but kerosene. “No.”
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Uncle	[MASK] had a mixed record; antisocial. The girl? She was a time bomb. The family had been feeding her subconscious, I’m sure, from what I saw of her school record. She didn’t want to know how a thing was done, but why.
<name>John</name>	John	Beatty	What a shame if that’s all it can ever know.” [MASK] snorted, gently. “Hell! It’s a fine bit of craftsmanship, a good rifle that can fetch its own target and guarantees the bull’s-eye every time.”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Montag	She made the empty rooms roar with accusation and shake down a fine dust of guilt that was sucked in their nostrils as they plunged about. It was neither cricket nor correct. [MASK] felt an immense irritation. She shouldn’t be here, on top of everything!
<name>I</name>	I	Tve	“I haven’t seen her for a few days—four days to be exact. Have you seen her?” “No.” [MASK] meant to talk to you about her. Strange.” “Oh, I know the one you mean.”
<name>Myrtle</name>	Myrtle	McClellan	[MASK]. Run over by a car. Four days ago. I’m not sure. But I think she’s dead. The family moved out anyway. I don’t know. But I think she’s dead.” “You’re not sure of it!”
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Beatty	Not that we don’t trust you, understand, but—” They all laughed. “Well,” said [MASK], “the crisis is past and all is well, the sheep returns to the fold. We’re all sheep who have strayed at times.
<name>Captain Beatty</name>	Captain Beatty	Mildred	he said. “Was I given a choice? My grandfather and father were firemen. In my sleep, I ran after them.” The parlor was playing a dance tune. “This is the day you go on the early shift,” said [MASK].
<name>John</name>	John	Montag	[MASK] did not look back at his wife as he went trembling along the hall to the kitchen, where he stood a long time watching the rain hit the windows before he came back down the hall in the gray light, waiting for the tremble to subside.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Montag	How like trying to put out fires with water pistols, how senseless and insane. One rage turned in for another. One anger displacing another. When would he stop being entirely mad and be quiet, be very quiet indeed? “Here we go!” [MASK] looked up.
<name>Shakespeare</name>	Shakespeare	Shakespeare	“Well, that’s one way to get an audience. Hold a gun on a man and force him to listen to your speech. Speech away. What’ll it be this time? Why don’t you belch [MASK] at me, you fumbling snob?
<name>Mildred</name>	Mildred	Montag	He was too late. [MASK] gasped. The woman on the porch reached out with contempt to them all, and struck the kitchen match against the railing. People ran out of houses all down the street. They said nothing on their way back to the firehouse.
<name>Fabry</name>	Fabry	Faber	“Sit down.” [MASK] backed up, as if he feared the book might vanish if he took his eyes from it. Behind him, the door to a bedroom stood open, and in that room a litter of machinery and steel tools were strewn upon a desktop.
<name>They</name>	They	Mildred	“Yes, something must be done?’ “Well, let’s not stand and talk!” “Let’s do it!” “I’m so mad I could spit?' What was it all about? [MASK] couldn’t say.
<name>Mildred</name>	Mildred	Mildred	He stared at the parlor that was dead and gray as the waters of an ocean that might teem with life if they switched on the electronic sun. “Now,” said [MASK], “my ‘family’ is people. They tell me things; I laugh, they laugh!
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Mildred	He did not open the window. He had chills and fever in the morning. “You can’t be sick,” said [MASK]. He closed his eyes over the hotness. “Yes.” “But you were all right, last night.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Faber	Then he dressed in [MASK]’s old clothes and shoes. He tossed his own clothing into the river and watched it swept away. Then, holding the suitcase, he walked out in the river until there was no bottom and he was swept away in the dark.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Faber	“One last thing. Quick. A suitcase, get it, fill it with your dirtiest clothes, an old suit, the dirtier the better, a shirt, some old sneakers and socks. . . .” [MASK] was gone and back in a minute.
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Faber	“You’re absolutely serious?” “Absolutely.” “It’s an insidious plan, if I do say so myself.” [MASK] glanced nervously at his bedroom door. “To see the firehouses burn across the land, destroyed as hotbeds of treason.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Montag	They were given the new job, as custodians of our peace of mind, the focus of our understandable and rightful dread of being inferior; official censors, judges, and executors. That’s you, [MASK], and that’s me.”
<name>He</name>	He	Montag	Even your best friends couldn’t tell if it was you. They scrambled it just enough to let the imagination take over. Hell,” he whispered. “Hell.” [MASK] said nothing but now, looking back, sat with his eyes fixed to the black screen, trembling.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Montag	The front door voiced called again softly. “Someone here....” “We won’t answer.” [MASK] lay back against the wall and then slowly sank to a crouching position and began to nudge the books, bewilderedly, with his thumb, his forefinger.
<name>Armitage</name>	Armitage	Granger	My name’s [MASK].” He held out a small bottle of colorless fluid. “Drink this, too. It’ll change the chemical index of your perspiration. Half an hour from now you’ll smell like two other people.
<name>Macbeth</name>	Macbeth	Montag	“I care so much I’m sick.” “And you won’t help me?” “Good night, good night.” [MASK]’s hands picked up the Bible. He saw what his hands had done and he looked surprised.
<name>Brain</name>	Brain	Montag	But that’s the wonderful thing about man; he never gets so discouraged or disgusted that he gives up doing it all over again, because he knows very well it is important and worth the doing.” “What do we do tonight?” asked [MASK].
<name>Valentine</name>	Valentine	Montag	No wonder books stopped selling, the critics said. But the public, knowing what it wanted, spinning happily, let the comic books survive. And the three-dimensional sex magazines, of course. There you have it, [MASK].
<name>Joey</name>	Joey	Mildred	[MASK] snatched the book with a laugh. “Here! Read this one. No, I take it back. Here’s that real funny one you read out loud today. Ladies, you won’t understand a word. It goes umpty-tumpty-ump.
<name>Beatty</name>	Beatty	Beatty	“Tomorrow. The next day maybe. First of the week.” [MASK] puffed his pipe. “Every fireman, sooner or later, hits this. They only need understanding, to know how the wheels run. Need to know the history of our profession.
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Montag	And there on the small screen was the burnt house, and the crowd and something with a sheet over it and out of the sky, fluttering, came the helicopter like a grotesque flower. So they must have their game out, thought [MASK].
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Millie	“[MASK] . . . ?” he whispered. “What?” “I didn’t mean to startle you. What I want to know is .. .” “Well?” “When did we meet? And where ?’ “When did we meet for what?"
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Granger	Darkness. “We now take you to the Sky Room of the Hotel Lux for a half hour of Just-Before-Dawn, a program of—” [MASK] turned it off. “They didn’t show the man’s face in focus. Did you notice?
<name>Mildred</name>	Mildred	Faber	Six more pages fell to the floor. He picked them up and wadded the paper under [MASK]’s gaze. “Don’t, oh, don’t!” said the old man. “Who can stop me? I’m a fireman. I can burn you!”
<name>Captain Beatty</name>	Captain Beatty	Beatty	“What is there about fire that’s so lovely? No matter what age we are, what draws us to it?” [MASK] blew out the flame and lit it again. “It’s perpetual motion; the thing man wanted to invent but never did.
<name>Mr. Bennet</name>	Mr. Bennet	Mildred	He read a dozen pages here or there and came at last to this: “‘It is computed, that eleven thousand persons have at several times suffered death rather than submit to break their eggs at the smaller end.’” [MASK] sat across the hall from him.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Faber	He felt so suddenly shocked by this that he felt [MASK] was really dead, baked like a roach in that small green capsule shoved and lost in the pocket of a man who was now nothing but a frame skeleton strung with asphalt tendons.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Montag	“It seems so remote because we have our own troubles.” “I haven’t had time to think.” [MASK] drew out a hundred dollars. “I want this to stay with you, use it any way that’ll help when I’m gone.”
<name>Clarisse</name>	Clarisse	Faber	On the way downtown he was so completely alone with his terrible error that he felt the necessity for the strange warmness and goodness that came from a familiar and gentle voice speaking in the night. Already, in a few short hours, it seemed that he had known [MASK] for a lifetime.
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Lord	“Do you know that books smell like nutmeg or some spice from a foreign land? I loved to smell them when I was a boy. [MASK], there were a lot of lovely books once, before we let them go.”
