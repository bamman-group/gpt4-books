<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Alverstoke	Or even,’ he added reflectively, ‘in her second season.’ He drew a long breath, and uttered, in reverent accents: ‘It was the other one, sir!’ ‘Yes?’ said [MASK] encouragingly, the amusement deepening in his eyes.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jessamy	Besides, he and [MASK] would be at outs within a sennight!’ ‘I see. Well, I know nothing about rearing boys, but I would do my best!’ he said heroically. She laughed, and held out her hand to him.
<name>Mr. Bennet</name>	Mr. Bennet	Augusta	‘By what I hear,’ responded [MASK] dryly, ‘he has already begun to do so. I am heartily glad of it: it has given him something to think of besides his own pleasure. I have never made any secret of my conviction that idleness has been his ruin.
<name>Mr. Carson</name>	Mr. Carson	Buddie	Her laughter bubbled up again; he smiled slightly; flicked her cheek with one careless finger; and trod down the steps to his carriage under the disapproving stare of [MASK], who was holding open the door for his young mistress, and took it upon himself to reprove her for not keeping a proper distance.
<name>Tom Sawyer</name>	Tom Sawyer	Felix	Saying that people engaged on important matters didn’t want “litde boys” under their feet. That set up [MASK]’s brisdes in a trice, I can tell you! Well, can you wonder at it?’
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Frederica	‘Too ramshackle by half!’ ‘Oh, no! I couldn’t do such a shocking thing! Perhaps, if [MASK] realises that we are unalterably determined — But she won’t give her consent! I know she won’t!’ ‘Just a moment!’
<name>her</name>	her	Charis	and I shall tell him he may do so, but must not allow [MASK] to accompany him. I am sorry for it, and should dearly love to see her, but we cannot have her sick on our hands as well!’ ‘Certainly not!’
<name>James</name>	James	Wicken	‘No, for they too wish to speak to his lordship,’ she said. She then invited the hatchetfaced lady to sit down; and [MASK], not by so much as the flicker of an eyelid betraying his emotions, held the door for the rest of the party to enter the room.
<name>Lizzy</name>	Lizzy	Charis	Not that I expect [MASK] to marry a Duke — or any nobleman, unless, of course, one offered for her! But I do expect her to make a very good marriage, if only I can contrive to have her brought out creditably!
<name>her</name>	her	Frederica	He turned towards [MASK], but before he could take his leave of her the door opened, and two ladies entered the room. He looked round, and the words of farewell died on his lips. Both ladies wore walking-dresses, but there the resemblance between them ended.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Alverstoke	he’ll never keep his hold!’ He buried his face in his hands, but raised it again, as [MASK] said coolly: ‘Yes, he will. Steady, my child! They are hauling him up fast.’
<name>Dr. John H. Watson</name>	Dr. John H. Watson	Cousin	Then he saw that she was smiling through her tears. She said simply: ‘He is asleep. The fever broke. Suddenly I saw that he was sweating, and I knew! [MASK], we’ve done the thing!’
<name>someone</name>	someone	Septimus	I think he might wish to do so.’ ‘Are you? I am tolerably certain that he wouldn’t! He would be extremely embarrassed - if he could be persuaded to undertake the task of enquiring into [MASK]’s scholarship, which I strongly doubt!
<name>Dash</name>	Dash	Wolf	‘At least, I never did so! It was a silly notion of my sisters’: I called him [MASK], when he was a puppy! But they would persist, so, in the end, he wouldn’t answer to his right name!
<name>Daphne</name>	Daphne	Charis	She told me he no sooner set eyes on [MASK] than he begged her to present him. There’s nothing unusual in that, of course, but he has become extremely particular in his attentions, and — which I think most significant!
<name>someone</name>	someone	Charis	No sense in getting into the hips! If — I mean, when she sees that you really have fixed your interest, she’ll come about!’ Another sob shook [MASK]. ‘Alas, it’s worse than you know!
<name>Lady Bracknell</name>	Lady Bracknell	Frederica	It might have been supposed that disparity of age and of intelligence would have raised a barrier between the two gentlemen. [MASK] did suppose it, but she had reckoned without one powerful factor: each was sporting-mad.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Charis	He had known many beauties, but never one as innocendy unconcerned with her appearance as [MASK]. Nor did she seem to be at all aware of the signal honour he had conferred upon her, and the surprise and the conjectures which this gave rise to.
<name>Baines</name>	Baines	Charles	A most reliable secretary, [MASK]: he would miss him damnably, but he would have to let him go. Which reminded him that he must bring him to the notice of one of the coming men of affairs.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Felix	Her entrance created a welcome interruption. His evil genius had prompted his lordship, as soon as he had shaken hands with [MASK], who was lying on the sofa, to express the hope that he would never again cause his sister to suffer so much anxiety.
<name>Peter</name>	Peter	Jessamy	‘Where is the little rascal?’ ‘Probably taking an active part in the excessively tedious preparations within the enclosure.’ ‘I hardly think he will have contrived to gain admittance, but perhaps we should go to see that he isn’t in mischief, [MASK].
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Frederica	‘Well, not precisely,’ said [MASK]. ‘At least, I don’t think so. It’s this bit, you see. It’s a very wild place, and the dog had to be smuggled out, because the natives are hostile.
<name>Lady Mary</name>	Lady Mary	Frederica	He managed to thank his lordship yet again, and then effaced himself, to spend an unprofitable hour with his books open before him but his thoughts very far away from them. ‘I should like to thank you, too,’ [MASK] said, with a warm smile, ‘but I don’t dare!
<name>Stryver</name>	Stryver	Jessamy	You never knew how [MASK] would take it, if you made game of him, and he thought it rather beneath himself to set up the boy’s bristles. Besides, he wanted to know more about the Marquis.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jessamy	[MASK] had flushed hotly, an arrested look on his face; but after a moment or two he had replied: ‘Very well, sir! I shouldn’t have said it! But — but it provoked me so much I don’t know how I could have kept my tongue between my teeth!
<name>Mr. Collins</name>	Mr. Collins	Charles	‘You are too flattering, sir!’ said [MASK] promptly. ‘I am very sure I don’t!’ ‘Well, you can’t know less!’ said his lordship, in an undervoice charged with asperity. ‘Yes, but you said you would take me yourself.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Gendy	It is far, far worse - no, not that, but -’ ‘[MASK], my child, gently!’ he said, taking her hands, and holding them in a strong clasp. ‘If I am to help you, just tell me what has happened!
<name>Miss Taylor</name>	Miss Taylor	Chloe	Which it will be, if [MASK] has formed no other attachment at the end of her second season. So do bear it in mind, I beg of you!’ He looked down at her, with his glinting smile. ‘I can’t.
<name>Bertie</name>	Bertie	Felix	[MASK]’s countenance had dropped ludicrously, but at these words it brightened, and he gave a crow of mirth. ‘Yes, they would! You’re trying to roast me! Of course they would!’ ‘Oh, dear, what a dreadful boy you are!’
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Felix	Said you were giving the ball for them. She don’t seem to like it above half, but I’ll be dashed if I know why!’ He lowered his gaze again to [MASK]’s impatient countenance, and a frown creased his brow.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Charis	Yes, and another devilish good thing would be if either of you had as much rumgumption as a couple of sparrows! Only you haven’t, and it’s my belief you never will have!’ [MASK] burst into tears.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Endymion	Let me reassure you! [MASK] was not bom without a shirt. He inherited quite an easy competence.’ Conscious of having let her annoyance betray her into a very improper speech, she said stiffly: ‘I shouldn’t have spoken as I did about your cousin.
<name>Mrs. Bennet</name>	Mrs. Bennet	Charis	My dear girl, even such a henwitted female as [MASK] could not suppose that she could be transported to the Border within an hour or two! How fortunate that she didn’t bedew the start of this hubble-bubble effusion with her tears!’
<name>Mrs. Grose</name>	Mrs. Grose	Jessamy	‘You are mistaken: he was in my charge, and mine must be the responsibility of taking care of him.’ He saw that [MASK] was looking stubborn, and added quizzically: ‘Do you think you could do that better than I could — and shall?’
<name>Mr. Collins</name>	Mr. Collins	Harry	Do you want it in detail, or will a Dutch one suffice?’ ‘No, no, of course I don’t want it in detail, sir!’ [MASK] exclaimed, ludicrously disconcerted. ‘I only meant — that is to say, you won’t forget, will you?’
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Jessamy	[MASK] blurted out. ‘My brother?’ The doctor paused in his task to direct a penetrating glance at him from under his bushy brows. ‘His brother, are you? Well, there’s no need for you to be in a stew: he hasn’t managed to kill himself!’
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Chloe	[MASK] might be ill-at-ease from mere nervousness of one whom she had been taught from her cradle to regard as an omnipotent being who must on no account be offended; but the three gendemen bore the appearance of persons detected in wrong-doing.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Frederica	Wouldn’t be at all the thing! Unless he wants to get riveted?’ ‘Well, he doesn’t. Not to my sister, at all events. She says he likes my sister [MASK] better than her — and neither of them above half.’
<name>Mr. George Knightley</name>	Mr. George Knightley	Felix	It would be marvellous indeed, you know, if [MASK] didn’t contract a very severe cold after having been exposed as he was. Therefore, my child, the most immediate need is to fetch his sister. She will know just what to do for him.’
<name>Mrs. Elton</name>	Mrs. Elton	Frederica	He then bowed with exaggerated civility, and followed [MASK] out of the room, leaving his sister and his nieces to marvel at his interest in a commonplace female (for girl no one could call her!) who had too much self-consequence, and was plainly above herself.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Frederica	If she makes a botch of it — which she won’t, for this I will say: she may be a ninny-hammer, but she has cleverer fingers than you, [MASK]! - it will keep her occupied, and out of the way of that encroaching coxcomb next door!’
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Luff	He gasped: ‘Sir — !’ but, an instant later, his countenance hardened, and he said: ‘I would like it very much, sir — but — but — I must repay you for the sum you expended to save [MASK]!’
<name>she</name>	she	Charis	She replied impulsively: ‘I don’t know how to thank you! Indeed I am satisfied!’ Her sudden smile dawned. ‘It’s my night of triumph, don’t you think? I knew [MASK] had only to be seen to be appreciated!’
<name>Brett</name>	Brett	Frederica	Then came [MASK], upsetting his cool calculations, thrusting responsibilities upon him, intruding more and more into the ordered pattern of his life, and casting him into a state of unwelcome doubt. And, try as he would, he could discover no reason for this uncomfortable change in himself.
<name>she</name>	she	Felix	You wouldn’t want to deny him such a treat! After all, love, neither he nor [MASK] grudged us ours, did they?’ ‘Oh, no, no! I didn’t mean — Of course they must go! If only I might remain here!
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Vernon	‘My dear [MASK], you should surely know by now that I never touch sherry!’ ‘Should I? But I have such a shockingly bad memory!’ ‘Not when you wish to remember anything!’ ‘Oh, no, not then!’
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Harry	She was unable to deny this, but said: ‘The more reason for her to marry a man of superior sense! Surely you must perceive — [MASK], I do beg of you not to encourage her in this nonsense! You must know what she is!
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Charis	‘Readily!’ she said, laughing. ‘So perhaps I won’t, after all, try to cut [MASK] out! As if I could!’ ‘I can think of more unlikely contingencies,’ he said. ‘Can you indeed?
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Luff	‘It wasn’t a stag at all, sir — merely a young bull, which we had not thought to be dangerous! and as for drinking its life-blood — stuff!’ ‘No, but you can’t deny that [MASK] saved you from being gored!’
<name>Meg</name>	Meg	Charis	‘What, make your first appearance in a home-made dress? Never! [MASK], if you knew for how long I have dreamed of presenting you with everything fine about you — !’ ‘You shall! I promise you shall, my darling — my best of sisters!’
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Felix	‘Except that — well, damn it, this nip-perkin don’t want to go to a ball, do you, young ’un?’ ‘No!’ said [MASK] with unnecessary emphasis. ‘I want to go to the foundry?
<name>John</name>	John	Alverstoke	He uttered his sister’s name from a parched throat and struggled to free his arms from the blankets, hurting his sprained wrist and giving a sharp cry; but when [MASK] took his other hand in a firm clasp, and spoke to him, he seemed to recognise him.
<name>Lady Stutfield</name>	Lady Stutfield	Charles	And I thought that never was anyone more aptly named, for it means “grace,” you know — from the Greek!’ ‘Thank you, [MASK],’ said his lordship meekly. ‘Where should I be without you?’
<name>the servant</name>	the servant	Curry	‘You astonish me!’ said his lordship. The writing-materials which [MASK] presently brought to him in the parlour left much to be desired, the ink being muddy, the pen in urgent need of repair, and the paper both dog-eared and a trifle grimy.
<name>Uriah</name>	Uriah	Jessamy	‘And don’t you say that it is very kind and obliging of him, sir, like [MASK], because if you don’t like a person, you don’t wish to be obliged to him!’ ‘That is very true!’
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Charis	[MASK] declared, warmly embracing her. ‘Only listen to me! I know I’m not clever, or bookish, and I don’t paint, or play the pianoforte, but even my aunt will own that I can sew!
<name>Fanny</name>	Fanny	Jane	The prospect of bringing [MASK] out at a magnificent ball for which she would not be called upon to disburse as much as a halfpenny made it easy for her to ignore his lordship’s incivility. She sat down, throwing open her olive-brown pelisse.
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Vernon	I’ll do it! Yes, I will do it! If only to bring you to our assemblies, [MASK]!’ ‘It won’t do so, my loved one: I never lay myself open to snubs!
<name>Mr. Elton</name>	Mr. Elton	Alverstoke	Upon learning from her that [MASK] had been as disobliging as she had always known he would be, he looked grave, but said that he could not be sorry, for, having thought the matter over carefully, he could not like the scheme.
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Charles	He is a very enterprising boy, you know, and there’s never any saying what he may take it into his head to do.’ ‘[MASK] will know how to keep him in order,’ he replied indifferently. She looked doubtful, but said no more.
<name>Mr. Brooke</name>	Mr. Brooke	Alverstoke	We shall never be tired of sketching there! [MASK] says that the boys may fish the trout-stream, too — I wish you might have seenjessamy, when he learned of the scheme! You wouldn’t want to deny him such a treat!
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Louisa	He arrived there to find his sister’s landaulet drawn up outside her house, and his sister, accompanied by her two elder daughters, on the point of stepping into it. ‘In the nick of time, I perceive!’ he remarked. ‘Delay your departure for five minutes, [MASK]!’
<name>Cecily</name>	Cecily	Harry	Fortifying himself with a long drink from the tankard she had just handed him, he met her anxious gaze with an engaging grin, and said: ‘Oh, I’ve been rusticated!’ ‘[MASK]! Oh, no!’ she cried, dismayed.
<name>darling</name>	darling	Frederica	Did she warn you to beware of such a sad rake as I am? You’ve nothing to fear from me, [MASK]!’ That made her give one of her chuckles. ‘Oh, I know that] I’m not nearly pretty enough!’
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Alverstoke	‘That was indeed kind of him,’ responded [MASK] gravely. ‘Yes. Well, he is kind! I mean, he never tries to bullock one, or comes the ugly if one provokes him, which I daresay most elder brothers would.’
<name>the Marquis</name>	the Marquis	Harry	‘Oh, I haven’t the smallest intention of usurping your authority!’ the Marquis assured him. ‘It isn’t so much that — well, as a matter of fact, it’s my sister who has the younger ones in charge,’ confessed [MASK].
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Charis	There, don’t let us rub against one another! I don’t mean to be unkind, but I’ve suffered too much anxiety to be able to enter into what seems to me to be such a very —’ She stopped, but [MASK] finished the sentence for her.
<name>John</name>	John	Owen	It’s not yet twelve o’clock: his lordship won’t have left the house. Tell [MASK] it is to be given into his lordship’s own hand — not left with the buder, or one of the footmen!
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Jessamy	It must be a lesson to him, though no one would have wished him to suffer so severe a punishment. I wonder, [MASK], if you would conduct me to his room? I have brought him a book to read, and a diverting puzzle.’
<name>Mr. Weller</name>	Mr. Weller	Felix	Accepting this as a compliment, [MASK] bestowed a seraphic smile upon him, and applied himself again to the pie. ‘Also,’ said his lordship, levelling his glass at the loaded plate, and slightly shuddering, ‘a bacon-picker!’
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Vernon	‘Really, [MASK], how can you be so flippant? This is not a farce!’ ‘It bears a strong resemblance to one!’ he retorted. ‘Would you think so if it concerned one of your sisters?
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Buddie	‘Now I know! I am in love!’ The youngest Merriville, bursting into the room some time later, found them seated side by side on the sofa. ‘[MASK] said I wasn’t to disturb you, but I knew that was fudge!’
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Alverstoke	He drew a deep breath of gratification, demanded of [MASK] if he wasn’t now glad they had started early, jumped down from the phaeton, and made all haste towards the scene of activity. ‘I do hope he won’t meet with a repulse!’
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Frederica	But you have never bored me.’ He possessed himself of her hands and held them firmly. ‘The only woman I have ever known who has never done so, and could never do so! I had not thought that such a woman existed, [MASK].’
<name>George</name>	George	Jessamy	From the start it had sailed to the west of the road: a circumstance which several times, when it seemed to be drawing farther westward, cast [MASK] into such a fret that it was as much as he could do to bottle up his impatience.
<name>Mr. Puff-guts</name>	Mr. Puff-guts	Wicken	No one, least of all [MASK] himself, was surprised at her capitulation, the younger park-keeper going so far as to confide, later, to his senior, that he reckoned anyone would need to have uncommon good bottom to square up to that old Puff-guts.
<name>Edmund</name>	Edmund	Jessamy	[MASK] looked to be rather struck by this, but after frowning over it for a moment, he said: ‘Yes, but — but when one has made a resolution — not to have the strength to resist temptation shows such weakness of character — doesn’t it, sir?’
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Jessamy	‘Though I may be strongly tempted to do so when he wakes up, and tries to tell me how one might propel a balloon by the use of steam!’ [MASK] laughed rather shakily, gripped his hand for an instant, and went quickly away.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Franchot	She raised her eyes to the melting blue ones so pleadingly fixed on her face, and said: ‘You would like [MASK] to copy it, I collect. But would she? I am not very sure, but I fancy that London modistes use only their own designs.’
<name>him</name>	him	Buxted	She would have agreed, however, that marriage was not for her; and had indeed told [MASK] so, when she declined his offer. She told him that she was bom to be an aunt, at which he smiled, and said: ‘You mean a sister, I think!’
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Harry	Tears sprang to her eyes; she uttered in a stricken voice: ‘Oh, [MASK], no! Not ajlirtl It was only that they were all such particular friends! How could I be unkind to anyone I’ve known all my life?
<name>Meg</name>	Meg	Charis	My sister needs several hats, you see, so we must not run mad over just one. To be sure, it’s very pretty, but, then, so is the Villager hat, with the flat crown and the flowers — only that is rather too dear as well. Come, [MASK]!
<name>Lady Bracknell</name>	Lady Bracknell	Frederica	‘Everything that is disagreeable!’ replied [MASK], laughing. ‘He thinks me sunk beneath reproach — positively a hurly-burly woman! — because I don’t take my maid with me when I go out! It is too absurd!
<name>Miss Pross</name>	Miss Pross	Frederica	That is —’ ‘Thank goodness!’ interrupted [MASK]. ‘I don’t wonder at it that you should be astonished to see me so — so heavily escorted! I’m surprised at it myself. Be so good as to tell his lordship that his cousin.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Felix	Encountering a hostile scowl, he said, with his pleasant smile: ‘How do you do? Yes, I am another bacon-brained doctor - as though you hadn’t been plagued enough already!’ The scowl vanished; [MASK] blushed, and shook hands.
<name>her</name>	her	Charis	‘True, but between gabblemongering, and casting the whole burden of maintaining conversation upon one’s companion, there is a happy medium to be struck. No, no, don’t rip up! I will allow [MASK] to be a beauty beyond compare, besides being amiable, and virtuous!
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Eliza	‘Face and figure are perfection, and her expression most winning. Impossible to find a fault! Even her carriage is graceful; and it is universally agreed that her manners are particularly pleasing.’ Startled, and considerably dismayed, [MASK] said: ‘Good gracious!
<name>Mr. Jaggers</name>	Mr. Jaggers	Alverstoke	‘Oh, no! I don’t deserve to be rewarded, sir!’ ‘You are not being rewarded: you are being commanded!’ said [MASK]. ‘A novel experience for you, young man!’
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Frederica	Unconsciously following the example [MASK] had set, he began to do her justice, trying to discover what quality in her it was which had jerked him out of his idle hedonism into a state of nagging uncertainty. It was a pleasant exercise, but it brought him no nearer to solving the problem.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Jessamy	As well that he didn’t know it, perhaps! He smiled at [MASK], and said, in a lowered voice: ‘We might have guessed he would come off with nothing worse than a couple of broken ribs, and a cut face, might we not?
<name>Madame Defarge</name>	Madame Defarge	Frederica	‘Satisfied, [MASK]?’ he enquired. She replied impulsively: ‘I don’t know how to thank you! Indeed I am satisfied!’ Her sudden smile dawned. ‘It’s my night of triumph, don’t you think?
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Charis	What a fortunate circumstance it was that [MASK] should have come home in time to make your acquaintance! ’ ‘Yes, wasn’t it?’ he retorted. ‘I might not otherwise have realised what a shocking thing it would be to keep such a diamond in the undistinguished shade!’
<name>Farfrae</name>	Farfrae	Monk	He had done so at her request. Left to himself, he would have posted down to [MASK]’s Farm immediately. He continued in this way for some time, posing questions to himself, and finding answers to them which were irrefutable, and yet afforded him little satisfaction.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Harry	For how long are you sent down?’ Since his tone held nothing but sympathetic interest, [MASK] saw no reason to take umbrage, and replied, with his frank, attractive smile: ‘Oh, only for the rest of the term, sir.
<name>Mrs. Micawber</name>	Mrs. Micawber	Eliza	‘Well, you wouldn’t call him a little boy to his face, now would you?’ ‘Of course he wouldn’t!’ said [MASK], her eyes dancing. ‘I dis-tincdy recollect that he called him, this very day, an abominable young thatchgallows!’
<name>Mrs. Gummidge</name>	Mrs. Gummidge	Alverstoke	It’s only that — You won’t leave him, will you? Oh, no! I beg pardon! I know you won’t!’ ‘You may be very sure I won’t,’ [MASK] replied, gently pushing him towards the door.
<name>Barber</name>	Barber	Jessamy	‘I’m not such a mawworm! Besides,’ he added frankly, ‘I’ll be damned if I give my head to [MASK] for washing!’ The Marquis smiled. ‘Then, I repeat, leave well alone!’
<name>they</name>	they	Cousin	‘There is nothing you can do,’ he replied. She stared rather blindly at him for a moment, but then said: ‘Nothing! You are right, of course. Nothing! I don’t even know — [MASK], where are they going?
<name>Mr. Carstairs</name>	Mr. Carstairs	Alverstoke	— Sh-showing me just how to turn a corner in style, too, and how to point the leaders, and —’ ‘My dear boy, you have already thanked me enough — too much, in fact!’ replied [MASK], rather amused.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Navenby	He doesn’t care a rush that she should be dancing with [MASK]!’ ‘True!’ he agreed. The quizzing-glass came into play again, sweeping the room until it found its object. ‘So unlike my muttonheaded cousin!’
