11231_bartleby	46	143	129	175	Bartleby	While of other law-copyists I might write the complete life, of [MASK] nothing of that sort can be done. I believe that no materials exist for a full and satisfactory biography of this man. It is an irreparable loss to literature.
11231_bartleby	50	176	152	202	Bartleby	I believe that no materials exist for a full and satisfactory biography of this man. It is an irreparable loss to literature. [MASK] was one of those beings of whom nothing is ascertainable, except from the original sources, and in his case those are very small.
11231_bartleby	47	210	203	250	Bartleby	What my own astonished eyes saw of [MASK], _that_ is all I know of him, except, indeed, one vague report which will appear in the sequel. Ere introducing the scrivener, as he first appeared to me, it is fit
11231_bartleby	48	941	914	962	Turkey	In truth they were nicknames, mutually conferred upon each other by my three clerks, and were deemed expressive of their respective persons or characters. [MASK] was a short, pursy Englishman of about my own age, that is, somewhere not far from sixty.
11231_bartleby	48	1704	1661	1709	Turkey	In the morning I but marshal and deploy my columns; but in the afternoon I put myself at their head, and gallantly charge the foe, thus!"--and he made a violent thrust with the ruler. "But the blots, [MASK]," intimated I. "
11231_bartleby	46	1834	1834	1880	Nippers	[MASK], the second on my list, was a whiskered, sallow, and, upon the whole, rather piratical-looking young man of about five and twenty. I always deemed him the victim of two evil powers--ambition and indigestion.
11231_bartleby	52	1980	1972	2024	Nippers	Though of a very ingenious mechanical turn, [MASK] could never get this table to suit him. He put chips under it, blocks of various sorts, bits of pasteboard, and at last went so far as to attempt an exquisite adjustment by final pieces of folded blotting paper.
11231_bartleby	43	2121	2084	2127	Nippers	If now he lowered the table to his waistbands, and stooped over it in writing, then there was a sore aching in his back. In short, the truth of the matter was, [MASK] knew not what he wanted.
11231_bartleby	44	2354	2325	2369	Turkey	Added to this, he always dressed in a gentlemanly sort of way; and so, incidentally, reflected credit upon my chambers. Whereas with respect to [MASK], I had much ado to keep him from being a reproach to me.
11231_bartleby	55	2558	2556	2611	Turkey	I thought [MASK] would appreciate the favor, and abate his rashness and obstreperousness of afternoons. But no. I verily believe that buttoning himself up in so downy and blanket-like a coat had a pernicious effect upon him; upon the same principle that too much oats are bad for horses.
11231_bartleby	57	3156	3146	3203	Turkey	Of a cold morning when business was but dull, [MASK] would gobble up scores of these cakes, as if they were mere wafers--indeed they sell them at the rate of six or eight for a penny--the scrape of his pen blending with the crunching of the crisp particles in his mouth.
11231_bartleby	44	3214	3204	3248	Turkey	Of all the fiery afternoon blunders and flurried rashnesses of [MASK], was his once moistening a ginger-cake between his lips, and clapping it on to a mortgage for a seal. I came within an ace of dismissing him then.
11231_bartleby	48	3388	3341	3389	Bartleby	In answer to my advertisement, a motionless young man one morning, stood upon my office threshold, the door being open, for it was summer. I can see that figure now--pallidly neat, pitiably respectable, incurably forlorn! It was [MASK].
11231_bartleby	54	3489	3471	3525	Bartleby	According to my humor I threw open these doors, or closed them. I resolved to assign [MASK] a corner by the folding-doors, but on my side of them, so as to have this quiet man within easy call, in case any trifling thing was to be done.
11231_bartleby	44	3638	3619	3663	Bartleby	Still further to a satisfactory arrangement, I procured a high green folding screen, which might entirely isolate [MASK] from my sight, though not remove him from my voice. And thus, in a manner, privacy and society were conjoined.
11231_bartleby	47	3666	3651	3698	Bartleby	And thus, in a manner, privacy and society were conjoined. At first [MASK] did an extraordinary quantity of writing. As if long famishing for something to copy, he seemed to gorge himself on my documents. There was no pause for digestion.
11231_bartleby	49	3973	3925	3974	Bartleby	It was on the third day, I think, of his being with me, and before any necessity had arisen for having his own writing examined, that, being much hurried to complete a small affair I had in hand, I abruptly called to [MASK].
11231_bartleby	58	4021	3975	4033	Bartleby	In my haste and natural expectancy of instant compliance, I sat with my head bent over the original on my desk, and my right hand sideways, and somewhat nervously extended with the copy, so that immediately upon emerging from his retreat, [MASK] might snatch it and proceed to business without the least delay.
11231_bartleby	46	4084	4068	4114	Bartleby	Imagine my surprise, nay, my consternation, when without moving from his privacy, [MASK] in a singularly mild, firm voice, replied, "I would prefer not to." I sat awhile in perfect silence, rallying my stunned faculties.
11231_bartleby	51	4128	4115	4166	Bartleby	Immediately it occurred to me that my ears had deceived me, or [MASK] had entirely misunderstood my meaning. I repeated my request in the clearest tone I could assume. But in quite as clear a one came the previous reply, "I would prefer not to."
11231_bartleby	50	4323	4301	4351	Cicero	But as it was, I should have as soon thought of turning my pale plaster-of-paris bust of [MASK] out of doors. I stood gazing at him awhile, as he went on with his own writing, and then reseated myself at my desk.
11231_bartleby	49	4390	4352	4401	Nippers	This is very strange, thought I. What had one best do? But my business hurried me. I concluded to forget the matter for the present, reserving it for my future leisure. So calling [MASK] from the other room, the paper was speedily examined.
11231_bartleby	45	4523	4522	4567	Bartleby	"[MASK]! quick, I am waiting." I heard a slow scrape of his chair legs on the uncarpeted floor, and soon he appeared standing at the entrance of his hermitage. "What is wanted?" said he mildly.
11231_bartleby	49	4706	4674	4723	Bartleby	With any other man I should have flown outright into a dreadful passion, scorned all further words, and thrust him ignominiously from my presence. But there was something about [MASK] that not only strangely disarmed me, but in a wonderful manner touched and disconcerted me.
11231_bartleby	42	4988	4965	5007	Turkey	Accordingly, if any disinterested persons are present, he turns to them for some reinforcement for his own faltering mind. "[MASK]," said I, "what do you think of this? Am I not right?"
11231_bartleby	42	5321	5320	5362	Bartleby	Meanwhile [MASK] sat in his hermitage, oblivious to every thing but his own peculiar business there. Some days passed, the scrivener being employed upon another lengthy work. His late remarkable conduct led me to regard his ways narrowly.
11231_bartleby	43	5587	5552	5595	Bartleby	Ginger-nuts are so called because they contain ginger as one of their peculiar constituents, and the final flavoring one. Now what was ginger? A hot, spicy thing. Was [MASK] hot and spicy? Not at all.
11231_bartleby	49	5686	5676	5725	Bartleby	Even so, for the most part, I regarded [MASK] and his ways. Poor fellow! thought I, he means no mischief; it is plain he intends no insolence; his aspect sufficiently evinces that his eccentricities are involuntary. He is useful to me.
11231_bartleby	49	5783	5768	5817	Bartleby	Yes. Here I can cheaply purchase a delicious self-approval. To befriend [MASK]; to humor him in his strange willfulness, will cost me little or nothing, while I lay up in my soul what will eventually prove a sweet morsel for my conscience.
11231_bartleby	52	5830	5827	5879	Bartleby	The passiveness of [MASK] sometimes irritated me. I felt strangely goaded on to encounter him in new opposition, to elicit some angry spark from him answerable to my own. But indeed I might as well have essayed to strike fire with my knuckles against a bit of Windsor soap.
11231_bartleby	51	5899	5880	5931	Bartleby	But one afternoon the evil impulse in me mastered me, and the following little scene ensued: "[MASK]," said I, "when those papers are all copied, I will compare them with you." "I would prefer not to." "How?
11231_bartleby	51	6162	6149	6200	Turkey	I think his conduct quite unusual, and indeed unjust, as regards [MASK] and myself. But it may only be a passing whim." "Ah," exclaimed I, "you have strangely changed your mind then--you speak very gently of him now."
11231_bartleby	51	6447	6398	6449	Bartleby	My blind inveteracy returned. Was there any other thing in which I could procure myself to be ignominiously repulsed by this lean, penniless wight?--my hired clerk? What added thing is there, perfectly reasonable, that he will be sure to refuse to do? "[MASK]!"
11231_bartleby	42	6508	6472	6514	Nippers	Like a very ghost, agreeably to the laws of magical invocation, at the third summons, he appeared at the entrance of his hermitage. "Go to the next room, and tell [MASK] to come to me."
11231_bartleby	51	6536	6515	6566	Bartleby	"I prefer not to," he respectfully and slowly said, and mildly disappeared. "Very good, [MASK]," said I, in a quiet sort of serenely severe self-possessed tone, intimating the unalterable purpose of some terrible retribution very close at hand.
11231_bartleby	58	6775	6765	6823	Bartleby	As days passed on, I became considerably reconciled to [MASK]. His steadiness, his freedom from all dissipation, his incessant industry (except when he chose to throw himself into a standing revery behind his screen), his great stillness, his unalterableness of demeanor under all circumstances, made him a valuable acquisition.
11231_bartleby	43	6828	6824	6867	this,--_he	One prime thing was [MASK] was always there;_--first in the morning, continually through the day, and the last at night. I had a singular confidence in his honesty. I felt my most precious papers perfectly safe in his hands.
11231_bartleby	50	6947	6931	6981	Bartleby	Now and then, in the eagerness of dispatching pressing business, I would inadvertently summon [MASK], in a short, rapid tone, to put his finger, say, on the incipient tie of a bit of red tape with which I was about compressing some papers.
11231_bartleby	49	7114	7087	7136	Turkey	One was kept by a woman residing in the attic, which person weekly scrubbed and daily swept and dusted my apartments. Another was kept by [MASK] for convenience sake. The third I sometimes carried in my own pocket. The fourth I knew not who had.
11231_bartleby	57	7324	7317	7374	Bartleby	Now, the utterly unsurmised appearance of [MASK], tenanting my law-chambers of a Sunday morning, with his cadaverously gentlemanly _nonchalance_, yet withal firm and self-possessed, had such a strange effect upon me, that incontinently I slunk away from my own door, and did as desired.
11231_bartleby	49	7461	7451	7500	Bartleby	Furthermore, I was full of uneasiness as to what [MASK] could possibly be doing in my office in his shirt sleeves, and in an otherwise dismantled condition of a Sunday morning. Was any thing amiss going on? Nay, that was out of the question.
11231_bartleby	42	7535	7518	7560	Bartleby	But what could he be doing there?--copying? Nay again, whatever might be his eccentricities, [MASK] was an eminently decorous person. He would be the last man to sit down to his desk in any state approaching to nudity.
11231_bartleby	48	7572	7542	7590	Bartleby	He would be the last man to sit down to his desk in any state approaching to nudity. Besides, it was Sunday; and there was something about [MASK] that forbade the supposition that he would by any secular occupation violate the proprieties of the day.
11231_bartleby	42	7627	7591	7633	Bartleby	Nevertheless, my mind was not pacified; and full of a restless curiosity, at last I returned to the door. Without hindrance I inserted my key, opened it, and entered. [MASK] was not to be seen.
11231_bartleby	57	7668	7634	7691	Bartleby	I looked round anxiously, peeped behind his screen; but it was very plain that he was gone. Upon more closely examining the place, I surmised that for an indefinite period [MASK] must have ate, dressed, and slept in my office, and that too without plate, mirror, or bed.
11231_bartleby	55	7777	7767	7822	Bartleby	Yes, thought I, it is evident enough that [MASK] has been making his home here, keeping bachelor's hall all by himself. Immediately then the thought came sweeping across me, What miserable friendlessness and loneliness are here revealed! His poverty is great; but his solitude, how horrible!
11231_bartleby	58	8068	8040	8098	Bartleby	These sad fancyings--chimeras, doubtless, of a sick and silly brain--led on to other and more special thoughts, concerning the eccentricities of [MASK]. Presentiments of strange discoveries hovered round me. The scrivener's pale form appeared to me laid out, among uncaring strangers, in its shivering winding sheet.
11231_bartleby	48	8104	8070	8118	Bartleby	Presentiments of strange discoveries hovered round me. The scrivener's pale form appeared to me laid out, among uncaring strangers, in its shivering winding sheet. Suddenly I was attracted by [MASK]'s closed desk, the key in open sight left in the lock.
11231_bartleby	41	8561	8540	8581	Bartleby	My first emotions had been those of pure melancholy and sincerest pity; but just in proportion as the forlornness of [MASK] grew and grew to my imagination, did that same melancholy merge into fear, that pity into repulsion.
11231_bartleby	49	8938	8902	8951	Bartleby	Moreover, if, after reaching home, he found himself at any time in want of aid, a letter from him would be sure of a reply. The next morning came. "[MASK]," said I, gently calling to him behind his screen.
11231_bartleby	50	8956	8956	9006	Bartleby	[MASK]," said I, in a still gentler tone, "come here; I am not going to ask you to do any thing you would prefer not to do--I simply wish to speak to you." Upon this he noiselessly slid into view.
11231_bartleby	50	9013	8999	9049	Bartleby	Upon this he noiselessly slid into view. "Will you tell me, [MASK], where you were born?" "I would prefer not to." "Will you tell me _any thing_ about yourself?" "I would prefer not to."
11231_bartleby	47	9115	9070	9117	Bartleby	He did not look at me while I spoke, but kept his glance fixed upon my bust of Cicero, which as I then sat, was directly behind me, some six inches above my head. "What is your answer, [MASK]?"
11231_bartleby	51	9311	9293	9344	Bartleby	At last, familiarly drawing my chair behind his screen, I sat down and said: "[MASK], never mind then about revealing your history; but let me entreat you, as a friend, to comply as far as may be with the usages of this office.
11231_bartleby	58	9381	9345	9403	Bartleby	Say now you will help to examine papers to-morrow or next day: in short, say now that in a day or two you will begin to be a little reasonable:--say so, [MASK]." "At present I would prefer not to be a little reasonable," was his mildly cadaverous reply.
11231_bartleby	48	9440	9434	9482	Bartleby	He overheard those final words of [MASK]. "_Prefer not_, eh?" gritted Nippers--"I'd _prefer_ him, if I were you, sir," addressing me--"I'd _prefer_ him; I'd give him preferences, the stubborn mule!
11231_bartleby	55	9638	9622	9677	Bartleby	"With submission, sir," said he, "yesterday I was thinking about [MASK] here, and I think that if he would but prefer to take a quart of good ale every day, it would do much towards mending him, and enabling him to assist in examining his papers.
11231_bartleby	51	9706	9678	9729	Turkey	" "So you have got the word too," said I, slightly excited. "With submission, what word, sir," asked [MASK], respectfully crowding himself into the contracted space behind the screen, and by so doing, making me jostle the scrivener.
11231_bartleby	48	9813	9791	9839	Turkey	I never use it myself. But, sir, as I was saying, if he would but prefer--" "[MASK]," interrupted I, "you will please withdraw." "Oh certainly, sir, if you prefer that I should."
11231_bartleby	51	9850	9826	9877	Nippers	"Oh certainly, sir, if you prefer that I should." As he opened the folding-door to retire, [MASK] at his desk caught a glimpse of me, and asked whether I would prefer to have a certain paper copied on blue paper or white.
11231_bartleby	47	9954	9948	9995	Bartleby	The next day I noticed that [MASK] did nothing but stand at his window in his dead-wall revery. Upon asking him why he did not write, he said that he had decided upon doing no more writing. "Why, how now?
11231_bartleby	55	10177	10140	10195	Bartleby	A few days after this, my other clerks being absent, and being in a great hurry to dispatch certain letters by the mail, I thought that, having nothing else earthly to do, [MASK] would surely be less inflexible than usual, and carry these letters to the post-office.
11231_bartleby	51	10219	10212	10263	Bartleby	Still added days went by. Whether [MASK]'s eyes improved or not, I could not say. To all appearance, I thought they did. But when I asked him if they did, he vouchsafed no answer. At all events, he would do no copying.
11231_bartleby	51	10499	10478	10529	Bartleby	At length, necessities connected with my business tyrannized over all other considerations. Decently as I could, I told [MASK] that in six days' time he must unconditionally leave the office. I warned him to take measures, in the interval, for procuring some other abode.
11231_bartleby	50	10560	10552	10602	Bartleby	"And when you finally quit me, [MASK]," added I, "I shall see that you go not away entirely unprovided. Six days from this hour, remember." At the expiration of that period, I peeped behind the screen, and lo!
11231_bartleby	52	10603	10603	10655	Bartleby	[MASK] was there. I buttoned up my coat, balanced myself; advanced slowly towards him, touched his shoulder, and said, "The time has come; you must quit this place; I am sorry for you; here is money; but you must go."
11231_bartleby	50	10739	10727	10777	Bartleby	The proceeding then which followed will not be deemed extraordinary. "[MASK]," said I, "I owe you twelve dollars on account; here are thirty-two; the odd twenty are yours.--Will you take it?" and I handed the bills towards him.
11231_bartleby	51	10915	10871	10922	Bartleby	I shall not see you again; so good-bye to you. If hereafter in your new place of abode I can be of any service to you, do not fail to advise me by letter. Good-bye, [MASK], and fare you well."
11231_bartleby	49	10987	10954	11003	Bartleby	As I walked home in a pensive mood, my vanity got the better of my pity. I could not but highly plume myself on my masterly management in getting rid of [MASK]. Masterly I call it, and such it must appear to any dispassionate thinker.
11231_bartleby	52	11047	11004	11056	Bartleby	The beauty of my procedure seemed to consist in its perfect quietness. There was no vulgar bullying, no bravado of any sort, no choleric hectoring, and striding to and fro across the apartment, jerking out vehement commands for [MASK] to bundle himself off with his beggarly traps.
11231_bartleby	51	11065	11062	11113	Bartleby	Without loudly bidding [MASK] depart--as an inferior genius might have done--I _assumed_ the ground that depart he must; and upon that assumption built all I had to say. The more I thought over my procedure, the more I was charmed with it.
11231_bartleby	56	11275	11244	11300	Bartleby	After breakfast, I walked down town, arguing the probabilities _pro_ and _con_. One moment I thought it would prove a miserable failure, and [MASK] would be found all alive at my office as usual; the next moment it seemed certain that I should see his chair empty.
11231_bartleby	49	11397	11364	11413	Bartleby	I was instinctively putting my hand in my pocket to produce my own, when I remembered that this was an election day. The words I had overheard bore no reference to [MASK], but to the success or non-success of some candidate for the mayoralty.
11231_bartleby	51	11551	11539	11590	Bartleby	I was fumbling under the door mat for the key, which [MASK] was to have left there for me, when accidentally my knee knocked against a panel, producing a summoning sound, and in response a voice came to me from within--"Not yet; I am occupied."
11231_bartleby	52	11820	11782	11834	Bartleby	What was to be done? or, if nothing could be done, was there any thing further that I could _assume_ in the matter? Yes, as before I had prospectively assumed that [MASK] would depart, so now I might retrospectively assume that departed he was.
11231_bartleby	54	11859	11835	11889	Bartleby	In the legitimate carrying out of this assumption, I might enter my office in a great hurry, and pretending not to see [MASK] at all, walk straight against him as if he were air. Such a proceeding would in a singular degree have the appearance of a home-thrust.
11231_bartleby	46	11895	11873	11919	Bartleby	Such a proceeding would in a singular degree have the appearance of a home-thrust. It was hardly possible that [MASK] could withstand such an application of the doctrine of assumptions. But upon second thoughts the success of the plan seemed rather dubious.
11231_bartleby	46	11932	11907	11953	Bartleby	But upon second thoughts the success of the plan seemed rather dubious. I resolved to argue the matter over with him again. "[MASK]," said I, entering the office, with a quietly severe expression, "I am seriously displeased.
11231_bartleby	47	11958	11954	12001	Bartleby	I am pained, [MASK]. I had thought better of you. I had imagined you of such a gentlemanly organization, that in any delicate dilemma a slight hint would have suffice--in short, an assumption. But it appears I am deceived.
11231_bartleby	48	12403	12389	12437	Bartleby	But when this old Adam of resentment rose in me and tempted me concerning [MASK], I grappled him and threw him. How? Why, simply by recalling the divine injunction: "A new commandment give I unto you, that ye love one another.
11231_bartleby	50	12650	12628	12678	Bartleby	I tried to fancy that in the course of the morning, at such time as might prove agreeable to him, [MASK], of his own free accord, would emerge from his hermitage, and take up some decided line of march in the direction of the door.
11231_bartleby	48	12780	12743	12791	Edwards	Ought I to acknowledge it? That afternoon I left the office without saying one further word to him. Some days now passed, during which, at leisure intervals I looked a little into "[MASK] on the Will," and "Priestly on Necessity.
11231_bartleby	51	12827	12804	12855	Bartleby	Gradually I slid into the persuasion that these troubles of mine touching the scrivener, had been all predestinated from eternity, and [MASK] was billeted upon me for some mysterious purpose of an all-wise Providence, which it was not for a mere mortal like me to fathom.
11231_bartleby	47	12858	12856	12903	Bartleby	Yes, [MASK], stay there behind your screen, thought I; I shall persecute you no more; you are harmless and noiseless as any of these old chairs; in short, I never feel so private as when I know you are here.
11231_bartleby	59	12943	12904	12963	Bartleby	At last I see it, I feel it; I penetrate to the predestinated purpose of my life. I am content. Others may have loftier parts to enact; but my mission in this world, [MASK], is to furnish you with office-room for such period as you may see fit to remain.
11231_bartleby	55	13116	13072	13127	Bartleby	Sometimes an attorney having business with me, and calling at my office and finding no one but the scrivener there, would undertake to obtain some sort of precise information from him touching my whereabouts; but without heeding his idle talk, [MASK] would remain standing immovable in the middle of the room.
11231_bartleby	56	13181	13150	13206	Bartleby	Also, when a Reference was going on, and the room full of lawyers and witnesses and business was driving fast; some deeply occupied legal gentleman present, seeing [MASK] wholly unemployed, would request him to run round to his (the legal gentleman's) office and fetch some papers for him.
11231_bartleby	44	13449	13412	13456	Bartleby	I resolved to gather all my faculties together, and for ever rid me of this intolerable incubus. Ere revolving any complicated project, however, adapted to this end, I first simply suggested to [MASK] the propriety of his permanent departure.
11231_bartleby	53	14065	14039	14092	Bartleby	I re-entered, with my hand in my pocket--and--and my heart in my mouth. "Good-bye, [MASK]; I am going--good-bye, and God some way bless you; and take that," slipping something in his hand.
11231_bartleby	41	14182	14146	14187	Bartleby	When I returned to my rooms after any little absence, I would pause at the threshold for an instant, and attentively listen, ere applying my key. But these fears were needless. [MASK] never came nigh me.
11231_bartleby	43	14670	14665	14708	Bartleby	In vain I persisted that [MASK] was nothing to me--no more than to any one else. In vain:--I was the last person known to have any thing to do with him, and they held me to the terrible account.
11231_bartleby	49	14834	14819	14868	Bartleby	I motioned him into the lawyer's room, who then left us. "[MASK]," said I, "are you aware that you are the cause of great tribulation to me, by persisting in occupying the entry after being dismissed from the office?"
11231_bartleby	52	15290	15290	15342	Bartleby	[MASK]," said I, in the kindest tone I could assume under such exciting circumstances, "will you go home with me now--not to my office, but my dwelling--and remain there till we can conclude upon some convenient arrangement for you at our leisure?
11231_bartleby	54	15460	15414	15468	Bartleby	As soon as tranquility returned I distinctly perceived that I had now done all that I possibly could, both in respect to the demands of the landlord and his tenants, and with regard to my own desire and sense of duty, to benefit [MASK], and shield him from rude persecution.
11231_bartleby	46	15783	15761	15807	Bartleby	Some of the compassionate and curious bystanders joined the party; and headed by one of the constables arm in arm with [MASK], the silent procession filed its way through all the noise, and heat, and joy of the roaring thoroughfares at noon.
11231_bartleby	47	15863	15832	15879	Bartleby	Seeking the right officer, I stated the purpose of my call, and was informed that the individual I described was indeed within. I then assured the functionary that [MASK] was a perfectly honest man, and greatly to be compassionated, however unaccountably eccentric.
11231_bartleby	55	16036	15983	16038	Bartleby	And so I found him there, standing all alone in the quietest of the yards, his face towards a high wall, while all around, from the narrow slits of the jail windows, I thought I saw peering out upon him the eyes of murderers and thieves. "[MASK]!"
11231_bartleby	54	16070	16051	16105	Bartleby	I want nothing to say to you." "It was not I that brought you here, [MASK]," said I, keenly pained at his implied suspicion. "And to you, this should not be so vile a place. Nothing reproachful attaches to you by being here.
11231_bartleby	54	16529	16517	16571	Bartleby	"I prefer not to dine to-day," said [MASK], turning away. "It would disagree with me; I am unused to dinners." So saying he slowly moved to the other side of the inclosure, and took up a position fronting the dead-wall.
11231_bartleby	47	16707	16701	16748	Monroe	So you weren't acquainted with [MASK]?" "No, I was never socially acquainted with any forgers. But I cannot stop longer. Look to my friend yonder. You will not lose by it. I will see you again."
11231_bartleby	48	16771	16729	16777	Bartleby	Look to my friend yonder. You will not lose by it. I will see you again." Some few days after this, I again obtained admission to the Tombs, and went through the corridors in quest of [MASK]; but without finding him.
11231_bartleby	52	16832	16808	16860	Yonder	So I went in that direction. "Are you looking for the silent man?" said another turnkey passing me. "[MASK] he lies--sleeping in the yard there. 'Tis not twenty minutes since I saw him lie down." The yard was entirely quiet.
11231_bartleby	51	17131	17083	17134	Bartleby	"Eh!--He's asleep, aint he?" "With kings and counselors," murmured I. * * * * * * * * There would seem little need for proceeding further in this history. Imagination will readily supply the meager recital of poor [MASK]'s interment.
