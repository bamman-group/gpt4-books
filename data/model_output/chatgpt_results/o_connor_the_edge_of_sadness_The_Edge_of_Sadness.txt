<name>probably Trump</name>	probably Trump	Hugh	What would you say?” “Oh, about the same,” he said easily. “About the same, [MASK]. You see, there’s really not much anyone else could say at this stage. There are so many factors involved . . .
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Hugh	It must have been a shout, for now he did stop, abruptly, a look of bewilderment on his face. “What?” he said. “Did you say something, [MASK]?” I nodded.
<name>home</name>	home	Charlie	Then, because I wanted to get back to [MASK], I said, “Tell me about your grandfather: does he seem interested in your running for office? Does he talk much to you about it?” “All the time,” he said.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Ted	Guiltily I said, “No. No, it isn’t, [MASK]. Nothing’s decided at all. There’s always a certain amount of pessimistic talk at a time like this; what you have to remember is that it really doesn’t mean anything.
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Charlie	And now we’ve all et up, let’s go back into the livin’ room and have a grand old time!” Although, with [MASK]’s final glum reflections to serve as a springboard, it struck me that this injunction was easier delivered than obeyed.
<name>Jonathan Edwards</name>	Jonathan Edwards	John	As good as ever?” A for effort. I said, “Good for me, yes. How good it would be for anyone else I don’t know. I think a more active pastor — someone like [MASK], for instance — would probably go mad there.”
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Hugh	Do you know what I mean?” “Yes. I do indeed.” “Of course she belongs to an older generation. She’s not like you and me, [MASK]. She’s a fatalist. A pessimist. Now, I’m not.
<name>unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Hugh	“Now, where to?” he said. “Can we take it as settled, [MASK]: you’re coming home with us?” But I still said no; for a few moments he continued to urge me.
<name>sheep</name>	sheep	Hugh	Although to tell you the truth — and this is confidential: I wouldn’t want it to get around — I’m thinking seriously about dropping the wool end of it. It’s not what it used to be, [MASK]. The new synthetics have hit it hard.
<name>she</name>	she	Mary	Was he in any danger? Or was [MASK] vastly exag- gerating in her panic? These were all questions which came rushing up together in no sensible order, all following, I suppose, from that first question which had not yet been answered: What had happened?
<name>he</name>	he	Charlie	I simply sat there, waiting for the rest to come, and suddenly [MASK] began to cough again: a series of heavy, watery coughs which shook his body and left his eyes streaming. I pressed his hand and said, “Easy now. Don’t push yourself.
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Frank	At the door I was met by [MASK] and the young doctor. Before I even asked the question the young doctor was ready with the answer: he said, “No great change; he’s about the same. But he’s wide awake now, and he’s quiet.
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Dan	Surprise surprise.” It was indeed; he was a puzzling guest. Still, he was also a welcome enough one; he came in and after the first words of greeting I said, “I had no idea you were still with us, [MASK].
<name>darling</name>	darling	Hugh	No, no, this current disaster is like all the others essentially, and do you know why? Because it has my father’s stamp all over it. And death — the real thing — isn’t quite that obliging, [MASK]; it just doesn’t let itself be stamped!”
<name>Joseph</name>	Joseph	Raymond	That coffin in the basement will wind up here, come hell or high water, and all the talk is just that: talk. In the good old Saint [MASK]’s tradition of meaningless eloquence. He’s here, and here he’ll stay until the end of time.
<name>St. George</name>	St. George	Charlie	Here in the hall it was still, very still. I looked around me once more, slowly, completely, and then I left the house and went back to my rectory. And this was the end of Christmas Day. . . . NO NEWS of [MASK] came that night.
<name>stranger</name>	stranger	Dan	Get out. Get out while the getting’s good. Get out before we break your heart. This city’s not for you, [MASK]. We’re a city with a past, but we have no future. Whatever you try, we’ll beat you down.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Helen	So, slowly, we pulled out of the clearing and began our drive back to town. We said little as we rode. I think [MASK] was probably somewhat embarrassed, in the way one is when both too much and not enough has been said.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Charlie	But at this point the car pulled up beside us, the old-fashioned fenders hanging over the curb so that they nearly brushed against us. “Easy, easy!” [MASK] cried angrily. “Are you tryin’ to run over your father?
<name>man</name>	man	Roy	They are clad in savage nothingness, yet on the coldest nights they sleep out of doors and on the bare ground, their bodies exposed to the driving snow and the wildest winds! How remarkable that is! Reflect on that, [MASK]: how much it teaches us of what the human being is capable!”
<name>anyone</name>	anyone	Charlie	Not to deny the problem of the old versus the young, which is real enough, God knows, and often tragic enough, too, but to save me I couldn’t quite picture [MASK] as its immediate victim.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Charlie	Guiltily, before sleep came, I did attend, however briefly, to [MASK], and in this way I closed out the day. . . . But not quite closed it out. Because suddenly, as it had a week ago, the telephone by my bed rang.
<name>Mrs. Jones</name>	Mrs. Jones	Roy	Unfortunately, most of these preparations depended upon [MASK], but this always unpredictable figure astonished me with furious spasms of scrubbing and sweeping and painting, so that on the day before the Bishop arrived, both church and rectory were, if not spotless, at least at their most presentable.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Charlie	Once or twice I was sure that I was being heavy-handed, that I was going a little too far for belief, but apparently not: it was all done in a fair parody of my father’s style, and in any case [MASK] was not now disposed to be critical.
<name>Edmund</name>	Edmund	Charlie	My father was sitting up in bed, backed by numerous pillows. He had had a fairly good day, he had talked somewhat more than usual, and [MASK] had evidently been on his mind — at least, the talk today had been about no one else.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	John	And was this declaration really greeted by the sound of a vast if smothered sigh? Or was it only that, from the glum contortion of [MASK]’s face, I was sure there had to be such a sigh?
<name>her</name>	her	Helen	And so by the third morning I could tell from [MASK]’s voice — rather than from anything she had to say — that the small and not quite positive evidence had made itself felt, and that in spite of her first convictions, she had begun to hope a little.
<name>Elmer</name>	Elmer	Charlie	Even when [MASK] dies — always supposing he does die, of course — they can keep it going by sticking a little relic up on the porch with a thumb tack. His wallet, say. I tell you, there are thousands would come to see that.
<name>John</name>	John	Hugh	And isn’t that really,” he said, his tone suddenly dropping the heavy irony, and becoming one of somber, straightforward accusation, “isn’t that really the one kind of parish you want? Don’t answer because I know the answer: I know you, [MASK].
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	Bucky	Father, let’s forget about our little ride today and go over to see [MASK] instead. What d’ye say to that?’, well, I tell you, he had the coat and the collar on before I finished gettin’ the words out of my mouth.
<name>Father Flynn</name>	Father Flynn	John	It doesn’t get easier for anyone, you know. Especially if you’re someone like [MASK].” “Maybe he should have been something else. Although I can’t think what. And he is a good priest: I know that. . . .”
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Hugh	He laughed and made a motion with his arm; for a moment I thought he was going to nudge me in the ribs. But then he grew suddenly sober, and said gravely, “Actually, [MASK], that’s why I’m still in town.
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	Charlie	No: just [MASK]. Unused to the strange climate of geniality, he seemed to have run amok, converting his living room into a kind of gymnasium of good will, knocking us all together so suddenly and with such violence that we were simply too startled to be constrained.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Charlie	She did, and I greeted her; [MASK], opening the door, put one foot in the car and then said to me, “So I said to them, ‘And nothin’ I said was true?’
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	John	“No no,” I said quickly, for [MASK]’s parish, in which his father lived, was at the farthest point of the city from mine; the trip would have taken him miles out of his way.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Helen	After a moment I said, “Think what you’re saying. You know that [MASK] doesn’t hate you. And never did. . . .” “She said so,” he said. “And meant so. At the time.
<name>the wallpaper</name>	the wallpaper	Bucky	She leads a hell of a dull life, Father, sittin’ there every night, hookin’ rugs and lookin’ at [MASK]. Well well,” he said expansively, “that’s the way life goes. We mustn’t complain.”
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Hugh	So how highly would you rate his considered opinion, [MASK]? Without knowledge, without intimacy, without any of the familiarity which is the well-known breeding ground et cetera? And at least I’m intimate enough, familiar enough with my own people over here.
<name>Antoinette</name>	Antoinette	Charlie	I hadn’t said much about old [MASK] to him, but I’d said enough, evidently, for him to deduce that recovery was improbable; as a consequence, our dinner table now rang each night with inspirational anecdotes, each one dealing with a miracle of returned health. . . .
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bucky	[MASK] said loudly. Not to be outdone in solicitude? “Oh yes. No one denies that one. Sad news. I got here as soon as I could. I would have got here sooner but I missed my bus.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Hugh	And then what would you have said, [MASK]? That listening to these people is my work? Would you have said something like that?” I nodded. “Something like that, I’m afraid. If I’d said anything at all, that is.”
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Hugh	Things I had no control over; things I just couldn’t do anything about. Although later, sometimes, I wondered if . . . for instance, [MASK],” she said, “and just for instance: did it ever even enter your mind that you might marry me?”
<name>Straker</name>	Straker	Charlie	Clearly old [MASK] had mysterious business of some sort with me which was yet to be finished, and he was not a man who let go easily. I had expected— and half feared — a sequence of rambling telephone talks, all occurring at times of maximum inconvenience.
<name>somebody</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	somebody (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Albert	About a mile from the church, at the northern end of the parish, there was a side street where a row of empty sanitation department trucks usually stood parked; apparently they were now — at least to judge from [MASK] — a neighborhood point of reference, like a monument, or a cathedral.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Adam	Did I blush, I wonder, like a schoolboy: all [MASK]’s apple and big raw knuckles? I don’t know; I felt shy, embarrassed in a way I hadn’t felt for . . . how long?
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Charlie	“Old pals and the family,” [MASK] said. “I remember them all, day and night, in the prayers and out of them. And plenty of others as well. Busy as I am, I’m thinkin’ of people every hour of the day.
<name>Mrs. Carmody</name>	Mrs. Carmody	Dan	It was also the day on which, almost a week after the attack had occurred, I finally went over — unbidden — to see him. I did not see him. I arrived at the Carmody house to be greeted by [MASK] — and greeted effusively.
<name>him</name>	him	Charlie	I lay there in the darkness, still thinking, but aware now of my own fatigue, and feeling sleep already beginning to come on. And then, in what must have been the fading seconds of wakefulness, I suddenly thought: [MASK]! I had forgotten him.
<name>He</name>	He	Frank	And I thought that in this turning to the older man there was something more than mere politeness; there was a deference, a genuine respect. [MASK] nodded and said, “No change?” “No, none. Status quo.
<name>probably</name> no proper name fits here, it is likely a continuation of the sentence.	probably no proper name fits here, it is likely a continuation of the sentence.	Hugh	But I’ve been thinking a lot about it lately. Because of my father being sick, and the whole family being here together. As well as,” he said brusquely, “for other reasons. Anyway, I’ve been reviewing our family history, [MASK].
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Charlie	But say you went into his real estate office one day to buy a little piece of land worth maybe ten dollars, and [MASK] was good enough — you being an old friend — to sell it to you for a hundred.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Mary	Or at least most of them were. And that didn’t do me much good here. And so the long and short of it is that while I went out now and then, I found myself at home more often than I’d expected. With [MASK].
<name>Jay Gatsby</name>	Jay Gatsby	Hugh	What about him, [MASK]? Was it a mistake for him?” And here we were again, after so many years, back on another bit of familiar ground, although perhaps not covering it now in quite the same way as before.
<name>everyone</name>	everyone	Helen	And while it was good to hear — it’s never exactly painful to discover that you’ve been missed — all the same, it did suggest a difficulty. For the truth was that I had not “come back” — not, that is, in [MASK]’s sense of the word.
<name>him</name>	him	Charlie	But exactly what he could want — or, for that matter, what I had to give — was beyond me. Meanwhile, there was the hour, and Mass was to be said; the problem was to get [MASK] to the point and get him there quickly.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Hugh	Not much; a small insurance policy. But it went. Quite quickly and foolishly.” I added drily, “You may have heard.” “I know, I know,” he muttered hurriedly. ‘We’re all proud of you, [MASK].
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Mary	I got a [MASK] that cries. Real tears!” I said, “Like a mama doll.” “Right!” he said. “But religious! Nice! They don’t want it. Anything I got, they don’t want it.
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Hugh	“Everybody knows that Old Saint Paul’s hasn’t had a quarter in twenty years. Why would I be doing that? No,” he said, settling back into earnestness, “no, what I’m here for is to give you the chance, [MASK].
<name>Tom's</name>	Tom's	Charlie	Possibly; probably. Is there any harm in it? No. Is there any point to it? No. Yet all the same, on Sunday I am going to [MASK]’s birthday party. . . . And now I am going to my Mass. . . .
<name>Ned</name>	Ned	Frank	I’d always thought that the doctor was a bit like the confessor, but not at all. At least [MASK] isn’t. He’s full of odd, half-discreet tidbits about who’s sick and what they’ve got and what their chances are.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Charlie	But there proved to be no problem of beginning at all; [MASK] saw to that. “Here we are!” he cried, bursting into the room ahead of us: a bounding, exuberant little figure, waving his arms, compelling attention.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Frank	And in any case such private conversations are usually self-limiting; you are suddenly remembered; there is a bridge of quick apology; the talk becomes general once more. As it did now and I, doing my part, asked [MASK] about his son.
<name>she</name>	she	Helen	I hoped you would.” “I did indeed. I liked her, very much. Who is she, [MASK]? Would I know any of her people?” “No, I don’t think so.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bucky	A young feller like that.” He said it with sorrow but without surprise. I think perhaps nothing could have surprised this very old man by now. And [MASK] said, “One week ago today, Father! One week ago today! I talked with him myself!
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Helen	I think [MASK] could use some.” “Yes. Of course that’s a special situation. She’s always been at a disadvantage with my father. I’ve often thought that it helped in dealing with him if you were either infinitely malleable or absolutely resistant.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Charlie	And at this point, no matter who you are, or what you believe, or what you may be, it sometimes becomes a little hard to give three cheers for the inevitable. . . . Happy thoughts on [MASK]’s happy birthday!
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Charlie	[MASK] coughed again, but now for the first time he did not wait for the coughing to stop. There was a new sense of urgency now: willfully, with great effort, breathing hard, he began to talk through the coughs.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	John	Dealing with my plans. My plans for the future. There’s some people don’t seem too interested in those plans. Some people with their short answers!” He looked across the room at [MASK]; the look was one of the darkest dissatisfaction.
<name>The Bishop</name>	The Bishop	Hugh	Do you like him, [MASK]? You do, don’t you?” “The Bishop? Yes, very much. Of course I have every reason to, and that usually helps.” “These reasons,” she said.
<name>darling</name>	darling	Hugh	That’s the great principle of life over here: the more people you bother, the better you feel. A little lesson I absorbed at my father’s knee. No, your only defense now is to hide, [MASK]. Or better still, pray for a bus strike.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Helen	We can tell him later, when he’s stronger. . . He looked around the bleak official room where he had met me and said, “Well ... I guess that’s about it. I should be getting a move on. To see how [MASK]’s doing.”
<name>Avrillon</name>	Avrillon	Frank	As a physician [MASK] was not indiscreet, but he had been the Bishop’s doctor for years, and occasionally he liked to pass on to the lesser clergy, in a tone of great confidence, some small piece of inside information about his patient’s health.
<name>Uncle Podger</name>	Uncle Podger	Charlie	Indeed, once we were back in the living room, it turned out that the one who had no intention of obeying it was [MASK] himself, who now announced his own plans. He was going to bed. “For my nap,” he explained.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Hugh	But this was hardly the moment for candor; I said that I had heard nothing of the kind. “There was never anything to it, of course. But it did something to me, [MASK]. I can’t deny that. I got angry.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Dan	We don’t know yet; it depends on the connections. But with any luck, she’ll be here in the morning!” Which, of course, would solve everything. Although, I suppose, it probably would come very close to doing that for [MASK].
<name>Father</name>	Father	John	Again [MASK] had been right. I suppose that in the back of my mind was always the idea that this was a period of probation which would one day end, and that then I would go back and finish my life as a priest in some parish very like the one in which I began.
<name>Dr. Rivers</name>	Dr. Rivers	Martin	And then, quickly, with an impatient flourish of the hand, he waved away [MASK] and even the far more congenial subject of the Clinic; from his manner, even from his stance, it became clear that he was now ready to speak on graver matters.
<name>Uncle Remus</name>	Uncle Remus	Charlie	Which was hardly a surprise; no stroke of his father’s, however casual, ever eluded this ready man. . . . “And the little children, too,” [MASK] said. “I’m a great man for the little ones.
<name>Moira</name>	Moira	Mary	“You’re a grand girl, [MASK],” he said. “You’re the same grand girl your dad brought you up to be. What I say has nothin’ to do with you. Or not much, anyways. No, you’re a grand girl
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Charlie	There was no sentimentality here at all: this was [MASK] as I’d never seen him, without a mask of any kind, uttering at the end a cold, dry, naked cry — a cry that was unexpected, hitter, and dangerous.
<name>unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Charlie	No I don’t go blind two hours each day! No I don’t swell up at night! I’m sorry to have to tell you that, [MASK], but I don’t! Now what else is there? What else would you like to know?
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Charlie	But now [MASK] burst into another spasm of coughs, which were about as severe as those that had gone before: no worse, but still alarming. He recovered in the same manner, and when he had he said, “That leaves who?
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Mary	[MASK], listen to me: I’m coming. Right away. But try to tell me: what happened to him?” And then, because it was the question that had to be asked, I said, “How is he now?”
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Bucky	He had a neck like a turkey and died of the croup.” “Ah, but it’s the people that’s different,” [MASK] said. “The old crowd’s gone and forever. We can’t deny that. Scattered to the four winds.”
<name>darling</name>	darling	Helen	All of a sudden I don’t know what to say. It’s quite a change, I know, but I really don’t.” “You don’t have to say anything, [MASK]. That wasn’t included in the price of admission.”
<name>unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Helen	It’s just that the older you get the more likely you are to think that you had it all.” “I suppose you are.” And then I said, “You’re how old, [MASK]? Fifty-four?” She smiled slightly.
<name>success</name>	success	Charlie	He was not easily discouraged, but I think now he saw all too clearly that [MASK] had been nothing more than a false dawn, that the brighter, brisker, spick-and-span Saint Paul’s remained as far away as ever.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Roy	[MASK], whose working tempo was ideally suited to the hot and drowsy days of summer, distrusted and feared the sharper months to come; by the end of September he had begun to plump for the heated church. “Because why?” he asked rhetorically.
<name>him</name>	him	Lil	He wants to know if we’ll go down to the convention with [MASK] and himself.” She said thoughtfully, “I’m not too mad about that. Do we have to?” “No, there’s nothing definite.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Charlie	ward as if hoping to catch up with it before it disappeared entirely. He said hurriedly, “Perhaps we could continue to discuss this matter at some other —” But [MASK] was already at the door. “Goodbye!” he cried.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dan	The enzyme of advancing years?” I said, “No. I was just thinking that earlier this afternoon I found myself revising my own opinion of [MASK] a bit.” “Well, there you have it all over me,” he said.
<name>Punch</name>	Punch	Punch	He’s pleased as [MASK]. And proud — proud in a way that’s quite unusual for him. It’s a quiet pride; he doesn’t say much about it; but you can tell exactly what he feels simply by looking at him!”
<name>Willy</name>	Willy	Bucky	[MASK] said loudly. His face had grown very red; clearly, he had forgotten all about me. “And what’s the truth about the eighty-two? Who’s the one man in this room today that’s exactly eighty-two and no lies about it?
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Bucky	One day,” he said, excitement and delight running across his face, “that certain priest will get what’s coming to him! One day when the people start coming back and asking why they have to go clear across the city to look at [MASK]’s lovely grave!
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Hugh	I walked with him to the door, and then, just before he left, I couldn’t resist asking, “You haven’t suggested to your father that he come in on this with you?” “No,” he said quickly. “No, I haven’t done that, [MASK].
<name>I</name>	I	Roy	before I could get from him the story of what had happened. When I did I sent for a doctor, but it was too late; the old man was dead and, moreover, had been dead for about two hours when [MASK] found him.
<name>Lady Bracknell</name>	Lady Bracknell	Ted	Out of habit I went on. “It’s a question of timing, of coordinating the schedules of [MASK]’s house and Old Saint Paul’s. . . “You’re not really too fond of direct answers these days, are you?” she said.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	John	So this was how my visit — and this strange, disturbing talk — ended. There was no more to be said. [MASK] walked with me down to the rectory door: on this return trip I turned no slow inspecting gaze around the familiar scene.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Anne	I’m working at it a little harder than I expected, and seeing a lot of people I wouldn’t otherwise see. It’s dull and routine, in a way, but it’s new and exciting, too. And [MASK]’s a great help.”
<name>Dad</name>	Dad	P’ye	[MASK] remember that, I wonder?” I nodded. As a young boy I had often gone on long walks — very long walks — with my father. They were never walks with any particular destination — or at least I never took them to be so.
