<name>Tim</name>	Tim	Dod	To be sure, he had always been careful to keep on the good side of his little brother-in-law. “He never done us any good!” [MASK] spoke vindictively. Now what could he mean by that?
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Wully	Have you got those grays yet?” asked [MASK], suddenly curious. “No, I haven’t.” The man smiled reminiscently. “I wish I had, sometimes. A Chicago man came along and wanted them. He was determined to have them.
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Chirstie	His father _had_ told him briefly about it on the way home. He didn’t say to his mother that the news had thrilled him with the certainty that now his plans could have no opposition, since [MASK] was left quite unprotected, and must be needing him.
<name>Jerry</name>	Jerry	McNair	What could a man do in the face of that? Where in the name of the shorter catechism had the woman got those shoes, and when--after all the money she had wasted that day on houses? [MASK] simply gave up.
<name>Blackbeard</name>	Blackbeard	Wully	he said, in such a voice that she could say no more just then. “You won’t _hurt_ him, [MASK]!” she begged again, thinking only of her husband’s safety. “Will I not!” he answered grimly.
<name>He</name>	He	Chirstie	But he was beside himself at the sight. He got up and strode around the room, at his wits’ end. Life was upside down. [MASK] at his mother’s broken and nervous from her shock; his aunt raving mad; his mother crying noisily....
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Chirstie	The morning’s white frosts were the promise of it. [MASK] must keep the doors shut now, for the baby’s sake. With doors shut the house seemed a trap, a trap from whose windows she had often to be looking to reassure herself.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Chirstie	The wedding was the best possible solution of the situation. Let them just leave [MASK]’s father to her! She comforted the girl earnestly, being distressed by her face. She hoped in her heart that the marriage would put an end to the girl’s newly developed and stubborn depression.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Peter	There was no place for laziness in a world where men existed only by toil. It was like chronic cowardice in the face of the enemy. [MASK]’s mother, to be sure, said he wasn’t strong.
<name>he</name>	he	Wully’ll	“If ever you tell I told you, I suppose you’ll break up everything between us!” she sobbed. “I don’t know what [MASK] do if he finds it out. Maybe he won’t have me! Maybe he’ll turn me out!”
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Wully	“I suppose the other six will be doing the same, now!” “If a brother of mine did a thing like that, I’d kill him!” cried [MASK] fiercely. It soothed her to have something not tragic to reprove him for.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Dod	[MASK] was undoubtedly preparing to make himself as comfortable as possible. He was weary enough to defy the world, and relinquish his pretenses of being a man. He made his decision known flatly. “I’m not going back into that!” he announced.
<name>He</name>	He	Isobel	He didn’t know exactly how his mother had worked it all, but it did him good to hear his father-in-law begging for the privilege of his company for a while--that man he had expected to have such a time with! [MASK] yielded gracefully at length.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Wully	And now, when [MASK] looked at her from the corner of his eyes, his own anger, his bitter hatred seemed a small thing before hers. Her face was as white as marble, and as hard, one might have thought. Her mouth was screwed tight in loathing.
<name>Susy</name>	Susy	Mary	And now, in the evening, he had read the first chapter of the New Testament. He resented that. He wouldn’t have read it if he had remembered what was in it. That story of [MASK]’s humiliation might seem ever so slightly to reflect upon his wife.
<name>husband</name>	husband	John	But her mother-in-law consoled her by telling about her [MASK]. He had spoken hardly a word till he was three, and she was really getting alarmed about it, when suddenly he seemed to join the family conversation, so rapidly he learned words and sentences.
<name>Clark</name>	Clark	Wully	[MASK] carried the old garment. He had been gay, almost hilarious all the morning, ever since selling the prairie chickens so well. And now as he looked at his stunning wife, walking demurely along in such grandeur, his spirits rose higher.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Chirstie	Those days seemed to him now like a nightmare. He had planned what he would say to his wife when he adopted her baby for his own. He would go blithely in, and cry to her gayly, “Where’s my son, [MASK]?”
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Isobel	“I don’t care! I _might_ die! I’m going to tell you something!” And she fell to crying again. [MASK] came and stood over her. A fierce hope gleamed uncertainly for a moment in her mind, and went out again.
<name>John</name>	John	Wully	And [MASK]--when he saw that face--it was the last thing in the world that he intended doing--but some way, in spite of himself, he achieved generosity--the spoil, it may have been, of ancestral struggle.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Peter	If not, then [MASK] would find that no woman could help him now! He drove straight along towards his aunt’s, grimly, not having to nurse his wrath, having only to restrain it. He wasn’t made for anger, as he knew.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Wully	He climbed up beside her, and they were off. She saw he couldn’t tell her what had happened just there. She could wait--a little. They were almost out of town now. “[MASK], what’s the matter? Are you sick?”
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Peter	Where’s my [MASK]?” At first he could not understand so impossible a question. She scrambled perilously down, and started on a run for the house, with him following. “Where is he?” she cried again, turning on him.
<name>She</name>	She	Wully	She dared not answer that tone. [MASK] choked, and turned away, to look out over the prairies again. A rattlesnake, that man was, hiding in the grass, a damned poison snake, and like a snake he should be treated.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Chirstie	“[MASK]!” he whispered. “I didn’t know that you were here! I didn’t know that you were the lassie for me!” He kissed her fearfully. He kissed her without fear, many times. She said only “Oh!”
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Wully	How glad his mother would be when sometime she heard of his love! He knew it was the very thing she would have chosen for him. When he came into the kitchen she said, with relief: “You’re a long time away, [MASK]!”
<name>Jock</name>	Jock	Wully	“[MASK],” she said severely, “don’t you speak words like them here! ’Tis something you learned in the army! A fine one you’d be to say who should live and who should die! We dinna say the like here!”
<name>José</name>	José	Wully	So she said that the baby must have more air, and she took him day after day to the field where [MASK] was husking corn. Since the mosquitoes were no longer hungry, the baby’s face was free for the first time in months from red blotches.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Wully	He wouldn’t tell her how he had seen that snake lying bloody, dirty, sunken helpless on a bed of straw. He urged his horses on. She looked at him. He turned away from her troubled eyes. After a while; “Look here, [MASK]!”
<name>Clarence</name>	Clarence	Wully	CHAPTER III After more than three months spent in hospitals, [MASK] came home the next March, honorably discharged from the army. His father met him at the end of the railroad, and before dawn they started westward over the all but impassable paths called roads.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Wully	He stood laughing at her indulgently, amused because she was a pretty thing. “Come back to the house and I’ll give you a slice of cold turkey that father shot yesterday. Wasn’t it a good bird, [MASK]!” She started back towards the house.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Chirstie	[MASK] had a collar of lace more soft and fine than she had ever seen. And the wee body presented these things with that timid, conciliatory air that made her career later so hard to understand. She apologized for having nothing for the baby.
<name>Wicksteed</name>	Wicksteed	Peter	Murder? Had he thought of murder in a place of peace? Instantly he had come far back on that road to his habitual self, when with a shock he came against the criminal fact of [MASK]. He was ill, he cried. He wanted to rest.
<name>Problem</name>	Problem	Dod	“And if you feel like working in the morning, you come back with me again!” [MASK] went away, unsolved and uncomforting. Hour by hour the seekers, conquered by fatigue and the growing assurance of futility, stopped more often for breath.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Lincoln	The tidings of [MASK]’s death sickened him desperately. He got to thinking he was never again to be a strong man. And he could see no reason for wanting to be. After a few weeks the rains ceased, and the spring flooded her sunshine over the fields with high engendering ecstasy.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Wully	She rejoiced in her assurance. His anger flamed again. “Likely I’d bring him out with you!” “Oh, we’ll be _happy_ now, [MASK]!” But after a minute she stirred uncomfortably. He felt her face grow grave.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Wully	“She won’t even let me go swimming a minute. She wants me to stay here all the time. She cries all the time, no matter what I do!” This was worse than [MASK] had expected. “Was she crying before now?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Stowe	Oh, no wonder [MASK] had come home four times! And now his holiday was all but over. He vowed rashly he would not go back! Never! If only he had come and found her the first of his twelve days! He wondered why he had left her.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Jeannie	But when the ten flourishing McLaughlins again saw [MASK] on this side of the water, of her five there remained only her little Chirstie, and a baby boy. The bodies of the other three she had seen thrown out of the smallpox-smitten ship which the feasting sharks were following.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Wully	He might easily be overcome with the heat, in his condition. But [MASK], it seemed, was at last feeling as well as he had ever felt. He had been loafing too long. He must begin to get something done on his own place.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Chirstie	she begged. He felt [MASK] shrinking against him. “He told me in the morning that he had decided to go this time for sure. I told him he was foolish. And I rode over again to give him some advice in the evening.”
<name>Septimus</name>	Septimus	Wully	Beating along both sides of the road they went, tramping down the grasses, calling him--calling till [MASK] felt tears running down his face. Not that he pitied her. He cursed her. He was saying to himself, “God damn you, stop that noise!”
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Chirstie	She had seen him. He went towards her---- And she shrank away from him! Not only had she not an impulse of welcome, she shrank away from him! She gave him her hand because she couldn’t help herself. “[MASK]!” he faltered.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	John	[MASK] had just picked up the lamp to go up to bed--he had the one lamp, because he studied--and he turned at the bottom of the stairs to answer, the light flickering across his neck, where his hickory shirt collar was open.
<name>she</name>	she	Chirstie	His mother had not said a word about the girl as they rode home together, but she sighed deeply, from time to time, so that he guessed [MASK] had not even been cordial to her. He tried hard enough, as he grew stronger, to shake off his depression.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Wully	[MASK], who seized upon trifling straws, saw promise in this. She wasn’t going to church again, and she had wanted a good look at him! But what was it--why should she be so silly? Why wouldn’t she let him make her happy?
<name>Magdalene</name>	Magdalene	Jeannie	He was ashamed of the hope he had had from it, when he saw his mother’s face harden with grief and resentment as she went on to relate the details of her friend’s death, a death grim enough to be in keeping with [MASK]’s life.
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Wully	He wouldn’t tell how shortly he had answered them, and how hatefully turned on his heel and departed. “[MASK]!” she said, after a little, with conviction, “we ought to go back and get him!
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Knight	[MASK] was a man whose opinion was valuable, a prosperous man, a man dressed as men dress in cities, whose interest he felt was not merely assumed for political ends. “How’s your mother?” he went on.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Chirstie	He looked up. He threw down his scythe. He started running. [MASK] was running towards him. She was crying out to him, too far away to be heard. He gave a look towards the house. There seemed to be no sign of fire.
<name>Jed</name>	Jed	McCreath	Anything to get away from that noise she was making, that anguished crooning. Never was a man with murder in his heart so undone by the grief he intended augmenting. The sandy-haired bewhiskered [MASK] had stopped still in his dooryard to watch the runaway team coming up.
<name>John</name>	John	Wully	The baby sister was asleep. It was bedtime again. The new family sat down for prayers. Not that [MASK] was a man deeply religious. But, as far as he knew, daily family prayers was one of the things a decent man does for his family.
<name>Orpheus</name>	Orpheus	Allen	And it was necessary that it give her little strengthening messages, while inside the more zealous young things danced to the fiddle that was not [MASK]’s. Out in the warm starlight and the smoke, the older guests talked to the bride and groom.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Wully	They sauntered out to their garden of little trees, after [MASK] had wiped the breakfast dishes, and spent some time there, weeding it, and cultivating it, playing together. Were not the two of them quite content to spend their holiday at home together now?
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Peter	These things ought not to be.... Then [MASK], who was all she had left to spend her love on, disappeared, leaving in his place a scribbled paper. No wonder, after all, that she sought him through cold cities.
<name>Thorneycroft</name>	Thorneycroft	Peter	It suggested a devilish cunning, a subtility not to be lightly reckoned with, a persistence that made an honest man’s blood boil. To his praying mother he affirmed that [MASK] was alive. To his dreading wife, he proclaimed that certainly he was dead.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	McCreaths	Or [MASK]’. Who came for her?” “She took the team and went herself.” “You’re daft! Her take a team!” But the team was gone. The barn was as empty as the house.
<name>John</name>	John	Peter	She hadn’t been at all afraid. And that night, when there was no help within a mile, she had run out of the house, undressed, barefooted, across the snow--till [MASK] caught her, and brought her back.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Chirstie	She looked at him narrowly, with delight. “But you canna just be married to-day, and the harvesting coming on!” “You bet I can!” replied her American. Indeed, he never could! Not to [MASK]!
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Dod	[MASK] was extremely thin. The ridges of his ribs showed under his skin, which gleamed white and wet in places, in vivid contrast to his tanned arms and neck, and he was stepping along gingerly to avoid thorns, lifting his bony legs high.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Wully	Presently she saw her husband drive up, and get out to tie his horses. But before he had started for the hotel door, a stranger accosted him, and with the stranger [MASK] turned and went down the street. So she waited on.
<name>John</name>	John	Wully	“What’s the matter of you!” She had been so surprised, so delighted with her son’s first sentence that she had turned, even kissing him, to [MASK], no joy complete unless he shared it. “Did you hear _that_!”
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Wully	Over her face there spread swiftly a smile of soft amusement. She had always looked that way when one of her children said something especially innocent and lovable. “You don’t mean December, [MASK]! Dinna ye ken that? The wee’uns can’na just hurry so!”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Davie	They had grown tired of watching the red calf sleep, and [MASK] was trying to make it get up. Finally in self-defense, it rose, and having found itself refreshed, began gamboling about, trying its length of rope, its tail satisfactorily erect.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Wully	And the one to whom he had to tell his tale of escaping from his guard--oh, he was a new man, most hated by the boys--he had put [MASK] and two others in prison in the loft of a barn, on bread and water.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Barbara	Then, the refreshments being finished, the woman took her by the hand, and led her out of the house, down a barren street, just as she was, in her wet dress, unhatted, red-faced. [MASK] surmised she was being taken to a place where plants were sold.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Wully	[MASK] felt his heart beginning to beat furiously. She was going to refuse him, in spite of all he had done. There was an awful moment. The room seemed to be hushed and waiting. It was terrible, the length of that moment of silence.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Allen	He hadn’t felt such a nervous hesitancy since the first time he went into action. He remembered only too well the last time he had really stirred her displeasure. [MASK] and he had quarreled, and had nursed their anger, in spite of her remonstrances, for two days.
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Chirstie	He had all but gained the house, when out of the door shot [MASK], crying out a cry unintelligible. Out of the door and down towards the corn she flew. It gave him a startle, as he said afterwards. He didn’t know what terrible thing might have happened.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dod	“Can’t a girl grieve for her mother without being called daft? That’s no way for a man to speak!” [MASK] was abashed, but unconvinced. “She’s not grieving for mother,” he answered, defending himself.
<name>John</name>	John	Wully	She had taken a seat just as far away from him as the room permitted. She sat about her knitting industriously. Sometimes she raised her eyes to look into the fire, but never once did she raise them to satisfy [MASK]’s hunger.
<name>Janet</name>	Janet	Isobel	The mother herself had come upon it. Had the child been stolen away for some evil purpose, and flung back later to die? No one would ever know. “The wee bones were all white, [MASK]!”
<name>John</name>	John	John	He remained on guard, not realizing how the hours were passing, till he heard [MASK] riding hurriedly in home. He went to look at the clock then. It was midnight. The storm was almost upon them. The thunder was growling about its coming.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Chirstie	It was wonderful how completely [MASK] was sheltered from reproach. Though her humiliation was gossiped about by the hour, after all, the gossipers had to remember her mother, and, sighing, grant the daughter some little toleration.
<name>He</name>	He	Wully	He tried to stand near enough her to support her. When the invocations ceased, everyone in the room lifted his head--except the bride. The minister explained interminably the nature of holy matrimony. He exhorted the pair to mutual faithfulness. [MASK] felt her tremble.
<name>Abner</name>	Abner	Wully	And now when the iron horse was here to serve them, when their millennium was at hand, [MASK] was going to quit farming! (They never called the railroad anything but the iron horse at that time and place.) Hadn’t they prayed for its coming?
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Dod	He had gone again to her desperately one evening, determined to find out what it all meant. She had indeed been alone when he came within sight, but, seeing him, she had called sharply to [MASK] to come and sit beside her.
<name>Almanzo</name>	Almanzo	Alex	They were to have a new house! The lumber was to be hauled at once. She was that glad she hadn’t been able to wait for [MASK], but had gone in ahead, to see about it. It was all settled.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Wully	She knew he wouldn’t be able to keep it to himself. That hour [MASK] came to a great decision. He had been considering for some time a proposition a cousin of his had made to him, a son of the Squire’s.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Wully	“A lot he knows about waiting!” thought [MASK], half angrily. “Thirteen of us!” “You tell mother about it, father,” he pleaded, knowing his entreaty useless. “I _will_ not!” “I wish you would.
<name>Angus</name>	Angus	Wully	Between the visits of the ragged lairds and their offspring, [MASK] got so much sleep that on the fourth day he announced himself able to help with the fall plowing. His mother refused to have such a suggestion considered, and they compromised on his digging carrots in the garden.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Chirstie	[MASK]’s face showed how exciting the scene was to her. She looked from group to group. She considered a foreign woman with a handkerchief tied on her head, whose tiny baby coughed and wheezed distressingly. She longed to say something sympathetic to the stolid mother.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Chirstie	Who could have made a statement more paternal than that? “I want his face against mine!” And he got the picture taken that way, in the end. They sought the street again. [MASK] was rather overcome by her husband’s grandness.
<name>He</name>	He	Wully	there would never be another! It was his mother she thought most about! What would his mother ever do when she heard it? That was nothing! [MASK] would go and explain it all to her, after his fashion--falsely, his wife insisted on saying wretchedly.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Dod	He said, confusedly; “Look here, [MASK]. You oughtn’t to talk that way! Not at this time, I mean--you can’t speak ill of the dead, you know.” “I ain’t said half the truth!”
<name>Ratty</name>	Ratty	Sarah	It wasn’t at all likely anybody was coming. Yet in case anything so unusual was happening, he would just have a look. [MASK] waddled after him. Ship ahoy! Was that really something moving down there in the further slough?
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Allen	Had there not been times when he and [MASK] had made bets about which one would begin chilling first, when malaria, like everything else, had been a joke with them? She had never seen a child as unhappy, as irritable as her Wully was now.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Wully	Homesick for a hint of old-country decency, she hung the walls of her cabin with the linen sheets of her dowry, sheets that must have come out of the poisonous ship. [MASK]’s mother admired that immaculate room without one sigh of envy.
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Chirstie	That was why she was afraid of him! That was why she was defending herself with that poor old gun! This was why she had left her uncle’s house, and avoided others! [MASK], betrayed and desolate. Oh, it was well he was trained in killing!
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Wully	the stranger would be welcome, he had said he knew he was some great man by the way he spoke to his floundering horses. Oh, surely in that wilderness [MASK] had known the better ways of living. And he had chosen despicable ways!
<name>Abner</name>	Abner	Wully	The year’s work in the fields was over. [MASK] had sold from sixty of the acres for which his father had paid two hundred and ten dollars in sixty-four, wheat worth three thousand and sixty dollars. He had his house all paid for now.
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	McLaughlin	And then he said: “I wouldn’t punish you if you were my man, [MASK]. And I don’t see why I should because you aren’t.” And he called an orderly and told him to take the men to a mess.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Isobel	Whereupon his mother replied that he wouldn’t stay away now if he could by any means get back to his home. And then she wailed, through a moment of silence; “If I but knew he was dead, [MASK]! Not wanting, some place!
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Chirstie	He had remarked to one neighbor and another that he wanted some man to bring his wood home for hire. But he found no man willing to do his work. [MASK] would have to take the baby and go to her father’s or his mother’s.
<name>George</name>	George	Dod	“What’s she sitting with that gun in her hands for, [MASK]? Does she shoot many chickens?” “Her? She couldn’t hit a barn. She’s afraid. That’s what’s the matter with her.” “What’s she afraid of?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Wully	His voice was so suggestive, so leering, that [MASK] sat up. “It’s one o’clock!” he hastened to announce. “We ought to be going on!” He woke all the lads up. They started by twos and threes back towards the creek.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Wully	[MASK] had wanted to get her one the fall before, but she had said that there were so many things that they had to buy for their house that they really couldn’t afford the coat. She still protested that she really didn’t need it.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Dod	You say that to her, [MASK], and to-morrow I’ll ride over and see what it is. You tell her we’ll fix everything for her.” He went away in uncertainty and distress. He ought to tell his mother how things were.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Wully	Every man that’s spent a day hunting him ought to give him a--beating! [MASK], he’d never do that! I think he’s--he’s dead!” “Mother, mother! Don’t you cry so! It’ll be all right.
<name>Essie</name>	Essie	Flora	Since by that she meant, of course, naughty children, her question seemed indeed unanswerable. Now they sat eating lustily their cornmeal, and she talked with leisure and understanding. When the meal was finished, [MASK] handed her father The Book again.
