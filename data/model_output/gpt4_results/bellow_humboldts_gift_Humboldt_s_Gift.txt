<name>God</name>	God	Spirit	They inculcate certain pictures into us of which we are “normally” unaware. Among other things they wish to make us see the concealed divinity of other human beings. They show man how he can cross by means of thought the abyss that separates him from [MASK].
<name>Zossimov</name>	Zossimov	Cantabile	The main point, however, was that [MASK] would see an old guy with a young chick and that he might try, as they say, to get leverage out of this. I want it to be clear, however, that I speak as a person who had lately received or experienced light.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Szathmar	[MASK] can act like a jerk, but he’s not a monster.” “All right, I’ll unleash the husband. You think your buddy wouldn’t be disbarred? He would be—fucking-A-right.”
<name>Throckmorton</name>	Throckmorton	Cantabile	Why don’t you gentlemen ask the people you represent whether they’d like to have a look at it. My price for looking—for looking only, mind you—is five thousand dollars.” “That is what we want,” said [MASK].
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Cantabile	I, too, felt red in the face. [MASK], on the other hand, was peculiarly white. He breathed the air as if he were stealing it. He had a look of eagerness and of distemper. The Thunderbird, puffing fumes, was beginning to block traffic.
<name>Then</name>	Then	Appalled	The shatterproof windows had held up, but they looked spat on all over. The windshield was covered with white fracture-blooms. It had suffered a kind of crystalline internal hemorrhage. [MASK], I nearly broke down, I felt like swooning.
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Thaxter	You know what I mean. That blonde runt introduced you to her dad, and since then it’s all been really spooky.” “I wish you’d finish what you started to say,” [MASK] turned again to me.
<name>Frances</name>	Frances	Demmie	“Thanks, no, it isn’t cold enough for this Eskimo stuff.” “You’re refusing on your own? Aren’t you even going to ask [MASK]?” “She’d haul off and hit me. Perhaps you’d like to try her.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Thaxter	Three times I changed planes to get there, and then I was met at a dirt landing strip by a peon in sandals who drove me in a new Cadillac to [MASK]’s villa, fully staffed with Indian servants.
<name>He</name>	He	Humboldt	Even to go to the bathroom, she needed permission. Also he seemed to have punched her in the eye. She sat quietly and low in her chair, arms folded and long legs crossed, but she had a shiner. [MASK] finally spoke of it himself.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Wolper	I felt completely at home with her old ironware and hand-knitted pot holders. The house was all that [MASK] left her, she said. “When I saw how fast he was losing money on the horses I insisted that he should make the title over.”
<name>Dean</name>	Dean	Naomi	Looking at those mountains I frankly didn’t care much for the way the world was made, [MASK]." “What do you mean by that?” “Oh I don’t know, but you get disaffected from nature and all its miracles and stupendous achievements, from subatomic to galactic.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Casey	[MASK] was retired, a partial invalid, and he was seeking ways to protect his fortune from inflationary shrinkage. Also he was looking for action. Action or death. Money can’t mark time. Now that I was committed to spiritual investigation, many matters presented themselves to me in a clearer light.
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Charlie	Look, [MASK], why don’t you marry me again? For starters we could stop the legal fight. We should become reunited.” “Is this a serious proposition?” “It’s what the girls want more than anything. Think it over.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Renata	Did it mean more than that one never knew when one was going to meet an interesting man? The serious question was whether I, with all my thoughts, or because of them, would ever be able to understand what sort of girl [MASK] was.
<name>Remedios</name>	Remedios	Renata	The kid began to cry. The Senora couldn’t calm him and accused me of corrupting him, attaching him to myself with chocolates. “You’ve bribed the boy with sweets.” “I hope [MASK] is happy in her new state,” I said.
<name>Wolfe</name>	Wolfe	Durnwald	And what about the people at the Downtown Club.” “Lots of good this guy [MASK] will do you. He’s the professor’s professor. And nobody can interest him. He’s heard it or read it all.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Renata	The will is a link which connects the soul to the world as-it-is. Through the will the soul frees itself from distraction and mere dreams. But when [MASK] told me to tune out and meditate she struck a note of malice.
<name>Enrique</name>	Enrique	Kathleen	He said that I had betrayed him, that I, his blood-brother, had broken a sacred covenant, that I was conspiring with [MASK], that I had set the cops on him, and that I had cheated him.
<name>Roosevelt</name>	Roosevelt	Hopkins	A better journalist than I would ever be, he was also a famous bohemian dissenter and revolutionist. Why had I been so kind to the New Deal and seen so much merit in [MASK]? I was forever sneaking praises of the American system of government into my books.
<name>Wilmot</name>	Wilmot	Huggins	“Abroad,” I said. “Nice young lady you’re with. Terribly att-att-ractive.” [MASK]’ fluency was increased, not impeded, by his stammer. The boulders in a mountain stream show you how fast the water is flying.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Thaxter	“You’re being a nervous Nellie. This is a trying moment, sure. Exactly why you have to watch it all the more. A plus forte raison." You knew that [MASK] was in earnest when he spoke French.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Denise	“Maybe you can wind the whole thing up now. Today.” “How? I’ve surrendered five times. Each time I surrender [MASK] and her guy up their demands.” “In just a few days thank God I’m getting you out of here.
<name>Shakespeare</name>	Shakespeare	Rouault	But it seemed to me that there were few faces like his, with the ferocious profile that brought to mind the Latin word rapax or one of [MASK]’s crazed death-dealing arbitrary kings. We passed his enterprises, the Peony Condominiums, the Trumbull Arms.
<name>Thaddeus</name>	Thaddeus	Thaxter	I warned you even, that if you dug that big hole next to your house you’d undermine the foundations.” “Well, it isn’t very serious,” said [MASK]. “The lumber company can damn well dismantle it all and take back their wood.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Demmie	He told me I had a bad case of tinia crura. So I stayed among these cannibals, hoping that [MASK] would show up.” “Were they cannibals?” “They had eaten the first group of missionaries that came there.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Cantabile	“Let’s be more realistic. This will be viewed mainly as a minor nuisance claim.” “What do you mean minor nuisance? It’s the whole picture,” [MASK] shouted. “We can kill your group!”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Renata	I was passionately attached to her because she was [MASK]. She had an additional value, too—she knew a lot about me. I had a vested interest in her because I had told her so much about myself.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Corcoran	[MASK] has enough imagination to write a wonderful book, but he is enslaved by middle-class attitudes. As the wicked flee when none pursueth, so does the middle-class wrestle when none contendeth. They cried out for freedom, it came down on them in a flood.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Renata	It doesn’t take much to make them glow. I’m that way myself. Why withhold your kindliness from them when you see the glow appearing? To increase [MASK]’s happiness, I might have said, “Why of course, kid.
<name>Norma</name>	Norma	Humboldt	I was having a tinny-tasting sandwich of crumbling wet tuna fish at the Greek’s across the street when they summoned me to the telephone. I took the call in the star’s dressing room. “I’ve talked to a lawyer,” shouted [MASK].
<name>Kepler</name>	Kepler	Humboldt	But I know that he would understand less than [MASK] did. The question is this: why should we assume that the series ends with us? The fact is, I suspect, that we occupy a point within a great hierarchy that goes far far beyond ourselves.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Charlie	From the motel last night I had talked with her on the telephone. I asked her what was happening. She said, “I’m not going into this on a transatlantic call, [MASK], it’s too expensive.” But then she wept for two solid minutes.
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Charlie	And what you really want is to get rid of everybody, to tune out and be a law unto yourself. Just you and your misunderstood heart, [MASK]. You couldn’t bear a serious relationship, that’s why you got rid of me and the children.
<name>Steiner</name>	Steiner	Durnwald	“Nonsense!” he said. “Simply nonsense! I’ve looked into that.” In the learned world anthroposophy was not respectable. [MASK] dismissed the subject sharply because he wished to protect his esteem for me.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Charlie	“It depends how they sock it to him downtown today. [MASK], I had another idea on the way out here. We could tape you reading some of your essays and articles and rent the tapes to colleges and universities. You’d get a pretty nice little income out of that.
<name>Rearden</name>	Rearden	Cantabile	On these doors [MASK] gave a coded set of knocks: three times; pause; once; then a final once. It was odd that this should be necessary, but after all a man who could give such a return on money must be fighting off investors.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Humboldt	The melanin was on the back of her hands and on her dark face still darker spots as large as her eyes. [MASK] bent over to speak to her, and she answered nothing but stared out with some powerful female grievance.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Charlie	The women want a developer to size this property up. Bid on it. It’ll take millions, [MASK], it’s a whole damn peninsula. I’ve got some Cubans of my own, exiles who knew these heirs in the old country.
<name>He</name>	He	Cantabile	Not really. I don’t know what he thought, but what I thought was perfectly clear to me. Absorbed in determining what a human being is, I went along with him. [MASK] may have believed that he was abusing a passive man. Not at all.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Polly	“I couldn’t say. That’s beyond me,” said [MASK]. “He’s a very intricate person. What is that beautiful medal on the wall?” “It’s my French decoration, framed by my lady friend. She’s an interior decorator.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Sewell	Thou art free! [MASK] was stinking to you. He snubbed you and you’re sore at him, too, don’t deny it. But you can’t pay attention. You’re always mooning in your private mind about some kind of cosmic destiny.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Denise	Anyway, [MASK] would have laughed with happiness at the sight of this ruined car. And I? You would have thought that being divorced I had es- caped the marital “I-told-you-so.” But here I was, supplying it myself.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Grandma	Have a good flight with [MASK]. Don’t cry, kid,” I said. I was threatened by tears myself. I left the lobby and walked toward the park. The danger of being struck by speeding cars, masses of them battering from all directions, prevented me from shedding more tears.
<name>Lucia</name>	Lucia	Renata	This was not a Sunday, but I was in my Palm Court pulpit. As for [MASK], smiling—her dark eyes, red mouth, white teeth, smooth throat—though she interrupted and heckled during these sermons she got a kick out of the way I delivered them.
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Magnasco	He says you’ll get me if he doesn’t—his blood-brother.” “I won’t lay a hand on you,” I said. “Why don’t you leave town for a while?” “Leave?” said [MASK].
<name>Ted</name>	Ted	Charlie	Then he said, “Okay, [MASK], I know what’s on your mind. When you come back here to see me you want to be shown those birds.” He referred to the museum’s great collection of birds, hoarded up over decades and stored in classified drawers.
<name>Orpheus</name>	Orpheus	Kathleen	He daubed it on himself, making a fearful mask, and he broke into the rooms of beautiful maidens who screamed and fell unconscious. [MASK], more fabulous than scientists, more beautiful than any of the ladies, sat with a hazy absent freckled half-smile.
<name>She</name>	She	Renata	The old guy remembered her mother and he was pleased to think that he might have a daughter but he was cagey and said that legal recognition was absolutely out of the question. His family would disinherit him. But he wasn’t the man anyway. [MASK] said there was no resemblance.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Renata	(I never knew about the toes until [MASK] taught me.) Aiter all this I simply went back to bed and prayed my upset soul to go out for a while, please, and let the poor body have some rest.
<name>Artie</name>	Artie	Renata	“But he did put you here,” said [MASK]. “Just till he could iron out some problems. The whole week before he died he was looking for an apartment for us both. Once we lived together for three months and that was heaven.
<name>Yoko</name>	Yoko	Hortense	From moment to moment I more and more admired and loved [MASK]. What a wonderful and sensitive woman she was, really, and what emotional versatility the Kabuki mask concealed. Her gruffness had put me off. But behind the gruffness, what goodness, what a rose garden.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	George	I would sit up suddenly in the night with a crying fit, sometimes waking [MASK] who came out and turned on a lamp, his wrinkled pajamas baring powerful legs. He made this measured statement: “A man in his fifties who can break up and cry over a girl is a man I respect.”
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Ulick	He was burned up, too, naturally, but these Gonzales cousins could not be freely hated now. [MASK] said, “What is it—some hardware, a touch of paint?” He rose, heavy, and said, “Let’s stop now and get a drink and something to eat.”
<name>She</name>	She	Kathleen	He hid the ignition key from her and kept her in purdah. He was a handsome man still, [MASK] adored him. He, however, suffered keen Jewish terrors in the country. He was an Oriental, she a Christian maiden, and he was afraid.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Humboldt	That’s why they love poets. This is the truth about girls.” [MASK] was the real thing, certainly. But by and by he stopped being a beautiful young man and the prince of conversationalists. He grew a belly, he became thick in the face.
<name>Mooney</name>	Mooney	Waldemar	[MASK] was wearing all the mourning he could find in his gambler’s wardrobe. Hat, trousers, and shoes were black, but his sport coat had large red houndstooth checks and in the sunshine of a delayed overwarm spring the fuzz was shining.
<name>Corley</name>	Corley	Waldemar	“Like a message from an old friend in the next world.” [MASK] looked at her, obstinate. “But suppose it is valuable, why should I get screwed? Am I entitled to get something out of it or not?
<name>Salinger</name>	Salinger	Humboldt	Anyway, I’m not here to discuss adolescent American love-myths—this was how [MASK] talked. Still, he said, I’d like you to listen to this. Then he began to narrate in his original style. He described and intricately embroidered.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Waldemar	“I wouldn’t dream of doing you out of anything,” I said. “If it has got value Fll tell you honestly.” “Why don’t we get a lawyer to draw up a legal document?” said [MASK].
<name>Waldo</name>	Waldo	Cantabile	“I’m almost sorry about that. I’d love to go along, really.” “I expect .you to get busy,” I said. “I felt that [MASK] was going to pull something like this.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Charlie	He caught up with me on the Champs-Elysees, saying, “Don’t be sore, [MASK]. That’s just the breed of dog I am, to protect things like that claim check. What if you’re mugged and rolled?
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Renata	She had gone into the bathroom and taken off her clothes. After undoing the top button I might have stopped, but I didn’t. Of course I had appraised [MASK] and tried to guess how she might be. My generous guesses had been far behind the facts.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Mary	I bought [MASK] the bike and then shouted at her, “For Christ’s sake, don’t ride over the curbs, you’ll bust hell out of the wheel.” But this was an explosion of despair over my failure to know the kid’s heart.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Thaxter	while [MASK] was coming in underneath, trying to be persuasive—I tuned out and gave my mind to one of my theories. Some people embrace their gifts with gratitude. Others have no use for them and can think only of overcoming their weaknesses.
<name>Ysolde</name>	Ysolde	Denise	He said that she was a great beauty but not altogether human. Certainly [MASK]’s huge radial amethyst eyes in combination with a low-lined forehead and sharp sibylline teeth supported this interpretation. She is exquisite, and terribly fierce.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Denise	She stood up and opened her purse. “Here are a few letters that came to the old address.” I looked at the postmarks. “They’re months old. You might have turned them over before, [MASK].” “What’s the difference?
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	George	“Well, I know you love her,” said [MASK]. “When she locked you out because she had another guy in there with her and you came to me crying—you remember what I said? A man your age sobbing over a girl is a man I respect.
<name>Coach</name>	Coach	Scottie	I knew what this loss of sphincter control meant. Mechanical resuscitation equipment was sent for but nobody knew how to operate it. At times when I pushed too hard at the game, [MASK], the athletic director, told me to quit.
<name>He</name>	He	Fm	He’s more like his dad. You could do something for him. As a good man who’s led a cranky life, you might reach him. He’s already begun a cranky career.” “So what’s missing is the goodness [MASK] alleged to have.”
<name>Tralala</name>	Tralala	Renata	Let’s figure this out together. What does a broad like that need with a real father? She’s already got this old pimp mother. [MASK] wouldn’t know what to do with a father. She’s got just the daddy she needs, a sex daddy.
<name>Stuart</name>	Stuart	Humboldt	I feel as if I’ve been living in a suburb of reality, and commuting back and forth. That’s got to stop. I have to locate myself. I’m here” (here on earth, he meant) “to do something, something good.” “I know, [MASK].
<name>Nabokov</name>	Nabokov	Cheerful	[MASK], I dug out my Humboldt papers. I piled notebooks, letters, diaries, and manuscripts on the coffee table and on the covered radiator behind the sofa. Then I lay down, sighing, pulling off my shoes.
<name>gentlemen</name>	gentlemen	Americans	“That’s right. You’re no Vesco. You love your country. Well, you’re not fit to have this money. Maybe the other guys should get it from you. People like the President pretended to be fine clean [MASK] from The Saturday Evening Post.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Denise	[MASK] had expected to do as much with me. But oddly enough her paternal inheritance was stronger than the maternal. On days when she was curt and tough, in her high tense voice you heard that old precinct captain and bagman, her grandfather.
<name>Nikos</name>	Nikos	Thaxter	So here we were. A happy blessed day. The sky was giving its marvelous temperate pulsating blue heat, while oranges hung about us. [MASK] wore his favorite outdoor garment the black cloak, and the toes of his bare feet were pressed together like Smyrna figs.
<name>911</name>	911	Renata	Just because your soul is being torn to pieces doesn’t mean that you stop analyzing the phenomena. I restrained my real desire, which was to scream. I recognized that I would have to recompose myself unassisted. I didn’t dial [MASK].
<name>Everyone</name>	Everyone	Death	Are you provided? No? But why not? Can you afford such neglect? Do you know how they will bury you? Amazing! Has anybody talked to you about conditions in the new cemeteries? Why, they’re nothing but slums. [MASK] deserves dignity.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Humboldt	“I’ll tell you later. But you did great.” [MASK] had started to pack, to stuff his briefcase, as he did at all decisive moments. Unbuckling, he threw back the slack flap and began to pull out certain books and manuscripts and pill bottles.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Maggie	I’m it.’ Then you award the contract. Of course nobody can deliver and everybody gets sore as hell. Well, [MASK] isn’t your type. Why don’t you tell me about your wife?” “Don’t put temptation before me.
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	Kathleen	These high dreaming states, always being punctured and torn by American flak, were what he wanted [MASK] to preserve for him. Enchantment. She did her best to help him with the enchantment. But he could never come up with enough enchantment or dream material to sheathe himself in.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Charlie	I want to tell you you can trust [MASK]. Long ago, soon as I laid eyes on him, I said to myself. This kid’s heart is right up there in his face. He’s getting along in years himself.
<name>Duncan</name>	Duncan	Shakespeare	[MASK] was right. There’s no art to find the mind’s construction in the face: he was a gentleman on whom I built an absolute trust. But now recovering from shock he’s building a case against the said gentleman.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Chuck	He meant a large second mortage. “Now listen, [MASK], I know you need income. That crazy broad won’t be satisfied until she’s got your liver in her deepfreeze. I’m astonished, really astonished, that you didn’t put away some dough.
<name>Stavrogin</name>	Stavrogin	Ulick	Also he was looking for action. Action or death. Money can’t mark time. Now that I was committed to spiritual investigation, many matters presented themselves to me in a clearer light. I saw, for instance, what volcanic emotions [MASK] was dissembling.
<name>Wolfe</name>	Wolfe	Humboldt	Not to labor the matter too much, I had lost most of the money that [MASK] had accused me of making. The dough came between us immediately. He put through a check for thousands of dollars. I didn’t contest this. I didn’t want to go to law.
<name>Alfred</name>	Alfred	Humboldt	And I’ve written him and phoned him. No soap.” “Probably a phone call isn’t good enough. He’s holding out for a real visit. You can’t blame him for that, if nobody comes. Wasn’t [MASK]’s mother the last of his sisters?
<name>Truman</name>	Truman	Humboldt	I didn’t care for most of his literary friends. They came to watch the show [MASK] put on, his routines. When they left, and he was still inspired, he’d go after me. He was a sociable person.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Sewell	“[MASK] really is a rat,” he said. “I thought you were old friends.” “Long acquaintance isn’t friendship. Did you like him? He received you. He condescended, he was snotty, you were treated like dirt.
<name>Alfred</name>	Alfred	Denise	She’ll give you something to grin about, that fat broad.” From insult [MASK] went into prophecy. “Your mental life is goin" to dry out. You’re sacrificing it to your erotic needs (if that’s the term for what you have).
<name>K.</name>	K.	Thaxter	At the same time I didn’t really believe that it was all so very natural or easy. I suspected—no, I actually knew better. “So if you’re thinking about payment, I haven’t got anything to give you on account,” said [MASK].
<name>McClintock</name>	McClintock	Sewell	A bit heavy for frolic, in his charcoal-gray flannels, he tried to take a light manner with me. “I hear you guys are going great in [MASK]’s program, that’s the scuttlebutt.”
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Longstaff	“The whole thing came back to me.” “Is [MASK] still so handsome and distinguished? He must be an old man. And I’ll bet you pestered him about those old times.” “Yes, I reminded him.” “You would.
<name>Alas</name>	Alas	Humboldt	Then he began to look, himself, toward the collective phenomena. As his own self, he had opened his mouth and uttered some delightful verses. But then his heart failed him. Ah, [MASK], how sorry I am.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Charlie	“I won’t allow it. He’ll attack you. I couldn’t bear for you to fight, [MASK]. He’ll hit you, and he’s twice your size and crazy and strong. Besides, I won’t have you disturbed when you’re doing the play.
<name>Werther</name>	Werther	Renata	A different sort of beauty, more internal, had begun its development. This internal beauty, manifested in romantic art and poetry, was the result of a free union of the human spirit with the spirit of nature. So [MASK] really was a peculiar phantom.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Charlie	And stronger. Suddenly you’re here.” “When you get into a tizzy, [MASK], you’re hopeless. Try to check yourself. I’m here to do you a major favor, for Christ’s sake. Don’t you trust me?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Charlie	“[MASK], how much will they charge for the bodywork on your car? Did you take it back to the dealer? I hope you keep away from those rip-off specialists. Four hundred bucks a day for one grease monkey. What crooks!
<name>Wolfe</name>	Wolfe	Rinaldo	Hawthorn was not [MASK]’s flower. White calla lily was more like it. His nose was particularly white and his large nostrils, correspondingly dark, reminded me of an oboe when they dilated. People so distinctly seen have power over me.
<name>himself</name>	himself	Humboldt	He was an only son, with four older sisters and a doting mother, much pampered, idle, a poolroom bum, a dropout, mooching from his sisters and stealing from their purses. Eventually he placed [MASK] in the senior position as well.
