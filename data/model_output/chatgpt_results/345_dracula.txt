<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Lucy	There I wrong him; I _know_ he never will--he is too true a gentleman. I said to him, for I could see that his heart was breaking:-- "I loved dear [MASK], and I know what she was to you, and what you were to her.
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Harker	To-night and to-morrow we can get ready, and then, if all be well, we four can set out on our journey." "We four?" said [MASK] interrogatively, looking from one to another of us. "Of course!"
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Mina	And afterwards the very memory of it will keep faith crystal clear. [MASK] and I fear to be idle, so we have been over all the diaries again and again. Somehow, although the reality seems greater each time, the pain and the fear seem less.
<name>Ophelia</name>	Ophelia	Ophelia	Well, here I am to-night, hoping for sleep, and lying like [MASK] in the play, with "virgin crants and maiden strewments." I never liked garlic before, but to-night it is delightful! There is peace in its smell; I feel sleep coming already.
<name>Dr. John Seward</name>	Dr. John Seward	Fortunately	The attendant knew the symptoms, and at once summoned aid. [MASK] the men came at a run, and were just in time, for at the stroke of noon he became so violent that it took all their strength to hold him.
<name>Van Helsing</name>	Van Helsing	Quincey	Further and further back he cowered, as we, lifting our crucifixes, advanced. The moonlight suddenly failed, as a great black cloud sailed across the sky; and when the gaslight sprang up under [MASK]'s match, we saw nothing but a faint vapour.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Mina	I thought it was the best thing for him, so did not disturb him. In about twenty minutes he woke up, and said to me quite cheerfully:-- "Why, [MASK], have I been asleep! Oh, do forgive me for being so rude.
<name>the Battle of Trafalgar</name>	the Battle of Trafalgar	Waterloo	He is a funny old man. He must be awfully old, for his face is all gnarled and twisted like the bark of a tree. He tells me that he is nearly a hundred, and that he was a sailor in the Greenland fishing fleet when [MASK] was fought.
<name>Mr. Hyde</name>	Mr. Hyde	Renfield	With regard to patient, [MASK], there is more to say. He has had another outbreak, which might have had a dreadful ending, but which, as it fortunately happened, was unattended with any unhappy results.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Renfield	_ _1 October, 4 a. m._--Just as we were about to leave the house, an urgent message was brought to me from [MASK] to know if I would see him at once, as he had something of the utmost importance to say to me.
<name>vampire</name>	vampire	Dracula	In the records are such words as 'stregoica'--witch, 'ordog,' and 'pokol'--Satan and hell; and in one manuscript this very [MASK] is spoken of as 'wampyr,' which we all understand too well.
<name>Mr. Norton</name>	Mr. Norton	Renfield	Not a detail that I can recall must be forgotten; in all calmness I must proceed. When I came to [MASK]'s room I found him lying on the floor on his left side in a glittering pool of blood.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Arthur	But the Professor's face was set, and he stood watch in hand and with his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on [MASK]. I could hear my own heart beat. Presently he said in a soft voice: "Do not stir an instant.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Lucy	We got a bath and carried [MASK] out as she was and placed her in it. Whilst we were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door. One of the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and opened it.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Mina	[MASK] and I both felt so, and simultaneously we each took one of the old man's hands and bent over and kissed it. Then without a word we all knelt down together, and, all holding hands, swore to be true to each other.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Are	Raised outcry, and all came on deck. Thorough search, but no one found. [MASK] now without second mate, and crew in a panic. Mate and I agreed to go armed henceforth and wait for any sign of cause. * * * * * _30 July_.--Last night.
<name>he</name>	he	Jonathan	Manlike, they had told me to go to bed and sleep; as if a woman can sleep when those she loves are in danger! I shall lie down and pretend to sleep, lest [MASK] have added anxiety about me when he returns.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucy	" I was much touched by their kindness. Perhaps it is because I am weak at present, and perhaps because it was on [MASK]'s account, that their devotion was manifested; for over and over again have I seen similar instances of woman's kindness.
<name>Abdullah</name>	Abdullah	Jonathan	He did not delay notwithstanding this, for as [MASK], with desperate energy, attacked one end of the chest, attempting to prize off the lid with his great Kukri knife, he attacked the other frantically with his bowie.
<name>London</name>	London	Lucy	I know your idea of duty to your father, and you are right to stick to it; but, if need be, I shall send you word to come at once to [MASK]; so do not be over-anxious unless you hear from me."
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	July._--There	* * * * * _8 [MASK] is a method in his madness, and the rudimentary idea in my mind is growing. It will be a whole idea soon, and then, oh, unconscious cerebration! you will have to give the wall to your conscious brother.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Mina	More than all do I rejoice that this, our first--and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous--step has been accomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet Madam [MASK] or troubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and smells of horror which she might never forget.
<name>Victor</name>	Victor	Arthur	[MASK] threw himself on his knees, and hid his face in his hands, as he answered:-- "Do as you will, friend; do as you will. There can be no horror like this ever any more;" and he groaned in spirit.
<name>Estella</name>	Estella	Jonathan	[MASK] thought it would interest me to go into the Row for a while, so we sat down; but there were very few people there, and it was sad-looking and desolate to see so many empty chairs.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Harker	"May I come?" said [MASK]. I nodded, and we all went down the passage together. We found him in a state of considerable excitement, but far more rational in his speech and manner than I had ever seen him.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Lucy	Finally I came to the hall door and found it open. It was not wide open, but the catch of the lock had not caught. The people of the house are careful to lock the door every night, so I feared that [MASK] must have gone out as she was.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Lucy	I think that some day the bishops must get together and see about breeding up a new class of curates, who don't take supper, no matter how they may be pressed to, and who will know when girls are tired. [MASK] is asleep and breathing softly.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Jonathan	Some may not think it so sad for us, but we had both come to so love him that it really seems as though we had lost a father. I never knew either father or mother, so that the dear old man's death is a real blow to me. [MASK] is greatly distressed.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Art	"That will do," he said. "Already?" I remonstrated. "You took a great deal more from [MASK]." To which he smiled a sad sort of smile as he replied:-- "He is her lover, her _fiancé_.
<name>Louise</name>	Louise	Mina	[MASK] opened her eyes; but she did not seem the same woman. There was a far-away look in her eyes, and her voice had a sad dreaminess which was new to me. Raising his hand to impose silence, the Professor motioned to me to bring the others in.
<name>Bertha</name>	Bertha	Lucy	When I came in view again the cloud had passed, and the moonlight struck so brilliantly that I could see [MASK] half reclining with her head lying over the back of the seat. She was quite alone, and there was not a sign of any living thing about.
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	John	Is it not so? Well, I shall explain. To begin, have you ever study the philosophy of crime? 'Yes' and 'No.' You, [MASK], yes; for it is a study of insanity.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Mina	" When he had spoken, [MASK]'s long spell of silence made me look at her. She had fallen back on her pillow asleep; she did not even wake when I had pulled up the blind and let in the sunlight which flooded the room.
<name>August</name>	August	Disraeli	August._--"The unexpected always happens." How well [MASK] knew life. Our bird when he found the cage open would not fly, so all our subtle arrangements were for nought. At any rate, we have proved one thing; that the spells of quietness last a reasonable time.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucy	* * * * * _13 August._--Another quiet day, and to bed with the key on my wrist as before. Again I awoke in the night, and found [MASK] sitting up in bed, still asleep, pointing to the window.
<name>Captain</name>	Captain	Mate	[MASK] angry. Fear there will be some trouble, as either he or the men will do some violence. * * * * * _28 July_.--Four days in hell, knocking about in a sort of maelstrom, and the wind a tempest. No sleep for any one.
<name>Mr. Hyde</name>	Mr. Hyde	Lucy	Devils or no devils, or all the devils at once, it matters not; we fight him all the same." He went to the hall-door for his bag; and together we went up to [MASK]'s room.
<name>Little Dorrit</name>	Little Dorrit	Lucy	" Then seeing poor [MASK] scared, as she might well be, he went on more gently: "Oh, little miss, my dear, do not fear me. I only do for your good; but there is much virtue to you in those so common flowers.
<name>Lily</name>	Lily	Lucy	We had a lovely walk. [MASK], after a while, was in gay spirits, owing, I think, to some dear cows who came nosing towards us in a field close to the lighthouse, and frightened the wits out of us.
<name>Helen</name>	Helen	Lucy	[MASK] came with me, and we went early to our old seat, whilst the cortège of boats went up the river to the Viaduct and came down again. We had a lovely view, and saw the procession nearly all the way.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Quincey	But these shall not occur again. Here we stay until all be well--or ill." [MASK] held out his hand. "Count me in," he said. "You and the Dutchman will tell me what to do, and I'll do it."
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Mina	[MASK] gazed at him fixedly for a few minutes, during which my own heart beat like a trip hammer, for I felt that some crisis was at hand. Gradually her eyes closed, and she sat, stock still; only by the gentle heaving of her bosom could one know that she was alive.
<name>Iago</name>	Iago	Byron	To-night I go to prove it. Dare you come with me?" This staggered me. A man does not like to prove such a truth; [MASK] excepted from the category, jealousy. "And prove the very truth he most abhorred."
<name>Moaning</name>	Moaning	Cattle	I hear water swirling by, level with my ears, and the creaking of wood on wood. [MASK] low far off. There is another sound, a queer one like----" She stopped and grew white, and whiter still. "Go on; go on!
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucy	I hope I did right. I have locked the door, and the key is tied to my wrist, so perhaps I shall not be again disturbed. [MASK] is sleeping soundly; the reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea....
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Arthur	I shall hide this paper in my breast, where they shall find it when they come to lay me out. My dear mother gone! It is time that I go too. Good-bye, dear [MASK], if I should not survive this night.
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Mate	* * * * * On 14 July was somewhat anxious about crew. Men all steady fellows, who sailed with me before. [MASK] could not make out what was wrong; they only told him there was _something_, and crossed themselves.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucy	I did not mention this last, lest it should give her needless pain; but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think of what had occurred with poor [MASK] when the Count had sucked her blood.
<name>Bertha</name>	Bertha	Renfield	* * * * * _Later._--Glad I made the resolution; gladder that I kept to it. I had lain tossing about, and had heard the clock strike only twice, when the night-watchman came to me, sent up from the ward, to say that [MASK] had escaped.
<name>Christ's</name>	Christ's	Lucy	No word shall be lost; and in the good time I shall give them back to you. It's a hard thing I ask, but you will do it, will you not, for [MASK]'s sake?"
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Professor	She opened her eyes, and we all started as she said, sweetly and seemingly with the utmost unconcern:-- "Oh, [MASK], why ask me to do what you know I can't? I don't remember anything."
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Mina	If it should not be so, then the others who have been so good to us shall have remainder. It is now drawing towards the sunset; [MASK]'s uneasiness calls my attention to it. I am sure that there is something on her mind which the time of exact sunset will reveal.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jack	You had better go with [MASK] and the Professor and stay in the Green Park, somewhere in sight of the house; and when you see the door opened and the smith has gone away, do you all come across.
<name>London</name>	London	Jonathan	I feel that I can hardly recall anything of the journey, except that I knew I was coming to [MASK], and, that as I should have to do some nursing, I had better get all the sleep I could.... I found my dear one,
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Renfield	He did not, however, betray himself; he nodded slightly and said: "Go on," in a low voice. [MASK] proceeded:-- "He came up to the window in the mist, as I had seen him often before;
<name>he</name>	he	Smollet	When she came back, I addressed the envelope and stamped it, and when [MASK] had again faithfully promised to post the address when found, I took my way to home. We're on the track anyhow. I am tired to-night, and want sleep.
<name>she</name>	she	Lucy	I did not know what to say, but [MASK] turned the conversation as she said, rising up:-- "Oh, why did you tell us of this? It is my favourite seat, and I cannot leave it; and now I find I must go on sitting over the grave of a suicide."
<name>someone</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	someone (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	Jonathan	After dinner they sent me to bed, and all went off to smoke together, as they said, but I knew that they wanted to tell each other of what had occurred to each during the day; I could see from [MASK]'s manner that he had something important to communicate.
<name>Mr. John Knightley</name>	Mr. John Knightley	Jonathan	I must hide it from [MASK], for if he knew that I had been crying twice in one morning--I, who never cried on my own account, and whom he has never caused to shed a tear--the dear fellow would fret his heart out.
<name>John</name>	John	Professor	Now she threw them down, saying, with half-laughter, and half-disgust:-- "Oh, [MASK], I believe you are only putting up a joke on me. Why, these flowers are only common garlic."
<name>me</name>	me	Lucy	She has not told [MASK], and made me promise secrecy; her doctor told her that within a few months, at most, she must die, for her heart is weakening. At any time, even now, a sudden shock would be almost sure to kill her.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mina	Only for it we should have overtaken the boat long ago; and by now my dear [MASK] would have been free. I fear to think of her, off on the wolds near that horrid place. We have got horses, and we follow on the track.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Jonathan	It is all done; poor dear, dear [MASK], what he must have suffered, what must he be suffering now. He lies on the sofa hardly seeming to breathe, and his whole body appears in collapse. His brows are knit; his face is drawn with pain.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Lucy	For two nights I had hardly had a wink of sleep, and my brain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebral exhaustion. [MASK] was up and in cheerful spirits. When she shook hands with me she looked sharply in my face and said:-- "No sitting up to-night for you.
<name>South Africa</name>	South Africa	Whitby	I saw him leave for [MASK] with as brave a face as I could, but I was sick with apprehension. The effort has, however, done him good. He was never so resolute, never so strong, never so full of volcanic energy, as at present.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Desdemona	I sympathise with poor [MASK] when she had such a dangerous stream poured in her ear, even by a black man. I suppose that we women are such cowards that we think a man will save us from fears, and we marry him.
<name>Alan</name>	Alan	Arthur	And he stood between them like a lion at bay. [MASK] was so taken aback that he did not for a moment know what to do or say; and before any impulse of violence could seize him he realised the place and the occasion, and stood silent, waiting.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Lucy	I think they must originally have had something to do with the abbey. I shall go home too. [MASK] went out visiting with her mother, and as they were only duty calls, I did not go. They will be home by this.
<name>him</name>	him	Skinsky	That was all he knew. We then sought for [MASK], but were unable to find him. One of his neighbours, who did not seem to bear him any affection, said that he had gone away two days before, no one knew whither.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Mina	There, it is all out. [MASK], we have told all our secrets to each other since we were _children_; we have slept together and eaten together, and laughed and cried together; and now, though I have spoken, I would like to speak more.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Lucy	He went to and fro, as if patrolling the house, and was never out of sight of the room where [MASK] lay in her coffin, strewn with the wild garlic flowers, which sent, through the odour of lily and rose, a heavy, overpowering smell into the night.
<name>Mr. Hyde</name>	Mr. Hyde	Renfield	_ _5 June._--The case of [MASK] grows more interesting the more I get to understand the man. He has certain qualities very largely developed; selfishness, secrecy, and purpose. I wish I could get at what is the object of the latter.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Jonathan	No! no! [MASK], you must not leave me. I have suffered enough to-night, God knows, without the dread of his harming you. You must stay with me. Stay with these friends who will watch over you!"
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Jonathan	I give rein to them, and they go on so patient. By-and-by we find all the things which [MASK] have note in that wonderful diary of him. Then we go on for long, long hours and hours.
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Lucy	I am to get his report to-morrow if he can possibly make it. In any case I am to have a letter. "Well, as to the visit. [MASK] was more cheerful than on the day I first saw her, and certainly looked better.
<name>Beth</name>	Beth	Jonathan	"How is your dear mother getting on? I wish I could run up to town for a day or two to see you, dear, but I dare not go yet, with so much on my shoulders; and [MASK] wants looking after still.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	LUCY	He _tells_ me that he loves me more, but I doubt that, for at first he told me that he couldn't love me more than he did then. But this is nonsense. There he is, calling to me. So no more just at present from your loving "[MASK].
<name>James</name>	James	Jonathan	The gaslight which I had left lit for [MASK], but turned down, came only like a tiny red spark through the fog, which had evidently grown thicker and poured into the room. Then it occurred to me that I had shut the window before I had come to bed.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucy	[MASK] was breathing somewhat stertorously, and her face was at its worst, for the open mouth showed the pale gums. Her teeth, in the dim, uncertain light, seemed longer and sharper than they had been in the morning.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Renfield	He said to [MASK] in a tone which did not surprise me at the time, but only when I thought of it afterwards--for it was as of one addressing an equal:-- "Can you not tell frankly your real reason for wishing to be free to-night?
<name>Aragorn</name>	Aragorn	Arthur	We gazed so eagerly that [MASK] rose, for he had been seated on the ground, and came and looked too; and then a glad, strange light broke over his face and dispelled altogether the gloom of horror that lay upon it.
<name>Mother</name>	Mother	Lucy	My brain was all in a whirl, and only that there came through all the multitude of horrors, the holy ray of light that my dear, dear [MASK] was at last at peace, I do not think I could have borne it without making a scene.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Lucy	If we do not act properly and wisely, there may be an inquest, and that paper would have to be produced. I am in hopes that we need have no inquest, for if we had it would surely kill poor [MASK], if nothing else did.
<name>Miss Stoner</name>	Miss Stoner	Lucy	I could hear his voice in the hall, asking the way to the nearest telegraph office. [MASK] chatted with me freely, and seemed quite unconscious that anything had happened. I tried to keep her amused and interested.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Renfield	* * * * * _11 p. m._--I gave [MASK] a strong opiate to-night, enough to make even him sleep, and took away his pocket-book to look at it. The thought that has been buzzing about my brain lately is complete, and the theory proved.
<name>2017</name>	2017	Finis	_ _26 September._--Truly there is no such thing as finality. Not a week since I said "[MASK]," and yet here I am starting fresh again, or rather going on with the same record. Until this afternoon I had no cause to think of what is done.
<name>me</name>	me	Lucy	Poor fellows, neither of them is aware that I know all about the proposals they made to [MASK]. They did not quite know what to say or do, as they were ignorant of the amount of my knowledge; so they had to keep on neutral subjects.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jonathan	It was a hot day for autumn, and there was a comfortable seat in a shady place. After a few minutes' staring at nothing, [MASK]'s eyes closed, and he went quietly into a sleep, with his head on my shoulder.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Arthur	By the way, I forgot to tell you that [MASK] is here. We have such walks and drives, and rides, and rowing, and tennis, and fishing together; and I love him more than ever.
<name>John</name>	John	Jonathan	We have all got arms, even for me a large-bore revolver; [MASK] would not be happy unless I was armed like the rest. Alas! I cannot carry one arm that the rest do; the scar on my forehead forbids that.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mina	He took her hand and patted it as he replied:-- "Ask me nothings as yet. When we have breakfast, then I answer all questions." He would say no more, and we separated to dress. After breakfast [MASK] repeated her question.
<name>Aunt Dahlia</name>	Aunt Dahlia	Arthur	You will be glad to know that I have quite given up walking in my sleep. I think I have not stirred out of my bed for a week, that is when I once got into it at night. [MASK] says I am getting fat.
<name>something</name> (There is no proper name in the given context)	something (There is no proper name in the given context)	Mina	Oh, thank God for good brave men!" With a sigh she sank back again to sleep. I write this now as I am not sleepy, though I must try again. * * * * * _4 October, morning._--Once again during the night I was wakened by [MASK].
<name>Desdemona</name>	Desdemona	Lucy	There was a look of grim satisfaction in his face, as of one who has had a doubt solved. He handed me the paper saying only: "It dropped from [MASK]'s breast when we carried her to the bath."
<name>Nebuchadnezzar</name>	Nebuchadnezzar	Enoch	Far be it from me to arrogate to myself the attributes of the Deity. I am not even concerned in His especially spiritual doings. If I may state my intellectual position I am, so far as concerns things purely terrestrial, somewhat in the position which [MASK] occupied spiritually!
<name>Rachel</name>	Rachel	Lucy	How silly I am. That awful journal gets hold of my imagination and tinges everything with something of its own colour. Of course it is about [MASK]. That habit came back to the poor dear, and that awful night on the cliff must have made her ill.
<name>Beryl</name>	Beryl	Godalming	I fear to think of her, off on the wolds near that horrid place. We have got horses, and we follow on the track. I note this whilst [MASK] is getting ready. We have our arms.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Jonathan	Alas, but that sentence is a puddle; is it not? We can know now what was in the Count's mind, when he seize that money, though [MASK]'s so fierce knife put him in the danger that even he dread. He meant escape.
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Lucy	[MASK] seems to have become as much in love with the spot as I am, and it is hard to get her away from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea or dinner. This afternoon she made a funny remark.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Godalming	Some went up only a few hours before. [MASK] is an amateur fitter himself, and evidently it was he who put the launch in trim again. Finally, they got up the rapids all right, with local help, and are off on the chase afresh.
