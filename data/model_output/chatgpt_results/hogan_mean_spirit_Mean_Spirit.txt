<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Belle	The sheriff talked to the officer from the state, then called up to the cave, “[MASK]. We’re going to do as you ask and leave.” “Leave?” asked one of them. “Leave? You ought to have your head examined.”
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Nola	He opened the door, but the school was vacant. Everyone had gone to the storm cellar. “Where’s the shelter?” he yelled at [MASK]. She pointed and they ran back outside to the entrance of the tornado cellar and beat on the door.
<name>Doc</name>	Doc	Levee	Out of habit, [MASK] put his gun away and picked up his black doctor’s bag. The marshal was first to enter the pale light of the house. They were all nervous, and the invading fog, sliding in through the broken windows, didn’t help.
<name>Red</name>	Red	Nola	[MASK]’s gift. Redcoat. It was a quarter horse; chasing down and trapping another animal was in its blood. He turned away from the mare and walked the dirt road to the Graycloud home. By the time he reached the turnoff to the old house, it was evening
<name>The narrator</name>	The narrator	Stace	“Who else did you show this to?” “Just you.” “Why me?” “I don’t know. I just wanted to. Maybe it’s not good for an old man to keep too many secrets in his head.” [MASK] read a little.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Belle	His best move, he decided, was to have [MASK] taken up into the hills. It seemed her life was in more jeopardy now, as was the rest of the family, not just from the oil money she was keeping silent about, but from the law as well.
<name>Tsitsi</name>	Tsitsi	Grace	She frightened the crows away. Nothing remained, not the body of [MASK], not the beads, gold, not even the medicines that had been buried inside the coffin for the woman’s journey to the other world.
<name>The man</name>	The man	Nola	He smelled of alcohol, and he was apologetic. “I was kidnapped,” he told her. She thought he was lying. She felt heavy all of a sudden, dull. Outside, it was still snowing. [MASK] closed the door and latched it.
<name>Drusilla</name>	Drusilla	Moses	“You ought to know better than that.” By the time [MASK] arrived, she had calmed down, her hand was wrapped in gauze, and she walked around the of- fice rumpled and with disheveled hair. She looked like the devil, at least that’s what the sheriff thought.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Nola	But the first thing [MASK] did was open her trunk and put on an Osage skirt with ribbons and a pair of moccasins, and when she went into the schoolroom dressed in traditional clothing, all of the other students set down their pencils and stared at her.
<name>Mayella</name>	Mayella	Nola	She told about the tragic figure of [MASK] who sat at times in the courtroom with her thin brown hands over her face and was heard to speak to the child growing within her, saying, ‘ ‘Little one, I hear you crying already and your hands and feet not even touching this air.
<name>Dorothy</name>	Dorothy	Nola	She was outlined by the dark gray sky through the car window behind her. The rain crashed down, followed by hailstones so large they dented the automobile. The fragrance of roses was stronger than hail, but then the storm went silent and [MASK] knew a tornado was forming.
<name>Walt</name>	Walt	Moses	“Say, do you need some help?” “I’m almost done.” [MASK] put the mare’s leg down and wiped his forehead with his arm. He didn’t mention the other man’s bad reputation with horses. He breathed a little heavily.
<name>she</name>	she	Belle	No place was safe and they had to bide their time however they could, making themselves silent and invisible until things turned around once again. But they were affaid. Each time [MASK] rounded a comer, she stopped first and listened.
<name>Wovoka</name>	Wovoka	Lionel	It was a faith of survival, of the desire for life. It was water for the thirsty, food for the hungry. It was survival. [MASK] was thirty that year. He was young and taken up with the hope. He believed the prophet Wevokah.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Nola	It was the times, really, with headlights and claims to land multiplying with the birth of a child, and white men marrying Indian women to possess their wife’s and children’s allotments of land. “I see,” was all anyone could say when [MASK] was finished speaking.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Lettie	He could barely even form the words that explained his growing distance from the bureau and from the friend he once trusted, or how he’d begun to feel that everything was hopeless, so he swallowed their anger and distrust without a murmur. [MASK] crossed the floor behind them.
<name>Brindle</name>	Brindle	Hale	Inside its limits, with access to the spring water, were several of the new cattle [MASK] had been trying to breed. A short time later, they arrived at the Indian Agency and demanded an explanation from the administrator of the bureau. “Yes,” he said.
<name>Velma</name>	Velma	Louise	[MASK] walked beside the wagon. Her face had taken on an expression of strength and resolve. There was no more question for her about who she was or which people she was bound to. Almost overnight she’d given up the white world.
<name>Scrap</name>	Scrap	Ben	Behind him was a dump yard of broken and discarded vehicles that had once held the proud Indian men and women as they drove over the curved earth. [MASK] stood at a makeshift table. He stood with his legs apart the way he thought a man should stand.
<name>her father</name>	her father	Rena	With [MASK]’s arm around her, she walked away, then looked back, hoping against all hope that her mother would move, that her voice would call out the way it had always done, “Come here, little one,” but there were only the sounds of frogs and insects.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Nola	[MASK] knew enough not to resist. She accompanied him, while the other students watched, down the school steps to- ward the car. She looked pale and small, but held herself as straight as she could. The motor of the car was idling.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Martha	From outside the circle of firelight, he saw [MASK]. She was singing with the older folks and she was more beautiful than ever before. He stopped and looked awhile, then walked the rest of the way there. He sat beside her on the ground and held her hand.
<name>Tayo</name>	Tayo	Cry	One day [MASK] ran up to the bluffs and tried to describe a marathon to her people. “The dancers never stop. They dance until they are dead on their feet. They eat standing up. They hold each other like one tree leaning on another.”
<name>Pony</name>	Pony	Benoit	They stared through the bars at the man they’d known all their lives as a fancy-dressing Indian. They’d heard he set a nitro fuse in the coalbin of his own home, but they couldn’t believe it. [MASK] had a reputation for being a decent, law-abiding man.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Horse	He stood up weakly and went inside the office. The Hill People followed him and they leaned over the nervous dentist’s shoulder to peer into [MASK]’s mouth as they watched the operation. It made the dentist nervous.
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Nola	[MASK] was slow to recover from her mother’s death. Her face reflected her tragic and violent loss. She still slept with her eyes wide open, not letting her guard down even in the darkness of night with the watchers posted outside and the Graycloud women taking turns beside her silent bed like armed sentries.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Benoit	She looked reluctant. She said, “We don’t know who to trust.” He nodded. “I don’t know whom you can trust either.” But she told him about the blast and fire and how [MASK] was not ever tried in court.
<name>the man</name>	the man	Horse	The priest felt left out. It had been a long time, anyway, since he’d been around people, and he felt tense, his face reddening at times. When [MASK] opened his cedar box, the shy priest said he was going outside to do his prayers.
<name>Abner</name>	Abner	Palmer	[MASK] had kept store records and was nearly always a witness when a lien was filed against an Indian’s property, so he too was implicated, but he’d been another citizen the Indians knew well and liked. But the plans went awry, the man said.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Benoit	She covered her face with the blanket. [MASK] said to her. “Don’t cry. We don’t have time for tears tonight.” “I can’t help it,” she said. He pulled back the blanket and smiled at her face.
<name>the devil</name>	the devil	Indians	She eyed the sheriff and pulled herself up a little taller. “It’s about his soul.” She willed herself to disarm the man. “You know how we are about those things,” she said and he knew she meant [MASK]. The sheriff laughed.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Josh	He led them to the new car. Inside it were pots and wooden boxes full of tomato plants. Red tomatoes were growing plump on vines. They pressed against the car windows like they were in a crowded hothouse. “The temperature is perfect for Beefsteak tomatoes,” said [MASK].
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Benoit	The day of [MASK]’s funeral, the earth was frozen. A black hearse drove up, followed by limousines and other slow, dark cars. Behind the windows, the Indian and mixed-blood passengers sat straight in the back seats.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Grace	“Make your bed every morning,” they used to say, ‘‘and you’ll never want for a husband.” [MASK] was a woman who took such sayings to heart and she still wanted a husband.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Sara	He had been struggling, in vain, to put things together, to make of events a pattern he might understand. He joined together a burned shoe with [MASK]’s living foot. He’d matched up the mattress in the oak tree with his own sleeping body.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Moses	[MASK] covered his face with his aging hands, and thought how his grandson had a man’s good heart and a man’s strong words and he was proud at the same time that he was miserable under the weight of their history.
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Belle	It’s not me doing it. It’s not even the leasers. It’s what is legal.” [MASK] sat down. “Why is it that so many crimes are backed up by your laws?” The man returned to his desk. He met her eyes.
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Palmer	I overheard him tell someone he was going to rob you tonight.” “Rob me?” [MASK] grew anxious. “Yeah, I’m sorry to say it. He’s been a good one. One of my best, up to now.”
<name>John</name>	John	Stace	It was an eerie and strange register to the southern Indians but they were glad he was with them. [MASK] went back to his hotel room, in order to think, but that same night, a note was slipped under his door.
<name>Redshirt</name>	Redshirt	Horse	It was Redshirt. He was sure of it. His heart speeded up. He stood up and listened hard, closing his eyes, cupping his ears with his hands. It was him. It was Redshirt. [MASK] listened.
<name>honestly</name>	honestly	Belle	“I heard. It doesn’t seem right to me, either.” “What do you make of it?” “I don’t know. It troubles me, [MASK]. The whole thing troubles me.”
<name>her</name>	her	Nola	He handed [MASK] five more roses. He looked into her eyes and smiled. The sky darkened and they didn’t see the clouds begin to move quickly across it and gather into themselves. Rain began to pelt down and very suddenly, it seemed, the creekbed came to life.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Honey	He lit the cigarette awkwardly, with useless thumbs. “[MASK], you don’t think I’d lie, do you now?” and the Indian men were silenced by her toughness, by what was hidden beneath her angelic white face and the words her soft voice spoke.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Horse	Her eyes, also, were gold-colored, and her hair. But she was still a child and she was impatient that morning as she walked tried to hide the cigar. [MASK] pretended not to notice the cloud of smoke one of them fanned with his hat.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Nola	“I thought you said the girl was with her.” “She was.” [MASK] held her breath. She heard nothing else, for a sudden gust of wind whistled across the water and rattled the cattails. The girls were afraid to look.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Belle	“Another thing,” [MASK] said. “My grandson. He came back from the Haskell school and he was sick. He stole a horse. He cursed his father.” She let her words trail off. She was struggling with tears.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Nola	They would say she died of natural causes, she knew it, and she had gone too far now and when she felt the baby kick her from inside, she thought she heard it saying, “Help me. Help me.” [MASK] tossed the bird away.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Belle	He stared into the fire. “I wondered if you had any visions or nightmares the last few nights.” He made a little pile of the coals. “Should I have?” [MASK] was quiet for a while, then she spoke softly.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Will	But [MASK] saw only his father’s cool silence and as he looked at the older man’s professional veneer, he felt his childhood drop away. He saw an older version of his own face, hardened a bit, turned sharp and tired. He didn’t trust him.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Lettie	She put the beautiful hat on her black hair right away and the wedding guests admired it, but later, after drinking champagne, [MASK] started crying about the bird, “Where do you think they got these feathers?”
<name>Morgana</name>	Morgana	Moses	She sat at the mirror. Out of habit, she brushed her long silver hair while she thought. In the dark, sparks flew and snapped through the air around her. She was sure something was afoot. She put the brush down. [MASK] seemed to sleep.
<name>Abel</name>	Abel	Horse	[MASK] had been back up in the bluffs since the wedding. Unlike the priest, who was excited by the burning bush, he knew the words the land spoke were words of breaking, moans of pain. He didn’t mistake them for the voice of creation.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Will	Watch where you’re going,” [MASK] said. He pulled the collar of his coat up around his ears as if to protect himself from the drunk and leering faces of his friends. It seemed like forever before the car drove up the road toward his house.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Nola	Suddenly every other child in the room was grave and silent; they knew what it meant that [MASK] was assigned a guardian by the court. Their hearts went out to her. They were afraid. Several of them looked out the window to see what the Hill men were doing.
<name>Odysseus</name>	Odysseus	Stink	[MASK] clapped himself on the head about the ears, and shook his head back and forth, but it was to no avail. He could hear nothing, not even so much as his own heartbeat. The world of the dead was a silent place.
<name>He</name>	He	Moses	“And if it wasn’t?” she said, but before he could answer, she was on her feet. She took a pistol from a cabinet. It was a small handgun, one she used to frighten coyotes away from her nervous chickens. She loaded it. [MASK] said nothing.
<name>Tea Cake</name>	Tea Cake	Moses	While they sang, [MASK] held the drum and beat out the slow rhythm of a mourning song. The young pallbearers in the back did not know the song, so they hung their legs over the end of the wagon, listened, and watched the road rush by beneath their scuffed boots.
<name>Old Man</name>	Old Man	Horse	“You say we’ve still got a week or so before it rains?” “Maybe two,” [MASK] confirmed. “The way my bad leg hurts, I’d say it’s going to rain today.” The dust blew up around them.
<name>an Indian</name>	an Indian	Stink	“I was lucky,” she said, “not to have married [MASK]. I would have been the next victim in line.” Some of the listeners knew, however, this was not true; white women marrying Indian men could not receive their headlights, not being the dominant marriage partner.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Horse	It was moving. It bulged and struggled. He opened a comer of it to see what was moving inside the bag when a bat flew out. [MASK] was so startled that he fell backward against the stone wall and scraped his shoulder.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Palmer	You keep a gun?” [MASK] swallowed and nodded. “Two. I keep one back there for when I’m in the office. One out here. But I’ve never used them.” “You probably won’t have to use them tonight either.”
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Resurrected	[MASK], he examined himself. His hands were raw, the thick nails broken. He was dressed like a ghost, all right, in a winding sheet. His joints ached. But for a man who had just been in death’s handhold, he was in fairly decent shape.
<name>Kiki</name>	Kiki	Benoit	The girl looked baleful and gray. Except for her hairline, she barely resembled the girl she’d been just the day before. Even her face had changed shape, it seemed to them. [MASK] stared at her.
<name>He</name>	He	Levee	But even more than that, he doubted the bureau. “It’s a stupid idea.” [MASK] tried to change the subject. “Have you found your black horse?” “It’s still running wild.” But he wasn’t concerned about the horse.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Nola	All she could think about was the baby. But when she reached [MASK], for some reason, the girl could not rise up and she cried out in pain, “My foot! It’s stuck. ’ ’ And it was. It was wedged between stones.
<name>Lauren</name>	Lauren	Nola	“[MASK]?” He led her up the stairs. He undressed her. She was stiff. She lifted an arm as he pulled at the sleeve. He looked at her round belly. The veins showed through the dark, stretched skin. She was beautiful and full.
<name>She</name>	She	Nola	He wasn’t concerned. [MASK] searched his face for signs that he was lying, but he was nonchalant. “I’m going to buy you a parrot,” he said. He smiled happily at her, jiggled his money in his pocket, and walked away.
<name>Abilene</name>	Abilene	Belle	Or the screams of one cow huried into another, leaving them looking like an interlocked puzzle down on the ground where they fell. And there were the squawks of [MASK]’s germanium crystal radio down in the potato cellar where the rest of the family waited out the storm.
<name>Black Elk</name>	Black Elk	Stace	He was asking for the people, the Indian people. He was asking for the eagle people as well, those who had been taken out of the sky. Their absence had left the people downhearted. As a boy, [MASK] knew the constellations of the older people.
<name>Brett</name>	Brett	Belle	It’s only a surface wound. ” He looked at the bloodstained tear on her dress. “It must have hit her from the side,” he said. But [MASK]’s face was still without color and he was afraid the shock had been too much for her.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Stace	He opened the window again and looked out. Then he sank into the chair and sat up, listening, and sometime during that noisy night, still sitting, he slept. The next morning, [MASK] was in a dark mood as he left for the courthouse.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Stink	[MASK] was already wiser, he thought, since now he knew that spirits wander freely among the mortals on earth. Now he understood why his dogs used to baric at what he’d thought was nothing and why they chased after shadows no living person ever saw.
<name>Mr. Bingley</name>	Mr. Bingley	Stace	“You’re in there, then? I thought for a minute you’d abandoned your body.” “I was just a few miles away.” [MASK] smoothed down his shirt and sat down at his desk.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Lettie	But she avoided his eyes. Upstairs, [MASK] looked at herself in the mirror. Her eyes were beautiful, even puffy. She powdered her nose and went downstairs, trying not to show the despair she felt. The sheriff held a bouquet of yellow roses.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Stace	And [MASK] knew, also, that he didn’t dare step out from the trees. Horses like that one had what was called “splitting.” That is, they would see a man move away from a shadow and think a tree had doubled itself and split.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Belle	[MASK] was outside the house. All the windows on the south side of the house had been broken out by the midnight blast and she was gauging the damage, picking up the few splinters of glass that had fallen outward.
<name>Rowena</name>	Rowena	Belle	And only a moment later, he heard her walking up the Crow Hill road toward his tepee. The fire smoked. He stirred it. [MASK] sat down beside him and was quiet a moment. ‘ ‘Are you all right?” She studied his face.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Valentino	Some of them even compared notes with each other, and suddenly after years of marriage, they complained to their husbands, “Why don’t you do it like this? [MASK] does,” until the men were persuaded to go see exactly what it was the women wanted them to do.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Horse	“If you look close, you can see it. It’s not so good.” [MASK] filled the bullet hole with a small stone from the other side. At that moment, the sheriff yelled into the mouth of the cave. “Your last chance!”
<name>She</name>	She	Ruth	Quickly he took the pistol from the drawer. There was no time to lose. His hands fumbled. He was certain [MASK] was in danger. He didn’t bother to put on his boots. He heard her again, down the road this time.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the context)	someone (There is no proper name given in the context)	Hale	The prosecution handed him the confession. He looked at it. “Yes, this is it. They told me they were after [MASK] and if I would sign this, they would leave me alone. They said they’d even drop the charges on the stolen car.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Josh	‘ ‘I’ve had enough.” [MASK] followed him. When they reached the car, least partly to blame, what with the young men staggering around and the women putting their hands in the men’s pockets.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Forrest	“But if they benefitted from your death wouldn’t they be suspects anyway?” “That’s just it, you see. I signed it only yesterday. But the paper was dated over a year ago. ” [MASK] fell silent. He needed to clear his head.
<name>she</name>	she	Belle	He thought [MASK] must feel that way when she knew something was wrong. It was real, something he could almost touch with his hand, something cold and cruel. He slept lightly while the rest of the household was peaceful, relieved to be out of danger.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Lettie	She stood up and put a kettle of water on the woodstove. It was hot in the kitchen. [MASK] shook her head, no. She had sorrow in her eyes. “How many times does that make that he’s been here?”
<name>Odysseus</name>	Odysseus	Stink	what he’d thought was nothing and why they chased after shadows no living person ever saw. They had vision keen enough to see the dead. The dogs, who couldn’t tell the difference between ghosts and mortals, wagged their tails and followed [MASK] home.
<name>him</name>	him	Forrest	More and more, he felt fear in the air, its presence as distinct as a storm of dust. And the noise of the train, its whistles and porters walking back and forth, asking to see tickets, made [MASK] anxious.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Stace	Besides, there were several heavy lengths of rope draped across her back. But his leg ached from the cold weather, and finally, when it was late morning, he had no choice but to have [MASK] help him up into the freshly soaped saddle.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Belle	He turned it over in his mind, then took his hat off and, without an argument, he sat back down and rubbed the grit off his face. [MASK] put her hand over his. She fingered one of the scars that crossed his knuckles.
<name>they</name>	they	Stace	“Come on, I ’ll cany your bag to the room, ’ ’ and moved away from the desk. The clerk watched them walk down the hallway, suspicious, to make sure that [MASK] left the room in a short amount of time.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Stace	The fresh smell of the coming rain did not enter the room. It was cramped and had a tired-looking bed, a worn chair, and smelled of mildew. “We should eat,” [MASK] said, as he set down the cloth bag on the bed.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Hale	You’re the one that paid me to marry him. To marry a goddamned corpse!” [MASK] sat down. “Calm down,” he said. He was tired from fighting the fire. He brushed back his hair. He tried to think.
<name>the boy</name>	the boy	Ruth	She turned to the others. “He’s like a grandson to me.” She sounded proud. The boy’s face was red. His shoes barely touched down. Except for [MASK], the other old women followed suit and began to cheer and yell.
<name>she</name>	she	Nola	“What do you think you’re doing?” she said between her teeth when they were out in the hallway, but [MASK] went limp as a rag doll and sat on the floor, allowing the nurse only to drag her, by her lifeless arms, down to the office.
<name>she</name>	she	Belle	“It’s fine, really,” and in her dark dress she walked away. She turned once and looked back at the black casket rattling across the earth. When [MASK] reached her house, the watchers were standing in the first evening light.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Louise	He said good-bye to [MASK] and hobbled in his shining black army boots in the direction of the unpainted shack where he lived by himself. He was relieved to get away from the smell of whiskey and smoke and the stories of true misery that were told over drinks.
<name>Winnie</name>	Winnie	Rena	[MASK] watched the small lives in the water, the water walkers, minnows, and the tadpoles. “Don’t you ever wish you’d wake up one day like them, and be able to live in two worlds?”
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Josh	“No, I didn’t hear that. ’ ’ [MASK] looked at her eyes. She was glancing about the room. “They’d all been gone over a year and given up for dead. Some white man stole them.” She sat up straight.
<name>Mr. Shiftlet</name>	Mr. Shiftlet	Will	She’d been up keeping her monkey warm in her arms and pacing the floor. When she saw the lights, she put the monkey in its cage and ran downstairs. She opened the door for [MASK]. He stood on the other side, fatigued and wrinkled.
