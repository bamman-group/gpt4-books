<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Karen	Is he all right? Those two men hit him so hard.” [MASK] answered, “They didn’t hurt him much. A few cuts and bruises. He was never even in the hospital, just had a few stitches in the emergency room and went home.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Marshall	[MASK] was instructed to place a precisely worded advertisement in the Times personal column if he accepted the proposal. He had two days in which to decide. Without hesitation, he called the classified section of the paper and placed the required item.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Rochon	She hesitated a moment, then laughed too, a salacious warmth creeping into the pit of her stomach. “[MASK], you’re a fucking bastard. You’re right, I can’t resist. Take advantage of me.” “Listen, the scene is ready to groove right now.
<name>She</name>	She	Karen	That was a damned stupid thing to say. All I really wanted to know was who they are, where they come from. I’m interested in your friends.” “Well, why didn’t you ask?” [MASK] said, hardly pausing before replying.
<name>Rocco</name>	Rocco	Pierre	The girls backed in the same direction, their weapons leveled at the bank’s customers and employees, spread-eagled on the floor. At the door, [MASK] fired his hand gun at a pedestrian who moved in too close, then shepherded the trio of women into the small automobile.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Heidi	He slipped on a pair of pants, and walked into the bedroom where [MASK] lay stretched in deep slumber. He kissed her softly on the cheek, and she came grudgingly awake. “Hi, sweet little one.” There was genuine empathy in his voice.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	He was nursing a Bloody [MASK]. She ordered a Screwdriver from the waitress, then spoke. “Listen, daddy, I’m sure glad to get you alone for a minute. You’re getting as hard to catch up to as greased lightning.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Allen	She knew that she was not really beautiful, though. She was too tall, and her nose too long. Did [MASK] really love her, as he said, or had he come on board for the family fortune? It could be true, she thought to herself.
<name>Jennifer</name>	Jennifer	Heidi	[MASK] stood above his favorite chair which sat nestled in a corner of the room, big and soft. She had a grim, determined look on her face, and was splashing lighter fluid onto the expanding flames emanating from the chair’s cushioned surface.
<name>she</name>	she	Lisa	He wanted at last to give in to the strange feelings of helplessness and need that [MASK] aroused in him. But he couldn’t show anyone how he felt, couldn’t admit the need to anyone. Suppose she laughed at him. What then?
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Pierre	“Well,” [MASK]’s gaze remained fixed on the road, “I think that the chicks are getting tired of the routine. We’re working them too hard, too many tricks. They haven’t started griping yet,” he lied, “but they will.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	John	You’re too flat to be a girl, and too pretty to be a boy.” She smiled smugly at her own remarks. [MASK]’s responding smile was quite acrimonious as he dipped ice and gin into the shaker. “Y ou’re jealous, you tinsel bitch.
<name>Ratso</name>	Ratso	Heidi	Let’s shake ’em up with the big one, squeeze that rich bastard so hard that he spits out money like a dog with the runs spits out crap!” [MASK]’s eyes lit up with excitement, “Have you already figured one out?
<name>Leia</name>	Leia	Lorraine	Somehow, the mere separation alleviated much of the cautious rebel’s concern, but he was still not comfortable. [MASK] sensed the vague fear that was seeping through her husband’s being, but she was powerless to do anything about it.
<name>Grigory</name>	Grigory	Marshall	“Do you know where they are? Can you move in on them? Tell me the truth, damn it! I don’t want to have to go to your superiors.” “No, no!” [MASK] was mopping the sweat from his brow.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Pierre	You does your job, Ah does mine. Your company pleasures me and that ol’ gal. Don’ seem lak nobody’s doin’ any sufferin’ to me.” [MASK] looked into his eyes, saw the mischievous twinkle dancing there that had not been put out.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Rochon	She simply ignores the fact that she is getting paid for it.” “Okay,” [MASK] agreed. “I’ll buy that, but you’re a long way from establishing that she has a daddy thing about me.” “Bullshit!”
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	Suzanne	History is full of great women. “The bastards even twist that around, though,” [MASK] continued. “Even when the historical significance of an individual female is beyond doubt, her role as a decision-maker for her country is relegated to secondary importance to her sexuality.
<name>Janice</name>	Janice	Pierre	“Oh, [MASK], you know how that old bastard is,” she responded with a grimace. “I can’t stand his guts. He’s getting worse instead of better. The union is giving him a lot of crap at the shop, and he brings it all home.
<name>Baby</name>	Baby	Pierre	“[MASK], you know that I trust you. I don’t give a damn what happens with the other broads, as long as you stay straight with me. You’re my main squeeze, my driving wheel.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Pierre	Try as he might, [MASK] could not figure out why the fathers of rich bitches figured that their daughters should never get laid. It didn’t make the slightest bit of sense for an otherwise intelligent man to put his life on the line to protect the gossamer fragility of a chick’s honor.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Stanley	In fact, the work had devoured him, swallowed him whole, and carved the worried rows across his face. [MASK] frequently felt as if he was working out of a hole; his assignments were usually the toughest, his budget minimal, and his agents inexperienced.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Heidi	He grabbed a cushion from the nearby couch and began to pound the flames, which by now were consuming the draperies as well as the chair. Having extinguished the drapery fire, he was turning his attention to the chair when [MASK]’s small form leaped onto his back.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Marian	“Shit, woman, you know I can dig action. Let’s put it together and get into the wind. What’s going on?” She answered, “[MASK] is having a party later tonight, but that’s quite a while off.
<name>Yolanda</name>	Yolanda	Suzanne	Nobody with us is killing just for kicks.” “Don’t be so certain,” the nurse persisted. “Haven’t you noticed the change in [MASK] since all of this started? She gets totally manic whenever she gets her hands on a gun.
<name>Tina</name>	Tina	Suzanne	It was hard for him to believe, but he had seen stranger things. Hell, maybe [MASK] was simply a wilder bitch than he had thought. He shook himself away from the playful antics of the twins, dried off, and wandered over to the bar.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Norman	He smiled to himself as he lit one of [MASK]’s joints; it would be so nice to go back, for just a while, to relive the besfparts again. The stoned highs when the world smelled of roses, and LSD dreams could be had on almost any sugar cube.
<name>Stevie</name>	Stevie	Whipper	They have to be smarter than the average just to dig themselves out of the hole.” “Okay,” [MASK] spat back, “1 can dig that, but you’re out of your skull if you think that giving them a bunch of mismatched shoes and ragged clothes is going to help.
<name>Ishtar</name>	Ishtar	Karen	Finally, [MASK] came to rest, full across the length of his body, her pubic prominence lodged against his penis. She began to move her hips slowly and rhythmically, massaging his engorged organ beneath her pubis as she began to chant to the wind.
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Lisa	In fact, however, he was merely careful in diligently guarding the family assets. He kept his priorities in order, and regarded his daughter [MASK] as promising, for a girl. Her self-imposed exile from the family he felt to be a temporary, petulant act of rebellion.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Rochon	Still sensing the mad spinning of the room, the attorney again slipped into unconsciousness, a strange, unknown noise tugging at his mind. A convulsive explosion rippled through [MASK]’s body, sending his muscles into twitching fibrillations as the core of his being experienced the earthquake climax.
<name>John</name>	John	Pierre	They sped through the light traffic to the modest home that she shared with her twin sister, and [MASK] waited in the car while she changed. She came out in a long, one-piece silk dress that knotted behind her neck, and swept to the ground.
<name>Doc</name>	Doc	Pierre	“She had to get into something that she knew you wouldn’t dig. She still has to do things that shock her new daddy.” “All right,” [MASK] answered testily, “so the bitch is enraptured by the mystique of armed political resistance.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Michelle	You’ve got an answer for every problem, and a problem for every answer. You had best stay on that couch, though. If I come back up here and find you on top of [MASK], I’ll ream your ass with a hot poker.”
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Tillman	[MASK] was vigorously drinking with both hands. It was almost as if he anticipated that some cataclysmic disaster was about to befall the entire civilized world, and that it would result in the immediate and total destruction of all alcohol. He simply intended to drink his share before tragedy fell.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Suzanne	She liked all types of lewd material, but now she was perusing her favorite type, the kinky stuff. Pictures of half-naked women, in high heels and black silk stockings, carrying bull whips, or chains, gave [MASK] goose bumps all over, and caused her small nipples to come tautly erect.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Pierre	A smile tugged at the corner of [MASK]’s lips as he thought, “The son-of-a-bitch sure got his wires crossed and his ass short-circuited this time.” The smile disappeared in an instant. “What if he dies?
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Judy	The Snack Shack operated as the nerve center of [MASK]’s clique of friends, a condensed amalgamation of the conservative college’s few so-called radicals. Most were part-time students, supporting themselves with a spreckled variety of mundane tasks.
<name>Jackson</name>	Jackson	Stanton	Don’t you want to make someone pay for their deaths?” A knot formed in [MASK]’s jaw muscles as he struggled to contain his anger. “Yea, they meant something to me, some more than others, but they’re dead and gone now.
<name>Debbie</name>	Debbie	Marian	She was stage center, a star, but still in the shadow of her dimpled sister. She followed [MASK] into nursing training, but began to explore the budding Delta City counter-culture on her own. She learned to play bass guitar, and took on a spot in an all-girl rock band.
<name>Candy</name>	Candy	Suzanne	“[MASK], you know for a rich bitch, you’re one hell of a wild heathen in bed.” “Why do you think those tricks drop a fat hundred onto you every time they want to crawl in with me?
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Norman	Authorities have recovered none of the stolen funds, and remain baffled as to the whereabouts of the elusive revolutionary army.” They all laughed. “All right! All right!” [MASK] shouted. “The bastards know who we are. We’re somebody!
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Karen	There were two women and a man in the speeding vessel, and one of the women was leaning toward them from the back of the boat, yelling something that he could not hear. Then, he and [MASK] were in the bigger boat with the other three.
<name>Anais</name>	Anais	Penny	“Gradually, my coordination returned, but occasionally my body would be swept away by waves of tremulousness and weakness. When we made love, [MASK] became every woman that I had ever wanted consciously or unconsciously. It was the closest thing to a total wish-fulfillment that I have ever experienced.”
<name>Sebastian</name>	Sebastian	Pierre	This time, [MASK] swiftly pinned her small frame to the floor and held her there. He looked up to see several other occupants of the mansion standing in the doorway, mesmerized as he had been by the strange scene before them. “Stop him!”
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Heidi	He searched intently for the familiar thatch of [MASK]’s pale yellow hair. He cursed again when he saw her. Her hair was cut to within an inch of her scalp, and she had grown fat. She knew that he couldn’t stand short hair, or fat women.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Rochon	Finally, she bolted up the stairs, ruttish lust overtaking her body and propelling her in wanton haste toward her inevitable Lesbian defloration. [MASK] poured himself another drink, splashed it down, then settled into a lounge chair for a peaceful nap in the sun.
<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Suzanne	You didn’t even need us.” [MASK] laughed, still riding the adrenalin high that had been coursing through her head from the moment that she had jammed the gun into the colonel’s mouth. “It felt so goddamned good, blowing that uptight sucker away!
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Whipper	“You’re a damned pervert!” [MASK]’s voice cracked with the passion of his curses. “I heard that you’re a queer who likes to let cops screw you in the ass. You call yourself a revolutionary, you’re nothing but a fucking pervert!”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lorraine	You blew the whistle on us, led them to us like a Judas goat. Well, it’s over, but you won’t get away with it.” His hand tightened on the gun butt. [MASK]’s piercing scream shattered the still silence an instant before the gun went off.
<name>Modesty</name>	Modesty	Suzanne	“[MASK], for once, why not try looking at things realistically. You’re so fucking hungup on being a heroine that you don’t seem to realize that you’re about to become dead.” “Bullshit!”
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Karen	He ignored the fluid, and continued his probing with the small blade, feeling for the structure that [MASK] had told him about. Finally, it was accomplished. He took out the blade, then reached back into the vagina, where a small amount of bright red blood had now accumulated.
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Lord	If these wings should fail me, [MASK], won’t you meet me With not a prayer. Well, well, well ... So I can die easy. Well, well, well. Well, well, well So I can die easy.
<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Karen	He sipped his coffee. “Yea, yea. I know.” [MASK] appeared resigned to her fate. Screw me, screw my friends. It’s contagious, like measles, or chicken pox, or mumps.” “Sure,” he laughed.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Jacqueline	After the bloody fight, [MASK] could hardly recall what had happened. It had all been so sudden, her father and brothers crashing in upon them in the barn, the flashing knives, the screams of pain, and the blood. There had been so much blood.
<name>Arctor</name>	Arctor	Pierre	“It’s going to be all right, honey. Relax. Get your head together. [MASK] is no parasite, he’s our friend. I had to beg him to come over and help us. We need him more than he needs us.”
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	Heidi	She looked around as she paused, her eyes resting momentarily on [MASK]’s upturned, delicate face. “It is my suggestion that during the initial revolutionary strikes, it will be to our advantage to hire any necessary assistants on a one-time, contract basis.
<name>Remy</name>	Remy	Pierre	The old man was on a horrible bender, cursing violently, saliva dripping over his ragged beard, and waving that huge hunting knife in his right hand. After [MASK] sped away from his drunken wrath, the old man knocked over a kerosene lamp, and the resultant holocaust lit up the swamp for miles.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Karen	He swung his head in an exaggerated arc, surveying the guests carefully. [MASK] protested, “Listen, daddy, tonight all strange stuff is off-limits. All we need is for you to end up in the sack with some Assistant District Attorney’s old lady.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Pierre	“[MASK], can you hear me? I love you.” Her words were drowned out by a sudden cry of agonized pain that escaped from him as his right knee was ripped open by a powerful bullet, and the blood streamed freely from it.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Pierre	Children go unwashed and uncared for as their parents sink into alcoholism or drug addiction. They’re in a futile situation, trapped, we’ll give them a way out.” [MASK] raised himself from the small circle near the campfire and walked down to the river’s edge.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Lorraine	* * * Chapter XII [MASK] entered the room with her customary tray of food, sat it on the bedside table, then returned to lock the door. Remaining inside the room, she spoke to the thin, disheveled girl lying on the bed.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Suzanne	One day you’re going to be sitting right in that corner, with a joint in your mouth and your thumb up your ass, and a cop is gonna bust through that door and wipe you out faster than you can spit.” [MASK] snarled, “You’re paranoid, that’s the problem.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Lisa	She was killed over at your daddy’s house, by that investigator guy. We buried her.” “Why did he kill her?” [MASK] asked, a pleading look the first display of emotion to cross her face in weeks. “Did she shoot at him first?
<name>I'm</name>	I'm	Pm	“Why do you think those tricks drop a fat hundred onto you every time they want to crawl in with me? Because [MASK] cute? Ha! Even what I lay onto them, though, isn’t half of what you get.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Pierre	The trigger resisted only slightly, and he was surprised when the steel revolver cracked in his hand, whipping itself slightly upward. All the while, he had kept his eyes frozen on the furry animal, like [MASK] had shown him previously.
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Frank	The rending of their illusion was a hard and bitter pill to swallow. The entire aerospace industry had fallen into a tailspin, their savings dwindled rapidly, and [MASK] spent much time on the road, searching. His decompensation began in earnest after he had searched vainly for three months.
<name>Tina</name>	Tina	Lisa	The girls emerged from the two autos, locked the car doors, and walked toward the motel elevator. [MASK] ran a quick check on her weapon again, a tight knot forming in her stomach also. Finishing, she clicked on the safety, then laid the weapon down and nervously lit a cigarette.
<name>Dean</name>	Dean	Pierre	“Nothing to it,” [MASK] searched through his coat pocket for a joint, found one, and lit up. “Why don’t you tiptoe down those stairs and haul his ashes. I’ll cool it here on the couch.
<name>Rome</name>	Rome	Caesar	It presupposes that the complex is so powerful, so clever, so patient, and so damned pervasive that it will eventually dominate all societies and bend them to its will. “History itself argues against this thesis repeatedly. Remember the legions of [MASK]? What happened to them?
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Phil	The mutual, climactic, ultimate exultation of their passionate embrace. Later, reentering the world of consciousness, [MASK] lifted his head from the pool of green vomitus that it had fallen into. His hair was streaked and matted down onto the right side of his face by the viscous material.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Judy	Finally, [MASK] broke in. “You idealists can feed on the revolution, as for me, I’m going to start a fire and cook some chow.” She stepped out into the cool mountain air and began to gather kindling wood for the afternoon campfire.
<name>Rooster</name>	Rooster	Stanton	All of it is in plain, unmarked envelopes, with no return address. A friend of mine is a clerk in the place, and he thinks that the guy is federal fuzz. I believe him.” “Hell, [MASK], you’re one paranoid stud.
<name>Jody</name>	Jody	Rochon	The musky scent of honeysuckle wafted through the thick, humid air past their perch in the grape arbor. As [MASK] drank, the old man spoke, “Son, you know there ain’t no call for you to fret about me an’ that oP black gal.”
<name>her</name>	her	Heidi	It would slow down her labor too much, and we would be here forever. Give her some more booze. That ought to help without knocking her out.” He brought in the fifth of whiskey, gave [MASK] a slug, and then took a deep gulp himself.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Pierre	Suddenly, like a golden, streaking bird of prey, [MASK]’s lithe body sliced through the air to cut evenly into the water. A burst of pride thrilled through her as he surfaced, with strong, even strokes propelling him swiftly through the rippling surface of the pool.
<name>Raoul</name>	Raoul	Rochon	He preferred not to think about it. Preferred to bury the surfacing guilt beneath a layer of denial. The whole bit had been a decided bummer. For [MASK], there too often seemed to be some sort of bummer pay-off at the end of each trip.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Karen	Where the hell have you been hiding?” “Aw, come off it, [MASK],” he was trying to sound casual, offhand. “Don’t lean on me. You know how it can get sometimes. I’ve been into some tough times.”
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Suzanne	Sinking his slender body into the foaming suds of the bath, he found himself almost cursing. He simply could not believe how much trouble [MASK] could be. Sometimes, he felt like nothing more than an escort for hire.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Lisa	The small sports car slipped up the steep asphalt driveway, and [MASK] parked near the swimming pool. As usual, her father was not at home. She talked at length with her mother, shared tea with her, then went swimming with the boys in the family pool.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Norman	[MASK] took another sip of his beer. “The people running this country are nothing but a white collar Mafia. The government has deteriorated into a joke, with the actual management decisions being made behind the scenes by a bunch of bureaucrats and technicians.”
<name>Sharon</name>	Sharon	Suzanne	How do you expect to manage that?” “You’ll be the first to know,” he smiled. “[MASK] gave me the first key when she talked about laying heat right onto the mothers instead of sneaking around, being a thief in the night.
<name>Harlan</name>	Harlan	Davis	[MASK]’ reply was argumentative. “That line would be funny if it wasn’t so tragic. It’s typical of the type of thinking that let the damned technicians at the controls in the first place. Sure, government is complex, but so is life.
<name>Lenina</name>	Lenina	Suzanne	In response to the hoarse voice blasting at her, [MASK] shoved the nose of her weapon through the window glass, shattering it, and fired several bursts at the mob of assembled officers. She let out a curse. “Fascist pig bastards! Hired killers!”
<name>Rusty</name>	Rusty	Suzanne	“Some friend you’re turning out to be, let a girl close her eyes for a few minutes around you, and you’ve got her old man by the balls. Too much.” “Listen, man,” [MASK]’s eyes narrowed.
<name>She</name>	She	Karen	There had been something behind his eyes, something that she had felt burning into her, something that had imprinted itself into the back of her mind. Now, though, he had changed. [MASK], too, had changed.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Pierre	“Sometimes, I feel like your recruiting agent. You’ve balled every friend that I’ve had for the past two years, including my sister. What’s wrong with you? Do you have a hormone problem?” [MASK] laughed, “Hormone problem!
<name>Rodolfo</name>	Rodolfo	Norman	Ideas dropping from his lips faster than his mind could manage to coordinate them, resulting in bursts of prolonged, incomprehensible sentences. [MASK] considered himself a true patriot. Firmly committed to violent revolution, he explained his position as the inevitable reaction to a government that had betrayed its sacred trust.
<name>Johnston</name>	Johnston	Whipper	[MASK] himself did not survive the first split second as he was simply blown apart. No trace of his body was found in the smouldering aftermath of the fiery blast, and he was listed as missing on official government files.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Norman	She turned to face the front end of the van again, her next sentence trailing off, “When they come after us, we’ll all know about it.” An eerie silence froze the moment. Then [MASK] spoke, “Okay, you’re both right.
<name>She</name>	She	Suzanne	When can I see you?” “Anytime, I told you. Anytime.” There was a pause in the conversation as he awaited her response. [MASK] finally spoke. “Okay. Okay. Listen, I’m coming over to your place right now.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Pierre	The officers stepped away from the door, and back into the front room. “If you want me to, I’ll awaken them both,” [MASK] volunteered cautiously, again looking from one to the other of the two uniformed men.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Stanley	[MASK] reached into the packed right hand pocket of his jacket and extracted an antacid tablet. He ground the chalky substance between his molars, and washed it down with a glass of water. This one might take him out of the field, no question about it.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Pierre	It’s time for the big hit.” [MASK] shook his head, “Do you think that we ought to move again so soon? Shouldn’t we give the papers, and the people, some time to chew on this hit that we’ve just completed?”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Pierre	Once inside the bank, the three girls moved swiftly to far corners of the lobby. When [MASK] jerked his automatic rifle from beneath the thick jacket, the girls did likewise, leveling the barrels of the deadly weapons at the customers inside the building.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Rochon	This is the police.” The officer stopped short when the door flung open onto [MASK]’s towel-draped, and apparently astonished personage. “I’m sorry,” he volunteered. “I was in the tub, and couldn’t hear you.”
<name>Timothy</name>	Timothy	John	“[MASK],” his mother’s shrill voice bit into his reverie. “Are you coming down to breakfast or not!” “Yes, mother!” Then, at a whisper, “yes mother, yes mother. Mustn’t be late for din-din.
<name>Rearden</name>	Rearden	Pierre	It was like contemplating the explosive power of a rocket engine: the irresistible force of the ignited element was undeniable, but also undeniable was the fact that such force could not be sustained. [MASK] would eventually flame out, leaving him as what?
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Karen	I simply will not have it.” Her tone was firm and final. * * * [MASK] lay quietly on her back, allowing the smoke to drift lazily from her nostrils into the still air of the room.
<name>her</name>	her	Suzanne	Finally, he overcame his jealousy about her being with other men when it became obvious that he would lose [MASK] altogether if he didn’t comply. It was only a matter of a few weeks, however, before he came to enjoy his role and the considerable income generated by it.
