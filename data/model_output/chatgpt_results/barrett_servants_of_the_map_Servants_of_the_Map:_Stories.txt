<name>him</name>	him	Bianca	The forest, his mother, the starving soldiers; the bison, so huge and wild, just barely rescued from oblivion. That part ended happily. The rest, which he would never tell [MASK], did not: the German army had overrun the forest in a matter of weeks.
<name>Janine</name>	Janine	Lauren	That night, or perhaps the next day, he said, “It was [MASK], you know. I mean the reason we couldn’t have children of our own—it was never me.” “I’m sorry,” she said.
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Elizabeth	“I know no such thing,” she said. “When you first came here I thought you might be in real trouble. Why else would you—” "I had bronchitis the winter before our first visit,” [MASK] said.
<name>Victor</name>	Victor	Samuel	“You took me into your home and brought me up as your son.” “I acted toward you as toward a son,” [MASK] said. “But when I took you from the wreck of your parents’ house and remade you in my own image, I acted out of pride.
<name>Artemis</name>	Artemis	James	Still my heart lags behind. Though even if my heart wants to be broken, if part of me wants to be brought to my knees, it is not to be my choice. For [MASK] I will never be more than one of the three virgins he passes daily.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Dima	[MASK]. At first he speaks to her simply to be polite, and to conceal his surprise that she’d address him without being introduced. Then he notices, in her capable hands, a sheaf of reeds someone else might not consider handsome, but which she praises for the symmetry of their softly drooping heads.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Bianca	Her father had been a forester, and she’d grown up watching the bison grazing on buttercups under the oaks.” [MASK] interrupted him—he seemed old again, he was wandering. And crossing and uncrossing his legs like a little boy who had to pee.
<name>Dr. Sloper</name>	Dr. Sloper	Clara	“The mountain air seems clearly helpful,” [MASK] said nervously. Around the table everyone was suddenly embarrassed. “Our Elizabeth has suffered from bronchitis, and still has a bit of a cough. Summers here seem to help her.
<name>Granny Weatherwax</name>	Granny Weatherwax	Nora	[MASK], with her caches of herbs and bitter powders, her screens covered with drying leaves and flower heads, would have seen the possibilities in his metal shapes. The life she’d led, each of the places she’d called home sending unexpected shoots toward the next, had made her open to almost anything.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Gillian	From those, still brave and cheerful, he works his way into the later ones. A line about [MASK]’s colic, and how it lingered; a line about the bugs in the rhubarb: unsaid, all the difficulties that must have surrounded each event.
<name>Audrey</name>	Audrey	Elizabeth	You have no idea how annoying it is to always be under my uncle’s thumb.” “You were faking?” “I suppose.” “Then why did you keep coming back?” [MASK] rolled her eyes.
<name>Louise</name>	Louise	Rose	Again?” “Why not?” Around the left lobe of the kidney came [MASK], a platter of chicken in her hand. She seemed simultaneously to smile at him and glare at her sister, who was caught with the paper cup still at her lips.
<name>Dad</name>	Dad	Stuart	A book older than he was, but still very useful—and how like [MASK], he thought fondly, to give him not the most up-to-date scientific volume but this early description of the area.
<name>Quinn</name>	Quinn	Stuart	“That’s one possibility,” [MASK] said. “Myself, I think they are long extinct—and I don’t mean by the agency of any biblical event.” Through a rolled cone of paper he poured a stream of ground bark.
<name>Kate</name>	Kate	Grace	The sun was setting, the children were cold. [MASK], who was watching her actions intently, was shivering. “We won’t be here long,” the boatman said cheerfully. “I’m sure the ice will break up soon.”
<name>her</name>	her	Clara	I trust your judgment completely. Good night; the wind is blowing hard. What a fine thing a house is. In my tent I think of you and the girls, snug inside the walls. After that, he does not write to [MASK] for a while.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Peter	A flurry of introductions and almost simultaneous farewells, an awkward hug, everything left hanging and [MASK] suddenly distant, clearly embarrassed by what he’d revealed. He rushed away, his stride still that of a young man, bouncy in running shoes. He called her, though.
<name>her children</name>	her children	Michael	When the bounty money ran out she went to the new hospital up the road, looking for work that might also bring her news of her husband. She couldn’t work as a ward nurse unless she lived in, and she couldn’t live in because of [MASK].
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Caleb	After that [MASK] turned away from whoever tried to help him. His pupils’ well-meaning mothers—the widows especially—sometimes asked why he didn’t remarry; it wasn’t right for a man to be alone.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Clara	Compactly built, she is several inches shorter than him but points out that their legs are the same length; his extra height is in his torso. Swiftly he pushes away a memory of his wedding night with long-waisted [MASK].
<name>She</name>	She	Clara	“He’s an excellent shot. Does your husband have any interest in the mountain plants here?” [MASK] shrugged. ”1 expect he wouldn’t consider these real mountains. Not after where he’s been.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Elizabeth	“They’ll probably be back next summer,” she finally said. What else had she missed? “If [MASK]’s health doesn’t improve.” He turned to look at her. “Really?” The film of plaster on his face was beginning to crack as it dried.
<name>Cherry</name>	Cherry	Rose	The sun was so bright, his eyes were so tired, the jumble of buildings and traffic so confusing. The step up to the van’s back seat was too high for him, but neither girl noticed him struggling. The small one, [MASK], had laughed at his question.
<name>He</name>	He	Peter	Was it wrong? “I was in love with you then,” she said. “Did you know?” [MASK] bent and kissed her leg. They were apart that summer more than they would have liked.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Rose	And although they were rooms she’d given up, rooms that from now on would belong to [MASK] and not her, this moment of remembering that they existed comforted her like balm. She said, “I had a grandfather who did wonderful tricks.
<name>your colleague's name</name>	your colleague's name	Caleb	In the cliff walls, she reports, the relics are arranged by age, youngest at the top and oldest at the bottom, neat as a filing cabinet: the clearest possible demonstration of the ideas you and [MASK] shared.
<name>Marisol</name>	Marisol	Grace	“If you want.” Moving her hands, she said, “We were at a neighbor’s wedding. Me, my parents, my brothers, and [MASK]. She was two and a half, and I was fifteen.”
<name>Hal Incandenza</name>	Hal Incandenza	Martin	And a stream of heat carrying the magnetic waves—this part he’s hypothesized for himself—might increase the benign effect. On its way to the roof this chimney runs between the outside wall of [MASK]’s room and the inside wall of his porch.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Martin	Some of the boarders will gulp down three eggs, swearing they taste like raw oysters. [MASK] might have swallowed two without any fuss and then gone back to sleep, but instead he’d raised a glass, taken an egg partway between his lips, and let it slip back, his face contorting horribly.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Michael	A terrible crack, again and again. He whipped at the form on the table as if he couldn’t see her, white puffs rising into her nose and throat. She covered her mouth with her handkerchief and cried, “[MASK]!” Whip, whip, whip.
<name>Kim</name>	Kim	Max	The sepoys—” “Did you know them?” [MASK] had asked. “I knew both of them, I had tried to talk them out of their plan. They were . . . The officers lashed those two men over the muzzles of the cannons.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Constance	“Oh, please,” she said. “You don’t have to pretend to be interested. Go talk to the other famous people. [MASK] collects them, they’re everywhere.” She huffed off—furious, he saw. At him?
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Nora	“We didn’t have anything to eat, and I had a fever. A piece of my nose rotted off.” “How old were you then?” [MASK] asked. “Twenty-one. Almost twenty-two.”
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Clara	He isn’t thinking about either of them. This is his story, his life unfolding. The women will tell the tale of these months another way. 7 My dearest, my beloved [MASK]— April 21, 1864 Forgive me for not writing in so long.
<name>Abigail</name>	Abigail	Nora	[MASK] let him talk, she let all of them talk. She brought them herbal decoctions she’d made at the inn, and teas and salves and a syrup of hore-hound compounded with hyssop and licorice root.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Grace	“I think he has hopes of me and [MASK] joining their group.” “Would you really think of joining them?” “Would you?” For a moment they gazed at each other curiously, and then she smiled.
<name>Mrs. Linde</name>	Mrs. Linde	Miriam	When we die, they leave for good. These are our souls. “I want more for her,” [MASK] continued. “More than I can give her— look how her face lights up around her friends. Look how their hands fly.
<name>Ma Joad</name>	Ma Joad	Rose	Then there was a gentle knock at the screen door, and when [MASK] looked up from her task she saw, against a background of hollyhocks and hills, a tall man letting himself into their house as if he belonged there.
<name>someone</name> (There is no clear indication of who the person is, so "someone" is a reasonable guess.)	someone (There is no clear indication of who the person is, so "someone" is a reasonable guess.)	Michael	He was glad to have her and [MASK] there, he said. More glad than he could say. Right now, though, he was very busy. Forty guests filled the Northview Inn, spread between the two bottom floors of the main building and the low wing angled back from the lake.
<name>John Keats</name>	John Keats	Nora	The invalids were delighted to see him, particularly as he charged no fees: he was still too sick himself, he said, to actually practice. He was simply getting acquainted with his fellow sufferers. With [MASK]’s permission he also joined her friends for their occasional gatherings, answering questions and demonstrating his stethoscope.
<name>Uncle Atli</name>	Uncle Atli	Francis	In the corner she’d taken for her own she spread the ginseng and wild ginger she gathered, the fresh soft elder leaves with their flowers and the roots of yellow dock. When the war came, no one expected [MASK], a middle-aged man with a brand-new son, to volunteer.
<name>Isaac</name>	Isaac	Samuel	In his old life, people had talked about the weather. “How did it get here?” “There is only one true and simple explanation,” [MASK] said gravely. “But despite this men have had many notions. I keep track of them in these pages.”
<name>anyone</name>	anyone	Clara	Household chores and worries over money, a crying child, a smoking stove; relatives coming and going, all needing things, and both of them stretched so thin; none of it [MASK]’s fault, it is only life.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Nora	If a boarder’s cough worsened, if his fever rose or he spat blood, then the women sent to the Northview Inn for [MASK], the only one among them to have experience as a nurse. There wasn’t a doctor, then, within sixty miles.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Rose	They were dainty and delicate-footed, completely at home here and yet out of place beyond the confines of this small haven. Still she couldn’t figure out either how or when they crossed the bustling road between the park and [MASK]’s apartment, to browse on the lettuce and peas.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Bessie	“I didn’t show you this to scare you—don’t you think you’d already have it, if you were going to get it?” “Eight years,” [MASK] said. “Since I took in the first one. Everyone told me it wasn’t contagious.”
<name>he</name>	he	Ned	A small part of it seemed to have melted, as if the flesh were wax. Ten people rushed past her and swarmed him, crying that they must have a bed, they must have a meal, they had traveled for days; to each of them [MASK] spoke kindly.
<name>I</name>	I	Rose	“He died when I was five or so, before I could ask him anything. Most of what I know about him my mother told me, and she died when [MASK] and I were still girls. I don’t know much history, I guess.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Leo	“My parents were apple farmers, and friends with your grandparents. They thought my interest in insects was silly. But your father and I used to play together, and [MASK] always paid attention to us. He must have noticed me lugging around the bottles and matchboxes I stuffed with bugs.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Caleb	In the space between the two low buildings [MASK], already wet, was so thoroughly drenched that even the roots of his hair felt refreshed. Behind him, as he ducked through the door, the rain fell and fell for the third day in a row.
<name>Conrad</name>	Conrad	Caleb	“There are different theories regarding the origin of fossils,” [MASK] said, trying to locate the voice. “Many of these my father has explained to you. He believes what you just suggested: that they’re relics of creatures destroyed in the Flood.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Bianca	Drowsily he said, “I have not felt so good in years.” Actually this long narrow seat was more comfortable than the vast bed in his hotel. The jacket [MASK] had folded into a pillow beneath his head smelled of her; the whole van was scented with her presence.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Bianca	“It used to be the gardener’s quarters,” [MASK] said, gesturing vaguely in the direction of the apartment. ’’Over there, near that big stone house.” He ducked his head to see over her shoulder. Whatever house she’d pointed out had vanished.
<name>Miss Stacy</name>	Miss Stacy	Miriam	Forget the snow, forget the cold. Or so said [MASK], who was their teacher. If the animals pranced about in it, why shouldn’t they? Every week they made this journey, in every kind of weather.
<name>back</name>	back	Clara	When they part, he knows he will become simply a story she tells to the next stranger she welcomes into her life. And still he does not write [MASK]. Other letters from her have arrived, which he hasn’t answered: six months, what is he thinking?
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Clara	But for now all he can do is triangulate the first few points. . . . I have so much to tell you, [MASK]. And no more time today; what will you think, after all these months, when you receive such a brief letter?
<name>Yorkshire</name>	Yorkshire	Ned	Then they’d headed north again, leaving [MASK] behind. “His wife’s?” she asked. “His mother’s,” he said. He dropped the boot into her hand. “It got so damp over the winter, I thought I should set it outside to dry.”
<name>She</name>	She	Bianca	He blinked his eyes; it hadn’t been there, and then it was. [MASK] inhaled sharply. “Oh,” she whispered. “We made it just in time.” He blinked again: four deer, then eleven, then seventeen.
<name>Miss Ada Thrift</name>	Miss Ada Thrift	Michael	She didn’t think about them again until she opened the workshop door one November day, after the first snow had fallen, and found [MASK] standing there in a white cloud so dense it seemed to be snowing inside.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Rose	“[MASK]?” he said. The tone in his voice was pure wonder; they hadn’t seen each other in almost twenty years. He was much changed, and yet still himself: the mustache grizzled, the black hair half gray; thicker at the waist and shoulders yet still with the same eyes.
<name>his wife</name>	his wife	Margaret	He might have replied that the Academy, and his remaining family, required his full attention. Or he might have told the widows the truth: that once, not long after he and [MASK] were married, he’d complimented her on a pot of yellow blossoms near the front door.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Grace	When the cat pressed a paw to the window, trying to touch a passing crow, [MASK] pinched the air near her upper lip with two fingers, drawing them in an eloquent movement through the place where her whiskers would be, if she were a cat.
<name>Grandpa</name>	Grandpa	Elizabeth	That noise at the back door is him, kicking the snow from his boots. One more thump and here he is. He clasps [MASK]’s hand and touches his massive cheek to hers. “I just wanted to say hello,” she says.
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	K2	We have thunderstorms almost every day, they are always terrifying; the one that shook us the afternoon I saw [MASK] brought hail, and lightning so close that sparks leapt about the rocks at my feet and my hair bristled and crackled.
<name>young woman</name>	young woman	Miriam	“I would be honored,” I said. The %uins S A YOUNG WOMAN, she had written letters only infrequently. But now, in aid of her sister’s work, [MASK] found herself writing letters almost every day.
<name>She</name>	She	Bianca	He added two more bubbles to his airy construction. There was a theory behind all this, [MASK] knew. An idea that this growing structure of soap film and wire exemplified; at this rarefied gathering, only she was incapable of grasping what he was trying to explain.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Peter	That afternoon they set the trap: the mouse, trussed with a bit of fishing line, laid carefully in the thin grass of a shady bit of ground below the vineyard. On the limb of a shrub overhanging the site [MASK] tied a red cloth.
<name>she</name>	she	Peter	She held the beetle as it darkened and aged before her eyes. Egg, grub, pupa, adult, egg. Holometabolous development, the most advanced form of insect metamorphosis. When [MASK] wasn’t looking, she tossed her specimen into a shrub.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Bianca	Somehow the possibility of actual bodily harm had not occurred to him as he lay calmly regarding the stars from the muddy field. “The ankle’s not broken,” a young doctor finally said. “But it’s badly sprained.” “So he’s all right?” [MASK] kept saying.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Gillian	“Not her,” he said furiously. With a piece of wire he began flicking, fiercely yet precisely, at the the webs of down clinging to the bases of the feathers. “[MASK]. She never answers me. I don’t even know if she gets my letters.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Stuart	If it’s frozen at all, it will only be on the surface. And no one else will be there—a great advantage.” “I really can’t travel now,” [MASK] said. “I just can’t. But why don’t you go?”
<name>Mr. Stevens</name>	Mr. Stevens	Caleb	“You do very well with them,” [MASK] said. He looked down at his wet boots, imagining himself back at the Academy a few weeks from now, pushing the younger boys through their readers and ignoring their yawns. “I’m a schoolmaster myself.”
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Grace	You should see [MASK]’s face and hands: very brown, dotted with freckles. Against these her hair, powdered with rock dust, is so white that strangers sometimes take us for twins. They ask what we are doing, where we have come from.
<name>he</name>	he	Elizabeth	While a black and white cat with pearl-gray eyes twines among everyone’s legs, he adds, “Won’t you stay for supper?” “I can’t,” [MASK] says. “It’s three-thirty, I need to hurry back.”
<name>Miss Emily</name>	Miss Emily	Caleb	They worked together, they made a life. In the dormitory they built for the boarders, they sometimes found the children, late at night, huddled around an illegal candle with their hands flying urgently. Despite the risk of fire, [MASK] could never bear to snuff the flame.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Harriet	When I woke there were people all around us. [MASK] and her beau were gone, someone had covered their bodies with a blanket. I was unharmed except for one long burn.” She rolled back her sleeve and exposed to the cold air a forked scar branded between elbow and wrist.
<name>Brian</name>	Brian	Ned	In [MASK]’s dream it never rained; the fish never stopped biting and the mosquitoes never bit. They never quarreled. They moved from lake to stream with the greatest of ease, never slogging through mud at the carries, never dropping the boat or the pack-baskets.
<name>Maya</name>	Maya	Elizabeth	Each time he arrives at her bungalow he brings gifts: little carved boxes and bangles and lengths of cloth; for her daughter, who is nearly [MASK]’s age, toy elephants and camels. Otherwise he tries to ignore the little girl.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Elizabeth	This evening, before I began to write to you, I opened one intended for [MASK]’s birthday. How lovely to be reminded of that happy time when you leaned on my arm, plump and happy as we walked in the garden and waited for her birth.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Stuart	“An historical overview of all the old theories, followed by his own account.” Was this a betrayal? “I’m interested in the relationship of fossils to geology,” [MASK] said. “My uncle lets me borrow from his library.
<name>Conway</name>	Conway	Vine	This although I have reminded him repeatedly that ours is a good East Anglian family, even if we do have Huguenot ancestors, and that we say the name “[MASK]. ” All the men who’ve explored these mountains—what a secret, isolated world this is!
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Bianca	Quickly [MASK] traversed the yard and the patio, slipped through the glass doors and across the kitchen, and ran upstairs to the third and smallest bathroom. The door closed behind her with expensive precision: a Mercedes door, a jewel-box door.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Krzysztof	So competitive. I hate all this hustling for money and priority and equipment. Actually,” she said, “I hate these people. A lot of them. I really do.” “We’re not very inspiring in groups,” [MASK] said.
<name>George</name>	George	Stuart	But still [MASK] looked at him wearily. Our natures don’t change, he’d said: but he hadn’t meant that, he wasn’t himself. Not so many years ago, they’d argued happily about the possibilities of a world still developing, still in progress.
<name>it</name>	it	Martin	This part has never changed either. As she rounds a corner, wishing that [MASK] might leave them some other way, the Northview Inn comes into sight. It too has hardly changed. Warped dock, sagging gutters, siding in need of paint.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Nora	[MASK] kept her eyes fixed on the gutters. “No one knows. I have asked everyone, everywhere.” Were those pig tripes lying there, outside the butcher shop? “I’ve even had people put advertisements in the newspapers for me.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Nora	No well man would leave you, he wrote gallantly. [MASK] was almost forty-five by then, while he was twenty-seven. But if he’s still alive, he may be sick in his mind. You’ve seen what happens to us.
<name>Mr. Stevens</name>	Mr. Stevens	Michael	“In excellent shape,” [MASK] says, stepping back to look over at his brood. “As you see.” While a black and white cat with pearl-gray eyes twines among everyone’s legs, he adds, “Won’t you stay for supper?”
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Ned	“But I hate to ask for her help unless I really need to. She gets so involved, and then she wears herself out.” “She likes to feel useful,” [MASK] says. “When’s the last time you wrote her?”
<name>Atlantis</name>	Atlantis	Samuel	The water shimmering under the first pale sun, the clouds first black then gray and then finally white in an open and radiant sky. Under the water, [MASK] said dreamily, lay lost cities, drowned mountains, entire forests uprooted from their tenuous hold on land to float horizontally.
<name>Natasha</name>	Natasha	Bianca	Then there was the vodka on his breath, and [MASK]’s storm of hysterical tears; for some minutes the possibility of calling the police was raised. X-rays, blood tests, embarrassing questions: “Are you his girlfriend?” one nurse said.
<name>Helen</name>	Helen	Joseph	At first he bit whoever touched him.” She waved at [MASK] and returned his elaborate bow. “I’ve been able to act as an interpreter for him,” she continued. “The things he’s told me— people have such remarkable ideas about the deaf.
<name>Antonia</name>	Antonia	Nora	“It’s a kind of courage,” he said. “The way she waits, and takes care of his life for him. I admire that.” The mail, [MASK] saw, bound their friendship together.
<name>he</name>	he	Clara	How do they make a life for themselves, in stich difficult circumstances? Could [MASK] understand this? He will break it to her gently, he thinks. A hint, at first; a few more suggestions in letters over the coming months; in September he’ll raise the subject.
<name>They</name>	They	Michael	They lay down when it was dry. They hardly spoke, they had no words for what was going on between them. Their parents had told them nothing. [MASK] had heard things from the guides, but hadn’t known whether to believe them.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Elizabeth	Next to my heart, in an oilskin pouch, I keep the lock of [MASK]’s hair and your last unopened letter to me, with your solemn instruction on the envelope: To be Opened if You Know You Will Not Return to Me.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Rose	This whole area—I hate this area, it’s one giant suburb. This is the only bit of real woods left for miles. But something kept eating everything [MASK] planted in her garden, and when I started jogging here I found out what it was.
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	Rose	Years later, as [MASK] looks up from her microscope, she’ll see something like that door and will hear the sentence, always the same, which confines her mother’s death: Walking along a lakeshore road, she was struck by a speeding tourist and killed instantly.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	James	The aunts have no idea of this, but it is from the likes of [MASK] that they have wished to preserve me. From that giving in, that going under, they would preserve me as they’ve preserved themselves.
<name>Mrs. Jones</name>	Mrs. Jones	Miriam	So clean, so neat; empty of people at first. “They’re in church,” [MASK] said. “They’ll be finished any minute.” And suddenly there were people everywhere, pouring from a door and moving purposefully in their neat plain clothes.
