<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Lonnie	Many men had gathered into small groups, talking. Occasionally someone would speak to him; warm cheery voices, vaguely familiar some of them, others unknown cyphers. “Hey [MASK], taken any shit from anybody lately?” “How’s the old pussy hound?”
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Gentry	“Watery rice and pigweed it is.” “Fifteen minutes till the old zero hour,” said [MASK]. “Are you guys going to show up at the gate?” “What would you do?”
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Lonnie	“I could walk for a while, then I could crawl around for a while, but now I can’t move, I think I’ve had it. I need some help. I need some water.” “Hell, man, I haven’t got any water,” said [MASK].
<name>Carver</name>	Carver	Opdahl	“I’m gonna go trade that damn watch.” He made his way back down the aisle feeling the cold increase as he went along. He kept a sharp lookout for [MASK], and when he thought he saw him, moved to the opposite side of the hold.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Lonnie	[MASK] reached down and shook him but he didn’t move, just settled down snug and comfortable, looking just like he used to right after he let one rip at the mess table and then sat there smirking, trying to control a snicker.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Lonnie	Merry Christmas.” His voice echoed back from the side of the building but no one said anything. “Merry Christmas,” [MASK] shouted again at the top of his voice. Then somebody out of the darkness answered. “Shut up, you goddamn creep!”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Lonnie	The wound on his head which had caused the blood flow in his eyes was nothing, a small cut in the scalp just above the hairline. [MASK] couldn’t believe it, he was still alive and didn’t even seem to be hurt very much, except maybe for that funny round wound in his thigh.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Lonnie	“A guy can never tell when he might need a piece of broken beer bottle.” Slowly [MASK] extended his hand, holding the broken glass, until he found the sack. Carefully he sawed away, slowly and methodically until eventually a hole was opened and the sugar came out streaming over his fingers.
<name>Case</name>	Case	Corso	“Sure you do [MASK], thanks.” He took another deep drag, felt a momentary burst of clarity. The square above became too bright, his hand holding the cigarette too sharply etched as he gazed down at it—somehow separate from him, floating, moving on its own.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Ross	“You didn’t tell me you had a whole cigarette. Where in the hell did you get it?” “Have a drag and shut up,” replied [MASK]. “What the hell do you care? Anyway I’ve got lots of things you don’t know anything about.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Mason	He was deader than a door nail. He saw something else, a string around [MASK]’s neck, like something was attached, maybe a bag with something in it, or a ring. Shit, he didn’t need it any more.
<name>Rusty</name>	Rusty	Lonnie	“My last thought when I’m dying of starvation will be about pussy.” Everyone laughed and [MASK] felt good, almost happy as he made his way down to the bottom floor. There was security, a feeling of belonging and strength in being with all these guys, whatever happened.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Ross	“When he divided up that mess kit of rice he packed down one end, harder than hell, and he fluffed up the other end. Guess where we got our rice from?” [MASK] didn’t say anything for a moment.
<name>Reilly</name>	Reilly	Gentry	but he was smiling now. “I predict that he’ll beat our brains out with the butt of his rifle, and right now I for one feel that you deserve it.” The line had started to move when [MASK] came out of the building.
<name>Dobbs</name>	Dobbs	Lonnie	“I sure wish we had some water to wash out these mess kits. They haven’t been washed now for weeks.” “How in the hell can you talk about water for mess kits when we’re starving to death?” asked [MASK].
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Lonnie	“You couldn’t screw a limp soda cracker,” the Major said mildly, smiling a little. “Get your ass down the gangplank, you’re holding up the line.” “Fuck you,” said [MASK].
<name>Callahan</name>	Callahan	Lonnie	It was like crawling into a den, reeking of animals, of their processes. “Smells like a goddamn boar’s nest back here,” [MASK] observed. “How many of you bastards are under here?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bessel	“I got hit by one of those hatchboards on the other ship, right in the back,” answered [MASK]. “I could walk for a while, then I could crawl around for a while, but now I can’t move, I think I’ve had it.
<name>Klemperer</name>	Klemperer	Gentry	The enclosure was still fairly empty, men lay in small groups on the grass, next to the fence or between the courts. Many of them were already asleep. “Have a seat, Gentlemen,” [MASK] smiled up at them as they approached.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Lonnie	You’re just a goddamned baby.” “Shit on you,” said [MASK]. But he didn’t say any more. He heard the sound of the door closing and suddenly it was pitch black in the box car.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Ross	“We started out with sixteen hundred and nineteen men, how many do you think are left now?” “Maybe six hundred,” said [MASK], thoughtfully, “not more.” “What’s killing them? What are they all dying from?
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Ross	Shit, I’ll bet he was putting on about having that fit. I’ll bet he was putting on that whole deal, I’ll bet there wasn’t a fucking thing wrong with him.” “I never thought there was,” said [MASK].
<name>Juan</name>	Juan	Lonnie	Boy, I’ll never forget it. There you were with the cassava sticking out from under your arms and him kicking your butt with you trying to keep from dropping your load. It was funnier than hell.” “What a sense of humor,” grinned [MASK].
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Corso	He started crawling toward the bulkhead without looking back. [MASK] waited a few moments, and then followed him. Just then, one of the men from the morning burial detail stuck his head down beneath the bay and shouted. “Got anybody under there?
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Rutledge	When he awoke he could see [MASK] staring dazedly at the faint light coming down into the hold from the hatchway. A large number of men lay under the opening, their bodies faintly outlined against the lighted area, some were moving but others remained fixed in strange postures.
<name>She</name>	She	Melody	He knelt beside the bed, kissed each of her trembling breasts, sucked each one just a little. Then with a deft motion, the covers were laid back and [MASK] felt his hot fingers seek the warmth and moisture of her sex. Greater joy in anticipation than in realization?
<name>Alvarez</name>	Alvarez	Ross	Shit nobody’s got anything to puke. Not many farts in one bean. Gotta get on that food detail.” The creaks faded. The next thing he knew [MASK] was shaking him, whispering, “We’re going to eat again in a little bit.
<name>Trurl</name>	Trurl	Gentry	“As a matter of fact, it does come from the encyclopedia of life,” continued [MASK], undisturbed. “In the fulfillment of our young friends you find a knowledge more profound than any dissertation, an art more subtle than any masterpiece.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Lonnie	We don’t have a bit of water.” “Well you had some when the Father died, this morning. I saw a canteen almost full this morning;. What did you do with that?” “We drank it up,” said [MASK].
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Lonnie	[MASK] waited his turn falling in at the rear of the line as the boat emptied. He glanced again at the guard who still leaned into the V of the prow but decided against asking him for a cigarette. Mean looking son-of-a-bitch.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Lonnie	They hunched down close to the ground waiting for the sound of an explosion which strangely never came. “What in the hell was that?” gasped [MASK]. “I never heard anything so goddamn weird in my life and what the hell happened to it?”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Lonnie	You want to have a couple of hundred of these dumb bastards trampling on you? We’re better off here, at least it will be quick, if it comes.” [MASK] cursed under his breath and began to unroll his blanket.
<name>Connell</name>	Connell	Lonnie	[MASK] didn’t move from his place against the bulkhead. He sat listening to the clicking of mess gear, the rasping of bare feet on the steel rungs of the ladder. The sun moved across the hold and left him alone in the shadows.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Bessel	I’ll give you part of it. I’ll give you a third of what you get.” “Okay, okay. Sure, I’ll do it. Sounds good to me. What ya got?” [MASK] pulled his canteen out of its holder and reached inside.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Lonnie	They wanted to kill you!” Now his voice rose, and [MASK] suddenly forgot his hunger and even the wounded men were quiet, “And I wanted to let them kill you!” He paused again, his form barely distinguishable in the almost total dark.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Lonnie	They sat facing one another in small irregular circles; small self-contained social units achieving aloofness and aloneness in the multitude, their backs turned against the rest of the world. [MASK] suddenly felt left out of things, as if he didn’t belong anywhere.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Lonnie	Just then, one of the men from the morning burial detail stuck his head down beneath the bay and shouted. “Got anybody under there? Anybody dead under there?” “Yeah, there’s one under here,” replied [MASK].
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Lonnie	Three buckets, used as latrines, were overflowing. The excrement covered the floor and intermingled with the bodies of the men. At the periphery where the tiers began, [MASK] could see individuals like himself, staring hopefully toward the square of light far above.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Lonnie	“Fuck ’em all, fuck ’em all, the long and the short and the tall, there’ll be no devotion this side of the ocean, fuck ’em all, my friends, fuck ’em all,” [MASK] screamed at the top of his voice.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Lonnie	There was a bright moon now but the guard stood in the tree’s shadow. Maybe he was the same one. The son-of-a-bitch. The small light from the privy let [MASK] make out the figure, but he couldn’t see the face.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Lonnie	Once when one of the planes released its bombs directly above them, a small propeller which served as a fusing mechanism unscrewed itself and struck one of the men near [MASK] on the head. He could see a trickle of blood running down the man’s forehead but he didn’t seem to be hurt very much.
<name>Flint</name>	Flint	Ross	“Quit shouting,” said [MASK], “and bring me up some.” He was sitting up now, still partially covered with the grass mat, but there was an eagerness in his movements, an intense note in his voice.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Lonnie	Even now, at this very moment your glance must take us in, your love encircle us.” The Father paused and for a moment [MASK] thought the prayer had ended, but his voice came again, still clear and steady but edged with deep concern.
<name>He</name>	He	Ross	We can trade what we find for cigarettes and water, maybe even some medicine.” He looked down at his leg which was beginning to swell again. “If I don’t get some medicine this damn leg is going to drop off.” [MASK] didn’t say anything.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Lonnie	They lay on half the mat and curled the other half over them. Just before they went to sleep, they took a sip of water out of one of the canteens and shared a cigarette. “Hell, this isn’t half bad,” said [MASK].
<name>Eleanor</name>	Eleanor	Lonnie	“But do light up one of your candles, [MASK]. Let it burn at both ends and even though it may not last the night, it will warm us for a little while. Don’t forget that it is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Lonnie	“The dirty Jap son-of-a-bitch, he’ll get his one of these days.” [MASK] looked up to see the platform coming down with a bunch of bare feet and skinny legs dangling over the edge, swing back and forth right over them.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Lonnie	As far as they could see, ships silent and unmoving, a tableau of jumbled iron set at odd angles, cluttered the water. [MASK] felt pride then and his voice choked. “The yellow bastards are getting it. Look at that! Look at that!
<name>Chiyo</name>	Chiyo	Lonnie	My father was a vice consul in the Japanese consulate. I was only twelve years old when we left.” Then he looked more closely at [MASK]. “You look like you’re starving,” his look took in the entire boat.
<name>Blackhouse</name>	Blackhouse	Ross	“And the Japs give him worker’s rations for that. Some job, just banging that gong on the hour and half hour!” “A bit demanding for a Lieutenant Colonel, I’ll admit,” said [MASK].
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Lonnie	Finally the skinny kid had it and was about to hand it over. “Hell, take a couple of drags,” said [MASK] expansively. The skinny kid did, and his eyes grew distant as his lungs stretched the shiny skin taut over his ribs.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Ross	He waited there in the semi-darkness until he felt [MASK] beside him. “They’re over there toward that corner, you just follow me.” Slowly they made their way along, stepping over people who grunted or cursed softly as they passed.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Ross	His legs looked like poles with knobby bulges where the joints hooked them together and his arms as if some giant leech had sucked all the blood away; they didn’t seem to belong to him. “What happened to us?” he asked weakly, looking at [MASK].
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ross	“I’ll bet a dollar those guys have blankets by now,” he announced to [MASK]. “I’m going to check.” But nothing had changed, he wasn’t even sure the sick had been fed. The dead lay in neat rows of silent immobility.
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Ross	“I’m almost warm. And you know what? My leg doesn’t even hurt much. How’re your fingers and your shoulder?” “I’d practically forgotten all about them,” answered [MASK], in the darkness. “They don’t hurt at all.”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Lonnie	The guard had watched him from a distance for almost the entire period and finally approached, sucking air through his teeth, and had told him to hurry up. [MASK] didn’t hurry. He had discovered an interesting phenomenon.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Lonnie	There was no sound except the panting, trampling, and crying of the men out there in the darkness. Suddenly the ship shuddered and groaned and it seemed to [MASK] that he could hear scraping sounds against the steel side.
<name>Francis</name>	Francis	Gentry	The Father’s face had become red and his voice shook when he spoke. “When you become personal in your references, I wish you would direct them at me and not at our Lord and Savior. Someday you may have to beg forgiveness for that statement.” [MASK] looked incredulous.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Lonnie	The ceiling was about four feet above them; [MASK] could hear people overhead and occasionally see movement through small cracks in the wood. In the center of the bay a square opening jutted up from the floor, covered by a wooden door, hasped and locked.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ross	He had managed to relax a little, his right shoulder and head resting against the side of the car, his back arched against those pressing in against him. “Are you in the corner?” he asked [MASK].
<name>They</name>	They	Voices	“Shit, I kicked the slats out of my cradle when I heard that one!” Somebody shouted up, “Enough of this Indian horseshit. Tell us the news.” [MASK] chanted in unison, “Give us the news. Give us the news.”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Lonnie	He started up rapidly and struck his head on one of the rafters which supported the roof of the bay. He fell back then, onto the steel deck and lay there for a few moments, stunned. [MASK] could see that he had crapped his pants.
<name>Francie</name>	Francie	Melody	‘Damn it, [MASK],’ her father used to say, ‘it’s hard enough for me to make a living for you and your mother and your two worthless brothers without you bringing in every stray dog and cat.’
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Lonnie	He passed the butt on to [MASK] whose hands were shaking. He could hardly wait to feel the warm smoke deep in his lungs, to feel the faint tremors of the nicotine bloom into a joy which made hunger and thirst unimportant for a moment.
<name>Tyrion</name>	Tyrion	Lonnie	“Why don’t you use your own prick? It’s about the right size.” “Shit on you,” said [MASK]. He kept working at the lock, but nothing happened. It remained solid and unrelenting in his grasp.
<name>Long</name>	Long	Lonnie	When you want some tea, you just holler, and I’ll bring it over. Okay?” “Yes, I’ll do that,” said the Captain. [MASK] crawled back to his place by the sugar sacks and ate the entire mess kit of rice.
<name>Antonio</name>	Antonio	Lonnie	“I agree with you, [MASK],” he finally said. “There is more truth in what you do than in what the rest of them, regardless of their education, regardless of how much time they spend in thinking—there is more truth in what you do, than in what they say.
<name>Alfred</name>	Alfred	Lonnie	During one of the attacks the ventilators had stopped working and the heat rose until it was unendurable. [MASK] pressed harder against the cool steel of the ship’s side and was glad, for a moment, that they were below the water line.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Gentry	Everyone kidded [MASK] about his high rank but privately it was agreed that he should have been in command of the Far Eastern Operations. He was such a grand bullshitter, always picking on people, but no one seemed to mind.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Gent	Why don’t you go out and tell the guys that I’ve got a story to tell, a good one, one they’ll remember.” “Hellfire, [MASK], I don’t know, it’s colder than hell out here, and there ain’t many guys left.
<name>John</name>	John	Lonnie	As they approached [MASK] could see a train half visible in the gloom under the trees; an engine exuding hisses of steam and a number of box cars, crummy little bastards, about half the size of American railroad cars.
<name>She</name>	She	Lonnie	Then suddenly the columns were quiet again punctuated by a few ripples of laughter which trickled away until the silence was complete, even more complete than it had been. [MASK] kept hoping somebody would say something so they could laugh, but nobody did.
<name>Rikki</name>	Rikki	Lonnie	Everybody did and everybody agreed that he was crazy. Didn’t he pick the cobra up by the tail? Who but a crazy man would do that? [MASK] could still see the pulling match which took place under that little bridge.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Lonnie	There was a general chorus from the listeners that ringed the little group. “Finish the story!” “Give him a cigarette,” somebody said. “Who’s got a cigarette?” Much to [MASK]’s astonishment, three cigarettes found their way from the outer edges.
<name>Harlan</name>	Harlan	Gentry	“Tell us one of your bullshit stories, [MASK]. We got enough trouble without all this bullshit about the beginning of the ending of things. That’s not really important anyway. Who really gives a shit about what happened twelve billion years ago or what will happen twenty billion years from now?
<name>George</name>	George	Lonnie	“But what did you think she could do over in that booth? Weren’t there other people in there?” “A few,” admitted [MASK]. “Hell, I didn’t know what she was going to do but I was past caring as long as it was something.
<name>John</name>	John	Lonnie	The Father stopped speaking again and looked around the small group for the second time. This time he was there with them, a small smile upon his face. “It was good for you to come and visit me at this time; [MASK], thank you for the water.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Lonnie	There was thunder in the patterns, sometimes short bursts and sometimes long reverberating roars which masked all other sounds. [MASK] saw a number of the moving light points leave gentle arcs of smoke indelible against the sky, to show for a moment that some boy whose mother waits had passed that way.
<name>Louie</name>	Louie	Lonnie	The propellers had stopped. [MASK] lay there in the dark, savoring the silence. Thinking, “I did make it. We’re here. We’re on land again. I made it!” He was reawakened in the early morning by the Japanese guards shouting.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Lonnie	[MASK] could still hear him, not so loud now. He was calling for his mother. His voice stopped moving around. Every now and then, once every couple of minutes, they would hear him out there in the dark, calling for his mother.
<name>Obi</name>	Obi	Lonnie	“Why would he give you one of his grass mats?” There was a long silence. “He doesn’t need it any more,” said [MASK]. “He’s dead. And you know what? He didn’t pray.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Bakayaro	Finally he began to speak, his face contorted with anger, his gestures short and jerky. “[MASK]! Son-of-a-bitch! Somebody jump off ship, some crazy bastard jump off ship, we shoot some crazy bastard who jump off ship!”
<name>He</name>	He	Lonnie	Something was missing, the wounded men wasn’t screaming anymore. Poor son-of-a-bitch. No more worries there. [MASK] must have dozed off because suddenly it was broad daylight and Japanese guards were shouting.
<name>He</name>	He	Lonnie	They were carried off the platform by a detail of prisoners. The platform made four trips, and the passengers were lined up in the sunshine next to the bulkhead. A number of them were already dead. [MASK] looked fearfully into the dead faces, but didn’t recognize anybody.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Ross	Wonder what he’s got in that ball sack? Wonder what he’s got left in that ball sack?” “You know, the poor bastard’s dying,” said [MASK] gently. “Do you think we should have given him some water?”
<name>Spofforth</name>	Spofforth	Barton	That goddamn R. T. [MASK]. He could see better now. They were in a space about fifteen by twenty feet going back to the metal side of the ship on one side and the steel bulkhead on the other.
<name>Louis</name>	Louis	Lonnie	He was looking up toward the Japanese corporal, who wasn’t leaning against the rail any more, he was coming down the stairs, screaming at the top of his voice, not at [MASK] but at the guard.
<name>Enrique</name>	Enrique	Lonnie	They went back to the wall but their places had been taken. Finally they lay down next to the small naked tree and slept for awhile. [MASK] woke stiff with cold just as the moon was beginning to rise over the east wall.
<name>Anders</name>	Anders	Ross	The convoy passed numerous barricades, usually at small bridges. They didn’t have to stop, soldiers waved them through and then looked intently at them as they passed. “Probably trying to figure out what kind of enemy they are going to face,” said [MASK].
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Ned	Since [MASK] had adequately demonstrated the art of withdrawal up until the untimely interference of the mother, the court declared that she was responsible for the birth of the child, and so—she was declared the legal father.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Melody	And even as the signs of her pregnancy receded, a strange fear grew in the eyes of all who knew her. A strange questioning fear which spread slowly through the library and out on the campus. Everyone was talking about [MASK], small clusters of conversations, in muted voices.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Lonnie	One of the steam winches on deck was giving off a trickle of water and [MASK] actually got his canteen partly filled before he was pushed away by others eager for their turn. There was such a commotion around the winches that the Japanese finally posted guards to keep order.
<name>Stoney</name>	Stoney	Lonnie	“You’re right, you can see spots. Some big explosion out there. An explosion maybe bigger than ten earths.” “You’re full of shit,” said [MASK]. “Couldn’t be that big.”
<name>John</name>	John	Gentry	“Yes, they do,” answered [MASK]. “Some of the wisest and most learned men of our day believe that.” “You mean that’s all there is, just this moving in and moving out, this moving out and moving in?
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Lonnie	[MASK] stood up and tried to look around but blood flowed into his eyes and he couldn’t see. “I’m dying now,” he thought. “I’m like that guy with his guts tore out, I probably got it in the head.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Ross	Shit, man,” his voice took on a pleading note, “don’t go back out there.” [MASK] didn’t say anything for a moment, he kept looking toward a knot of men who were floundering in the water.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Ross	“You know,” said [MASK], as they were taking turns at the cigarette, “I’ve just figured out what you ought to be, if you get back to the States all in one piece.”
<name>He</name>	He	Ross	“I’ll be okay,” he repeated in a small voice. [MASK] stood for a long moment, looking down, pursing his lips. Finally he turned and walked toward the end of the long line waiting in front of the first ladder, and became fused into the crowd there.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Lonnie	I can remember exactly what she said. She whispered in a real low voice, ‘Gee, you’ve got a nice big hot one there. Do you want me to take care of it?’ ” [MASK] paused for a long moment and then continued, his voice tense.
<name>Steinbeck</name>	Steinbeck	Lonnie	“Well give me the canteen of water, give me the water and the cigarettes and get the hell outa here.” [MASK] handed him the canteen from which he had already taken the swigs and one of the packs of cigarettes.
