<name>Lenore</name>	Lenore	Helen	Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying, And answer, echoes, answer, dying, dying, dying. [MASK], thy beauty is to me Like those Nicean barks of yore That gently, o’er a perfumed sea
<name>Eben</name>	Eben	John	When they had put the baby in the box, [MASK] carried it beside him on the seat of his wagon to the churchyard. It was just at sundown. The tide was out, and the gulls were screaming their raucous, petulant screams so unworthy of the still even beauty of their flight.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Ellen	[MASK] did her utmost to be reasonable and decent. She could use her hands, and she used them almost hourly in knitting and crocheting for some Portland agency which paid her for her work. She made numberless jackets and socks for babies, hoods and carriage robes.
<name>George</name>	George	John	Twon’t hurt and ’twon’t help, but it works off their energy, so it’s all to the good. What you aiming to do, [MASK], with this place here? Make a dairy farm out of it? You’ve got a better start at a herd than any man around.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mary	I can’t explain it all, but you’ll know by and by. There are beautiful things in life, [MASK]—I don’t want you to think there aren’t—but I’m afraid there are ugly things, too, and sometimes they’re all mixed up together.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Mary	She did not want [MASK] to come running out on the doorstep as she might well have done and spoil their conversation. When he came shyly down the driveway and looked at her inquiringly across the white pickets, she gave him the basket, giggling at his surprise as it suddenly hung heavy from his hand.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Mary	All our lessons tonight seem full of sad things. I felt like crying when we read about the Crusades. Do you think all those were justified with people dying of hunger and sickness?” “People seemed more willing to die for things then,” said [MASK].
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Mary	[MASK] found herself looking to him to manage things for them, and realized suddenly that women turned to men because of something seemingly stronger within them. She felt a new sense of safety as they journeyed northward through the now familiar towns and villages.
<name>Tristram</name>	Tristram	John	Deep within that pulsating kernel which was the life of [MASK]’s nature, there was as a kind of nucleus the certainty that the place of a man’s genesis has much to do with the continuity and stability not only of his ensuing days but of those of his children and his children’s children.
<name>Elspeth</name>	Elspeth	Mary	They knew the country intimately rather than in detail; few of them were of the stuff of which naturalists are made; but they belonged to it, looked like it, smelled of it. The smells in her schoolhouse, in fact, kept [MASK] amused when there was dearth of other entertainment.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	John	She was irritated alike by his stubbornness and by her own submission to him, a submission which was usually the result not of argument but of [MASK]’s rare and sudden kisses which left her so shaken and so eager for him that at the moment she was willing to consent to anything.
<name>India</name>	India	Mary	He still looked at her, realizing again with the same surprise she always engendered in him how like his gift she was herself. “That’s why it belongs to you,” he said. “You’re old, [MASK]. There’s nothing new about you.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mary	[MASK] did not, could not speak. The cabin was filled with portentous, acutely embarrassing knowledge suddenly loosed from her mother’s mind to hang over the table above their heads. She felt hot all over and as though she were going to cry.
<name>Abner</name>	Abner	Ellen	He filled the wood-boxes, dropping bark and dust over [MASK]’s clean kitchen floor. He tried to pile the wood in the shed, an avalanche of it fading and crushing one of his uncertain old feet. Raking up after the load, he left the fields untidy, bearded with hay.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	John	By night this will all be over, and in two days she’ll forget about it like all the rest.” “You better hurry along,” said [MASK], gathering up his reins. “She’s really in a bad way.”
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	John	There were still her lessons, but they were more quickly learned without [MASK] to fret at her elbow, and they became more interesting as she passed beyond her twelfth birthday and began to do her hair in one long, heavy braid.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Mary	“I’ve spent a fortune on these things,” he said, half in apology, half in explanation. “I haven’t much money, [MASK]. Probably I should have told you that long ago.” “It doesn’t matter. What’s money?
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ellen	I wrote and told him he was welcome to come and stay with us a while. He was good to me all those years, and I feel sorry for him.” “You—what?” cried [MASK], the hat-pin still in her mouth.
<name>Eveline</name>	Eveline	Mary	[MASK] paused in the dark passageway between dining room and kitchen to feel suddenly sorry for him, less for his father’s death and his own closed life perhaps than for this new one which awaited him and upon which she herself was about to enter.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	John	The question had caused such altercation during the summer and fall that it had been allowed to drop. In the hot August days [MASK] had actually feared that he might give way or at least insist as a compromise upon the house of his own birth.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Mary	She’s always trying to impress some boy or other, and she wants people to be always planning things for her. My mother says you never get anything that way. I can talk with you, [MASK]. You’re my best friend in all the world.
<name>Timothy</name>	Timothy	Ellis	[MASK] was omnipresent, now here, now there, trying to wield an axe, stumbling about in the ditch, proving a nuisance to everyone. He had never seen a great tree moved and throughout the fall had begged the deferring of his own removal to his new home until the miracle had been accomplished.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Ellen	Once in a rare moment of confidence when [MASK] had come home from a sewing-bee in the village full of this and that and more like herself as he had imagined her to be, he told her of his feeling, thinking she was in just the mood to see how he felt.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Ellen	Toward the end things did not go so well as they might. Even the doctor, now in his shirt sleeves rolled to the elbow, looked anxious. [MASK] s screams echoed and re-echoed through the house.
<name>Mrs. Wheeler</name>	Mrs. Wheeler	Ellen	1 never supposed I’d hear a thing like that from a daughter of mine!” [MASK] was hulling strawberries at the kitchen table. Their red stains brought out the whiteness of her capable hands. In a clean blue apron she was freshness and composure itself.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Mary	She wore a pair of new red shoes, the like of which [MASK] had never seen before. They buttoned high up her leg and were finished at the top by a turnover cuff of shining black leather adorned with litde black tassels.
<name>Ethan</name>	Ethan	John	He served the food himself with so little embarrassment that everyone was secretly startled. They sat around the table longer than usual and, after things were tidy again, drew their chairs about the Franklin stove in the sitting room where [MASK]’s wood crackled and glowed.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Ellen	By the late spring of 1918 they were moved and settled. [MASK] had her wheel-chair by the front windows of the sitting-room where she could see the garden and whatever passing there was along the road before the house.
<name>She</name>	She	Mary	Things were over the next day, the funeral in the church, the burial in the yard. It was a clear September day, [MASK] was to remember, with a high northwest wind which deepened the harbour water and bent the cemetery grass, tall again since its early cutting for Memorial Day.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Mary	After all, if one were going to live in a community, he said to [MASK], not without an embarrassment which she was quick to detect, one might as well enter at least partially into the life of it.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Ellen	As he said it, he was surprised at his own daring in venturing on such a subject to [MASK]. It must be, he said to himself in explanation, that he was emboldened by the way she seemed somehow to fit into his fireside, to look as though she belonged there.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	John	Once at home she was somehow different. It took [MASK] days even partially to forget her lack of eagerness over the house he had prepared for her. Details which he had planned so carefully she glanced at and forgot. His marigolds flamed unnoticed through October and November.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Mary	But when [MASK] turned from the table to the door and stood there for an instant quite unperceived, she noticed something in his face she had never seen in it before. He was not looking at the music at all.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ellen	He tried his utmost to shield [MASK] from the old man, taking him whenever he could into the barns and fields, listening patiently in the summer evenings to his reminiscences as they sat in the orchard out of earshot of the house. His memory was failing him.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	John	She wondered if there were enough of [MASK] lying securely somewhere within his son to come out in the lines of his face as he grew older, obscured though it now was by the solid, unimaginative lineaments of the Kimballs.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mary	We can’t do anything. We don’t even know who lives down there.” “It sounds so lonely. I’ll never forget it! I’ll hear it all my life, I know I shall. It makes me afraid, [MASK].
<name>Heyst</name>	Heyst	Jim	[MASK] was gracious to them all, insinuating himself into their reluctant favour even while their perennial suspicion remained. He explained its workings, the making of its wax records while they watched with fascination the needle which brought out all the newest songs, sending them through the room from its pasteboard horn.
<name>Prue</name>	Prue	Mary	[MASK]’s bewilderment and anguish, which she, blundering in her own embarrassment, had been unable to make easier, more simple, would recede to come back again now and then through the years in less piercing disguise. Nothing was ever final; nothing was ever lost.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	John	Even into one of four weeks, brought dotingly on board by [MASK] in an egg-basket, there had mysteriously been already injected the desire for companionship in kind, the need of green fields and rabbit-holes, of cats on back fences, and of hens to chase.
<name>Thaddeus</name>	Thaddeus	John	And why such fuss over one elm when eight others would be left to shade his house and garden? But [MASK] had dreamed for five winters of moving that tree, of saving for it the life it had striven so valiantly to keep.
<name>Valancy</name>	Valancy	Mary	I wonder who I’ll marry and how many children I’ll have. I hope the first one will be a girl, for I’ve set my heart on naming it for you.” It was early in January that the first cloud threatened to dim [MASK]’s complete happiness.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Ellen	[MASK], coming by herself a fortnight after the wedding and looking unusually attractive in a new suit and hat, somewhat archly proposed his participation in a musicale to be given in the fall. He was at once eager and cooperative.
<name>Sumac</name>	Sumac	Elder	Even the baked clay and sand bordering the road flowered in yarrow and may-weed and clover. [MASK] flaunted its scarlet cones among the thickets where thrushes scurried and sang. Summer, she learned, knew no bounds, no self-restraint.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Ellen	He’s all right but rather quiet, and I’m at my wits’ end to know what to talk to him about.” “Bring him in here if you like,” said [MASK]. “Maybe he’d like to see the rugs.”
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	John	She had thought during the months of [MASK]’s slow attendance that he was never coming to any point at all. He was an ambitious young man, she said to her neighbours, handsome, and steady as a clock.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	John	Things were so different at sea. Somehow you never thought of missing things at home.” “Wasn’t there ever anybody to talk to? I mean except your father and mother and [MASK]? I mean to tell things to?”
<name>He</name>	He	John	He felt aggrieved, too, that the baby had died before he had even made the rounds of the farm in his fathers arms.[MASK] had meant to take him once he was old enough to be out from under the constant domination of his mother.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Mary	And they keep on being saved all your life.” [MASK], washing her cooking dishes at the kitchen sink, was crying quiedy, glad that her mother was securely in the pantry, sure she would not come out to confront her tears.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Mary	You’re worn out, I know, and it’s probably not the time to say it, but it has to be said some time or other, and now’s the only time I know. You can cry, [MASK]. It’s good for you.
<name>Treebeard</name>	Treebeard	John	[MASK] knew that within the veins of its greater roots the sap lay concealed, and his plan was not to disturb them more than was necessary. Only the small fibres stretching through the ground ten feet and more from the trunk should be severed.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Jim	Anyway, it’s nicer, isn’t it, to have the things one cares for go to people who’ll appreciate their full value, who’ll know what they’ve meant in the past?” [MASK] made no comments upon her new venture.
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Jim	You think you would have taken care of her. Probably that’s true. I hope it is. You’re different from [MASK]. You haven’t in you the things that will make his life a hell for him. But I’d rather you had them all.
<name>Raffles</name>	Raffles	John	She had a face like a wide-open flower and round eyes which remained blue and candid instead of becoming sinister and yellow like those of most kittens. For once [MASK] had a friend at sea who asked of life nothing more than his companionship, and he himself throve mightily thereunder.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mary	Someone was sailing her who knew neither his ship nor her course. “Bad seamanship,” she said to [MASK] who was watching with her. “It would drive your father crazy.” Then things suddenly stopped within her, and she lay a bit lower in her pillows.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Ellen	His old tenderness came welling back upon him during the half-hour when he took the nurse’s place, by her bed, an almost desperate tenderness, only now it was not merely for [MASK] but for all who must suffer and fear.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	John	But she felt the appeal in him that she had from the first, and, in spite of [MASK]’s dislike, he was always welcome to her house. He was at his best with her, and she knew that, if he loved anyone, it was herself.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mary	[MASK] was gathering from the bushes by the doorway some boughs of syringa to arrange in her mother’s fireplace when she saw him coming up the hill. He had sent no word in response to her letter, and his appearance surprised, even startled her.
<name>him</name>	him	John	Love at thirty-two, he had discovered, possessed powers and perceptions which young love could never grasp. He understood now things he had not then understood. His love had made [MASK] wise and kind and at the same time far less sure of himself when under its sway.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	John	She had an irresistible way of arching herself around one’s ankles when she wanted attention, purring with incredible distinctness. She liked nothing so much as to chase a spool down a sloping deck, retrieving it with her paw before it reached the trough below the rail and pushing it up again to where [MASK] waited.
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Ellen	“Well, if it comes to that, maybe they are,” agreed [MASK] with an expectant eye on the staircase through the open door. “But it doesn’t do to act so if most people want to play them.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	John	One of the nine elms which bordered his driveway, elms which as tiny trees his uncle had planted on the very day of [MASK]’s birth as memorials to him, was obviously dying slowly from lack of room in which to grow.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Mary	[MASK] was sobbing now with her head in her arms on the table. She could not look at her mother, who felt with some justice that she was making a bad mess of things. In the eighties such conversations, if they were held at all, were seldom marked with success.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Ellen	She had wanted, she said, to see him safely settled in his own home with someone to care for him. [MASK], she was sure, would be the best of housekeepers, neat and thrifty and always pleasant to look at.
<name>John</name>	John	John	She said all these things and many more while [MASK] was stowing away her possessions in the back of the carriage. She was annoyed at his insistence that he should stop at the brick house to tell his mother things were started.
<name>Seagulls</name>	Seagulls	Gulls	Through the filthy harbour water oars, rattling in their locks, rose and fell rhythmically. [MASK] screamed, swooped downward with a hiss to rise again with a mighty beating of wings. In the cabin itself all was quiet.
<name>Una</name>	Una	Mary	Fear making it overbold, it flew to the deck for crumbs, staying with them in the sun all day long. The next morning it lay dead in a secluded corner. [MASK] herself found it there when she had run early and hopefully to the deck to give it breakfast.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Mary	She sang about the house, ran up and down the stairs, could scarcely sit still even to eat. She was a whirlwind and a fire all in one; and [MASK], watching the glow in her cheeks and the shining in her eyes, thought she had never seen anyone so lovely.
<name>Abbie</name>	Abbie	Ellen	“She’s been talking about the August sale for hours, thinks she’s there selling fancy work.” “That August sale,” observed the doctor, “causes enough delirium in this village among well folks.” There was something in his manner that made [MASK] more nervous.
<name>Thady</name>	Thady	John	The next time I come I’ll likely bring you some news. Another two hours more will likely see us through.” But it was ten o’clock before things were over and [MASK]’s son had come. Toward the end things did not go so well as they might.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mary	He kept his curious, silent dependence upon [MASK] who liked him and found herself far more at home with him than with her brother. She helped him now and then with his lessons toward which he maintained an annoying indifference.
<name>Cherry</name>	Cherry	Star	And if horses, then cows and goats and sheep, for an army must be fed. And great, lumbering racks of hay following after the whole army host and drawn, perhaps, by scores of yokes of stout red oxen, like [MASK] and Bright at home.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Hester	He was not looking at the music at all. Instead his eyes were on [MASK]’s neck as it rose from her round white collar, and his lips were unmistakably against one of her yellow braids of hair which she wore coiled about her head.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Ellen	“Remember, mamma,” interposed [MASK], “that this is going to be a real grown-up party with supper around the table, not just refreshments, and games in the evening. Remember, you said I could invite older boys and girls.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mary	Even had she been more trying, it would not have mattered so much to [MASK]. She was forever conscious that she lived two lives, the effulgence of one so irradiating the pale light of the other that it was often dimmed or put completely out of sight.
<name>Imagination</name>	Imagination	Fancy	Thus illness became an unexplored mine of treasure, its outer chambers of thought opening into inner fastnesses of spirit wherein she knew the Tree of Life and heard the sound of living waters. [MASK], too, lighted its candles, bringing laughter and gaiety out of the most humdrum occurrences.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ellen	[MASK] tended the lemonade booth at the sale. The ladies at the fancywork table decided they could spare her best for that. She looked pretty in her white graduation frock beneath her fragrant booth, and she knew just what to say to all the young men in flannels who wanted lemonade for themselves and their friends.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Hester	She kept always an abiding sense of his understanding. Besides, there was more than a little of him in the rooms in which she lived. She thought more often of [MASK] during that winter than she had thought in years.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	John	There was no silence, she thought, comparable to the silence of fog. It weighed upon them, shut them in, sang in their ears. 13 When she and [MASK] drove back at midnight, the full moon had at last conquered the clinging whiteness.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	John	Raking up after the load, he left the fields untidy, bearded with hay. He was forever borrowing [MASK]’s tools to tinker round at this and that, leaving them strewn about the place where they collected bits of rust upon their shiny steel.
<name>Carriages</name>	Carriages	Surreys	By four o’clock the sale was over. The salaries of both ministers seemed assured. [MASK] and buggies and carryalls were stirring the August dust on the shore roads east and west, and in the vestry kitchen women in ample aprons were clearing up and congratulating themselves on a wholly successful venture.
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Jim	And that night, after the boat had returned [MASK] and his father to their ship, and she was at last in bed, she fell immediately asleep in spite of a melancholy determination to review in every minutest detail a most momentous day and to see herself as one who had resolutely put away all childish things.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Mary	I’ll feel sorry for her all the days of my life, [MASK], even until I’m old. I know I shall. All our lessons tonight seem full of sad things. I felt like crying when we read about the Crusades.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Ellen	“She’s clear out of her head. She can’t mean to throw herself away on a shiftless fellow like that.” [MASK] sent a knowing look across the table at her mother. “He has a way with women,” she said.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	John	His skin was bronzed and toughened, his stout hands also, and about him there clung a smell of his patient old horse and his moth-eaten laprobe. He knew things, [MASK] concluded, that all men ought to know, and he was glad to have him in his kitchen.
<name>John</name>	John	Warren	After [MASK] died didn’t I go to work the very next day after the funeral and put up a hundred jars of fruit? Some of my neighbours thought I was crazy not to sit moping around or not to go through his things the way some folks would.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mary	“He always had, and [MASK]’s probably no different from the rest for all her stand-offishness.” “I don’t know anything about his ways. I don’t like him and never did from the day he came to your party till now.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Mary	While the after-meeting, which was always held by a few of the faithful ones over those who had come forward, went on, [MASK] escaped out-of-doors and walked up and down before the church in the cold. The land was wrapped in snow.
<name>Mrs. Ramsay</name>	Mrs. Ramsay	Mary	[MASK], coming in an hour later to light the lamps, found herself not only conscious of him but hoping for his approval of her. What there was about him sitting there which pervaded the house and made such inroads upon her she did not know, but there it was.
<name>Patricia</name>	Patricia	Ellen	After all’s said and done, principles are principles, and the time comes when you have to stand up for them.” [MASK] from the start had not shared her mother’s consternation. “In my opinion,” she said, “you’re crossing a bridge you’ll never have to come to.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	John	Across the front of his shirt he wore a leather bib into which he stuck his great needles, and on the palm of his right hand was his thimble, encased in leather and securely strapped across the back. Once when [MASK] was twelve his sewing and repairing had been used for quite a different purpose.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Mary	And then, after what seemed hours to [MASK] sitting there, “I’m sorry for that. When?” “Last spring,” he said. “She was sick a long time, years I guess.
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Hester	He did not fall asleep so often over his paper or book as he had used to do, and now and then he unbent enough to suggest a lunch before bedtime. [MASK] had a way of asking him about his day, what he had done and how his animals were.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	John	She thought of [MASK] as she followed the country road to the Peters house, peering every now and then into her sagging basket to see if its contents were safe. He had grown bigger than she had any idea of during the months he had been from home.
<name>John</name>	John	John	And besides there was the farm, badly rented since [MASK]’s death to people who did not keep things up as they should. It made her positively crazy to see things at such loose ends, the lawn uncared for, the garden grown up to grass, machinery left out in all weathers.
<name>Earth</name>	Earth	Petersport	Stars came out then, such stars as [MASK] would never know; purple shores lay in the distance with dark, shadowy palm trees; and a great orange moon began to describe an arc on the horizon and then a circle as it swung higher into the eastern sky.
<name>Mr. Deasy</name>	Mr. Deasy	Mary	[MASK] could not bring her books too often to his fireside. He sat with his black skull cap well over his bald old head and showed her plates he had of Liburnian biremes, of triremes and quin-queremes to supplement those in her history, of Flemish carracks and Portuguese caravels.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ellen	Moreover, he was in love, swept at night by dreams about [MASK] which he carried into the day, allowing his startled imagination its full sway as he went about his acres. Love at thirty-two, he had discovered, possessed powers and perceptions which young love could never grasp.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Ellen	[MASK] finished washing the berries. She emptied them from the colander into a yellow bowl and began to measure out sugar for them in a tin measuring cup. “He might have had a worse fate,” she said quietly. “And now suppose we let him alone.
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Ellen	He was compelled to go there, not because he was angry or even hurt, but because he was suddenly afraid of [MASK], of her powers to wound not his feelings so much as the thoughts which had determined his fife and dignified his work.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Ellen	She said, too, that one simply couldn’t keep pace with young folks nowadays. Nothing seemed to stump them, even twenty-five below zero. But [MASK] had been dull enough, tired of kmtting and crocheting and reading, and maybe a change would be good for her.
