<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ammu	Against the side of the pot so you couldn’t hear. Her father’s hardness had left her eyes and they were [MASK]-eyes again. She had deep dimples in her smile and didn’t seem angry any more.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Velutha	To break a chain of thought. To ruin a fragment of a dream being carried around carefully like a piece of porcelain. To let it be, to travel with it, as [MASK] did, is much the harder thing to do.
<name>Amma</name>	Amma	Ammu	Not both. Together they were trouble. nataS ni rieht seye. They had to be separated. Maybe they’re right, [MASK]’s whisper said as she packed his trunk and holdall. Maybe a boy does need a Baba.
<name>Maisie</name>	Maisie	Rahel	‘You’re welcome, my sweetheart,’ she said, but sadly. You’re welcome, my sweetheart. The moth on [MASK]’s heart lifted a downy leg. Then put it back. Its little leg was cold. A little less her mother loved her.
<name>Zaitoon</name>	Zaitoon	Chacko	You can only create awareness. Educate them. They must launch their own struggle. They must overcome their fears.’ ‘Of whom?’ [MASK] smiled. ‘Me?’ ‘No, not you, my dear Comrade. Of centuries of oppression.’
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Hysterical	‘Where is the molestee now?’ ‘At home. She doesn’t know I’ve come here. She wouldn’t have let me come. Naturally - she’s frantic with worry about the children. [MASK].’
<name>Velutha</name>	Velutha	Grief	She saw [MASK] and Trouble ahead, and secredy, in her heart of hearts, she exulted. She said (among other things) - ‘How could she stand the smell? Haven’t you noticed, they have a particular smell, these Paravans?’
<name>Estha</name>	Estha	Kuttappen	Some water dribbled down his chin. The twins squatted on their haunches, like professional adult gossips in the Ayemenem market. They sat in silence for a while. [MASK] mortified, the twins preoccupied with boat thoughts. ‘Has Chacko Saar’s Mol come?’
<name>Rosemary</name>	Rosemary	Ammu	[MASK] checked them for deformities before she closed her eyes and slept. She counted four eyes, four ears, two mouths, two noses, twenty fingers and twenty perfect toe-nails. She didn’t notice the single Siamese soul. She was glad to have them.
<name>Leopold</name>	Leopold	Estha	Every First Class train thing was green. The seats green. The berths green. The floor green. The chains green. Darkgreen Lightgreen. to stop train pull chain, it said in green. ot pots niart llup niahc , [MASK] thought in green.
<name>Rahel</name>	Rahel	Estha	Burdened with a number of small unmanageable packages and unabashed public adulation, he felt obliged to perform. He kept dropping his packages and saying, ‘Ende Deivomay! Eee sadhanangal!' [MASK] laughed a high, delighted laugh. ‘Ammu look!
<name>Mowgli</name>	Mowgli	Ammu	‘We be of one blood, ye and I.’ [MASK] leaned against the bedroom door in the dark, reluctant to return to the dinner table where the conversation circled like a moth around the white child and her mother as though they were the only source of light.
<name>she</name>	she	Ammu	Long after she left him, she never stopped wondering why he lied so outrageously when he didn’t need to. Particularly when he didn’t need to. In a conversation with friends he would talk about how much he loved smoked salmon when [MASK] knew he hated it.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Velutha	Much to his mother’s dismay, [MASK] began to avoid going home. He worked late. He caught fish in the river and cooked it on an open fire. He slept outdoors, on the banks of the river. Then one day he disappeared.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mammachi	A waltzing man and a waltzing woman. She wore a white dress with legs underneath. ‘Don’t you?’ There was paperweight waltz music. [MASK] was playing it on her violin. Ra-ra-ra-ra-rum.
<name>Shared</name>	Shared	Smashed	His white, sudden smile that he had carried with him from boyhood into manhood. His only luggage. They looked at each other. They weren’t thinking any more. The time for that had come and gone. [MASK] smiles lay ahead of them.
<name>He</name>	He	Rahel	Yellow slivers of cucumber skin flecked her bosom. Her hair, dyed jetblack, was arranged across her scalp like unspooled thread. The dye had stained the skin of her forehead a pale grey, giving her a shadowy second hairline. [MASK] noticed that she had started wearing makeup.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Chacko	When he was in this sort of mood, [MASK] used his Reading Aloud voice. His room had a church-feeling. He didn’t care whether anyone was listening to him or not. And if they were, he didn’t care whether or not they had understood what he was saying.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Ammu	she explained with a smile. ‘And he had a flag!’ The flag had seemed to her a most impressive piece of equipment. The right thing for a friend to have. ‘You’re a stupid silly little girl!’ [MASK] said.
<name>Rahel</name>	Rahel	Velutha	A little way away, [MASK] walked up the shortcut through the rubber trees. Barebodied. A coil of insulated electrical wire was looped over one shoulder. He wore his printed dark blue and black mundu loosely folded up above his knees.
<name>Lucinda</name>	Lucinda	Ammu	She tried to keep the panic out of her voice, make it sound like a casual enquiry. Something crashed against the door. [MASK] was incoherent with rage and disbelief at what was happening to her -at being locked away like the family lunatic in a medieval household.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Rahel	Talking to the darkness now, suddenly insensitive to his little fountain-haired niece. ‘Love. Madness. Hope. Infinite joy.’ Of the four things that were Possible in Human Nature, [MASK] thought that Infimate Joy sounded the saddest.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Rahel	She left them behind, spinning in the dark, with no moorings, in a place with no foundation. Hours later, the moon rose and made the gloomy python surrender what it had swallowed. The garden reappeared. Regurgitated whole. With [MASK] sitting in it.
<name>Railway Raju</name>	Railway Raju	Murlidharan	There was lemon soda in thick bottles with blue marble stoppers to keep the fizz in. And a red ice-box that said rather sadly Things go better with Coca-Cola. [MASK], the level-crossing lunatic, perched cross-legged and perfectly balanced on the milestone.
<name>He</name>	He	Estha	She was taller than [MASK]. And bigger. Her eyes were blue-greyblue. Her pale skin was the colour of beach sand. But her hatted hair was beautiful, deep red-brown. And yes (oh yes!)
<name>Guinness</name>	Guinness	Stoo	‘That’s right! Pineapple slices and [MASK]. And she drinks. Whisky.’ ‘And brandy.’ ‘And brandy. True.’ ‘And looks right and left.’ ‘True.’ ‘And minds other people’s business. ..’
<name>May</name>	May	Ammu	She could see the pattern of the cross-stitch flowers from the blue cross-stitch counterpane on [MASK]’s cheek. She could hear the blue cross-stitch afternoon. The slow ceiling fan. The sun behind the curtains. The yellow wasp wasping against the windowpane in a dangerous dzzzz.
<name>John</name>	John	Pappachi	Except that now she had two young children. And no more dreams. [MASK] would not believe her story - not because he thought well of her husband, but simply because he didn’t believe that an Englishman, any Englishman, would covet another man’s wife.
<name>Practical</name>	Practical	Estha	‘Might have to.’ [MASK]-the-Practical. Distant cake-crumbled voices and approaching Blue Army footsteps caused the comrades to seal the secret. It was pickled, sealed and put away. A red, tender mangoshaped secret in a vat.
<name>Rahel</name>	Rahel	Estha	His yellow teeth were magnets. They saw, they smiled, they sang, they smelled, they moved. They mesmerized. ‘I asked you where you lived,’ he said, spinning his nasty web. ‘Ayemenem,’ [MASK] said.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Chacko	There was husde-bustle. And police whistles. From behind the line of waiting, oncoming traffic, a column of men appeared, with red flags and banners and a hum that grew and grew. ‘Put up your windows,’ [MASK] said.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Chacko	In the year she knew him, before they were married, she discovered a little magic in herself, and for a while felt like a blithe genie released from her lamp. She was perhaps too young to realize that what she assumed was her love for [MASK] was actually a tentative, timorous acceptance of herself.
<name>Trillian</name>	Trillian	Rahel	Have you?’ [MASK] had: Excitement Always Leads to Tears. Dum dum. They arrived at the Princess Circle lobby. They walked past the Refreshment Counter where the orangedrinks were waiting. And the lemondrinks were waiting. The orange too orange. The lemon too lemon.
<name>Mona Lisa</name>	Mona Lisa	Krishna	From the crafty ebullience of a rakshasa with a new idea into a gossipy Malayali with a scandal to spread. From the sensuousness of a woman with a baby at her breast into the seductive mischief of [MASK]’s smile. He can reveal the nugget of sorrow that happiness contains.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Mammachi	It sold quickly, and [MASK] found that she had more orders than she could cope with. Thrilled with her success, she decided to persist with the pickles and jam, and soon found herself busy all year round.
<name>Tridib</name>	Tridib	Estha	[MASK] stopped singing and got up to go back in. ‘Now that I’m up,’ the Orangedrink Lemondrink Man said, ‘now that you’ve woken me up from my Resting Time, now that you’ve disturbed me, at least come and have a drink.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Estha	‘Now finish your drink,’ he said, and affectionately squished a cheek of [MASK]’s bottom. Tight plums in drainpipes. And beige and pointy shoes. ‘You mustn’t waste it,’ he said. ‘Think of all the poor people who have nothing to eat or drink.
<name>Adichie</name>	Adichie	Ammu	So that new policemen on the beat would have no trouble identifying whom to harass. [MASK] always noticed them in the market, the women with vacant eyes and forcibly shaved heads in the land where long, oiled hair was only for the morally upright.
<name>She</name>	She	Rahel	‘We’re divorced.’ [MASK] hoped to shock him into silence. ‘Die-vorced?’ His voice rose to such a high register that it cracked on the question mark. He even pronounced the word as though it were a form of death.
<name>Miles</name>	Miles	Murlidharan	His balls and penis dangled down, pointing towards the sign which said: COCHIN 23 [MASK] was naked except for the tall plastic bag that somebody had fitted onto his head like a transparent chef’s cap through which the view of the landscape continued - dimmed, chef-shaped, but uninterrupted.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Ammu	He was held up, wedged between the notclean basin and [MASK]’s body. Legs dangling. The basin had steel taps, and rust stains. And a brownwebbed mesh of hairline cracks, like the roadmap of some great, intricate city.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Kuttappen	[MASK] thought with envy of mad men who could walk. He had no doubts about the equity of the deal; his sanity, for serviceable legs. The twins put the boat down, and the clatter was met with a sudden silence from inside.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Ammu	The words of the song exploded in her head. There’s no time to lose I heard her say Cash your dreams before 33i They slip away Dying all the time Lose your dreams and you Will lose your mind. [MASK] drew her knees up and hugged them.
<name>Zelda</name>	Zelda	Ammu	She smoked long cigarettes in a silver cigarette holder and learned to blow perfect smoke rings. Her husband turned out to be not just a heavy drinker but a full-blown alcoholic with all of an alcoholic’s deviousness and tragic charm. There were things about him that [MASK] never understood.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Kuttappen	He was paralysed from his chest downwards. Day after day, month after month, while his brother was away and his father went to work, [MASK] lay flat on his back and watched his youth saunter past without stopping to say hello.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Estha	‘But communists don’t believe in ghosts,’ [MASK] said, as though they were continuing a discourse investigating solutions to the ghost problem. Their conversations surfaced and dipped like mountain streams. Sometimes audible to other people. Sometimes not. ‘Are we going to become a communist?’
<name>Rahel</name>	Rahel	Lenin	When that didn’t work, [MASK], dressed like a taxi - yellow shirt, black stretchlon shorts - regained his mother’s nylon lap (and his packet of chiclets). He sat on sari flowers and from that unassailable position of strength surveyed the scene impassively.
<name>Tristram</name>	Tristram	Pappachi	In the years to come, even though he had been ill-humoured long before he discovered the moth, [MASK]’s Moth was held responsible for his black moods and sudden bouts of temper. Its pernicious ghost — grey, furry and with unusually dense dorsal tufts — haunted every house that he ever lived in.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Mammachi	‘Thank you for having us. We needed so much to get away.’ [MASK] caught a whiff of inexpensive perfume soured at the edges by airline sweat. (She herself had a botde of Dior in its soft green leather pouch locked away in her safe.)
<name>He</name>	He	Kuttappen	Soon. Too soon. Sometimes (from habit, from missing her), [MASK] coughed like his mother used to, and his upper body bucked like a just-caught fish. His lower body lay like lead, as though it belonged to someone else.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Estha	And nearby in the jungle, in the eerie, storm-coming light, animals queued up in pairs: Girlboy. Girlboy. Girlboy. Girlboy. Twins were not allowed. The rest of the recipe was in [MASK]’s new best handwriting. Angular, spiky.
<name>Mammachi</name>	Mammachi	Mammachi	He said it was because they didn’t suffer from Inbreeding like most Syrian Christians. And Parsees. [MASK] said that what her grandchildren suffered from was far worse than Inbreeding. She meant having parents who were divorced. As though these were the only choices available to people: Inbreeding or Divorce.
<name>Tridib</name>	Tridib	Estha	Mango Orange Banana Green pepper Grape Mixed fruit Bitter gourd Pineapple Grapefruit marmalade Garlic Mango Salted lime Then the gristly-bristly face contorted, and [MASK]’s hand was wet and hot and sticky. It had egg white on it. White egg white. Quarter-boiled.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Ammu	This fell into a pattern. Drunken violence followed by post-drunken badgering. [MASK] was repelled by the medicinal smell of stale alcohol that seeped through his skin, and the dry, caked vomit that encrusted his mouth like a pie every morning.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Gendy	[MASK] he turned her over on her back. He wiped the sweat and grit from her with his wet cloth. He lay over her, careful not to put his weight on her. Small stones pressed into the skin of his forearms. He kissed her eyes.
<name>Ramesh</name>	Ramesh	Chacko	He commuted his pension and provident fund to buy a Bharat botde-sealing machine. His oar (with his team mates’ names inscribed in gold) hung from iron hoops on the factory wall. Up to the time [MASK] arrived, the factory had been a small but profitable enterprise.
<name>Algy</name>	Algy	Stuart	He picked the strawberries out of the jam and put them on one side of his plate. The rest of the jam he spread in a thick layer on his buttered toast. ‘On their thirteenth birthday their father gave [MASK] - the Pessimist - an expensive watch, a carpentry set and a bicycle.’
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Rahel	The orange sun slid through their bent, grasping teeth. A squadron of fruit bats sped across the gloom. In the abandoned ornamental garden, [MASK], watched by lolling dwarves and a forsaken cherub, squatted by the stagnant pond and watched toads hop from stone to scummy stone.
<name>Velutha</name>	Velutha	Mammachi	[MASK] (with impenetrable Touchable logic) often said that if only he hadn’t been a Paravan, he might have become an engineer. He mended radios, clocks, water-pumps. He looked after the plumbing and all the electrical gadgets in the house.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Malayalees	gawkish. Look at the way they dressed! Surely they had more suitable airport wear! Why did [MASK] have such awjul theeth? And the airport itself! More like the local bus depot! The birdshit on the building! Oh the spitstains on the kangeroos!
<name>Mina</name>	Mina	Mammachi	He slouched around the compound in his immaculately tailored suits, weaving sullen circles around mounds of red chillies and freshly powdered yellow turmeric, watching [MASK] supervise the buying, the weighing, the salting and drying, of limes and tender mangoes. Every night he beat her with a brass flower vase.
<name>Time</name>	Time	History	And that inside, map-breath’d ancestors with tough toe-nails whispered to the lizards on the wall. That [MASK] used the back verandah to negotiate its terms and collect its dues. That default led to dire consequences.
<name>Antoinette</name>	Antoinette	Rahel	The sun shone through the Plymouth window directly down at [MASK]. She closed her eyes and shone back at it. Even behind her eyelids the light was bright and hot. The sky was orange, and the coconut trees were sea anemones waving their tentacles, hoping to trap and eat an unsuspecting cloud.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Chacko	She thought of [MASK] fondly, but without regret. It simply did not occur to her that she had hurt him as deeply as she had, because she still thought of herself as an ordinary woman, and him as an extraordinary man.
<name>Matilda</name>	Matilda	Ammu	And truth be told, it was no small wondering matter. Because [MASK] had not had the kind of education, nor read the sorts of books, nor met the sorts of people, that might have influenced her to think the way she did.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Ammu	Looking at herself like this, [MASK]’s soft mouth would twist into a small, bitter smile at the memory - not of the wedding itself so much as the fact that she had permitted herself to be so painstakingly decorated before being led to the gallows.
<name>Anita</name>	Anita	Rahel	‘It’S US.’ The room was dark and clean. It smelled of fish curry and woodsmoke. Heat cleaved to things like a low fever. But the mud floor was cool under [MASK]’s bare feet.
<name>Flannery</name>	Flannery	Estha	Then with bladder empty and conscience clear he would look up at [MASK] with opaque green eyes that stood in his grizzled skull like scummy pools and weave his way back to his damp cushion, leaving wet footprints on the floor.
<name>She</name>	She	Ammu	For the Time Being they had no surname because [MASK] was considering reverting to her maiden name, though she said that choosing between her husband’s name and her father’s name didn’t give a woman much of a choice.
<name>Om</name>	Om	kathakali	The light lit the tin. It didn’t matter that the story had begun, because [MASK] discovered long ago that the secret of the Great Stories is that they have no secrets. The Great Stories are the ones you have heard and want to hear again.
<name>Mina</name>	Mina	Kipling	The way she used [MASK] to love her children before putting them to bed: We be of one blood, ye and /. Her good night kiss. The way she held their faces steady with one hand (squashed-cheeked, fishmouthed) while she parted and combed their hair with the other.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Estha	Lemon?’ the Man said. ‘Lemonorange?’ ‘Lemon, please,’ [MASK] said politely. He got a cold botde and a straw. So he held a botde in one hand and a penis in the other. Hard, hot, veiny.
<name>Adrian</name>	Adrian	Lenin	He was like a flasher in a hedge. Enticing people with his nipples and then forcing pictures of his son on them. He flipped through the pack of photographs (a pictorial guide to [MASK]’s Life-in-a-Minute) to the last one.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Chacko	The lenses immediately grew fogged with hair oil. ‘Synthetic Cooking Vinegar,’ he said. ‘This all is in caps, I suppose.’ ‘Prussian Blue,’ [MASK] said. ‘Prepared from Acetic Acid?’
<name>Ojikutu</name>	Ojikutu	Mammachi	They took it because they needed it. They had young children and old parents. Or husbands who spent all their earnings in toddy bars. The arrangement suited [MASK], because in her mind, a fee clarified things. Disjuncted sex from love. Needs from Feelings.
<name>Arjun</name>	Arjun	Estha	he would call out, in his high, piping voice, frayed and fibrous now, like sugarcane stripped of its bark. ‘Good morning! Your daily constitutional?’ [MASK] would walk past, not rude, not polite. Just quiet.
<name>Artemis</name>	Artemis	Estha	A servile constable brought them on a plastic tray and offered them to the two muddy children sitting across the table from the Inspector, their heads only a litde higher than the mess of files and papers on it. So once again, in the space of two weeks, botded Fear for [MASK].
<name>Rahel</name>	Rahel	Chacko	She managed that by doing what she was best at. Irrigating her fields, nourishing her crops with other people’s passions. She gnawed like a rat into the godown of [MASK]’s grief. Within its walls she planted an easy, accessible target for his insane anger.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ammu	Nobody would look at them. It was hot in the church, and the white edges of the arum lilies crisped and curled. A bee died in a coffin flower. [MASK]’s hands shook and her hymnbook with it. Her skin was cold.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Estha	Like a Man. The cigarette stubs, soggy then, were wet now, and swirly. Hard to light. When he finished, [MASK] moved the cans to the basin in front of the mirror. He washed his hands and wet his hair.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ammu	A deep-sounding bell in a mossy well. Shivery and furred like moth’s feet. At the time, there would only be incoherence. As though meaning had slunk out of things and left them fragmented. Disconnected. The glint of [MASK]’s needle.
<name>Ed Sullivan</name>	Ed Sullivan	Donahue	The busker glowed with Prime-Time Happiness, and for a few moments, deprivation took a back seat. It had been his dream to sing on the [MASK] show, he said, not realizing that he had just been robbed of that too.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Rahel	Her good night kiss. The way she held their faces steady with one hand (squashed-cheeked, fishmouthed) while she parted and combed their hair with the other. The way she held knickers out for [MASK] to climb into. Left leg, right leg.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Ammu	A thin red cow with a protruding pelvic bone appeared and swam straight out to sea without wetting her horns, without looking back. [MASK] flew through her dream on heavy, shuddering wings, and stopped to rest, just under the skin of it.
<name>Leopold</name>	Leopold	Estha	[MASK] noticed that the hair on his head was curly grey, the hair in his windy, armless armpits was wispy black, and the hair in his crotch was black and springy. One man with three kinds of hair.
<name>Rahel</name>	Rahel	Chacko	She swayed slighdy as she spoke. At first [MASK] thought it was a Malayalam translation of ‘Lochinvar’. The words ran into each other. The last syllable of one word attached itself to the first syllable of the next. It was rendered at remarkable speed.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Ammu	This was his first incursion into management circles. [MASK] watched her husband’s mouth move as it formed words. She said nothing. He grew uncomfortable and then infuriated by her silence. Suddenly he lunged at her, grabbed her hair, punched her and then passed out from the effort.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Chacko	‘It was my fault! I never meant it to sound quite like that. . . what I meant was - I mean it is fascinating to think that - ’ ‘It was a perfectly legitimate question,’ [MASK] said.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Estha	Already she regretted having written to her about [MASK]’s return. But then, what else could she have done? Had him on her hands for the rest of her life? Why should she? He wasn’t her responsibility. Or was he?
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Mammachi	They were strangers who had met in a chance encounter. They had known each other before Life began. There is very little that anyone could say to clarify what happened next. Nothing that (in [MASK]’s book) would separate Sex from Love. Or Needs from Feelings.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Ammu	[MASK] picked it out. ‘I’ve told you before,’ she said. ‘I don’t want you going to his house. It will only cause trouble.’ What trouble, she didn’t say. She didn’t know.
<name>Rahel</name>	Rahel	Mammachi	Kochu Maria, who slept on the floor on a mat, said that she would complain to [MASK]. ‘Tell your mother to take you to your father’s house,’ she said. ‘There you can break as many beds as you like.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Ammu	All three of them bonded by the certain, separate knowledge that they had loved a man to death. That wasn’t in the papers. It took the twins years to understand [MASK]’s part in what had happened.
<name>Bluebell</name>	Bluebell	Mammachi	Her tongue pushed through the trap of teeth and had [MASK]’s silver thimble fitted on the end of it. (She had hijacked it the day she arrived, and vowed to spend her holidays drinking only from a thimble.) She held out a lit candle in each hand.
<name>Chike</name>	Chike	Estha	[MASK] put his head in his lap. His puff was spoiled. A distant train rumble seeped upwards from the frog-stained road. The yam leaves on either side of the railway track began to nod in mass consent.
<name>Nowl</name>	Nowl	Ammu	Full of furred moths and icy butterflies. And deep-sounding bells. And moss. And a Nowl. The dirty airport curtain was a great comfort and a darkness and a shield. ‘Just ignore her,’ [MASK] said, and smiled tightly.
<name>Wisteria</name>	Wisteria	Ayemenem	She suspected that these days, even the innocent and the round-eyed could be crockery crooks, or cream-bun cravers, or thieving diabetics cruising [MASK] for imported insulin. She didn’t even trust the twins. She deemed them Capable of Anything.
<name>Bobby</name>	Bobby	Estha	Mother, father, brother, husband, bestfriend. Nobody.’ With children, she said (when they asked), it remained to be seen. She said it was entirely possible, for instance, that [MASK] could grow up to be a Male Chauvinist Pig.
<name>Ravi</name>	Ravi	Chacko	Slow out. Slow in. A predator’s lazy blink. The sheets were coarse, but clean. [MASK] closed his wallet and put out the light. Into the night he lit a Charminar and wondered what his daughter looked like now. Nine years old.
<name>Trillian</name>	Trillian	Ammu	A mosquito on a leash. A Refugee Stick Insect in Bata sandals. An Airport Fairy at a railway station. Stamping her feet on the platform, unsetding clouds of setded station-filth. Until [MASK] shook her and told her to Stoppit and she Stoppited.
