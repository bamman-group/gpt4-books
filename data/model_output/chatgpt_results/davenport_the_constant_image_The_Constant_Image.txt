<name>Lily</name>	Lily	Pina	He had 213 done it to punish [MASK]. Perhaps it was her own heart, roused by a stab of pity, which told her so; but she was sure that that had been his reason for coming and she needed to ponder very little more before she understood the sequence of what had happened.
<name>Mr. Ryder</name>	Mr. Ryder	Harriet	her host asked, after he had seated [MASK] on his right at luncheon. “Loving it. I’m still so grateful, and surprised—if you don’t misunderstand—at everyone’s hospitality. I hadn’t expected to be taken in amongst you like this.”
<name>he</name>	he	Carlo	He never missed anything. “What were you saying?” “I want him to talk about you,” she said. “Why else do you think I’m dining with him?” “I will tell him to talk about himself,” said [MASK].
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Poveretta	[MASK]! he thought, as he had done before. It was too soon to judge how she would consistently behave, but she had learnt so much, so well, so quickly, that he hoped for the best. Still, he was alert to the dangers.
<name>someone</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	someone (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	Carlo	A bad one.” “Did they—did he—” “No. He didn’t die there. Many did, very many. He was still alive there when the war ended and [MASK] went and brought him home.”
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Lydia	It was so pleasant, so much part of a wonderfully agreeable fantasy; this waking just now had startled her briefly while shining little pieces fell into the pattern which told her where she was. But once awake and sharing [MASK]’s cocoon, it was tempting to slip away again into the stream of lovely unreality.
<name>she</name>	she	Harriet	But if [MASK] let herself feel that certain of the women were more acute in their watchfulness than others, she did not require to seek the reason, she had long since realized it and even managed to surmount her initial revulsion at such stripping-away of her privacy.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Harriet	But other people would be heaping confusion upon us.” “Beginning with your mother.” [MASK] put her face against his and whispered, “I am ashamed to tell you how true that is.” He sat down again, holding her in his arms.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Carlo	I suppose it was her own fault, she brought him up—but the way he turned out, she simply left him an allowance to live on and left her money to me with directions that I was to be taught to take care of it.” [MASK]’s face was a study.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Mamma	It is old-fashioned, it was my father’s house. [MASK] uses it sometimes. And we used to come occasionally in the spring or the autumn when the children were small, but there’s not much for them to do there.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Harriet	Desecration, thought [MASK], heartlessness; those women!—how I hate to be one of them. I want to be different, I want to be a rarity and cherished, I want to be myself. Suddenly the voice of pure reason, like one crystal drop, tinged in her mind’s ear.
<name>him</name>	him	Harriet	“Oh, it’s nothing,” said [MASK]. “Just an upset. Probably something I ate, or a bug.” I can look at him now, she thought, but this morning I’d have said I never wanted to see him again.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Harriet	Underneath it’s cold reason. They’ll fight when they care what they are fighting for, but they very seldom care. Once they do care they can fight, and their endurance is quite unbelievable.” “They care about their families,” said [MASK] quietly.
<name>my dear</name>	my dear	Pina	“Then you will be courting disaster.” “You threaten me?” She stood staring at him, her eyes enormous. “Of course not. Up to now this is a tragedy, [MASK], that is bad enough. But it is not a disaster.
<name>Dora</name>	Dora	Tad	“Only you have learnt, my dearest? Only you?” “It was I who had the learning to do. But I have so much, oh I have so much to be grateful to you for.” “[MASK],” he whispered.
<name>John</name>	John	Harriet	I hope you are not putting things in your mind in a light which has no relation to reality.” “I do not think you understand reality as we see it. I do not think you know what it is.” [MASK] was surprised.
<name>Lady Bracknell</name>	Lady Bracknell	Harriet	The bells rang for the last act and [MASK] exclaimed, “Oh, we must hurry, we mustn’t miss the lights going down.” They laughed and she said, “I know, but I love that moment so.”
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Harriet	“Are you awake?” he asked, with a hint of intimacy in his voice. “My word, it’s flattering,” said [MASK] with derision. “I’m so flattered I’m simply purring.” “Don’t be preoccupied about it.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Pina	but his brain was responding to a series of telegraphic taps which spelt, she thinks this has gone farther than it has, she is bringing up her big defences already, she is prepared to see it through. My God! what women have to put up with, and what a woman [MASK] is!
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Lydia	“Anyway, we’ll get through Tuesday—” “And Thursday. And then I’ll concentrate on getting ready to leave. By the way—have you any special cues for me for Tuesday?” [MASK] shook her head.
<name>Undine</name>	Undine	Harriet	“And also—you won’t think I’m prying?” “Darling!” “If you should want to go there—you know, by yourself— it’s always possible.” “You are too wonderful,” said [MASK] softly. “No.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Harriet	“I don’t want to have an affair with him,” said [MASK] abrupdy. “He is absolutely charming, you couldn’t be more right. But—” she bit her lip. “I can’t help seeing it from his wife’s point of view.”
<name>George</name>	George	Sandro	“I think so. The children love it and [MASK]’s such an angel he indulges my whims. Actually, he likes it himself now he’s got the habit. Everybody we know thinks I’m mad to keep that house open all year round.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Carlo	[MASK] entered into it with reason and at a suitable age. The basis of it is sound, a good alliance for both families.” She made a balancing motion with her expressive hands. “We have more money, they have more race.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Slighdy	She had a mind of her own, they all had; some of the evidences of their wilfulness and independence were in fact irritating. [MASK] as he knew her, he had not failed to notice certain of these signs in her.
<name>Freddy</name>	Freddy	Harriet	“But how will you get it all through the Dogana?” [MASK] looked at the pile of boxes which were to be sent out ahead to the airport in the car that they had taken for the day. “Me ne frega,” he shrugged.
<name>Paris</name>	Paris	Milano	“Nobody?” “Truly. Nobody.” “But they can't all be blind, they can’t all be pederasts!” “Oh, my God, why is this a good connection from [MASK]?”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Pina	“It 148 is so beautiful, and I can’t think when I shall ever be here to enjoy another.” She included [MASK] in her wide, smiling look at them all. The flat stare came back into the topaz eyes, a look of pure hatred.
<name>Romeo</name>	Romeo	Carlo	“It would be beyond my courage,” said [MASK]’s mother, “to ask you not to see him while you are still here. I could not bring myself to punish both of you so much.”
<name>she</name>	she	Harriet	He was successful at business, avid for sport, amusement, and motion; he was attractive to women, resdess, thoughtless, and rich. Neither he nor [MASK] looked upon their life as a reservoir into which to pour the components of a long and fruitful future.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Carlo	... I am here!” “Yes, I know it. Oh, [MASK], what have you done?” She had his face between her hands, searching his eyes which were no more disposed to answer questions than his tongue was. “Not now.
<name>The French</name>	The French	Cynical	They’re very different from us.” “[MASK].” “Yes, and rational. All the silliness about them, the gestures and the panache, the hot tempers—it doesn’t mean a thing. Underneath it’s cold reason.
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Pina	“But, [MASK].” She had not looked up from the magazine. “Are you ill?” “Certainly not. I am simply not going.” “My dear, will you please put down that paper. What do you mean?”
<name>Lucia</name>	Lucia	Harriet	Gradually through fragments of talk less erudite than that about books and art and history [MASK] came to grasp what the bond was. It was philanthropy. She had heard little up to now of this, intrinsic to a tradition and an ancient civic pride which marked certain Milanesi.
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Harriet	But [MASK], on waking from that deep velvet sleep of midafternoon, which seems more profound than any other and carries deception in its soft sleeves, looked at her watch. Twenty minutes!—and she could have sworn, struggling up from blissful submergence, that it had been ten times as long.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Harriet	“I know this isn’t merely an affair, that’s the trouble. Not just what it was meant to be.” “Never mind that,” said [MASK] harshly. “It’s too late, the milk is spilt—what were you about to say?”
<name>he</name>	he	Harriet	But as she watched, the expression began to change; was it a softening, warmed by love of her son; or could it possibly be the residue of what [MASK] had felt before, a genuine liking for her which must with a certain regret, be sacrificed to the exactions of responsibility?
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Harriet	[MASK] loved his wrists, strong, flexible, delicately shadowed with dark hair. “It is three o’clock,” he said, “and I must go to work. Can you occupy yourself for the afternoon? I shall be here by seven-thirty.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Harriet	[MASK] sat and watched him. “You do not see them, of course. But others, friends of theirs—righteous prigs or busybodies or bootlickers or whatever they are—a certain part of those people will do their best to—” My poor darling, she thought.
<name>Monte Cristo</name>	Monte Cristo	Lech	She looked at him with wonder. “And I have given you nothing, ever,” he said with bitterness, “except flowers.” “They have said what we must never forget,” she said. “And you said it too at [MASK].”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Harriet	He came now every day in the late afternoon, and stayed until almost eight. They never felt ready to be parted when the moment came for him to leave, but [MASK] sped him away with the gayest smile, the lightest touch, she could muster.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Pina	He did not want to see [MASK] tonight, and he drove to his mother’s house. He told a servant to telephone his house, to say where he was and that he would be at home in the morning. He went almost immediately to bed.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Lydia	[MASK] was wearing a gown of stiff, pale, water-green moire embroidered with diamante and pearls and corals, her bosom and shoulders rose white as foam from the sea-like fantasy and her fair hair capped it like a sunlit cloud.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Harriet	[MASK] stood open-mouthed, deciding how to respond to this. The thing not to show was the spark of delight which touched her when she saw him. He pretended to ignore her for a time, then he put down the magazine and sat shaking with laughter, holding out his arms.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Lydia	Oh, to be away from here, to be gone; her mind had sprung ahead to that, which had more urgency even than her wanting this party to end. She had the wit to look at [MASK], to say with a glance, “Go!
<name>darling</name>	darling	Carlo	He stopped her peals of laughter with another long kiss, to which she responded so warmly that he sat up suddenly, took her hands in his, scowled, and said, “Answer all those questions. Whom did you take for a lover?” “No, [MASK].
<name>she</name>	she	Pina	I know when I hurt her and I am sad that I hurt her, but as I said before, that is what life is. So long as [MASK] knows the ground is solid beneath her feet she will be, she will act, as she does now.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Harriet	“And?” “We love it!” He spoke with the utmost gusto. [MASK] could not think of another reply, so she said, “You have given me quite a perspective from which to go on reading this book.”
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Carlo	“I forgot, I am lunching with you tomorrow, that should be enough of me before Friday.” “Lunch, yes; and six o’clock too. Tell me, what did you do today?” “But, [MASK]—” “Where did you lunch?”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Carlo	[MASK] sensed that, he was driving slowly, sometimes touching her for a moment tenderly; he must have felt the faint trembling which she could not conquer. “What is it, my dearest?” he asked. “Don’t be afraid to say it.”
<name>She</name>	She	Harriet	But I had not decided what I would say until I walked in there and saw some of those faces.” “I do not deserve it.” [MASK] bent her head. “I should never have let things come to this pass. I should have left weeks ago.
<name>Frances</name>	Frances	Harriet	“Quite a lot,” said [MASK]. “The hats are heaven.” There was nothing in the world to talk about except what she did not want to hear or say, anything to do with anybody’s life: men, love, marriage, any of it.
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Harriet	It is a fact of life, like many other things— but it does not excuse either of you.” [MASK] stared at the fine face, cold with reproof as she had never seen it. She had not dreamt that there could be a person like this woman.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Pina	and it’s none of my business what he does or with whom—until that involves you. [MASK] doesn’t care that you and I are like sisters, but what that means in this case is that I’ll have to do what I can to protect everybody.”
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Carlo	“Cold and passionate. It is a difficult combination. And [MASK] is the most difficult kind of husband. Her lot is not easy, but she makes it harder for herself by her arrogance and her jealousy.” “I have found her wise.
<name>he</name>	he	Lydia	I can look at him now, she thought, but this morning I’d have said I never wanted to see him again. “But you look so white, really ill. Has the doctor been?” “Of course,” said [MASK].
<name>Montmorency</name>	Montmorency	Nevile	“He was fanatical after they’d got his father, and even I don’t know everything he did. He was a brave, resourceful man.” [MASK] smiled rather sadly. “It’s not often one knows an Italian in just the combination of circumstances which brings out those qualities.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Harriet	She made a balancing motion with her expressive hands. “We have more money, they have more race. Something solid from both sides.” [MASK] thought of her own life and her mother’s and those of most of the people she knew.
<name>his wife</name>	his wife	Pina	It was closely linked to his mood, to his whereabouts, and to the state of his relations with [MASK]. He was fond of her and proud of her always, but she came nearest to holding him completely when they were off with the children on holidays like this.
<name>dear</name>	dear	Carlo	“Well, it’s true. And my grandmother was the only child of a rugged old roughneck who made his money in mining —oh, it’s all such ancient history, [MASK].” “No, go on. I’m fascinated.
<name>Marco</name>	Marco	Ortolani	His usual impatience, he sighed; wasn’t he old enough to have learnt not to spring at things on impulse? Well, he would send [MASK] a lampo as soon as he got downstairs; he would not interrupt his holiday, and next week would take care of itself.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Sandro	“So did [MASK]. An Italian has no real idea what we are like. So long as he may be playing with one of us it doesn’t matter much—but when he marries, that’s different. They expect a great deal of their wives.”
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Cretini	“That’s just the point,” he growled. “It’s the principle of the thing. Imbecili! [MASK]! The only part of me this damned thing warms is the part that doesn’t need it!” and he threw it on the floor.
<name>partner</name>	partner	Carlo	She slowed down and said, “Does my driving make you nervous, [MASK]? Do you want to go down this yourself?” “No,” he said. There was an odd note in his voice. “I want to see you do it.”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Cara	Yet he had contrived to move, still embracing her, in such a way that she felt free; and he made an exclamation of delight as he bent his head to kiss her again and felt her arms go round him. “[MASK]!” he murmured.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Harriet	[MASK] was concealing a degree of shock and of disapproval so great that her thoughts tumbled about in a melee of fragments and jagged splinters, the 176 memories of all the wreckage she had ever wrought in a time of unbridled jealousy and the mistakes to which it had prompted her.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Carlo	It was more than the surprise, the shock of his appearance, it was something else. Here was [MASK] with all his warmth and eagerness and his beautiful head and hands, the man she adored; but some-211 thing was strange.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Angela	“Oh, my God, darling, I did forget something! I’d never have thought if you hadn’t said that.” “What?” She was opening her purse. “I forgot to leave [MASK] the keys to lock the heavy luggage she is packing.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Harriet	[MASK] called it the ‘bees and the flowers’ language but when he asked why, she had always refused, laughing, to explain. “You are so tired. Here. Here. There. And here.”
<name>horror</name>	horror	Pina	“It is altogether different and all I am trying to say is that you 218 would hate the view that they take here of people in our situation, they are—” she thought with a retrospective start of [MASK]. Immature barbarians were her words.
<name>he</name>	he	Italians	She could not risk that, remembering a time not vastly long ago when it had been true. She could not help knowing what [MASK] usually thought about American women in her situation and, again, she wanted to take care not to be so jejune as to argue it with or without words.
<name>his wife</name>	his wife	Pina	He avoided [MASK] next morning; he intended to telephone 196 her before one o’clock, and tell her that he would come home for luncheon only if she had got control of herself and could assure him that there would be no more scenes.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Pina	For an instant she saw him from [MASK]’s view. In that light he was heartless, he was cruel, he was selfish. She drew her hand across her eyes as if to shut out the equally horrible idea of how he appeared to women whom he had dropped.
<name>she</name>	she	Harriet	For her part, [MASK] was relieved to be at home and without plans for the evening. She was looking forward for once to going early to bed, with perhaps a scrambled egg for her supper if she felt hungry enough late in the evening to get up and prepare it.
<name>Lady Narborough</name>	Lady Narborough	Lydia	“Oh, don’t be shy about it, darling,” [MASK] laughed. “He’s not supposed to have missed a new beauty in donkey’s years, and his taste is perfect, so it’s flattering.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Carlo	So good— and I am a stranger.” There was no warmth in the face of [MASK]’s mother today. Her eyes were sombre and the necessarily false smile of yesterday had given place to an expression of profound concern.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Harriet	“But in such a warm, natural way. It doesn’t seem a museum.” “No,” said [MASK], “and there are times when it seems particularly like this one’s house or that.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Americans	“If there are others, then they are probably [MASK] too,” he said, “and I should never have thought I would like that. A woman as a rule should not—” he paused and motioned to the barmaid to fill their glasses.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Harriet	They came back to town late on Sunday night and he brought [MASK] to her door. She had said that she would not linger to say good night in the car; he should drive away at once, even though the street appeared deserted.
<name>telegrams</name>	telegrams	Lent	Perhaps she still was terrified, her agitation was so violent that her first concern was to keep it hidden. She turned to give an order to the butler and while she was speaking she heard behind her a muffled female voice say, “They must have renounced the telephone for [MASK].”
<name>Antinous</name>	Antinous	Donatello	His glowing brown eyes, his fine skin, his subtly sculptured mouth, his whole head which might, she often thought, have belonged to a model of [MASK]’s, were for the moment hers and absorbed in her. “Ti piacio io?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Pina	Promise me you won’t try to leave [MASK]’s family party and come to join us late somewhere.” She would have seen, had she been able to, a darkness come over his face but move away as he recognized the pure good sense and kindliness of what she had said.
<name>Jordan</name>	Jordan	Angela	[MASK] told you.” “Yes, she gave me the messages. I understood, but I wanted you to know that I—” “Oh, I knew. One of the troubles with this is that we know everything without having to explain.”
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Pina	“Are you sure it’s all right?” she asked, with her head bent. “It isn’t—it wasn’t—” “No,” he said. “The old one was not given me by [MASK], but by my mother.”
<name>Ikea</name>	Ikea	Grandmama	I’d rather live in something which began with something real, even if it’s only [MASK]’s furniture; that looks like somebody’s home whether it is or not. It’s not a mushroom like this, with a fly perched in it.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Carlo	But not today.” He was mollified, but puzzled. She saw it. She said, “Do you mind very much, [MASK]? I should like to give you pleasure, I want to, and I know—” “What do you know?”
<name>Mme. Henriot</name>	Mme. Henriot	Angela	Yesterday he had brought her his gift, smiling and determined to make their last evening gay. [MASK] who by now adored them both, had prepared the best menu in her simple repertoire, and the flat was like a garden with his flowers.
<name>Melanie</name>	Melanie	Carlo	When you are nothing more than any woman is at times—and a man is there to bear the brunt of it.” “Oh, [MASK],” she said again, and gave in to the comfort of silent tears.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Harriet	“And there’s no fog now,” said [MASK] happily. “Not at midday!” “I don’t see how you people stand it. The strain and the tension, and having to time everything by it.”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Pina	She had a horrible vision of some disaster there, even of [MASK] having overheard him on the telephone. Surely he could not be so bungling. She felt sick and he heard her gasp. “No, no, be tranquil. Nothing is wrong.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Carlo	“Don’t make me spell it all out, [MASK]. Everybody’s been divorced and remarried, on and off the merry-go-round, and—” she looked at him with an expression which moved him sharply—“I loathe it.”
<name>Victor</name>	Victor	Harriet	“Well,” said [MASK] slowly, “now that the opportunity presents itself—•” “ ‘Itself’—! I created it, I alone with a stroke of genius. Come, we have several hours and I have seized them by the throat.”
<name>Bertie</name>	Bertie	Carlo	Well, she was doing it. But she had not reckoned with the perfectly silly factor of terror at [MASK]’s driving which was actually brilliant no matter how it looked; he had the car wholly under control and she knew that as well as he did.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Carlo	And if she calls again after that—” “You will be right there in bed with me,” said [MASK] sav-agely, “and you can tell her not to be an ignorante for interrupting your afternoon rest.”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Harriet	Yesterday morning and today he had heard the telephone conversations in which [MASK] had murmured vague excuses and vaguer promises about a meeting in a day or two. “You must see her the next time she asks you to, and I should like to meet her too.”
<name>she</name>	she	Domenico	“That always seems so wonderful to us.” “Will you have some cognac?” he asked, when [MASK] had served their coffee. “I don’t think so, thank you.” He touched her cheek. “I want none either.
<name>she</name>	she	Harriet	He nodded, leading her to a small dining-room opening from the salon. They sat down, [MASK] waiting eagerly for whatever he had to tell. “My grandfather and his brothers were the last to live here.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Harriet	I thought too that you—” the dark eyes kindled, “might give even more than you received. And if so—of course be richer in the end yourself.” “Oh,” said [MASK].
<name>He</name>	He	Harriet	“People think I do, they think I indulge and excuse him for everything because I am such a doting mother.” She shook her head slowly. “Who should know his faults better than I?” [MASK] did not move.
<name>Mr. J. Gatsby</name>	Mr. J. Gatsby	Harriet	Meanwhile the apartment-house had a restaurant which could send up meals if one were content to have them at fixed hours, and this was one of the reasons why [MASK] had bought this apartment in the first place.
