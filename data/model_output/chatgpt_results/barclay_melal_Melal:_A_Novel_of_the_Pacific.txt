<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jebro	Where the branches curved upward they had the wrinkled look of lizard skin, as if the branches were at times flexible. Birds hidden within the tree’s broad, long lobed leaves sang unseen. “This is the tree where they say he died,” [MASK] said.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jebro	at the checkpoint. Even if he found parts, not too many people knew very much about fixing things. [MASK] knew of a man once who had put together a boat so poorly that the stern snapped off when he mounted the engines.
<name>Rainsford</name>	Rainsford	Etao	[MASK] swam with steady strokes toward the island, and when the first breaker was just about on top of him, he dived down and grabbed the bottom. When the wave had passed, he rose for air and stroked, then dived again.
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Rick	He moved to [MASK]’s left, downwind, and wiped his sweaty brow on the sleeve of his shirt. From somewhere near the front of the church an infant’s muffled cry filtered back through the soft chatter of the congregation. The church was almost three-quarters full.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Crawford	He wore, as usual, a highwater pair of gray slacks and shabby brown dress shoes over black socks that had fallen down around his ankles. One of [MASK]’s hands picked his teeth while the other filled his cup.
<name>his</name>	his	Oly	He sat behind a long metal table, a soldier magazine in front of him. The walls were white, as was [MASK]’s shirt and the high ceiling racked with bright flourescent lights. The tile floor was gray, flecked with green, indented in spots where the legs of tables once had been.
<name>he</name>	he	Rujen	pictures of—but [MASK] could not remember, and it was stupid, maybe even evidence of insanity, he thought, to think that pictures on wiping paper inside of an outhouse, so long ago, could have any importance to anything whatsoever.
<name>Manolin</name>	Manolin	Boyd	“Stop,” he instructed [MASK]. “Time to bring him up.” The pole bent farther over the water each time the boat rose on a swell, the green 130-pound monofilament quivering with the strain, but the marlin did not run.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Etao	“To respect you as the high chief that you are,” [MASK] said, “I give you my life, my meat, so you can survive this drought and breed many good sons just like yourself.”
<name>the Marshallese</name>	the Marshallese	Boyd	He laughed a little, thinking right then how bad he wanted to ask those Marshallese what secret they knew and he did not. “How do you think they did that?” he asked [MASK]. The skiff was less than a hundred yards away.
<name>The protagonist</name>	The protagonist	Travis	The flimsy wooden pier was just a few feet away. It was about twenty feet long, maybe three feet wide, and looked to be made of wood scavenged from crates and pallets. It probably had to be rebuilt after every minor storm. [MASK] went to the bow.
<name>Martin</name>	Martin	Ataji	The frustration he felt was the same, he was sure, which he had seen so often turn to anger in his father, but he knew better than to start something like one of [MASK]’s hopeless protests, certainly not in church, and certainly not if he wanted to keep his job at the plant.
<name>Willow</name>	Willow	Jebro	“[MASK]? That’s a name for a youngest brother. His family must not be very bright.” “The name suits him well. He has the qualities.” “You’re going to create the first tree that’s an addict.”
<name>Brody</name>	Brody	Keju	But now, something felt right about what he just said, like pedaling a three-speed bicycle and feeling the ease that comes with shifting into a better gear. “[MASK], you know I can respect that, different societies and all, that kind of thing, but it goes both ways, right?
<name>Anthony Bourdain</name>	Anthony Bourdain	Andy	[MASK] said the knives were probably a joke but he wasn’t sure. The knives, set in slots on an orange, simulated tree trunk wooden block, all had large, multicolored plastic handles shaped like different kinds of fish.
<name>Marlboro</name>	Marlboro	Nuke	[MASK] pointed with the cigarette to the line of stones. “So what happened to the dwarfs?” “They all died. They had forgotten how to catch fish and how to open a coconut. The sorcerer had provided for them too much, and after they killed him, they all starved to death.
<name>Nagini</name>	Nagini	Jibukra	How did you destroy them?” “I never even touched them. You did it, you exploded them with your magic. Like you did to this one.” He pokes his toe into the liquified remains of [MASK]. “No . . . really?”
<name>he</name>	he	Kwojenmeto	But to take his soul requires he destroy the ekjab first, and to do so might attract others of his kin whom [MASK] prefers remain as dormant, as powerless, as they have been for such a long and favorable amount a time.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Rujen	[MASK] held his breath as the police truck rolled along not far away. The lone policeman inside looked straight ahead, his white face made green by the low light coming from the dashboard. He drove past and kept going, gone out of sight.
<name>Laertes</name>	Laertes	Jemaluut	At once the woman screamed, and called for the men to rescue [MASK]. When they had dragged him up the beach, she cradled his bleeding body in her lap and pressed cloth into his wounds. “I’m so sorry, so sorry to have brought this on you,” she cried.
<name>Thief</name>	Thief	Kwojenmeto	[MASK] prefers to prey upon the weak, the young, the lost, although at times his masters demand he steal from those, such as the dwarf, who are too keen to lose their souls without a fight.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Etao	A short way past a bend, at a corner spot on the lagoon side of the island, downstream of the trade winds coming from the ocean, [MASK] found a line of five men fishing with poles for mullet.
<name>Darry</name>	Darry	Jebro	His shallow breathing was not near enough to keep him alive much longer. 234 M EIA L A rising warmth pressed at [MASK]’s chest and balled up in his throat, a welling of the love he felt for his brother, the power not to let him die.
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Etao	Let them burn, and get out of the way!” But the people, wailing about sentimental attachments to their old houses, could not see the logic in [MASK]’s words and cursed him when they learned from the boy where the fire had come from.
<name>Barney</name>	Barney	Etao	[MASK], drunk, fell on his butt. “I swear as soon as you get a bite you will change into a rock!” He went from the next man and then to the next, and each time he was told to go away.
<name>Greenpeace</name>	Greenpeace	Rick	“No fight about the dolphins is good. So how much money those guys going to get, how many pounds?” He tried to look friendly, interested, trying to ignore how much the sight of [MASK] holding the basket and its sign continued to really irritate him.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Boyd	He smiled at the bird, no longer his enemy, always having been the free and roaming spirit of his grandfather. VWWW It was [MASK] who first saw two Marshallese instead of only one, pointing out that fact as if it were a vindication of what he had done.
<name>Albus</name>	Albus	Etao	“You can’t leave! I have no ‘some other day,’ only today... and I need your help. Today, [MASK], this afternoon, I will have my last living moment, and then I must die.”
<name>Tonto</name>	Tonto	Etao	Just then the chiefs brother came out from behind his tree and told [MASK] to get away. “Keep your hands off it!” the brother ordered. “I am the one who’s getting that thing.” He took it and put it on his head.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Lazarus	[MASK] looked away from the wall, slowly focusing on the people around him. “Okay,” he said, his word followed by an overly dramatic sigh. “If you really want to hear it, but my story is a sad one.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Nuke	“If you wrap it around your hand you might lose some fingers, and if you keep it tight, then you won’t hook the turtle.” [MASK] took back the rope and fumbled to remove a pack of cigarettes from his backpack. “You have my matches.”
<name>partner</name>	partner	Boyd	and like you said: They looked okay last we saw them. And we’d have gone back, you know, if—” “Forget it, [MASK], just get it in your head: I’m done covering your ass on this one.
<name>Cheryl</name>	Cheryl	Nuke	[MASK] had a small one-strap backpack. Each held a one-gallon jug of water. Around them, red morning light caught lingering smoke from the dump and the air seemed charmed with a magic pastel glow.
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Boyd	The boat roared off in the direction of the frigate bird, and with almost a following sea [MASK] took the swells at an angle, zigzagging to keep up a good speed and a fairly smooth ride. He’d throttle back now and then, timing his path through the swells.
<name>Jorg</name>	Jorg	Kwojenmeto	[MASK] has no taste for blood, no great skill at killing, and for these occasions he brings fylonajapep, the halfwitted abomination whose lust for carnage is just as valuable as his tall, rat-like ears, with which he can track from great distances any living thing by the signature beating of its heart.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Caleb	Stubby black hairs grew at different lengths there, and some small scabby sores were dusted white with powder, making [MASK]’s scalp look scorched and bomb-blasted like a scene from a black-and-white war movie.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Keju	“Yeah, church, I better have this wrapped up by then. Take it easy, [MASK].” He wiped his sunglasses with the bottom of his shirt, then rose and turned to walk toward a group of people by the edge of the pond.
<name>Uncle Jack</name>	Uncle Jack	Rujen	“It chewed through the peas.” “And it pooped all over!” They giggled again, their red-and-white plastic bobbers rattling against their poles, their squirming leaving a yellowish splotch of chum on each leg of [MASK]’s slacks.
<name>the fisherman</name>	the fisherman	Boyd	By the time [MASK] got the boat turned around, having to make a wide semicircle to keep the lines from tangling, the birds were nearing the Marshallese skiff, which still maintained a good speed heading away from them.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Travis	“I know, [MASK]. Shit. I’m sorry. I said I was sorry and we can’t do nothing to change what happened, but listen—” They all seemed to hear it at once, the thrumming beat of a helicopter.
<name>Ignatius</name>	Ignatius	Etao	Dig out the oven and see what good things you find inside.” A loud bratting blast flapped the back of [MASK]’s loin cloth and a rank reek invisibly but palpably fogbound the area. “See,” he said, “no way can I be a ghost.”
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Etao	“But I’m all out too,” [MASK] said to the panting chief, whose once tight, fat belly now hung in numerous flabby layers like many hungry smiles. “All I bring is myself.” “Then maybe we eat you," the chief said.
<name>Prospero</name>	Prospero	Noniep	He leans over [MASK], his brow furrowed by a look of exaggerated curiosity. “What happened to your face?” “I am old, you fool, as old as anything on this island. What did you expect after so much time?”
<name>Elvis</name>	Elvis	Rujen	He moved the mop to his left and supported his weight on it, leaning at such an angle that he looked as though he might fall over. If somebody kicked the mop he would certainly fall over. “So I guess I’m going now ... to church,” [MASK] said.
<name>the man</name>	the man	Travis	My father, he says—maybe they’ll take my job for coming here. I cannot....” “I understand,” [MASK] said. He smiled at him. “Just say any name, make one up.
<name>Sonny</name>	Sonny	Jebro	“You are a crazy brother,” he said. “Are you sure you know how to catch turtles?” [MASK] coughed up another burst of smoke and flicked his cigarette into the water. He thumped his bare chest and said, “I am the best.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Rujen	A square black purse hung from her shoulder. [MASK] stopped at the bicycle, but pulled his hand away just as he reached for it. He stood there smiling, sweating a little, and noticed that he had smeared blue crayon on the stomach of his overalls.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Nuke	He waved his arms and whistled to clear a path, then flexed his muscles in an exaggerated pose for [MASK]’s admiration before he ran, laughing, and dived off the pier. He broke the water fingers first and swam quickly, dolphin style, just above the dead coral bottom.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Rujen	“I can make it to the log,” [MASK] said. He headed slowly in that direction. The fat, sunbleached log was less than a minute’s walk from the house, and had drifted onto the island years earlier.
<name>Mark Twain</name>	Mark Twain	Jebro	[MASK] laughed. “I heard that too, a true story, but that’s a different kind of wudeakeak, because those men living up there have no women—not even one woman lives on that island.”
<name>Jerry</name>	Jerry	Rujen	[MASK] saw that he was misunderstood and laughed. “You don’t hit dolphins with the rocks, you hit rocks like this, under- water.” He knocked his fists together. “It makes them dizzy— you know how they see by sonar.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Rujen	Through the veil of perfume [MASK] could hardly detect the chum stench on his hands and pants, and maybe she could not either. It was probably on her hand now though, and later, when she smelled it, she would probably remember where she had picked it up.
<name>Older</name>	Older	Loeak	The other three men drowned out here.” “Those men drowned because they hung onto to their fish-box and didn’t swim. If you do that you get cold and then you drown. So swim, like [MASK] did.”
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Jebro	[MASK] had lost what his father was talking about, watching a gang of boys pass quietly behind the log. “You remembered what?” “My maps. One night I found my maps in an outhouse, in the toilet pit and nailed to the wall for wiping paper.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Nuke	“What?” “I saw a turtle come up for air. He was far, but headed this way.” [MASK] stood and held the rope with both hands, the short cigarette clenched between his teeth.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Rujen	The bench was low, and the doorknobs across the hall were low too. The rooms had no windows, just block walls painted tan, and dark brown doors with numbers on black plaques at the top. [MASK] sat across from Room 6.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Travis	“It’s a gas can,” [MASK] said. “See it?” Once he found it with the binoculars he could see it from time to time with his naked eyes. “Over there.” He pointed.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Jemaluut	When they got near the woman, [MASK] began his leaping and twirling, but, instead of applauding, the woman jumped up and down and pointed her finger and shouted for men to come quickly with their spears. “Throw! Throw!” she screamed.
<name>Captain</name>	Captain	Boyd	[MASK] called for somebody to man the bow. The flimsy wooden pier was just a few feet away. It was about twenty feet long, maybe three feet wide, and looked to be made of wood scavenged from crates and pallets. It probably had to be rebuilt after every minor storm.
<name>Nuuuuke</name>	Nuuuuke	Jebro	He put his hands on his hips and stared at the tree as if waiting for something to happen. “Did you hear that?” [MASK] asked. “What?” “I heard the tree say, ‘Nuuuuke, come closer.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Etao	“I tried, but...” “But he got drunk instead,” [MASK] says. “And with a little more time I’m sure I can make him forget all the nonsense you filled him with.”
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Alfred	“Okay,” he said, his word followed by an overly dramatic sigh. “If you really want to hear it, but my story is a sad one.” He took a moment to look seriously at each member of his audience, then his eyes settled on [MASK].
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Hansen	after a while here comes his two Marshallese bringin’ back the truck, cornin’ back all wet and gettin’ [MASK]’s seat wet too, and they say to him— get this—‘It’s okay, we were just fishing!' ”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Cronin	“Have you seen him?” “[MASK]? Nah, haven’t seen him—probably out on a boat, working. Wife’s here though, I think. ... So hey, let me tell you what—” “Then who . . . ?”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Boyd	He smiled. “And I’m sorry, really—I know that probably doesn’t mean much, but...” “Maybe you’re okay, not like him.” He gestured with his head toward [MASK]. “No, I’m not like him.”
<name>he</name>	he	Rujen	Bending the bicycle upright straightened the rim some, but the spokes had come loose and a few of them had popped out. Despite being wholly aware of the futility of what he was about to do, [MASK] still got on his bicycle and tried to ride away.
<name>Isaac</name>	Isaac	Jebro	lie Scream By the back of the cemetery [MASK] tended a driftwood fire, glancing from time to time at his father, who slowly bandaged his wounds while sitting on a bucket outside the washroom. The power was still out.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Rujen	[MASK] thought for a moment that soaking his feet in the pond might help them feel better, but the dark water and the pond’s gurgling filter reminded him of an RBC tank. He decided it was not a good place to put his open wounds.
<name>him</name>	him	Travis	The guy stared at [MASK] for a few seconds, as if he was trying to figure him out. “What difference it make? I—I need to get inside your boat.” His voice was shaking, as was the rest of him.
<name>Marcel</name>	Marcel	Jebro	There, pennywort creepers and purple morning glories wove their way into an expansive barrier of salt-resistant kdqqat shrubs, their thick fleshy leaves poking through a tangled mat of hairlike, bright orange kaonon vines. [MASK] tilted the engine and jumped into the shallow surf.
<name>he</name>	he	Rujen	He hoped she would see his correct name on his badge. She was tall for a woman, and when [MASK] got on his knee she was looking down at him, into his eyes and not at his badge.
<name>Alfred</name>	Alfred	Jebro	“I’m sure that has something to do with it, but I think there’s more.” [MASK] looked at the water, and then he looked down at the rope. “Many Marshallese boys’ lives are full of boredom, full of nothing but nothing.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Nuke	This was the kind of fishing he liked—a strategic hunt for schools of big, fast-running fish. “Keep looking for birds,” he said to [MASK], who sat absendy flicking his line into the side of the boat.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jemaluut	Life is best when anything can happen!” But [MASK] would not listen and, giving up his pursuit of the shell, he moved to the far side of the canoe and would not open his eyes except to look out at the water.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Travis	A tangled array of power lines draped over the island like cobwebs, many more poles holding up power lines than there were trees. There was no grass or even any soil. Overall the island smelled strongly like something sour burning, maybe like burning rotten fruit, and [MASK] could smell shit.
<name>Nnedi</name> (possible answer: Nnedi Okorafor, the author of the book "Binti" which contains this passage)	Nnedi (possible answer: Nnedi Okorafor, the author of the book "Binti" which contains this passage)	Grandfadier	“It happens, you know, peoples’ ghosts living inside things— ekjabs, that’s what you call them. [MASK] warned me once about an ekjab here, a bush that used to be a mejenkwaad, a baby-eating vampire.”
<name>Hagfish</name>	Hagfish	Lowat	She gratifies herself with the stiff and bloated body of a long dead eel, pausing now and then to expel a gurgling sigh as she gives birth to hoards of flies. [MASK], his spiny limbless body lying in a milky puddle, swelling then deflating like a pufferfish.
<name>The man</name>	The man	Jebro	“Good thing!” [MASK] looked back up into the sky, squinting. Because of the light overhead he could not see the stars, only three flaming streaks of light, warheads leaving trails, headed for the heart of the lagoon. That woman kept on screaming.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Jebro	He was born with six fingers on his left hand—a long extra pinkie without the nail. It had no strength, but [MASK] boasted he could bring fish by wiggling it in the water. He called it his magic finger.
<name>Someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Nuke	The ocean would become calmer when they neared the islands up west. He would smell them too. He knew the night would have no moon. [MASK]’s float was losing air, becoming flatter more on the left than on the right.
<name>Prospero</name>	Prospero	Etao	Go now, selfish one, before I decide that I gave you too much.” The witch used a flipper to throw dirt into [MASK]’s eyes, and when he rubbed them clear he found himself sitting on the beach where he had arrived on the island.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Travis	[MASK] didn’t think they would have turned around and gone back north. . . . Then again, they had come from that direction. He looked once more with the binoculars, sweeping from just west of north to where the reef bowed inward to the east.
<name>Willie</name>	Willie	Rujen	NAA/WW [MASK] knew he ought to be getting straight to work, and he knew that stealing on Good Friday was an act he would have to embarrassingly confess at church, but he pedaled on as if in the back of his mind he knew his effort were propelling him toward some necessary reward.
<name>Inigo</name>	Inigo	Jebro	[MASK] cut the papaya into quarters and used three fingers of his six-fingered hand to scoop out the black mass of seeds. He tossed the seeds and the pulp into the surf, then threaded the hook through one of the quarters so that the barb poked out.
<name>Casey</name>	Casey	Travis	Over.” [MASK] stopped an inch short of slamming the mike on top of the console. “I can’t believe this idiot, like he’s taking an order for burgers or something.” He took a deep breath and brought the mike to his mouth.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Etao	And the people, pointing to the oven and smiling and making their own scooping moves with their hands, made it known that food was going to be ready very soon. “Give me some help,” [MASK] called, beginning to dig out the oven.
<name>Aragorn</name>	Aragorn	bioniep	Only now, [MASK] feels the full weight of the responsibility he must bear, and to prepare himself he wishes with his last living moments to fill his being with peace and the power it brings, to enjoy the simple pleasure of a meal and the company of a friend.
<name>Maui</name>	Maui	Jebro	He said he would provide for the dwarfs, give them fish, make breadfruit and coconut fall from the sky already cooked. He did all that and the dwarfs had no excuse for not building the city.” [MASK] pointed to the large black stones.
<name>Marshallese</name>	Marshallese	Rick	It seemed strange that [MASK] would even ask him to, being a Marshallese, the kind of person he wanted to save the dolphins from. “No,” he said, not too harshly. “I’m sorry, I cannot—I don’t want to be responsible for all that money.”
<name>Casey</name>	Casey	Jebro	A dim light leaked out of cracks in the tin wall of the power plant. [MASK] tied a rock to the swivel and let it fly, the line leaving the smooth end of the can so fast it sounded like a moth at his ear flapping its wings.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Rujen	And fifty more bucks for this. Here.” He handed [MASK] the ticket. “Lucky for you a water taxi’s gonna be here in about half an hour, cornin’ for that crew worked late on some concrete pour. Go ahead, then.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Boyd	“Damn.” [MASK] reached over and tested the limp line. “What’d you do?” “You tied the knot.” “Bullshit! Bring in the end.” “You bring it in.”
<name>Piggy</name>	Piggy	Oly	You pig." He spoke the last two words softly, not quite prepared to say them until they were already out of his mouth. [MASK]’s buttocks-like cheeks flushed red. “Don’t you get smart with me, you freak fuckin’ lunatic!”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	J	He was not sick, just nervous, not altogether there. “Fifty cent,” the boy’s brother said. “Two for dollar. We got two.” “[MASK] caught two, not you.”
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Noniep	“Em sure you never ate like this before!” [MASK] frowns at the feast in front of him. “I already prepared some food, real food, not this ...” “No better food exists in all the world!”
<name>mechanic</name>	mechanic	Rujen	If needed, he could also remove the headers and flush the orifices, replace the seals and bearings, and even help measure oxygen demand. It was a job that not only required [MASK] to sometimes do hard sweating labor, but also a good deal of thinking.
<name>John</name>	John	Rujen	[MASK] smiled, nodded hello, and then two more riders whizzed past and turned right just in front of him, their tires sliding when they left the asphalt onto a wide patch of sand and gravel that led to the Small Boat Marina.
<name>Yamaha</name>	Yamaha	Ebeye	The marina keeps the engines for parts. We’ll have to look around, maybe order one if we have to, ’cause people kinda hang on to their engines. How about [MASK], any decent engines people might sell?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Rujen	After [MASK] dumped a bucket of saltwater into his toilet, smelling as it did because it was connected straight to the iron main rusting to pieces just a couple feet below, he found a few moments later that sewage had bubbled up into his concrete kitchen sink.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Nuke	“Did you hear that?” he asked. “I think I hit a bird, or a ... I heard something.” “You heard me fart.” [MASK] covered his nose and mouth with the bottom of his shirt.
