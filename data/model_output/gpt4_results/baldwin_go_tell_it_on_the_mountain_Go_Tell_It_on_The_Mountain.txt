<name>Byron</name>	Byron	Satan	His father had always said that his face was the face of [MASK]—and was there not something—in the lift of the eyebrow, in the way his rough hair formed a V on his brow—that bore witness to his father’s words?
<name>God</name>	God	Elisha	The joy of the Lord is the strength of His people. Where joy was, there strength followed; where strength was, sorrow Lame—forever? Forever and forever, said the arm of [MASK], heavy on his shoulder.
<name>John</name>	John	Elisha	“He got as many faces,” [MASK] said, “as you going to see between now and the time you lay your burden down. And he got a lot more than that, but ain’t nobody seen them all.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Elizabeth	“I ain’t seen him,” she said, musingly, “for more than twenty years.” “Then it’ll be a great day,” [MASK] smiled, “when you two meet again.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Sarah	Then he felt weary; if something had really happened it would be very unpleasant upstairs now, and he did not want to face it. But perhaps it was simply that his mother had a headache and had sent [MASK] to the store for some aspirin.
<name>Denver</name>	Denver	Roy	“Wasn’t his fault, then. Wasn’t because he wasn’t trying to feed you. That man shoveled snow in zero weather when he ought’ve been in bed just to put food in your belly.” “Wasn’t just my belly,” said [MASK] indignantly.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Florence	Yet, in [MASK]’s heart tonight hatred and bitterness weighed like granite, pride refused to ab- dicate from the throne it had held so long. Neither love nor humility had led her to the altar, but only fear.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	John	His father was saying, as [MASK] came back into the room: “I’m sure going to be having some questions to ask you in a minute, old lady. I’m going to be wanting to know just how come you let this boy go out and get half killed.”
<name>Sonny</name>	Sonny	Richard	Then he looked at her again, and smiled and kissed her, and he said: “That’s how I got to know so much, baby.” She asked: “And what you going to do, [MASK]? What you want to be?”
<name>Emmeline</name>	Emmeline	Florence	that wants to cut down my soul.” Then his tears came down again, like a wall between him and his father. His Aunt [MASK] came and took him in her arms. Her eyes were dry, and her face was old in the savage, morning light.
<name>Salome</name>	Salome	Esther	I ain’t the first man been made to fall on account of a wicked woman.” “You be careful,” said [MASK], “how you talk to me. I ain’t the first girl’s been ruined by a holy man, neither.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Elizabeth	[MASK] thought that she must once have been very rich, and had lost her money; and she felt for her, as one fallen woman for another, a certain kinship. A cup of coffee together, as day was breaking, became in time their habit.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	John	[MASK] knew he did not dare, not today, and he heard his father’s laugh: “No, nor tomorrow neither!” For him there was the back door, and the dark stairs, and the kitchen or the basement. This world was not for him.
<name>Lucifer</name>	Lucifer	John	Hell, everlasting, unceasing, perpetual, unquenched forever, should be his father’s portion; with [MASK] there to watch, to linger, to smile, to laugh aloud, hearing, at last, his father’s cries of torment.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Elizabeth	Her aunt, who listened to this with no diminution of her habitual scorn, was yet unable to deny that from generation to generation, things, as she grudgingly put it, were bound to change—and neither could she quite take the position of seeming to stand in [MASK]’s way.
<name>Wilbur</name>	Wilbur	John	He had [MASK]’s entire sympathy, for the longest and hardest part of his Saturday mornings was his voyage with the broom across this endless rug; and, coming to the French doors that ended the living-room and stopped the rug, he felt like an indescribably weary traveler who sees his home at last.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	John	Here there was no speech or language, and there was no love; no one to say: You are beautiful, [MASK]; no one to forgive him, no matter what his sin; no one to heal him, and lift him up.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Florence	“Does you really believe that?” She forced herself to look up at him, and felt at that moment the intensity of the attention that [MASK] fixed on her, as though she were trying to shout a warning.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	John	Rarely did he bring the message on a Sunday morning; only if there was no one else to speak was his father called upon. He was a kind of fill-in speaker, a holy handyman. Yet he was treated, so far as [MASK] could see, with great respect.
<name>Deirdre</name>	Deirdre	John	There was muted singing all around her; yet she waited. Before her mind’s eyes wavered, in a light like the light from a fire, the face of [MASK], whom she had brought so unwillingly into the world.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Florence	Their mother would walk out into the yard and cut a switch from a tree and beat him—beat him, it seemed to [MASK], until any other boy would have fallen down dead; and so often that any other boy would have ceased his wickedness.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Florence	“Girl,” said [MASK], “don’t you say a word about being sorry, or I’ll show you to this door. You pick up that boy and sit down there in that easy chair and pull yourself together.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Elisha	That’s the Man who knows.” They were approaching his house—his father’s house. In a moment he must leave [MASK], step out from under his protecting arm, and walk alone into the house—alone with his mother and his father.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Elizabeth	One of them, the smiler, turned now to the landlady and said: “Let’s have the key to his room. How long’s he been living here?” “About a year,” the landlady said. She looked unhappily at [MASK].
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Richard	At the station [MASK] gave his name and address and age and occupation. Then for the first time he stated that he was not involved, and asked one of the other boys to corroborate his testimony. This they rather despairingly did.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	John	Under this dark Weight the walls leaned, under it the ceiling, with a great crack like lightning in its center, sagged. The windows gleamed like beaten gold or silver, but now [MASK] saw, in the yellow light, how fine dust veiled their doubtful glory.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	John	She wondered if [MASK] were still on his knees, or had risen, with a child’s impatience, and was staring around the church. There was a stiffness in him that would be hard to break, but that, nevertheless, would one day surely be broken.
<name>John</name>	John	John	[MASK] knew that these buildings were not for him—not today—no, nor tomorrow, either! Then, coming up this straight and silent street, he saw a woman, very old and black, coming toward them, staggering on the crooked stones.
<name>Job</name>	Job	Job	“It ain’t my fault,” she said, “that you was born a fool, and al- ways done been a fool, and ain’t never going to change. I swear to my Father you’d try the patience of [MASK].”
<name>Denver</name>	Denver	Elisha	“[MASK],” he said, “no matter what happens to me, where I go, what folks say about me, no matter what anjoody says, you remember—please remember—I was saved. I was there.”
<name>Amos</name>	Amos	Elisha	Only the son of the bondwoman stood where the rightful heir should stand. “I’ll obey, Lord, I’ll obey. ” He felt that he should rise and pray over [MASK]—when a man cried out, it was right that another man should be his intercessor.
<name>Ruby</name>	Ruby	Elizabeth	You got time, honey, so takeyour time.” “I ain’t,” said [MASK], quietly, “got so much time.” She could not stop herself; though something warned her to hold her peace, the words poured out.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Florence	her mother asked sharply. But she knew that her mother had understood, had indeed long before this moment known that this time would come. The astonishment with which she stared at [MASK]’s bag was not altogether astonishment, but a startled, wary attention.
<name>Cholly</name>	Cholly	Johnny	Then, almost unwillingly, he asked: “And . . . would you let him be born again?” She answered, steadily: “I know you ain’t asking me to say I’m sorry I brought [MASK] in the world. Is you?”
<name>George</name>	George	Frank	If she had told him once, she had told him a hundred times: “[MASK], you better take out life insurance.” But he had thought—and wasn’t it just like a man!—that he would live forever.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Frank	And holding him in her arms while, finally, he slept, she thought with the sensations of luxury and power: “But there’s lots of good in [MASK]. I just got to be patient and he’ll come along all right.”
<name>Missie</name>	Missie	Johnny	A hand somewhere struck the gramophone arm and sent the silver needle on its way through the whirling, black grooves, like something bobbing, anchorless, in the middle of the sea. “[MASK]’s done fell asleep,” she said.
<name>Chigurh</name>	Chigurh	John	Then his father turned and looked at him. “Where you been, boy,” he shouted, “all this time? Don’t you know you’s needed here at home?” More than his words, his face caused [MASK] to stiffen instantly with malice and fear.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	John	His father’s arm, rising and falling, might make him cry, and that voice might cause him to tremble; yet his father could never be entirely the victor, for [MASK] cherished something that his father could not reach.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Esther	He felt suddenly like a helpless child. He wanted to hide himself forever and never cease from crying. [MASK] and her mother left during the singing—they had come, then, only to hear him preach. He could not imagine what they were saying or thinking now.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Gabriel	And [MASK], full of the confusion, and pain, and guilt that were his whenever he thought of how he made his mother suffer, but that became nearly insupportable when she taxed him with it, stood before the mirror, head bowed, buttoning his shirt.
<name>Royal</name>	Royal	Esther	You reckon that’s his daddy’s name?” He did not wonder. He had once told [MASK] that if the Lord ever gave him a son he would call him Royal, because the line of the faithful was a royal line—his son would be a royal child.
<name>Essie</name>	Essie	Esther	When he came back to lock up the house, he found [MASK] waiting for him on the porch steps. “I didn’t think I’d better leave,” she said, “till you got back. I ain’t got no keys to lock up this house, and white folks is so funny.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Elisha	Me knew, without knowing how it had happened, that he lay on the floor, in the dusty space before the altar which he and [MASK] had cleaned; and knew that above him burned the yellow light which he had himself switched on.
<name>no</name>	no	Reverend	He left the axe buried in the wood, for splinters flew and he was afraid one might strike her. “You and your ma—you don’t get out to service much?” “Lord, [MASK],” she wailed, “look like we just ain’t got the time.
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Heaven	Standing out, waist-deep and robed in white, was the preacher, who would hold their heads briefly under water, crying out to [MASK] as the baptized held his breath: “I indeed have baptized you with water: but He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Elizabeth	“I ain’t never heard him. When / was home he weren’t doing nothing but chasing after women and lying in the ditches, drunk.” “I hope,” laughed [MASK], “he done changed his ways at least.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Gabriel	She felt [MASK] watching her to see how she would take this question—the question that, for all her determination, she had dreaded most to hear. She looked away from her mother, and straightened, catching her breath, looking outward through the small, cracked window.
<name>God</name>	God	Lord	Oh, [MASK], have mercy on me!” And he fell against the tree, sinking to the ground and clutching the roots of the tree. He had shouted into silence and only silence answered—and yet, when he cried, his cry had caused a ringing to the outermost limits of the earth.
<name>David</name>	David	John	His father raised his hand. The knife came down. [MASK] rolled away, down the white, descending street, screaming: “Father! Father!” These were the first words he uttered. In a moment there was silence, and his father was gone.
<name>Jill</name>	Jill	John	“Yes,” said the voice, “go through. Go through.” “Lift me up,” whispered [MASK], “lift me up. I can’t go through.” “Go through,” said the voice, “go through.”
<name>Sula</name>	Sula	Florence	“You know,” he said, watching her with more attention, “[MASK] ain’t never thought none of these niggers around here was good enough for her.” “I wonder,” she ventured, “if she ever going to find a man good enough for her.
<name>Cal</name>	Cal	Roy	You going to find it out, too, one day. You go on, hardhead. You going to come to grief.” And suddenly [MASK] grinned. “But you be there, won’t you, Ma— when I’m in trouble?”
<name>Essie</name>	Essie	Gabriel	Who is you met, [MASK], all your holy life long, you ain’t made to drink a cup of sorrow? And you doing it still—you going to be doing it till the Lord puts you in your grave.”
<name>John</name>	John	Richard	She wanted to ask him what he was reading, but she did not dare. Yet: “What’s your name?” she abruptly brought out. “[MASK],” he said. “Oh,” she said thoughtfully.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Gabriel	She opened the door; the cold, morning air came in. “Good-bye,” she said. And then to [MASK]; “Tell her I said good-bye.” She walked through the cabin door and down the short steps into the frosty yard.
<name>Jefferson</name>	Jefferson	Gabriel	Now, someone spat on the sidewalk at [MASK]’s feet, and he walked on, his face not changing, and he heard it reprovingly whispered behind him that he was a good nigger, surely up to no trouble.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Gabriel	“Hush,” he said, with a calm that astonished him, “we going to do something, just you be quiet.” “What we going to do, [MASK]? Tell me—what you a-fixing in your mind to do?”
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Roy	“Your father,” she said, watching him, “knows best. You listen to your father, I guarantee you, you won’t end up in no jail.” [MASK] sucked his teeth in fury. “I ain’t looking to go to no jail.
<name>Boy</name>	Boy	cain	Look like you just determined to raise [MASK] any how and make everybody in this house suffer because something done happened to the apple of your eye.” “I done asked you,” cried his father in a fearful exasperation, “to stop running your mouth.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	John	His father’s face was black—like a sad, eternal night; yet in his father’s face there burned a fire-—a fire eternal in an eternal night. [MASK] trembled where he lay, feeling no warmth for him from this fire, trembled, and could not take his eyes away.
<name>Millie</name>	Millie	Sarah	It was true that [MASK] was full of self-importance, and made any errand she ran seem a matter of life or death; nevertheless, she had been sent on an errand, and with such speed that her mother had not had time to make her button up her coat.
<name>Florence</name>	Florence	Deborah	Now, again, he felt drained and sick; he was soaking wet and he smelled the odor of his own body. [MASK], singing and beating her tambourine in the front of the congregation, watched him. He felt suddenly like a helpless child.
<name>Anita</name>	Anita	Richard	And here were the men who had come day and night to visit her father’s “stable”—with their sweet talk and their music, and their violence and their sex—black, brown, and beige, who looked on her with lewd, and lustful, and laughing eyes. And these were [MASK]’s friends.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sarah	He took off his coat, dropping it on a chair, and was about to start into the living-room when he heard [MASK] running up the steps. He waited, and she burst through the door, carrying a clumsy parcel. “What happened?”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	John	That he had been a preacher at that time was not astonishing, for it was impossible to imagine that he had ever been anything else; but that he had had a wife in the so distant past who was now dead filled [MASK] with a wonder by no means pleasant.
<name>Cholly</name>	Cholly	Frank	[MASK] sang the blues, and he drank too much. His skin was the color of caramel candy. Perhaps for this reason she always thought of him as having candy in his mouth, candy staining the edges of his straight, cruel teeth.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Gabriel	“I going to tell you something, [MASK],” she said. “I know you thinking at the bottom of your heart that if you just make her, her and her bastard boy, pay enough for her sin, your son won’t have to pay for yours.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Reverend	“Can you make yourself free to come tonight?” he could not prevent himself from asking. And she grinned, delighted at what she took to be an oblique compliment. “Well, I don’t know, [MASK]. But I’ll try.”
<name>Alonso</name>	Alonso	Elisha	[MASK] had knocked over a pile of camp chairs, folded in the corner, and stood over them angrily, holding the mop in his hand. “I keep telling you not to hide that mop back there. Can’t nobody get at it.”
<name>Alfy</name>	Alfy	Roy	They had gone from cursing to laughter, to anger, to lust. Once he and [MASK] had watched a man and woman in the basement of a condemned house. They did it standing up. The woman had wanted fifty cents, and the man had flashed a razor.
<name>Selina</name>	Selina	Gabriel	Then, [MASK], in a changed and frightened voice, asked: “And when you done decide that?” She did not look at him, nor answer his question. She continued to watch her mother. “I got my ticket,” she repeated.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Roy	Then his father raised his belt, and it fell with a whistling sound on [MASK], who shivered, and fell back, his face to the wall. But he did not cry out. And the belt was raised again, and again.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Elizabeth	“No,” she said, “we ain’t never got along, and I don’t reckon he’s changed.” “Twenty years is a mighty long time,” [MASK] said, “he’s bound to have changed some!'
<name>Pauline</name>	Pauline	Elizabeth	And on Monday morning he was not at work. She left during the lunch hour to go to his room. He was not there. His landlady said that he had not been there all weekend. While [MASK] stood trembling and indecisive in the hall, two white policemen entered.
<name>Yvette</name>	Yvette	Frank	“Let me alone, [MASK]. I want to go to sleep.” “No you don’t. You don’t want to go to sleep so soon. You want me to talk to you a little. You know how your baby loves to talk.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	John	A servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. Then the ironic voice, terrified, it seemed, of no depth, no darkness, demanded of [MASK], scornfully, if he believed that he was cursed.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Deborah	Sometimes [MASK] sat with his mother, watching him with eyes that were no less patient and reproachful. He would escape into the starry night and walk until he came to a tavern, or to a house that he had marked already in the long daytime of his lust.
<name>Francis</name>	Francis	Gabriel	In her face there was nothing but patience, as she turned to him, and said: “I’m praying all the time. But I sure will pray extra hard this week if you want me to.” And it was during this praying time that [MASK] had a dream.
<name>Wilbur</name>	Wilbur	Gabriel	She paused. “And it sound just like [MASK]. He ain’t never thought a minute about nobody in this world but himself.” He said nothing, watching her implacable back. Then: “You going to answer this letter?” “I reckon.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Roy	pressed had she filled all the world with her weeping. His father muttered sweet, delirious things to [MASK], and his hands, when he dipped them again in the basin and wrung out the cloth, were trembling.
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Florence	And would the Lord now reach out His hand to [MASK] and heal and save? But, going down before the scarlet cloth at the foot of the golden cross, it came to her that she had forgotten how to pray.
<name>Destiny</name>	Destiny	Satan	Then, trembling, he got out of bed again and washed himself. It was a warning, and he knew it, and he seemed to see before him the pit dug by [MASK]—deep and silent, waiting for him.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Richard	She knew the moment she saw them, and before they mentioned his name, that something terrible had happened to [MASK]. Her heart, as on that bright summer day when he had first spoken to her, gave a terrible bound and then was still, with an awful, wounded stillness.
<name>Ruth</name>	Ruth	Gabriel	No, I can’t stop him, I done told you that, and you can’t stop him neither. You don’t know what to do with this boy, and that’s why you all the time trying to fix the blame on somebody. Ain’t nobody to blame, [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Elizabeth	It was true that her aunt was always talking of how much she loved her sister’s daughter, and what great sacrifices she had made on her account, and what great care she took to see to it that [MASK] should grow up a good, Christian girl.
<name>Sula</name>	Sula	Gabriel	“But me,” she said, “I got to go.” She walked to the center of the room again, and picked up her bag. “Girl,” [MASK] whispered, “ain’t you got no feelings at a//?”
<name>Lucifer</name>	Lucifer	John	Then the darkness began to murmur—a terrible sound—and [MASK]’s ears trembled. In this murmur that filled the grave, like a thousand wings beating on the air, he recognized a sound that he had always heard.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	John	Time was indifferent, like snow and ice; but the heart, crazed wanderer in the driving waste, carried the curse forever. “[MASK],” said his father, “come with me.” Then they were in a straight street, a narrow, narrow way.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	John	The possibility of being distinguished by her notice did not enter [MASK]’s mind, and so he simply stared at her. Then he realized, by the immobility of the other children and by the way they avoided looking at him, that it was he who was selected for punishment.
<name>John</name>	John	John	Her apron, improvised from an old sheet, was wet where she had been leaning over the scrubbing-board. As he came in, she straightened, drying her hands on the edge of the apron. “You finish your work, [MASK]?” she asked.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Gabriel	Silence filled the room after her “Amen,” and in the silence they heard, far up the road, the sound of a horse’s hoofs. No one moved. [MASK], from his corner near the stove, looked up and watched his mother.
<name>Arty</name>	Arty	Roy	“I been hungry plenty of times,” [MASK] said, proud to be able to score this point against his mother. “Wasn’t his fault, then. Wasn’t because he wasn’t trying to feed you.
<name>Maker</name>	Maker	Saviour	“I know my name is written in the Book of Life,” he said. “I know I’m going to look on my [MASK]’s face in glory.” “Yes,” she said, slowly, “we’s all going to be together there.
<name>James</name>	James	John	But you believe me, boy, you can’t find no greater joy than you find in the service of the Lord.” [MASK] said nothing. He touched a black key on the piano and it made a dull sound, like a distant drum.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	John	That’s the way it’s been with me sometime, and I’m saved. What you think it’s going to be like for you, boy?” He looked at [MASK], who, head down, was putting the chairs in order.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Richard	Reality, so to speak, burst in for the first time on her great dreaming, and she found occasion to wonder, ruefully, what had made her imagine that, once with [MASK], she would have been able to withstand him.
<name>Lucifer</name>	Lucifer	John	I seen it. I ain’t the Devil’s son for nothing.” His father reached for him, but [MASK] was faster. He moved backward down the shining street, looking at his father—his father who moved toward him, one hand outstretched in fury.
<name>Alviry</name>	Alviry	Gabriel	“But, [MASK], if you’d said something even when that poor girl was buried, if you’d wanted to own that poor boy, I wouldn’t nohow of cared what folks said, or where we might of had to go, or nothing.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Elizabeth	“You ain’t never told me,” said [MASK], with a quick and rather false interest, “you had a brother! And he coming up here?” “So he say. Ain’t nothing, I reckon, to keep him down home
