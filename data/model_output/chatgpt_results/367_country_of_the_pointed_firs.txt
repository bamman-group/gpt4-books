<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Almiry	You wanted more scope, didn’t you, [MASK], an’ to live in a large place where more things grew? Sometimes folks wonders that we don’t live together; perhaps we shall some time,” and a shadow of sadness and apprehension flitted across her face.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	William	“He ain’t disposed to be very social with the ladies,” explained [MASK]’s mother, with a delightful glance at me, as if she counted upon my friendship and tolerance. “He’s very particular, and he’s all in his old fishin’-clothes to-day.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Gaffett	[MASK] had worked it out in his own mind that they was all common ghosts, but the conditions were unusual favorable for seeing them. He was always talking about the Ge’graphical Society, but he never took proper steps, as I viewed it now, and stayed right there at the mission.
<name>Lady Crawley</name>	Lady Crawley	Elijah	No; I ain’t one o’ them that likes to set an’ do nothin’.” “You see the rugs, poor dear did them; she wa’n’t very partial to knittin’,” old [MASK] went on, after he had counted his stitches.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Funerals	“I expect he got tellin’ of you some o’ his great narratives,” she answered, looking at me shrewdly. “[MASK] always sets him goin’. Some o’ them tales hangs together toler’ble well,” she added, with a sharper look than before.
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	XIV	[MASK]. The Hermitage MY COMPANION and I had been so intent upon the subject of the conversation that we had not heard any one open the gate, but at this moment, above the noise of the rain, we heard a loud knocking.
<name>Ezekiel</name>	Ezekiel	William	“[MASK] has been son an’ daughter both since you was married off the island. He’s been ‘most too satisfied to stop at home ‘long o’ his old mother, but I always tell ‘em I’m the gainer.”
<name>Balthazar</name>	Balthazar	Nathan	We were just waiting for the feast to begin. “You wouldn’t think such a great creatur’ ‘s I be could feel all over pins an’ needles. I remember, the day I promised to [MASK], how it come over me, just’s
<name>words</name>	words	Gaffett	“Did they get to the town?” “They did,” said the captain, “and found inhabitants; ‘twas an awful condition of things. It appeared, as near as [MASK] could express it, like a place where there was neither living nor dead.
<name>Ethan</name>	Ethan	Nathan	I always liked [MASK], and he never knew. But this pennyr’yal always reminded me, as I’d sit and gather it and hear him talkin’--it always would remind me of--the other one.” She looked away from me, and presently rose and went on by herself.
<name>mother</name>	mother	William	That’s me,” she added, opening another worn case, and displaying the full face of the cheerful child she looked like still in spite of being past sixty. “And here’s [MASK] an’ father together.
<name>Stonewall Jackson</name>	Stonewall Jackson	Santin	I sometimes think that [MASK]’s ability has come ‘way down from then. ‘Tain’t nothin’ he’s ever acquired; ‘twas born in him. I don’t know’s he ever saw a fine parade, or met with those that studied up such things.
<name>Almiry</name>	Almiry	Providence	I’m glad you find it pleasant; I wish you’d come an’ stay, dear, whenever you feel inclined. But here’s Almiry; I always think [MASK] was kind to plot an’ have her husband leave her a good house where she really belonged.
<name>Zeena</name>	Zeena	Joanna’d	Yes, she desired him to come for the sheep; an’ his wife thought perhaps [MASK] return, but he said no, an’ lo’ded the bo’t with warm things an’ what he thought she’d need through the winter.
<name>Long John Silver</name>	Long John Silver	Elijah	They don’t trouble me no more’n if they wa’n’t there.” “You haven’t been to sea for nothing,” I said laughing. “One trade helps another,” said [MASK] with an amiable smile. “Come right in an’ set down.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Nathan	and I told her where it come from, her face did really light up for a minute, sort of bright an’ pleasant. ‘[MASK] an’ I was always good friends; I’m glad he don’t think hard of me,’ says she.
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Nathan	I do try to remember that she’s [MASK]’s cousin. Oh dear, well; she’s gone by after all, an’ ain’t seen me. I expected she’d come pleasantin’ round just to show off an’ say afterwards she was acquainted.”
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Joanna	I couldn’t keep the tears out o’ my eyes, I felt so sad. I said to myself, I must get mother to come over an’ see [MASK]; the love in mother’s heart would warm her, an’ she might be able to advise.”
<name>Alexander</name>	Alexander	Joanna	I found myself presently among some unfamiliar islands, and suddenly remembered the story of poor [MASK]. There is something in the fact of a hermitage that cannot fail to touch the imagination; the recluses are a sad kindred, but they are never commonplace.
<name>Nancy</name>	Nancy	Almiry	“That’s the one, [MASK],” said her mother. “She always had a likely look to me, an’ she’s right after business. I never see such a mouser for one of her age.
<name>Cap'n Warren</name>	Cap'n Warren	William	“That’s just what I was wantin’,” said the hostess. “I give a sigh when you spoke o’ chowder, knowin’ my onions was out. [MASK] forgot to replenish us last time he was to the Landin’.
<name>Jerry</name>	Jerry	Almiry	“Hadn’t you better urge the horse a little, [MASK]?” she asked. “He’s had it easy as we came along, and he can rest when we get there. The others are some little ways ahead, and I don’t want to lose a minute.”
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Almiry	“Nor me neither,” said the old fisherman. “Nobody likes ‘em, say what they may. Poor dear was disobliged by the mere sight of a bo’t. [MASK]’s got the best o’ mothers, I expect you know;
<name>Abby</name>	Abby	Joanna	“We were all settin’ down very proper, but [MASK] would keep stealin’ glances at me as if she was glad I come. She had but little to say; she was real polite an’ gentle, and yet forbiddin’.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	William	“He’s very particular, and he’s all in his old fishin’-clothes to-day. He’ll want me to tell him everything you said and done, after you’ve gone. [MASK] has very deep affections.
<name>Captain Corcoran</name>	Captain Corcoran	Almiry’ll	You’d better content yourselves till you get nice an’ rested, an’ ‘long after dinner the sea-breeze ‘ll spring up, an’ then you can take your walks, an’ go up an’ see the prospect from the big ledge. [MASK] want to show off everything there is.
<name>Old Man</name>	Old Man	Lijah	“Been visitin’ with ‘[MASK]?” she asked with interest. “I expect you had kind of a dull session; he ain’t the talkin’ kind; dwellin’ so much long o’ fish seems to make ‘em lose the gift o’ speech.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	for’ard	There was a crooked channel of deep water which led close up against the shore. “There, you hold fast [MASK] there, an’ wait for her to lift on the wave. You’ll make a good landin’ if you’re smart; right on the port-hand side!”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Gaffett	They would make as if they talked together, but there was no sound of voices, and ‘they acted as if they didn’t see us, but only felt us coming towards them,’ says [MASK] one day, trying to tell the particulars.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Joanna	“You needn’t make no haste,” he called to me; “I’ll keep within call. [MASK] lays right up there in the far corner o’ the field. There used to be a path led to the place. I always knew her well.
<name>Captain Jim</name>	Captain Jim	Elijah	“I used to laugh at her, poor dear,” said [MASK], as if he read my thought. “I used to make light of her timid notions. She used to be fearful when I was out in bad weather or baffled about gittin’ ashore.
<name>Davy</name>	Davy	William	“Yes, they’ll all make everything of mother; she’ll have a lovely time to-day. I wouldn’t have had her miss it, and there won’t be a thing she’ll ever regret, except to mourn because [MASK] wa’n’t here.”
<name>fish</name>	fish	Almiry	Poor dear, she always thought a sight o’ [MASK], and she used to remind me there was nobody to fish for her; but I don’t rec’lect it as I ought to. I see you drop a line yourself very handy now an’ then.”
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	William	He asked politely if I would like to go up to the great ledge while dinner was getting ready; so, not without a deep sense of pleasure, and a delighted look of surprise from the two hostesses, we started, [MASK] and I, as if both of us felt much younger than we looked.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Sam	That’s what [MASK] prospers on now, if you can call it prosperin’. Yes, I might have known. ‘Tis the 15th o’ August with him, an’ he gener’ly stops to dinner with a cousin’s widow on the way home.
<name>Old Man</name>	Old Man	William	“I know all of his burrows down ‘long the shore. I’ll catch him by hand ‘fore he knows it. I’ve got some business with [MASK], anyway. I brought forty-two cents with me that was due him for them last lobsters he brought in.”
<name>her</name>	her	Lynn	She’d just been out to see the monument the week before she was taken down, and admired it so much that they felt sure of her wishes.” “So she’s really gone, and the funeral was up to [MASK]!”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	William	The hot sun brought out the fragrance of the pitchy bark, and the shade was pleasant as we climbed the hill. [MASK] stopped once or twice to show me a great wasps’-nest close by, or some fishhawks’-nests below in a bit of swamp.
<name>the lighthouse keeper</name>	the lighthouse keeper	Joanna	I drank at the spring, and thought that now and then some one would follow me from the busy, hard-worked, and simple-thoughted countryside of the mainland, which lay dim and dreamlike in the August haze, as [MASK] must have watched it many a day.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Edward	He come home with the sheep an’ left the other things by the house, but she never so much as looked out o’ the window. She done it for a penance. She must have wanted to see [MASK] by that time.”
<name>Silas</name>	Silas	William	He was always odd about seein’ folks, just’s he is now. I run to meet ‘em from a child, an’ [MASK], he’d take an’ run away.” “I’ve been the gainer,” said the old mother cheerfully.
<name>traveller</name>	traveller	Bowden	We were among the very last to return to our proper lives and lodgings. I came near to feeling like a true [MASK], and parted from certain new friends as if they were old friends; we were rich with the treasure of a new remembrance.
<name>me</name>	me	William	“I want you to come again. It has been so pleasant for [MASK].” The wind served us all the way home, and did not fall or let the sail slacken until we were close to the shore.
<name>Little Em'ly</name>	Little Em'ly	Nathan	I could, that I’d got to have an own cousin o’ his for my near relation all the rest o’ my life, an’ it seemed as if die I should. Poor [MASK] saw somethin’ had crossed me,--he had very nice feelings,--and when he asked what ‘twas, I told him.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	William’ll	[MASK] be in again for me to-morrow, so I can come back here an’ rest me over night, an’ go to meetin’ to-morrow, and have a nice, good visit.”
<name>winter</name>	winter	January	“No; I take stiddy to my knitting after [MASK] sets in,” said the old seafarer. “‘Tain’t worth while, fish make off into deeper water an’ you can’t stand no such perishin’ for the sake o’ what you get.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Conversation	I see so many of these new folks nowadays, that seem to have neither past nor future. [MASK]’s got to have some root in the past, or else you’ve got to explain every remark you make, an’ it wears a person out.”
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Joanna	The Black Island folks could see her with their spy-glass, and if they’d ever missed getting some sign o’ life they’d have sent notice to her folks. But after the first year or two [MASK] was more and more forgotten as an every-day charge.
<name>Isadora</name>	Isadora	Society	The best room was too suggestive of serious occasions, and the shades were all pulled down to shut out the summer light and air. It was indeed a tribute to [MASK] to find a room set apart for her behests out there on so apparently neighborless and remote an island.
<name>mate</name>	mate	Almiry	I liked the variety. There, how times have changed; how few seafarin’ families there are left! What a lot o’ queer folks there used to be about here, anyway, when we was young, [MASK].
<name>Amundsen</name>	Amundsen	Gaffett	“[MASK] thought the officers were hurrying home to report and to fit out a new expedition when they were all lost. At the time, the men got orders not to talk over what they had seen,” the old man explained presently in a more natural tone.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	William	“I done it all myself with [MASK]’s help. He had a spare day, an’ took right holt with me; an’ ‘twas all well beat on the grass, an’ turned, an’ put down again afore we went to bed.
<name>me</name>	me	us,--Mrs	I waited to see if she would say any more, and then took a roundabout way back to the subject by saying what was first in my mind: that I wished the Green Island family were there to spend the evening with [MASK].
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Almiry	“Oh, what a poor, plain garden! Hardly a flower in it except your bush o’ balm!” she said. “But you do keep your garden neat, [MASK]. Are you both well, an’ goin’ up country with me?”
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Land	Life ain’t spoilt her a mite. She’s eighty-six an’ I’m sixty-seven, and I’ve seen the time I’ve felt a good sight the oldest. ‘[MASK] sakes alive!’ says she, last time I was out to see her.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Gaffett	And when they’d got the boat out o’ reach o’ danger, [MASK] said they looked back, and there was the town again, standing up just as they’d seen it first, comin’ on the coast.
<name>Fred</name>	Fred	William	Then followed a most charming surprise. [MASK] mastered his timidity and began to sing. His voice was a little faint and frail, like the family daguerreotypes, but it was a tenor voice, and perfectly true and sweet.
<name>She</name>	She	Nathan	‘Tis very strange about love. No, [MASK] never found out, but my heart was troubled when I knew him first. There’s more women likes to be loved than there is of those that loves. I spent some happy hours right here.
<name>Miranda</name>	Miranda	Joanna	“[MASK] had done one thing very pretty. There was a little piece o’ swamp on the island where good rushes grew plenty, and she’d gathered ‘em, and braided some beautiful mats for the floor and a thick cushion for the long bunk.
<name>Ida</name>	Ida	Joanna	You can always live well in any wild place by the sea when you’d starve to death up country, except ‘twas berry time. [MASK] had berries out there, blackberries at least, and there was a few herbs in case she needed them.
<name>Walt</name>	Walt	XX	[MASK]. Along Shore ONE DAY as I went along the shore beyond the old wharves and the newer, high-stepped fabric of the steamer landing, I saw that all the boats were beached, and the slack water period of the early afternoon prevailed.
<name>Colonel</name>	Colonel	Sant	[MASK], he couldn’t do nothin’ with ‘em. All he thinks of, when he sees a crowd, is how to march ‘em. ‘Tis all very well when he don’t ‘tempt too much. He never did act like other folks.”
<name>Miss Rachel</name>	Miss Rachel	Joanna	There was a little smoke out o’ the chimney o’ [MASK]’s house, and it did look sort of homelike and pleasant with wild mornin’-glory vines trained up; an’ there was a plot o’ flowers under the front window, portulacas and things.
<name>Antigone</name>	Antigone	Antigone	She looked away from me, and presently rose and went on by herself. There was something lonely and solitary about her great determined shape. She might have been [MASK] alone on the Theban plain. It is not often given in a noisy world to come to the places of great grief and silence.
<name>Cassie</name>	Cassie	Susan	“I picked her the balm, an’ we started. Why, yes, [MASK], the minister liked to have cost me my life that day. He would fasten the sheet, though I advised against it. He said the rope was rough an’ cut his hand.
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	Nathan,--he	‘You give my love to [MASK]’s a dear good man,’ she said; ‘an’ tell your mother, if I should be sick she mustn’t wish I could get well, but I want her to be the one to come.’
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Almiry	‘I haven’t got no right to live with folks no more,’ she said. ‘You must never ask me again, [MASK]: I’ve done the only thing I could do, and I’ve made my choice.
<name>Pap</name>	Pap	John	She didn’t have nothing aboard, of her own, that she wanted to cut up for me, so when my dress wore out she just put me into a spare suit o’ [MASK]’s, jacket and trousers.
<name>Marmee</name>	Marmee	William	“You just sit right down an’ have a cup of tea and rest you while we make our preparations. Oh, I am so gratified to think you’ve come! Yes, she was just havin’ her breakfast, and we were speakin’ of you. Where’s [MASK]?”
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Lord	what a supper she’d git, an’ be right there watchin’ from the door, with somethin’ over her head if ‘twas cold, waitin’ to hear all about it as I come up the field. [MASK], how I think o’ all them little things!”
<name>his wife</name>	his wife	Joanna	He hadn’t been very long in the place when [MASK] left home and friends. ‘Twas one day that next summer after she went, and I had been married early in the spring. He felt that he ought to go out and visit her.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	William	“Got round to comin’ in, didn’t you?” she inquired, with amusement. “Well, now, that’s clever. Didn’t know’s I should see you to-day, [MASK], an’ I wanted to settle an account.”
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Joanna	I can’t bear to leave you here’--and I burst right out crying. I’d had my own trials, young as I was, an’ she knew it. Oh, I did entreat her; yes, I entreated [MASK].” “What did she say then?”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Joanna	I knew, as if she had told me, that poor [MASK] must have heard the like on many and many a summer afternoon, and must have welcomed the good cheer in spite of hopelessness and winter weather, and all the sorrow and disappointment in the world.
<name>Pocahontas</name>	Pocahontas	Joanna	I remember sailin’ by one spring afternoon, an’ seein’ the coops out front o’ the house in the sun. How long was it before you went out with the minister? You were the first ones that ever really got ashore to see [MASK].”
<name>Mr. Oakhurst</name>	Mr. Oakhurst	William	I turned, startled in the silence of the wide field, and saw an elderly man, bent in the shoulders as fishermen often are, gray-headed and clean-shaven, and with a timid air. It was [MASK].
<name>Death</name>	Death	Death	It had also affected the old fishermen’s hard complexions, until one fancied that when [MASK] claimed them it could only be with the aid, not of any slender modern dart, but the good serviceable harpoon of a seventeenth century woodcut.
<name>Kezia</name>	Kezia	VI	It sounded like the strange warning wave that gives notice of the turn of the tide. A late golden robin, with the most joyful and eager of voices, was singing close by in a thicket of wild roses. [MASK].
<name>Emmeline</name>	Emmeline	Nathan	I couldn’t speak; no, there wa’n’t anything I could say, she seemed so above everything common. I was a good deal younger then than I be now, and I got [MASK]’s little coral pin out o’ my pocket and put it into her hand; and when she saw it
<name>Matthew</name>	Matthew	William	“I did look for her last night, and I couldn’t keep back the tears when the dark really fell and she wa’n’t here, she does so enjoy a great occasion. If [MASK] had a mite o’ snap an’ ambition, he’d take the lead at such a time.
<name>Hughes</name>	Hughes	Gaffett	I could say them over until I shed tears; there was nothing beautiful to me in that place but the stars above and those passages of verse. “[MASK] was always brooding and brooding, and talking to himself; he was afraid he should never get away, and it preyed upon his mind.
<name>Matthew</name>	Matthew	Nathan	‘You sha’n’t be bothered, dear,’ he says; an’ ‘twas one o’ the things that made me set a good deal by [MASK], he did not make a habit of always opposin’, like some men.
<name>Matthew</name>	Matthew	Almiry	Sometimes folks wonders that we don’t live together; perhaps we shall some time,” and a shadow of sadness and apprehension flitted across her face. “The time o’ sickness an’ failin’ has got to come to all. But [MASK]’s got an herb that’s good for everything.”
<name>Captain Ahab</name>	Captain Ahab	William	I just made one stop to underrun [MASK]’s trawl till I come to jes’ such a fish’s I thought you’d want to make one o’ your nice chowders of. I’ve brought an onion with me that was layin’ about on the window-sill at home.”
<name>Abby</name>	Abby	Joanna	“Used to call this p’int [MASK]’s wharf privilege, but ‘t has worn away in the weather since her time. I thought one or two bumps wouldn’t hurt us none,--paint’s got to be renewed, anyway,--but I never thought she’d tetch.
<name>age</name>	age	William	It became evident that, with [MASK], it was the first step that cost, and that, having once joined in social interests, he was able to pursue them with more or less pleasure. He was about sixty, and not young-looking for his years, yet
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Nathan	My heart was gone out o’ my keepin’ before I ever saw [MASK]; but he loved me well, and he made me real happy, and he died before he ever knew what he’d had to know if we’d lived long together.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Elijah	“You’d have liked to come and see her; all the folks did,” said poor [MASK]. “She’d been so pleased to hear everything and see somebody new that took such an int’rest. She had a kind o’ gift to make it pleasant for folks.
<name>Homer</name>	Homer	Lord	Most of us old shipmasters came to know ‘most everything about something; one would take to readin’ on farming topics, and some were great on medicine,--but [MASK] help their poor crews!--or some were all for history, and now and then there’d be one like me that gave his time to the poets.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Joanna	Later generations will know less and less of [MASK] herself, but there are paths trodden to the shrines of solitude the world over,--the world cannot forget them, try as it may; the feet of the young find them out because of curiosity and dim foreboding; while the old bring hearts full of remembrance.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Joanna	No, I never went to work to blame [MASK], as some did. She was full o’ feeling, and her troubles hurt her more than she could bear. I see it all now as I couldn’t when I was young.”
<name>Nellie</name>	Nellie	Joanna	[MASK] used to go out and stay with him. They were always great companions, so she knew just what ‘twas out there. There was a few sheep that belonged to her brother an’ her, but she bargained for him to come and get them on the edge o’ cold weather.
<name>Arne Saknussemm</name>	Arne Saknussemm	Gaffett	So no other living soul had the facts, and he gave them to me. There is a strange sort of a country ‘way up north beyond the ice, and strange folks living in it. [MASK] believed it was the next world to this.”
<name>Aunt Polly</name>	Aunt Polly	Nathan	She always had beautiful, quiet manners. I remember she waited till we were close to her, and then kissed me real affectionate, and inquired for [MASK] before she shook hands with the minister, and then she invited us both in.
<name>Know-It-All</name>	Know-It-All	Asa	We were some little distance from shore, but we could hear a chuckle of laughter, and [MASK], a person who was too ready with his criticism and advice on every possible subject, turned and walked indignantly away.
<name>Bilgewater</name>	Bilgewater	William	“I’ve got new doughnuts, dear,” said the little old lady. “You don’t often catch [MASK] ‘n’ me out o’ provisions. I expect you might have chose a somewhat larger fish, but I’ll try an’ make it do.
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Joanna	“She was crossed in love,--that was all the matter to begin with; but as I look back, I can see that [MASK] was one doomed from the first to fall into a melancholy. She retired from the world for good an’ all, though she was a well-off woman.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	William	I am so pleased! I was just bewailin’ you,” said the daughter, with unwonted feeling. “I was just bewailin’ you, I was so disappointed, an’ I kep’ myself awake a good piece o’ the night scoldin’ poor [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Nathan	‘Twas neat and pretty all about the house, and a lovely day in July. We walked up from the beach together very sedate, and I felt for poor [MASK]’s little pin to see if ‘twas safe in my dress pocket.
<name>Zeena</name>	Zeena	Joanna	He felt that he ought to go out and visit her. She was a member of the church, and might wish to have him consider her spiritual state. I wa’n’t so sure o’ that, but I always liked [MASK], and I’d come to be her cousin by marriage.
