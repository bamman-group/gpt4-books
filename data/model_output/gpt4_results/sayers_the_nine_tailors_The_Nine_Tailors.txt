<name>Grandsire</name>	Grandsire	Holt	Out of the hunt, wrong, right, middle, wrong, right, in and out at 5, wrong and into the hunt (4 times repeated). The last call in each half is a single; [MASK]’s Single must be used in ringing this peal.
<name>Ern</name>	Ern	Wimsey	[MASK] with an E . . . quite . . . occupation? . . . what? . . . Well, we’d better say, Gentleman . . . now then, my lord, you say you can offer evidence as to identity?”
<name>Geoffrey</name>	Geoffrey	Uncle	“If you do see through people as clearly as that, you oughtn’t to make it so brutally plain to them.” “That’s what [MASK] calls my unfeminine lack of tact. He says it comes of going to school and playing hockey. ”
<name>Olivia</name>	Olivia	Hilary	I think he’ll have to pack them into the car, and drive them down in state.” “My dear [MASK], how kind of you! Yes, indeed—I can do with all the white flowers I can get.
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Deacon	and she’d noticed it—when she asked me if the dead man was [MASK] after all, why, then I told her as it was, and that’s how it all came about.” “And how did you know who the dead man was?”
<name>FatherBrown</name>	FatherBrown	Wimsey	“I fear it is true,” he said, as he trotted down the path, “that I am inclined to lose count of time.” “Perhaps,” replied [MASK] politely, “the being continually in and about this church brings eternity too close. ”
<name>Inspector</name>	Inspector	Rector	“Good afternoon, [MASK]. What’s happened here? I was out when your message came, so I—good Lord!” A few words put him in possession of the facts, and he knelt down by the graveside.
<name>Alfie</name>	Alfie	Potty	You got to go to church to be thankful proper, ain’t you, sir? And there was the church door standing open. So [MASK] creeps in, careful-like, see? And there’s a light in the vestry.
<name>Poirot</name>	Poirot	Blundell	The Chief Constable was uneasy too. “You see, [MASK],” he observed, “our difficulty is that we’ve no real proof of the murder. If you could only be sure what the fellow died of----” So a period of inaction set in.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Burner	“If I may be allowed to say so, my lord, it is possibly a little remarkable that the name and address of the sender does not appear on the back.” “That is well observed. Yes, [MASK], you may have full marks for that.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Wimsey—“I	“It is not,” said the Chief Constable. “Still,” he went on, “still—I suppose I might stretch a point. And I suppose”—he looked hard at [MASK] suppose you’ll go in any case.”
<name>George</name>	George	Cranton	“I just wondered.” “Where did that come from?” “What? Oh, this? It was picked up in the church, and we had an idea it might be [MASK]’s. But he says it isn’t, you know.”
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Wimsey	there you are. I’m sure we owe you a great deal. Not too fatigued, I hope?” “No, no,” said [MASK], extricating himself from the congratulatory handshakes of his companions. He felt, in fact, exhausted to dropping-point.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Cranton	[MASK] was one of those smooth-spoken, gentlemanly sort of crooks that you meet hanging about the lounge in cheap-smart restaurants—you know the type. He’d been in trouble before, but he gave out he was a reformed character, and made quite a spot of money writing a book.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Blundell	He came across on the 29th December. I suppose you got on to that?” “Yes,” said [MASK], “we did, but it didn’t help us a lot.” “That bit went all right.
<name>Leila</name>	Leila	Deacon	What made you jump so quick to the idea [MASK] was the corpse in the Thorpe grave? Just you answer me that, my girl, will you?” “I don’t know,” she said, faintly. “It came over me all of a sudden.”
<name>Wargrave</name>	Wargrave	Deacon	“Only when you came to see me, my lord, last week.” “When I showed you that piece of writing in [MASK]’s hand?” “Yes, my lord.” “But how did that----?” began the Superintendent.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Wimsey	I did know. I’ll say that much, I won’t say no more, only that. As I hope to be saved, she never knew a word about it.” “As you hope to be saved?” said [MASK]. “Well.
<name>Jean</name>	Jean	Stevenson	Let’s wave our hats to him—Hullo-ullo! Cheerio!—I’m all for scattering sunshine as we pass. As [MASK] says, we shall pass this way but once—and I devoutly hope he’s right. Now then, what’s this fellow want?”
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Wimsey	The rope had been removed before burial; there was a horrid thrift about that. ... At this point [MASK] shook himself. There was no need to fancy things; there were plenty of other reasons for the removal of the rope. It had been removed before death.
<name>Prothero</name>	Prothero	Harry	So I puts on my coat and comes over, because we don’t rightly know what to do about it.” “But what an extraordinary thing, [MASK]!” exclaimed the Rector, helplessly. “I really—I never—who is this man?
<name>Wolfe</name>	Wolfe	Legros	He had that woman’s house searched, and what do you think they found? [MASK]’ identification disc— no less. Any more guesses coming, my lord?” “I might make a guess, but I won’t. I’ll buy it.
<name>Alleyn</name>	Alleyn	Wimsey	I’m a terrific success at pottering round asking sloppy questions. And I can put away quite a lot of beer in a good cause.” The Superintendent grinned, begged [MASK] to come and see him at any time, clambered into his car and drove off.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Padre	It can’t be a simple a = 1 substitution. I refuse to believe in a message that runs IIAIGIABFE. I shall have to wrestle with this quite a lot more. But you have been simply marvellous, [MASK]. You ought to take to deciphering codes as a profession.”
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Parker	“I didn’t want to be bothered with a lot of clumsy cops. It was my own little game, see? All my own work, as the pavement-artists say.” “Delightful,” said [MASK].
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Wimsey	But he has not written, and his wife is concerned about him. You think you have some information about him?” “Well,” said [MASK], “we have a corpse. And we have a name.
<name>Soames</name>	Soames	Wimsey	“Yes—let’s start the New Year with a clean face.” “Very good, my lord.” Descending, clean and shaven, to the dining-room, [MASK] found the table moved aside and eight chairs set in a circle.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Mary	“In the church?” As though the word were a cue, the parrot picked it up, and began muttering excitedly: “Must go to church. Must go to church. The bells. Don’t tell [MASK]. Must go to church. Aw!
<name>Poirot</name>	Poirot	Wimsey	Like to have a look at it?” “Rather!” The Superintendent brought out an official photograph from a bureau which stood, stacked neatly with documents, in a corner of the room. [MASK] studied it carefully. “When was this taken?”
<name>Parson</name>	Parson	Rector	That’s only right and respectful,’ I says. ‘Throw a bit o’ summat over it,’ I says, ‘while I goes and fetches [MASK], and don’t let any o’ they boys come into the churchyard.’
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Wimsey	Ah! they took one on ’em up to Parliament, they did. Cost a heap of money, so they say.” “Well, it seems ridiculous,” said [MASK]. “And with all this unemployment about, too.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Bunter	Stone-quarry ing’s more about the size of it. You can always tell an old lag by his eyes, [MASK]. Excellent idea to live down the past, and all that, but I hope our friend doesn’t put anything across the good Rector.”
<name>Dorothy</name>	Dorothy	Queen	Now what has the foolish lad done here? The ninth lead should bring [MASK]’s change—let me see, let me see—51732468, 15734286— that’s the first thirds and fourths all right—51372468, 15374286—and that’s the first fourths and thirds— 13547826—ah!
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Deacon	The robbery was on the Thursday night, see? and it had took them that time to get on to it.” “Yes, I see. How did [MASK] know where to find the jewels?” “Well, that was just it, my lord.
<name>Beppo</name>	Beppo	Cranton	“Oh, yes, my lord. I remember him. That was [MASK], that took the necklace and was sent to prison same time as—as my first husband, my lord. I expect you know all about that. That’s his wicked face.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Burner	They let themselves out by the front door, and, guided by [MASK]'s electric torch, made their way through the shrubbery and across the road to the church, entering just as the organ boomed out its final notes.
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	Cobbleigh	Putting him out here in the church, and all that bother of burying him and what not. Why didn’t he go while the going was good, and shove [MASK] into the dyke or something on the way home?”
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Parker	Only I told him he’d have to give me a bit more dope on the thing first. Otherwise, how was I to know he wouldn’t double-cross me again, the dirty skunk?” “Nothing more likely,” said [MASK]. “Ah!
<name>Carfax</name>	Carfax	Cranton	It is true that I saw it upon his papers, but I burnt those and I do not now remember it. But I think it began with a C, and I should know it if I saw it again.” “Was it [MASK]?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Rector	Fair disgusted. Don’t you get talkin’ that a-way, or I’ll tell [MASK] on you, and he won’t let you blow the organ no more. See? What you mean by it?”
<name>Mrs. Oliver</name>	Mrs. Oliver	Venables	[MASK] performed this ancient pagan rite placidly on the oak of the screen)—“so far, I’ve managed to work in quite smoothly with her over the Women’s Institute. I wonder if you’d just step back a little way and tell me if these two sides match.”
<name>Hardy</name>	Hardy	Blundell	He spoke slowly, as though every word were being wrenched out of him. He went on more briskly: “That’s when I knew who it was.” “Then why didn’t you say so?” demanded [MASK].
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Parker	By a big stroke of luck, he didn’t go till after dark, and I suppose he never looked into that dark corner, or he’d have seen the planks had been moved.” “We know what you did on Saturday,” said [MASK].
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Agnes	[MASK]! Can you spare us a moment? . . . My wife is sure to remember. . . . My dear, I am so sorry to interrupt you, but can you recollect when I last preached about Thankfulness?
<name>Simmons</name>	Simmons	Paul	me,’ he says, ‘was a fellow called [MASK]— a tailor or some’in o’ that, living next door to him, like. ’ ‘Why,’ I says to him, ‘your friend’s been havin’ a game with you.
<name>Mr. Worthing</name>	Mr. Worthing	Tom	“Thank you, sir; [MASK]’s always so pleased to see you. I’m sure you do him a lot of good.” “Tell him to keep his spirits up. Such a nasty, depressing complaint. But he’s over the worst now.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Theodore	The pews are modern; [MASK] got them done ten years ago. He’d have preferred chairs, but the congregation wouldn’t have liked it, being used to pews, and he had them copied from a nice old design that wasn’t too offensive.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Potty	“I ’ope as he’s safe. I reckon he did ought to be shut up.” “No, no,” said the sexton. “[MASK]’s safe enough. I don’t ’old with these ’ere asylums.”
<name>Hardy</name>	Hardy	Wimsey	“Have you-----? But pardon me. I am unwarrantably interfering. Still—have you tried this method on the cryptogram?” “Well, I haven’t,” admitted [MASK]. “I’ve only just thought of it.
<name>Monkeys</name>	Monkeys	Fairies	[MASK], too, and elephants. Well, I don’t know. Looks like a bit of a joke, don’t it now? Perhaps” (his eye brightened with an idea), “perhaps somebody’s been copying out something out of a book.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Wimsey	“I do let my tongue run on a bit, I’ll allow. His lordship must excuse me.” “Not at all,” said [MASK]. “In a quiet place like this, if one doesn’t talk about one’s neighbours, what is there to talk about?
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Wimsey	[MASK] brought his bell competently up and set her at backstroke while the tuckings were finally adjusted, after which, at the Rector’s suggestion, a few rounds were rung to let him “get the feel of her.”
<name>Alleyn</name>	Alleyn	Parker	He hasn’t reported himself since last September.” The girl shrugged a disdainful shoulder, and they left her bending over the sick man. “Well, Superintendent,” said [MASK], “I’m afraid that’s the best we can do for you at the moment.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Hilary	Then the noise of the bells had come full and clear; today, it reached her only in distant bursts, when the wind, rollicking away with it eastward, bated for a moment or veered round a little to the south. “[MASK]!”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Wimsey	The smaller the fall of the land, the bigger weight of water you need to keep the outfall scoured. You’d think it was obvious, wouldn’t you? But it’s taken people hundreds of years to learn it.” “Yes,” said [MASK].
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Wimsey	“Well, he kept his tackle in good order all the same,” said [MASK], making a complicated knot and pulling it tight with his teeth. “Are you busy, or have you got time to look at something?”
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	He ruined my poor [MASK] and brought her into the dock once, and he robbed her of her good name and made bastards of our little girls, and now he can come between us again at the altar rails and drive her into the witness-box to put my neck in the rope.
<name>John</name>	John	Wimsey	a matter of twenty year, now. And more.” “Then why don’t they do it?” “Ah!” said the sluice-keeper. He remained lost in melancholy thought for some minutes, and [MASK] did not interrupt him.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Wimsey	Incredibly aloof, flinging back the light in a dusky shimmer of bright hair and gilded outspread wings, soared the ranked angels, cherubim and seraphim, choir over choir, from corbel and hammer-beam floating face to face uplifted. “My God!” muttered [MASK], not without reverence.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Deacon	Joined up in the first year of the War and considered rather a good riddance. Last seen on the last day of his leave in 1918, and that day was just two days after [MASK]’s escape from prison. Left his home to rejoin his unit.
<name>Judy</name>	Judy	Hilary	[MASK] grinned a little. “Hurt theirselves” was a moderate way of expressing the probable result of a hundred-and-twenty-foot fall. She led the way up the second ladder. By contrast with the brilliance below, the bell-chamber was sombre and almost menacing.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	Well, that made me see red, and I was in half a mind to give him up to the police and take what was coming to us, but when I thought about [MASK] and the kids—well, I couldn’t face it.
<name>Parsons</name>	Parsons	Harry	“Well, [MASK], what’s the trouble?” “Well, sir, it’s about this here grave. I thought I better come and see you, being as it’s a church matter, like.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Hilary	You’re lucky.” “Do you really think so?” [MASK] looked excited. “Yes—but your luck will come more at the end of life than at the beginning, because the other sort of people won’t understand the way your mind works.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Thomas	‘That’s queer,’ he says, ‘but maybe he’s got another name as well. Far as I can make out,’ he says, ‘this [MASK] ain’t quite right in his ’ead. My friend said as he was potty, like.’
<name>Denys</name>	Denys	Wimsey	Another form dived after it, and a rush was made to the bank. [MASK], flinging off his coat, hurled himself down to the water’s edge. Somebody caught and held him. “No good, my lord, they’re gone! My God!
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Jim	Speaking as a policeman, I am shocked; speaking as a human being, I have every sympathy for you. Now, you.” He turned to [MASK]. “I imagine your part of it comes in here.” “Yes, sir.
<name>Wodehouse</name>	Wodehouse	Bunter	I dusted it. I didn’t know—ho-ho.” “[MASK],” said his lordship, “what is the verse about the struck eagle stretched upon the plain, Never through something clouds to soar again? It expresses my feelings exactly.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Will	Now I’ll be off and let the youngsters come back to their tea. By the way, what’s gone with the parrot?” “We’ve put him in the other room,” said [MASK], with a scowl.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Wimsey	Yet a lingering suspicion caused [MASK] to take up the bottle very carefully, by means of a finger inserted into the neck. It was not very dusty. It could not, he thought, have lain there long. It would bear somebody’s finger-prints—perhaps.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Will	“He goes on like that,” she said. “Gets on my nerves. He picked it up the night [MASK] was so bad. They were ringing the peal, and it worried him, like, that he couldn’t be there.
<name>Adler</name>	Adler	Cranton	He hunted through his pock-etbook and laid the official photograph of [MASK] before her. “Is that your husband as you first knew him?” “No, milord. That is not my husband. It is not in the least like him.”
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Wimsey	“Oh, yes?” said [MASK]. “Yes, I’ve met him. Frightful blithering ass. Handy thing to be, sometimes. Easily cultivated. Five minutes’ practice before the glass every day, and you will soon acquire that vacant look so desirable for all rogues, detectives and Government officials.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Rosie	So then [MASK] made up her mind to tell him what she seen. Only that made him angrier still, and he said she was to go and no more nonsense, and never to speak about ghosts, and such like to him again.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Agnes	But I mustn’t delay. You shall tell me about it as you go. I will be with you in one moment. [MASK], my dear, see that the men get their breakfast and explain to them why I cannot join them.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	James	There’s that Potty, for instance. He’s always wandering round the church at night. Only he’d have to get into the bell-chamber, and I don’t see how he could. But I’m waiting for [MASK].
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Nobby	I was glad I couldn’t see more than I did. “Well, I thought, you’d better make tracks, [MASK], while the dirty work’s going on down there. So I came in again carefully and bolted the door after me and started to come down the ladder.
<name>Godfrey</name>	Godfrey	Cranton	“The emeralds? Was that what he was after? Do you mean he had them after all? Why, we always thought the other fellow— [MASK]—had got them.” “You didn’t know that they had been hidden in the church?”
<name>Legrand</name>	Legrand	Deacon	“I said to myself, it must be [MASK]. I said, here’s that devil come out of his grave to trouble us again, that’s what I said. Mind you, I didn’t exactly know, but that’s what I said to myself.”
<name>Chasuble</name>	Chasuble	Venables	You must positively come along to the Rectory. We have ample accomodation—too much, indeed, too much. My name, by the way, is [MASK]— I should have mentioned it earlier. I am, as you will have gathered, rector of the parish.”
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Wimsey	“We got him dug last night, all very fit and proper. Maybe his lordship would like to come and see.” [MASK] expressed suitable interest, and they made their way round to the other side of the church.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Thoday	I had a word with [MASK]. He made no difficulties. He said he had an idea of purchasing a bit of land and starting to farm again on his own, but that, after his illness, he gave up the idea, thinking that for some time he wouldn’t be strong enough.
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Jack	[MASK]! He has gone on down with the others. Ah, well, poor fellow, no doubt he wants to get home to his supper. We must not be selfish. Unfortunately he has the key of the bell-chamber, and without it we cannot conduct our researches.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Emily	[MASK] took out the jug, but returned almost immediately. “Oh, if you please, ma’am, the Rector says, will you all excuse him, please, and he’ll take his breakfast in the study. And oh!
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Wimsey	She’s held this tide, but she’ll go the next with this wind and the tide at springs. It’ll lay the whole country under water, my lord, and there’s no time to lose.” “All right,” said [MASK].
<name>Aslan</name>	Aslan	Wimsey	“I ought to have known,” said [MASK]. “I made a thing very like it for the pirate’s hoard.” His long fingers were working over the beams, gently pulling at the thick wooden pegs which held them together.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Hinkins	Six in front of this tomb and six the other side—and have you brought those big pickle-jars? They’ll do splendidly for the narcissi, and the aspidistras will hide the jars and we can put some ivy in front of the pots. [MASK], you might fill up my watering-can.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Nobby	“Of course you wouldn’t do such a thing as that.” “Not me,” replied [MASK]. “What do you think?” He winked. “Well, we went on writing backwards and forwards till we reached what they call an impasse.
<name>Albert</name>	Albert	Emily	I’m quite used to giving [MASK] a hand with it. I hope it isn’t very dull for him here. I understand he’s a great acquisition in the kitchen and extraordinarily good at music-hall imitations. Twice as good as the talkies, Cook says.”
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Will	“I seen him—Number Nine—I seen him a-talking to [MASK] in the church. But the Tailors was too much for him. Him with the rope—he got him, and he’ll get you too.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Agnes	Ah! here is my wife. [MASK], my dear, I am sorry to be a little behind time, but I have brought a guest back with me. He has had an accident with his car and will stay the night with us. The rug!
<name>Mac</name>	Mac	Hezekiah	“We consider him a very able man.” “You must introduce me to him; I feel that we should get on well together. The coroner doesn’t like him. Some trifling personal antagonism, no doubt. Why, here is my old friend [MASK]!
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Cobbleigh	He collars him, and finds he’s pinched the escape convict that everybody’s looking for. The convict says, ‘Let me go, and I’ll make you a rich man,’ see? [MASK]’s got no objection to that.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Potty	So I thinks, that’s [MASK] up to his games again—I better send him off home. So I goes up to the church door, and I sees footmarks going all along the path as far as the porch, and there they seems to stop.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Wimsey	“Oh, hell!” said [MASK]. “Yes, my lord; that thought passed through my own mind. I said, ‘Are you quite sure, miss, that you have not mistaken the handwriting?’
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Thoday	Hands were shaken. “Very sorry I was to miss that peal,” said [MASK]. “But I was pretty bad, wasn’t I, Rector?” “You were indeed. You don’t look to have quite got over it yet.”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Wimsey	He shuffled sturdily out, and within five minutes they heard the deep and melancholy voice of the bell ringing, first the six tailors for a woman and then the quick strokes which announce the age of the dead. [MASK] counted them up to thirty-seven.
<name>Sholto</name>	Sholto	Deacon	She wanted to get back to her family, and they scraped her across on one of the last boats.” “Then that’s clear enough. [MASK] invented his cryptogram before he actually hid the emeralds. He couldn’t have taken it into prison with him.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Wimsey	But I should never have thought of the possibility that one might make a cipher out of change-ringing. Most ingenious.” “It could have been done still more ingeniously,” said [MASK]. “I can think of lots of ways to improve it.
<name>Grant</name>	Grant	Bunter	Another half-mile, and they came to a signpost and a secondary road that turned off to the right. [MASK] turned his torch upon the signpost and read upon the single arm: “Fenchurch St. Paul.”
