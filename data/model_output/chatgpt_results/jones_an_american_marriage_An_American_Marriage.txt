<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Celestial	It’s the shoes. What I wore on my feet were for styling, not striding— oxblood Florsheims that would make a preacher covetous. Leather upper and sole. [MASK] had on glorified nurse’s shoes, ugly as newborn puppies, but a plus in a street race.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Olive	“I want it from you.” I can’t remember this day without hearing the air around her words, without imagining the tumors multiplying, consuming her body. [MASK] was dying and I spoke to her with bitterness in my mouth. That I didn’t know makes no difference.
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Olive	My mama is already dead.” hearing his voice now, I felt that same mix of shame and rage I felt when he said he would carry [MASK]’s casket. It made my throat itch, and I had to clear it twice before I spoke.
<name>he</name>	he	Walter	When we sit down together, our time is precious. If you can forgive, please forgive me. If I explain, will you listen? Tell me what I need to do to make it better. What does [MASK] have to say about all of this?
<name>someone</name>	someone	Celestial	But when I asked for her hand, I was seeking your blessing, as her father, but also as a mentor. With [MASK], I was punching above my weight, and I guess I was hoping for a clap on the back, but I ended up feeling like a dummy.
<name>him</name>	him	Roy	There was insight I could have given him, no doubt. However, I wasn’t going to give [MASK] the map to the core of her. He was a cool dude; even back then I liked him. He and I were almost frat bothers.
<name>she</name>	she	Celestial	I was glad to see that you were serious in your intentions, but I didn’t think I should see the ring before [MASK] did. I could tell that your feelings were a little bruised when you left that day, and frankly, that was a positive development.
<name>Janine</name>	Janine	Andre	“But I don’t really know,” [MASK] said, thinking aloud. “He feels like everything was taken from him—his job, his house, his wife—and he wants all his shit back.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Earl	“Because I do.” “I’ll tell you this. I saw them afterward when I was picking up some hours at the Saturday Nighter for my uncle [MASK]. They came in and started getting drunk in the middle of the day, her especially.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Olive	“You could barely talk.” “But I was old enough to know my name. How long did it take me to straighten it out in my mind?” “No time at all. It started as a promise to [MASK], but you’re my son.
<name>unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Roy	Yes, I was fortunate by all those measures, but in my marriage to [MASK], I felt blessed in the old-fashioned sense, in the way that anyone would be in finding someone whose smell you enjoyed. Did we love so forcefully that night because we knew or because we didn’t?
<name>Veronica</name>	Veronica	Celestial	“You can have it,” [MASK] said. I gave her the look that she calls my Gary Coleman expression. The contract specified delivery by the end of the month. The deadline was more than firm; it was black-ink-notarized in triplicate.
<name>he</name>	he	Celestial	“I don’t know,” she said. “But let’s go back.” “What would I tell my mother? You know she has dinner cooking at full tilt by now.” “Blame it on me,” [MASK] said.
<name>darling</name>	darling	Dre	“He was okay, I guess. He said to tell you that he misses you.” “You know that I love him, right, [MASK]? His mother never believed me.” “Well, she didn’t know you, did she?
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Gloria	I was bundled against the elements in a down coat [MASK] sent me, so convinced was she that I would die of hypothermia before I finished my “artist phase” and came back home to get a master’s in education.
<name>Jackie</name>	Jackie	Gloria	For a long time. I think like three years or so. My mother was a June bride at the courthouse because her pastor wouldn’t perform the ceremony.” I have seen the photos. [MASK] wears an off-white suit and a veiled pillbox hat.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Celestial	Cars ant-hilled around, looking for parking. Up ahead, a highway patrol car’s nose stuck out from a stand of bushes, speed trap, the same as always. “So when you going to see her?” This time her was [MASK].
<name>someone</name>	someone	Walter	He asked for a chance to tell his side of the story, and that’s what he did. You have no privacy in prison, and let me tell you, these dudes in here gossip like bitches. [MASK] was talking loud, like he was saying his Easter speech.
<name>Christmas</name>	Christmas	Valentine	Just a stupid mistake. So I was going to send it to her for [MASK]’s, but I couldn’t let it go. You know how I am, a perfectionist on the commissions. Something about it was too easy, too on the nose.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jelani	Then she disappeared into the kitchen, leaving me alone with this girl and her baby boy. On the floor, she spread a quilt of various shades of orange and set the baby on top of it. [MASK] arranged himself on all fours, rocking.
<name>Andy</name>	Andy	Celestial	He looked up at the sun, not bothering to shield his eyes. “I got locked up for a crime I didn’t commit, and when I get home, my wife has hooked up with my boy.” [MASK] walked toward me like this was any other day
<name>Bella</name>	Bella	Roy	He was a commanding stranger breathing hot on my neck. When he moved us in the direction of the master bedroom, the corner room that had originally belonged to my parents and was the space where [MASK] and I slept as husband and wife, I said, “Not in there.”
<name>my mother</name>	my mother	Andre	I consulted my watch, a gift from [MASK]. Old-fashioned, I wound it every morning. As pretty as a baby, it was heavy and noisy, jerking slightly as the seconds ticked. I nodded and unlocked the glass door and we were open for business.
<name>She</name>	She	Celestial	This “home,” she promised, was a wedding gift to us both. “The key is in your pocket,” she said. And the key was in my pocket now, but would it work? [MASK] didn’t file for divorce.
<name>Thalia</name>	Thalia	Dre	You saw him trying to kill himself up under that tree. He wanted to crack his own skull.” “Actually, I was the one he was trying to kill.” “[MASK],” she said. “You and me, we are just heartbroken.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Roy	“You’ll never see anything like that again, no matter how long you live.” “I don’t want to.” “[MASK] has been away so long,” she whispered. “I’ve done everything I’m supposed to do.
<name>Emmanuel</name>	Emmanuel	Spelman	I even remember a man who came to speak at [MASK] who had been wrongfully imprisoned for decades. Did you see him? He spoke along with the white woman who pointed the finger at him in the first place. They both got saved or something.
<name>She</name>	She	Celestial	“What are we going to do?” In response, I positioned myself behind her and circled my arms around her waist, crouching a little to rest my chin against her sharp shoulder. [MASK] said it again: “What are we going to do?”
<name>He</name>	He	Andre	He breathed deeply, trusting that the world would keep spinning until he had gotten his rest. Life was less daunting at five in the morning when only one of us was awake. [MASK] had grown into a handsome man. His long and lanky solidified into slim but strong.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Celestial	You didn’t change the locks. I had my doubts. You know I did. But when I was on the front porch, I decided to try my key. It slid in easy and turned slippery like WD-40. That’s how I knew, [MASK].
<name>Holly</name>	Holly	Celestial	I hung up as [MASK] emerged, looking herself like a Christmas present, dressed in a little lace-nightie thing that I recognized as something that I’d bought for her. She had complained that it looked itchy, meaning that it looked cheap.
<name>her mother</name>	her mother	Olive	She knew this wasn’t completely true. I was embarrassed remembering Christmas Eve, not the violence but my desperate confessions as she kept me awake to save my life. When I told her about the pear, she soothed me with a hymn, the same one she sang for [MASK].
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Davina	Grabbing a bolt of red fabric flecked with gold, I returned to the cutting table and handed it to [MASK], who immediately started pulling the cloth free. “Sometimes people ask how much we have so we have to measure it all. So I’ll do that while you talk.
<name>the boy next door</name>	the boy next door	Andre	My mother, an alumna herself, insisted that this was where I would cultivate new, bone-deep friendships, but I stuck close with [MASK], who was literally the boy next door. We had been close since we were three months old, bathing together in the kitchen sink.
<name>Poupée</name>	Poupée	Poupees	“Maybe another name might be more effective.” Since it seemed like I was moving in the right direction, I kept going. “You could call it [MASK]. That’s French for dolls.” “French?” she asked, eyeing me.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Roy	what i know is this: they didn’t believe me. Twelve people and not one of them took me at my word. There in front of the room, I explained [MASK] couldn’t have raped the woman in room 206 because we had been together.
<name>Therese</name>	Therese	Georgia	Our marriage was good. This isn’t just memory talking. “[MASK],” I said, using her pet name. “My family is more complicated than you think. My mother . . .” But I couldn’t manage the rest of the sentence.
<name>The tree</name>	The tree	Hickey	“Only way to tell is to cut it down and count the rings. I don’t want to know that bad. The answer is old. [MASK] has seen it all.” “You ready?” I asked him.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Georgia	A stupid glance over my shoulder showed her expression relaxing, glad I wasn’t taking anything that couldn’t be replaced and glad I didn’t destroy anything that couldn’t be repaired. “Do you care for me, [MASK]?” I asked her.
<name>Alaska</name>	Alaska	Davina	“You didn’t act like you didn’t know.” “I want to say thank you. That’s why I’m here, to say thank you and good-bye.” [MASK] said, “I want to say fuck you. How about that?”
<name>her</name>	her	Roy	“But you don’t know where things stand with [MASK] and her. That’s the only thing I care about. I don’t give a damn about you and your feelings. Only thing that matters to me is my boy.”
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Celestial	[MASK] ran her hands over her hair, buzzed short since we first got together. The close cut made her older, and not in a negative way. It was the difference between a young lady and a grown woman. “You okay?” I said.
<name>Mae</name>	Mae	Iam	She held the bread out for my inspection. Her face said, I’m trying. [MASK] trying so hard. I rummaged in the fridge until I found a big red teacher-apple. The knife I pulled from the block was small but sharp.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Andre	Once she woke up before the sun and whispered, “[MASK], sometimes I feel like I’m not all the way together.” That was the one time I joined her underneath the sheet, but it was only to quiet her trembling.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Celestial	Ten years later, my life was at its sweet spot. When anybody said, “Where are you from?” I said, “The A!”—so intimate with the city that I knew her by her nickname. When asked about my family, I talked about [MASK].
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Davina	after we ate, I jumped up to help clear the table. I scraped the plates and stacked them in the sink. [MASK] gave a little smile, like the way you might smile at a baby that tried to do something grown, like play the piano.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Roy	So come pay us a visit. I promise that we’ll make everything look nice, and I also promise that I will behave. [MASK], I cannot say an ill word against a woman that I have not met, but my spirit is troubled.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Hopper	I’ve been thinking back.” “Yeah?” “I remember a boy named [MASK].” “Was he okay?” Her voice was so low that I couldn’t say for sure that I actually heard it, yet I knew what she said.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Celestial	“I’m getting married,” I said. “Who is the lucky lady?” I stumbled, surprised that he didn’t know, probably in the same way he was surprised that I didn’t know where his kids were in college. “[MASK].
<name>Jimmy</name>	Jimmy	Roy	“I still don’t like it. I want us to be on the up-and-up. I don’t want our kid to inherit all of our secrets.” [MASK] pumped his fist in the air. “Did you hear yourself?”
<name>He</name>	He	Andre	I kept rooting around in the cabinet, looking to see what else belonged to him, but I found nothing, no razor, no toothbrush, no foot powder. So hope gave another little growl, like a rottweiler puppy this time. [MASK] didn’t live here either.
<name>Lolita</name>	Lolita	Olive	“That’s right,” I said. “You know I’m her manager. Would I let somebody shortchange my wife?” “Five thousand dollars for a baby doll?” [MASK] fanned herself with the magazine, lifting her peach-preserve hair.
<name>Bobo</name>	Bobo	Hopper	The nickname I did know. [MASK] wasn’t the youngest person there but still too young for adult prison, too frail and too pretty. I remembered his rouged lips and hair flattened with homemade lye. “I don’t know him,” I said again.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Andre	She explained that convenience, habit, comfort, obligation—these are all things that wear the same clothing as love sometimes. Did I think this thing with [MASK] was maybe too easy? He is literally the boy next door.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Roy	He panted. “This is my life, motherfucker. My life. I was married to her.” Have you ever stared fury in its eyes? There is no saving yourself from a man in its throes. [MASK]’s face was haunted and wild.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no context or information given to suggest a specific name.)	Unknown (There is no context or information given to suggest a specific name.)	Celestial	(That whole thing lasted about ten minutes.) I know for sure that this is the first time I ever wrote a love letter and that’s what this is going to be. [MASK], I love you. I miss you. I want to come home to you.
<name>Mrs. Breedlove</name>	Mrs. Breedlove	Olive	Do not call yourself praying by lying in the bed thinking. Thinking and praying are two different things, and for something this important, you need prayer. Your loving mother, [MASK] I folded the letter and slid it into my pants pocket.
<name>Soldier</name>	Soldier	Andre	I drank it down, then set the cup on the concrete floor beside me. I stood up and extended my hand. “Sir,” I said. He shook my hand in a manner that felt both formal and sincere. “Stand down, [MASK].
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Roy	I nodded, letting my arms hang at my side as he explored my features. He closed his eyes as though he couldn’t trust them. When his thumb passed my lips, I caught it in a light pucker. [MASK] responded with a relieved sigh.
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	Olive	On the wall was mounted a green phone, rotary model; I nodded toward it. “May I?” Crumbling Ritz crackers, he slumped his shoulders and said, “They cut it off yesterday. With [MASK] gone, it has been hard making ends meet.”
<name>darling</name>	darling	Georgia	“You don’t have to, [MASK].” She shushed me with a kiss I wasn’t sure I wanted. In the light of the night table clock, I made out her taut brow and quivering eyelids. “We don’t have to,” I said.
<name>Mr. Garner</name>	Mr. Garner	Celestial	“I think it’s time for us to go, sir. People will be waiting for us at the church.” [MASK] stood, too. “Everyone will be there.” “Who is everybody? Ain’t no everybody without my wife.”
<name>the owner</name>	the owner	Celestial	So don’t tell me about how you tried.” She was sniffling when I attacked the car again. The tennis racket wasn’t much match for the Volvo. I couldn’t even bust out the windows. I did get the alarm to wail, but [MASK] silenced it immediately.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Celestial	“There’s so much that you don’t know. Things people like us can’t even imagine.” “Is that why you’re hiding in the corner? [MASK], what are you doing?” I beckoned to her. “Come here, girl.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Roy	Most of all, I was sorry for [MASK]. The last time I saw him on that morning before his mother’s wake, he said, “I never had a chance, did I? I only thought I did.”
<name>Dr. Johnson</name>	Dr. Johnson	Andre	As we climbed the stairs to the front walk, I heard [MASK]’s calm words. “He hit his head pretty bad. He might be concussed. Don’t let him go to sleep right away.” “Thank you,” I said.
<name>Tyler</name>	Tyler	Kani	Then he stumbled, costing him some ground. He was close enough now that I could read the label on the back of his shirt: [MASK]. My fingers closed around his skinny ankle as I hit the asphalt with my right knee taking the lead.
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Dre	But now I don’t have anything to offer you but myself But it’s better than it was last year, when I couldn’t even give you that. So here I am.” He looked to his left. “Your turn, [MASK].
<name>Shirley</name>	Shirley	Celestial	When I get home, I’ll show you the magazine with her picture.” “I already saw it,” I said. Posing with a pair of dolls that look like her parents, [MASK] smiles like she never suffered a day in her life.
<name>Marina</name>	Marina	Celestial	“I know,” she said, sighing. “I know, I know, I know.” “[MASK]. Please, let’s get married.” In the dark, she spoke with her lips so close to mine that I could taste her words, rich and peaty.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Dre	Don’t treat her like she stole something.’ To which my daddy said, ‘I’m not saying that she stole it. I just want her to know what she has.’ ” [MASK] shook his head as though my memories were his own.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Gloria	As everyone else ate duck and drank cava, [MASK] pulled me outside the restaurant. Standing in the parking lot, beside a fragrant gardenia bush, she pulled me close. “I’m happy today because you’re happy. Not because you’re getting married.
<name>Bella</name>	Bella	Georgia	“[MASK],” I said into her hair. “How can you live up here?” She turned around to answer me, and our faces were so close that she leaned back to keep from kissing me. “I’m not really living here, living here.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Roy	Now I call you that because I’m the one missing home and home is you. Dear [MASK], By the time you get this letter, I will have already been to visit because I’m mailing it on the way out of town.
<name>him</name>	him	Celestial	“I’m happy to let you stay the night, but I’m asking you not to use my phone. You have been alone with [MASK] for what, five years? You had all that time to make a case for yourself.
<name>Alaska</name>	Alaska	Georgia	That will always be my name for you in my head. So, [MASK], this is the letter I have been waiting five years to write, the words I have been practicing. I even scratched it into the paint on the wall beside my bed.
<name>Santa</name>	Santa	Walter	What about this, [MASK]? Nobody prepared me for this. The light of the day brightened the space a little bit. It was Christmas Eve, regardless of what was happening to me. Across the street, a stylish woman moved a dozen poinsettias onto the porch.
<name>Darry</name>	Darry	Gloria	He peeled my hands off the hydrant, one finger at a time. Somehow we made it to the fish place. He called [MASK], then he grabbed me by the shoulders. “You cannot let this destroy you,” he said.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Roy	Somebody pushed me to the ground and my chin hit the pavement. My slip rode up showing my everything to everyone as my tooth sank into the soft of my bottom lip. [MASK] was on the asphalt beside me, barely beyond my grasp, speaking words that didn’t reach my ears.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Sugar	[MASK], tell me the honest truth—do you wish you had a baby right now?” I really couldn’t say. The main thing was that I didn’t want to feel the way I was feeling.
<name>Zora</name>	Zora	Olive	The recliner was new, but it was placed where the old one had been. Above the couch was a large piece of art that [MASK] prized, showing a serene woman wearing an African head scarf, reading a book.
<name>Kofi</name>	Kofi	Jelani	“But yes. [MASK] is the spitting image of his daddy. When they are together, people make jokes about human cloning.” She lowered herself onto the floor beside her son, then unwrapped a paper packet to reveal brown fabric the same color as her skin.
<name>Mother</name>	Mother	Andre	There was no easy comeback to this accusation. [MASK] and I were still standing, stranded in the crowded room. My father dug his spoon into the jam cake, self-satisfied, I could tell, with his performance, enjoying having spoken the last word.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Mommy	She says that they were trashy, smelled of camphor, and the little girl didn’t even have shoes.) But anyway, the little girl pointed at my mother and said, “Look, [MASK]! A baby maid!” And for my grandmother, this was the last straw.
<name>her mother</name>	her mother	Olive	Nobody is holding anything against anyone.” Seeming to think it over, she pulled open the oven, taking out a pan of toast cooked the way [MASK] used to make it, soft on the bottom, crispy on the top except for five dots of butter.
<name>Lawrence</name>	Lawrence	Banks	Yes, last month she finally agreed to talk to [MASK] about divorce papers, and yesterday I went to the jeweler and selected a ring, something my mama had been predicting since I was three years old. My idea was to wake her with it tomorrow, Thanksgiving Day.
<name>Terry</name>	Terry	Roy	When I stood up, he was waiting on me and thrust his chest against mine. “Get out of my face, [MASK].” “Tell me,” he said. “Tell me why you did it.” “Why I did what?”
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Celestial	I’m a proud member of the first category. My wife, [MASK], used to say that I’m a country boy at the core, but I never cared for that designation. For one. I’m not from the country per se.
<name>whiskey</name>	whiskey	Sprite	“You knew what ‘come’ was? In the eighth grade?” “I guess I knew it was something.” We didn’t talk for a while. She pounded cheap vodka and I switched to beer and then to [MASK].
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Roy	“Ease up on [MASK],” he said. “If you lose it every time he tries to come clean, you’re encouraging him to lie.” “But,” I said, not ready to let go.
<name>boy</name>	boy	Andre	“I didn’t ask you about no [MASK].” “He’ll be here in a minute.” My head hurt, but I pressed her. “It’s a yes-or-no question.”
<name>911</name>	911	Davina	If she locked the door against me, I didn’t want to know. Back in the workroom, I picked up the phone and dialed [MASK], who answered sounding frightened, as anyone would be at this hour.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Roy	We were born lucky. [MASK]’s starting from scratch. Less than scratch. You saw him trying to kill himself up under that tree. He wanted to crack his own skull.” “Actually, I was the one he was trying to kill.”
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Davina	Like they say, weeping endures for a night.” “But joy comes in the morning,” I finished. This is the promise spoken at every Baptist funeral. I thought of my mama, and I asked [MASK] if she had been there for her home-going.
<name>my father</name>	my father	Carlos	“I know you don’t wish anything bad on him.” We stood before the kitchen sink gazing out the window at the brown grass covered with fallen leaves. Against the far wall at the edge of the property grew a fig tree that [MASK] planted to celebrate my birth.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	davina	I managed to say, “Bless the hands that prepared it,” before I let her go. AS [MASK] spooned mounds of everything onto my plate, I imagined myself—a man just out of the joint, about to do some serious damage to some pork chops.
<name>me</name>	me	Evie	When I was three, he fell for a woman who hailed from the world of dry ice and shipping, but she decided not to leave her husband, and he returned to [MASK] and me. After that, there were other zealous flirtations, but nothing stuck.
<name>She</name>	She	Celestial	When we first were married, [MASK] said that the screech of the garage door made her smile because it meant that I was home from work. In those days, we had been right in there, together on all the levels—mental, spiritual, and yes, physical.
<name>She</name>	She	Gloria	May heaven be filled with elegant objects. Then I whispered to the air, “Please forgive me.” I shifted my eyes to my mother, hoping that she would grace me with at least a smile. [MASK] is outrageously beautiful.
<name>Barbie</name>	Barbie	Roy	Suddenly he sprang up like a basketball player and brought the angel to the ground. “I guess I still got it,” he said. “You wrap, right?” The doll favored [MASK], like a lot of them do.
