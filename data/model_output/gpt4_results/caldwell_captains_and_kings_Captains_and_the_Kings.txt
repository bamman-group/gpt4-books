<name>Lincoln</name>	Lincoln	Rory	I’ve heard him called a ‘hero’ by some newspapers, for killing the assassin, but if he’s such a hero why don’t he come forward to be praised? All I can say now is that that’s the real mystery—outside the reason why [MASK] was murdered.
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Joe	She did not smile, as he had expected. He sat down opposite her. “[MASK],” she said, “I wish you were not always trying to give the impression of being a villain. You know you are not.”
<name>Whirlpools</name>	Whirlpools	Rory	The whirlpools swung together again en masse, and surged after [MASK], and everyone poured and struggled and pushed and hit to get into the ballroom to the best seats. The band tried to enter, but was impeded by brass and drums.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Joseph	Just a big—man—nicely spoken but a little crude in manner, and he held his hat in his hands and bowed to me, and said he was a friend of yours. He asked if you lived here.” [MASK] controlled his quickened breathing.
<name>Artemis</name>	Artemis	Joseph	He will take revenge on the world that did that to him. “This world killed my parents,” said [MASK]. “They were murdered just as surely as if they had been shot. Well, it is not important, is it?
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Joseph	It was a tight vengeful face that looked into his, the deep-set small blue eyes filled with fire and determination. [MASK]’s hair might be white, but it was still thick and vital, and the face was the face of a young man, and invincible.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Marjorie	His mind had been taken up with its unique glooms and dismays and horrors on the ship, with the exception of the hours of interlude with the actress, and so he had not given too much thought to his predicament concerning [MASK]. Indeed, the predicament was really his father.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Elizabeth	That part surely played its own role in wars, for men were romanticists and always, thought [MASK] with wry sadness, on parade. No true woman had ever written a marching song nor had yearned to blow a bugle or sound a drum.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Elizabeth	“I loved him,” said [MASK] and bent her head. “Did I hear past tense? Don’t you still care about him, even if he is dead?” “No. I see now it was only infatuation.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Bernadette	“I feel sorry for her,” said [MASK]. “He was all she had. My brother. I suppose I should feel sad, and I will have Masses said for his soul, but I really can’t feel very much. Not very much.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Joseph	There was even a Chinese, and a Japanese, all impeccable and deferential to each other. It was like a majestic minuet to [MASK], danced to the clinking music of cold money, and executed with precision, no eyes brightening or dimming, no voice lifted in a joke or in mirth.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Joseph	His wounds had healed, though sometimes he limped. He never complained. He accepted life with high-heartedness and a simple wisdom which was beyond [MASK]’s capabilities. He was never resentful nor grudging. He gave largely of himself and his big glowing smiles, and his native merriment.
<name>Martin</name>	Martin	Sean	In short, [MASK] found all the graceful amenities of life, all its graciousness, all its light and color and symmetry and contour, all its urbane and civilizing elements, endlessly fascinating, endlessly delicious and worthy of worship.
<name>Arkady</name>	Arkady	Bernadette	“I want to tell you something else too, my woman!” [MASK] continued to shout. “I’ve wanted to tell you this for a long time and only refrained out of respect for my father. He never could endure you.”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Joseph	[MASK] took off his coat and covered the one blanket on his sagging bed with it, for extra warmth. Autumnal thunder, one loud and explosive clap, followed on a brilliant flare of lightning, and the wind rose and the glass in the window shook and one loose shutter banged somewhere.
<name>goblins</name>	goblins	Irish	“Well, your Dada and your Mum was probably rich plantation owners. Don’t matter. I don’t hold grudges. Well, not many, anyway. We [MASK] got long memories. We don’t forget easy. Well.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Joseph	There are only Men. But the world doesn’t know that, and so a man often has to protect himself from undeserved malice and cruelty. He keeps any harmful secret to himself.” [MASK] was moved as he had rarely been moved before.
<name>Alonso</name>	Alonso	Joey	Her round voice, usually so full and assured, now sank into melancholy. “[MASK],” she continued after a moment, “I do not deny that you may make your way, and well. But not with a sister to care for and protect.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Sean	A gross man, I am afraid.” Had [MASK] heard anyone call him a liar he would have been—almost— genuinely horrified. For he had pushed from his remembrance all that he knew of his brother and that brother’s desperate struggle for the younger members of his family.
<name>Thackeray</name>	Thackeray	Joseph	Or claim to be an intelligent gentleman.” [MASK] had replied, “If the history of every man in this world were known, back to our forefathers, none of us would have reason for any pride at all.”
<name>Malachy</name>	Malachy	Joseph	It was a matter of the spirit, to revere the unknowable, to give it silent honor even if the mouth declared it deserved no honor. It made even the churchless Irishman fight to the death against English iconoclasts and military might. [MASK] began to talk.
<name>himself</name>	himself	Socialism	He had been only eighteen then. But slowly, through his father and the men he had met over the following years, he had come to understand that there was no quarrel at all between the very rich and powerful, and [MASK]. In fact.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Bernadette	[MASK] never learned that a restrained voice meant dignity and control of strong feeling or good manners, especially in women. She thought such a voice was servile, fit only for servants, and that the possessor was timid, humble, inferior, and worthy only of abuse and peremptory correction.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Bernadette	She saw him for the first time, and stopped abruptly, and scarlet waves ran over her white face. Her green eyes were blazing with an ardor and anger he never guessed she was capable of, and her mouth was parted. [MASK] was still howling threats on the floor, and struggling to rise.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Harry	“Now, then, your lordship is very concerned with the vassals—is that the word?—all at once. Are you not the one who told me that [MASK] was nothing to you, and that you wished to be rid of him?
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Joseph	The wooden walls of the coach were thick with filth and the accumulations of soot, dirt and smoke, and tobacco stains. The door of the latrine banged persistently and each breath of wind carried the effluvium into the coach. [MASK] looked about him with dull and sunken eyes.
<name>John</name>	John	Joseph	She had retained the figure of her girlhood, graceful and lissome, and [MASK] thought she still looked like a young woman though the fine silky pale hair was more silver than blond now, and her complexion had faded. But her green eyes were pure and steadfast and calm.
<name>Almanzo</name>	Almanzo	Haroun	“Seven dollars a week and board to work in the fields, but I’m going to drive the hot wagons. That’s what they call ’em.” “They let a young lad like you drive those wagons?” [MASK] stood up as tall as he could, which was not very tall.
<name>Waldo</name>	Waldo	Joseph	I, myself, believe he laughs. After all, contemplating the world with any insight must convince one that it is absurd, and the rascals know it.” This was a new thought for [MASK]. But, he said to himself, I cannot laugh.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Katherine	“That would be rude, wouldn’t it?” He looked about the crowded gaudy room which had once been [MASK]’s, and he remembered the night of her death. “Go to your tea. Your father will be here only an hour or so before you return.
<name>Callum</name>	Callum	Joseph	His skin was withered and deeply lined, and he possessed few teeth and those like fangs and stained with tobacco juice. He could have been aged from thirty to fifty. His impression on [MASK] was of a creature of witless ferocity.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Joseph	The fire of the approaching sunset ignited tall mirror-like windows with its own color, and slate roofs glimmered and occasionally a red brick chimney emitted a feather or two of soft gray smoke. It was very silent and full of a peace which [MASK] could no longer feel.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Joseph	That means a Marxist, doesn’t it, a Socialist?” “Well, not exactly,” said [MASK], leaning back in his stiff office chair and studying his son. “An anarchist really means a man who wishes to destroy all rulers.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Rory	It rose abruptly from the bricked street, was close to its neighbors, with a dank garden in the rear. The furniture, to [MASK], was gloomy and dull, with brass pulls and dark velvet seats and glimmering tops to the tables.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Joseph	He was pale and smooth of countenance, with his very large light blue eyes beguiling and coaxing—(except when he was with [MASK], and then they became doubtful and a little glaucous)—the most aristocratic and perfect features, a beautiful smiling mouth with fine teeth, and an air of impeccable breeding and elegance.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Bernadette	So did her father, who agreed with her.) [MASK] went to one of the windows beside the doors and watched her mother’s piteously thin and fragile figure moving with slow difficulty across the lawns. The girl shook her head with amused exasperation.
<name>Henrietta</name>	Henrietta	Elizabeth	Once he said to her, “There are times when I can hardly believe you are a woman!” To which [MASK] would reply wryly, “I never believed that intelligence was a matter of sex, though that is the delusion of many.”
<name>Seamus</name>	Seamus	Daniel	He would provide for his family, and no more would they be hunted like vermin and despised and execrated for their Faith, and thrown from their land to die on the highways of exposure and hunger. “Ah, and it is a land for free men,” [MASK] had written in his careful hand.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Regina	So he said in so quiet a voice that [MASK] could hardly hear him, “Go, and go to hell, you slut. Go, the both of you. You weren’t worth a year of my life. You weren’t worth even one hour—either of you.”
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Kevin	A crowd of reporters, kept back by police, stood at a distance snapping photographs. [MASK] was a hero. Though only a civilian, an observer, he had “braved” danger to report honestly to his countrymen, and so was a hero.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Elizabeth	But I have to know the truth. My daughter is upstairs, probably dying, and I want to know who told her the thing which almost killed her, and drove her to this.” [MASK] turned slowly to him and audibly caught her breath and her eyes were green stone.
<name>Regina</name>	Regina	Timothy	[MASK] did not see the face of a woman of fifty-five, but the face of the young Regina, beautiful beyond believing, with that shining regard which was so moving and touching, and the mass of glossy black hair.
<name>Rearden</name>	Rearden	Harry	There were many who had said that he was the criminal agent of a powerful criminal, and [MASK] had heard this often, and it had not vexed him. “What is a criminal?” he had asked a reporter once, with unusual heat.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Elizabeth	Sometimes they would sit like this for hours, he reading his books or newspapers and she reading also, and they would not speak, but the companionship was like one heart, one body, content, rich, contained. He lived, he would think, only for these occasions with [MASK].
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Rory	He hardly touched the wine, which [MASK] drank with gusto, his ruddy face becoming even more ruddy. From time, to time his father studied him acutely if not openly. The fires crackled; the scent of roast beef and Yorkshire pudding and kidney pie was comforting.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Rory	[MASK] had never really pitied his powerful father before but all at once he pitied him so profoundly that he was shaken. He promised himself then that he would do as much as he could to please his father—but not overtly. Their quarrels would be private.
<name>Estella</name>	Estella	Rory	Just don’t stop loving me! Just go to your father and remember I am here, waiting. [MASK], I’d die for you. And isn’t that something I should be ashamed of? Never mind. Kiss me.”
<name>Clayton</name>	Clayton	Joseph	[MASK] was not accustomed to mourning the wickedness of his fellows, for he was innured to it, but he felt a surly rage against what he saw now and what he suspected had already been done in other communities.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Joe	Again she shook her head hopelessly. She could not speak of the great love in her soul, her great and humble acceptance and joy in that acceptance, for it would only infuriate her brother more. She said at last, “I must go, dearest [MASK].
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Joseph	He reached it just as a train in the station, with its gigantic funnel and blinking headlight, was shrilly sounding its bell and letting off painful shrieks of steam. Its wheels were already grinding as [MASK] leaped aboard the last coach.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Bernadette	The gaslight glared down pitilessly, and there was still no sound. Yet here was a house which had begun to prepare for a party. Who had sent the guests away? How could there be such abandonment here? [MASK]’s wailing sobs echoed through the vast hall.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Joseph	“Except the police,” said [MASK]. “Yeh,” said the fat man, suddenly and sharply scrutinizing the boy again. “’Cept the po-leese. Ain’t likely to bother you, though. Just drive sober and straight.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Joe	“I’m always kind, that I am, to folks who work for me, [MASK]. But there’s a limit. You get familiar like with them and first thing you know they’re running you and you not running them.
<name>Wemmick</name>	Wemmick	Joseph	He was elated with his sudden intuition and insisted on [MASK] joining him, in the study, for a glass of brandy. “Yes, sir,” he said, “a man don’t want something for somebody else unless he thinks of himself in the same hole.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Daniel	“It’s afraid, I am, that he was always the man,” said [MASK] and his gaiety left his face and he looked earnestly at his older son, and with a curious sad respect mixed with self-reproach.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Luane	“What of [MASK]? How is she living?” “She’s still living in the slave quarters. I gave her money. I brought four hundred dollars with me. I told her you sent it. I said you wanted her to come North, any way she could, and join you.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Joseph	It was then, for the first time in his life, that [MASK] felt the absolute desire to kill, to demolish, to destroy, another man, and it was like a sweet if frightful exultation in him. Kill or be killed! something sang in his ear.
<name>Pa</name>	Pa	Joseph	“You should never have joined them in the first place, Pa.” “Idiot,” [MASK] had replied, and he was smiling again. “Without them I’d really not be what I am. And what I am is what I have lived for, all the days of my life.”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Rory	“[MASK], you never exactly lie, but often you don’t exactly not lie, either. You are a very wily Irishman. You tell people only what you want them to know, and not a word more or less, and let them make of it what they will.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Rory	“I had to break it easy to the old boy. I told him that I was practically engaged to a chit of a Bostonian girl. of fairly good family, and of some mediocre intelligence, and sometimes pretty.” “[MASK], behave yourself.
<name>Thrax</name>	Thrax	Tim	The Cabinet quakes where he walks. He’s got a Presence, [MASK], a real Presence. An old warrior. And he hates civil- ians, especially senators who dispute his military budgets. Haven’t you ever heard of him?”
<name>He</name>	He	Rory	Her world was herself, foremost. All things and people orbited about her. She accepted this fact with complacency, and never questioned it. So long as [MASK] did not look directly at her he was unaware of her charm, her mysterious magic and fascination.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Elizabeth	Her mouth spread in a grin of delight and her eyes glittered with glee at the thought that she was wounding and injuring [MASK]. “He was forced to marry you and adopt your brat, because your father had more political power than he did!
<name>God</name>	God	Marjorie	He controlled himself, but he was covered with sweat and his color had left him, and his body trembled and he said in himself: [MASK]. But, in self-preservation he had already taught himself not to think too deeply about himself or anyone else, or anything at all.
<name>Lawrence</name>	Lawrence	Harry	But in the main the average man does not. So, I asked [MASK], what in the hell do we live for. For our daily bread, and endless work, and fighting, and marrying and having children, and disappointment, or worse?
<name>Altamont</name>	Altamont	Joseph	There was nothing so relentless as a man who had endured all the evil that the world can inflict, and who had turned against that world. “I have ordered ham and a bird for you, Senator,” said [MASK], “and beer and plum pudding.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Joseph	Then, for the first time, she had begun to cry, and the doctor nodded with sympathetic satisfaction. [MASK] held her hand, and it was quiet at last, though trembling. She saw only her husband.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Joseph	The passage was open to the night and wind and soot and cinders and smoke poured onto it and [MASK] coughed spasmodically as he clung precariously to his handhold. “You should never let go of what belongs to you,” he added, in a strangled voice.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Joseph	She stared at him in the warm dusky light, which flowed upwards from below, and suddenly her face flushed and an overpowering emotion ran over it. Never had [MASK] appeared to her so desirable, so strong, so virile, so young as she was young, and so full of health and vitality.
<name>Thackeray</name>	Thackeray	Joseph	You own my paper at the banks. You will demand payment on that paper. That will reduce me to penury. I thought my bankers—were gentlemen.” [MASK] said, “Bankers are never gentlemen.”
<name>Stoner</name>	Stoner	Joseph	“Good,” said [MASK]. “And now, coming down to your campaign for congressman. The people, on the one hand, will tolerate or even glorify a despot, but they are a little prudish about politicians being too overt concerning the beds of other men’s wives.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Rory	She wrote to [MASK] that night, her young face drawn and wizened and dry: I have come to the conclusion, after a lot of thought, my dear, that our marriage was doomed from the start. We both deceived our fathers, and so invited calamity.
<name>Grimsby</name>	Grimsby	Harry	“He preferred to die. Why?” “Perhaps he was tired of living. Millions of us reach that stage.” “But [MASK] was a full-blooded, healthy man, not capricious, not complex.”
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Bernadette	She nodded again, her face still covered. She could speak a little more clearly, though her voice was still muffled and faint. “[MASK] was told— what everyone else believes—but she knew right from the first that you are the son of her father.
<name>Seamus</name>	Seamus	Joseph	[MASK] had actually laughed. “And for how long, may I ask, boyo? Don’t be a fool,” he had repeated. “I expect much of you, you spalpeen, in spite of yout innocent questions which aren’t innocent at all.
<name>He</name>	He	Joseph	He was more lithe, and quicker. He averted his head just as the murderous fist lashed at his face, and the blow passed his ear with a whistling sound and the great clenched hand crashed loudly into the wall. At that instant [MASK] freed himself and stepped back.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Regina	[MASK] went to her own room and knelt on her prie-dieu before the Crucifix on the wall, and she cried silently and tried to pray but there was only pain in her now and a last remembrance of her brother’s face.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Harry	Your life has been so dreadful, so barren, and you have known betrayal and misery. You are wary now, and who can blame you? [MASK] would have told you, but he was afraid, for you are no gentle character, my darling.
<name>Napoleon</name>	Napoleon	Caesar	“We are patient.” Another gentleman said, “Republics never survive, for their people do not like freedom but prefer to be led and guided and flattered and seduced into slavery by a benevolent, or not so benevolent, despot. They want to worship [MASK].
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Joseph	They pretended to despise him, but they were proud that a senator—something like a member of the House of Lords, [MASK] had thought—would be from their town and so add polish and pride to it.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Sean	His face became even more terrible, and [MASK] became even more frantic about his “wrongs.” “You must have hated us! Yes, you’ve provided for us, and it must have killed you, almost. You deserted us when we needed you most, as little children.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Joseph	He was like a workman who needs to use tar in his work, but who, on returning home, cleansed himself of it and did not see or smell it. There were times when he seemed much older than [MASK], and times when he seemed only a youth.
<name>Timothy</name>	Timothy	Joe	He said to the company, “[MASK], here, this miserable young spalpeen, is eddicated. He reads books. Now, lads, don’t hold that agin him!” and he held up his pink palm in a parody of defensiveness. The gentlemen dutifully laughed.
<name>Archer</name>	Archer	Courtney	It was still not quite half-past seven, but as he got out of the carriage [MASK], glancing up at the windows of his mother’s rooms, saw that the draperies had been drawn aside and the lace curtains were blowing gently in the silken breeze.
<name>John</name>	John	Joseph	I—I went in, and she wanted to kiss and hold me—I couldn’t, I couldn’t—I was so afraid—” [MASK] took his own handkerchief and wiped the girl’s streaming face and eyes and she sobbed brokenly and clutched him again and convulsively clung to him.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Courtney	It was only in the country, anywhere, that a man felt true identity and was part of something. [MASK] took off his hat and let the warming wind ruffle the hair that was so like his mother’s, pale, fine and thick.
<name>Snufkin</name>	Snufkin	Joseph	There would be no danger in that, but to [MASK] the whole world was dangerous and should not be informed. He added, “I am a gardener’s helper.” “Hum,” said the mayor.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Joseph	One of his hands had fallen on [MASK]’s knee. The iron wheels of the train rumbled and clattered; the engine howled and pounded. The bright air outside was frequently dulled by smoke and steam. Most of the men in the crowded hot coach still slept, snoring and grunting.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Haroun	He hated this bloated man who could do nothing but smoke and stare while [MASK] bled and lay in a half-faint on the plates, and was choking and coughing between muffled sobs. The stranger suddenly shouted in a voice louder than the uproar in the coaches and the howling of the train.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Joseph	[MASK] looked at the flag twirling and tugging in the wind on the wharf. Now nothing was on the wharf but piles of freight and seamen pushing barrows and carts, and the silent and rain-soaked crowd of wretched folk still hoping and praying numbly for the sight of a beloved lost face on the ship.
<name>Antonio</name>	Antonio	Rory	[MASK] felt that unique and desperate impotence men feel who try to enlighten their people to the truth, and finally understand that the truth is one thing which will never be believed. It was a hopeless impotence. He had never experienced it before, and it shook him profoundly.
<name>Jimmie</name>	Jimmie	Rory	So [MASK] understood, with good-humored cynicism, why his teachers did not directly attack the owners of great wealth. They were the tools of the “Elite.” It was not against the wealthy that Socialism was directed, but against the masses of the people, and their liberty.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Elizabeth	The room was already hot, the increasing light striking through the heavy lace curtains, but [MASK] felt cold. She said, “It was so long ago and nothing has happened to you—or yours—has it? There is no accounting for dreams.”
<name>LaFollette</name>	LaFollette	Rory	“You don’t expect us to report this seriously, do you, Senator?” asked a young man who appeared to have taken the leadership. “I had hoped you would take me seriously, for I have told you the truth,” said [MASK].
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Joseph	For it’s very thin and sickly you are, with your cold, and if you fall ill who then will care for the little ones?” It was an artful plea and [MASK] glanced at the parcel on the chair and tried to prevent himself from shivering.
<name>Alonso</name>	Alonso	Joseph	“It is a mortal sin even to speak of that!” “Mortal sin or not, that I shall do,” said [MASK], and the priest, with dread, knew that he was not speaking as a child but as a man.
<name>Lucia</name>	Lucia	Joseph	Destroyed you, my sister.” But she was shaking her beautiful head slowly. “No, that is not true. No one even suggested to me that I had a vocation—” But [MASK] had burst into harsh and raucous laughter.
<name>her</name>	her	Elizabeth	He made the preliminary motion of discarding her hand, so immeasurable was his enigmatic and complicated rage. But she clung to it, and he looked into her eyes and he knew he could not reject [MASK] even with the slightest gesture. “Yes,” he said.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Joseph	“Come,” said the priest, and led the way down the deck to the end near the door where they could have a small privacy. Once there [MASK] said in a rough voice, “You did not see my Dad.”
<name>never</name>	never	Joseph	Never was there a holy war, [MASK], never a just war, despite all the slogans and the banners. But men love war and though they deny it vehemently, as I hear daily, it is rooted in their Nature, alas.”
