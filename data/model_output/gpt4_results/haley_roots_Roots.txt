<name>Yacub</name>	Yacub	Kunta	And [MASK] flinched for one repeated offender when the elders set a date and time for him to receive a public flogging of thirty-nine lashes across his bare back by his most recently wronged husband, according to the ancient Moslem rule of “forty, save one.”
<name>Yessuh</name>	Yessuh	Yassuh	“We hear you’re figurin’ to open a blacksmith shop here in town,” one said. “[MASK]. Been lookin’ fo’ de bes’ spot to build it. Was thinkin’ maybe dat empty lot nex’ to de sawmill if’n
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Kunta	Turning the word over and over in his mind, he resisted the temptation to speak it aloud, even just for himself, for that would have been improper. Yes, that had to be it! Exhilarated with his good luck in such a short while, [MASK] hurried back along the fencerow to the cabin.
<name>Mammy</name>	Mammy	Kizzy	He swear dat boy was tellin’ dem hens all ’bout fights gwine be winned by de baby chicks de hens ’bout to hatch.” “Do Lawd!” said [MASK], her eyes bathing in the sight of her approaching son.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Uriah	Hearing it, [MASK] came boiling up off his cot, his nightshirt flapping; he raced first for the pigpen shouting, “01’ pigs quit gruntin’, you’s free!” He coursed to the barn, “Of cows, quit givin’ milk, you’s free!”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Cato	The fiddler was a study of excitement. “I didn’t say nothin’ jes’ a month back when [MASK] axed how much I had saved up, but den I was jes’ a few dollars short—an now I jes’ done made it wid dis trip!
<name>Kunta</name>	Kunta	Kunta	Stepping back, the white-haired one, beckoning another toubob, jabbed his finger at four men, one of them [MASK], and two of the girls. The toubob looked shocked, pointing at the others in a beseeching manner. But the white- haired one shook his head firmly.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Bell	But finally he did manage to mention it, and [MASK] promptly said, “Ain’t but two places everybody’s headin’ for, heab’n or hell, and where you goin’, dat’s yo’ business!” And she would say no more about it.
<name>Wilbur</name>	Wilbur	Kunta	Exasperated, the brown one got up and brought from a corner the oddly shaped box that [MASK] had seen him arrive with. Opening it, he lifted out an even more oddly shaped light brown wooden thing with a slender black neck and four taut, thin strings running almost its length.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Kunta	But [MASK] felt even more hounded than his herd. Every time he sat down to sort out the meaning of these changes in his life, there seemed to be something he had to do, someplace he had to go.
<name>Kintu</name>	Kintu	Kunta	Wiping the sweat from his brow, it seemed to [MASK] that his people were always enduring one hardship or another—something uncomfortable or difficult, or frightening, or threatening to life itself. He thought about the burning, hot days and the cold nights that followed them.
<name>Handy</name>	Handy	Bell	He went on to say that haste was essential lest their child hear first some name that the massa might decide upon for her. “Now I sees!” said [MASK]. “Dese Africanisms you so full of ain’t gon’ do nothin’ but make trouble.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	George	’Cause I can tell he don’t like it neither! He don’t like nobody roun’ him all de time. He done tol’ me he ruther be by hisself.” [MASK] wished he could think of something to say that would calm her down.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Cato	So wid ten, fi’teen years o’ savin’, if’n he real lucky, a hire-out nigger can maybe give his massa de money to buy hisself free.” “Dat why you keeps so busy fiddlin’?”’ asked [MASK].
<name>Sundiata</name>	Sundiata	Kunta	Everyone else came trading behind, singing and applauding, as the musicians led them out in a snaking line beyond the village. And when they made a turn around the travelers’ tree, [MASK] and his kafo dashed ahead, formed their own parade, and then trooped back and forth
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Bell	Dusk was descending before he could bring himself to go home. When he opened the front door and walked in, there was no sound of response from [MASK] in the bedroom. She could be asleep, he thought, leaning over to light a candle on the table.
<name>Kunta</name>	Kunta	Kunta	During [MASK]’s first few moons on sentry duty, rains ago, he remembered snatching at his spear if so much as a rat went rustling through the grass. Every shadow seemed a monkey, every monkey a panther, and every panther a toubob, until his eyes and ears became seasoned to his task.
<name>Jed</name>	Jed	Luther	An’ it’s time to do some fiddlin’!” Then [MASK] hummed and sang a new song he had heard in the county seat. The catchiness of it was easy to pick up, and soon others were singing it, and still others beating time with sticks.
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Kunta	Whatever their reasons for leaving him out, he felt it was just as well. Though he wished them luck in whatever they might decide to do, [MASK] didn’t believe that a rebellion could ever succeed against such overwhelming odds.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Tom	Leas’ de man keep talkin’ an’ massa jes’ noddin’ an’ noddin’.” “Awright, honey,” said [MASK]. “Don’ be scairt. You git on back now.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Kunta	As she spoke, [MASK] had begun digging into the heaping plateful of food she had set before him, while he marveled at the very sight of the roast beef, baked ham, turkey, chicken, and duck she was now busily arranging on big platters waiting to be served.
<name>Chicken</name>	Chicken	George	“[MASK],” the massa said, “I got somethin’ hard to tell you.” He paused, groping for words. “Don’t know how to say it hardly. But you already know I ain’t had nowhere near the money folks thinks I did.
<name>Kunta</name>	Kunta	Kunta	While they were dancing, [MASK] and the other men would even whoop out hoarsely their anticipation of slaughter. But to his great relief, when the dancing ended and he could again contain himself, he saw that the unsuspecting toubob only grinned with happiness.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Kunta	[MASK] had never imagined there were so many wrestling holds, nor how effectively they could work, if used correctly. And the champions kept drumming into the boys’ ears that it was knowledge and expertness and not strength that made the difference between being an ordinary wrestler and a champion.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Tom	Finally riding back to the Murray plantation, [MASK] was surprised, and unsettled, that he couldn’t rid his mind of her. Lying in his bed that night, it hit him like a bolt that he hadn’t even gotten her name.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Mammy	“How come dey done dat, [MASK]?” “He near ’bout kilt some nigger catchers.” “Catchin’ niggers fo’ what?” “Well, niggers dat had runned ’way.” “What dey was runnin’ from?”
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Bell	Ransacking his brain for something—anything—to say, he wished wildly that he was walking with the gardener or the fiddler, or practically anyone except [MASK]. Finally it was she who broke the silence. She said abruptly, “De white folks done swore in dat Gen’l Washington for de Pres’dent.”
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Irene	[MASK] did an incredible range of things across the winter months as her pregnancy advanced. Her hands seemed all but able to wreak a magic that soon was being enjoyed within the big house as well as in every slave-row cabin.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Kunta	Once, from a distance, [MASK] had glimpsed her, a bony creature the color of a toad’s underbelly, as she walked around cutting off some flowers among the vines and bushes that grew alongside the big house.
<name>Kunta</name>	Kunta	Toby	“Looka here, he can talk! But I’m tellin’ you, boy, you got to forgit all dat African talk. Make white folks mad an’ scare niggers. Yo’ name [MASK]. Dey calls me Fiddler.” He pointed to himself.
<name>Kunta</name>	Kunta	Kunta	The new pair of toubob stood just within the doorway holding short clubs in one hand and small metal objects in the other. The other two moved along [MASK]’s side of the wall unlocking the iron cuffs. When anyone cried out or scuffled, he was struck with a short, thick, leather strap.
<name>Alonso</name>	Alonso	Kunta	That night, when he was alone, [MASK] spent hours carefully arranging into piles of twelve all of the multicolored pebbles that he had dropped faithfully into his gourd with each new moon. He was so stunned by what the stones finally told him that the gardener never learned the answer to his question.
<name>she</name>	she	Kizzy	As she flailed her arms in agony and arched her back to shake him off, he banged her head against the floor, again, again, again, then began slapping her—more and more excitedly—until [MASK] felt her dress being snatched upward, her un-
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Kunta	[MASK], meanwhile, sat in his cabin feeling as if he were two people, one of them completely humiliated by the foolish and ridiculous thing the other one had just done—and felt almost deliriously happy and excited about it. What made him do it?
<name>Zora</name>	Zora	Matilda	“Ain’t many seem like dey wants to talkwid massa. Deyjes’ speaks or waves quick an’ keeps goin’ like he got de plague.” “Yeah, de plague o’ dem knowin’ now he po’,” said [MASK].
<name>Atreyu</name>	Atreyu	Kunta	But when the boy sprang, the bird managed to escape his clutching hands, frantically beating its stubby wings just enough to raise its big body over the brushtops—and the boy went leaping after it in hot pursuit, soon disappearing from sight. [MASK] and the others were thunderstruck.
<name>Jeff</name>	Jeff	Kunta	His glance flicked among the faces around him. “Jes’ watch what I tell you—it’s gon’ be worse’n it was for us niggers.” [MASK] and the old gardener sat later talking quietly. “You seen aplenty since you been here.
<name>Tayo</name>	Tayo	Kunta	“We’re close now,” [MASK] said, and he wished he had the drum he was going to make, so that he could signal ahead to his friends. With the sinking of the sun, they finally reached the clay pits—and there were the three young men.
<name>Big</name>	Big	Ashford	“You know white folks ain’t gwine give dat up.” “Not widdout a fight,” said [MASK]. “An’ dey’s lot’s more dem dan us. So how we gwine win?”
<name>Kunta</name>	Kunta	Kunta	It made him even more furious to recall that her eyes had seemed warm despite his show of anger. One day, after [MASK] had been there for nearly three weeks, the toubob motioned for him to sit up as he began to unwrap the bandaging.
<name>Brer</name>	Brer	Kunta	[MASK] was lying on his mattress thinking about what he had heard and seen when suddenly there came a rapping at his door. “Who dat?” he demanded, astonished, for only twice had anyone ever come to his hut in all the time he’d lived there.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	George	“I been talkin’ wid free niggers when me an’ massa go to cities,” [MASK] went on. “Dey say de free niggers up Nawth is de bes’ off. Say dem lives ’mongst one ’nother in dey own houses, an’ gits good jobs.
<name>Kunta</name>	Kunta	Kunta	Pointing toward the hut’s door, she pantomimed a tall man walking in, then giving something to drink to a moaning person, who then broadly smiled as if feeling much better. [MASK] made no sign that he understood her meaning that the tall toubob was a man of medicine.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Mingo	he exclaimed, holding out his cupped hands. As he stared at the pile of crumpled one-dollar bills and more in coins, [MASK] said laughingly, “You take de money to massa. Do y’all both good!”
<name>Tharn</name>	Tharn	Kunta	Soon after the dawn showed again through the square opening, [MASK] heard the strange horn blow once more; then came the smell of food cooking, and the voices of the black ones hurrying back and forth. Then the man he despised returned, bringing new food and water.
<name>Prissy</name>	Prissy	Matilda	“You two wenches ready right now to start breedin’ pickaninnies worth four hundred an’ up apiece.” His glance fell on [MASK]. “Even if you gittin’ pretty old, you said you know how to cook.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Kunta	She sat in bed hugging the doll close, rocking it back and forth, exclaiming with her eyes half shut, “Jes’ so pretty!” [MASK] left without a word and stormed across the yard to the barn.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Kunta	But by the time he reached the other side of the field, the “snow” had stopped and even begun to melt away. Hiding his amazement, [MASK] composed himself and nodded silently to his black partner, who was waiting by the broken fence.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Irene	“Ain’t hardly nothin’ I seed or heared make it look no better,” he concluded. [MASK] tried a futile effort to make them all feel at least a little better. “Ain’t never been free, so ain’t gwine miss it nohow,” she said.
<name>Kunta</name>	Kunta	Tom	From when the equipment had been bought to establish a blacksmith shop, the massa somehow had always seemed to respect [MASK]’s quiet reserve, along with his obvious competence at blacksmithing, which brought in an increasing flow of customers.
<name>Kunta</name>	Kunta	Kunta	As usual, [MASK] said nothing, but he had seen and done enough during his quarter-century years as a slave to know that the life of a field hand was the life of a farm animal, and he would rather die than be responsible for sentencing his daughter to such a fate.
<name>Kunta</name>	Kunta	Kunta	In the hut’s doorway stood a she toubob with red hair. Then, dashing past her, came three small toubob shouting and waving toward the rolling box. Catching sight of [MASK], they shrieked with laughter and pointed; he stared at them as if they were hyena cubs.
<name>Dinah</name>	Dinah	Bell	Peering hard at the tip of her forefinger as it moved the paper’s front page, [MASK] said finally, “Here where de House of Burgesses done met again.” She studied the print closely. “Done passed a new law ’bout taxes.”
<name>Horace</name>	Horace	Kunta	What a heartwarming—if somewhat belated—reward for a lifetime of toil, thought [MASK] bitterly. He remembered the gardener telling him that he had come to the massa’s big house as a strong young stablehand, which he had remained for many years until he was kicked badly by a horse.
<name>Taran</name>	Taran	Kunta	CHAPTER 19 In the first light of dawn, [MASK] came awake, springing onto his feet. Standing beside his pallet was a queer old woman demanding in a high, cracked voice to know what had happened to the food she had sent him for two moons ago.
<name>Kunta</name>	Kunta	Kizzy	Your name is [MASK].” It was done, as it had been done with all of the Kinte ancestors, as it had been done with himself, as it would have been done with this infant had she been born in her ancestral homeland.
<name>John</name>	John	Kunta	He saw that much forest had been freshly cut, and stumps grubbed up, and in some places, as the rolling box lurched along, [MASK] saw and smelled grayish smoke rising from where dry brush was being burned.
<name>Kendi</name>	Kendi	Kunta	All, like [MASK], were growing fast, laughing and squealing as they ran after each other around the giant trunk of the village baobab, played hide-and-seek, and scattered the dogs and chickens into masses of fur and feathers.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Kunta	“Don’t know what to say,” said [MASK]. “How ’bout ’gratulations?” “Jes’ seem too good to be true.” “It true awright. I done counted it a thousan’ times. Even got ’nough extra to buy me a cardboard suitcase!”
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Binta	He also took special care to stay clear of any known place where [MASK] might be, telling himself that although she was his mother, he would show her no special favors; that, indeed, he would deal firmly with her if she ever made it necessary.
<name>Alhaji</name>	Alhaji	Kunta	Early one morning, returning from a night of sentry duty out in the groundnut fields, [MASK] saw hurrying along the trail some distance ahead of him three young men whom he could tell were about his own age, and whom he knew had to be travelers from somewhere else.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Maria	I done already tol’ eve’ybody—an’ was fixin’ to tell you—to come squeeze in de cabin dis cornin’ Sadday night an’ I’se gwine tell dis chile de fam’ly story jes’ like I done wid [MASK], when she born.”
<name>Teacake</name>	Teacake	Matilda	[MASK] paused for effect. “Twixt three-fo’ thousan’ dollars.” “ Wheeeew!” he whistled. “I is?” Watching his expression change, she sensed that she had never observed him grow more serious in all their twelve years together.
<name>He</name>	He	Kunta	Finally, he must acquaint himself with the surrounding countryside so that when he escaped again, he would know where to look for better hiding places. Though he often lay awake half the night, restless with such thoughts, [MASK] always awoke before the first crowing of the cocks, which always aroused the other fowl.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Kunta	Jerking suddenly awake, [MASK] lay very still for a long moment, trying to figure out what had happened. Then, moving his hand down between his legs, he felt the warm wetness on himself—and on his bed.
<name>Warrick</name>	Warrick	Kunta	No one walked behind [MASK] any longer, and not often did anyone choose to walk beside him either, for his kafo mates were occupied almost every waking hour with their new duties and—perhaps, like him—with their own broodings about what had so far proved to be the dubious rewards of manhood.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Kunta	[MASK] nodded. “You a lucky nigger, what you is,” the fiddler went on. “Jes’ piddlin’ ’roun’ eve’yday in dat garden. Ain’t hardly nobody got a job dat sof’ ’cept on plantations whole lot bigger’n dis.”
<name>Sarny</name>	Sarny	Matilda	Yo’ baby was a gal—but she dead.” CHAPTER 113 he late afternoon of the 1863 New Year’s Day, [MASK] came almost flying into the slave row. “Y’all seen dat white man jes’ rid in here? Y’all ain’t gon’ b'leeve!
<name>Obi</name>	Obi	Kunta	They simply looked at each other. The man’s face and eyes were expressionless. And so was his voice when he said, “What you want?” [MASK] had no idea what he was saying. “You one a dem African niggers.”
<name>Anansi</name>	Anansi	Kunta	He paused in his monologue, as if expecting some kind of reaction, but [MASK] just sat there watching and listening impassively and fingering his saphie charm. “See what I means? You got to put away all dat stuff,” said the brown one, pointing to the charm.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Irene	“I jes’ run up here a minute. Better git back to workin’, an’ you, too—” He had to know more, at least her name. He asked her. “[MASK],” she said.
<name>Albus</name>	Albus	Kunta	Taking them and nodding his thanks, [MASK] turned them over and over in his hands before deciding to try them on. It felt strange to have such things on his feet, but they fit perfectly—even though the front half of the right shoe was stuffed with cotton.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Kunta	[MASK] knew how he was acting and felt badly, but he couldn’t help himself. He knew that now and then some lucky boy was allowed to share a journey with his father, uncle, or grown-up brother.
<name>Tobias</name>	Tobias	Tom	An’ I know my wife’s going to raise all manners of hell about me just the same as giving y’all away. Hell, that blacksmith boy [MASK] alone is worth a good twenty-five hundred plus he’s making me good money to boot!”
<name>Yussuf</name>	Yussuf	Kunta	“Ah-salakium-salaam!” said [MASK]. He heard a quick muffled movement within, and the door swung open wide. CHAPTER 61 Since they were Africans, neither man showed how much this moment had been awaited by both of them.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Kunta	She had no mate, and she had given [MASK] clear signs of her willingness, if not her anxiety, to get him into much closer quarters than he had ever responded to, although he had thought about it privately.
<name>Kunta</name>	Kunta	Tom	Soon, every day saw slave men, young and old, come riding on mules, or sometimes afoot, bringing broken tools or other items for [MASK] to fix. Some massas or missis sketched decorative items they wanted made for their homes.
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Bell	Other days they would return with such treasures as snail shells, a wren’s nest, or a crusted old arrowhead, all of which they would exhibit gleefully to [MASK] before hiding them somewhere with great secrecy, whereafter they might make mud pies.
<name>Julius</name>	Julius	Tom	As [MASK] busily shod horses and mules and made and repaired tools, he kept his ears strained to hear every possible scrap of the exchanges of talk among the white customers gathered before his shop, and he winced with disappointment at their successive jubilant reports of Confederate triumphs.
<name>Sharon</name>	Sharon	Liza	But his mind, as if on its own, kept on thinking about it. Considering how talkative and smothery [MASK] was, and how he liked to spend a lot of time alone, maybe their being able to see each other just on weekends would be a blessing in disguise.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Kunta	He shook himself and stretched. The muscles hurt, but he felt much better than he had. Kneeling for a few more gulps of water from the spring, [MASK] noticed his reflection in the still surface of the pool—narrow black face with wide eyes and mouth.
<name>Shukhov</name>	Shukhov	Kunta	And now it was done. Perhaps at this very moment, he thought, they might be performing the teriya act in bed with their two widows. [MASK] suddenly sat upright trying to picture what it must be like.
<name>Jed</name>	Jed	Tom	“He’s a pretty fair blacksmith, if I do say so myself,” he said casually. The other man grunted affirmatively. Then he began moving around under the little blacksmithing shed, eyeing the many examples of [MASK]’s craftsmanship that hung from nails and pegs.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Omoro	“But even a king cannot stop the stealings of some people from their villages,” [MASK] continued. “You have known some of those lost from our village, three from among us just within the past few moons, as you know, and you have heard the drumtalk from other villages.”
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Mingo	Tying them onto his rooster’s legs, he remembered [MASK]’s admonition, “not too loose or dey can git looser an’ slide down, an’ not too tight less’n dey numbs an’ cramps his legs.”
<name>Matthew</name>	Matthew	Matthew	Was there anything in the Scriptures about chickens? Vaguely she recalled something—in [MASK], if she wasn’t mistaken—about “a hen gathereth her chickens beneath her wings ...” I must look that up, she told herself.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Bell	He could detect no special harshness in [MASK]’s tone. Grunting noncommittally, he picked up the candle, pushed aside the curtain, and went into the bedroom. In the ruddy glow, he could see that the expression on her face was as adamant as his own.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Massa	“[MASK],” he said quietly, “I was gwine buy us all free! Now all I had gone, an’ you sendin’ me off crost de water somewheres ’way from my wife an’ chilluns besides.
<name>Kunta</name>	Kunta	Kizzy	[MASK] would watch his mouth intently as he said each word, then imitate what she saw with her own lips, repeating it over and over until she got it right. Soon she began pointing to things herself and asking him for their Mandinka names.
<name>Nyam</name>	Nyam	Juffure	The people gasped. But then he slowly began to revive. The evil spirts had been driven out. As he struggled weakly to his knees, [MASK]’s adults—exhausted but relieved—went running off to their huts and soon returned with gifts to press upon him.
<name>Yakari</name>	Yakari	Kunta	Lying there in filth and fever, [MASK] didn’t know if they had been down in the belly of this canoe for two moons or six, or even as long as a rain. The man who had been lying near the vent through which they had counted the days was dead now.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Toby	CHAPTER 62 an een [MASK] passin’ yestiday, hollered at ’im, ‘Hey, drop by an U set awhile, nigger!’ You oughta seen de look he give me, an’ ain’t even spoke! What you reckon it is?”
<name>Wilkes</name>	Wilkes	Holt	She say he beat her bad an’ sol’ us to some nigger trader, an’ Massa [MASK] bought us, what was lucky, ’cause dey’s high-quality folks—” Her eyes narrowed. “Well, leas’ mos’ly.
<name>Kunta</name>	Kunta	Kunta	He didn’t even know if toubob had forests, or if they did, whether he would find in them the signs that a hunter would use. [MASK] told himself that these problems would simply have to be met as they came.
<name>Kunta</name>	Kunta	Kunta	“Four hundred!” “Five!” And the first toubob would shout: “Let’s hear six! Look at him! Works like a mule!” [MASK] shuddered with fear, his face running with sweat, breath tight in his throat.
<name>Kunta</name>	Kunta	Kunta	Lying there, he could smell their cooking and hear their early-night talking and singing and praying, and the horn blowing in the morning. And each day the tall toubob came into the hut, always making [MASK]’s foot hurt as he changed the bandage.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Kunta	Though he had long since been allowed to retire, he demanded every morning that some younger blacks carry him out to the garden, where he would he on his side plucking weeds with gnarled hands among the flowerbeds of his equally old and crippled beloved lifetime missis. And these were the lucky ones, [MASK] knew.
<name>Waziri</name>	Waziri	Mandinkas	Not until they learned that lesson could they undertake the next phase of manhood training: how to be warriors. “You know already that [MASK] fight only if others are warlike,” said the kintango. “But we are the finest warriors if driven to fight.”
<name>Kunta</name>	Kunta	Kunta	In his whitish straw hat, as he spoke to the toubob field boss, he gestured with a long, slender, plaited leather switch, and [MASK] noticed that the toubob “oberseer” grinned and shuffled almost as much as the blacks whenever he was around.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Cato	[MASK] worriedly dispatched the rest of the field hands off to their work, telling them that he and the fiddler would join them shortly; the fiddler had wisely volunteered to help with the fieldwork ever since his income from playing for dances had fallen off.
