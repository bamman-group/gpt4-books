<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Christian	“I don’t. That’s the point. I feel about punishment the way you feel about my touching you.” His entire demeanor changes in a nanosecond. Gone is playful [MASK], and he stands staring at me as if I’ve slapped him.
<name>smile</name>	smile	Ana	Doing my best to ignore the irrational wariness he inspires, I launch into my carefully prepared speech, conscious that a rosy flush is spreading across my cheeks. I look at both of them, remembering the Katherine Kava-nagh Successful Interviewing Technique lecture: Maintain eye contact, [MASK]!
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Christian	My eyes flicker unwillingly open for a split second. I’m in bed and someone is nuzzling my ear. “Wake up, baby,” he whispers, and the effect of his sweet voice spreads like warm melted caramel through my veins. It's [MASK].
<name>someone</name>	someone	Christian	I close my eyes, imagining his pain, and I can’t begin to comprehend it. I shudder as I remember that I may have divulged too much. What have I confessed to [MASK] in my sleep? What secrets have I revealed?
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Christian	“They need lubrication. Suck,” he orders, his voice soft. The balls are cold, smooth, surprisingly heavy, and metallic tasting. My dry mouth pools with saliva as my tongue explores the unfamiliar objects. [MASK]’s gaze does not leave mine.
<name>He</name>	He	Elliot	He’s amused and exasperated at once. “Maybe. We’ll see after Sunday.” And I press “end” on the phone. [MASK] stands and admires his handiwork. He has replugged our TV into the satellite system in our Pike Place Market apartment.
<name>Ana</name>	Ana	Anastasia	“I’m going to take you from behind, [MASK],” he murmurs, and with his other hand, he grasps my hair at the nape in a fist and pulls gently, holding me in place. I cannot move my head.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Christian	I shatter again into tiny fragments, and [MASK] stills, finally letting go, silently finding his release. He collapses on top of me, breathing hard. “How nice was that?” he asks through his gritted teeth. Oh my.
<name>Elena</name>	Elena	Christian	Which reminds me . . . “Why did you send me the books, [MASK]?” My voice is soft. He puts down his cutlery and regards me intently, his eyes burning with some unfathomable emotion. Holy crap—my mouth dries.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Christian	“So, you’re mad at me for having dinner with an old friend.” [MASK] turns his burning, wary gaze to me, lifting my hand to his lips and kissing each knuckle gently. Jeez, he wants to do this now?
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Ray	I feel kind of dorky.” You look kinda dorky ... My subconscious is at her snarky best. So are you going to introduce [MASK] to the man you’re fucking? She is glaring at me over her wing-shaped spectacles. He’d be so proud.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Penny	Hmm . . . I’d like to do that. The thought comes unbidden into my mind, and my face flames. I bite my lip and stare down at my hands again, not liking where my wayward thoughts are headed. “[MASK] for your thoughts?”
<name>Jesse</name>	Jesse	Taylor	When I turn to face him, he’s staring at me, stupefied with horror. “I need the money that [MASK] got for my Beetle.” My voice is clear and calm, devoid of emotion . . . extraordinary.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Christian	I need a plan. I head back to watch [MASK] move gracefully around his kitchen. “The NDA, does it cover everything?” I ask tentatively. “Why?” He turns and gazes at me while putting the Twinings away. I flush.
<name>him</name>	him	Taylor	He doesn’t seem uncomfortable answering me as he would if he were hiding the truth. He seems genuinely pleased that I’m here ... a warm glow spreads slowly through my veins. He shakes his head and reaches for my hand. I glance nervously at [MASK].
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Anastasia	Yes, I’m angry, especially after everything I told him about the books.. . but then he’d already bought this. Taking my hand, he leads me down the path toward this new acquisition. “[MASK], that Beetle of yours is old and frankly dangerous.
<name>John</name>	John	Bob	[MASK] has volunteered to man the BBQ grill. What is it about men and fire? I ponder as I trail after my mother through the supermarket with the shopping cart. As we browse the raw meat cabinet, my phone rings.
<name>the woman's</name>	the woman's	Kate	An overkeen marketing executive shows us up to the suite—he’s terribly young and very nervous for some reason. I suspect [MASK]’s beauty and commanding manner disarm him, because he’s putty in her hands. The rooms are elegant, understated, and opulently furnished.
<name>her</name>	her	Kate	“He came here to fuck me, that’s all.” “Who said romance was dead?” she whispers, horrified. I’ve shocked [MASK]. I didn’t think that was possible. I shrug apologetically. “He uses sex as a weapon.”
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Christian	Jeez . . . get a room. I stare at my feet, embarrassed. I glance up at [MASK], and he’s watching me intently. I narrow my eyes at him. Why can’t you kiss me like that?
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Christian	“I’ll give you some room now that you’re up.” [MASK] exits toward the living area, and I wander into the bathroom. I have needs to attend to, and I want a quick wash.
<name>he</name>	he	Grey	he mutters. We cross the expansive, bustling lobby of the hotel toward the entrance, but [MASK] avoids the revolving door, and 1 wonder if that’s because he’d have to let go of my hand. Outside, it’s a mild May Sunday.
<name>Bella</name>	Bella	Anastasia	“I thought of you when I tasted it. How did you get to be so knowledgeable about wine?” “I’m not knowledgeable, [MASK], I just know what I like.” His eyes shine, almost silver, and it makes me flush.
<name>Anastasia</name>	Anastasia	Christian	“How are you getting home?” “I’ll find a way.” This conversation is not going how I expected. “Which bar are you in?” “Why did you send me the books, [MASK]?” “Anastasia, where are you?
<name>John</name>	John	Christian	[MASK] asks, his voice soft and full of concern. “No. I’m not tired.” I feel strangely energized. It’s been so good to talk—I don’t want to stop. “What do you want to do?” he asks.
<name>Daddy</name>	Daddy	Christian	I put my head in my hands. I just don’t understand. [MASK] reenters the room. I can’t look him in the eye. I stare down at my hands. “I found some baby oil. Let me rub it into your behind.”
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Grey	[MASK] is back, startling me. I go crimson. I was just thinking about running my fingers through your hair and wondering if it would feel soft to touch. I shake my head. He’s carrying a tray, which he sets down on the small, round birch-veneer table.
<name>Lisa</name>	Lisa	Kate	But that’s five miles, and I don’t think I’ll be able to run one mile, let alone five, and, of course, he might turn me down, which would be beyond humiliating. [MASK] is walking from her car as I head out of the door.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Anastasia	Not taking his eyes off mine, he reaches around and undoes the top button on my jeans and the zipper. “I’m going to have you in the bathroom, [MASK].” Leaning down, he kisses my neck. I move my head to one side to give him easier access.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Christian	The problem is, I just want [MASK], not all his... baggage—and right now he has a 747 cargo hold’s worth of baggage. Could I just lie back and embrace it? Like a submissive? I’ve said I’d try.
<name>probably</name>	probably	Ana	I have no idea why. It’s not like I’m beating his door down.” I frown. “I know you don’t want to talk about him, [MASK], but he’s seriously into you. Warnings or no.”
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Anastasia	He looks at me confused as he redoes his fly. I hold up the empty packet. “A man can hope, [MASK], dream even, and sometimes his dreams come true.” He sounds so odd, his eyes burning. I just don’t understand.
<name>James</name>	James	Christian	Suddenly we both become aware of voices in the hall outside his bedroom door. It takes a moment to process what I can hear. “But if he’s still in bed, then he must be ill. He’s never in bed at this time. [MASK] never sleeps in.”
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Christian	“Well?” she prompts, and squeezes my hand. “His name’s [MASK]. He’s beyond handsome. He’s wealthy . . . too wealthy. He’s very complicated and mercurial.” Yes—I feel inordinately pleased with my concise, accurate summary.
<name>him</name>	him	Christian	I gaze at [MASK], and he’s staring at me. “What?” he asks, his voice quiet. 1 flounder momentarily. No—I’ll tell him. He’s always complaining that I don’t talk to him.
<name>Unknown</name>	Unknown	Christian	Though I don’t really understand his commitment issues. He couldn’t take his eyes off you in the marquee, watched you like a hawk. I’d say he was completely smitten, but maybe he has a funny way of showing it.” Smitten? [MASK]?
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Anastasia	He’s taken off his shirt. Oh my ... I want to touch him. The top button of his jeans is undone. “I’m going to chain you now, [MASK]. Give me your right hand.” I give him my hand.
<name>Ellie</name>	Ellie	Anastasia	What can I say? I stare momentarily out of the window. The car is heading back across the bridge. We are both shrouded in darkness, masking our thoughts and feelings, but we don’t need the night for that. “Why, [MASK]?”
<name>He</name>	He	Jose	He seizes her in a Hollywood-style clinch that moves quickly into a European art house embrace. Honestly . . . get a room. [MASK] and I stare at each other. I’m appalled at their lack of modesty. “Shall we walk down to the bar?”
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Tentatively	I just want to curl up. Curl up and recuperate in some way. Heal my shattered faith. How could I have been so stupid? Of c ourse it hurts. [MASK]. I rub my backside. Aah! It’s sore. Where to go?
<name>Chandler</name>	Chandler	Christian	Last night I found it hard to sleep. My head was buzzing with various options. I am so confused. [MASK]’s idea of a relationship is more like a job offer. It has set hours, a job description, and a rather harsh grievance procedure.
<name>Haruki</name>	Haruki	Christian	[MASK] is reading, seated on his couch. A breathtaking aria is playing on the music system, swirling around him, cocooning him, filling the room with a sweet, soulful song. For a moment, he looks serene.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Christian	I put the bacon under the grill, and while it’s cooking, I whisk some eggs. I turn, and [MASK] is sitting on one of the barstools at the breakfast bar, leaning on it, his face supported by his stee-pled hands.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anastasia	I blush scarlet. “You look lovely, [MASK]. This halter-neck dress suits you, and I get to stroke your back, feel your beautiful skin.” Suddenly, it’s like we’re on our own in the room. Just the two of us.
<name>Ana</name>	Ana	Anastasia	“I’m a hopeless joke teller, too.” “That is such a lovely sound,” he murmurs, and he leans forward and kisses me. “And you are hiding something, [MASK]. I may have to torture it out of you.”
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Kate	“Oh, that’s wonderful news.” The door opens and [MASK] appears, grinning at me. Her face falls when she sees I’ve been crying. “Mom, I have to go. I’ll think about a visit. Thank you.”
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Jose	We watch crap TV, drink beer, and, as the evening wears on, we fondly and loudly reminisce as the beer takes effect. It’s been a good four years. The atmosphere between [MASK] and me has returned to normal, the attempted kiss forgotten.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Christian	“[MASK]. You just don’t fight fair.” “I know. I never have.” My inner goddess frowns at me. You can do this, she coaxes—-play this sex god at his own game. Can I? Okay. What to do?
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Christian	“Oh . . . did I?” I take another sip. Wow, he has a memory for detail. Hmm . .. this champagne really is very good. “Did you try the wine at the reception?” [MASK] makes a face. “Yes.
<name>graduation</name>	graduation	Christian	I am so proud of her at that moment, my errant thoughts of [MASK] pushed to one side. Even though I have heard her speech before, I listen carefully. She commands the room and takes her audience with her. Her theme is “What Next After College?”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Leandra	“Thank you, sir. Will that be all?” [MASK] whispers, looking anywhere but at the two of us. We both turn to stare at her, and she flushes crimson again and scuttles away. “You know, it’s really not fair.”
<name>Ana</name>	Ana	Kate	He’s charming the pants off my dad . . . like he did you, my subconscious snaps at me. His power knows no bounds. I excuse myself to go and find [MASK]. She’s talking to her parents, who are delightful as ever and greet me warmly.
<name>Uncle Vernon</name>	Uncle Vernon	Ray	I laugh, in spite of my tears. Tea is always the answer, according to [MASK]. I remember my mother complaining about him, saying that when it came to tea and sympathy, he was always good at the tea, not so hot on the sympathy.
<name>Coach</name>	Coach	Anastasia	I have a serious case of butterflies. They are flourishing in my stomach. Holy shit, what has he got in store for me? “You okay, [MASK]?” “Yes.” My answer is short, clipped, squeezed out through my nerves.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Anastasia	“Oh dear, [MASK], you moved. What am I going to do to you?” I'm panting loudly. All I can concentrate on is his voice and his touch. Nothing else is real. Nothing else matters, nothing else registers on my radar.
<name>Bella</name>	Bella	Anastasia	“I know,” he says. “I’ll try.” I blink up at him, and he relinquishes my hand and pulls at my chin, releasing my trapped lip. “For you, [MASK], I will try.” He’s radiating sincerity.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Anastasia	“I tracked your cell phone, [MASK].” Oh, of course he did. How is that possible? Is it legal? Stalker, my subconscious whispers at me through the cloud of tequila that’s still floating in my brain, but somehow, because it’s him, I don’t mind.
<name>you</name>	you	Anastasia	“I want a glass of water. Go and fetch one for me please.” Oh. “And when you come back, I shall put you across my knee. Think about that, [MASK].” Water? He wants water—now—why?
<name>Anastasia</name>	Anastasia	Ana	I’m in the pale blue lacy perfect-fit bra. Thank heavens. “Oh, [MASK],” he breathes. “You have the most beautiful skin, pale and flawless. I want to kiss every single inch of it.” I flush.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Christian	“Fine, thank you. She said that I had to abstain from all sexual activity for the next four weeks.” [MASK]’s mouth drops open in shock, and I cannot keep a straight face any longer and grin at him like an idiot.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Anastasia	Nothing happens, but he seems satisfied. I am mystified. When he turns to face me again, he wears his small I-have-a-secret smile. “I am going to tie you to that bed, [MASK].
<name>Drusilla</name>	Drusilla	Elena	[MASK]! Holy fuck. The evil one has a name and it’s all foreign sounding. A vision of a glorious, pale-skinned vamp with raven hair and ruby-red lips comes to mind, and I know that she’s beautiful. I must not dwell.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Iam	[MASK] entranced, and it’s because his smile is so rare. I quite forget what he’s talking about. “I’m going to have a shower. Unless you’d like to shower first?” He cocks his head to one side, still grinning.
<name>darling</name>	darling	Anastasia	He shrugs. “Oh.” “Besides, we’ve been in the playroom twice now, and you haven’t run screaming for the hills.” “Do you expect me to?” “Nothing you do is expected, [MASK],” he says dryly.
<name>her</name>	her	Kate	As an exceptional entrepreneur and major benefactor of our university, his time is extraordinarily precious—much more precious than mine—but he has granted [MASK] an interview. A real coup, she tells me. Damn her extracurricular activities.
<name>her</name>	her	Kate	The flat screen looks odd against the brickwork of the converted warehouse, but no doubt I will get used to it. “See, baby, easy.” He grins a wide, white-toothed smile at [MASK], and she almost literally dissolves into the couch.
<name>myself</name>	myself	Kate	I glance at my alarm clock. Ten minutes have passed. To distract myself from the anxiety that blooms in my belly. I start doing what I told [MASK] I would be doing—packing up my room. I begin by cramming my books into a crate.
<name>Leo</name>	Leo	Taylor	Except his apartment is an art gallery, not a home. [MASK] opens the door for us, and I thank him shyly, aware that he’s been within earshot of our conversation, but his kind smile is reassuring and gives nothing away.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Christian	His cool fingers trail languidly across my belly. My skin is oversensitive, my hips flex automatically, and the now-warmer liquid from my navel seeps over my belly. [MASK] moves quickly, lapping it up with his tongue, kissing, biting me softly, sucking.
<name>he</name>	he	Jose	He’s tall, and in his jeans and T-shirt, he’s all shoulders and muscles, tanned skin, dark hair, and burning dark eyes. Yes, [MASK]’s pretty hot, but I think he’s finally getting the message: we’re just friends.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Taylor	“Well, it seems my family likes you, too,” he murmurs. Too? The depressing thought about how I came to be invited pops unbidden and very unwelcome into my head. [MASK] starts the car and heads away from the circle of light in the driveway to the darkness of the road.
<name>Augustus</name>	Augustus	Jose	But right now, I don’t need this. “Tomorrow, then. You’ll call?” The hope in his voice twists my heart. “Yes . . . good night, [MASK].” I hang up, not waiting for his response.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Christian	It’s wonderful to see you.” And with that loving statement, she leaves. Hmm, [MASK] and reasonable . . . two concepts that I thought were mutually exclusive, but after his e-mail, maybe all things are possible. I shake my head.
<name>Instructor</name>	Instructor	Christian	. keep it steady. See the middle dial in front? Keep the needle dead center.” My heart is in my mouth. Holy shit. I am flying a glider . . . I’m soaring. “Good girl.” [MASK] sounds delighted.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jose	Holy crap, it’s [MASK]. He sounds desperate. “Where are you? I’ve been trying to contact you. I need to see you, to apologize for my behavior on Friday. Why haven’t you returned my calls?”
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Anastasia	“Look at you glow, [MASK],” he whispers as he trails kisses and soft bites along my shoulder. I groan. Suddenly he lets go. “Carry on,” he orders, and stands back watching me. I rub myself. No.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Bob	Come home—visit with us. I miss you, darling. [MASK] would love to see you, too. You can get some distance and maybe some perspective. You need a break. You’ve been working so hard.” Oh boy, is this tempting.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Anastasia	I take a sip, and the wine is light, crisp, and delicious. “You’re very quiet, and you’re not even blushing. In fact, I think this is the palest I’ve ever seen you, [MASK],” he murmurs.
<name>THE SHOP</name>	THE SHOP	Clayton	THE DAY DRAGS AT [MASK]’s even though we’re busy. We’ve hit the summer season, so I have to spend two hours restocking the shelves once the shop is closed. It’s mindless work, and it gives me too much time to think.
<name>Dad</name>	Dad	Christian	I peek up at [MASK], and he turns to look at me, his head cocked to one side. “What?” he asks. “Please don’t be mad at me,” I whisper. “I’m not mad at you.”
<name>Anastasia</name>	Anastasia	Anastasia	“That’s damned cheeky, coming from you.” He leans across and kisses the tip of my nose. “This will shock you, [MASK]. Ready?” I nod, wide-eyed, still with the stupid grin on my face.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Anastasia	“You smell so good, [MASK]. So sweet.” His nose skims past my ear down my neck, and he trails soft, featherlight kisses along my shoulder. My breathing changes, becoming shallow, rushed, full of expectation. His fingers are at my zipper.
<name>he</name>	he	Jose	After a brief not-at-all-awkward-thank-goodness hug, [MASK] has gone. I don’t know when I’ll see him again, probably his photography show, and once again, I’m blown away that he finally has an exhibition.
<name>Don</name>	Don	Anastasia	boy . . this is thrilling. I’m a child again, though that’s not right. I watch him carefully as he paces deliberately toward me. I inch away. “You certainly know how to distract a man, [MASK].”
<name>something</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	something (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Jose	I ask to fill the sudden deafening chasm of silence. I will not let him make me feel guilty about [MASK]. Eventually, he sighs. “I went to a fund-raising dinner. It was deathly dull. I left as soon as I could.”
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Jose	[MASK] has a great eye for a good picture. “I have news.” He grins, his dark eyes twinkling. “Don’t tell me—you’ve managed not to get kicked out for another week,” I tease, and he scowls playfully at me.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Anastasia	“Are you going to hit me again?” “No, not tonight.” Phew . . . my subconscious and I both breathe a silent sigh of relief. “So,” I prompt. “I like the control it gives me, [MASK].
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Taylor	I flush at the thought of his buzz cut roaming the aisles of Agent Provocateur or wherever he bought it. The doors open, and I’m facing the foyer of apartment number one. [MASK] stands at the double doors as I step out of the elevator.
<name>him</name>	him	Christian	I press “send” and climb despondently back into bed, resolving to ask [MASK] about his relationship with that woman. Part of me is desperate to know more, and another part wants to forget he ever told me.
<name>Dr. Smith</name>	Dr. Smith	Grace	“Everything okay?” “Another measles case.” [MASK] sighs. “Oh no.” “Yes, a child. The fourth case this month. If only people would get their kids vaccinated.” She shakes her head sadly, and then smiles.
<name>my editor</name>	my editor	Kate	Wow. I sit down, fish the questions from my backpack, and go through them, inwardly cursing [MASK] for not providing me with a brief biography. I know nothing about this man I’m about to interview. He could be ninety or he could be thirty.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Christian	I turn back to face [MASK]. We are four feet apart. He steps forward, and instinctively I step back. He stops, and the anguish in his expression is palpable, his gray eyes burning. “I don’t want you to go,” he murmurs, his voice full of longing.
<name>He</name>	He	Christian	There’s an undercurrent of affection in his words, the way his voice grows softer and his eyes crinkle as he mentions her name. [MASK] obviously adores her. It’s a revelation. And she comes barreling down the hall, raven haired, tall, and curvaceous.
<name>Anastasia</name>	Anastasia	Ana	I gaze at him, unable to express myself. I’m on shifting tectonic plates. Try to be cool, [MASK], my tortured subconscious begs on bended knee. “Books,” I whisper, but inside, my subconscious is screaming: You!
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Christian	Holy crap . . . this is the tricky part. He refills my teacup, and I sip. “So, what’s your general attitude to receiving pain?” [MASK] looks expectantly at me. “You’re biting your lip,” he says darkly.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Kate	It’s ten thirty. “I’m leaving now.” “I’ll see you out.” I still can’t look at him. Taking my hand, he leads me to the front door. Fortunately, [MASK] is still not home.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Ana	“Honey, how are you? How was graduation?” she enthuses down the phone. Her voice is a soothing balm. “Sorry it’s so late,” I whisper. She pauses. “[MASK]? What’s wrong?” She’s all seriousness now.
<name>Beatrice</name>	Beatrice	Christian	[MASK] propels us off the dance floor in double time. But I never got to talk to her. Is she okay? I can see where things are heading for her and him. I need to do the safe-sex lecture.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Hmm	“Fuck!” CHAPTER FIVE It’s very quiet. The light is muted. I am comfortable and warm, in this bed. [MASK] ... I open my eyes, and for a moment I’m tranquil and serene, enjoying the strange, unfamiliar surroundings.
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Christian	“So the photographer called?” Crap. “Yes.” “What did he want?” “Just to apologize, you know—for Friday.” [MASK] narrows his eyes. “I see,” he says simply.
