<name>Dickon</name>	Dickon	Dickon	"Our [MASK] can only read printin'. If tha' could print we could write a letter to him an' ask him to go an' buy th' garden tools an' th' seeds at th' same time." "Oh!
<name>John</name>	John	Dickon	There now," and he pushed the rubber tip of the bottle into the nuzzling mouth and the lamb began to suck it with ravenous ecstasy. After that there was no wondering what to say. By the time the lamb fell asleep questions poured forth and [MASK] answered them all.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Martha	[MASK] looked rather taken aback but she looked pleased, too. "Well," she said, "he's th' best lad as ever was born, but us never thought he was handsome. His nose turns up too much."
<name>Colin</name>	Colin	Colin	She could see he felt sorrier for [MASK] than she did. He looked up at the sky and all about him. "Just listen to them birds--th' world seems full of 'em--all whistlin' an' pipin'," he said.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	But them roses as has climbed all over it will near hide every bit o' th' dead wood when they're full o' leaves an' flowers. It won't look dead then. It'll be th' prettiest of all." [MASK] still gazed at the tree and thought.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Martha	"I think you shall be a secret, too," he said. "I will not tell them until they find out. I can always send the nurse out of the room and say that I want to be by myself. Do you know [MASK]?"
<name>Lottie</name>	Lottie	Martha	She did not feel cross when [MASK] chattered away. She felt as if she rather liked to hear her, and at last she thought she would ask her a question. She asked it after she had finished her supper and had sat down on the hearth-rug before the fire.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	"He's th' only friend I've got." "I have no friends at all," said [MASK]. "I never had. My Ayah didn't like me and I never played with any one."
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Dickon	"It's this," she said. "It's a secret garden, and I'm the only one in the world who wants it to be alive." [MASK] looked round and round about it, and round and round again. "Eh!"
<name>Colin</name>	Colin	Colin	That made [MASK] turn and look at her again. "Don't you?" he said. And then he lay back on his cushion and was still, as if he were thinking. And there was quite a long silence.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Dickon	and I had to stand up on my feet to see if it was real. And it is real! I'm well--I'm well!" "Aye, that th' art!" said [MASK]. "I'm well! I'm well!"
<name>Ben</name>	Ben	Dickon	"An' I didn't come through th' door. I come over th' wall. Th' rheumatics held me back th' last two year'." "Tha' come an' did a bit o' prunin'!" cried [MASK].
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	They lived a long time ago. That parrot one, I believe, is one of my great, great, great, great aunts. She looks rather like you, [MASK]--not as you look now but as you looked when you came here.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Martha	"It's not mine," answered [MASK] stoutly. "An' this isn't my day out. I get my day out once a month same as th' rest. Then I go home an' clean up for mother an' give her a day's rest."
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	She went away in high spirits as soon as she had given [MASK] her breakfast. She was going to walk five miles across the moor to the cottage, and she was going to help her mother with the washing and do the week's baking and enjoy herself thoroughly.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Mary	You may do what you like." [MASK] put her hand up to her throat because she was afraid he might see the excited lump which she felt jump into it. She came a step nearer to him. "May I?" she said tremulously.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Mary	"He's been lying in his room so long and he's always been so afraid of his back that it has made him queer," said [MASK]. "He knows a good many things out of books but he doesn't know anything else.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	"I can have my garden!" cried [MASK]. "I may have it where I like! I am not going to have a governess for a long time! Your mother is coming to see me and I may go to your cottage!
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	He talked to th' other doctor quite rough--in a polite way. He said there'd been too much medicine and too much lettin' him have his own way." "I think he's a very spoiled boy," said [MASK]. "
<name>Pollyanna</name>	Pollyanna	Colin	Your father will be happy to hear of this remarkable improvement." "I won't have him told!" [MASK] broke forth fiercely. "It will only disappoint him if I get worse again--and I may get worse this very night.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	"Tha'rt like th' robin," he said to her one morning when he lifted his head and saw her standing by him. "I never knows when I shall see thee or which side tha'll come from." "He's friends with me now," said [MASK].
<name>Button-Bright</name>	Button-Bright	Roach	"You have my permission to go, [MASK]," he said. "But, remember, this is very important." "Caw--Caw!" remarked the crow hoarsely but not impolitely. "Very good, sir.
<name>Colin</name>	Colin	Colin	It is under the ivy on the wall." If he had been a strong healthy boy [MASK] would probably have shouted "Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!" but he was weak and rather hysterical; his eyes grew bigger and bigger and he gasped for breath.
<name>He</name>	He	Mary	You do your best to cheer her up,' she says, an' I said I would." [MASK] gave her a long, steady look. "You do cheer me up," she said. "I like to hear you talk."
<name>Dorothy</name>	Dorothy	Dickon	The humming of the bees in the blossoms mingled with the chanting voice and drowsily melted into a doze. [MASK] sat cross-legged with his rabbit asleep on his arm and a hand resting on the lamb's back.
<name>Johnsy</name>	Johnsy	Mary	[MASK] remembered what he had asked her the day she had gone to his room. "Do you want anything--dolls--toys--books?" She opened the package wondering if he had sent a doll, and also wondering what she should do with it if he had.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	Th' rent of our cottage is only one an' threepence an' it's like pullin' eye-teeth to get it. Now I've just thought of somethin'," putting her hands on her hips. "What?" said [MASK] eagerly. "
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dickon	"Do you remember that first morning you brought me in here?" he demanded. [MASK] was looking at him very hard. Being an animal charmer he could see more things than most people could and many of them were things he never talked about.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Mary	But there's nowt to see." [MASK] made no response. She went down the path and through the second green door. There, she found more walls and winter vegetables and glass frames, but in the second wall there was another green door and it was not open.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Colin	Tha's doin' Magic thysel'," he said. "It's same Magic as made these 'ere work out o' th' earth," and he touched with his thick boot a clump of crocuses in the grass. [MASK] looked down at them.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Martha	And they are exactly the color of the sky over the moor." [MASK] beamed with satisfaction. "Mother says he made 'em that color with always lookin' up at th' birds an' th' clouds. But he has got a big mouth, hasn't he, now?"
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	"It makes me ill to be angry. No one believes I shall live to grow up." He said it as if he was so accustomed to the idea that it had ceased to matter to him at all. He seemed to like the sound of [MASK]'s voice.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Martha	He let me see his mother's picture. Before I left him I sang him to sleep." [MASK] fairly gasped with amazement. "I can scarcely believe thee!" she protested. "It's as if tha'd walked straight into a lion's den.
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Mary	"I am! You know I am! Everybody says so." "I don't believe it!" said [MASK] sourly. "You just say that to make people sorry. I believe you're proud of it. I don't believe it!
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Colin	"It is my garden now. I am fond of it. I shall come here every day," announced [MASK]. "But it is to be a secret. My orders are that no one is to know that we come here.
<name>Sara</name>	Sara	Mary	And then they began to work harder than ever and more joyfully. [MASK] was startled and sorry when she heard the big clock in the courtyard strike the hour of her midday dinner. "I shall have to go," she said mournfully. "
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	"But that's not all," [MASK] went on, almost pale with solemn excitement. "The rest is better. There is a door into the garden. I found it. It is under the ivy on the wall."
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	"I wish I was friends with things," he said at last, "but I'm not. I never had anything to be friends with, and I can't bear people." "Can't you bear me?" asked [MASK]. "
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Colin	She had her hat on when she appeared in [MASK]'s room and for a second he looked disappointed. He was in bed. His face was pitifully white and there were dark circles round his eyes. "I'm glad you came," he said.
<name>Dickon</name>	Dickon	Dickon	Our [MASK] goes off on th' moor by himself an' plays for hours. That's how he made friends with th' pony. He's got sheep on th' moor that knows him, an' birds as comes an' eats out of his hand.
<name>Hathersage</name>	Hathersage	Thwaite	Did tha' do anythin' extra to make thysel' so strong?' An' he says 'Well, yes, lad, I did. A strong man in a show that came to [MASK] once showed me how to exercise my arms an' legs an' every muscle in my body.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	"I know tha' thinks I'm a queer lad," he said, "but I think tha' art th' queerest little lass I ever saw." Then [MASK] did a strange thing. She leaned forward and asked him a question she had never dreamed of asking any one before.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	an' she's only four year' old. Sometimes tha' looks fair soft in th' head." [MASK] had worn her contrary scowl for an hour after that, but it made her think several entirely new things.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	Where is tha' garden?" [MASK]'s thin hands clutched each other as they lay on her lap. She did not know what to say, so for a whole minute she said nothing. She had never thought of this. She felt miserable.
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Mary	she stammered. "Yes, I think so," he replied. "She knows about children," said [MASK]. "She has twelve. She knows." He seemed to rouse himself. "What do you want to do?"
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	There's green in that wood yet. Look at it." [MASK] was down on her knees before he spoke, gazing with all her might. "When it looks a bit greenish an' juicy like that, it's wick," he explained.
<name>Dickon</name>	Dickon	Dickon	[MASK] had bought penny packages of flower seeds now and then and sown bright sweet-scented things among gooseberry bushes and even cabbages and he grew borders of mignonette and pinks and pansies and things whose seeds he could save year after year or whose roots would bloom each spring and spread in time into fine clumps.
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Dickon	His anger and insulted pride made him forget everything but this one moment and filled him with a power he had never known before, an almost unnatural strength. "Come here!" he shouted to [MASK], and he actually began to tear the coverings off his lower limbs and disentangle himself.
<name>mother</name>	mother	Ayah	"He'll drop off after a while--if he's not too upset. Then I'll lie down myself in the next room." "Would you like me to sing you that song I learned from my [MASK]?"
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Martha	And I heard that far-off crying again, just as we heard it the other night. There isn't a wind today, so you see it couldn't have been the wind." "Eh!" said [MASK] restlessly.
<name>Dickon</name>	Dickon	Birds	"[MASK] is rare choosers an' a robin can flout a body worse than a man. See, he's making up to thee now. 'Cannot tha' see a chap?' he's sayin'." And it really seemed as if it must be true.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dickon	"I shall have to go," she said mournfully. "And you will have to go too, won't you?" [MASK] grinned. "My dinner's easy to carry about with me," he said.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Martha	It's th' air of th' moor that's givin' thee stomach for tha' victuals," answered [MASK]. "It's lucky for thee that tha's got victuals as well as appetite. There's been twelve in our cottage as had th' stomach an' nothin' to put in it.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	It was another cry, but not quite like the one she had heard last night; it was only a short one, a fretful childish whine muffled by passing through walls. "It's nearer than it was," said [MASK], her heart beating rather faster.
<name>Pinocchio</name>	Pinocchio	Colin	"Now that I am a real boy," [MASK] had said, "my legs and arms and all my body are so full of Magic that I can't keep them still. They want to be doing things all the time.
<name>Susan</name>	Susan	Dickon	Then she smiled [MASK]'s own curving smile. "Eh! but they're enjoyin' theirselves for sure," she said. She was quite right, the comfortable wonderful mother creature--and she had never been more so than when she said their "play actin'" would be their joy.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Colin	"He's nicer than any other boy that ever lived!" she said. "He's--he's like an angel!" It might sound rather silly to say that but she did not care. "A nice angel!" [MASK] sneered ferociously.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	He daren't say so, but he always looks cheerful when I am worse. When I had typhoid fever his face got quite fat. I think my father wishes it, too." "I don't believe he does," said [MASK] quite obstinately.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	asked [MASK]. "He found it on th' moor with its mother when it was a little one an' he began to make friends with it an' give it bits o' bread an' pluck young grass for it. And it got to like him
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	"And please--please don't make me have a governess yet." He rubbed his forehead again and stared at her. "That was what the Sowerby woman said," he muttered absentmindedly. Then [MASK] gathered a scrap of courage. "
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	He seemed quite familiar and not the least afraid. He hopped about and pecked the earth briskly, looking for seeds and insects. It actually gave [MASK] a queer feeling in her heart, because he was so pretty and cheerful and seemed so like a person.
<name>Colin</name>	Colin	Colin	It seemed as if they talked to each other in soft chirps." [MASK] lay back on his cushion and his eyes grew larger and larger and the spots on his cheeks burned. "Tell me some more about him," he said. "
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	"See how these has pushed up, an' these an' these! An' Eh! Look at these here!" He threw himself upon his knees and [MASK] went down beside him. They had come upon a whole clump of crocuses burst into purple and orange and gold.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	He threw himself into a passion an' he said he'd looked at him because he was going to be a hunchback. He cried himself into a fever an' was ill all night." "If he ever gets angry at me, I'll never go and see him again," said [MASK].
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	The servants are not allowed to speak about me. If I live I may be a hunchback, but I shan't live. My father hates to think I may be like him." "Oh, what a queer house this is!" [MASK] said.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Colin	From this time dated their plan of "play actin'." "I may be obliged to have a tantrum," said [MASK] regretfully. "I don't want to have one and I'm not miserable enough now to work myself into a big one.
<name>Colin</name>	Colin	Colin	wouldn't it be possible to take him to the garden without having any one find it out? The grand doctor had said that he must have fresh air and [MASK] had said that he would not mind fresh air in a secret garden.
<name>Sara</name>	Sara	Mary	In the corner of the sofa there was a cushion, and in the velvet which covered it there was a hole, and out of the hole peeped a tiny head with a pair of frightened eyes in it. [MASK] crept softly across the room to look.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mary	"I suppose I may as well tell you something about where you are going to," she said. "Do you know anything about your uncle?" "No," said [MASK]. "Never heard your father and mother talk about him?" "
<name>Dorothy</name>	Dorothy	Mary	Hooray! Hooray!" but he was weak and rather hysterical; his eyes grew bigger and bigger and he gasped for breath. "Oh! [MASK]!" he cried out with a half sob. "Shall I see it? Shall I get into it?
<name>Dickon</name>	Dickon	Mary	[MASK] thought it looked a queer dinner, but he seemed ready to enjoy it. "Run on an' get thy victuals," he said. "I'll be done with mine first. I'll get some more work done before I start back home."
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	[MASK] was an odd, determined little person, and now she had something interesting to be determined about, she was very much absorbed, indeed. She worked and dug and pulled up weeds steadily, only becoming more pleased with her work every hour instead of tiring of it.
<name>Craven</name>	Craven	Colin	"I never seed no sense in th' Doxology afore," he said hoarsely, "but I may change my mind i' time. I should say tha'd gone up five pound this week Mester [MASK]--five on 'em!"
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Mary	"What are hysterics?" asked [MASK]. "You'll find out if you work him into a tantrum after this--but at any rate you've given him something to have hysterics about, and I'm glad of it."
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	He's never seen a little wench here before, an' he's bent on findin' out all about thee. Tha's no need to try to hide anything from him." "Are things stirring down below in the dark in that garden where he lives?" [MASK] inquired.
<name>She</name>	She	Mary	She was grinding her teeth and saying this over and over again when she heard her mother come out on the veranda with some one. She was with a fair young man and they stood talking together in low strange voices. [MASK] knew the fair young man who looked like a boy.
<name>Dickon</name>	Dickon	Dickon	She wondered and wondered in those few moments if there was any reality in that other thing [MASK] had said. He had gone on rubbing his rust-red hair in a puzzled way, but a nice comforted look had begun to grow in his blue eyes.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	she wanted to do, [MASK] went to the green door and turned the handle. She hoped the door would not open because she wanted to be sure she had found the mysterious garden--but it did open quite easily and she walked through it and found herself in an orchard.
<name>Ántonia</name>	Ántonia	Mary	"You are real, aren't you?" he said. "I have such real dreams very often. You might be one of them." [MASK] had slipped on a woolen wrapper before she left her room and she put a piece of it between his fingers.
<name>Aladdin</name>	Aladdin	Martha	He had rubies and emeralds and diamonds stuck all over him. He spoke to his people just as you spoke to [MASK]. Everybody had to do everything he told them--in a minute. I think they would have been killed if they hadn't."
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Colin	There's some big clumps o' columbine in th' garden. They'll look like a bed o' blue an' white butterflies flutterin' when they're out." "I'm going to see them," cried [MASK]. "I am going to see them!"
<name>ayah</name>	ayah	Ayah	One frightfully hot morning, when she was about nine years old, she awakened feeling very cross, and she became crosser still when she saw that the servant who stood by her bedside was not her [MASK]. "Why did you come?" she said to the strange woman.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	"I'm not a cripple!" he cried out furiously. "I'm not!" "He's not!" cried [MASK], almost shouting up the wall in her fierce indignation. "He's not got a lump as big as a pin!
<name>Colin</name>	Colin	Dickon	They both felt their pulses beat faster. "It's mother!" [MASK] said again when they met halfway. "I knowed tha' wanted to see her an' I told her where th' door was hid."
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Colin	That idea seemed to impress [MASK]. He thought it over and then answered her slowly. "If I were her ghost--my father would be fond of me." "Do you want him to be fond of you?"
<name>Colin</name>	Colin	Dickon	He was not in the least like [MASK], but he was evidently so pleased with the idea of a garden no one knew anything about that she thought perhaps he could be trusted. But she had not known him long enough to be sure.
<name>Dickon</name>	Dickon	Dickon	When she slipped through the door under the ivy, she saw he was not working where she had left him. The gardening tools were laid together under a tree. She ran to them, looking all round the place, but there was no [MASK] to be seen.
<name>Colin</name>	Colin	Mary	"Do you want him to be fond of you?" inquired [MASK]. "I used to hate it because he was not fond of me. If he grew fond of me I think I should tell him about the Magic. It might make him more cheerful."
<name>Colin</name>	Colin	Colin	"An' tha'lt stop bein' afraid in a bit." "I shall?" said [MASK], and he lay still as if he were wondering about things. They were really very quiet for a little while. The sun was dropping lower.
<name>Colin</name>	Colin	Colin	"She give my head a bit of a rub an' laughed an' she says, 'Eh, lad, tha' can have all th' secrets tha' likes. I've knowed thee twelve year'.'" "How did you know about [MASK]?
<name>Dickon</name>	Dickon	Ben	"I was thinkin'" answered [MASK], "as I'd warrant tha's, gone up three or four pound this week. I was lookin' at tha' calves an' tha' shoulders. I'd like to get thee on a pair o' scales."
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	"Where's that robin as is callin' us?" he said. The chirp came from a thick holly bush, bright with scarlet berries, and [MASK] thought she knew whose it was. "Is it really calling us?" she asked.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	The rainstorm had ended and the gray mist and clouds had been swept away in the night by the wind. The wind itself had ceased and a brilliant, deep blue sky arched high over the moorland. Never, never had [MASK] dreamed of a sky so blue.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Colin	[MASK] looked rather like a picture himself. He was wrapped in a velvet dressing-gown and sat against a big brocaded cushion. He had a red spot on each cheek. "Come in," he said. "I've been thinking about you all morning."
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	She liked him. Perhaps he'd find you a corner somewhere out o' the way." "If it was out of the way and no one wanted it, no one could mind my having it, could they?" [MASK] said anxiously.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Mary	"It'll do you good and give you some stomach for your meat." [MASK] went to the window. There were gardens and paths and big trees, but everything looked dull and wintry. "Out? Why should I go out on a day like this?"
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mary	," said [MASK], and they both laughed. They went to the Indian room and amused themselves with the ivory elephants. They found the rose-colored brocade boudoir and the hole in the cushion the mouse had left, but the mice had grown up and run away and the hole was empty.
<name>Rosa</name>	Rosa	Martha	He nodded his head toward the outer corridor. "She is the one who is asleep in the other room. The nurse went away yesterday to stay all night with her sister and she always makes [MASK] attend to me when she wants to go out.
<name>Dickon</name>	Dickon	Dickon	"Is it really calling us?" she asked. "Aye," said [MASK], as if it was the most natural thing in the world, "he's callin' some one he's friends with. That's same as sayin' '
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	He asked question after question. Where was it? Had she never looked for the door? Had she never asked the gardeners? "They won't talk about it," said [MASK]. "I think they have been told not to answer questions."
