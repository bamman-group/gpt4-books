<name>Rebus</name>	Rebus	Macauley	The hob was dusted with grey ash. The bed was probably made up once or twice a week. Even the alarm clock on the floor beside the bed leant drunkenly on one leg and gave out with a muzzy chick-chock. [MASK] shook his head.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Gooby	No doubt about her, though, the way she had pulled through. He felt irritated by the unvolitional feeling of admiration oozing through his confused thoughts. When he went back she sat up and guzzled the water. ‘Where’s [MASK] gone?’
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Desmond	The idea repelled him, but it was the best way out with the kid. On his own, he would have camped on or close to the building job. He didn’t see [MASK] all day, but at nightfall he was back on the same site.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Bella	‘Not that I do it every time. Some days my constitution don’t feel like it’s been shot to pieces.’ [MASK] started again with caution and defiance. She sang a bar. The bell rang. She screeched four notes. The bell jangled shrilly.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Macauley	Here it was again, the resumption of yesterday, the repeat performance. And maybe it would end with the same big climax. ‘How many bottles have you got of that stuff?’ [MASK] asked. ‘Why?’
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Macauley	‘I got ten bob on the bagman.' [MASK] ripped off his coat and spat on his hands. A feathery smile touched the corners of his mouth, but only a killer gleam flashed in his eyes. This was what he liked: a fight.
<name>Anyone</name>	Anyone	Anybody’d	‘Is that any reason to wake the whole neighbourhood?’ he demanded. ‘[MASK] think you were being murdered. Cut it out.’ The loudness of his voice only reduced the volume of her hysteria, like a radio turned down; it didn’t stop it.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Desmond	‘Listen!’ [MASK] exclaimed. ‘Hear that river? There’s water coming from somewhere and going somewhere and so on. It flows on a set course for thousands of miles. It’s not only getting away from something, it’s getting to something.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Macauley	He slammed the bottle down on the table, and in the same movement reached out and grabbed [MASK]’s shirt and dragged himself up close. ‘Who are you?’ he demanded. ‘Where’d you come from?’
<name>Artemis</name>	Artemis	Macauley	[MASK] stood on the spot. He was perfectly still. His eyes were on the frightful weapon. He saw it to within a foot of his face; then precisely at the right moment he flicked his head to one side and the weapon arm slid over his shoulder.
<name>Goldberry</name>	Goldberry	Buster	He scuttled back and shook [MASK] awake, and he let her sit up and rub and yawn the sleep away as he quickly heaped the swag into a convenient roll, which was all he could do in the circumstances. He strapped it tightly.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Macauley	It took me all those years and so on to find out. And it’s too late for me to start doing anything about it now.’ He cocked his head and directed his one red eye at [MASK]. ‘But it’s not too late for you.’
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Macauley	He left the wall doubled, grunting for breath, spitting blood. The woman was shrieking, Don’t! Don’t! You’ll kill him!’ For another five minutes the butchery went on. [MASK] pulled the man’s head back, held him upright by his hair.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Macauley	‘You won’t say no to that, I can see by the look on your face and so on. There’s bread and fat in the tuckerbag behind you. Help yourself. I’ll go down and get a billy of water for the tea.’ [MASK] ate with relish.
<name>James</name>	James	Macauley	He said they would have to operate. He looked away again. [MASK] lost his temper. He snarled, ‘All right, don’t be a bloody granny! Tell me. What’s the betting?’ The doctor said quietly, ‘She’s in pretty bad shape.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Kelly	‘Let me worry about it. Say, what time have you got to be on the job?’ [MASK] looked at his wristwatch. ‘I’ll have to shove off now.’ He gulped down the last of the drink. ‘I hope you don’t mind.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Macauley	He stood up and put his coat on against the nippy air, and threw another stick on the fire. He went back to sitting on the log, smoking reflectively, palms over the blaze. There was a sudden quick rustle of candlebark. [MASK] spun round.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Ruby	Well, you knew [MASK]. She had all the go in the world in her, and she kept things quiet. She was sick off and on, and sometimes she couldn’t hide it. But I don’t suppose I’ll ever know how crook she really was.’
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Macauley	‘Still unconscious,’ he said, ‘but she’s hanging on.’ He said it as though he found it remarkable and encouraging. [MASK] plucked at his arm. ‘Last night,’ he said. ‘I didn’t mean to cut up rough.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Macauley	What was the matter with him now? The four of them, as usual, ate together when the rest of the boarders had finished, and at the tea table [MASK] tried to appear unconcerned, giving the impression that he would be there for years to come.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Macauley	‘I didn’t know her. I never saw her before. They were walking down the street. That way. Towards town.’ ‘You must be mistaken,’ [MASK] told her edgily. ‘My kid wouldn’t go anywhere with anyone.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Kelly	You want it easy, don’t you son! I’ll give you [MASK] here. How’ll that do you?’ And it made the years before him seem like an abyss, like the waste of a stony desert. What had he been doing?
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Gooby	He found [MASK] beside the road in the grass where it had been flung from her senseless hand. He unstrapped his swag. His eyes clung to the books he had bought on raising children, diet, nursing care, diseases. They seemed to ridicule him.
<name>Clancy</name>	Clancy	Christy	But he put it this way, ‘If it’ll make you feel any better I’ll tell you this. Even if you hadn’t touched [MASK] and I hadn’t engaged another man; even if I wanted a burr cook right now, I still wouldn’t have given you the job.’
<name>Seamus</name>	Seamus	Kelly	‘She’s not there now,’ [MASK] said, straddling his bike. She’s down at the presbytery. Housekeeping. Okay— don’t do anything I wouldn’t do,’ he said with a grin. ‘What do you want me to do, lead a dull life?’
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Macauley	It was a sodden rag. He told her to put it in her pocket and he gave her his piece of shirt. He took her hand and led her across the street. They went into a chemist’s shop. [MASK] asked for a bottle of eucalyptus.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Macauley	[MASK] coughed and looked for his tobacco. ‘The gramophone. Tell me where it is and I’ll get it.’ ‘I’ve been giving her milk, custards, broth, and she laps them up. Eats them like an angel. Even the rice puddings.
<name>the Greek</name>	the Greek	Macauley	The youth looked at him with a quick, birdlike intentness, as though he thought [MASK] was about to tell a joke. ‘You didn’t take it?’ he asked. ‘I did take it.’ The Greek ran a hand over his liquorice hair and grinned.
<name>Connell</name>	Connell	Macauley	‘Did she talk? Did she tell you a story?’ [MASK] shook his head. ‘No,’ he said dryly. ‘She’s fast a bloody asleep, like everybody else ought to be.’
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Kelly	Then he gave her more eucalyptus and sugar, and sprinkled eucalyptus on her handkerchief and told her to snuff it up every so often. Suddenly the alarm shrilled, momentarily startling them. On the bed [MASK] twisted, then turned quickly over, stifled the clock and fell back.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Macauley	He held up one podgy finger. ‘An hour.’ ‘Fair enough,’ [MASK] said. They watched him dawdle off, his hands behind his back, his trouser whipping about his legs like tattered sails.
<name>Roche</name>	Roche	Macauley	It was highly probable that whoever had written the letter was familiar with [MASK]’s itinerant life and knew that he did not confine his occupations to the shearing industry. On the other hand it could have been an ignorant shot in the dark.
<name>Seamus</name>	Seamus	Macauley	‘She doesn’t say much, does she?’ ‘She’s a bit off-colour with the cold, that’s all,’ [MASK] said. ‘Otherwise she’s the greatest ear-basher ever God put breath in.’ He said it pleasantly.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Kelly	He expected [MASK] home between five-thirty and six. He had the food in the oven, keeping it hot, when six o’clock came and went. At six-thirty he went to the door and looked out. It was dark and a light rain was falling.
<name>She</name>	She	Buster	‘I’m hungry.’ ‘You only think you are.’ ‘No.’ ‘I’ll see what I can get for you,’ he said. He buttered her a hunk of bread, and when he returned with it, [MASK] was sitting up.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Christy	Can’t you see me? Look. Here.’ And his huge hands, half closed, would thump on [MASK]’s ribs, his jaw, his chin, hard enough to hurt, but not hard enough to knock him out.
<name>Spud</name>	Spud	Christy	He had seen pigs like [MASK] powtering in the slops, all grunt and hair. He wanted to tell him to get back in the pen. But he had to go canny. He couldn’t handle two of them together.
<name>Mac</name>	Mac	Desmond	Cost you nothing to run it except shoes for the horse. It would carry all your gear and more. Save you boot leather and a lot of stress and strain and so on. Just the thing for you and your shiralee.’ ‘What?’ ‘Her,’ [MASK] nodded.
<name>Quoyle</name>	Quoyle	Macauley	At sunset a contraption comprised of a man and a pushbike passed them by, veered off the road, pulled up on the river bank forty yards away and came apart. [MASK] was interested to see it was in two pieces.
<name>Stalling</name>	Stalling	Boomi	But [MASK] was no good. Not when a copper put a time limit on a man. It never paid to cross a john. They had memories like elephants and they could be as vindictive as a tossed-out mother-in-law.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Macauley	‘Not knowing the circumstances and not knowing the party,’ he said, 'I’m afraid that’s more than I can tell you.’ ‘Okay,’ [MASK] said, absently, but in a tone of dismissal. ‘I’ll buy you a drink some time.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Macaulay	Then [MASK] told himself there was not much point in walking farther. They might as well wait for the daylight and a lift through. It was the easiest way with her. He made the bed, one blanket under, one over. It was only an overnight doss.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Macauley	He half turned to go. ‘If I’m still here in a few days I’ll get in touch with you.’ Suddenly he half raised his hand as the fat man was about to leave the counter. [MASK] thought he might get a line on his friend.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Jimmy	They’d like it or lump it. He’d throw the bloody stew in their faces, but he wouldn’t budge. Unlike [MASK], he’d stay there. They might sack him, but they’d never wear him down. He’d get respect from them.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Macauley	And what’s more I can carry all the belongings I want. I don’t have to jettison and so on. Why, there’s a whole house on that bike.’ ‘Soon you’ll have to get off and walk,’ [MASK] chuckled.
<name>Sheffield</name>	Sheffield	Macauley	He was a marvel of masculinity, and wherever he was he excited gasps of wonder and admiration and envy. Two years ago, [MASK] remembered, he had lost almost none of it, though time was at work but in a process of slow-fading, as slow as the growth of a tree.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Macauley	[MASK], squatting down, holding a broken piece of looking glass in his hand, was scraping off the whiskers with a blunt razor. His face was red when he finished. He used a dab of butter rubbed to grease in his hands as an emollient.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Kelly	He edged himself in, thrusting his face close to [MASK]’s, and he repeated the words, bat realised the futility of doing so. They made no impact. They fell against a shut brain and died before they could penetrate it.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Macauley	In the afternoon a portly man with a heavy face threaded with little red veins ferreted him out in the hospital yard, introduced himself as Bathgate of the local firm of solicitors, and served a notice on him. [MASK] took it unsurely and read the contents.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Macauley	He had a bit of Chow in him somewhere. ‘That’s too bad,’ [MASK] said. ‘I was going to turn on a proper feed tonight. But never mind.’ He placed the money on the counter as the storekeeper wrapped up the goods.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Macauley	They drove off, and [MASK] went down the street. He thought about it for ten minutes before he sent the telegram to his wife. He said briefly: ‘Buster Casino Public Hospital. Not expected to live.
<name>Bloom</name>	Bloom	Desmond	He got his gum paper free at any post office. Once the officials heard the purpose for which it was to be used, [MASK] said, they were more than pleased to oblige him. They were honoured. He insisted on reading some of his jingles.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Kelly	The other room was filled with junk. He went back into the room where [MASK] did all his living, and took off his coat. He built up the fire, unstrapped his swag, and arranged his blankets and garments about the stove to dry.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Macauley	If he put it on the ground it didn’t walk away. He didn’t have to wash it and comb its hair. It never had to have its buttons done up. It was never the burden to slow him down. The mood was on [MASK] again that day.
<name>Stan</name>	Stan	Macauley	The wet wind swirled in. He was cold. He felt the kid beside him shivering. He unstrapped the bluey and threw a blanket over their legs and bodies and the groundsheet over that. This was no hardship for [MASK]. This was apple and pie.
<name>Alfie</name>	Alfie	Desmond	‘What I just said,’ [MASK] replied, ‘I never thought of till just a few months ago. It took me all those years and so on to find out. And it’s too late for me to start doing anything about it now.’
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Buster	[MASK] wanted to know. ‘He’s bedded down, I suppose.’ ‘Does he go to bed early like me?’ ‘I don’t know. Just go to sleep.’ ‘Can I go over and see if he’s there?’
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Amy	‘So am I. And I’d like to have a real good chinwag. I’d ask you round, but you know how it is. It’s not my house, and [MASK] is not well and I’ve got my hands full with her.’
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Macauley	[MASK] watched him approaching and recognised him at once for what he was, a flat country bagman, a type on his own. ‘G’day, there.’ ‘G’day.’ ‘Hot, ain’t she?’ ‘Yeah, warm all right.’
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Macauley	[MASK] couldn’t tie up the wit and humour of these notices with the humourless face of the storekeeper, but he didn’t question its impossibility. Gravediggers could act like clowns; clowns like gravediggers. The storekeeper came back with the change and a small parcel.
<name>Heyst</name>	Heyst	Macauley	She dawdled off, and returned with a small newspaper parcel. She handed it to him without a word and turned away. [MASK] saw the quarter-caste girl coming out of the henhouse with a bowl of eggs. He walked down there.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Yes,’he	‘[MASK] said. ‘Even you. Even you with all your beauty and cuteness and charm; all your spirit and loyalty. The stars die and the greatest of the great trees; the fruit that comes in the gush of summer, and all the living things, great and small.
<name>Seamus</name>	Seamus	Kelly	He’d stick to the tea. 'Well, take off your hat. Put your feet up. Make yourself at home. What’s mine is yours. You know that.’ [MASK] was humming gaily as he filled the kettle and stoked the dying fire in the stove.
<name>Bluey</name>	Bluey	Macauley	He was still looking at the man. Come here, boy. Come closer. [MASK] ambled over, dropped the swag, and sat on it. He wanted to stare and he knew now that he could. He took a good searching look.
<name>Septimus</name>	Septimus	Jim	She looked up at him. ‘Look, you’re all bleedy.’ ‘What’s a bit of blood?’ He picked up the animal off her knee; dandled it. ‘You know what she calls this, [MASK]?’
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Donny	[MASK] looked about him, cornered. Then his temper flared. ‘You had no right to do this,’ he snapped at the woman. ‘I came in with you. I give you a fair go. You didn’t have to do this.’
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Donny	‘Not me. I’ve got nothing to do with it.’ [MASK] looked slowly away from him to the woman, with her hands to her face, sobbing, the savagery and desperation of the trapped animal gone.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Buster	He poured eucalyptus into his palm and rubbed [MASK]’s back, chest, and throat. Her flesh was a burning pink, laced with blue veins. It was tight on her chest and the chest was like a frail ridgy basket.
<name>She</name>	She	Buster	Walking away, he felt better for having paid his respects. [MASK] was curious. His brief answers to her questions in the cemetery had only raised in her mind a graspless conundrum. ‘What’s it called again?’ ‘What?’ That place.’
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Macauley	‘What man?’ ‘Over there, that man.’ [MASK] peered through the darkness at the glowing fire and its reflections on the nearby trees and its jumping red shadows on the ground. He saw no sign of the swagman. ‘Where’s he gone?’
<name>Mac</name>	Mac	Desmond	They don’t get dead. They die,’ [MASK] taught her. ‘They die, see? Die is the word. Well, now, why do they die? Well, it’s a habit, just like anything else. Like eating and sleeping.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Macauley	‘It’s your money. You want to see something for it. I’m not doing any more than I’m being paid for.’ ‘That’s not it. You’re doing as much as you’re being paid for.’ [MASK] shrugged.
<name>Stevie</name>	Stevie	Hinchey	‘Who?’ ‘[MASK], that mate of mine. And it wasn’t like he didn’t have any savvy or that, you know. He had plenty. That’s what I can’t understand.’
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Macauley	[MASK] poured out the tea, the colour of syrup, and sugared it. He gingerly sipped. The kid waited for hers to cool. She had the caterpillar in the pocket of her overalls, and from time to time held it open to make sure that the grub was still there.
<name>Granny</name>	Granny	Macauley	The man’s in bed.’ ‘We can bang on the gate and wake him up.’ ‘If you did that,’ [MASK] told her, ‘he’d come out and eat you, hat and all, he’d be so cranky.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Macauley	[MASK] did up the buttons, He threw a towel on her shoulder and she dawdled outside to wash her face. When she came back he had his swag rolled and strapped. She wasn’t hungry but he made her eat a piece of toast slathered with butter.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Macauley	He walked away into the freezing darkness. The cold wind cut into his bones. It seemed to come off the ice of the stars, glinting frostily in the cold remoteness of space. [MASK] couldn’t help feeling that matters were getting to a stage where they were becoming comical.
<name>Billson</name>	Billson	O’Hara	‘But I don’t think — ’ At that moment [MASK] walked in from the adjoining office. He was a thickset man with a bay window coming along nicely, and a round fat face red and glossy as a wax apple.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Bella	She sang a bar. The bell rang. She screeched four notes. The bell jangled shrilly. It went on for five minutes — [MASK] sneaking out furtive arpeggios, the bell answering; then both voice and metal dinning in unison.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Macauley	‘By cripes,’ he remarked with a shiver in his voice, ‘a man’ll want all the feathers on the bed tonight.’ He stood on the hob with his back to the fire, watching [MASK] rolling a cigarette.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Macauley	‘That’s your headache. If you wish to contest the claim you’ve got to be present in court. If not, if you don’t want representation, then you just forget about it.’ ‘What happens then?’ [MASK] said.
<name>Spender</name>	Spender	Muldoon	He walked out. The earth had gone dull. A light wind was blowing from the north, flapping and banging the canvas blind half unfurled between the verandah posts. ‘No go?’ said [MASK], reading his face.
<name>Jurgis</name>	Jurgis	Macaulay	One of the two who had attacked the third was making overtures to him, asking what had happened, and what was it all about: and the third man said he was damned if he knew; it just seemed to start over nothing. This third man lurched over to [MASK] after a while.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Macauley	He nudged his mate and gave [MASK] a tap on the cheek. ‘So long, you big softy. Come and see us again before I fill me coffin. Don’t let the undertaker be the last to let me down.’
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Desmond	‘Come on if you’re coming.' ‘You coming back?’ ‘Of course. Hurry up.’ ‘I don’t want to go,’ she said. ‘I want to stay here with [MASK] and catch fish.’
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Macauley	She sneezed, hawked, and took up the humming again. “You better go out there and wash your face,’ [MASK] said. ‘It’ll freshen you up.’ ‘All right.’ He heard her sneezing outside, spluttering and spitting.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Macauley	He pulled his hands away, dropped them at his side. His voice sounded harshly unnatural even to his own ears. ‘We’ll do all we can,’ the doctor said, unruffled, assuring. ‘All we humanly can.’ He touched [MASK]’s arm.
<name>Jerry</name>	Jerry	Macauley	It seemed to him to be a nudge of fate. He went round to the pound, and the horse, still unclaimed and apparently not even wanted by a few bidders at the sale, went to [MASK] for a song.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Macauley	His face, six inches from [MASK]’s, was like a beetroot. “You should have had that child in hospital days ago!’ he rapped. ‘I’ll make arrangements to have her taken there straight away.’
<name>John</name>	John	Macauley	He lifted her out onto the ground, distracted in his rage, not knowing what to say or where to start. The woman put a foot out of the door and moved her body forward. ‘Get back in there,’ [MASK] said.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Macauley	‘Okay. I’ll be over soon.’ [MASK] sat on his bunk and pulled the letter from his pocket. He looked at it for a minute, breathing hard; then he opened it. He felt the ends of his fingers tingle as he read.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Buster	He was feeling the strain when he got back to the hospital. There was a fatigue all through him. It came not so much from physical exertion as from an ordeal of spirit. [MASK] was still unconscious. They were fighting for her life.
<name>He</name>	He	Macauley	The voice wanted to know if it would call her to the phone. [MASK] told him no, he would come around. “You’!! have to make it soon, sir, if you want to catch her.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Macauley	He brought the teapot over to the small table. ‘It would be my bloody luck, too, to have to go to work today of all days, but — ’ ‘Hell, you go through . . . ’ [MASK] gestured.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Marge	He had his hand on the knob. He heard the quick steps on the stairs, and the knob was turned from the other side. He swung back as the door opened and was behind it. ‘Hell, [MASK], you still on it.’
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Macauley	They screamed for help when the game got real. The second, they were so often in the saddling paddock it wasn’t natural. Yet, [MASK] realised as he thought of her that the girl meant nothing to him.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Kelly	‘Got a few things to dry out, kid needs a sleep, and a rest won’t hurt me either.’ He broke off suddenly, the import of [MASK]’s words just striking him, and looked across the table.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Macauley	But even his good humour was blunted by [MASK]’s moody silence and laconic replies; and in a little while his enthusiastic crusade dwindled to a few simple platitudes about rain and wool and the state of the country. He went outside, and came back five minutes later, rubbing his hands and scrooging his shoulders.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Donny	‘[MASK], listen — ’ There was a note of panic in her voice. ‘Listen, nothing! I told you how I stood. As long as there was no fuss, I said. I don’t want my name dragged through the scandal sheets.
<name>Tin-bum</name>	Tin-bum	Sweeney	I remember.’ ‘And what do I do?’ [MASK] said. ‘I come up with a stone worth five hundred quid. I come up with the Black Beauty, and from then on I never look back. Tin-bum, they call me.
