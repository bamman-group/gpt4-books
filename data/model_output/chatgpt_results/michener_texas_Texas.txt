<name>Antarctica</name>	Antarctica	Weaklings	“Everything is of a vast dimension and we need men with vast potential to help us achieve what we’ve planned. [MASK] will be erased, by the climate and the distance if by nothing else, but the strong will find themselves growing even stronger.

<name>the engineer</name>	the engineer	Reuben	He had mastered the technique of mending the leather belts when they tore; he knew how to guard the water supply to the engine; he knew what types of wood to cut for stoking the engine; and he, better even than [MASK], appreciated the subtle interlocking relationships of the four components.
<name>him</name>	him	Simon	“We should of slowed [MASK] down years ago.” “Once they go to college, they should never be allowed back.” And that was how the Bravo Incident, which commanded the national press for several months, began.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Beth	It then looked as if [MASK] was going to solve the problem by refusing to eat until she starved; poetry, math, her designs for a new fabric, all were forgotten in her determination to be one of the gang and to gain the plaudits of her fellow students.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Peavine	Through long practice Rattlesnake [MASK] could bring that bad arm up across his belt, providing a rocklike platform on which to rest the gun as it was being fired, and the action was so swift and smooth that even close watchers could not detect exactly what had happened.
<name>Jerry</name>	Jerry	Jaxifer	This land won’t be worth fifty cents an acre.” In real anxiety he threw on his clothes and dashed out to where the Cobb horses were stabled, and calling for [MASK], he leaped into the saddle.
<name>Chip</name>	Chip	Ransom	“Tell you what. [MASK]. We call in the fence people and have them add a projection around the upper edge, so that when the armadillos reach the top of the fence, they’ll run into this screen curving back at them and fall off.”
<name>the commander</name>	the commander	Fannin	The next three were worse, for the Mexican gunners now had exact range, and before the next salvo could be fired, several junior officers consulted with their men and reported to [MASK]: “No hope with those cannon raking us. You must surrender.”
<name>lunch</name>	lunch	Ernst	In response she rang the bell which the Allerkamp women used for signaling their men—two short, two long for [MASK]—and in a moment he came from the fields, delighted to see his brother-in-law.
<name>Helen</name>	Helen	Trinidad	The first of them came in the gracious town of Saltillo, for here [MASK] saw her first community of any size, and she was awed by its magnificence: “It is so big! There are so many shops! A person could find anything in the world here!”
<name>Wormley</name>	Wormley	Grenzler	As soon as that fearful word emigrate was spoken, the slouching Margrave stiffened, his hands gripped the griffin armrests, and he rose to an impressive standing position. “Never speak to me of leaving [MASK]. We need you here.”
<name>Grant</name>	Grant	Travis	We were supposed to share a joint command, [MASK] in charge of the army men, me in charge of the volunteers.” “That’s what I’m sayin’. Us volunteers want to fight under your orders.”
<name>the third man</name>	the third man	Rusk	“The woman we tarred-and-feathered?” “The same.” “Well,” announced a third man, “he sure as hell ain’t havin’ sex with someone like her.” “But it don’t look good,” [MASK] said.
<name>Mr. Cobb</name>	Mr. Cobb	Somerset	The Cobb mansion, which at the present had no girls to marry off, but which soon would when [MASK]’s daughter matured, was, from the street, a modest red-brick structure of three stories, with two ordinary-looking windows on each floor but no door for entrance.
<name>Heidi</name>	Heidi	Allerkamp	Live oak, post oak, ash and hickory showed their rounded forms against the sky, with cedars standing darker in the background. “It’s not like a proper German forest,” [MASK] said, “but it will do.” “What’s different?”
<name>Queequeg</name>	Queequeg	Ripperda	“You must not tell me to go to hell,” [MASK] said with an easy laugh. “I have learned that superiors have powers which. . .” He stopped. “If I did, where would you send me?”
<name>Aunt Alexandra</name>	Aunt Alexandra	Mattie	“We’ll kill a couple more deer or somethin’, and things’ll be all right.” As they prepared to leave, [MASK] asked: “Have you papers stating that the land is yours?” and when they replied yes, she told them: “Half the battle’s won.
<name>Jett Rink</name>	Jett Rink	Paul	Name your price.” “I’m not selling.” “[MASK], you got no mineral rights. You got no leasin’ rights. To you this is just so much rock and grama grass. You’ll never do anything with it. I need it.”
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Garza	I sorely need a carpenter, and [MASK] is one of the best. Please give this request your prayerful consideration. S.S.Q.B.L.M. de V.R. PA. Dios G. a V.R.M. Ahs. The formalized signature was to be read: “Su servidor que besa la mano de Vuestra Reverencia.
<name>Juan</name>	Juan	Otto	Collecting a few onions from her garden and red chili peppers that grew wild, she followed an unbroken ritual, which she explained to [MASK] in her flowing Spanish: “You must have two pans. Brown the meat in this one so it looks good.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Yancey	“Why don’t we shoot them in daylight?” [MASK] asked, and his father said: “Nothin’ in this world harder to shoot on the ground than a turkey. They got nine extra senses and a bell which rings if an enemy steps close: ‘Trouble out there!’
<name>someone</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	someone (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	Muzquiz	He was accurate in every statement he made about [MASK], but there were a few crucial facts which the persistent Mexican worker had succeeded in keeping hidden. He did smile all the time, even when captured at the railway yards, and he was a good citizen in both his countries.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Yancey	But when he saw that she was preparing to mix a dough using most of his flour, he protested: “No, ma’am! No!” and he told her that in backwoods Tejas they used half flour, half acorn, and he proceeded to take [MASK] with him to gather the latter.
<name>she</name>	she	Bertha	The children looked as if they were going to have their grandfather’s ranging height and their grandmother’s lively attitude toward the world about them. They showed no signs of being especially intelligent, but [MASK] did seem to have her mother’s gift for organizing her little world in the way she wanted.
<name>Kurtz</name>	Kurtz	Alvaro	He felt old, and futile, and superseded. “Let’s look at what you and I have accomplished,” [MASK] proposed, and he recited their litany of constructive deeds: “We brought order to a region which knew it not.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Otto	Surely you can learn to throw a rope.” But [MASK] could not. His hands were small and his arms short, and when he tried to twirl the stiff and heavy rope about his head in great circles, he not only got it tangled but he nearly succeeded in strangling himself.
<name>the chieftain</name>	the chieftain	Matark	Finally the older spoke: “We shall be pushed to the sunset death.” “But not quickly,” [MASK] said, betraying the tragic strategy he intended following. “No!” the younger of the two sages cried, happy to hear the courage in his chieftain’s voice.
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Ole	Then a most winsome smile took possession of her curiously tilted mouth, and she gave a childlike leap in the air and shouted: “[MASK]! How wonderful!” She maintained this level of excitement for several days as the great trip was planned.
<name>Sheriff</name>	Sheriff	Otto	Arguments were settled not with carefully marshaled words but with fists or a flashing Bowie knife. [MASK] was by no means afraid of a fight; he knew from experience that he could control adversaries much bigger than he, but he saw that to engage endlessly in brawling was not productive.
<name>the community</name>	the community	Larkin	They handled the newspaper with restraint. First they approached the editor, in masks, and explained their lofty motives, pointing out the many good things they had done for [MASK], like eliminating vice and increasing church membership, but they made little impression on the young man.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Otto	[MASK] was first to pull apart the knot about the neck, and slowly the purple in the hanged man’s face began to subside, until at last he was able to whisper: “Thank you, son.”
<name>Cabeza de Vaca</name>	Cabeza de Vaca	Damian	When they finally negotiated the swollen Neches, they came upon rude buildings in which new missions were being attempted, but their success seemed doubtful, and as [MASK] bade these Franciscans goodbye, it was with a sense of futility.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Emma	Most of them had actually prospered back home, and this had enabled them to leave their abandoned wives in rather gratifying security: “You can have the store and the fields, [MASK]. I’ll not be needin’ them.”
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Emma	“Your son’s a difficult boy, [MASK]. I don’t like him.” She was tempted to say “I don’t, either,” but instead she pleaded: “Please take him. It may be his last chance.”
<name>John</name>	John	Rusk	the Indian men? They? emma: I told you they came to my bed at night. One after another. (At this appalling news, which he had not fully comprehended before, [MASK] drew away from the girl, a fact which she noticed and accepted. )
<name>Virginians</name>	Virginians	Virginians	“I suppose that’s right,” she said. “I sometimes see the next fifty years as a protracted effort by the South to reestablish its leadership of the nation. We Carolinians and [MASK] aren’t powerful enough to do it by ourselves.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Jubal	The roof they wove of heavier vines, covering it with sod so that grass would grow and keep it impervious. When all was done, [MASK] said: “We got us a house half in the air, half in the cave.
<name>Karankawa</name>	Karankawa	Braves	he shouted in meaningless syllables, trying to grasp with his bare hand the rifle barrels whose fiery discharges tore him apart. In terrible struggle the mighty Karankawa died. [MASK] ... old men . . . women . . . little girls . . . boys defying the rifles.
<name>Genghis</name>	Genghis	Garcilago	I deplored his way with women. But in the long view of history, what are a few women, more or less?” This rhetorical question brought a most unexpected consequence: “[MASK], my son, I have been most eager to find you.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Yeager	“Go around! Surely you could add one more gate.” “The fence stands,” [MASK] said, terminating that conversation. Less than a week later, one of the ranch hands rode in with sickening news: “Come see what they done.”
<name>Conan</name>	Conan	Finlay	“A good man,” the Campbell henchman grunted, “but the fee for passing here is two of your beasts,” and when [MASK] started to protest, he growled: “No beasts, no passage.”
<name>some possible options are: Donald Trump, white people, Americans, etc.</name>	some possible options are: Donald Trump, white people, Americans, etc.	Texans	One of the reasons why [MASK] distrust Mexicans, or even despise them at times, they can’t play football. Quite pitiful, really. Put them on a horse, they can swagger. But the one game that matters, they can’t play.”
<name>America</name>	America	Emma	If he had a vision of a new world, she must listen, and when she did she heard the voice of the future: “Thy empty land, [MASK], must produce something. Thy empty houses were made to protect families.
<name>John Wesley Powell</name>	John Wesley Powell	Rusk	Inexorably the movements launched by [MASK] to turn his village into a proper town continued, often in directions he had not anticipated. With the first four keystones in place—store, school, saloon, bank— he was free to turn his attention to the next three: churches, newspaper, railroad.
<name>Cynthia</name>	Cynthia	Floyd	But when she removed her heavy wooden nose, the one carved in oak by her hus- band, and [MASK] saw her again as she was, the experience was so crushing that he fled from the house, weighed down by his haunting images of his mother in the hands of her Comanche captors.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Marr	“I am pleased to accept a communication from the distinguished family I had expected to be allied with mine.” He took the letters and was about to shut the door when [MASK] grabbed his left sleeve. “Is it true what they said?
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Talbot	From a distance [MASK], marking their progress through field glasses, saw the father instruct his children as to how they must run to leap aboard the moving freight. He saw the engine getting up steam, the surreptitious movement of illegals edging toward the still-motionless boxcars, and he could feel the tension.
<name>Eli Whitney</name>	Eli Whitney	Sett	Patting the gin, he said: “You are our shield in battle.” Then he laughed: “How ironical history can be, [MASK]. Maybe the greatest invention of mankind, certainly of our South, and the genius who made it earned not a penny.”
<name>Hiram</name>	Hiram	Garza	“What do you mean?” “I lay out the work. Where the beams should go and how they should be fastened. But he does all the lifting, the really hard work.” [MASK] was correct.
<name>Laurence</name>	Laurence	Cobb	There it stood in the sandy desert, full scale, and to it came Shakespearean actors from many different theaters and countries to orate the soaring lines of the master. “We don’t do many of his historical plays,” the director told [MASK].
<name>John</name>	John	Campbell	The birth of a child forced [MASK] to decide what he thought about baptism, and the more he studied the Bible the more convinced he became that Presbyterians were out of step with the New Testament when they merely sprinkled a baby and called that baptism, while the Baptists were correct to insist upon total immersion.
<name>can</name>	can	Indians	You [MASK] can earn it too, and if you do, it adorns life.” Tears came to his eyes as he added: “I’ve always tried to preserve my honor, and have done nothing of which I am ashamed.”
<name>unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Kimbro	Just when.” “What do you mean?” “I’ve spotted a field you have to put under ledse. And then you have to pay for the exploration well.” “Now look, [MASK] . . .” “No, you look.
<name>Maverick</name>	Maverick	Quimper	A task force, sleek ships speeding through the night. Your mission is extremely important.” “We may be your Task Force,” [MASK] said, “but I’ll bet you don’t want us to fire any big guns.”
<name>John</name>	John	Cobb	One hundred and twenty miles long, packed solid, no boat can move.” “Then why have we come here?” [MASK] asked, and the men gave a startling reply: “Miracles! Bring your children up here and they’ll see miracles.”
<name>Kurtz</name>	Kurtz	Panther	“I stood guard in the street. I figured [MASK] and his men, they could handle it.” “Did you see the guerrillas? You, yourself?” “Twice. When they ran in. When they were dead.”
<name>Burt</name>	Burt	Otto	On the sixth day [MASK] rose as usual, shaved, donned his usual dress, breakfasted with the boarders, then went to the stables, where he mounted his horse, adjusted the two pistols at his waist, and rode to where the Bates brothers lived at the eastern end of town.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Rusk	Welcome to the big time.” He returned instantly to his conversation with [MASK], for in his book I was worth three seconds. The third person I turned to was a tall patrician woman in her late sixties, beautifully dressed, beautifully groomed.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Wellington	“It is indeed,” [MASK] said, and the Texas man added: “The scrip solves ever’thin’, and the day after you get your land you can revert to bein’ a Baptist again. I did.” “I’m Presbyterian.”
<name>he</name>	he	Macnab	At election time he policed the polls, keeping away troublemakers and suspected liberals. After the votes were counted, he saw to it that any complaints were muffled, and if the protester pursued his objections, [MASK] helped muscle him out of the area.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Wetzel	The tangled reflections of the two impatient soldiers were broken by the appearance of the young Ranger. “Where are you going?” [MASK] asked and the boy replied: “To lead the niggers to where the trails meet.” “Who told you to do that?”
<name>Juana</name>	Juana	Betsy	With three rifles, two knives, a pistol and a nondescript collection of clothes, he started for the decisive battle which he knew could not be avoided. [MASK] insisted on following him, but when they came to the ford by which he would cross the Guadalupe he told her sternly: “Go home.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Rusk	“What’s your point?” asked [MASK], who had been rocked by many of the disasters. “Point is, I respect a state that can spring back, pull up its socks, and forge ahead as if nothing had happened. And I like the way
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Vigil	“Come voting day, it’ll have more.” But even so, [MASK] knew that he needed some additional miracle to win, and next morning it arrived, for at about noon a man came shouting: “Dead girl! In the bushes by the river!”
<name>the enemy's</name>	the enemy's	Quimper	We’ve instituted a legal draft, and they refused to comply. . . . This is war, and they killed some of our good men. But no matter how he rationalized [MASK]’s actions, he could construct no justification.
<name>Leonardo</name>	Leonardo	Earnshaw	And it must grow better as years and decades and centuries pass.” And then, as if to prove his point, he asked [MASK] to fetch the large package from his room, and when an easel was provided, he stunned his audience with a beautifully executed watercolor he had completed earlier.
<name>Amir</name>	Amir	Floyd	She had known great terror in her life, and little love apart from that which her daydreaming husband had given so freely, so she cherished every manifestation made in her behalf. [MASK] was her son, and at one accidental point in his miserable life he had loved her.
<name>Ghost</name>	Ghost	Mummy	They’re in excellent physical condition. But they’re only fifteen-percent occupied. Frozen tears. Monuments to dreams gone wrong.” “[MASK], why would you want to get mixed up with such a failure?”
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Weatherby	“We are not,” [MASK] snarled, as if he were furiously mad at some unseen force. “The people we gave money and land to will remember us. But now I’m asking for one last contribution. From everyone.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Thekla	About this time he met [MASK] during a walking tour through the countryside west of the capital, and once he saw this woodland sprite, blond and lively and with a voice like a woodthrush, he knew that they must marry and earn their living as they could.
<name>Zaroff</name>	Zaroff	Trinidad	A tooth missing in front. A deep voice. To tell you the truth, [MASK], he was really rather frightening.” “How did you speak to him? I mean, if he didn’t know Spanish?” “Oh, but he did!
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Damian	wherever he goes.” “Was he not rebuked for lewd dancing?” [MASK] ignored this painful charge, shifting the emphasis: “From our ranch he attempts to bring peace to the Apache ...” “I’d be terrified to move anywhere near them.”
<name>John</name>	John	Cobb	Sentenced to work with those Texans.” “Are you aware that we’ve sent your name up for promotion?” “Too late.” “You mean you won’t accept it if it comes through?” [MASK] was polite but resolute: “No, sir.”
<name>the General</name>	the General	Wetzel	A muted call, which could be heard only yards away, was sounded and the force of thirty-eight blue-clad troopers spurred their horses into an easy trot. They had gone only a few miles when another scout reported the news which [MASK] had intuitively feared: “Major battle.
<name>Munnings</name>	Munnings	Stubbs	In the short time we’ve worked we’ve come up with a dazzling list of how artists have portrayed men engaged in sports. Ancient Greek statues, Roman athletes, Degas jockeys, [MASK]’ unmatched portraits of racing horses.” “Never heard of that one.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Rattlesnake	earnshaw: Did thee ever hear them call him [MASK]? emma: No, but things were always better for me when he came, because he brought guns and other things and for a while they forgot me. (She weighed her next comment carefully.)
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Ramon	Invariably, when he visited their home at the presidio he brought them little presents, sometimes so trivial they could scarcely be called presents, but so thoughtful that they proved his continuing love. He had always been especially fond of [MASK], a bright, eager lad now eleven and thirsty for knowledge of the world.
<name>Fitzgerald</name>	Fitzgerald	Absalom	Catching [MASK] as he tended his horses, they tomahawked him immediately and made off with about half the animals. They then struck the westernmost of the huts before the occupants could organize its defense, and with total superiority, overwhelmed it, killing the wife and her two children but saving the husband for ritual tortures.
<name>Hiroshima</name>	Hiroshima	Franza	[MASK] would not find her brother’s body. Some mesmerized survivors would not even be able to identify where their houses had once stood, for when Friday noon arrived, and the sun was back in its full August brilliance, it looked down upon a town that was totally destroyed.
<name>The Laughing Man</name>	The Laughing Man	Domingo	“Is [MASK] really a holy man?” “He’s a good man, and sometimes that’s better.” “His goodness, what does it consist of?” “He brings happiness in his sack . . . wherever he goes.”
<name>Captain</name>	Captain	Alvaro	[MASK] asked, and the governor tapped the letter: “No mention of it.” But the colonel interrupted: “These are good men, Captain. I shall recommend that they work as a team, and I pray that you will second it.”
<name>cats</name>	cats	Meskins	Don’t trust them. And I expect to give them an order only once. But I am certainly not prejudiced against them. I have solved many murders involving only [MASK] and will do so again if called upon. But you cannot force me to like them.”
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Marr	It was a case of the brutal converting the brute, and one Sunday at service the dour priest was able to announce, while pointing with satisfaction to where [MASK] sat: “Today the last unbeliever in our town has joined the Holy Church, and we welcome him.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Rusk	Then he made an offer which staggered the men: “Now, you don’t have to pay in full. If you wish to extend your mortgage, the bank would be most happy ...” “We’ll pay,” [MASK] said.
<name>John</name>	John	Ludwig	Very quietly [MASK] told his sons: “Let’s lay out an area of ten thousand acres.” “Our scrip allows only two thousand.” “We’ll pay for the extra.” “How?”
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Quimper	I’d like to see him stay here. Let’s signify our acceptance by inviting him to serve on our jury.” No member of the committee listened to the evidence with closer attention than [MASK], and when the time came for the first crucial vote, he experienced no uncertainty.
<name>Rainsford</name>	Rainsford	Benito	[MASK] met the bride, a lively, attractive girl of nineteen whose mother had succeeded in protecting her from half a dozen officers who had tried to capture her: “She marries, this one, and that’s the only way.”
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Garcilago	During the summer months we ate only blackberries. Best of the year came when we moved inland and gorged on tunas.” “I love tunas,” [MASK] interrupted. “I’ve eaten them many times when I was hungry. Were yours the same as ours?”
<name>he</name>	he	Garza	And he proceeded to unfold a story so improbable that [MASK] sat riveted: “When my father enrolled at the university, there was a kind of secret society—all the important men on campus, those judged to be winners. There were arcane rites, secret handgrips ...
<name>Wiglaf</name>	Wiglaf	Bonham	His army lost. All but five killed. Yet he comes back alive to report. How? Aware that he had wasted precious hours listening to such men demean themselves, [MASK] saluted his unworthy superiors and told them that he must get on with his duty.
<name>Amos</name>	Amos	Jubal	Almost before the sound could be heard, a turkey dropped from the tree, and with a speed that startled his son, [MASK] reached for his second gun. But the noise and the unexpected speed startled the boy, who did not deliver as promised.
<name>Lincoln</name>	Lincoln	Millicent	“Emancipation Proclamation! Rubbish. The most cynical thing that evil man in the White House ever did.” “Some day the slaves will have to be freed,” [MASK] protested. “Many would agree with you,” the old man said.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Emil	He said no more as they mounted their horses, then added: “We could never understand why she refused. She never mentioned your name until tonight. When [MASK] told us that you were at the Nimitz house.” “What did she say?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Yancey	Each of the men had suggestions: “Swim across and leave the cart here.” Or “Cut two logs, wedge them under the wheels, and float it across.” Even [MASK] chimed in: “Cut grapevines and we’ll pull it across.”
<name>Enrique</name>	Enrique	Domingo	cried [MASK], and from a corner of a small package inside the larger peeked a swatch of blue cloth, and when he opened his prize with trembling fingers he led up for all to see a most beautiful blue habit with hood and belt and flowing folds.
<name>Cortés</name>	Cortés	Cardenas	But [MASK], infuriated by the attack on his horses, was so determined to demonstrate the power of the Spanish army that he ordered his other soldiers to surround these men who had honorably surrendered, and then to cut two hundred wooden stakes, each six feet tall, at which the prisoners would be burned alive.
<name>him</name> (There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to an unspecified person)	him (There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to an unspecified person)	Klinowitz	Without telling [MASK] that he had been forced to unload the options, he went to him and said: “I think I’d better stay closer to town. The kind of market I’m in. I have eight thousand tied up in these two options on FM-1960.
<name>partner</name>	partner	Kimbro	“The big companies depend on little men like me to find oil for them. Then they move in, fast. We get our small profit. They get their big haul.” “I want the big haul, [MASK].” “So do I.
<name>Jay Gatsby</name>	Jay Gatsby	Todd	We hock everything we have. We look for distress bargains, and we buy it to the hilt.” When they had done this, and exhausted their own funds, [MASK] said: “The luscious plums, the real big ones, are beginning to ripen.
