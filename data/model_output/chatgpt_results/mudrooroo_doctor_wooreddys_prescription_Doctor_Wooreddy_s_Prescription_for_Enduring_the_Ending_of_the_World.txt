<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Waau	‘The white men have taken part of the land near the coast, and they will not allow us to burn any of it now,’ [MASK] explained —and the magic and peace of the day disappeared into the harsh reality which the strangers had given them.
<name>Magwitch</name>	Magwitch	Robinson	‘Hit’ll ’aveta,’ the convict answered insolently, forgetting that he was addressing someone other than [MASK]. ‘Get it done immediately and then get out of the station,’ the commandant ordered, acknowledging his insolence, but happily aware that the tic had subsided to a slight quiver.
<name>The woman</name>	The woman	Trugernanna	Now both lay on their sides facing each other. Leaving out further variations he returned to the first position and contented himself with varying the rhythm. [MASK] was bewildered by so much movement. She had not experienced anything like it before. It reminded her a little of dancing.
<name>his predecessor</name>	his predecessor	Arthur	This person was completely different from [MASK]; he had issued no instructions and expected the Chief Protector not only to supervise thousands of Aborigines scattered over thousands of square kilometres, but also to prevent 'clashes between them and those Europeans that had taken up selections on their land.
<name>black</name>	black	Wurundjeri	‘Those men,’ he said, indicating the ones that had accosted them, ‘are [MASK] and rough fellows. You will see this in their dancing. We are the masters of any ceremonies here. But we are doing only rubbish dancing today, just for the white fellows.
<name>Doctor</name>	Doctor	Fader	Then he saw and felt the sickness all around him and surrendered. It seemed a small price to pay for survival. ‘[MASK]’ gave him some white powder for his wife’s sickness. He mixed it in water and gave it to her to drink.
<name>Whites</name>	Whites	Fader	The Great Conciliator strongly believed that Aborigines should be segregated from Europeans until they could be raised to a superior stage of Christian civilisation. The women prepared damper while the beloved tea stewed in the pot. They discussed the day’s journey in a dialect which ‘[MASK]’ would not know.
<name>La Guera</name>	La Guera	Walyer	They were still crying, just like women! For some reason he thought of the guerrilla leader, [MASK], and of how she had given up so easily and died so easily. He had not given up until there was little left to give up.
<name>Aragorn</name>	Aragorn	Waau	Perhaps one day I will feel like going back,' he finished with all the wistfulness of an exile. ‘We all have been in this place for too long,’ [MASK] said. ‘It is time we went south. You can travel with us, but we go slowly.
<name>the leader</name>	the leader	Wooreddy	Half of the men stooped down and put their hands on the backs of their companions. Imitating horses they galloped around the ring while [MASK] and the women sang: Larekoyer koey henna warame Larekoyer koey henna warame Kolelebe bekonena tarlarne may Mar mar porrenne toomatta Tar payar marawoe Tar payar marawoe.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Wooreddy	He still consoled himself with the thought that it was the times, and the num skin did hide his manhood scars. Not so very long ago, [MASK] had prided himself on showing the serried rows of arc-shaped scars which showed the degrees of initiation he had passed.
<name>Shadow</name>	Shadow	Wooreddy	Eventually even that trailed off in a general boredom. [MASK] and the stranger, who had been eyeing and weighing each other before they had been distracted by the ghostly wrangling, now took the opportunity to introduce themselves formally.
<name>Albert</name>	Albert	Robinson	White women looked and delicately shuddered at some half-naked black man, then cast their eyes to their saviour —[MASK] came out of his dream staring directly at an apparition from the past: an Aborigine, with his long red-greased locks drifting about his smiling face.
<name>Mr. Morris</name>	Mr. Morris	Ummarrah	‘It’s red powder from the ghosts,’ [MASK] said, noting the direction of his eyes; then he began to reply to the question. ‘They have families as we do, but they are not very important to them.
<name>Babe</name>	Babe	Robinson	The shepherd concentrated on scratching his thin, sandy hair. [MASK] thought he looked like some sort of hog. ‘So thirty or so were done away with, were they?’ The hog nodded his head and fluttered his straw-coloured eyelashes down over his little piggy eyes.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Trugernanna	[MASK] recognised the latter as the ghost that had raped her. Hatred flashed in her eyes. She had vowed to pay him back one day and she would! He had been brutal and she had never forgotten his pale blue eyes, the rattish face and the white hair now thinning on his pointy head.
<name>girl</name>	girl	Alpha	She’ll never make a maid, just as that [MASK] won’t make a cook’s helper. It ain’t in them. All they can do is die and good riddance too, I say. They’re the lucky ones.
<name>Queenie</name>	Queenie	Walyer	And so he marched his ‘sable friends’ off to prison. When he arrived there next morning, he found that the savage amazon, [MASK], the pride of his collection, had collapsed. He thought the others took it well as he strode off to see the major.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Wooreddy	He walked onto the beach thinking of charms and omens, mysteries and things hidden in the dark cave of the mind. Though only a small boy, [MASK] already had wriggled many times to the side of the few irascible old men as they sat theorising on life and its mysteries.
<name>Magwitch</name>	Magwitch	gub’nor	Out hunting, he thought, and turned his attention back to the convicts to find them standing before the fire with nothing cooking on it. His peevish voice urged them on. ‘Can’t do no cooking, [MASK], ain’t no grub,’ a convict finally volunteered.
<name>the Commandant</name>	the Commandant	Robinson	They did not know it, but since [MASK] had forbidden hunting the animals were increasing. These they placed up into the branch of a tree well out of the reach of any wild dogs, though most of these had been shot, by order of the Commandant, by the soldiers of the establishment.
<name>Neville</name>	Neville	Marie	[MASK], I have my responsibilities. I am a civil servant, The Chief Protector of Aborigines!’ ‘You may be that,’ his wife cut in bitterly, anger quelling her sobs, ‘and you may be something more.
<name>Robin</name>	Robin	Wooreddy	[MASK] began to sing: The pigeon sits in the cider tree; He sits in the cider tree sorting the seeds; Letting the best fall one by one into the hollow, Into the hollow, filling the hollow, waiting for The rain, the rain to come, to come to touch the seeds.
<name>the ghost</name>	the ghost	Robinson	He looked at the two stubby poles with the crosstrees and crumpled heaps of sail. He watched [MASK] standing at the stern in a uniform of his own devising which could be termed vaguely nautical. The ghost shouted a command at the ones in yellow coats to hoist sail.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Wooreddy	Down where the land faces the sea across which you came, often white men put into the bays there. If you go down there, you might be able to get a boat to take you across.’ ‘I won’t go back,’ [MASK] declared.
<name>George</name>	George	Robinson	[MASK] acquired objects as bargains, but his wife clung to them as possessions. He equated money with security, but she with things, and so the table pushed them to the margins of the room and the little spaces between chairs and sideboards and cupboards and dressers.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Wooreddy	[MASK] watched him do this. Did he stand in a strong enough relationship to ask about the spell which empowered them? He knew the Bruny spell and would have liked to compare it with that of the Stoney Creek Nation.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Robinson	These poor heathens must be saved and I will save them. I have been ordained to do this by God Almighty Himself . . .’ [MASK] lapsed into a religious rapture born of his delirium. The words continued to dribble from his lips.
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Mangana	They lived through it right to the final ashes. [MASK] left mental pain to wander in physical pain. He relived the time he had been washed out to sea. His waterlogged catamaran sagged beneath his weight and every wave washed over him.
<name>atlatl</name>	atlatl	woomera	‘Too heavy,’ he grunted, as he balanced it. ‘Impossible,’ he said, as he tried to fit the end into his spear-thrower. ‘Our weapons are superior,’ he declared fitting spear to [MASK] and letting fly at a tree.
<name>he</name>	he	Wooreddy	Sometimes he detailed a mark with a terse sentence, but more often he did not break the peace. The trees stretched high into the sky —and here and there [MASK] noticed that the land was falling into disrepair.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Trugernanna	Now she disappeared and he could find no trace of her. Suddenly she materialised at his feet and sprang off. He followed closely. [MASK] came to the edge of a low cliff and scrambled down a narrow path which led to a shallow cave.
<name>Meg</name>	Meg	Trugernanna	Someone swapped a bag of wheat for a bag of spuds. Decided to plant it to see if it came up right. It didn’t,’ he said scornfully, jerking a thumb at the miserable straw. [MASK] walked hand-in-hand with her sister.
<name>Miss Watson</name>	Miss Watson	Wooreddy	He wanted to separate the few remaining children from their heathen parents so that they could be educated free from bad examples. Now he complained of those bad examples to [MASK]. They were not to wander where they wished, but were to stay with him, their only protector.
<name>Wallaby</name>	Wallaby	Mangana	If only he had a companion such as [MASK]! Alone, he devised a tactic and ran straight at the kangaroo. At the very last moment he bounded to the left. Animals were like human beings and usually favoured the right side —but not always.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Wooreddy	You are guests here and not prisoners. You are free to go whenever you wish.’ He ignored the locked door. The Governor was a bad speaker and might have rambled on for some time, if [MASK] had not broken in: ‘Our friend is very sick.’
<name>Mr. Bucket</name>	Mr. Bucket	Robinson	‘Your Excellency,’ [MASK] began, ‘I bring with me one of those poor creatures to which I have devoted myself at the expense of my other business —and my wife and children’ he added, remembering how his wife had complained of his absence from home.
<name>Convict</name>	Convict	McKay	He gave him not only the requisition order, but a number. [MASK] guessed that too many things were going missing from the store and that the Superintendent had instituted a system to prevent the pillage. Eventually, after an hour, the convict returned with the bag of flour.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Wooreddy	[MASK] carefully finished the ritual and spell. Everything had been just right. A mistake, even a tiny one, might cause disaster. Gingerly, he pushed the craft into the surf until it floated. After putting the two boys aboard, he scrambled on.
<name>Lucie</name>	Lucie	Trugernanna	If the man’s repeated two words were not enough for the ghost, [MASK]’s seeming rapture equalled his own. She stood beside him, her face uplifted, her brown eyes fixed on his nose while her small body trembled under the sack-like dress she wore.
<name>Tallahassee</name>	Tallahassee	Obarton	‘Well, after it was all hover, we thought that some folks might not like it hovermuch if it should get about. What with that governor away down in ’[MASK] making his proclamations and what all. They went in where they drove hover the sheep.’
<name>The narrator</name>	The narrator	Waau	There are few ghosts around here and they won’t be after us yet.’ [MASK] knew nothing of what had happened: If he had he might have taken precautions and moved the camp away from the cattle ranch which had been established a few kilometres away.
<name>Mac</name>	Mac	Waau	He would ask [MASK] about it. Perhaps they could go together and test their different methods. They came to the edge of a small swamp and made their first halt. The men gathered wood and carefully positioned their own fires in the ordered pattern which showed the family and clan alignment.
<name>Aboriginals</name>	Aboriginals	Waau	That is why the water is so sweet.’ [MASK] cooked the wallaby in an earth oven. They feasted on the meat, then lay back content as the evening fell and stars began flickering in the purple sky.
<name>Martha's</name>	Martha's	Wooreddy	All along the rocky female coastline, clinging in mute desperation to the last vestiges of the land, shell- and crayfish hung waiting to be gathered. [MASK] belonged to a rich island, but the surrounding sea was dangerous and filled with dangerous scale fish.
<name>rumor</name>	rumor	Trugernanna	New things and places appealed to him, but he was passing over the land at too fast a rate to enjoy and discover things about it. It still felt dead and filled with dread. They had come across no recent traces of the local people and [MASK] said that they had all been killed.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Waau	They slowly retraced their steps. Now there was no hurry and sooner or later they would catch up with the rest of the people. Seafood was plentiful and [MASK] had no qualms about entering the surf to harvest it.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Wooreddy	[MASK] had chosen a straight line rather than a curved one, as this was the good luck sign for a future filled with food. A curve meant a wish for children; an oval, faithfulness— both these things meant little in these times.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Robinson	The lines running from the corners of his mouth had deepened to give him a perpetually sour look, in harmony with the perpetual frown on his forehead. His Excellency bent his head to finish off the sentence he had been writing when [MASK] entered the room.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Ummarrah	He treated me worse that day than he had the need to. It was inhuman! Well, I have paid him back. I shot him and [MASK] shot one of the others. But the rest escaped in their boat before we could grab it.
<name>John</name>	John	Wooreddy	He did not know, but it had all been arranged. [MASK] was a good catch. A successful hunter and a thoughtful man who would think twice before putting himself in the forefront of the battles which were becoming more fearful and bloody as the ghosts took more and more land.
<name>Miranda</name>	Miranda	Mangana	This was what made her important to him —though she did have the body of a good provider! The track ended in a clearing at the side of a long sweeping bay. Here he found [MASK] much the same as seven years ago.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Wooreddy	‘Everything comes in twos, but behind them stands only one.’ [MASK] felt himself recoiling from what the man was saying. The sea boomed not far away, though close at hand it appeared calm — too calm, and he wanted to run and hide.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Ballawine	The way I see it, is that the only logical thing to do is to go and see the ghost we call [MASK], and hear what he has to say. In that way you will be able to come to a correct decision.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Trugernanna	Near him sat [MASK] and before him stood the four rough sealers and their rougher womenfolk. Beyond them the red clay bank rose to support the roots of trees, and in the distance jagged mountains pierced the sky. Such a sylvan scene filled the Great Conciliator’s heart with delight.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Wooreddy	The darkness of the night-hidden land allied itself with the hidden, green, deep fears of the ocean. [MASK] could feel it lapping about his middle and touching him with chilly fingers, cold as the white wetness he had once felt in the inland mountains.
<name>him</name>	him	Robinson	If you consider them guilty of wrong doing, lodge a complaint with me and I shall see into the matter.’ The cultivated accents of the special constable put [MASK] off his stride, but he recovered in a moment.
<name>Mr. Brownlow</name>	Mr. Brownlow	Robinson	They sat quietly hiding their nervousness under an unnatural rigidity of body and expression. [MASK], to put them at ease, said: ‘This gathering is only to test the extent of your knowledge in the Christian religion. Do you understand?’
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Ummarrah	Just then a warder brought in the prisoners’ rations of a half loaf of bread and a mug of tea. [MASK] began eating his half loaf with gusto, washing it down with great gulps of hot tea. The others had no appetite. The women were crying.
<name>Amundsen</name>	Amundsen	Robinson	[MASK], suffering from a worrying skin disease and fever, was in no shape to monitor the direction especially when the sun and stars were always hidden behind a dense layer of cloud. It still took them two days to reach the last ridge beyond which lay the coastal plain with its patches of open moorland.
<name>Montmorency</name>	Montmorency	Wooreddy	He showed the scar of his bullet wound to [MASK], then talked of escape and when he would leave. Until then he would rest and enjoy himself as much as possible. His infectious mood of gaiety lifted the spirits of the good doctor, then he remembered his land and his people.
<name>Trilby</name>	Trilby	Trugernanna	A group of female num, hearing about the Aboriginal girl, descended on the Robinson household with shrill cries of delight. They saw [MASK] with her cropped hair and shapeless smock and oohed and aahed over the handsome young savage.
<name>he</name>	he	Robinson	‘It would be easy, and you must show some consideration. Didn’t I follow you half way around the world?’ ‘Not until I had sent you letter after letter of importunity,’ [MASK] muttered, distracted by the woman’s prattling.
<name>Shadow</name>	Shadow	Wooreddy	The Great Conciliator, who still had done no conciliating, welcomed them with delight. The food was quickly on the fires and while it was cooking [MASK] began to consider his position. They were well into the country of his dead wife, and sooner rather than later he would meet her people.
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Mangana	She could fill this hole in his life. After thinking overlong in his usual fashion, at last he approached her father to see if his offer still stood. [MASK] seemed to have become all grey—his hair, his beard and even his skin was grey.
<name>Samson</name>	Samson	Ummarrah	No women or children were present. Next they smeared red ochre grease over their cropped heads. What shame they felt when they compared their bald heads with [MASK]’s luxuriant locks which writhed about his face like tamed serpents!
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Robinson	the pain-racked [MASK] shouted, managing to spring to his feet. He flung his eyes into the rainy sky. He saw no smoke, but his eyes of faith did. ‘Quickly, we must go to them. Quickly, at once!
<name>Num</name>	Num	Robinson	Luckily he had tied a charmed cord around his leg for energy —but not for speed, he found, as he lagged more and more behind [MASK] as he charged towards the sea. The num came up against the steep slope of a hill and perforce had to slow his pace.
<name>Mangan</name>	Mangan	Robinson	[MASK] had planned a further surprise for them after the meal, but owing to the darkness, it would have to wait for morning. He had heard that a predecessor had taught them the rudiments of the game of cricket and that they had seemed to have liked it.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Fader	When ‘[MASK]’ had cooled down enough he tactlessly asked about ‘this letter’ and set him off again. He shouted out to the trees: ‘I’ll haddress ha circular letter to heach and hevery un o’ t’ese reprobates.
<name>Goats</name>	Goats	Death	The two men set to work and after a few hours the ground was clear enough for ceremonies. Stamping feet would soon harden the soft earth. Then for that night’s events they collected dry branches from the many dead trees. [MASK] had attacked the very plants on this island.
<name>Sookan</name>	Sookan	Maree	Then they too squeezed around the table to feel it, marvelling at the smoothness and life-likeness. The women laughed at how they had been tricked, and [MASK] began to explain how the men carved images on trees, but seeing that he did not understand her she stopped.
<name>Aborigines</name>	Aborigines	Aborigines	‘I know they will. All my work will be ruined. I must formulate some plan. Let’s go back. Hurry.’ They retraced their steps and arrived back at the camp site to find it occupied. A fire was blazing and [MASK] were roasting a kangaroo.
<name>Numa</name>	Numa	Trugernanna	They came up next to the boat, held on to the side and stretched out their free hands. [MASK] saw the num grab them by the reaching hands and haul them aboard. They screamed, but she did not see them put up much of a struggle.
<name>Truganini</name>	Truganini	Trugernanna	I trust that the Aborigines’ Committee has recommended your plan of placing them in some secure place where they may be taught. . . This female has a lively mind.’ He placed the painted board in [MASK]’s hands and began to speak to her in his atrocious Bruny.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Wooreddy	He shrugged and grinned his old grin and said: ‘Cheer up. It’s no fun living in a white man’s world. I leave it without regret.’ This only caused the women to wail hysterically. [MASK] sat on. Perhaps watching the land beginning to fragment.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Wooreddy	Seeing this, and seeing it too often, [MASK] put the idea of a foreign wife from his mind and began to look for a local girl for a mate. Or rather his father did the looking, while he suffered the pangs of lust and waited for the event to happen.
<name>Cruso</name>	Cruso	Wooreddy	They followed it up over a rise, through thick undergrowth, then around the edge of a small cove. There another sight struck them a blow. The island, [MASK]’s own earth, had been taken over by ghosts.
<name>Mr. Kipling</name>	Mr. Kipling	Ummarrah	I still don’t know how to explain him to them. They don’t like ghosts and those who bring ghosts into their country!’ ‘Never mind all that,’ [MASK] rejoined. ‘I’ll back you up — ’ and he began one of his interminable stories.
<name>Wallis</name>	Wallis	Wooreddy	One whole hut was piled high with kangaroo skins and [MASK] knew he would find few kangaroos on the island. The Great Conciliator began listing the sealers’ possessions and while he was doing this the man left to try a little hunting.
<name>the fielder</name>	the fielder	Robinson	The batter fended off the ball with his bat, but had to be reminded to run by [MASK]. On the last ball of the over, the batter received a direct hit in the middle of the chest. In retaliation he picked up the ball and hurled it back at the bowler.
<name>Italians</name>	Italians	Ghosts	and so he told them: ‘Wait a few days until I can arrange things to your advantage. [MASK] are funny, and need to be treated with caution. They have their way of doing things, just as we have our own ways.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Robinson	‘That crow ain’t so chirpy now, is he!’ Someone called out next to [MASK], who immediately bristled and declaimed to those around him: ‘That person is a human being, sir, and perhaps a better man that some of you.’
<name>dingo</name>	dingo	Wooreddy	He could even see its nose quivering in his direction. He pretended to be a rock, but it continued to look at him. A swish came from nearby. Something streaked through the air to lift the wallaby and throw it down. [MASK] ran in and brained the animal.
<name>Aboriginal</name>	Aboriginal	Dray	Alone in the very centre of the sacred circle he looked around at the rocks arranged in spirals and ovals and thought it was a child’s playing ground. He moved on and the convicts trampled across. [MASK] circled around the sacred area and met him on the far side.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Robinson	‘An’ I have to try and teach them women needlework and suchlike things,’ [MASK]’s wife continued to moan. ‘They’re all thumbs, they are, and can’t even learn to stop pricking themselves.
<name>Prince Albert</name>	Prince Albert	Robinson	I have been making, or rather, I have had fashioned an object which might show our dusky brethren that we mean them no harm and that British law applies equally to black and white.’ The Governor passed the board to [MASK]. He studied it intently.
<name>Annette</name>	Annette	Trugernanna	Women could brave the ocean and endure its cold pressure while they prised off abalone or grabbed the crayfish crawling along the very sea bottom. [MASK], young and agile, squat and strong, was a powerful swimmer who enjoyed her mastery of the watery element.
<name>Nhamo</name>	Nhamo	Robinson	The boys and girls tended to form into gangs and do everything together. But the girls had their own long bark shelter and so did the boys. [MASK] walked past the small lean-to in which an old couple lived slightly apart from the others.
<name>Ayla</name>	Ayla	Robinson	‘I can see that here you do need legs, not like sticks, but like tree trunks.’ The convicts came struggling towards them and the expedition was united once more. [MASK] stayed at the head of the slow-moving column for a time, then impatiently rushed off.
<name>Kofi</name>	Kofi	Wooreddy	[MASK] smiled as he remembered how happy his wife’s father had been to receive the strange animal as a gift. Now their village too had a panoine\ He thought all this as he strode along the road leading south. Behind him followed his wife and children.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Wooreddy	The man with the ghost was more interested in the weight and content of the woman’s bag. It bulged with oysters, and poking up from the bottom a large crayfish quivered spasmodically. ‘Good, good, Fader,’ [MASK] exclaimed to the ghost.
<name>Mr. Wopsle</name>	Mr. Wopsle	Robinson	[MASK] swung his exhortation back to the repentant sinner and the end: ‘Any other person, sir, would have had you spread-eagled on the triangle by now; but I, I turn the other cheek and well and truly forgive you.
<name>Professor</name>	Professor	Wooreddy	[MASK], after giving the num the names of a few other plants, took the opportunity to get onto his problem. ‘Lubra logemer piggerder nene,' he began in the pidgin dialect he had labelled ‘Ro-bin-un’ after its inventor.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Wooreddy	[MASK] had never seen such a dwelling place. He examined it, noting the rough slabs of tree-trunks which made up the walls and the roof of flattened bark pieces held down by a framework of poles. A strange animal trotted out and barked once or twice.
<name>Numa</name>	Numa	Wooreddy	At long last the rape ground to an end. The num without a final glance at the sprawling woman walked off to a boat [MASK] had not noticed drawn up on the beach. They got in and began rowing across the bay like a spider walking on water.
<name>Colonel Weber</name>	Colonel Weber	Wooreddy	They had not shared a common language and had had to evolve a dialect made up from all sources including English. When [MASK] had approached their camp, they had moved with a deadly precision; and even now while the two argued, they were on the alert for danger.
<name>Goosie</name>	Goosie	Wooreddy—'duck	He would never do such a thing! He thought on as he waddled along in that peculiar gait which had earned him the name, [MASK]' — and finally concluded that it was a waste of time to try to divine anything about females.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Wooreddy	[MASK] looked away from the filth and across a bare paddock to the distant inland hills. Perhaps he would go there? He took a few steps in one direction, stopped, took a few more, then stopped in confusion. He was in exactly the same spot.
<name>Friday</name>	Friday	Wooreddy	All they can do is die and good riddance too, I say. They’re the lucky ones. This island is an island of the dead and the sooner we’re all dead, the better off we’ll be.’ [MASK] could hear everything by standing just inside the kitchen door.
