<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Jodie	That’s what you were meant to do.” I wanted badly to say yes, because she was right. My job wasn’t writing books, and it certainly wasn’t killing people, no matter how much they deserved killing. And there was [MASK].
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Sadie	“Sorry, clumsy,” she says. “You always were, [MASK]. One of your more endearing traits.” Before she can ask about that, I slip my arm around her waist. She slips hers around mine, still looking up at me.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Robert	You’re not to tell her where we are, brother. You are not. We got that straight?” [MASK] didn’t say anything for a few seconds. Perhaps he was remembering a cold day in November of I960.
<name>Holly</name>	Holly	Sadie	I hung up before she could say anything else. Then I took off my shoes (getting free of the left one was a slow and painful process), lay down on the bed, and put my arm over my eyes. I saw [MASK] dancing the Madison.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Dunning	13 [MASK] went down, feet in the living room, head in the archway between the living room and the kitchen. But not all the way down. The tip of the blade dug into the floor and held him up.
<name>George</name>	George	Jake	“You’re braver than I am, [MASK].” “You’re plenty brave. Will you do this?” “The Sadie Dunhill Charity Show. My mother would shit a brick if she found out.” “All the more reason, I’d say.
<name>Promise</name>	Promise	Jake	. maybe then I could be, I don’t know, just a little bit all right.” I took her into my arms. “You’re going to be a lot better than that.” “[MASK]?” Her voice was muffled with tears.
<name>Ron</name>	Ron	Sadie	I’m full! Got em crammed in like sardines! Wait for the next one!” [MASK] threw me an agonized look, but before I could say anything, the large lady stepped in on our behalf. “Nuh-uh, you let em on.
<name>Marilyn</name>	Marilyn	Christy	I was gasping for breath, partly from effort, mostly from fright. She started to tilt toward starboard, and I slapped her bare arm—smack. “Sit up!” I shouted into her face. “Sit up, [MASK], goddammit!”
<name>Marilyn</name>	Marilyn	Sadie	Or died of lung cancer as a result of smoking. Or committed suicide, in the case of this particular someone most likely accomplished with a combination of booze and sleeping pills. [MASK] alone, with no one to slap her awake and stick her in a cold shower.
<name>Principal</name>	Principal	Ellen	“He’s going to have her cremated.” [MASK]’s lips thinned in disapproval. “Said it was what she wanted.” I thought about it. “We should have some sort of special assembly once school’s back in. Can we do that?
<name>Artie</name>	Artie	A1	From behind me—yet a little distant, as if he were standing fifteen yards away instead of only five feet—[MASK] said, “Close your eyes, buddy, it’s easier that way.” When I did it, the sensory confusion disappeared at once.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Sadie	I had no idea what they were applauding for until I felt a light, tentative hand grip my arm above the elbow. I turned to see [MASK] standing beside me in her red dress. She had put her hair up and secured it with a glittery clip.
<name>Earth</name>	Earth	Kennedy	Then the big changes started. Saving [MASK] was the biggest of all.” I tried to speak and couldn’t. “Are you beginning to understand?” Not entirely, but I could see the general outline, and it scared the living hell out of me.
<name>Arnie</name>	Arnie	A1	[MASK] grabbed another maxi pad, coughed, spat, tossed it in the wastebasket. Then he drew in the closest thing to a deep breath he could manage, and labored on. I didn’t try to stop him. I was fascinated all over again.
<name>Samara</name>	Samara	Harrah	The top one was from [MASK]’s Hotel and Casino. On the first line she had printed her name in neat block letters. Her full name, including the middle one I’d never thought to ask her about.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Jake	But would that be so bad? As an English teacher, you’d still have a marketable skill, and you wouldn’t even need it. I was there for four years, [MASK], and I made a small fortune. Do you know how?”
<name>She</name>	She	Sadie	I gripped her arm. It was very cold. It was like gripping the arm of a dead person. A woman who had been beaten to death with a sledgehammer, perhaps. [MASK] shook her head. She was looking up at the ceiling, her mouth trembling.
<name>Trudy</name>	Trudy	Christy	Now I could smell something else that I remembered well from [MASK]’s binges: the sharp aroma of vomit. I ran down the short hall on the other side of the living room. There were two doors facing each other, one giving on her bedroom and the other leading to an office-study.
<name>Dean</name>	Dean	George	“Ain’t you gonna give me hell?” “What do you mean?” “You know, [MASK].” Smiling. The kind of smile that says Yeah, I know I’m a dope, hut we both know I can’t help it.
<name>Greg</name>	Greg	Johnny	Some of her clothes still drooped sadly from their hangers; most were on the floor. All of them had been slashed. “[MASK], you bastard!” She wanted to scream those words, but the shock was too great. She could only whisper.
<name>Georgina</name>	Georgina	Sadie	But I believe in love, you know; love is a uniquely portable magic. I don’t think it’s in the stars, but I do believe that blood calls to blood and mind calls to mind and heart to heart. [MASK] dancing the Madison, color high in her cheeks, laughing.
<name>Winesburg</name>	Winesburg	Jodie	“I’m still trying. I’ve got about half of a novel written, and a couple of publishers have shown some interest. I’m looking for a quiet place to finish.” “Well, [MASK]’s quiet, all right.”
<name>Lord</name>	Lord	Honey	He put his hands on his knees so he could get down to her level. “She purty?” “Not as pretty as you, nor as big.” “Can she jump rope?" “[MASK], she can’t even walk yet.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	George	She laughed, but not the way you do when something’s funny. “Should I be glad you met someone nice?” “I don’t know, [MASK] . . . are you glad?” “No.” (I want to kill him.)
<name>Thurber</name>	Thurber	Ellen	I began to laugh. “Did anyone play the banjo?” “As a matter of fact, on a couple of occasions our current principal did.” “[MASK] played the banjo in a minstrel show?”
<name>Al</name>	Al	A1	[MASK] thought it was because he happened to be sunning himself near the rabbit-hole at 11:58 in the morning on September 9, 1958, and was susceptible to its influence. The way you can produce static on a TV screen if you run a mixer close to it.
<name>Myra</name>	Myra	Jeanne	As soon as I saw it I rejected it for the meeting I had planned. For one thing, I couldn’t be sure when [MASK] would be in the house and when she’d be away, and this particular conversation had to be strictly Two Guys.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Hosty	“I stewed about it all day Wednesday.” They were leaning forward over the table now, hanging on every word. [MASK] was making notes without looking down at his pad. I wondered if he’d be able to read them later.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	George	Give you odds and everything. Just . . .” He looked around, saw we still had the bar to ourselves, but dropped his voice to a whisper anyway. “Just don’t stiff him, [MASK]. He knows people. Strong people.”
<name>Annabelle</name>	Annabelle	Mike	She helped me when I needed help, and she made me want to learn how to do what we’re going to do for you now. We thank you all for coming out tonight and showing your Christian charity. Don’t we, [MASK]?”
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	A1	He thought he was a big deal.” [MASK] considered briefly, then shook his head. “No, I take that back. He knew he was a big deal. It was just a matter of waiting for the rest of the world to catch up on that.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Lee	Plus a little money in the bank. [MASK], though ... he had a beautiful wife and two daughters, the second one just newborn, and he could hardly keep a roof over their heads. He wasn’t a bad guy—”
<name>Abby</name>	Abby	Andy	The rules were simple. Pegs were points, and a game was two laps around the board. I learned about the right jack, double runs, being stuck in the mudhole, and what [MASK] called “mystic nineteen”—the so-called impossible hand. Then we played.
<name>Susie</name>	Susie	Bout	[MASK] screamed the house down, she did. Woke me out of a dead sleep at two in the morning. She said the man who cotched her ball had a monster in the backseat of his car, and she was afraid it would eat her up.
<name>Wemmick</name>	Wemmick	Dunning	“Take your hand out of that bag.” I knew the voice at once. Should hope to smile n kiss a pig, its owner had said when I asked if he or any of his friends knew a fel- low named [MASK].
<name>Slade</name>	Slade	Oswald	Finding [MASK], undoing his fuckery, and wiping that self-satisfied smirk off his face.” 5 When I started my car, the first thing I did was reach for the stubby Ford gearshift on the column and punch for the springy Ford clutch with my left foot.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Mike	She shook her fist at [MASK]. He grinned. The boy was leaving his face; the man was coming in. A little shyly, but coming. The singer counted off, and the brass section swung into that downbeat I still hear in my dreams.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	George	I saw it in her face. “[MASK], you need to leave.” “But he could find out,” I said. “Because your parents know, and your parents thought he was just the bees’ knees, you said so yourself.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Sadie	No chest pains, or anything like that?” He looked at me as if I were crazy. “Are we going to stand here discussing my health, or are we going to try to get [MASK] out of the trouble she’s in?”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Sadie	[MASK] laughed and tightened the elastic holding her ponytail. Color mounted high in her cheeks, making her more than pretty. She got back on her heels, clapping her hands and shaking her shoulders with the other girls, then came forward into my arms, her eyes turned up to mine.
<name>Grady</name>	Grady	Fritz	And not just any doc; your doc.” “Ask your questions,” I said. And got ready to dance. 5 [MASK] opened his briefcase and brought out a plastic bag with an evidence tag taped to it. Inside it was my .38.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Eddie	Sad, huh? It’s those worms in his head. But everybody humors him, because [MASK] was always a good guy. He could tell a joke, man, you’d laugh until you cried. Nobody even thought you were real.
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Squiggy	Not to mention in and out of bed, in and out of the shower, all the rest. And she does—[MASK] says she’s completely self-sufficient. I was impressed.” “So you decided to save her. As a test case.”
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Mimi	“Hey, [MASK],” I said, starting up the mild slope toward her, weaving my way around the card tables (borrowed from the Amvets Hall) where people would later sit to eat barbecue and watch the sunset. “Congratulations.
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	MO	Exact same [MASK]—big bet on the underdog and all the odds you can get. This time you predict the exact fucking round. So here’s what’s going to happen, my friend: you’re going to tell me how you knew.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ivy	I got s’many of these places, and people is s’hard on them. That last bunch, law.” Watch it, asshole, I thought. That’s [MASK]’s people you’re talking about. They went inside.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Lee	She had a new black eye, and there were spots of blood on the pajama shirt. She smoked slowly, inhaling deeply and staring out at nothing. After awhile she went back inside and made breakfast. Pretty soon [MASK] came out and ate it.
<name>Arlette</name>	Arlette	Ellen	Because [MASK] was a real Lucille Ball who could make anybody laugh. I snatched at the gun. It slipped through my sweat-slick fingers and landed in the grass again. My shin was howling where I’d barked it on the side of the sandbox.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Sadie	I can’t face the kids looking like I do now.” “[MASK], if you knew how many of them have come here—” “That’s sweet, it means a lot, and they’re the very ones I couldn’t face.
<name>Shug</name>	Shug	Harry	That’s between you n her. I’m warm now, so I’ll go on back. If it’s still rainy n cold like this tomorrow, I don’t know what we’re goan do about [MASK] in the back of my ma’s truck.”
<name>He</name>	He	A1	“Isn’t that your pantry?” Strictly a rhetorical question; I’d seen him bring out enough cans, sacks of potatoes, and bags of dry goods over the years to know damn well what it was. [MASK] seemed not to have heard.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Sadie	“You crazy bitch, you cut me!” He lunged for the open door of his car, which was still trying to beat itself to death. [MASK] stepped forward and slashed the air in front of his face. Her hair had fallen in her eyes.
<name>Behind</name>	Behind	Incredibly	Her hair had fallen in her eyes. Her lips were a grim line. Blood from the Studebaker cowboy’s wounded arm pattered to the pavement. Cars continued to flow past. [MASK], I heard someone yell, “Give him the business, lady!”
<name>Lee</name>	Lee	Lee	“What’s wrong?” I’d had a sudden image of the Texas School Book Depository, an ugly brick square with windows like eyes. This was the year it would become an American icon. It won’t. I’ll never let you get that far, [MASK].
<name>Dr. Smith</name>	Dr. Smith	Perry	I had sustained broken teeth, a broken nose, a broken cheekbone, a fractured left knee, a broken left arm, dislocated fingers, and abdominal injuries. I had also suffered a brain injury, which was what concerned [MASK] the most.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Biff	“I’m playing [MASK].” “Type-casting,” I said. “Just watch out for flying pies.” I saw him talking to the band’s lead singer during one of the breaks, and knew perfectly well what was coming.
<name>Hazel</name>	Hazel	Jake	“Good, [MASK]. That’s good. ” “He said he’d bring sandwiches. And milkshakes. Wants to fatten me up.” “You need fattening up.” “Plus therapy on Wednesday. Leg-torture in the morning, arm-torture in the afternoon.”
<name>Orpheus</name>	Orpheus	Chapman	All I know is that he can’t stop you if you refuse to stop. You have to get at those memories. ” “Help me, then!” I shouted, and grabbed the hard claw of his hand. “Tell me the guy’s name! Is it [MASK]?
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Jake	[MASK]? Why are you stopping?” I stopped because life is a song and the past harmonizes. Usually those harmonies meant nothing (so I thought then), but every once in awhile the intrepid visitor to the Land of Ago can put one to use.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Sadie’s	“I can give you something for the pain, if these officers don’t object.” They didn’t, but I did. The most crucial hour of my life—and [MASK]—was dead ahead. I didn’t want dope clouding my brain when it rolled around.
<name>He</name>	He	Baumer	“I’m from out of town, but I’m a friend,” I told them. “Voted the straight Democratic ticket my whole life.” I raised my hand in a so-help-me-God gesture. [MASK] grunted with amusement.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Sadie	It will help [MASK], too.” Of course it would. As a newcomer, she could use a little banked goodwill to start the year with. “Okay, I’ll talk to her. Thank you both. Are you going to be okay?”
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Deke	The Ranger seconded this, then shook our hands and said, “In your place, I would have done exactly the same thing.” “[MASK]’s pretty much kept me out of it. He wants to make sure the schoolboard doesn’t get pissy about you coming back next year.
<name>Artie</name>	Artie	A1	In the living room, the oil stove gurgled—it was another cool night. Let it go, buddy, [MASK] said. You have to. Remember, you’re not here to get— The girl, the gold watch, and everything.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Sadie	Although he cast a doubtful eye at my crutch when he said it. “I really am broke,” [MASK] said. “I wasn’t lying about that.” I pulled out my wallet and gave the man a five.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Jimla	[MASK], I thought for no reason at all, and shivered. I moved the bureau, attached the tapwire to the lamp’s plug, and fed it through the hole I’d drilled in the wall. All fine, but then I had a bad moment.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Mike	What you get tonight is a valuable piece of advice: Do not fuck up your futures. Not over a pint of Five Star at a school dance you won’t even remember a year from now. Do you understand that?” “Yessir,” [MASK] said.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Sadie	Was that same look on her face now? Or perhaps an expression a little deeper than mere caution? “[MASK]? Are we all right?” “Yes.” Sounding a little more sure now. “Sure we are. Except for Coach’s party.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Lee	If I let it. The noise of the crowd rushed in again, thousands of people applauding and cheering and yelling their brains out. I heard them and [MASK] did, too. He knew what it meant: now or never.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Al	“So,” he said. “You went and you came back. What do you think?” “[MASK], I don’t know what to think. I’m rocked right down to my foundations. You found this by accident?” “Totally.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Oswald	“That’s what you need to make sure of. Same rifle, no doubt about that, ballistics proved it. I was waiting to see him take the shot. I could afford not to interfere, because that time [MASK] missed.
<name>Coach</name>	Coach	Jim	After that the cheerleaders would do a few more cartwheels and then run off the field so the other team’s band could march out and tootle a tune or two. But this year, possibly in honor of [MASK]’s valedictory season, the chant had changed.
<name>Adrian</name>	Adrian	George	When he’s not compulsively washing his hands, or alphabetizing his books, or talking about how disgusting it is to get an erection, he’s very, very charming. He certainly charmed you." “Please go away, [MASK].” Her voice was trembling.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Deke	“Exactly.” “I see.” She picked at her piece of deep-fried fish. [MASK] was looking at her with a mildly poleaxed expression. Whatever it was he wanted as he went cantering down the backstretch of life, she appeared to have it.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Hosty	“And if we were plotting an assassination, you must have seen me with him. Because I know you had him under at least partial surveillance.” I leaned forward. “Why didn’t you stop him, [MASK]? That was your job.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sadie	Here’s home: the smell of the sage and the way the hills flush orange with Indian blanket in the summer. The faint taste of tobacco on [MASK]’s tongue and the squeak of the oiled wood floorboards in my homeroom.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Ellie	We never know which lives we influence, or when, or why. Not until the future eats the present, anyway. We know when it’s too late. “I don’t remember,” I said. [MASK] trotted off to pay the check.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Lee	She had changed the offending skirt for slacks and what appeared to be two sweaters—the day had turned cold. She hurried down the street, several times looking back over her shoulder for [MASK]. When I was sure he wasn’t going to follow her, I did.
<name>Thor</name>	Thor	Harry	I ran through the arch and stopped there with my mouth open. Based on [MASK]’s theme, I had always assumed that I’d have to stop a man swinging the sort of hammer guys kept in their toolboxes. That wasn’t what he had.
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Christy	[MASK] said she supposed she could forgive me not crying at her father’s funeral; I had only known him for six years and couldn’t understand what a wonderful, giving man he had been (a Mustang convertible as a high school graduation present, for instance).
<name>Mac</name>	Mac	Mimi	Huggies forMiz [MASK]!” I hugged her, then released her quickly when I heard her gasp. “What the hell is wrong with you, ma’am?” She went back to the couch, picked up her iced coffee, and sipped.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Carmo	I said. “No, please don’t do that!” [MASK] smiled as if I’d said something cute, plucked the felt-wrapped pipe from the table, and swung it at my left knee. I heard something down there make a popping sound.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Sadie	Then there was the light thud of footsteps as [MASK] followed me. I crutched on the right—no longer leaning on it but almost vaulting on it—and hauled at the railing on the left. The gun in my sport coat pocket swung and thudded against my hip.
<name>Hemingway</name>	Hemingway	Christy	It was when I got to the part about him crawling under the bed with the blood running in his eyes {it also run down my throat and tasted horible) that I began to cry—[MASK] would have been so proud.
<name>Rocco</name>	Rocco	Carmo	[MASK] swung the pipe at my midsection. It struck me below the ribs with paralyzing force. There was pain, first jagged, then swallowed in a growing explosion of heat, like a fireball. “Hurts, don’t it?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Coach	“Do you know?” “I know, all right,” [MASK] said, “and if he thinks I’m gonna let him use it during a game broadcast, he’s out of his sneaker.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	A1	I was quiet, thinking. The clock on the wall said ten-thirty. [MASK] had opened the conversation by saying he’d be good to go until midnight, but I only had to look at him to know that had been wildly optimistic.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Frati	“I don’t feel so good. Maybe you’re right about that bug.” If he thought he might be getting sick enough to be incapaci- tated, he might do something rash. “Never mind the bug just now. Tell me about [MASK].”
<name>Yuri</name>	Yuri	Johnny	‘Next they’ll send a dog or a monkey,’ [MASK] said. ‘After that they’ll send a man. Then they’ll send two men and a bomb.’” “And did they do that?
<name>Gaslight</name>	Gaslight	Realism	The last thing I wanted was someone stealing a bug-loaded lamp from a semi-furnished apartment. For a moment he looked puzzled, then a complicitous smile dawned on his face. “I get it. [MASK].”
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Clayton	Her voice dropped. “He just missed my eye—” Then [MASK] was back. “See? Your little tramp is fine. Now you just jump in your hotrod Chevrolet and get out here just as fast as the wheels will roll, how would that be?
<name>He</name>	He	A1	There’s a time tunnel there. I know it’s hard to believe, but let me show you.’” For a moment I actually considered this, because [MASK] was probably right: the fissure leading into the past was almost certainly delicate.
<name>Helena</name>	Helena	A1	“Then how can I still have this picture of her graduating in a wheelchair?” “Because every trip down the rabbit-hole’s a reset.” Then [MASK] just looked at me, to see if I got it. After a minute, I did.
<name>Abraham</name>	Abraham	Noah	In addition to prayer lists, he probably believed all that shit about [MASK]’s sons. “No thanks necessary,” I said. “Just doing my job.” He looked at me keenly. “You ought to still be doing it, not jerking off over some book.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Roth	Did you know he burned down your house?” I said nothing. “Then,” [MASK] said, “when those little wormies really started to bite his brain, he started to think you were some kind of ghoul, or devil.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Amberson	“So do you want the place, [MASK]?” “I guess so,” I said, and sighed. He took a long rent-book with a floppy leather cover out of his back pocket. “First month, last month, damage deposit.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Christy	The sink was stacked with dishes. There was a gravy boat on the counter; beside it, a platter of cold noodles. From the TV came a trembling violin soundtrack—what [MASK] used to call “murder music.” Very fitting.
<name>Baptist</name>	Baptist	Methodist	He squinted suspiciously. “What are you, [MASK]?” “Yes,” I said. It seemed a lot safer than saying I was, denominationally speaking, nothing. “You need to get in the Baptist way of churching, son. Ours welcomes newcomers.
<name>David</name>	David	Oswald	At last he said, very softly, “It’s big, isn’t it?” “It is,” I said. “And A1 . . . man . . . I’m just a little guy.” “You could say the same of [MASK].
