<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Meridian	“No,” said the husband, “I don’t have time for foolishness. My wife is dying. My boy don’t have shoes. Go somewhere else and find somebody that ain’t got to work all the time for pennies, like I do.” “Okay,” said [MASK].
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Meridian	“You are a coward,” one of the girls said then, though they knew she was not a coward. “A masochist,” sniffed another. And [MASK] had sat among them on the floor, her hands clasping the insides of her sneakers, her head down.
<name>it</name>	it	Saxon	But no matter how hard she labored she was always willing to tackle more, because she knew almost no one there, and because [MASK] was a peaceful but strange, still, place to her, and because she was grateful to be distracted.
<name>Janine</name>	Janine	Meridian	“Unless,” he said, and grinned at her, “unless he’s a sugar daddy.” He burst out laughing at the thought “Does he ever,” he asked, his eyes twinkling, “hobble you around his desk?” [MASK] put the remainder of the Cokes into the refrigerator.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Meridian	[MASK], the former wife and mother, already felt herself to be flying under false colors as an “innocent” Saxon student. The scenes she personally witnessed in the Atlanta streets, combined with this, caused the majority of her waking moments to seem fragmented, surreal.
<name>Queenie</name>	Queenie	Louvinie	[MASK] was tall, thin, strong and not very pleasant to look at. She had a chin that stuck out farther than it should and she wore black headrags that made a shelf over her eyebrows. She became something of a local phenomenon in plantation society because it was believed she could not smile.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Truman	She seemed relaxed and happy. He thought of her life with [MASK]—how they could never ride on the same seat of their car, but must always sit as if one of them were chauffeuring the other And there was no entertainment for them at night.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Trilling	As they stepped from the church and into the light from an overhanging bulb on the porch, a burst of machine-gun fire came from some bushes across the street. He and [MASK] jumped off the sides of the steps.
<name>knocked</name>	knocked	Lynne	Anyhow, we walked up and [MASK] put one foot up on the lady’s step. Her stomach was growling and she held her canvassing pad in front of it The lady looked at her foot for a full minute. “ ‘How /all durin’?’
<name>Cheryl</name>	Cheryl	Lynne	He tightened his grip. “Tell us, bitch, what did you do when it started getting good to you?” “It was never good,” said [MASK]. Then, “I kissed your arm.” “My stub,” he corrected her.
<name>Du Bois</name>	Du Bois	Truman	“Maybe tomorrow night,” he said, stifling a yawn. But she did not see [MASK] again, alone (except for one heart-breaking time), for several months, not until he had read The Souls of Black Folk, in fact.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Truman	Soon as—[MASK] says soon as he sells some more of his paintings we’re goin’ to be married. I don’t need to tell you how I expect my folks to take it_” A gleam of conspiracy had the nerve to be observed in her eye.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Meridian	He was a very old man who had, years ago, known her mother’s family. It was her mother who encouraged her to take the job, reminding her that her father could not afford to send [MASK] the two or three dollars a week she had asked him to send.
<name>Zenobia</name>	Zenobia	Meridian	And as she annoyed him with her irrepressible questions that kept bursting out and bubbling up into their fives, like spring water rising beside a reservoir and undermining the concrete of the dam, he had thought of [MASK], whom he imagined as more calm, predictable.
<name>Mrs. Jones</name>	Mrs. Jones	Truman	“I’m sorry,” said [MASK], quickly moving. “I’m feelin’ a little better today,” said the woman, “a little better.” Her small black face was childlike, all bony points and big brown eyes that never left her husband’s back.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Camara	She heard the crunch and crackle of a bag of fried plantains being crushed in her pocket. Her other pocket contained a small rubber ball, some string, a sliver of cheese [MASK] had slipped in when she wasn’t looking.
<name>Marge</name>	Marge	Delores	“You have a right to go to college,” said [MASK]. “You’re lucky to have the chance.” She was slender and brown, with a strong, big nose and eyebrows like black wings. She wore jeans and flowered shirts and was unafraid of everything.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Meridian	How’d they do that?” [MASK] shrugged. “They’re used to carrying corpses.” “Ever since I’ve been here people have been bringing boxes and boxes of food. Your house is packed with stuff to eat. One man even brought a cow.
<name>Rose</name>	Rose	Meridian	[MASK] had always enjoyed being on the farm with him, though they rarely talked. Her brothers were not interested in farming, had no feeling for the land or for Indians or for crops. They ate the fresh produce their father provided while talking of cars and engines and tires and cut-rate hubcaps.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Lynne	But while this building of trust and mutual liking was coming into being, the Movement itself was changing. [MASK] was no longer welcome at any of the meetings. She was excluded from the marches. She was no longer allowed to write articles for the paper.
<name>Tayo</name>	Tayo	Swinbum	The one called [MASK] was busy pecking out something on the typewriter in front of him, his thin back bent over, his ribs showing beneath his faded shirt He was very dark brown, with full, neatly curved lips and large eyes behind wireless glasses that further magnified them.
<name>Ignatius</name>	Ignatius	Meridian	And in their harried or passive but always overweight and hideously dressed figures she began to suspect a mysterious inner life, secret from her, that made them willing, even happy, to endure. The man she married, [MASK]’s father, was also a schoolteacher.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Meridian	He was short and stout with puffy brown eyes behind his glasses. His smile was warm and welcoming, and when he preceded [MASK] into the room she noticed he dipped and bobbed ever so slightly like a man pulling a dog on a leash.
<name>Trudy</name>	Trudy	Meridian	“Black folks aren’t so special,” she said. “I hate to admit it But they’re not.” “Maybe,” said [MASK], as if she had been wide awake all along, “the time for being special has passed.
<name>Zora</name>	Zora	Truman	“I seen rights come and I seen ’em go,” said the sweeper sullenly, as if daring [MASK] to disagree. “You’re a stranger here or you’d know this is for the folks that work in that guano plant outside town. Po’ folks.”
<name>him</name>	him	Meridian	He was moving out, pulling the door closed behind him. “Shit,” she said, stepping back. “Why don’t you just tell [MASK] it’s me. We don’t have any secrets, do we?”
<name>Donald</name>	Donald	Burn’em	She looked at him until his hard face began to blur. “[MASK] out by the roots for all I care.” She had left his office wide-legged with blood soaking her super Kotex and cramps bending her double, but she was crying for other reasons.
<name>the wife</name>	the wife	Truman	Surprised, [MASK] followed as she calmly walked away. “What’s this here?” asked the husband ten minutes later as they came through his front door with two bags of food. “To go with the venison.”
<name>her</name>	her	hen	That made one think of the guillotine. That made one suspect she was unbalanced. When he noticed it he felt a shrinking, a retreating of his balls: He wanted her still, but would not have wanted (or been able) to make love to [MASK]
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Meridian	She had seen her around the campus before, but never really to speak to. [MASK] appeared so aloof she could sit at a table for four in the dining room and never be asked to share it; or, if she were asked, the question would be put timidly, with deference.
<name>Mr. McArdle</name>	Mr. McArdle	Truman	[MASK] laughed. “No, no, I mean it. He was in love with a dog. He bought the best of everything for the dog to eat. He brushed its coat a dozen times a day. He talked to it constantly, ignoring his children and his wife.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Meridian	[MASK] felt as if her body, growing frailer every day under the stress of her daily life, stood in the way of a recon- ciliation between her mother and that part of her own soul her mother could, perhaps, love.
<name>George</name>	George	Meridian	We’re as innocent as brother and sister.” [MASK] stopped. Perhaps that was not as innocent as it might sound. “There’s nothing between us.” “I know there’s nothing between you.”
<name>Tom Robinson</name>	Tom Robinson	Lynne	Of course black people for years were “guilty” of being black Slavery was punishment for their “crime.” But even if he abandoned this search for [MASK]’s guilt, because it ended, logically enough, in racism, he was forced to search through other levels for it.
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Meridian	Hers was an exploitative rather than an altruistic nature, and she would never have attempted penetrating [MASK]’s reserve if she had not sensed behind it an intriguing and valuable inner life—an exploration of which would enrich her own existence.
<name>Resurrection</name>	Resurrection	Trinity	Or, “Not on Time, but Current,” said the prostitutes to the old grandpas, letting the old men dig on their cleavage. Or, “Notice of [MASK], with Christ,” the pool sharks said to the religious fanatics, who frowned, otherwise, on pool sharks.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Meridian	Not like me, at least I try for the classier bums—like the old poets and jazz stars of yesteryear. Like—” “Don’t give me any names,” said [MASK]. “Believe me when I say I don’t want to know.”
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Truman	She had been walking down the street from her job at the old professor’s and—walking with her head down—had not seen [MASK] coming toward her. They almost passed each other before he stopped and turned, his brown eyes very dark and hot against the green polo shirt he wore.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Lynne	I’ve been thinking and thinking, lying here. And what I’ve thought is: Don’t nobody offer me marching and preaching as a substitute for going after those jokers’ balls.” Was it because she was a white woman that [MASK] was guilty?
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Meridian	“She’s already sweet like an angel,” said [MASK] impulsively, rubbing his hair and picking away the lint, “like you.” “What good is the vote, if we don’t own nothing?”
<name>David</name>	David	Rims	She grieved over her life and moaned from the pain coming into her wounded leg. She had been a virgin until [MASK] came into her life, filling it with fluttery anticipation and making her body so changed, so full of hurting brightness she had known it was a sin for which she would be punished.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Truman	Besides,” she said, “I don’t trust revolutionaries enough to let them choose who should be killed. I would probably end up on the wrong side of the firing squad, myself.” “No one would ask killing of you,” said [MASK].
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Meridian	he asked. “They didn’t touch me,” she said. “You’re just sick then?” “Of course I’m sick,” snapped [MASK]. “Why else would I spend all this time trying to get well!”
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Meridian	“Some way or other we’ll get enough copies made.” [MASK] typed and typed, until her back seemed to be cracking and her eyes smarted. Her typing was horrible, and she felt ashamed of the amount of paper she was using.
<name>Holly</name>	Holly	Lynne	“Shut up\” “You Southern girls lead such sheltered lives,” [MASK] said, affecting a Southern belle accent and twirling a lock of her unwashed, rather oily hair around her finger, “I declare I’d be just bored to death.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Eddie	Rebelling, she began to dream each night, just before her baby sent out his cries, of ways to murder him. She sat in the rocker [MASK] had bought and stroked her son’s back, her fingers eager to scratch him out of her life.
<name>he</name>	he	Eddie	Even the girls (and she noticed especially a white girl with long brown hair) were dressed in overalls with bibs! It was something to think about, the day [MASK] moved out for good. She could not, somehow, concentrate on the fact of his leaving.
<name>the baby</name>	the baby	Daxter	When her parents found she was pregnant by the black man who worked for them, they shut her up in the cellar and threw away the key. They fed her pig bran and a little watery milk When [MASK] was bom he was thrown out into the street with the rest of the trash.
<name>ancestors</name>	ancestors	Indians	“But the land already belonged to them,” her father said, “I was just holding it The rows of my cabbages and tomatoes run right up along the biggest coil of the Sacred Serpent. That mound is full of dead [MASK].
<name>Patrick Bateman</name>	Patrick Bateman	Meridian	Mightily, and at length. “Oh no,” [MASK] said pleasantly. “You wanted a virgin, don’t you remember?” (He could remember nothing of the kind.) “You wanted a woman who was not ‘sexually promiscuous.’”
<name>the artist</name>	the artist	Truman	She had loved the figures at first—especially the paintings of women in the South—the sculptures, enduring and triumphant in spite of everything. But when [MASK] changed, she had, too. Until she did not want to look at the women, although many of them she knew, and loved.
<name>her</name>	her	hen	It was restful and beautiful and inspired the reverence the sermons had failed to rouse. Thinking of the glass now she raised her head to look at the large stained-glass window across from [MASK] Instead of the traditional pale Christ with stray lamb there was a tall, broad-shouldered black man.
<name>Janine</name>	Janine	Meridian	Just don’t take all night Sometimes I’d go to sleep with ’em still at it” “Must you say nigger?” [MASK] asked wearily. She realized that among many hip people the use of the word was not considered offensive but rather a matter of style.
<name>the man</name>	the man	Swinburn	He was speeding up his pecking, now that he knew she was looking at him, but the number of errors he made soon caused him to jump up and offer his chair to hen “Don’t you want to know my name?” “Oh,” rumbled [MASK], “I’m sorry.
<name>her</name>	her	Lynne	That harsh buzz, followed by the continuation of her mother’s, by then, howl, rested in the back of [MASK]’s brain like a spinning record on which the sound was turned down. It would never leave her, even when she was most happy.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Meridian	With it she bought not only her own freedom, but that of her husband and children as well. In [MASK]’s grandmother’s childhood, there were still barns scattered throughout the state that bloomed with figures her mother had painted.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Meridian	Away from her mother, [MASK] thought of her as Black Motherhood personified, and of that great institution she was in terrible awe, comprehending as she did the horror, the narrowing of perspective, for mother and for child, it had invariably meant.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Meridian	The next morning [MASK] ate all her breakfast, though it would not all stay down. For the first time she asked for a mirror and tried to sit up in bed. Soon, her strength exhausted, she slept.
<name>Mr. Jaynes</name>	Mr. Jaynes	Daxter	She would visit the funeral home on Saturday afternoons, as everybody did to see who was new in the viewing room. [MASK] would entice her into the small back office where he kept a long sofa and two soft chairs.
<name>her</name>	her	Lynne	They’ve been here a week, and I’ve already been out canvassing voters with [MASK]. I like hen She can’t say ‘saw,’ she says, ‘I sarh it’ And she starts her sentences with ‘So.’
<name>he</name>	he	Eddie	She might approach it, might gaze on it with longing, but retreat was inevitable. Besides, [MASK] did not seriously expect more than “interest” from her She perceived there might be something more; but for him, it was enough that his pleasure should please her.
<name>Atlanta</name>	Atlanta	Saxon	They had long ago dubbed The Sojourner “The Music Tree,” and would not stand to have it cut down, not even for a spanking new music building that a Northern philanthropist—unmindful that his buildings had already eaten up most of [MASK]’s precious greenness—was eager to give.
<name>Veronica</name>	Veronica	Lynne	“What do you want, [MASK]?” “Really,” she said, still smiling a silly too-bright smile, “I thought I would have a chance to come in and tell you in style, if not exactly in comfort I’m thirsty, got any sodas?”
<name>Offred</name>	Offred	Signing	The grate of the key, the lock, the creaking door opening inward, sucking in the light into the gloom. [MASK] in. Hearing the harsh music of women’s voices, women confined to sit and buzz like insects, whine, wait in line.
<name>Lolita</name>	Lolita	Meridian	When [MASK] left the house in the evening with her “boyfriend”—her current eager, hot-breathing lover, who always drove straight to the nearest lovers’ lane or its equivalent, which in her case was the clump of bushes behind the city dump—her mother only cautioned her to “be sweet”
<name>Ray-Ray</name>	Ray-Ray	Lynne	He lay looking at a spot slightly above the television, which was high in one corner of the room. “[MASK] says hurry up and get your ass out of here,” he continued. “When you get out of here we gon’ party for days.”
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Truman	“What does he do with the newspapers?” asked [MASK]. “Did you see how many he has?” asked the woman. “You should see the room behind this one. Rolled newspapers up to the ceiling. Half the kitchen is rolled newspapers.”
<name>the rest</name>	the rest	Meridian	They acquiesced, they rebelled, they sold out, they shot it out, or they simply drifted with the current of the time, whatever it was. And they didn’t endanger life and limb agonizing over what they would lose, which was what separated them from [MASK].
<name>Bigger</name>	Bigger	Meridian	“Yep,” said [MASK]. “I can’t go back home. I don’t even have a home. I wouldn’t go back if I could. I know white folks are evil and fucked up, I know they’re doomed.
<name>she</name>	she	Meridian	To him, they were practically imaginary. It was still amazing to him how deeply [MASK] allowed an idea—no matter where it came from—to penetrate her life. “I hate to think of you always alone.”
<name>Peter</name>	Peter	Eddie	But the longer they lived together the more she became obsessed with the horrible thought that [MASK], like his name, would never be grown up. She thought he would always be a boy. Not that she knew what a man should be; she did not know.
<name>Elie</name>	Elie	Meridian	It was like a play. This startled [MASK]; and the preacher’s voice—not his own voice at all, but rather the voice of millions who could no longer speak— wound on and on along its now heated, now cool, track.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Meridian	“Promise me you won’t laugh at me-” He hesitated. “I want you to love me.” “But I do love you,” said [MASK]. “You pity me. I want your love the way I had it a long time ago.
<name>Sylvia</name>	Sylvia	Truman	From being a teacher who published small broadsides of poems, she had hired herself out as a gardener, as a waitress at middle-class black parties, and had occasionally worked as a dishwasher and cook “And now you’re here,” said [MASK], indicating the bareness of the room.
<name>her</name>	her	hen	Day followed day, and the calm level of her pleasures as a single woman remained constant. Certainly she never reached euphoria. And she wanted euphoria to add to the other good feelings she had. Of course as a teacher she earned both money and respect This mattered to [MASK]
<name>Mr. Miyagi</name>	Mr. Miyagi	Meridian	“I don’t know,” said [MASK]. “It may be useless. Or maybe it can be the beginning of the use of your voice. You have to get used to using your voice, you know. You start on simple things and move on...
<name>Rowena</name>	Rowena	Truman	“Mflis oui,” [MASK] kept saying, as she looked shyly but happily up at him, “you will be just the Saxon type!” But then, she had never told him she had a child.
<name>Maya</name>	Maya	Meridian	Later, when she was in her teens, she also learned to scurry out of the way of white men—because she was good-looking, defenseless and black. Her life, she told [MASK], was one of scurrying, and only one thing kept her going: her determination to be a schoolteacher
<name>father</name>	father	Tata	“The heartless bastard, the least he could have done was prepare me for the creep he turned out to be. Fathers suck,” she added, frowning. “When my old [MASK] is dead, then I’ll remember his kindness.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Truman	She turned a bright, tight face to [MASK]. “Tell her about this thing you have, darlin’ (and of course he’s not the only one), for young white virgins. And don’t lie and say I wasn’t one.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Meridian	[MASK] attempted to ignore her, but her mother would continue. “If somebody thinks he’ll have to pee when he gets to town, let him use his own toilet before he leaves home! That’s what we did when I was coming up!”
<name>Adolf</name>	Adolf	Rundi	"I’ll ask them to call you [MASK], after no person, I hope, who has ever lived.” When she gave him away she did so with a light heart. She did not look back, believing she had saved a small person’s life.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Meridian	The taste of the cheese brought her back, though she kept her head against the back of her chair, her eyes closed. She sat up, opened her eyes, looked at [MASK] who had fallen asleep, and sprang to her feet, yawning loudly.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Lynne	[MASK] She remembered it was spring, and she had left her parents’ house, she hoped, for good. And if this hope was not to become reality she did not intend to struggle over it or care.
<name>Mercy</name>	Mercy	Lynne	He thought of hanging her from a tree by her long hair and letting her weight gradually pull the hair from her scalp. He wondered if that would eventually happen to a person hung up in that way. But [MASK] grew on him, as she did on everyone.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Eddie	[MASK] was a good boy, it was argued, it was agreed—in her family’s estimation. And he was, by several of the prevailing standards: He was always clean—he bathed, in summer, two or three times a week.
<name>Beatrice</name>	Beatrice	Truman	“Besides, revolution would not begin, do you think, with an act of murder—wars might begin in that way—but with teaching.” “Oh yes, teaching,” said [MASK], scornfully.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Truman	To [MASK] the discussion was academic, so he could state his points neatly. “By the way,” he now said, “do you think you could kill anyone, lined up before you like so much diphtheria or smallpox? Or cancer?”
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Meridian	So she said, “Let’s \ go,” abruptly, pushing him reluctantly but firmly from her, and preceded him out the door. Driving through town [MASK] told him of the three white exchange students who had come on the march with them that afternoon.
<name>She</name>	She	Meridian	But [MASK] wanted the destruction of the rich as a class and the eradication of all personal economic preserves. Her senior thesis was based on the notion that no one should be allowed to own more land than could be worked in a day, by hand.
<name>Mr. Ellsworth Toohey</name>	Mr. Ellsworth Toohey	Truman	[MASK] laughed. “My little kitten has sharp claws. Still,” he said, “it pays to have a little tolerance with other people’s curiosity. It never bothers me any more when foreigners look at my hair and say, ‘A leetle beet of zee tar brush, eh?’”
<name>Meggy</name>	Meggy	Meridian	Freedom songs, several old women testifying (mainly about conditions inside the black section of the jail, which caused [MASK]’s body to twitch with dread) and finally, a plan of what their strategy was to be, and the singing of “Ain’t Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me Round.”
<name>John</name>	John	Truman	When he talked to her she had to translate every syllable into English before answering. Their conversation moved slowly. But it didn’t matter. She loved being with [MASK]. She felt protected when she was with him. To her he was courageous and “new.”
<name>my brother</name>	my brother	Camara	He never spoke more than a dozen words to me in anger, all the time I was growing up. Always so gentle, so fair. I couldn’t believe it when I called to tell them [MASK] had been attacked and died. You know what he said?
<name>her</name>	her	Lynne	She steadied the rocker, listened. “Besides,” he continued, “I don’t owe [MASK] the way I do you. You notice I don’t lie and say I don’t love her at all. She’s meant a great deal to me.
<name>Alexander</name>	Alexander	Terence	Wonder, come to think of it, how they passed their time when not drafting the Constitution? Did they dance? “[MASK],” she called, clutching his shoulder as he plodded by, “I’m so glad you’ve come back.
<name>He</name>	He	Truman	“They know how fascinating it makes them.” She looked out the car window and realized they had stopped a few houses down from where the party was. [MASK] reached for her and gathered her tightly into his arms. She felt his tongue licking the au de cologne off her earlobes.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Margaret	And all’s fair that fucks with the sucker’s minds!” Then he had begun to see them together. Not in public, but with small groups of men, in the back rooms of bars. [MASK] could play poker and he liked to see her when she won.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Truman	She laughed, for no reason that her visitors could fathom. It was a soft, intimate chuckle, weak but as if she wanted them to understand she could endure whatever was wrong. “Where did he get deer this time of year?” asked [MASK].
<name>Bub</name>	Bub	Johnny	asked [MASK], getting up from his chore with the newspapers and coming to stand at the foot of the bed. “You hongry again?” “I gets full just lookin’ at you, sugah,” said the sick woman coquettishly.
