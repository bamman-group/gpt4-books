<name>Florimond</name>	Florimond	Marywell	It was pleasant, no doubt exciting, to meet a manifestation like that of [MASK]. They had all, himself included, been carried away with it. But on sober reflection, why all this outcry about a single blossom, when the very flower of heaven bloomed here in the church, before their eyes?
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Thomas	The doctor was always bringing home some disorder: measles one month, chicken-pox the next. Now [MASK], aged six, was the victim. His poll shorn and smelling of carbolic, he was happily disseminating ringworm through the tribe.
<name>Chauvelin</name>	Chauvelin	Alex	She felt weak with anger that this sottish fool should have filled [MASK] up with drink on top of the dreadful hurt he had sustained. She saw that he had lost a great quantity of blood . . . she had nothing here to treat him with . . .
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Francis	The snow which had held off for a week suddenly began again. It fell and fell unendingly. [MASK] had never seen such snow, the flakes so large and soft. Each added snowflake made an added silence. Houses were walled up in the silent whiteness.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Francis	He’s not so bright, but he’s steady. In a couple of years you’ll see her at mass with her husband and family . . . perfectly happy.” “No, no.” The interruption was wrenched from [MASK]’ shut lips.
<name>Yevgeny</name>	Yevgeny	Andrew	I can’t and I won’t be so impersonal . . . it’s my inveterate crankiness, I suppose, which makes me fight against officialdom. Well ... if that is so ... I . . . and [MASK] . .
<name>MacIan</name>	MacIan	Joshua	[MASK] made a gesture towards the road ahead. “And there are others.” The priest swung round stiffly. About twenty of the grey-green figures were approaching down the path kicking up a cloud of slow white dust.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Francis	Then he returned, sat down and slowly began his lunch. His appetite was scarcely that of a man with a purified liver. He kept darting glances at [MASK] out of his small, lowering eyes. His silence blasted the room.
<name>Malachi</name>	Malachi	Rusty	The fly fell exactly on the spume eddying beneath the far edge of the weir. The next instant I felt the fish, struck, and was fast in it. “‘Ye have one!’ [MASK] cried. Then the salmon jumped — four feet in the air.
<name>Ramona</name>	Ramona	Joshua	You shall have the roan pony when we return to the mission.” “Does the Master think we shall ever return to the mission?” “If not, [MASK], the good God will give you a finer pony to ride in heaven.” Another pause.
<name>Gringoire</name>	Gringoire	Shon	which will certainly please you.” [MASK] exhibited the sack, moving nearer, a trifle nearer, to the gun. “It is not so great a load.” The captain of the gun crew stepped into the light. “Have you brought money also?”
<name>Mara</name>	Mara	Anna	I’m rather glad.” No one said anything. She began to stroke his hot forehead with her bleached sodden fingers. She was still stroking when [MASK] came to the cave. This time, however, the woman brought no food with her.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Francis	With a deep, excited breath, [MASK] approached the small, ramshackle house and pulled the bell. After some delay, when he was about to ring again, the door was opened by a stout woman in a blue striped apron. Inspecting him, she nodded.
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Francis	In other moods she was timid and uncertain. She could not bear to admit a fault and would wander glibly from the truth to hide it. The hint that she was lying brought floods of indignant tears. With this before him [MASK] made every effort to win her confidence.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Francis	Rocking slightly on his feet, he raised his finger and levelled it at [MASK]. “Statistics’ll show another thing. And that is there’s no club within five miles of this spot I’m standing on. Your fine plan is finished, smashed, done for.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Francis	“No!” “Then tell us in your own words how you came to — to take your remarkable adventure.” At the quiet encouragement, [MASK] raised his head. He made a great effort, his eyes remote, his face troubled. “I ...
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Francis	Once or twice he glanced sideways at [MASK], then immediately he glanced away again. It was impossible to guess his thoughts, but in the depths of his eyes there lurked a dark glimmer of fear and suspicion. “Don’t be afraid.”
<name>Henrietta</name>	Henrietta	Clotilde	Then she gave an outraged cry. “What monsters! Oh my God, it is insupportable!” She beckoned urgently, not lifting her head, to [MASK], who had come quickly into the room, drawn by the same magnetic force.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Martha	That same day, indeed, [MASK] scurried in early to the Sisters’ house from the dispensary, with her new eagerness, then gave a cluck of nervous satisfaction. They had come — what she looked forward to with all her soul: the newspapers.
<name>Millicent</name>	Millicent	Polly	Only, I’m not quite sure of where it is.” “Someone’ll show you the way.” [MASK] composedly produced her main surprise. “Someone who’s coming home from her school to spend a long week-end with us.”
<name>Yumeko</name>	Yumeko	Joseph	“Master, I have waited for you to ask me. My father is willing. I will serve you with all my heart.” “There may be many rough roads, [MASK].” “We shall travel them together, Master.”
<name>John</name>	John	Tulloch	[MASK]’s saturnine face wore a queer expression as he straightened himself. His fund of humour had surprisingly dried up. He darted a look at his wife, bit his full lip, and suddenly kicked the cat. “Damn it to hell!” he cried.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Francis	— with sudden heat: “You must admit it was such damned ingratitude after all!” During the next few days [MASK] rigorously shunned the merchant’s quarter of the city. More than his pride had been hurt.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Francis	“It’s a lie, a wicked lie. He’s as fat and well fed as my own son!” There was an interruption. [MASK], flat against the door, following the scene in an agony of suspense, leaned too heavily against the ricketty catch.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Francis	It was a dire week for [MASK]. His left side hurt him, especially when he coughed; he had to drag himself to work. He was aware, dimly, that his grandfather fought a battle for him.
<name>Gregor</name>	Gregor	Francis	Without hesitation [MASK] unlocked the gate and went outside. “What do you wish of me?” The officer was short, thickset and middle-aged, with a heavy face and thick mulish lips. He breathed through his mouth, which hung open, showing his stained upper teeth.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Mary	“As she was returning from her walk, murmuring a prayer, she chanced to pass the place which we know as [MASK]’s Well. It was twilight, the last rays of the sun lingering in pure radiance upon the lovely scene.
<name>Latimer</name>	Latimer	Francis	It was the Rector, meeting [MASK] at the end of the week, who put his finger on the manifest inconsistency. “It strikes me, young sir, that you have escaped gey lightly, through a sinister screen of sanctity.
<name>Thring</name>	Thring	Anselm	Whenever a new society was proposed, [MASK]’s advice was sure to be invoked — automatically he became its president. In praise of the clerical life he was lyrical. His only cross was this singular paradox: the Headmaster and a few odd lonely souls cordially disliked him.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Anselm	He went out a good deal and, though no one could call him a snob, took tea at all the best houses. Whenever an eminent cleric came to preach in the city, [MASK] was sure to meet him and to sit admiringly at his feet.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Nora	His heart was breaking, he dared not meet her eye. “Yes, I know.” There was a suffocating pause. He could not sustain the torture in his breast. Incoherently he burst out, boyish tears starting in his eyes: “[MASK] . . .
<name>Mariette</name>	Mariette	Anna	“[MASK] is throwing food over the upper wall.” She wailed out the complaint. “I am sure her soldier is there . . . they were talking together.” His own nerves were near to breaking point. “There is no harm in giving food to those who need it.”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Andrew	Presently, with a hurried glance, out of his downcast muteness, [MASK] begged permission to depart. Rising to say his grace, he knocked a spoon spinning with his elbow. His stiff boots made an uncouth scuffling towards the door. Another pause.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Shon	“This evening under threat of shelling the mission, the Wai officer who commands the gun crew ordered me to bring food and money to him before midnight . . .” He went on, gazing at [MASK], then abruptly broke off, conscious that he need say no more.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Tulloch	[MASK]’s face did not change, he trudged along, fists in his deep coat pockets, collar up, head down. “Yes,” he said at last. “A little bird told me.” “What do you think of it?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Nora	Returning from the station at four o’clock, sombrely leaping the puddles to which [MASK], his half-cousin, gaily dared him, — his mother walking with Aunt Polly, who came, dressed up and sedate, behind, — he felt the day oppressive with disaster.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Francis	He picked one up. “She’s stolen from the collection money. It’s worse than thievery. It’s simony. Look at this.” [MASK] examined the packet. It had been opened and clumsily retwisted at the top. Three of the pennies were missing.
<name>I'm</name>	I'm	Pm	She stared with growing dismay at his working clothes, dirty hands and caked boots, the smear of mud across his cheek. He murmured awkwardly: “[MASK] sorry . . . most distressed you weren’t met.” For a moment her resentment mastered her.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Francis	All [MASK]’ combativeness rose hotly in response. As he bandaged his broken head, his own wound gave him a wild idea, making him pause, rigid and intent. Yes ... he must ... he must get closer to the people . . . and this ...
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Joshua	Your mind must be breaking up.” She laughed indulgently and tried to coax him. “Shall I tell [MASK] you’ve decided not to go?” “Tell him to have the ponies saddled in an hour.” He saw her depart, shaking her head reproachfully.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Gingerly	“[MASK], breathlessly, he began flipping stones, trying to start out the fish without snapping the cast. The game continued for an agony of time. Then whirr! — off went the fish, to the scream of the reel.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Chisholm	“ ‘Imaginary!’ “ ‘I saw it there yesterday, under the weir, but of course I didn’t dare try for it.’ “From beneath his sandy brows he gave me his dour smile. ‘You’re a perverse demon, [MASK].
<name>John</name>	John	Nora	Then slowly she straightened herself. With averted eyes, she took her handkerchief, rubbed her ravaged, tear-stained face, straightened her hat, then said, in an exhausted neutral tone: “We’d better get home.” “Look at me, [MASK]?”
<name>Helena</name>	Helena	Francis	He went on stirring with his glass rod, mixing the mauve solution. “There have been many matters to attend to, much business to settle. But now,” — a resigned bow, — “I am here.” “Why?” Shortly, from [MASK].
<name>Australia</name>	Australia	Liu	It would seem the worst kind of stupidity, having pulled them out of the gutter, to throw them back again, benevolently, now they are educated. And [MASK] itself will profit by an infusion of fresh blood. There is ample land, a stirring climate.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Francis	“Troubles resolve themselves best, in my experience, without outside interference.” There appeared nothing more to be said. The Headmaster turned up his desk lamp which, while it brightened the dark study, seemed to terminate the interview. [MASK] got up.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Thad	“As a matter of fact, [MASK],” he cocked his eye, significantly, “I have a announcement ... a important announcement I want to make. I’ll say a few words later, since you press me.”
<name>He</name>	He	Francis	With a faint smile. She flushed slightly; [MASK] wondered why she should seem so queer. “It’s one of the few things I look forward to in the year. After all, you are a Burgess of the town. It’s . . .
<name>Wang</name>	Wang	Joseph	When the old Father was seated in one, [MASK] mounted unsteadily upon the other, almost overbalancing, and unrolled the vermilion scroll. “Most Reverend and Worthy Disciple of the Lord of Heaven, it is with the utmost anguish that we, thy children, witness thy departure across the broad oceans . . .”
<name>Anfisa</name>	Anfisa	Martha	She was very devout and when she prayed, with her head inclined to one side, tears would gush from her pale green eyes. [MASK] was a different person: past forty, stocky and strong, a peasant type, dark-complexioned and with a net of wrinkles round her eyes.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Francis	“Don’t preach at me, sir!” “I’m sorry. You can see I don’t know what I’m saying. I’m trying to beg you to use your power.” [MASK] mustered his flagging forces in a final effort.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Andrew	He sensed that the gift was for him. He resented it, was vaguely, absurdly dis- concerted. The knock on his door made him pull his scattered wits together. “Come in.” [MASK] entered the room and put the fruits upon the chest o! drawers.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Anselm	“Many of these priests are good and noble men.” There was a strained silence. [MASK] drew his coat about him with a shocked finality. “After that, of course, there is nothing to be said. I must confess your attitude pains me deeply.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Francis	Ah, those were my pioneering days, [MASK]. I pine for them sometimes. Now,” he smiled, “I’m only a Bishop. Do you see much change in me since we parted on that Orient strand?”
<name>Richelieu</name>	Richelieu	Newman	And he longed passionately for that advancement as much, perhaps, as he longed for the advancement of Holy Church herself. A keen student of contemporary history, he likened himself often in his own mind to [MASK]. He merited equal eminence.
<name>She</name>	She	Blushing	[MASK] deeply, unexpectedly she slipped down the ladder and ran out of the shed. He followed slowly, darkly red, rubbing the small moist spot upon his cheek as though it were a wound. His heart was pounding. That night the Halloween party began at seven o’clock.
<name>Scrambling</name>	Scrambling	Bundled	Save your breath.” [MASK] about, surrounded by the soldiers, they were roughly pushed along the path which they had recently traversed. About five li back, the young officer turned west into a dry watercourse which took a tortuous and stony course into the hills.
<name>Tim</name>	Tim	Adam	An object now of popular awe, in his cups he indignantly declared himself defrauded. “I never got enough for myself. Them bloody scalpers! But they’ll never get ahold of me poor old [MASK]! God damn the fear! I’ll enlist for a sailor and drown myself.”
<name>Edwin</name>	Edwin	Tulloch	“He made certain rules. Your Dr. [MASK] did not obey them. You know that. Why, when he was unconscious, at the end, you did not even administer extreme unction.” “No, I didn’t! And perhaps I should have.”
<name>Stavrogin</name>	Stavrogin	Tulloch	“Yes, it’s come!” As an afterthought: “Yesterday the main artery thrombosed. It wasn’t any use — even to amputate.” “Am I too late?” “No.” [MASK]’s manner held a subdued violence.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Francis	It was three months later when the Bishop’s summons arrived. [MASK] had expected it for some time now, yet its actual arrival somewhat dismayed him. Heavy rain began as he walked up the hill towards the palace; only by racing the intervening distance did he avoid a thorough drenching.
<name>Thirteen</name>	Thirteen	Charlotte	130 felt a stir of genuine compunction. There was no doubt that something existed, here, in this still white room, outside the bonds of natural experience. “You don’t mind if I examine you, [MASK]?”
<name>Olga</name>	Olga	Nora	“And is happiness the ultimate objective of our earthly life?” “She’ll do something desperate. You can’t compel [MASK]. I know her better than you.” “You seem to know her intimately.”
<name>Wang</name>	Wang	Joshua	But it was impossible, he fell heavily, beads of perspiration breaking on his brow. His leg, swollen to three times its natural size, was quite unusable. In a whisper he told [MASK] to take the half-unconscious doctor on his back and carry him very quietly to the sampans.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Malcom	[MASK] was not rich. Not yet. But by taking all his savings, by mortgaging his house and business, he had just enough to execute a three months’ option on this land. He knew what an artesian bore would do. That bore would never be driven.
<name>She</name>	She	Nora	It was not work but glorious sport. They forgot their earlier embarrassment, competed as to who should rake the most. When he had raked a great pile for himself [MASK] mischievously despoiled it. Their laughter rang in the high clear air.
<name>fireworks</name>	fireworks	Chinese	“Thank you, thank you, Father. What pretty colours. Are they [MASK]?” “Much worse. I’m afraid.” The old priest smiled and shook his head. He would say no more.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Francis	It starts bad thoughts working in these young folks’ minds. It leads to concupiscence, carnality and lusts of the flesh.” [MASK] was very pale, his eyes were blazing with indignation. “Aren’t you confusing lust with sex?”
<name>Emilio</name>	Emilio	Francis	The horseman shouted at him, an insult charged with hatred, then raised his hand with immediate deadly menace. [MASK] did not move. His perfect immobility, uncaring and resigned, seemed to disconcert the other. While he hesitated for an instant a pressing cry was raised from behind.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Francis	There was hope, quiet affection in the voice. [MASK] did not answer. As he stood there, indecisively, hardly knowing what to say, torn by conflicting difficulties, his downcast gaze struck suddenly upon a letter, lying open on the desk.
<name>Armitage</name>	Armitage	Wai	A penetrating silence followed the introduction of the prisoners. [MASK] studied them with deep and meditative cruelty. It was a hidden cruelty, sensed rather than seen, behind the mask of his face. “The voluntary gift has not been paid.” His voice was flat, unemotional.
<name>Elvira</name>	Elvira	Wai	Two soldiers then seized the ends of each spit and, raising the prisoners, marched them in procession round the arena six times, in narrowing circles, bringing up before the bullet-pocked fagade of the house where [MASK] was seated.
<name>Wemmick</name>	Wemmick	Joseph	There was something in the mass attention of their eyes, all bent affectionately upon his insignificant form, which gripped him with a sudden pang. A deeper hush. From his nervousness it was clear that [MASK] had been entrusted with the honour of the address.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Francis	Holding the rivets, white-hot from the brazier, [MASK] shinned up the ladder and thrust them quickly through the bolt-holes in the frame, where they were hammered flat and tight, annealing the great sheets of metal which formed the ship’s hull.
<name>Father</name>	Father	Fiske	“I have already indicated that we are without worldly goods.” “For each person five thousand dollars is requested. No more.” [MASK] breathed more easily. The sum, though large, was not impossible to a mission as wealthy as his own.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Owen	He thought that grief had momentarily turned her mind. He went into the room. [MASK] was lying on the counterpane of his bed. His lower limbs were unbandaged, bare. They were rather thin, showing the wasting of disease. Both were sound, unblemished.
<name>Valentin</name>	Valentin	Shon	He knew [MASK] well enough to let him talk himself out. And tonight the other had less to say than usual. He glanced guardedly at the priest. “Why don’t you ask it, my friend? You are here for help which I cannot give.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Joseph	In the still darkness he could hear [MASK]’s deep and peaceful breathing. He lay for a moment, trying to reason away his vague distress. But he could not. He got up, cautiously, so that he might not wake the sleeping boy, and slipped out of the stable into the compound.
<name>MacMurrough</name>	MacMurrough	Dougal	The jargonelle espalier in the south corner was at its best. Since there was no sign of the tyrant [MASK], with a cautious glance towards the kitchen window he stole the finest pear from his own tree, slid it under his soutane. 4
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Francis	He handed [MASK] a tiny glassful of the neat spirit, watched him drink it, then drank his own. He sat down on the other side of the fireplace. “Speaking of dignity, do not look so scared of me. I’m bedizened now — I admit.
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Francis	Behind the long counter, wrapping physic on a marble slab spattered with red sealing wax, stood the doctor’s eldest son, a sturdy freckled boy of sixteen with big hands, sandy colouring and a slow taciturn smile. He smiled now, staunchly, as he greeted [MASK].
<name>He</name>	He	IX	Yet, as they filed from the room, he could see they were not reconciled. He suddenly felt a shiver of unname-able fear. He had the strange sensation that time swung suspended, balanced in fateful expectation of what might come to pass. [MASK]
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Francis	“Have one, [MASK]?” He sat down opposite, took the apple she held out to him. The taste was delicious. They watched each other eating. When her small teeth bit through the amber skin into the crisp white flesh, little spurts of juice ran down her chin.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Nora	Next morning dawned clear. He rose and, according to his habit, went out to early mass. When he returned he found [MASK] seated outside on the back-yard steps warming herself in a patch of sunshine while at her feet some chickens cheeped and scuttled.
<name>Whelan</name>	Whelan	Francis	Your first donation will be eight hundred pounds of rice and all American canned goods in your storerooms.” “We are already short of food.” Despite his resolution, [MASK] felt his temper rise; he spoke heatedly. “You cannot rob us in this fashion.”
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Francis	To the rest he was a hero, and he bore his successes with open smiling modesty. Now, as he handed [MASK] the letter, he gave him that warm disarming smile. “Hope it’s full of good news, dear fellow.”
<name>he</name>	he	Sister	Her look of frightened guilt revealed everything. It sickened him. He felt debased and humiliated. He had difficulty in finding words. “I suppose you’ve given her food every night . . . when [MASK] left her, thinking she was asleep?”
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Chisholm	He could not brook obstruction He had a sudden wild longing for the rack, the boot, the wheel. Small wonder the medievalists had recourse to such instruments! There were circumstances which fully justified them. “I believe you are lying, [MASK].”
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Anselm	It is an office of the first importance but no more than she deserves. She seems contented ... at peace. Her letter brings me such a fragrance of the Holy City — that might be one of [MASK]’s phrases!—always the object of my tender longings, I have dared to make a plan.
<name>Yakov</name>	Yakov	Fiske	They all joined hands. He prayed, as best he could, better than he had prayed in all his life. Then the soldiers came for them. Weakened as they were, the river seemed colder than before. [MASK] shouted hysterically as they drove him in.
<name>Latimer</name>	Latimer	Francis	“It is a small place on the uplands — almost unknown. My cousin only learned of it from his trade in sheepskins.” [MASK]’ eagerness sustained him. “Could you ask him? Could you procure directions for me . . . perhaps a map?”
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Francis	Then he faded into the night. The music of the fiddlers followed him. When [MASK] returned, late, he found the parish priest sitting up in the parlour, with no fire, his hands on his knees.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Fiske	All next day that phrase fell incessantly from [MASK]’s lips. His face and hands were hot to the touch. Lack of sleep and air had made him feverish. But it was evening before a loud shouting and the barking of dogs gave indication of a late arrival.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Judy	And she had died in bearing it. ‘Now I reflect there had always been a dark thread running through the flimsy fabric of [MASK]’s inconsequential life. She was the visible evidence, not of sin — how I detest and distrust that word!—but of man’s weakness and stupidity.
<name>Chu</name>	Chu	Wai	For such hospitality a voluntary gift is customary. At noon on the day following tomorrow two of my men will await him, half a li outside the Manchu Gate. He will advance, quite alone.” [MASK] paused blankly.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Francis	He took another tot to stiffen himself, his battered face oddly sober, his tone subdued. “I’ll tell you then, [MASK], if you swear to keep it dark. The truth of it is . . .
<name>Manolin</name>	Manolin	Humph	“[MASK]! There’s not much profit in you, is there boy?” “No, sir, except sir . . .” Trembling: “. . . Maybe I can fish.” “Maybe, eh?” A slow dry smile.
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Shon	“My friend, I must continue to regard you as a gift from heaven.” A cloud passed over the priest’s set face. “I have forgotten about heaven tonight.” [MASK] nodded, not thinking of that remark.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Andrew	After all, the moment was not opportune. Yet from time to time his stare travelled coverdy towards the boy. “So you are [MASK]!” Decency demanded speech, even a hint of benignness. “And you go to school here?” “Yes . .
<name>She</name>	She	Nora	I tell you ... get out of my road . . . I’ve got to tend to her.” Rebuffed, he climbed sombrely to his room, chilled by the mounting premonitions of this unknown dread. [MASK], having scarcely given him a look, had gone immediately to bed.
