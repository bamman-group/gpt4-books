<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Maisie	If [MASK] happened to say that she had taken a walk the evening before, he was quick to say that he and ‘ his girl ’ were on the seawall on such and such a night, or that the next night they were going for a long drive in the tramcar.
<name>Annie</name>	Annie	Alice	‘ One night a few days after he leave I dream, and he appear to me in the dream and he say, “ [MASK], don’t vex with me. I’s not my fault. She catch me in fish ”.’ There was a long pause.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Haynes	This was a home shot. [MASK] had intended to give an outright no to the boarding scheme, but shaken by the fifteen dollars hint, he temporised by saying he would think the matter over. Late that night he was reading when he heard a knock at his door.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Haynes	She sprang to the door and [MASK] followed her. As he stood over her the intimate scent of her hair was in his nostrils. He had never been so near a woman before. But he had no time to savour this new and exciting sensation.
<name>Gerty</name>	Gerty	Philomen	I lose twenty pounds in the last two months.’ She went off into a long rambling story of her love affairs, the intolerance of her lover and his exorbitant demands upon her patience. Nothing pleased [MASK] more than to get an opportunity to chatter about her sweetheart.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ella	And as you can understand, I didn’t want everybody to know that I had asked you that favour.’ He was further enlightened the next morning. [MASK] had got to know of the little transaction. ‘ The nurse borrow money from you and pay you back.
<name>Miss Mattie</name>	Miss Mattie	Aucher	Then he try to come near me to hold me. But I tell him that if he touch me I will bawl the house down. So he stand up looking sheepish and then I call for [MASK], and when I call he pick up himself and walk out.’
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Haynes	Her regard for him extended beyond the borders of his personal comfort and well-being. Nobody could say anything against [MASK]. She was at once a flame of protest. She guarded his property jealously, keeping track of books and records borrowed over long by careless friends.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Maisie	Then he heard [MASK]’s voice outside raised. ‘ You old advantage-taker! But I am not going to take this so, though. By Christ, I am not going to take it so.’ The incident ruined the day.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Maisie	But the show bored him; long before it was over he left, and not knowing what to do with himself he came back slowly home, put his bicycle under the house — [MASK] always used to do that—and mounted the steps into his room.
<name>Lucien</name>	Lucien	Maisie	So she preferred to stay inside, keeping door and window tightly closed, running a serious risk of suffocation in the terrible heat. He had been taken by [MASK]’s face the first day, but whenever he looked at her she was looking at him and smiling, which discouraged him.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Maisie	The blind between the dining-room and drawing-room was closed so that he could not see, but there were at least a dozen people in the room. [MASK] came to the door wearing a Sunday dress and when she saw him she began to preen herself.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Haynes	See now, about two o’clock, all the spirits of the air passing up and down. And if you know what to do you can compel them and make them do what you like.’ [MASK] stared at him. Was the man mad?
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Benoit	‘ She wants you for herself alone. And you treat her very badly, [MASK]. If you went down once or twice a week to the nurse. In the night----- But going as you do makes her ashamed. And you neglect her.’ ‘ Neglect her ?
<name>He</name>	He	Haynes	‘No.’ ‘ Let’s go over to the bar and have a drink. There is a private room at the back.’ The private room was empty. [MASK] ordered two beers, and they sat down on opposite sides of the little table.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Haynes	About four o’clock one afternoon [MASK] was driving in the tram car, on the firm’s business, when he caught a fleeting glimpse of the tail-end of a crowd above which towered a policeman’s helmet. Many heads turned and there was a buzz of conversation in the tram.
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Haynes	A grey, but well-preserved military-looking man in the late fifties. His whiskers were certainly not attractive, but [MASK] liked his face. Nor did he look one who had come to complain about his ill-treatment of the morning.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Maisie	He worked that afternoon with feverish haste and anxiety. [MASK] rang him up and he answered, telling her that if she went home before he did he would never speak to her again. She gave a very docile ‘ All right,’ and he slammed the receiver down.
<name>Antoine</name>	Antoine	Haynes	‘ After all, [MASK], a man is not a litde boy. ... I’s all her fault. . . . You would have done the same in my place. She always was a jealous woman. And that spoil everything. I’s her fault.’
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Ella	But never once (except one day when it rained from three in the morning to ten o’clock without a break) was any meal late, and although his meals varied in quality, yet, judging from [MASK]’s standard, he got good value for the money.
<name>Tituba</name>	Tituba	Haynes	Inside was a piece of foolscap paper on which [MASK] read as follows : ‘ You son of a bitch, you not ashamed. You dog, you bitch, you son of a bitch. You still encouraging the man. You think you going to take him away but he leave you.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Maisie	Give her a chance this time.’ ‘ I don’t want any chance,’ said [MASK], wiping her eyes. ‘ Chance what! I say I didn’t take the beef. What! I am any cat to go snatching stale beef out of a pot ? ’
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Philomen	She tell her, too, that she is a servant, that if she want to use the comb and brush she could use it because you and she are friends, but [MASK] should know her place. And a lot of things.
<name>He</name>	He	Haynes	‘ Will you follow me sir? ’ She made a slight bow and turned and led the way, carrying herself erect with a mature grace and dignity which [MASK] thought assumed for the occasion but which he learnt to know later were natural to her.
<name>John</name>	John	Haynes	The difference between her appearance today and before when she had led [MASK] into that very room made him realise more than imagination could what she had gone through. Then she was a stout housewife, slightly care-worn, but cheerful, hopeful of the future if even things were not as bright as she wished.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Benoit	‘ Hold her and kiss her,’ [MASK] had said. So he held her and kissed her, and then to his astonishment did what he liked with her. He could not look her in the eye the next morning, but gradually that awkwardness wore off.
<name>Annie</name>	Annie	Ella	She hold them and wring them by the neck. And I can’t understand myself, waiting there with that long kitchen knife to kill the man. How you expect him to come back after that?’ ‘ I hear [MASK] is sick,’ she said later. ‘
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Benoit	She had her beads and told them with a tense concentration which seemed to be unaware of him sitting at her side. [MASK]. So that good-for-nothing had been stricken and the woman had left him. Served him right. Poor devil.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Haynes	A woman isn’t like a loaf of bread, where you share you only have half. [MASK], man, you are afraid. She always in your room. Choose your chance, hold the girl and kiss her. You needn’t even tell her anything.
<name>they</name>	they	Benoit	She have eyes to see them, but she haven’t eyes to see herself. I am sure if I wanted to laugh, she and how [MASK] treat her would be the first thing I would laugh at.’
<name>Johnson</name>	Johnson	Benoit	The man came in, and she went back into the kitchen. ‘ I am [MASK],’ he said and shook hands. He was rather a big man with a slight paunch. His very black face was undistinguished-looking, neither handsome nor ugly.
<name>Spanish</name>	Spanish	Chinee	That is six cents. He look at me and he say something to his friend in [MASK] and then he ask me where I come from. “ No damn business of yours,” I tell him. “ Give me the cones quick.”
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Maisie	‘ [MASK]! Somebody knocking. Go and see who it is. Don’t keep the person waiting.’ But nobody came. The same voice spoke again, more sharply. ‘ But, girl, you didn’t hear me? The bigger you grow, the lazier you getting.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Haynes	you mean to continue with her?’ said [MASK], who in his simplicity had looked upon the affair as over. ‘ If I have to leave this one! The nurse going good. Her colour help her, you see: she does only attend to the white people.
<name>Adèle</name>	Adèle	Maisie	She turned to [MASK]. ‘ Then it’s you, you wretch! You eating me out. You don’t do anything in this place, and the little piece of beef I have for people to eat you steal it.’ ‘ But I tell you I didn’t steal it.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ella	She usually worked for the white people who could afford one nurse for the day and another for the night. But the nurse was greedy ([MASK]’s phrase) and always worked day and night. She could do this for weeks.
<name>she</name>	she	Maisie	They never made love except when they were about to go to bed together. The affair was not altogether what he had expected it would be, but as he wanted no more than [MASK] gave, he missed nothing. But day by day they became better friends.
<name>Rosalind</name>	Rosalind	Haynes	I am still here, helping with the cake; I checking the book; I doing everything as before. All men go out. What she making such a fool of herself for?’ ‘ She is jealous,’ said [MASK], student of human nature.
<name>McGowan</name>	McGowan	Benoit	She dropped her head on her arm again and said slowly. ‘ It’s all that [MASK]’s fault. That man! He would carry his freshness to the Virgin Mary.’ There were footsteps in the yard.
<name>Kim</name>	Kim	Haynes	‘ No, man. I hear you writing letters, making receipts, giving advice and so on. In fact you take my place.’ He laughed and spoke more like himself than since they had met. ‘Going anywhere particular?’ [MASK] asked him.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Maisie	‘ Just let me put my hands on you,’ she panted and fumbled in her pocket for the key. ‘ Oh, you coming to open, eh ? ’ said [MASK]. ‘ Come on,’ and continued with her catalogue. 4 Here! ’
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Benoit	It seemed, too, that she had discovered a similar situation some months before, but had pardoned the couple. But this turned out to be some kissing alone, and both the nurse and [MASK] swore that there was nothing else in it.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Philomen	‘ If is the doctor ’e wouldn’t listen to, is you ’e goin’ to hear? ’ The two of them sat down on the little bench and the others began to eat inside. [MASK] came in, on her arm a heavy basket.
<name>John</name>	John	Haynes	Thank you, I likes a little whisky.’ After a general conversation and two whiskies and sodas, [MASK] said goodbye and went over to his room, full of food and drink and vaguely conscious that of all the Christmas eating and drinking, this had been the best.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Philomen	And he warn me against having any coolies around me. He say so long as I have, things bound to go bad. I tell him all that [MASK] was to me and all she do for me, and if I send her away that would be ingratitude.
<name>She</name>	She	Maisie	So he held her and kissed her, and then to his astonishment did what he liked with her. He could not look her in the eye the next morning, but gradually that awkwardness wore off. [MASK] was the soul of discretion.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Haynes	I’s better she go. If she stay it will mean sessions for one o’ them.’ ‘ I suppose she will have to go now,’ [MASK] said. ‘ I don’t see how she can stay after this.’
<name>He</name>	He	Outside	He helped the weeping, quivering boy to his feet and sat on the bed holding his hand expecting the nurse to come. But the nurse did not come. [MASK] was very still and he understood that they were waiting to see what he would do.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Haynes	[MASK] had no answer to give, nor did she seem to want any. In the darkness he could hardly see her face, could only hear with the distinctness which darkness gives the tones of her voice charged with fatigue, and with settled determination.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Haynes	* Now take care,’ said [MASK]. ‘ When you go out don’t start that quarrel again.’ ‘ No, I wouldn’t. But,’ she whispered to him, ‘ I took the beef, you know.’ * You took the beef?’
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Maisie	When you first came here you couldn’t say boo to a goose.’ ‘ Come, tell me something, [MASK]. Leave this going to work alone for the minute. Have you any plans for your future, any sort of plans at all ? ’
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Haynes	The two of them would continue to live together and there were legal formalities still to be gone through before No. 2 could be sold. After they moved [MASK] went to see them fairly regularly, but after a time became rather remiss.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Haynes	If [MASK] was there he called her into his room and she always came, pausing on the top step to fire a parting shot. Otherwise she raged unchecked. Night after night she held court by the gate, the centre of half a dozen young men.
<name>Nora</name>	Nora	Maisie	She ran into the kitchen, took up the hatchet, and going to the door began to break it open. But by this time [MASK] was finished. ‘ Stop breaking down your door, old woman,’ she said. ‘ Stop or I’ll break this bottle on your head.’
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Ella	She gave it to him in an envelope with thanks and a little apology for having had to ask. ‘ Why I asked you to tear up the note was because [MASK] has a habit of going into your drawer when you are not here, taking out your private letters and reading them.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Haynes	She always in your room. Choose your chance, hold the girl and kiss her. You needn’t even tell her anything. You just hold her and kiss her well. Boy, if I was up there I’d show you.’ [MASK] said he had to go.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Maisie	He stole a glance at [MASK]. She was leaning forward, her eyes on the table before her, but as he looked at her, although she did not look at him he knew that she had seen him for she swayed towards him, and he felt her body lean slightly against his.
<name>Ratna</name>	Ratna	Philomen	Also she had a cold and spat voluptously. [MASK], the Indian servant, who lived in the house, was fat and brown and pleasant-looking. Her masses of straight black hair banded down by a white cloth gave her a picturesque effect.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Maisie	After all, he lived there, was very comfortable. They were as nice as ever. Why bother? But still he doubted and brooded until, chiefly through [MASK], his doubts were resolved, or at least he worried about the matter no longer.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Benoit	Life had left its mark upon her, in her weather-beaten body and hard style as much as in the fact that she, a professional woman with so fair a skin, lived openly and without shame in the house of these lowly black folk. And she was not only [MASK]’s mistress.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Haynes	He looked tired. His cheeks were drawn and his eyes bloodshot as on the night after the nurse had left. But he was very cheerful. ‘ You have cigarettes?’ [MASK] showed him the bo«. -nd he lit up.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Maisie	‘But why do you speak to her like that, [MASK]? I thought you and she got on very well.’ ‘ Long ago. But not again. I don’t know her any more. She is a servant. And she should know her place.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Benoit	He heard voices in the yard. In the stillness of the early morning, they were very clear. One voice was deep. [MASK]’s, but talking in a low tone. Through the thin wood of which the house was built sounds from outside came through distinctly.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Maisie	None of us want you to go.’ In the silence that ensued a new aspect of [MASK], vaguely present for some time in the background of his mind, suddenly emerged clearly. She was a damned, pretty girl, and would be very nice to sleep with.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Ella	He laughed, shelled two nuts at once, blew the thin skin away, threw the kernels into his mouth and walked over to the window to look at something or someone in the street. ‘ [MASK] is coming,’ he said.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Haynes	[MASK] could stay in bed no longer. He began to walk up and down the room. He began to dress intending, vaguely, to go for a walk. But he didn’t go for any walk. Instead he opened his door and sat waiting to see the household set about its daily tasks.
<name>me</name>	me	Ella	And I know that you is a gentleman and this will go no further. But them people,’ she pointed towards the Rouse household, ‘ them people is a set of thieves and liars. They wants to put you against [MASK].
<name>She</name>	She	Haynes	But she left the examination room to go back to her patient, sending to say that she hr.d done well, expected to pass this time, and would be home on Friday afternoon. [MASK], meanwhile, had got better and gone out to work.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Ella	‘ And I must stop putting off things. I’ll go immediately after supper.’ [MASK] did not receive him coldly. She laughed, and he told her he was glad to see her looking so well. ‘ You lookin’ well, too, sir,’ she replied.
<name>John</name>	John	Haynes	That is what is killing me. If she would only take me----- This house is going to be a prison cell.’ She was speaking in a low tone and the last few words had been addressed as much to herself as to [MASK]. Suddenly she held her head up.
<name>He</name>	He	Benoit	The place was almost in darkness, the only light being the light of the chapelle in her bedroom and the small candle by which she was reading. From eight o’clock she sat waiting, and it was after twelve when [MASK] came.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Maisie	How it would startle [MASK]! Curious that though he was certain she was lying and wanted to curse her for it he hadn’t the slightest ill-will towards her. He made up his mind to greet her with the words if she came. It would help.
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Haynes	You mustn’t say such things.’ She was smiling, but she was serious. ‘ Why mustn’t I say such things?’ said [MASK], but he spoke mechanically. ‘ Because they aren’t true. Come, let us go in.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Ella	‘ Get a room at once, [MASK],’ he said. ‘ I am going to leave here as soon as my foot is better.’ He would not stay a moment longer than was necessary in the same house with that woman.
<name>Prudence</name>	Prudence	Maisie	‘ Ask me nothing. I wishes to get into no contention with you, young woman.’ ‘ To besides, I went to see the wedding for myself,’ said [MASK]. ‘ And what I see, I see. I ain’t no newspaper.’
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Haynes	And now she had come into [MASK]’s room, and taken charge of him, and having washed and bound his foot, gave him quinine, lowered his lamp and told him that it was time to go to bed.
<name>Anancy</name>	Anancy	Benoit	[MASK] say he know science. He tell the nurse what to do to pass. And they write the doctor’s name on a piece of paper and they put it in the nurse’s boots. So whenever she walk she mash him down.
<name>Brigid</name>	Brigid	Ella	When the nurse came she would get her walking ticket. ‘ Listen, sir, listen. They are plannin’ a ’laborate ceremony.’ ‘ Very well, [MASK]. Go outside and close my door, please.’
<name>him</name>	him	Haynes	And she did things which he remembered for days and made [MASK] feel that there was nothing he could not do for her. One morning she brought in two pieces of cloth for his opinion on them. One was red, a bright vermilion, the other pale green.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Haynes	4 Took the beef?’ [MASK] whispered. She nodded an affirmative. ‘ Give it back. I’ll make things right.’ ‘ I’ll go to gaol first.’ It was no use arguing with her in this mood and on this question.
<name>Titus</name>	Titus	Benoit	I tell you he safeguard himself good when he made that mortgage. I am surrounded on all sides. . . . All this persecution, you see I suffering from [MASK] and that woman, it’s the house they after, you know.’
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Haynes	‘ Make your move quick, [MASK], or you’ll be left. Boy, I was on a big time today. I reached the nurse at half-past eight this morning and I ain’t put my foot outside till just now.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Haynes	Let me go out. You letting that woman triumph over me.’ [MASK] thought she would assault him. * Don’t mind all that. I am not going to let you pass. Let her do what she likes. We’ll fix things after.
<name>Macalister</name>	Macalister	Benoit	‘ No need to read it,’ said [MASK], folding the sheet of notepaper and taking up an envelope from the table. ‘ Yes, man. I am going down. The nurse told me that a man of my appearance have no right making cakes.
<name>Annie</name>	Annie	Maisie	‘ You speaks to the man as if you is his wife.’ ‘ Tst, tst, tst, tst, tst,’ said [MASK]. ‘ What is that to you ? Is you his mother ? ’
<name>Nettie</name>	Nettie	Philomen	She brings back all my wrongs when I see her. You see I leave her alone. I don’t ask her to do anything. I leave her to do what she want. All the work I have I fight with it, me and [MASK].
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Maisie	She was punctual as always when meeting him and his heart beat when he saw her. Never before had he felt so much like taking her in his arms and holding her tight to him. They held hands. ‘ Well, [MASK],’ he said.
<name>Levin</name>	Levin	Haynes	And he, [MASK], held her by the hand and was in the thick of it. He was uncomfortable, and wished he was elsewhere. But it was life, he thought. * What must I do? What must I do?’ she wailed.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Maisie	But either the nurse had discovered how to say ‘ no ’ even after kisses, or perhaps he didn’t kiss her so often. Six weeks was a very short time. Still, as [MASK] said, ‘ that was his funeral.’
<name>Samuel</name>	Samuel	Haynes	He was looking at [MASK], but absent-mindedly, and seemed to be talking chiefly to relieve himself. ‘ The nurse is a nice woman, man. Nice colour, straight hair, and a moving woman. The nurse and me understand one another well.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Philomen	She used to quarrel and so on, but you used to tell me: “ Don’t mind, she has troubles,” and I used to bear patiently with her, and when her temper pass she used to tell me : “ [MASK], my child, don’t mind when I bawl at you.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Haynes	I’ll give him anything he wants and that a child should have, but he will obey me until he is a man for himself.’ ‘ Yes,’ murmured [MASK]. ‘ I have come to see that foot of yours. Let me feel your pulse.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Maisie	‘ No,’ as she made another attempt to go out. ‘ No, I am not going to see you do anything stupid. You are not going out there. You will have to knock me over to pass. I don’t believe anything against you, [MASK].’
<name>He</name>	He	Haynes	The clock struck three. She was a little hoarse. She had. been talking for nearly two hours. But [MASK] was far from tired and could have listened to the subdued passion of her voice and watched the working of her face until dark.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Haynes	The charge was a serious one, but it was whispered that many of the people she had attended did not wish her to go to gaol, and strong influence would be brought to bear on her behalf. On the day of the case, however, [MASK] was in Court.
<name>John</name>	John	Benoit	The bedroom door opened. [MASK] came out with a bundle of clothes on his arm and two boxes. He went to the front door, wrenched it open with a powerful jerk, and was gone without a look or word to anybody.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Haynes	[MASK] began to be sorry for her, but hardened his heart and rode past her on his bicycle without turning to look. He had to teach her a lesson. CHAPTER 26 He worked that afternoon with feverish haste and anxiety.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Haynes	But [MASK] was waiting for her. He told her he had not got up because he knew she was no more frightened than he was and he didn’t want to hear anything about it because he wasn’t interested.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Haynes	You light it for me.’ ‘ Sure,’ said [MASK]. ‘ Here you are. I give you with a kiss.’ And if he did not seek to implement them, the words at least were bold.
<name>Maria</name>	Maria	Philomen	Gomes at the parlour, who see how [MASK] work for me, offer her four dollars a month and a room in the yard to work for him and his mother, two of them alone, very easy work.
