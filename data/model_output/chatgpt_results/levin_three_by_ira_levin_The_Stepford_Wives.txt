<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Joanna	“No, you didn’t scay-er me. It’s a nice night, isn’t it?” “Yes,” [MASK] said. “And I’m done with my unpacking, which makes it even nicer.”
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Andreas	“This must have been six or seven years ago,” he said, fingering the edge of the yellowed paper. “Or more,” she said. “The Mystique came out while I was still working. [MASK] gave me his review copy, remember?”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Joanna	If my old man was alive he’d have to knock me on the head before I’d let him join!” “But it’s a very old organization, isn’t it?” [MASK] said, tossing salad at arm’s length because of her dress.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Dave	“You’re not going to start in with that chemical business, are you?” She frowned, pressing the closed book to her blanketed knees. “Did [MASK] say anything about their trying pot again?” she asked.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Claude	He gave her eight yellow-boxed cartridges and a black loose-leaf binder. “My gosh, there’s a lot,” she said, leafing through curled and mended pages typed in triple columns. “It goes quickly,” [MASK] said.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Walter	“You get up petitions, you picket—” “But it’s easier from the inside,” [MASK] said. “You’ll see: if these men I spoke to are typical, it’ll be the Everybody's Association before you know it.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Walter	The kitchen was spick-and-span, the washer pounding. [MASK] was at the sink, leaning to the window and looking out toward the Van Sant house. A Rorschach-blot of sweat stained his shirt: a rabbit with its ears bent outward.
<name>Patrick</name>	Patrick	Walter	“I feel very territorial.” [MASK] looked around at the Van Sant house and then squinted at his watch. “I’m going to go in and wash up,” he said, and kissed her cheek. She turned and took his chin and kissed his lips.
<name>Miss Maudie</name>	Miss Maudie	Esther	“Oh good ahfternoon!” [MASK] said. “So nice to speak to you! It must be a super day up there, or are you hyar in town?” “No, I’m at home,” she said.
<name>Whom</name>	Whom	Walter	Home to [MASK]? When had it begun, her distrust of him, the feeling of nothingness between them? Whose fault was it? His face had grown fuller; why hadn’t she noticed it before today? Had she been too busy taking pictures, working in the darkroom?
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Dave	“[MASK]’s had a brainstorm; we’re going to have a weekend alone, just the two of us. Second-honeymoon time.” A sense of beforeness touched her; deja vu. She brushed it away. “That’s great,” she said.
<name>her</name>	her	Bobbie	It’s going to happen to me, in Januaryl" “Nothing’s going to happen to you!” “That’s what I told [MASK]! I kidded her about the bottled water!” He came close to her.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Bobbie	“Fat lot of good it did me.” “Will you play often? All I’ve got now are a couple of teen-age boys, both with permanent erections.” [MASK] said, “Send them to my place”—getting up from the ground.
<name>Casey</name>	Casey	Joanna	“Just let her answer, damn it!” [MASK] stood staring, and nodded. “If she bled,” she said, “I would—think she was—real . . .” “We’re not going to ask someone to cut herself.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Joanna	You told me to rest.” “Let me in for a minute.” She stood watching the door, said nothing. “[MASK], unlock the door.” “Later,” she said. “I want to be alone for a while.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Walter	He looked at his watch and went out of the kitchen. “[MASK]?” she called, touching her hands to a towel. “Yes?” She went to where she could see him, standing in the hallway. “Thanks,” she said, smiling.
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Walter	“She will,” the man in the middle said. “And when she does, you’ll know you’re wrong and you’ll let us take you home to [MASK], without any arguments.” “If she does,” she said.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Charmaine	“Of course we did,” she said. “I said it was okay if nothing came up.” [MASK] closed the door and smiled at her. She was wearing an apron over slacks and a blouse.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Kit	“No, thanks.” She followed [MASK] into the coffee-smelling kitchen. It was immaculate, of course—except for the open dryer, and the clothes and the laundry basket on the counter on top of it. The washer’s round port was storming.
<name>Miss Ada</name>	Miss Ada	Carol	“And I’m done with my unpacking, which makes it even nicer.” She had to speak loud; [MASK] had stayed by her doorway, still too far away for comfortable conversation even though she herself was now at the flower bed edging the split-rail fence.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Kim	“Really?” “I thought that would get you out of the cellar. You’re invited to play, and for lunch too. I’ll pick you up around eleven-thirty.” “Today? I can’t! [MASK] is still home.”
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Bobbie	“And I’m getting more exercise.” “You must have lost ten pounds!” “No, just two or three. I’m wearing a girdle.” “[MASK], will you please tell me what happened last weekend?” “Nothing happened.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Bobbie	Come on, what is it?” So while she scraped the dishes and put them in the washer, she told him about [MASK]’s wanting to move, and her “El Paso” theory. “That sounds pretty far-fetched to me,” he said.
<name>Ed</name>	Ed	Walter	“She had to clean it sooner or later; it was a pigsty.” “She changed, [MASK]! She doesn’t talk the same, she doesn’t think the same —and I’m not going to wait around for it to happen to me!”
<name>Valium</name>	Valium	Joanna	“They’re a mild tranquilizer. You can take three a day.” She tore off a slip and offered it to [MASK], smiling. “They won't make you fascinated with housework,” she said.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Ed	The place looks clean at first glance, but boy, look in the comers. I did the kitchen and the dining room yesterday, but I’ve still got all the other rooms. [MASK] shouldn’t have to live with dirt.”
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Joanna	[MASK], shaking his hand warmly, said, “I’m not sure I like you; you blighted my adolescence with those dream girls of yours!” And he, chuckling, said, “You must have matched up pretty well.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Bobbie	“House-hunting.” “I went shopping this morning,” [MASK] said. “Why didn’t you call me?” “I went very early.” “I went around ten; we must have just missed each other.”
<name>Stanley</name>	Stanley	Frank	We’ve got some slot machines.” “I wouldn’t set foot in there without an armed guard,” she said. “Of women soldiers.” “We’ll clear everyone out,” [MASK] said. “You’ll have the p-place all to yourself.”
<name>Spock</name>	Spock	Pete	Proceed with plans. All systems go. She tiptoed slowly to the door, listened, and turned the key back and eased the door open, a hand held against it. [MASK]’s Star Trek gun lay by the threshold of his room.
<name>Hemingway</name>	Hemingway	Bobbie	“Bullshit, to quote [MASK].” She turned and faced him. “There’s something, there’s got to be,” she said. “Go take a look. Would you do that, please?
<name>unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Walter	There’s a couple here right now who are—” “No, no, not yet,” she said. “I’ll let you know tomorrow.” “Now just hold on a minute,” [MASK] said, making spread-handed calming gestures.
<name>Carol</name>	Carol	Carol	“When you’ve got the kids down, why don’t you come over and have a cup of coffee with me?” “Thanks, I’d like to,” [MASK] said, “but I have to wax the family-room floor.”
<name>Arizona</name>	Arizona	Stepford	“Nothing’s got me,” she said. “There’s nothing around. That was a lot of nonsense. [MASK]’s a fine healthful place to live.” “You—don’t want to move any more?”
<name>Mrs. Gump</name>	Mrs. Gump	Bobbie	“Go ahead, laugh,” [MASK] said. “For a few cents a day I’d rather be safe than sorry. And I’m writing to the Department of Health. The problem is, how do I do it without coming across like a little old lady without all her marbles?
<name>him</name> (Note: There is no proper name that fills in the [MASK] token in this passage. The pronoun "him" refers to a person who was previously mentioned in the context.)	him (Note: There is no proper name that fills in the [MASK] token in this passage. The pronoun "him" refers to a person who was previously mentioned in the context.)	Herb	“Well, it’s not here now, is it?” he said, letting the paper go. “Unless they’ve got the world’s worst publicity chairman. I’ll ask [MASK] what happened next time I see him.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Bobbie	And the men all—” “The Men’s Association!” [MASK] cried. They talked about it—the antiquated sexist unfairness of it, the real injustice, in a town with no women’s organization, not even a League of Women Voters.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Sylvia	“—[MASK]’s or to a hotel. I’ll call you in a day or two. Or have someone call you. Another lawyer.” He stared at her, and said, “What are you talking about?” “I know, ” she said.
<name>she</name>	she	Ruthanne	“Hello. How are you?” Her bow lips were red, her complexion pale rose and perfect. “I’m fine,” [MASK] said, smiling. “I don’t have to ask how you are; you look marvelous.”
<name>Phyllis</name>	Phyllis	Charmaine	But [MASK], who knew the man and had taped for him herself, cut her short with “Never make fun of what a Capricorn’s doing; they produce, ” and went into an around-the-table sign analysis that demanded everyone’s attention.
<name>He</name>	He	Walter	“Need a paintbrush?” she said. [MASK] turned and looked at her. “You don’t expect me to paint these things, do you?” he asked. “No, no,” she said. “It was wrapped in the paper.”
<name>Dad</name>	Dad	Sylvia	“You’ll make it,” [MASK] said, and smiled at her. “How’s the photography? It must be great for you up there, coming to everything with a fresh eye.” “I haven’t done a damn thing,” she said.
<name>Bruce</name>	Bruce	Bobbie	“Still?” “Could we make it Wednesday? Or Thursday, just to be safe.” “Wednesday, ” [MASK] said. “I’ll check with her and call you back.” Wham! Pow! Slam!
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Carol	“Out of date, old-fashioned,” she said. [MASK] squeezed the sponge out above the bucket. “No, it doesn’t seem archaic to me,” she said. She stood up straight and reached the sponge to the top of the next span of folds.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Joanna	There was a brown leather couch with a paper-covered headrest, but [MASK] sat in the chair facing the mahogany desk, on which dozens of small white papers flag-edged the sides of a green blotter. She said, “I’m here at my husband’s suggestion.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Bobbie	“Didn’t think,” she said. “ ‘Over fifty women’!” [MASK] said. “Who the hell were they? What happened?” “That’s what I want to know,” she said.
<name>Patrick</name>	Patrick	Bobbie	She stopped. The music is in case I scream, she thought. She isn't going to cut her finger; she’s going to— “Come on,” [MASK] said, standing by the sink, beckoning, holding the point-bladed knife.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Joanna	“Next summer, not—” “I won’t be me next summer!” “[MASK]—” “Don’t you understand? It’s going to happen to me, in Januaryl" “Nothing’s going to happen to you!”
<name>Harvard</name>	Harvard	Coba	“You don’t look like someone who enjoys making people happy.” Torpedoing forever, no doubt, the admission of women to the hallowed and sacrosanct Men’s Association. [MASK] looked at her—disparagingly. “How little you know,” he said.
<name>Brooklyn</name>	Brooklyn	Norwood	And pick him up late Sunday.” “Fine. How’s the house-hunting?” “Not so good. I saw a beauty in [MASK] this morning, but they’re not getting out till April first.” “So stick around.”
<name>her husband</name>	her husband	Walter	She turned the lamp off. Lying on her back, she swung out her right leg and arm. She missed [MASK] beside her, but the expanse of cool-sheet smoothness was pleasant. How many times had she gone to bed alone since they were married?
<name>Mark</name>	Mark	Pete	She strode past him. “Stop lying,” she said. “You’ve been lying to me ever since I took my first picture.” She swung around and started up the stairs. “[MASK]!” she called.
<name>Mrs. Hale</name>	Mrs. Hale	Joanna	“No, I don’t think I’d have time for anything like that. There’s so much to do around the house. You know.” “But you go out sometimes, don’t you?” [MASK] said.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Kit	[MASK] closed the refrigerator and opened a drawer beside it. “Some of the women moved away,” she said—she closed the drawer and turned, putting a spoon on the saucer—“and the rest of us just lost interest in it. At least I did.”
<name>she</name>	she	Joanna	“Better a little disruption in their lives than a zombie-ized mother,” she said. She really was drinking bottled water, and wasn’t eating any locally grown produce. “You can buy bottled oxygen, you know,” [MASK] said.
<name>Neil</name>	Neil	Frank	“Believe me, we’re not.” “You’re the men who put us on the moon,” she said. “Who is?” he said. “Not me. [MASK], did you put anybody on the moon?
<name>He</name>	He	Bobbie	“She changed in November. [MASK] moved here in August and now it’s December.” She turned and walked away from him. The sink’s faucet was leaking; she hit the handle back hard and the leaking stopped.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Charmaine	“And thanks for today. It was great.” “Any time,” [MASK] said. She leaned to the window. “And look, both of you,” she said, “would you do me a favor?
<name>Janice</name>	Janice	Walter	“There’s nothing in the air,” [MASK] said. “The message I got was good schools and low taxes. Now look, I’m trying to see this from your viewpoint and make some kind of fair judgment.
<name>Betty Friedan</name>	Betty Friedan	Bobbie	“There’s something, ” [MASK] said. “In the ground, in the water, in the air —I don’t know. It makes women interested in housekeeping and nothing else but. Who knows what chemicals can do? Nobel-prize winners don’t even really know yet.
<name>Librarian</name>	Librarian	Joanna	“I’ve done a children’s book, Penny Has a Plan, ” the woman said. “They’ve got it here; I checked the catalog first thing.” “Of course, ” [MASK] said.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Bobbie	“Damn it, no, ” [MASK] said. “We ought to try at least. Let’s talk to these hausfraus; there must be some of them who resent the situation a little. What do you say?
<name>She</name>	She	Mazzard	[MASK] had been nice to do it. Smiling, she ran water into the coffee-maker, plugged it in, and put in the basket and spooned in coffee. She put the top on, pressed the plastic lid down onto the coffee can, and turned around.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Walter	“[MASK]’s worried.” “I’ll bet he is,” she said. They stood before her, four or five yards away; three men. “You shouldn’t be running around like this, no coat on,” one of them said.
<name>her</name>	her	Friedan	“It must have just petered out.” “With fifty members?” she said. “Over fifty? Applauding [MASK], not hissing her?” “Well, it’s not here now, is it?” he said, letting the paper go.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Ted	“Okay,” he said, folding the towel. “Just for a few minutes though. I’m going over to talk with [MASK].” He slid the towel onto a rod of the rack. “That’s why I was looking,” he said.
<name>she</name>	she	Joanna	“Well?” she said. “I suppose it’s—possible,” [MASK] said. “But it sounds so—fantastic.” She took her coffee from the dashboard; it had made a patch of fog on the windshield.
<name>Raymond</name>	Raymond	Joanna	The truck’s brake lights flashed; it stopped, its left-turn signal winking. [MASK] explained what moonlighting was. A car shot down the hill, and the truck began moving across the left lane. “Is that the driveway?”
<name>John</name>	John	Bobbie	They were chained to an overhead line behind the house, the corgi up on his hind legs, pawing air and yipping, the sheepdog standing shaggy and stock-stoll, barking “Ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff.” [MASK]’s blue Chevy stood in the driveway.
<name>Joanna</name>	Joanna	Joanna	[MASK] watched her and shook her head. They never stop, these Stepford wives, she thought. It sounded like the first line of a poem. They never stop, these Stepford wives. They something something all their lives. Work like robots.
<name>Truman</name>	Truman	Bobbie	“Oh no, we’re not done yet!” They spent a morning calling on women together, on the theory ([MASK]’s) that the two of them, speaking in planned ambiguities, might create the encouraging suggestion of a phalanx of women with room for one more.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Carol	“In the evening, or if it’s more convenient for everybody, sometime during school hours.” [MASK], crouching to wipe the lower part of the span, said, “I’m sorry, but I just don’t have much time for that sort of thing.”
<name>Kevin</name>	Kevin	Pete	“We’re in luck,” he said, going to the refrigerator. “There’s a good Creature Feature; [MASK] doesn’t even want to come down. I put the Sony in his room.” He opened the freezer section and took out a bag of ice cubes.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Pete	She pushed her hair back straight. “I’m going to work down in the darkroom for a while,” she said. “[MASK]’s still awake. Will you keep an ear open?” “Sure,” he said, and smiled at her.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Ruthanne	You know how it is.” “That’s all right,” [MASK] said. “I’ve been busy too. I’m almost done with my book. Just one more main drawing and a few small ones.”
<name>He</name>	He	Coba	He smiled at her and said, “I like to watch women doing little domestic chores.” “You came to the right town,” she said. She tossed the spoon into the sink and took the coffee can to the refrigerator and put it in. [MASK] stayed there, watching her.
<name>Penny</name>	Penny	Joanna	“Do you have any small children?” she asked. [MASK] nodded, puzzled. “I’ve done a children’s book, Penny Has a Plan, ” the woman said. “They’ve got it here; I checked the catalog first thing.”
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Mary	She tossed the salad. “I don’t know,” she said. “The way it’s set up, and that old house . . .” “That was the Terhune place,” [MASK] said, laying a stretch of plastic over the toothpicked platter.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Frank	The men talked with him, and turned to her as she came slowly up the walk. [MASK] smiled. “She says sure,” he said. “If it’ll make you feel b-better she’ll be glad to do it.”
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Joanna	About thirty-three, [MASK] guessed, going into the entrance hall. Its ivory vinyl floor looked as if one of those plastic shields in the commercials had just floated down onto it. Sounds of a baseball game came from the living room.
<name>Paris</name>	Paris	Pete	He went back to [MASK]. “Say, that’s good work,” he said. She looked at the paper and shook her head. “I can’t believe it,” she said. “Who were the women? They can’t all have moved away.”
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Charmaine	[MASK] was good, too goddamn good; the ball came zinging straight and hard, first to one side of the court and then to the other; it kept her racing from side to side and then drove her all the way back—a just-inside-the-liner that she barely caught.
<name>Joanna</name>	Joanna	Joanna	Like an actress in a commercial. That’s what she was, [MASK] felt suddenly. That’s what they all were, all the Stepford wives: actresses in commercials, pleased with detergents and floor wax, with cleansers, shampoos, and deodorants.
<name>She</name>	She	Carol	“Night is the only time to do it, until school starts.” “Well, can’t it wait? It’s only three more days.” [MASK] shook her head. “No, I’ve put it off too long as it is,” she said.
<name>George</name>	George	Ted	“No, I’ve put it off too long as it is,” she said. “It’s all over scuff-marks. And besides, [MASK] will be going to the Men’s Association later on.” “Does he go every night?”
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Bobbie	“Oh. Call me in the morning then; maybe we can have lunch. Unless you’re going house-hunting.” “I’m not,” [MASK] said. “Call me then, okay?”
<name>she</name>	she	Bobbie	They talked about it—the antiquated sexist unfairness of it, the real injustice, in a town with no women’s organization, not even a League of Women Voters. “Believe me, I’ve combed this place,” [MASK] said.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Joanna	“I haven’t mentioned it to him yet. I thought I’d try it out on you first.” [MASK] sipped her coffee. “Well, it’s in the realm of possibility, ” she said. “I don't think you’re off your rocker.
<name>She</name>	She	Walter	She went to the Center again after lunch, took pictures of the creche, and got home just ahead of the school bus. [MASK] did the dishes and then went to the Men’s Association. The toys were for kids in the city, ghetto kids and kids in hospitals.
<name>Carol</name>	Carol	Joanna	She was wearing an apron over slacks and a blouse. “Gosh, I’m sorry, [MASK],” she said. “I completely forgot.” “That’s all right,” she said, “go change.”
<name>George</name>	George	Joanna	[MASK] turned. He held out a small white-capped bottle. “Yes,” she said, taking it. “Do you have some water? I’d like to take one now.” He nodded and went in back.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Dave	Her mouth was big, with unusually white teeth, and she had blue take-in-everything eyes and short dark tufty hair. And small hands and dirty toes. And a husband named [MASK] who was a stock analyst, and three sons, ten, eight, and six.
<name>Mr. Jingle</name>	Mr. Jingle	Joanna	Hello?” “Hello,” [MASK] said. “Yes, I’m here. And how I’m here! Hello! Son of a gun, it pays to advertise!” “What a pleasure to see a messy kitchen!”
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Joanna	I mean, it’s scrub, scrub, scrub; wax, wax, wax—” “It’s the same around here,” [MASK] said. “Even at night! And the men all—” “The Men’s Association!”
<name>Philip Marlowe</name>	Philip Marlowe	Joanna	“Mm-mmn,” she said. “I worked for a government agency; forget it. I think the thing to do is move out. Then futz around with letters.” [MASK] looked at her.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Walter	She went back into the kitchen and filled bowls with potato chips and peanuts. There were no objections from the circle of men when, holding her glass, she said “May I?” and eased into the sofa-end [MASK] had saved for her.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Joanna	“Our weekend alone?” she said. “I think you ought to lie down awhile,” he said. He put a hand to the wall, his other hand to the banister. “You’re not making sense, [MASK],” he said.
<name>him</name>	him	Kim	She looked up at him and said, “Don’t change channels on her.” “Oh, all right,” he said, winding a finger in the dark strand. “And don’t kick, ” she told [MASK].
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Pete	Maybe you’ll see another chipmunk.” [MASK] came over and lifted a strand of her hair. She looked up at him and said, “Don’t change channels on her.” “Oh, all right,” he said, winding a finger in the dark strand.
<name>Georgia</name>	Georgia	Bobbie	“[MASK] has, darn near,” she said. She folded the paper, and folded it, and put it on the carton of her equipment. The paintbrush was there; she picked it up. “Need a paintbrush?” she said.
