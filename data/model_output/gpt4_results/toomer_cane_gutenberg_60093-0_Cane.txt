<name>Soaphead</name>	Soaphead	Layman	Misshapen, split-gut, tortured, twisted words. [MASK] was feedin it back there that day you thought I ran out fearin things. White folks feed it cause their looks are words. Niggers, black niggers feed it cause theyre evil an their looks are words.
<name>Jedediah</name>	Jedediah	McGregor	Town folks know it. They are not startled. They are not afraid. They gather round. Some beg boxes from the grocery stores. From old [MASK]’s notion shop. A coffin-case is pressed into use. Folks line the curb-stones.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	John	The director wants to get the rehearsal through with. The girls line up. [MASK] sees the front row: dancing ponies. The rest are in shadow. The leading lady fits loosely in the front. Lack-life, monotonous. “One, two, three—” Music starts.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Dan	Or if you cant say that you have, then say that you will. My talking to you will make you aware of your power to do so. Say that you will love, that you will give yourself in love—” “To you, [MASK]?”
<name>Florry</name>	Florry	Dorris	Well? Now thats enough. All right. All right there, Professor? All right. One, two, three—” [MASK] swings to the front. The line of girls, four deep, blurs within the shadow of suspended scenes.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Barlo	whatever people say, the next time he comes to town. After the making of this resolution which becomes a sort of wedding cake for her to tuck beneath her pillow and go to sleep upon, she sees nothing of [MASK] for five years. Her hair thins.
<name>Godot</name>	Godot	Kabnis	Not even blank. Count. No, mustnt count Nothing .. blank .. nothing .. blank .. space without stars in it. No, nothing .. nothing.. [MASK] sleeps. The winds, like soft-voiced vagrant poets sing: White-man’s land.
<name>She</name>	She	Dan	Look at the show. I’m not stopping you.” “Shhh,” from some one in the rear. [MASK] turns around. “Its that man there who started everything. I didnt say a thing to him until he tried to start something.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Dan	The click is metallic like the sound of a bolt being shot into place. [MASK]’s eyes sting. Sinking into a soft couch, he closes them. The house contracts about him. It is a sharp-edged, massed, metallic house. Bolted.
<name>Rawlins</name>	Rawlins	Layman	Aint that, [MASK]. He aint like most northern niggers that way. Aint a thing stuck up about him. He likes us, you an me, maybe all—its that red mud over yonder—gets stuck in it an cant get out.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Dan	Nothing, as the world would have it. Living, as I look at things. Living as much as I can without—” “But you cant live without money, [MASK]. Why dont you get a good job and settle down?”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Kabnis	His arms crumple. His upper lip, his mustache, quiver. Rap! rap, on the door. The sounds slap [MASK]. They bring a hectic color to his cheeks. Like huge cold finger tips they touch his skin and goose-flesh it.
<name>Blanche</name>	Blanche	Dorris	And give me kids, and a home, and everything? (I’d like to make your nest, and honest, hon, I wouldnt run out on you.) You will if I make you. Just watch me. [MASK] dances.
<name>Corley</name>	Corley	Bona	He suddenly feels stifled, and wonders why in hell the ring of silly gaping faces that’s caked about him doesnt make way and give him air. He has a swift illusion that it is himself who has been struck. He looks at [MASK]. Whir.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Lewis	He’s satisfied. Do I look like him? When I’m dead I dont expect t be satisfied. Is that enough f y, with your godam nosin, or do you want more? Well, y wont get it, understand? [MASK]:
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Layman	The stone, the crumpled paper are things, huge things that weight them. Their thoughts are vaguely concerned with the texture of the stone, with the color of the paper. Then they remember the words, and begin to shift them about in sentences. [MASK] even construes them grammatically.
<name>Alfred</name>	Alfred	John	Then they start throbbing to a subtle syncopation. And the space-dark air grows softly luminous. [MASK] is the manager’s brother. He is seated at the center of the theater, just before rehearsal. Light streaks down upon him from a window high above.
<name>black folks</name>	black folks	Fern	That the sexes were made to mate is the practice of the South. Particularly, black folks were made to mate. And it is black folks whom I have been talking about thus far. What white men thought of [MASK] I can arrive at only by analogy.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sinner	[MASK]! Come out that fact’ry door. 2 Up from the deep dusk of a cleared spot on the edge of the forest a mellow glow arose and spread fan-wise into the low-hanging heavens. And all around the air was heavy with the scent of boiling cane.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Bona	The dance of his blue-trousered limbs thrills her. [MASK]: He is a candle that dances in a grove swung with pale balloons. Columns of the drillers thud towards her. He is in the front row. He is in no row at all.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Ned	I just stood there like the others, and something like a fuse burned up inside of me. She never noticed us, but swung along lazy and easy as anything. We sauntered to the corner and watched her till her door banged to. [MASK] repeated what he’d said.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Barlo	Her voice sounds like a frightened child’s that calls homeward from some point miles away. “Me?” “Yes, you [MASK].” “This aint th place fer y. This aint th place fer y.” “I know. I know.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Ned	This night she stayed longer than usual and gave us a chance to complete the plans of how we were going to stone and beat that feller on the top floor out of town. [MASK] especially had it in for him.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Halsey	[MASK], wonderfully himself in his work overalls, stands in the doorway and gazes up the street, expectantly. Then his eyes grow listless. He slouches against the smooth-rubbed frame. He lights a cigarette. Shifts his position. Braces an arm against the door.
<name>Delilah</name>	Delilah	Karintha	She who carries beauty, perfect as dusk when the sun goes down. She has been married many times. Old men remind her that a few years back they rode her hobby-horse upon their knees. [MASK] smiles, and indulges them when she is in the mood for it.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	These aint th days of hounds an Uncle [MASK]’s Cabin, feller. White folks aint in fer all them theatrics these days. Theys more direct than that. If what they wanted was t get y, theyd have just marched right in an took y where y sat.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Muriel	Pale purple shadows rest on the planes of her cheeks. Deep purple comes from her thick-shocked hair. Orange of the dress goes well with these. [MASK] presses her coat down from around her shoulders. Teachers are not supposed to have bobbed hair.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Carrie	Some one is coming down the stairs. [MASK], bringing food for the old man. She is lovely in her fresh energy of the morning, in the calm untested confidence and nascent maternity which rise from the purpose of her present mission.
<name>Algie</name>	Algie	Paul	He is like the electric light which he snaps on. “Whatdoysay, [MASK]? Get a wiggle on. Come on. We havent got much time by the time we eat and dress and everything.” His bustling concentrates on the brushing of his hair.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Esther	[MASK] makes believe that they really are aflame. The town fire department rushes madly down the road. It ruthlessly shoves black and white idlers to one side. It whoops. It clangs. It rescues from the second-story window a dimpled infant which she claims for her own.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Halsey	Said he reckoned he could get it t y after he ate. [MASK] chucks a half-eaten sandwich in the fire. Gets up. Arranges his blocks. Goes to the door and looks anxiously up the street. The wind whirls a small spiral in the gray dust road.
<name>Bloom</name>	Bloom	Dorris	[MASK]: I bet he can love. Hell, he cant love. He’s too skinny. His lips are too skinny. He wouldnt love me anyway, only for that. But I’d get a pair of silk stockings out of it.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Helen	Tall, not puffy and pretty, more serious and deep—the kind you like these days. And they say she’s got a car. And say, she’s on fire. But you know all about that. She got [MASK] to fix it up with me.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Dan	He grins. [MASK]: Those silly women arguing feminism. Here’s what I should have said to them. “It should be clear to you women, that the proposition must be stated thus: Me, horizontally above her. Action: perfect strokes downward oblique.
<name>Josephine</name>	Josephine	Esther	_Twenty-two._ [MASK]’s schooling is over. She works behind the counter of her father’s grocery store. “To keep the money in the family,” so he said. She is learning to make distinctions between the business and the social worlds.
<name>Yank</name>	Yank	Dan	He holds the mirror in such a way that it flashes in the face of each one he sings to. The light swings around. [MASK]: I am going to reach up and grab the girders of this building and pull them down. The crash will be a signal.
<name>Sula</name>	Sula	Kabnis	cradle will fall.. Teat moon-children at your breasts, down will come baby.. Black mother. [MASK] whirls the chicken by its neck, and throws the head away. Picks up the hopping body, warm, sticky, and hides it in a clump of bushes.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Dan	Whats that got to do with it?” “Oh, [MASK], youre so unconsiderate and selfish. All you think of is yourself.” “I think of you.” “Too much—I mean, you ought to work more and think less.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Dan	Cut lips. Bloody noses. The referee asks for the gong. Time! The house roars. The dwarfs bow, are made to bow. The house wants more. The dwarfs are led from the stage. [MASK]: Strange I never really noticed him before.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Lewis	Y misapprehended me. Y understand what that means, dont y? All right then, y misapprehended me. I didnt say preachers. I said orators. O R A T O R S. Born one an I’ll die one. You understand me, [MASK].
<name>Phil</name>	Phil	Halsey	[MASK]: Well, son, seeing that I’m th kind-hearted father, I’ll give y chance t open your eyes. But up y get when I come down. He mounts the steps to the work-shop and starts a fire in the hearth.
<name>Jefferson</name>	Jefferson	Ramsay	Through [MASK], the whole white South weighs down upon him. The pressure is terrific. He sweats under the arms. Chill beads run down his body. His brows concentrate upon the handle as though his own life was staked upon the perfect shaving of it.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Bane	This fussing with her clothes aroused her. Her eyes were weak and pitiable for so strong a woman. Slowly, then like a flash, [MASK] came to know that the shot she fired, with averted head, was aimed to whistle like a dying hornet through the cane.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Ned	We danced. But though I held her tightly in my arms, she was way away. That college feller who lived on the top floor was somewhere making money for the next year. I imagined that she was thinking, wishing for him. [MASK] was along.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Kabnis	[MASK]’ thin hair is streaked on the pillow. His hand strokes the slim silk of his mustache. His thumb, pressed under his chin, seems to be trying to give squareness and projection to it. Brown eyes stare from a lemon face.
<name>Zeke</name>	Zeke	Tom	They swarmed. A large man with dead-white face and flabby cheeks came to him and almost jabbed a gun-barrel through his guts. “Hands behind y, nigger.” [MASK]’s wrist were bound. The big man shoved him to the well.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Brother	Life is a murky, wiggling, microscopic water that compresses him. Compresses his helmet and would crush it the minute that he pulled his head out. He has to keep it in. Life is water that is being drawn off. [MASK], life is water that is being drawn off.
<name>Sutpen</name>	Sutpen	Tom	Straddled him. “Get off me, you godam nigger you.” “Yo sho has started somethin now. Get up.” [MASK] yanked him up and began hammering at him. Each blow sounded as if it smashed into a precious, irreplaceable soft something.
<name>Silla</name>	Silla	Louisa	The full moon in the great door was an omen. Negro women improvised songs against its spell. [MASK] sang as she came over the crest of the hill from the white folks’ kitchen. Her skin was the color of oak leaves on young trees in fall.
<name>Art</name>	Art	Paul	Get a wiggle on. Come on. We havent got much time by the time we eat and dress and everything.” His bustling concentrates on the brushing of his hair. Art: What in hell’s getting into [MASK] of late, anyway?
<name>Reverend</name>	Reverend	Layman	The preacher momentarily stops. The choir, together with the entire congregation, sings an old spiritual. The music seems to quiet the shouter. Her heavy breathing has the sound of evening winds that blow through pinecones. [MASK]’s voice is uniformly low and soothing.
<name>Alonzo</name>	Alonzo	Lewis	[MASK] dont know it all, an I’m atellin y. Ugh. Th form thats burned int my soul is some twisted awful thing that crept in from a dream, a godam nightmare, an wont stay still unless I feed it.
<name>Buford</name>	Buford	Kabnis	Then flies and flops around trying to elude him. [MASK] catches her. “Got you now, you she-bitch.” With his fingers about her neck, he thrusts open the outside door and steps out into the serene loveliness of Georgian autumn moonlight.
<name>Leslie</name>	Leslie	Ned	[MASK] knew, of course. There was nothing he didnt know when it came to women. He dilated on the emotional needs of girls. Said they werent much different from men in that respect. And concluded with the solemn avowal: “It does em good.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Ralph	Come now, [MASK], go in and make yourself go to sleep. Come now .. in the door .. thats right. Put the poker down. There. All right. Slip under the sheets. Close your eyes. Think nothing .. a long time ..
<name>Yankel</name>	Yankel	Dan	He places his palms upon the earth to cool them. Earth throbs. [MASK]’s heart beats violently. He sees all the people in the house rush to the walls to listen to the rumble. A new-world Christ is coming up.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Dorris	A crap game in the alley suddenly ends. Black faces crowd the rear stage doors. The girls, catching joy from [MASK], whip up within the footlights’ glow. They forget set steps; they find their own. The director forgets to bawl them out.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Beauty	Prop me in your brass box seat. I’m there, am I not? because of you. He-slave. Slave of a woman who is a slave. I’m a damned sight worse than you are. I sing your praises, [MASK]!
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Bob	Each blow sounded as if it smashed into a precious, irreplaceable soft something. Beneath them, [MASK] staggered back. He reached in his pocket and whipped out a knife. “Thats my game, sho.”
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Dan	She’ll be right down. You’ll pardon me, wont you? So glad to see you.” Her eyes are weak. They are bluish and watery from reading newspapers. The blue is steel. It gimlets [MASK] while her mouth flaps amiably to him.
<name>Connell</name>	Connell	Tom	He couldnt move. And then he saw the search-lights of the two cars glaring down on him. A quick shock went through him. He stiffened. He started to run. A yell went up from the mob. [MASK] wheeled about and faced them.
<name>McAlmon</name>	McAlmon	McGregor	She sees him at a distance, the center of a group of credulous men. She hears the deep-bass rumble of his talk. The sun swings low. [MASK]’s windows are aflame again. Pale flame. A sharply dressed white girl passes by.
<name>Jase</name>	Jase	Halsey	Theys more direct than that. If what they wanted was t get y, theyd have just marched right in an took y where y sat. Somebodys down by th branch chasin rabbits an atreein possums. A shot is heard. [MASK]: Got him, I reckon.
<name>Corbett</name>	Corbett	Halsey	He sets them on the floor, a safe distance from the beds. [MASK]: No foolin now. Come. Up with you. Other than a soft rustling, there is no sound as the girls slip into their clothes.
<name>Lavinia</name>	Lavinia	Louisa	Silk stockings an purple dresses—course I dont believe what some folks been whisperin as t how y gets them things now. White folks always did do for niggers what they likes. An they jes cant help alikin yo, [MASK].
<name>He</name>	He	Dan	His mind curves back into himself, and picks up tail-ends of experiences. His eyes are open, mechanically. The dwarfs pound and bruise and bleed each other, on his eyeballs. [MASK]: Ah, but she was some baby! And not vulgar either.
<name>Yasha</name>	Yasha	Cora	He pricks his ears, intuitively feels that the talk is about him, leaves [MASK], and approaches the table. His eyes are watery, heavy with passion. He stoops. He is a ridiculous pathetic figure in his showy robe.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Halsey	Gets up. Arranges his blocks. Goes to the door and looks anxiously up the street. The wind whirls a small spiral in the gray dust road. [MASK]: Why didnt y tell me sooner, little sister?
<name>Zora</name>	Zora	Lord	Her song is a spark that travels swiftly to the near-by cabins. Like purple tallow flames, songs jet up. They spread a ruddy haze over the heavens. The haze swings low. Now the whole countryside is a soft chorus. [MASK].
<name>Boyle</name>	Boyle	Halsey	[MASK]: Well, well. Whats up? Aint you ever comin? Come on. Whats up down there? Take you all mornin t sleep off a pint? Youre weakenin, man, youre weakenin.
<name>Captain</name>	Captain	Tom	A great flare muffled in black smoke shot upward. The mob yelled. The mob was silent. Now [MASK] could be seen within the flames. Only his head, erect, lean, like a blackened stone. Stench of burning flesh soaked the air.
<name>Rosa</name>	Rosa	Stella	She is a tall, thin, mulatto woman. Her eyes are deep-set behind a pointed nose. Her hair is coarse and bushy. Seeing that [MASK] also is restless, she takes her arm and the two women move towards the table. They slip into chairs.
<name>Smithers</name>	Smithers	Halsey	[MASK]! Gone an left me. Just like a nigger. I thought he was a nigger all th time. Now I know it. Ditch y when it comes right down t it. Damn him anyway. Godam him. (He looks and re-sees the old man.)
<name>Jed</name>	Jed	Barlo	People are hushed. One can hear weevils work. Dusk is falling rapidly, and the customary store lights fail to throw their feeble glow across the gray dust and flagging of the Georgia town. [MASK] rises to his full height. He is immense.
<name>Sutpen</name>	Sutpen	Barlo	[MASK] is before her. “Well, I’m sholy damned—skuse me, but what, what brought you here, lil milk-white gal?” “You.” Her voice sounds like a frightened child’s that calls homeward from some point miles away.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Halsey	They put y out of church, an then I guess th preacher came around an asked f some. But thats your body. Now me— [MASK] (passing him the bottle): All right, kid, we believe y. Here, take another.
<name>Bessie</name>	Bessie	John	Songs soak the walls and seep out to the nigger life of alleys and near-beer saloons, of the Poodle Dog and Black Bear cabarets. Afternoons, the house is dark, and the walls are sleeping singers until rehearsal begins. Or until [MASK] comes within them.
<name>Antonio</name>	Antonio	Dan	He sees all the people in the house rush to the walls to listen to the rumble. A new-world Christ is coming up. [MASK] comes up. He is startled. The eyes of the woman dont belong to her. They look at him unpleasanfly.
<name>Blue</name>	Blue	Kabnis	It becomes intolerable. He forces himself to narrow to a cabin silhouetted on a knoll about a mile away. Peace. Negroes within it are content. They farm. They sing. They love. They sleep. [MASK] wonders if perhaps they can feel him.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Kabnis	[MASK], against his will, lets his book slip down, and listens to them. The warm whiteness of his bed, the lamp-light, do not protect him from the weird chill of their song: White-man’s land. Niggers, sing.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Avey	As he went away, I began to visualize certain possibilities. An immediate and urgent passion swept over me. Then I looked at [MASK]. Her heavy eyes were closed. Her breathing was as faint and regular as a child’s in slumber. My passion died.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	John	Her? Which? (O dance!) I’d like to... Girls dance and sing. Men clap. The walls sing and press inward. They press the men and girls, they press [MASK] towards a center of physical ecstasy.
<name>Jacob</name>	Jacob	Halsey	Several large wooden blocks, chipped and cut and sawed on their upper surfaces are in the middle of the floor. They are the supports used in almost any sort of wagon-work. Their idleness means that [MASK] has no worth-while job on foot.
<name>There</name>	There	Damit	They rationalize their fear, and call their cowardice science. Fine bunch, they are. [MASK], that was a noise. And not the wind either. A chicken maybe. Hell, chickens dont wander around this time of night. What in hell is it?
<name>the father</name>	the father	Fred	The mother, practically white. Of the children, the girl, quite young, is like [MASK]; the two brothers, darker. The walls of the room are plastered and painted green. An old upright piano is tucked into the corner near the window.
<name>Ise</name>	Ise	Godam	Ise already cut two niggers. Had t hon, t tell em so. Niggers always tryin t make somethin out a nothin. An then besides, white folks aint up t them tricks so much nowadays. [MASK] better not be. Leastawise not with yo.
<name>John</name>	John	Kabnis	She passes the window. Her red girl’s-cap, catching the sun, flashes vividly. With a stiff, awkward little movement she crosses the door-sill and gives [MASK] one of the two baskets which she is carrying. There is a slight stoop to her shoulders.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Halsey	An I’m atellin y. A shriveled, bony white man passes the window and enters the shop. He carries a broken hatchet-handle and the severed head. He speaks with a flat, drawn voice to [MASK], who comes forward to meet him.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Dan	Might think that he is trying to sneak, to break in. [MASK]: Break in. Get an ax and smash in. Smash in their faces. I’ll show em. Break into an engine-house, steal a thousand horse-power fire truck.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Berny	Seated thus, her eyes are level with, and near to, the face of an imaginary man upon the stage. To speak to [MASK] she must turn. When she does, the audience is square upon her.
<name>Wells</name>	Wells	Dan	That rumble comes from the earth’s deep core. It is the mutter of powerful underground races. [MASK] has a picture of all the people rushing to put their ears against walls, to listen to it. The next world-savior is coming up that way.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Avey	I always think of them as crude music from the soul of [MASK]. We sat there holding hands. Our palms were soft and warm against each other. Our fingers were not tight. She would not let them be. She would not let me twist them.
<name>He</name>	He	Dan	[MASK] turns into a side-street, opens an iron gate, bangs it to. Mounts the steps, and searches for the bell. Funny, he cant find it. He fumbles around. The thought comes to him that some one passing by might see him, and not understand.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Kabnis	It is dull silver in the moonlight. White child that sleeps upon the top of pines. [MASK]’ mind clears. He sees himself yanked beneath that tower. He sees white minds, with indolent assumption, juggle justice and a nigger...
<name>Mildred</name>	Mildred	Bona	Out-jumps her, makes a quick pass, gets a quick return, and shoots a goal from the middle of the floor. [MASK] burns crimson. She fights, and tries to guard him. One of her team-mates advises her not to play so hard.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Dan	You could make it let me if you would. Why wont you? Youre selfish. I’m not strong enough to buck it. Youre too selfish to buck it, for me. I wish you’d go. You irritate me. [MASK], please go.
<name>Mrs. Kearney</name>	Mrs. Kearney	Muriel	[MASK] comes in, shakes hands, and then clicks into a high-armed seat under the orange glow of a floor-lamp. Her face is fleshy. It would tend to coarseness but for the fresh fragrant something which is the life of it.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Dan	The man shoves him. “Watch where youre going, mister. Crazy or no, you aint going to walk over me. Watch where youre going there.” [MASK] turns, and serenely tweaks the fellow’s nose. The man jumps up.
<name>coon</name>	coon	Susie	A white man took m mother an it broke th old man’s heart. He died; an then I didnt care what become of me, an I dont now. I dont care now. Dont get it in y head I’m some sentimental [MASK] askin for yo sop.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Kabnis	I couldnt stand em messin an pawin over m business like I was a child. So I cussed em out an left. [MASK] there ought t have cussed out th old duck over yonder an left. He’d a been a better man tday.
