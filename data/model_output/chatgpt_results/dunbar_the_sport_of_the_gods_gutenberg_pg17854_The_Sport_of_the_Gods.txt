<name>Bessie</name>	Bessie	Fannie	"Ag'in!" She hung her head: "Yes." He gripped himself hard. "Why cain't you come on off wid me, [MASK]? You was mine fus'." "I could n't. He would fin' me anywhaih I went to."
<name>Mrs. Phelps</name>	Mrs. Phelps	Joe	The encouragement helped her, and she did better as she became more at home. "Why, child, you 've got a good voice. And, [MASK], you 've been keeping her shut up all this time. You ought to be ashamed of yourself."
<name>Raffles</name>	Raffles	Frank	[MASK] gave a scarcely perceptible start. "I do so hate such things," he said; "and, anyway, what 's the use? They 'll never find out where the stuff went to." "Oh, you need not be troubled in this matter.
<name>Fagin</name>	Fagin	Barney	It 's dangerous when you 're not used to it; but once you go through the parching process, you become inoculated against further contagion. Now, there 's [MASK] over there, as decent a fellow as I know; but he has been indicted twice for pocket-picking.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Minty	Let by-gones be by-gones. You know I ain't the kin' o' person that holds a grudge ag'in anybody." "That 's right, [MASK], that 's right," he said, and gave her his mother's address.
<name>Dick</name>	Dick	Joe	"Come on," he said, rising. "Oh, she did n't ask for me," cried [MASK], tremulous and eager. His companion went away laughing. "Who 's your young friend?"
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Joe	"And you still keep on speaking to me?" "Now look here, [MASK], if you 've been drinking, I 'll forgive you; if you ain't, you go on and leave me. Say, what do you take me for?
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Maurice	I should feel the sting of all this much less if the thief had come from the outside, broken in, and robbed me, but this, after all these years, is too low." "Don't be hard on a man, [MASK]; one never knows what prompts him to a deed.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Hattie	Why, old chap, I believe I like you better for the stiff upper lip you 've been keeping under all this." "Why, [MASK]," he broke out, unable any longer to control himself, "you 're--you 're----" "
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Fannie	As soon as the trial was over, he sent for [MASK], who still kept the cottage in the yard. "You must go," he said. "You can't stay here any longer. I want none of your breed about me."
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Joe	Your case is n't half as bad as that of nine-tenths of the fellows that hang around here. Now, for instance, my father was hung." [MASK] started and gave a gasp of horror. "
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jack	"I saw him," he said with a shudder, "and it 'll take more whiskey than [MASK] can give me in a year to wash the memory of him out of me. Why, man, it shocked me all through.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Joe	"You lie," he cried, "I have n't; I was only fool enough to try;" and he turned hastily away from the table. [MASK] looked surprised at first, and then laughed at his friend's retreating form. "
<name>Donalbain</name>	Donalbain	Maurice	Their love for him made them read large between the lines, and all they read was good. Between [MASK] and his brother no word of the guilty servant ever passed. They each avoided it as an unpleasant subject.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Kit	"Oh, I would n't want to push anybody out," [MASK] expostulated. "Oh, never mind, you 'll soon get bravely over that feeling, and even if you did n't it would n't matter much. The thing has to happen.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Fannie	"Oh, I did n't say dat; I did n't mean dat." "That will do, [MASK]. I understand perfectly. You should have confessed that long ago." "But I ain't confessin'! I ain't! He did n't----"
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Francis	Some of these thoughts were in the minds of the brother and sister now. "Five years does seem a long while," [MASK] was saying, "but if a man accomplishes anything, after all, it seems only a short time to look back upon."
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Kit	I would n't min' dat, [MASK], but he say dat at Be'y's age dey ain't much chanst of his livin' to git out, an' hyeah I 'll live all dis time alone, an' den have no one to tek keer
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Joe	Then, while an instrumentalist, who seemed to have a grudge against the piano, was hammering out the opening bars of a march, [MASK]'s attention was attracted by a woman entering the room, and from that moment he heard no more of the concert.
<name>she</name>	she	Leslie	The letter drew his eyes back to it. It seemed to invite him, to beg him even. "No, I will not do it; I will wait until [MASK] comes. She will be as glad to hear the good news as I am."
<name>her</name>	her	Kitty	She had somewhat receded from her first position, that it was better being here in the great strange city than being at home where the very streets shamed them. She had not liked the way that their fellow lodger looked at [MASK]. It was bold, to say the least.
<name>God</name>	God	Gawd	No pen'tentiay kin tek you erway f'om me. Hit 's enough what dey 've done to my chillen." He rushed forward and seized her by the arm. "Dey sha'n't do no mo', by [MASK]! dey sha'n't, I say!"
<name>he</name>	he	Joe	She looked at it with the fascination that one always experiences for what either brings near or withholds the unknown. As for [MASK], he was not bothered by the mystery or the glamour of things. But he had suddenly raised himself in his own estimation.
<name>The Yellow Press</name>	The Yellow Press	Skaggs	It never lost an opportunity to crow, and if one was not forthcoming, it made one. In this way it managed to do a considerable amount of good, and its yellowness became forgivable, even commendable. In [MASK]'s story the editor saw an opportunity for one of its periodical philanthropies.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Be'y	You 'll be wid me, an' we 'll settle it, him an' me." "I want to, but oh, I can't, I can't," she wailed. "Please go now, [MASK], befo' he gits home.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Frank	And this evidence is all circumstantial." "It is plain enough for me. You are entirely too kind-hearted, [MASK]. But I see that this thing has worn you out. You must not stand here talking.
<name>Hamilton</name>	Hamilton	Frank	and your butler is, I believe, the Hamilton whom the young gentleman mentioned some time ago." "Yes." [MASK]'s face was really very white now. The detective nodded again. "I think I have a clue," he said simply.
<name>me</name>	me	Berry	So I lied to you. The money from my cabinet was not stolen save by myself. I am a liar and a thief, but your eyes shall never tell me so. "Tell the truth and have [MASK] released. I can stand it.
<name>Mammy</name>	Mammy	nevah	"Don't you cuss hyeah befo' me; I ain't [MASK] brung you up to it, an' I won't stan' it. Go to dem whaih you larned it, an whaih de wo'ds soun' sweet."
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Berry	[MASK] started forward with a cry, "My Gawd! my Gawd! my little gal! my boy!" "Dat ain't all," she went on dully, as if reciting a rote lesson; "I ain't yo' wife no mo'.
<name>Mr. Cunningham</name>	Mr. Cunningham	Davis	The negroes----" "Total depravity," said [MASK]. "Now look at my dog----" "If you will retire with me to the further table I will give you whatever of the facts I can call to mind."
<name>Marley</name>	Marley	Maurice	[MASK]!" He lay on the floor staring up at the ceiling, the letter clutched in his hands. She ran to him and lifted up his head, but he gave no sign of life. Already the servants were crowding to the door.
<name>his sister</name>	his sister	Kitty	He had brought [MASK] almost under a protest, because he had no confidence in her ability and thought that his "girl" would disillusion her. It did not please him now to find his sister so fully under the limelight and himself "up stage."
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Joe	But [MASK], he 's gone, an' ef yo go, befo' Gawd I 'll tell Tawm Gibson yes." The mother looked up to see just what effect her plea would have on her daughter. She hoped that what she said would have the desired result.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Oakley	damn you! ef dat 's all dese yeahs counted fu', I wish I had a-stoled it." [MASK] made a step forward, and his man did likewise, but the officer stepped between them.
<name>The Thief</name>	The Thief	Skaggs	"But his breast is open. Your hand has been in his bosom. You have taken something from him. Give it to me, or I shall call for help." [MASK] had not reckoned on this, but his wits came to the rescue.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Maurice----	"It must not be burned. What! burn my brother's secret? No, no, I must carry it with me,--carry it with me to the grave." "But, [MASK]" "I must carry it with me."
<name>Cassie</name>	Cassie	Joe	"It ain't goin' to do no good to look at it that a-way, [MASK]," his mother replied. "I know hit 's ha'd, but we got to do de bes' we kin."
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Kit	He felt like a cur, because he knew deep down in his heart that he had only been waiting for some excuse to take this step. As he slammed the door behind him, his mother flung herself down by [MASK]'s side and mingled her tears with her daughter's.
<name>Lucie</name>	Lucie	Fannie	I 've got some tea made for you, and you just take a cup." [MASK] sat down and tried to drink her tea, but she could not. It stuck in her throat, and the tears rolled down her face and fell into the shaking cup.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Francis	"What is it, [MASK]?" he questioned, hurrying to him. "I have just discovered a considerable loss," was the reply in a grieved voice. "If it is no worse than loss, I am glad; but what is it?"
<name>Mrs. Compson</name>	Mrs. Compson	Fannie	[MASK] looked at her son, and she seemed to see him more clearly than she had ever seen him before,--his foppery, his meanness, his cowardice. "Well," she answered with a sigh, "it can't be no wuss den what 's already happened."
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Fannie	"Why, mos'ly it was too small, an' so I des' kep' it in a ol' sock. I tol' [MASK] dat some day ef de bank did n't bus' wid all de res' I had, I 'd put it in too.
<name>Hercule</name>	Hercule	Maurice	"But pardon me for boring you. I know you want to go to bed. Go and leave everything to me." The young man reluctantly withdrew, and [MASK] went to the telephone and rung up the police station.
<name>Red</name>	Red	Skaggs	"They 're all right," was the reply. [MASK] could n't tell him, in this the first hour of his freedom. Let him have time to drink the sweetness of that all in. There would be time afterwards to taste all of the bitterness.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sadness	At its close he relapsed into stupidity, murmuring, "She throwed me down." "Well," sneered [MASK], "you see drunken men tell the truth, and you don't seem to get much guilt out of our young friend.
<name>Uncle Henry</name>	Uncle Henry	Martin	laughed [MASK], "haw, haw, haw! The little one was scared, see? She was scared, d' you understand? But did you see the grit she went at it with? Just took the bit in her teeth and got away.
<name>Biff</name>	Biff	Joe	So the little family was shut in upon itself away from fellowship and sympathy. [MASK] went seldom to see his father. He was not heartless; but the citadel of his long desired and much vaunted manhood trembled before the sight of his father's abject misery.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Berry	There were times when she felt that there was nothing left to work or fight for. The letters from [MASK] in prison became fewer and fewer. He was sinking into the dull, dead routine of his life. Her own letters to him fell off.
<name>he</name>	he	Berry	The news the papers held had not escaped her, but she had suffered in silence, hoping that [MASK] might be spared the pain of finding her. Now he stood before her, and she knew him at a glance, in spite of his haggard countenance.
<name>Macbeth</name>	Macbeth	Sadness	Poor old fellow," he said, "drunk again. Must have had something before he came in." There was not a lie in all that [MASK] had said either as to their crime or their condition.
<name>fourteen</name>	fourteen	Joe	" There was a patter of applause, and a young negro came forward, and in a strident, music-hall voice, sung or rather recited with many gestures the ditty. He could n't have been much older than [MASK], but already his face was hard with dissipation and foul knowledge.
<name>she</name>	she	Fannie	He laughed hoarsely. It sounded like nothing [MASK] had ever heard before. "Don't, Be'y, don't say dat. Maybe we don't un'erstan'." Her faith still hung by a slender thread, but his had given way in that moment.
<name>the butler</name>	the butler	Frank	The detective nodded again. "I think I have a clue," he said simply. "I will be here again to-morrow morning." "But I shall be gone," said [MASK]. "You will hardly be needed, anyway."
<name>Heaven</name>	Heaven	Jove	At night I put him in that nigger's care to feed and bed. Well, do you know, I came home the other night and found that black rascal gone? I went out to see if the dog was properly bedded, and by [MASK], the dog was gone too.
<name>Mr. Oakley</name>	Mr. Oakley	Hamilton	They fell asleep, he with thoughts of anger and revenge, and she grieved and disappointed. IV FROM A CLEAR SKY The inmates of the Oakley house had not been long in their beds before [MASK] was out of his and rousing his own little household.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Skaggs	"Ah, yes, perfectly right." [MASK] had got all that he wanted; much more, in fact, than he had expected. The Colonel held him for a while yet to enlarge upon the views that he had expressed.
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Frank	Without a thought of wrong, for they had no secrets from each other, she glanced at the opening lines. Then she forgot the unconscious man at her feet and read the letter through to the end. The letter was in [MASK]'s neat hand, a little shaken, perhaps, by nervousness.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Hamilton	She was horror-struck. It was hard to have to believe this awful thing of an old servant, but she agreed with him that [MASK] must be made an example of when the time came. Before that, however, he must not know that he was suspected.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Joe	[MASK] lingered a little longer. "Say, that was out o' sight," he said. "Think so?" asked the other carelessly. "I 'd like to get out with you some time to see the town," the boy went on eagerly.
<name>Silas</name>	Silas	Frank	With complacent minds both went their ways, drank their wine, and said their prayers, and wished that brother [MASK]'s five years were past. They had letters from him now and then, never very cheerful in tone, but always breathing the deepest love and gratitude to them.
<name>the author</name>	the author	Leslie	The second line held him, and the third, and the fourth, and as he read on, unmindful now of what [MASK] might think or feel, his face turned from the ruddy glow of pleasant anxiety to the pallor of grief and terror.
<name>George</name>	George	Leslie	His face did not change until, with a wealth of fervent congratulations, he had bade the last guest good-bye. Then he turned to his brother. "When [MASK] is in bed, come into the library.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Joe	Kit an' [MASK] lef' me, an' dey said de pen'tentiary divo'ced you an' me, an' dat you 'd nevah come out nohow. Don't look at me lak dat, Be'y." "You ain't my wife no mo'?
<name>Dinah</name>	Dinah	Kitty	Now, that 's what I like. If all you girls had that spirit, we could do something in two weeks. Try another one, girl." [MASK]'s heart had suddenly grown light. She sang the second one better because something within her was singing.
<name>her</name>	her	Minty	At the very thought his hand trembled, and the man in the chair asked him if he had n't been drinking. When he met [MASK] in the evening, however, the first glance at her reassured him. Her face was wreathed in smiles as she came forward and held out her hand.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Joe	"Say," she said, "if you come this way for me again, it 's all over, see? Your little sister 's a comer, and I 've got to hustle to keep up with her." [MASK] growled and fell asleep in his chair.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Joe	Upon [MASK]'s advent they began to look askance at him and to talk among themselves. He felt his face burning as he thought of what they must be saying. Then he saw the head bellman talking to the clerk and looking in his direction.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Kitty	"What, don't you drink beer? Oh, come now, you 'll get out o' that." "[MASK] don't drink no beer," broke in her mother with mild resentment. "I drinks it sometimes, but she don't.
<name>Gollum</name>	Gollum	Skaggs	" "No, no, no! It is not his secret; it is mine. I must carry it here always, do you hear? I must carry it till I die. Go away! Go away!" [MASK] seized him.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Kit	"I 'll go an' see what I kin do, anyway, [MASK]. 'T ain't much use, I reckon, trying to get into a bahbah shop where they shave white folks, because all the white folks are down on us.
<name>his wife</name>	his wife	Hattie	He did not work, and yet he lived and ate and was proud of his degradation. But he soon tired of being separated from [MASK], and straightened up again. After some demur she received him upon his former footing. It was only for a few months.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Kitty	This had been without success, as both the girl and her mother held themselves politely aloof from him. He began to see that his hope of winning [MASK]'s affections lay, not in courting the older woman but in making a friend of the boy.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Oakley	But as for bringing it to light, no one would think of doing that. It would be sure to hurt [MASK]'s feelings, and he is of one of our best families." "Ah, yes, perfectly right."
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Joe	He tapped one confidentially on the shoulder, as who should say, "My dear boy, I have but two friends in the world, and you are both of them." [MASK], charmed and pleased, kept his head well.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Oakley	Had he seen [MASK] before he would have been shocked at the change in his appearance; but as it was, the nervous, white-haired man who stood shiftily before him told him nothing of an eating secret long carried.
<name>Mark Twain</name>	Mark Twain	Jove	I 've often been invited to join some of the swell clubs here, but I never do it. By [MASK]! I 'd rather come down here and fellowship right in with you fellows. I like coloured people, anyway. It 's natural.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Maurice	When he came down it was not to come directly to the dining-room. He paused in the hall and despatched a servant to bring his brother to him. [MASK] found him standing weakly against the railing of the stairs. Something in his air impressed his brother strangely.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Berry	The blue smoke from the "house," where the fire was already going, whirled fantastically over the roofs like a belated ghost. It was just the morning to doze in comfort, and so thought all of [MASK]'s household except himself.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Leslie	[MASK] was careless and unfeeling. She ought to come; he was tired of waiting. A carriage rolled up the driveway and he dropped the letter guiltily, as if it were not his own. He would only say that he had grown tired of waiting and started to read it.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Oakley	There was a sound of footsteps without. He sprang up, crying, "I 've been waiting so long for you!" A servant opened the door to bring him a message. [MASK] dismissed him angrily.
<name>Basil</name>	Basil	Maurice	I want you to understand, though, is that the money is yours as well as mine, and you are always welcome to it." The artist shook his head. "No, [MASK]," he said, "I can accept no more from you.
<name>Tilly</name>	Tilly	Kitty	You got to he'p me befo' you go to any shop dis mo'nin'. You, [MASK], stir yo' stumps, miss. I know yo' ma 's a-dressin' now. Ef she ain't, I bet I 'll be aftah huh in a minute, too.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sadness	He sat brooding over his trouble until the bartender called with respectful sarcasm to ask if he wanted to lease the glass he had. He gave back a silly laugh, gulped the rest of the liquor down, and was ordering another when [MASK] came in.
<name>him</name>	him	Claire	But they could hope, and hope made them eager to open every letter that bore the French postmark. Always it might contain news that he was coming home, or that he had made a great success, or, better, some inquiry after [MASK].
<name>Tin Man</name>	Tin Man	Taylor	Are your joints rusty? Do you want oil? Look here, [MASK], if I did n't know you, I 'd take you for a truck. Pick up your feet, open your mouths, and move, move, move! Oh!"
<name>She</name>	She	Leslie	[MASK] had forfeited her right to see it as soon as he. It might be mean, but it was not dishonest. No, he would not read it now, but he would take it out and show her that he had exercised his self-control in spite of her shortcomings.
<name>Whistler</name>	Whistler	Frank	She will be as glad to hear the good news as I am." His dreams were taking the shape of reality in his mind, and he was believing all that he wanted to believe. He turned to look at a picture painted by [MASK] which hung over the mantel.
<name>Tom Robinson</name>	Tom Robinson	Berry	Poor fellow, he was too young for this forcing process, and in the hot-house of pain he only grew an acrid, unripe cynic. At the sitting of the Grand Jury [MASK] was indicted. His trial followed soon, and the town turned out to see it.
<name>Mrs. Hale</name>	Mrs. Hale	Fannie	Then he saw [MASK] come out and walk about her little garden, followed by her children. He saw her as she wiped her eyes and led the way to the side gate. "Well, they 're gone," he said to his wife.
<name>the reporter</name>	the reporter	Skaggs	"No, no!" he gasped, "no, no! I have no secret." The reporter moved nearer him. The old man shrunk against the wall, his lips working convulsively and his hand tearing at his breast as [MASK] drew nearer.
<name>Mr. Brocklehurst</name>	Mr. Brocklehurst	Martin	"Good!" said [MASK], but he immediately returned to his cold manner. "You watch these girls close and see what they do, and to-morrow be prepared to go into line and move as well as sing."
<name>MacGowan</name>	MacGowan	Joe	He had never dreamed that anything so terrible could overtake him. Even in his straits, however, desperation gave him a certain pluck. He would try for something else for which his own tongue had not disqualified him. With [MASK], to think was to do.
<name>her</name>	her	Fannie	The shock had been too sudden for him, and it was as if his reason had been for the time unseated. That it was not permanently overthrown was evidenced by his waking to the most acute pain and grief whenever [MASK] came to him.
<name>Ma Joad</name>	Ma Joad	Kitty	"Well, we got to go," she said, rising wearily. "But where are we goin'?" wailed [MASK] in affright. "There 's no place to go to. We have n't got a house. Where 'll we go?"
<name>Jekyll</name>	Jekyll	Hattie	It was very late when he reached [MASK]'s door, but he opened it with his latch-key, as he had been used to do. He stopped to help himself to a glass of brandy, as he had so often done before.
<name>the man</name>	the man	Berry	This man makes only thirty dollars a month. Don't you see?" The Colonel saw, or said he did. And he did not answer what he might have answered, that [MASK] had no rent and no board to pay.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sadness	"I reckon that was the reason she jumped on me so hard at the club." He chuckled. He had taken heart again. All that [MASK] had said was true, after all, and people thought no less of him. His joy was unbounded.
<name>Miss Polly</name>	Miss Polly	Oakley	In all their lives they had known no home save the little cottage in [MASK]'s yard. Here they had toddled as babies and played as children and been happy and care-free. There had been times when they had complained and wanted a home off by themselves, like others whom they knew.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Leslie	He laid it on the desk once more. It leered at him. He might just open the sheets enough to see the lines that began it, and read no further. Yes, he would do that. [MASK] could not feel hurt at such a little thing.
