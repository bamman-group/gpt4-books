<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Gholson	Cash? [MASK] put his hand in his pocket, then took it out again. He said, lying obviously, Left my purse in my quarters. I hain’t got no cash to pay you. Speak up. Please, sir, just a little something to eat.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Smith	Don’t think I’ve seen you since graduation, twenty years ago. Pleased to find you doing such outstanding work. . . . [MASK] looked at him earnestly. Thank you, sir. It’s good to see you again, but I’m sorry to find you on crutches.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Pray	I judge there must be none any longer within the confines of the prison pen itself, since it must be in an increasingly trampled condition. Now it is past midnight, and the spirit weakens along with the flare of this inadequate lamp. [MASK] think of me kindly.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Lucy	That was one kindness in a life grown dank otherwise. [MASK] whispered, Question Forty-two. Ah, in the Shorter Catechism? You learned it all so well. You were a good child, you’ve always been a good child.
<name>Eeyore</name>	Eeyore	Tomas	I thought you planned to borrow a mule if— But, you see, then I should feel that [MASK] was mine. He’s a splendid donkey, young enough not to tire, but splendidly disciplined. Nor does he bite or kick.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Lawrence	Got four beauties hid underneath that trash there. They belonged to my comrade, fellow name of [MASK], also from the Eighth Cavalry. He died this month and I was his sole heir. How many have died this month? Close to seven hundred by actual count.
<name>Romeo</name>	Romeo	Katty	It was late—far too dark to lure [MASK] from her family circle by this time. They would say that it was dark, her family would not permit her to walk down the road with him; that much was certain.
<name>Tess</name>	Tess	Laurel	The girl—[MASK]—was going to have a baby. Her mother discovered this when some time had elapsed since the girl asked for— These are womanly matters. But for—cloths. Well, the widow undertook to interrupt the pregnancy; she employed a wooden knitting needle, of all things.
<name>Black Dog</name>	Black Dog	Wirz	It was one of the ancient pieces altered for percussion. His act, as well as the hullabaloo within the stockade, told [MASK] what had happened. He screamed beyond the wall. If that damn bitch cripple is again in the deadline— Shoot him!
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Chickamauga	If [MASK] mentioned it now, it would come as an assertion of guilt to all ears listening nearby. Because—there’s bad men here. They beat me last night. Captain, they beat me! I didn’t do nothing bad.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Coral	His spectacles were opaque, frightening as he looked down at the girl. In a most intimate way, Madam. He had not addressed her in such fashion since the long ago day of his first arrival. [MASK] was of much more help than his mother.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Wirz	[MASK]’s glance flicked toward the window, back to the officer’s face. He lifted his left hand to tug at the beard around his lips. Mein arms, they hang in the entry yonder. Also a pepperbox revolver I got.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Strieker	He blubbered between his bites. This here canteen’s got milk in it. The Yankee wailed in disbelief. Milk? I hain’t a-storying you. [MASK] tried to remove the cap from the canteen with his one hand.
<name>Lolita</name>	Lolita	Willie	and a strange tiny bird of purplish blue beyond, the shyest of the shy, and making soft his song before they alarmed him with their coming. [MASK]. Worshipping whisper, the quiet curls and peachy skin and smell of her so close ... his breath clogged in his chest.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Cherry	[MASK] wore a cap which would drop down on most other people’s ears. He had a mane of hair black as a crow’s back at midnight in the dark of the moon, and thick rounded eyebrows of the same material.
<name>Abraham</name>	Abraham	Solomon	Should I want him to starve as I starved when I was a little girl, when my own father could not get work in the cafes? Should I want him to tramp the roads with a peddler’s pack on his back, as dear [MASK] did when he was of the same age?
<name>God</name>	God	Ira	What you doing on the floor? Son of a bitch hit me. Why, Mister, said the taller man. His hair clung matted, straggling under his shapeless colorless hat, dirty silver at the temples. He must be nearly as old as [MASK].
<name>Benjamin</name>	Benjamin	Chickamauga	Big dish, Lieutenant? A can full will do. In the background [MASK] jiggled on his crutch, eyes swelling out as he thought of hot peas. There was a degree of shelter beside the outer gate, for rain was driving from the west.
<name>Uncle Andrew</name>	Uncle Andrew	Badger	The beetles had been discovered atop a huge wardrobe in the boy’s old room; wenches never dusted that surface—it was beyond their reach—and apparently the collection had been forgotten by [MASK] when he went away to college and later to the army.
<name>Mrs. Hall</name>	Mrs. Hall	Naomi	As the people calmed he ordered [MASK] to fetch cakes all round; she had baked a batch on Saturday, using substitutes for this and that, but the cakes were delicious and tasted of caraway and ground sunflower seeds.
<name>Long John Silver</name>	Long John Silver	Coral	It occurred to him that if he carried a heavy club, and crept up silently on a covey of quail without disturbance, he might be able to get a bird for himself by flinging the club, much as [MASK] was forever hurling his crutch.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Eric	[MASK] had instructed the boys to put him down somewhere near the farther end of a section of twenty-five—say number twenty-three or twenty-four. That way he would be almost certain to be placed on top of the load.
<name>Cider</name>	Cider	Naomi	The apples are just past ripe, and I direct [MASK] to stew them with honey when honey can be had. We press out all the juice and express a kind of sauce, sir, and we’ve always called it nectar. I hope you’ll think it’s just the best.
<name>Sikes</name>	Sikes	Bears	What were those prisoners up to? [MASK], what message do you growl? Was gibt’s? Said the clerk who stood behind him, speaking in German— Captain, it is the prisoners, all calling together. They demand that the big men be hanged.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Coral	Then came a light damp mingled thud and splash as the hawk landed at the edge of some shallow pool which [MASK] could not see. He put his dark brows together and rubbed his hairy chin with a speculative hand. Well, now.
<name>Abner</name>	Abner	Cate	[MASK], you’re daft. He replied with that geniality coming easily to those who feel that they have arrived at righteous decision, Were I daft as often you’ve described me to be, woman, I’d have populated a dozen crazy-houses e’er now.
<name>Mr. McGregor</name>	Mr. McGregor	Wirz	Before he knew what he was doing, [MASK] had shifted the five remaining small carrots to his weak right hand, and his left hand went over to feel for a single vegetable and to toss it out and far.
<name>Zora</name>	Zora	Ira	Suddenly I feel that it might. [MASK] considered this revolutionary departure until he slept belatedly. He thought of it in many phases and ramifications. Would the National Government establish schools quickly for these dogged capricious beasts now designated as humans?
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	gibt	Speak it out once, you bad sergeant. Was [MASK]’s? You want you should go in the stocks again? Not so’s you could notice it. What we want is clubs. For why you should get clubs, God damn? To handle those raiders.
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Eben	I’d pluck it and toast it on a fire. Why, declared [MASK], once more aloud, they’re meat. Meat might be concentrated in pills and potions, it was tonic. The doctor said, Now you go straight home and take a dose of meat.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Wirz	He was eating a lunch at the same time. He had bacon sandwiches and a thin bundle of well-scrubbed carrots, also a canteen of weak elderberry wine. [MASK] had eaten his two sandwiches and had drunk most of the wine, and was snapping carrots between his prominent front teeth.
<name>He</name>	He	Chickamauga	He did not return, probably because he was unfamiliar with the lay of the land and could not find his way. [MASK] took down the wisp of overcoat and wrapped it around himself. He could not sleep for a long time, his ribs hurt him terribly.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Willie	The letter came finally, and gave to [MASK] a release and a freedom and vigor he did not well deserve, and knew that he did not well deserve. It was not the only letter she wrote to him, but it was the only one which reached him until the spring of 1864.
<name>Hiroshima</name>	Hiroshima	Ira	Many hours later [MASK] walked hesitandy into the pen alone. He stood in that infrequent but dread state of knowing that he had observed history with his own eyes, even that he had helped to make it or had attempted to unmake it.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Willie	Where you get that yack, [MASK]? And wouldn’t you like to know? Give me that yack. In a pig’s ass I will. She fell upon him, they fought, at nine years he might have been taken for twelve or older.
<name>Slaves</name>	Slaves	Loot	[MASK] could be traded, sold to the guards in exchange for any comfort obtainable. Cash exchange, the exchange of barter: it mattered not what machinery was employed so long as stewpots bubbled and raw corn whiskey was delivered in jugs.
<name>Rainsford</name>	Rainsford	Naz	Overhead hung the cowl of the torn raincoat, held aloft by broken sticks, serving as cape and shelter tent. [MASK] said that he had been truly cosy for the first time in— For the first time in a long time. He thought that he had never been so cosy before.
<name>he</name>	he	John	He stood behind the shoreline thicket and heard his playmates turning themselves into torturers because they repeated some common gossip, and thought that [MASK] was fifty rods to the windward instead of prowling that same shaggy bar. Attack them with his oyster knife, with his hammer?
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Willie	A dozen hands were on his legs, prying— and now the right wrist— What was that, a rope? Wrench, wrench, wrench; the noose brought the two thick wrists together and wrapped them, no matter how he strained. [MASK] could only say, Agh, agh.
<name>Pa</name>	Pa	Poppy	With scads of gravy under the crust, and just a mite of onion. I’ve fresh chervil and marjoram! Chervil in the third row of the kitchen garden, and marjoram in a pot on the shelf yonder. Well, [MASK], not too much, or you’ll sacrifice the woodsy taste.
<name>Zaroff</name>	Zaroff	Nathan	I have eaten eels. Mister, to think I’ve got you for a comrade! [MASK] traded a haircut for some rancid grease and with this substance he scrubbed off rust which had formed, and took the stiffness out of the weapon’s mechanism.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jem	Hear me now: the master is with [MASK], doctoring the Blackberry cow again, trying to save her. Should he come into the house he is not to watch by my mother’s bed, but also must rest. Hear? Yas’m.
<name>Mammy</name>	Mammy	Extra	Now, in adult state, slave and young mistress worked at preparing the black gowns for the young mistress. [MASK] toiled as seriously as she had when weaving flowers. Even her plump arms showed a dye not put there by the God who had designated her as a black.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Ira	The little parade jolted west on the lane once more, but with the wagon ahead. [MASK] pointed out to the driver: this road intersecting at the right... turn back on it, past the next intersection . . . swing left.
<name>Bill</name> (The passage is referencing Bill the Kid, a notorious outlaw from the American Old West)	Bill (The passage is referencing Bill the Kid, a notorious outlaw from the American Old West)	Sherman	Through this cartooned ornate metropolis rioted columns of armed Yankees, and at their head loped the rapacious [MASK] with six pistols on his belt and a knife clamped in his fangs. Yankees were bursting buildings apart, playing ball with babies tossed from bayonet to bayonet. . . .
<name>He</name>	He	Sam	He had hoped to be a minister. His father would not hear of it. Ministers earned but little money. ... [MASK] studied long, he’d studied earnestly if ineffectually for the Law. He had failed each time he was examined.
<name>Blackie</name>	Blackie	Tomas	Back and forth, all the day through, up and down. And still [MASK] is ready for more. I’ve ridden him at sunset after he’d toiled like a slave, and he was fairly ready to canter— Hm. That will take your savings.
<name>The man</name>	The man	Ira	The others stood debating, while there ensued a gush of women and old people and children from the cars. [MASK] walked away from the train, south around the extremity of the curve, until he was out of sight. He should strike for a road, any road.
<name>Indians</name>	Indians	Yanks	Over to the east beyond the uneven palisade and sentry shacks [MASK] stood in droves, watching the merrymaking across that low place where the stockade dipped over the creek. They stood upon high ground on one side, the celebrants were upon distant high ground on the other side, they could see.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Merry	Ah, red Indians, [MASK] thought, advancing in their birch-bark boats. A night bird cried in the sky. They cooked on the barge; they had a box which they would fill with sand, they could build their small fire.
<name>Brigid</name>	Brigid	Harry	In turn she pushed down the weary crumpled eyelids and let her hand pass smoothly and coolly over the closed eyes. So odd to see you close, even in dark, without your specs. [MASK], you must know I’m very wicked. I suffer lust.
<name>Stonewall</name>	Stonewall	Chandler	Now he saw his new proud Country prostrate before Northern assaults, armored only by its armies. The Confederacy was weaponed no longer with hope, only with determination. To most men [MASK] would have voiced his opinion never; to a few he would have spoken directly if satirically.
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Ira	[MASK] repeated it under his breath. Whipped, whipped, whipped. Beaten down. He took a fold of currency from his pocket. Fifty dollars Confederate. All I can spare. We are very short of cash these days. But it will help you to secure food.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Charley	Both doors locked on the outside. Couldn’t get them open. We could wait, [MASK]. They’re bound to open them in time. Then we’d have four or five muskets, and maybe even some knives or bayonets— Have they got bayonets on?
<name>Romans</name>	Romans	Romans	He picked up the Bible, began to read the Twelfth Chapter of [MASK], more to the Claffey taste. Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love. . . rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Claffey	[MASK] did not see them again after he crossed near the stile; he saw only the marks of their going. He saw traces where rails had been taken out beside the stile in order for horses to pass, but the rails had been restored carefully to position again.
<name>John Brown</name>	John Brown	Collins	[MASK]’s Raiders were thus the first into the fray, but other bands were not far behind. They descended upon the newcomers with ferocity unmatched. It was as if they were driven by an impulse which had not ruled the raiders when they slugged merely through cupidity, merely through the craving to exert their strength.
<name>Isadora</name>	Isadora	Veronica	Come in. [MASK] went down those several steps as she had gone in fancy so many times. Smaller tombs within this larger edifice were open, and someone dressed in white lay within each marble shell. Or was it marble, was it granite?
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Columbus	He climbed high into trees, and ladders had to be brought; he entombed himself for two days within an unused chimney; once he crept into the west wall of the library and strips of siding had to be removed in order to rescue [MASK].
<name>Comrade</name>	Comrade	Jude	If we tarry too long, we won’t never get out. I know. And I’m bound to get out. So’m I. That’s why we’re killing ourselves, [MASK]. But his fierce small face was grinning. We’ll make it, comrade.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Flory	They moved on after calling some taunt intended for his ears. [MASK] turned toward the north. For a time he tried his old trick of walking on the rail but he kept falling off. He trudged on, and then there were men with guns immediately ahead of him.
<name>my</name>	my	Lucy	Yes, yes. I’ve thought of that. He added hastily, [MASK] child, I’d recommend the pink walking gown for the dye-vat, since it has an unhappy connotation of seminary days. I remember how miserable you were, forever begging to return home.
<name>Sharps</name>	Sharps	Yank	Where? Got killed someplace or other, when they were tearing down that rail fence in front of their lines, acting as skirmishers. [MASK] shot him with one of those fancy long-range rifles, maybe had a telescope on it.
<name>Eben</name>	Eben	Seneca	[MASK] was proud of his sign and pleased often by his own humor. In early March, when there was still an abundance of forest trash all over the place, he had amused himself by hunting for curly splinters, chips and other morsels of pine wood or roots which had dried into the shape of letters.
<name>Satan</name>	Satan	Satan	Had enough of prayers when I was little. I speak now from the Larger Catechism: We are by nature children of Wrath, bond slaves to [MASK], and justly liable to all punishments in this world and that which is to come.
<name>She</name>	She	Veronica	Sudden scratch of orange in the night, the singing and rush of some narrow pointed force close at hand. [MASK] continued walking the thick piled mass of dark air, her feet were unhurt by the pillow they trod.
<name>Phileas</name>	Phileas	Poppy	And it’s just a trial, traveling these days. Everyone tells that. And such a sight of cash. [MASK], have we—? Do you have sufficient funds? I shall draw money out of my box, come what may.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Tite	I got some corn bread saved. So he had, but when he offered it to [MASK] the big chap squeezed his eyes shut and made a gesture of refusal. Oh, come on. It hain’t too bad. Just coarse and dry—no salt.
<name>Elpenor</name>	Elpenor	Tupley	During the same battle in which the cousins Norton lost their lives, [MASK] disappeared. He was supposed to carry stretchers, he carried none; he was required to assist at a field hospital, he was not there. Later a sergeant discovered the old fellow drunk and quaking.
<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Flory	No longer a child, no longer creeping in the guise of an outcast from even a portion of his own family. . . . Soldiers owned money. They must own it, else how could so many of them visit [MASK]’s mother?
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Harry	Actually this is larger— He drew her face down into the hair of his chest. You know, he said, and well aware that simple frankness was ridiculous—- This is adultery. We’ve committed adultery, are committing it. She breathed, Yes, yes, [MASK].
<name>Twain</name>	Twain	Harry	The diet of the prisoners was an unknown quantity; [MASK] assumed that they would receive the ordinary field ration of the Confederate soldier. He applied himself seriously to the work, but by his third night in the Anderson community he recognized that there was little excuse for staying longer.
<name>the scout</name>	the scout	Ira	The frightened cat raced across the roadway once more, and the major’s horse began to dance. He brought the animal under control and pulled over against the fence. He asked calmly of [MASK], Have any troops passed this way, sir?
<name>John</name>	John	Ira	She said, Noooo, said it softly and drawn out like the plaint of some animal. Not the evergreen smoke, [MASK]. The other. The Yellow Smell. He was cast, cast in his shabby rough but dignified clothing, he was metal poured and cooled.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Paul	Nine days apart. Remember that, [MASK]: I’m still your elder. And went to the same church and same school, and our fathers are brothers, and what’s more than that, our mothers are first cousins. How do you like that, hey?
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Curtis	A string of Regulators sped yelling a few rods behind. Get him! That’s [MASK]! Stop him, you down there! and the emphasis of their hollering cancelled the chorused litany which was still being called on the northern slope.
<name>God</name>	God	Ira	The man fell forward and a little to one side. When they turned him over it was amazing to see that he had a mystic grin on his face, as if he were delighted at the whole occurrence. Oh, [MASK] cried, it is casual, casual.
<name>Eutychus</name>	Eutychus	Paul	We should know that by now. . . . And there sat in a window a certain young man . . . and as [MASK] was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead.
<name>Mississippi</name>	Mississippi	Cousin	She’s left a fire, so now I shall prepare your supper. Somehow I feel especially soiled tonight. A weak chuckle caught in his throat. Your pitcher is filled, I trust. But I’ll just bring some hot water, [MASK].
<name>Cagliostro</name>	Cagliostro	Tis	There were no guards inside the enclosure at the time, so the light-fingered gentry made off safely with their plunder. [MASK] understood that the prison’s superintendent became apoplectic at the news. I have met him barely: a glum bearded gentleman offoreign extraction.
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Claffey	Grumpily he ordered the diggers to file by and present their spades for [MASK]’s inspection. One, marked plainly with the C brand, turned up within a couple of minutes; a second was found farther north, across the branch, but only after much searching.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Naomi	Shh. This to a Pet or a Ninny who banged about while scrubbing the floor. You must work more quietly; I do not wish them waked. Shh. Out across the yard in the kitchen [MASK] blubbered about it.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Eric	The National bounty would not be forthcoming until a certain amount of red tape had been untied. [MASK] was sent home to get his personal belongings, and was warned to report at the armory not later than seven o’clock that night.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Lucy	Bird thou never xvert, and her mother did also until blows of later bereavement were more than her mother could bear, and it was impossible for her to venture a pleasantry. It grieved [MASK] that she found no balm in prayer; privately she felt like a heretic about it.
<name>Jesse</name>	Jesse	Brennan	Why— Pass that canteen my way— Coarse laughter, the bellow bursting out, uncaged cats sitting large and two-legged, the hoot and lashing of them. Now, [MASK] is an outlaw, all on some mountain high. With infantry and cavalry to take him they did try.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Merry	[MASK] encountered also several musicians, most of them drummers, minus their instruments; during their season of comparative strength they sat in fury whenever they heard bleating across the stockade’s rim. There was a single fifer who played camp duties for the Georgia Reserves.
<name>Ichabod</name>	Ichabod	Coral	Foot-post or head-post, [MASK] knew not which. It was turned from a single length of timber, you could not tell what color the wood had been to begin with, you would know only when you cut it.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Flory	They were not challenged, no sentinels walked near, they left stores and offices behind them and floundered through vines until they could creep into a low ditch and then up to ties and rails beyond. Reckon I guided you in the right fashion, cried [MASK] triumphantly.
<name>Blackie</name>	Blackie	Colony	The four men stood around and looked at the curved stiffening morsel in the fairly new and fairly clean jacket. Got a good coat on him, said the youngest Wingate. I could use a coat like that. Take it, said [MASK]. He’ll never need it more.
<name>Colonel</name>	Colonel	Smith	It consisted, mainly, of making eighty-seven men, perhaps, seem to count as a hundred. [MASK] edged warily in front of the formation, moving a few steps at a time, moving to the right where his congealed gaze led him.
<name>Colonel</name>	Colonel	Lucy	We’ve artillery mounted there. Oh, [MASK] cried, some may escape. They’re such a desperate lot. Never fear. A squad of guards remains on duty through every hour of the twenty-four, and will until the gap is closed.
<name>she</name>	she	Lucy	Why dwell on this, why countenance the savage lurid yielding? I’m not twenty. I’m fifty. I’m old. I should be old. ... I must be demented. What would [MASK] think of me if she learned of the depravity of my plan?
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Harry	Should I not set my mind more acutely upon the matter of Godliness for my child to come? What am I—pantheist, hedonist? Her soul laughed even while the original strictness of conventional early teaching was rejected. She had rejected it first in lying with [MASK].
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Benny	His mother said that although the wound had healed on the outside, front and back, it didn’t seem to have cured itself in [MASK]’s vitals. He had to keep a pan by his bed at night, to cough into, and sometimes he raised blood.
<name>Max</name>	Max	Crickland	He could have been pounded to death then and there, but another raider was forced into the arena, attention was distracted. [MASK] fell to his knees, fell further. His length stretched across the ground, his shoulders shook as he blubbered.
<name>The Wendigo</name>	The Wendigo	Ghouls	Recollection of that putrid tenantless stockade was still cold and strong in him. What bone? A piece from a brute, or a piece from a human? They are neither man nor woman, they are neither brute nor human, they are [MASK]. . . .
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Tom	These were people from the Forty-fifth Volunteer Infantry, they were dying fast. [MASK] took the place made vacant by the demise of the ex-mule-driver, but the exminer and the ex-baggage-handler were in final disgusting stages of scurvy.
<name>Marco</name>	Marco	Nathan	A peasant had told [MASK] about this track, he had drawn a map in the dust with a stick. Many miles of traveling would be saved, and the path led through wild and beautiful country (all the country roundabout was wild, it was beautiful...
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jonas	He was firm in the belief that night air was more dangerous than day air, stockade or no stockade. Then get to your cabin before you catch your death, [MASK]. You in your shirt-tail. The slave hastened off, a tatterdemalion under the serene moon.
<name>Sally</name>	Sally	Mackey	Hell, that’s where lots the growed-men guards go. Even officers as well. There’s a nigger wench along that road up northwest of the depot, said [MASK]. But they say this white lady is better. But you better have that five-dollar shinplaster handy.
