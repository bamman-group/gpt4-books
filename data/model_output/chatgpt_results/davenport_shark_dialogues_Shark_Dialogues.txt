<name>Bea</name>	Bea	Hiro	Two hours later they ambled leisurely back to the main hall of the crematorium. There they were ushered into a room where [MASK]’s remains had been placed upon a tray. The heap of bone and ash was rusty colored, large fragments sticking up like coral.
<name>John</name>	John	Simon	[MASK] leaned over, watching her. The fact that she trusted him enough to sleep so deeply in his presence seemed to him a miracle. Months back—already a year?—he had seen in her first glance that this woman would not be incorporated, not easily solved.
<name>Malia</name>	Malia	Pono	He dozed beside her in his wheelchair, newspaper drifting from his lap. Beyond him, [MASK] sprawled, snoring softly in the porch-swing, hair flowing down to the lanai. It billowed softly in the trades.
<name>them</name>	them	Grandfather	“Is it such a terrible desire? They were over eighty. The world kept them apart for over sixty years. The shock of being in a hospital, another institution, after six decades of it, would have killed [MASK]. They would have died apart.
<name>John Steinbeck</name>	John Steinbeck	Adam	Laboring twelve to fifteen hours for as little as forty cents a day, they had no running water or sewage systems in the camps, were subjected to floggings or shootings by sadistic Portuguese and Scotch luna. Sitting in the back room of the Bay Horse, [MASK] listed their complaints.
<name>Lehua</name>	Lehua	Duke	Kokua families had burned their dead in hiding. Some nights we heard screams, bounty hunters capturing the hidden. [MASK]’s sickness spread, his skin ran with it .. . “. . . 1 was seventeen. We hid in the valley for over a year.
<name>Keahi</name>	Keahi	Vanya	She pointed her finger at each granddaughter. “You and you and you. You are marching, fighting for our people, but while you look the other way, haole are creeping up your holokuV’ “What do you mean?” [MASK] asked.
<name>her</name>	her	Jess	He was gracious, his wife was attractive, they offered her their friendship and advice, which made [MASK] all the more determined to work the farm, keep it thriving. Still, she was fearful of so much responsibility, so many workers depending on her for income.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Body	She ugly, first of all. [MASK] got no front, no back. Secondly, she phony. Talk dem high-tone words. No can talk Hawaiian kine.” For weeks he sat at dinner, dreamy and distracted. One night he pushed back his plate decisively.
<name>Mei</name>	Mei	Holo	She still, like cobweb growin' from her mouth. One day she show me one black pearl, so big my eyes go bulge. And funny little book, she say made of jade. “These were meant for [MASK], my oldest,” she say.
<name>The bus</name>	The bus	Bodies	Near midnight they stopped at a pub for gas. [MASK] creaked alive, staggered off and into the pub, parched for cold lagers. An Aborigine woman plunked down in the shadows beside the bus, pulling a Violet Crumbly from her pocket.
<name>lepers</name>	lepers	Kokua	Here, when one of them died, their soul departed peacefully. [MASK], family members who fled with them to the jungle, refused them mirrors, pushed them away from their reflections in clear streams. But lepers knew, they saw their shadows in the sun, grotesque.
<name>Kimo</name>	Kimo	Lloyd	But tough. Only, why can’t you suckers stay away from our women?” “Now look, mate ...” “You look. We’re doing [MASK] a favor, he’s ‘ohana. One favor, that’s it. This is our territory.
<name>Abby</name>	Abby	Torn	“I should have been there. It wouldn’t have happened!” “[MASK]. She didn’t want you there.” “Why?” He beat the floor of the lanai. “She wanted you to stay and help me with the land.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Torn	My dream has been so small. Late at night, [MASK] drove back and forth past the house of women, all the lights ablaze. And he felt whole because, within that place were people he could worry over, look after, long for, love.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Pono	“Why don’t you two get married?” [MASK] laughed so hard, her hair fell down from its pins. “I tried for years to snare him, give your mothers a name. He was too shamed. Afraid they would find out who he was.
<name>Marcello</name>	Marcello	Dat	“Why you let de ot’er live? He bring da cops ...” “He is the cops. If I waited one more minute, you’d have wasted him.” “[MASK]’s right. Look dis one, he try shoot you.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jess	He kept his head down, screwing his face like he was working up an awful sneeze. Then he snorted, so awful a sound, [MASK] turned away. “Look,” he whispered. “Please!” She turned back to him, and gasped.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Vanya	“Then, what are you telling me to do?” “Build a house, have a family, educate your kids. You’re smart. You could have been a lawyer like [MASK]. Maybe one of your kids will be that.”
<name>side-eye</name>	side-eye	Pono	Auwe/ Our history . . . Tongueless women, eyes filed with ignorance of our own blood. I give [MASK] if-looks-could-kill stares, blame it all on her. What father was so rotten she couldn't tell our mothers who he was?
<name>Ophelia</name>	Ophelia	Pono	[MASK]! Nothing left to touch, to look upon. Nothing left to mourn. She stopped stroking, hung sobbing in the sea, a human buoy. And all around, they took shape behind the waves, listening to her heartbeat.
<name>Cutter</name>	Cutter	Toru	“Maybe.” “Great. He’s one of your explosives guys.” [MASK] shifted gears, and slowly pulled away. “He’s fine. I saw him level a hamlet in ’Nam with damp gunpowder and a stick of Juicy Fruit.”
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Duke	Of people mutilated, cast out of the world. It was a cry for mercy, a cry of rage. A cry for all the voiceless victims lying in their graves. It was a wish to run, to die. [MASK] struggled to his feet, insane.
<name>soothing</name>	soothing	gende	You lead dem right to her. Dat’s what dey waitin’ foah.” “This is killing me,” he cried. “I’m so ashamed, I want to die.” “I know you shame.” Her voice turned [MASK].
<name>Malia</name>	Malia	Pono	She wait. And wait. Some days [MASK] disappear. Ot’er days she slowly wall up yard. Soon we livin’ like two wahine in one coffin. Cement wall all way round dat Kalihi house. “Why we live like dis,” I ask.
<name>Queequeg</name>	Queequeg	Duke	His big hands slowly closed down his windpipe, the man’s face turned an awful blue. Then a sailor unloading a supply boat moved up from the dock. He took [MASK] aside and stood apart from him and spoke a name.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Vanya	Her arms drawing us together. Little limbs entwined, shy hands creeping towards each other. In sleep, [MASK]’s brown arm thrown across my waist, feeling her breath, her pulse, the vital current. Me, whispering the word, trying to comprehend it.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Toru	“1 just need to understand what you people are trying to prove.” “That we’re not dead meat. That we won’t back quietly into history.” “Can’t you do it without ...” “It’s too late,” [MASK] said.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Lee	“I’m sorry. If he hadn’t sold those stocks, there would be much, much more.” “[MASK]. Just tell me what I’m worth.” He glanced at the statements again. “You’re his sole heir, of course.”
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Ban	You trafficker in slaves. “[MASK], you say my husband is dead. I must be alone with this. If it’s true, there are things I must do. There’s a guest house here across the lawn.
<name>Filipinos</name>	Filipinos	Hawaiians	Half-caste children were considered blessed with the superiority of white blood, cursed with the native half. The government of the islands slid slowly into chaos, Americans wanting annexation, [MASK] wanting autonomy. Fistfights broke out on the floor of the legislature. Conspiracies, attempted assassinations.
<name>Teahouse</name>	Teahouse	Harigata	. . . And always, he is affectionate, attentive. Precious gifts from the Orient, rubies, ancient museum-quality robes. And very private gifts . . . [MASK], hand-molded by a blind girl.
<name>Sayuri</name>	Sayuri	Jess	Her hair was in the geisha style and, like a geisha girl, she bowed her head, seemingly shy. [MASK] moved forward, enchanted, and knelt facing her, smelling jasmine tea. There was a window beside them, looking out on the ocean.
<name>Tayo</name>	Tayo	Duke	Suddenly she dropped her head. “She loved the sea! I never understood why she ended in the desert.” [MASK] shook his head. “Sometimes, child, we die in metaphor.” “My father loved her, but he never felt she was white enough.
<name>Mrs. Breedlove</name>	Mrs. Breedlove	Holo	But sewing was tangible and real, and she wanted [MASK] to see her doing normal things, not selling dreams to strangers. She was attendant to the child, sliding life to her in small portions, what to do, not do, how to behave in public, and alone.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Simon	“Well.” He moved toward the car. “Take it slow, mates.” The tall one moved forward. “Say, mind if we ask a few questions . .. ?” [MASK]’s expression changed. “Who in hell are you!”
<name>Keala</name>	Keala	Vanya	“Why do you people stay? I mean, what is here worth saving?” He was aware by [MASK]’s silence how that remark had cut. And he thought of her side of the island, the Kona side.
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Emma	She clutched my arm screaming, ‘Don’t let them bury me with niggers!’ ” [MASK] dropped her face in her hands. “I looked her in the eye and cursed her, even as she died.” That night her sheets were soaking wet.
<name>Keawe</name>	Keawe	Jess	“You know, [MASK], foah shoah, you real kanaka kine, not high-tone haole kine. Sometime I t’ink you more da kine dan all de ot’ers put togeddah. Swim foah hours in da sea, squat wit’ me at dawn, eat wit’ fingahs.
<name>Uncle Kahana</name>	Uncle Kahana	Dey	“We get close to end of lava, we move into dat grove. Where highway starts again, is like big parking lot where church was. [MASK] moved da church when lava started cornin’. My cousins waitin’ dere. I guarantee.”
<name>he</name>	he	Duke	His had done it in less than five years. Some nights they drifted through the house and, seeing it through her eyes, [MASK] saw it for the first time. Rooms filled with massive furniture of Malaysian teak and koa, ancient, rare Hawaiian prints.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Vanya	. dream of you." Examining sheepskin jacket, jars of Waitaiki tongues. “I hope you're miserable. 1 hope your wife is bowlegged. ” Him laughing, and then tears. "I named my second daughter, [MASK], after you.”
<name>Mameha</name>	Mameha	Holo	Cloth and thread bleed together, the color holds, the shape.” “If so strong,” [MASK] asked, “then why always making new dresses?” “Because ... by and by the cloth goes shiny, comes into holes. Time to throw away.”
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Benjamin	She showed them to her husband. “Sentimental things, 1 guess.” [MASK] stared at the tiny gold-and-jade diary, the large, black South Seas pearls, then looked at his wife a little scared.
<name>Eddie</name>	Eddie	Godyoucheat	A club. His arms were maps of lesion-scars, most of the muscles gone. He walked slowly, dragging one foot in a surgical boot. [MASK]. Youcheat! I raised them, kept them all together, wasn’t that enough?
<name>Kino</name>	Kino	Lili	When it was dark she crept back to their shack, holding to her heart what they had cherished: a Bible, snapshots of [MASK]’s family, the tiny diary and black pearls. Then she lay down sobbing, beating her face and chest.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Pono	“[MASK]! Dey shoot him! Dat haole guy . .. You got pamphlets, bettah bum dem quick! Dambastards ... !” And she ran, ran down the muddy, red dirt road, skidding on her backside. A crowd encircled the haole unionizer, guards cursing over him.
<name>her</name>	her	Jess	That pleased [MASK], she felt her daughter needed a little grief, a little humility. And yet . . . seeing hints of her mother’s features in the girl’s, her breathing changed, something hurt, like breathing through the wounded lungs of a bird.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Tom	“I’ve never seen anything so ...” He took [MASK] aside, trying to control himself. “Someone drops a cigarette, you’ll blow this part of the island off the map. Break it up, man.
<name>Moana</name>	Moana	niuhi	Then he took her face in both hands. “Think of it! There will be no time to rot.” They lay back like lovers, waves washing over them. Then [MASK] ghosted in. Golden eyes. And fins. Na Kaikamahine o
<name>Keala</name>	Keala	Pono	If I do, it will divide my workers, affect the coffee-harvesting season. Haole coffee distributors will blackball our plantation like before.” Later, back in the house, the women sat self-consciously, [MASK] eying each of them.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Hire	“[MASK]’s showplace, built to intimidate his enemies. 1 always wanted to be here.” They trudged toward the big house, wiping their cheeks with rags. “I used to think you were selfish, not wanting kids.
<name>Unknown</name>	Unknown	Pono	[MASK] stood in line ten hours just to give one pint. Japanese arrived, offering blood, and money, each family dressed in black, the color worn when respect is due. A blind Hawaiian couple gave two pints, then stood in line to give again.
<name>Kilauea</name>	Kilauea	Lloyd	Took him just under seven hours.” “No miracle,” [MASK] said. “Last week friends walk two miles along da shore, lava plenty hard dere.” “It’s dangerous,” she warned. “People fall in crevasses, break legs.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Vanya	[MASK] flying east. 1 have tofght her, wrestle her, to keep her from burning down the doctor’s house. Greasy pigment, smell of paint, painting under moonlight while the doctor slept. Next morning huge letters across his manicured green lawn. RAPIST.
<name>Death</name>	Death	Johnny	When it hits me in full stride, 1 ask [MASK] to smother me, stab me in the heart. He weeps, measures out my medication. And when the wolf softly pads away, what’s left of me is ravened from within. What now inhabits me?
<name>Eurydice</name>	Eurydice	Pono	“Do you miss your world of mano?” “Without you,” she answered sofdy, “it is the only way I could exist.” But seeing how it distressed him, [MASK] vowed, “As long as you live, I reject that world.
<name>Alaska</name>	Alaska	Jess	“Why would anything happen to you?” She chose her words carefully. “I’m going, [MASK]. Out. Into the world.” “What?” “I want to see if I can stand it.”
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Nevah	Foah us, local folks. For taro patches, one small plot for livin.’” She stood, stirring a pot maliciously. “Know what she say me? She no like poi\ [MASK] did. She make me cry, make my old gums hurt.
<name>The Lost Boys</name>	The Lost Boys	Abos	“You don’t know a damned thing. I grew up with [MASK], changed blood with ’em, went through their gory initiations into manhood. I love them in a way you’ll never understand, maybe more than you feel for your own.
<name>President</name>	President	Roosevelt	Then, unaccountably, she moaned, rocking back and forth. She hugged herself, beat her fists upon her chest, and wept. Alarmed Secret Service men surrounded [MASK]; he pushed them back, curious, somewhat apprehensive.
<name>her</name>	her	Hiro	She sat by a window, full of dark speculations which turned to sober intricacies, rage tempered by sane reason. She returned to [MASK]’s room. On an old teak pedestal, under a crystal bell jar was an object he had highly prized.
<name>Perdita</name>	Perdita	Pono	“What for, [MASK]! What you lookin’ for?” Her juices. Her rhythms. Her honor. Lodged somewhere in the grottoes and arches of his spine. Silently, in torchlight, she guided the knife, traced a flashing crimson line along his back.
<name>peacocks</name>	peacocks	Menehune	Time to wander and look, and see. There were things she had heard of here that she would only believe with her eyes: mysterious Waipi‘o Valley on the northeast coast where in deep rain forests [MASK] lived. Great soaring cliffs with thousand-foot waterfalls.
<name>his mother</name>	his mother	Ming	He thought of [MASK], how she used to tell him, “Find the thing that keeps you angry.” Maybe, he had a mission, a pathetically small task on the grand scale of living, but for now it was implicit and would do.
<name>Tea Cake</name>	Tea Cake	Simon	“[MASK] no look so good.” She flinched. “His arm is healed, just those few scars.” “Not talkin’ bout de arm. Why you no tell me he ma'i fake." “It isn’t!”
<name>Daenerys</name>	Daenerys	Vanya	Stark totems of charred, denuded palms rose stoically, but in their midst, a tiny island of young, green palms bent and squeaked like infants. Molten lava had mysteriously forked round them. [MASK] knelt at a patch of ground beneath a palm.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Ming	I see our history racing just behind your eyes. Your mother was firstborn. She must remember things. Things she never told her sisters . . [MASK] shook her head, spoke softly. “You feel responsible for your mother’s death, don’t you?
<name>Pele</name>	Pele	Pele	“Each night ancestors walk this land. Can you feel it?” he asked. “The island has much mana because it is the birthplace of Kamehameha I. And because [MASK] lives here. That’s why, I believe, you were called.”
<name>She</name>	She	Pono	Her joints mourned the heaviness of tissue and musculature that governed them. The profound desire to walk, the lack of power to do so. With a blinding sense of helplessness, [MASK] saw she had no arms. She was bound in a bag of scales slowly suffocating her.
<name>Shaniqua</name>	Shaniqua	Torn	Life get real ugly. When my boy ten, I give up streets, learn cookin’, moah bettah for yoah pride. When my boy eighteen, he bring home [MASK], say it’s his, da mama no want. Den he get shot selling drugs.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Pono	Instead of verdant little acres where people could plant small gardens and live on a fish-and-poi economy, what [MASK] saw were sad little homestead plots on barren land, no irrigation, no forests, or running water.
<name>Mother</name>	Mother	Jess	Lies, all lies. I had heard the whispers, the child who stood just outside the door. How 1 hated [MASK], her truth-running mouth, her motherfather life . . . . . .' Father. I didn’t even know his name.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Pono	They had their camp friends, and some nights the Irishman sat with the workers playing cards and drinking pineapple wine. And nearby was a public school. At five [MASK] was big and robust, eyes dark, electric, skin a perfect golden cast.
<name>Isadora</name>	Isadora	Hiro	Life was growing old for her, [MASK] traveled more and more. Her seductive arts, her rituals, her passion for him, had nowhere to go. Without him, she was pared down to ‘ole. Nothingness.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Pono	Mothers screamed, hiding their children under beds, but two boys were found with red spots on their legs. Their families were handcuffed, forced out to the car. Seeing [MASK] in the distance, one of the bounty hunters approached slowly, studying her arms and neck.
<name>Jude</name>	Jude	Mathys	He woke without clothes, or money, his wages, everything, gone, so sick, so weak, laughing crewmates carried him over their shoulders back to the ship. Before they were out of the harbor, [MASK] swallowed a bottle of rat poison and flung himself overboard.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Vanya	Later, we’ll decide.” [MASK] embraced her, feeling they were girls again. They held each other silently, held and seemed beheld in shafts of sunlight going dim and dusty, like messages from a god who had begun to vacillate.
<name>Fai</name>	Fai	Hiro	[MASK] was due. He’d soon be home, roaming the house calling out “F/ai!” Even if he was dead, he’d soon be home. When her voice came it was husky, almost male. “What did you say?”
<name>Mrs. Peters</name>	Mrs. Peters	Pono	“You girls seem astounded,” he said, “that I am up on things. Sixty years of reading papers, listening to the news, 1 am a tome of information!” He took [MASK]’s hand.
<name>Doctor</name>	Doctor	Simon	He sighed. “Not to worry sweetheart, it’s not contagious.” She reached up gingerly and touched his arm. “[MASK], you have to see another doctor.” “After our ‘sound-and-light’ show, I promise.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Simon	But that is not important.” They left quietly, and she stood still, breathing in the fragrant air. [MASK] struggled from his cot, and leaned against a tree. “1 heard every word.” “And you think I’m a fool.
<name>grandmothers</name>	grandmothers	Pono	’s lap. All around lay photo albums, snapshots of their mothers through the years, and of the granddaughters posed self-consciously with [MASK]. Photos of women, mostly women, husbands and sons peripheral, blurring off to crumbled edges where mucilage had dried.
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Jess	Her head began to throb, as it always did when she tried to understand the past, know what it wanted from her, what she would have to pay. The door opened, a blade of light sliced the dark. [MASK] felt such terror she went momentarily blind.
<name>John</name>	John	Jess	I’m frightened.” “Don’t you think I’m scared? I’m terrified. You have to hold up your end, take care of the farm. It’s why you came home. Don’t you understand, [MASK]. You were called.”
<name>Makana</name>	Makana	Kelonikoa	All night, [MASK] sat massaging her son’s big toe, calling “Ho'i hou! Ho'i hou!" Come back, come back. For Polynesians believed the dead were often undecided, and that the last of life hung back in the big toe.
<name>Tony</name>	Tony	Lloyd	[MASK] seemed half angry, half in shock. “Why you let de ot’er live? He bring da cops ...” “He is the cops. If I waited one more minute, you’d have wasted him.”
<name>Moana</name>	Moana	Vanya	“Why we listening to a Yank? We not American property!” [MASK] had jumped to her feet with no sense of it. “Yes, Hawaiians are American citizens. But you and I share the same ocean continent. We are all Oceanians first!”
<name>Unknown</name>	Unknown	Lloyd	They flung themselves face-down in grass, momentarily stunned by the runneling off of adrenaline. The sky had changed, a lessening dark, confusion in the light. After a few minutes, [MASK] rose, moved deeper into the trees. They followed at a distance.
<name>age</name>	age	Duke	She paused, tempered her strokes, seeing how, in spite of his still-fabulous strength, [MASK] moved a little slower. Such is the morphology of disease, that it can seem kind: paw-stroking a man year by year, rather than hammering him with its full assault.
<name>Run Run</name>	Run Run	Pono	“Now, back to business.” [MASK] sat up, pointing to a headline Run Run had circled. “What about this fellow?” A fifteen-foot shark had killed a local woman swimming in known breeding waters, a resting place for ‘aumakua mano.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Pono	There were no signs of brakes applied before the car went over. Workers said she even waved. Suddenly, armed guards were posted at the camp fence gates. [MASK] saw their fires at night, saw moonlight refracted on their rifles. Who were they keeping out?
<name>Patrick</name>	Patrick	Penetrate	For a while they seemed to circle, two wolves recognizing each other. When he finally introduced himself, his smile was quick, a reflection across a blade. In bed, he was cold, mechanical. Fondle. [MASK]. Ejaculate.
<name>Somebody</name>	Somebody	Simon	He’d driven half a block when the Honda turned into the street behind him. He accelerated, made a quick right, shooting a Stop sign. The Honda speeded up, and shot the sign. “[MASK]. Somebody tailin’ us.”
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Pono	My family died in shame and silence, here, hidden from the world. But for [MASK], our blood would have died with me. Our name. Our history. Gone. Without a footprint. Who would know that I had even passed this way?
<name>howler</name>	howler	Pono	Some nights there were shouts, gunshots, and [MASK] sat up, wondering, Flee, or frieze? Then a leper bleating, screams of his family pleading with bounty hunters. Torches locomoting down the cliffs, a moaning like a dirge. One night, they heard a singsong whistle.
<name>Volcano</name>	Volcano	Pele	Tourists aimed their cameras, inwardly scoffing, not knowing that within hours, a cloud would blanket the pit, bringing utter blackness, and when it lifted, the offerings would be gone. But not now, not yet. [MASK] liked to titillate and tease.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Toru	As [MASK] approached the airport she sat up, imperiously arranged her dress and hat. “I’m exhausting myself. What I am saying is: sell the land, you sell your souls, you will damn yourselves to slavery, and keep the whites in power.”
<name>Keawe</name>	Keawe	Emma	Loving them, covetting them, the childless neighbors, the lei stringers, spied and gossiped. “Poor little no-name buggahs. T’ink third one, [MASK], be da one go bad. Look like fool-around type, sneaky eye.”
<name>he</name>	he	Simon	Then something eclipsed her reaction, in fact, jolted her to her very bowels. As [MASK] talked, turning his head, she noticed his flushed, slightly swollen earlobe. Below it, small patch of whitish skin.
