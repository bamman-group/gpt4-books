<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	She would not speak to [MASK] with half the certainty she felt on the subject, she would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter, of a possible attachment on his side, of the desirableness of the alliance, supposing such attachment to be real and returned.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Jemima	But, could you be comfortable yourself, to be spending the whole evening away from the poor boy?" "Yes; you see his papa can, and why should not I? [MASK] is so careful; and she could send us word every hour how he was.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Charles	But in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife, with "Oh! no, indeed, [MASK], I cannot bear to have you go away. Only think if anything should happen?" The child had a good night, and was going on well the next day.
<name>Elinor</name>	Elinor	Anne	"Yes," sighed [MASK], "we shall, indeed, be known to be related to them!" then recollecting herself, and not wishing to be answered, she added, "I certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to procure the acquaintance.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Elizabeth	She had little hope of success; but [MASK], who in the event of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied than herself, should never, she thought, have reason to reproach her for giving no warning. She spoke, and seemed only to offend.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	It was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down; but [MASK] was startled at finding him nearer than she had supposed, and half inclined to suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been occupied by them, striving to catch sounds, which yet she did not think he could have caught.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Anne	It was you, and not your sister, I find, that my brother had the pleasure of being acquainted with, when he was in this country." [MASK] hoped she had outlived the age of blushing; but the age of emotion she certainly had not.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	"I am not yet so much changed," cried [MASK], and stopped, fearing she hardly knew what misconstruction. After waiting a few moments he said, and as if it were the result of immediate feeling, "It is a period, indeed!
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Frederick	"Depend upon it, they were all perfectly comfortable." "I might not like them the better for that perhaps. Such a number of women and children have no right to be comfortable on board." "My dear [MASK], you are talking quite idly.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Mary	"Are you serious?" cried [MASK], her eyes brightening. "Dear me! that's a very good thought, very good, indeed. To be sure, I may just as well go as not, for I am of no use at home--am I?
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	I think my father certainly ought to hear of it; do mention all about him." [MASK] avoided a direct reply, but it was just the circumstance which she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated, but as what ought to be suppressed.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Mary	The two families were so continually meeting, so much in the habit of running in and out of each other's house at all hours, that it was rather a surprise to her to find [MASK] alone; but being alone, her being unwell and out of spirits was almost a matter of course.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Anne	"No," replied [MASK], in a low, feeling voice. "That I can easily believe." "It was not in her nature. She doted on him." "It would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved."
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Anne	"Where shall we go?" said she, when they were ready. "I suppose you will not like to call at the Great House before they have been to see you?" "I have not the smallest objection on that account," replied [MASK].
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Charles	"Oh! [MASK], I declare it will be too abominable if you do, when you promised to go." "No, I did not promise. I only smirked and bowed, and said the word 'happy.' There was no promise."
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Anne	" "Well," said [MASK], "I certainly am proud, too proud to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon place." "I love your indignation," said he; "it is very natural.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	Anxious to omit no possible precaution, [MASK] struggled, and said-- "I am afraid, ma'am, that it is not perfectly understood. Pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your whole party this evening.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	There is so little real friendship in the world! and unfortunately" (speaking low and tremulously) "there are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late." [MASK] saw the misery of such feelings.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	It will be some trial to us both." [MASK] did not shrink from it; on the contrary, she truly felt as she said, in observing-- "I think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two; your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Louisa	They came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready; but [MASK] recollecting, immediately afterwards that she had something to procure at a shop, invited them all to go back with her into the town. They were all at her disposal.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	[MASK] admired the good acting of the friend, in being able to shew such pleasure as she did, in the expectation and in the actual arrival of the very person whose presence must really be interfering with her prime object.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Charles	No, I did not promise. I only smirked and bowed, and said the word 'happy.' There was no promise." "But you must go, [MASK]. It would be unpardonable to fail. We were asked on purpose to be introduced.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	To begin without knowing that at such a time there will be the means of marrying, I hold to be very unsafe and unwise, and what I think all parents should prevent as far as they can." [MASK] found an unexpected interest here.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	Their acquaintance was exceedingly sought after. Everybody was wanting to visit them. They had drawn back from many introductions, and still were perpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing. Here were funds of enjoyment. Could [MASK] wonder that her father and sister were happy?
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Anne	A few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance; but not with a few months ended [MASK]'s share of suffering from it. Her attachment and regrets had, for a long time, clouded every enjoyment of youth, and an early loss of bloom and spirits had been their lasting effect.
<name>Werther</name>	Werther	Harville	I would assist any brother officer's wife that I could, and I would bring anything of [MASK]'s from the world's end, if he wanted it. But do not imagine that I did not feel it an evil in itself."
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	"This is very kind of [MASK]," was her husband's answer, "and I should be very glad to have you go; but it seems rather hard that she should be left at home by herself, to nurse our sick child."
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	They ought to feel what is due to you as my sister. However, we may as well go and sit with them a little while, and when we have that over, we can enjoy our walk." [MASK] had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent;
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Charles	No symptoms worse than before had appeared. [MASK] came a few hours afterwards, to bring a later and more particular account. He was tolerably cheerful. A speedy cure must not be hoped, but everything was going on as well as the nature of the case admitted.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	In the course of the same morning, [MASK] and her father chancing to be alone together, he began to compliment her on her improved looks; he thought her "less thin in her person, in her cheeks; her skin, her complexion, greatly improved; clearer, fresher.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	[MASK] sighed and blushed and smiled, in pity and disdain, either at her friend or herself. The part which provoked her most, was that in all this waste of foresight and caution, she should have lost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Charles	[MASK] is out shooting. I have not seen him since seven o'clock. He would go, though I told him how ill I was. He said he should not stay out long; but he has never come back, and now it is almost one.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	It is early." "I never want them, I assure you. They talk and laugh a great deal too much for me. Oh! [MASK], I am so very unwell! It was quite unkind of you not to come on Thursday." "
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Mary	"[MASK] is good-natured enough in many respects," said she; "but she does sometimes provoke me excessively, by her nonsense and pride--the Elliot pride. She has a great deal too much of the Elliot pride.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	Your sister being with you, my love, I have no scruple at all. You would not like to leave him yourself, but you see I can be of no use. [MASK] will send for me if anything is the matter."
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	To have been described long ago to a recent acquaintance, by nameless people, is irresistible; and [MASK] was all curiosity. She wondered, and questioned him eagerly; but in vain. He delighted in being asked, but he would not tell. "
<name>Frederick</name>	Frederick	Frederick	I hate to hear of women on board, or to see them on board; and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere, if I can help it." This brought his sister upon him. "Oh! [MASK]!
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	This was the principle on which [MASK] wanted her father to be proceeding, his friends to be urging him. She considered it as an act of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with all the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments could secure, and saw no dignity in anything short of it.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Charles	Consider, my father's heir: the future representative of the family." "Don't talk to me about heirs and representatives," cried [MASK]. "I am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising sun.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Louisa	She had learnt, in the last ten minutes, more of his feelings towards [MASK], more of all his feelings than she dared to think of; and she gave herself up to the demands of the party, to the needful civilities of the moment, with exquisite, though agitated sensations.
<name>London</name>	London	Thornberry	He had been prevented setting off for [MASK], but I really forget by what; for I was in a hurry, and could not much attend, and I can only answer for his being determined not to be delayed in his return.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Benwick	When you had the presence of mind to suggest that [MASK] would be the properest person to fetch a surgeon, you could have little idea of his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery." "Certainly I could have none.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	She thought it could scarcely escape him to feel that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness as a very resolute character. They got on fast. [MASK] was astonished to recognise the same hills and the same objects so soon.
<name>Wentworth</name>	Wentworth	Anne	[MASK] understood it. He wished to avoid seeing her. He had inquired after her, she found, slightly, as might suit a former slight acquaintance, seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged, actuated, perhaps, by the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Charles	"I mean to go with you, [MASK], for I am of no more use at home than you are. If I were to shut myself up for ever with the child, I should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	I deserved none. He enquired after you very particularly; asked even if you were personally altered, little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter." [MASK] smiled, and let it pass. It was too pleasing a blunder for a reproach.
<name>Wentworth</name>	Wentworth	Sophia	Yes, here I am, [MASK], quite ready to make a foolish match. Anybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking. A little beauty, and a few smiles, and a few compliments to the navy, and I am a lost man.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	So, you are come at last! I began to think I should never see you. I am so ill I can hardly speak. I have not seen a creature the whole morning!" "I am sorry to find you unwell," replied [MASK].
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	[MASK] could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief, and was only the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend's usual state of mind. There was one circumstance in the history of her grievances of particular irritation.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Mary	it is over!" she repeated to herself again and again, in nervous gratitude. "The worst is over!" [MASK] talked, but she could not attend. She had seen him. They had met. They had been once more in the same room.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	There was never any burst of feeling, any warmth of indignation or delight, at the evil or good of others. This, to [MASK], was a decided imperfection. Her early impressions were incurable. She prized the frank, the open-hearted, the eager character beyond all others.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Louisa	He had not seen [MASK]; and was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her from an interview, that he did not press for it at all; and, on the contrary, seemed to have a plan of going away for a week or ten days, till her head was stronger.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Louisa	Perhaps he had quitted the field, had given [MASK] up, had ceased to love, had found he did not love her. She could not endure the idea of treachery or levity, or anything akin to ill usage between him and his friend.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	Though I have forgot the exact terms, I have a perfect impression of the general meaning. But it shows you the man. Mark his professions to my poor husband. Can any thing be stronger?" [MASK] could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of finding such words applied to her father.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Anne	I shall have done in five minutes." "There is no hurry on my side. I am only ready whenever you are. I am in very good anchorage here," (smiling at [MASK],) "well supplied, and want for nothing.
<name>Willoughby</name>	Willoughby	Benwick	"Granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men (which, however, I do not think I shall grant), it does not apply to [MASK]. He has not been forced upon any exertion.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	[MASK] could not help laughing. "That cannot be much to your taste, I know," said she; "but I do believe him to be an excellent young man." "To be sure he is.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Anne	[MASK] listened, but without quite understanding it. Allowances, large allowances, she knew, must be made for the ideas of those who spoke. She heard it all under embellishment. All that sounded extravagant or irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin but in the language of the relators.
<name>Bath</name>	Bath	Bath	I assure you I feel it none. She is nothing to me, compared with you;" and she was in full time to hear her father say, "My dear madam, this must not be. As yet, you have seen nothing of [MASK].
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Louisa	[MASK] with a zeal above the common claims of regard, for his sake; and she hoped he would not long be so unjust as to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend. In the meanwhile she was in the carriage.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Anne	"I am going home, and you have an engagement with your friend. To-night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party," (turning to [MASK].) "We had your sister's card yesterday, and I understood
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	"And yet," said [MASK] to herself, as they now moved forward to meet the party, "he has not, perhaps, a more sorrowing heart than I have. I cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever. He is younger than
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Charles	Talks of his being going on so well! How does he know that he is going on well, or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence? I did not think [MASK] would have been so unfeeling.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Charles	[MASK], in the meanwhile, was very decidedly declaring his resolution of calling on his aunt, now that he was so near; and very evidently, though more fearfully, trying to induce his wife to go too.
<name>Michaelmas</name>	Michaelmas	Michaelmas	"The last time I saw her she had a red nose, but I hope that may not happen every day." "Oh! no, that must have been quite accidental. In general she has been in very good health and very good looks since [MASK]."
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Charles	I do not know what he would be at. We asked him to come home with us for a day or two: [MASK] undertook to give him some shooting, and he seemed quite delighted, and, for my part, I thought it was all settled; when behold!
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	I hope his letter does not breathe the spirit of an ill-used man." "Not at all, not at all; there is not an oath or a murmur from beginning to end." [MASK] looked down to hide her smile. "
<name>Frederica</name>	Frederica	Frederick	Her answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions were at first unconsciously given. They had travelled half their way along the rough lane, before she was quite awake to what they said. She then found them talking of "[MASK]."
<name>Benwick</name>	Benwick	Benwick	Nobody doubts it; and I hope you do not think I am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and pleasures as myself. I have a great value for [MASK]; and when one can but get him to talk, he has plenty to say.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	She turned through the same gate, but could not see them. [MASK] found a nice seat for her, on a dry sunny bank, under the hedge-row, in which she had no doubt of their still being, in some spot or other.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Harville	"We will write the letter we were talking of, [MASK], now, if you will give me materials." Materials were at hand, on a separate table; he went to it, and nearly turning his back to them all, was engrossed by writing.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mary	If it depended only on my inclination, ma'am, the party at home (excepting on [MASK]'s account) would not be the smallest impediment. I have no pleasure in the sort of meeting, and should be too happy to change it for a play, and with you.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	It was but a card party, it was but a mixture of those who had never met before, and those who met too often; a commonplace business, too numerous for intimacy, too small for variety; but [MASK] had never found an evening shorter.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Louisa	I could not leave it till [MASK]'s doing well was quite ascertained. I had been too deeply concerned in the mischief to be soon at peace. It had been my doing, solely mine. She would not have been obstinate if I had not been weak.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Walter	She spoke to him, ordered, entreated, and insisted in vain. Once she did contrive to push him away, but the boy had the greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly. "[MASK]," said she, "get down this moment.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Anne	"Your feelings may be the strongest," replied [MASK], "but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender. Man is more robust than woman, but he is not longer lived; which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Benwick	But there is nothing at all of that nature in the letter. He does not give the least fling at [MASK]; does not so much as say, 'I wonder at it, I have a reason of my own for wondering at it.'
<name>Maria</name>	Maria	Anne	She had something to suffer, perhaps, when they came into contact again, in seeing [MASK] restored to the rights of seniority, and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette; but she had a future to look forward to, of powerful consolation.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Anne	The two ladies continued to talk, to re-urge the same admitted truths, and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of a contrary practice as had fallen within their observation, but [MASK] heard nothing distinctly; it was only a buzz of words in her ear, her mind was in confusion.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	If he were a little spoilt by such universal, such eager admiration, who could wonder? These were some of the thoughts which occupied [MASK], while her fingers were mechanically at work, proceeding for half an hour together, equally without error, and without consciousness.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	"Go to him, go to him," cried [MASK], "for heaven's sake go to him. I can support her myself. Leave me, and go to him. Rub her hands, rub her temples; here are salts; take them, take them."
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Anne	The evening ended with dancing. On its being proposed, [MASK] offered her services, as usual; and though her eyes would sometimes fill with tears as she sat at the instrument, she was extremely glad to be employed, and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved.
<name>I</name>	I	Sophy	Shabby fellows, both of them! I am glad they are not on this side of the way. [MASK] cannot bear them. They played me a pitiful trick once: got away with some of my best men. I will tell you the whole story another time.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	It was spoken with enthusiasm. "Had you?" cried he, catching the same tone; "I honour you!" And there was silence between them for a little while. [MASK] could not immediately fall into a quotation again.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Edward	"I was six weeks with [MASK]," said he, "and saw him happy. I could have no other pleasure. I deserved none. He enquired after you very particularly; asked even if you were personally altered, little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter."
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	All this is much, very much in favour of their happiness; more than perhaps--" He stopped. A sudden recollection seemed to occur, and to give him some taste of that emotion which was reddening [MASK]'s cheeks and fixing her eyes on the ground.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	I was sure that would come out, if it was so. Depend upon it, that is a circumstance which his servants take care to publish, wherever he goes. But, [MASK], only conceive how extraordinary! I wish I had looked at him more.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	She sat an hour with me on Monday evening, and gave me the whole history." "The whole history," repeated [MASK], laughing. "She could not make a very long history, I think, of one such little article of unfounded news."
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Elizabeth	[MASK] had nothing to propose of deeper efficacy. She felt herself ill-used and unfortunate, as did her father; and they were neither of them able to devise any means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity, or relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Anne	She said nothing, therefore, till he was out of the room, but as soon as there was only [MASK] to hear-- "So you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves, with this poor sick child; and not a creature coming near us all the evening!
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Henrietta	They praised the morning; gloried in the sea; sympathized in the delight of the fresh-feeling breeze--and were silent; till [MASK] suddenly began again with-- "Oh! yes,--I am quite convinced that, with very few exceptions, the sea-air always does good.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	[MASK] entered it with a sinking heart, anticipating an imprisonment of many months, and anxiously saying to herself, "Oh! when shall I leave you again?" A degree of unexpected cordiality, however, in the welcome she received, did her good.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	How was [MASK] to set all these matters to rights? She could do little more than listen patiently, soften every grievance, and excuse each to the other; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary between such near neighbours, and make those hints broadest which were meant for her sister's benefit.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Louisa	A few days had made a change indeed! If [MASK] recovered, it would all be well again. More than former happiness would be restored. There could not be a doubt, to her mind there was none, of what would follow her recovery.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Anne	Nay," said [MASK], "I have no particular enquiry to make about her. I have always understood they were not a happy couple. But I should like to know why, at that time of his life, he should slight my father's acquaintance as he did.
<name>Norbury</name>	Norbury	Elliot	If he does, however, they will leave me in peace, which may be a decent equivalent for the reversion. He is worse than last year. "I wish I had any name but [MASK]. I am sick of it.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Anne	She loved [MASK] better than she loved her own abilities; and when the awkwardness of the beginning was over, found little hardship in attaching herself as a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	[MASK] wondered whether it ever occurred to him now, to question the justness of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage of firmness of character; and whether it might not strike him that, like all other qualities of the mind, it should have its proportions and limits.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Mary	His declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family, has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me." This decision checked [MASK]'s eagerness, and stopped her short in the midst of the Elliot countenance.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Anne	but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound. "Altered beyond his knowledge." [MASK] fully submitted, in silent, deep mortification. Doubtless it was so, and she could take no revenge, for he was not altered, or not for the worse.
