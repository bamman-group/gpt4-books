<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Caldonia	But the words did not matter to [MASK]; she was young, un- happy with the courtship prospects all about her, and so even had he talked all afternoon of planting and harvesting tobacco, it would have been a serenade.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Rita	[MASK], once the box was open all the way, covered her eyes because even that weak light in the storeroom was too much for her to bear. “Don’t send me back. Don’t send me back.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Counsel	That was just [MASK], pokin at me. He can afford to take pokes at me. And they really wanted to please you. Make you happy.” “It hurts me to think about it,” she said, and began to cry.
<name>Snopes</name>	Snopes	Counsel	In the end, after [MASK] had tried to drive the animals away, there was not much more than the land, and even that, more than a year later when creditors and others were brave enough to go on it, would be sold for a little less than 45 percent of what it was worth.
<name>Miz</name>	Miz	Adele	she asked the man. “Yessum,” he said, raising his hat, “and I do preciate em. [MASK] fixed them up right nice. Just the way I like em. I’m gonna finish up that back fence a yours tomorrow.
<name>He</name>	He	Priscilla	[MASK] said when he entered. She had been dreaming that she was in a strange house, not her cabin, not her mistress’s house, and someone had knocked and she had gone to open the door and welcome the stranger to what she realized as she walked was her own house.
<name>He</name>	He	Stamford	Now get on in the house fore you catch your death.” The girl went inside. [MASK] emptied out what rain had collected in the bucket since the girl left her home. He walked toward where he knew the blueberries were, again the only person in the lane.
<name>Kunta</name>	Kunta	Michael	The slave was alone in his row, his full sack around his neck, and for a long time people worked on and did not notice that [MASK] had disappeared. “You make a soft place for me in the bye
<name>Temple</name>	Temple	Robbins	“Whatever you are, I know you are there,” [MASK] said. “Come out if you’re nigger, and if you are white, tell me your name and I’ll leave you to it.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Delphie	He had drunk some of the brew the day before and his head was paining him. His vision was blurry. It was Sunday afternoon and it was raining. He didn’t remember where he had been, but he was heading now to [MASK]’s cabin.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Moses	Why would you take ourfuture and just throw it away? He clenched and unclenched his hands. He knew the way back home, but could he reach them way out there somewhere and still find his way back? Oh, [MASK], why?
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Counsel	It had generous portions of meat. [MASK] was too hungry to ask what the meat was. The woman set a spoon beside the pan. “Biscuits, too,” the boy said to his mother. “Don’t forget the goddamn biscuits.”
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Robbins	He went to the shed for her gardening hat and all she would need to make it through. The sound of [MASK]’s leaving was no more. She sighed and looked down to the road where the white man had gone. A month to teach him to write his name.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Henry	“I had nothing in mind beyond a pleasant afternoon and early evening when I invited [MASK] to supper with some of my former students. I believe it was a little less than a year since I began teaching him and he was still my student.
<name>Boo</name>	Boo	Augustus	“I ain’t done nothin that any white man wouldn’t do. I ain’t broke no law. I ain’t. You listen here.” Beside the door, [MASK] had several racks of walking sticks, one under the other, about ten in all.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Philomena	The owners of the boardinghouse were with [MASK] when he returned to her room. The side of her face was bloating, turning purple with each moment, but he didn’t know what color it was because the lamp on that side of the room had gone out.
<name>Teague</name>	Teague	Moses	“Don’t touch my wife. [MASK], I done told you she ain’t got it in her today. I’ll do her share, maybe Sunday, maybe nighttime. I done told you she ain’t got it in her. Let her be.”
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Moses	And, too, he had a strong sense that whatever had happened, [MASK] was involved. “I am beginning to see that as a possibility,” he said, raising his hat and running his hand along the brim.
<name>He</name>	He	Jebediah	He thought nothing of it at first, just doctored the wound with a little mud and some spiderwebs. But the wound festered, and in the end, they had to saw off [MASK]’s right foot to save his life, or so the white doctor said.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Patrick	“I need it bad.” The cards had not been falling right for [MASK] that week. He had already lost $53 and owed one evil man $11 more, so he thought he would have better luck with that man’s wife.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Delores	Just take me away from this.” He stepped on, slowed down by the mud. As he neared his cabin, another door opened and [MASK], seven years old, came out of her place with a bucket in her hand.
<name>Simon</name>	Simon	Henry	A few women had cried, remembering the way [MASK] smiled or how he would join them in singing or thinking that the death of anyone, good or bad, master or not, cut down one more tree in the life forest that shielded them from their own death; but most said or did nothing.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Marse	She tried going around him but he followed her. “Leave me be or I’ll send you to hell,” he said and raised both fists to her face. “Oh, [MASK], I’m just goin to feed my chickens,” she said.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Mildred	But the light was not in her words. So he and [MASK] came down the steps to offer their own condolences. They went through the crowd, hugging men and women, kissing the faces of the children, for they had come to know them over the years.
<name>Blue</name>	Blue	Moses	“Baby dead baby dead baby dead,” she would chant. “Christmas oranges Christmas oranges Christmas oranges in the mornin. ” “I don’t want no foolishness from you, woman,” [MASK] said now.
<name>Joad</name>	Joad	Hiram	“A man of everything,” [MASK], the man, said. “I like men of everything.” “That ain’t what he said, Pa. He ain’t done everything and I don’t know why you make it out to be so.”
<name>Amos</name>	Amos	Augustus	He himself did not own any slaves but had been to enough auctions to know that having a slave open his mouth was one of the first things a potential buyer did. [MASK] mumbled and put his open hand to the back of his ear. He mumbled some more.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Robbins	“Good,” [MASK] said. “Let us wait a week and see what price this will be.” “It will not be a child’s price. I can practically teach children in my sleep.” “Tell him nothing about this and I will pay the price of a man.
<name>Reverend</name>	Reverend	Moffett	[MASK], Sunday after Sunday, had but one theme—that heaven was nearer than anyone realized and that one step away from the righteous path could take heaven away forever. “Hang on,” he liked to say, “just hang on, cause heaven is right over there.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Belton	“No. Come along, [MASK],” he said to the Negro, but the slave did not move. “Please. Two hundred dollars. What you want me to do, give him awayr “That would be a good notion.
<name>Blue</name>	Blue	William	She called him “[MASK]” for the first time when the child was a week old and he did not correct her, came to enjoy the way his name flowed out of her mouth and seemed to swirl about in the air like some meaningless song before his brain registered and told him that was his name.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Stennis	He can talk clear as a bird singin in the tree, clear as—” “All right, [MASK], thas anough of that. I wouldn’t lie to you, mister.” “I don’t want a deaf-and-dumb nigger.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Alice	He did not know it, but [MASK], a woman people said had lost her mind, was watching him now, only the first time in her six months of wandering about in the night that she had come upon him.
<name>Lucinda</name>	Lucinda	Loretta	“I am ready for bed,” she said, and that made the greatest of sense. Before going to bed, she washed her insides with vinegar and the soap her slaves made for everyone. Hers, however, was made with a dash of perfume that [MASK] supplied to the soap makers.
<name>Sylvie</name>	Sylvie	Delores	“What you doin out here in all this mess?” “Goin to get some blueberries,” [MASK] said. In one part of the world, way off to the right of the cabins, lightning came and went quickly before the man or the girl knew what had happened.
<name>Lucinda</name>	Lucinda	Rita	He meant for her not to let the boy go too many steps beyond his property. He would have called [MASK] by name but she had not distinguished herself enough in his life for him to remember the name he had given her at birth.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Henry	“You keep your head down and that ain’t right,” [MASK] said. He took the pepper shaker in his right hand, extended his arm before him and moved the arm from right to left. Everyone at the table was now watching him.
<name>John</name>	John	Travis	After nearly an hour, [MASK] got off the animal, and walking with the reins in his hand, he stood at the fire. His horse was slightly uncomfortable but he turned and reassured it that everything was good and the animal calmed.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Maude	[MASK] had policies on all her slaves. Riding away that day, the Atlas man noted in his mind that next time he would have to insist on seeing the mistress of the house and not settle on an answer from a male relative who did not know the benefits of Atlas products.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Henry	A tombstone had been ordered, but the man had said that it might take a month for it to be delivered. Standing at the foot of [MASK]’s grave, she wished she had brought flowers from her garden. “Am I forgiven?” she said.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Fern	Fed by light streaming in from windows that went from the floor to a foot shy of the ceiling, the trees in [MASK]’s parlor grew to a height of about eight or nine feet, then stopped, as if on command.
<name>Santiago</name>	Santiago	Elias	[MASK] would wake in the night and hear the wind counting off the days he had to live. “Better play. Better play,” the wind told him, “cause ain’t no more after today.”
<name>she</name>	she	Moses	They ate their supper together the next day at the edge of the field, and when he was done, he told her he had to speak to the master and he got up from beside her and walked out of the field and [MASK] didn’t ask him what he was doing or where he was going.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Stamford	The rain never let up. The lightning had not moved, and as [MASK] ran toward it, the lightning flowed down to the ground so that it was now a line of fire laid out across the grass, which did not burn.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Moses	Had he not been her slave, he might have gotten up and went to her just on the authority of last night. But the sun did not rise very high in [MASK]’s life, and it was only one day at a time and no one day was kin to the next.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Moffett	[MASK] came up the short lane at his place and before he was even five yards from his little house he could hear his wife and her sister arguing. The dog was dead so there was no one to greet him.
<name>Boon</name>	Boon	Travis	“Master dead master dead master died.” “I’m gettin plenty tired of seein you out here like this,” [MASK] said. “I never sleep good after I see this thing dancin in the road. My skin start crawlin.”
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Elias	[MASK] had never believed in a sane God and so had never questioned a world where colored people could be the owners of slaves, and if at that moment, in the near dark, he had sprouted wings, he would not have questioned that either.
<name>rest</name>	rest	Loretta	He put his arm around her but she said she was tired, and when he did not withdraw, she pulled away. They sat for several more minutes before she said again she was tired and needed [MASK] and he got up and left.
<name>Nettie</name>	Nettie	Moses	but I wasn’t there like he was there. He said to me that first day, he said, ‘[MASK], we gon start with the kitchen. A wife needs a place to fix her meals for her family. Thas where we gon start.’
<name>Cholly</name>	Cholly	Henry	[MASK] was, too, but he never got old enough to lose that boyish facade colored men have before they settle into being handsome and unafraid, before they learn that death is as near as a shadow and go about living their lives accordingly.
<name>Samuel</name>	Samuel	Counsel	[MASK] shook the sorrel from the gun and rested it over the pommel. The black man kept on talking, and his talking, just above a whisper, was very loud in the forest, even with all the people and the animals.
<name>John</name>	John	Counsel	He raised the pistol and shot the horse between the eyes. The horse sank on two knees and moaned and [MASK] fired once more and the horse collapsed. Its breathing was heavy and he prepared to fire again but soon the breathing stopped. “Why is coming so hard?”
<name>Evans</name>	Evans	Priscilla	He did not pause at the mention of [MASK], but it came back to her that the three were missing, and for the first time, with the words “my wife,” she had a momentary thought that he might be involved.
<name>Shoemaker</name>	Shoemaker	Oden	[MASK] was a full-blooded Cherokee. He had four black slaves. One was his “mother-in-law.” Another was his “wife,” who was half-Cherokee herself, and the other two were their children.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Henry	One of them started talking—they would not remember which one it was—all about [MASK], from his birth to his death, starting a weeks-long project of recalling all that they could about their son.
<name>Earl</name>	Earl	Moses	Gotta clean some a that stink off first.” He slapped her. It was not a hard hit but she went to her knees nevertheless because the slap came with years of abuse and rejection. “Why you gotta treat me this way, [MASK]?
<name>Rocco</name>	Rocco	Patrick	The night [MASK] was killed he had had a choice—go down to the bottom and spend the night playing cards or go through that man’s bedroom window where the wife was waiting, all wet and hungry and everything.
<name>George</name>	George	Moses	[MASK], just before he opened his cabin door, said again, “We gotta meet that mule tomorrow mornin. You want me to tell her we got somebody down here who don’t do what I tell him?”
<name>Sarah</name>	Sarah	Maude	But in the early days of his freedom, the young man had met [MASK] and married and they had started to build a life for themselves, a little land here, one or two slaves there. A child.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Maude	[MASK] went back inside, then she returned in moments. “I want you to know that I have a legacy for you, whether you want it or not. “I really don’t.” He waited for her to remind him that he lived in her house, which was run by slaves.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Minerva	He brushed down his horse and left him in the barn in the back and walked home. [MASK] was sitting in the porch swing and she waved to him and he felt all over again that feeling he had had the morning he saw her after her birthday.
<name>Rosa</name>	Rosa	Adele	Just the way I like em. I’m gonna finish up that back fence a yours tomorrow. [MASK] wants to know when you comin by.” “Tell her I will see her soon. Please give my best to her.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Counsel	The man had no slaves, only free Negroes he hired when he needed them. [MASK] found himself strangely uncomfortable around blacks who toiled but were not slaves, people who came and went as they pleased. He said nothing, needing the money to be able to push on.
<name>Boo</name>	Boo	Darcy	There had been no trouble, “air undisturbed” was how he put it, but after [MASK] left the county the sheriff had discovered a dead Negro child on the side of the road, “not a member of our community, as far as we can tell.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Calvin	His droning on and on was a bit soothing, far more than [MASK]’s hand on her arm or the children’s smiling up at her. His talking told her in some odd way that one day the pain would at least be cut in half.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Stennis	“You think I was too hard with the bargainin, [MASK].” “No, Master, I think you was right on the money.” “Hmm. Well, we best get to beddin down with this fella.
<name>Granny</name>	Granny	Augustus	“Nobody never told me the wrong of that.” “Why should anybody haveta teach you the wrong, son?” [MASK] said. “Ain’t you got eyes to see it without me tellin you?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Skiffington	The hair on the man’s face was wild and quite abundant, and as [MASK] got closer he made out the eyes and nose and mouth poking through the hair. Only the hair told him it was a white man, because the skin was too dirty to bear witness to that.
<name>John</name>	John	Moffett	His unhappy wife had let it be known to her sister that she would not care if the sister slept with [MASK]. But once the sister had done so, an unexpected rage took hold of the wife and the two would argue all day and late into the night.
<name>He</name>	He	Counsel	And then take your hide besides.” He reached for the gun but the man turned away. “Don’t you make me mad,” he said to his father. “You know what happens when you make me mad.” [MASK] opened the door and stepped out.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Clarence	I sure can’t, and [MASK] can make less sense than me.” A few chickens scurried as they made their way to the barn. Her long black hair was slightly unkempt, and he saw that it would have taken only a few brush strokes to make it pleasing.
<name>Alabama</name>	Alabama	Stamford	“But, sugar, it’s me, your sweet [MASK]. You don’t mean that.” She tapped him twice on the top of the head and the dust and dirt on the wood flew about and then settled on his head.
<name>Tituba</name>	Tituba	Henry	“Go tell em [MASK] dead.” He nodded. He was barefoot. They both knew where he was on the pole of who was and was not important on the Townsend plantation, so he did not tarry when she told him to do something.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Moses	We had this and that and this and that, so why, [MASK]? He followed them, walking at first, then running, one arm before him to keep the low-hanging branches from hitting him in the face.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Maude	A child. [MASK] kept reminding him what a kind man his parents’ master was and so his family’s bondage was not the burden it was for many other slaves. “You were there,” she said.
<name>He</name>	He	Moses	If her, then why not others who might have seen him in the woods? What would they think and what would they tell the mistress? [MASK] be alone out there in them woods, playin with hisself. No woman, no nothin, just hisself and hisself alone.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Moses	[MASK] noticed she was standing and stood. He was quiet and she kissed him, for no other reason than that he was now silent. When she withdrew, he realized he should go. He wanted sex because he needed to be able to walk through that back door again without knocking.
<name>Jody</name>	Jody	Moses	He paused before leaving the fields as the evening quiet wrapped itself about him. The mule quivered, wanting home and rest. [MASK] closed his eyes and bent down and took a pinch of the soil and ate it with no more thought than if it were a spot of cornbread.
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Counsel	But the vegetation continued and so did the thundering in his head. [MASK] looked to the left and the right, hoping for a way to avoid the growth but there were just long lines of green that he felt would take days to pass. The horse began to balk.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Rita	He believed whistling inside or outside the house was bad luck, but right then as he worked, he was tempted to whistle. Finally, he turned to [MASK], held out his hand and helped her up onto the wagon and into the box.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Priscilla	He washed before he came the next evening, stood at the well and poured water over himself and scrubbed with his hands as [MASK] his wife watched, laughed. “Just gonna get all that dirt all over you again tomorrow.”
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Fern	“Marry nothing beneath you,” her mother always said, meaning no one darker than herself, and [MASK] had not. Her mother would not have approved of the gambler who lost a leg. “Human beings should never go back. They should always go forward.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Oden	“Yes, it would be,” [MASK] said. “Just remember I gotta charge you for the other ear. Thas only fair. But I’ll do the rest of that one for nothin. Won’t cost you a cent.”
<name>She</name>	She	Elias	She had to have some man so why not him. “You best get some sleep.” Dare he raise his eyes that high? Dare he, dare he? “I don’t wanna have to come out here and tell you again.” [MASK] did not move.
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Elias	The sparrows were no longer flying, just chirping somewhere above their heads. [MASK] could see them in his mind, arranging the straw and turning around and around on it to make a place smooth enough to be a home to the eggs.
<name>Yunior</name>	Yunior	Skiffington	While [MASK] was hopeful about the boy’s progress, he was not blind. There had to be a problem with a boy sucking three fingers at a time at twelve years old and afraid to leave his mother’s side because the demons would eat his private parts.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Henry	They had heard their mother shouting and then their father shouting and then they had heard [MASK] screaming. He went to them and told them everything would be fine and, within a few minutes, they began to believe him.
<name>George</name>	George	Counsel	The inside last night was easily seventy-five feet by fifty feet. [MASK] thought he should go back to the barn and try to start the day all over again, but the thought of the boy made him want to get away.
<name>Sighing</name>	Sighing	Sighing	she asked as they waited. “Your husband been owin me $500, thas all there is to it.” She would have sighed but that was not in her nature. [MASK] was an indication of surrender, of approaching helplessness. She folded her arms.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Mildred	“I will try to find him, [MASK], and bring him home to you. It is a crime what happened and the law will stand by that.” “I know it will.” “Why didn’t you tell me he was missing?”
<name>Zeke</name>	Zeke	Robbins	I got my free papers.” He told her that in a world where people believed in a God they could not see and pretended the wind was his voice, paper meant nothing, that it had only the power that he, [MASK], would give it.
<name>Sheriff</name>	Sheriff	Counsel	He could see [MASK] sitting at his desk, cleaning his gun and whistling. “I knew nothing, I can promise you that.” “None a that matters anymore, sheriff.” She went by him and to the back door.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Augustus	[MASK] wanted to say again that he was a free man, but he was in too much pain, and the words would not have come through anyway because his mouth was full of blood and no sooner had he spat some out, his mouth filled up again.
<name>She</name>	She	Skiffington	but she thought it too hideous to be in her house. Heading the legend were the words “The Known World.” [MASK] suspected the Russian, a man with a white beard down to his stomach, was a Jew but he could not tell a Jew from any other white man.
<name>John</name>	John	Henry	His feelings were all the looking he needed, [MASK] realized. And he realized, too, that what was happening was better than chains. He had them together, bound one strong man to a woman with a twisted leg, and there was not a chain in sight.
<name>Essie</name>	Essie	Alice	After a time, [MASK] went down the way the men had come. She shook the dirt of the road from her frock. She wouldn’t get back to her cabin until about four-thirty that morning; several times in the past she had not gotten home until about noon.
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Moses	“She might need lockin up every night just so them patrollers don’t do somethin to her.” “The sheriff and his patrollers have said nothing to me. Has someone said something to you, [MASK]?”
<name>James</name>	James	Moses	Well into the forest the rain came in torrents through the trees and their mighty summer leaves, and after a bit [MASK] stopped and held out his hands and collected water that he washed over his face. Then he undressed down to his nakedness and lay down.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Henry	“It depends on what kinda heart he got in him. But,” and he took the reins, “I’ll come back and do the rest of that ear and won’t charge you.” [MASK] nodded.
