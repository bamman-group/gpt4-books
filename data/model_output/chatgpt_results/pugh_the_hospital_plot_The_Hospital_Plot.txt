<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Aaron	a voice came from the crowd that was congregating. Momentarily disturbed by a new attack, [MASK] took his eyes off the three men. When he did, a crunching blow to his head from the wooden cane toppled him over the chair and onto the sidewalk.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Aaron	Then they split up. There were only two rows of pews. [MASK] slipped quietly up to the altar and hid behind it. He could hear someone quietly approaching him right in front of the altar-piece. He held his breath and eased to the side.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Everett	“You don’t believe me, [MASK], do you? Do you? None of you do.” “It doesn’t matter what I believe now. I know we’ve got a good chance to clear you of the murder if we leave that part of the story alone.
<name>Rincewind</name>	Rincewind	Aaron	It groaned and creaked, then suddenly the disc gave way. Wherever he was, it was pitch black, blacker than the tunnel. He flicked the light on to get his bearings and was relieved to find it was the janitor's closet. [MASK] took out his diagram and studied it carefully.
<name>honey</name>	honey	Aaron	she gasped excitedly. “Yeah, why not? We’ve never really been anywhere for a real vacation. Always too busy.” “Oh, [MASK],” she said, holding him tighter. “Can we really go? What about your work?”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Aaron	“Believe it, young man, because the moment you forget it, you’re dead. Everything you need I have upstairs. Come by this afternoon. West side of the building at exactly three o’clock. I'll drop it to you in a little waterproof plastic bag. OK?” [MASK] nodded.
<name>You</name>	You	Rita	We have more opportunities than ever before. It’s not the best situation we can ask for, but it’s what we’ve got now, and that’s what counts, if we take advantage of it.” “[MASK], you don’t understand.
<name>his father</name>	his father	Rita	His thoughts were on his people only. Once he thought his friends would back him up, to the very end, have faith in him, but now he was thinking about himself. He could see that neither [MASK] nor his friends were in his corner any longer.
<name>Marvin</name>	Marvin	Wakefield	The chalk it up as a natural cause. I saw the man just a couple of days before he passed away. He was talking, laughing and telling dirty jokes all over the ward. He was talented with clay. He was black. Name was [MASK]."
<name>her</name>	her	Rita	“OK, I’ll see if any news has come in, and I’ll also talk to [MASK]. I know she must feel like hell right now.” “Yeah, do that for me, will you, man? Tell her everything is alright, OK?”
<name>her</name> (Note: There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to a female person who was previously mentioned or known to the speakers.)	her (Note: There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to a female person who was previously mentioned or known to the speakers.)	Rita	Have you talked to [MASK]?” “We called her. She was kinda worried, and she told me to talk with you about you-know-what.” “I don’t have much time, someone’s coming for me now.”
<name>Warhol</name>	Warhol	Carl	Surprisingly enough, they looked almost exactly like the texture of a completed canvas. Under the printed eye-dazzling colors, small mounds puffed out to give the impression of textured paint. It was fine work, the finishing expertly done. [MASK] must have gotten a patent for his process, he decided.
<name>Dr. Hannibal Lecter</name>	Dr. Hannibal Lecter	McCloskey	You’ve heard about psychosurgery well, [MASK] and his SRS are using some of the same techniques to carry out another phase of their plan. They’re also using drugs. I’ve got some literature on both methods right here.” He pointed to the books.
<name>Edgar</name>	Edgar	Colonel	He was literally shocked to death by multiple stimulations of the electrodes. That was why he looked so strange. This method of programming, [MASK] believed, would be used to control the few blacks who would be kept around to do the whites' bidding—dirty work.
<name>Chet</name>	Chet	Everett	[MASK] was stocky like his brother, but with more definition to his large physique. He was clean-cut, with a well-shaped Fu Manchu mustache that came just below his lower lip. His hair was cut short, his face was full, dark, and smooth.
<name>Dr. Benway</name>	Dr. Benway	Colonel	She put her hand on his shoulder. “Maybe you're getting worked up over fantasies in his mind that just sound convincing. It sounds too way out to me, almost like some science fiction story. Let me give you some background on [MASK].
<name>Van Gogh</name>	Van Gogh	Aaron	This thought was not created by him, but by his fellow inmates. Rumors floated around that after [MASK] was executed all of his paintings and sketches would be worth a lot of money. He would go down in history as a mad, martryed artist.
<name>Stonewall</name>	Stonewall	Healy	[MASK] had a stone face that seldom changed expression. His eyes, too, were expressionless; cold, blue spheres of stagnant water, no ripples, no waves, just the same old placid stillness. It was hard to tell just what he thought or felt.
<name>The well-dressed man</name>	The well-dressed man	Aaron	The two players near the front glanced back between shots to see what was happening. [MASK] banked the 8-ball in an opposite corner shot to win the game. The well-dressed man just looked at him and smiled. They played two more games.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Rita	[MASK] frowned. “Ha! Ha!” he howled. “You should have seen your face. I was just kidding. No paints, no brushes, no charcoal, no nothing, but me and you. We can go on a honeymoon.”
<name>He</name>	He	Aaron	He came in. She turned around, and they looked at each other for a while, searching for battle scars. [MASK] walked over, palmed her hips gently, and planted a kiss on her mouth. “You're not mad anymore?”
<name>John</name>	John	McCloskey	The key to the success and safety of the project was no defection, an unbroken chain—and who would defect? What respectable white man would turn his land over to a band of savages? [MASK] had nursed his ideas like a baby, and watched them grow.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Aaron	There was still no furniture in it. "What are we stopping here for?” [MASK] demanded. “Just a precaution,” he answered. “We don't want to be seen around here too much, or they might get wise.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Aaron	“Quite sure. He told us where they were with hardly any trouble, and he didn’t have all of the papers he told you he had, so he was a little off.” Good, [MASK] thought, they only had the papers.
<name>Damien Hirst</name>	Damien Hirst	Chatman	This year though it is speculated by a journalist who saw some of [MASK]’s entries, he plans to “cheat” the art lovers by putting cheap pieces on display, hoping that his reputation will carry him through the stiff competition.
<name>Ling</name>	Ling	Aaron	“You remembered, huh?” he said, crinkling his face into a smile. “I thought you would. I can tell you are very observant. Very observant. My name’s Colonel.” [MASK] shot him a suspicious look. “Really!
<name>Perry</name>	Perry	Everett	“This is highly irregular, these Perry Mason tactics!" "Your Honor," [MASK] stated, “in the interest of justice the court must hear all of the evidence available.” “Motion granted,” the judge decreed.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Carl	I’ll never be free, if I don’t do what my own mind tells me to do. I can’t be dictated by popular opinion." "Then you're in trouble. Big trouble!” [MASK] snorted, and gave him a sympathetic look.
<name>he</name>	he	Silas	“He told me all about it.” “That’s just it,” [MASK] replied. “We can’t find a copy of his discharge records. They’ve disappeared.” “Yeah, I thought as much.
<name>The interrogator</name>	The interrogator	Calhoun	We have him, he won’t be able to pass on the information that might have caused us trouble. He was intercepted by us before he could slip vital documents to outside sources." “Have you retrieved the lost documents that this patient secured?” [MASK] asked.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Aaron	He was half-asleep. “Just dropped by to see how you were doing. I tried to call a couple of times last week, but no answer.” “Come on in, man. Come in.” He waved [MASK] into the spotless living room.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no name provided in the passage)	unknown (There is no name provided in the passage)	Fontaine	Well, this guy, his name is [MASK], came to. my office and said that he wanted a passin’ grade. I told him where to go. He said if I didn’t, he would tell everyone that we were havin' an affair.”
<name>John</name>	John	Aaron	He should have no trouble from the white receptionist in the lobby. She wouldn't know if he had visited before or not, because all blacks looked alike to whites anyway. [MASK] couldn’t use the Colonel's name, because he never had visitors and it would look suspicious.
<name>him</name>	him	Aaron	What do you think about it?” “At first I didn’t believe that story but now—I just don’t know. One thing about [MASK]. He may be sensitive, changeable, and have his hangups, but I don’t think he’d lie.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Silas	He extended his hand. “Meet a poor, ridiculed man.” “You mean a poor, dumb-ass, ridiculed man,” [MASK] said, seizing his hand and shaking it. “Listen man, I’ve got to go now.”
<name>Mr. Johnson</name>	Mr. Johnson	McCloskey	[MASK] sat complacently, sure of himself. "Well, sir, an alarm signal was activated from my private office at about 11:30 p.m. The guards summoned me immediately. We have a very sophisticated protection system, and—” “Why is that?”
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Aaron	“We at least have something to work on now. Don’t you think it’s possible, just possible, that you love [MASK] so much that you’re building up a mental block?” “What do you mean?”
<name>George</name>	George	Aaron	"Yeah, that’s his name. Well, anyway, I pulled him over to the side to see if I could help. He said he was poor and couldn’t afford a jock strap.” [MASK] chuckled lightly.
<name>Tom Robinson</name>	Tom Robinson	Grier	[MASK] tried his best to look as if he was still grieving, and that it hurt him to talk about that night. He kept looking over to the jury for sympathy. In the audience, the guard's widow cried during the entire testimony.
<name>visitors</name>	visitors	Colonel	The stepped-up security was incorporated to keep outsiders out and to keep a good watch on the insiders, so no one would become wise. It grew harder to move through the various wards for [MASK] now because everyone was wearing nameplates and had to be identified.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Aaron	He finished the beer, packed his sack, and covered his incomplete painting. The fresh air felt good on his face and in his nostrils. [MASK] felt good; he felt sorry for those who were dead and couldn't enjoy a day like this.
<name>he</name>	he	Colonel	I need your help for something. I can talk here but not for long, because this room I know is not bugged.” “What in the hell would a room be bugged for around here?” “Trust me,” was all [MASK] said.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Aaron	Isn’t she working?” “Yeah, but she was going to meet me at the fair at twelve. She never showed.” [MASK] bolted up, despite his aching head. “She didn’t get tangled up in that fight, did she?”
<name>something</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	something (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Aaron	“Pictures?” “Yeah.” By now the two men shooting near the counter were visibly slowing down their game, and moving around to the side of the table where they could listen better. They looked remarkably alike. They knew [MASK] was no regular.
<name>he</name>	he	Aaron	They both felt that way. After all, they would be legally married after seven years anyway, according to Illinois law. “Why get married before,” [MASK] would argue. “Might as well not rush anything. See if it’s going to last first.”
<name>probably</name>	probably	Aaron	He doesn't say anything about sterilization or mind control.” “He could have meant other methods, [MASK], like oral contraceptives, technological control of population density in urban areas, or even—” “Yeah, he could have meant that, but I know better.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Aaron	He sounded happy. “In here, [MASK],” she yelled over the running water and music. He came in. She turned around, and they looked at each other for a while, searching for battle scars.
<name>Van Gogh</name>	Van Gogh	Picasso	Sometimes that can happen, but not usually so drastically. Even [MASK] had his periods, but then you could tell his style, his strokes. There is nothing similar about these paintings except, as you said, they were done by the same man.”
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Everett	Am I correct?” [MASK] got up from his seat and walked steadily toward the doctor. “Well, yes and no. You see, usually only acute cases of psychosis and schizophrenia resort to uncontrollable violence that may result in death.”
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Carl	she asked, diverting his attention from the shadows. “No, not all day. I thought I’d go over to see [MASK], and to the art supply store. v They reached the end of the corridor.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Jamal	“Thanks, both of you. How in the hell did you get me here?” “Well, after [MASK] came over to help you out, I saw the commo- tion and ran over as fast as I could because I knew that was your spot.
<name>Basquiat</name>	Basquiat	Aaron	He tasted the bittersweet blood. “You know what we mean, you dirty black bastard. You’re the damn Enema Man. What ya got in your pockets?" He patted the pockets on [MASK]’s jacket, taking out paint tubes, and charcoal.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Silas	Here, sit next to me. Do you want some coffee or a drink?" "N “No, there’s no time now. We’ve got to locate those films!” He faced [MASK]. “Maybe they didn't get them from him.
<name>She</name>	She	Rita	That it’s growing at an alarming rate, affecting one out of every fifteen thousand blacks, and at the present rate of growth will, in all probability, increase to one out of three hundred in a span of fifteen years.” [MASK] couldn't believe her ears.
<name>George</name>	George	Aaron	Weren’t unfair housing and employment destructive? [MASK] realized his mistakes. Realization of what he had been doing caused him to make the big change. It must happen that way within each individual, he thought—the realization, then the change.
<name>Wolfsheim</name>	Wolfsheim	Picasso	You got a reputation to hold up. Last year reporters from all kinds of papers were saying that you were the one going to put [MASK] out of business.” “Yeah, but I’ve changed since then.” “You look the same to me.
<name>his</name>	his	Aaron	The children always rejuvenated them. She knew, however, that a child would demand too much of her and [MASK]’s time—time their professions would not allow them to give. So, she thought, it was better that she was barren.
<name>the protagonist</name>	the protagonist	McCloskey	He mentioned a few states, but no names. He also mentioned two doctors who had joined the crew, but I can’t remember their names. One of [MASK]’s staff members was worried about their loyalty. Something about them taking over the entire project.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Aaron	We’re going to get you on a defacing charge, too, if we can place you at the scenes.” [MASK] tried to spring up, but the other uniformed officer held his arm and restrained him. His head was spinning again.
<name>he</name>	he	Aaron	“Good. Say, listen, who’s payin’ forthis round?” “I’ll get this one,” [MASK] volunteered, pulling his wallet from his pocket. When the drinks came they sipped and talked about the old times; school, work.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Everett	His loneliness stemmed from the growing awareness of his utter helplessness. He could tell by the look on [MASK]’s face that things were not all in his favor. There must be a lack of evidence to clear him.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Aaron	[MASK] asked. The man quietly and cautiously eased his bald head back into the room, and closed the door. His face was brown and speckled like a pecan nut shell. “I said, what’s your name, young fella?” he repeated in a raspy whisper.
<name>me</name>	me	Aaron	Well, maybe you're setting up a defense mechanism to block out the possibility of such a plot hatching, purely to protect him. You don’t want to believe something like this could happen, and affect you and [MASK], because you know the terrible consequences.
<name>Tony</name>	Tony	Aaron	Oh, yeah, by the way, they burned your car too.” “What!” [MASK] yelled, jumping to his feet. "Yeah, it’s a total loss. We got back to the stoop and the place was in an uproar.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Silas	[MASK] inquired. “How about something to eat?” “Eat? OK, but let’s get* somethin’ on our stomachs first.” He stretched his neck and raised a hand. “Waiter! Over here.” The waiter scurried over.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Aaron	After [MASK] put the finishing touches on the portrait he walked over and showed it to the woman, smiled, and pressed ten dollars into her hand. “That’s for posing,” he said. The woman just stared oddly at the sketch, not frowning, not saying anything.
<name>Malcolm</name>	Malcolm	Aaron	You're going to be shot trying to save black mankind. A deranged martyr. It’s beautiful.” “No, not quite,” [MASK] said, staring at the pile of papers on the desk. They were thicker than two telephone books.
<name>they</name>	they	Chatman	“The bruises'he had are easily explained since he fell down the elevator shaft. I’m not worried about your friends, [MASK], they have no proof.” He patted the papers affectionately. “So there you are. Take him out.”
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Aaron	[MASK] was becoming very angry, first, because the man had interrupted his good work, and second, because he was barging in uninvited. “I represent a couple of newspapers that would like to do a special feature on you just before the art fair.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Gregory	And presto! The rest was easy. We got the name of the men in the organization and all the other information. “Since [MASK] was the one just out of jail, you figured he would be easier to crack, right?”
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Aaron	That’s probably where he got all of those terms he used on you to make his fantasy convincing. He doesn't talk much, very rarely. [MASK], don’t take him seriously. Really.” She saw the anger and frustration in his eyes.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Sy	“[MASK], you can really lie your ass off. My problem is not like that at all. The fair doesn’t bother me. You know what it is? I’m tired, man. Tired of being a goddamn phony."
<name>Florence</name>	Florence	Rita	In the emergency room, operating rooms, the basement, the psychiatric and maternity wards, and yes, even the supply closets. [MASK] had noticed the mistreatment of patients, especially blacks on welfare, the inefficient surgeons, and the strange medical practices.
<name>Lena</name>	Lena	Silas	* "I don’t know, but as far as I can tell, it’s supposed to be something big. Something to do with special training." “Why do they want to send you then?” [MASK] teased, giggling.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Aaron	[MASK] heard, but he didn’t want to answer for fear his vibrating voice would hurt his head more. After a while, he said, “What in the hell happened to me anyway? Goddamn! My head is killing me."
<name>Delilah</name>	Delilah	Aaron	She cupped both of them in her hands as she stood before [MASK], licking her orange lips with her sharp little tongue. “Maybe you’d like to investigate the other benefits that accompany my offer,” she breathed, pressing her pink nipples against his chest and rolling her round belly on his propped knee.
<name>Bella</name>	Bella	Aaron	At least until I can straighten this out. I wanted her to go out of town, I'm worried about her safety.” “But she won’t go, right?” [MASK]’s expression sagged. “No, not exactly.”
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Aaron	“What for?” "It’s too dangerous here. I’m taking you out of the city, out of the country, if possible.” “What the hell are you talking about [MASK]. What are the books for?”
<name>the guard</name>	the guard	Appleton	OK, you mean he took the gun out of your hand, shot the other guard, then had enough time to knock you on the head?” “No, we struggled.” “He shot [MASK] while you and he were struggling?”
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Colonel	Under the folders were lists of names and addresses. [MASK] quickly copied each name and address on his white hospital clothing. There were six names in all. Putting the folders back in their orig- inal position and locking the drawer, he silently retreated to his room.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Aaron	We get railroaded every day. I felt like a disgrace to the profession. I’m going to put what little reputation I have on the line for you, [MASK]. But please, please tell me the truth. That’s all I ask, man.”
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Aaron	[MASK] was silent for a long while. His throat throbbed painfully. “What about the papers?” Were they found on him?” “No, nothing. All he had was a loose gown on."
<name>George</name>	George	Aaron	Both were about [MASK]’s age, but they looked older. They looked so much alike they could have passed for brothers; pot-bellied, short-haired, dark-skinned, big-boned. Both wore sweatshirts.
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Silas	“The drink,” he would say, “always straightens me out from a week-end drunk.” [MASK] used sick days, personal business days, death-in-the-family, and religious holidays as excuses for being absent on Mondays.
<name>Dr. Benway</name>	Dr. Benway	Rita	Things just weren’t the same. The place had changed from a charitable, trustworthy medical institution into a secretive, inefficient slaughterhouse. [MASK] blamed most of the trouble on incompetence and unprofessionalism. Welfare recipients were treated like animals, given inferior care.
<name>unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name.)	unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name.)	McCloskey	Just like you’re going to do.” “You won’t get away with it, [MASK]. I have legal friends who know I'm here. They’ll expose you 'cause they know what your little game is. They’ll get you for me.”
<name>Butch</name>	Butch	Kinney	Do you know what we do with unskilled surgeons?” "1-1 have no idea, sir.” He was visibly shaken. “I’ll tell you, [MASK].” He puffed another cloud of strong smoke toward the frail guard’s nostrils.
<name>Lawyer</name>	Lawyer	Everett	And he was so strong, like a crazy man, or something.” “I object, Your Honor,” [MASK] yelled, jumping to his feet. “The witness is not qualified to diagnose the defendant’s mental condition.” “Objection sustained.”
<name>he</name>	he	Aaron	He rose clumsily from a bench in the rear of the room, tugged on his suit coat, and strode confidently to the witness stand. As he walked, [MASK] eyed him contemptuously, his eyes burning. Here was the man who was trying to destroy him and his people.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Aaron	“If you could have seen the operation, you would know what I mean.” Sweat seeped from [MASK]’s swollen face and his eyes were glassy and red. “At exactly three o’clock he’s going to give me all the information I need to put all of those sons of bitches away forever.
<name>The artist</name>	The artist	Aaron	He made the paint bleed so that the surface layers seeped through the upper layers of pigment, just as the men’s inner beauty and radiance shone through their rough exteriors. [MASK] was totally immersed in a sea of color until the doorbell rang. Who can that be?
<name>he</name>	he	Colonel	If it wasn’t for him, you might have been hurt even more.” “You really believe someone deliberately pushed the shelf on me? You believe what [MASK] says? Then how do you know he just happened along?” “Now, wait?”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Aaron	"Listen, you guys,” [MASK] said, “you’ve been more than brothers to me and I’ll never forget it. I’ll write you and everything.” “When in the hell are you cornin’ back?”
<name>Santiago</name>	Santiago	Rita	The mention of [MASK]’s safety had jolted a tender nerve in him. He wondered if all of this was a dream. It had been so quick and so unreal. What in the hell was the old man talking about? Who were “they”?
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Aaron	He opened his lids, feeling that he had been dreaming ail night. "It’s beautiful, [MASK], really beautiful,” she kept saying, as he tried to focus his weary eyes on her beaming face above. “Your portrait of me is really beautiful.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Everett	“Don’t give up hope,” [MASK] said. “Whatever you do, don’t give it up. It’s the only thing we have going for us now. I like to think that all of my clients have faith in me, even if they don’t.”
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Aaron	“Right after I left you this mornin’ [MASK], she invited me over for lunch. When I called to tell her what time I’d be there she asked me what I was bringin’ to eat.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Aaron	“That’s the problem with memorizing testimony, especially one that's not true,” he said in [MASK]’s ear. "As soon as you make a slip and you’re caught, you'll make it again, trying to stick to the new story you've created.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Aaron	“What was that?” “Tripped.” The other guard’s flashlight went out suddenly. [MASK] could hear him battering the light against his palm, trying to make it come back on. The man cursed and the hammering stopped.
<name>him</name>	him	Aaron	He almost fell off the bench as he leaned over to look [MASK] dead in the face. “Oh, I ain’t been doin' so bad," the second answered. “Business is kinda slow, ya know.”
