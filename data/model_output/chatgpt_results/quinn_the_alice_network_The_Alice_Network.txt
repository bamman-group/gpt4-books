<name>Jamie</name>	Jamie	Finn	Subtract one Scot and one armed-and-dangerous Englishwoman from this equation, and I could conduct my insane quest by my insane self, unhampered by my even more demonstrably insane traveling companions. “Today,” I said aloud, and [MASK] looked at me over his shoulder.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Eve	[MASK] nodded, filing that away. She unrolled her tiny blank message and began swiftly threading it through the hem of her handkerchief instead. “Your classmates are taking target practice,” the captain observed. “Why not you?”
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Eve	I hadn’t been able to answer [MASK]’s question. I was too shocked, taking the photograph and stumbling back to my room in complete silence. I felt as though I’d been hit by a boulder, lying across my bed limp and crushed under the weight.
<name>whoever</name>	whoever	Finn	“The son of a bitch got his wish. He opened his second restaurant down the bank, with this view.” She went striding off down the cobbled street. I looked at [MASK], and we both shrugged in unison, wandering after her.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Eve	I said it without a hitch, laying a casual hand on his arm so the clerk would see my wedding ring. As [MASK] had said, selling a story is done by reciting the little details without any flubs.
<name>Rudolf</name>	Rudolf	Rose	You got [MASK] killed. An SS officer had given the order to fire, and a German soldier had pulled the trigger—but my cousin would never have been targeted at all if not for this man in his elegant suit and silver-headed cane.
<name>the doctor</name>	the doctor	Rene	The pain came and went, but the terror was constant. Sometimes she cowered with tears sliding down her face, and sometimes she was able to sit upright in her soiled chair and meet [MASK]’s eyes. In either state, she had stopped answering his questions.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Lili	Mothers will tell you children are the most satisfying of all vocations, but merde',' [MASK] said frankly, “they’re too dulled by never-ending routine to know better. I will take the risk of bullets over the certainty of soiled nappies any day.”
<name>Kate</name>	Kate	Eve	Her reports on artillery positions come so quickly and accurately, we can see them bombed in a matter of days. Quite remarkable. She’s the best we have, male or female.” [MASK]’s sense of competition stirred hungrily. I will be the best.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Eve	“Good evening.” [MASK] struck open the door of the parlor, deciding on formality. “I am most surprised to see you, C-C-C—” Her right hand clutched into a fist, and she managed to get it out.
<name>Lisbeth</name>	Lisbeth	Eve	It was a filthy business, and [MASK] was going right back to it, but hopefully she could distract him from that for a few hours yet. She turned in his arms, so close that her damp lashes brushed his cheek. “Is there tea?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Eve	[MASK]’s heart beat again like a gong as the German sentry flicked his eyes over the safe-conduct pass. It had no identifying photograph, it was just a piece of paper allowing passage—they all looked alike; surely he wouldn’t notice the same one twice . . .
<name>someone</name>	someone	Rene	She cried out again. Her mind had snapped; she’d gone utterly mad. Or [MASK] gave me something, she thought, something in the brandy— But that thought flew away, gone before she could grasp it or make truth of it. The peacock spoke again.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Lili	“Tell me,” she said instead. “We d-d-didn’t get much news about the war, inside p-prison, and now no one wants to go over old battles. [MASK]’s last message, the one about the Verdun assault.”
<name>Camille</name>	Camille	Eve	I don’t believe you have the nerve for murder. That broken piss-stained little thing I last saw sobbing her heart out on my Aubusson couldn’t so much as lift her head, much less a pistol.” [MASK] flinched deep in her bones.
<name>football</name>	football	Bentleys	A pause. “I like bairns. Always wanted a few.” We let that hang in the air a moment before tiptoeing around it. “What else do you like?” I asked, giving him my other foot. “Besides [MASK].”
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Lili	Pointing in annoyance to the sentry. “We’ve already shown them there.” The captain put out his hand. “You will show me, nonetheless.” [MASK] bristled, an offended little French housewife. “Who are you—” He glowered.
<name>Colette</name>	Colette	Eve	“No, monsieur.” [MASK] moved a discarded pair of wineglasses onto her tray, one empty, one with a few swallows of perfect golden wine inside. She kept her eyes on that wine, because anything was better than looking at her employer.
<name>Jean Louise</name>	Jean Louise	Tante	A husband and two sons dead. She’d lost so much. Be kind. I didn’t want to be kind, but at least I managed not to say the things I was thinking. I just said stiffly, “No, [MASK], I can’t stay.
<name>he</name>	he	Rene	She banished the thought as [MASK] bent his head. Don’t recoil. He leaned close, inhaling along the line of her throat, and then he straightened with a faint moue. “Perhaps a bath. You may avail yourself of my facilities.”
<name>you</name>	you	Eve	He’d shaved, put on a jacket (worn at the elbows but a handsome dark blue), and his shoes had been shined to a gleam. “Come to dinner with me,” he said without preamble. “I didn’t think [MASK] would come down to eat tonight.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Maman	“When it’s not an easy promise you can make and then break, just to get me moving?” The elevator chimed, doors sliding open. [MASK] glared at the curious bellhop, and he picked up our luggage and scuttled toward the hotel desk.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Finn	“I saw some bad things,” [MASK] said, “during the last year of the war.” He stopped for so long, I thought he wasn’t going to say anything else. “I have a temper,” he said finally. I smiled.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Violette	More murmurs of agreement, assurances spoken over eyes full of worry. [MASK] clutched the rosary so hard its looped beads cut into her fingers. “She’ll be out of bed within a week. Less than a week. . .”
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Rene	“Yes, it’s me,” she called. Come up. [MASK]’s study blazed with light, though the shades were drawn. The fireplace spilled warmth across the patterned Aubusson rug, and the multicolored Tiffany shade threw patterns of sapphire and amethyst onto the green silk wall.
<name>someone</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	someone (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	Cameron	That surprised him. “I thought [MASK] might be trying to talk you out of obeying that order. He can be sneaky that way. It happens, you know, when military men mess about too long in a dirty business like spying. They get underhanded.”
<name>Danny</name>	Danny	Finn	I bought her, fixed her up, and she liked me right away.” [MASK] thumped the seat, affectionate. “During the war, most of the soldiers I knew had pictures of their lasses. Maybe their mother, if they were fresh out of school.
<name>Angus</name>	Angus	Finn	“Come on,” [MASK] muttered to a stubborn lug nut or screw head or whatever it was. His Scots burr got thicker, as it always did when he was trying to persuade the car to cooperate. “Rusty aud bitch . ..”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Grandmamans	I—I pawned [MASK] pearls.” The shame of that stung me suddenly; the only thing I had of my mother’s mother, and I’d traded it away for a wild goose chase. “I can get them back, I promise.
<name>Orwell</name>	Orwell	Eve	That was the thing that struck [MASK] most. Any recruiting poster for the fighting troops showed you a line of identical Tommies, stalwart and sturdy, faceless in their similarity. That was the ideal soldier: a line, a regiment, a battalion of strong men all exactly alike.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Eve	Wished what? That he wasn’t married? [MASK] was too much of a mess to step into the place at his side even if that place was empty. That they could find a bed and curl up together anyway?
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Finn	When grief came for either of us, it wound its way through the night and became part of the sweetness. I haven’t known you long enough to be this crazy about you, I thought, watching [MASK]’s profile in the soft light. But I am.
<name>India</name>	India	Violette	I’d completely forgotten. It had to be from [MASK]. My heart was suddenly pounding for entirely new reasons as I snatched the paper. The words were terse, even for a telegram. Lie confirmed. A Mile. Tellicr responsible. Golden choirs erupted in my head.
<name>Dr. Mandelet</name>	Dr. Mandelet	Eve	A woman might be dying slowly of fever or blood poisoning, shrieking with pain over a broken bone, writhing in the agony of giving birth—the door still wouldn’t open until dawn. A good many died that way. That was, [MASK] supposed dully, the entire point.
<name>Littlefinger</name>	Littlefinger	Rene	[MASK] is not. He didn’t pull the trigger, but he certainly did his best to arrange your cousin’s death.” I couldn’t move. I couldn’t speak. I couldn’t even breathe. I sat staring down at that smug face.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Eve	She wore a shapeless dishrag-colored smock, and she made a face at it. “Quelle horreur. What I’d give for something in pink moire!” “And a morally questionable hat?” [MASK] managed to say. “I’d settle for some morally questionable soap.
<name>Jamie</name>	Jamie	Finn	“I thought if the police saw he’d been a collaborator, they might not look too hard for whoever had killed him. Robbery or retribution, they’d just... let it be.” [MASK] kissed the back of my neck. “Cunning lassie.”
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Rose	“Oh, [MASK].” In my imagination, she gave an impish smile and a toss of her chin to the street outside. Go. “Go where?” I said aloud. But I already knew.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Rose	I rested my chin on my arms, watching fields go by and wondering why the landscape seemed familiar, until something clicked. Another motoring trip, [MASK]’s family and mine, a couple of years after the time we got left behind at the Proven9al cafe.
<name>Stanton</name>	Stanton	Cameron	Maybe guilt and grief could not be sated until justice had its turn first. Maybe it was the cold spy-trained part of her brain whispering that despite [MASK]’s decades-long lie, an enemy was still out there to be dealt with.
<name>Anastasia</name>	Anastasia	Eve	“I know I should give you more time to heal,” he said with his faint smile. “But you are very tempting. Do you mind?” “No,” [MASK] said, because what else could she say?
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Eve	“You cannot be serious.” No one had addressed [MASK], but she answered anyway. “I’ll go where I’m ordered. I have a job to do.” “Your job is done.”
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Rose	I remembered [MASK]’s last letter to me. She was giddy about a boy she was seeing on the sly . . . “What boy?” “Etienne something. Just nineteen, a bookshop clerk. A nobody. She brought him to meet us once.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Violette	‘“Its black enchantments, its hellish cortege of alarms, its cups of poison and its tears, its din of chains and dead mens bones . . “You’re rambling,” [MASK] said. “Try to lie quiet.”
<name>Camilla</name>	Camilla	Eve	How [MASK] managed not to jump at the sound of her real name, she did not know. But she managed, sipping more elderflower fire. “I have always appreciated good taste and elegance in my companions,” he continued.
<name>Tante</name>	Tante	Rose	I had money, savings—why couldn’t we buy ourselves a new beginning, where two false Madames with two false wedding rings could make some kind of honest life? I thought of the Provencal cafe where I’d spent the happiest day of my childhood at [MASK]’s side.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Maman	I wasn’t very pretty, but my parents still seemed to have lofty plans for me: white gloves, a proper school, and becoming a Lovely Bride someday. [MASK] had already told me that if I was lucky, I’d be engaged by the time I was twenty, just like her.
<name>McGonagall</name>	McGonagall	Violette	[MASK] must have seen some flash of her relief, because surprise flickered behind those round glasses. “You look glad to see me,” she commented, scraping mud off her worn boots. She frowned, adding, “Is there news?”
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Eve	Astounding to think it was a woman.” [MASK] just repeated, “I told you n-n—” Her faulty tongue was failing on the most important word she ever had to speak, stuttering in a panic so far past ordinary terror that she barely felt it at all.
<name>Willow</name>	Willow	Finn	“I’m not letting her burn up the rest of her life just to take that old bastard out.” “But it’s her life, isn’t it?” [MASK]’s fingers slid inside mine, so our hands slowly interlaced.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Eve	Now, do you have any idea how to prevent yourself from becoming enceinte?” “Yes.” [MASK] had a sharp memory, at twelve years old, of coming on her mother in the washroom late at night rinsing herself out between the legs.
<name>Mark</name>	Mark	Eve	“You’ll get the rest after we talk to your friends,” I said just as sweetly. “Or else you’d probably go on a bender and leave me high and dry.” “Probably,” [MASK] agreed. But I wondered, despite my own words.
<name>Natasha</name>	Natasha	Lili	Especially a woman. Sometimes I take an armload of parcels and bags and drop every single one as I try to find my identity cards, chatting all the while, and they wave me through out of sheer irritation.” [MASK] exhaled a long stream of smoke.
<name>Camille</name>	Camille	Rose	“Why is it always about being pretty with us?” [MASK] exclaimed, still glaring over the stunning view of vines and sky. “Don’t you like being pretty? I wish I were.” “Well, of course I like it.
<name>She</name>	She	Eve	Now I knew: he’d been her lover. [MASK] had climbed into bed with the enemy to spy on him. I looked at her, her proud ravaged face and soldierly stride down the cobbled street. She hadn’t been much older than me at the time.
<name>him</name>	him	Finn	She’d conducted that charade in the shop as smooth and cool as cream. And why had she gone through with that charade in the first place? I studied her as she held her cigarette out to [MASK] and he struck a match for her.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Finn	So I kept moving to the music, song after song, and [MASK] nursed his single beer and watched me, and it probably would have been all right if not for the Gypsy woman. I’d stepped away from the dancing to retie my sandal.
<name>generations</name>	generations	Eve	That he had ensured it to continue after his death, tied it up in his will in a private bequest without his family’s knowledge and separate from his widow’s funds. That it was well-invested, the earnest solicitor intoned, and should continue for [MASK]’s life.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Eve	I’d cast a fishing line into the water; now all I could do was wait and see if anything came up on the other end. I wondered, going upstairs, if I should tell [MASK] what I’d done, but answered myself with a resounding No.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Eve	He took the blame for her, but who knows what really happened?” The major looked rather pleased at [MASK]’s expression. “Don’t suppose he told you about the prison sentence, eh?” A wink. “Or the wife.”
<name>Mr. Antolini</name>	Mr. Antolini	Finn	We’ve got a great many plans for the future, and I want you both to be part of them.” My mother began to flutter and my father fluttered too in his more reserved way as [MASK] offered a hand and I made further introductions.
<name>Indiana</name>	Indiana	Lili	You might see him at some point, you know—he passes through German-held territory occasionally, doing something fearfully secret. If he does, promise me you’ll do your best to tear all that tweed off him.” “[MASK]!”
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Rose	CEJAPTEP T1 CMAPLIE M^4 IQ47 nother night falling, the second since I’d found out [MASK] was dead. I still feared what I’d see in my dreams, but I didn’t want to drink myself into oblivion again. My head had only just stopped throbbing.
<name>Danny</name>	Danny	Finn	“You—lousy—little—shite—” he said with quiet precision, punctuating each word with his fist. The short efficient blows sounded like a meat mallet falling. “[MASK]!” My heart thudded.
<name>Dill</name>	Dill	Rose	I could see her trying to be rational, the big girl of eleven who knew so much more than me. But then she whispered, as if she couldn’t help it, “What if they don’t come back?” I think I realized then why [MASK] was such a friend to me.
<name>Mayella</name>	Mayella	Eve	I gasped, taking a half step forward, but I might as well not have been there for all the attention the two women paid me. [MASK] stood a moment with spittle trickling down her cheek, and then she peeled off her glove and deliberately wiped her face.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Charlotte	“It’s not for us to do, [MASK]. It’s a job for your father.” “Why? I’ve been doing a pretty good job on my own, better than—” “It’s not suitable,” my mother snapped.
<name>Raffles</name>	Raffles	Finn	A moment later the defeated pawnbroker was counting a great many crisp banknotes into my hand, and my pearls disappeared behind his counter; we turned to see [MASK] holding the door with a grin that only showed around his eyes. “My lady?”
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Lili	The thought held no envy—it was what made them both good at what they did now. [MASK]’s job was to be anyone, to shift with a few tricks of posture or grammar from one persona to another, whether seamstress or laundress or cheese seller.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Charlotte	I can’t do anything for you. I’m not fit to have you. Everyone says so. What do you think? the L.P. answered. I didn’t have an answer, just a massive lump in my throat. “[MASK]?” “Coming.”
<name>Scobie</name>	Scobie	Finn	My face must have betrayed my nervousness because [MASK] said rather gently, “Want an escort, miss?” I did, but a lurking Scotsman who needed a shave wasn’t going to make me look any more respectable, so I shook my head as I swung out of the car.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Finn	I hadn’t had it figured out yet, but then the Little Problem came along and shot my mother’s plans and mine all to pieces. “Making change for cups of coffee.” [MASK] cracked a smile. “That’s a bonny way to spend a war.”
<name>she</name>	she	Eve	Now that [MASK] had her fingers splinted and her shoulder dressed, had pills for pain and pills to keep infection away, we decided to lay low. “She needs time to heal,” I said, because she was still alarmingly apathetic when she wasn’t being foul tempered.
<name>Indiana</name>	Indiana	Finn	“All we have is a few chance remarks made more than thirty years ago.” “Has anyone h-h-here got a better idea of where to start?” Admittedly, I didn’t. I shrugged. [MASK] reached for the set of maps crumpled at my feet.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Lili	If she wants to kill herself, she could have rented another room two streets down; we’d never know where. Or she could have gone to [MASK]’s grave, or—” “Her note said home.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Rene	She saw [MASK]’s shining shoes approach, saw the small marble bust swinging rather casually from his hand as he came to stand, breathing hard, between her and the door. “Well,” she managed to say through pain-clenched teeth, clutching her trembling hand.
<name>Stephanie</name>	Stephanie	Eve	Still that dull thwack, as though she was knocking something against the wall. Hopefully not her head, I thought, and rapped softly. “[MASK]?” The thwacks kept going. “Don’t aim that pistol at me. Em coming in.”
<name>Countess</name>	Countess	CHARLIE	That told her something: he was still frightened of her. You should be, she thought. “Shall I drive you to the doorstep, madame?” “I’ll walk,” she said, and swung out of the cab. CHAPTER 41 [MASK] I’m sorry,
<name>Mr. Roarke</name>	Mr. Roarke	Finn	I stumbled into a threadbare chamber, and was stopped, swaying and tear blurred, by the sight of the bed. “I’m going to dream,” I whispered as [MASK] came up behind me. “As soon as I go to sleep I’m going to dream.
<name>Lili</name>	Lili	Eve	Her every screaming nerve focused on the next room where there was no sound—none at all—from the leader of the Alice Network. They wont know she’s its leader. [MASK] thought harshly. They don’t know what a prize they have in her.
<name>Hitler</name>	Hitler	Eve	How did I suddenly feel so small and helpless when I’d spent my last few days breaking [MASK]’s door down, getting a Luger pointed at my face, crossing the Channel. . . ? I straightened in my chair, marshaling arguments.
<name>he</name>	he	Lili	They pressed their way toward the sentry checking tickets and identity cards, but the crush was fierce, and the train already there, chuffing like a horse impatient to be off, and the sentries were meticulous with so much high brass on the platform. “Let me do the talking,” [MASK] said.
<name>Mary Mallon</name>	Mary Mallon	Eve	The guards shooed the prisoners away, but [MASK] was still under observation for typhus symptoms. She was just a corridor and a locked door away when the moans came, and the whimpers, and the strangled screams. The sounds of a woman being operated upon without ether, without chloroform, without morphine.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Charlotte	She turned, giving me a tight smile. “Please, [MASK]? You’re already in so much trouble with your father. I will be too, if there are any more delays about this, so please just stop misbehaving and come along.”
<name>he</name>	he	Eve	He smiled, and it made years fall away from him. Soon he’d be guilt-torn and conscience-struck, [MASK] knew, lashing himself for taking advantage of his subordinate’s innocence and his wife’s absence, but for the moment he was content.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Rose	[MASK], where are you7. We wandered back the way we’d come. I peered through the window of a burned-out hotel, and saw furniture inside—small tables thick with dust, chaises for waiting guests, abandoned countertops where desk clerks must have presided.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Lib	“Maybe so,” [MASK] said. “But lovemaking is a skill like any other, you know. A bad man can be a good carpenter or a good hat-maker or a good lover. The skill has nothing to do with the soul.”
<name>Samantha</name>	Samantha	Eve	There was a peacock in the shade, tail fanned out in a thousand hues of blue and green glass, and [MASK] cried out as the peacock turned its head. Its glittering eyes found hers, and every eye in its tail feathers turned to look at her too.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Finn	“Stay with me—” And we were tangled up along the leather seat, the important parts of my black dress all yanked out of the way, [MASK]’s shirt and belt on the floor. This was normally when my mind slid away from what was happening.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Eve	Next time just code it quickly for me.” “I spent four hours doing th-that,” [MASK] said, crestfallen. “The new ones always put about six times the effort they should into the first message.”
<name>June</name>	June	Eve	So he just passed on your cousin’s name, and the town where he already knew she went on weekends, and took care of her that way.” [MASK] tilted her head. “In fairness, he couldn’t have known the entire town would be massacred.
<name>Mr. Durant</name>	Mr. Durant	Eve	“Is the restaurant not to open?” “Not today.” He marked his book with a strip of embroidered silk and laid it aside. [MASK] felt a chill, though his smile was pleasant. “I intended it as a surprise for you.”
<name>Mrs. Dubose</name>	Mrs. Dubose	Eve	“The American invasion is still here, I see.” I turned. [MASK] stood in the doorway in the same print house-dress she’d worn last night, her graying hair loose and wild, and her eyes bloodshot.
<name>Frau Schmidt</name>	Frau Schmidt	Eve	The bark of a German voice, German boots behind her. “It is past curfew.” “I have an exemption.” [MASK] scrabbled in her handbag for her identity cards and the various other bits of paper.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Rose	My French aunt had always been slender, scented, blond like [MASK]. An invalid, but the Greta Garbo kind, all pretty lace bed jackets and a delicate cough. The woman before me was horribly thin, gray haired, dressed in a soiled sweater and a drab skirt.
<name>Grindelwald</name>	Grindelwald	Lili	You’ll laugh yourself right into a f-firing squad.” “Bah.” [MASK] gave a wave of her hand, a hand so thin it was nearly transparent in the sunlight. “I know I’ll be caught one day, but who cares?
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	mademoiselle	Partly in exasperation, partly in pity. “This is no place for a young girl,” he said, snapping his fingers at the clerks to issue a new safe-conduct pass. “You were very foolish, [MASK], but I’m sorry about all this unpleasantness.”
<name>Abby</name>	Abby	Eve	An expressive shrug. “You’re going to be fine.” [MASK] cut her off before she could go further. “You have to be.” It was what she’d clung to for more than two years.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Eve	I’d liked [MASK]’s stories of him. The major looked at me, face reddening, and he opened his mouth as if to argue, but all at once he deflated. “Fine,” he said, fumbling in his pocket.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Eve	When [MASK] heard the low drone of aeroplanes, she thought her heart would stop. For a moment it was just a buzz, like hovering bees, and then she saw them, two aeroplanes in formation like eagles.
