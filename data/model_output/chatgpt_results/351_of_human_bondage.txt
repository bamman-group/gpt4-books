<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Philip	[MASK]'s heart gave a great thud against his ribs, and he let the door handle go. The door swung to. "Why not?" "He says we couldn't, not on your money."
<name>Mr. Bentley</name>	Mr. Bentley	Lawson	He was growing a little impatient of [MASK]'s peremptory advice and wanted to be by himself. At the end of the week he went up to the model and on the pretence that his drawing was not finished asked whether he would come and sit to him one day.
<name>his opponent</name>	his opponent	Philip	He had a mind that delighted in dialectics, and he forced [MASK] to contradict himself; he pushed him into corners from which he could only escape by damaging concessions; he tripped him up with logic and battered him with authorities.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Philip	Notwithstanding the war there was evidently much difficulty in finding work, for when [MASK] went to the shop many men were waiting already. He recognised some whom he had seen in his own searching, and there was one whom he had noticed lying about the park in the afternoon.
<name>darling</name>	darling	Philip	She gave him a sidelong glance. "You don't grudge me a little pleasure, [MASK]? You see, it's the last time I shall be able to go anywhere for I don't know how long, and I had promised."
<name>darling</name>	darling	Philip	I don't want you to do anything unless you love me." He was a little horrified by her feeling that her body was a commodity which she could deliver indifferently as an acknowledgment for services rendered. "But I do want to, [MASK].
<name>Frau</name>	Frau	Cacilie	That's what made it so horrible. It filled one with disgust to think of it. "Bitte, bitte," said [MASK], with a rapid intake of the breath. "I won't listen to anything against him." "
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Philip	It was the first time that [MASK] in his lonely life had been present in a family circle: his eyes smiled as they rested on the fair children engrossed in the fairy tale. The life of his new friend, eccentric as it appeared at first glance, seemed now to have the beauty of perfect naturalness.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Philip	The thought horrified [MASK]. He found himself alone for a minute or two in the dining-room with the churchwarden. "I hope you'll be able to stay with your uncle a while," he said. "I don't think he ought to be left alone just yet.
<name>Christopher</name>	Christopher	Philip	The diagnosis of dangerous illness would be accepted by one with a laugh and a joke, by another with dumb despair. [MASK] found that he was less shy with these people than he had ever been with others; he felt not exactly sympathy, for sympathy suggests condescension; but he felt at home with them.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Philip	I let him come to tea because he bothered so, but I knew I'd say no." [MASK] was so surprised that he found nothing to say. There was a queer feeling in his heart; he did not know what it was, unless it was happiness.
<name>The narrator</name>	The narrator	Philip	I can have the best of everything at home. I don't want you to think I work because I need to." [MASK] knew that she was not speaking the truth. The gentility of her class made her use this pretence to avoid the stigma attached to earning her living.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Athelny	He did not know what prevented him from going there sooner, except perhaps that he wanted so badly to get through on his own; for [MASK], who had been in straits as desperate, was the only person who could do anything for him.
<name>the listener</name>	the listener	Philip	Those old patriarchs lived to a jolly good old age, didn't they?" he said, with a queer little laugh in which [MASK] read a sort of timid appeal. The old man clung to life. Yet he believed implicitly all that his religion taught him.
<name>them</name>	them	Dunsford	Then he could not help himself, he hurried on to catch her up, eager and anxious, only to find that it was a total stranger. Men came back from the country, and he went with [MASK] to have tea at an A. B. C. shop.
<name>chaperon</name>	chaperon	Philip	She brought a chaperon with her; and to her [MASK], asked to make a fourth, was instructed to confine his attentions. He found this easy, since she turned out to be an agreeable chatterbox with an amusing tongue.
<name>Griffiths</name>	Griffiths	Lawson	Moreover, he took irresistible dislikes to the places where he had been miserable: he remembered the humiliation he had endured when he had waited in that studio, ravenous with hunger, for [MASK] to offer him a meal, and the last occasion when he had taken the five shillings off him.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Philip	[MASK]'s face fell at the headmaster's evident surprise. "You said you wouldn't put any objection in the way, sir," he answered. "I thought it was only a whim that I'd better humour. I know you're obstinate and headstrong.
<name>George</name>	George	Philip	"Come on then." [MASK] waited impatiently for the end of the performance. He had made up his mind exactly what to do, and when they got into the cab he passed his arm, as though almost by accident, round her waist.
<name>the patient</name>	the patient	Philip	The attendant gave a short laugh. "You'll soon get used to the smell. I don't notice it myself." He asked [MASK]'s name and looked at a list on the board. "You've got a leg--number four."
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Philip	He was sitting in the corner, well away from draughts, wearing the same shabby great-coat which [MASK] had never seen him without, with his old bowler on his head. "I eat here because I can be alone," he said.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	George	His face was earthy and death-like. "I say, old man, you look awfully ill. Is there anyone to look after you here?" "[MASK] brings me in a bottle of milk in the morning before he goes to his work."
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Mildred	He felt ashamed. He saw now that [MASK]'s cheeks were thick with rouge, her eyebrows were blackened; but she looked thin and ill, and the red on her cheeks exaggerated the greenish pallor of her skin. She stared at the paper fan in a listless fashion.
<name>Adrian</name>	Adrian	Winks	He was not bullied more than other boys of his size; and his deformity, withdrawing him from games, acquired for him an insignificance for which he was grateful. He was not popular, and he was very lonely. He spent a couple of terms with [MASK] in the Upper Third.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Lawson	It would be much better to commit suicide. He could not go on like that: [MASK] would help him when he knew what straits he was in; it was absurd to let his pride prevent him from asking for assistance. He wondered why he had come such a cropper.
<name>Basil</name>	Basil	Philip	I pity with all my heart the artist, whether he writes or paints, who is entirely dependent for subsistence upon his art." [MASK] quietly put away the various things which he had shown. "I'm afraid that sounds as if you didn't think I had much chance."
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Milly	Dear old man: I hardly know how to write to you and yet I feel I must write. I hope you're not awfully angry with me. I know I oughtn't to have gone away with [MASK], but I simply couldn't help myself.
<name>he</name>	he	Philip	She wore every day the same ugly brown dress, with the mud of the last wet day still caked on the hem and with the raggedness, which [MASK] had noticed the first time he saw her, still unmended.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mildred	His instinct was to leave them to themselves and go home, but he had not his hat and coat, and it would necessitate endless explanations. He went back. He felt a shadow of annoyance in [MASK]'s eyes when she saw him, and his heart sank.
<name>him</name>	him	Philip	It was a lovely day. A bluebottle buzzed against the windowpane. Suddenly there was a loud rattle, it made [MASK] start, it was horribly frightening; a movement passed through the limbs and the old man was dead. The machine had run down.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Cronshaw	[MASK] looked at him slowly, as if he were turning the inquiry over in his mind, and before he answered rapped on the marble table with one of the saucers. "Bring my bottle of whiskey," he called out.
<name>that</name>	that	L150	and I'm trying to work a portrait. How much would you ask if you were me? I don't want to frighten them, and then on the other hand I don't want to be such an ass as to ask [MASK] if they're quite willing to give L300.
<name>children</name>	children	talipes	His reading told him that whatever might have been done when he was a small boy, and then treatment of [MASK] was not as skilful as in the present day, there was small chance now of any great benefit.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Philip	She stopped crying and looked at him. "D'you mean to say that you could take me back after all that's happened?" [MASK] flushed a little in embarrassment at what he had to say. "I don't want you to mistake me.
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Philip	The old man was fighting with the fear of death. And [MASK] thought that all must go through that. Oh, how monstrous it was, and they could believe in a God that allowed his creatures to suffer such a cruel torture!
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Philip	and now he was given a locker. He looked at the boy who had accompanied him into the dissecting-room and saw that he was white. "Make you feel rotten?" [MASK] asked him. "I've never seen anyone dead before."
<name>Mr. Jones</name>	Mr. Jones	Philip	In the course of years it had diminished sadly, but it was still with the Vicar a subject for jesting. He talked of his wife as a rich woman and he constantly spoke of the 'nest egg.' "Oh, please take it, [MASK].
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Philip	[MASK] and I admired it very much." "Don't mention it," said the banker. He had noticed with satisfaction that it was larger than anyone's else. It had looked very well. They began to discuss the people who attended the funeral.
<name>Mr. Beebe</name>	Mr. Beebe	Hayward	"But aren't there any more pictures here?" asked [MASK], with the tourist's passion for thoroughness. "Nothing of the least consequence. You can come and look at them by yourself with your Baedeker."
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Philip	"It's lucky I've got some money on me. I'm afraid I've only got two pounds." He gave her the sovereigns. "I'll pay you back, [MASK]." "Oh, that's all right," he smiled.
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Philip	and she hid her face in [MASK]'s handkerchief. She tried hard to control herself. "Give me some more water," she said. She wiped her eyes. "I'm sorry to make such a fool of myself. I was so unprepared."
<name>George</name>	George	Chandler	[MASK] hesitated a moment awkwardly, then he went up to the man and said: "I'm very sorry this has happened." He held out his hand and the man, with an instinctive glance at his own to see if it was clean, shook it.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Cronshaw	He slipped his hand under [MASK]'s shirt and felt his heart; he did not know what to do; helplessly, because he had heard of this being done, he held a looking-glass in front of his mouth.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Philip	But I didn't care. Je suis libre, n'est-ce pas?" She was very fond of speaking French, which indeed she spoke well. "Once I had such a curious adventure there." She paused a little and [MASK] pressed her to tell it.
<name>The narrator</name>	The narrator	Philip	In his long career to how many dying persons must he have administered the consolations of religion! Perhaps he was like the doctor who could get no benefit from his own prescriptions. [MASK] was puzzled and shocked by that eager cleaving to the earth.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Mildred	The green of the forest in spring was more beautiful than anything he knew; it was like a song, and it was like the happy pain of love. [MASK] listened quietly. He turned to her and tried to look deep into her eyes.
<name>the host</name>	the host	Philip	He asked how long he could stay, and when [MASK] told him he must leave on Tuesday morning, expressed a wish that the visit might have been longer. He told him minutely all his symptoms and repeated what the doctor had said of him.
<name>He</name>	He	Lawson	she asked. "Not yet, I'm not a bit sleepy. [MASK] was in great form. He talked sixteen to the dozen from the moment I got there till the moment I left." "What did you talk about?" "Heaven knows!
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Philip	Ah, if you saw the chimney-pieces and the ceilings!" There was a cupboard in the wainscoting and from this he took a family tree. He showed it to [MASK] with child-like satisfaction. It was indeed imposing.
<name>Basil</name>	Basil	Philip	Choose your own evening." [MASK] was touched with the painter's kindness. All sorts of people were strangely kind to him, he thought. "It's awfully good of you, old man, but I'd rather not." He held out his hand.
<name>Straker</name>	Straker	Griffiths	They had lived in the same house for over a year, but had never done more than nod to one another in the passage. "I say, I hear you're seedy," said [MASK]. "I thought I'd come in and see what was the matter with you."
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Philip	[MASK] found himself with eighteen shillings left out of his month's pay. It was the first money he had ever earned in his life. It gave him none of the pride which might have been expected, but merely a feeling of dismay.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Philip	[MASK]'s head began to ache frightfully. He stood there motionless. He knew he would be in the way if he went back. They were enjoying themselves without him, and he was suffering, suffering. Time passed, and now he had an extraordinary shyness about rejoining them.
<name>Mr. Birkinshaw</name>	Mr. Birkinshaw	Macalister	"I was only having a joke with you. I opened it." He tore it out of her hands. [MASK] had bought him two hundred and fifty shares and sold them at the half-crown profit he had suggested. The commission note was to follow next day.
<name>Mr. De Winter</name>	Mr. De Winter	Mildred	"Vulgar? Modest, I call it. I've never said anything, but d'you think I like having to look at those naked people all day long." "Have you no sense of humour at all, [MASK]?" he asked frigidly.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Philip	Twenty-five? And he does nothing but stay in pensions and write poetry." "You don't know him," said [MASK] hotly. "Oh yes, I do: I've met a hundred and forty-seven of him."
<name>Uncle George</name>	Uncle George	Griffiths	[MASK] congratulated him because he had got out of his difficulties so easily. "It's the simplest thing in the world to have an affair with a woman," he remarked sententiously, "but it's a devil of a nuisance to get out of it."
<name>Mrs. Hudson</name>	Mrs. Hudson	Philip	In the cab he asked him one or two questions. "He seemed no worse than usual when I left this morning," said [MASK]. "It gave me an awful shock when I went in just now. And the thought of his dying all alone....
<name>He</name>	He	Lawson	He could hardly believe his ears. "How?" he asked. "Oh, enteric. Hard luck, wasn't it? I thought you mightn't know. Gave me a bit of a turn when I heard it." [MASK] nodded quickly and walked away.
<name>Herr</name>	Herr	Philip	When they sat down to dinner in a long dark apartment that led out of the drawing-room, [MASK], feeling very shy, saw that there were sixteen people. The Frau Professor sat at one end and carved.
<name>The narrator</name>	The narrator	Philip	he asked. "No, sir. He went away this morning, soon after you went out." "Isn't he coming back?" "I don't think so, sir. He's taken his luggage." [MASK] wondered what this could mean.
<name>any proper name</name> (There is no specific name given in the passage)	any proper name (There is no specific name given in the passage)	Hayward	She had the most adorable little nose and large brown eyes--he would describe her to [MASK]--and masses of soft brown hair, the sort of hair it was delicious to bury your face in, and a skin which was like ivory and sunshine, and her cheek was like a red, red rose.
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Philip	Most of them had 'fellers,' and those who hadn't said they had rather than have it supposed that no one had an inclination for them. One or two showed signs of being willing to start a flirtation with [MASK], and he watched their manoeuvres with grave amusement.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Phil	"Oh, I'm all right as I am." Then putting her arms round his neck, she placed her face against his and said: "Why are you so horrid to me, [MASK]?" He tried to get up, but she would not let him.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Philip	Because he could put down three hundred guineas and keep himself for five years [MASK] had the chance of a career; while he, with his experience and ability, had no possibility of ever being more than a clerk at thirty-five shillings a week.
<name>them</name>	them	Philip	He was interested in the life of students and constantly put [MASK] questions about it. He was in fact a little proud of him because he was a painter, and when people were present made attempts to draw him out.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Philip	"Oh, well, I can't expect to do that, but if I take care of myself I don't see why I shouldn't last another three or four." He was silent for a while, and [MASK] found nothing to say.
<name>Darcy</name>	Darcy	Philip	"That is the end of the story," she replied, with a ripple of laughter. [MASK] was silent for a moment. His heart beat quickly, and strange emotions seemed to be hustling one another in his heart.
<name>Edgar</name>	Edgar	Helen	He glanced at the address and at the signature, then tore the letter in two and threw it into the washing-basket by his side. Suddenly he came upon one signed [MASK]. He did not know the writing. It was thin, angular, and old-fashioned.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Mildred	Yours truly, [MASK]. He tore the letter into little bits and going out into the street scattered them in the darkness. "I'll see her damned," he muttered. A feeling of disgust surged up in him at the thought of seeing her again.
<name>he</name>	he	Philip	He did not believe that. She must remember quite well that he never took sugar in his tea. He accepted the incident as a sign that her nonchalance was affected. The conversation which [MASK] had interrupted went on, and presently he began to feel a little in the way.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Mildred	[MASK]'s come back." The colour came to her face. "Why didn't you tell me at once? I deserved that surely." "I was afraid to." She looked at herself in the glass and set her hat straight. "
<name>Mrs. Harling</name>	Mrs. Harling	Philip	She had made up her mind that it was no use trying to get work that summer, and with [MASK]'s approval determined to stay where she was till the autumn. She thought it would be easy to get something to do then.
<name>Ernest</name>	Ernest	Philip	It represented a thin young curate, with long hair that fell over his head in natural curls, with dark eyes, large and dreamy, and a pale ascetic face. [MASK] remembered the chuckle with which his uncle used to tell of the dozens of slippers which were worked for him by adoring ladies.
<name>the stranger</name>	the stranger	Philip	When he was told that a local magnate had said no one would take him for a City man, he felt that he had not lived in vain. He talked to [MASK] in a pleasant, off-hand fashion.
<name>the young boy</name>	the young boy	Philip	"He'll be safe with me. He'll get on like a house on fire. Won't you, young fellow?" Without waiting for an answer from [MASK] the big man burst into a great bellow of laughter.
<name>Oscar</name>	Oscar	Cronshaw	He did not realise that little that [MASK] said was new. His personality in conversation had a curious power. He had a beautiful and a sonorous voice, and a manner of putting things which was irresistible to youth.
<name>Lulu</name>	Lulu	Philip	The German suddenly disappeared, but [MASK] still sat at other tables. She paid no attention to him. Suddenly he realised that what he did was a matter of complete indifference to her; he could go on in that way till doomsday, and it would have no effect.
<name>The narrator</name>	The narrator	Philip	There was a certain amount of conversation over the dissecting-table, partly about the work, partly about the prospects of the football season, the demonstrators, and the lectures. [MASK] felt himself a great deal older than the others. They were raw schoolboys.
<name>The Vicar</name>	The Vicar	Philip	[MASK] would have liked an egg to himself, but he was not offered one, so took what he could. "How have the chickens been laying since I went away?" asked the Vicar. "Oh, they've been dreadful, only one or two a day."
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Philip	He adopted an appropriate manner. "I'm afraid it is the end this time, [MASK]," he said. "It'll be a great loss to all of us. I've known him for five-and-thirty years." "
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Philip	"I'm not going to sit still while you say impertinent things to me," he said with dignity. He got up and walked quickly out of the room into his study. [MASK] heard him shut the door and lock it.
<name>the listener</name>	the listener	Philip	She had forgotten to shut the door when she came in. "C'etait une fatalite." "And what happened then?" asked [MASK]. "That is the end of the story," she replied, with a ripple of laughter.
<name>Mr. Bingley</name>	Mr. Bingley	Philip	"Because, if there isn't, I think I'll go to church. I don't often have the chance of going in the evening." "Oh yes, do go." "I shall be in," said [MASK].
<name>Mr. Leonard</name>	Mr. Leonard	Philip	"Perhaps you wouldn't mind giving me the address." The house the stout woman suggested was in the next street, and they walked towards it. [MASK] could walk quite well, though he had to lean on a stick, and he was rather weak.
<name>she</name>	she	Philip	She called him every foul name she could think of. She used language so obscene that [MASK] was astounded; she was always so anxious to be refined, so shocked by coarseness, that it had never occurred to him that she knew the words she used now.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Philip	They all talked of his constitution, but they none of them knew how strong it was. "Are you going to stay a day or two?" He asked [MASK], pretending to believe he had come down for a holiday.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Philip	Conversation languished. It seemed to [MASK] that there was something dreadful in that gathering which he had sat with so often; they looked different under the light of the two hanging lamps from what they had ever looked before; he was vaguely uneasy.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Lawson	He did not want anyone to reproach him: he clenched his teeth and repeated that what had happened was inevitable just because it had happened. Regret was absurd. The days were unending, and the five shillings [MASK] had lent him would not last much longer.
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Mildred	[MASK] had left no letter, nothing but this ruin to mark her anger, and he could imagine the set face with which she had gone about her work. He went back into the sitting-room and looked about him. He was so astonished that he no longer felt angry.
<name>Keats</name>	Keats	Cronshaw	It was a miracle of charm, grace, and pity. He printed all [MASK]'s best poems in the course of the article, so that when the volume appeared much of its point was gone; but he advanced his own position a good deal.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Philip	[MASK] knew by heart the list of places at which they touched; and each one called up in him visions of tropical sunshine, and magic colour, and of a teeming, mysterious, intense life. Life! That was what he wanted.
<name>Mrs. Costello</name>	Mrs. Costello	Mildred	[MASK] was not unkind to her baby; she did all that was necessary; it amused her sometimes, and she talked about it a good deal; but at heart she was indifferent to it. She could not look upon it as part of herself.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Philip	I told 'em not to do it again. Too damned gentlemanly for me." There was another pause. The dinner was very simple and very good. [MASK] preserved a sedate exterior, but in his heart he was bubbling over with excitement.
<name>he</name>	he	Philip	He had chronic bronchitis, but many old men had that and lived on indefinitely. Meanwhile something must turn up; [MASK] could not get away from the feeling that his position was altogether abnormal; people in his particular station did not starve.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Philip	He saw that the boy hated to discuss the matter and he let him go. But [MASK] thought over all that the headmaster had said, and presently, his mind taken up entirely with the ceremony that was before him, a mystical rapture seized him.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Philip	On Wednesday morning he was ashamed to ask at the house and sent a messenger-boy with a letter and instructions to bring back a reply; but in an hour the boy came back with [MASK]'s letter unopened and the answer that the lady had not returned from the country.
<name>Simon</name>	Simon	Philip	[MASK] remembered how he had prayed to a God who was able to remove mountains for him who had faith, and he smiled bitterly. "I don't expect a miracle," he answered. "I think you're wise to let me try what I can do.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Philip	he said. "If you want to." "That doesn't sound very cordial," he laughed. "I'm not much of a one for saying pretty things." [MASK], a little disconcerted, was silent as he lit a cigarette.
<name>Louise</name>	Louise	Philip	He hesitated a moment. "I want you to remember that if you change your mind my offer still stands." "That's awfully kind of you." [MASK] shook hands with him out of the carriage window, and the train steamed out of the station.
