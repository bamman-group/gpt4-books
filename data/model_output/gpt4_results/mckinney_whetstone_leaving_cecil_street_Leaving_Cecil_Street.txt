<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Brownie	He wanted to say he was trying to understand it too. That he’d felt as if he’d been assaulted when he’d left there. “I was pissed because I didn’t know that [MASK] was dead,” he said, trying to put some finality to his tone.
<name>He</name>	He	Acknowledged	His mouth was bleeding now but he didn’t stop. Didn’t acknowledge the feel of metal against his raw, open skin. [MASK] only the feeling in his chest, felt like he was flying, he felt so free.
<name>Sugar</name>	Sugar	Louise	“That’s no money grin, that’s a man grin, a my-man-was-good-to-me-last-night grin.” “Y’all need to hush,” [MASK] said, laughing as she stuck her head around the curtain where the washbowls were.
<name>John</name>	John	Clara	and they never saw her leave the block by either end.” “Well, whose house was she looking for?” [MASK] asked. “Don’t know, don’t know. Just know what I think.” “And that would be?”
<name>Chantelle</name>	Chantelle	Alberta	Let ’em walk out with their dignity. All you got to really worry about is not getting caught and I can give you stuff to prevent a pregnancy. Easy money, [MASK], trust me.” “What if I don’t want to?”
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Alberta	Please, [MASK], let me.” He had all of her in the circle of his arms. She was a small woman, slight shoulders, thin arms, her arms hung loosely at her sides. He wanted her to lift her arms, to hold him.
<name>Rosie</name>	Rosie	Sondra	“Come on in, hurry up, we’ll talk inside,” [MASK] said as she pointed out a soda crate sitting on top of a ten-gallon lidded garbage can and told them to prop the soda crate under the window and use it as a step.
<name>Roscoe</name>	Roscoe	Clara	“You know [MASK] opens the shop at seven for me every other Saturday,” she said, at the chair .now where she’d laid out her clothes for today. “Like I said earlier, you bring your fine self straight home tonight, we can take our time tonight.”
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Shay	He insisted to [MASK] that he himself hadn’t been able to even begin to move on and really get plain with what had happened to his friend until he’d stood over his buddy’s hospital bed and watched the blankness in his eyes.
<name>Yvette</name>	Yvette	Valadean	He smiled all over himself. He’d told himself that the prudent thing to do was to be cool, not make any more moves in [MASK]’s direction since she was living right across the street. Too close.
<name>Starr</name>	Starr	Neet	“Forget everything I said up to now. You got to be absolutely sure because right now it’s about you opening your legs up for a medical procedure to someone our age. Think about that, [MASK].”
<name>Yankee</name>	Yankee	Alberta	She would have cried right now over that gesture but she seemed to be dripping blood from every place these days, her nose, her mouth. So she didn’t want to cry and see blood in her tears. Except that this sensation of [MASK] being right next door was such a big feeling.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Neet	She could no longer keep her excitement coiled in her muscles and now she was like a Slinky toy just loose and all over the place. Now she was at the front door and now she had the door open and now she was calling out to [MASK].
<name>Louise</name>	Louise	Neet	She didn’t have an appetite right now. Took that as a good sign as she thought about the feel of her daughter’s mark. It was deeper than she’d expected it would be. And softer too. Chapter 10 OUISE BAKED THE cake for [MASK]’s homecoming /|
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Shay	“Ham?” “Yeah, ham as in salty and making you hold fluid in your feet. Your feet do look swollen.” “Well, I been standing on them all day, how they supposed to look?” That had sounded reasonable to [MASK].
<name>Arnetta</name>	Arnetta	Neet	Because in some ways [MASK] was a fill-in for them and all that was unfixable about their own lives, their own feelings of having been abandoned by the likes of a Brownie, of having struggled against their personal tyrannies, their own dour-faced Alberta who tried so hard to keep them bound.
<name>Alphonse</name>	Alphonse	Tim	She didn’t totally believe him, but she believed him enough not to test his story. There were of course no rats, not the four-legged kind anyhow, because [MASK] used the apartment for the pleasure takings of his married customers.
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Neet	The three just stood there looking stunned. “I mean, my feelings won’t be hurt. I was only trying to help you, [MASK], anyhow, since I didn’t think you wanted your mom to know.”
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Louise	The tea seemed to be taking a long time this morning and she kept boiling more water to rush it. Then she went into her mother’s room, anxious to see her mother smile the way she always did when [MASK] brought her morning tea.
<name>She</name>	She	Cried	Sobbed at the irony, that her mother’s church had never been able to do that, convince her that she was good. [MASK] now wondering what about her mother’s life had been so damaged that she needed that church in the first place.
<name>Tamika</name>	Tamika	Louise	He’d shake his fist then and say he knew that’s how it went down. “Hell, yeah, they were able to save her life and her uterus.” [MASK] couldn’t entirely disagree, since she worked in a hospital and knew the discrepancy in the level of care.
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	C	He hadn’t expected such news. Had imagined himself walking into that third-floor bedroom just like always, his heaviness lifting at the sight of the curves of [MASK]’s back under that green silky robe, then the thrill of her in the dark.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Alberta	He felt her presence at first until the night pulled back to reveal the outline of her face. “[MASK],” he said as she walked up the steps on her side of the thin railing that separated the houses.
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Deucie	“Don’t be afraid,” [MASK] said, reacting to the look of confused terror that came up on her daughter’s face. “I wouldn’t hurt you. You mine. I marked you so I’d know you. You mine.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Louise	[MASK] didn’t know what to do when she saw her mother flailing about like that. She ran back into her own room and threw herself on the bed and covered her head with the pillow. She stayed like that with the pillow shielding her from those awful gasping sounds for almost an hour.
<name>She</name>	She	Joe	Had folded the clothes that [MASK] had left all over the place neatly back into the chifforobe. Found a cracked vase in one of the crates that she was able to use to rinse her leavings down the drain in the cellar floor, leavings nice and soft from the cat food.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Pat	She went back downtown to the house where she was raised, [MASK]’s Place. She sat on the front steps and took in the scent of the hydrangeas blooming in the garden. She thought about what she would do now without the dictates of her church directing her path.
<name>Janice</name>	Janice	Alberta	He focused his ear toward the living-room wall, then slapped his leg excitedly. “ ‘ ’Round Midnight.’ That’s a classic.” “I know what it is,” [MASK] said as if she’d just been insulted.
<name>Emmett</name>	Emmett	Shay	But for as long as [MASK] had memory, one or the other of them would come outside to the banister and sit, and the other would just know, as if the one’s presence on the banister gave off a beep that only the other could hear even deep inside the house.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Neet	But it don’t have to be done today.” “It does. It does. Today. I’m ready now, and I might not be ready tomorrow this time.” [MASK] rubbed her stomach gently, a contrast to the way she blasted her words through the living room.
<name>Sula</name>	Sula	Shay	The dinner smells that usually met [MASK] when she turned onto the block this time of day were absent now. No aromas from stewed tomatoes, or sauteed pepper steak, or apples boiling for homemade applesauce to accompany the baked pork chops.
<name>Delilah</name>	Delilah	Deucie	[MASK] didn’t want the husband, told him so every Friday night when he’d get drunk from moonshine and proposition her. She slept with a switchblade under her pillow should he try to creep in her room at night.
<name>Delilah</name>	Delilah	Louise	Wondered if [MASK] had worked a spell on him years ago to make him put his horn down and quit his life on the road. Now his mind was sliding back there again and he was suddenly picturing some of the women he’d been with in that other life.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Neet	She swung her legs over the side of the bed and listened for her mother. Her radiator hissed and she remembered her mother telling her that she was going to start up the heater so that [MASK] wouldn’t have a recurrence of those god-awful chills.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	C	He told himself he should be happy for [MASK] that she’d escaped that life, been rescued from that life and made respectable by a husband. But he didn’t feel happy. Felt a rock turning over in his stomach that he recognized as molten, craggy regret.
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Deucie	I’ma help you though. You don’t mind, do you? If I stay right here and help you, maybe soften it for you some? ” [MASK] shrugged her shoulders. “You done enough,” she said. “Feeding me.”
<name>Amara</name>	Amara	Neet	The sound of her name oozing through her mother’s lips was like a balm to [MASK], smoothing over the places where she’d been damaged, stripped raw, softening the roughness, erasing the pain, healing; healing all the way from deep inside back to the surface of her skin.
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	Neet	Hoped that [MASK] was up there in her own room while she did this, hoped the furniture bumping against the wall like that was irritating the shit out of her and keeping her from praying or sleeping or whatever she did up there all day.
<name>Leo</name>	Leo	Joe	[MASK] got filled up inside listening to her laugh. “Or should I just raise my fist and shout, ‘Power to the people’?” he said. Or ‘Sock it to me,’ or ‘Here come the judge.’”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Neet	She watched [MASK]’s legs swinging back and forth as she sat straddling the banister. She was trying to focus on her feet. Trying to see if her feet looked swollen pushed into the flip-flops she wore the way they’d been swollen a couple of days ago.
<name>McCarthy</name>	McCarthy	Pat	Though she had studied the look of him too, peeped at him when he played cards at [MASK]’s, watched him from her window when he left and the sight of him was caught in the headlights of a passing car.
<name>him</name>	him	Joe	That’s when she saw the dark-haired woman with the witch’s eyes walk toward [MASK] as he sipped a drink at the bar. He was surrounded by three or four admirers, but he excused himself to open a path for her as she walked toward him.
<name>Janet</name>	Janet	Neet	She said if she didn’t hear it from your mother, [MASK], as far as she was concerned she didn’t hear it. So she wouldn’t do it. So like I said, I’m the one today. I’m totally capable too.”
<name>Uncle Vernon</name>	Uncle Vernon	Joe	“Your mother decided to slice up a ham to put on the table to add to everything else she’s in there cooking up,” [MASK] said, his hand cupped over his mouth. “So now she needs a can of pineapple for garnish.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Cheeks	He meant no disrespect, he was saying right now, when he hadn’t come back like he’d promised the night that [MASK] was stabbed. She was thinking, as he talked, that nor did she mean him any.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Joe	They were sitting so close that he could smell the Bordeaux as she brought her glass down, a perfect lip print on its rim. The tenor sax was soloing now, the notes he blew out swirled around [MASK], turning the texture of the melting air in here to cream.
<name>Janet</name>	Janet	Shay	She shook almost convulsively going into the office, she was so nervous, but determined to go through with it anyhow. [MASK] had been right the other night when she’d yelled at her to get her teeth fixed. Denying herself denied everyone who loved her, she’d realized then.
<name>Sissy</name>	Sissy	Johnetta	Though there was talk of the puffy-haired wild woman who’d challenged the Corner Boys. The story had grown so from when [MASK] had first fanned it until now. Now the story was that she’d appeared butt naked on the corner and asked the Corner Boys which one was gonna have her first.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Alberta	“[MASK],” he whispered when her face appeared from behind the door, and she stared up at him with those eyes. And he could see now that they were remarkable eyes, soft brown with a shyness about them.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Neet	Now she jumped at the sound of the doorbell. She knew who it was. Who else would lay on the doorbell at nine o’clock at night knowing that [MASK] had just been discharged from the hospital and was probably asleep. Such insensitivity they had.
<name>Rosie</name>	Rosie	Joe	And though [MASK] complains about her, even though I’ll admit too the woman is a bit of a loudmouth, curses, you know, loves her Four Roses whiskey, she still did all right by me, really. She gave me a good life.”
<name>Clarice</name>	Clarice	Louise	[MASK] followed this stench now to the back of the cellar, this stench a mixture of urine and bile, dried blood, sour skin. She was at the window now, the wooden pony under the wide-open window.
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Valadean	Rather than sitting in the brocaded armchair that sagged in the center, he stood, leaned slightly against the chest of drawers. [MASK] was perched on the edge of the bed. Such a contrast to this room, she was dressed in white from head to toe.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Alberta	He swallowed his breath as a half-drunk couple laughed themselves silly as they passed on the street below. They never even looked up in his direction and he focused himself again at [MASK]’s door and watched it now as it seemed to inch open in slow motion.
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Neet	Afraid that something might go wrong; afraid about the after-math, how [MASK] would be emotionally if she really, really wanted a baby now, the emptiness she’d most likely feel. Just plain afraid right now, so the song that was too old for her calmed her down.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Joe	[MASK] followed her into the kitchen and when she grabbed the plate from the old-style chrome-rimmed Formica table and turned and saw him standing there as if he was ready to hug her or otherwise lapse into some showy expression of condolence, she was outraged.
<name>Nettie</name>	Nettie	Alberta	The largeness of the feeling wouldn’t allow her to lie here and die knowing that [MASK] was right next door. Knowing that only a cellar window and a modest-size backyard separated her from getting one last peep at her daughter’s face.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Alberta	His voice filled the room and [MASK] cuddled up to the sound of it as he’d tell her about the clubs he’d played, who he’d played with, what songs, what the people in the audience had shouted.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Alberta	Felt her chest open up. “Now you ought to know better than that, you know I don’t listen to that devil music,” [MASK] said, “unless you count the past sixteen or so years where I’ve had to listen to yours by default.”
<name>Queenie</name>	Queenie	Neet	[MASK] cried harder because she wasn’t sure if she even wanted to go the Miss BB route. What if she wanted to have it? A baby. The thought would nestle against her lately as she floated off to sleep on her mother’s bed where she’d take her afternoon nap.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Louise	He went up to the apartment and iced his lips and thought about how he’d explain the swollen mouth to [MASK]. Got into a tussle with some young boy, he’d say. It had gotten out of hand, and before he knew it, they were duking it out.
<name>Rico</name>	Rico	Joe	An ass-on-the-bed bitch was all she’d been to [MASK]. Better that he hadn’t recognized her so she didn’t have to be reminded of what she truly was. She’d stumbled out of the club.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Joe	“I’m looking for C. She still around?” Silence then. “Hello,” [MASK] called again. “Please just tell me whether or not she’s still around.” “Long gone—” “You know where, I mean, she working still?”
<name>Jerome</name>	Jerome	Joe	“Well, I guess it was memorable, then,” she said. “ ’Cause it was sure nuff loud.” [MASK] smiled, let his smile take its time forming. “Talk about giving a brother a compliment and then snatching it right back,” he said.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Joe	Missed it so much that he put awnings out front to try and duplicate its shade. Generally upbeat, [MASK] felt sad about the tree right now as he stood on his porch at two in the morning, shocked again by the sight of the stump where the tree should be.
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	Alberta	He situated himself inside the darkness of [MASK]’s porch. Despite the glitter and the blasts of light from the street below, the space of her porch that would have been illuminated if she’d been a cooperative neighbor and turned on the outside light was instead a welcome patch of blackness.
<name>Yolanda</name>	Yolanda	Shay	Her hair fell around her face and neck in wispy tousles. [MASK] was going to wash it later and saturate it with Dippity-Do to thicken it up so that she could then pick it out into a ’fro.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Louise	“This side looks pretty,” he’d say, smoothing her hair, “but I guess she did the other side with her bad eye.” [MASK] felt a laugh coming on as she walked down the three short steps and into the shop.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Neet	“[MASK]? Is that you, sweetheart?” he said as he started walking toward the darkness. “How are you feeling, we would have come upstairs, your mother said you’re not supposed to be tackling the stairs.” “What more can happen to me?”
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Joe	She yielded to her always cold self and there was nothing she could do to stop the chills. She shook convulsively and then she cried too. She cried and shook and shook and cried and [MASK] held her so tightly as he tried to keep his own nature at bay, his heat.
<name>Delilah</name>	Delilah	Valadean	He put [MASK] in a cab after they left the Red Moon Hotel. He needed to walk off the effects of her, the essence of her womanhood that hung over him fat and heavy, like pea-soup fog.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Joe	An old cat was on vocals and his voice was so smooth that it melted the air in here. [MASK] was getting a fine buzz from the Bombay gin and tonic water and he was listening so intently as the old cat sang “Embrace Me.”
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Deucie	[MASK] understood that kind of denial because it was much easier to not act. Had her own denial working about who was living right next door. Whose high-yellow legs she’d see on those steps out back. Whose screams had gotten under her skin when the sirens were right outside.
<name>Keisha</name>	Keisha	Louise	Told her she better take her fine ass in there and dance with her husband before one of those other bitches in there did. “Go,” she said as she pushed [MASK] out of the kitchen. “And shake your hips when you walk through.”
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Maggie	“ ’Cause I got our little nightcap in the bottom of my bag,” [MASK] said, not missing a beat. “I bought us our Manischewitz Concord grape, and I got a shot glass with your name on it.”
<name>Rosa</name>	Rosa	Shay	[MASK] had always taken comfort in the smells; no matter what, when she turned onto the block this time of day she got confirmation that life did have a predictable normalcy, a beautiful simplicity, like dinnertime smells mixing in the air above her head.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Clara	“Now you wanna hear what somebody knows, I can tell you what I know, who I saw trying to make a play for my husband.” [MASK] tapped the straightening comb against the barrel-shaped countertop stove.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Joe	“Don’t leave me, please.” [MASK] said that he would be back. Had he never not been back? he asked. He kissed her then softly, as if she was his bride and he was on his way back to work after the honeymoon.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Joe	She couldn’t stand the thought of the death of them any more than she could picture [MASK] really dead, in a coffin. But she worked in a hospital, felt death hovering around all day long. As much as the hospital discriminated, death did not.
<name>Reuben</name>	Reuben	Luther	Didn’t understand the sudden revival in her appetite since she’d been in this cellar, hadn’t eaten this much in the entire month that she’d been with [MASK]. She took the hunger as a bad sign, hunger was the body trying to go on living.
<name>Kvothe</name>	Kvothe	Joe	[MASK] was seeing that first horn. Now he was back to thinking about the mass of feelings that had stormed up in his chest when he’d looked at his horn last night, feelings that he hadn’t begun to unwrap because of the knife edges they seemed to bear.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Louise	[MASK] had gone loose and open for him last night the way she hadn’t in weeks. He felt her hand on his stomach now, making soft circles as he tried to close his eyes on how the sleek metal of his saxophone had gleamed through the black cellar air last night.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Louise	[MASK] had let herself go in his arms. She’d tried to remain stiff and unwavering but his arms were so warm and strong and desperate that she relented and let herself go soft in his arms, let him hug her as she held on.
<name>Marvin</name>	Marvin	Joe	[MASK] got up to leave. Said he was taking his old ass home and their response was yeah, please take your old ass home. He was thinking as he walked out of how it had changed for him over time.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Valadean	Just being a good neighbor, he convinced himself as he showed [MASK] how to grab the poles so that she could make it to a seat without falling, unaccustomed as she was to the jerky motion as the train shook from side to side.
<name>Earl</name>	Earl	Brownie	she said. “Don’t worry ’bout [MASK]. He won’t be visiting you in that way anyhow. Can’t. Had it shot off years ago in a street fight that turned dirty. Why you think he only comes around on Sundays?
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Louise	Thought he could have fallen in love with her even though he was paying for her time. Some nights, the way she’d occupy his mind, he thought he had fallen for her. Even after he’d married [MASK], the' feel of her would drift into his consciousness from time to time.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Valadean	Said, “[MASK], consider yourself turned around no more. I’ll not only escort you to the el, I’ll make sure you ride for free this evening.” She was headed to get stockings for church tomorrow, she told him as they walked.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Joe	She was wrapped in a towel and the sunlight pushing through the window sheers made rainbows of the drops of water that slid down her arms and legs. The sight of her now mixing with the scent of the Camay soap rising off her skin had [MASK]’s manhood converging all over again.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Alberta	He erased time as he played, played through the years as he allowed himself to see [MASK] minus the hairnet or the holy cap, her hair out and loose; her pouty mouth covered in red lipstick; her holy dress exchanged for a green silky robe.
<name>Antonio</name>	Antonio	Joe	His hands were dark and strong and warm like [MASK]’s hands as he peeled her gloves and put her small hand to his lips and kissed her hand, then asked, “Can I stand a chance with you?”
<name>He</name>	He	SHAY	Was she light or brown? How could she not know the difference between them. He radioed his supervisor, said that he was putting things on automatic, they’d better get a replacement for him because he had a family emergency and he had to go. [MASK] RUSHED
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Joe	Thought she heard the floor sigh under her feet, as if something was moving around below her, under the house, in the cellar. She got a chill then, was about to yell up to [MASK] to remind him yet again about the light switch in the cellar.
<name>Sonny</name>	Sonny	Joe	[MASK] then pulled his horn from the back of the closet in the living room, where he’d slid it two weeks before. Spent this Saturday from the time he’d gotten off from work until now with his horn. He’d put it together and taken it apart;
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Valadean	He looked up and there was [MASK] standing there. He sat up with a jerk. He hadn’t seen her since their time together Saturday night, though he’d seen every inch of her when he allowed his mind to go back to the room at the Red Moon Hotel.
<name>Delilah</name>	Delilah	Brownie	“Awl, [MASK],” she said out loud as she watched a worm emerge through the holes in the dirt her toes were making. He’d been a prince the way he’d acquiesced to her every desire.
<name>Sharon</name>	Sharon	Shay	“I mean, I been back and forth with this, [MASK], you know that I have. I have to admit it. I was, like, you know, a baby’s not the worse thing that can happen to a person, okay,
<name>Tasha</name>	Tasha	Shay	“Wait a minute, what you mean you’re the one, where’s your mom?” [MASK] asked. “Okay, this is the situation, she’s not doing the procedure.” “Not doing it?” the three blurted out in a chorus.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Neet	I don’t know where she is, [MASK] either. Might have gone to church. I’ma help you though. You don’t mind, do you? If I stay right here and help you, maybe soften it for you some? ”
<name>Raymond</name>	Raymond	Joe	“How many total you got to lose?” [MASK] asked, thinking that he could already see her face starting to sag, especially the way she was standing in the light, the light magnified things so. “Well, he’s gonna pull a couple each time I go.
