<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Eric	My nose ran, and I sniffed and snorted, and I felt my chest heave and a muscle in my jaw tremored uncontrollably. I forgot all about [MASK], about my father, about everything except me, and my loss.
<name>Sean</name>	Sean	Jamie	[MASK]’s mother was still up and she made us some tea. She’s a big woman who’s always in a green housecoat when I see her in the evenings after the pub when, as often happens, her son and I end up at her house.
<name>her</name>	her	Eric	‘Well,’ I sighed, leaning against the wall with one hand and wondering what I could say. ‘That was . . . that was just a joke. Oh God, I don’t know.’ I frowned at the phone and waited for [MASK] to say something.
<name>Wormtail</name>	Wormtail	Paul	[MASK] wriggled, and the look on his face seemed to indicate that he wouldn’t actually mind wasting anything, just so long as he got to hit the bell with his plank of wood. ‘Aw-right,’ he said, and stopped struggling.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Eric	Or maybe [MASK] had arranged a rendezvous. No, that wasn’t likely; surely he would contact me first. I ran upstairs, went up into the close heat of the loft, opened the land-side skylight again and surveyed the approaches through the glasses.
<name>No</name>	No	Nup	You can bring me grapes sometime if you want.’ ‘OK. I’ll come round maybe tomorrow. I’ll give you a call first to let you know.’ ‘Great. Any more word from you-know-who?’ ‘[MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Eric	‘I don’t like leaving the island for that long, [MASK]. I’m sorry, but I get this horrible feeling in my stomach, as though there’s a great big knot in it. I just can’t go that far away, not overnight or ...
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Frang	I put the knife up to his eyes, watching them focus on it with drunken imprecision. The smell of drink off him was foul. ‘[MASK]?’ he said weakly. I jabbed the knife at him, just stopping short of the bridge of his nose.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Jamie	[MASK] must have taken a cigarette even though I knew he didn’t smoke, because I saw the lighter go up, igniting in front of my eyes in a shower of sparks like a fireworks display. I could almost feel my occipital lobe fusing.
<name>Galaxia</name>	Galaxia	Eric	At least, not through the direct application of any other power but imaginative intelligence, and that, ultimately, was the bedrock for everything else. If it could not meet the challenge that [MASK] represented, then I deserved to be destroyed.
<name>Crows</name>	Crows	Sheep	A few birds stirred themselves lethargically as I went past. Quite a few were perching on the wires of the telephone line snaking its way to the island on skinny poles. [MASK] made their ugly, broken noises, little lambs bleated back.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Eric	His eyes had grown dark-set and were underlined by bags, and his nose seemed to twitch a lot, too. Once he picked me up and gave me a kiss on the lips which really made me frightened. My father grew almost as uncommunicative as [MASK].
<name>Andy</name>	Andy	Diggs	If people don’t know, there’s no need to tell them. Yeah, he got out. He’s called the house a couple of times and he says he’s coming this way. [MASK] came and told us the day he broke out.’
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Eric	I was croaking by now, my mouth drying up. ‘What? What are you talking about?’ [MASK]’s voice said suddenly, close to the phone again. I swallowed, smiled once more at my father, whose eyes seemed to have narrowed slightly.
<name>Seamus</name>	Seamus	Willy	‘I was-ah - I was just thinking that we really must - must get [MASK] to give us another shot of his old car; you know, the Mini he bombs up and down the sands on sometimes? That was really good fun earlier on, wasn’t it?’
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jamie	I doubled up, retching and heaving, feeling my guts contract like a balling fist inside me; involuntary, alive, like a woman must feel with a kicking child. My throat was rasped with the force of the jet. [MASK] caught me as I almost fell over.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Jamie	My father ignored it, too, standing in the same position as before, head cocked. I licked my lips and said; ‘Well, [MASK]—’ ‘What? You see? You’ve forgotten my name again now. What’s the use?
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Eric	Every particle of [MASK]’s brain was concentrated on his mission of returning and setting fire, and no normal brain - not even mine, which was far from normal and more powerful than most - could match that marshalling of forces.
<name>McEwan</name>	McEwan	Eric	Once the business with [MASK] was over, I decided, I really must restart my campaign to persuade my father to get a VTR. It was too easy to miss good programmes on fine days. After our meal my father went into town.
<name>Alex</name>	Alex	Eric	It was to send [MASK] flying back and out to something else: an amalgam of both his earlier self (but satanically reversed) and a more worldy-wise man, an adult damaged and dangerous, confused and pathetic and manic all at once.
<name>Jeremy</name>	Jeremy	Jamie	I used to think that I was weird because I found that the morning after I had eaten a curry my armpits smelled of the stuff, but I have since found that [MASK] has experienced the same effect, so I don’t feel so bad.
<name>John</name>	John	Porteneil	e hit and fatally injured my lose muttered last words in f j11 stop, were: ‘My God, the ahead of me from the town oday, but I could hear the spread the garbage around \yhile, and it was about time [MASK] had thrown out.
<name>Tim</name>	Tim	Eric	Anyway, with [MASK] on his way, I didn’t think it would be a good idea to start another War only to have to abandon it in the middle of things and start dealing with the real world. I decided I would postpone hostilities for a while.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Paul	I smiled, called him over. ‘See this?’ I said. It was a rhetorical question. [MASK] nodded, big eyes staring. ‘This’, I told him, ‘is a bell. Like the ones in the church in the town.
<name>Vito</name>	Vito	Eric	My father went back to stirring the soup, which I could smell now above the cigar smoke. I could feel excitement in my stomach - a rising, tingling rush. So [MASK] was coming back home again; that was good-bad. I knew he’d make it.
<name>Julian</name>	Julian	Frang	He tried to roll away from me, across the bed under the open window, but I pulled him back from the hot, still night. ‘No, [MASK], no,’ he said, shaking his head and trying to push my hands away.
<name>Cat</name>	Cat	Cat	Eh? What the hell do you think I’m doing all this for? These are dogs, you brainless little shitbag! Haven’t you any brains left? What’s happened to all your brains, Frankie boy? [MASK] got your tongue?
<name>Humbert</name>	Humbert	BrrapV	‘[MASK] said my anus loudly, surprising me as well as my father. He put the magazine down and stared into space over my head, smiling wisely as I cleared my throat and flapped the hem of my dressing-gown as unobtrusively as I could.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Eric	‘Well,’ [MASK] said in measured tones, and slowly, ‘Funny you should say that. . . .’ ‘Yes? Yes?’ I said excitedly, pressing the receiver so close to my mouth that my teeth clattered off the mouthpiece.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Eric	‘Hello, [MASK]. Where are you?' ‘Here! Where are you?’ ‘Here.’ ‘If we’re both here, why are we bothering with the phone?’ ‘Tell me where you are before your money runs out.’
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Eric	I froze, then gulped, said: ‘Er—’ ‘Why are you accusing me of forgetting things? What are you accusing me of forgetting? What? I haven’t forgotten anything!’ [MASK] gasped and spluttered.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Frank	Fancy cornin’ along?’ ‘No, thanks. I’m pretty tired. I was up early this morning. I might see you tomorrow.’ ‘Great. Well, take care an’ that. See you, [MASK].’
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Eric	Yes?’ I said excitedly, pressing the receiver so close to my mouth that my teeth clattered off the mouthpiece. ‘Not a damn thing. This morning was one of the few I can honestly say I experienced not a thing,’ [MASK] informed me urbanely.
<name>Keegan</name>	Keegan	Eric	My father still hadn’t shown. [MASK] glanced back at me again then smashed the axe into the door. A sheep cried out behind us as I fumbled for a steelie. I could hear the crackling of fires on all sides and smell roasted meat.
<name>Tim</name>	Tim	Jamie	‘Well, there you go, [MASK],’ I said pathetically, drying up metaphorically as well as literally. ‘Don’t spend too long on that phone,’ my father said as he passed me, and continued up the stairs.
<name>David</name>	David	Eric	A few people knew something had happened, and they saw that [MASK] was quieter, but that was all. My father and I didn’t know anything except that he’d been off from his classes for a short while because of a migraine.
<name>Spud</name>	Spud	Frank	Ah thought maybe ye went tae ra bog like rat.’ ‘Oh, aye; we go into a cubicle and [MASK] goes in the bowl while I do it into the cistern.’ ‘Yur kiddin’!’
<name>John</name>	John	Porteneil	I checked my watch and saw that it was Thursday. It was very unusual for him to go anywhere on a Thursday, whether [MASK] or any further afield. I wasn’t going to ask him where he was going because he’d only lie.
<name>Christopher</name>	Christopher	Paul	Bells make that noise. They’re great big hollow bits of metal filled up with noises and they let the noises out on Sunday mornings after breakfast. That’s what this is.’ ‘A brekast?’ [MASK] looked up at me with mightily furrowed little brows.
<name>Humbert</name>	Humbert	Eric	I smiled at my father and nodded and put one hand urder the other armpit, trying to look as relaxed as possible. ‘You love me, don t you, my sweet? As though your little heart was on fire for me . . .,’ [MASK] mumbled far away.
<name>John</name>	John	Eric	In fact, [MASK] appeared to recover from what happened. He was sedated, he spent a couple of nights in the hospital as a patient, then a few days resting in his room in the residence. He went back to his studies within the week, and attended classes as normal.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Jamie	‘And he’s mad at them,’ [MASK] grinned, drinking his pint as I annihilated various dodging, multi-coloured spacecraft on the screen. I laughed. ‘Yeah, if you like. Oh, I don’t know. Maybe he really is crazy.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Eric	Stars going OK for you, are they? What sign are you, anyway? I forget.’ ‘Canis.’ ‘Woof! Really?’ ‘Yeah. What sign are you?’ I asked, dutifully following one of [MASK]’s old routines.
<name>Armitage</name>	Armitage	Paul	I scrambled to the top and looked out over the sand and rocks to where [MASK] stood, a tiny figure against the reflected brightness of the pools and wet sands, overshadowed by the tilted cone of metal beside him.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Eric	I couldn’t blame him, even then, when I felt it hardest. He was [MASK], he was my brother, he was doing what he had to do, just like the brave soldier who died for the cause, or for me.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Eric	I think he knew, just as I did, that [MASK] would get back, and he was worried about what would happen. I didn’t blame him, and I didn’t doubt that he was also worried about me.
<name>Adrian</name>	Adrian	Jamie	I was aware I was staggering slightly, lurching sporadically into [MASK] or the girl, but there wasn’t a great deal I could do about it ; I felt rather like one of those ancient dinosaurs so huge that they had a virtually separate brain to control their back legs.
<name>Cheradenine</name>	Cheradenine	Jamie	I shrugged, concentrated on the space battle again. ‘But it doesn’t bother me. There are a lot madder people about the place.’ [MASK] sat in silence for a while as I went from screenful to screenful of wheeling, whining craft.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Eric	‘Hello, [MASK],’ I said, smiling. I decided that, whatever else happened, tonight I would not make him angry. I’d put the phone down rather han say the wrong thing and have my brother wreck yet another piece of Post Office property.
<name>Scar</name>	Scar	Eric	I rolled, saw [MASK] haring away over the garden, heading south down the island. I dropped the catapult, ran down the steps and picked the torch up. It was a metre into the cellar, nowhere near the bales.
<name>Griffith</name>	Griffith	Esmerelda	I staggered back, partly to make it look good on the offchance there was somebody watching and partly because letting go of the winch had put me off balance. I fell to the ground as [MASK] left it forever.
<name>he</name>	he	Angus	What sort of twisted thoughts went through my father’s brain at the time to make him choose such a name for the child I cannot start to imagine, but that was the name [MASK] chose for his new son.
<name>No</name>	No	Pomiss	‘You won’t hit the bell until I wave, will you?’ He shook his head. ‘[MASK].’ ‘Good. Won’t be long.’ I turned and started to head for the dunes at a slow run. My back felt funny.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Eric	There wouldn’t be much point to me getting married perhaps - I’ll admit that - but the principle is there. Besides, I’m not [MASK]; I’m me and I’m here and that’s all there is to it.
<name>Trurl</name>	Trurl	Eric	I was still thinking about that, wondering what it really meant. The obvious interpretation was that [MASK] was going to set fire to some dogs, but I was too wise in the ways of the Factory to treat that as definite; I suspected there was more to it.
<name>He</name>	He	Esmerelda	Actually, I might just have had a it occurred less than a year after child, [MASK]. Unknown to for that matter - she was one of He inserted it through the he was still alive though in spital, where he later died.
<name>John</name>	John	Eric	I shivered. My head shook as though I’d just knocked back some hundred-proof whisky. Pant pant whine whine went the noise. [MASK] said something soothing and quiet in the backgrou nd. Oh my God, he had a dog in there with him.
<name>David</name>	David	Eric	Perhaps he was going to give himself up, or turn tail! All because I had rejected him, his own brother! I shook my head angrily and stood up. None of this was getting me anywhere. I had to assume that [MASK] was going to get in touch.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Frank	‘You just said you were called [MASK].’ ‘Well,’ I sighed, leaning against the wall with one hand and wondering what I could say. ‘That was . . . that was just a joke. Oh God, I don’t know.’
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Eric	[MASK] checked the sheet of paper by the chair to see if the child had been given any extra medication, but everything appeared normal. He edged closer, crooning, waving the spoon, fighting the waves of pain inside his skull.
<name>Steve</name>	Steve	Jamie	I felt a mixture of relief and disappointment. I sighed. ‘Ah, [MASK]. OK. How are you?’ ‘Off work. Dropped a plank on my foot this morning and it’s all swollen.’ ‘Nothing too serious, though?’
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Eric	His dark eyes flickered at me like a long sooty flame, then he looked down again. I drank some of the beer I had opened. The new batch of home-brew tasted better than the last lot, and stronger. ‘[MASK]?’
<name>seemed</name>	seemed	Droper	I on the tighter corners; the , so it wasn’t as risky as it [MASK] and charged up over to where the service pipe the house appears out of jbmped the iron spikes and ncrete, then ran over the down on to the island.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Eric	My God, what was he doing to the animal? Then the receiver clunked, I heard a shout like a curse, and the phone rattled and crashed again. ‘You little bastard— Aargh! Fuck! Shit. Come back, you little—’ ‘Hello! [MASK]!
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Paul	I always got on well with [MASK]. Perhaps because I knew from an early age that he was not long for this world, I tried to make his time in it as pleasant as possible, and thus ended up treating him far better than most young boys treat their younger brothers.
<name>Chappie</name>	Chappie	Jamie	I looked sort of up and to the side again, as though at him, then nodded. I let my back slide down the pillar until I was virtually squatting on the floor. The girl helped [MASK] jump down.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Eric	They’ve caught [MASK]. I heard. I’ll be right in. Where’ll I meet you, at the police station?’ ‘Naw, naw, son. Naw, mee’ me ou’side the . . . ou’side the . . . lib’ary.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Eric	9: What Happened to [MASK] I slept fairly late, for me. My father had arrived back at the house just as I returned from the beach, and I had gone to bed at once, so 1 had a good long sleep.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Paul	[MASK] was singing to himself and asking questions of the type children tend to, such as why weren’t the birds all blown away during the storm, and why didn’t the sea fill up with water with the stream going so hard?
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Eric	Want you to come here, son, want you to come . . . come here. They’ve caught [MASK], son.’ I froze. I stared at the wallpaper above the little table in the corner of the turn of the stairs where the phone sat.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Jamie	I bade [MASK] and his mother goodnight and walked on through the outskirts of town to the track heading for the island, then down the track in blackness, sometimes using my small torch, towards the bridge and the house.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Eric	There just aren’t enough natural deaths. You can’t explain that sort of thing to people, though. ‘Sometimes I think you’re the one who should be in hospital, not [MASK].’ He was looking at me from under his dark brows, his voice low.
<name>Prentice</name>	Prentice	Jamie	I admit I have watched [MASK] doing this and been quite impressed. The Cauldhame Arms has excellent facilities for the sport, having a gre^t long gutter-like urinal extending right along one wall and halfway down another, with only one drainhole.
<name>he</name>	he	Diggs	I wondered how long it would take him, and whether [MASK] would now have to go shouting through the town, warning that the mad boy who set fire to dogs was on the loose again; lock up your hounds! My father ladled some soup into my plate.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Eric	[MASK] was down the steps leading to the cellar. I saw the torch he had been holding, flickering flame against the wall of the house beneath the window to the downstairs toilet. He was attacking the door to the cellar with the axe.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Eric	I wondered, as I have often wondered, how I would have coped. But it didn’t happen to me. I have stayed here and [MASK] was the one who went away and it all happened somewhere else, and that’s all there is to it.
<name>Quilty</name>	Quilty	Blyth	1 kept quiet. When [MASK] came back the next year he was even more unpleasant than before, having lost his left leg from above the knee in a road accident (the boy he was playing ‘chicken’ with was killed).
<name>Mother</name>	Mother	Diggs	I kept staring and shivering and clutching the flowers. My father and [MASK] came along after the young man passed word along the line of people beating their way along the dunes, but I didn’t take any notice of those two, either.
<name>Thorn</name>	Thorn	Eric	A sheep cried out behind us as I fumbled for a steelie. I could hear the crackling of fires on all sides and smell roasted meat. The metal sphere fitted into the leather and I pulled. ‘[MASK]!’ I yelled, as the door gave way.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jamie	It was so obvious I couldn’t imagine why I hadn’t seen it before. I knew there was no time to lose and no point in hesitating - I was going to explode soon - so I put my head down and broke free from [MASK] and the girl, running off down the street.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Eric	I went back to my room, trying to forget about my brother; I wanted to get to bed early so that I could be up in time for the naming ceremony of the new catapult. I’d think about a better way to handle [MASK] once I had that out of the way.
<name>Rita</name>	Rita	Jamie	I nestled my shoulders against the pillar a little more firmly and sipped from my glass as [MASK]’s feet beat against my chest and the howling, crashing music thundered through the sweaty room. This sounded like it would be fun.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Eric	It took me a week to recover, and it was one of the best weeks of my life. [MASK] came back from his school cruise and I started to talk a little after he arrived; just nonsense at first, then later disjointed hints at what had happened, always followed by screaming and catatonia.
<name>He</name>	He	Eric	I already knew it wasn’t a good idea; I could hear the tone of my voice rising higher and higher as I spoke the sentence, and that was always a sign I was getting into some sort of verbal mess. [MASK] shouted: ‘Are you crazy?
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jamie	‘Couldn’t.’ ‘Just ’cause there was a girl there?’ ‘No,’ I said, and coughed. ‘Couldn’t speak. Too drunk.’ ‘What?’ laughed [MASK]. I nodded. ‘Yeah,’ I said.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Eric	Eh?’ ‘Don’t.be stupid!' I screamed into the phone, gripping it sorely with my burned hand. ‘Well, don’t say I didn’t warn you!’ [MASK] shouted. ‘Don’t worry!’ I shouted back.
<name>Snouter</name>	Snouter	Eric	‘Sooner or later. Ha ha ha ha ha!’ ‘Look, [MASK], why are you eating dogs if you can steal all that stuff?’ ‘I’ve already told you, you idiot \ you can’t eat any of that crap.’
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Paul	[MASK] hit me lightly on the knee with a podgy hand. I nodded. ‘Yes, that’s right. Bells make that noise. They’re great big hollow bits of metal filled up with noises and they let the noises out on Sunday mornings after breakfast.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Frang	It was slightly squint. I hadn’t really noticed that wallpaper for years, certainly not in all the years I had been answering the phone. It was horrible. My father was a fool to have chosen it. ‘[MASK]?’ He cleared his throat.
<name>Running Dog</name>	Running Dog	Eric	Home in time for dinner, I wolfed down my eggs, steak, chips and beans, and spent the rest of the evening watching television and picking bits of dead cow out of my mouth with a match. 10: Running Dog It always annoyed me that [MASK] went crazy.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Colin	One of his relations worked there, and had found some old warship with one magazine still loaded with the explosive. [MASK] bought the cordite and used it to light fires with. Uncontained, cordite makes a very good firelighter.
<name>Roger</name>	Roger	Paul	Over my shoulder when I looked back, I saw [MASK]. He was still by the bomb, whacking the sand with his plank, using both hands to hold it and bringing it down with all his strength, jumping up in the air at the same time and yelling.
<name>Rebus</name>	Rebus	Frank	I broke in quickly. ‘Eh?’ He sounded confused. ‘You mentioned party-size packets of crisps as being something you couldn’t eat.’ ‘For Christ’s sake, [MASK], could you eat a party-size packet of crisps?’
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jamie	In the morning I called [MASK], got his mother, and found out he had gone to the doctor’s but would be straight back. 1 packed my day-pack and told my father I’d be back in the early evening, then set off for the town.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Eric	‘Yes, [MASK]. They’re looking for him on the moors.’ ‘On the moors?’ ‘They think he might be on the moors.’ ‘Yes, that would account for them looking for him there.’ ‘Indeed,’ my father nodded.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Eric	‘Tell me where you are before your money runs out.’ ‘But if you’re here you must know. Don’t you know where you are?’ He started to giggle. I said calmly: ‘Stop being silly, [MASK].’
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Eric	I was lucky, again. Nobody saw anything, and nobody could believe that I had done it. I was distracted with grief this time, torn by guilt, and [MASK] had to look after me while I acted my part to perfection, though I say it myself.
<name>Sophie</name>	Sophie	Esmerelda	I kept them in the shed and eventually had to put the bikes outside under a tarpaulin when the collection got too large. That summer I took [MASK] kiting quite a lot. I let her play with a small, single-string kite while I used a stunter.
<name>Sirius</name>	Sirius	Sirius	I painted the head of a dog on the canvas in red paint because I had yet to learn I was not a Canis. My father had told me years before that I was born under the starsign of the Dog because [MASK] was overhead at the time.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Eric	I had hoped foi [MASK]’s face, or some further clue about what was going to ha spen, but I got nothing. I leaned forward, blew out the wasp candles, right then left, then blew through one eye and extinguished the candle inside the dog skull.
