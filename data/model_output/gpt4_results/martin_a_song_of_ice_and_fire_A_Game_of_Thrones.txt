<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Bran	The bald man took hold of his hair with his free hand and twisted it cruelly, till [MASK] sobbed in pain. "You shut your mouth, cripple, you hear me?" He twisted harder. “You hear me!”
<name>Maester</name>	Maester	Luwin	His robe was grey wool, trimmed with white fur, the Stark colors. Its great floppy sleeves had pockets hidden inside. [MASK] was always tucking things into those sleeves and producing other things from them: books, messages, strange artifacts, toys for the children.
<name>Jon</name>	Jon	Ned	This morning he had been so heartsick and weary he could scarcely stand, but now his fury was on him, filling him with strength. Men called out to him as he crossed the castle yard, but [MASK] ignored them in his haste. He would have run,
<name>Bran</name>	Bran	Jon	Some of the ravens were still eating, long stringy bits of meat dangling from their beaks. The rest seemed to be watching him. [MASK] could feel the weight of all those tiny black eyes. "And this is my day ... is that what you're saying?"
<name>Griff</name>	Griff	Tyrion	Spirits of the air!" The prince laughed, as he always laughed when his bodyguard did this mummer's farce. [MASK] was used to it. "Down here." The tall man peered down at the ground, and pre- tended to notice him.
<name>Theon</name>	Theon	Marillion	He huddled beneath its folds silently, and for once had nothing to say. They heard the deep growls of shadowcats behind them before they had gone half a mile, and later the wild snarling of the beasts fighting over the corpses they had left behind. [MASK] grew visibly pale.
<name>Stannis</name>	Stannis	Jon	You were the one should have been king, you or [MASK]." "You had the better claim, Your Grace." "I told you to drink, not to argue. You made me king, you could at least have the courtesy to listen when I talk, damn you.
<name>Bran</name>	Bran	Bran	His fur was white, where the rest of the litter was grey. His eyes were as red as the blood of the ragged man who had died that morning. [MASK] thought it curious that this pup alone would have opened his eyes while the others were still blind.
<name>Eddard</name>	Eddard	Ned	We went to war when Lannister armies were ravaging the riverlands, and [MASK] was a prisoner, falsely accused of treason. We fought to defend ourselves, and to win my lord's freedom. "Well, the one is done, and the other forever beyond our reach.
<name>Jonquil</name>	Jonquil	Sam	Set them to churning butter and their hands blister and bleed. Give them an axe to split logs, and they cut off their own foot." "I know one thing [MASK] could do better than anyone." "Yes?"
<name>Arya</name>	Arya	Arya	[MASK] thrust her wooden sword through her belt and began to climb, leaping from cask to cask until she could reach the window. Grasping the stone with both hands, she pulled herself up. The wall was three feet thick, the window a tunnel slanting up and out.
<name>Drizzt</name>	Drizzt	Bronn	"Then we ought to sing and send them fleeing in terror." He began to whistle a tune. "You're mad, dwarf," [MASK] said as he cleaned the grease out from under his nails with his dirk.
<name>Tyrion</name>	Tyrion	Ned	He pulled the heavy silver hand clasp from a pocket in the lining of his cloak and tossed it on the bed. "Like it or not, you are my Hand, damn you. I forbid you to leave." [MASK] picked up the silver clasp.
<name>Dany</name>	Dany	Dany	"Over there, sweet princess," he whispered, "there is the khal himself." [MASK] wanted to run. and hide, but her brother was looking at her, and if she displeased him she knew she would wake the dragon.
<name>Arya</name>	Arya	Arya	only that would take her right past the barracks of the gold cloaks. She couldn't go that way. [MASK] tried to think of another way. If she crossed to the other side of the castle, she could creep along the river wall and through the little godswood . . .
<name>her</name>	her	Sansa	The queen had given her freedom of the castle as a reward for being good, yet even so, she was escorted everywhere she went. "Honor guards for my daughter-to-be," the queen called them, but they did not make [MASK] feel honored.
<name>Odysseus</name>	Odysseus	Theon	It is time to hoist our sails and go forth into the world with fire and sword, as he did." [MASK] smiled. "I could not agree more." "A man agrees with god as a raindrop with the storm."
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Jon	" [MASK] almost choked on the word. The accusation was so unjust it took his breath away. "They were the ones who came after me. Four of them." "Four that you've humiliated in the yard. Four who are probably afraid of you.
<name>Catelyn</name>	Catelyn	Catelyn	He can see to your man's hurts." [MASK] had more faith in a maester's learning than a septon's prayers. She was about to say as much when she saw the battlements ahead, long parapets built into the very stone of the mountains on either side of them.
<name>Thorn</name>	Thorn	Bran	" She lowered her leg to stand on two feet. "Father, will [MASK] come and live with us now?" "Not for a long time, sweet one," he told her. "He needs to win his strength back."
<name>Alayne</name>	Alayne	Robb	" It was the reply she had expected, no more and no less. Her hands throbbed with pain, as if the blade were still in her, cutting deep. She sent the servants away and looked back to [MASK]. "Do you have the answer yet?
<name>Sansa</name>	Sansa	Arya	" It was all [MASK] could do to get out of the road before they ran her down, four guardsmen on huge horses, pounding past at a gallop. They wore checked cloaks, blue-and-burgundy.
<name>Bronn</name>	Bronn	Chiggen	Back at the inn, you and [MASK] helped take me captive. Why? The others saw it as their duty, for the honor of the lords they served, but not you two. You had no lord, no duty, and precious little honor, so why trouble to involve yourselves?"
<name>Brienne</name>	Brienne	Ned	Come, let's ride, you used to know how. I want to feel the wind in my hair again." He kicked his horse back into motion and galloped up over the barrow, raining earth down behind him. For a moment [MASK] did not follow.
<name>Jon</name>	Jon	Jon	He could feel the great weight of all that ice pressing down on him, as if it were about to topple, and somehow [MASK] knew that if it fell, the world fell with it. "Makes you wonder what lies beyond," a familiar voice said.
<name>Old Nan</name>	Old Nan	Bran	Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides its face for years at a time, and little children are born and live and die all in darkness while the direwolves grow gaunt and hungry, and the white walkers move through the woods." "You mean the Others," [MASK] said querulously.
<name>Ramsay</name>	Ramsay	Joffrey	No," she said, her voice a frightened gasp. "Please, no, don't make me, I beg you . . ." [MASK] pressed his lips together. "I want to show you what happens to traitors."
<name>Jon</name>	Jon	Jon	[MASK] made himself smile back at them, but his heart was not in it. He knew he should be pleased, yet he did not feel it. His hand ached, and the taste of anger was in his mouth, though he could not have said who he was angry with or why.
<name>Melisandre</name>	Melisandre	Irri	She glimpsed the shadow of a great wolf, and another like a man wreathed in flames. "The Lamb Woman knows the secrets of the birthing bed," [MASK] said. "She said so, I heard her."
<name>Sansa</name>	Sansa	Arya	A stone came sailing out of the crowd. [MASK] cried out as she saw her father hit. The gold cloaks kept him from falling. Blood ran down his face from a deep gash across his forehead. More stones followed.
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Catelyn	"I knew he would rise high," [MASK] said. "He was always clever, even as a boy, but it is one thing to be clever and another to be wise. I wonder what the years have done to him."
<name>Conan</name>	Conan	Tyrion	[MASK] put his heel on the grasping fingers and felt a satisfying crunch. "Close your eyes and pretend you're dead," he advised the singer before he hefted the axe and turned away. After that, things ran together.
<name>Tyrion</name>	Tyrion	Tyrion	There are wild things in the woods, direwolves and mammoths and snow bears the size of aurochs, and 1 have seen darker shapes in my dreams." "In your dreams," [MASK] echoed, thinking how badly he needed another strong drink.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Jon	He stood. "Let's go outside." The round fat face looked up at him, suspicious. "Why? What will we do outside?" "Talk," [MASK] said. "Have you seen the Wall?"
<name>Arya</name>	Arya	Syrio	The longsword crunched through mail and leather and flesh. The man on his knees shrieked. Before his killer could wrench free his blade, [MASK] jabbed him in the apple of his throat. The guardsman gave a choked cry and staggered back, clutching at his neck, his face blackening.
<name>Tyrion</name>	Tyrion	Robert	"Seven hells, don't start with her again. That's done, I'll hear no more of it." "Why would you want me as your Hand, if you refuse to listen to my counsel?" "Why?" [MASK] laughed.
<name>Jaime</name>	Jaime	Jaime	[MASK] wore the white cloak of the Kingsguard over his golden armor. I can see him still. Even his sword was gilded. He was seated on the Iron Throne, high above his knights, wearing a helm fashioned in the shape of a lion's head.
<name>Beric</name>	Beric	Oihoi	[MASK], he thought, reeling back. Gods, he’s dead, he’s dead, I saw him dead. He felt something scrabble at his ankle. Black fingers clawed at his calf. The arm was crawling up his leg, ripping at wool and flesh.
<name>Jon</name>	Jon	Bran	" His half brother put a second pup into his arms. "There are five of them." [MASK] sat down in the snow and hugged the wolf pup' to his face. Its fur was soft and warm against his cheek.
<name>Samwell</name>	Samwell	Jon	The sword, where was the sword? He'd lost the damned sword1. When he opened his mouth to scream, the wight jammed its black corpse fingers into [MASK]'s mouth. Gagging, he tried to shove it off, but the dead man was too heavy.
<name>Syrio</name>	Syrio	Syrio	“Feat cuts deeper than swords, ” she said aloud, but it was no good pretending to be a water dancer, [MASK] had been a water dancer and the white knight had probably killed him, and anyhow she was only a little girl with a wooden stick, alone and afraid.
<name>Daenerys</name>	Daenerys	Dany	Even the mightiest of khals bowed to the wisdom and authority of the dosh khaleen. Still, it gave [MASK] the shivers to think that one day she might be sent to join them, whether she willed it or no.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Septa	The rap came again, sharply. "Do you hear me?" "Yes, [MASK]," she called out. "Might I have a moment to dress, please?" Her eyes were red from crying, but she did her best to make herself beautiful.
<name>Jon</name>	Jon	Jon	"I don't like high places." It was too much. [MASK] frowned, incredulous. "Are you afraid of everything'!" he asked. "I don't understand. If you are truly so craven, why are you here?
<name>Bran</name>	Bran	Bran	he heard his own voice saying, small and far away. And his father's voice replied to him. "That is the only time a man can be brave." Now, [MASK], the crow urged. Choose. Fly or die.
<name>Griffith</name>	Griffith	M'lord	They come and drank their fill and spilled the rest before they fired my roof, and they would of spilled my blood too, if they'd caught me. [MASK]." "They burnt us out," a farmer beside him said.
<name>Sansa</name>	Sansa	Illyrio	She would even have welcomed the conversation of [MASK] and her brother, but they were too far below to hear her. So she sat in her wedding silks, nursing a cup of honeyed wine, afraid to eat, talking silently to herself.
<name>Dany</name>	Dany	Dany	Another step, and [MASK] could feel the heat of the sand on the soles of her feet, even through her sandals. Sweat ran down her thighs and between her breasts and in rivulets over her cheeks, where tears had once run.
<name>Tyrion</name>	Tyrion	Ned	He took the wineskin back and drank. [MASK] studied the eunuch's face, searching for truth beneath the mummer's scars and false stubble. He tried some more wine. This time it went down easier. "Can you free me from this pit?"
<name>Syrio</name>	Syrio	Syrio	She looked around wildly, but there was no one in the stable but her, and the horses, and the dead men. Quiet as a shadow, she heard. Was it her own voice, or [MASK]'s? She could not tell, yet somehow it calmed her fears.
<name>Joffrey</name>	Joffrey	Joffrey	[MASK] looked pouty; somehow she was upsetting him. "You haven't said what you mean to give me for my name day. Maybe I should give you something instead, would you like that?" "If it please you, my lord,"'Sansa said.
<name>Jonas</name>	Jonas	Jon	They are both beggars in black, hated and misunderstood." [MASK] wished he understood what they were talking about, and why. What did he care about ravens and doves? If the old man had something to say to him, why couldn't he just say it?
<name>Sansa</name>	Sansa	Sansa	"We did not know what else to do with her." The queen frowned. "Next time, you will ask," she said, her voice sharp. "The gods only know what sort of tales she's been filling [MASK]'s head with."
<name>Alanna</name>	Alanna	Dany	[MASK] gasped. They were the most beautiful things she had ever seen, each different than the others, patterned in such rich colors that at first she thought they were crusted with jewels, and so large it took both of her hands to hold one.
<name>Catelyn</name>	Catelyn	Ned	The look [MASK] gave her was anguished. "You know I cannot take him south. There will be no place for him at court. A boy with a bastard's name . . . you know what they will say of him. He will be shunned."
<name>Bran</name>	Bran	Royce	He could feel the sweet, sticky sap on his cheek. A shadow emerged from the dark of the wood. It stood in front of [MASK]. Tall, it was, and gaunt and hard as old bones, with flesh pale as milk.
<name>Jon</name>	Jon	Ned	"I killed the bastard, didn't I?" A lock of matted black hair fell across his eyes as he glared up at [MASK]. "Ought to do the same for you. Can't leave a man to hunt in peace.
<name>Needle</name>	Needle	Needle	He shuffled toward her. "It's the queen who'll be rewarding me. Come here, girl." "Stay away!" Her fingers closed around [MASK]'s hilt. "I says, come." He grabbed her arm, hard.
<name>Jon</name>	Jon	Jon	My place is here . . . where is yours, boy?" I have no place, [MASK] wanted to say, I’m a bastard, I have no rights, no name, no mother, and now not even a father. The words would not come.
<name>Arya</name>	Arya	Joffrey	I can find the door myself." He bowed to [MASK]. "Perchance later you'll tell me how a nine-year-old girl the size of a wet rat managed to disarm you with a broom handle and throw your sword in the river."
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Catelyn	Look how wide the path is." "I don't want to look." The world seemed to be spinning around her, mountain and sky and mules, whirling like a child's top. [MASK] closed her eyes to steady her ragged breathing.
<name>Arya</name>	Arya	Robb	A man with an axe rushed in, shouting and heedless. [MASK]'s sword caught him full in the face with a sickening crunch and a spray of bright blood. The man with the gaunt stubbly face made a grab for the reins, and for half a second he had them . . .
<name>Dany</name>	Dany	Dany	The day was too perfect. The sky was a deep blue, and high above them a hunting hawk circled. The grass sea swayed and sighed with each breath of wind, the air was warm on her face, and [MASK] felt at peace.
<name>Jon</name>	Jon	Sam	The Night's Watch"—he reached inside the deer, ripped out its heart, and held it in his fist, red and dripping—"or this." [MASK] told the tale in a calm, dead voice, as if it were something that had happened to someone else, not to him.
<name>Stevie</name>	Stevie	Jon	he asked ... I mean ... I think he knew, he sees things no one else sees . . "He's blind," [MASK] pointed out forcefully, disgusted. "I can find the way myself."
<name>Enrique</name>	Enrique	Brynden	"And beyond that?" [MASK] smiled. "Beyond that, the path is too steep even for mules. We ascend on foot the rest of the way. Or perchance you'd prefer to ride a basket.
<name>Samwell</name>	Samwell	Chett	[MASK] is going to the kennels, to help with the hounds. You shall have his cell, so as to be close to the maester night and day. I trust you will take good care of him. He is very old and very precious to us.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Bran	and night, howling. Every time they chase it away, it returns. The maester said they closed the window once, to shut out the noise, and [MASK] seemed to weaken. When they opened it again, his heart beat stronger." The queen shuddered.
<name>Daenerys</name>	Daenerys	Daenerys	but 1 can." He laid the point of his sword between [MASK]'s breasts and slid it downward, over the curve of her belly. "I want what I came for," he told her. "I want the crown he promised me.
<name>She</name>	She	Sansa	With a delicacy surprising in such a big man, he dabbed at the blood welling from her broken lip. The moment was gone. [MASK] lowered her eyes. "Thank you," she said when he was done. She was a good girl, and always remembered her courtesies.
<name>Elia</name>	Elia	Tyrion	She had all of her mother's beauty, and none of her nature. "His back is broken, little one," [MASK] told her. "The fall shattered his legs as well. They keep him alive with honey and water, or he would starve to death.
<name>Barristan</name>	Barristan	Will	It saw. The broken sword fell from nerveless fingers. [MASK] closed his eyes to pray. Long, elegant hands brushed his cheek, then tightened around his throat. They were gloved in the finest moleskin and sticky with blood, yet the touch was icy cold.
<name>Tyrion</name>	Tyrion	Ned	The queen." [MASK] released his hold on her arm. There were deep red marks on her skin. "Gods," he whispered. His voice was hoarse. "Your sister is sick with grief. She cannot know what she is saying."
<name>Asha</name>	Asha	Theon	There's war." "The maester's ravens fly over salt as soon as rock. This news is old and cold." "It means a new day, uncle," [MASK] promised. "Every morning brings a new day, much like the old."
<name>Conan</name>	Conan	Tyrion	He wanted that gold, yet he feared a trick; he had the look of a man who had often been tricked. "Is lie," he muttered darkly. "Dwarf man cheat me." "I will put my promise in writing," [MASK] vowed.
<name>Wolves</name>	Wolves	Wolves	He was clumsy and uncomfortable with his left hand, yet even so the steel seemed to flow through the air, as if it had a will of its own. "[MASK] have claws, as much as bears."
<name>Stannis</name>	Stannis	Robert	"I see a man who would sooner die than betray his king." "He betrayed one already, or have you forgotten?" the woman said. "Oh, I don't deny he's loyal to [MASK], that's obvious.
<name>Eddard</name>	Eddard	Mormont	" [MASK] shook his head. "This could not have happened at a worse time. If ever the realm needed a strong king . . . there are dark days and cold nights ahead, I feel it in my bones . . ."
<name>Arya</name>	Arya	Catelyn	He should be expecting us. Look up." [MASK] raised her eyes, up and up and up. At first all she saw was stone and trees, the looming mass of the great mountain shrouded in night, as black as a starless sky.
<name>Thoros</name>	Thoros	Ned	[MASK] laughed. "I will gladly light the torch for you." "Good man!" The king clapped him on the shoulder. "I've half a mind to leave them all behind and just keep going."
<name>Daenerys</name>	Daenerys	Dothraki	They had no common language. [MASK] was incomprehensible to her, and the khal knew only a few words of the bastard Valyrian of the Free Cities, and none at all of the Common Tongue of the Seven Kingdoms.
<name>Edmure</name>	Edmure	Joffrey	"I am pleased to hear that. Perhaps there is hope for you and [MASK] still . . "What do you want me to do?" "You must write your lady mother, and your brother, the eldest . . . what is his name?"
<name>Davos</name>	Davos	Mormont	"I thought so." [MASK] peeled the shell off a boiled egg. "Your father is dead, lad. Do you think you can bring him back?" "No," he answered, sullen.
<name>Sansa</name>	Sansa	Sansa	All the while the courses came and went. A thick soup of barley and venison. Salads of sweetgrass and spinach and plums, sprinkled with crushed nuts. Snails in honey and garlic. [MASK] had never eaten snails before,-
<name>Daenerys</name>	Daenerys	Dany	His boots were dry and cracked, his silver-blond hair matted and tangled. A longsword swung from his belt in a leather scabbard. The Dothraki eyed the sword as he passed; [MASK] heard curses and threats and angry muttering rising all around her, like a tide.
<name>Tyrion</name>	Tyrion	Ned	[MASK] stopped at last and lifted the oil lantern. The crypt continued on into darkness ahead of them, but beyond this point the tombs were empty and unsealed; black holes waiting for their dead, waiting for him and his children.
<name>Eddard</name>	Eddard	Robb	She found [MASK] beneath the green canopy of leaves, surrounded by tall redwoods and great old elms, kneeling before the heart tree, a slender weirwood with a face more sad than fierce. His longsword was before him, the point thrust in the earth, his gloved hands clasped around the hilt.
<name>Sansa</name>	Sansa	Sansa	Butterflies fluttered nervously in [MASK]'s stomach. I shouldn’t be afraid, she told herself. I have nothing to be afraid of, it will all come out well, ]off loves me and the queen does too, she said so. A herald's voice rang out.
<name>Tyrion</name>	Tyrion	Sam	[MASK] nodded miserably. "I hate the cold," he said. "Last night I woke up in the dark and the fire had gone out and I was certain I was going to freeze to death by morning." "It must have been warmer where you come from."
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Robert	The king scrawled his signature blindly, leaving a smear of blood across the letter. "The seal should be witnessed." "Serve the boar at my funeral feast," [MASK] rasped. "Apple in its mouth, skin seared crisp. Eat the bastard.
<name>Daenerys</name>	Daenerys	Robert	"[MASK] will keep an easy pace for their sakes," he said. "It is just as well. That will give us more time to prepare." "The queen's brothers are also in the party," she told him.
<name>Leaving</name>	Leaving	Arya	He was all she ever dreamt her prince should be, tall and handsome and strong, with hair like gold. She treasured every chance to spend time with him, few as they were. The only thing that scared her about today was [MASK].
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Bran	Yet under the frail cage of those shattered ribs, his chest rose and fell with each shallow breath. "[MASK]," he said, "I'm sorry I didn't come before. I was afraid." He could feel the tears rolling down his cheeks.
<name>Arya</name>	Arya	Arya	[MASK] was wrenched off her feet. She would have fallen if he hadn't held her up, as easy as if she were a doll. A face pressed close to hers, long black hair and tangled beard and rotten teeth. “Don’t look!’’
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Dany	[MASK] needed . . . something . . . someone . . . what? It was important, she knew. It was the only thing in the world that mattered. She rolled onto her side and got an elbow under her, fighting the blanket tangled about her legs.
<name>Khal</name>	Khal	Viserys	Soon there would be laughter, when the men of her khas told the story of what had happened in the grasses today. By the time [MASK] came limping back among them, every man, woman, and child in the camp would know him for a walker.
<name>Nynaeve</name>	Nynaeve	Catelyn	He fingered the collar of his order; a heavy chain worn tight around the neck beneath his robe, each link forged from a different metal. [MASK] could feel dread stirring inside her once again. "What is it that they would have us see more clearly?"
<name>Sansa</name>	Sansa	Sansa	[MASK] hated stables, smelly places full of manure and flies. Even when she went riding, she liked the boy to saddle the horse and bring it to her in the yard. "Do you want to hear about the court or not?"
<name>Jon</name>	Jon	Will	He lifted his sword high over his head, defiant. His hands trembled from the weight of it, or perhaps from the cold. Yet in that moment, [MASK] thought, he was a boy no longer, but a man of the Night's Watch.
<name>Bran</name>	Bran	Bran	"That is the only time a man can be brave," his father told him. "Do you understand why I did it?" "He was a wildling," [MASK] said. "They carry off women and sell them to the Others."
