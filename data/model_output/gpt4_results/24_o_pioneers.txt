<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Emil	No, we won't do that any more.” “All right,” [MASK] assented. “I'm sorry I made you feel bad.” As he looked down into her tearful eyes, there was a curious, sharp young bitterness in his own.
<name>Thea</name>	Thea	Marie	You don't help things any by pretending. It's then that I want to pull the corners of the Divide together. If you WON'T understand, you know, I could make you!” [MASK] clasped her hands and started up from her seat.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Amedee	On Sundays and holidays they were always arm in arm. It seemed strange that now he should have to hide the thing that [MASK] was so proud of, that the feeling which gave one of them such happiness should bring the other such despair.
<name>Creighton</name>	Creighton	Emil	He had not gone far, however, when he discovered that he was not the only person abroad. In the draw below, his gun in his hands, was [MASK], advancing cautiously, with a young woman beside him.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Ivar	Before [MASK] reached the graveyard, three miles from the house, the storm had spent itself, and the downpour had died into a soft, dripping rain. The sky and the land were a dark smoke color, and seemed to be coming together, like two waves.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Amedee	[MASK] staggered up with a gesture of despair. “How can I? I got no time to be sick. Three thousand dollars' worth of new machinery to manage, and the wheat so ripe it will begin to shatter next week.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Alexandra	That was just as well; it would be easier to talk if he were not under the gaze of those clear, deliberate eyes, that saw so far in some directions and were so blind in others. [MASK], too, was glad of the dusk.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Carl	I expect that is the only way one person ever really can help another. I think you are about the only one that ever helped me. Somehow it will take more courage to bear your going than everything that has happened before.” [MASK] looked at the ground.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Marie	[MASK] pulled a dark purple silk necktie from her workbasket. “I knit this for him. It's a good color, don't you think? Will you please put it in with your things and tell him it's from me, to wear when he goes serenading.”
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Ivar	“[MASK],” she said suddenly, beginning to trace the pattern on the oilcloth with her forefinger, “I came to-day more because I wanted to talk to you than because I wanted to buy a hammock.” “Yes?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Alexandra	[MASK] pointed to a shining sheet of water that lay at the bottom of a shallow draw. At one end of the pond was an earthen dam, planted with green willow bushes, and above it a door and a single window were set into the hillside.
<name>Reuben</name>	Reuben	Emil	She sat with the ease that belongs to persons of an essentially happy nature, who can find a comfortable spot almost anywhere; who are supple, and quick in adapting themselves to circumstances. After a final swish, [MASK] snapped the gate and sprang into the cart, holding his scythe well out over the wheel.
<name>Undine</name>	Undine	Alexandra	The trouble is you almost have to marry a man before you can find out the sort of wife he needs; and usually it's exactly the sort you are not. Then what are you going to do about it?” she asked candidly. [MASK] confessed she didn't know.
<name>Emil</name>	Emil	Oscar	When you drive about over the country you can feel it coming.” [MASK] had been sitting with his head lowered, his hands hanging between his knees. “But we can't work so much land,” he said dully, as if he were talking to himself.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Marie	After he was gone, [MASK] went out to the back porch to begin her butter-making. A brisk wind had come up and was driving puffy white clouds across the sky. The orchard was sparkling and rippling in the sun.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Emil	“Thank you,” he returned shortly. She sighed despondently. “Everything I say makes you cross, don't it? And you never used to be cross to me.” [MASK] took a step nearer and stood frowning down at her bent head.
<name>Sonia</name>	Sonia	Alexandra	She felt at once that this interview was a terrible ordeal to him. His shaved head, showing the conformation of his skull, gave him a criminal look which he had not had during the trial. [MASK] held out her hand.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Alexandra	Her visitor winced. “How direct you are, [MASK]! Just like you used to be. Do I give myself away so quickly? Well, you see, for one thing, there's nothing to look forward to in my profession.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Carl	They're always trying to catch me up. If I were you, I wouldn't pay any attention to them. There's nothing to get upset about. [MASK]'s a sensible fellow. He won't mind them.” “I don't know.
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Alexandra	We've never either of us had any other close friend. And now--” [MASK] wiped her eyes with the corner of her apron, “and now I must remember that you are going where you will have many friends, and will find the work you were meant to do.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Emil	Do you agree with them that I have no right to change my way of living?” [MASK] looked at the outline of his sister's head in the dim light. They were sitting close together and he somehow felt that she could hear his thoughts.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Emil	I don't know anything except how miserable I am. And I thought it would be all right when you came back. Oh, [MASK],” she clutched his sleeve and began to cry, “what am I to do if you don't go away?
<name>Abel</name>	Abel	Emil	They come to it and are not disturbed. Maybe I sprinkle a little corn. They tell the other birds, and next year more come this way. They have their roads up there, as we have down here.” [MASK] rubbed his knees thoughtfully.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Frank	He sat down on the bottom step of the box stairway and tried to get his wits together. In that unnatural quiet there was no sound but his own heavy breathing. Suddenly an owl began to hoot out in the fields. [MASK] lifted his head.
<name>Antonia</name>	Antonia	Marie	Behind her the fireflies were weaving in and out over the wheat. He put his hand on her bent head. “On my honor, [MASK], if you will say you love me, I will go away.” She lifted her face to his.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Emil	Stepping off the header without stopping it, he ran up to [MASK] who had dismounted. “Come along,” he called. “I have to go over to the engine for a minute. I gotta green man running it, and I gotta to keep an eye on him.”
<name>Ántonia</name>	Ántonia	Carl	“Did you plant those, too? They are such beautiful little trees.” [MASK] fingered the blue-green leaves, porous like blotting-paper and shaped like birch leaves, hung on waxen red stems. “Yes, I think I did.
<name>Farfrae</name>	Farfrae	Alexandra	He dislikes human habitations, so [MASK] has fitted him up a room in the barn, where he is very comfortable, being near the horses and, as he says, further from temptations. No one has ever found out what his temptations are.
<name>Ántonia</name>	Ántonia	Alexandra	I'm not going to leave him by himself on the prairie, for cattle to run over.” She began to cry more bitterly. The boys looked angry. [MASK] put a soothing hand on her mother's shoulder. “There's no question of that, mother.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Emil	And then, all at once, men began to come to me offering to lend me money--and I didn't need it! Then I went ahead and built this house. I really built it for [MASK].
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Carl	I'll have to take you over to see her to-morrow.” [MASK] dropped the end of his cigar softly among the castor beans and sighed. “Yes, I suppose I must see the old place. I'm cowardly about things that remind me of myself.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Marie	“I can't pray to have the things I want,” he said slowly, “and I won't pray not to have them, not if I'm damned for it.” [MASK] turned away, wringing her hands.
<name>She</name>	She	Marie	They all know it. Anybody here feels free to borrow the mower and break it, or turn their hogs in on me. They know you won't care!” [MASK] hurried away to make his coffee. When she came back, he was fast asleep.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lou	“The property of a family really belongs to the men of the family, no matter about the title. If anything goes wrong, it's the men that are held responsible.” “Yes, of course,” [MASK] broke in. “Everybody knows that.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Emil	As it was, they resented every change in his speech, in his dress, in his point of view; though the latter they had to conjecture, for [MASK] avoided talking to them about any but family matters. All his interests they treated as affectations.
<name>Lincoln</name>	Lincoln	Carl	“But you yourself, [MASK]--with that beard--how could I have known you? You went away a little boy.” She reached for his suitcase and when he intercepted her she threw up her hands. “You see, I give myself away.
<name>Rudolf</name>	Rudolf	Emil	Down there they have a little certainty, but up with us there is a big chance. We must have faith in the high land, [MASK]. I want to hold on harder than ever, and when you're a man you'll thank me.”
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Alexandra	“[MASK],” he said as he approached her, “I want to talk to you. Let's sit down by the gooseberry bushes.” He picked up her sack of potatoes and they crossed the garden. “Boys gone to town?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Marie	[MASK] shook her head, pursing her lips and blowing her warm breath softly out into the frosty air. “No; I was spoiled at home. I like my own way, and I have a quick tongue.
<name>He</name>	He	Ivar	Next morning, when the sun rose, I went out to take her food, but she flew up into the sky and went on her way.” [MASK] ran his fingers through his thick hair. “I have many strange birds stop with me here.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Oscar	“Come, the horses are done eating. Let's hitch up and get out of here. He'll fill her full of notions. She'll be for having the pigs sleep with us, next.” [MASK] grunted and got up.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Emil	I gotta green man running it, and I gotta to keep an eye on him.” [MASK] thought the lad was unnaturally flushed and more excited than even the cares of managing a big farm at a critical time warranted.
<name>Osmond</name>	Osmond	Frank	His unhappy temperament was like a cage; he could never get out of it; and he felt that other people, his wife in particular, must have put him there. It had never more than dimly occurred to [MASK] that he made his own unhappiness.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Annie	I know plenty of grown folks that ain't,” he said bluntly. [MASK] threw up her chin. “She has got on good, and she's going to play for her commencement when she graduates in town next year.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Alexandra	He sprang up and began to wind the clock furiously. “I won't slave to pay off another mortgage. I'll never do it. You'd just as soon kill us all, [MASK], to carry out some scheme!”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Marie	[MASK] drew back. “Because I was in love with him,” she said firmly. “Really?” he asked incredulously. “Yes, indeed. Very much in love with him. I think I was the one who suggested our running away.
<name>Emil</name>	Emil	Oscar	“Everybody knows that. [MASK] and me have always been easy-going and we've never made any fuss. We were willing you should hold the land and have the good of it, but you got no right to part with any of it.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Frank	The warden listened genially while she told him briefly something of [MASK]'s history and character, but he did not seem to find anything unusual in her account. “Sure, I'll keep an eye on him. We'll take care of him all right,”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Ivar	The old man scraped his bare feet on the plank floor. “We have a big bunch of hogs, [MASK]. I wouldn't sell in the spring, when everybody advised me to, and now so many people are losing their hogs that I am frightened.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Emil	As he went about gathering up his books he felt as if he were uprooting things. At last he threw himself down on the old slat lounge where he had slept when he was little, and lay looking up at the familiar cracks in the ceiling. “Tired, [MASK]?” his sister asked.
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Alexandra	“About sending me away; to the asylum.” [MASK] put down her sewing-basket. “Nobody has come to me with such talk,” she said decidedly. “Why need you listen? You know I would never consent to such a thing.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Lou	[MASK]'s thin face reddened up to the roots of his bristly hair. “Oh, we've only begun. We're waking up to a sense of our responsibilities, out here, and we ain't afraid, neither. You fellows back there must be a tame lot.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Alexandra	Most of [MASK]'s happy memories were as impersonal as this one; yet to her they were very personal. Her mind was a white book, with clear writing about weather and beasts and growing things. Not many people would have cared to read it; only a happy few.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Alexandra	It's a good color, don't you think? Will you please put it in with your things and tell him it's from me, to wear when he goes serenading.” [MASK] laughed. “I don't believe he goes serenading much.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Carl	“How many times we have walked this path together, [MASK]. How many times we will walk it again! Does it seem to you like coming back to your own place? Do you feel at peace with the world here? I think we shall be very happy.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Emil	It most often came to her on Sunday mornings, the one day in the week when she lay late abed listening to the familiar morning sounds; the windmill singing in the brisk breeze, [MASK] whistling as he blacked his boots down by the kitchen door.
<name>Emil</name>	Emil	Frank	Most Bohemians are good-natured, but [MASK] thinks we don't appreciate him here, I guess. He's jealous about everything, his farm and his horses and his pretty wife. Everybody likes her, just the same as when she was little.
<name>Emil</name>	Emil	Lou	“Well, the only way we can find out is to try. [MASK] and I have different notions about feeding stock, and that's a good thing. It's bad if all the members of a family think alike. They never get anywhere.
<name>Whitney</name>	Whitney	Frank	He went into his bedroom and took his murderous 405 Winchester from the closet. When [MASK] took up his gun and walked out of the house, he had not the faintest purpose of doing anything with it. He did not believe that he had any real grievance.
<name>Abel</name>	Abel	Ivar	I have to tell her when to eat and when to go to bed.” “Patience, patience, sister,” muttered [MASK] as he settled the bit in the horse's mouth. “When the eyes of the flesh are shut, the eyes of the spirit are open.
<name>Laura</name>	Laura	Emil	Long fingers of light reached through the apple branches as through a net; the orchard was riddled and shot with gold; light was the reality, the trees were merely interferences that reflected and refracted light. [MASK] went softly down between the cherry trees toward the wheatfield.
<name>Thornhill</name>	Thornhill	Alexandra	You know I don't go away from home often, and I came up here on purpose to tell you this.” The warden at the glass door looked in inquiringly. [MASK] nodded, and he came in and touched the white button on his desk.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Milly	Things has changed since we was girls. [MASK] has it very different. We are going to rent the place and move into town as soon as the girls are old enough to go out into company. A good many are doing that here now.
<name>Abner</name>	Abner	Ivar	“Where do you suppose she can be, [MASK]?” The old man lifted a set of single harness carefully from its peg. “How should I know?” “But you think she is at the graveyard, don't you?”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Frank	He wanted to prove to himself the wrong he felt. What did she hide in her heart? Where did it go? Even [MASK] had his churlish delicacies; he never reminded her of how much she had once loved him.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Emil	And he ran like a hare, back and forth about that moonlit space, before he could make up his mind to go into the dark stable for a horse. The thought of going into a doorway was terrible to him. He caught [MASK]'s horse by the bit and led it out.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Emil	[MASK] shivered. “I don't know. Seems to me it gets worse as it goes on. The worst of the Swedes is that they're never willing to find out how much they don't know. It was like that at the University.
<name>Estelle</name>	Estelle	Marie	Vous etes tres savante, ma fille.” He patted her yellow turban, calling, “Venez donc, mes garcons! Il y a ici une veritable clairvoyante!” [MASK] was clever at fortune-telling, indulging in a light irony that amused the crowd.
<name>Alvin</name>	Alvin	Frank	“Why don't you go over there some afternoon and hog-tight her fences? You'd save time for yourself in the end.” [MASK]'s neck stiffened. “Not-a-much, I won't. I keep my hogs home.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Frank	[MASK] went slowly down to the orchard gate, stopped and stood for a moment lost in thought. He retraced his steps and looked through the barn and the hayloft. Then he went out to the road, where he took the foot-path along the outside of the orchard hedge.
<name>Thurlow</name>	Thurlow	Hiller	Even in his agitation he was handsome, but he looked a rash and violent man. Barely saluting the callers, he turned at once to his wife and began, in an outraged tone, “I have to leave my team to drive the old woman [MASK]'s hogs out-a my wheat.
<name>Rosa</name>	Rosa	Alexandra	We will all work the place together.” “And you will be guided by your sister, boys, and be good brothers to her, and good sons to your mother? That is good. And [MASK] must not work in the fields any more.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Alexandra	I can't believe this!” [MASK] shook the tears from her eyes and laughed. The stranger nodded to his driver, dropped his suitcase inside the fence, and opened the gate. “Then you are glad to see me, and you can put me up overnight?
<name>Carl</name>	Carl	Carl	“Suppose I do will my land to their children, what difference will that make? The land belongs to the future, [MASK]; that's the way it seems to me. How many of the names on the county clerk's plat will be there in fifty years?
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Alexandra	From time to time he rose and wandered about the house, picking up stray volumes and bringing them listlessly back to his box. He was packing without enthusiasm. He was not very sanguine about his future. [MASK] sat sewing by the table.
<name>Olaf</name>	Olaf	Alexandra	The three pretty young Swedish girls who did [MASK]'s housework were cutting pies, refilling coffeecups, placing platters of bread and meat and potatoes upon the red tablecloth, and continually getting in each other's way between the table and the stove.
<name>Jurgis</name>	Jurgis	Lou	“He's rich now, that's why he can take a chance.” “Why can't we? We'll live longer than he will. Some day the land itself will be worth more than all we can ever raise on it.” [MASK] laughed.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Ivar	[MASK]. There's nothing to be worried about. I'm sorry if I've scared you all. I didn't notice the storm till it was on me, and I couldn't walk against it. I'm glad you've come.
<name>Alida</name>	Alida	Alexandra	The old man followed [MASK], but when she motioned him to a chair he shook his head. She took up her workbasket and waited for him to speak. He stood looking at the carpet, his bushy head bowed, his hands clasped in front of him.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Carl	She put her hand on his arm. “I needed you terribly when it happened, [MASK]. I cried for you at night. Then everything seemed to get hard inside of me, and I thought perhaps I should never care for you again.
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Alexandra	“That's all I hate about it, [MASK],” he said slowly. “You've stood by us through so much and helped father out so many times, and now it seems as if we were running off and leaving you to face the worst of it.
<name>Rainsford</name>	Rainsford	Emil	I hate to see them when they are first shot. They were having such a good time, and we've spoiled it all for them.” [MASK] gave a rather sore laugh. “I should say we had! I'm not going hunting with you any more.
<name>She</name>	She	Alexandra	Every few moments a boy would come running down the flagged walk and dash out into the street as if he were rushing to announce some wonder to the world. [MASK] felt a great tenderness for them all. She wished one of them would stop and speak to her.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alexandra	“Oh! I'm not a painter, [MASK]. I'm an engraver. I have nothing to do with painting.” “But on my parlor wall I have the paintings--” He interrupted nervously. “Oh, water-color sketches--done for amusement.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Emil	No, I don't want any supper. We had supper at five o'clock, at the fair.” [MASK] was glad to escape and get to his own room. He was a little ashamed for his sister, though he had tried not to show it.
<name>Joad</name>	Joad	Ivar	“It don't seem right that we must all be so miserable. Why do we all have to be punished? Seems to me like good times would never come again.” [MASK] expressed himself in a deep sigh, but said nothing.
<name>Wilmot</name>	Wilmot	Grandfather	He wrote a fine, regular hand, almost like engraving. Yours is something like his, when you take pains.” “[MASK] was really crooked, was he?” “He married an unscrupulous woman, and then--then I'm afraid he was really crooked.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Alexandra	He often called his daughter in to talk to her about this. Before [MASK] was twelve years old she had begun to be a help to him, and as she grew older he had come to depend more and more upon her resourcefulness and good judgment.
<name>Ántonia</name>	Ántonia	Marie	The orchard was sparkling and rippling in the sun. [MASK] stood looking toward it wistfully, her hand on the lid of the churn, when she heard a sharp ring in the air, the merry sound of the whetstone on the scythe. That invitation decided her.
<name>Florian</name>	Florian	Emil	[MASK] laughed shortly. “People who want such little things surely ought to have them,” he said dryly. He thrust his hand into the pocket of his velvet trousers and brought out a handful of uncut turquoises, as big as marbles.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Emil	[MASK] had returned only the night before, and his sister was so proud of him that she decided at once to take him up to the church supper, and to make him wear the Mexican costume he had brought home in his trunk.
<name>Josephine</name>	Josephine	Alexandra	[MASK] talked to the men about their crops and to the women about their poultry. She spent a whole day with one young farmer who had been away at school, and who was experimenting with a new kind of clover hay. She learned a great deal.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alexandra	[MASK] tried not to see his hideous clothes. She tried to look straight into his face, which she could scarcely believe was his. It was already bleached to a chalky gray. His lips were colorless, his fine teeth looked yellowish.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Alexandra	Shall I call them?” He sighed. “No, no. Wait until they come in. [MASK], you will have to do the best you can for your brothers. Everything will come on you.” “I will do all I can, father.”
<name>Yulka</name>	Yulka	Ivar	“I could have hidden it under the straw in the bottom of the wagon.” “Then we'd have had to lie to [MASK]. Besides, they say he can smell dead birds. And if he knew, we wouldn't get anything out of him, not even a hammock.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Emil	“Since you have been here, ten years now, I have never really been lonely. But I can remember what it was like before. Now I shall have nobody but [MASK]. But he is my boy, and he is tender-hearted.”
<name>Ántonia</name>	Ántonia	Alexandra	Sometimes he talks about studying law, and sometimes, just lately, he's been talking about going out into the sand hills and taking up more land. He has his sad times, like father. But I hope he won't do that. We have land enough, at last!” [MASK] laughed.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Amedee	“Stop, [MASK]. You're knocking the wind out of me. I brought him cups and spoons and blankets and moccasins enough for an orphan asylum. I'm awful glad it's a boy, sure enough!”
<name>Sylvia</name>	Sylvia	Alexandra	That evening, after she had washed the supper dishes, [MASK] sat down on the kitchen doorstep, while her mother was mixing the bread. It was a still, deep-breathing summer night, full of the smell of the hay fields.
<name>Frances</name>	Frances	Alexandra	She came up and put her hand on his shoulder. “I've been wishing you could stay with me this winter.” “That's just what I don't want to do, [MASK]. I'm restless. I want to go to a new place.
