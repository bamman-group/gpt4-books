<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ike	‘“Come,” he said waving. I forgot my head where I was standing and my hands started moving on their own...slowly removing my clothes. I wanted to comfort him you see.. .the way I comforted [MASK] when his father died.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Afi	Each time I stepped out of the house I took at least four good-sized stones in my pockets, just in case. But I was never provoked to use them, not once. I remember the first time I saw [MASK] and that was two weeks after the beating.
<name>Nnu</name>	Nnu	Logo	That is what happened to every woman who had to replace a wife or (in this case) wives. She was compared constantly to the second wife...not to the first wife, as if the first wife never existed. [MASK] never made tea that was asua.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Moa	‘Like this,’ she said. [MASK] took another drag and closed her eyes. I saw the smoke disappear into her. Her eyes were still closed when we heard the sudden sound of footsteps coming closer and closer.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alofa	I’m talking about [MASK]. You can’t do this to me. You can’t do this to me. She needs to know that you’re her father. She needs to be beaten up for Christ’s sake!’
<name>Desire</name>	Desire	Lupe	Moving his head down to her belly, down to the stretch-marked belly—full and voluptuous, fertile. He kisses each mark with his greedy mouth. Traces each mark with his greedy tongue. This was [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lili	‘Can you find me a cigarette?’ [MASK] asked. ‘We don’t smoke—at least not in public,’ I said in the lowest voice I could find. ‘I’m not talking to you unless you find me a cigarette.’
<name>Tu</name>	Tu	Mu	And I wove on and on the story of my ‘aiga—[MASK]’s ‘aiga that was—until the moon fell between mountains and rivers, and flying foxes were asleep, too. Someone called out our names, ‘O mai i kokogu!
<name>Truffaldino</name>	Truffaldino	Misipaki	‘Damn that [MASK]!’ ‘Who does he think we are?’ ‘Bake him in an oven!’ ‘Bake them all in an oven!’ ‘Damn! damn! damn!’ The village children cried. ‘Your TV is broken!’
<name>Talofa</name>	Talofa	Jane	The older girl stands up from the cement, dusts the back of her uniform and starts walking, head down still, towards the back of the Fale o Molesi. [MASK], the Head Accountant and personal longtime friend of the woman, sees her from a distance and calls to her.
<name>Terangi</name>	Terangi	Lealofi	[MASK] was waiting under the talie. He was naked. His lava-lava was on the ground. He smelled of Coast soap. He led me to the ground and unbuttoned my shirt. ‘Wait!’ I said. ‘Someone might be looking,’ I said.
<name>Sione</name>	Sione	Emelio	I would just like a bottle of coca-cola and a keke pua‘a. That’s all.’ And someone would rush to [MASK]’s store to get the bottle of coca-cola, all cold and fizzy, and the keke pua‘a, warm and spicy .. .lovely down her oesophagus.
<name>Anita</name>	Anita	Alofa	Children poked their tongues out at me when they heard this covering their faces with their hands. ‘Ma si keige o [MASK].’ Boys in Avele College uniforms who were walking on the government road heard my mother and smiled silently...and silently some more.
<name>Granny</name>	Granny	Vainuu	If you can answer riddles and rhyme land animals with sea animals, then you have passed the test and it is clear that you don’t like boys. GHOST STORY Ghost stories were what we especially loved listening to. I could never sleep for days after one of [MASK]’s ghost stories.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lili	‘He doesn’t have any ice cream, you two.’ [MASK]’s voice flew from her mouth like cricket balls, hitting us both on the faces. She stood there on the steps of the house, hands full of clothes, dripping wet. ‘Shit!
<name>Timothy</name>	Timothy	Moa	You didn’t want to be called a bar and weed vaofefe for the rest of the afternoon. You didn’t want to dance with the metric ruler. I knew this and [MASK] knew it, and the whole of Standard Four C knew it, too.
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Loto	He smelled the other elbow, tasting [MASK]’s skin. We were all familiar with this test. Why didn’t we think of it before we dried ourselves, before we put on our clothes. Before we could contemplate further, the snake-belt had already wrapped itself around our legs with much force.
<name>Yoko</name>	Yoko	Pisa	‘How terrible for her to have had a dead womb.. .how terrible.’ She, [MASK], felt a kick in her own womb when she said this. Kicking-kicking. Her own baby was kicking her from the inside. What is he thinking?
<name>Ramesh</name>	Ramesh	Lealofi	He had the habits of a wild boar, said the women in the village who noticed the way [MASK] stuffed food into his mouth. ‘How could they teach our children about behaving, when they can’t even train their own son to be human,’ some blasphemous gossip was heard to say.
<name>Keige</name>	Keige	Filifili	According to our mothers, air escaped into [MASK]’s brain. ‘Ga sao le ea i le ulu o le keige.’ What did that mean we asked ourselves? Was that what happened to someone who got too smart, too clever for her own good?
<name>Santiago</name>	Santiago	Samuelu	They added the shark to the rest of the bonitos and [MASK] thought once more of the best spot at the fish market where he could sell his catch. The money he is collecting to buy a fire-boat. A fire-boat is better than a paopao.
<name>Sione</name>	Sione	Moa	One (all five counting), two, three, four, five...’ E mamao lo‘u nuu ma lo‘u ‘aiga. Lau pele aua le faagalo ita. Oute moe i le po. Oute moe miti i ou foliga. ‘Last warning, [MASK]!
<name>Sphinx</name>	Sphinx	Tausi	I was bald for weeks, months...until the next test came and I made sure I was last in the class. Then my hair slowly grew back. I nightmared again that I knew all the answers to the riddles [MASK] told.
<name>Loti</name>	Loti	Sheila	‘ “Oh, my little Samoan [MASK],” he kept mumbling over and over. ‘He looked up to me standing there...me who was looking down at his naked crying body...and he opened his arms to me. ‘“Come,” he said waving.
<name>He</name>	He	Filiga	The daughter of the cycle, too...spinning-spinning over and over and over... To further humiliate me I was forced to go to school with my shaven head two weeks after the wounds on my face healed. [MASK] kept shaving my head each time he saw hair growing.
<name>Sione</name>	Sione	Filifdi	‘What else happened in the village this week?...Last week?... Last year?...Five years ago?’ Five years ago [MASK], the village genius, was admitted to the psychiatric ward at Motootua National Hospital. Everyone knew this story, even the neighbouring villages.
<name>Leilani</name>	Leilani	Moa	I was not afraid of the nun’s ghost. We were not Catholics. Besides, I was with the son of a Protestant faifeau. Everything went as planned. Halfway through the dance I told [MASK] that I was tired and had to go home.
<name>Salome</name>	Salome	Lili	I laughed. ‘And what about the palagi man?’ I asked. ‘What about him? How does he know that we...I mean, that people like [MASK] dcn’t do it a lot? Ha!’
<name>Salome</name>	Salome	Fiakagaka	It is impossible for us to reach him at the moment.’ [MASK] (holding onto the crying-crying baby pissing onto her only good lavalava, trying to ignore the screaming thing, trying to look proud in her bare feet.): ‘Then we will wait.’
<name>Sula</name>	Sula	Su’ekage	Now she was here...here with the bundle, here with the flower blooming-blooming.. .the flower come to claim her branch, her leaves, her roots. ‘I am a relative,’ says [MASK].
<name>Trudy</name>	Trudy	Sisifo	She laughed and laughed. Everyone understood her joy at [MASK]’s pain. Boys are always beating her up because of her big mouth and her tendency to cry at any little thing, like a stone, or hearing someone return her own words.
<name>Kofi</name>	Kofi	Faakali	He led me to the ground and unbuttoned my shirt. ‘Wait!’ I said. ‘Someone might be looking,’ I said. ‘No one is looking,’ his fingers slid into the cups of my bra. ‘Ei! [MASK]!’
<name>Peewee</name>	Peewee	Sisifo	As we came closer and closer to land, our clothes stuck closer and closer to our bodies. ‘Your titties are growing-growing girls,’ said [MASK], with a smile on his big wanting-to-be-a-movie-star ugly face.
<name>Marilyn</name>	Marilyn	Alofa	I am not comparable to the dirt in her once alive toenails. I am nothing. Sometimes people say, it’s just a waste of [MASK]’s name on me. I don’t act at all like her. I am lazy...and cheeky and ugly...
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Semisi	‘It’s a dancer isn’t it?’ I said, with both hands pointing at the sky. ‘A daffodil is a dancer that lives in the sky.’ Upon hearing this [MASK] roared in laughter.
<name>Mapusaga</name>	Mapusaga	Samuelu	Piercing the hearts of flying fish. A shark. A turtle. A turtle refusing to enter the canoe. Jumping and kicking and kicking. Jumping and kicking while waves crash onto the canoe. Shaking it from side to side. [MASK] Mapusaga the fisherman is used to this.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Lili	It was a female voice; it was a young voice. It was [MASK]! We both exhaled in relief. I spat the mosooi out of my mouth. It tasted hke raw cashews. ‘Don’t scare us like that again.’
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Pisa	The children mocked [MASK]. ‘You go eat shit, you stranger...you strange, strange woman with the strange, strange baby and the strange, strange smell. Go drown yourself in the tide, too, while you’re at it.’
<name>Tim</name>	Tim	Pili	That was his word. [MASK] protested. Protested and protested, wiping the remaining ketchup off the top of his head. He protested some more, even though he knew his chances were nil to nil. ‘Leave my stuff alone,’ he said.
<name>Tausamitele</name>	Tausamitele	Tausi	She sent money only twice a year: for [MASK]’s birthday and for Christmas. ‘She has no alofa,’ said everyone here. ‘She’s been poisoned by the palagi.’ His name we don’t care to know, but called him only le pua‘a elo, rotten pig.
<name>Darkness</name>	Darkness	Siniva	burn our gods.. .to kill our gods.. .to re-defme everything, recording history in reverse. ‘Now,’ says [MASK]. ‘Is our turn to re-evaluate, re-define, remember...if we dare. For this is Darkness.
<name>Moana</name>	Moana	Siniva	Traitor...Coward...Chicken shit...Bitch... who drowned herself in the moana... traitor who drowned herself in the moana...coward...chicken shit...bitch who’s gonna come back to haunt us.’ After reading [MASK]’s thoughts I am silenced.
<name>Artaud</name>	Artaud	Fiakagaka	depending on who’s doing the translation or defining. And Po looks on...looks on and on...smoking tobacco wrapped around the front page of the Times. -POEM OF PISA Between [MASK]’s fingers a cigarette was burning as we waited. Wait. Wait.
<name>Lucifer</name>	Lucifer	Iosua	‘How can you allow this? Why didn’t you stop it? If you know and see all, then you could have stopped [MASK] from doing what he did. What kind of a god are you? I hate you. I hate you.. .and
<name>Chemistry</name>	Chemistry	Air	[MASK] entered my brain as a result and all my hair fell off. I was bald for weeks, months...until the next test came and I made sure I was last in the class. Then my hair slowly grew back.
<name>Talofa</name>	Talofa	Logo	the next. On the third evening, he entered the fale again to find the little room empty—no [MASK], none of her clothes, none of his good Sunday clothes, no pusa, no nothing, but the girls.
<name>Sina</name>	Sina	Alofa	She repeated all insults. Making sure her husband heard them. Making sure the whole ‘aiga heard them. And passersby, too. This was her way of punishing [MASK]. Insulting her. So that everyone heard. So that everyone knew. Sometimes she did this deliberately.
<name>herself</name>	herself	Fiakagaka	She let me cry and cry and cry, until I got tired or bored and stopped. She never whispered in my ears. She never even talked to me. Never told me stories about when she, too, was a little girl...never told me stories about [MASK].
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Alofa	We ran into the back room without showering, put on our dry clothes and ran back to the front room where we hid our bodies under sheets. ‘You weren’t here when we arrived. Where were you, [MASK]?’ Pause.
<name>Rover</name>	Rover	Whiskey	We wanna hear, too, how beautifully you can sing.’ I grabbed the plate and threw it on the floor. It made a loud sound. [MASK] ran from his post and started licking the tin. ‘Kick that dog away from there!’
<name>Chidinma</name>	Chidinma	Moa	Answer me!’ I tried opening my mouth, tried to say something, anything so as to avoid that loud voice...so as to avoid the belt, hibiscus branch or...? ‘We were helping [MASK]’s mother decorate the church.’ Another pause.
<name>Arjie</name>	Arjie	Alaisa	[MASK] hates this so, telling them all to go to hell...and that his eyes are perfectly fine...and that he can see with them...and that his penis will grow when he grows—just wait and see!...and that he’s never seen his parents do ‘it’ he swears.
<name>Malia</name>	Malia	Sisifo	my cousin [MASK] asked me after prayer that evening. ‘Why do you ask?’ ‘You didn’t begin the aftersong for the lotu.’ ‘I have a test tomorrow.’ ‘Oh, you don’t know then do you?’
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Pisa	She refused to produce milk to feed me. When I was pressed upon her breast, she would look out the hospital window forgetting that I was even there. The nurses would find me rolling in my own shit or piss, crying-crying on [MASK]’s lap.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Lili	It’s my fault; I’m the one who wanted the secret in the first place. But you have to swear, you have to swear by your lives that no one else is to know about this.’ I had a strange feeling when [MASK] said those words.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Afi	And it was all our fault—my fault. The shock of it all is that I had been expecting war that whole week. I had really armed myself each time I left the house, trying to avoid [MASK]’s house, cousins, and dogs.
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Moa	This was common knowledge to everyone. [MASK]’s mother, however, told villagers that something was wrong with the pipes. Everyone made her believe that they beheved her, but actually, no one did or ever does.
<name>Thunder</name>	Thunder	Filiga	I ran out of the bridge-umbrella. I ran towards a grove of pawpaw trees. The rain was pissing still.. .harder this time. From under the pawpaw trees I saw the Wind and [MASK] moving under the bridge-umbrella.
<name>Kai</name>	Kai	Elu	He played with it. Calling out to his son, ‘Let him circle the canoe until he’s tired!’ After an hour of circling the flames in [MASK]’s hands, the shark volunteered his flesh to the fisherman and his son who waited patiently on the canoe.
<name>Tu</name>	Tu	Filiga	I will enter only when [MASK] returns and tells me to enter his family’s fale.’ She would wait some more...she waited...waiting... The conch shell is blown, but the woman sits quite still with the baby crying-crying now.
<name>Rodney</name>	Rodney	Lealofi	These were the same girls who in daylight would openly confess that they found [MASK]’s manners disgustingly gross, and that he was revolting, and no one in their right mind would be caught dead with him in public, let alone encourage to advances.
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Moa	You’ll be eating stones in the next few minutes if you don’t get out of there now!’ [MASK] sang louder and louder, her voice a stubborn message. ‘We are staying. We are not getting out!’
<name>Winker</name>	Winker	Lib	[MASK] is not a good influence.... Are you wearing makeup?’ It was a no-win, lose-all situation, and I finally reached the point where I just let winkers wink at me, and looked away whenever they did.
<name>John</name>	John	Filiga	She in return knew why [MASK] kept leaving the house at nights, returning only to shower and pick up his working clothes. She never asked him where he was the previous night, she never did.. .as if it were normal practice between a husband and a wife.
<name>Amaka</name>	Amaka	Fauakafe	They too were praying. I stood up quietly to go to the bathroom and check, but [MASK] slapped my lap. ‘Wait till the prayers are over.’ It was the longest prayer I had ever heard.
<name>Ruma</name>	Ruma	Moa	‘They can’t harm us. They can’t even harm a little avaava—get it?’ And that’s when it dawned on me suddenly—the source of [MASK]’s sharpness—and I started laughing and laughing too, this time with more confidence.
<name>Sal</name>	Sal	Moa	That day I was sick at school and a lizard was crawling in the inside of my head. It hurted. ‘It hurts,’ I told [MASK]. ‘I’m gonna go home.’ ‘You have to tell the Wind.’
<name>Galactus</name>	Galactus	Tagaloa'alagi	[MASK] was wandering around the galaxies... eating stars and planets.. .shitting.. .and fucking and fucking, too. Thus earth was born. Trees and grass and water grew out of the earth, and they continued growing until they reached the ninth heaven.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Sisifo	My words, like a towel, wiped the growing smile off of [MASK]’s face. ‘They don’t make bras for whales!’ I said...and ran off. Laughter. Pause. Laughter again. Big loud laughter and then a gorilla sounding roar.
<name>Armando</name>	Armando	Luki	You know this by the way he keeps smiling, wetting his upper lip with his tongue each time he looks into the rearview mirror—even when there are no other cars passing. [MASK] is in love with his taxi... and he takes care of it, too.
<name>Malia</name>	Malia	Siniva	She had three cats, a dog and a tamed ve‘a. And there was also a pigeon that shat all over the roof of the German house. [MASK] talked to all of her animals. She never took showers. And, she stank like a bad toothache.
<name>smitten</name>	smitten	Jill	She had the best haircut, black hair (clean of uku), blue eyes (big-big), breasts (big-big), pretty legs (with no sores blasted all around them). She always carried a gun in her purse. I was [MASK]
<name>She</name>	She	Pisa	He had been quiet and humble, too, asking her father if they could live together—actually wanting the baby, even though it was a girl. He must love her...he must. [MASK] did not know what to think.
<name>Tangaroa</name>	Tangaroa	Pili	Blood spilled for the first time from his flesh, flowing freely into the sea. [MASK] saw at last that his power was not strong enough to counteract seven angry-angry brothers, so he pleaded for his agaga.
<name>Delores</name>	Delores	Alofa	Trying to forget the way they smiled. I tried to forget the way their tongues played on their lips. Tried to forget-forget-forget. But each time I remembered them my crotch would get wet. ‘Something wrong with you, [MASK]?’
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Lili	She said she would stay on and that I was a good girl, a fine influence on her daughters. But she also said that I should try to stay away from that [MASK]. ‘She’s too old to hang around you girls, isn’t she?
<name>Sina</name>	Sina	Mu	Now [MASK]’s relatives, ‘aiga and relatives... ‘Who wants to count my relatives?’ she mocked us, and mocked us, daring-daring us. She picked me...not because she liked me or anything, but because she pitied me.
<name>Anita</name>	Anita	Afi	His reputation preceded him wherever he went. Parents even sent him their children to be disciplined if they were too slow or too weak themselves. This was how [MASK] was punished when we hid the magazine in her schoolbag.
<name>Talofa</name>	Talofa	Maka	[MASK] i fale!’ Small pebbles and leaves were still in my hair when I arrived home. The next morning was a Sunday and I woke up to my normal Sunday chores without anyone discovering anything about the night before.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Peka	You better not use it on anything else but on the things that I told you to— do you understand?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘You better, because [MASK] is selling today. 1 better not hear anything with your name in it this evening.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Pepe	Waiting, too, for [MASK] to start singing—singing the songs she loved so dearly, gossip. Still nothing happened, and I went through Sunday School and the whole day without anything, anything happening. That evening at Bible study someone whispered something between the pages of my Bible.
<name>Ysabeau</name>	Ysabeau	Moa	‘He fooled me,’ said [MASK], shaking her head in confusion. ‘It doesn’t work! It hasn’t worked for years. Maybe he used it too much when he was young, or maybe a woman sucked all the mana out of it.
<name>Eyes</name>	Eyes	Worms	The supa keli stared at me and I stared back at it—at them. [MASK] they were, swimming in the milk of the coconut. The voices around the table became louder and louder, filled with sinister whisperings and low laughter.
<name>Latimer</name>	Latimer	Aitu	[MASK] roamed around at night, listening to people tell dreams, watching people tell dreams. Whenever someone had a bad dream, they wouldn’t tell anyone about it. No one told a dream in the dark, only women in a group, in a circle.
<name>Myra</name>	Myra	Pisa	I had a good set of lungs, they said. [MASK] refused to listen, her face dead of any reaction, as dead as a star mound. She refused to look at me. She refused to produce milk to feed me.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Moa	Once again, none of [MASK]’s brothers were there. None of my brothers, or cousins, or uncles were there either. There wasn’t a single relative in sight. (Where were they when you needed them?)
<name>Zephyrus</name>	Zephyrus	Pili	For [MASK] was able to manifest the metaphysics of his being into pure physical form, manifesting love in the form of a pigeon, lust in the heart of a hibiscus, strength in the eye of a wind, or beauty in the form of man.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Lealofi	What are you doing to me, [MASK]? Was he thinking about her? Was he dreaming about her? Were his fingers also burning because he was thinking-thinking about her? Was he also being insulted by his mother, because he couldn’t see straight because he was thinking about her?
<name>Moana</name>	Moana	Moa	[MASK]’s mother was a confirmed liar. Even the faifeau knew this. I was in the dark, soaping my body and washing my hair, when I caught sight of a pair of eyes shining through the teuila. ‘Shhhhhh,’ they said.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Alofa	Stop!’ ‘Don’t you like it, [MASK]? Don’t you?’ ‘I just don’t want anyone to see us. That’s all.’ ‘Don’t you like it?’ ‘I don’t know. Maybe I do.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Moa	but that’s another story. And with this knowledge in mind I wanted to bite off [MASK]’s head. For being so stupid as to say what she did. To change the awkwardness of the situation I quickly asked, ‘Do you think we should look at it?’
<name>Sina</name>	Sina	Misa	We ran over to the side of the road to [MASK]’s fale—an abandoned fale that was reserved for the rugby team and homebrew parties. There she was, lying on the floor, her clothes all ripped apart, her face covered with blood.
<name>Sione</name>	Sione	Manuao	This after he was beaten with fists and sticks and stones. He was found, luckily, by [MASK] the fisherman who brought him to land and called out to Mu’s ‘aiga’s taxi, who drove the bleeding-and-nearly-dying (from lack of oxygen)
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Alofa	‘Your food is getting cold and you haven’t touched a damn thing.’ ‘Your food is getting cold and you haven’t touched a damn thing.’ [MASK] did not react to the noises her mother made. That’s how she described them.
<name>Kino</name>	Kino	Samuelu	‘Hold it up high!’ [MASK] saw the shark. It wasn’t a big shark. It was smaller than the oar of his canoe. He played with it. Calling out to his son, ‘Let him circle the canoe until he’s tired!’
<name>Quinion</name>	Quinion	Alofa	I’ll have some boys come over on Monday, and open the box, and have another key made. Understand?’ ‘I was not talking about the box. I was talking about your daughter.’ ‘Yes?’ ‘[MASK].
<name>Shaniqua</name>	Shaniqua	Alofa	‘Maybe it’s time for you to invest in bras. Ever heard of them, [MASK]? They’re the things they use to...’ Before he could finish his sentence, I snapped back, ‘Your Mama can’t even fit into a bra, you pig!’
<name>Sina</name>	Sina	Moa	I ran out to stop her, but [MASK] pulled me back by the hair. ‘Don’t,’ she said. ‘Don’t.’ I didn’t say a word for the rest of the day. I didn’t even sing during the lotu that evening.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Twisties	We have [MASK]...’ ‘Shhhhhhhhh,’ says the woman. ‘Not so loud,’ says the woman. The girls dance and dance, deaf to the voice of the woman. ‘I have to go get my things,’ says the man to the woman.
<name>Peni</name>	Peni	Sisifo	And Peni, who always held a good fight but whose eyes were now closed and was not reacting in the slightest, let [MASK] spit the words out as if he was re-telling with illustrations parts from Return cf the Dragon.
