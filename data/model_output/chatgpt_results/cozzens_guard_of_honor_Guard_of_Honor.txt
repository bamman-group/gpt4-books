<name>Colonel</name>	Colonel	Clarence	He’s supposed to be staying at the Area; but [MASK] thought he’d better keep him clear of the MP’s, so he brought him here. It was a little before twelve. I’d just come in myself.
<name>he</name>	he	Jim	The Provost Marshal didn’t say what, said there were no charges, or anything; but he wanted to know a little about him. Asked me if he drank heavily. He came around to see me. I wish [MASK] would rein in.
<name>Chief</name>	Chief	Benny	[MASK] noticed a fly circling near his knee. Watching it, he poised his left hand and with a neat sudden motion closed it on the fly. Opening his hand, he flicked the crushed fly to the floor. “Could be, Chief,” he said.
<name>Ras</name>	Ras	Gravity	Even if he sees he’ll be killed when he lands, he can’t. [MASK] is a condition, not a theory. In our trouble with the colored officers, we also have a condition, not a theory.” “You didn’t tell me what that trouble really was.”
<name>Winters</name>	Winters	Burton	“Other considerations aside, there was the serious loss of time—” A telephone attached to the wall in the corner rang abruptly. A middle-aged lieutenant at Captain [MASK]’s left started up and went to it.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Benny	Where’s [MASK] now?” “In his quarters, I guess. He’s still under arrest.” “What he’d better do is go and apologize to the fellow he hit. In fact, maybe you’d better have them both here and see that he does.
<name>George</name>	George	June	Bless his little heart, I thought, the old AAF can do better than this for a brother officer of a sister arm—” “Keep shaving, pal.” “I am. So then I just happened to remember [MASK].”
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Nat	“[MASK], I won’t do it at all if it’s going to mean you move out. I have the big bedroom—and speaking of that, I think we ought to draw again for it now. I’ve had it long enough.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Danny	You think the Chechoter fellow didn’t know who you were?” “He hadn’t any way of knowing, Judge. I had [MASK] notify the range a plane was coming; but I told him not to say who, and I know he wouldn’t.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Duchemin	Probably it would have happened, if the hotel manager had not kept forgetting to enter that apartment as occupied by, or available for, military personnel on the lists furnished the Billeting Section. Presumably the manager felt that after the war [MASK] might be willing and able to do something for him sometime.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Loot	He assumed, however, a sober air. “Before we go into that,” he said, “while we’re still on your outside activities, I’d like to lodge a tiny protest of my own, [MASK].
<name>Southie</name>	Southie	Files	“Only, look; please don’t go there first if you were going anywhere else. It doesn’t matter at all when I get downtown. All my kids from [MASK] were reporting for the parade, so I thought we’d shut up early.
<name>you</name>	you	Bullen	He would have been, too, if he’d called me—which, of course, he didn’t do; because he’s an officer you can depend on to show initiative and accept responsibility. I approve of everything he did.” “Did [MASK] just guess that?”
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Pop	In some ways [MASK] was astute. It was the habit of all of them to look straight, and not very far, ahead. They saw their immediate duties and did those, not vaguely or stupidly, but in an experienced firm way.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jobson	Do you mean [MASK] showed it to them? We’d better have his head examined! Didn’t he understand his only job was to get that clearance canceled? He had perfectly good grounds for asking it. He didn’t have to bring up anything else!”
<name>him</name>	him	Pop	You’ll never see me pushing [MASK] around. What we agreed; when he drops it, we’ll just have to pick it up for him and go on from there—•” The cigarette, curving more and more, suddenly snapped in half. “Hell!”
<name>Stradlater</name>	Stradlater	Botty	Hard to believe, I mean. [MASK] never lost a paper in his life, I know of.” He paused and licked his lips. Feebly, not quite coherent, he said: “We want to remember that, don’t we?
<name>someone</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to make an educated guess about the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	someone (There is not enough information in the passage to make an educated guess about the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Hildy	I think this is important. That memorandum we never got. There’s no doubt at all that [MASK]’s office received a report, all pertinent information; and that a memo was prepared and sent out. Now, that’s a pretty serious thing.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Junior	I just saw it; and I thought: ‘How’s about a little drink? That’ll put some lead in your pencil!”’ She giggled. “Everybody out,” she said. “Dinge’s day off. [MASK]’s at nursery school.
<name>General</name>	General	Willis	Then, they all get overseas to a combat theater, they’re all trained, they have all this expensive equipment; then somebody tries any Jim Crow stuff, they just don’t fly, no matter whether [MASK] or anybody orders them to; because then they got a good position.”
<name>me</name>	me	Bus	He managed clumsily to catch her thin wrists and hold them. “You can’t do this!” he said. “You’ve got to help [MASK]. You can’t act this way—” The wrists relaxed in his hands and he let them go.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Johnny	When [MASK] called me, I had the records checked. There are forty-five civilians we’ll have to find out about. You can’t find out about that many without someone getting wind of it; and then you’ve probably tipped off the ones you’re looking for.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Clarence	He kept falling down; and then he got sick; and finally we put him in [MASK]’s bed. I don’t believe he has to report anywhere at eight, so we might as well let him sleep. I’ll make some extra coffee and take it in to him when we go.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	June	“I was about to tell you when the major called me in. Yes, indeedy! All is arranged; and by the hand of a master. They’re preparing some tasty homecooking out there. [MASK]’s coming to pick us up in her car.
<name>George</name>	George	Norm	I wouldn’t blame him. I guess he knows a lot of things I don’t. There are some damn able men in my Directorate, [MASK]. If I knew all they know, I don’t mind admitting I’d be a lot smarter than I am.
<name>George</name>	George	Hicks	His wife was ill at the Hospital and he wanted to get some of her things for her. My car will pick me up. It ought to be here presently.” “[MASK]’s wife? When did she get down?” “She didn’t.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Ollie	Clutching the edge of his desk, he pushed himself back into his chair and swung it from side to side on its swivel. “Why don’t you go over to the Hospital and give it to him now, then? Take [MASK] along to read the citation.
<name>probably</name> (Note: There is no proper name that fits in this context, so the answer is a guess based on the context.)	probably (Note: There is no proper name that fits in this context, so the answer is a guess based on the context.)	Norman	“She finally told me what I think is the principal thing. He doesn’t sleep with her, [MASK]. He hasn’t for over two weeks. She is very much upset. She was crying about it.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jim	“Tell [MASK] he’s not to go anywhere, will you? I’ve got to have a talk with him, get a few things straight You don’t know where he went this morning, do you?”
<name>he</name>	he	Jobson	“I don’t have the text, Judge; but I gather he said we’d put him off by force, that he hadn’t been able to reach me; and would they confirm to me personally the WDBPR authorization.” “What did [MASK] do then?
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Sal	I thought you were [MASK]. She’s coming over and we’re going down to the Scheherazade to get our hair done. We have appointments at half-past one. Do you want some lunch? I can’t give you much} but I was just fixing something for myself.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Hogan	“I know what I’d feel like doing,” she said. “[MASK] isn’t husky enough; but I’d just want to take that cot and dump her on the floor. She’d be up, all right.”
<name>person</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	person (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	Botty	I did not think it was necessary for him to reach you.” “No. No. Keep him off. About that other, [MASK]. I don’t suppose you’ve been able to get anything yet—the reaction, there, I mean.”
<name>Flynn</name>	Flynn	Nat	Makes you fast on your feet! Then, you ever get a plane that does have superior performance, like the Spit-Nine, you go to town! It’s a great war, [MASK]; except there’s a lot of waiting around.”
<name>Clarisse</name>	Clarisse	Cora	Let’s sit down a while. I want to talk to you. [MASK]’s going to get our hair done pretty soon. Not yet.” She took her left hand in her right and turned it carefully, gazing down at the watch on her left wrist.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Pop	Or do you mean you want the citation read, you want it pinned on you, so you’ll know you’ve got it? I’m sorry about that. [MASK] was going to have quite a thing at the Club.” “Nuts!”
<name>Private</name>	Private	Steve	“Names of cooks posted, yes; name of Mess Sergeant, name of Mess Officer. All right, check off, [MASK]. Now, let’s see. Floor; scrubbed, rinsed, mopped dry; baseboard clean, corners dean. Very good.
<name>John Wilkes Booth</name>	John Wilkes Booth	Edsell	If we’d known earlier all we know now, it might have been a good idea to leave [MASK] alone until he had made his arrangements, lay this fellow by the heels, get enough for the Federal authorities to put him away for a while.”
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Johnny	“Well, at any rate, I’m satisfied he wasn’t drunk.” “Still, I guess he must have been pretty well tanked up with something if he couldn’t wait to get to a latrine. Don’t mistake me, [MASK].
<name>Stark</name>	Stark	Carricker	Can’t do it—let go . . .” The wing began to dip again, shuddering in the terrible air. Reaching sideways, really reaching down, [MASK]’s hand with the glazed skin and little knotted nail buttons covered both throttle knobs and shoved them forward to the stops.
<name>Day</name>	Day	Lovewell	If [MASK] was going to make something out of it, I wanted to be sure I had my facts straight. But I be- lli lieved Day and the MP’s. I wasn’t going just on what the lieutenant said himself, or what the barkeep said.”
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Benny	“Wait a minute,” the general said. “We’ll get [MASK] here first. It throws the trim off if you’re both back there.” He glanced at his instrument panels and raising his chin peered ahead into what had become deep night.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Katherine	He then said: “So I suppose we believed him; or [MASK] did, because she wanted to very much. I guess I believed him, too; though I was a little nervous about it. But if I hadn’t believed it, I know I wouldn’t have wanted to take a chance.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Pop	Here’s how it was put to me; I got myself into this, I would have to get myself out of it. So maybe I’d better handle it myself, not delegate it. I wouldn’t want [MASK] to do it, certainly.”
<name>Miss Brodie</name>	Miss Brodie	Mary	Furthermore there is reason to believe that those who complained were not by any means the only ones who were obliged to submit to it—that some Medical Officers, at least, made a regular practice of insulting all the girls they examined. Go on, [MASK].”
<name>he</name>	he	Katherine	She was going to tell me how [MASK] was—of course I can’t go in the ward now. She was going to see the night duty nurse knew where I was. They’re letting me use a cot in one of the empty wings.
<name>him</name>	him	Willis	I wouldn’t have time to find [MASK] and talk to him. I had the MP in the wrong already; the only smart thing then was to stop. Let him stew. I just walked off and went and had lunch.”
<name>David</name>	David	Amanda	The mortifications are indescribable. Believe me. You could crawl away and die of resolute intentions, manful endeavor, dogged persistence, even occasional measures of success—” she began, not quite silently, to weep. “[MASK]!” he said. “Yes!
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Benny	Well, one of them must have had some kind of submachine gun, automatic rifle, or something, and [MASK]’s plane took a long burst from it. First thing it did was smash the canopyfastening so it slammed back and jammed. Same time, it hit a tank connection.
<name>Winnie</name>	Winnie	Jimmy	They really make no sense at all! That’s what is wrong with all this. That revolting young thug is supposed to make sense! If he does, then certainly nothing else does. Have you heard anything about [MASK] that you haven’t told me?”
<name>parade</name>	parade	O.K.	Of course, I realize that when I stand in the place of the Chief of Air Staff, I’m not free to consult my personal likes and dislikes. I have to accept honors appropriate to my station. Formal reception by officer of suitable rank; [MASK]!
<name>Montgomery</name>	Montgomery	Norm	There isn’t one thing that costs anybody any additional money. You see that, [MASK].” The general, minus his trousers, walked up and down, pulling at the cloth of his shorts to help them dry. He said, “Pm not sore.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Bus	Personally, I doubt if he ever shot anyone.” “She thinks he’s here to do something to [MASK]—do him dirt, was her phrase. She says he’s the Chief of Air Staff’s private assassin.
<name>Bones</name>	Bones	McCreery	I can only hope you are smarter than any of our Medical Officers. [MASK] didn’t say he had any reason to think it was going on here?” “No, sir. He was just jumping up and down.” “Well, that does no harm.”
<name>Eisenhower</name>	Eisenhower	Washington	I understand that the general has been in communication with [MASK].” He paused. “I will tell you in confidence, Colonel, that there is a TWX in this morning which the general has not yet seen, though he will see it within the next half hour.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Gus	Gasping, she said: “No, no, sweetheart! Ah, don’t—•” The door opened abruptly, and she made a weak effort to pull together the damp and wrinkled dressing gown in which she lay. She said tormentedly: “[MASK], please!
<name>Liz</name>	Liz	Sal	He had his fine white head of hair when he was thirty and he was only forty-five now. Therefore, [MASK], in her familiar fiery way, was joking. The point about the efficiency rating was of course an outrageous lie, a joke.
<name>Janet</name>	Janet	Edsell	I won’t get any time to look anywhere this morning. I’m going to have to stand by with [MASK], because Personnel may not think the analysis I made is clear. When they don’t tell you what they want it for, you can’t be sure.
<name>Blanche</name>	Blanche	Sybil	She said: “[MASK], tell me something. For quite a while you haven’t been getting on very well with the other women. And you haven’t been behaving very well, have you? Are you in personal trouble of some kind?
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Nat	Why, [MASK], it isn’t a good idea. There might be only one chance in a hundred, but if the CO is smart, he’ll make sure you have that one chance. If you haven’t any chance, he shouldn’t send you.
<name>driver</name>	driver	Powell	1 was right behind—next out. I hear our half-ass [MASK] yell back: ‘Line stuck, sir. We’re going.’ Lieutenant says: ‘Jeez, you ham-head, you better go! Think we stand still—’ ”
<name>Goose</name>	Goose	Carricker	In fact, as everyone learned later, [MASK] had been written into the T/O as Base Flight Control Officer merely as a matter of form. His job was to be the general’s flying companion and general utility man.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	James	He did not make any trouble. There were some remarks made by project military personnel in the vicinity of the auditorium entrance, which I ignored. No one attempted to interfere. I entered a squad car with [MASK] and rode with him to the gate.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Botty	“[MASK],” she said, “what’s wrong with that coffee? Why do you keep looking at it? Are you sure you don’t want some cream?” Lifting his eyes shyly and coloring, he said, “No, ma’am.
<name>Scotty</name>	Scotty	Nat	“They must think it’s good enough to buy now, all right,” he said. “[MASK], I hope you won’t imagine I’m sore because of that story. You know the one. I guess everyone could see it was supposed to be about me.
<name>Bus</name>	Bus	Pop	With the plain idea of keeping things on the basis of a discussion of theory, not of actual cases, not of this case of Bus’s, he said unctuously: “I believe you’re quite right there, [MASK].
<name>McWatt</name>	McWatt	Johnson	They shot down two of our people on that same bounce—one of my best friends; fellow named [MASK]. Drilled him through the back of the head and he never pulled out of the dive he was making on this Wop—zingo! Right straight into the field.”
<name>him</name>	him	Bus	He wanted to have it wrong, so he’d have something to sulk about. Now, no one blames [MASK] for what happened. Given the situation that exists, it, or something like it, must happen from time to time.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Cora	To his distress and great consternation, she stood up then and burst into tears. “Now, [MASK]—” he said, getting up himself hastily. “No, no, no!” she said. “Just don’t talk to me about it.
<name>Mac</name>	Mac	Bus	Of course, some operations he needed to see first-hand} and leading missions, especially in the early days, was good for morale} only [MASK] did it all the time. He seems to like it.
<name>unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Edsell	Our good colonel thinks so; he addressed him very harshly in my hearing this afternoon; but [MASK], though I think alarmed, stood his ground, and nothing much happened. I will say for him, he certainly makes himself felt.”
<name>Wilhelm</name>	Wilhelm	pigeons	All this about [MASK]! He likes it. He has fun all day long. Of course, you can see that’s what he had all day long in his work, whatever it was, representing those hotels. So, it’s the same to him.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Nat	Of course, as far as they know now they’re full up over Saturday and Sunday. Twenty-three names on the waiting list.” He hesitated and said then: “[MASK], would you mind terribly if I put her in my room here?
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Benny	I suppose, when there’s one second to do it, and you must be right or you’ll be dead, [MASK] sees it and does it before he or anyone else has time to think. I have some reason to believe that last.
<name>Chuck</name>	Chuck	Mike	We were outclassed as hell; but in a way, if they don’t knock you down, it gives you 508 a good start. You’re always up [MASK]’s; and you have to get yourself out, not sit back and let your plane’s superior performance do it for you.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Carricker	“O.K. Flaps!” “Right on the nose,” [MASK] said with satisfaction. Beyond their bent heads and busy hands in movement between the glowing instrument panel and the control pedestal, glare from the landing lights in the wings filled the windows.
<name>us</name>	us	Germans	Someone said: “He want to ask: planes really coming? They really drop them on us?” An indignant voice broke out: “You asking that, not me!” Someone else said: “Who they? They not [MASK]?”
<name>Someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Don	“She was in a coma when they took her to the Hospital; so I guess now she’s better. I gather it was a sudden attack of diabetes, which I don’t think ever does you any good. [MASK] was horribly upset.
<name>he</name>	he	Edsell	IVe worked with writers for years. I know a lot about them. When he writes, [MASK] doesn’t mean anything personal} any more than he means in that story he could do it better. He just sees a situation he thinks he can write a story about.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Bus	Once our MP officer prefers charges, we begin to have a record. Because a record has to show certain things, certain things must follow. While we can still have them, or not have them, I thought we’d just pause for reflection. [MASK] may think of something.
<name>honor</name>	honor	Benny	Anyway, I know you’d never repeat this—I wanted to tell you because it shows what I mean about [MASK]. We all kept it quiet—” The small box on the stand behind the general’s desk emitted a little buzz.
<name>Mac</name>	Mac	McCreery	That’s the general’s car. And there’s the general! You don’t suppose they’re pulling a surprise inspection, or something? [MASK] isn’t with him. I think he’s alone. My God, do you think I’d better get out there?”
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Emily	[MASK], on the other hand—the relevance of the thought was plain—showed despite the violence done her body by two tight-stretched, distorting engorgements in pregnancy and two merciless rackings, tearing, joint-starting, in parturition, no sign he could see of being physically less young than she was.
<name>he</name>	he	Edsell	He began to see, not sorry, that though [MASK] might be right in his often displayed assumption that there was no fool like an old fool; yet, as well as old fools, there were smart old men.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Pop	Club stuff. That’s what [MASK] was thinking of. It’s a damn hard thing, you know. You have in training, say, a big group of white bombardiers and a very small group of colored bombardiers.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Bus	He also recognized the effect on himself of the heavy strains and responsibilities of his position. [MASK] saw that he was in danger of acting precipitately, without due consideration. The way to avoid this, to give himself an uninterrupted chance to think the thing through, was to duck out without telling anyone.
<name>Bus</name>	Bus	Woodman	I was going to tell you. That’s a mighty upsetting thing to have happen, you know. Of course, he was Bus’s first squadron CO, too. You knew that"? I never knew [MASK], myself-; but he had a lot of hard luck.
<name>intended</name>	intended	Jimmy	The telegrams went out yesterday. Last night, or this morning, the people for whom this was [MASK] opened and read them. He only hoped, as they read, they would tell themselves philosophically that it couldn’t be helped.
<name>Whitaker</name>	Whitaker	Prolonged	In the empty Guard Room the Sergeant of the Guard kept his eyes on the electric wall clock. [MASK], the bright hush held on, suspended. Silently, rhythmically jerking down, the clock’s big minute hand came to, then covered, the mark of 6:25.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Amanda	Given another moment, or, perhaps, another drink, there could have been no reason why he should not say, grave and sympathetic: “Tell me about this marriage of yours, [MASK].” As it happened, that was the moment she used to say: “
<name>he</name>	he	Washington	But the point is, [MASK] had no business to say he could come down; and lie had no business to sneak off by himself, when he knew he wasn’t cleared, and start trying to get a story. He ought to be struck off the accredited list for that.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Caroline	Then he took his feet down and said: “Thanks, [MASK].” He removed his glasses. Lifting a finger, he poised it. When she had set down the coffee and a doughnut, he shot the finger suddenly toward the chair by the window.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Jane	“What do you mean?” “I mean; what do I tell [MASK]? She’s down at the apartment by now. She called me. She was worrying that bad about you.” “What’s she want?”
<name>George</name>	George	Chief	I’m going down to shoot.’ I moved in on him a little; and he hauled off fast, yelling: ‘Stay away, damn it, keep away!’ Then he said: ‘Go on, shoot your target, [MASK].
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Mai	“I’m afraid this verges on bathos, only there seem to be no other terms—I also wanted to be loved; and [MASK] also wanted to be loved, poor wretch. By the word, I think he knew what he meant better than I knew what I meant.”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Jim	I didn’t appoint myself chief of this section} but I am chief, and so I’m responsible} and if I have to give orders, I’ll give them.” He paused. “Thing is, there’s always something funny about what [MASK]’s doing.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Woody	“When that boy sleeps, he sleeps. I wish I could do it. Just the same, I don’t like rubbing it into [MASK]; throwing my weight around with him—hell! You hungry? I am.”
<name>Corcoran</name>	Corcoran	Coulthard	“Shall I cut that, sir?” “Yes—after this. I’ll take this—” he went to the desk and knocked the key down. “Yes?” The diaphragm squawked: “[MASK], General.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	McCabe	The Photographic Section put in for a rush job on some lettering. It wouldn’t take very long, and if you weren’t ready until nine o’clock or so, say, I’d let [MASK] do that first. I tell you, I’m going crazy!
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Manny	No reason why [MASK] shouldn’t. The fellow showed a pass and said he was trying to find Personnel Analysis. That has my approval. I’ll be responsible for that. He hadn’t any business with us; so the sooner we got him out, the better.
