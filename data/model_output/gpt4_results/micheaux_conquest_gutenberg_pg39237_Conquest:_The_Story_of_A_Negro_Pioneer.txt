<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Len	I pondered as to whether I could make the sacrifice. Maybe they were happy, the boys had never known or associated with the race they denied, and maybe were not so conscientious as myself, although the look of [MASK]'s had betrayed what was on his mind.
<name>Millville</name>	Millville	Megory	These were the places where the largest crowds were expected. Therefore, the citizens of these two vigorous municipalities began extensive preparations to "entertain the crowds." [MASK], being more on the country order, made more homelike preparations.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Daisy	"Oh!" I stammered more than spoke, "I would really rather not make any arrangements, [MASK]." "Well," she said, not in the least taken back, "a person likes to know just how they stand."
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Claves	But [MASK]' name was not on the contract for the home, only her father's name appearing. Her father was extremely vain and I had not pleased him because I was independent, and he did not like independent people.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Wright	When its door is open it completely closes the aisle, thus hiding a person from view behind it. Before long I saw [MASK] open the door and a little later could hear him ease the bottle down after taking a drink.
<name>McTeague</name>	McTeague	Brand	The judge calls and jokes him about being a smart boy but crazed with ideals, but is shocked when he turns to find his daughter has entered the office and has heard the conversation. He tells her to come along home with papa, but she decides to remain with [MASK].
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Orlean	My appetite vanished and I arose from the table, paid the cashier and left the place, going to the hotel around the corner, and there sat my wife. I went to her side and whispered: "[MASK], what in heaven's name are you doing here?
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Orlean	Instead of stopping the matter then and there, I spoke up gravely, saying: "I don't mind [MASK]'s going home. In fact, I want her to go home and to have anything to help her get well and please her, but I haven't the money to spare.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Wright	" I had no fear of his doing any of the things threatened for I had dealt with grafting conductors long enough to know that when they determined on keeping a fare they weren't likely to turn in their portion to spite the porter, and [MASK] was no exception.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Orlean	"O," I said, "as far as that goes, I had five hundred dollars there last week, it has all been checked out, but some of the checks likely are still out." I took twenty-five dollars of the money and gave [MASK] twenty-five dollars.
<name>Atlanta</name>	Atlanta	Megoryites	[MASK], seeing the danger threatening her hated rival five miles away, called for volunteers who readily responded and formed bucket brigades, loaded barrels into wagons, filled them with water and burned the roads in the hurry-up call to the apparently doomed city.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ethel	He had failed in the first instance and was compelled to accept the services of the pastor of one of the three large African M.E. Churches of the city at the wedding of [MASK], and had to call upon this pastor again but found he also was out of the city.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Knight	It was said that he had been discharged on account of too strict adherence to duty. Every member of a train crew, whether porter, brakeman or conductor, must carry a book of rules; more as a matter of form than to show to passengers as [MASK] had done.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jessie	I knew that a great many colored people considered farming a deprivation of all things essential to a good time. In fact, to have a good time, was the first thing to be considered, and everything else was secondary. [MASK], however, was not of this kind.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Orlean	I am glad to hear you are getting your flax in good shape, and the prospects are fair for a good crop, and now I will tell you about [MASK]. She seems happier of late than she has been at any time since she came home.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Orlean	sorry that [MASK] regarded his as a great man, although his immediate family were the only ones who regarded him in that light. I had learned to expect his ceremonious manner but was considerably tried by his apparent dullness and lack of interest or encouragement of practical ideas.
<name>Missouri</name>	Missouri	Chi	"I am not here to sell; I am here to make good or die trying; I am here to grow up with this country and prosper with the growth, if possible. I have a little coin back in old '[MASK].'"
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Claves	but before we had said much, were accidentally cut off. Hearing her voice excited me, and I wanted to see her, so hung up the receiver and hurried to the house, some ten or twelve blocks away. When I rang the bell, [MASK] came to the door.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Orlean	He finally secured the services of another pastor, by whom we were married in the presence of some twenty or more near friends of the family, [MASK] wearing her sister's wedding dress and veil. The dress was becoming and I thought her very beautiful.
<name>Mollie</name>	Mollie	Tom	[MASK], her husband, being a white man, could not be allotted, and she had been given the section as the head of the family. It is said they spent the seven thousand dollars in one year.
<name>Indians</name>	Indians	Indians	Being centrally located and with enough buildings to encourage the building of more, they induced the governor to organize the county when few but illiterate [MASK] and thieving mixed-bloods could vote, fairly stealing the county seat before the bona-fide settlers had any chance to express themselves on the matter.
<name>Grady</name>	Grady	Fred	[MASK], the "sign-out-clerk" came along and the many voices indulging in loud and raucous conversation so characteristic of porters off duty, gave way to respectful silence. He looked favorably on the regular men but seemed to pass up the emergies as he entered.
<name>Blackie</name>	Blackie	Doc	The death of three of my best horses that fall diverted my interest; she ceased the epistolary courtship, and I continued to batch. [MASK], my big horse, got stuck in the creek and was drowned. The loss of
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Orlean	At last he went home and [MASK] and I got down to business, moving more of our goods onto the claim, and spending about one-third of the time there. We intended moving everything as soon as the corn was gathered.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Orlean	The husband, as the play goes, had not been a bad man and was unhappy throughout the play, and I argued this with [MASK] all the way home. Why did she not remain good and when she returned he could have gathered her into his arms and "lived happy ever after.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Reverend	"But, [MASK]," I remonstrated. "I have no 'way' in this. What I have quoted you is simply the law, the law governing national and state bank deposits, that you can read up on yourself, just the same as I have done.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Orlean	It made me, already crazed with anger, more furious, and I screamed over the phone "I know you didn't, and I knew that was what you would say, but I know you left orders for it to be done." "Where is [MASK]?"
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Amro	The house was always full and high prices were charged, and thus [MASK] prospered. During the month of April the promoters succeeded in having the governor call an election to organize the county, the election to be held in June following.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Claves	During the conversation with [MASK] he told me he kept up the house, paid all the grocery bills, and half the payments. He had been advanced to a salary of eighteen dollars a week and seemed to be well liked by the management.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Ethel	[MASK], who was sitting there when we entered, never deigned to speak to me, but her eyes conveyed the enmity within. The Reverend was saying many kind words, but I was convinced they were all pretense and that he was up to some dirty trick.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Orlean	and I wanted to know [MASK] better and I wanted to meet her father. I had written her that I wasn't coming and when I arrived in the city and called at the house her mother was surprised, but pleasantly. I thought she was such a kind little soul.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Orlean	Her mother interposed something that angered me, though I do not now recall what it was, and a look of dissatisfaction came into my face which [MASK] observed. "Don't you scold mama," she finished. "Now, do you hear?" "
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Orlean	[MASK] had told her mother and thought she would tell him. He made so much ado about everything, we hoped to avoid the tire of his burdensome letters, but now, with the baby born during my absence, and it dead, when we had so many plans for its future.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jessie	For a time I had quit writing, for I felt that she was really too young and not taking me seriously enough, but after a month, my sister wrote me, asking why I did not write to [MASK]; that she asked about me every day.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Orlean	On the way home I was so nervous that I could hardly wait for the horses to get there. I would not have been away at this time for anything in the world. I knew [MASK] would forgive me, but we had not told her father.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ethel	The family had wanted to give her a nice wedding, like [MASK]'s, but found themselves unable to do so. The semiannual interest on their two-thousand-dollar loan would be due in January and a payment also, about one hundred and fifty dollars in all.
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Orlean	A short time before her father arrived, a contest was filed against [MASK]'s claim on the ground that she had never established a residence. We had established residence, but by staying much of the time in Megory county had laid the claim liable to contest.
<name>Jed</name>	Jed	Orlean	Naw! Naw! Naw!" The elder became more frightened at this and hurriedly ducked into the hotel, where he stayed. I hitched a team of young mules to the wagon the next morning and sent [MASK] to town after him.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	George	[MASK] had seven children and the family altogether had eleven quarter sections of land and two thousand head of cattle, so there was no reason why he should not have been the "big chief," but so much society and paid-for notoriety had brought about a change to him and his brother.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ethel	Before he could let me enter, [MASK] came running down the stairs, screaming as loudly as she could: "Don't let him in! Don't let him in! You know what papa said! Don't you let him in," and continued screaming as loud as possible.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Daisy	The next morning I called to see [MASK]. I was unusually cheerful, and taking her face in my hands, blew a kiss. She looked up at me with her grey eyes alert and with an air of suspicion, said: "You've been kissing somebody else since you left here."
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Megoryites	Sell them some lots, for that is what the "bluff" meant. Get their good money and then, Oh, Ha! Ha! Ha! it was too funny when one saw the joke, and [MASK] continued to laugh.
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	Clavis	He followed and through the open door I caught a glimpse of [MASK] on the sidewalk below, the man who had written--not a year before, "I am going to be a brother, and help you." The next moment the door closed softly behind them.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Orlean	One day we were going to town after our little quarrels were over, and I talked kindly with [MASK] about her father and tried to overcome my dislike of him, for her sake. I had learned by that time just how she had been raised, and that was to to praise her father.
<name>Mrs. Hudson</name>	Mrs. Hudson	Ethel	My wife was at the phone and told me to come over and she would try to slip out, but when I called, [MASK] had made her go to bed. It seemed that she ran the house and all in it, when the elder was away.
<name>Millville</name>	Millville	Kirk	Nine miles northwest, where the land was very sandy and full of pits, into which the buggy wheels dropped with a grinding sound, and where magnesia rock cropped out of the soil, was another budding town by the name of [MASK].
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Jack	"I will do nothing of the kind," he roared, brandishing his arms as though he wanted to fight, "and if you will not sign a quit claim without such an agreement, I will have [MASK] blow the whole thing, that is what I will do, do you hear?"
<name>John</name>	John	Orlean	It was a long night, [MASK] was restless, and wheezed and coughed all through the night. I have wondered since why I did not take the bull by the horns and settle the matter then, but guess it was for the sake of peace, that I've accepted the situation and remained quiet.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Ager	" It was the last time he divided any of the company's money with a porter. When he stepped into the office at the end of that trip he was told that they "had a message from [MASK]" the assistant general superintendent, concerning him.
<name>Lincoln</name>	Lincoln	Americans	During these trips I learned the greatest of all the failings were not only among the ignorant class, but among the educated as well. Although more agreeable to talk to, they lacked that great and mighty principle which characterizes [MASK], called "the initiative."
<name>Old Dan</name>	Old Dan	Jack	I took another course in horse trading or mule trading, which almost came to be my undoing. I determined to get rid of [MASK]. I decided that I would not be aggravated with his laziness and crow-hopping any longer than it took me to find a trade.
<name>Eveline</name>	Eveline	Jessie	The door was opened in a few minutes and before me stood [MASK]. She had changed quite a bit in the three years and now with long skirts and the eyes looked so tired and dream-like. She was quite fascinating, this I took in at a glance.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Claves	I wore a Prince Albert coat and trousers to match which belonged to [MASK] and were too small and tight, making me uncomfortable. I was not long in getting out of them after undergoing the ordeal of being kissed by all the ladies present.
<name>Neighbor</name>	Neighbor	Si	Now country people have the unpardonable habit of gossip, and have complicated many deals of the real-estate men by this weakness, even caused many to fall through, until, the land sharks are usually careful to prevent a buyer from having a conversation with "[MASK]."
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Ethel	When he and [MASK] had entered our home three weeks before, neither shed a tear nor showed any emotion whatever, and had not even referred to the death of the baby, but set up a quarrel that never ceased after I went away. "
<name>However</name>	However	Futhermore	I had been very successful in farming although I had made some very poor deals in the beginning, and when my crops were sold that season I found I had made three thousand, five hundred dollars. [MASK], I had in the beginning sought to secure the best land in the best location and had succeeded.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Jessie	I had grown quite tall and rugged, and I was anxious to see how she looked. We were received by her mother who said: "[MASK] saw you coming and will be out shortly." After a while she entered and how she had changed.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Ethel	He reads nothing but radical negro papers and wants everybody to regard him as being a brilliant man, and you might as well try to reason with two trees, or a brick wall, as to try to reason with him or [MASK]. I'm so sorry papa is so ignorant.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Oscar	The only thing I did not like, was, that [MASK] thought more of his land and money than he did of me, and I wanted to be first.'" "Isn't that deplorable," I put in, shaking my head sadly.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Orlean	I said. "How much?" "Fifty dollars," she answered, clinging to my arm. "Good gracious, [MASK]!" I exclaimed, near to fright. "We haven't got that much in the bank." "Oh!
<name>resentment</name>	resentment	Satan	When he got out of the livery rig that brought them I could see [MASK] in his face. A chance had come to him at last. It seemed to say: "Oh, now I'll fix you. Away when the child was born, eh?" His very expression seemed jubilant.
<name>Mrs. Brown</name>	Mrs. Brown	Claves	They were very home-like for city people, inviting me to supper and treating me with much respect. The head of the table was occupied by the Reverend when he was at home and by [MASK] when the Reverend was away.
<name>me</name>	me	Orlean	This was no doubt foolish, but it was the way I felt about it at the time. My father-in-law evidently thought me ungrateful, and wrote [MASK] that I should write him or the folks at home occasionally, but I remained obdurate.
<name>Jennie</name>	Jennie	Wheeler	She has thought her father in the right all along, but now that she has heard her father condone dishonesty she can no longer think so. [MASK] disobeys orders and sends the paper to press without "killing the story," and "all's well that ends well."
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jessie	I had just paid [MASK] a visit and I felt a little lonely. With the grim reality of the situation facing me, I now began to steel my nerves for a lot of new experience which soon came thick and fast.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Keeler	After we had driven a few miles he told me [MASK] had said to him that he was a fool to waste his time hauling a d---- nigger around over the reservation; that I didn't have any money and was just "stalling.
<name>I</name>	I	Orlean	We had been uneasy for fear the Elder might hear of my being in the city, before [MASK] got away. I rushed to the window and saw my wife coming leisurely along the walk, entirely ignorant of the anxious eyes watching her from the second-story window.
<name>Jenkins</name>	Jenkins	Ethel	He would tell this every few hours but I could see the evil of his heart in the expression of his eyes, leering at me, with hatred and malice in every look. He and [MASK] turned loose in about an hour.
<name>Wheeler</name>	Wheeler	Keeler	I had a talk with [MASK], but as he did not encourage me in my plan to make a purchase I went to another firm, a young lawyer and a fellow by the name of Slater, who ran a livery barn, around the corner.
<name>Johnson</name>	Johnson	Frank	But when the fellow whose timely information had kept me from embarrassing myself, and perhaps from insulting the young man, a few minutes later called out, "Hello, [MASK]!" to a tall man, one look disclosed to my scrutiny the negro in his features.
<name>Wang</name>	Wang	Ethiopian	Well, what is a fellow going to do. What I did was to take her into my arms and in spite of all the custom, loyalty, or the dignity of either [MASK] or the Caucasian race, loved her like a lover.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Nunemaker	Finally I ran onto an "Oklahoma" grafter by the name of [MASK]. He was a deceiving and unscrupulous rascal, but nevertheless possessed a pleasing personality, which stood him in good in his schemes of deception, and we became quite chummy.
<name>George</name>	George	Reverend	"Attend to what?" I asked. "Why, I'll send both of you a ticket." "O, really, [MASK], I thank you ever so much, but I could not think of accepting it, and you must not urge it.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Daisy	[MASK] was a nice girl, however, a little odd in appearance, having a light brown complexion, without color or blood visible in the cheeks; was small and bony; padded with so many clothes that no idea of form could be drawn.
<name>Comet</name>	Comet	Nicholson	Watch her grow!" The board walk four feet wide could not hold the crowd. It was a day of frenzied celebration--a day when no one dared mention [MASK]'s name unless they wanted to hear them called liars, wind jammers, and all a bluff.
<name>Wahb</name>	Wahb	William	[MASK], who had always been a money-maker and a still bigger spender, with the fine looks thrown in, had shown like a skyrocket before bursting. A rich Indian is something worth associating with, but a poor one is of small note.
<name>McGinty</name>	McGinty	Knight	There was one by the name of [MASK], a pitiable and forlorn character in whose breast "hope sprang eternal," who came to the "hole" every day, and in an entire year he had made one lone trip.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Claves	"Treated your wife ugly, and called you a jockey," here I came to and said to myself that here was some more of the elder's work, but I answered [MASK]: "I haven't the faintest idea of what you are talking about.
<name>Corbett</name>	Corbett	Calias	Round three. November. They rush to a clinch and spar. Referee cautions [MASK] for butting. They do some more sparring, and both seem cautious, with honors even at the end of the third round. Round four. December.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Orlean	I was hauling shelled corn to a feeder in town, when [MASK] came. She was driving a black horse, hitched to a little buggy I had purchased for her, and I met her on the road. I got out and kissed her fondly, then told what I had done.
<name>John</name>	John	Oscar	He did not speak to me, but bounded into the room where my wife was, and she must have read the same thing in his expression, for, as he talked about it later, I learned the first thing she said was: "Now, papa. You must not abuse [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Orlean	[MASK] and I attended a few shows at the downtown theatres during the week, the first being a pathetic drama which our friends advised us to see entitled "Madam X". I did not like it at all.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Hewitt	Now knowing that the directors had ordered the extension of the line to get the cattle business, [MASK] looked serious, finally arose from his chair, and went over to a map that entirely covered the side of the wall and showed all the lines of the C. & R.W.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Megoryites	However, this was countered immediately by [MASK] who promptly organized a commercial club and began the same kind of bid for trade. Thus the small ranchmen of the valley found themselves an object of much importance and began to awaken a little.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Grandma	My wife's letter, stated that she had received the money, and thanked me also stated that she would get the things for "[MASK]" that day. Neither grandmother or I received the things. I was so wrought up over it all, yet saw no place where I could get justice.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Orlean	A letter had been sent him by special delivery the day I arrived and the following morning a reply was received stating that if [MASK] married me, without my convincing him that I was marrying her for love, and not to hold down a Dakota claim, she would be doing so without his consent.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Orlean	[MASK] and I had been to the court house the day previous and got the license, and when her father told us we should go and get the license we looked at each other rather sheepishly, and stammered out something, but went down town and bought a pair of shoes instead.
<name>John</name>	John	Richard	Raising her arms in a gesture, she said: "If you remember the day after you were married, when we had the family and you over to dinner, and you and [MASK] (her husband), talked on race matters, that the Elder never joined.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Ernest	In fact he bought every piece of land that was purchasable. I watched this fight from the beginning, with interest, for I had become well enough acquainted with [MASK] to feel that he knew what he was about.
<name>Smithville</name>	Smithville	Megory	[MASK]'s brass band--organized for the purpose--undaunted, continued to play frantically at the depot to try to induce the crowded trains to unload a greater share, but to no avail, although the cars were stuffed like sandwiches.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Slater	We had agreed to give the girl three hundred and seventy-five dollars, and I had partly agreed to give [MASK] two hundred dollars commission. However, I decided this was too much, and told him I would give him only seventy-five dollars.
<name>John</name>	John	Claves	After I returned home, my wife began writing nice letters, and so did [MASK], who had done all a hen-pecked husband could do to help my wife and me. He wrote letters from the heart, declaring his intention to be more than a friend.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Orlean	I had no more money, as it was expensive to keep my grandmother and sister on their claims. They had no money and I had no outside support, not even the moral support of my people nor of [MASK]'s, who all seemed to take it for granted that I had plenty of ready money.
<name>Jed</name>	Jed	Stung	He finished with a snort and off he went. "[MASK], by cracky," was all I could say, and feeling rather blue I went to the barn where the team was, stroked them and hoped for the best.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Slater	However, [MASK] took the matter up and agreed to take me over the reservation and show me some good claims. If I bought, the drive was gratis, if not four dollars per day, and I accepted his proposition.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Orlean	I was told she had been treated in a like manner off and on for thirty years. As stated, I did not hear from the Reverend and when I wrote to [MASK] I implied that I did not think her father much of a business man.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Ethel	They were not wicked, and I also guessed that [MASK] felt very "aristocratic," and I wondered whether I would like the Reverend. He seemed to be regarded as a sort of monarch judging from the way he was spoken of by the family, but I had a "hunch" that
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Oscar	Now [MASK], let me give you some advice. Maybe you are not acquainted with the circumstances, for if you had been, in the beginning, you might have avoided this trouble. What I am telling you is from experience, and I know it to be true.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Orlean	Gradually, I learned from her, that the Reverend had circulated a report that [MASK] was at death's door when he came to her bedside; if he had not arrived when he did, she would have died, and when she was well enough to travel, he brought her home.
<name>John</name>	John	Megory	They had bidden him good-bye along in December, and although nothing was said about it, the truth was, [MASK] did not wish to see any more railroad contractors, for a while, not for five or ten years anyway.
