<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Gilmore	Had to get bond. [MASK] told him no Judge would give it. Why, the little boy he had hit in the trailer court died. What little boy, said the drunk? Those are your charges: drunk driving, auto homicide, hit and run.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Nicole	She was crying. Her great-grandmother was okay, but an active Mormon. It brought back [MASK]’s childhood when this same great-grandmother would get out of the tub, dry off, and immediately put on her religious garment next to her flesh.
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Chris	* They were all feeling pretty paranoid. [MASK] got up once to take a shower but started shaking when she realized there was a window in the bathroom and the killer could come through it. While the water was running she wouldn’t hear a sound.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Gilmore	It was hard to keep the gaze. “Hey,” said [MASK], “I don’t know. I don’t have a reason.” He was calm when he said it, and sad. Looked like he was close to crying.
<name>Reeves</name>	Reeves	Gary	The guards and the Warden did everything they could to build an intelligence system. So they depended, for what they knew, on snitches. A snitch, said [MASK], would even suck your cock and then run to the Warden with what you said.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Brenda	“If I’m wrong,” said [MASK], “then it’s not very nice.” He took ahold of her face and kissed her on the brow and said, “I can’t tell you what’s going on. You don’t want to be involved.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Gary	He had told her, she said, that he would get even with her for turning him in. Lately, there had been an orange van following her car. She thought it might be a friend of [MASK]’s.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Schiller	ANYWAY SO WHAT THE HELL ... Yeah, what the hell! Wish I could talk to you, [MASK]. I don’t like to write. Just ain’t the same as talking. You’d get more spontaneity in verbal exchange and, hence, better answers.
<name>I</name>	I	Pve	and I never cried not even when I was alone and I was completely alone. I knew that it would pass, eventually, and it did. I was able to shake it. That was a bad experience. [MASK] had others—unpleasant experiences of a long duration.
<name>Art</name>	Art	Nicole	What with the salaries he and his wife were making, they could buy a Dodge for her and for himself a nice little Malibu hardtop. It would have been swell, he assured [MASK], but here they’d only been married six months and his wife had developed colitis.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Barrett	In the criminal division of the Attorney General’s office, there were only two full-time attorneys, [MASK] and himself, plus a few law clerks and secretaries. That was not much staff to take on all that was coming in.
<name>Malone</name>	Malone	Gilmore	A man with [MASK]’s experience ought to know better. The Lieutenant looked one more time at the reports and decided he wouldn’t book him. He didn’t yet have all the facts in the Complaint, and it would amount to holding the man.
<name>Andy</name>	Andy	Schiller	The Warden still wouldn’t talk to him. [MASK] told himself, “If they do change their mind, I want to be right at the front door.” Now, he studied the prison plan for the media, and decided it was very professional.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Schiller	Just a massing upward, with lots of all-out pious feeling. High ambition. It did, however, have another kind of mystery. [MASK] had heard you couldn’t visit the Mormon Temple the way a tourist might enter a famous cathedral.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Nicole	In fact, she couldn’t smell alcohol on his breath. He did seem odd, however. She said, no, she hadn’t seen [MASK]. He said, “As far as I’m concerned, she can go to hell.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Dorius	Well, [MASK] knew he needed the time off. What with the eighty-hour weeks he had been putting in, he was not in shape to tackle a brief of this dimension. All the same, he felt like he’d been left on a siding.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Nicole	Rewrite them. Then they’d get into new hang-ups carrying out the new rules. It took [MASK] a long time to realize that that was the way the place was supposed to work. A lot of them got to like writing and rewriting the rules.
<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Toni	Several came over to ask if there was anything they could do about transportation, and [MASK] told them she was waiting for her daddy to come back. In a while, one of them said her father was waiting by the tower where their trucks were parked.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Gilmore	[MASK] replied, “Well, I am finally glad to see that the Jury is looking at me.” When this remark was received in silence, he added, “No, I have nothing to say.” “Is that all?” the Judge asked.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Vern	It wasn’t wide enough to take more than one car, but [MASK] had a strip of lawn beside it that could offer space for another car provided he could remove the concrete curb that separated the grass from the paving. That curb ran for thirty-five feet from the sidewalk to the garage.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Gary	She told him not to worry. It was only because she was without a car and needed wheels so desperately. It was really an incredible story in her own ears, all that stuff about the transmission out, and hitching to see [MASK].
<name>John</name>	John	Gary	She got herself together and said, “How are you doing, [MASK]?” He told some story about a man robbing a store and there was he getting shot in the attempt to prevent it. It was a shitty story and he was a shitty liar.
<name>John</name>	John	Gary	Their last conversation she had said, “[MASK], I’m just hoping you’re as intelligent as you keep telling me you are, and so you will, at least, try to look at my point of view.”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Richards	He half thought it would be pushed off another thirty days, or if it did take place it would be much later in the morning. Near noon, say, there might be clear word. Now, however, he recovered quickly and told [MASK] the Warden could move.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Gary	They could teach him how to hunt with bow and arrow, she was about ready to tell him, when all of a sudden she got a good look at [MASK] in the light. Speak of all the staring she had done, it was as if she hadn’t studied him at all yet.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Gilmore	[MASK] Uh, I would like to talk to you. I’d like to see you. But I can’t, so I’m sending you this letter through the newspaper, (long pause) We all die, it ain’t no big deal.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Gary	The record player was going and [MASK] said, “Come on, I haven’t danced in years.” So, they got up. She had heard him sing once and he was a terrible singer, but she could see he was going to be even worse as a dancer.
<name>Ellsberg</name>	Ellsberg	Ritter	After a couple of hours, however, it was no great place to wait. [MASK] was up in his room and he must have known the ACLU and the Attorney General were downstairs, but no further word was coming.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Gary	“Well, I’m sorry,” he said, “I still feel I can help you, you know.” He was damned if he was going to say, Go ahead and fire me, [MASK].
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Nicole	5 Now he sat on the bed of his little cottage room feeling dirty and stale from sleep and exhausted from the way he needed his sleep. Before him was the face of this girl [MASK] who was saying she was ready to kill him if he pressed charges.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Tamera	When they said good-bye, [MASK] passed over her telephone number, and said, “If you ever need help, I’d be glad to see you.” That was it. The newspaper didn’t assign her to the trial in October and she had no more to do with the case.
<name>Deanna</name>	Deanna	Angel	I just thought I’d let you read it. Guess I wasn’t thinking, huh?! I’m not gonna write to her. You’re the only girl in my life [MASK]. I wouldn’t take a thousand girls for you. August 25
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Becky	His looks, or something in the way he spoke, attracted attention. He got some mail out of it including a beautiful correspondence with this girl named [MASK]. He fell in love with her through her letters. Then she came to visit.
<name>Grandpa</name>	Grandpa	Bessie	They would take the drive forward and back, forty miles each way, every other Sunday, and the echoes of the past would reverberate like the slamming of the steel doors. [MASK] had a fund of stories and passed them out like confections.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Gary	At the end of a long letter to [MASK] that had been full of love, she put in a couple of sentences at the end to say how pointless it was that she spent so much time—and she wrote it right out—“getting fucked.”
<name>John</name>	John	Earl	It got to be a very long recess. The lawyers mingled with the news reporters. Everyone seemed uneasy. It was sinking in on [MASK] how extremely fatigued he felt from the last few days. One suit after another, faster than birds flying overhead.
<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Gary	If you want to try them on, you can.” “Without paying for them?” “Oh, yeah, you can try them on first,” she said. 4 [MASK]’s first working day in the shop was good.
<name>John</name>	John	Charley	There was a lot of smoke you couldn’t control and soot, and the marinade got charred, instead of there being a juicy tender really deep old-fashioned pit barbecue. [MASK] couldn’t even excuse himself for letting the fire go out.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Max	She didn’t know what time it was until she got up and passed the kitchen clock and saw it was two in the morning and [MASK] was still away. Then she turned on the porch light and looked out the little window that was set in the door.
<name>Red</name>	Red	Campbell	Sometimes a convict would come in and say a particular man was after him. [MASK] wouldn’t go to the Warden and discuss what the man had said. The action taken would enable other inmates to pick up that the man was snitching. They’d be after him even more.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Gary	So she didn’t visit the jail, or write. She wanted to wait until she could tell him she loved him enough to be able to do what he asked. Chapter 22 TROTH 1 [MASK] was so quiet over the next few days that it got ominous.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Max	[MASK] spoke of how there were too few people in this world who were really honest. He gave a powerful speech on the importance of being honest. It made all the difference between being able to build on a real foundation or not being able to.
<name>He</name>	He	Gary	It made him miss her more. Sex was like a sacred thing to him, a way to express a feeling. The next day, she called him up. “I’m pretty upset,” she said, “pretty down.” [MASK] had become very dominating.
<name>Algren</name>	Algren	Nicole	okay without [MASK]’s, a scenario could be worked up of a guy who comes out of prison and struggles with his old con habits, but finally kills a man, a real study of the pains of getting out ofjail.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Pete	She kept saying, “I don’t feel right.” It wasn’t, she explained, the overwhelming thing you should have. Finally, she agreed to marry him. There was tension between [MASK] and the kids.
<name>Madonna</name>	Madonna	Gilmore	‘All that’s left now is the paper work, ’ his partner answers. “With the appearance of [MASK], the reporters become a mob, a herd spooked into stampede. Camera lights tilt crazily up into the air as their bearers struggle to shift them into position.
<name>Let’s get it on,” was his look. Maybe that was good for a lawyer. [MASK] was having to make a lot of decisions about people before he knew how much to trust them. That was not what he would call comfortable.	Let’s get it on,” was his look. Maybe that was good for a lawyer. [MASK] was having to make a lot of decisions about people before he knew how much to trust them. That was not what he would call comfortable.	Vern	“Let’s get it on,” was his look. Maybe that was good for a lawyer. [MASK] was having to make a lot of decisions about people before he knew how much to trust them. That was not what he would call comfortable.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Tamera	[MASK] felt humiliated for him in leg manacles, walking in short jerky steps like he was a spavined monster or something, but it was the girl who drew her, in fact, absolutely fascinated her by those looks.
<name>Gilmore</name>	Gilmore	Larry	He’s trying to do it. That’s all. He’s working his ass off. gilmore I asked him not to read those letters and he did. moody Okay, (long pause) Don’t you feel that you owe [MASK] something?
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Judith	[MASK] was thinking: The Utah law says you must go before the Court, but it’s all being done by telephone. This is spooky. She decided to be as nasty as she could. Kept turning to them with a smile to ask, “What did you say again?”
<name>Easy</name>	Easy	April	“I,” said [MASK], “got up this morning and cooked me a two-egg omelet with cheese in the middle and pieces of thin toast, some Tang, and some strawberry milk with sliced banana. Too much. I never tasted anything like that food.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Gary	So she went out and [MASK] said, “I’ve got something in my car I want to leave here for a little while,” and he went over to the Mustang and took a diaper bag out of the trunk and moved it over to the back of her car.
<name>Officer</name>	Officer	Wootton	Yes, I guess I did. Face down? No, I don’t know if I went into all that much detail, [MASK]. Did he lay down face down? He laid down on the floor. Did you put the gun up against his head?
<name>Raymond</name>	Raymond	Lee	She’d begin to feel nervous while waiting for [MASK] to come out of the tub. Soon after, sitting in the living room alone with her, he would open his bathrobe and ask her to play. Called it rubbing pee-pees.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Nicole	“I don’t care whether he did or not. I’m not going to see him. I’m there to wait for you.” “No,” [MASK] said, “I’ll go myself.”
<name>She</name>	She	Sundberg	It was the kind of notebook you could buy in a drugstore with a nice hard cover. Maybe fifty empty pages. [MASK] was in a hurry and she sort of leafed through while he was there, and he promised to bring it back the next day.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Gary	Chinese end tables and big colored hassocks took up space on the floor. Having lived among steel bars, reinforced concrete, and cement-block walls, [MASK] would now be spending a lot of his time in this living room.
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Toni	He said, “I wish we had more time together.” “I’m sorry too,” said [MASK]. “Well,” he said, “maybe it’s for a reason. Maybe if we’d developed a relationship earlier, tonight wouldn’t mean so much.”
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Farrell	Besides, the rest of the piece was brilliant. A very good article. “Carrion bird” was going to get picked up, but on balance he was ahead. He began to think again of inviting [MASK] to work on the questions.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Gilmore	Supposedly, it was just samples, but he was really giving it away. Yet, divulging the information seemed to cool his fear a bit. Trying to up the ante, he said, “[MASK] has told me things he hasn’t told anyone else alive.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Johnny	she asked [MASK] now. “How could he have done that to a man who trusted him?” “I guess he was saying a man will do anything in prison to amuse himself. If you can’t, you’re gone.”
<name>Nixon</name>	Nixon	Gilmore	In fact, as [MASK] got into the car, he turned around, looked out the window and gave a wide thin-lipped grin at the press, a mean and merciless look, and raised his middle finger slowly in the air as if to implant it forever in each witness’s ass.
<name>King</name>	King	Greenberg	That’s a devastating commentary,” said [MASK]. “Secondly, it could offer a wonderful statement about capital punishment and how godawful it is, eye for an eye. I even think that reaching a large audience can probably save the guy’s life.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Gary	Then she saw [MASK] come toward her from the back of the cell. His left hand was in a cast. It was only three days from the night she had seen him arrested and lying on the ground, but she could feel the difference.
<name>Mailer</name>	Mailer	Dennis	Outside the prison, [MASK] had never felt more like talking to the press. “I’m a character in this thing I’m writing,” he said to them, “so I don’t plan out everything I do. I’m being acted upon by the real author of these events.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Gary	Long skinny people wearing capes were walking around that countryside. [MASK] said, “Turn off the light. I need my sleep.” She lay there some more, and he came over to her bed in the dark and tried to make her.
<name>Nixon</name>	Nixon	Gary	Talk about the will. It’s all part of history. You never know when it’s going to be important.” Sometimes he would give them a message for [MASK] and not be certain it had gotten through. Certainly didn’t hear it on the tapes.
<name>Prentice</name>	Prentice	Gibbs	In fact, thought [MASK], he might. He had as much loyalty in one direction as in the other. He was the man in the old saying. “You got blue eyes, one blew north, one blew south.”
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Mormons	The way he was dressed, it would not be hard to get into trouble in a strange place. One difficulty was that there were no nice cocktail lounges around. [MASK] didn’t see any reason for public drinking to take place in agreeable surroundings.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Gary	“I’d have done it for you,” he said. “I believe that,” she said, and added, “[MASK], I love you very much, but I couldn’t’ve done that for you.” “You betrayed me.”
<name>He</name>	He	Gibbs	In the meantime, the doctor came by to check his leg, refill his prescription and remove the stitches from his forehead. Slowly, his cash was going down, but [MASK] didn’t think about it. He had never been able to manage money anyway.
<name>Lauren</name>	Lauren	Nicole	Went back to the office, and spent the rest of the night working on the story. Over the last week, [MASK] had gone to several doctors she had picked from the phone book and told them she was from out of state and had trouble sleeping.
<name>Reggie</name>	Reggie	Gibbs	Like cat and mouse. Hell, like cat and rat. 2 There were only three things in the world [MASK] could honestly say he had any feeling for: children, kittens, and money. Been on his own since he was 14.
<name>Ratso</name>	Ratso	Gibbs	“No,” [MASK] said, “he didn’t know anything they needed to know. It was just for my own protection. I didn’t like the idea of being in the main tank. Some of the people I was going to testify against could have had friends passing through.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Frank	When they ran down, nobody was there. Then a flood came, and the safety valve in the basement heater failed to turn off after the fire went out. Gas started bubbling up along the walls. [MASK] said, “That’s it.
<name>Mavis</name>	Mavis	Nicole	But now she had to ask questions. “What about the kids?” she wanted to know. [MASK] looked like she would cry. She didn’t, she confessed, treat them nearly as good as she wanted to.
<name>She</name>	She	Brenda	He said nothing in reply. [MASK] had the impression he was nervous but careful. Very nervous, and very careful. He was sitting on the edge of his seat, as if to concentrate on every sound in the silence.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jerry	The fellow said, “Yes,” and added, “He was dead, but we had to officially wait until he quit moving. That was about two minutes later:” After this, it got really gruesome. [MASK] had to admit it.
<name>Reverend</name>	Reverend	Max	[MASK] now connected that to the subject of his talk by pointing out how it was not enough to devote your life to living by the Scriptures, you also had to know just where you were in life, otherwise you might not relate the teachings properly to your own situation.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Gary	She’d had guys cry when she left them. She was good at turning herself off when they got like that, thought it was a weakness to cry over a girl. With [MASK], she wasn’t thinking about weakness. Wanted to do something for him.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Gary	The driver immediately reached down to turn the radio off, but [MASK] looked up and said, “Please leave it on.” So they began to drive and there was music coming from the radio. The words of the song told of the flight of a white bird.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Gary	Her laughter reached to the place where she hated people who had a lot of things and acted hot shit about it. 5 For the first time she had a day when she thought she shouldn’t be living with [MASK] so much.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Woods	So they decided to roll it down the highway. [MASK] tried to talk them out of that. Right in the middle, he could not get over the fact that he, with his own big reputation to maintain, was being the peacemaker. He failed.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Arroyo	He had noticed, while registering, a large motel attendant with a small wife. Now neither of them was visible. Instead, a tall man with a goatee was stepping around the counter just as [MASK] came along the street. The man had a cash drawer in his hand.
<name>Officer</name>	Officer	Allen	Next [MASK] told him to put those hands outside the driver’s window. The driver hesitated again. Then he finally obeyed. Now he was told to open the door by the outside latch. Once that door was open, he was told to get out of the truck.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Brenda	There was something so real about the way he said it. Couples kept coming from parties and leaving, and the sound of cars parking and taking off didn’t stop. Still, [MASK] was not looking at the door.
<name>You</name>	You	Sterling	Together me and you and your kids. Here is what I want: a carbon steel high quality hacksaw blade. They sell them in hardware stores. I need a pair of shoes size 11. [MASK] can put the hacksaw blade inside the sole of the shoes.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Gary	“They can’t hurt me,” said [MASK]. “Oh, no? Your eye is cut and it’s turning black, and you’ve got a lump on your forehead and he gave you a good one on the nose.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Gary	She said to herself, “Am I trying to get out of going to the execution?” Then thought, “No, I want to be there.” She had been talking to [MASK] on the phone, and feelings had improved.
<name>Tracy</name>	Tracy	Bushnell	Neither one of’em were hard or easy. Had you ever had any dealings of any kind with either of No. Well, what led you to the City Center Motel, where [MASK] worked? We’re just trying to understand the quality of this rage you speak of.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Ben	They also dressed well and they managed to meet a $100 payment each month on their Pinto. [MASK] could have been the huge man who gets out of the little Pinto in the TV commercial. They worked hard, however.
<name>McGee</name>	McGee	Allen	“Anything you say may he used against you in a court of law. Do you understand?”asked [MASK]. A nod. “You have the right to consult an attorney before speaking to the police and to have an attorney present during any questions now or in the future.
<name>Reilly</name>	Reilly	Gary	Then other looks might appear. Half an hour later, one could see vulnerability, or tenderness, or just plain misery. Later, when she got to know [MASK] better, he explained carefully that there were two kinds of prisoners: inmates and convicts.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Gary	So, they met. On opposite sides of the glass. Spoke by telephone, and it was a cold meeting. “Do you want us to represent you?” they asked, and [MASK] answered, “Let me talk to my uncle.”
<name>He</name>	He	Gilmore	The closer to sunrise that [MASK] was executed, the better. The law didn’t like to make too much out of too little. There would be less exposure to counterargument if they missed execution by a few minutes rather than a few hours.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Vern	Going to visit him, he felt awkward. [MASK] had just gotten out of the hospital after an operation on his bad knee, and walking, even with a cane, felt like hammering a nail into his bone.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Gilmore	That got [MASK] upset all over again. He was being very protective about his person and his personal items. This last was just a bunch of letters and some books, but he wouldn’t let them out of his sight and acted like the skin shake was a personal attack.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Gibbs	That was something, he told [MASK], he did every night. Had to, in order to tire himself out enough to get a little sleep. He did a hundred sit-ups, took a break, then didjumpingjacks, clapping his hands over his head.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Nicole	So Monday afternoon, after she left [MASK], she returned to the paper, read through the letters, and worked on her story all night without thinking once where they’d put it. Yet by the time she finished, 7 a.m., she should have known.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Spencer	It was more like he was offended there was something wrong with the car. What he couldn’t recognize was that these malfunctions might be due to his inability to drive knowledgeably. One more reason for [MASK] to be after him continuously about starting the study program for a driver’s license.
