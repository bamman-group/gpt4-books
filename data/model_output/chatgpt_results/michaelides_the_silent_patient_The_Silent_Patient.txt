<name>someone</name>	someone	Max	Or maybe I’m just not a very good actress. Last night, as we were getting ready for bed, he said I’d been weird the whole time [MASK] was there. “I was just tired.” “No, it was more than that.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Christian	I glanced at her as I said [MASK]’s name. I hoped for some kind of reaction, a narrowing of the eyes, a clenched jaw—something, anything—but there was nothing, not even a blink.
<name>Alex</name>	Alex	Alicia	To see what I’m made of? I think it’s important that you know I’m not easily intimidated. I can take whatever you throw at me.” [MASK] looked out the window at the gray sky beyond the bars. I waited a moment.
<name>Siobhan</name>	Siobhan	Kathy	“A pint. Guinness.” He yawned and went to the other side of the bar to pour the pint. I kept my eyes on [MASK]. I was pretty sure she wouldn’t be able to see me through the window even if she looked in this direction.
<name>Carl</name>	Carl	Ruth	[MASK] said that enforcement and constraint never produced anything good, and that, rather than force myself to live without weed, a better starting place might be to acknowledge that I was now dependent on it, and unwilling or unable to abandon it.
<name>Wharton</name>	Wharton	Alicia	“I’m not sure I understand what you mean.” “Well, at the heart of all art lies a mystery. [MASK]’s silence is her secret—her mystery, in the religious sense. That’s why she named it Alcestis. Have you read it?
<name>my husband</name>	my husband	Gabriel	I don’t miss those druggy partyers who passed for friends during my twenties. I only ever saw them at night—they vanished at dawn, like vampires fleeing the light. When I met [MASK], they faded away into nothing, and I didn't even notice.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Gabriel	Only a couple more hours to go. It will be light soon. august 15 [MASK] came downstairs ready to go to the shoot. When he saw me by the window and realized I'd been up all night, he went quiet and started acting strange.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Yuri	A tall man appeared at my side. He grinned at me and held out his hand. He introduced himself as [MASK], head psychiatric nurse. “Welcome to the Grove. Not much of a welcoming committee, I’m afraid. Just me.”
<name>Her</name>	Her	Alicia	“And then? What happened?” “He locked the door. And I was trapped.” [MASK]’s breathing was heavy and her cheeks were flushed. I was concerned she was becoming distressed, and I was wary of pushing her too hard.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Ruth	The fabric underneath my fingertips had been worn thin by the anxious rubbing of many patients, myself included. I took a sip of sherry. It was warm, sweet, and a little sickly, but I drank it down, conscious of [MASK] watching me the whole time.
<name>her</name> (There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to a pronoun)	her (There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to a pronoun)	Barbie	The man had gone. I don’t know why I told [MASK] about it. I don’t like her or trust her—but I was scared, I suppose, and I needed someone to talk to, and she happened to be there.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Kathy	They darted up to my face. We stared at each other. “Love includes all kinds of feelings, doesn’t it? Good and bad. I love my wife—her name is [MASK]—but sometimes I get angry with her. Sometimes ...
<name>Isadora</name>	Isadora	Alcestis	“And what is your difficulty?” “My difficulty is the fact she doesn’t speak. [MASK] dies for her husband. And at the end, she comes back to life—but remains silent.” “Ah.
<name>Babe</name>	Babe	Lydia	[MASK] was nude, reclining on a tiny bed. The bed was buckling under her weight. She was enormously, monstrously fat—an explosion of flesh spilling over the bed and hitting the floor and spreading across the room, rippling and folding like waves of gray custard.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Barbie	[MASK] had let herself in the side gate and was in the garden, clutching a bottle of wine. “Hi, honey. I saw you weren’t in your studio. I wondered where you were.” “I was out, I just got back.”
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Diomedes	“It’s true, isn’t it? You campaigned to lower her medication—” I laughed. “It was hardly a campaign. It was an intervention. She was drugged up to the eyeballs. A zombie.” “Bullshit.” I turned to [MASK].
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Joel	About what happened at [MASK]’s." “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” “Don't you?” “I don’t remember. I was rather drunk, I’m afraid.” “Bullshit." “It’s true.”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Ruth	I wondered what [MASK] would say if I went to find her again—as I did six years ago—and confessed all this to her? But I knew it was impossible. That I was altogether a different creature now, a guiltier thing, less capable of honesty.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Alicia	I must have been mistaken. I must have imagined it. But then ... it happened again. [MASK]’s lips moved slowly, painfully; her voice cracked a little as it emerged, like a creaking gate that needed oiling. “What...” she whispered.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Max	“Yes, we had dinner together.” “How did they seem?” [MASK]’s eyes glazed over. Presumably he’d been asked this question hundreds of times, and his response was automatic, without thinking. “Normal. Totally normal.”
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Alicia	“The truth is [MASK] was hugely fucked up. Not as an artist, but as a person she was extremely vulnerable. When her father hanged himself, it was too much. She couldn’t cope.” “She must have loved him a great deal.”
<name>her</name> (There is no proper name given in the sentence, and the only option for the [MASK] token is a pronoun referring to a female person.)	her (There is no proper name given in the sentence, and the only option for the [MASK] token is a pronoun referring to a female person.)	Elif	I wasn’t sure why this incident drew my attention. But it didn’t feel right to me. I decided to approach [MASK] and ask her about it. I tore off a sheet of paper from a pad and reached for my pen.
<name>you</name>	you	Theo	She stopped texting and put down her phone. “[MASK], we need to talk.” “What about?” “Don’t you have something to tell me?” Her voice had a stern note. I avoided looking at her, in case she could read my thoughts.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Gabriel	We made love in the studio, there on the floor. The whole time, I kept glancing at the lifeless eyes in [MASK]’s portrait. They were staring at me, burning into me. I had to turn away. But I could still feel them watching.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Paul	She was leaning heavily on her walking stick, which was buckling under her weight and looked like it might give way at any moment. “Who is he? Who is he?” Her shrill question was directed to [MASK], even though she was staring at me.
<name>Marina</name>	Marina	Lydia	[MASK] turned to me. I was surprised how much anger was in her voice. “The bitch painted me. She painted me, with- out my knowledge or permission. I went to her exhibition—and there it was, hanging there.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Kathy	A sudden buzz of conversation, loud Thank yous and Goodbyes as people left the house. I froze. Right in front of me, [MASK]’s lover stopped and looked in the direction of the noise, at the house. I stepped aside and hid behind a tree.
<name>her</name>	her	Kathy	The next day, we went out and she chose a ring. And the reality of the situation dawned on me. We were engaged. Bizarrely, the first people I thought of were my parents. I wanted to introduce [MASK] to them.
<name>you</name>	you	Alicia	You’re watching me. I know you are." “What? I have no idea what you are talking about, [MASK].” “Don't lie to me." I was finding it hard to control my voice. I wanted to scream.
<name>German</name>	German	Latvian	“Not really. English is an easy language. You should try [MASK].” He laughed and reached for the jangling chain of keys around his belt. He pulled off a set and handed it to me. “You’ll need these for the individual rooms.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Alicia	“[MASK]?” I nodded. I sat in front of the desk. He sat down behind it. His hair was sticking up to one side, and he still looked half-asleep. “Are you sure I shouldn’t come back later?”
<name>she</name>	she	Alicia	I told him that [MASK] had given me her diary to read. “Her diary? I didn’t know she kept one. What does it say?” “It might be easier to talk in person. Are you free today at all?”
<name>Dr. John</name>	Dr. John	Diomedes	Well, patience is a virtue you would do well to cultivate as a psychotherapist. You know, in my youth, I was undecided whether I should be a musician, a priest, or a doctor.” [MASK] laughed. “And now I am all three.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Kathy	She was sitting at the back of the cafe with a couple of fellow actresses, deep in conversation. They looked up at me as I approached. “Are your ears burning, darling?” [MASK] said as she kissed me. “Should they be?”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Christian	They certainly didn’t do it in front of the patients. To stand here in the courtyard and smoke with her did feel like a transgression. I was probably imagining it, but I felt we were being watched. I sensed [MASK] spying on us from the window.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Paul	“Everything all right, Mum?” A mumbled response that I couldn’t understand came from upstairs. “What? Oh, all right. Just—just a minute.” He sounded uneasy. [MASK] glanced at me across the hallway, frowning.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Yuri	She stared at me, as if seeing me clearly for the first time, taking me in, sizing me up. I wondered what she was concluding. Evidently she judged it safe to proceed and walked inside. Without being asked, she sat down. I nodded at [MASK] to go.
<name>Nurse Ratched</name>	Nurse Ratched	Christian	Her face was pressed up against it, squashing her nose, distorting her features, making her almost monstrous. “I won’t take this shit no more. I hate this—these fucking pills, man—” [MASK] opened a small hatch in the glass and spoke through it.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Gabriel	As I write this, I can’t honestly say I think I’ll paint again. Not until all this is behind me, anyway. I’ve been making excuses about why I don't want to go out, but [MASK] told me tonight I had no choice.
<name>Dr. Karen</name>	Dr. Karen	Ruth	[MASK] looked me in the eyes. She held my gaze. “I think you must leave. And I’m not saying this as your old therapist—but as your old friend. I don’t think you could go back, even if you wanted to.
<name>Olivia</name>	Olivia	Barbie	It’s been one of those days.” [MASK] poured herself a large glass of red wine and curled up in the armchair as if she were settling in for a good chat. “I’m all yours.” She smiled flirtatiously. “What do you want to know?”
<name>the narrator's</name>	the narrator's	Kathy	Soon his voice faded into silence. I was alone. I kept walking. i walked back to the house where [MASK]’s lover lived. I stood there for an hour, watching. Eventually the door opened, and he emerged. I watched him leave.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Elif	Before I could respond, I felt my phone vibrating in my pocket. I checked it. I didn’t recognize the number. “I should answer this. Thank you. You’ve been very helpful.” [MASK] muttered something unintelligible and went back to her game.
<name>her</name>	her	Kathy	That’s the terrible irony: I did all this to keep [MASK]—and I’ve lost her anyway. I perched on the armrest and watched her a moment. “A patient of mine took an overdose. She’s in a coma.” No reaction.
<name>Andy</name>	Andy	Alicia	“I mean we painted walls together. As housepainters.” I smiled. “Oh, I see.” “It turned out I was better at painting walls than paintings. So I gave up, about the same time as [MASK]’s art started to really take off.
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Alicia	There was no point in staying further; she had nothing else to tell me. I had more than enough to think about. It was dark when I left her house. I paused a moment outside the house next door—[MASK]’s old house.
<name>him</name> (There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to a pronoun)	him (There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to a pronoun)	Gabriel	“Yes, it sounds like it. And what about [MASK]?” “What about him?” I sensed a prickliness here, a defensive reaction that told me this was an avenue worth exploring. “Well, I wonder how he fit into this dynamic.
<name>Dr. Wilson</name>	Dr. Wilson	Yuri	We had to induce coma. Her respiratory system failed.” “What did she take?” “An opioid of some kind. Hydrocodone, probably.” [MASK] nodded. “There was an empty bottle of pills on the desk in her room.”
<name>Lena</name>	Lena	Kathy	“Idiot.” She kissed me. [MASK] was waiting at the entrance when I arrived, in her enormous coat and scarf, waving like an excited child. “Come on, come on, follow me.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Gabriel	We usually do on Fridays. “Date night,” he calls it, in a silly American accent. [MASK] always downplays his feelings and makes fun of anything he considers “soppy.” He likes to think of himself as cynical and unsentimental.
<name>he</name>	he	Kathy	And now she’s back.” A pause. “She wants me to meet her on Thursday ... Thursday night after rehearsal.” I don’t know what aroused my suspicion. Was it the way [MASK] was looking in my direction but not making eye contact?
<name>Dr. Karen</name>	Dr. Karen	Ruth	This gave me a kind of hope, however murky and ill defined. It propelled me at any rate to acknowledge that I couldn’t do this alone: I needed help. I found it—in the form of [MASK], a psychotherapist referred to me through the university counseling service.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Alicia	Don’t get upset. He’s [MASK]’s therapist, that’s all. From the hospital. He’s here to talk to me.” “You? What does he want to talk to you for? What have you done?”
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Ruth	Neither did [MASK]. “I don’t think so. I think her behavior suggests she is quite damaged—lacking in empathy and integrity and just plain kindness—all the qualities you brim with.” I shook my head. “That’s not true.”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Barbie	I’m going to have to deal with it alone. It was a mistake telling anyone. Tomorrow I'm going to tell [MASK] to forget all about it—I’ll say I've put it behind me and I don't want to talk about it again.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no context or clues provided to suggest a specific name.)	unknown (There is no context or clues provided to suggest a specific name.)	Max	And face [MASK]. JULY 24 I'm back in the cafe. Someone was sitting at my table, and the waitress gave me a sympathetic look—at least I think that’s what she was communicating, a sense of solidarity, but I could be wrong.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Alicia	“That’s all you get.” “Thanks, I appreciate it. You mentioned [MASK]’s suicide attempt. I was wondering, which hospital treated her?” “She wasn’t admitted to hospital.” “She wasn’t?” “No.
<name>Dr. Lecter</name>	Dr. Lecter	Yuri	Blank, expressionless. Empty. She stared straight at me. For the first time, I felt afraid. CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO “how is elif?” I was waiting in the goldfish bowl and caught [MASK] once he returned from the emergency ward.
<name>he</name>	he	Alicia	“I’m all yours.” She smiled flirtatiously. “What do you want to know?” “I have couple of questions, if that’s all right.” “Well, fire away.” “Did [MASK] ever mention seeing a doctor?”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Diomedes	I wondered how many other patients he was seeing “unofficially” and not declaring the income from them. “Look. If [MASK] finds out, I—I could lose my job. You know that, don’t you?”
<name>him</name> (Note: There is no proper name given in the passage)	him (Note: There is no proper name given in the passage)	Gabriel	I don't know what—maybe I was pushing too hard. I just couldn’t get the shape of his eyes right, nor the color. The first thing I ever noticed about [MASK] was the sparkle in his eyes—like a tiny diamond in each iris.
<name>Chuck</name>	Chuck	Theo	“Remember, [MASK]? How we got talking? You said you were training to be a shrink. And I said I was nuts—so it was a match made in heaven.” This got a big laugh from the girls.
<name>her</name>	her	Alicia	I’m storing it all for her.” “How nice of you.” “So you’re following my advice? Letting [MASK] paint?” “Yes. Whether anything will come of it remains to be seen.” “Oh, something will come of it.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Indira	“I find myself feeling very maternal toward her. That’s my countertransference, that’s what she brings out in me—I feel she needs someone to take care of her.” [MASK] smiled at me. “And now she has someone. She has you.”
<name>Janine</name>	Janine	Yuri	I lowered my voice. “I can take it from here, thanks.” [MASK] looked worried. “But she’s on one-on-one. And the professor said—” “I’ll take full responsibility. It’s quite all right.”
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Alicia	Every day, pretty much.” “How old were you?” “I was about seven, maybe eight. [MASK] couldn’t have been more than ten.” “You were a bit young to be climbing ladders.” “I suppose so.
<name>Dracula</name>	Dracula	Diomedes	Make her talk?” “I don’t know about rescuing her, but I’d like to help her. I’d like to try.” [MASK] smiled, still with the same sense of amusement. “You are not the first. I believed I would succeed.
<name>Dr. Sayer</name>	Dr. Sayer	Alicia	It didn’t Snow; instead it started raining heavily that afternoon. A storm with angry drumbeats of thunder and lightning flashes. I waited for [MASK] in the therapy room, watching the rain batter the window. I felt weary and depressed.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Kathy	I’ll see you soon. I won’t be long--Okay, okay, bye.” I froze—we were seconds away from colliding with each other. I dashed down the steps, hiding around the corner. [MASK] walked past without seeing me.
<name>him</name>	him	Kathy	I watched, feeling sick to my stomach, burning with hate. She eventually said goodbye to him, and they left each other. She started walking away. The man turned and walked in the opposite direction. I didn’t follow [MASK]. I followed him.
<name>Hazel</name>	Hazel	Kathy	She was a statue; a Greek goddess come to life in my hands. We lay there wrapped in each other’s arms. [MASK] was facing me, her eyes so close they were out of focus. I gazed into a hazy green sea. “Well?”
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Theo	“‘[MASK] just left. I am alone. I’m writing this as fast as I can_’” As I listened, I looked up at the white clouds drifting past. Finally, they had opened—it had started to snow—snowflakes were falling outside.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Gabriel	“Closer than most. Though he took center stage, of course. I was rather overshadowed by him.” “Why was that?” “Well, it was difficult not to be. [MASK] was special, even as a child.”
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Gabriel	But as soon as I thought this, I knew it wasn’t true. If he were really going to paint the house, he wouldn't just be sitting there—he’d be making sketches. I got myself into a state about it and I phoned [MASK].
<name>Helmut Newton</name>	Helmut Newton	Alicia	He had a distinctive style, shooting semi-starved, semi-naked women in strange, unflattering angles. Since his death, the price of his photographs has increased astronomically. I find his stuff rather slick and shallow, to be honest. It has none of the visceral quality of [MASK]’s best work.
<name>the bank</name>	the bank	Kathy	And waited. So this was the meeting place. A good spot—central, busy, anonymous. I hesitated and slipped into a pub on the corner. I positioned myself at the bar. It offered a clear view through the window of [MASK] across the road.
<name>She</name>	She	Alicia	Reflected in the window. He was inside—inside the studio. Standing right behind me.” [MASK] shut her eyes and sat quite still. There was a long pause. I spoke gently. “Can you describe him? What did he look like?”
<name>She</name>	She	Alicia	I stopped treading softly and got directly to the point: “I’d like to talk about your silence. About what it means ... what it feels like. And specifically why you stopped talking.” [MASK] didn’t look at me. Was she even listening?
<name>Hannah</name>	Hannah	Alicia	I stroked her wrist with my finger, feeling the veins under her skin, and the raised, thickened scars from her suicide attempts. So this was it. This was how it was going to end. [MASK] was silent again, and this time her silence would last forever.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Elif	Then why did she attack you?” [MASK] s lips twisted into a kind of smile. She didn’t speak. We sat like that for a few moments. I was about to give up, then she spoke. “I told her the truth.”
<name>Dr. Turner</name>	Dr. Turner	Indira	Am I a difficult patient?” [MASK] laughed. “No, although I find it works just as well on difficult members of staff too—which you’re not either, by the way. A little bit of sugar is a great mood enhancer.
<name>Lisa</name>	Lisa	Marianne	While she was showering, I phoned [MASK]. I wanted to arrange to see her, to tell her face-to-face. But she was annoyed about the previous night and insisted we have it out then and there, on the phone.
<name>Trudy</name>	Trudy	Elif	[MASK] was on the other side of the glass, hammering at it with her fists. Her face was pressed up against it, squashing her nose, distorting her features, making her almost monstrous. “I won’t take this shit no more.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Christian	“Well, rats desert a sinking ship. They don’t clamber on board.” I was startled by [MASK]’s undisguised aggression. I decided not to rise to the bait. I shrugged. “Possibly. But I’m not a rat.”
<name>she</name>	she	Alicia	But why? I take it it was unprovoked?” “Yes. At least, consciously.” “And unconsciously?” “Well, obviously [MASK] was reacting to me on some level. I believe it shows us how much she wants to communicate.”
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Alicia	“I’ll do anything you want, anything—please, please let him live—he deserves to live. He's the kindest and the best of men—and I love him, I love him so much—” “Tell me, [MASK].
<name>the victim's</name>	the victim's	Gabriel	The wall behind him was sprayed with fragments of skull, brains, hair—and blood. Blood was everywhere—splashed on the walls, running in dark rivulets along the floor, along the grain of the wooden floorboards. The officers assumed it was [MASK]’s blood.
<name>Mama's</name>	Mama's	Augusta	Even though we went to our old favorite, [MASK]'s, I didn’t feel safe. It didn't feel comforting or familiar like it used to. The restaurant seemed different somehow. And it smelled different—it smelled of something burning.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Indira	[MASK] gave my arm a squeeze and left. I looked at my watch. I thought about leaving early, going home. I felt exhausted. I was about to turn off the light and leave when a thought occurred to me and I felt my body stiffen.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Alicia	At the back was a large willow tree—a beautiful tree, majestic, with long bare branches sweeping to the ground. I pictured [MASK] as a child playing around it and in the secret, magical world beneath its branches. I smiled. Then I felt uneasy suddenly.
<name>Joey</name>	Joey	Darling	“I’m calling him right now." “[MASK], don’t, please. I’m sure it’s not him.” “Positive?" “Absolutely. Nothing happened. I don't know why I’m making such a big deal out of it.
<name>he</name>	he	Yuri	I didn’t blame her, I thought. I was about to make my excuses, but [MASK] kept talking. “It was very hard to accept. I was sure we were meant to be together. She broke my heart. I got very angry with her.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Barbie	It’s amazing.” A long and complicated explanation of the dietary demands by [MASK]’s doctor followed, and an insistence I pay him a visit soon. I was starting to lose patience. It took some effort to get her back on track.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Allen	Given all the publicity, I daresay he’s right.” [MASK] gave me an appraising look. “You might want to write about her, sir. I’m sure there’ll be interest in a book, or something like that.” “I hadn’t considered it....
<name>Mrs. Coulter</name>	Mrs. Coulter	Kathy	I avoided looking at her, in case she could read my thoughts. I felt ashamed and furtive—as if I were the one with the guilty secret. And I was, as far as she was concerned. [MASK] reached behind the sofa and picked something up.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Diomedes	“I can’t help but feel sorry for him—not a particularly glorious end to a long and distinguished career. But at least this way he’ll be spared the press and all the hoo-ha. Incidentally, he mentioned you.” “[MASK]?”
<name>Amory</name>	Amory	Gabriel	He just sat there with that thin smile of his. He looked at me like I was an insect or something. I know he’s supposedly a friend of [MASK]’s, but I don’t see how they ever could have been friends.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Paul	“I'll come to you. This afternoon. Okay?" Something in [MASK]’s voice made me agree without thinking about it. He sounded desperate. “Okay. Are you sure you can’t tell me about it now?" “I’ll see you later.”
<name>the woman</name>	the woman	Tanya	I took a closer look at [MASK] in reception— she was blond, pretty, rather petite. She blew her nose, and I noticed the large diamond on her wedding finger. To my surprise, she got up and walked toward me, frowning.
