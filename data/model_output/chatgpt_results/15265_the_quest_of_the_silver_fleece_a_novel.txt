<name>Eurylochus</name>	Eurylochus	Zora	The hag whimpered and snarled. Far down in the field of the Fleece, [MASK] lay curled beneath a tall dark tree asleep. All night there was coming and going in the cabin; the talk and laughter grew loud and boisterous, and the red fire glared in the night.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Miss	She saw a dingy lunchroom marked "Colored," but she had no time to go to it for her train was ready. There was another colored porter on this, and he was very polite and affable. "Yes, [MASK]; certainly I'll fetch you a lunch--plenty of time."
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Zora	As they stood together, the white woman deemed the moment opportune; she slipped her arm about the black woman's waist and began: "[MASK], I've had something on my mind for a long time, and I shouldn't wonder if you had thought of the same thing."
<name>Hayes</name>	Hayes	Easterly	Give him a chance and I'll warrant he'll develop all the desirable traits of a first class office-holder." [MASK] hesitated. "We must not offend the South, and we must placate the Negroes," he said. "
<name>Sal</name>	Sal	Bles	"The dark of the moon, boy, the dark of the moon--the first dark--at midnight." [MASK] could not wring another word from her; nor did the ancient witch, by word or look, again give the slightest indication that she was aware of his presence.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Zora	"I--I must go now," gasped [MASK], as the carriage swept away. He did not hold her, he did not offer the farewell kiss, but stood staring at the road as she walked into the swamp.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Zora	"[MASK], I need some one to help me--to do my hair and serve my coffee, and dress and take care of me. The work will not be hard, and you can travel and see the world and live well. Would you like it?"
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Miss--	"It--it would be decidedly the proper thing," he murmured, "and we could, of course, invite [MASK]" She saw the difficulty and interrupted him: "It's quite unnecessary; she'll think I have simply gone for a long walk."
<name>Jerry</name>	Jerry	Maxwell	"Worked out, and not worth five dollars an acre!" snapped the Colonel. But he did not propose to hand [MASK] a thousand dollars. "Now, see here, I'll treat you as well as anybody, and you know it."
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Teerswell	[MASK] nodded and said: "Well, what do you think of last night?" "A great speech, I hear." "A fool speech--that speech cost him, I calculate, between twenty-four and forty-eight thousand dollars."
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Taylor	[MASK] did not look up. "Can't tell," he said, "'fraid not much though." He glanced through a telegram. "No--damn it!--outside mills are low; they'll stampede soon. Meantime we'll buy." "
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Smith	"Don't you see," he said angrily, "that that will ruin our plans for the Cotton Combine?" "Yes, I do," replied [MASK]; "but it will not do the immediate harm that the amended Child Labor Bill will do."
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Zora	He must at least see the grave of his hope and [MASK]'s, and out of it resurrect new love and strength. Perhaps she, too, might be there, waiting, weeping. He started at the thought. He hurried forth sadly.
<name>audience</name>	audience	Alwyn	Larger and larger ones were projected, and more and more [MASK] was pushed to the front. He was developing into a most effective speaker. He had the voice, the presence, the ideas, and above all he was intensely in earnest.
<name>Macomber</name>	Macomber	Zora	Then she pressed on more swiftly, and fed more scantily, until finally, with the moonlight pouring over them at the black lagoon, [MASK] attempted to drive the animal into the still waters; but he gave a loud protesting snort and balked.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Elspeth	At last all was still. A long silence. Then again the air seemed suddenly filled with that great and awful cry; its echoing answer screamed afar and they heard the raucous voice of [MASK] beating in their ears: _"De seed done sowed!
<name>Archer</name>	Archer	Bles"--using	"Good-afternoon, [MASK] his first name to show him his place, and then inwardly recoiling at its note of familiarity. She preceded him up-stairs to the sitting-room, where, leaving the door ajar, she seated herself on the opposite side of the room and waited.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Zora	"They might go in there," she said, pointing to a door. [MASK] opened it. A tiny bedroom was disclosed, with one broad window looking toward the swamp; white curtains adorned it, and white hangings draped the plain bureau and wash-stand and the little bed.
<name>the Phantom</name>	the Phantom	Elspeth	Maybe she was riding the devil's horse, and these were the yawning gates of hell, black and sombre beneath the cold, dead radiance of the moon. She saw again the gnarled and black and claw-like fingers of [MASK] gripping and dragging her down.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Zora	The hour was halfway between midnight and dawn, but nevertheless the people leapt frenziedly to their feet. "Follow me!" he shouted. And, singing and chanting, the throng poured out upon the black highway, waving their torches. [MASK] knew his intention.
<name>Isadora</name>	Isadora	Zora	At the edge of the orgy stood [MASK], wild-eyed and bewildered, mad with the pain that gripped her heart and hammered in her head, crying in tune with the frenzied music--"the End--the End!" Abruptly she recognized a face despite the wreck and ruin of its beauty.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Zora	An old man led the band--tall, massive, with tufted gray hair and wrinkled leathery skin, and his eyes were the eyes of death. He reached the circle of light, and [MASK] started: once before she had seen that old man.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Zora	[MASK] looked back at him and the paramount mission of her life formed itself in her mind. She would protect this girl; she would protect all black girls. She would make it possible for these poor beasts of burden to be decent in their toil.
<name>Abigail</name>	Abigail	Todd	At any rate, the Educational Bill must be killed right off. No more talk; no more consideration--kill it, and kill it now. Now about this Child Labor Bill: [MASK]'s Civic Club is raising the mischief. Who's responsible?"
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Zora	And a troubled questioning trembled in her eyes, but brought no answering thought in his, for he was busy with his plans. "Then, you see, [MASK], if you stay here you'll need a new house, and you'll want to learn how to make it beautiful."
<name>She</name>	She	Zora	He bent to enter the door, and then uplifting himself and stretching his great arms, his palms touched the blackened rafters. [MASK] started forward. Thick memories of some forgotten past came piling in upon her. Where had she known him? What was he to her?
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Zora	"It was so beautiful," said [MASK]. "I expected a great thing of you--a sacrifice. I do not blame you because you could not do it; and yet--yet, after this,--don't you see?--I cannot stay here."
<name>He</name>	He	Bles	[MASK] did not know whether to feel relieved or provoked, or disappointed, and by way of compromise felt something of all three. The next morning he received notice of his appointment to a clerkship in the Treasury Department, at a salary of nine hundred dollars.
<name>boy</name>	boy	Cresswell	asked [MASK], carelessly, when the servant appeared. He was a young, light-brown boy, his manner obsequious. "Why, yes, sir--if you can spare me." "Spare you, you black rascal! You're going anyhow.
<name>Mother</name>	Mother	Zora	Outside there was much trampling and swearing. [MASK] did not move; the child slept on. A tugging and dragging, a dull blow that set the cabin quivering; then,-- "_Bang! Crack! Crash!_"--the door wavered, splintered, and dropped upon the floor.
<name>She</name>	She	Alwyn	Didn't you see her while she was here? She has gone back now." Then the gate opened, the crowd surged through, sweeping them apart, and next moment he was alone. [MASK] turned slowly away. He forgot the friend he was to meet.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Zora	The way where?" [MASK] sat up in bed, and lifted a gray and stricken face. "It's a lie," she cried, with hoarse earnedstness, "the way nowhere. There is no Way! You know--
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Mary	The obvious step, of course, would be to set him at work; but from this undertaking [MASK] unconsciously recoiled. She had already recognized that while her tastes and her husband's were mostly alike, they were also strikingly different in many respects.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Cresswell	Within a week the case was called, and they filed into the courtroom. [MASK]'s lawyer saw only this black woman--no other lawyer or sign of one appeared to represent her. The place soon filled with a lazy, tobacco-chewing throng of white men.
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Mary	Yes," she said crisply. "He's eighteen now--quite a man." "And most interesting to talk with." "H'm--very"--drily. [MASK] was busy with her own thoughts, and she did not notice the other woman's manner.
<name>Mr. Cunningham</name>	Mr. Cunningham	Taylor	"Bring in whites." "But I don't want poor white trash; I'd sooner have niggers." "Now, see here," argued [MASK], "you can't have everything you want--day's gone by for aristocracy of old kind.
<name>Bigger</name>	Bigger	Pshaw	The black boy, too, went his way in silent, burning rage. Why should he be elbowed into the roadside dust by an insolent bully? Why had he not stood his ground? [MASK]! All this fine frenzy was useless, and he knew it.
<name>Don</name>	Don	Alwyn	She had a hard task before her. [MASK]'s absurd conscience and Quixotic ideas were difficult to cope with. After his last indiscreet talk she had ventured deftly to remonstrate, and she well remembered the conversation. "Wasn't what I said true?"
<name>the sheriff</name>	the sheriff	Colton	In the morning he peered out as the cavalcade approached, and not knowing what had happened, he recognized [MASK], the sheriff, and signalled to him cautiously. In a moment a dozen men were on him, and he appealed and explained in vain--the gun was damning evidence.
<name>He</name>	He	Cresswell	Doesn't [MASK] know this?" "Of course. I think it's just a bluff. If he gets the appointment he'll let the bill drop." "I see--everybody is raising his price, is he? Pretty soon the darky will be holding us up.
<name>Chinonso</name>	Chinonso	Zora	He hastened toward the Cresswell mansion, and glanced anxiously up the road. At last he saw her coming, swinging down the road, lithe and dark, with the big white basket of clothes poised on her head. "[MASK]," he yodled, and she waved her apron.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Jason	"What?" she asked, puzzled. He pointed with one sweep of his long arm to the quivering mass of green-gold foliage that swept from swamp to horizon. "All yon golden fleece is [MASK]'s now," he repeated.
<name>Nastasya Filippovna</name>	Nastasya Filippovna	Zora	You are going to marry the man that sought [MASK]'s ruin when she was yet a child because you think of his aristocratic pose and pretensions built on the poverty, crime, and exploitation of six generations of serfs. You'll marry him and--"
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Zora	[MASK] sensed fully the situation. She did not anticipate any immediate understanding with the laboring whites, but she knew that eventually it would be inevitable. Meantime the Negro must strengthen himself and bring to the alliance as much independent economic strength as possible.
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Zora	"Where now, [MASK]?" he cried. In a moment she had slipped her hand away and was scrambling upon the tree trunk. The waters yawned murkily below. "Careful! careful!" he warned, struggling after her until she disappeared amid the leaves.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Zora	"If we only had a mule!" he sighed. Immediately her face lighted and her lips parted, but she said nothing. He presently bounded to his feet. "Never mind, [MASK]. To-morrow is Saturday, and I'll work all day.
<name>Elijah</name>	Elijah	Alwyn	"It is a long walk." [MASK] thought a while, silently. Then he rose. "I'm going," he said. "Good-bye." In less than a week the storehouse was full, and tenants were at work.
<name>John</name>	John	Bles	"But it shouldn't be so; everything ought to have a chance to be beautiful and useful." "Perhaps it ought to be so," admitted [MASK], "but it isn't." "Isn't it so--anywhere?"
<name>Beau</name>	Beau	Cresswells	The Colonel and his son drove to town and consulted the Judge; together they summoned the sheriff and the local member of the State legislature. "I think it's about time that we [MASK] asked for a little of the political pie," the Colonel smilingly opened.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Zora	Then with a puzzled look: "I wonder why?" "Perhaps because it's people and not things." "It's people in the swamp," asserted [MASK], dreamily, smoothing out the pillows of the couch, "'little people,' I call them.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Cresswell	[MASK] nodded. "I'll drive by and see," he said carelessly. The old man was discovered sitting before his cabin with his head in his hands. He was tall, black, and gaunt, partly bald, with tufted hair.
<name>He</name>	He	Taylor	"Well, did he intend so far as you know to sign such a paper?" "I do not know his intentions." "Did he say he meant to sign such a contract?" [MASK] hesitated. "Yes," he finally answered.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Harry	[MASK] lighted a cigarette. "We must drive them more. You're too easy, father; they understand that. By the way, what did that letter say about a 'sister'?" "Says he's got a sister over at the nigger school whom perhaps we know.
<name>Mr. Graff</name>	Mr. Graff	Taylor	[MASK] could not see any great danger. "Of course," he conceded, "they'll eventually get together; their interests are identical. I'll admit it's our game to delay this as long possible." "It must be delayed forever, sir."
<name>John</name>	John	Bles	[MASK] passed on. He was disappointed. He was full of things to say, of mighty matters to discuss; he felt like stopping these people and crying: "Ho! What of the morning? How goes the great battle for black men's rights?
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Cresswell	"Of course, you know how it is in the South," [MASK] pursued, the opening having been so easily accomplished. "I understand perfectly." "My sister would be delighted to meet you, but--" "Oh I realize the--difficulties."
<name>Mr. Bingley</name>	Mr. Bingley	Cresswell	"How about fighting for exercise?" she suggested. "At any rate," said [MASK], "we can all agree on helping these poor victims of our quarrel as far as their limited capacity will allow--and no farther, for that is impossible."
<name>Uncle Remus</name>	Uncle Remus	Colton	[MASK] eyed him suspiciously. "You'd let a nigger vote?" "Why, yes, if he had sense enough." "There ain't no nigger got sense." "Oh, pshaw!"
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Zora	And then she walked out. Above her sailed the same great stars; around her hummed the same hoarse city; but within her soul sang some new song of peace. "What is the matter, [MASK]?"
<name>his father</name>	his father	Tolliver	He thought he saw the beginning of the end of an institution which had been a thorn in his flesh ever since [MASK], in a fit of rage, had sold land for a Negro school. "H'm," he reflected deprecatingly, wiping his brow.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Zora	[MASK] softened. "Oh, I reckon He will if He's a good God, because He'd know that lies like that are heaps better than blabbing the truth right out. Only," she added severely, "you mustn't keep saying it's wicked to lie 'cause it ain't.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Zora	Yes." "And [MASK]?" "She is not there much now, she stays away." "But if she escapes, why not you?" "She wants to escape." "And you?" "I don't want to."
<name>Colton</name>	Colton	Colton	they'll get one they'll remember." "Now, see here, Colton,--nothing rash," the Colonel charged him, warningly. "Don't stir up needless trouble; but--well, things must change." [MASK] rose and shook his head.
<name>Undine</name>	Undine	Zora	[MASK], almost forgetting the wedding, stood before the mirror. Laying aside her dress, she draped her shimmering cloth about her, dragging her hair down in a heavy mass over ears and neck until she seemed herself a bride.
<name>driver</name>	driver	Madame	It was evidently a reporter, and the maid was admitting him. The news would reach the papers and be blazoned to-morrow. Slowly she caught her motor and fell wearily back on its cushions. "Where to, [MASK]?" asked the chauffeur.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Rob	And before nine next morning fully half the grown members of the same mob, now sworn in as deputies, rode with him to search the settlement. They tramped insolently through the school grounds, but there was no shred of evidence until they came to [MASK]'s cabin and found his gun.
<name>Lucius</name>	Lucius	Zora	He felt the coming of some great calamity, the end of a dream. This rain might stay for days; it looked like such a downpour; and that would mean the end of the Silver Fleece; the end of [MASK]'s hopes; the end of everything.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Zora	But she had not the slightest inclination to attempt it, and she said aloud, half mockingly: "You are right, [MASK]. I promised--and--I lied. Liars have no place in heaven and heaven is doubtless a beautiful place--
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Zora	[MASK] viewed her plight with a certain dismay--twelve hours without food! How foolish of her not to have thought of this. The hours passed. She turned desperately to the gruff conductor. "Could I buy a lunch from the dining-car?"
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Zora	"Git the ground--git the ground; dig it--pet it, and we'll see what we'll see." And she disappeared. [MASK] was not sure that it had been wise to tell their secret. "I was going to steal the seed," she said.
<name>Monty</name>	Monty	Bles	"But--but," objected [MASK], "if the time spent cajoling fools were used in convincing the honest and upright, think how much we would gain." "Very little. The honest and upright are a sad minority.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Zora	[MASK] was not meant for marrying; she was a born leader, wedded to a great cause; she had long outgrown the boy and girl affection. She was the sort of woman she herself might have been if she had not married.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Helen	[MASK] pursed her lips and petulantly tapped the floor with her foot. "But the other gown?" "Where is it?" asked the dressmaker, looking about. "It would make a pretty morning-dress--"
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Grandfather	"[MASK]," he repeated softly. He closed his eyes a space and then opened them. A tremor shivered in his limbs as he stared darkly at the swamp. "Hark!" he cried harshly. "Do you hear the bodies creaking on the limbs?
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Stillings	Also the bill reorganizing the school board had passed. She wrote two notes and posted them as she went out to walk. When she reached home [MASK] was there, and they talked earnestly. The bell rang violently.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Dolly	" "I don't care, I just must go. I'm clean out of anything to read. And I want to shop and call on [MASK]'s friend--she's going soon." "All right. Can you be ready by eleven?"
<name>Sister</name>	Sister	Zora	"No," said [MASK] as she noiselessly left the room and closed the door; "no, they are searching for something they have lost. Perhaps they, too, are searching for the Way," and the tears blinded her eyes.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Carrie	"Why?" "Because I am selfish and--small." "No, you are not. You want to be; but give it up, [MASK]; it isn't worth the cost. Come, let's be honest and poor--and free."
<name>Ma Joad</name>	Ma Joad	Zora	"We can do it." [MASK] had sat still, listening; but now, suddenly, she leapt to her feet. "Come," she said, "I'll take the clothes home, then we'll go"--she glanced at him--"down where the dreams are."
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Zora	[MASK] murmured some answer; but as she went to bed in her little white room she sat wondering sadly. Where was the poor spoiled woman? Who was putting her to bed and smoothing the pillow? Who was caring for her, and what was she doing?
<name>Lena</name>	Lena	Mary	There was a black man waltzing with a white woman--no, she was not white, for [MASK] caught the cream and curl of the girl as she swept past: but there was a white man (was he white?) and a black woman.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Mary	"Think of the servile black folk, the half awakened restless whites, the fat land waiting for the harvest, the masses panting to know--why, the battle is scarcely even begun." "Yes, I guess that's so," [MASK] began to comprehend.
<name>Dinah</name>	Dinah	Zora	Yes, sir, grown on my place, by my niggers, sir!" he assured them; and they marvelled. To [MASK]'s mind, this beautiful baled fibre was hers; it typified happiness; it was an holy thing which profane hands had stolen.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Taylor	"How do you mean?" "Let 'em vote." "But they'd have to read and write." "Sure!" "Well, then," said [MASK], "it might be a good thing."
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Cresswell	[MASK] frowned. "It's probably whiskey," he assured his companion, in an undertone; then to the man: "You must get to the field to-morrow,"--his habitually calm, unfeeling positiveness left no ground for objection; "I cannot support you in idleness, you know."
<name>their name</name> (Cannot be determined without additional context or information)	their name (Cannot be determined without additional context or information)	Bles	Today seemed doubly glorious, for [MASK] had spoken of their marriage; with twined hands and arms, and lips ever and again seeking their mates, they walked the leafy way. Unconscious, rapt, they stepped out into the Big Road skirting the edge of the swamp.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Zora	"What is your plan?" asked [MASK]. "To put the money in a Northern savings bank at three per cent interest; to supply the rest of the interest, and the deficit in the running expenses, from our balance, and to send you North to beg."
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Zora	For a moment [MASK] paused, and her nostrils quivered; then without a word she slipped down-stairs, glided into the swamp, and sped away to the island. She swung across the tree and a low, delighted cry bubbled on her lips.
<name>Esmeralda</name>	Esmeralda	Zora	Her heavy hair had burst its fastenings and lay in stiffened, straggling masses, bending reluctantly to the breeze, like curled smoke; while all about, the mad, wild singing rose and fell and trembled, till his head whirled. He paused uncertainly at a parting of the paths, crying: "[MASK]!
<name>She</name>	She	Zora	They went up the path together and parted diffidently, he watching her flit away with sorrowful eyes, a little disturbed and puzzled at the burden he had voluntarily assumed, but never dreaming of drawing back. [MASK] did not go far.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Zora	In other ways, too, [MASK], when he met her, was to him a new creature. She came to him frankly and greeted him, her gladness shining in her eyes, yet looking nothing more than gladness and saying nothing more.
<name>women</name>	women	Taylor	In most matters of commerce between men he was punctilious to a degree almost annoying to [MASK]. But there was one part of the world which his code of honor did not cover, and he saw no incongruity in the omission.
<name>man</name>	man	Alwyn	The sun was setting. The women and children hurried into the school building, closing the doors and windows. A moment [MASK] stood without and looked back. The world was peaceful. He could hear the whistle of birds and the sobbing of the breeze in the shadowing oaks.
<name>Uncertain</name>	Uncertain	Bles	Well, she had done her duty, and slowly she nestled back and watched the far-off green and golden radiance of the cotton. "[MASK]," she said impulsively, "shall I tell you of the Golden Fleece?" He glanced at her again.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Taylor	No, I mean run the school to suit their ideas.... No, no, but in general along the lines which they could approve.... Yes, I thought so ... of course ... good-bye." "Inclined to be a little nasty?" asked [MASK].
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Cresswell	[MASK] watched him uncomfortably as he rode away, and again a feeling of doubt stirred within him. What new force was he loosening against his black folk--his own black folk, who had lived about him and his fathers nigh three hundred years?
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Zora	She laid the pin on the desk and on sudden impulse spoke again to the girl as she arranged her neck trimmings. "[MASK]," she said evenly, "why didn't you come to class when I called?"
<name>Sally</name>	Sally	Elspeth	Negroes would steal, everybody said. Well, she must and would have the pin, and she started for [MASK]'s cabin. On the way she met the old woman in the path, but got little satisfaction.
<name>George</name>	George	Bles	She pushed her bonnet back: how good and cool the water felt! But on [MASK] as he raised the buggy top it felt hot and fiery. He felt the coming of some great calamity, the end of a dream.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Zora	The whip was whirring in the air again; but it never fell. A jagged stone in the boy's hand struck true, and the overseer plunged with a grunt into the black furrow. In blank dismay, [MASK] came back to her senses. "Poor child!"
