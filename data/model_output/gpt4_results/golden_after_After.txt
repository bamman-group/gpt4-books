<name>Olivia</name>	Olivia	Bunny	I stopped him because he was speeding and driving with no headlights.” “And you killed him?” [MASK] whispers, rising so quickly she nearly falls, clutching the collar of her robe tight at her throat and covering her mouth with her hand.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Eric	Often a group of officers on the same shift met in the parking lot before the shift began, to decide where to have dinner together. [MASK] had a different kind of conversation during those dinners. He wanted to talk about more than wives and children, who beat the Wizards, or gossip about other cops.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Bunny	[MASK]’s hazel eyes, now gazing at him, were a crystal ball in which he could see the real meaning of those relationships, how he had been just marking time. Stalling. Waiting for this. Waiting for her. “Are you ever afraid on your job?”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Paul	Not at first, anyway. It was the headache, she told herself as she embraced [MASK], her hands wet, her body arched backward to give herself up and over to his height. It was a headache that made her feel so odd, so uneasy.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Carson	To prove in some way that it matters to me that I managed to overcome what happened. That I didn’t really lose everything. I don’t want twelve years to be a waste.” “Twelve years is a long time, [MASK], but not that long.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Eric	Don’t you think I see it?” she shouted. Leaning back in his seat, he told her firmly, “I can figure this out by myself. I just need some time.” “Like you figured it out after [MASK] died?”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Bunny	Last night [MASK] told him she was pregnant. “It’ll mean starting over again. Are you ready for that?” she asked. “I can’t say no to a child of mine.” “I don’t know how this happened.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Bunny	“Even while I was pulling the trigger, [MASK], I was praying it was a dream. And when I saw what I had done I prayed that he was asleep, or maybe that I was. That if he didn’t wake up, then I would.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Bunny	“I’ll think about it, [MASK], that’s all I can say,” he mumbled, rolling over, responding to her plea with the sight of his back. How could he seek counseling for post-traumatic stress disorder?
<name>Jerome</name>	Jerome	Carson	[MASK] had signed on in the aftermath of a discrimination suit filed by a group of Black officers. He joined the force despite its reputation for brutality against Blacks, racism, and a scandal in which a group of rogue cops called the Death Squad had turned into vigilantes, meting out their own brand of justice.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Natalie	You could have caused a miscarriage. Is that what you wanted?” [MASK] demanded, furious that the son she had raised to honor and respect women had shoved the woman carrying his child. “No.” “Well, what, then?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Carson	“I drove around. Then I needed a drink. In fact, I needed a lot of drinks. So I could stand to look at myself in the mirror.” “I’m not gonna let you go back into that dark place, [MASK].
<name>Ted</name>	Ted	Carson	When [MASK] scanned the interior of the car he saw five women, all in their early twenties. The car vibrated with nervous giggling and reeked of perfume, cigarettes, chewing gum, and marijuana. The sight of so many young women jolted and excited him.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Carson	[MASK] cruised back into the quiet, dark cul-de-sac where his house sat. For a while he sat in the car, looking at the house, grateful that it belonged to him. That what he wanted he actually had.
<name>Tris</name>	Tris	Bunny	“A long time.” [MASK] folds her arms across her chest and crosses her legs, turning her body into a wall of resistance. “Everything that’s happened gives you, gives us, a chance to look at our choices, our past.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Carson	“Sit down,” he said, extending his arm, pointing with his missing fingertip to a chair across from him. [MASK] didn’t move, wondering, What kind of trick is this? I don’t have to do what you say.
<name>Grady</name>	Grady	Carson	He’s held forth in their midst about crime in the county and what it takes to do his job. [MASK] is sure that some of them, the ones who’ve seen his name in the newspaper or the twenty-second report on TV, feel he should be arrested.
<name>Hope</name>	Hope	Paul	Always, it seemed, [MASK] was most real in their dreams for him. Dreams that encompassed all the good they could imagine and some that they could not even name. A child is a whispered prophecy. Hope is the middle name of every child ever born.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Bunny	“And it’s a career we’ve all paid a high price for.” “I thought you wanted me to be in a good mood?” He attempts to laugh off [MASK]’s inquisition. “How long have you been thinking about this?”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Blake	“I don’t know. It’s like the man I shot is a phantom, or a ghost. I want to know who he was, who his parents are.” “That’s spooky shit, [MASK].”
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Alan	[MASK] would solve seemingly inscrutable algebra problems on the board in front of the class and then pimp-walk back to his seat and slouch his gangly frame in its confines as though what he’d just done had no significance at all.
<name>Brad</name>	Brad	Shirley	At four-thirty, while tossing out old files, she feels the prickly stab of hunger and pauses to envision the sumptuous architectural culinary creations she and [MASK] will be sharing over dinner at the Cheesecake Factory at six o’clock.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Carson	“You deserve a new one, [MASK]. I always thought somebody would shoot you. That’s the nightmare I’ve lived with for twelve years. And you know what? This feels almost as bad. What would you go back to? What would you go back for?
<name>Lila</name>	Lila	Bunny	He knew everything about [MASK]. She had no secrets. The abortion at nineteen. How she loves her dad more than she loves her mother, and the guilt and bewilderment this causes. The cousin who fondled her when she was nine.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Bunny	In real life we get put on leave that can last days, weeks, sometimes as long as a year.” “What do you like about it?” [MASK] asked each question with no hesitation, cradling her chin in her palm.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Eli	[MASK] lived in a boardinghouse across the street from my mother. Oh, it was a scandal. But I didn’t care. You know, your father would wash my hair? He’d touch me even when we weren’t behind closed doors.
<name>Grady</name>	Grady	Proctor	Been disciplined for excessive force in three of those cases. Most cops never fire their weapons. Ever. [MASK] can’t stop unloading his. His pale skin is chalky white, a plaster cast shattering at the seams.
<name>Sofia</name>	Sofia	Bunny	But he forgave her for that. “I wanted to make sure that you got home all right.” “I did.” [MASK] crossed her legs. Her olive-toned skin was burnished by a slight tan. A mole lay just above her lip.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Frey	He gave me some lip, but he wasn’t at all what I was expecting. I was afraid for my life. I thought he had a gun.” [MASK] listened, knowing that memory is fractured and heightened, made suspect by the lingering effects of trauma.
<name>Ron</name>	Ron	Frey	“I . . . I’ve thought about that a lot, in fact,” he says, “and I think”—he feels [MASK] beside him, shifting anxiously. “I had been following him for a while, and . .
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Carson	“Hey, what are you doing here?” she asked, looking at her watch. “It’s a slow night.” “But what if . . . ?” [MASK] put his fingers to his lips and whispered, “Our secret.”
<name>Marshal</name>	Marshal	Carson	‘Don’t you think a man or woman’s got a right to defend themselves, [MASK]?’ he asked me. “He damn near gave a sermon, telling me that whoever was robbing those people wasn’t just stealing money but their peace of mind.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Carson	These are the last kids on earth he wants to direct him to the cafeteria, but the main office is at the other end of the hall, a hike he figures is unnecessary. [MASK] quickens his stride, walking faster to catch the boys.
<name>Jerome</name>	Jerome	Carson	Then two men from the crowd jumped in, wrestled the guy off [MASK] just as two police cruisers arrived. The lights and the sirens, loud, disorienting, scattered the crowd. And that wasn’t the only ass-whooping he’d gotten.
<name>Rearden</name>	Rearden	Natalie	The sum seemed paltry to [MASK]. “What would be likely?” “I have had judgments in similar cases in the range of eight hundred thousand to three million dollars.” “Those figures are an insult.
<name>whoever</name>	whoever	Carson	The relaxed, easygoing banter curdled into a wary hesitance that left the man or woman [MASK] was talking to bereft of speech, except to ask in a hushed whisper, “You’re a police? For real?”
<name>him</name>	him	Carson	They pause to watch him driving out of the complex, their gaze on [MASK], unflinching and inscrutable. It wouldn’t surprise him at all if in a couple of years he was selling houses to them. A good day.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alma	“No. No I don’t,” she insisted. “Did you ever forgive him?” “If I hadn’t he never would’ve laid eyes on you.” [MASK] thought she had given her son a gift.
<name>Althea</name>	Althea	Temple	The silence was a respite from [MASK]’s anger and the pressing need to respond to it. Over time, the days she spent walking the grounds, huddled in the monastery library reading, picking a book at random from the library shelf, tamping down her energies, fear, and anger, overhauled her soul.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Carson	“Hi,” [MASK] said softly. “Hi.” “I know this is unexpected, but . . .” “Come on, let’s go outside.” “Outside?” her mother asked.
<name>Grady</name>	Grady	Carson	You never know. So every night’s a war. That’s why you take control from the start. Let them know who’s in charge. Every complaint against [MASK] (and there had been half a dozen) had been investigated. Every time he was cleared.
<name>Oswald</name>	Oswald	Carson	She feels the fear even as she imagines her own version of the chilling, unalterable moment and what [MASK] must have felt, and she wonders what the man he killed thought, watching the bullets turn him into a target.
<name>Ms. Thompson</name>	Ms. Thompson	Natalie	“Sorry to disappoint you and everybody else, but I spent more time reaching for books off the library shelf than dunkin’,” he said apologetically. The young man has inspired a maternal affection in [MASK] that, now that he’s a senior, haunts her with fears of losing him.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Carson	This is between him and me.” Your man. [MASK] liked the sound of that. “Honestly, I didn’t have a plan. I was just hoping she’d give me a break and maybe a chance.” “Looks like she did.
<name>him</name>	him	Carson	Her olive-toned skin was burnished by a slight tan. A mole lay just above her lip. She said nothing about how he had just shown up at her door; she just sat beside [MASK] as if they already knew everything of importance about each other.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Carson	By the time the car has stopped and he’s parked behind him, [MASK]’s skin is tingling and he’s tense, buoyed by the involuntary adrenaline rush that’s an invisible body armor, priming him for action.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Paul	He’s SO VKUch like [MASK]. How many times has she thought this about some young man who reminds her of her son at his best—ambitious, certain he could take on the world, be anything, do anything?
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Bunny	She bandages the finger as the tears dammed up behind her eyes all morning, the pressure from which has given her a headache, finally begin to flow. Utterly exhausted, [MASK] covers the leg oflamb in plastic wrap and places it in the refrigerator. She wants to cry.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Carson	He has made that promise, and now, sitting on the side of the bed at eleven o’clock, [MASK] wonders if maybe what happened was a nightmare. He can’t shed this hope, even as it’s contradicted by the brooding malaise and queasiness festering inside him.
<name>Virgil</name>	Virgil	Carson	“It happened so fast.” And that is the truest thing [MASK] has thought or said this night. “It happened so fast. I killed a man. I stopped him because he was speeding and driving with no headlights.” “And you killed him?”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Carson	Driving to the parking lot of a warehouse-size liquor supermarket that was a magnet for troublemakers and rowdies, [MASK] had a blast of adrenaline pumping, pushing through his veins, making him feel crazy/invincible and, yeah, still scared.
<name>She</name>	She	Natalie	He picks up the remote and turns on the television. She looks at his profile, his receding hairline and bushy brows, his lips pursed and angry, the only sign he allows as a hint of what he must feel. [MASK] rests her hand on the sleeve of his pajamas.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Bunny	“I was sure he’d give in at the last minute,” he says to [MASK], his words soft and humble, a gentle attempt to prod her out of the silence she has maintained since they left the house. “Why would you think that?
<name>She</name>	She	Bunny	There have been other times in his twelve years on the force when he was hours late because of a fatal accident. Sometimes he had a chance to call. Sometimes he didn’t. [MASK] knew this was part of The Job. Shit happened.
<name>She</name>	She	Bunny	It is a flat, wide, square face. His complexion is a shade, just a whisper, darker than hers. But she doesn’t fall for the face. It’s never the looks with her. It’s a man’s energy. And that night [MASK] feels it.
<name>Ramsay</name>	Ramsay	Carson	She submits when [MASK] frees himself from her embrace only to push her beneath him, his tongue hungering for hers, his hands roughly shoving her gown above her thighs, his sex a shattering blow inside her. And when he is done, he still clings to her.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Carson	The cousin who fondled her when she was nine. [MASK] accepted everything, every secret, like a tithe or a tribute. But there were the evenings when he came in from the streets and he didn’t shower and he’d lie down beside his wife.
<name>Yvette</name>	Yvette	Carson	“I pay my taxes, my bills, and I paid child support.” He was telling [MASK] that he was no statistic. No deadbeat dad. No trifling Black man who dropped his seed and didn’t stick around to watch it grow.
<name>he</name>	he	Carson	As it slowly rises, as [MASK] backs slowly up the sloping driveway, through the rearview mirror he sees a figure crouched over a pile of objects on the garage floor and the flickering of a sputtering flame. “What the hell is he doing?”
<name>Mrs. Johnson</name>	Mrs. Johnson	Temple	“What happened? What happened?” [MASK] asked. “We can only tell you that your son is at the County Hospital and we’ve been told to take you there, one of the men said.” “Is he alive?”
<name>Jackson</name>	Jackson	Eddie	He laughed and shook his head at the memory. Then, with a knowing smirk that occupied not just his face but his whole body, he asked, “What was your plan? Arrest her if she didn’t go out with you?” [MASK] turned on a megawatt smile.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Carson	His eyes are lit as they often are now by a resilient, starry glint that she has seen in cancer survivors, who, having danced with the angel of death and refused the summons, look upon life with a transformed gaze. “Why are you doing this now, [MASK]?
<name>Tyrone</name>	Tyrone	Proctor	“This ain’t no rap video, you stupid ass,” [MASK] yelled as he began kicking the kid in the head, the ribs, the groin, the back, his thick muscular arms outstretched, as if he were performing a dance movement, with each kick.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Carson	The quick, small movement chills the night and freezes [MASK]’s blood. “Put your hands up,” he shouts, a surging infusion of fear flooding his insides, as liquid and warm as blood. He’s no longer a pretty boy but a looming threat.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Juwan	“[MASK], tell me—you don’t have to protect me. I’m supposed to protect you.” “Dreams about you going to jail for what you did.” The admission occupies the car, heavy and stifling.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Carson	In ninety days, [MASK] was convinced, you discovered everything you needed to know about a woman. In ninety days you usually discovered why you’d stay. Or what would one day make you say good-bye.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Carson	Right now, [MASK], the next best person after me for you to talk to is a mental health professional.” “I don’t need that now. I need to know I won’t go to prison for this. Can you tell me that?”
<name>Everything</name>	Everything	Carson	“And I mean everything, from the rooms in the gallery, to posters, the brochures, maps, napkins in the cafeteria. [MASK], everything you touch, from a bar of soap to toothpaste, has been designed. Nothing in the world that we live in is random.
<name>backup</name>	backup	Jordan	“Why did you approach with your weapon drawn?” “Because I thought he was eluding me and I wasn’t sure what I would find.” Since I hadn’t waited for [MASK], I needed my gun. “And because you didn’t wait for backup?”
<name>Rodriguez</name>	Rodriguez	Carson	There was a crowd, but they were just watching the two men go at it. A big burly Incredible Hulk mutha and a wiry short guy, bloody but unstoppable. [MASK] radioed for backup. But he didn’t wait. He couldn’t wait.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Paul	But she wasn’t allowed to pull back the sheet. The trauma nurse pulled her arms away from [MASK]’s body, saying, “This is a coroner’s case now. Everything in this room, including your son’s body, is evidence we can’t tamper with.”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Juwan	But since he’s here, it would be nice to see him. Car-son checks his watch and sees it’s a quarter to twelve. [MASK] told him he has his lunch around this time. Maybe he’ll check the cafeteria, ask one of the kids where it is.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jimmy	But I was determined to find a way to bloom. I started hating everything about [MASK], everything that I had once respected. His steadiness, his job, this house that he wanted to buy for us to raise a family in.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Juwan	They drive the two miles to the Beltway in silence, [MASK] huddling protectively against the car door, sulking and morose. “I know I’m hard on you. But that’s the way dads are. Mine was a bulldog. But he cared.”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Carson	The waiting, and the watching, mosdy the watching her, had given [MASK] a sense that she was no stranger, had never been, could never be. He couldn’t read her emotions on the phone. She was calm. Said nothing about his letter or hers.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Bunny	“Just give me a few days, a week, to think about it.” [MASK] opened the door and slid out of the car, then took a last look at him, saying, “You’ve run out of time.”
<name>Yvonne</name>	Yvonne	Bunny	“I wouldn’t have . . .” “Stop lying,” she screamed, moving even farther away from him. “I could’ve woke up a widow. My children, orphans.” “[MASK], I just feel . . .”
<name>He</name>	He	Carson	In the seconds of this hallucination he imagines himself on his knees before this face, not begging this time but with hands stretched wide open and revealed. [MASK] issues a hoarse, guttural, heaving sigh, a cleansing, terrible ache that he has borne, he feels, all his life.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Bunny	All I’m saying is, I will.” Now he is entrusted with [MASK]. Entrusted with his children. He has done more than let them down. He has revealed why he did not deserve them in the first place.
<name>Chandler</name>	Chandler	Carson	Anything you say can and will be used against you. [MASK] is now a cop who has been Mirandized. He signs the form. “Don’t people know when you say ‘Drop what you’re holding,’ we mean drop what you’re holding?”
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Matthew	I didn’t plan what’s happening.” “Do you know what you’re doing?” he asks in exasperation. “Not really. For the first time since this happened, [MASK], I don’t care. I don’t wanna save my ass.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Shirley	“What’s this?” “Just read it.” [MASK] gasps as she quickly scans the letter, then takes a sip from her glass of wine and reads the letter again more slowly. “Well, I’ll be damned.
<name>Sandy</name>	Sandy	Bunny	The car vibrated with nervous giggling and reeked of perfume, cigarettes, chewing gum, and marijuana. The sight of so many young women jolted and excited him. [MASK] was behind the wheel. His flashlight illuminated her face, and he liked what he saw.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Carson	[MASK] learned soon that many cops felt deeply the effects of the accumulation of misery and the unfathomable—like why a father would throw his three-year-old from a twelve-story window to make her stop crying.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Doris	“You know that’s not true.” “It’s how I feel, whether you want me to feel that way or not,” [MASK] says, leaning against the counter as she waits for the water to boil.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Temple	“If you two didn’t live in the same world, you wouldn’t have come this far.” “I’ve ktlOWfl you had something to tell me for a while now.” That’s all [MASK] says after reading the letter and letting it fall onto the bed between them.
<name>Emmanuel</name>	Emmanuel	Jimmy	Six, seven months. It doesn’t take long for a storm to rise and drench and soak you and set you shivering. In six, seven months I met your father and left [MASK], went to live with my mother.
<name>He</name>	He	Eli	But those things, those little things, they save a woman’s life. I’d walked away from my husband and I hadn’t looked back. [MASK] was working construction, making good money, but he didn’t want to work for anybody, wanted to work for himself.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Carson	But [MASK] now knows that if he sneaked into the homes of the people he’s sold property to, he’d find illegal drugs, stolen property. If he were psychic, he’d read their minds and find them raging with criminal thought, malicious intent.
<name>Quiller</name>	Quiller	Carson	Once or twice before she has felt this sexual/psychological voltage pass between her and a man, but never like this. Never like this. When they marry of course she wants to know, and she does not want to know, everything about what [MASK] calls The Job.
<name>She</name>	She	Olivia	Hell, I didn’t even think we would last. But we did,” he said wistfully. “I didn’t even know what I wanted or who I was when we got together. [MASK] made it possible for me to be my best self.
<name>he</name>	he	Carson	Back in the hold of stained-glass windows that never felt like they offered shelter or mercy. The mottled windows of every church [MASK] ever attended struck him as a kind of spiritual graffiti. The service that day, long, fervent, passionate, rekindled in him memories of his past church-attending days.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Eric	You oughta join us.” “You all just pray for me, okay?” Then [MASK] was gone. Three years ago. He stopped to help a woman on the side of 495 change a flat tire. It was 10:15 p.m., during a heavy rain.
<name>Victoria</name>	Victoria	Carson	[MASK] stands beneath the three-tiered crystal chandelier in the formal dining room and reaches for the light switch, which floods the room in an ostentatious yet entirely serene display of warmth and radiance. The light is playfully brilliant and as confident as an edict from heaven.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Jordan	He’s got no respect for cops who let their lives become a public mess. He knows [MASK] from a distance, and he’s fine with that. But hell, he can shoot the breeze for a minute.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Proctor	He sets the beers on the table and slides into the booth. “You look like you held up okay,” [MASK] says. “Yeah, well, looks can be deceiving.” “You know, I been on my share of administrative leaves.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Juwan	The bookcase he had planned to make for [MASK] was going to be a simple shelf, but over the weeks of work the cher-rywood called out for union with the fragrant scent and tones of juniper wood and demanded a small drawer and high sides.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Carson	I know I was wrong.” “The club’ll be there,” [MASK] scolded her gently. To scare her he asked for her license and walked slowly back to his cruiser, where he called in to headquarters over the mike and asked for a check on her.
<name>Frannie</name>	Frannie	Carson	[MASK], husbands and wives are supposed to sleep together.” “I know,” he said, touching her upper arm, a triangle of flesh exposed despite the fact that she was bundled up in the spread. “I know, but there are times.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Bunny	Mail it first and then tell [MASK]. Another breach of trust, faith, love—that’s how she will see it, he’s sure. But if he doesn’t mail it first, he fears he never will.
