<name>Men</name>	Men	Babies	[MASK] were so much not a part of her life that she never even thought about them, or she hadn’t, until that morning. “Are you happy, sweetheart?” Or scared? Or mad? What did one feel? What was it like?
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Pilar	[MASK] called her mother on Christmas Day, and the temptation to tell her about the baby was great, but somehow she managed to resist it. And she also knew that half of her desire to tell her was to prove her wrong, and let her know that she was not too old to have children.
<name>Jennifer</name>	Jennifer	Pilar	But there are other areas of her life that might even make her a worthwhile human being.” “You sound like my shrink,” [MASK] said in disgust, and then she kissed him. But at least she had told her mother the news.
<name>Rose</name>	Rose	Grace	And then she looked down at him, he was so perfect and so small, and yet so round and healthy. He was everything [MASK] hadn’t been, with her tiny features and miniature face. She had looked perfect, too, but infinitely smaller.
<name>her</name>	her	Christian	The doctor ran a few simple tests on her, and called her at the office to tell her that she was anemic, probably still from her delivery. He prescribed some iron pills for her, which made [MASK] complain about her milk, so she stopped taking them and forgot it.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Judi	In fact, he felt as though he liad aged ever since he’d been told he was sterile. She had been sleeping on the couch in the living room, and she didn’t want the others to hear them in the kitchen, so they went into [MASK]’s bedroom.
<name>Sharon</name>	Sharon	Nancy	But he was glad that [MASK] had come to her senses so quickly. “Now all you have to do is relax, and have the baby.” It seemed like an endless eight months to wait till August.
<name>Therese</name>	Therese	Pilar	But the sheer stupidity of it was that she had known for years that she wouldn’t. Therapy had taught her that long since. Her mother was who she was, and she was not going to change. It was [MASK] who had to change her expectations.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Diana	[MASK] felt for an instant as though it was almost too perfect, as she stood and looked at him, just before she went to change out of her wedding gown. She hated to take it off, never to wear it again, to turn the reality into a memory.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Jane	They each dressed in the tiny bathroom, and then they followed [MASK] down the hall at a dead run, while she was pushed on the gurney to the delivery room. They put her quickly on the table, draped her, and put her legs in stirrups, and then covered her legs in blue paper.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Bradford	. would she regret not having children when she was old? . . . and what about when [MASK] died, God forbid, but what if he did and she had nothing left of him, except her memories and another woman’s children?
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Gayle	[MASK] kept up a constant stream of conversation with him, as she always did, about nothing in particular; the PTA, complaining about how little money doctors made today, and making veiled references to why they never had children.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Sam	She excused herself then and went upstairs, and a few minutes later she came back, and said nothing. It was after dessert that she said to [MASK] that she wasn’t feeling so great and she was going upstairs to lie down, but not to tell anyone.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Brad	She didn’t want anyone to live a life like hers, and she had no idea how to bring a child up herself. She had had no example in her own childhood. In fact, it had amazed her when she first saw [MASK] with his children.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Gracie	It was half happy and half sad, half agony and half beauty, everything was so bittersweet and so tender to the touch. She couldn’t bear feeling anymore, and she stood looking at him for a long time, thinking how much she already loved him. But she had loved [MASK] too . . .
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Pilar	[MASK] always remembered what she’d said to them, that there were no guarantees to anything, and that sometimes fertility as well as infertility could be a mixed blessing. It had been for them, but in the past few months, the scale had been heavily weighted on the good side.
<name>She</name>	She	Diana	He showed her what he felt, and when he squeezed it, [MASK] felt an odd cramping sensation. “Does that hurt?” he asked. “Yeah,” she said, staring at the wall. They had no right to do this to her.
<name>Stacey</name>	Stacey	Judi	“What kind of friend?” “Her old roommate, [MASK]. They went back to see some old pals. They used to live there.” “You let her go alone?” “I told you . . .
<name>Tina</name>	Tina	Di	And when he came back, she looked up at him unhappily. She had made up her mind. It was worth it, just for the information. “Okay. I’ll do it.” “You’re a brave girl, [MASK].”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Brad	But you just have to go on, day after day, moment after moment ... for [MASK]’s sake, for your own ... for your little boy. . . . You have to go on, and the pain will fade eventually.
<name>George</name>	George	Jack	“She says she’s sick to her stomach,” he said to [MASK] quietly. “She threw up a few times, and now she says she has terrible cramps. I thought I should take her home, but she doesn’t want to move.
<name>John</name>	John	Charlie	Even biologically related children can add enormous pressure to a marriage. You and your wife should talk about all your options. We can provide counseling to help you find what’s right for both of you,” he said gently. Great. [MASK] sat staring dumbly out the window.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Pilar	“Not all your patients have mothers over forty, do they? Some of them must have had young mothers.” “That’s true. But you can’t force nature’s hand, [MASK]. You pay a terrible price when you do that.”
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Diana	But when he did, [MASK] wasn’t as sure. She had heard nasty things about that test from women in her office. They said it was painful, and one of them had been allergic to the dye solution they’d used and had a frightening reaction.
<name>Jennifer</name>	Jennifer	Pilar	[MASK]’s progesterone levels were very high, and that would certainly help her get pregnant. It was a long, peaceful drive home, and they felt even closer to each other after the past few days. And it was a quiet week for them before Thanksgiving.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Andy	“You’re terrific,” [MASK] whispered as he kissed her. “So are you.” She kissed him back, the agony forgotten, the emptiness, the sorrow. And yet she knew that all of it had made this moment infinitely more precious. CHAPTER
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Brad	And before she knew it, she was head over heels in love with him and he with her, and they had no idea what to do about his children. “Never mind your children, what about my work? I can’t take cases against you anymore, [MASK].
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Andy	She called [MASK] from the store, but he was out to lunch, and eventually she went home, and decided to make him a really fancy dinner. He called her at three o’clock, and he could hear the lighter tone in her voice when she answered.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Alice	“I know. But sometimes people do crazy stulf when they’re desperate to have kids.” “Tell me about it.” [MASK] sat back in the chair and groaned. “For two years I took hormones that I thought were going to kill me.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Nancy	“Not in the last two hours. I was beginning to worry.” They stayed out on the terrace after she cleared their plates away, and he talked about how nervous he had been when [MASK] was born.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Pattengill	She was out with friends, going shopping, and she even said she had an audition the day after Christmas. He didn’t question her this time. He didn’t say anything. He had to see [MASK] first. That was all he wanted.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Andy	The house seemed too large for them now. There were too many rooms they didn’t use, a whole floor of bedrooms they might never have any use for. “We can’t let that happen, sweetheart,” [MASK] insisted valiantly.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Diana	All their passion, all their promises, seemed to come together in a single moment of abandon, and [MASK] lay clinging to him as though she would never let him go, not for a moment or a lifetime. Their ecstasy rose, and they shuddered with pleasure, and then lay peacefully in each other
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Charlie	She looked surprised and pleased and her mother nodded, looking happy too. She was pretty and young, and she hadn’t had room for a man in her life for a long time. But seeing [MASK] suddenly made her feel different. “Wow!
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Christian	“I hope so,” she said softly, looking down at him, and trying to forget the little face she would never see again . . . the baby she would always remember. CHAPTER = 20 = [MASK] cried lustily the day they left the hospital and took him home.
<name>She</name>	She	Diana	There were tears sliding down her cheeks as she dressed the little girl in a pink dress, and a warm pink sacque, and little pink knit booties. She had a matching hat with little pink roses on it, and she looked adorable when [MASK] picked her up and held her.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Andy	She was right. It was turning their life to shit. And the strain was telling on both of them. “Yeah,” she said sadly, “maybe it’s raisins.” But [MASK] didn’t smile at her this time, he just couldn’t.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Charlie	“Nothing much . . . what a good dinner it was. . . .” She smiled at him through a haze of smoke. “You’re always so good to me, [MASK].” But that didn’t seem to be enough, he could sense it.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Eloise	She’d called both her sisters and her mother. She’d have her father over as soon as he got back from his trip. “I can’t think of who.” Maybe [MASK], but they really weren’t all that close now.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Nancy	He kissed her again, and they got up and went to make breakfast. They sat on their terrace afterward in shorts and T-shirts. It was a beautiful December day, and their baby was due in August. “Wait till [MASK] hears.”
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Diana	She had barely made it to the hospital for her first two, and he had delivered her last one in their kitchen. “Everyone’s different,” he reminded her, and [MASK] had certainly proved that by seeming to be sterile, and taking two years to get pregnant.
<name>Dr. Kaplan</name>	Dr. Kaplan	Pattengill	He looked terrified and young, almost too young to be one of [MASK]’s patients. He was a urologist, with a specialization in reproductive disorders. “What can I do for you today?” “I’m not sure.”
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Charlie	I’m sure he’d be real excited about this one.” “I don’t know what to say.” [MASK] felt as though his whole life had been turned inside out, and it had. He could barely think, let alone make important decisions.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Barbie	The idea cheered him no end, as they finished dressing and went out. And not knowing how intent he was on his plan, [MASK] was in excellent spirits, and figured maybe he’d decided to be reasonable and forget his ideas about a family for a while.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Andy	“I love you very much ... I always will . . . but that doesn’t mean I have the right to keep you. ... I can’t give you anything, [MASK] . . . except myself, and there’s not much left now.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Charlie	According to the books he’d read on the subject, and there had been quite a few lately, they were making love at exactly the right time every month to produce a baby. But after four months of intense attention to his plan, absolutely nothing had happened. And [MASK] was beginning to get worried.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Eloise	She just wanted to go to bed and relax, and she was praying that this month she might have gotten pregnant. Nothing seemed to matter anymore except that. Even her job was less important to her now. But at least now she could talk to [MASK].
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jack	[MASK] had cleaned her up by then, and he cut the cord with the instruments the paramedics had brought, and a moment later she and the baby were well wrapped up on a stretcher and on their way out the door to the ambulance, with everyone running beside them and wishing them well.
<name>Janet</name>	Janet	Pilar	“Maybe she thinks I’m competing with her,” [MASK] mused as they cleared the table and stacked the dishes in the sink, to leave them for their cleaning woman the next morning. “Maybe. But it’s time she learned the world doesn’t turn around her.
<name>She</name>	She	Pilar	Perhaps it was as simple as that, perhaps she was destined to be with them only for a moment. But suddenly [MASK] realized that she had to let her go, that she had to touch her memory now and then, but she could not take her with her.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Andy	She was wearing her new ring, and on the way to the gallery, [MASK] teased her about taking another trip so he could use his new luggage. It had been an easy day, and they had spent the afternoon in bed, making love, before they dressed for dinner.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Pilar	But by now, [MASK] expected nothing from her. She had given her mother the news. And how she dealt with it was up to her now. “They warned us of all that, but the danger is past now. Everything went very smoothly.”
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Charlie	“Don’t be silly ... I ... we have a good time together. I’d rather be with you than anywhere . . . [MASK], don’t—” “Don’t what?” He looked startled. “Don’t go.”
<name>She</name>	She	Charlie	Seeing him made it all so much harder. She realized now what she’d done to him, and how wrong it had been to lie to him about the baby. “Can we sit down somewhere?” [MASK] suddenly looked older, and more mature.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Andy	Despite her claims that the baby wasn’t the whole picture to her, it was, and they both knew it. “Why don’t we talk about it some other time?” [MASK] said calmly. “There’s no rush. We’re not desperate.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Pilar	“I’ve been reading your files all morning,” [MASK] said quietly. She looked serious and mature and intelligent, the kind of person they could have confidence in. But they knew her reputation, too, which was why they had come to see her.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Andy	He lay the roses down carefully on the front steps, with a note. It didn’t say much, just “I love you, [MASK],” and then got back in his car, and just as he did, she drove up.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Nancy	I guess seeing [MASK] today touched on a nerve I didn’t even know I had . . . something I’ve thought about once or twice in the last year . . . something I’ve really never thought about before, or cared about, or even knew I needed.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Annie	I wound up with a man who drank and cheated and lied and beat me up every chance he got. I don’t know why I stayed with him, except by the time I wanted to leave, I was pregnant. I had [MASK] when I was eighteen.”
<name>Sharon</name>	Sharon	Nancy	He wanted her to stay there for a few days, and that night [MASK] called to tell her about a fabulous new crib she’d seen for their baby. “I—I can’t talk to you right now. . . .”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Pilar	They looked like they’d been through a lot, especially his dad, who seemed to have aged, and was obviously still desperately worried about her, but they seemed to be doing okay. And [MASK] was sad, but she seemed to be coping.
<name>Henrietta</name>	Henrietta	Pilar	“I really don’t know what to say, [MASK]. I wish you hadn’t done this. I suppose it’s too late now, but you were really ill-advised. What you’ve done is risky and unwise. Imagine how you’d feel if you lost those babies.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Hilary	“You can’t let them do that to us.” She was crying as she held the child, and he gently took [MASK] from her and put her over his shoulder. “Just try to stay calm.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Charlie	They were very sloppy about birth control, so much so that [MASK] was growing increasingly concerned about their lack of results. And she had said as much herself months before when she said she was surprised, as careless as they were, that she never got pregnant.
<name>Clare</name>	Clare	Pilar	“My mother was fifty-two when she had her last one.” “Now, there’s something to aspire to.” [MASK] grinned. “Promise me that won’t happen to me, or I’ll shoot myself now.” “On your wedding day?
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Pilar	There was something softer and less angular about her face, something peaceful in her eyes. There was a kind of aura about her now, which intrigued [MASK]. She had seen it in other women before, but she had no idea what it felt like.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Brad	and she felt something warm run down her leg . . . and as she looked down, she saw that she was bleeding. “Oh, my God ...” she whispered, and then she called hoarsely for [MASK], and she just stood there, bleeding on the carpet.
<name>Jenna</name>	Jenna	Gayle	“Typical,” [MASK] had cracked with a grin and a raised eyebrow. Their mother usually thought of everything, planned for all contingencies, and was so organized as to make everyone groan when she started calling them in June to find out what their plans were for Thanksgiving.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Bill	But they were in the home stretch now. Her due date was only eight weeks away, and in another month they were going to let her get up, and it would be all right if she had the baby. “When can we see her?” [MASK] asked excitedly.
<name>her</name>	her	Diana	He chatted with her for a few minutes about what she did, and where she was from, and how long she’d been married, and then he pulled an empty chart closer to him on the desk and took out a pen as he glanced at [MASK] warmly.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Diana	[MASK] finally let him spend the night with her a month after he’d found her. “I don’t want to go back to the house,” she’d said quietly, and he understood that. Not yet at least.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Diana	And with that her brothers-in-law walked in and asked when dinner would be ready. “Patience, boys.” Their mother-in-law smiled, and shooed everyone into the next room, except [MASK]. “Are you really all right, dear?”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Pilar	and now he’s dead and I’ll never know him.” “No, but you may have another child. It won’t change this, but it might help.” “I think that’s the only thing that would,” [MASK] said honestly.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Pilar	It had been different for both of them, but it hadn’t been entirely unpleasant. They took a quick shower, and dressed, and rang for the nurse, holding out the cup to her when she arrived. And she asked [MASK] to come with her.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Di	And work was not an adequate substitute for children and a husband. “You don’t deserve to be alone for the rest of your life. You don’t need to be punished, [MASK]. You didn’t ‘do’ anything. It happened to you.
<name>Rosie</name>	Rosie	Pilar	[MASK] made some objection to it, and just as she was discussing it with him she had a huge contraction. Her whole enormous belly seemed to be caught in a huge vise and squeezed until it forced the air out of her and she almost couldn’t bear it.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Pilar	“Don’t you think you’re wearing yourself out?” he asked as he came into the nursery and sat down. “Maybe you should stop nursing him, or cut back at work or something.” It was rare for [MASK] to look so tired.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Brad	[MASK] walked into the room, listened to the conversation for a moment, and wagged his finger. She was torturing her mother now and loving every minute of it, like a naughty child who is savoring its misdeeds to the fullest.
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Charlie	but [MASK] shook his head solemnly, and looked like an errant schoolboy. “No, I don’t. And I know it’s a rotten thing to do to her. But I really think she’ll be glad one day, if she gets pregnant.
<name>Tiffany</name>	Tiffany	Zale	He was planning to cook dinner for her, shower her with champagne, and give her the ring, which was heart shaped and had a tiny ruby in the center. He had bought it at [MASK]’s, and he thought she’d really love it.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Adam	“I have something to tell you all, which I know will come as something of a surprise. But life is full of wonderful surprises.” She smiled at [MASK] gurgling in his high chair as she said it.
<name>Dr. Andrews</name>	Dr. Andrews	Diana	But I do want you to understand that eleven months is not an abnormally long time. Most couples get pregnant after a year, but some people take a little longer. What about a vacation one of these days? That might be just what you need.” [MASK] smiled.
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Andy	It wasn’t easy to give all that up, and it didn’t seem fair to her that [MASK] had to. “I think it’s unfair of you to live a childless life, because I have to. Why should you do that?”
<name>off</name>	off	olf	She was the perfect girl and he knew he loved her. “I love you too.” She smoothed his hair like a child’s as he drifted [MASK] to sleep, and she held him, wondering why it meant so much to him to have a baby.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Brad	“May I come too?” [MASK] asked hesitantly. There seemed to be nothing about this process that they hadn’t shared so far, and he wanted to be there for her, too, if there was going to be any unpleasant part of the treatment.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Pilar	“I want to hold her,” she said to him, and he reached in carefully and placed her in her mother’s arms, where she had never yet been, and [MASK] sat quietly as she held her.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Andy	But it’s more than that . . . it’s hard to explain . . . it’s just this incredible emptiness . . . this terrible yearning. It just makes me want to die sometimes. I can’t talk to anyone, not even [MASK].
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Mark	She hadn’t been back in almost two years, and the seaminess of it had faded from her mind. All she remembered now was the razzle-dazzle and the excitement. “How come you didn’t go?” [MASK] asked as they ordered a pepperoni pizza.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Jane	He knew why they were there, and he was happy for her. He beckoned to her to come and look between [MASK]’s legs, and when she did, she could see the baby crowning. A tiny head with dark hair, slowly pushing its way through . .
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Nancy	It had been an odd day for her, filled with hard work, endless demands on the part of her clients, some strange moments, and some unfamiliar feelings. She still couldn’t get over [MASK]’s news, or the prospect of her baby.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Hilary	She lumbered around, trying to chase [MASK] as she pulled herself to a standing position everywhere and endangered her life with whatever she found on the coffee table. “She’s a handful, isn’t she?” her mother commented admiringly.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Brad	She looked as though she were carrying baby on top of baby on top of baby. “That’s quite an accomplishment,” [MASK] teased her one night as he helped her out of the bath. She couldn’t do anything alone anymore.
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Diana	She would sign a contract agreeing not to use alcohol or drugs or take undue risks, and in the hospital when the baby was born, she would turn it over to them with no problem. “What if you decide to keep it?” [MASK] said bluntly.
<name>She</name>	She	Pilar	And he was pleased to find that whatever contractions she’d had that morning had continued to dilate her cervix. It was obvious to him that it wouldn’t be long till [MASK] had her babies. “Something will get started soon,” he promised, and then went home.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Pilar	“Oh, it’s you,” she said, sounding surprised. “I thought it was the hospital. How are you?” [MASK] suddenly remembered how she had felt as a child, always an intrusion among far more important matters in her mother’s life.
<name>John</name>	John	Charlie	No harm would come to her as [MASK]’s wife. She was doing the right thing, and suddenly she knew it. “I love you,” he whispered as she stood at his side, and as she looked at him, she realized that she really loved him.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Charlie	“Thank you for working it all out for me,” he said miserably. He knew as he stood there that he would never try again. He couldn’t force her to come back to him, but he knew he would never remarry. “[MASK], I’m sorry . . .”
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Seamus	You’ll probably get pregnant next year.” “Who’s pregnant? Not again!” [MASK] asked, as he walked through the dining room on the way to the kitchen. “You girls, you get pregnant every time a man looks at you!”
<name>the baby</name>	the baby	Christian	Was it something I did? Did I eat wrong, did I lie on one side all the time. . . . Why?” Her eyes filled with tears again as she looked at her husband, and he stood next to her as they looked down at [MASK].
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Charlie	“With [MASK]?” She looked surprised and pleased and her mother nodded, looking happy too. She was pretty and young, and she hadn’t had room for a man in her life for a long time.
