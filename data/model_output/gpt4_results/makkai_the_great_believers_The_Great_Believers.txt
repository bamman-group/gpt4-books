<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Yale	Or maybe [MASK] had been mad at him a long time, an anger that only surfaced when he was already weepy and drunk, like earthworms after heavy rain. The party wound down, arid as they walked home he was stewing still.
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Cecily	He’d originally planned to call her in the morning, or better yet to send a memo over, some kind of apology or heads-up or both, but whatever his plans had been yesterday, they were dust under the freight train now. [MASK] wore a yellow pantsuit that washed her out.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Debra	[MASK]’s hands stopped in her hair. “Excuse me?” He was so out of it, so distracted, that he thought he’d offended her by bringing up the very mouse she’d been chasing. She said, “Did you say two million dollars?”
<name>Mrs. Smith</name>	Mrs. Smith	Mrs.	She stuck her left hand into her jeans pocket to stop shaking. “You’re sure it’s them?” Mr, and [MASK]! “Ha, yes, he was easy to find because he was arrested last year. No prison, don’t worry.”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Yale	“I’ll send you some Polaroid shots in the mail. I know you can’t tell much from a photo, but you’ll have an idea.” Because the possibility of their all heading to the bank in the rain hadn’t been raised, [MASK] didn’t mention it himself.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Charlie	People are afraid of blood. I mean, they might throw something, but no one’s going to punch you in the mouth coming out of a bar now, right?” And [MASK] had said, “Are you fucking kidding me? Attacks are up threefold.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Julian	It made no sense. Or maybe it did. It had to. She was awake, and it was 2015, and here was a man, very much alive, whose eyes and gestures and voice were [MASK]’s.
<name>Christa</name>	Christa	Yale	And then it burst into a ball of smoke, two spiraling plumes. “My God, they had that teacher on there,” [MASK] said. “What?” “You know, there was that contest for a teacher to go to space. The woman.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Richard	[MASK]’s phone rang again, but he ignored it. “I didn’t mean to offend him,” she said. “I’m not naive, you know that.” He said, “It’s always a matter, isn’t it, of waiting for the world to come unraveled?
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Yale	“Well,” [MASK] said, “we could hold off till authentication comes through.” His voice was made of tin. “But we have strong corroboration for provenance, and we’d love to get restoration started to prevent further damage.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Cecily	There was time yet to call her over, see if she’d sit on someone’s lap, if she’d speak to them in either English or French. [MASK] said, “She’s just so beautiful.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Yale	In the dark. Everyone’s shouting and laughing.” [MASK] wasn’t sure if the story was about to turn pornographic or romantic or terrible, so he just said “Oh God,” which covered all three possibilities. “What did you do?”
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Richard	Everyone seemed to hit old at a different point, but sometime since she’d seen him last, [MASK] had hit it. It was 9:07. She sat on the floor next to where the phone was still plugged in and dialed the Pi’s number.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Nora	He couldn’t imagine that was true. But they’d work something out, maybe just phone conversations. [MASK] stood and slowly joined them near the front door. She said, “I fear I haven’t gotten it across at all.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Yale	“So he—he had to have planned it, right? You don’t just carry that stuff around.” [MASK] said, “Why do you think he did it?” “Good lord. People take their reasons with them, don’t they?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Yale	[MASK] was tired after he left, but he’d been afraid, for the last couple of days, of falling asleep. He didn’t fear dying in his sleep—he’d take it, at this point—but waking up under water again.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Fiona	“That’s so kind!” “Well, you nearly severed your fingers at our house. This is so you won’t sue!” [MASK] held a glass of ice water in her gauzed hand because it felt good, even if the condensation made the gauze wet.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Allen	There was an unfortunate period during the war when he moved home and made propaganda. But no one cares about that anymore.” [MASK] laughed. “Don’t they? I think my old man would care.”
<name>Stephanie</name>	Stephanie	Yale	He said, “They make your ass look like hamburger buns. I don’t mean that in a bad way.” He stepped back, looked [MASK] up and down. “They don’t do much for your front, though. And I’ve heard about your front.”
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Yale	Of all the parents of all the gay men she knew? An actress mother would have understood a gay son, wouldn’t she? For [MASK] to be alienated from her for reasons that had nothing to do with his sexuality just felt excessive, perverse.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Teddy	[MASK] told them about the Klan activity in the park. He said, “They’re gone now. They didn’t want to actually see any of this, you know? They left right before the parade started.”
<name>Aaron</name>	Aaron	Julian	“Hey, take a deep breath, okay?” [MASK] sat on the floor, the backpack between his legs. “You’re not missing your flight. What time is it?” “I just need to get out of here.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Yale	“Could that desire be about your mother?” he’d said. “A desire to connect with your mother, through the theater?” And [MASK] had brushed it off, said that wasn’t it at all.
<name>Jenna</name>	Jenna	Yale	This isn’t a shame thing, I want you to understand. Sometimes we associate secrecy with shame. This is simply about protecting you. Do you have questions about confidentiality?” [MASK] didn’t need the shame lecture, but it was a nice delay.
<name>Warhol</name>	Warhol	Richard	A mirror behind them all, in which you could see a room of tables, diners, and [MASK] himself, camera flash for a head. She wanted to climb into the photo, to say, “Stop where you are.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Yale	And because he felt very, very hot now, so hot, like he’d been knitted into a thousand blankets, and because the heat was filling his lungs even as something inside him was cold, was turning, in fact, to ice, [MASK] chose polar bears.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Fiona	He asked if she was okay. “My back just hurts,” she said. “You don’t have to sleep here.” “I want to.” He said, “[MASK], I hate that I’m putting you through this again.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Fiona	He smiled at [MASK]. “Twenty-four years and eight months sober.” They were early; only two dozen people in there and half were lugging huge cameras and lighting equipment, snapping eager photos of the earliest guests.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Nico	I saw him out with it, he was way down the street, and there was this second where I—” “You saw [MASK].” “Yeah. And if it had been you, someone I wanted to see, that would’ve been different.
<name>Andi</name>	Andi	Julian	“You looked smashing, [MASK].” “Okay, two other things. This one.” He took her shoulders and angled her toward a glowing light box mounted on the wall and covered, every inch of it, with black and white contact sheets.
<name>He</name>	He	Arnaud	“Oh holy shit,” she said. “I have to take this!” She left him there, walked quickly for no good reason. Static at her ear. [MASK] cleared his throat and said, “Well, they were easy to find.
<name>Yolanda</name>	Yolanda	Fiona	He went through the backpack again, removing things: rolled-up socks, plastic bag with toothpaste and Scope, a small journal. He turned to [MASK] and said, “Hey, I buy a drink?” She wasn’t sure she’d heard right.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Fiona	Part of him thought he should hoard each breath, save it for tomorrow, but mostly he wanted to talk while he still could, say things he wouldn’t be able to say later. [MASK] was in the chair beside the bed.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Yale	But [MASK] only owned one backpack. He put a sweatshirt in, a spare bandanna, and a bottle of water. He put his inhaler into one pants pocket and a plastic baggie with three days of pills into the other, in case he was detained.
<name>Moira</name>	Moira	Roman	He hoped it was true, because the thought of going back to the B&B tonight, of sleeping in the same building as [MASK], was bringing a wave of nausea. Or maybe that was the heavy lifting. They walked the hutch a foot forward, one end at a time.
<name>Henrietta</name>	Henrietta	Lipchitz	The trouble was, [MASK] used the wrong plaster, something too abrasive, so when they took it off”—she glanced at each of them—“it peeled off his cheek, and his eyelids. The men panicked and dropped the cast right on the floor.
<name>Jonas</name>	Jonas	Yale	You can’t get it if you always top.” And [MASK] had tried to give him data, had said that was like girls who thought you couldn’t get pregnant in summer. That you couldn’t apply rules to a virus this random.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Asher	The Howard Brown clinic, where they both were on the board, had finally, after much debate, decided that next month it would start offering the HTLV-III test, the one doctors had been giving since the spring. [MASK] had quit, vocally.
<name>Mozart</name>	Mozart	Ranko	But it wasn’t just that. I was honestly never that good. Now, I might've, been, if I’d kept up the training. I was someone who needed the instruction. [MASK] was destroyed by the teaching, but I’d have been helped.”
<name>Neil</name>	Neil	Julian	I should be poisoning the coffee, but I’m just not mad at you. But you have to tell me something. I need to know whether that was really the only time.” [MASK] flipped the magazine over, open, as if he didn’t want to lose his place.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Debra	He said, “Yeah, more or less.” [MASK]’s face grew so red, so pinched, that he thought she might spit at him. She whispered, which was worse than if she’d shouted. “I was on your side.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Richard	He made quick work of the plastic, and soon her phone was charging happily. [MASK] said, “Two things I haven’t told you. One’s just a minor nuisance, and one is nothing at all.”
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Kurt	And then [MASK] stole from the store. He came in when I was closing up, and he took stuff, a bunch of times. I didn’t know he was doing it. I still got fired. But I didn’t get arrested. He did.
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Kurt	[MASK] seemed sober, lucid. He spoke quietly, his voice impossibly deep. “I don’t know how much I can tell you. I don’t know if you’re going to try something.” “Try something!”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Yale	“And next to me was a man with dark, curly hair—quite like yours, [MASK], although his face was longer—and as he sat there, he made himself a crown of paper clips. Linked them in a circle and put it on his head.
<name>Marina</name>	Marina	Fiona	[MASK] pulled fliers off the telephone poles, loaded them into the empty stroller. It was her job to clean the streets. She stripped posters from windows, signs from stores, menus from restaurant entrances. She walked into an empty bar and sniffed the half-filled pint glasses still on the counter.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Charlie	Listen. I went upstairs because I needed to be alone.” [MASK] said, slowly, unsurely, “I saw him. I saw him during the slide show.” “Are you thinking of the picture?
<name>Rose</name>	Rose	Fiona	Why not. He looked behind the garbage again. In the garbage. Out on the fire escape. [MASK] was in the doorway, her face red and wet. In her arms she held what looked like a deflated stuffed animal. A fur pelt. Roadkill.
<name>him</name>	him	Kurt	“No, like bribe the landlord.” “Why not just approach [MASK]?” “Because if he doesn’t cooperate—then we’re through. But if we look around first, then we know more, and we can still talk to him later.
<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Roman	He’d be the world’s luckiest man to stand there at the end of it all, to be the one left, trying to remember. The unluckiest too. And then [MASK] screamed. It was shrill and it came in pieces, a rapid machine-gun scream that didn’t stop.
<name>He</name>	He	Arnaud	Order some food, okay? So, we have some more steps to take. We need to plan those out. Here. Drink water.” She put the glass to her forehead instead of drinking from it, and when the waitress came by [MASK] ordered for her.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Charlie	Compact and tidy and not too glamorous, which was why, ever since he’d noticed the “For Sale” sign out front, he’d been entertaining the wild question of whether he and [MASK] might be able to afford it. Who on earth ever bought a house?
<name>Jackson</name>	Jackson	Jake	His eyes were red, his shirt undone one button too low. She put her purse on the counter, slid her shoes off. Both men waved, and [MASK] pointed dramatically to his phone, which lay on the coffee table. He was recording.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Yale	It had been winter for so long that the air didn’t hurt anymore. The frozen lake edge was the surface of another planet, rippled and fractured and gray. [MASK] couldn’t feel his fingers, but he waited till he couldn’t feel his head either.
<name>He</name>	He	Asher	(And who was he kidding? It wasn’t love. It was attraction. It was a seed that might have grown, given better soil, more sun.) In every version of the story, [MASK] was correct.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Claire	It was confusing and she was upset, and although she asked them about these people they were living with, she was more concerned with [MASK]’s demeanor, her dull eyes and twitching foot, than with the answers.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Nora	They sent him to call the bed and breakfast from the lobby to see if there’d been a message. He came back shaking his head. But meanwhile, [MASK] had opened the shoebox of papers, started sorting them into stacks.
<name>Arbus</name>	Arbus	Richard	Next to it hung a photo of an apartment building’s facade, three of the windows painted over with red As. According to the sign, [MASK] had taken the photo in 1982 but added the Jfs just this year.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Cecily	He had about eight hundred dollars in his checking account. A hotel would eat that up quickly, but he couldn’t think about it right now. Someone rapped on his door, and he remembered [MASK], that certainly she’d be coming today to light into him.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Fiona	“Your whole wallet?” “Big, leather thing. You haven’t seen it, have you?” He peered, suddenly inspired, into his magazine pouch, and then into [MASK]’s. “Fuck. I got my passport at least, but fuck.”
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Serge	“I’ll try.” “No, no, promise!” [MASK] smiled, a smile so suddenly dazzling that it must have let him waltz through his entire life making demands like that. “I think I’ll have overstayed my welcome by that point.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Yale	The kitchen wasn’t much, but they could invest in that later. He’d always wanted to learn to tile. The upstairs was filled with afternoon light, and just standing there in the empty bedroom, looking out into the small backyard, [MASK] felt like he was floating.
<name>Second</name>	Second	Claire	Second, yes, that was one of the worst days of my life, although lord knows I’ve had lots of them, but it had nothing to do with [MASK]. This isn’t some huge secret. It was a terrible day, a shitshow.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Teresa	He knocked first to make sure [MASK] was gone, and he turned the key slowly. He hated the version of himself that had stood here last, ready to share the details of his amazing trip, oblivious to the coming ambush.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Nora	She said, “Gosh, I don’t know. I imagine this place will go fast.” If everything worked out with [MASK]’s donation—and when would he know that? In a month? A year?—he’d feel, at least, secure in his job.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Asher	He said, “If you need legal help getting what’s yours out of your old place—or anything financial—I’m just saying, this is what I do, and I’d be glad to help.” The water clung to [MASK]’s shoulders and chest hair in perfect spheres.
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Yale	Oh, [MASK]. What. I’m sorry.” He realized he had a horrible look on his face. He said, “No, I just—I was thinking how—” “Look, I’m sorry. I’m not clueless, okay?
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Yale	All appeared to be done in blue crayon. Three of the four were signed. All nudes. If these were real, if they could be authenticated, they’d be worth a lot more than the pencil sketches [MASK] had been imagining.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Debra	That they were five days too late. Patches of snow dotted the lawn, reflecting sunlight. They were halfway up the walk when a young woman, not [MASK]—red-haired, bundled in a blue parka—rounded the corner holding the boy’s hand.
<name>Hamilton</name>	Hamilton	Nora	We take you off [MASK] and see how the rest plays out. And you were done there anyway! But I’d take you off any grant writing related to the show as well. The publicity and so on.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Yale	She spoke at a tremendous clip. “I can be. What time?” “All day. Possibly all night as well.” No evident embarrassment. Either she didn’t realize what she’d said, or she already had [MASK] completely figured out.
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Charlie	I stayed there, at his place. On Thursday night. He’s fine.” [MASK]’s voice was suddenly patient. “That might be true, but they took him to the hospital late Friday morning. He died Friday.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Claire	And, stupidly, she’d let him be the one to go into [MASK]’s bedroom. Maybe because he was the only one who could take it back, being the one who’d said it. She should have gone in herself. Why hadn’t she?
<name>She</name>	She	Fernand	[MASK] the important critic. Nothing here was recognizable as her own life. This man, this room, this blood. He massaged the meat of her palm gently, peered at her hand through his glasses. “Thank you,” she said.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Yale	[MASK] was a development guy, not an art guy, or at least he wasn’t supposed to be an art guy, but he had let himself fall in love with that painting. He knew better. Farmers shouldn’t name their animals.
<name>Marco</name>	Marco	Charlie	The glitter cannons at the corners of the dance floor shot off, and the shirtless men who’d already looked like fitness models suddenly shone with blue and pink and green glitter. It stuck to their sweat, defined their shoulders. “That one,” [MASK] said, pointing at a luminescent dancer.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Damian	“Do you think she’s scared?” [MASK] asked. “I hope not. I mean, not more than everyone else. She’s not a kid anymore.” “But she’s a mother.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Charlie	There were at least five things he planned to say, and several answers he intended to demand, but not quite yet. [MASK] went back and sat in his desk chair, and for a moment it looked as if he were going to collapse sobbing.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Claire	I’d like for you to come home with me, but—” she put up a hand to stop [MASK]’s wide-eyed protest “—if that’s not an option, I’d like to stay a while. Maybe I can help with the baby.
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Cecily	“Come outside.” Out on the sidewalk, [MASK] handed him the napkin she’d been holding around her drink. He used it on his nose, flowing even more embarrassingly than his eyes. “You’ll both freeze,” he said.
<name>David</name>	David	Arnaud	“Yes,” he said, “you sit, you read a book, I don’t care. You watch a film.” He had wild, thick eyebrows. He was furious. [MASK] had gone still, moved his paper to the side to get a better look.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Bill	If [MASK] caught wind of this, he’d be off the Novak pieces forever. If anyone else heard about it— good God, it could throw off all the authentications. It was a—not a forged piece, exactly, but close.
<name>Langston</name>	Langston	Asher	If he wasn’t at the office or at meetings, he was working at home, his Macintosh humming like a life support machine. He’d joined [MASK]’s effort to bring the Human Rights Ordinance back up for a vote, something he’d formerly wanted to stall on.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Kurt	“That was the oddest part. She was always a rebel. She quit Girl Scouts, she quit orchestra, she wouldn’t date anyone longer than a month or two. Until [MASK].” “Does she have a reason to avoid you?”
<name>She</name>	She	Claire	“I thought we could stay here.” She said it firmly, as if she’d practiced. As if the woman behind the bar were going to make sure [MASK] wasn’t abducted today. They sat in the corner under a TV showing a soccer match.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Yale	People like that tend to underestimate how much they have. She thinks she has five million, leaves us one million, when actually she has seven point five, and twenty percent is a lot more.” “But she was only—” [MASK] stopped, remembered to ask a question.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Fiona	He dialed [MASK] from the phone by the bed. Mostly he wanted to check in, see if she was eating, if she’d made it home safely. He worried about her. She had no family left, not really.
<name>Stargirl</name>	Stargirl	Fiona	He said, “You should interview [MASK] while she’s here. You can interview me anytime. But her brother and those other boys, they’re—” and he stopped, blinked rapidly, waved a hand in front of his face.
<name>Althea</name>	Althea	Fiona	“Don’t listen to her. They’re not all dead.” [MASK] said, “I need a sharp knife.” Her poor timing didn’t register until both men started laughing, and she realized she hadn’t said anything yet about the converter, the clamshell packaging.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Asher	“But the runs aren’t a disability category, you know? So [MASK]’s finding me this junior litigator, I guess? And here’s what he has to prove at this hearing. He has to show that I can’t do any unskilled.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Merry	If this were three weeks ago, they could have simply cried together. But everything had scabbed over, and now there was this idea of party on top of everything else, this imperative to be, somehow, okay. [MASK].
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Fiona	He’s the one that always swims!” The bear in question zoomed past the glass, a furry torpedo. “I want to say something,” [MASK] said. Behind and above the girls, it felt as if they could have a completely private conversation.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Charlie	He was supposed to take whatever he wanted of [MASK]’s and anything of his own that had languished there for four years. This weekend he’d do this, next weekend he’d do that. This was probably easier.
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Serge	“Now the trick, my dear, is to keep you awake the rest of the day. No sleep whatsoever. Caffeine, but only if you drink it regularly. And no wine, not a drop, till you’re rehydrated.” “He’s an expert,” [MASK] said.
<name>Marco</name>	Marco	Fiona	I’m going to, what, sit there in class with eighteen-year-olds?” The distance between eighteen and twenty-one seemed laughably small, but he didn’t say so. Besides, [MASK]’s twenty-one might as well have been two hundred.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Teddy	“[MASK]’s suffocating me. Have you noticed that he never stops moving? Like, ever. And he’s in my face, like I open my eyes in the morning and there he is. Listen, don’t say anything till it’s done, but I’m getting out of here.
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Roman	“Congestive heart failure is apparently a waiting game. We have to assume each visit could be our last. So, big picture first. Colorful details later.” Back in the car, [MASK] said, “I want to know how you made her trust you that fast.”
<name>She</name>	She	Cecily	It sounds like a movie! We could do it, we really could. Why should all that study abroad stuff be wasted on the young?” “No,” [MASK] had said, and shook her head definitively. “Are you really considering this?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Charlie	“And I am so vain!” he always said. “So you know it’s true!” (“That scarf is not apricot,” [MASK] always responded. “It’s orange and gray.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Yale	Yes. He did. “I’m not some monster, okay? I’m not going to flip my lid every time you come in contact with someone.” “I know,” [MASK] said. “I didn’t mean it like that.”
