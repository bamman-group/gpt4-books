<name>Aunt Beryl</name>	Aunt Beryl	Lottie	Crocheted doilies were sprinkled in profusion, making the room seem as though it had suffered some snowstorm of stiff lace. [MASK] was podgy as a puffball. She looked as though she’d either burst or bounce if you tapped her.
<name>Dill</name>	Dill	Death	When I’ve done, the light still holds and in one shell lying on the floor at my feet I see that half a dozen June bugs have been caught. I prod them with a fingernail. They’re not alive. [MASK] hasn’t tarnished them, however.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Bram	I didn’t think there would be an afterward, anyway. I was convinced it would be the finish of me. [MASK] drove me into town. I might have known he wouldn’t turn at the Anglican Church and go by a side street. Oh no.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Arlene	“I guess I’ll be going now.” I pulled myself together. I wanted to ask who else had seen him, but I couldn’t bring myself to speak the question. ‘Thank you, [MASK],” I said. “That’s okay.”
<name>Nancy</name>	Nancy	Arlene	I guess he thought he needn’t save it any longer. But despite what he had said, he never brought [MASK] back. They never played at house again in the Shipley place. The evening I’m thinking of, I decided not to wait up for him.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	John	[MASK] asked. “No. We’ll find a place of our own. I’ll have to get a job. I could be someone’s housekeeper.” Then I laughed, and he looked at me, frowning.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	John	He never could make up an excuse on the spur of the moment, as [MASK] could. Finally he’s got it, and obviously believes it’s brilliant. “Well, there’s nothing exactly wrong, organically,” he says, pleased with this impressive word.
<name>John</name>	John	Doris	Oh—here’s a packet of those small Swiss cheeses, triangles wrapped in silver paper. I like them very much, and [MASK] hardly ever buys them, as they’re an extravagance. I’ll treat myself, just this once. There. That’ll do.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Doris	“If you don’t want to go there, Mother, you don’t need to.” “Well, I like that!” [MASK] is outraged. “And who’ll do the laundry, I’d like to know? You, I suppose?”
<name>He</name>	He	Goodness	Have to look successful, you know.” “You don’t only look. You are. Aren’t you?” "I can’t complain,” he says. He’s an architect, a very clever boy. [MASK] knows where he gets his brains from.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Hagar	Who saw?” “How in hell should I know who saw? I never done it for an audience. Shut up about it, [MASK], can’t you? It’s over and done with. I’m sorry. There, is that enough?”
<name>darling</name>	darling	Marvin	I’m quite done in now. “I don’t care, [MASK]. It doesn’t matter in the slightest.” “Sure?” He frowns. “Quite sure. Move me or not. It’s all the same to me.”
<name>Pa</name>	Pa	Bram	I was frightened of them, so high and heavy they seemed, so muscular, so much their own masters—I never felt I could handle them. I didn’t let [MASK] see I was afraid, preferring to let him think I merely objected to them because they were smelly.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Marvin	He hasn’t a scrap of imagination. I wish I hadn’t given them the sapphire ring. Theyll not appreciate it, anyway. Just a chunk of junk jewelry, that’s all it is to them. “Don’t keep on so, [MASK].
<name>someone</name>	someone	Marvin	“I’ll go.” “It’s okay,” [MASK] says. “I don’t mind. I’ll go.” They shuffle in the doorway, elbowing over who is to go. “I wouldn’t have asked,” I say aloofly, “
<name>Uncle Remus</name>	Uncle Remus	Bram	But when I’d listen to [MASK] spinning his cobwebs, then it would turn my stomach most of all, not what he said but that he made himself a laughingstock. That kitchen never had an indoor pump, although they weren’t so difficult to fix from the rain barrel.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Marvin	You went straight out to work when you got home, and I know when it was. Five. I’ve got the old alarm clock in my room now. I was awake. I seen you.” “Shut your trap,” [MASK] said.
<name>Blackie</name>	Blackie	Soldier	This rankled with me, for clearly he meant it as a reproach, but it seemed to me just an excuse for the fact that he never did have any head for business. He always used to ride that stallion, never any of the others. He called it [MASK], such an unimaginative name.
<name>him</name>	him	Bram	I’d almost given [MASK] up, when he came back, opening the door suddenly and letting in a gust of night and snow-filled wind. His face was frozen, and both hands. He took his coat and boots off and sat down, rubbing his hands gingerly to work the frostbite out.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	John	“There’s, nothing due until the six-fifteen,” he said, “and that’s not for an hour.” “Nevertheless,” I said. “Nevertheless.” “Oh jumping Jesus,” [MASK] said. “Okay, okay.”
<name>John</name>	John	John	“What would you have done?” [MASK] said. “Hired a rainmaker? Got the ministers to pray or the Indians from the mountain to dance for clouds?” “I don’t believe it has to be this bad,” I said.
<name>she</name>	she	Arlene	We won’t make that mistake.” “I know,” [MASK] said. “But—” “But what?” “I really want to have one,” she said, simple and open, not a speck of guile or hesitance.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Doris	She brings me my summer coat—a black grosgrain, loose-fitting and cool, yet just enough to keep the evening chill away. I feel comfortable and smart in it. Even [MASK] likes this coat. She takes my arm, quite needlessly, and off we go.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Arlene	“Where did you go last night?” I asked sharply. He glanced up. “Eh? Oh—a dance at the Legion Hall. How did I get home?” “[MASK] brought you.” Astonishingly, he gave a low laugh.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Femey	But I’d rather not. I liked that forest. I recall the ferns, cool and lacy. But I was thirsty, so I had to come here. The man’s name was [MASK], and he spoke about his wife. She was never the same.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Hagar	That touched her on the raw, all right, but it served her right, to have her roots flung up at her, after the way she’d spoken of my son and husband. She fanned herself with a magazine, held out a sapphired hand for my cup. “More tea, [MASK]?”
<name>Mrs. Ramsey</name>	Mrs. Ramsey	Doris	“The laxative didn’t work?” “I’m all right. I'm all right. Stop fussing over me, [MASK], for pity’s sake.” Back she goes to the kitchen, and I’m alone. My things are all around me.
<name>Willy</name>	Willy	Telford	[MASK]’s father wasn’t very highly regarded. He kept the Funeral Parlor but he never had a nickel to bless himself with. “He fritters away his cash,” my father said, and after a while I learned this meant he drank.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Arlene	[MASK] came out that afternoon. She had grown thinner, and it didn’t suit her a bit. Her face had a drawn look, I thought, as though she worried a lot. Her hair had darkened a little, too, lost that true blonde color.
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Clara	It always looked so foolish. The kitchen was huge, and the old woodstove was the size of a furnace. The table was covered with oilcloth that had once been blue-and-white checked, but [MASK] and then myself had scrubbed the pattern off.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Hagar	each married for those qualities we later found we couldn’t bear, he for my manners and speech, I for his flouting of them. This one time, though, he didn’t speak as usual. He only shrugged, wiping his mucoused hand, and grinned. “You know something, [MASK]?
<name>Offred</name>	Offred	Lord	Only now do I see that what’s going to happen can’t be delayed indefinitely. [MASK], how the world has shrunk. Now it’s only one enormous room, full of high white iron cots, each narrow, and in each one a female body of some sort.
<name>Marion</name>	Marion	Lottie	After a while, I went to see [MASK]. But whatever flimsy bond had once been there between us, it was broken now. I saw her only for a few minutes. She didn’t blame, nor I, but we had nothing to say to one another.
<name>Mrs. Bates</name>	Mrs. Bates	Doris	I can see it in his face. “What’s wrong with [MASK]? Nothing serious?” “Oh, she had another of her spells,” he says. “Her heart’s none too good, you know.” He stands there, frowning.
<name>Ethan</name>	Ethan	Doris	Yet [MASK] never cared a snap about that pitcher, I’m bound to admit. Well, there’s no explaining tastes, and ugliness is pretty nowadays. Myself, I favor flowers, a leaf sprig or two, a measure of gracefulness in an ungainly world.
<name>Silverthreads</name>	Silverthreads	Marvin	Why is [MASK] turning and driving through this open gate? The wrought iron letters, fanciful and curlicued, all at once form into meaning before my eyes. SILVERTHREADS I push aside my shroud of pillows, and my hands clutch at the back of the seat.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Marvin	“Oh yes, that would be just fine, thanks.” That’s the very place. I’d forgotten, until he said it, what the place was and what it used to be, but now I recollect [MASK]’s explaining about it that day.
<name>darling</name>	darling	Steven	“No. Nothing. There’s nothing I want.” “Sure?” “You might just leave me your packet of cigarettes, [MASK]. Would you?” “Oh sure, of course. Here—have one now.” “Thank you.”
<name>he</name>	he	Marvin	“The matron said we could come and have a cup of tea,” [MASK] says over his shoulder, in my direction. “Look around, you know. Have a look at the place, and see how you felt about it.
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Doris	“It’s not a job I relish.” Then, frighteningly, his voice, so low and solid, goes high and seeking. “What will I say to her, [MASK]? How can I make her see?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Doris	I’ll have to ask, that’s all. I shall simply say I’m out for a walk. There’s nothing odd about that. I’m managing admirably. I’d give anything to see [MASK]’s face when she gets back from shopping.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Doris	I have that miserable bile taste in my mouth, and under my ribs I feel the pain beginning to nag. Perhaps if I take an aspirin, I’ll be fine. [MASK] helps me to dress, and while she’s getting my breakfast I go to the den.
<name>Doctor</name>	Doctor	Doris	There. That’s just fine. Now, a deep breath—” At last it’s over, his coldly intimate touch, [MASK] and the nurse pretending not to look, I grunting like a constipated cow in a disgust as pure as hatred.
<name>Doctor</name>	Doctor	Doris	The lifting —it’s too much. She just can’t do it—” “Not to mention the disturbed nights—” [MASK] prompts. “Yes, the nights. She’s up and down a dozen times and never gets a decent sleep.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	John	The eyes change least of all. [MASK]’s eyes were gray, and even near the last they looked the same to me as the boy’s, still that hidden eagerness as though he half believed, against all reason and knowledge, that something splendid would suddenly occur.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Doris	The bus stop is right outside the bank. [MASK] and I come here when we go to the doctor’s. I’m sure this is where we catch the bus to downtown. It must be. But is it?
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Steven	The nurse arrives and the girl whispers. I can hear. “Do I have to stay here—with her?” Furious and affronted, I turn over in my bed and reach for [MASK]’s cigarettes. Then I hear the nurse’s reply.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Steven	“[MASK]—are you all right, really? Are you—content?” He is taken by surprise. “Content?. I don’t know. I’m as well off as the next guy, I suppose. What a question.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	John	When [MASK] was six, I gave him the Currie plaid-pin. It was sterling silver, and although it had grown black in the years it was put away, I polished it for him. “Your grandfather got this when his father died.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	John	You’re not the only one who’s having a tough time. They’re using gangs of unemployed on road work right now, but I’ll bet a nickel you haven’t even tried to get on there.” “Shut up,” [MASK] said abruptly.
<name>Carl</name>	Carl	Bram	The horse had caught a leg in a barbed wire fence, and couldn’t have lived long that night, before the cold claimed him. [MASK] buried him in the pasture, and I’m certain he put a boulder on the place, like a gravestone.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	John	These ones were real. I know, for I used to see them. They’d call for him in a tin lizzie, and honk outside the gates, and [MASK] would fly. They never came inside. I thought them too flashy and I suspected they drank.
<name>Ignatius</name>	Ignatius	Marvin	In the living-room, [MASK] is walking to and fro like a pacing bear in some zoo pit. He has that look of difficult concentration which he wears when he’s forced to deal with something he’d rather procrastinate about.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	John	Why should He care who mates or parts? But when a man and woman live in a house, sleep in a bed, have meals, and children, you can’t always part them by willing it so, [MASK]’s letter were infrequent and told me little.
<name>Her</name>	Her	John	All else diminished in importance beside it, when I thought what I’d gone through to get [MASK] away from just that sort of thing. The smell of it came back to me, the bone-weariness, the gray eternal scum of soap on tin washbasins.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Doris	With [MASK] it is greed. She never had much as a child, I know, and when they first came here, to be with me, she eyed the furniture and bric-a-brac like a pouch-faced gopher eyeing acorns, eager to nibble.
<name>Offred</name>	Offred	Doris	Looking both disappointed and relieved, [MASK] picks up her magazine once more. What sort of dungeon is this, and what is happening? They’ve put me on the table, as before, but now the lights are out and I am falling, falling through darkness as one does only in dreams.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Marvin	“But you’ve got the money yourself, luckily, and it’s only right it should be spent on you.” “It’s in the country,” [MASK] says. “Cedars and alders all around, and the garden’s well kept.”
<name>someone</name>	someone	John	I always feared for it after I grew stout, thinking if I pulled too hard at it, it would be like a plug jerked from a sink and I’d gurgle and go out of life like wash-water. I stood aside and let [MASK] do it.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Corinthians	“I thought I did,” he says doubtfully. “But maybe I never, at that. I took it more easy than some, it’s true, but when I got up to testify I talked like [MASK] says with the tongues of men and of angels.
<name>honey</name>	honey	Honey	You get a line and I’ll get a pole, babe. You get a line and I’ll get a pole And we’ll go down to the crawdad hole, [MASK], baby mine—” Her dental plate clicks like a snapping turtle.
<name>George</name>	George	John	I oughta be. We been married fifty-two years this August. I’m seventy. Wed at eighteen. What’s your man’s name? [MASK], ain’t it?” I can only gape at her, and she chortles. “See?
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Hagar	She’d grown fat as butter, and her marcelled hair was gray as mine now. She wore a teal-blue shantung suit which might have looked quite smart if she hadn’t been so portly. “Well, well, [MASK],” she chirped.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	John	When [MASK] took her back to town, I waited up for him. I wouldn’t go in the front room at night, so shadowed it was, and filled with the empty china cupboard and the rug that smelled of the mothballs I’d scattered last summer.
<name>Imhotep</name>	Imhotep	Bernini	I think now she must have been carved in that distant sun by stone masons who were the cynical descendants of [MASK], gouging out her like by the score, gauging with admirable accuracy the needs of fledgling pharaohs in an uncouth land.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Doris	I took a two-ninety-two before I left, from [MASK]’s hoarded stock, and so the awkward place, the spot soft as a fontanel under my ribs, isn’t acting up too badly. The bus stop is right outside the bank.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Steven	His tone has affection in it, and I would be pleased if it weren’t condescending as well, in the same way that gushing matrons will coo over a carriage—What a cute baby, how adorable. “You needn’t be impertinent, [MASK].
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Marv	“No,” he said at last. “I don’t want to argue with you about it, [MASK]. But I won’t go back. I’m through with living in other people’s houses.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	John	He could get us all laughing. Lord, I must’ve been only a tiny kid, then, the times I’m thinking of. It’s longer ago than I care to say.” “Oh my God,” [MASK] said in a strained voice.
<name>Uncle Axel</name>	Uncle Axel	Marvin	The ribs can scarcely contain the thudding of my heart. Yet I do not know what it is that frightens me so. [MASK] comes into the living-room. “How are you feeling tonight. Mother?” “Fine. Just fine, thanks.”
<name>myself</name>	myself	Marvin	There am I at nine, a solemn child with large eyes and long straight hair. There’s Father with his plumed mustache, coldly eyeing the camera, daring it not to do him justice. And [MASK] the day he started school, wearing a sailor suit and a face blank as water.
<name>Aunt Alexandra</name>	Aunt Alexandra	Steven	She never bothers, your mother. It never occurs to her.” “Well, maybe she forgot. She’s been—” “I’ll bet she forgot. I’ll just bet a cookie she did. When is she going, [MASK]?”
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Hagar	Oh, I know you wouldn’t—why do I even ask? I’m not myself.” I could find no words that would reach deeply enough. After a moment she composed herself. “You’d best go now, [MASK],” she said.
<name>the mother's</name>	the mother's	Bram	He went up the stairs from the kitchen, and came back down in a moment. It never occurred to him to look in the front room, so seldom used, ever, and hardly entered at all since [MASK]’s death.
<name>he</name>	he	Tina	Now I am exhausted and glad enough to change the subject. I will not give her the satisfaction of believing me cranky. I will make the effort, as much as she, to be agreeable. “Will [MASK] be home for dinner?” A safe remark.
<name>Daphne</name>	Daphne	Doris	I sit uncomfortably. I am bloated, full, weighted down, and I fear I may pass wind. Nevertheless, for the minister’s call I have at least put on my gray flowered dress. Silk jersey, [MASK] calls it.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Doris	They’re always loaded with artificial flowers. Her head looks like a greenhouse full of tuberous-rooted begonias, petals of all rosy shades, flesh and blush and blood. Now I see she’s looking anxious. “What’s the matter [MASK], for goodness’ sake?
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Bram	He believed his words implicitly. But what a green girl I must have been, to believe them equally. After the first year of our marriage, I let [MASK] go to town alone, and I stayed home. He raised no objection.
<name>Aunt Josephine</name>	Aunt Josephine	Marvin	he said sulkily. “It must be here somewheres.” “Somewhere,” I told him. “Somewheres isn’t a word.” I looked and looked, but couldn’t find it. “Are we going to live with [MASK] at the coast?”
<name> a sailor </name>	a sailor	Bram	I curse like [MASK], summoning every blasphemy I can lay my hands on, screeching them into the quiet forest. Perhaps the anger gives me strength, for I clutch at a bough, not caring if it’s covered with pins and needles or not, and yank myself upright.
<name>Mrs. Hopewell</name>	Mrs. Hopewell	Mercy	“Where’s my hairbrush got to? Oh, here we are. [MASK], does my hair ever need a good wash—” She brushes at her scalp with its thin gray quilt of hair. “Loo, loo—” She warbles with the hairpins in her mouth.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Delighted	The rooms are empty, except for the tumbleweed dust. No—not quite. In one bedroom there’s a brass four-poster, and incredibly the mattress is still on it. [MASK], I pat it. My room has been prepared for me.
<name>Aunt Lydia</name>	Aunt Lydia	Jill	[MASK]’s ever so nice, and won’t bother you at all. She’ll watch TV and just be here if you need—” “No I” I am shouting, suddenly, and my eyes are like hot springs, welling up with scalding water.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Marvin	It was the only bedroom in the house that had a tree outside the window. Probably the sparrows still gabbled in that maple every morning. “No thanks,” I said. “[MASK]’s room will be fine.”
<name>Sal</name>	Sal	John	She can’t buy herself away from them. A year won’t make any difference.” “Funny way of keeping her,” I said, “by having her S®- [MASK] shrugged. “The best way in the world, right now.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Bram	It was not the children, either, only the two and ten years apart. No. I will maintain until my dying day it was the lack of a foundation garment. What did [MASK] know of it? We had catalogues—I could have ordered corselettes.
<name>Mrs. Prothero</name>	Mrs. Prothero	Doris	Painted railing, then step and step, the small back porch, and finally the kitchen. [MASK] is at the front door, bidding her pastor a caroling farewell. Dimly, through halls, I hear her outpoured thanks for his emerald time, his diamond words.
<name>Beth</name>	Beth	Goodness	“I’m here. I’m here. Don’t shout so.” Running, she arrives. “[MASK], what a scare you gave us. We didn’t know—why, what’s the matter? You’re not crying, are you?”
<name>Mayor</name>	Mayor	Simmons	“You’re brazen enough, the pair of you, to go no further than the caragana hedge outside the [MASK]’ house.” I was a little sharp with him, I know, but he was accustomed to my ways, and wouldn’t have taken the words at their face value.
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	John	A man gets on by working harder than the rest—that’s what he used to say—and if he doesn’t get anywhere, he hasn’t a soul to blame but himself.” [MASK] was counting seeds into a cup, and not paying much attention, or not seeming to.
<name>Mawmaw</name>	Mawmaw	Doris	I gasp and flounder like a fish on the slimed boards of a dock. “Oh dear oh dear oh dear—” [MASK] bubbles wetly through her nose. She runs to lift me, and cannot. She heaves and strains like a calving cow.
<name>Death</name>	Death	Doris	Like two hens with a single chick, they fuss me into a chair. Into my hands is pushed a cup of tea. It tastes like hemlock. Even if it didn’t, though, I’d have to feel it did. [MASK] is right.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Doris	My fingers pleat my dress. “A nurse—why should I need a nurse?” [MASK] darts forward, her face not soft and flabby now, but peering earnestly. She gesticulates, as though she could convince me by this trembling of her hands.
<name>Alaska</name>	Alaska	Pride	[MASK] was my wilderness, and the demon that led me there was fear. I was alone, never anything else, and never free, for I carried my chains within me, and they spread out from me and shackled all I touched.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Dan	He brought it home—you and [MASK] must’ve been out, for I mind I was in the kitchen by myself—and he sat and looked at it for the longest time. It was enough to turn your stomach, its feathers covered with blood and the thing breathing very queerly.
<name>Nabokov</name>	Nabokov	Pharaoh	I was [MASK]’s daughter reluctantly returning to his roof, the square brick palace so oddly antimacassared in the wilderness, back to the hill where his monument stood, more dear to him, I believe, than the brood mare who lay beneath because she’d proved no match for his stud.
<name>Stanley</name>	Stanley	Marvin	“And who’ll do the laundry, I’d like to know? You, I suppose?” “I don’t know what in hell I’m supposed to do,” [MASK] says. “I’m caught between two fires.”
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	John	I never told [MASK]. I couldn’t. He kept on spinning his spiderwebs, and I could never bring myself to say a word. Instead, I tried to show him I believed in him. “Not everyone can start with money.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Drunk	[MASK], likely, and he froze. Nobody knew for sure.” “Good riddance to bad rubbish, if you ask me.” Yet that was only an automatic reply, made because it was expected of me and because I expected it of myself.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	John	“I hadn’t heard of that.” [MASK] often used to go out after dinner, and I’d waken and hear the car-buggy returning at daybreak, when the edge of sky was just being prized open by the early light, before even the sparrows had wakened.
