<name>someone</name>	someone	Souljah	We all went and got drinks and left [MASK] in the booth. By ten-thirty, the party was shoulder to shoulder. The music was loud. More than that, the music was crisp. It was the difference between a car radio, a house radio, a stereo system, and a club.
<name>Marcello</name>	Marcello	Joey	A half-hour later, the bedroom door opened. He stood in the entrance with a big smile. The same smile that I found so seductive. “Where are those dogs?” was the first question I asked. “I sent [MASK] to walk them.”
<name>he</name>	he	GS	The light wind that rushed through the door when I opened it made my nipples hard. They stuck out through my baby tee. My nipples might as well have been eyes ’cause when that door opened, that’s what [MASK] looked at first.
<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Lauren	Carefully I rolled and weaved it in and out of each toe to prepare for the pedicure I was about to give myself. “Going somewhere?” [MASK] asked. “Nah. This is just my routine. I like to keep myself nice.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Claudette	Your life will change.” “How much?” [MASK] asked. “For the face, hair, nails, and feet?” “Yeah, and the dress.” “Oh, you can’t afford this dress, it’s mine.
<name>Lisa</name>	Lisa	Simone	“Has anybody called for me?” “You should’ve asked security, you know they take all the messages. Anyway, I saw your girl [MASK] a few hours ago.” “What did she say?” “You know, the regular.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Lauren	I reached into my pocket and gave him one of my twenties to get him to start driving. As I looked to my right I saw [MASK]’s face disappear as the window curtain being held by her hand dropped back into place. We pulled off.
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Simone	But [MASK] took advantage of that split second when I looked away. Her big arm came swinging down, slicing a seven-inch gash on the left side of my face. I felt my face open up, I grabbed my head and blood was all over my fingers.
<name>Marion</name>	Marion	Curiosity	How did I know, because that’s what I was doing, standing in the window looking in their house. But their windows had curtains. The kitchen was clean, but nothing was in it. [MASK] made me open the refrigerator just enough to look in.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Lauren	Without saying anything [MASK]’s eyes dropped down to my Nike bag. “Oh yeah, I didn’t get a chance to see my mother yesterday. She was pretty upset so I’m going to see her right after the benefit finishes.”
<name>Tony</name>	Tony	Bullet	[MASK] placed the teddy bears in the backseat of the rental, next to the infant car seat. “Don’t fucking move,” he threatened me. I saw him signal to his man who was standing on a car watching the firefighters put out the fire.
<name>Kayla</name>	Kayla	Winter	Don’t try to play with me, [MASK]. You wasn’t checking on me either.” “Whatever. There’s no sense in wasting time,” I said. “ ’Cause time I don’t have a lot of. You look good to me.
<name>Mrs. Price</name>	Mrs. Price	Doc	Maybe the answer was on the second, third, or fourth floor. I pictured myself going to the pawnshop with an elephant tusk. I erased that thought. I knew [MASK] might have some jewelry down there in her apartment or maybe even a strongbox or safe.
<name>Janine</name>	Janine	Winter	The ones with the hard feet and the chipped nail polish. That’s what you’re used to,” I laughed. “And the ripped panties and dingy bras with the wire popping out and the stinking hairy underarms and—” “I got you, [MASK] ...
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Santiaga	I checked the number me and my mother wrote, and ran my finger down the row of numbers until I saw [MASK]’s number written again. I slid my finger across to the left side of the page to see the name of the visitor.
<name>Janine</name>	Janine	Magdalena	Who was that? She looks bad! Me and [MASK] tried to smile and make light of the situation. But that look of shock and horror that came over the kids’ faces when they saw her could not be erased by any joke.
<name>him</name>	him	Santiaga	The two officers with me greeted the three officers with [MASK], my father, who I had not laid eyes on in eight years. As soon as he turned to greet me, the tears came gushing out of my eyes, after so many years with no tears at all.
<name>them</name>	them	Santiaga	The waitress exhaled and left like we were gonna jerk her for her tip or something. “You don’t need to know what happened. Less is better.” “Well what will I tell [MASK]?”
<name>you</name>	you	Sexy	He laid me back down and talked me into a state of relaxation. After an hour or so I could float and dog paddle, but still I was no swimmer. “Don’t worry, [MASK], you’ll get the hang of it after a while.
<name>Jeannie</name>	Jeannie	Sasha	Then there will be just that one. Someone with a beautiful face like yours, [MASK], a perfect figure and pretty toes, and he’ll say yes to her. Or let’s say he’s faithful. Half the time he’ll be on the road.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Midnight	You can stay here if you want. You don’t look like the type to stay too long. But since you are family with [MASK], I don’t mind letting you stay until he calls. Then you two can hook up and take it from there.”
<name>he</name>	he	Will	As I sat there watching him crunching on his popcorn, I wondered, What is [MASK] really intoi Who is he? Did he have any value or purpose to me or was I just wasting my time? He obviously didn’t want to do business with me.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Sasha	I heard her moving around behind the two wide wooden doors. I knocked softly. There was no response, so 1 knocked a little harder. “How you doing, [MASK]?” she said in a pleasant voice, but looking distracted. “I was a little bored.
<name>Maya</name>	Maya	Souljah	“Come on, y’all,” she said, making it clear that we were to follow closely behind. In the bathroom, it was just us three. “Oh no,” [MASK] said, placing her two hands in her face.
<name>him</name>	him	Santiaga	I saw her eyes switch and her voice did too. “I saw [MASK],” I said. “He’s alright. He asked about you, of course. He wants you to come down to see him on Thursday. Dress your best he said.
<name>Starr</name>	Starr	Bullet	But this was the new model. As my ass fit into the soft grooves of the leather seat, [MASK] leaned over two inches from my face. “Where that nigga at?” “He’s been gone,” I told him, going right along with it.
<name>Sal</name>	Sal	Midnight	[MASK] owns a barbershop, can you believe it?” she said chuckling. “So what do you do? Where do you live now?” I asked her, cautiously. “Oh, I do a little bit of this, a little bit of that.
<name>Tony</name>	Tony	Santiaga	They shouldn’t be able to barge into our business and force their rules on us. Not when [MASK] knew his workers better than anybody from the outside. Everybody in this game understood what he was dealing with. Nobody forced them into this business. They understood the risks.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Midnight	I didn’t tell him I thought it was a stupid idea. We were already dealing with enough. But I wanted to check with you to see what happened. I know how you feel about [MASK].” I avoided her eyes.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Santiaga	[MASK] raised me to be strong. I’ll admit I had all those fucked-up scenes in my head from the movies like some squad of butch women dragging me out of my bed, fucking me up in the bathroom, and shoving a broomstick up my pussy.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Natalie	How the fuck was we getting to the show? I wondered to myself. Am / supposed to take a train, or walk, or hop out a yellow cab while [MASK] was styling in a Rover? Uh-uh. There had to be a better way.
<name>Deacon</name>	Deacon	Souljah	Then what?” Silence fell for three seconds. Then the girl said, “Then I’ll bust a cap in they ass.” Everybody laughed. [MASK] pulled out a blackboard and started gibbering about how we all a family. “We are all connected.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Souljah	Tomorrow we can arrange to pick up your clothes.” “No, that’s alright. I’m gonna go shopping for some things tomorrow.” “Oh, you do have money?” [MASK] asked. “A little something,” I said, smiling.
<name>Benny</name>	Benny	Will	“Alright, how much you working with.” “I got twenty-five hundred dollars,” I said proudly. [MASK] laughed and laughed and laughed. “What’s so fucking funny?” “I don’t even deal in those small sums of money.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Winter	“Then what happened?” she asked. I sucked my teeth and said, “What’s the sense in having all those papers in the folder about me if you gonna ask me what you already know?” “OK, [MASK].
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Midnight	Of course it only took a second before my girls had his boys distracted. I stepped up, licking my lips real slowly, and said rough and sexy-like, “What’s up [MASK], haven’t seen you in a while.”
<name>Elvis</name>	Elvis	Santiaga	When I told her I was broke, she started cursing and yelling about needing money to go and see [MASK]. Not wanting to give her anything from the last five hundred dollars in my pocket, I tried to humor her but she wasn’t going for it.
<name>man</name>	man	Winter	I don’t have no phone,” I told him. “C’mon, [MASK], don’t try to play me.” “I don’t. I haven’t been wanting no calls, that’s why. I just been staying to myself.”
<name>Janine</name>	Janine	Natalie	But on our last day there, [MASK], who had a way of finding out all and any dirt on anybody, said to me out of the blue, “I’m tryna get my mother to get our long distance turned back on so I can make long-distance calls.”
<name>the nurse</name>	the nurse	Bullet	The hungrier I got, the hungrier the dogs got. By midnight, they were growling and so was I. My stomach was roaring and the pills that the nurse had given me was wrecking me on a damn near empty belly. That night, [MASK] never came in.
<name>Becky</name>	Becky	Winter	“Yo, you must be an impostor. Where’s [MASK]? Nobody has to ask her twice to go shopping,” he said, flashing a rare smile. I laughed, grabbed my jacket and said in a sexy way, “I’m ready.”
<name>Keisha</name>	Keisha	Lashay	and [MASK] was giving your stuff out. from what I could see, they took everything, down to the barrettes and the face cream. Even the security guard was tryna get something out of the deal. But none of the clothes could fit her.
<name>Kima</name>	Kima	Winter	The way these motherfuckers got me stressed the shit could drop out right now. [MASK], listen, I might have to use the baby’s money for a lawyer anyhow. They sent some legal aid guy with a nervous twitch and a nasty skin problem.
<name>Bernice</name>	Bernice	Krazy	“Nah, if there’s one thing I know, it’s my sister. She had a few bad relationships in the past. Now her legs is [MASK] Glued shut. Funny thing is, she got more niggas coming and calling since she stopped fucking.
<name>Alaska</name>	Alaska	Phoenix	“Were just listening to what you believe.” “My name is [MASK],” the next girl said. “I’m not tryna impress nobody, and I don’t know what I believe.” “What do you live for?”
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Humph	Remember that.” [MASK], I thought to myself, is that supposed to be some kind of flicking answer or something? The suite was immaculate, top-of-the-line. I couldn’t of asked for more if I was on a honeymoon.
<name>Debbie</name>	Debbie	Lauren	I can tell you’re very smart. You’re quick on your feet. You seem very creative, maybe that’s the direction you want to go in?” “Creative?” I repeated. “Yes. I saw how you did [MASK]’s nails.
<name>Myrtle</name>	Myrtle	Magdalena	Tell her I said pull herself together and get down here on Thursday in her best shit so I can show her off.” [MASK] had her stuff packed and at the door when I reached home. Her face was serious and fed up. “What’s up?”
<name>Shanaynay</name>	Shanaynay	Simone	“As fucked up as the world is today, the baby will need some Thug passion just to be able to roll with the punches.” We cracked up. [MASK] couldn’t take it no more and laughed so hard she accidentally pissed on herself.
<name>She</name>	She	Souljah	You’ll look up five to ten years later and you’ll have nothing. So what do you think?” [MASK] asked. “Think about what?” “When are you going to the hospital to see your mother?” she asked, changing the topic.
<name>he</name> (There is no proper name mentioned in the passage)	he (There is no proper name mentioned in the passage)	Phil	When finally he introduced us, it seemed that we barely said peace to one another, yet we looked into each other’s eyes, forgetting to drop hands from our initial shake. I’d be lying ifI said I was surprised when [MASK] asked me ifhe could pass you my phone number.
<name>Green</name>	Green	Shulman	She went into her front pocket on her multicolored dress, pulled out a small key, and unlocked the gate. “What’s your name?” she asked. “Winter [MASK],” I said proudly. “Are you married?” she asked.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Santiaga	He just had a natural suspicion about everything. One slight thing triggering his intuition would cause the whole thing to get shut down. I waited in the kitchen Monday night for him to come home. “[MASK], how you feeling?” I asked sweetly.
<name>Rastafarians</name>	Rastafarians	Africans	I made myself laugh, thinking. Them damn [MASK] must of been some fucked up niggas. If they believed doing something positive caused positive things to happen why are their asses all fucked up bald-headed, naked, starving, stinking, and the whole nine.
<name>Paris</name>	Paris	Souljah	[MASK]’s VIP, she gets invited to everything, concerts, parties, dinners—she knows everybody. The thing is, unless she has a special reason she really doesn’t go. So we get to use the invites and meet everybody who’s anybody.”
<name>my</name>	my	Santiaga	His eyes locked into each of our eyes individually. He was making good sense but I was still vexed. I figured, yeah sounds good and all but I’m not down with the idea of running from a fight. It’s just straight up not [MASK] style.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Souljah	When there’s food here you can eat it. [MASK] will share almost everything. Other than that, just expect her to try to get your life together whether you like it or want to or not. Don’t try to stop her. It’s in her blood.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Simone	People always seemed to have stupid suggestions. On my first free day, I hooked up with [MASK]. We had talked regularly on the phone, but only about business because time was limited. There was only one phone on my floor and everyone wanted to use it.
<name>Claudia</name>	Claudia	Winter	Tears of anger filled my eyes. "Don’t be stupid, [MASK]. You think I’ma call some authorities into my crib. That nosy lady been snooping all around my house. You think I want some more police, and heat in my place.
<name>Grandpa</name>	Grandpa	Santiaga	We took family photos together and [MASK] gave me a charm bracelet with a 24-karat gold elephant. Every year until I was twelve he gave me a new gold animal. When I turn thirteen, I turned the charm bracelet into a necklace.
<name>Malcolm</name>	Malcolm	Souljah	Look [MASK], I dig you, but you’re fooling yourself. Niggas ain’t never going to be unified. You put all your time into organizing niggas yet you lock out the nigga who’s real with you, me. What do you want from me?
<name>Bridgette</name>	Bridgette	Doc	’Cause I hate that shit. How does she pay her bills? People just give her shit. She’s supposed to pay [MASK] rent. She doesn’t. She’s just different. Don’t try and figure her out. You’ll only give yourself a headache.”
<name>Miss Clara</name>	Miss Clara	Mamma	He wants you to come down to see him on Thursday. Dress your best he said. He wants to show you off.” [MASK] cried. The twins were divided. “We don’t like to do it, but all of our facilities are overburdened.
<name>Lindsay</name>	Lindsay	Lauren	Wet lips looked even more enticing, and the more the scene sucked me in the more I liked it. Me and [MASK] stuck together. We were looking for the celebrities. We weren’t sure where they were. But we knew they were here.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Natalie	“He’s alright. His girl just had a baby. It’s a boy, eight pounds, six ounces, big huh?” “His girl! [MASK] you didn’t tell me he had a girl.” “Like you would’ve cared.
<name>my cousin</name>	my cousin	Santiaga	After thinking about it, I knew it was important for me to get this package up to him. I needed to show that [MASK] got family on the outside checking for him. There would be no surprises on my next visit.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Lauren	She looked like she was recalling images in her mind. The loud doorbell broke her mood and deaded my question. Without her even asking me to get the door, I zipped down the stairs. [MASK] was standing there with a big smile on her face.
<name>Slick</name>	Slick	Toshi	I checked [MASK] cheating as usual. She had them tricks down pat. She’d have you talking about the juiciest shit while her hands were switching shit around. Meanwhile she would use those eyes to signal to her partner.
<name>his daughter</name>	his daughter	Porsche	He’s talking about I can go and see [MASK] tomorrow but it will be a supervised visit. We can’t leave the facility with her. These people tryna treat me like I did something wrong, like I’m some type of child molester or pervert or something.”
<name>Bella</name>	Bella	Simone	Meanwhile, I found the perfect outfit with shoes to match. It killed me to pay the grand total of five hundred dollars, although it was a savings from my usual sprees. [MASK] finally came out the bathroom. The cashier handed me my change.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Rashida	It was so wide and heavy that it opened slowly. “How are you, [MASK],” the miniature lady asked. Once inside the door we were faced with another door, lighter in weight, that the girl swung right open. Parquet floors with color designs.
<name>Precious</name>	Precious	Claudette	She had the jheri curl grease colliding with the Vaseline on her face. She had greasy lotions for her hands and feet, and in general always looked wet. Her name was [MASK]. There was no worse nightmare than the clothes she wore.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Winter	“Where was you going?” he questioned me further. “I don’t know, nowhere,” I lied. “Why you be lying so much, [MASK]?” “What?” I stalled to arrange my defense in my own head.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Souljah	[MASK] asked, her eyes leaving my eyes and landing on my bedroom slippers. “It ain’t nothin’. Just some jealous girls at the place where I stay. They don’t matter though, ’cause in two months I’ll be eighteen and then I can get my own place.”
<name>Samuel</name>	Samuel	Souljah	“There is where [MASK] is.” She knocked lightly on the half-open door and pushed her way in like she lived there. “You can sit there.” She directed me to a basic wooden chair near a small table.
<name>Betty</name>	Betty	Lauren	While she strutted around all proud, [MASK] and I would know that she didn’t really have it all as tight as she thought she did. After all, she let me slide that ace right out of her hand. Stuffing envelopes and answering phones was not my line of work.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Bullet	When I remembered nobody was supposed to be home I turned them both off. I started checking everything [MASK] had. Don’t ask me why. I just figured I had a right to. I was looking under the beds, in the closets, in drawers.
<name>privacy</name>	privacy	Magdalena	Other than [MASK], security, and the workers, we couldn’t invite no houseguests. Now I needed to come up with a compromise, an alternative. This date was something I needed in order to connect with myself and my people. I really needed the attention.
<name>Bodie</name>	Bodie	Santiaga	You don’t have no crew holding you down, then where’s the threat? What’s gonna prevent any nigga from jerking you, robbing you, killing you? [MASK]’s gone, his whole crew is gone. It was good while it lasted.
<name>Winter</name>	Winter	Bullet	“What’s up, baby?” I asked softly, immediately noting the aggravation in the businessman’s face. “Winter. Happy Birthday, girl. You official now?” [MASK] was hyper and happy. Oh shit, I forgot it was my birthday.
<name>Beyoncé</name>	Beyoncé	Natalie	You should see it, it’s phat. [MASK] gon be acting up. Nobody gonna be able to say shit to her tonight. That nigga bought the whole box seat section for the show. He began lacing her lovely with all the butters every since they hooked up.”
<name>She</name>	She	Lauren	She came and introduced herself. Her eyes bounced around the room while she talked. I guess she was checking to see if I messed with any of her shit. “So what are you in for?” [MASK] asked. “What?”
<name>Trudy</name>	Trudy	Souljah	It’s real hectic in here. We can’t talk now.” She closed the door in a hurry. As I turned the knob to [MASK]’s apartment, I wished that I had not. I walked right into one of those womanhood meetings.
<name>God’s</name>	God’s	Bullet	We walked with the dogs, who, in [MASK]’s presence, somehow turned friendly—two-faced bitches. “I gotta make a run. I’m taking you with me.” I smiled ’cause I like to travel.
<name>anyone</name>	anyone	GS	I ran my hands along the wall trying to guide myself to the light switch. Accidentally I tripped over what I guessed was a Timberland boot tossed on the floor. Now I was glad the lights were off. I didn’t want [MASK] to see me in an uncool position.
<name>him</name> (There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to a pronoun)	him (There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to a pronoun)	Santiaga	“I told [MASK] not to worry. I would come to get him out. Then one of them smart-ass cops, not the one in regular uniform, one of them feds or something, said it would be a long, long, long time before you’ll see him anywhere besides behind bars.
<name>Stand-up comedian</name>	Stand-up comedian	Souljah	“I could see if you were gonna see a show,” I went on. “Then at least you get what you pay for. You going to listen to somebody talk shit. [MASK] gets paid. You get nothing, stupid ass!”
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Rashida	“What’s up, girl?” I asked [MASK], trying to get things between me and her back to normal by striking up a little conversation. “A letter came for you,” she said dryly. “It’s on your bed.”
<name>Tony</name>	Tony	Coke	“OK, other than the hundred and fifty thousand dollars they stole from our safe, for evidence they said. Ha! Evidence. They’re probably out shopping with that dough right now. They took the guns. They took plenty of guns.” “[MASK]?”
<name>Curtis</name>	Curtis	Sarge	“You fine. Come on, get in.” We checked an action flick. Don’t ask me the title. We was mostly tonguing, feeling each other up, and giving each other shotguns with [MASK]’s bag of weed.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Mamma	Now I needed to come up with a compromise, an alternative. This date was something I needed in order to connect with myself and my people. I really needed the attention. [MASK] had been hogging all of it up lately.
<name>John</name>	John	Midnight	[MASK] is my first cousin. We grew up together. He moved away and I haven’t heard from him. My mother practically raised him. I need him to get in touch with my mom right away, just in case anything happens with her illness, you know?”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Santiaga	They came from everywhere without warning, up the driveway, out of the sky, the roof, the backyard. Before I knew it, they were inside the house, outside the house, all in everything like roaches. They arrested everybody, [MASK], our security, everybody except me and the kids.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Alice	Contestant number three: What was [MASK]’s, the maid in The Brady Bunch, boyfriend’s name, and what job did he do?” “Oh, I don’t know.” The security guards was laughing so hard they was bent over.
<name>unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Santiaga	“What!” I said. “Now, listen to you,” he said. “Ten minutes ago you were saying just tell me the plan, I’m down for you [MASK]. Now you’re ready to betray me.”
<name>Cheryl</name>	Cheryl	Tiffany	“I already ate. I’m not hungry.” [MASK] dipped two fries in the ketchup and said, “That’s it for me.” Searching through her oversized MCM pocketbook, she finally found her lipstick. “Let’s go to the bathroom.”
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	GS	I just shrugged my shoulders. “Come on!” she continued. “When you answered the door last night and seen [MASK], tell me you didn’t freak out for a minute and just lose your cool?” “Nope,” I fronted.
<name>Raymond</name>	Raymond	Sterling	but she wasn’t going for it. I know how locked in on an idea she could get, so I promised I would go through my belongings at “[MASK]’s mother’s house” and try to pull together some cash.
<name>Shaniqua</name>	Shaniqua	Simone	I saw the terror in her face. I followed, knowing she ain’t the slick type. “[MASK] is going to kill you, well maybe not kill you—Well maybe not kill you, but hurt you real bad. She has a gun.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Souljah	Once everybody gets a little bit of money in their pockets, then all of us will feel a little better.” Then [MASK] moved to shut her down even though at least half of us could feel what that female was kicking.
