<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Andrey	“May I bring you a slice of plum tart with our compliments ... ?” "Thank you for the thought, [MASK]. Normally, I would leap at the chance. But tonight, I am otherwise committed.”
<name>Mina</name>	Mina	Sofia	Is this your secret room?” “It is our secret room,” the Count replied. [MASK] nodded gravely to show that she understood. But then children understand the purpose of secret rooms better than they understand the purpose of congresses, courtrooms, and banks.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Anna	That is, until the door opened and [MASK] stepped onto the landing. In a state of disbelief, the Count remounted the stairs. "What are you doing?” he whispered. "I need to go to the lobby,” she replied.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Oleg	Before the Count could reply, there was a knock at the door. “Ah,” she said. “Here we are." Swinging the door open, she stepped aside to let [MASK] from room service pass.
<name>Renault</name>	Renault	Emile	The three men laughed, until [MASK] pointed his chopper at his colleagues: "But well deserved.” "Oh, absolutely.” “Without a doubt.” The three were quiet, each lost for a moment in their respective memories of the City of Light.
<name>his old friend</name>	his old friend	Mishka	Instead, he remained in his study, lost in thought. Given the circumstances, an observer might understandably have drawn the conclusion that as the Count sat there he was dwelling on memories of his old friend. But, in fact, he was no longer thinking about [MASK].
<name>his daughter</name>	his daughter	Sofia	Had he felt pride in [MASK] before? Of course he had. On a daily basis. He was proud of her success in school, of her beauty, of her composure, of the fondness with which she was regarded by all who worked in the hotel.
<name>Montresor</name>	Montresor	Mishka	“A man of another time,” [MASK] said, not without reverence, returning the picture to its shelf. Then the bottle was opened, the wine was poured, and the two old friends raised their glasses on high.
<name>James</name>	James	Audrius	But here we are. Shall I press for the fifth floor?" The Count, who found himself standing in front of the elevator, looked at the bartender in shock. “But, [MASK], I have never taken the lift in my life!”
<name>she</name>	she	Nina	“Yes, you were right,” she said. “It is some kind of crane.” But as soon as the guest had let himself into his room, [MASK] forged ahead. Moving at a brisk pace along the carpet, they passed rooms 313,314, and 315.
<name>Irene</name>	Irene	Sofia	But tonight, things were going to be different— because by the casualness of [MASK]’s wave, the Count could tell the game was afoot. I’ve got her now, he thought as he passed the second floor with a sinister little laugh.
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Audrius	As if on cue, [MASK] placed it on the bar. The captain took a sip and gave another sigh, this one of satisfaction. Then he studied the Count for a moment. "Are you Russian?” “To the core.” "
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Emile	“It is in the shape of a piano,” he added. As [MASK] produced his chopper from his apron string and proceeded to slice the cake, the Count took two more glasses from the Ambassador and filled them with champagne.
<name>Anastasia</name>	Anastasia	Nina	After all, I am practically a youth like you. No, by ‘elders,’ I meant the gray haired.” [MASK] nodded to express her understanding. “You mean the grand dukes and grand duchesses.” “Well, yes. Certainly them.
<name>Rostov</name>	Rostov	Emile	And at whose request are you taking a quarterly inventory . .. ?” As this exchange between the Bishop and the maitre d’ unfolded, the Count noticed that [MASK], who had grown pale at the inward swinging of the door, was regaining his color second by second.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Sofia	“Do you need me to .. . accompany you inside?” he asked, after leading her down the hallway. [MASK] shook her head and disappeared behind the washroom door. As he waited, the Count chastised himself for his lug-headedness.
<name>college</name>	college	Adam	He was the first to lend a book or an umbrella to an acquaintance (never mind that no acquaintance since [MASK] had returned a book or an umbrella). And routines? He had prided himself on never having one. He would breakfast at 10:00 a.m.
<name>Natasha</name>	Natasha	Nina	The handsome captain made a similar gesture, presumably offering to accompany her, but [MASK] shook his hand just as soberly as she had shaken the Count’s and then walked across the square in the general direction of historical necessity. ★ “Isn’t that more of a cream than a pearl?”
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Richard	When [MASK] left, the Count looked once around the room to see if there was anyone he knew, and was pleased to discover that the young architect from the Piazza was at a table in the corner, bent over his sketchbook, presumably rendering the bar.
<name>Job</name>	Job	Emile	For what the Lord giveth, is precisely what he cometh later to taketh away. But if [MASK]’s face expressed an almost sacrilegious indignation at his friend’s condition, the Bishop’s expressed the grimace of the inconvenienced.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Mishka	Then she went out the door. Returning to his chair, the Count sat in silence. After a few minutes, he took up [MASK]’s legacy, untied the twine, and folded back the paper. Inside there was a small volume bound in leather.
<name>Madeline</name>	Madeline	Nina	But then, as every child knows, the drumbeat of the season must sound from within. And there, at her usual table by the fountain, was [MASK] with a dark green ribbon tied around the waist of her bright yellow dress.
<name>his</name>	his	Stanislav	“What is that you’re whistling?” Admittedly, there has been a melody playing in [MASK]’s head—a little something that he had heard the night before while passing the entrance of the hotel’s bar—but he had not been conscious of whistling it.
<name>Agostino</name>	Agostino	Emile	"No doubt,” said the concierge, in the manner of a librarian agreeing with a scholar. Earlier that day, in fact, the first strawberries of the season had arrived in the kitchen and [MASK] had slipped a handful to the Count for his breakfast the following morning.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sofia	"What’s that?” "It is your turn to look, and my turn to hide.” “No, you see, in this game I always do the hiding and you always do the hunting.” [MASK] studied the Count as her mother would have.
<name>Euclid</name>	Euclid	Nina	"Do you know what a prime number is?” “As in two, three, five, seven, eleven, thirteen ... ?" “Exactly,” said [MASK]. “Those whole numbers that are indivisible by any number other than one and itself.”
<name>his wife</name>	his wife	Sofia	When he was done, the Count put the letters in the drawer, he brushed his teeth, he donned his pajamas, and then, despite the fact that [MASK] was gone, he slept on the mattress under the bedsprings.
<name>brandy</name>	brandy	Armagnac	“A glass of [MASK], perhaps.” A moment later, as the Count gave the brandy in his snifter a swirl, he found himself smiling at the aide-de-camp's portrayal—which in turn led him to reflect on the personality of Americans in general.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Nina	And that is exactly what it was for the Count: a delightful surprise. For he had not seen [MASK] in over two years; and many had been the time that he had passed the card room or the ballroom and found himself wondering where she was and what she was doing.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Sasha	"A solution is close at hand.” Out in the garden, as the Count closed his eyes to begin moving through the individual permutations one by one, his sister enjoyed making light of his task. “Why do you furrow your brow so, [MASK]?
<name>Vladimir</name>	Vladimir	Alexander	It was about a foot square and six inches high with a handle in leather and clasps of chrome. Taped on top was a note addressed to him in an unfamiliar script. Pulling the note free, the Count unfolded it and read: [MASK], What a pleasure meeting you tonight.
<name>Jacob</name>	Jacob	Andrey	Under what?” "Did you say ‘the big top’?” Yes. In point of fact: the circus. Raised by a widowed father who was prone to drunken violence, at the age of sixteen [MASK] had run away to join a traveling circus.
<name>James</name>	James	Richard	Giving the nod of one who could make do with "rakish,” [MASK] took another look in the mirror, then pulled the tie loose, hung his tuxedo jacket on the back of his chair, and was about to suggest a nightcap when there was a knock at the door.
<name>Renfield</name>	Renfield	Mishka	As in the past, [MASK] talked with a fevered intensity, almost as if he were making his points to himself. But once he had spoken his piece, he looked across the table and saw the distressed expression on the Count’s face.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Sofia	This little implement in the shape of an egret, which had been so prized by her father’s sister, had clearly been designed for snipping, not shearing. The rings cut into the knuckles of [MASK]’s thumb and forefinger as she tried and failed to cut through lengths of her hair.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	liana	Gently raising her head, the Count could see the gash above her brow. Her skull did not appear compromised, but she was bleeding and unconscious. [MASK] was behind him now, in tears. “I will go for a doctor,” she said.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Anna	"I think you have a new freckle,” he said. "What!” [MASK] tried to look over her own shoulder. "Don’t worry,” he assured. “It’s nice.” “Where is it?”
<name>the doorman</name>	the doorman	Rodion	Over the doorman’s shoulder, he could see four of them parked fifty feet from the entrance, waiting for the last of the Shalyapin’s customers. Two drivers at the front of the line were smoking and chatting. Before [MASK] could raise his whistle to his lips, the Count was running toward them.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sofia	The Count hesitated. And then with a touch of trepidation, he asked: "Is everything all right?” [MASK] looked up, a little surprised. Then seeing how grave her father’s expression was, she smiled.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Mishka	In the interests of realism, [MASK] tried to stand on the banquette, nearly knocking over his beer. He settled for a seated oration with a finger in the air: Suddenly—I shone in all my might, and morning rang its round.
<name>author</name>	author	Count	Of the six objects, the teacup was the [MASK]’s personal favorite. It not only made a satisfying smash upon impact, but in the immediate after-math one could hear the shards of porcelain skidding across the floor like acorns across the ice.
<name>sir</name>	sir	Andrey	“A party of two tonight, isn’t it?” “I’m afraid it’s going to be a party of one, [MASK].” "Nonetheless, it is our pleasure to have you. Your table should be ready in just a few minutes."
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Alexander	There was a moment of silence. “[MASK], I am sorry that this fellow died in battle; but I think I can safely say that you have assumed more than your share of guilt for these events.”
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Marina	You will go back into the bedroom and count to two hundred. I shall remain in order to hide this within the boundaries of the study.” Then, as if from thin air, the Count produced the silver thimble that [MASK] had given him. "
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Sofia	Time is passing ...” said the Count. "Me,” said [MASK]. "What!” With a tilt of her head she held out the white stripe from her long black hair. “But you’re not an animal.”
<name>Andrei</name>	Andrei	Andrey	He was about to explain to his new neighbor the cause of his unexpected arrival, when from the hallway came the delicate clearing of a throat. Without turning, the Count could tell that this was [MASK], the maitre d’ of the Boyarsky, for it was his trademark interruption.
<name>he</name>	he	Sofia	After all, it was really just a matter of making some minor adjustments—a rearranging of some furniture and a shifting of some habits. Since [MASK] was too young to be left alone, he would eventually need to find someone who could sit with her while he was at work.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Anna	And having let herself into her room on the fourth floor, [MASK] would change into a simple dress (after hanging her gown in the closet), make herself comfortable with a book, and wait for the Count to arrive.
<name>Sonya</name>	Sonya	Nina	In fact, as they approached the Tushins', the driver slowed the horses and looked to the Princess for instruction. . . . Here the Count paused for effect. “Well,'' [MASK] asked, "what did she do?”
<name>She</name>	She	Nina	Carefully noting the datum in its corresponding square, oft a separate sheet of paper [MASK] divided the figure by a factor, carried its remainder, subtracted the difference, and so on and so forth, until she rounded the solution to the second decimal.
<name>Valjean</name>	Valjean	Andrey	The two men stared at each other. "Perhaps you could ask [MASK] to stop by for a moment.” "Of course,” said the Bishop, backing away with an ecclesiastical bow. The Count drummed the tabletop with his fingers. Of course, he says.
<name>Renfield</name>	Renfield	Sofia	In the alley, there will be two men waiting who will take you back to the hotel.” "I can’t leave [MASK],” said the Count. "You have to, I’m afraid. But your concern is perfectly understandable.
<name>Monte Cristo</name>	Monte Cristo	Montaigne	the Count demanded of [MASK]. "One step forward and two steps back?” Intent upon showing who was master of whom, the Count vowed that he would not look up from the book again until he had reached the twenty-fifth essay.
<name>Nina</name>	Nina	Sofia	Finding [MASK] still at the piano, he took a seat at her side with his back to the keys. They were both silent. "Why didn’t you tell me you were studying piano?’’ the Count asked after a moment.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Sasha	So do you know what I did, [MASK]? Can you even imagine?” One might well draw the conclusion, that a man prone to pacing is a man who will act judiciously—given the unusual amount of time he has allocated to the consideration of causes and consequences, of ramifications and repercussions.
<name>Florence</name>	Florence	Galilei	Thus, in the ballroom of the Metropol Hotel on the twenty-first of June 1926, was the heretic, Galileo of [MASK], vindicated by a ping, a splat, a smash, a thunk, a thump, and a thud.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Marina	“Isn’t it astounding.” And when seen in that light, who could disagree? ★ A few minutes later, the Count was knocking on the office door of [MASK], the shy delight, while holding a folded newspaper at the back of his pants.
<name>Briony</name>	Briony	Helena	It is the spring of 1914, and I return to the family estate for a visit. Having paid my respects to my grandmother in the library, I venture outside in search of my sister, [MASK], who likes to read under the great elm at the bend in the river.
<name>Van Gogh</name>	Van Gogh	Montaigne	“Come in, come in. Have a seat.” Waving [MASK]’s masterpiece at the one-eyed cat (who leapt to the floor with a hiss), the Count offered his guest the high-back chair and took the desk chair for himself.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Nina	But in point of fact, he has only exposed himself to a glimpse of life on the ship—having utterly ignored those lower levels that teem with life and make the passage possible. [MASK] had not contented herself with the views from the upper decks.
<name>Mr. Black</name>	Mr. Black	Nina	Taking the steps one at a time (as had been his habit since 1952), he ascended to the fourth floor, traversed the hallway, and stopped before the twenty-eighth door. Easing two fingers into the ticket pocket of his vest, he extracted [MASK]'s key.
<name>Nina</name>	Nina	Nina	Simply put, the Count found political discourse of any persuasion to be tedious. But then, wasn’t that exactly what a fuddy-duddy would argue ... ? Needless to say, the Count followed [MASK] up the stairs to the second floor.
<name>Galahad</name>	Galahad	Emile	And when he set the four knives in motion, [MASK] leaned back in his chair and with a tear in his eye watched as his trusted blade tumbled effortlessly through space, feeling that this moment, this hour, this universe could not be improved upon.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Nina	Setting his book and his port aside, the Count placed [MASK]’s gift in his lap with his fingers on the dark green bow and listened to the tolling of the clock. Only with the twelfth and final chime did he pull the ribbon’s ends.
<name>Mozart</name>	Mozart	Sofia	Would it be viewed by the judges as insufficiently weighty for the times? When [MASK] had selected the composition, the Count had attempted to signal his concerns diplomatically, by referring to the piece as "pleasant” and "quite diverting”; and then he had kept his peace.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Sofia	She yawned. Once in his room, the Count sat [MASK] on his bed, put her knapsack on the Grand Duke’s desk, and then told her he would be right back. He walked down the hall and retrieved a winter blanket from his trunk.
<name>Mina</name>	Mina	Marina	The two looked at each other with the wistful smiles of those who know the hour has come. “Enter," said the Count. It was [MASK], in her hat and coat. "I’m sorry if I’m late.” “No, no.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Sofia	For in both tone and intent, when [MASK] posed this question she did not do so as a child asks a parent, but as one adult asks another about the choices he has made. So the Count gave the question its due consideration.
<name>Babushka</name>	Babushka	Emile	He would be disembarking in a few blocks anyway—to get some cucumbers and potatoes at the peasant market in the square. [MASK] had given him half a pound of minced pork, and he was going to make kotlety for his wife.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Andrey	Letting himself inside, [MASK] called out to his wife, though he knew she wouldn’t be home. She would be waiting in line at the new milk store that had opened in a decommissioned church on the other side of the neighborhood.
<name>The AI</name>	The AI	Cruelty	“Of course,” said the Bishop. [MASK] knows that it has no need of histrionics. It can be as calm and quiet as it likes. It can sigh, or lightly shake its head in disbelief, or offer a sympathetic apology for whatever it must do.
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Stalin	“Shot a portrait of [MASK]. Well. He does sound like a rather ruthless fellow... .” “Yes, sir. And, if I may say so, wily. For it appears that two nights ago a Finnish passport and Finnish currency were stolen from one of the hotel’s Finnish guests.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Sofia	But after two circuits, the little silver thimble had yet to reveal itself. So he began to search a bit more in earnest. Taking a page from [MASK]’s book, he divided the room into quadrants and reviewed them systematically, but to no avail.
<name>Dr. Wilson</name>	Dr. Wilson	Antonovich	It took him a few moments to realize that in the preceding minutes the hallway had been cleared: the two gurneys with their sleeping patients were gone. The door at the end of the hallway suddenly swung open to admit [MASK], who was now in scrubs and whistling.
<name>The Countess</name>	The Countess	Alexander	"Of course, [MASK],” she replied. "What is it?" “How many suitcases do you travel with?” A few minutes later, the Count was hurrying down the staff stairwell-two Parisian traveling cases in hand.
<name>Ann</name>	Ann	Nina	Systematic in all matters of importance, [MASK] ate her ice cream one flavor at a time, moving from the lightest to the darkest in shade. Thus, having already dispatched her French vanilla, she was now moving on to a scoop of lemon, which perfectly matched her dress.
<name>Robette</name>	Robette	Audrius	The Count’s reverie was broken by the sound of a bottle being placed on the bar. “Absinthe Robette,” said [MASK], tilting the bottle so that the Count could read the label. “But I’m afraid there’s only an ounce or two left.”
<name>Oscar</name>	Oscar	Osip	Is it not possible that our reverence for all the statues and cathedrals and ancient institutions was precisely what was holding us back?” [MASK] paused, taking a moment to refill their glasses with wine. “But where do we stand now? How far have we come?
<name>Edmond</name>	Edmond	Nina	Looking up, the Count discovered a boy [MASK]’s age crouching in their old perch behind the balustrade. Simply though neatly dressed, the boy had wide eyes and an expression that was earnest and attentive. Along the balustrade were lined a series of objects of different shapes and sizes.
<name>Mr. Hattersley</name>	Mr. Hattersley	Anna	So having lugged them back upstairs (with a healthy measure of huffing and puffing), he stacked, hoisted, pulled, and perched until the room was ready. Then, having returned [MASK]’s cases, he dashed down the stairs.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Martyn	What are you doing up? it was meant to say. Were you so profligate with your daylight that you must hunt about for things to do in the dark? “Your veal.” "Ah. Thank you, [MASK].”
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Nina	Adieu It is a fact of human life that one must eventually choose a philosophy. Or such was the opinion of the Count, as he stood before his old windows in suite 317, having slipped inside with the help of [MASK]’s key.
<name>Countess'</name>	Countess'	Bishop	He didn’t get up and walk about, or read the evening edition. Nor did he check the time on the [MASK]’s watch. If asked in advance to imagine what sitting there under these circumstances would feel like, the Count would have predicted a definite sense of anxiety.
<name>Count</name>	Count	Alexander	For his grandmother, who tended to ask the question when the Count had said something particularly scandalous, What is to become of you, [MASK]? was an admission to all in earshot that here was her favorite, so you needn’t expect her to rein in his behavior.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Richard	I’d forgotten all about it.” [MASK] crossed the room to one of the bookcases. Standing on his tiptoes, he reached to the uppermost shelf and removed what looked like a large book—but which turned out to be a package wrapped in brown paper.
<name>Sabina</name>	Sabina	Marina	"Then you must trust in her. And even if she is single-minded to a fault, you must trust that life will find her in time. For eventually, it finds us all.” The Count nodded for a moment, reflecting on [MASK]’s position.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Sasha	"Ah. There you are, [MASK].” The instant the Count recognized his old friend, his first thought was that he would have to send him on his way. What else was he to do? There were no two ways about it.
<name>Juan</name>	Juan	Andrey	With the instincts of convicts who discover the gates of their prison open, the individual oranges rolled in every direction to maximize their chances of escape. In a flash, [MASK] had extended his arms in a grand circumference to fence them in.
<name>Nina</name>	Nina	Sofia	"Indeed, I am.” When [MASK] came in, the Count expected her to scamper about the room willy-nilly, looking every which way. Instead, she remained in the doorway and quietly, almost unsettlingly, studied the room from quadrant to quadrant.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Rostov	“Are you [MASK]?” "Yes,” said the Count, astounded. “Tell me when and how this happened. Be as precise as you can.” “She fell while running up a staircase. I think she hit her head on the edge of the landing.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Charles	It was eight months later.” [MASK] looked confused. “Eight months later ... ?” “Yes. In February 1915. You see, ever since my youth I had been known for my marksmanship, and I had every intention of shooting the brute in the heart.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Nina	"What do we have here?” asked the Count. [MASK] looked uncharacteristically flummoxed. “I don’t think I’ve been inside.” The Count tried the knob. "Ah, well. I’m afraid that it’s locked.”
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Anna	But I am a guest in the hotel.” "That is my point exactly. The service stair is reserved for those who serve. Right down the hallway is a glamorous staircase reserved for the glamorous.” [MASK] smiled and took a step toward the Count.
<name>He</name>	He	Nina	But once I have established myself, I’ll come back for her.” [MASK] had explained these developments as one reports a series of scientific outcomes—a succession of facts that warranted our fear and indignation as much as would the laws of gravity or motion.
<name>Madame Curie</name>	Madame Curie	Sofia	[MASK] laughed. Then the Count wagged a finger in the manner of one who has remembered something else. “Later, when your mother was thirteen or fourteen, she would come here to enact experiments .. "Experiments!” "Your mother was not one to take anything on faith.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Sofia	When [MASK] had gone off to meet a friend, the Count went to the Piazza and treated himself to a glass of wine with lunch—something that he had done on a daily basis in his thirties and had rarely done since. Given the morning’s revelations, it seemed only appropriate.
<name>Mina</name>	Mina	Sofia	He would just have to be careful not to step on her, should he wake in the night. But the Count needn’t have worried about stepping on [MASK]. For when he returned to his room with the blanket, she had already climbed under his covers and fallen asleep.
<name>he</name>	he	Osip	Or so [MASK] argued, until he discovered the genre of American movies that would come to be known as film noir. With rapt attention he watched the likes of This Gun for Hire, Shadow of a Doubt, and Double Indemnity. "What is this?”
<name>the sous-chef</name>	the sous-chef	Stanislav	Along the wooden tables the junior chefs are chopping carrots and onions as [MASK], the sous-chef, delicately debones pigeons with a whistle on his lips. On the great stoves, eight burners have been lit to simmer sauces, soups, and stews.
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Emile	Then after a brief pause, he set the spheres in motion. In all honesty, the Count and [MASK] had been skeptical of their old friend’s claim; but as soon as he began, they could only wonder that they had not guessed at it before.
