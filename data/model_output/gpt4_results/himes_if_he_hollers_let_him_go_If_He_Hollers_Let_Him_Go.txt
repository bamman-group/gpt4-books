<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Kelly	He had slipped in unnoticed. Air began lumping in my chest and my eyes started burning. I looked at [MASK]. I ought to bust him right on the side of his scrawny red neck, I thought. I’d kill him as sure as hell.
<name>Yvette</name>	Yvette	Alice	I asked before he could get it out. ‘I’ll see,’ he said, getting up. ‘You know, this house is so arranged we can go for days without running into each other.’ He went into the hallway and called, '[MASK]!'
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Bob	‘It’s you and I now, [MASK]. Don’t you understand? In the things you do and the decisions you make you just can’t think of yourself alone. You have to consider our future. Is that too much to ask?’
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Kelly	She looked inquiringly at [MASK] again, but he didn’t look up. I walked out with the print. She called, ‘Hey!’ indecisively, but I didn’t look around. A white helper was soldering a seam in a trunk while a white mechanic looked on.
<name>Marilyn</name>	Marilyn	Alice	The girls would certainly have to look like [MASK]; if they didn’t I’d never forgive myself. Then I had to laugh. It must be the heat, I thought depreca-tingly. Or maybe the gas fumes were making me high. Me, a papa.
<name>Holly</name>	Holly	Alice	‘They better not calf him,’ [MASK] said, brushing her fingers lightly down the back of my neck. ‘Where are we going, darling?’ she asked, standing up. I grinned at her. ‘It’s still a secret.’
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alice	I cut him off with a sudden violent gesture and jumped to my feet. That broke it up. CHAPTER XI When the last of [MASK]’s guests had gone she came upstairs and stood in the doorway looking at me with a wide-eyed condemning stare.
<name>Annabelle</name>	Annabelle	Alice	What I was trying to do now was to keep from thinking about [MASK], just to drift on my thoughts as long as they didn’t touch her. I was scared if I thought about her now I’d begin to wonder, maybe to doubt her.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Bob	‘[MASK], I’ve been trying to get you.’ Her voice sounded as though it was under wraps; it was still low, controlled, but it wasn’t mellow. ‘I stopped and ate on the way home,’ I said.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Blake	Why can’t you be sensible for once—give yourself up and I will bring [MASK] down with me the first thing--’ ‘Will you do it or won’t you?’ I cut in. ‘No, I won’t,’ she said.
<name>Dewey</name>	Dewey	Smitty	If they jumped they could make it; if they didn’t I’d run ’em down. All of ’em jumped. I felt a dead absolute quiet inside; I didn’t give a damn whether they jumped or not. ‘That’s all you niggers think of,’ [MASK] was saying.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Elsie	[MASK] brushed it aside. ‘I always says it ain’t no more’n right. Coloured folks got much right to earn these good wages as white while we fighting this war. It’s partly their country too, I always says.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Leighton	I didn’t want it that way. So I said, ‘I’m sorry, baby, but I took as much of [MASK] as I could. If I’d known you were going to have all the wizards here I’d have stayed away.
<name>it</name>	it	Mac	‘I want some of [MASK] too.’ He was curious to know just what had happened, but he didn’t want to ask right out, so he said, ‘Did you have a fight with her before?’ ‘Hell naw,’ I said.
<name>Jose</name>	Jose	Alice	We were silent for a moment and I looked around at the people in adjoining car's. With the exception of us, they were all white. I noticed several of them glancing furtively at us and I figured they were trying to make out what nationality [MASK] was.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bob	‘I’m in a little trouble and I want to use your phone.’ ‘You don’t sound like [MASK],’ she said sceptically. ‘What’s the matter with your voice?’ ‘I got some teeth knocked out,’ I lisped.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Conway	’d say he was a bad fellow.’ [MASK] got it out in the open. ‘Say, chief, what’s that grey boy doing in yo’ job? He say he taking your place. You ain’t gonna quit us, chief?’
<name>Max</name>	Max	Leighton	He’s fighting on our production front now.’ [MASK] gave me another of his bright friendly smiles. ‘I imagine it’s a very interesting occupation,’ he said. ‘It’s a killer,’ I said. He blinked a little.
<name>he</name>	he	J	But I got a break; he waited on one side of the street until a grey Ford sedan slowed for him at [MASK] climbed in. I sprinted back across the street, got in my car, and dug off just as one of the yard cops was coming
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alice	[MASK] had been watching through the rear-view mirror, and when she saw me coming around the back of the car she turned and smiled. She had on a beige gabardine dress, open at the throat, and tortoiseshell sunglasses; and her hair was loose and windblown, falling all over her shoulders.
<name>Callendar</name>	Callendar	Kelly	But I don’t have anything at all to say about the way I live—nothing. Take my job—I’ve never been anything but a flunkey for [MASK], a go-between for him and the coloured workers.
<name>Truman</name>	Truman	Bob’ll	Argue with him until you’re out of breath and no matter how eloquent your plea or righteous your cause the only way you’ll ever get along with that son of a bitch is to whip his ass—excuse me, ladies.’ He looked around defiantly. ‘[MASK] tell you that’s right.
<name>Strickland</name>	Strickland	Madge	‘So that’s what’s wrong with you.’ She was suddenly indignant. ‘So that’s why you need my help-----’ ‘Hear my story first,’ I said, and told her about my run-in with [MASK] and my getting downgraded.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Bob	This time I got her. ‘It’s [MASK], baby,’ I said, swallowing. ‘Look, if I pick you up in about an hour, can I take you to lunch?’ ‘Where are you now?’ she asked.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alice	I felt crushed inside, as if a car had run over me and left me lying there. I hadn’t wanted her to say it before I’d had a chance to tell her that I didn’t have a choice. CHAPTER XII I went home and went to bed and dreamed [MASK]
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Madge	Fighting with [MASK] until I’d already gotten her down, then jumping up running at the sound of the word ‘rape,’ letting her go untouched. I’d set out to grind her down but in the end I was the one who was defeated.
<name>Teacake</name>	Teacake	George	‘You ast anybody ’bout me. I’ll fight a peck till-’ ‘Aw, man, hush!’ [MASK] cut him off. ‘The worst whipping I ever got come from me thinking I could whip every grey boy I seen.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Baby	‘[MASK],’ I said to her. ‘You sure look good to me.’ She gave me a half-incredulous, half-hopeful look, and her red lips flowered in her dark face. ‘Are you kidding?’
<name>Ann</name>	Ann	Alice	‘Look, [MASK], this is serious,’ I said. ‘This isn’t just talk any more. I don’t expect you to keep our engagement. That’s off, of course. But I need some help. I know what I’m doing.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Bob	Her hands made a fluttery, nervous gesture. ‘Why on earth should you feel you have to get even with them?’ But before I could reply she went on, ‘[MASK], you frighten me. You’ll never make a success with that attitude.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Red	They were both elderly men, small, scrawny, nothing to worry about. I turned and walked away, went down to the head and told [MASK] that I couldn’t find him a tacker, he’d have to take the job over to the sheet-metal shop and get it welded.
<name>Clayton</name>	Clayton	Tebbel	‘Now show us what you got hidden in that other pocket about Negroes,’ he said. [MASK] reddened slightly. ‘You just want to argue,’ he grated. ‘I like coloured people. I was raised with them.’
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Madge	I gave her a sharp look, wondering if she had seen me talking to [MASK]. Then I laughed and leaned over toward her. ‘If you Negro women would give a man a break now and then we wouldn’t have to-----’ But she cut me off.
<name>Algy</name>	Algy	Bob	‘Been forced to. A matter of discipline.’ He paused, waiting for me to say something. There wasn’t anything for me to say. Then he beamed at me. ‘I tell you what I’ll do with you. [MASK].
<name>Velma</name>	Velma	Stella	[MASK] took her cue and dropped it. The box was playing ‘AH For You’ by the King Cole Trio, and I closed my eyes to listen. *. . . life would be a symphony, waiting all for you . . .’
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Madge	I declare, how you eat those dry poke-chop sandwiches is-----’ She was rattling off in a Southern dialect broader than [MASK]’s when suddenly she caught sight of me. She had seen me without seeing me.
<name>Wodehouse</name>	Wodehouse	Robert	‘Oh!’ A pause. Then, ‘Tell him to come right up.’ He turned to me. ‘You can go right up, [MASK].’ ‘Thanks,’ I said. He stopped me to shake hands again.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Hank	[MASK] caught it first; the creases stayed in his face but his smile went. The two women dug it from the change in his expression; neither blushed; they just got that sudden brutal look. ‘You don’t want a tacker, sho ’nuff?’
<name>Yogi</name>	Yogi	Arkansas	and this chump kept gritting his teeth and ducking his head and coming in. Just about time I’d decided to broom, this chump hauled off and hit me a haymaker and killed me a year. I’m telling you, man---’ ‘Thass you,’ [MASK] said.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Polly	Just as soon as some Negro'man starts to getting a little success he runs and marries a white woman. No decent self-respecting Negro man would marry one of those white tramps these Negroes marry.* ‘I wouldn’t say that exactly,’ [MASK] injected.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Bob	‘You don’t think I’m taking you in cold.’ ‘It isn’t that,’ she tried again. ‘It just takes an effort, [MASK], and I wanted to let my hair down and have some fun.’ I was getting sore.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Polly	Aloud I said: ‘Well, now, I think we ought to kill the coloured residents and eat them. In that way we’ll not only solve the race problem but alleviate the meat shortage as well.’ There was a shocked silence for an instant, then [MASK] broke into a raucous laugh.
<name>Smitty</name>	Smitty	Hank	White mechanics could go to him and get any tacker they wanted, but he made the coloured mechanics wait until he could find a coloured tacker that was free. Most of the white tackers didn’t like to work for coloured mechanics, and [MASK] wouldn’t assign them to.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Red	‘Let’s go down and see the man and tell him what’s what.’ ‘Look, fellows, let me handle it,’ I said, but they weren’t listening to me now. They were going to have their say about it so they gathered around [MASK].
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Elsie	[MASK] gave me a sharp quick glance, then looked away. She set her coffee carefully on the ground, then carefully sat herself down. Her actions were slightly dazed, as if she was trying to acquaint a slow mentality to the situation.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Alice	My thoughts were full of [MASK]. I just shook my head. It was one of those miracles. I was a different guy; didn’t think the same; didn’t feel the same. That was what it did for me. Set me up.
<name>John</name>	John	Bob	I tell you, I can’t take much more of it.’ She let go my arms and turned away from me. ‘[MASK], if you continue brooding about white people you are going insane,’ she said. ‘You’re not just saying it.’
<name>Beatty</name>	Beatty	Tebbel	It shocked me to find out he didn’t give a goddamn about the coloured workers, one way or the other. I looked at [MASK] sort of vacantly. He was a thin, undernourished man with a beaked nose, pale blue eyes, and reddish hair.
<name>Mouse</name>	Mouse	Bob	I felt fragile as overheated glass; one rough touch and I’d burst into a thousand pieces. ‘Could happen,’ I said in a thin shallow voice out of the top of my mouth. ‘[MASK]’s got his own troubles, nigger, why don’t you worry ’bout yours?’
<name>Whisky</name>	Whisky	Chaser	‘[MASK]?’ ‘Water,’ I said. He set up the water. ‘We don’t have no more whisky, only once or twice a week,’ he said. ‘I ain’t seen no Scotch since I don’t know when.’
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Bob	‘We done plumb forgot all about [MASK]——’ he began, but I cut him off, ‘No, no, we’re not gonna do that any more. You guys go on and do your work. I’ll take care of everything.’
<name>Leslie</name>	Leslie	Stella	‘You only win,’ I said. After a moment she started to tell me how she came to know [MASK]. I tried to stop her, but she had to tell me, she said, she had to get it out from between us.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Bob	I just dropped by to say hello.’ ‘Oh hush, [MASK], and sit down,’ she said. ‘You know you haven’t got a thing to do.’ I gave her a lidded look. ‘Don’t be too sure,’ I said.
<name>Bigman</name>	Bigman	Hank	‘No, we’s jes waitin’.’ I couldn’t tell whether they were making fun of me or just talked like that. I decided to try again. ‘If [MASK] says it’s all right, can I get one of you then?’
<name>man</name>	man	Joe	That’s all I’d ever wanted—just to be accepted as a man—without ambition, without distinction, either of race, creed, or colour; just a simple [MASK] walking down an American street, going my simple way, without any other identifying characteristics but weight, height, and gender.
<name>Malcolm</name>	Malcolm	Cleo	But this isn’t just a problem of race,’ [MASK] insisted. ‘It’s a ghetto problem involving a class of people with different cultures and traditions at a different level of education.’ ‘Different from what?’ I said.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alice	Then I laughed. ‘Bring us a couple of martinis while I consult my dictionary,' I said to the waiter, and when he left I said to [MASK], ‘I’m going to have some broiled pheasant and champagne
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Alice	The cop grinned evilly. ‘Been to a gin party, eh?’ [MASK] turned a slow red. ‘May I have your names and identification numbers?’ she said. The cop looked at the other cop, then said,‘Okay, fall in behind me.’
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Madge	I was looking for my white boy again. He’d been elected. I was going to walk up and beat out his brains. Then I was going to find [MASK], wherever she was, make my bid and make it stick.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Alice	‘Is [MASK] in?’ I asked before he could get it out. ‘I’ll see,’ he said, getting up. ‘You know, this house is so arranged we can go for days without running into each other.’
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Bob	She answered the phone herself; she had an extension in her room and always answered calls after midnight. ‘It’s [MASK],’ I lisped. ‘I’m--’ She cut me off immediately. ‘If you’re drunk.
<name>Janet</name>	Janet	Bob	But just a few of us have escaped, just a few of us.’ I started to say, ‘Maybe they think the few of you are white,’ but thought better of it. ‘I’m really hurt and worried about you, [MASK],’ she went on incoherently.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Peaches	‘I know,’ he said. ‘I was just trying to stop him from telling that dirty joke to keep from having to knock out his teeth.’ The three girls came in and [MASK] asked, ‘Are you all through telling dirty jokes?’
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Don	But [MASK] did it his way. ‘How’d you make out last night?’ he asked. She had started away, now she wheeled back, but her gaze sought me first, slashed at me, then pinned on him.
<name>where</name>	where	Bob	Her low, well-modulated voice was cajoling. ‘That’s not the mood,’ I said. ‘And anyway, nobody dresses for the Last Word.’ ‘Where, [MASK], the Seven Nymphs?’ That was a Hollywood joint where Negroes went sometimes.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Alice	She began pinning a diaper on the baby. ‘You’re going to mess up yet,’ she said. ‘[MASK] don’t know you like I do.’ I grinned at her. ‘Nobody knows me like you do. You’re my baby.’
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Jones	‘The police are here-----’ Her voice broke off. I heard a scuffle. In the back- ground I could still hear her telling me not to come home, but yelling now. Then a man’s voice said, ‘Listen, [MASK], the best thing you can do------’
<name>Bobo</name>	Bobo	Hank	‘She in [MASK]’s gang, ain’t she?’ I didn’t say anything; I didn’t want to talk about it. ‘She always signifying with you,’ he went on. I didn’t know he had noticed; I wondered who else had noticed.
<name>finally</name>	finally	Anally	He kept clinging to the knob of the door as he started going down, crumbling slowly to the floor as if he was squatting down and it was painful and [MASK] his hand let loose the door-knob and his chest hit his knees and he pitched doubled-up at my feet.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Kelly	I had to decide first whether to tell him to go to hell or not. Finally I said, ‘Fine, [MASK], fine! My coloured gang is coming along fine.’ I started to ask him how were the white gangs coming along, but I caught myself in time.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Johnson	After a moment [MASK] asked dutifully, ‘What they say?’ ‘One to say, “Here he come!” The other to say, “Where he at?” The third to say, “I didn’t seen him!” ’
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Alice	I held my breath all the way down to the tool crib, and when the girl gave me a different number to call I went dead inside. For an instant I started not to call it, then I went ahead on the off-chance. ‘[MASK]?’
<name>Tea Cake</name>	Tea Cake	Ben	You dump like a dumping truck.’ [MASK] saw that she was half-way serious and started teasing her. ‘That’s just what’s wrong with you Negro women—always fighting and fussing. A man takes his life in his hands just to live with you.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Bob	I knew what she meant but I said anyway, ‘What did you ask me to do?’ ‘Let’s don’t play games with each other, [MASK],’ she said. ‘You know what I asked you to do.’
<name>Margo</name>	Margo	Stella	‘Champagne?’ I murmured facetiously. [MASK] rolled me a look, grinned, showing a gaping hole in the middle of her upper teeth. She moved over to the player and said, ‘We were just getting ready to play some jive.’
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Elsie	Then she leaned over me to pick up a-scrap of newspaper and I could see her breasts hanging loose inside her waist. She gave me plenty time to get my gaper’s bit, then fluttered her eyelashes, straightened up, and went off with [MASK], pitching her hips.
<name>Clayton</name>	Clayton	Bob	And if that’s controlling my destiny------’ ‘That isn’t true, [MASK],’ she said patiently. ‘I will admit that we are restricted and controlled in our economic security, that we have to conform to the pattern of segregation in order to achieve any manner of financial success.
<name>Helga</name>	Helga	Bob	[MASK]?’ ‘All I want is to be able-’ I began, but she cut me off. ‘Let me put it another way. Will the fact that you are a Negro deter you from attempting to succeed as white men do?’
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Leighton	For a moment I thought she might send [MASK] on by himself; there was a slight concerned look in her eyes. Then she braced herself and said, ‘Call me tomorrow, darling,’ and walked on toward the coupe.
<name>Galley</name>	Galley	Madge	Then I began remembering the incidents of the day before, the stretch of [MASK]’s big brutal mouth yelling, ‘Rape,’ the hammer floating at my head and not being able to dodge it, coming to on the hospital cot.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Jaxon	Then I thought about a motion picture called A Guy Named Joe\ about that cat making that last bomb run, sinking a Nazi flat-top. Going out in a blaze of glory. See you, gates. See you, [MASK]. See you, stud ...
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Bob	‘Don’t you like to go out with me?’ I asked her suddenly. She stopped talking and gave me a long solemn look. ‘I always like to go out with you, [MASK],’ she said. ‘You make me feel like a woman.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Tom	‘I’m sorry, darling,’ she said, giving me her social worker’s smile. ‘We’re going to the lecture and we’re late now. [MASK] gave me a ring after you said you couldn’t go.’ ‘ Well . . .’
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Don	It wasn’t tense, but it was itchy. I pulled the edges of my mouth down, dropped a flat-eyed evil glance on her hooded head, then looked at [MASK]. ‘A rugged playmate,’ I said. ‘Must have snake in her.
<name>Pease</name>	Pease	Mac	I’d known [MASK] was going to give me hell; but I didn’t think he’d downgrade me and put a white boy in my place. I thought he’d be afraid of the coloured workers making trouble.
<name>Sarah</name>	Sarah	Alice	and I know the white folks are going to say, “That’s the nearest that nigger can find to chicken and gin,” but I don’t even give a damn.’ [MASK]’s eyes frightened me; I thought for a moment that I’d lost her.
<name>Blue</name>	Blue	Madge	Maybe it was easy to some folks, I thought. But not to me. I’d already read and I was running. Read and run, nigger. . . . But when I started moving again I knew I was looking for [MASK].
<name>Artie</name>	Artie	Bob	I didn’t say anything at all. Finally she asked, ‘Is this goodbye, [MASK]?’ ‘Look baby,’ I said. ‘I’m not in the mood to listen to your all this and heaven too.’ She hung up.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Rufus	I got out and walked around the car. He blocked my path. The other cop closed in beside me. I took a breath, let it out, said: ‘[MASK] isn’t the name on it.’
<name>Garvey</name>	Garvey	Ben	And if they put me in the Jim Crow Army I was going to take that too. [MASK] could talk all he wanted to. He was right. I knew he was right. But I was going to take it if they put it on me.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Alice	I knew what was going on and I wasn’t having any of it. I felt shocked, sickened. I went back into the room and said to [MASK], ‘You can’t do this to me.’ She gave me a look of raw hatred.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Alice	I frowned, turning my head carefully to look into the mirror. Then I remembered. I tried to stop it about [MASK] but it came back anyway. I felt an odd sort of embarrassment for her; a sort of mixture of shame and betrayal and repulsion.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	George	‘You was so black you was four days old before anybody knew you was here.’ ‘Gentlemen! Gentlemen!’ [MASK] said. ‘I beg you desist.’ The three girls started out. It was getting too rough for them.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Darling	When I heard her voice, light and gay, ‘[MASK], I’ve changed my mind again. Isn’t that just like a woman?’ I let my breath out in a long soft sigh and felt the life come back into me.
<name>Bigger</name>	Bigger	John	That was when I knew it, when I lost all doubt. I could take anything the white folks wanted to put on me, as long as I had this. Because this was it; I knew this was it; this was the number that [MASK] saw.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Alice	‘Oh, [MASK] is fine,’ she said. ‘Rich and light and almost white. You better hang on to her.’ ‘Okay, baby, I quit,’ I said. I wondered what was eating her.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Tebbel	[MASK] said the Jews controlled all the money in the world; that the Jews had started the war to make money; and that all Jews were Communists. ‘That I gotta see,’ I said. But no one paid any attention to me.
<name>He</name>	He	Madge	[MASK] came into me from the angle, caught me off guard, flung me toward the bunk. The side of my right leg, just below the knee, clipped against the side of the bunk, broke me into a spinning fall.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Madge	I’d gotten [MASK] completely out of my thoughts and running into her like that startled me. I stood for a moment, looking at her stupidly as if she was some strange sight. Then I caught myself and said, ‘Oh, I didn’t know you were here.’
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Bob	‘No,’ I said. There was another blank and when her voice came now it was a little desperate. ‘Do you love me, [MASK]?’ ‘Yes,’ I said. I was fighting against her, trying to keep her from touching me.
