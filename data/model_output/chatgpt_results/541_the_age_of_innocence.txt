<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	May	She pinched [MASK]'s white arm and watched the colour flood her face. "Well, well, what have I said to make you shake out the red flag? Ain't there going to be any daughters--only boys, eh?
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Archer	It has made up to her for so many things!" [MASK] hesitated again, and again took his risk. "Is your aunt's romanticism always consistent with accuracy?" "You mean: does she speak the truth?" Her niece considered. "
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Archer	But [MASK] was on edge, and took her up. "Common--common WHERE?" he queried; and she returned with unusual readiness: "Why, I should say anywhere but in his school-room. Those people are always awkward in society.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	May	He knew the drawing-room above had a bay window, but he could not fancy how [MASK] would deal with it. She submitted cheerfully to the purple satin and yellow tuftings of the Welland drawing-room, to its sham Buhl tables and gilt vitrines full of modern Saxe.
<name>Cousin</name>	Cousin	Archer	For a couple of hours [MASK] had examined the terms of the deed with his senior, all the while obscurely feeling that if he had been consulted it was for some reason other than the obvious one of his cousinship; and that the close of the conference would reveal it.
<name>Scudder</name>	Scudder	Archer	"I have come, not to look for employment, as I spoke of doing when we last met, but on a special mission--" "Ah--!" [MASK] exclaimed. In a flash the two meetings had connected themselves in his mind.
<name>Renfield</name>	Renfield	Monsieur	"[MASK], I discharged my mission faithfully: I put the Count's arguments, I stated his offers, without adding any comment of my own. The Countess was good enough to listen patiently; she carried her goodness so far as to see me twice; she considered impartially all I had come to say.
<name>the answer</name>	the answer	Archer	You've seen that she's just an old bogey like all the others." "She doesn't blind one; but she dries up one's tears." The answer checked the pleading on [MASK]'s lips: it seemed to come from depths of experience beyond his reach.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Archer	"What's the use of making mysteries? It only makes people want to nose 'em out," he always objected when enjoined to discretion. But [MASK], meeting his eyes, saw the filial light under their banter. "
<name>her sister</name>	her sister	Augusta	She gave so many reasons that I've forgotten them all. My private belief is that she couldn't face the boredom. At any rate that's what [MASK] and my daughters-in-law think. And I don't know that I altogether blame her.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	May	The door opened and [MASK] came in. "I'm dreadfully late--you weren't worried, were you?" she asked, laying her hand on his shoulder with one of her rare caresses. He looked up astonished. "Is it late?"
<name>He</name>	He	Archer	There was no mistaking the sincerity of his distress or the strength of his determination: he had evidently resolved to let everything go by the board but the supreme need of thus putting himself on record. [MASK] considered. "
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Granny	I'd seen her at [MASK]'s." "It wasn't then that she told you?" "No; I had a note from her this afternoon.--Do you want to see it?" He could not find his voice, and she went out of the room, and came back almost immediately.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Archer	[MASK], who had not seen him for two or three months, was struck by the change in his appearance. In the hot summer light his floridness seemed heavy and bloated, and but for his erect square-shouldered walk he would have looked like an over-fed and over-dressed old man.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Archer	[MASK] sprang up and moved a step or two away. She had furled her parasol and sat absently drawing patterns on the gravel. Presently he came back and stood before her. "Some one--has come here to meet you?" "Yes."
<name>Angel</name>	Angel	Archer	But in [MASK]'s little world no one laughed at a wife deceived, and a certain measure of contempt was attached to men who continued their philandering after marriage. In the rotation of crops there was a recognised season for wild oats; but they were not to be sown more than once.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Archer	[MASK] looked at him with increasing astonishment. There was no mistaking the sincerity of his distress or the strength of his determination: he had evidently resolved to let everything go by the board but the supreme need of thus putting himself on record.
<name>John</name>	John	May	Something drummed and clanged furiously in his ears; he could not tell if it were the blood in his veins, or the tick of the clock on the mantel. [MASK] sat without moving or speaking while the clock slowly measured out five minutes.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Archer	"I'm here on business--just got here," [MASK] explained; and, without knowing why, he suddenly began to feign astonishment at seeing her. "But what on earth are you doing in this wilderness?"
<name>Archer</name>	Archer	Dallas	"I wonder which floor--?" [MASK] conjectured; and moving toward the porte-cochere he put his head into the porter's lodge, and came back to say: "The fifth. It must be the one with the awnings."
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Archer	[MASK] bent down and pressed his lips on the little hand that still lay on his. "Eh--eh--eh! Whose hand did you think you were kissing, young man--your wife's, I hope?"
<name>her</name>	her	May	What if "niceness" carried to that supreme degree were only a negation, the curtain dropped before an emptiness? As he looked at [MASK], returning flushed and calm from her final bull's-eye, he had the feeling that he had never yet lifted that curtain.
<name>Louise</name>	Louise	Archer	"Oh, I'm not going," [MASK] answered. "Not going? Why, what's happened?" Her voice was as clear as a bell, and full of wifely solicitude. "The case is off--postponed." "Postponed? How odd!
<name>Lady Chatterley</name>	Lady Chatterley	Ellen	"Why shouldn't she be conspicuous if she chooses? Why should she slink about as if it were she who had disgraced herself? She's 'poor [MASK]' certainly, because she had the bad luck to make a wretched marriage;
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Archer	To [MASK]'s strained nerves the vision was as soothing as the sight of the blue sky and the lazy river. They sat down on a bench under the orange-trees and he put his arm about her and kissed her.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Ellen	Ah--you didn't know [MASK] had come to spend the day with me? Such fol-de-rol, her not coming for the summer; but I gave up arguing with young people about fifty years ago.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Archer	"You can help, Monsieur, I am convinced, to make it equally a failure with her family." [MASK] pushed back his chair and stood up. "Well--and by God I will!" he exclaimed.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Archer	"Because she doesn't care a hang about where she lives--or about any of our little social sign-posts," said [MASK], with a secret pride in his own picture of her. "H'm--been in bigger places, I suppose," the other commented.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Oh"--she	"[MASK] murmured again. She stood up and reopened her sunshade, glancing about her as if to take counsel of the scene, and assure herself of the impossibility of remaining in it. Then her eyes returned to his face.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Ellen	"Ah, but not as handsome as [MASK]!" she jerked out, twinkling at him maliciously; and before he could answer she added: "Was she so awfully handsome the day you drove her up from the ferry?"
<name>horses</name>	horses	Regina	He hasn't spent all his money on [MASK]." "Oh, well--that's discounted, isn't it? My belief is he'll pull out yet," said the young man, wanting to change the subject. "Perhaps--perhaps.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Archer	The only thing to do was to persuade him, as early as possible, to marry a nice girl, and then trust to her to look after him. In the complicated old European communities, [MASK] began to guess, love-problems might be less simple and less easily classified.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Archer	[MASK] waited till a wide space of water sparkled between the last reef of the island and the stern of the boat; but still the figure in the summer-house did not move. He turned and walked up the hill.
<name>France</name>	France	Lefferts	"If she goes NOW, and if he fails, it will only confirm the general impression: which isn't by any means peculiar to [MASK], by the way." "Oh, she won't go back now: less than ever!"
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Granny	" the old lady snapped out with her mocking cackle; and as he rose to go she called out after him: "Give her her [MASK]'s love; but you'd better not say anything about our talk." XXXI.
<name>James</name>	James	Archer	The next morning [MASK] scoured the town in vain for more yellow roses. In consequence of this search he arrived late at the office, perceived that his doing so made no difference whatever to any one, and was filled with sudden exasperation at the elaborate futility of his life.
<name>Blackie</name>	Blackie	Archer	If the stable's ever to be cleaned out, men like you have got to lend a hand in the cleaning." "Men like you--" how [MASK] had glowed at the phrase! How eagerly he had risen up at the call!
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Archer	"You'd better take all your furs, and a hot-water-bottle." "Why? Is the house so cold?" she asked, holding out her left hand to [MASK] in a way mysteriously suggesting that she expected him to kiss it.
<name>Levin</name>	Levin	Archer	The round-bosomed maid came in, drew the curtains, pushed back a log, and said consolingly: "Verra--verra." When she had gone [MASK] stood up and began to wander about. Should he wait any longer? His position was becoming rather foolish.
<name>Something</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Something (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Beaufort	"This is the hour I like best--don't you?" A proper sense of his dignity caused him to answer: "I was afraid you'd forgotten the hour. [MASK] must have been very engrossing." She looked amused. "Why--have you waited long?
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Louisa	"[MASK] is fond of you; and of course it's on account of dear May that I'm taking this step--and also because, if we don't all stand together, there'll be no such thing as Society left." VII.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Beaufort	" She appeared to dismiss both [MASK] and himself from her mind, and went on: "I've never been in a city where there seems to be such a feeling against living in des quartiers excentriques. What does it matter where one lives?
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Archer	Her hand fluttered from its chair-arm and lit on his with a clutch of little pale nails like bird-claws. "Why not?" she searchingly repeated. [MASK], under the exposure of her gaze, had recovered his self-possession.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	May	They went upstairs, and he turned into the library. She usually followed him; but he heard her passing down the passage to her bedroom. "[MASK]!" he called out impatiently; and she came back, with a slight glance of surprise at his tone.
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Granny	Shall we get out and walk, then? I don't suppose you mind a little snow?" She laughed again, more gently. "No; I shan't get out and walk, because my business is to get to [MASK]'s as quickly as I can.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	May	His host's contemptuous tribute to [MASK]'s "niceness" was just what a husband should have wished to hear said of his wife. The fact that a coarseminded man found her lacking in attraction was simply another proof of her quality; yet the words sent a faint shiver through his heart.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Archer	After the door had closed again [MASK] continued to look at her with bitter eyes. "Why this sacrifice? Since you tell me that you're lonely I've no right to keep you from your friends." She smiled a little under her wet lashes.
<name>Lily</name>	Lily	Nastasia	The answer puzzled him. "Why--do you mean that you've been overtaken?" She shrugged her shoulders, with a little movement like [MASK]'s, and rejoined in a lighter tone: "Shall we walk on? I'm so cold after the sermon.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Ellen	"She hates [MASK]," he thought, "and she's trying to overcome the feeling, and to get me to help her to overcome it." The thought moved him, and for a moment he was on the point of breaking
<name>he</name>	he	Archer	She's staying at the Parker House; it must be horrible there in this weather." After that [MASK] was but intermittently aware of the remarks they exchanged. He could only remember stoutly resisting her entreaty that he should await the returning family and have high tea with them before he drove home.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	May	He had taken to history in the evenings since [MASK] had shown a tendency to ask him to read aloud whenever she saw him with a volume of poetry: not that he disliked the sound of his own voice, but because he could always foresee her comments on what he read.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Nastasia	At a stroke she had pricked the van der Luydens and they collapsed. He laughed, and sacrificed them. [MASK] brought the tea, with handleless Japanese cups and little covered dishes, placing the tray on a low table. "
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	May	It did not hurt him half as much to tell [MASK] an untruth as to see her trying to pretend that she had not detected him. "I'm not going till later on: luckily for the convenience of your family," he continued, taking base refuge in sarcasm.
<name>Monte Cristo</name>	Monte Cristo	Archer	"Monsieur--will you tell me one thing? Is it my right to be here that you question? Or do you perhaps believe the whole matter to be already closed?" His quiet insistence made [MASK] feel the clumsiness of his own bluster.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Monsieur	But from the moment that I have taken the step of coming here to say these things to you I consider myself discharged, and I shall tell him so on my return, and give him the reasons. That's all, [MASK]."
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	May	"Oh, all right," he said, staring with unseeing eyes at the list of guests that she had put in his hand. When he entered the drawing-room before dinner [MASK] was stooping over the fire and trying to coax the logs to burn in their unaccustomed setting of immaculate tiles.
<name>Bessie</name>	Bessie	May	You should have [MASK]'s done: no doubt he'll have it done, my child. Her hand is large--it's these modern sports that spread the joints--but the skin is white.--And when's the wedding to be?
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Ellen	"What did I come for, if I don't speak yours?" "Oh, my friend--!" She laid her hand lightly on his arm, and he pleaded earnestly: "[MASK]--why won't you tell me what's happened?"
<name>someone</name>	someone	Archer	Did you ever know anything so disappointing? Of course," she added gaily, "I shouldn't have minded half as much if I'd known you were coming." Symptoms of a lumbering coquetry became visible in her, and [MASK] found the strength to break in: "
<name>Mr. Jaggers</name>	Mr. Jaggers	Archer	"My dear sir, the law's the law; and your wife's cousin was married under the French law. It's to be presumed she knew what that meant." "Even if she did, what happened subsequently--." But [MASK] paused.
<name>impressions</name>	impressions	Archer	He had given [MASK] to understand that his wife was an invalid; which might be true of the poor lady, or might merely mean that she was lacking in social gifts or in evening clothes, or in both.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Archer	The air of ideas is the only air worth breathing. And so I have never regretted giving up either diplomacy or journalism--two different forms of the same self-abdication." He fixed his vivid eyes on [MASK] as he lit another cigarette.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Archer	She sat silent, without a movement or a tremor of her lashes. She was still extremely pale, but her face had a curious tranquillity of expression that seemed drawn from some secret inner source. [MASK] checked the conventional phrases of self-accusal that were crowding to his lips.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Dallas	I say, Dad, I want your help: do come." [MASK] seemed to be speaking in the room: the voice was as near by and natural as if he had been lounging in his favourite arm-chair by the fire.
<name>Faust</name>	Faust	Martha	"After all," he heard one of the younger men begin behind him (everybody talked through the Mephistopheles-and-[MASK] scenes), "after all, just WHAT happened?" "Well--she left him; nobody attempts to deny that."
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	XIII	She drew them away, and he turned to the door, found his coat and hat under the faint gas-light of the hall, and plunged out into the winter night bursting with the belated eloquence of the inarticulate. [MASK].
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Archer	At first [MASK] had fancied that this detachment was the disguise of an inward tremor; but her clear eyes revealed only the most tranquil unawareness. She was alone for the first time with her husband; but her husband was only the charming comrade of yesterday.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Dallas	"Go, my boy; perhaps I shall follow you." [MASK] gave him a long look through the twilight. "But what on earth shall I say?" "My dear fellow, don't you always know what to say?"
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Janey	To smother it he laughed. "Well, what of it? I knew she meant to." [MASK] paled and her eyes began to project. "You knew she meant to--and you didn't try to stop her? To warn her?"
<name>Mrs. Ramsay</name>	Mrs. Ramsay	Archer	Her incapacity to recognise change made her children conceal their views from her as [MASK] concealed his; there had been, from the first, a joint pretence of sameness, a kind of innocent family hypocrisy, in which father and children had unconsciously collaborated.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Archer	[MASK] made no answer, and she continued, with a tinge of hardness that he had never before noticed in her frank fresh voice: "After all, I wonder if she wouldn't be happier with her husband." He burst into a laugh.
<name>Raj</name>	Raj	Archer	[MASK] looked at her incredulously. "Have you forgotten," he asked with a smile, "that in our country we don't allow our marriages to be arranged for us?" A dusky blush rose to her cheek, and he instantly regretted his words.
<name>Mr. Faraday</name>	Mr. Faraday	May	As his glance travelled from one placid well-fed face to another he saw all the harmless-looking people engaged upon [MASK]'s canvas-backs as a band of dumb conspirators, and himself and the pale woman on his right as the centre of their conspiracy.
<name>Newland</name>	Newland	Archer	[MASK] turned toward the door, and his mother-in-law called to him: "Do go in and have a peep at the table. And don't let May tire herself too much." But he affected not to hear, and sprang up the stairs to his library.
<name>Cynthia</name>	Cynthia	Archer	In her dress of white and silver, with a wreath of silver blossoms in her hair, the tall girl looked like a Diana just alight from the chase. "Oh," said [MASK], "I have so many rivals; you see she's already surrounded.
<name>Archer</name>	Archer	Beaufort	"Ha! [MASK], this is a rare favour!" (She had an odd foreign way of addressing men by their surnames.) "Thanks. I wish it might happen oftener," said the visitor in his easy arrogant way.
<name>Lucie</name>	Lucie	Granny	"What do you think better?" Instead of answering she murmured: "I promised [MASK] to stay with her because it seemed to me that here I should be safer." "From me?" She bent her head slightly, without looking at him.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	May	Ah, here's [MASK] arriving, and you will want to hurry away to her," she added, but without moving; and her eyes turned back from the door to rest on the young man's face.
<name>Liza</name>	Liza	Newland	He tried to enter into her perplexity. "But don't Englishwomen dress just like everybody else in the evening?" "[MASK]! How can you ask such funny questions? When they go to the theatre in old ball-dresses and bare heads." "
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	May	There was no use in trying to emancipate a wife who had not the dimmest notion that she was not free; and he had long since discovered that [MASK]'s only use of the liberty she supposed herself to possess would be to lay it on the altar of her wifely adoration.
<name>her</name>	her	Letterblair	It's not a gay prospect, but she doesn't mind; and of course I've told [MASK] that she's to be given her proper allowance." The young man heard her with veins aglow; but in his confusion of mind he hardly knew whether her news brought joy or pain.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Pocahontas	"I don't want them to think that we dress like savages," she replied, with a scorn that [MASK] might have resented; and he was struck again by the religious reverence of even the most unworldly American women for the social advantages of dress.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Archer	Did you never hear her?" [MASK] was dealing hurriedly with crowding thoughts. His whole future seemed suddenly to be unrolled before him; and passing down its endless emptiness he saw the dwindling figure of a man to whom nothing was ever to happen.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Archer	[MASK] walked away a few steps, staring with radiant unseeing eyes at the passersby, who, in their turn, paused to stare at the unwonted sight of a fashionably-dressed lady writing a note on her knee on a bench in the Common.
<name>John</name>	John	Archer	A big bed of embers still gleamed in the kitchen chimney, under an iron pot hung from an ancient crane. Rush-bottomed arm-chairs faced each other across the tiled hearth, and rows of Delft plates stood on shelves against the walls. [MASK] stooped over and threw a log upon the embers.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Ellen	She blushed seldom and painfully, as if it hurt her like a burn. "Many cruel things have been believed of me," she said. "Oh, [MASK]--forgive me; I'm a fool and a brute!" She smiled a little.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Augusta	"If only I could keep it from your father-in-law: he always says: '[MASK], for pity's sake, don't destroy my last illusions'--and how am I to prevent his knowing these horrors?" the poor lady wailed.
<name>Meg</name>	Meg	Mamma	I'm so glad! But, dearest, why do you keep on laughing? Do hush, or you'll wake [MASK]." Book II XIX. The day was fresh, with a lively spring wind full of dust.
<name>Dorcas</name>	Dorcas	Ellen	If it goes at once [MASK] can probably catch tomorrow morning's train." She pronounced the syllables of the name with a peculiar clearness, as if she had tapped on two silver bells. "Well, it can't go at once.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Granny	Recognising his wife's hand, the young man opened the envelope and read: "Won't you please come up town as early as you can? [MASK] had a slight stroke last night. In some mysterious way she found out before any one else this awful news about the bank.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Archer	As [MASK] listened, his sense of inadequacy and inexpressiveness increased. The boy was not insensitive, he knew; but he had the facility and self-confidence that came of looking at fate not as a master but as an equal.
<name>Wilkins</name>	Wilkins	Dallas	"I believe I'll sit there a moment," he said. "Why--aren't you well?" his son exclaimed. "Oh, perfectly. But I should like you, please, to go up without me." [MASK] paused before him, visibly bewildered.
<name>May</name>	May	May	Little arduous as his professional duties were, he would have been convicted of frivolity by the whole Mingott clan if he had suggested asking for a holiday in mid-winter; and he accepted [MASK]'s departure with the resignation which he perceived would have to be one of the principal constituents of married life.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Archer	The face exposed her as much as if it had been her whole person, with the soul behind it: [MASK] stood dumb, overwhelmed by what it suddenly told him. "You too--oh, all this time, you too?"
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Janey	"Nonsense, mother; [MASK]'s grown-up. They say, don't they," he went on, "that the secretary helped her to get away from her brute of a husband, who kept her practically a prisoner? Well, what if he did?
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Granny	The letter contained only a few lines. "May dear, I have at last made [MASK] understand that my visit to her could be no more than a visit; and she has been as kind and generous as ever.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Archer	"What they must have cost at this season--though of course it's the sentiment one cares about!" the lady was saying in a sighing staccato as [MASK] came in. The three turned with surprise at his appearance, and the lady, advancing, held out her hand.
<name>Lady Narborough</name>	Lady Narborough	Archer	"My daughters tell me it doesn't matter at my age--as if hideousness didn't matter all the more the harder it gets to conceal!" "My dear, you're handsomer than ever!" [MASK] rejoined in the same tone; and she threw back her head and laughed.
<name>Louisa</name>	Louisa	Ellen	I don't know any of the details; I only ask not to, as I told poor [MASK] when she tried to talk to me about it. Having an invalid to care for, I have to keep my mind bright and happy.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Archer	"But that's the very reason why I ask you to come away!" "And destroy their lives, when they've helped me to remake mine?" [MASK] sprang to his feet and stood looking down on her in inarticulate despair.
