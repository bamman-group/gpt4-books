<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Winterbourne	Her conversation was chiefly of what metaphysicians term the objective cast, but every now and then it took a subjective turn. “What on EARTH are you so grave about?” she suddenly demanded, fixing her agreeable eyes upon [MASK]’s. “Am I grave?”
<name>Lord Henry</name>	Lord Henry	Winterbourne	“She is completely uncultivated,” [MASK] went on. “But she is wonderfully pretty, and, in short, she is very nice. To prove that I believe it, I am going to take her to the Chateau de Chillon.”
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Winterbourne--“just	“Oh, don’t say such dreadful things!” said [MASK] at the last!” “The last!” cried the young girl; “I call it the first. I have half a mind to leave you here and go straight back to the hotel alone.”
<name>Mr. George</name>	Mr. George	Daisy	“Will you get in and let me put it over you?” “Oh, no, thank you,” said [MASK]. “I shall admire it much more as I see you driving round with it.” “Do get in and drive with me!”
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Winterbourne	“I have noticed you. But I noticed you were as stiff as an umbrella the first time I saw you.” “You will find I am not so stiff as several others,” said [MASK], smiling. “How shall I find it?”
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Winterbourne	People continued to look at her a great deal, and [MASK] took much satisfaction in his pretty companion’s distinguished air. He had been a little afraid that she would talk loud, laugh overmuch, and even, perhaps, desire to move about the boat a good deal.
<name>Archer</name>	Archer	Winterbourne	Do wait over till Friday, and I will go down to the landing to see her arrive!” [MASK] began to think he had been wrong to feel disappointed in the temper in which the young lady had embarked. If he had missed the personal accent, the personal accent was now making its appearance.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Daisy	“He isn’t preaching, at any rate,” said [MASK] with vivacity. “And if you want very much to know, we are neither of us flirting; we are too good friends for that: we are very intimate friends.”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Daisy	“I am much obliged to you,” laughed the young man. “You might have come to see me!” said [MASK]. “I arrived only yesterday.” “I don’t believe that!” the young girl declared.
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Winterbourne	In front of [MASK] he paused, looking at him with a pair of bright, penetrating little eyes. “Will you give me a lump of sugar?” he asked in a sharp, hard little voice--a voice immature and yet, somehow, not young.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Winterbourne	How long had you known her, may I ask, when this interesting project was formed? You haven’t been twenty-four hours in the house.” “I have known her half an hour!” said [MASK], smiling. “Dear me!”
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Winterbourne	“She’s an American girl.” [MASK] looked along the path and saw a beautiful young lady advancing. “American girls are the best girls,” he said cheerfully to his young companion. “My sister ain’t the best!” the child declared.
<name>Lady Bracknell</name>	Lady Bracknell	Daisy	“Just hear him say that!” said [MASK] to her hostess, giving a twist to a bow on this lady’s dress. “Did you ever hear anything so quaint?” “So quaint, my dear?”
<name>Mr. Knightley</name>	Mr. Knightley	Winterbourne	The young ladies of this country have a dreadfully poky time of it, so far as I can learn; I don’t see why I should change my habits for THEM.” “I am afraid your habits are those of a flirt,” said [MASK] gravely.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Winterbourne	“I haven’t had any for ever so long--for a hundred weeks!” cried the boy, still jumping about. The young lady inspected her flounces and smoothed her ribbons again; and [MASK] presently risked an observation upon the beauty of the view.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Daisy	Then at other moments he believed that she carried about in her elegant and irresponsible little organism a defiant, passionate, perfectly observant consciousness of the impression she produced. He asked himself whether [MASK]’s defiance came from the consciousness of innocence, or from her being, essentially, a young person of the reckless class.
<name>time</name>	time	Randolph	I guess she hasn’t got [MASK] to go to bed.” The figure of a lady appeared at a distance, very indistinct in the darkness, and advancing with a slow and wavering movement. Suddenly it seemed to pause. “Are you sure it is your mother?
<name>view</name>	view	Winterbourne	She came a little nearer, and he held the parasol over her; then, still holding it, he let it rest upon her shoulder, so that both of their heads were hidden from [MASK]. This young man lingered a moment, then he began to walk.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Winterbourne	“I don’t care to go now.” “I myself shall make a fuss if you don’t go,” said [MASK]. “That’s all I want--a little fuss!” And the young girl began to laugh again.
<name>her father</name>	her father	Randolph	she and her mother and [MASK]. She asked him if he was a “real American”; she shouldn’t have taken him for one; he seemed more like a German--this was said after a little hesitation--especially when he spoke.
<name>Phileas Fogg</name>	Phileas Fogg	Daisy	asked [MASK]. “You can’t get out of that.” “I have had the honor of telling you that I have only just stepped out of the train.” “You must have stayed in the train a good while after it stopped!”
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Winterbourne	“If she is so perfectly determined to compromise herself, the sooner one knows it the better; one can act accordingly.” “I suspect she meant no harm,” [MASK] rejoined. “So I thought a month ago. But she has been going too far.”
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Winterbourne	The young girl looked at him through the dusk. “But I suppose she doesn’t have a headache every day,” she said sympathetically. [MASK] was silent a moment. “She tells me she does,” he answered at last, not knowing what to say.
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Winterbourne	If I didn’t introduce my gentlemen friends to Mother,” the young girl added in her little soft, flat monotone, “I shouldn’t think I was natural.” “To introduce me,” said [MASK], “you must know my name.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Daisy	But if you won’t flirt with me, do cease, at least, to flirt with your friend at the piano; they don’t understand that sort of thing here.” “I thought they understood nothing else!” exclaimed [MASK].
<name>He</name>	He	Winterbourne	[MASK], who denied the existence of such a person, was quite unable to discover, and he was divided between amazement at the rapidity of her induction and amusement at the frankness of her persiflage. She seemed to him, in all this, an extraordinary mixture of innocence and crudity.
<name>John</name>	John	Winterbourne	* * * [MASK] looked at her; he had stopped laughing. “You don’t believe!” she added. He was silent a moment; and then, “Yes, I believe it,” he said. “Oh, no, you don’t!”
<name>Countess</name>	Countess	Winterbourne	It seemed too pitiful, not even to attempt to save her. I ordered the carriage and put on my bonnet, and came here as quickly as possible. Thank Heaven I have found you!” “What do you propose to do with us?” asked [MASK], smiling.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Daisy	“I don’t care,” said [MASK] in a little strange tone, “whether I have Roman fever or not!” Upon this the cab driver cracked his whip, and they rolled away over the desultory patches of the antique pavement.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Winterbourne	At last he said, “She was the most beautiful young lady I ever saw, and the most amiable;” and then he added in a moment, “and she was the most innocent.” [MASK] looked at him and presently repeated his words, “And the most innocent?”
<name>him</name>	him	Randolph	“She doesn’t sleep--not three hours. She says she doesn’t know how she lives. She’s dreadfully nervous. I guess she sleeps more than she thinks. She’s gone somewhere after [MASK]; she wants to try to get him to go to bed.
<name>Lady Bracknell</name>	Lady Bracknell	Winterbourne	“I have never been to that castle.” “It is a pity you shouldn’t go,” said [MASK], beginning to feel reassured as to her opposition. And yet he was quite prepared to find that, as a matter of course, she meant to accompany her daughter.
<name>person</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	person (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	Daisy	Of all this [MASK] delivered herself with the sweetest, brightest audibleness, looking now at her hostess and now round the room, while she gave a series of little pats, round her shoulders, to the edges of her dress. “Is there anyone I know?”
<name>her</name>	her	Daisy	A lady told me that he was afraid I was angry with him for taking [MASK] round at night. Well, so I am, but I suppose he knows I’m a lady. I would scorn to scold him. Anyway, she says she’s not engaged.
<name>Monte Cristo</name>	Monte Cristo	Winterbourne	When, on his return from the villa (it was eleven o’clock), [MASK] approached the dusky circle of the Colosseum, it recurred to him, as a lover of the picturesque, that the interior, in the pale moonshine, would be well worth a glance.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Winterbourne	She paused again for an instant; she was looking at [MASK] with all her prettiness in her lively eyes and in her light, slightly monotonous smile. “I have always had,” she said, “a great deal of gentlemen’s society.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Winterbourne	“Should you like me to dance a hornpipe on the deck?” “Pray do, and I’ll carry round your hat. It will pay the expenses of our journey.” “I never was better pleased in my life,” murmured [MASK].
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Winterbourne	She would never have married me, I am sure.” “She would never have married you?” “For a moment I hoped so. But no. I am sure.” [MASK] listened to him: he stood staring at the raw protuberance among the April daisies.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Winterbourne	“She don’t like to ride round in the afternoon. But did you really mean what you said just now--that you would like to go up there?” “Most earnestly,” [MASK] declared. “Then we may arrange it.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Winterbourne	And then, on [MASK]’s affirmative reply--“American men are the best,” he declared. His companion thanked him for the compliment, and the child, who had now got astride of his alpenstock, stood looking about him, while he attacked a second lump of sugar.
<name>Lady Windermere</name>	Lady Windermere	Winterbourne	When she comes to a party she brings with her a gentleman with a good deal of manner and a wonderful mustache.” “And where is the mother?” “I haven’t the least idea. They are very dreadful people.” [MASK] meditated a moment.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Winterbourne	He had a handsome face, an artfully poised hat, a glass in one eye, and a nosegay in his buttonhole. [MASK] looked at him a moment and then said, “Do you mean to speak to that man?” “Do I mean to speak to him?
<name>Mr. Collins</name>	Mr. Collins	Winterbourne	[MASK] declared. And he desired more and more to make it a certainty that he was to have the privilege of a tete-a-tete with the young lady, who was still strolling along in front of them, softly vocalizing.
<name>Phileas Fogg</name>	Phileas Fogg	Winterbourne	He’s staring at the women in the carriages: did you ever see anything so cool?” [MASK] perceived at some distance a little man standing with folded arms nursing his cane. He had a handsome face, an artfully poised hat, a glass in one eye, and a nosegay in his buttonhole.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Daisy	[MASK] gave a delighted laugh. “If I could have the sweet hope of making you angry, I should say it again.” “Don’t do that; when I am angry I’m stiffer than ever.
<name>Henrietta</name>	Henrietta	Daisy	That she should seem to wish to get rid of him would help him to think more lightly of her, and to be able to think more lightly of her would make her much less perplexing. But [MASK], on this occasion, continued to present herself as an inscrutable combination of audacity and innocence.
<name>Bobby</name>	Bobby	Randolph	“Can you get candy there?” [MASK] loudly inquired. “I hope not,” said his sister. “I guess you have had enough candy, and mother thinks so too.” “I haven’t had any for ever so long--for a hundred weeks!”
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Winterbourne	“And if you want very much to know, we are neither of us flirting; we are too good friends for that: we are very intimate friends.” “Ah!” rejoined [MASK], “if you are in love with each other, it is another affair.”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Daisy	The slow-moving, idly gazing Roman crowd bestowed much attention upon the extremely pretty young foreign lady who was passing through it upon his arm; and he wondered what on earth had been in [MASK]’s mind when she proposed to expose herself, unattended, to its appreciation.
<name>he</name>	he	Winterbourne	It was true that, if he was an imitation, the imitation was brilliant. “Nevertheless,” [MASK] said to himself, “a nice girl ought to know!” And then he came back to the question whether this was, in fact, a nice girl.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Daisy	“I should think you would say something.” “I do say something;” and he paused a moment. “I say that your mother tells me that she believes you are engaged.” “Well, she does,” said [MASK] very simply.
<name>He</name>	He	Winterbourne	She must not walk here with you two men. Fifty people have noticed her.” [MASK] raised his eyebrows. “I think it’s a pity to make too much fuss about it.” “It’s a pity to let the girl ruin herself!”
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Winterbourne	“Very good, I should think,” said [MASK]. “Or else she’s going to find some school. He ought to learn some more. He’s only nine. He’s going to college.”
<name>the girl</name>	the girl	Daisy	“Yes, it would be lovely!” said [MASK]. But she made no movement to accompany him; she only stood there laughing. “I should think you had better find out what time it is,” interposed her mother.
<name>him</name>	him	Winterbourne	She turned to [MASK], blushing a little--a very little. “You won’t back out?” she said. “I shall not be happy till we go!” he protested. “And you are staying in this hotel?” she went on.
<name>Lady Bracknell</name>	Lady Bracknell	Winterbourne	“Because you think I go round too much with HIM.” And she nodded at her attendant. “Every one thinks so--if you care to know,” said [MASK]. “Of course I care to know!”
<name>Uncle Silas</name>	Uncle Silas	Winterbourne	[MASK] offered no answer to this question; but he presently said, “You were right in that remark that you made last summer. I was booked to make a mistake. I have lived too long in foreign parts.”
<name>Septimius</name>	Septimius	Daisy	The early Roman spring had filled the air with bloom and perfume, and the rugged surface of the Palatine was muffled with tender verdure. [MASK] was strolling along the top of one of those great mounds of ruin that are embanked with mossy marble and paved with monumental inscriptions.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Winterbourne	The figure of a lady appeared at a distance, very indistinct in the darkness, and advancing with a slow and wavering movement. Suddenly it seemed to pause. “Are you sure it is your mother? Can you distinguish her in this thick dusk?” [MASK] asked.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Daisy	It was as if a sudden illumination had been flashed upon the ambiguity of [MASK]’s behavior, and the riddle had become easy to read. She was a young lady whom a gentleman need no longer be at pains to respect.
<name>Meursault</name>	Meursault	Winterbourne	It seemed to [MASK] that he had been in a manner presented. He got up and stepped slowly toward the young girl, throwing away his cigarette. “This little boy and I have made acquaintance,” he said, with great civility.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Randolph	“We were going last week, but my mother gave out. She suffers dreadfully from dyspepsia. She said she couldn’t go. [MASK] wouldn’t go either; he says he doesn’t think much of old castles. But I guess
<name>the man</name>	the man	Winterbourne	“American girls are the best girls,” he said cheerfully to his young companion. “My sister ain’t the best!” the child declared. “She’s always blowing at me.” “I imagine that is your fault, not hers,” said [MASK].
<name>the young man</name>	the young man	Winterbourne	“And I’ll tell you her name;” and he leveled his alpenstock at his sister. “You had better wait till you are asked!” said this young lady calmly. “I should like very much to know your name,” said [MASK].
<name>Christ</name>	Christ	Winterbourne	He saw me, and he cuts me!” What a clever little reprobate she was, and how smartly she played at injured innocence! But he wouldn’t cut her. [MASK] came forward again and went toward the great cross.
<name>Lady Bracknell</name>	Lady Bracknell	Winterbourne	“I said I should take the liberty of introducing her to my admirable aunt.” “I am much obliged to you.” “It was to guarantee my respectability,” said [MASK]. “And pray who is to guarantee hers?”
<name>Ruth</name>	Ruth	Daisy	“How shall I find it?” “By going to see the others.” “What will they do to me?” “They will give you the cold shoulder. Do you know what that means?” [MASK] was looking at him intently; she began to color.
<name>Ethan</name>	Ethan	Daisy	“You are not disposed, madam,” he inquired, “to undertake it yourself?” [MASK]’s mother looked at him an instant askance, and then walked forward in silence. Then--“I guess she had better go alone,” she said simply.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Winterbourne	He poked his alpenstock, lance-fashion, into [MASK]’s bench and tried to crack the lump of sugar with his teeth. “Oh, blazes; it’s har-r-d!” he exclaimed, pronouncing the adjective in a peculiar manner.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Winterbourne	“I beg you, madam, to let her go,” said [MASK] ardently; for he had never yet enjoyed the sensation of guiding through the summer starlight a skiff freighted with a fresh and beautiful young girl. “I shouldn’t think she’d want to,” said her mother.
<name>Mrs. Struthers</name>	Mrs. Struthers	Daisy	“Does she never allow you more than three days at a time?” asked [MASK] ironically. “Doesn’t she give you a vacation in summer? There’s no one so hard worked but they can get leave to go off somewhere at this season.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Winterbourne	As the day was splendid, however, and the concourse of vehicles, walkers, and loungers numerous, the young Americans found their progress much delayed. This fact was highly agreeable to [MASK], in spite of his consciousness of his singular situation.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Daisy	“Do, then, let me give you a row,” he said to the young girl. “It’s quite lovely, the way you say that!” cried [MASK]. “It will be still more lovely to do it.”
<name>Archer</name>	Archer	Winterbourne	[MASK], laughing, answered that he had met Germans who spoke like Americans, but that he had not, so far as he remembered, met an American who spoke like a German. Then he asked her if she should not be more comfortable in sitting upon the bench which he had just quitted.
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	Randolph	“He’s an American man!” cried [MASK], in his little hard voice. The young lady gave no heed to this announcement, but looked straight at her brother. “Well, I guess you had better be quiet,” she simply observed.
<name>he</name>	he	Winterbourne	Only, if she is not engaged, I’m sure I’m glad to know it.” But, as [MASK] had said, it mattered very little. A week after this, the poor girl died; it had been a terrible case of the fever.
<name>Newland</name>	Newland	Winterbourne	In answer to [MASK]’s inquiries, his friend narrated that the pretty American girl--prettier than ever--was seated with a companion in the secluded nook in which the great papal portrait was enshrined. “Who was her companion?”
<name>Darcy</name>	Darcy	Winterbourne	She was bareheaded, but she balanced in her hand a large parasol, with a deep border of embroidery; and she was strikingly, admirably pretty. “How pretty they are!” thought [MASK], straightening himself in his seat, as if he were prepared to rise.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Winterbourne	[MASK] wondered whether she was seriously wounded, and for a moment almost wished that her sense of injury might be such as to make it becoming in him to attempt to reassure and comfort her. He had a pleasant sense that she would be very approachable for consolatory purposes.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Winterbourne	“I don’t believe that there is anything to be called an intrigue.” “I have heard a dozen people speak of it; they say she is quite carried away by him.” “They are certainly very intimate,” said [MASK].
<name>He</name>	He	Winterbourne	she said suddenly. “Why don’t you say so? You needn’t be afraid. I’m not afraid!” And she gave a little laugh. [MASK] fancied there was a tremor in her voice; he was touched, shocked, mortified by it.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Winterbourne	“Yes; he wants to go right home. He hasn’t got any boys here. There is one boy here, but he always goes round with a teacher; they won’t let him play.” “And your brother hasn’t any teacher?” [MASK] inquired.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Winterbourne	It would have been most unkind; he had been talking about that walk for ten days.” “He should not have talked about it at all,” said [MASK]; “he would never have proposed to a young lady of this country to walk about the streets with him.”
<name>Alec</name>	Alec	Winterbourne	the young girl replied serenely. “I told her she could wear it. She won’t come here because she sees you.” “Ah, then,” said [MASK], “I had better leave you.” “Oh, no; come on!”
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Winterbourne	“Yes; you can go in the cars,” [MASK] assented. “Our courier says they take you right up to the castle,” the young girl continued. “We were going last week, but my mother gave out. She suffers dreadfully from dyspepsia.
<name>Mrs. Pontellier</name>	Mrs. Pontellier	Winterbourne	Then--“I guess she had better go alone,” she said simply. [MASK] observed to himself that this was a very different type of maternity from that of the vigilant matrons who massed themselves in the forefront of social intercourse in the dark old city at the other end of the lake.
<name>Mr. Sherlock Holmes</name>	Mr. Sherlock Holmes	Winterbourne	[MASK] had immediately perceived that he might have the honor of claiming him as a fellow countryman. “Take care you don’t hurt your teeth,” he said, paternally. “I haven’t got any teeth to hurt. They have all come out.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Winterbourne	[MASK] had now begun to think simply of the craziness, from a sanitary point of view, of a delicate young girl lounging away the evening in this nest of malaria. What if she WERE a clever little reprobate? that was no reason for her dying of the perniciosa.
<name>Mr. Otis</name>	Mr. Otis	Winterbourne	And when she has got on my shawl, too! She is always wearing my things.” The lady in question, ceasing to advance, hovered vaguely about the spot at which she had checked her steps. “I am afraid your mother doesn’t see you,” said [MASK].
<name>Lucie</name>	Lucie	Daisy	[MASK] stopped and looked at him, without a sign of troubled consciousness in her face, with nothing but the presence of her charming eyes and her happy dimples. “Well, she’s a cool one!” thought the young man.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Winterbourne	It was the courier probably who introduced him; and if he succeeds in marrying the young lady, the courier will come in for a magnificent commission.” “I don’t believe she thinks of marrying him,” said [MASK], “and I don’t believe he hopes to marry her.”
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Winterbourne	They had the good fortune to have been able to walk about without other companionship than that of the custodian; and [MASK] arranged with this functionary that they should not be hurried--that they should linger and pause wherever they chose.
<name>the courier</name>	the courier	Winterbourne	she said. “I shall not be happy till we go!” he protested. “And you are staying in this hotel?” she went on. “And you are really an American?” The courier stood looking at [MASK] offensively.
<name>Oscar</name>	Oscar	Winterbourne	“Of course she’s pretty. But she is very common.” “I see what you mean, of course,” said [MASK] after another pause. “She has that charming look that they all have,” his aunt resumed.
<name>Monte</name>	Monte	Giovanelli	This is the way people catch it. I wonder,” he added, turning to [MASK], “that you, a native Roman, should countenance such a terrible indiscretion.” “Ah,” said the handsome native, “for myself I am not afraid.”
<name>The young girl</name>	The young girl	Winterbourne	“I arrived only yesterday.” “I don’t believe that!” the young girl declared. [MASK] turned with a protesting smile to her mother, but this lady evaded his glance, and, seating herself, fixed her eyes upon her son.
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Winterbourne	The young girl looked at him more gravely, but with eyes that were prettier than ever. “I have never allowed a gentleman to dictate to me, or to interfere with anything I do.” “I think you have made a mistake,” said [MASK].
<name>Meg</name>	Meg	Daisy	this young lady inquired, but by no means with that harshness of accent which her choice of words may imply. “I don’t know,” said her mother, turning toward the lake again. “I shouldn’t think you’d want that shawl!” [MASK] exclaimed.
<name>George</name>	George	Winterbourne	No; it’s impossible to be prettier than that, thought [MASK]. “There are half a dozen boats moored at that landing place,” he said, pointing to certain steps which descended from the garden to the lake.
<name>Russians</name>	Russians	Italians	But we only had about a week of that, and now I’m enjoying myself. I know ever so many people, and they are all so charming. The society’s extremely select. There are all kinds--English, and Germans, and [MASK].
