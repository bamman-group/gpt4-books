<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Elizabeth	She was still very poorly, and [MASK] would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go downstairs herself.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	“And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day's journey. Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance.” “I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_ of the match,” cried [MASK].
<name>Darcy</name>	Darcy	Darcy	There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all [MASK]'s; but you shall do as you choose.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Elizabeth	I would go and see her if I could have the carriage.” [MASK], feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walking was her only alternative.
<name>Kitty</name>	Kitty	Kitty	She then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to [MASK], “Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,” took her out of the room.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, but in vain; [MASK] would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Wickham	When to these recollections was added the development of [MASK]'s character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Darcy	“Come, [MASK],” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better dance.” “I certainly shall not.
<name>Edmond</name>	Edmond	Elizabeth	“May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?” “Take whatever you like, and get away.” [MASK] took the letter from his writing-table, and they went up stairs together.
<name>Lizzy</name>	Lizzy	Lizzy	Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms.” “[MASK],” said her father, “I have given him my consent.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest of her life.” With this answer [MASK] was forced to be content; but her own opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	“Well, and what news does it bring--good or bad?” “What is there of good to be expected?” said he, taking the letter from his pocket. “But perhaps you would like to read it.” [MASK] impatiently caught it from his hand.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Elizabeth	[MASK] could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Jane	“But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their marriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular friend, you see by [MASK]'s account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	“I must ask whether you were surprised?” said [MASK]. “Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.” “That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Bingley	Shall you like to have such a brother?” “Very, very much. Nothing could give either [MASK] or myself more delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you really love him quite well enough?
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Lydia	This invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and [MASK] to each other, and out of their _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Charlotte	How could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other? He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment; and she could not help remembering what [MASK]'s opinion had always been.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	I am impatient to see him.” “In point of composition,” said [MASK], “the letter does not seem defective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I think it is well expressed.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Elizabeth	[MASK], who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	She will be down in a moment, I dare say.” He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister. [MASK] honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Lydia	And tell my dear [MASK] not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all.”
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	[MASK] saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.
<name>Bingley</name>	Bingley	Bingley	I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement.” [MASK] looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.” The tumult of [MASK]'s mind was allayed by this conversation.
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	Wickham	The reason why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that [MASK]'s character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and [MASK], as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she was.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	“It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,” replied [MASK], with tears in her eyes, “that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Jane	“Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than [MASK]. But will they make you happy?”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Jane	“Very true, indeed; and now, my dear [MASK], what have you got to say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business? Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody.”
<name>Darcy</name>	Darcy	Darcy	“There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!” “I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,” said [MASK].
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Wickham	She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by [MASK]. “I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?”
<name>Gardiner</name>	Gardiner	GARDINER	We have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on. Yours, etc., “EDW. [MASK].”
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	But who was your mother? Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition.” “Whatever my connections may be,” said [MASK], “if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.”
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	No scheme could have been more agreeable to [MASK], and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. “Oh, my dear, dear aunt,” she rapturously cried, “what delight! what felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Lizzy	Then after a short silence he continued: “[MASK], I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.”
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Charlotte	A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of [MASK] and her sister, just returned from her walk. The tete-a-tete surprised them.
<name>Edmund</name>	Edmund	Bingley	[MASK] was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor; but [MASK] saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Georgiana	I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement, and then [MASK], unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I acted.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Lizzy	“And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business.” “Speak to [MASK] about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him.” “Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.”
<name>Darnay</name>	Darnay	Darcy	In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself? or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?” “You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns,” said [MASK], in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.
<name>Darcy</name>	Darcy	Darcy	But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.” “Undoubtedly,” replied [MASK], to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, “there is a meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Elizabeth	[MASK] was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough. But it was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Kitty	No, [MASK], I have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter into my house again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	“If you believed it impossible to be true,” said [MASK], colouring with astonishment and disdain, “I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far. What could your ladyship propose by it?” “At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lydia	“And we mean to treat you all,” added [MASK], “but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.” Then, showing her purchases--“Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Caroline	It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of the day.” “Much more rational, my dear [MASK], I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball.”
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Charlotte	And what sort of table do they keep? [MASK] is an excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_ housekeeping, I dare say.”
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth--“there	The wisest and the best of men--nay, the wisest and best of their actions--may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke.” “Certainly,” replied [MASK] are such people, but I hope I am not one of _them_.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Lydia	Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a young woman of [MASK]'s connections, which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything?
<name>Bingley</name>	Bingley	Bingley	But, perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture. [MASK], she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Fitzwilliam	It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case.” “That is not an unnatural surmise,” said [MASK], “but it is a lessening of the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly.”
<name>Darcy</name>	Darcy	Darcy	They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.” “Aye--that is because you have the right disposition. But that gentleman,” looking at [MASK], “seemed to think the country was nothing at all.”
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Lizzy	But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, [MASK], that obstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times, but _this_ is the true one.
<name>Darcy</name>	Darcy	Darcy	and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and ridicule.” “And this,” cried [MASK], as he walked with quick steps across the room, “is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me!
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Caroline	It appeared to her merely the suggestion of [MASK]'s interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Jane	Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then. It is something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction among her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to be long outdone by [MASK].
<name>Hammersmith</name>	Hammersmith	Hertfordshire	It was as follows: “MY DEAR SIR, “I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from [MASK].
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	[MASK] made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him. He took the hint, and soon began with, “This seems a very comfortable house.
<name>Bingley</name>	Bingley	Bingley	“Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I tell you all.” “What do you mean?” “Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do [MASK].
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	“Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?” “Both,” replied [MASK] archly; “for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Jane	On this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of [MASK] not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	It is admirable!” [MASK] tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her. “Are you not diverted?” “Oh! yes.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Lydia	At first there seemed danger of [MASK]'s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular.
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	Wickham	“I have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable.” “I have no right to give _my_ opinion,” said [MASK], “as to his being agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Jane	“There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased, [MASK]? Shall you like to have such a brother?” “Very, very much.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Lydia	She will follow wherever [MASK] leads. Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?”
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Bingley	the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!” In a few minutes she was joined by [MASK], whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose. “Where is your sister?” said he hastily, as he opened the door.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	“No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night.” “That would be a good scheme,” said [MASK], “if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home.”
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	[MASK] said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From what can it proceed?
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Elizabeth	Her mother's ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed him more painful to [MASK]'s mind; and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	Wickham	“Can it be possible that he will marry her?” “[MASK] is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,” said her sister. “My dear father, I congratulate you.” “And have you answered the letter?”
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Jane	My dear [MASK], I am in such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and you write for me. We will settle with your father about the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.”
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Jane	Their first object was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute inquiries, that though [MASK] always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to hope that they would not continue long.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	[MASK] read on: “I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will not be long before they are.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	“He has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed it possible.” “I suspected as much,” replied [MASK].
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	“Indeed,” replied [MASK], “I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me. You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?” “Blame you!
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Lydia	What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.” “Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear [MASK], I don't at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?”
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Jane	She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but [MASK]; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Charlotte	She inquired into [MASK]'s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Charlotte	She had always felt that [MASK]'s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Elizabeth	and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything.” [MASK] could bear it no longer.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Elizabeth	[MASK], though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to be off as soon as possible.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Jane	Good-bye.” She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two. [MASK] was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Charlotte	“It keeps him in good humour,” said she, “and I am more obliged to you than I can express.” [MASK] assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly seen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance.” “Yes, very indifferent indeed,” said [MASK], laughingly.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Lydia	His letter was soon dispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother, but was too angry with [MASK] to send any message to her.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Elizabeth	But do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might be of service--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything.” [MASK] was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	“She had better have stayed at home,” cried [MASK]; “perhaps she _meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one's neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence insufferable.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	[MASK] smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants. At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge, everything declared they were arriving.
<name>Maria</name>	Maria	Maria	She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister [MASK] in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here.
<name>Pemberley</name>	Pemberley	Pemberley	but she had not got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of [MASK] from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed, and she said no more.
<name>Darcy</name>	Darcy	Darcy	[MASK] had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly! “A man who has once been refused!
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Lizzy	“Oh! [MASK], why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but such another man for you!”
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	Wickham	“I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man.” [MASK] only shook his head. “I wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether he is likely to be in this country much longer.”
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Wickham	Brother-in-law of [MASK]! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He had, to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Elizabeth	Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest [MASK]! What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Lizzy	She was gone directly. Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious. “[MASK],” said he, “what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?”
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Jane	She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had not [MASK], though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted.
