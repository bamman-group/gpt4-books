<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Hollis	[MASK] put his hand on her shoulder and noted she wasn’t shaking. This was a very cool woman, he thought. The heavy wooden door to the morgue opened, revealing a man wearing the uniform of a KGB colonel. The man said in English, “Come in.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Hollis	“Yes. I’m glad we had a chance to talk.” The food arrived, and [MASK] inquired, “What the hell is this?” “That’s dovta, a soup made of sour milk and rice. This cuisine is similar to Turkish.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Sam	That shouldn’t make you a target, but you never know what they’ve talked themselves into. Still want to go?” “Yes.” “Why?” “Why are you going, [MASK]? Anybody from the consular section could go.”
<name>Andrei</name>	Andrei	Alevy	She was lighdy freckled, with reddish auburn hair. She was not the type of woman you forgot meeting, and in fact, he had not forgotten the times theyd met in the embassy. He also knew that she and [MASK] had been recent lovers.
<name>Wainwright</name>	Wainwright	Fields	“Yes, a lieutenant colonel named [MASK]. I know him and his wife. They’re trying to get him here before I leave, and if they do, I’ll introduce you to him. His wife will probably come in later.”
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Lisa	[MASK] composed herself and said, “You were cruel.” “I know that.” “But, why . . . how could you be so hard on men who have suffered so much?” “I can’t endorse what they’ve done.”
<name>Rick</name>	Rick	Hollis	He said, “Ground speed, about thirty.” [MASK] saw that the freighter’s stern was going to pass by before he reached it, so he put the helicopter into a sliding flight toward port as he continued his shallow powerglide approach.
<name>They</name>	They	SDI	They think were trying to sabotage their diplomatic initiatives.” “Where would they get an idea like that?” “Beats me. Anyway, [MASK] would be harmless except that they’re an arm of the venerable and powerful Department of State.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Sasha	[MASK] continued, “You should go there on Sunday. The believers have mass in the cathedral there. I went once. It was very ... interesting. Then go to the cemetery there too. You like our writers?
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Hollis	He turned her hand so the ash spilled out, and wiped her palm on his knee. She said, “It doesn’t matter.” [MASK] knew the room was wired to pick up the slightest whisper, and even in the dark, the fiber-optic device could see them.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Hollis	You began talking, enjoying the company, and when you were talked out, you were sent to a regular prison camp or shot. There was some advantage in knowing what was coming, [MASK] thought, but no comfort in the knowledge.
<name>Johnson</name>	Johnson	Alevy	There will just be a hell of a bad time down there and maybe an unmarked grave in this Russian forest. So I thank you again for volunteering.” None of them responded. [MASK] looked at his watch. It was 2:03 A.M.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Hollis	“[MASK].” “Oh....” She stood. “I didn’t recognize you in civvies.” “Have we met?” “A few times.” She regarded him a moment. He was wearing a leather bomber jacket, jeans, and leather boots.
<name>Harding</name>	Harding	Fisher	They would like to know why you have been declared persona non grata. I referred them all to the press office, of course. But they all want to speak to you off the record.” “Did any of them mention [MASK]?” “Yes, sir.
<name>Casey</name>	Casey	O’Shea	[MASK] began a sloping descent toward the helipad. “This is it.” The ground light moved away from them, and the beam dropped, sweeping back and forth over the grass clearing, showing them the way.
<name>Alexei</name>	Alexei	Hollis	“Have sixty kopeks ready.” [MASK] heard a series of clicks as the call was routed through the Moscow operator, then through the KGB listening station on the way to the embassy. The phone rang twice before his direct office line was picked up.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Hollis	There was a stack of brown bread and a bowl of butter on the table. [MASK] spoke to the two teenagers about school, then asked, “What is your favorite subject?” The boy smiled and answered in English, “English.”
<name>Darry</name>	Darry	Alevy	And there’s never a cop around when you need one.” [MASK] added, “He made it back here instead of going to a hospital. He got his nose broken again, but he says he got a few licks in.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Hollis	[MASK] got out of his warm-up suit, and they embraced. He kissed her on the lips, then the breasts, then knelt and ran his tongue over her belly, down to her pubic hair, and touched his tongue to her labia.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Kay	“They don’t give a damn. This whole fucking country is on a lifetime hardship tour, and the government put them there.” [MASK] added, “It helps if you have a lover.” “No, it doesn’t.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Hollis	“Good.” [MASK] thought that this operation had all the “S” elements of a successful covert operation—surprise, speed, security, and secrecy. But if the secrecy was blown, they’d have to contend with six hundred Border Guards.
<name>Hollis</name>	Hollis	Hollis	dangerous to have ... I mean, the Charm School never existed.” [MASK] replied, “I think it would be dangerous for us not to have it. This is the only real evidence that you and I have that the Charm School did exist.
<name>Ryan</name>	Ryan	Hollis	The man was a good thirty feet ahead of him, heading toward the cells, then suddenly drew up short, skidded over the painted concrete floor, and turned his body toward the intersecting corridor as his legs pumped. [MASK] fired twice, and the man fired back once before he disappeared into the next corridor.
<name>Olga</name>	Olga	Lisa	The Russian peasant, he thought. Subject of literature, folklore, and college professors. But no one understood their inner lives. [MASK] looked around the room and met each pair of eyes. She said spontaneously, “I am happy to be here.”
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Sam	He was human too.” She took his hand. “You’ve made me feel better.” “Good. And you’ll feel a lot better if we can even the score here.” “I don’t want to talk about that, [MASK].
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Alevy	I know that religious observances can attract the K-goons. I know the ambassador would not like you annoying our host government.” “Fuck his excellency.” [MASK] added, “Jews are politically unreliable here, so you can fraternize with them.”
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Hollis	[MASK] moved his legs, then his arms, but didn’t feel any lack of coordination. His vision was good, and his other senses seemed all right. He smelled a faint odor of vomit and realized it was coming from his sweat shirt.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Stoi	Someone yelled, “[MASK]!” The action in the roped-off section of the lobby stopped. The CIA man who had been judo-chopped stood and shouted, “Cant you explain to that cretin how to fake a chop? He nearly broke my neck.”
<name>Andrei</name>	Andrei	Hollis	[MASK] looked up and saw the towering red brick chancery building, its windows all alight as per the ambassadors orders. A few minutes later he saw the red brick walls and the embassy residences that rose above them. The streets were deserted, and the low ground was covered with a blanket of river fog.
<name>Vasily</name>	Vasily	Hollis	Grey ash lay where kitchen gardens and haystacks once were. A bulldozer had dug a long slit in the black earth, and half the burned village had already been pushed into it. [MASK] looked away from the window.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Hollis	Therefore, the ambassador has requested that you stay inside the compound until you are both driven to the airport by security personnel, Monday morning. That will not cause you any hardship, I trust.” [MASK] replied, “No, it won’t, since I’m not taking orders from the ambassador.
<name>Illya</name>	Illya	Hollis	“Thank you.” “They have better things in our Baltic republics. I never understood that.” She handed [MASK] the tickets. “Have a safe journey.” “Thank you.” The train gathered speed on the straight, flat trackbed.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Hollis	Near that very tall pine tree. I think I passed it.” “Thank you.” [MASK] moved past her. She said to him or to herself, “But you never know. Even the dead disappear here.”
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Hollis	The pine boughs on the far side of the small clearing moved, then parted. A small doe entered the clearing and came toward them, then abruptly stopped not ten feet away, sniffed the still, heavy air, turned, and ran. [MASK] holstered his pistol and stood.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Surikov	Perhaps. But you know, General, we don’t need any more information on this school. We know where it is, and we have enough information already to precipitate an international crisis.” He looked at [MASK]. “You know what I need.”
<name>He</name>	He	Hollis	“There’s someone outside.” [MASK] opened his eyes and heard the creak of a door. “The bathroom is outside.” “Oh.” There were noises coming from the kitchen, and a rooster’s crowing cut through the dawn.
<name>He</name>	He	Hollis	“Twenty months. Maybe less now. What will we do if one of us leaves before the other?” [MASK] didn’t reply, and she said, “Step at a time.” She motioned to the staircase. “Let’s do those steps first.”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Hollis	“The American embassy, perhaps?” He glanced at the pilot and said, “Neither of us would have flown you there.” [MASK] got his bag and held it in his cuffed hands. He stood, crouched over in the low cabin.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Fisher	Really.” He rolled up the windows and lost himself in the music. [MASK] pressed on the gas pedal until he was well past the speed limit. “Haven’t seen a traffic cop in the last thousand miles. They never heard of radar here.”
<name>John</name>	John	Mills	But now that we are ...” “Well... I suppose we can say your helicopter accident was a case of mistaken identity. I guess we can work out your resurrection.” “Thank you. You worked out our death real well.” [MASK] smiled with embarrassment.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Hollis	As people. It will help you professionally as well as personally if you understand them.” “I try. We all try.” “Do we?” She glanced at the door, but there was no sign of [MASK].
<name>Griffin</name>	Griffin	Alevy	They had calculated the odds and found them slightly better than Russian roulette with a five-chambered revolver. They were all damned scared but damned excited too. [MASK] could almost feel the energy, the anticipation of actually seeing if a chalkboard play would work on the ground.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Fisher	[MASK] stepped out into the lobby and felt somewhat better in a public place. He found the foreign exchange window, but it was closed. He went to the front desk and asked the clerk if she would cash an Intourist voucher for five rubles.
<name>He</name>	He	Hollis	"It was the first thing you asked.” “He was my responsibility.” “I like that.” He glanced at her. The elevator stopped at the sixth floor, and they stepped across the corridor to an interior room. [MASK] pressed a buzzer.
<name>Steve</name>	Steve	Simms	You know about all that?” “No.” “You want to know?” “Some other time.” “Okay. Hey, sorry about [MASK]. But there are probably a few other guys here you know from our bunch.
<name>Jonas</name>	Jonas	Pavel	“Did you ever want to go to church?” [MASK] scratched his head. “I don’t know. Maybe if I could talk to a priest I could answer you. I’ve never seen a priest, but I know what they look like from books.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Lisa	[MASK] whistled. “Nice body.” “Cut it out.” He looked at her standing naked by the electric heater gathering her clothes from between the quilts. “You don’t have fat thighs, but your feet are big.”
<name>Werner</name>	Werner	Alevy	“You’ll meet him soon enough.” They kept walking quickly up the tree-lined path, toward the bell tower. [MASK] said, “The other reason I came is that we got a communication this morning from the Soviet Foreign Ministry.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Burov	“I don’t know yet.” “What did you do while I was gone?” “[MASK] stopped by.” “What did he want?” “He just wanted to see how we were getting on.”
<name>She</name>	She	Hollis	“Keep low.” He pulled her away from the cabin and toward the clearing where they knelt in the knee-high grass. About a hundred meters out, [MASK] could see the white helicopter against the black tree line beyond it.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Lisa	Protocol did demand however, that, as a married man whose wife was temporarily out of town, he arrive without a woman. [MASK] had gone on ahead, and he saw her across the room, talking to some people from her office.
<name>Arkady</name>	Arkady	Lisa	“Yes, it was.” “He drove right by the embassy.” “I know.” They crossed the Outer Ring highway, and [MASK] informed him, “There used to be signs on this road reading ‘Forward to Communism.’
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Alevy	Though I don’t suppose anyone would know that if they didn’t speak a bit of Russian.” “Art imitates life,” [MASK] said. “I always thought it was the other way around. Well, I must be going. Good evening.”
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Alevy	“At the bell tower.” They walked through the arched passage into the convent grounds. The drizzle was turning to light rain. [MASK] asked, “Did we get lucky?” “We hit the jackpot.” “The Charm School?” “Yes.
<name>Ryan</name>	Ryan	Alevy	“Interesting point,” [MASK] conceded. “And that’s part of the complexity of the problem we face. This new guy has inherited three hundred American POWs. But it’s the KGB who runs that camp. How much has the KGB told him about the camp?
<name>Hal</name>	Hal	O’Shea	[MASK] said, “Well, I’ve logged enough time on this to give it a try. But if you want to take it in, you’re the skipper.” “We’ll arm-wrestle for the honor as we make our final approach.”
<name>Wolfe</name>	Wolfe	Alevy	Within a few minutes they could see the illuminated center of the small town where the two main streets crossed; the north- south street leading to the bridge and the east-west street, which was the old Minsk—Moscow road. [MASK] said, “Drop to about five hundred and follow the river.”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Burov	“Yes?” [MASK] looked at him. “You’ve heard that? Well, you can tell your compatriots that I’m prepared to shoot as many of their wives and girlfriends as I have to if they even think of trouble.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Hollis	“Come with me.” [MASK] was led to the front of the reception hall where there was a raised platform on which stood a podium and microphone. A four-piece combo of volunteer musicians were grouped around the big Steinway piano.
<name>Arkady</name>	Arkady	Sasha	[MASK] said in Russian, “I have to ask where the cemetery is.” He stopped the car and asked a passing boy on a bicycle. The boy pointed. “That road. You’ll see his grave easily enough. There are students there.”
<name>John</name>	John	Alevy	I was willing to share any danger with you, and I will give him the same loyalty.” [MASK] looked at her, and a sad smile came across his face. He nodded. “That’s why I love you.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Brennan	“Where we re going you'll see about five hundred more of those scary outfits.” “Thanks,” [MASK] said. The minutes passed in silence except for the ticking of the cooling engine and the sound of popping bubble gum.
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Lisa	“He just wanted to see how we were getting on.” “That bastard/” “Don’t let these people get to you, [MASK].” “It’s him. He ... he hit you, he slapped me .. . he . . .”
<name>Orwell</name>	Orwell	Hollis	But even as he spoke, [MASK] realized that the farm questions were pardy metaphor. What the average Russian feared, above all else, was besporyadok— chaos, a world without order, a state without a powerful vozhd, without a Stalin, a czar-father to look after them.
<name>Jonas</name>	Jonas	Mills	Do it without me.” “Then go. I don’t need either of you.” “I’ll go if you let me take [MASK]. He doesn’t deserve to die for your immortality.” “What the hell are you talking about?”
<name>Thursday</name>	Thursday	Hollis	In recent years we’ve sacrificed quality for quantity. There are many who long to return to the time when shoddy goods and bad buildings were punished by firing squad.” “There are probably less extreme methods of quality control,” [MASK] said dryly.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Hollis	[MASK] took the elevator back up to the top floor and went to the lounge. He ordered a Dewars and soda at the service bar and said to the bartender in Russian, “Have you seen my friend yet?” “No. I’m sorry.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Lisa	He stared at [MASK] awhile, then asked her, “I was wondering if you would like to work here. In this house. To teach my Natalia English. She is ten now. Perhaps you could be a sort of governess.”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Hollis	[MASK] added, “Thanks for coming then.” “According to international law, your immunity is now good only between the embassy and a point of departure from the country. Therefore, your ass is hanging out here. So is hers, obviously.”
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Rooney	“I’m here.” [MASK] smiled. “Well, you guys probably want to snoop around a little, so we won’t keep you. But were having a party Friday night. You’ll get a chance to meet a lot of the people here.
<name>Stanton</name>	Stanton	Hollis	“I hope you’re not here twenty years, but if you are, I hope you can maintain your own sense of duty and honor.” [MASK] said, “You mean you’d like to see me eat my words.”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Hollis	“Saying good-bye to my secretary.” “You’d better not be, [MASK]. Are you coming home tonight?” Home. The word took him by surprise. “I have a midnight meeting with the political affairs officer.” “Where?”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Poole	[MASK] took a drink and continued, “Also, you have to be extremely aware of the directional microphones outdoors. They’re in the watchtowers. You have to get low, into gullies and ravines, and swish pine branches around when you speak.”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Alevy	He smelled of burnt gasoline, and his clothes were singed. “You hit?” “I’m all right. I got away from the car before it blew. Well, are we waiting for anything?” “Just you,” [MASK] replied.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Fisher	He pulled onto the immaculate, white concrete and stopped beside a yellow pump. A man in clean blue overalls sat in a chair outside a white concrete-block building reading a book. The man peered over the book. [MASK] got out of the car and approached him.
<name>Stuart</name>	Stuart	Hollis	Now they’re useless. Why not dispose of them? What good are they now? That is the question. Do you know the answer?” “I’ll think about it.” The telephone rang, and [MASK] said, “That might be for me.”
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Burov	But with the introduction of good housing and this spa, [MASK] was bogged down in what he would call American decadence, if he thought about it. They left the underground complex by way of the elevator, which brought them back up into the concrete bunker.
<name>Max</name>	Max	Lisa	“I’d like a meeting with you for eleven A.M.” “I have a meeting with two Red Air Force colonels at ten-thirty.” “That’s been canceled.” “By whom}” “Also ask [MASK] to be there.
<name>Milo</name>	Milo	Hollis	“So to pick up where we left off, what are those three hundred American fliers doing in that prison to earn their keep? To keep from being shot?” “Let’s back up a minute,” [MASK] said.
<name>---</name>	---	Lisa	Anyway, I still love you. Why don’t we talk—” “We talked.” “I should really be angry. What happened out there in that village?” “It’s in my report.” [MASK]— “I have to go.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Hollis	Against the wall in front of him were stacked bales of straw to keep a bullet from ricocheting. “Address your appeal to the Chairman of the Committee for State Security.” [MASK] picked up the pen and asked, “In Russian or English?”
<name>He</name>	He	Alevy	Connect any calls going through this switchboard and listen in. With your other ear, monitor the traffic on these two radios. Okay?” She nodded. [MASK] said to her, “We shouldn’t be more than fifteen minutes.
<name>He</name>	He	Burov	He held her closer, and she put her head on his shoulder. She said softly, “[MASK] tried to make me hate you. He said I was here because I was an accomplice to the murders you committed. But I knew that was a lie.
<name>Alex</name>	Alex	Hollis	They want honest Russian patriots. Men who had volunteered to be Air Force pilots. Men, I suppose, who would have something in common with their American instructors.” [MASK] nodded. “Like when it was a training school for pilots.”
<name>He</name>	He	Hollis	“Well, I’ll take it up with my people. It’s not that we don’t want to, it’s just that it’s dangerous. For you.” Actually, [MASK] thought, it was more that they didn't want to.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Banks	“That’s reassuring.” She added, “I do appreciate your position.” [MASK] smiled tightly. “Do you? Let me tell you that I personally admire your sense of integrity and moral courage. And entre nous, the ambassador is similarly impressed.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Lisa	[MASK], who hadn’t spoken in some time, said, “I don’t want to hear about any more murders, please.” No one said anything, and the only sound was from the turbines and rotor blades.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Alevy	He thought that [MASK] could well have waited to talk to him when he got to his office. He thought about life inside the red brick walls. Here you could bowl, swim in the indoor pool, play squash, or see the weekly movie in the theater.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Hollis	Few minutes.” He closed the door and walked around the room, examining it. He picked up a stack of magazines, then looked at the videotapes on the bookshelves. “Incredible.” [MASK] came back into the room. “She’s coming.”
<name>Vadim</name>	Vadim	Lisa	“Eat it.” She hesitated, then popped it into her mouth. “Good. See if anyone has orange juice.” “Low profile. Feign sleep or simplemindedness.” [MASK] whispered in Russian, “Can I smoke?” “Not here.
<name>Yes</name>	Yes	Rhodes	Certainly, she thought, the most frozen empire that ever existed; a civilization whose roots seemed tenuously sunk into the thin soil like the fragile white birch. The internal phone rang. She turned from the window and answered it. “[MASK].”
<name>She</name>	She	Hollis	His skin was too pale, but it seemed more a result of too little sun than any unhealthiness. [MASK] thought he looked like a man who had borne too much, too long, and had borne it alone.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Hollis	[MASK] examined an icon on the wall. “Is that real?” “Yes. My grandmother’s. I’m going to have a tough time trying to get it back out of the country.” “I’ll put it in the diplomatic bag.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Hollis	.. Were going to get a closer look at it now, aren’t we?” “Yes.” [MASK] added, “They are going to question you, so the less you know, the better.” “Question me? Interrogate me?”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	O'Shea	He put pressure on the right foot pedal to bring the nose back to a constant heading. The helicopter rose vertically in a cloud of sand and gravel. [MASK] let it rise, checking the torque gauge and the rpm as he held it steady in its vertical climb.
<name>He</name>	He	Hollis	He poured the champagne into two fluted glasses and handed one to her. He said, “Not the end, but the beginning.” “Oh .. . oh, I love you!” She embraced him, spilling champagne on his trench coat. [MASK] kissed her.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Hollis	[MASK] got up to get water. The water pressure was low, and he knew from experience that this meant it was dawn. He heard footsteps, and the door opened. The guard said, “Stand up. Follow me. No talking.”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Alevy	The sergeant sat up quickly and hit his head on the top bunk, then scrambled out of the bed and stood naked at attention. The woman pulled the sheets over her head. [MASK] asked, “Sergeant, where are the other guards and drivers?”
<name>James</name>	James	Hollis	It won’t make it to its hundredth birthday.” [MASK] replied dryly, “I’d hate to think what these people will come up with next.” “Are you really so hard-line, or are you just giving me a hard time?”
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Burov	And if you ever cock your finger under my nose again, you’d better be prepared to lose it. Now, do you have something for us to sign?” “I’m sure.” [MASK] opened a green file folder on the desk and withdrew a stack of papers.
