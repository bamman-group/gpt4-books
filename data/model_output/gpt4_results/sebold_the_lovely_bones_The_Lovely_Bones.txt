<name>everyone</name>	everyone	Samuel	They were headed toward the cavernous baggage claim when my mother said, “I didn’t bring any bags.” They stood in an awkward cluster, [MASK] looking for the right signs to redirect them back to the parking garage. “Mom,” my sister tried again.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Abbie	“There’s no choice, [MASK],” he said. “What else can I do?” “Go away, start over again,” she said. “Did it work?” They were silent. I reached out my hand and faded away.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Fen	This man had also wanted to sleep with her, but she said no. By then, she knew this wasn’t the road out anymore. From the first night with [MASK] in the innards of the mall she had known the two of them weren’t building anything.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Susie	I barely raised my head. “[MASK],” she said. “I have something to tell you.” She drew me under one of the old-fashioned lampposts and then out of the light. She handed me a piece of paper folded into four.
<name>She</name>	She	Ruana	Reaching almost to the floor, the window in the dining room was interrupted only by the metal baseboard for the heat, which [MASK] liked to keep turned off because the noises it made disturbed her. Outside, she could see the cherry tree, its leaves and flowers all gone.
<name>Michelle</name>	Michelle	Lindsey	THIRTEEN hen she returned to junior high in the fall of 1974, [MASK] was not only the sister of the murdered girl but the child of a “crackpot,” “nutcase,” “looney-tunes,” and the latter hurt her more because it wasn’t true.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Susie	“But...” “I need you to stop. There is nothing, no matter how much we stretch it, to connect him to [MASK]’s death. Howling dogs and bridal tents are not evidence.” “I know he did it,” my father said.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lindsey	I could see the woman near her alight on the dress in greenish envy. At the hospital, my mother was reading aloud to my father from a day-old Evening Bulletin, and he was watching her lips move and not really listening. Wanting to kiss her instead. And [MASK].
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Samuel	How long would he wait? As her eyes mounted the stairs to the first floor before her feet followed, she wished that [MASK] were there to climb down after her and trace her movements, erasing her solitude as he went, fitting into her limbs.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Grandma	“[MASK].” “Hush, I’m thinking.” She held up my favorite church dress. It was blackwatch wool with a Peter Pan collar. I liked it mostly because the skirt was so big I could sit in the pew cross-legged and flounce the hem down to the ground.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Lindsey	Held us heavily and desperately, the doors of his heart opening and closing with the rapidity of stops on an instrument, the quiet felt closures, the ghostly fingering, practice and practice and then, incredibly, sound and melody and warmth. [MASK] stepped forward from her place by the door.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Samuel	And [MASK], to show his support, trained alongside her with no hope of qualifying for anything, he said, other than “fastest guy in shorts.” He could run, even if kicking and fielding and noticing a ball anywhere within his vicinity were all beyond him.
<name>Everyone</name>	Everyone	Len	“[MASK] says that doesn’t mean anything,” or, “I trust the police to find out what happened.” Why, my father wondered, did people trust the police so much? Why not trust instinct?
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Lindsey	[MASK] asked, as she stared out the window. “Go get your father,” my mother said. My sister met my father in the mud room, hanging up his keys and coat. Yes, they would go, he said. Of course they would go.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Samuel	The moisture of the rain on her skin had been replaced by sweat. “I love you,” [MASK] said. “I know.” “No, I mean I love you, and I want to marry you, and I want to live in this house!”
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Ray	“Just have fun, kid.” But when I stood by my locker that afternoon and I heard [MASK]’s voice say my name—this time behind me and not above me—it felt like anything but fun. It didn’t feel not fun either.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Len	Her use of groceries had even made my mother laugh, then wonder if she too should start to beautify. But that was only for a second, because she was thinking of [MASK], not because she was in love with him but because being with him was the fastest way she knew to forget.
<name>Church</name>	Church	Holiday	In the material that was stretched on the underside of the box spring, there was a hole, and stuffed up inside were things I didn’t want anyone else to see. I had to guard it from [MASK] or he would scratch at it to try and pry the objects loose.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Clarissa	“Would you like to join us in the family pew?” “Um” — she looked down at her hands — “I’m with my boyfriend.” My mother had entered some trancelike state and was staring hard at [MASK]’s face.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Marvelous	[MASK], dangerous, wild. “Your husband,” he said. “Kiss me,” she said. “Please.” I was watching a beg for leniency on my mother’s part. My mother was moving physically through time to flee from me.
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Frankenstein	He was driving an orange patchwork car that had been pieced together from so many different versions of the same make and model that it looked like [MASK]’s monster on wheels. A bungee cord held the front hood, which fluttered up and down as it caught the oncoming air.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ruth	I was the one who got to follow and watch, and, as opposed to the giddy choir, I often found these moments as painful as they were amazing. [MASK] would get an image and it would burn into her memory.
<name>James</name>	James	Ruth	I asked, but what had been my voice made no noise in the room. It was then that I noticed it. I was sitting up and watching the others, but [MASK] was lying sprawled across the desk. “Can you throw me a towel?”
<name>Franklin</name>	Franklin	Hal	I couldn’t help but think, as I watched him, of the barrels of toxic fluids that had accrued behind [MASK]’s bike shop where the scrub lining the railroad tracks had offered local companies enough cover to dump a stray container or two.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Keesha	“I saved the Monopoly shoe and then it was gone. You took it! You act like she was yours only! ” “Tell me what you want to say. What’s this about your friend [MASK]’s dad?” “Put the clothes down.”
<name>Amelie</name>	Amelie	Hal	Why not make yourself at home?” I walked past the bed and turned on the light switch on the cord—all the tiny white lights above [MASK]’s bed glittered then, the only light save the dusty light coming from the small back window.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Buckley	but I hope it will be a long time before I see you again.” “I hope so too,” she said. She looked at my family gathered in the room, standing awkwardly about. “[MASK], your mother’s and sister’s hands are full.
<name>Langley</name>	Langley	Len	Officially, he did not exist. What he had left behind were his dollhouses. So [MASK] called the man who sold them for him, and who took commissions from select stores, and the wealthy people who ordered replicas of their own homes. Nothing.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Franny	Then there they were, fireflies lighting up and expanding in howls and swirls as they abandoned human flesh. “Like snowflakes,” [MASK] said, “none of them the same and yet each one, from where we stand, exactly like the one before. ”
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Buckley	My mom had told my baby brother, [MASK], that the corn in the field was inedible when he asked why no one from the neighborhood ate it. “The corn is for horses, not humans,” she said. “Not dogs?”
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Lindsey	In sock feet, [MASK] came silently to the door. She unlocked it as my father drew back and prepared a face that he hoped said “Don’t run.” “What?” she said. Her face was rigid, an affront.
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	Ruana	When they reached the lobby and the doors opened I knew they were meant to be there, the four of them together, alone. While [MASK]’s hands grew wet and swollen paring apple after apple, she began to say the word in her mind, the one she had avoided for years: divorce.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Buckley	But when she looked up and through the window, she swore she saw a young girl wearing the clothes of her youth sitting outside [MASK]’s garden-shed fort and staring back at her. The next moment the girl was gone. She shook it off.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Buckley	We stood—the dead child and the living—on either side of my father, both wanting the same thing. To have him to ourselves forever. To please us both was an impossibility. My father had only missed nighttimes twice in [MASK]’s life.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Lindsey	It was gold and from inside his Hukapoo shirt, he pulled out the other side. It hung around his neck on a rawhide cord. [MASK]’s face flushed; mine flushed up in heaven. I forgot my father in the family room and my mother counting silver.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Buckley	“Oh.” “[MASK]’s with a neighbor,” he said. “Oh.” She was staring at him. In her eyes she was climbing back to the surface. She used his face to climb back to. “Are you okay?”
<name>David</name>	David	Len	Everything that came next was not words. The nurses at their station turned their heads away as [MASK] and my mother touched hands. They extended this privacy veil habitually, as a matter of course, but even so they could see this man meant something to this woman.
<name>David</name>	David	Ray	A cold breeze came in from the outside and then out on the road he could see a mother greet her son. Neither of them smiled. Their heads bent low. Their mouths moved. [MASK] took in the fact that my father was waiting for him inside his home.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Ruth	His hand was inside her shirt. As he inched it up, her giggling increased, but she thwarted his advances each time by twisting or moving an inch or two away. [MASK] stood apart from this, as she did most things.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Buckley	“What?” “You are the spitting image of your father’s mother,” my mother said. “Help me with the bags,” my sister said. They walked to the trunk together as [MASK] led my father up the front path.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Lindsey	“Oh, yes, I’m sorry. I didn’t recognize you.” “Not your job,” he said. There was an awkward pause. “So, [MASK] called me and I brought her here an hour ago.” “Oh.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Lindsey	She leaned her back into my mother’s chest, and my mother rocked her awkwardly on the rug. “You are doing so well, [MASK]; you are keeping your father alive.” And they heard his car pull into the drive.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Ruth	The rabbits loved the trimmed lawns of the athletic fields, and as [MASK] approached she’d see their dark forms line up along the white chalk of the farthest boundaries like some sort of tiny sports team. She liked the idea of this and I did too.
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	Lindsey	He brought the razor blades back, showed [MASK] how to change them, and gave her a few pointers on how best to shave. “Watch out for the ankle and the knee,” he said. “Your mother always called those the danger spots.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Buckley	My mother turned around in her seat. “I’ll try and do something about that,” she said, looking at [MASK] and attempting her first smile. “Fuck you,” my brother whispered without looking up. My mother froze. The car opened up.
<name>He</name>	He	Buckley	He rushed into the family room, and my father picked him up and sat him on his lap. “See this shoe?” my father said. [MASK] nodded his head. “I want you to listen to everything I say about it, okay?”
<name>Harvard</name>	Harvard	Penn	His thinness was a boon to him then, the bones and muscles clearly distinguished beneath the skin. By the time he packed his bags for [MASK], he had committed so many words and their definitions to memory that I grew worried.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Buckley	I could not help myself, it seemed, as I tore at his weakening heart. If he died, I would have him forever. Was this so wrong to want? At home, [MASK] lay in bed in the dark and pulled the sheet up to his chin.
<name>Sharon</name>	Sharon	Lindsey	[MASK] and I thought of it as good-girl time. It meant no peeps out of us as we stayed quiet on the other side of the house, while we used my father’s then sparsely filled den as our playroom. My mother would start preparing us around two.
<name>She</name>	She	Lindsey	He’d been playing Skyscraper and it had yet to collapse. “He’s got a suitcase. ” My mother left her eggnog in the kitchen and came to the front of the house. [MASK] was suffering the mandatory presence in the family room that all holidays required.
<name>his</name>	his	Lens	When she turned, I could see the force of her presence hit him. She was holding my father’s hand. I suddenly felt terribly lonely. My mother wobbled a bit when she met [MASK] eyes, and then she led with what came easiest.
<name>later</name>	later	Lindsey	The bright fire that consumed her brought my mother into that deep, light, dreamlike bliss. The girl was being burned alive, but, first, there had been her body, clean and whole. FOURTEEN or a week [MASK] cased my killer’s house.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Susie	“Do you like him?” “Yes.” “Then what’s the holdup?” “I’m afraid I won’t be good at it.” “[MASK]?” “Yes?” “Just have fun, kid.”
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Lens	My mother grabbed at [MASK] coat and shirt greedily, and he helped her. He watched as she tugged at her own clothes, pulling her sweater over her head, then her mother-jumper, and her turtleneck, until she was left in her underpants and camisole.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Buckley	She had put them down in the basement with a small label that said, simply, SAVE. My father put down his coffee. He walked out through the screened-in porch and strode forward, calling [MASK]’s name.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Susie	“It’s after dark, [MASK],” he said. I wish now that I had known this was weird. I had never told him my name. I guess I thought my father had told him one of the embarrassing anecdotes he saw merely as loving testaments to his children.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Artie	They began to think of whom they could plot to kill. It was all in good fun until 7:15, when my sister walked in. [MASK] watched her get in line. She was still unaware, just picking up on the excitement in the air—figuring the mousetrap competition had been announced.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Buckley	“The shoe,” [MASK] said. “Right, and I’m the car, your sister’s the iron, and your mother is the cannon.” My brother concentrated very hard. “Now let’s put all the pieces on the board, okay?
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	Samuel	“I know.” “No, I mean I love you, and I want to marry you, and I want to live in this house!” “What?” “That hideous, hideous college shit is over! ” [MASK] screamed.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Lindsey	To get the blood back in his heart he needed his child. “I want to be alone,” [MASK] said. “Isn’t that obvious?” “Fm here if you need me,” he said.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Buckley	Something so divine that no one up in heaven could have made it up; the care a child took with an adult. My father draped the sheets around [MASK]’s shoulders and remembered how I would fall out of the tall four-poster bed and onto the rug, never waking up.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Brian	[MASK] was black and white with blame. I heard mumblings in the dirt. I heard my name. I thought I could taste the blood on my father’s face, reach out to draw my fingers across his cut lips, he down with him in my grave.
<name>Miranda</name>	Miranda	Lindsey	[MASK] walked through the hallways and in and out of the rows of lockers — dodging anyone who might be near. I wished I could walk with her, mimic the principal and the way he always started out a meeting in the auditorium: “Your principal is your pal with principles! ”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Buckley	My father’s response times were slower than most, as if he moved in a world where a crushing inevitability had robbed him of any hope of accurate perception. [MASK] tapped on the half-open door of my father’s den. “Come in,” he said.
<name>Buckley</name>	Buckley	Ray	Since Christmas he had come and gone to school as quickly as he could, never lingering. He wanted my killer to be caught almost as much as my parents did. Until he was, [MASK] could not wipe the traces of suspicion off himself, despite his alibi.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Samuel	[MASK] and I saw the tremor. The inside shakeoff of her heart. She was getting so good the cracks and fissures were smaller and smaller. Soon, like a sleight-of-hand trick perfected, no one would see her do it.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Ellis	He had a dog that he dragged around no matter what the dog wanted. It was a small dog and couldn’t run very fast, but [MASK] didn’t care. He would hit it or lift it painfully by the tail.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Buckley	[MASK] asked as my father spread Fluffernutter on wheat bread. He made three. One for himself, one for my mother, and one for his four-year-old son. “Did you put away your game?”
<name>Everyone</name>	Everyone	Grandmother	And they listed the dead they knew. [MASK], grandfather, uncle, aunt, some had a parent, rarer was a sister or brother lost young to an illness — a heart irregularity—leukemia—an unpronounceable disease. No one knew anyone who had been murdered.
<name>She</name>	She	Ruth	So he said, ‘No, honey, horrible things happen close to home, to people we know.’ She thought it was one of her friends.” [MASK] felt a raindrop. “Then my dad broke down and said a little girl had been killed.
<name>Sparky</name>	Sparky	Holiday	And the last two photos in the roll provided the key. He had come home from work—I remember trying to keep my mother’s attention as [MASK] barked when he heard the car pull into the garage. “He’ll come out,” I said.
<name>her</name>	her	Ruth	I could feel the arch of her back against the pavement, and scrapes inside her clothes where flesh had been torn away by the gravel’s sharp edges. I felt every sensation—the warmth of the sun, the smell of the asphalt—but I could not see [MASK].
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Lindsey	He opened the visor of his helmet to yell to her. “This is no good,” he said, “I’m going to roll her under those trees.” [MASK] followed behind him, the sound of rain hushed inside her padded helmet.
<name>Don</name>	Don	Len	That was the role he played in the dance. But what my father had given him offered him little or nothing to work with. “Don’t talk to anyone and don’t approach him again,” [MASK] warned. When my father hung up the phone he felt strangely empty.
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Buck	“Watch out, [MASK],” my father said. “You’ll make Holiday nip.” And sure enough. My father said he wanted to try something out. “We have to see if your old dad can carry you piggyback style again.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Len	“Think of what you’re doing.” “I’m tired of thinking,” she said. Her hair was floating above her head because of the fan beside them — in an aureole. [MASK] blinked as he looked at her.
<name>Dad</name>	Dad	Samuel	They could not run in leather, so they wore their underwear and T-shirts, as close to streakers as anyone in my family would ever be. [MASK], as he had for years, set a pace just ahead of my sister to keep her going.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Ray	That week [MASK] would kiss me by my locker. It didn’t happen up on the scaffold when he’d wanted it to. Our only kiss was like an accident—a beautiful gasoline rainbow. I climbed down off the scaffold with my back to her.
<name>Christmas</name>	Christmas	Christmas	My brother had never been invited to play Monopoly. Everyone said he was too young, but this was the magic of [MASK]. He rushed into the family room, and my father picked him up and sat him on his lap. “See this shoe?”
<name>Locke</name>	Locke	Napoleon	“[MASK].” “Hegel.” There were also the Masters of Arcane Knowledge. Everyone begrudged their presence among the gifteds. These were the kids that could break down an engine and build it back again—no diagrams or instructions needed.
<name>Silently</name>	Silently	Silendy	“Out loud I said I had two children. [MASK] I said three. I always felt like apologizing to her for that.” “Did you mention a husband?” he asked. And she looked at him. “No.” “Man,” he said.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Samuel	“We’ll just lie here and wait until things quiet down.” [MASK]’s back was flush against the ground, and he brought my sister close in to his body to protect her from the dampness of the quick summer rain.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Len	[MASK] was careful. I could see him calculating his words. He made sure to specify so that my parents would be relieved of their first thought — that the police had found my body, that I was, for certain, dead. “What?”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Ray	His lips moved closer, the scaffold fisted. I was dizzy—about to go under the wave of my first kiss, when we both heard something. We froze. [MASK] and I lay down side by side and stared at the fights and wires overhead.
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Lindsey	[MASK] stepped from the flagstones onto the polished pine floors of what in our house was the living room. She made echoes up the open front hall, the sound of every movement reaching back for her. She couldn’t stop the memories slamming into her.
<name>Lyanna</name>	Lyanna	Lindsey	It always dissolved into giggles no matter how solemn the start. [MASK] would tell the dead knight that a wife had to move on, that she couldn’t be trapped for the rest of her life by a man who was frozen in time.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Susie	“I want you, [MASK],” he said. “Please,” I said. “Don’t,” I said. Sometimes I combined them. “Please don’t” or “Don’t please.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Franny	[MASK] took my left hand in both of hers and smiled. I wanted to kiss her lightly on the cheek or have her hold me, but instead I watched her walk off in front of me, saw her blue dress trail away.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ray	[MASK] asked. “Remember,” I said, “we’re exploring.” I led him around to the back of the shop and reached up over the doorjamb until I felt the hidden key. “How do you know about that?”
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Buckley	She made echoes up the open front hall, the sound of every movement reaching back for her. She couldn’t stop the memories slamming into her. Every one had a brutal report. [MASK] riding piggyback on my shoulders down the stairs.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Ray	It was cloudy and still. I tried to convince myself that it was an odd trick of light, a mass of dust motes trapped in the setting sun. But when [MASK] reached out to touch me, I didn’t feel anything.
<name>Matilda</name>	Matilda	Lindsey	[MASK] was not thought to be old enough. Besides, she was a burgeoning brain, which meant she got to be free to do things like spend that summer afternoon drawing detailed pictures of a fly’s eye on graph paper with her 130-pack of Prisma Colors.
<name>Alanna</name>	Alanna	Lindsey	She barely recognized her own child waiting at the end of the long ramp. In the years that had passed, [MASK] had become angular, thin, every trace of body fat gone. And standing beside my sister was what looked like her male twin.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Ruth	And, sometimes, they would talk about me. “It’s so strange,” [MASK] said. “I mean, it’s like we were in the same class since kindergarten but that day backstage in the auditorium was the first time we ever looked at each other.”
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Len	All week rain had been promised, the kind of thunder and lightning rainstorm the area excelled at, but so far the only moisture of which [MASK] was aware was that covering his body in a damp sweat. He had made his last easy visit to my parents’ house.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ray	I didn’t feel it. I pinched myself under the blanket. Nothing. The cloudy mass at the end of the bed began to take shape now. As [MASK] slipped out of the bed and stood, I saw men and women filling the room.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Buckley	We have fun. We do things that leave humans stumped and grateful, like [MASK]’s garden coming up one year, all of its crazy jumble of plants blooming all at once. I did that for my mother who, having stayed, found herself facing the yard again.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Len	A clear and easy piece of truth that everyone who had ever known me had accepted. But he needed to say it, and she needed to hear him say it. “It’s a charm off her bracelet,” [MASK] said.
<name>My father</name>	My father	Samuel	“My God, my God, my God,” my mother said as she took in the dirt and the cuts. My grandmother came to stand beside her. [MASK] put his hand on my sister’s head and smoothed her hair back. “Where have you been?”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Lindsey	I was the dead knight gone to heaven with my faithful dog and she was the live wire of a wife. “How can I be expected to be trapped for the rest of my life by a man frozen in time?” [MASK]’s favorite line.
