<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Cora	At their trepidation he said, “I’ll go first, if you wish.” The stairwell was lined with stones and a sour smell emanated from below. It did not open into a cellar but continued down. [MASK] appreciated the labor that had gone into its construction.
<name>John Wayne</name>	John Wayne	Ridgeway	He rode up on his horses with his associates, five men of disreputable mien, led by a fearsome Indian scout who wore a necklace of shriveled ears. [MASK] was six and a half feet tall, with the square face and thick neck of a hammer.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Bessie	Not even a caterpillar crawling in a nook. Inside, the white paint still smelled fresh in the common spaces, dining rooms, and bunk rooms. [MASK] wasn’t the only girl afraid to touch anything apart from the doorknobs. To even leave a speck or scratch mark.
<name>John</name>	John	Cora	It doesn’t make sense for them to mix with the larger population. In number 40, they can get the care they require.” “I didn’t know 40 was special,” [MASK] said. “It’s your Hob.” “I’m sorry?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Caesar	No need to ask after his fate. It appeared before her one night in the attic like a spark, a small and simple truth: [MASK] did not make it out. He was not up north wearing a new suit, new shoes, new smile.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Caesar	She was liberal with passes, allowing [MASK] and his family to range across the county as they pleased. It rankled her neighbors. In her degrees, she prepared them for the liberation that awaited them, for she had pledged to set them free upon her death.
<name>Casey</name>	Casey	Cora	The lanky boy bobbed his head. His youth and slight frame reminded [MASK] of the engineer of her last train trip, inducted by circumstance into the work of men. His freckled skin was lighter-hued, but they shared the same fragile eagerness.
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Cora	The boys and girls stood from the pews, turned over the paper where they’d copied the words, and sang the promises of the Founding Fathers. With [MASK], the class numbered twenty-five. The youngest—the six- and seven-year-olds—were exempt from the recital.
<name>Celie</name>	Celie	Ajarry	When [MASK] planted there, soon after her long march to the plantation, the plot was a rumble of dirt and scrub behind her cabin, at the end of the line of slave quarters. Beyond that lay fields and after that the swamp.
<name>she</name>	she	Ridgeway	She ran when the men stopped to relieve themselves at the side of the trail and made it a little farther that time. She ran once at dusk, by a stream, the water making a promise of movement. The slick stones sent her tumbling into the water, and [MASK] thrashed her.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Cora	[MASK] climbed up into the nook with fresh rations and a clean chamber pot. Her routine established itself quickly. It could not have been otherwise, given the constraints. After she knocked her head into the roof a dozen times, her body remembered the limits on her movement.
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Fletcher	What became of my companions in the boat, as well as those who escaped on the rock, or were left in the vessel, I cannot tell; but conclude they were all lost. The book will get him killed, [MASK] warned.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Cora	Why had she left her? Without a special kiss to say, When you remember this moment later you will understand that I was saying goodbye even if you did not know it. [MASK]’s last day in the field she furiously hacked into the earth as if digging a tunnel.
<name>Miss Maudie</name>	Miss Maudie	Cora	“That’s what the law says. White law. There are other ones.” He addressed [MASK] in a gentler tone. “If you want, miss, I can shoot him for you.” His face was calm.
<name>Frederick Douglass</name>	Frederick Douglass	Mingo	[MASK] opened with the story of his journey, the nights he spent begging the Lord for guidance, the long years it took to purchase his family’s freedom. “With my honest labor, one by one, just as you saved yourselves.”
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Cora	She survived the shock of her first elevator ride and stepped into a long corridor lined with chairs, all of which were full of colored men and women awaiting examinations. After a nurse in a stark white uniform checked her name off a list, [MASK] joined the group of women.
<name>Altitude</name>	Altitude	Hunger	She washed the soot and grime from her arms and face. “From the mountains,” she said, after an article in one of the dusty almanacs. “Snowmelt.” [MASK] made her head light. The sun told her which way was north.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Cora	[MASK] missed the white stores and their abundant shelves, but she still had her evening walks home, and her game with the changing window displays. On the other hand, ignoring the museum visitors was a prodigious undertaking.
<name>she</name>	she	Cora	Now her suggestions and advice resembled maneuvers, the way a farmer tricks a donkey into moving in line with his intentions. The white woman was gathering a stack of her blue papers when [MASK] poked her head into the office. Was her name written down there, and what were the notes beside it?
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Cora	[MASK]’s head almost brushed the ceiling of the small, hot room. Between the sloping walls of the peaked roof, the attic was crammed with years of castoffs. Two broken washboards, piles of moth-eaten quilts, chairs with split seats.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Cora	Two steel rails ran the visible length of the tunnel, pinned into the dirt by wooden crossties. The steel ran south and north presumably, springing from some inconceivable source and shooting toward a miraculous terminus. Someone had been thoughtful enough to arrange a small bench on the platform. [MASK] felt dizzy and sat down.
<name>She</name>	She	Cora	He ran off three years after she busted up the doghouse, hiding in the swamp for weeks. It was his mutt’s barking that gave away his location to the patrollers. [MASK] would have said it served him right, had his punishment not made her shiver to think about.
<name>he</name>	he	Carpenter	An actor taught his nieces and nephews to cry on demand, the craft of bereavement. Then they made the rounds of the morgue, claiming bodies as long-lost relatives—although [MASK] was not above simply stealing bodies from the coroner when he had to.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Caesar	[MASK] had accompanied some of the trappers on their fishing and hunting expeditions for months now, learning how to step in the peat and silt, where to stick close to the reeds, and how to find the islands of sure ground. He probed the murk before them with his walking stick.
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Caesar	The doctors were stealing her babies from her, not her former masters. “They wanted to know what part of Africa my parents hailed from,” [MASK] said. “How was I to know? He said I had the nose of a Beninese.”
<name>Phillis</name>	Phillis	MARTHA	a negro girl named [MASK], belonging to the Subscriber. Said girl is of a dark brown complexion, slightly made, and very free spoken, about 21 years of age; she wore a black silk bonnet with feathers; and had in her possession two calico bed quiltings.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Cora	He cried and shouted. [MASK] broke from her rescuers once they got her outside and down the steps. The farm was a commotion. The white posse dragged men and women into the dark, their hideous faces awash with delight.
<name>Miles</name>	Miles	Valentine	“Talk is good,” [MASK] said. “Talk clears the air and makes it so you can see what’s what. We’ll see what the mood of the farm is. It’s mine, but it’s everybody’s, too. Yours.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Cora	Then a bed covered in white sheets that shone in the sun, her children rolling on it with her, the husband’s body half visible at the edges. In another scene, years hence, [MASK] walked down a busy street in her city and came across her mother.
<name>Olivia</name>	Olivia	Cora	No mean feat in a village teeming with treacherous natures and informers who would sell out their dearest to escape the bite of the cat-o’-nine-tails. [MASK] fell asleep nestled against her mother’s stomach and never saw her again.
<name>He</name>	He	Cora	“I’m going back north,” he said. “Soon. Running away. I want you to come.” [MASK] tried to think of who put him up to this prank. “You going north and I’m going to eat,” she said.
<name>the protagonist</name>	the protagonist	Cora	The museum needs a special kind of girl,” she said, “and not many of the residents have adapted as well as you have. You should take it as a compliment.” [MASK] was reassured but lingered in the doorway.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Royal	An old station master offered that it had been the home of a major general in the Revolutionary War, a man who had witnessed much bloodshed and had withdrawn from the young nation after helping to bring it into existence. A recluse story contained more sense, but [MASK] thought the army part was claptrap.
<name>Christine</name>	Christine	Cora	Hazarding a guess as to the number of lashes, he was off by two. He examined her privates with his tools. The exam was painful and made her ashamed, the doctor’s cold attitude doing nothing to ease her discomfort. [MASK] answered his questions about the assault.
<name>Jews</name>	Jews	Cora	But in concert with its fellows, a mighty iron that subjugated millions despite its weakness. The people she chose, young and old, from the rich part of town or the more modest streets, did not individually persecute [MASK]. As a community, they were shackles.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Cora	The colored entrance was around the side but apart from that was identical to the white entrance, in the original design and not an afterthought, as was so often the case. The colored wing was having a busy morning when [MASK] gave her name to the receptionist.
<name>Aunt Alexandra</name>	Aunt Alexandra	Ethel	She closed the book, one thin finger holding her place. “We are all in need of our Sav- ior’s grace,” [MASK] said. “It wouldn’t be very Christian of me to let a heathen into my house, and not share His word.”
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Lumbly	“How far does the tunnel extend?” [MASK] shrugged. “Far enough for you.” “It must have taken years.” “More than you know. Solving the problem of ventilation, that took a bit of time.” “Who built it?”
<name>Abilene</name>	Abilene	Cora	Of course she hadn’t. A woman who leaves her daughter behind becomes someone else to hide the shame of it. But [MASK] asked everyone on the farm sooner or later, the farm being its own kind of depot, attracting people who were between places.
<name>she</name>	she	Cora	“We’re about halfway there. Needed to stretch my legs.” He slapped the side of the boiler. “This old girl, she bucks.” It wasn’t until they were moving again that [MASK] realized she forgot to ask where they were headed.
<name>Old Dan</name>	Old Dan	Blake	She had not been under its spell in years, since she brought the hatchet down on [MASK]’s doghouse and sent the splinters into the air. She had seen men hung from trees and left for buzzards and crows. Women carved open to the bones with the cat-o’-nine-tails.
<name>Louise</name>	Louise	Cora	[MASK]’s grandmother saw a little boy among the gawkers eating rock candy and wondered what he was putting in his mouth. Just before sunset an agent bought her for two hundred and twenty-six dollars. She would have fetched more but for that season’s glut of young girls.
<name>the city</name>	the city	Hob	By playing up their strangeness, the way a slave simpered and acted childlike to escape a beating, they evaded the entanglements of the quarter. The walls of [MASK] made a fortress some nights, rescuing them from the feuds and conspiracies.
<name>Columbus</name>	Columbus	Royal	The conductor also avoided the very real matter of the white settlers’ mounting resentment of the negro outpost. The divisions would make themselves known by and by. As they hurtled through the underground passage, a tiny ship on this impossible sea, [MASK]’s endorsement achieved its purpose.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Fletcher	Their six-hour head start had been a fantasy. The patrollers had been deep in the hunt the whole time. By midmorning, [MASK] said, every spare hand in the county and from all around enlisted in the search.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Cora	“We got away.” [MASK] shuddered and he whispered, “I know you were worried. I didn’t feel like mixing with folks tonight, reckoned I’d wait here.” On the porch, they sat on the lovelorn carpenters’ chairs and took in the night.
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Terrance	One minute with [MASK] and the cause of the terrible atmosphere was evident. The son was mean, and it was the kind of meanness that infected everything around. The daylight was gray and sluggish from the thunderheads, the house niggers slow and glum.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Cora	[MASK] had been with them for a few weeks. Slept the night through once or twice, put back some of the weight she’d lost in the attic. The dry flies cut out their noise, leaving an opening in the night for a question.
<name>she</name>	she	Cora	She wondered where the person was now. That first day, [MASK] acquainted herself with the life of the park, the patch of green she’d seen across the street from the house. She pressed her eye to the spy hole, shifting around to capture the entire view.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Cora	Both he and [MASK] decided his skittish personality had not helped them during the close call the previous night, when in another bad omen the regulators knocked on the front door. IT had been just after dark and the park was full of those afraid to go home.
<name>Abby</name>	Abby	Cora	He spent most of his time in the farmhouse, squaring the farm’s accounts. He wandered to the shelves of maps. Now that they were in the same room, [MASK] was compelled to rectify her months of silence. She asked after the preparations for the gathering.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Terrance	“Don’t meddle.” “I knew you let your slaves have revels, but I had no idea they were so extravagant. Are you trying to make me look bad?” “Don’t pretend you care what a nigger thinks of you, [MASK].”
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Ridgeway	His companions returned empty-handed. [MASK] smiled as the men shackled his wrists through the wagon wheel. “The boy is a devious sort,” the leader said. “I can tell that. We have to go.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Lovey	The next time they stopped, he told them that he had to go find the county road. He promised to return soon, but he needed to take measure of their progress. [MASK] had the sense not to ask what happened if he didn’t return.
<name>Curley's wife</name>	Curley's wife	Mabel	[MASK] didn’t fight him after that. He was quick and he wasn’t rough after that first time. Women and animals, you only have to break them in once, he said. They stay broke. All those faces, living and dead.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Cora	The last of her tribe. The light of the train shuddered around the bend. [MASK] reached for her hair before realizing that after her interment there was no improving her appearance. The engineer would not judge her; their secret enterprise was a fraternity of odd souls.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Martin	[MASK]’s father had needed the almanacs to plan for the full moon—the books held prayers for runaways. The moon grew fat and thin, there were solstices, first frosts, and spring rains. All these things proceeded without the interference of men.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Cora	In the months that [MASK] had worked for the family, the mother’s bad days had markedly reduced in number. The tantrums, the afternoons she spent locked in her room with the drapes shut, her severe manner with the children occurred less frequently.
<name>he</name>	he	Sam	She had cleaned all the dishware when [MASK] returned home. “It’s bad,” the station agent said. “One of the bounty hunters came in right after we spoke. Had a ring of ears around his neck like a red Indian, a real tough character.
<name>John</name>	John	Royal	He told her not to be afraid, the tunnel would save her again. “Go to the house in the woods. You can tell me where it goes.” His body went slack. Two men grabbed her and removed her from [MASK]’s body.
<name>Rosita</name>	Rosita	Boseman	What’s left when everything worthwhile has been consumed, dark powder for the wind to take. [MASK] slid her chains through the ring in the floor and secured them. Ten rings were bolted to the wagon floor, two rows of five, enough for the occasional big haul.
<name>Faulkner</name>	Faulkner	Ridgeway	[MASK] knew that image to be false—he didn’t need to dissemble about the business of slavery—but neither was the menace of the Randall plantation the truth. The place was haunted. Who could blame the slaves their sad comportment with that corpse twisting on a hook outside?
<name>her mother</name>	her mother	Sybil	Fleas had found the batting, she insisted. The seams puckered, her corners unjoined. The quilt betrayed a crookedness in her thinking: run it up a pole as the flag of her wild country. She wanted to set it aside but [MASK] forbid her.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Cora	It had happened thirty miles downstate, and the victims supposedly worked for the railroad, but nothing specific on top of that. A freckled woman unfamiliar to [MASK]—so many strangers these days—carried on about the lynchings in a loud voice.
<name>the driver</name>	the driver	Fletcher	“I was expecting three passengers today,” he said. “You’ll be able to stretch out.” Before they could figure his words, [MASK] informed them it was time for him to return to his wife: “My part is finished, my friends.”
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Caesar	A beautiful soul like [MASK] could be anything he wanted here, all of them could be: own a spread, be a schoolteacher, fight for colored rights. Even be a poet. In her Georgia misery she had pictured freedom, and it had not looked like this.
<name>John</name>	John	Patrollers	[MASK] must have smoked it out, I figure.” He clambered into his cabin after his pisspot, then went to the edge of the tunnel and emptied it. “The bosses hadn’t heard from the sta- tion agent, so I was running express.
<name>Booker</name>	Booker	Mingo	And not just one or two, but dozens more? By proving the negro’s thrift and intelligence, [MASK] argued, he will enter into American society as a productive member with full rights. Why jeopardize that? We need to slow things down.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Cora	The mutt dozed in the shade of the benches and the gigantic oak that dominated the green with majestic ease. It was well-fed, [MASK] observed, gobbling down the treats and bones offered by the citizens. Her stomach never failed to rumble at the sight.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Jockey	The white men were silent. As if they’d given up or decided that a small freedom was the worst pun- ishment of all, presenting the bounty of true freedom into painful relief. One day [MASK] was bound to choose the correct day of his birth.
<name>John Hopkins</name>	John Hopkins	Proctor	A malpractice suit called you before the judge for want of a skill, but get caught with an ill-gotten cadaver and the judge punished you for trying to obtain that skill. [MASK] made its students pay for their own pathological specimens.
<name>She</name>	She	Cora	“They’re only there for a short time,” the white woman added. “We’re optimistic.” [MASK] didn’t know what optimistic meant. She asked the other girls that night if they were familiar with the word. None of them had heard it before.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Cora	“Come up and take something for yourself,” he said. [MASK] clambered to the driver’s box. He opened the basket. She tore off some bread and gobbled it down. “There’s plenty,” he said.
<name>One of her children</name>	One of her children	Maisie	Her work raising funds for the new hospital assisted in this regard, in addition to her afternoon lunches with the other ladies of the neighborhood. She was in good spirits, rounding up her children for kisses and hugs and promising a treat after dinner. [MASK] hopped and squealed.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Cora	To be sure, [MASK] was not a natural believer, and her education had been terminated sooner than she wished. In the attic she had struggled with the words, pressed on, doubled back to difficult verses. The contradictions vexed her, even half-understood ones.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Cora	Spending more time outside the house, and the pills, had worked wonders. When [MASK] finished her Saturday washing and had supper, it was almost time for the social. She put on her new blue dress. It was the prettiest one at the colored emporium.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Homer	They struggled and his big arms encircled her, her feet kicking against the air like those of one hanging from a tree. [MASK] was at his side—he was the boy she’d seen in the pews, winking at her.
<name>Ma Joad</name>	Ma Joad	Cora	He wore suspenders and a white blouse, looking like the innocent child he would have been in a different world. At the sight of him, [MASK] added her voice to the chorus of lamentation that echoed across the farm.
<name>Cassie</name>	Cassie	Cora	[MASK] shook her head again and rubbed her arms from the chill. The third wagon was commanded by an older negro man. He was thickset and grizzled, dressed in a heavy rancher’s coat that had seen its share of labor. His eyes were kind, she decided.
<name>Nat Turner</name>	Nat Turner	Terrance	The stocks smoked, charred, and burned, the figures in the wood twisting in the flames as if alive. [MASK] addressed the slaves of the northern and southern halves. There is one plantation now, united in purpose and method, he said.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Indiana	[MASK] LEFT my house on Friday evening the 26th about 10 o’clock P.M. (without provocation whatever) my negro girl SUKE Y. She is about 28 years of age, of rather a light complexion, has high cheek bones, is slender in her person, and very neat in her appearance.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Michael	Merely glancing at the size of the skulls told you that a nigger possessed a bigger brain than a bird. [MASK] had been the son of his master’s coachman. Had a brand of animal cleverness, the kind you see in pigs sometimes.
<name>Phoenix</name>	Phoenix	Jockey	[MASK] awoke on a surprise Sunday to announce his celebration and that was that. Sometimes it was in the midst of the spring rains, other times after harvest. He skipped some years or forgot or decided according to some personal accounting of grievance that the plantation was undeserving.
<name>Frederick</name>	Frederick	Terrance	They discussed the numbers from last year’s haul and examined the ledgers that contained the weigh-ins from the previous September. [MASK] expressed annoyance at the overseer’s lamentable handwriting but apart from that the men got along amiably. They did not inspect the slaves or the village.
<name>her</name>	her	Frances	The rotting schoolhouse smelled rank. Small animals made regular habitation. The chairs and tables had been removed a long time before, making room for dead leaves and spiderwebs. She wondered if he had brought [MASK] here when they were together, and what they did.
<name>she</name>	she	Cora	Then she started for the cabin. “You can’t go up here!” the boy said. “It’s regulations.” “You can’t expect me to ride on that,” [MASK] said. “All passengers ride coach on this train, miss.
<name>Odysseus</name>	Odysseus	Ridgeway	That, and the fact they both had eyes in their head, meant they had two things in common. [MASK] paused—a drunk wanted to use the privy. He shooed him away. “You absconded for ten months,” he said. “Insult enough.
<name>Simon</name>	Simon	Terrance	When [MASK] appeared on his brother’s plantation, he usually appraised each slave and made a note of which men were the most able and which women the most appealing. Content to leer at his brother’s women, he grazed heartily upon the women of his own half.
<name>La Paloma</name>	La Paloma	Randall	It was a perfect trap, he said, for everyone. “You won’t make it. They’ll catch you. Then you’ll tell them who we are.” “On [MASK], when they want you in irons, they put you in irons.”
<name>Red</name>	Red	Ridgeway	From the saloon next door, a piano started up. It sounded as if a raccoon ran back and forth, mashing on the keys. “All this time you haven’t asked about your accomplice,” [MASK] said.
<name>The confidante</name>	The confidante	Sam	There was a bill of sale in a file in a box somewhere, from what he understood, but that was it. Nothing that would be held over them. A confidante in the Griffin Building had forged these papers for them. “Are you ready?” [MASK] asked.
<name>He</name>	He	Ridgeway	“You got to work that spirit, boy.” One day he would find his spirit, his father told him. It was encouragement. [MASK] hoisted it as a lonesome burden. There was no model for the type of man he wanted to become.
<name>He</name>	He	Ridgeway	He gestured for her to walk in front. The steps to the back alley were slippery with vomit and he grabbed her elbow to steady her. Closing the outhouse door, shutting him out, was the purest pleasure she’d had in a long while. [MASK] continued his address undeterred.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Martin	The gazettes printed reports of raided depots and station agents brought to raw justice, but those were common slave-state fables. Previously, strangers knocked on [MASK]’s door with messages concerning routes, and once, news of a confirmed passenger. Never the same person twice.
<name>Teddy</name>	Teddy	Cora	A sturdy-built man in white trousers and a bright red coat took command of the stage. Despite his size, he moved with force and authority— [MASK] recalled the mounted bear in the museum, posed at the dramatic moment of his charge.
<name>Rachel</name>	Rachel	Cora	Did [MASK] notice that there was no sign that someone had lived there, not even an old toothpick or a nail in the wall? A notion crept over her like a shadow: that this station was not the start of the line but its terminus.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Caesar	He should have been living with his mother and father in their cottage, rounding off barrels for the cooper or apprenticed to another of the town’s craftsmen. His prospects were limited by his race, to be sure, but [MASK] had grown up believing he was free to choose his own fate.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Fletcher	I’ve been serving two of his men whiskey.” He handed her a flier. It was one of the bulletins [MASK] had described in his cottage, with one change. Now that she knew her letters, the word murder hooked her heart.
<name>Malcolm X</name>	Malcolm X	Sam	The tonics the hospital administered, however, were merely sugar water. In fact, the niggers were participants in a study of the latent and tertiary stages of syphilis. “They think you’re helping them?” [MASK] asked the doctor.
<name>Moses</name>	Moses	Homer	At last. Once I get a look-see at the famous underground railroad.” He slapped her again. On the next circuit she found the cottonwoods that marked the turn. [MASK] lit a lantern and they entered the mournful old house.
