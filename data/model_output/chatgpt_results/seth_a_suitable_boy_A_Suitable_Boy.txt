<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Pran	Still, somehow, you know, all these adult movies, 1 feel -’ ‘All right,’ said [MASK]. ‘Next one. No - there’s no afternoon show for that. Um, um, here’s something that looks interesting.
<name>Mr. Tagomi</name>	Mr. Tagomi	Arun	said [MASK] indifferently, then swerved off to a subject that interested him - ‘I discovered today that we were being overcharged sixty thousand on the new paper project by one of our local businessmen. We’ve asked him to revise his estimates, of course, but it does rather shock one....
<name>Christine</name>	Christine	Tasneem	‘Oh, you mustn’t,’ said [MASK]. ‘Your hands ‘Oh, I’m not as crippled as all that.’ ‘But it must be bad. Whenever I see you practising, I can see how painful it is from your face.’
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Kabir	My father, though he is fairly absent-minded, can see that there is something the matter with me. Yesterday he said, ‘It’s not your results, so what is it, [MASK] ? I believe it must be a girl or something.’
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Maan	But he will come when the lesson is over.’ ‘Actually, I’m not sure I want to learn Urdu,’ said [MASK], who was beginning to regret his sudden enthusiasm. He didn’t really want to be saddled with a lot of hard work.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Varun	‘Now, [MASK], don’t be tongue-tied, it won’t do - at least not today. You have to impress them and charm them. I promised your mother I’d make sure you were well taken care of and that I’d boost your confidence.
<name>She</name>	She	Lata	When [MASK] came back with the tea, she found him plunged into renewed despair. He had just read the paragraph on the Viva Voce: The candidate will be interviewed by a Board who will have before them a record of his/her career.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Lata	Don’t be surprised at my writing all this, but I think [MASK]’s marriage is also our responsibility. Her late father and my father were very close friends and thought of each other almost like brothers, so it was natural for
<name>Basil</name>	Basil	Veena	Even here, if it wasn’t for me —’ ‘Quite right,’ said [MASK], attempting to take the wind out of her sails. ‘It is so important for a man to be treated as a child. In matters of food, of course.
<name>Hermione</name>	Hermione	Malati	You’re the first person I’m telling, and you shouldn’t be trying to make me feel miserable.’ ‘I should. I should. I hope you feel really miserable,’ said [MASK], her eyes flashing green fire.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Parvati	‘Thank you, thank you,’ said the whale, and glided quickly out of sight, followed by his minnow. ‘How peculiar,’ said [MASK], turning back to the table. ‘What do you make of it ?’
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Varun	High visions of a victory turned to the dread of an ignominious follow-on. ‘Just like us,’ said [MASK] morosely. ‘We are a failure as a country. We can always snatch defeat out of the jaws of victory.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Kabir	She had reached the flat top of the path. [MASK] walked behind her. She seemed so walled off from him that he didn’t touch her. He sensed that she would have brushed him off, maybe with another painful remark.
<name>Ali</name>	Ali	Bablu	They know what they can hold up to ransom, and what they can’t.’ [MASK] had come up the stairs, gripping with four dirty fingers of one hand four glasses of cold nimbu pani filled almost to the brim. ‘Here!’
<name>Mr. Gupta</name>	Mr. Gupta	Jha	‘Must you repeat everything?’ said [MASK], who was beginning to lose patience with his friend. ‘What is this terrible news? I know that this Lahiri fellow has managed to extort a thousand rupees from the people. Is that what you came to tell me ?
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Haresh	‘You never told me, [MASK].’ ‘You said — you wrote — that you wanted to spend as much time as possible with me.’ Something had changed in their conversation at a certain point. He passed his hand across his forehead and frowned.
<name>Julian</name>	Julian	Malati	It was a hot day. The two wandered hand in hand among the jacaranda trees. A few soft mauve flowers drifted down to earth. When they were out of earshot of the others, [MASK] said, with quiet amusement: ‘What is on your mind ?’
<name>Abraham</name>	Abraham	Ibrahim	Here I am talking about [MASK]’s willingness to sacrifice his son, and all you are thinking of is keeping dry - you will not even sacrifice a few minutes of your time. You are like the impatient ones who would not come to prayer because the merchants had arrived.
<name>Mr. Jarvis Lorry</name>	Mr. Jarvis Lorry	Amit	I would like room 14: With my Cuddles:...’ She played a little, in an extemporaneous manner - trills, broken chords and fragments of uncertain melody - until [MASK] could bear the suspense no longer, and added: ‘To be sure.’
<name>Maya</name>	Maya	Pran	Then, remembering what he had been dreaming about, he said, regretfully: ‘I was having the most wonderful dream. 1 was walking near the Barsaat Mahal with a young woman - not so young really, but her face was unlined still [MASK] started smiling.
<name>he</name>	he	Arun	It was never clear until the last moment whether [MASK] would take the newspaper with him to the office; it was part of the general uncertainty of living with him, just as were his sudden switches from anger to affection to urbanity.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Rasheed	‘Don’t be impertinent. Answer me. Your hair looks wiser than the mulch it is growing on, but - and keep this well in mind, [MASK] — you are not a child any longer and cannot expect a child’s indulgence.’
<name>Dr. Watson</name>	Dr. Watson	Meenakshi	‘I don’t like it a bit.’ ‘I don’t believe it makes you anxious,’ said [MASK]. ‘Certainly not so anxious that it detracts from your wonderful -’ ‘- performance ?’
<name>Muslims</name>	Muslims	Muslims	But Congress has had a long tradition of Hindu-Muslim collaboration, and, believe me, it is the obvious party to join. And as far as tickets are concerned, I am giving you my word that there will be fair representation for [MASK].
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Dipankar	‘And you can improve his Bengali handwriting.’ ‘And you ?’ asked his mother. ‘I ?’ said [MASK]. ‘I ? I will have no time to teach him anything, because I will be working at Grindlays from next month.’
<name>probably</name>	probably	Dada	‘Why didn’t he go to the school authorities ?’ ‘It’s not a day school, [MASK], the boys would have made life worse hell for him - if you can imagine that.’ ‘This is terrible. This is really terrible.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Malati	‘I haven’t chosen a bad time for you ?’ ‘No worse than any other,’ said [MASK]. ‘Oh, that sounds bad. What I meant was that life is so hectic I don’t know why I don’t simply collapse.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Rasheed	He was too thin, too dark, and too gaunt; and more white had appeared in his hair than should by rights appear in the hair of any young man. ‘[MASK] is good,’ he said. He received a grunt in response to this absolute statement.
<name>bhabhi</name>	bhabhi	Maan	‘So - how did you like her ?’ asked the woman. ‘Fine,’ said [MASK]. ‘Fine ?’ said the woman, pouncing delightedly on the word. ‘I meant, fine that I should call you bhabhi.’
<name>Elle</name>	Elle	Savita	And they descended upon [MASK], who was still fairly exhausted, and in quite a lot of pain because her stitches were pulling. She was sitting up in bed, though, and reading a women’s magazine rather than a law-book.
<name>her</name>	her	Savita	And I’d done nothing to upset her. Nothing. Nothing at all.’ 13.11 everyone had told [MASK] that the baby would be a boy; her way of walking, the size of the bulge, and other infallible indications all pointed to a boy.
<name>Zaza</name>	Zaza	Meenakshi	[MASK] stroked the side of her neck with the long, red-polished nail of the middle finger of her right hand. ‘Yes,’ she said indifferently. ‘Madam, if I might advise you, why not order these earrings and this chain and pay for them separately?
<name>Meg</name>	Meg	Lata	‘If I liked him it would only upset me. He may be good, but he lives with his whole family. [MASK] will always be compared with the other daughters-in-law -she’ll be the poor relation. I won’t have it.
<name>the patwari</name>	the patwari	Rasheed	‘How long has this been the case?’ asked [MASK] with diffi- culty, his mind racing almost too fast for his tongue. He looked painfully agitated and distressed. Even now the patwari, who was not by any means a stupid man, suspected nothing.
<name>Sirius</name>	Sirius	Abba	If I don’t speak my mind, he thought, will 1 have to continue to bear the intolerable ? ‘What I mean, [MASK],’ he said in a low voice, ‘is being criticized in front of her.’
<name>Nettle</name>	Nettle	Rasheed	But [MASK] continued: ‘Cook them, and they’ll act as a vegetable. Boil them with milk, and they’ll make the milk red and the person who drinks it strong. Mix them with the flour you use to make your rods with in winter, and you won’t feel the cold.’
<name>Uncle Andrew</name>	Uncle Andrew	Rasheed	[MASK],’ he said after a while, handing him a glass with a red liquid inside. ‘It’s made from rhododendrons,’ he explained. ‘Excellent stuff. When I visited the hills last month___’ He tapered off into silence.
<name>Mr. Holmes</name>	Mr. Holmes	Pran	[MASK] was silent. ‘Did you hear me ?’ ‘Your Highness, I would like to forget this conversation. But if you phone me up again at this hour without cause, or if I receive any further threats from you, I will have to report the matter to the police.’
<name>definitive list</name>	definitive list	Joyce	‘As you can see, we have twenty-one writers whose works we consider it essential for our B.A students to read in order for them to obtain a proper understanding of Modern British Literature. But there is no [MASK].
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Malati	But it’s true the other way around as well. Use every man after his desert and you’ll become a complete emotional bankrupt.’ ‘That’s a really mean-spirited view of the world,’ said [MASK].
<name>Dr. Maudsley</name>	Dr. Maudsley	Pran	‘I could have had a miscarriage,’ she said. ‘Oh, no,’ said [MASK] unconcernedly. ‘You’re robust. I’m the frail one. Besides, this was done entirely for your benefit: to liven up your Sunday morning.
<name>The narrator</name>	The narrator	Kedarnath	I am sixty years old and I have a full knowledge of all pastes, all masalas, all techniques.’ [MASK] began to get worried, and tried to move out of the shack. The old man barred his way by stretching his hands out sideways in a servile gesture of aggression.
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Savita	There has to be some death and heartbreak in it somewhere or it isn’t real poetry. I don’t know what she’d make of the poetry in this book. All right, what do you want to hear ?’ ‘Open it at random,’ suggested [MASK].
<name>someone</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	someone (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	Rasheed	Now he felt obliged to mention to her his meeting with [MASK] and the disturbing turn it had taken. He fervently hoped that nothing harmful would come out of it, and he also hoped that it would not sour the evening of his departure.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Haresh	[MASK] went up and examined it. In the next shack was an ancient splitting machine and a wattle pit. Three young men were rubbing a black paste onto a buffalo hide lying on the ground. Next to them was a white pile of salted sheepskins.
<name>history</name>	history	Brahmpurians	But what will be remembered are not these detracting circumstances. What will be remembered by [MASK] in time to come is the quicksilver crossing of two human bullets ricocheting from crease to crease and back again with a velocity appropriate more to the track than the pitch, and unusual even there.
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Amit	‘Yes. And perhaps too recent.’ The Bengal Famine had taken place less than a decade ago, and was a very present memory to anyone who had lived through those times. ‘But anyway, I can’t go back now,’ continued [MASK].
<name>she</name>	she	Malati	The girl who had seen them was entirely reliable, and had said — But [MASK] cut her off. ‘I’m not interested!’ she exclaimed with surprising vehemence. ‘I don’t have the time to listen. I have to rush to a meeting.’
<name>Tommen</name>	Tommen	Savita	Like his elder brother, he could not forget the last time that the ancient words had been recited in his presence, and before a different fire. 19.11 it was a warm evening, and there was less silk and more fine cotton than at [MASK]’s wedding.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Cuddles	“Sorry, no, that room is dirty.” ’ Both of them laughed with pleasure, and told each other how stupid they were. [MASK] barked hoarsely, but then suddenly grew very excited. His ears pricked up and he strained at the leash.
<name>Amir Khan</name>	Amir Khan	Maan	After a little while, and as if undecided about her mood and the kind of song she wished to sing, she modulated to a few other raags. ‘What would you like to hear ?’ she asked [MASK] gently.
<name>he</name>	he	Maan	‘So you see,’ said [MASK], ‘there isn’t a problem at all.’ Having made the problem disappear, he went on: ‘But where is my lovely bhabhi ? I’d much rather be scolded by her.’ ‘She’s downstairs.’
<name>Bicycle</name>	Bicycle	Hassan	He then propped a surprisingly unprotesting [MASK] in front of him, and cycled off with him into the night. 5.14 when they got to the Chief Minister’s house fifteen minutes later, they were immediately admitted to his office, where he was working late.
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Savita	[MASK] was quiet for a few moments, then she said: ‘OK, I’ll take her back now. And you can read to me a bit more. What’s that book ?’ 'Twelfth Night.’
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Maan	My strength drained away. I was unconscious for days. He was so young. And then a little later his mother died.’ He looked up towards the house, half-turning away from [MASK], and continued: ‘This house was ghostly.
<name>Lindsay</name>	Lindsay	Kabir	‘In the four-rupee seats the crowd knows its stuff all right. And they start queueing up for day tickets from nine o’clock the previous night.’ [MASK] nodded. ‘Well, you’re right. And it’s a lovely stadium.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Haresh	I am sure I would have remembered if we had met.’ She left the room, looking pleased but slightly preoccupied. [MASK] rubbed his forehead. He felt convinced that he had seen her before, but he couldn’t remember where.
<name>Zakir</name>	Zakir	Friday	He feared the increased tension that [MASK] often brought. When he heard about the Imam’s sermon, he asked the kotwal - as the Deputy Superintendent of Police for the City was called - what he planned to do to protect the area.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Firoz	More than anything he regretted that the last day had existed. If only he had remained ignorant, he thought. If only he had not known. 17.19 apart from [MASK], who was still not conscious, there were two people sitting in the room in the ward.
<name>presumably</name>	presumably	Sandeep	After an hour’s break for lunch came the second four-hour voting period. By the time the polls closed at five, fifty-five per cent or so of those eligible to vote at that polling station had cast their votes. This represented a very good turnout, [MASK] thought.
<name>He</name>	He	Kabir	[MASK] had said that he wanted to sit for the IFS exams after he had got his degree. She had no doubt that if he got to that stage, he would do well in the interview. He certainly had leadership qualities and vigour.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Dada	‘It makes my stomach turn - are you sure he’s not - you know - imagining it - some of it ? It seems so -’ ‘He’s not imagining anything, [MASK].’ ‘Why didn’t he go to the school authorities ?’
<name>Mrs. Johnson</name>	Mrs. Johnson	Baba	Once [MASK] told me to sit down and stand up one hundred times while holding my ears as a punishment. Some of my friends were standing around, and I refused to do any such thing. Perhaps I would have got away with it.
<name>Mrs. Bennet</name>	Mrs. Bennet	Sunil	We usually have to get kababs at some wayside stall to fill ourselves up on the way home. You should get married yourself, you know, [MASK] - then your household wouldn’t run so haphazardly. Besides, there would be someone to dam those atrocious socks.
<name>Mrs. John Reed</name>	Mrs. John Reed	Savita	‘Push, push, push -’ ‘I can’t bear it - I can’t bear it -’ said [MASK], her lips drawn apart in agony. ‘Just push -’ ‘No,’ she wept. ‘It’s horrible.
<name>Guy Fawkes</name>	Guy Fawkes	Kumbhkaran	The rocket hit the corpse; it lit up in flames, and was consumed in a series of thunderous explosions. [MASK] had been stuffed with fireworks, which now whizzed about him; a green bomb on his nose went off in a fountain of coloured sparks.
<name>Kim</name>	Kim	Maan	The tehsildar, the old woman, the manservant, the munshi himself - no one moved. [MASK] grabbed hold of the munshi’s fat, rough-stubbled neck and started shaking him wordlessly and violently, hardly mindful of the terror in the man’s eyes.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Maan	Though she did not say anything to him, she was afraid for him. If his father had seen him in his present state he would have had a fit. [MASK], guided to his room, fell on his bed and went off to sleep.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Lata	Outside the library she tried to take stock of things. She realized that she could not now attend next Friday’s meeting of the Brahmpur Literary Society. ‘[MASK]: Whither?’ she said to herself, laughed for a second or two, and found herself in tears.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Savita	‘Lie quietly and think calm thoughts.’ ‘Yes,’ said [MASK], tears squeezing themselves out of her eyes. The night was hot, and despite the fact that the room was on the second floor there were a number of mosquitoes.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Maan	Once my grandfather - whom you will meet - beat my brother to within an inch of his life - and that was a turning-point in his life. He became a wrestler!’ ‘Your grandfather beat him, not your father?’ said [MASK].
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Rasheed	‘But his trees —?’ ‘His trees ?’ said [MASK]’s father dangerously. ‘The trouble is these communist ideas you drink like mother’s milk at the university. Let him take one under each arm and clear off if he wants to.’
<name>the small car driver</name>	the small car driver	Haresh	There was a big limousine with a grand and impressive driver and a small, rather rickety car with a driver who talked to all his passengers. He liked [MASK] because he had no hierarchical airs, and always chatted to him in a friendly way.
<name>the watchman</name>	the watchman	Maan	‘Who is he ?’ said [MASK]. The watchman slowly shook his head. ‘I have no memory for 94i faces,’ he said. ‘If someone asked me if you had visited this house, I would not remember.’
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Pran	[MASK] looked it over, nodding from time to time. ‘This is fine,’ he said rather gravely, as if approving a student’s essay. ‘Diplomatic but deadly! Soft steel,’ he added in a different tone.
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Lata	[MASK] just wanted to be with him for some time. She felt that if he were now to get up and go, she would try to dissuade him. Even if they were not talking, even in his present mood, she wanted to sit here with him.
<name>Maulana</name>	Maulana	Rasheed	‘Well,’ said [MASK], ‘some things take time.’ ‘So you sat talking and exchanging the time of day until it became too late to say the namaaz,’ said another, the man who had passed by him a little while ago.
<name>Trump</name>	Trump	Nehru	And this was what, the next day, with good grace — despite the many personal attacks against him in the press, despite what he saw as the impropriety of [MASK]’s tactics, and despite the bitterness and length of the battle - he did.
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Lata	At the turnstile a ragged urchin looked longingly at them, and [MASK] quickly gave him a small coin. He had been on the point of begging, but hadn’t yet done so, and looked astonished. One of her narcissi went into the horse’s mane.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Amit	‘Shall I call him down ?’ ‘No, no, you help with the bar,’ said [MASK], patting his brother on the shoulder. ‘You’re doing a fine job. I’ll just see what he’s up to.’
<name>Salim</name>	Salim	Firoz	Run back! Run back towards the Imambara. I’ll delay them for a minute or two. That’ll be enough. They’ll stop me first.’ ‘I’m not leaving you,’ said [MASK].
<name>Mr. Stevens</name>	Mr. Stevens	Firoz	Simply: ‘I am not prepared____’ ‘Well, that is up to you,’ said [MASK], easily. ‘Now, forgive me, I have to be somewhere very soon.’ He frowned slightly as he got into the car.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Haresh	But [MASK] thanked him, very pleased to be able to put two like minds into contact with each other. He did not feel uncomfortable that he might be encroaching on the time and energies of the great man. In fact the thought did not even occur to him.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Pran	Young couples always have tiffs.’ ‘Well, we can have tiffs about the baby’s education.’ ‘That’s too long to wait.’ ‘Well, about its feeding times. Do go back to sleep, [MASK], you’re being very tiresome.’
<name>he</name>	he	Baba	He had been deeply disturbed by his previous meeting, and he did not know if his perplexity had been enhanced or diminished by what [MASK] had told him. So much lay beneath the placid surface of things, so much torment and danger.
<name>the patient</name>	the patient	Savita	‘Yes, he’s sleeping, and it’s his doctor’s orders - and his wife’s — that he not move or suffer unnecessary excitement. I’m standing in for him.’ The nurse frowned. ‘Now lie quietly,’ she advised [MASK].
<name>Lily</name>	Lily	Tasneem	When [MASK] entered, she was moving her head slowly from side to side with a dreamy air. It would have been difficult to guess that her thick black hair had just revealed a single white one, and that she was looking around for others.
<name>She</name>	She	Savita	Her mother, thinking she was crying because of the pain, said: ‘Now, darling, be brave, it’ll all be over soon.’ [MASK] groaned, and held her mother’s hand tightly. The pain was now very nearly unbearable.
<name>Elle</name>	Elle	Savita	She moved the baby from one arm to the other surprisingly skilfully, cradling her head all the while. ‘What do you think about my studying law?’ said [MASK]. ‘Do you think I have the temperament for it?
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Sunil	Now shall I tell you what the impetus, the, er, catalyst, for all this, was ?’ ‘Oh, please do,’ said [MASK]. ‘It was a, er, a remark - a very, er, perceptive remark of yours.’
<name>someone's</name> (uncertain)	someone's (uncertain)	Maan	The thought struck him that perhaps his father’s acceptance of imprisonment had been something like this - except that [MASK]’s days were defined not by morning roll-call and lights-out, but by the muezzin’s call to prayer and the cow-dust hour when the cattle returned lowing through the lanes.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Kuku	‘But not for two hours at a time.’ He thought of [MASK]’s tub and began smiling. ‘And not in the river.’ ‘Don’t say “river”,’ said the old man sharply.
<name>She</name>	She	Malati	‘Oh, just a cup of coffee, nothing more. I have to go to a wedding. That’s why I’m so overdressed.’ [MASK] was wearing a green silk sari with a broad border in a darker green and gold. She was looking ravishing.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Amit	‘Yes, but we’re not there any longer. You must remember us to him. Now, tell me, are you the clever one ?’ ‘Yes,’ said [MASK] resignedly. ‘I’m the clever one.’ This delighted the dazzling lady.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Malati	‘And it’s breaking my heart.’ ‘[MASK],’ said her mother, ‘everyone must make their own mistakes. Why are you sure it is a mistake ?’ ‘It is, it is, I know it!’
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Maan	Most, however, were agricultural labourers, one or two with a bit of land of their own as well. In one house [MASK] recognized the man with the deeply furrowed face who had pumped water for him with so much willingness while he was having a bath.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Lata	‘And please stop those tears. They won’t improve your coffee or my appetite.’ For again, though she was half unconscious of them, tears had slowly filled [MASK]’s eyes and were falling down her cheeks one by one.
<name>She</name>	She	Haresh	This sounded so lukewarm, even to her, that she added: ‘It would really be very nice. It’s a good way to get to know each other.’ [MASK] was about to say something more, but decided against it.
<name>John</name>	John	Sandeep	‘Now, let’s go ahead - and kill the killers,’ continued [MASK], almost managing to look fierce. 10.5 the jeeps and car turned off the main road onto a dirt track, leaving the villagers behind.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Maan	‘I’m sure you could get me a kerosene dealer’s licence. That should be easy enough for the Revenue Minister’s son.’ ‘Actually, all that is under a different ministry,’ said [MASK], unoffended.
