<name>Smitty</name>	Smitty	Y’all	Hot as hell in that kitchen, he got to sit down where I’m at. [MASK] know he wants to start something. I pass by him going to put the Crisco back in the pantry. “Girl, if you don’t get your black tail out of my face, you better.”
<name>Everton</name>	Everton	Tourism	[MASK] was a failing proposition these days on his island home. He had resigned his ministerial post shortly after she’d fled their Blue Mountain hideaway, disillusioned over fallout from a war of words between his government and U.S. foreign policy interests, and political violence on the streets.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Sara	“And why have you stayed away so long?” “Twenty-three years?” [MASK] cocked her head, considering. “Is that such a long time?” “Almost as long as I am old.”
<name>Yolanda</name>	Yolanda	Mamin	They would repeat her words, laughing as they said them. [MASK]. Wah-tah. Vege-TAH-bles. She stopped speaking to avoid such scenes. But they still found fun to make of the quiet girl with the starched dresses and wrapped sandwiches.
<name>Yuki</name>	Yuki	Cedella	[MASK] plopped down on the couch beside me, stretched her thin little face into a grin, and launched full speed ahead into verbal assault. “Tell me about your job as a journalist in the States.” Lord, where do they make these people?
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Anita	If a woman didn’t keep up her hair, don’t care how pretty she was, how expensive her clothes, she wound up looking like anybody’s ragamuffin. “Well, I’m not ready to go yet,” [MASK] announced. She was looking pleased as punch.
<name>Jeremy</name>	Jeremy	Dennis	Look at you. I’m colored. You’re white.” “No.” [MASK] shakes his blond head. “I’m colored, too.” I went and got his crayon box and a big sheet of white paper. “Look at here.”
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Alma	Yet and still, this woman has let you into her home, her heart. Ain’t no reason for her to know about this, is there?” “There is nothing for her to know.” [MASK] sighed, turning her face from the picture frame.
<name>He</name>	He	Kwesi	Your friend, too, of course.” I bristled at the afterthought I’d become. [MASK] shook his head and glanced away from the magnetic pull of her. As if distrusting his own voice. His grip on my hand became tighter. “Very well.
<name>Baby</name>	Baby	Honey	I was tasting the world and liking it. I was getting ready to come out moving like a mountain. What you mean a mountain don’t move? [MASK], have you ever seen a volcano? I was ready to rock like an earthquake and roll like a river of lava.
<name>Anansi</name>	Anansi	Artanse	But consider this. They are not the only ones who’ve been transformed by their journey. Could [MASK] be more worried about his own readjustment? This trickster of a spider has grown quite accustomed to the fast life, bright lights, and relative plenty of the Western world.
<name>Candy</name>	Candy	Fondue	Him: Baby, you look like jail bait to me. Just how old are you? Me (lying): Eighteen and a half. Old enough to sleep in the bed without falling out. Him: I would never let you fall out of my bed, [MASK].
<name>Callie</name>	Callie	Allie	“That’s a real pretty plaid.” [MASK] points out a worn star in the center, its reds and oranges faded as autumn. “Where’d it come from?” “Come from a little strip of hand-weaving my great-grandmama used to have.
<name>He</name>	He	Alma	He lived in the same building, so he didn’t have far to run. [MASK] learned later that his flight was not motivated by fear for safety, but the rush of unexpected sexual attraction. Apparently the aphrodisiac had kicked in.
<name>Wilberforce</name>	Wilberforce	Wilberforce	“Our friend [MASK] has turned the King’s hand. It is all written here,” he proclaimed to the black crowd, most of them unable, if they tried, to ascertain the veracity of his statement. "Parliament entertains talks of abolishing slavery throughout the Commonwealth.”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Pop	I paid my $19.95. 1 picked up the key and started upstairs. “I said take it off!” Before I knew what was going on, [MASK] had reached over and snatched it right off my head. I tried to grab it back.
<name>Strife</name>	Strife	Heartbreak	She don’t be careful she going to get in a world of trouble. Hope she ain’t one of ours.” “Child, I’m glad I’m retired from all that. [MASK] and unhappiness. Riots, weapons. War and rumors of war.
<name>Charisse</name>	Charisse	Zubena	“Don’t think I don’t know,” [MASK] tosses her head, earrings jangling, “that y’all hate me just because I’m beautiful.” “Is that what the man told you?” The Needleworker, rarely heard from, cuts in icily.
<name>Ray</name>	Ray	Lola	This baby needs a mama, [MASK]. I told him 1 never bargained on being no mama, that he had forced this on me. It was his baby. So if he wanted you to have a mother, he was going to have to be it.”
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Alma	[MASK] purred contentedly from her side of the bed and eased into his arms. He held the cigarette away, flicking ashes into something unseen at the side of the bed. “You always did like to do it in the dark,” she teased.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Kwesi	We have not had each other in two weeks. I had not realized how keenly I would miss the closeness of [MASK]’s body next to mine. Not just the act, you know. There is something even more intimate than sex which comes from sleeping together.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sarah	I continued to wet nurse, for [MASK] was quite poorly for a time. She lay in bed, listless and weeping, insisting that the child could not be hers. Anyone with eyes could see both the maternity in the babe’s broad features, and the paternity in its blond curls and blue eyes.
<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Nina	He scribbled a B+ across the front page and thrust it at me. 1 hesitated, casting down a surreptitious glance to see if the bulge was there. But he still had the briefcase in his lap and was rifling through it again. [MASK] would be disappointed there was nothing to report.
<name>Tasha</name>	Tasha	Cinnamon	[MASK] shrugged, never one to worry over the one who got away. Plenty more where that came from. She made her way back to the living room and accepted a dance from the first man who asked, a stooped, light-skinned dude with green eyes and a trace of a foreign accent.
<name>Lucifer</name>	Lucifer	Gareth	For in a man’s touch can be nought but misery. That has been my lesson to her. I thought this knowledge, and my love, could save her. But how could I reckon the depravity to which [MASK] had descended?
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Richard	Glanced at her small body sitting beside him, feet tucked neatly underneath. He must have liked what he saw. He laughed again. “I am [MASK], the sexophonist. And you, my dear, look good enough to eat.”
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Anita	Which was exactly the thought that occurred to her. Carrying high-heeled boots in her hand, she padded to the back. Pressed her ear to the bedroom door. There was no sound to be heard. “[MASK],” she called softly.
<name>Jerome</name>	Jerome	Trevor	“1 tell you something bout these academic types, Sister Queen.” [MASK] was a charming rascal, flirting with me bold as daylight with his wife standing next to him, handing me a steaming plate of rice and peas.
<name>Cherry</name>	Cherry	Lola	Very youthful looking.” [MASK] regarded her reflection in the smoked-glass mirror above the bar. “I guess I have the black blood in me to thank for that. Good black don’t crack, ain’t that what they say?”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Trevor	A fellow devotee worshiping at the shrine? I knew it had to be the second woman. [MASK]’s wife. I just knew it. I got up and left, walking and crying the length of the campus.
<name>Alphonso</name>	Alphonso	Lola	[MASK] slapped down his hand. “I said sit down and eat your dinner. Don’t worry with that hardheaded child.” “But look what she did to herself. Hair all wild. She don’t even look like she came from you.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mary	They ’bout down South somewhere; [MASK] mighta had to leave them behind. So many peoples lost touch of they kin when they run off from slavery. First you got peoples, then you don’t, just drylongso like it wasn’t nothing wrong with it.
<name>John</name>	John	Trevor	And I will finally know you for yourself, and not just as the first woman [MASK] has loved. Most women in our circumstances have this urge to let the “other women” know we exist. Let me tell you how it all started.
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Anita	The conference room tabletop was spread with champagne, canapes, pastries. [MASK] agonized over the desserts. Petits fours, gooey with gobs of butter cream. Puffy eclairs oozing custard. A cake shaped like a bassinet with a brown plastic baby inside.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Shirley	For some reason [MASK] looked real funny at that suggestion. “Well.” She twitched in her seat, sipping her some kinda liqueur. “I guess we could go by and see them. If they at home.” “Why don’t you call over there and see?”
<name>Enrique</name>	Enrique	Trevor	It ain’t me. The childhood message that would echo into her womanhood. Even when her taste in men emerged, shaped by her long association with [MASK]. The parade of intriguing, foreign-bom men marching through her life would be just as elusive.
<name>Emeka</name>	Emeka	Jojo	We move to take off our shoes, but [MASK] advises against it. He points to scatters of prickly plant life, half-buried in the sands. “Those things go chuke your leg,” he warns in pointed pidgin. We follow his advice and remain shod.
<name>Pat</name>	Pat	Pop	“Pat, baby.” If she could see him, she knew his brown face would be shiny with smiles. “Now what’s wrong, little old girl?” “Nothing’s wrong, [MASK].” “You can’t fool me, angel.
<name>Tina</name>	Tina	Cinnamon	[MASK] knew money when she saw it and the man spelled M-O-N-E-Y. He caught up with her just as she stepped through the doorway to the living room. The pimply dude was lurking there and made a feeble move in her direction.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Alma	“So you’ve waited until you’re nine months pregnant to try out African moonshine? Bad idea.” “Oh, it’s not just for me.” [MASK] tilted the bottle and dribbled its contents onto the flower bed bordering the verandah.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Kwesi	“It was an airline ticket office, not a house of ill repute. And I have business to take care of there. You’re going to have to take me back." “Bullshit,” [MASK] replied calmly.
<name>Henri</name>	Henri	Nina	Matinees at Her Majesty’s. Such tourist traps she had never bothered with on the continent with [MASK]. They had been more interested in the human landscape than in sightseeing. But there was something pleasantly reassuring in losing herself among the anonymous crowds of tourists.
<name>Esteban</name>	Esteban	Kwesi	If only I could have seen [MASK] once again, and shown him the woman I have become. If only I could see my mother, and tell her the things I now know. Blood is seen before birth.” “I am here,” a voice answers.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Allie	That given the proper guidance, these people actually can learn to appreciate les belles lettres.. ..” The conversation trails off as [MASK] pushes through the swinging doors with the tray of untouched sandwiches. She is smiling, flushed with the recent success of her oral reading.
<name>Nettie</name>	Nettie	Livia	But [MASK] said it like this; at least there’d be two of you. White folks was going to make it hard, but at least you would have each other to lean on. And be getting that good education, couldn’t nobody take it away.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Kwesi	She gave him one of her new smiles that lingered. “You will let no one stop our being together. If they try, you will kill them.” [MASK] could only nod his head in mute agreement.
<name>Nyoka</name>	Nyoka	Ama	He only wanted to touch [MASK], to feel the brown silk of her skin. He found his hand reaching beneath her loincloth, resting it against the gentle thrust of her buttocks. He found his fingers straying to the cups of her breasts, and squeezing the berries which bloomed there.
<name>Tina</name>	Tina	Shirley	“Have a good time.” [MASK] stopped talking and fiddled with her earring. She was either getting ready to lie or ask for something outrageous. “I’m probably gonna take him back to the room with me. Do you mind?” Mind?
<name>Heather</name>	Heather	Cinnamon	She was so anxious she actually twisted her hands. [MASK] felt sorry for her. The girl had no self-confidence, no social graces. She had lucked up getting that man to notice her in the first place.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Cinnamon	“Well," [MASK] thought about it, “to tell you the truth, I sometimes think somebody else is there. It’s a feeling I get, like someone’s trying to reach me, to tell me something.
<name>Miranda</name>	Miranda	Cinnamon	And having a near-sighted albatross hanging on was almost as bad as not dancing at all. It scared off the serious prospects. [MASK] locked herself in the bathroom and critically examined her reflection. First she checked out her body from all angles in a full-length mirror attached to the door.
<name>Thaddeus</name>	Thaddeus	Elmira	He stole my pappa’s life. He stole my past. He took my father away from me before he got the chance to tell me who I was.” [MASK] leaned heavily on one cane and used the other to push open the back door.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Clyde	I’m closer to sixty than I am to sixteen. When you young all that hair hanging down your back looks sexy. When you old, it looks witchy. It may sound cold-blooded to you, but the day [MASK] passed I got shed of this hair.
<name>Man</name>	Man	Diary	Let’s do it. In flies this white dude, the Absent-Minded Egghead. He had on hornrimmed glasses about an inch thick, and hair about an inch short. [MASK], he looked like a creature that had just crawled out from under anybody’s library.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Alma	A house bursting at the seams, crammed full of children, bric-a-brac, and bustle. [MASK] was overwhelmed. A seat was found for her in the midst of it, while the three sisters disappeared out the back door on some unannounced mission.
<name>Wanjiku</name>	Wanjiku	Ama	“Tell me, who has killed your mother?” “The hunter.” “What hunter? Tell me, [MASK]. Did you do this thing?” “She drove you away when she found us together. She drove my hunter away, too.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Trevor	It’s hard to give up your first love. It stays in your blood forever, like malaria. Dormant sometimes, sometimes flaring up in fever. There’s no cure for it.” Tell me about it, [MASK]. I know the nature of such afflictions.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Allie	What can we get for you today?” Though it stews in her mind all day, [MASK] doesn’t mention it until much later that evening. After the notions had been unpacked and put away, after the butter beans bubbling on the stovetop and the combread rising in the skillet.
<name>Bussa</name>	Bussa	Nanny	The word emancipation was chanted at midnight meetings, found its way into Cropover celebration songs, was uttered boldly in the slave quarters, and whispered in the very kitchen of the great house. [MASK] took the message and sent it echoing like drumbeats throughout the parish.
<name>Alonso</name>	Alonso	Ananse	This was just the opening he needed. [MASK] begins to embellish the very lie he had been spinning. “I am a weaver, as was my father and his father before him. I was trained at the village of master weavers, you must know of it?
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Nigger	“Do as I say, child. Get on.” I went to bed but not to sleep. 1 listened at the voices and tried to think who they belonged to. “[MASK], you’re going to sign this thing.”
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Alma	But don’t love him. Men like that aren’t made for loving. I’m a living witness, cuz.” [MASK]’s dark eyes sparkled with sudden, drunken mischief. She raised a slender finger to her mouth. “Imagine that!
<name>Nefret</name>	Nefret	Alma	“Your skin is black like mine. Your hair and your eyes, my hair. My eyes. Are you not a child of mine?” The hand fell away. [MASK] opened her mouth to explain again, but the scribe interceded for her.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Jojo	[MASK] remains behind, finding a shady place to nap. He is blase about this atrocity, having lived at close quarters with it all his life. But at times it is not enough to snare an antelope, to fell a buffalo.
<name>Rasheed</name>	Rasheed	Beverly	Past the dining area we could see into the living room, a heaving shadow of something snoring on the couch. “Who’s that?” [MASK] shrugged. “Some drunk fool, me not even sure me know his name. Now, where we going to sleep you?
<name>Yaz</name>	Yaz	Alma	[MASK] laid the bottle gently against her chest, like she was burping a baby. “Probably a flaw in my makeup. Like the brother who can’t interest himself in anything but a white woman. I’ve always been attracted to Black men from other places.
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Allie	She seems to be speaking more to herself than her younger cousin. “Can you believe this mess?” [MASK] suddenly remembers how much she admires, and at the same time dislikes, her stuck-up cousin. She is uncomfortable sharing a bed with her later that night.
<name>Denver</name>	Denver	Sara	I lose so many I stop counting. Some born too early, some too late, some bom without breath. None of m’children decide to stay until [MASK]. That a real old child, take her twenty-five years to come to the world.
<name>She</name>	She	Alma	She must have made a wrong turn. The corridor ended in an alcove. There sat a woman at a large bay window. Looking out into the still night. “Excuse me,” [MASK] whispered. The woman turned. White hair against a whiter face.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Mary	It wasn’t till her old age that [MASK] got religion, you know. When she was a young woman she was supposed to had trucked in all kinds of devilish conjure and carrying on. That’s how I hear it.
<name>She</name>	She	Cedella	Life was what they used to have, the good old days were what used to be when the world was right. [MASK] musta been practicing to be professional old folks herself. Or maybe that career she loved to talk so much about. One in investigative journalism.
<name>Brer</name>	Brer	Spider	“You thirsty, baby? Here, take a little drink of water." And after [MASK] had drunk his fill, the ghost grannies tucked those heads under their arms and went to dancing. Now dead folks, they don’t dance like we do.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Henry	“Oh, he did, did he? Lucky thing he happened to have it with him. Did he know it by heart, or was it written down in his little black book? And how is [MASK] this morning, all curled up in my bed?”
<name>Waking</name>	Waking	Disturbed	But the clanging of the cell door has brought our presence to the attention of the day watchman. [MASK] from his midday rest, he irritably issues us away. “The castle is closed,” he shouts. “Come again at half-two.”
<name>Spaniards</name>	Spaniards	Africans	We cross over to the beach side of the road. Which is deserted. [MASK] do not love sun just for its own sake. Feel no need to toast their well-browned bodies. When they swim it is generally a matter of necessity, not leisure.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Freddy	[MASK] was eyeing his wife uneasily, getting ready to grip. Wanting to have his cake and pudding, too. “I’m just getting me a drink of wine, baby. Go on back there. I’ll be out in a minute.”
<name>Boy</name>	Boy	Child	“And the fruit don’t fall far from the tree, huh? [MASK], I don’t hardly expect you to produce no grandkids on my account. If you have them, you damn sure gonna have to raise them.”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Junior	“[MASK], mahn. Don’t tell me you forget rehearsal again . . .” And the dropping open of the other man’s mouth, the stopping of his speech. And then his slow, sly smile. “What is this, now?
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Kwesi	When it was over, I wanted to beg forgiveness for taking her that way, but when she looked up and smiled that luminous smile of hers, I knew it wasn’t necessary. Watch out, [MASK], my man. Not only do you have a tiger by the tail.
<name>Sweet</name>	Sweet	Blondine	“Hey. Life ain’t nothing but a party. You better get it and get off while the getting is good, girls.” Who else but [MASK] could say something like that and make it sound hip instead of nasty? “Shoot.”
<name>Kambili</name>	Kambili	Alma	“In African tradition, a new wife cannot be brought into the household unless the others agree. You have the approval of my second woman. You must now travel home to get the blessing of the first.” [MASK] realized that their loving had finally come full circle.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Fred	A short, stocky woman close to his age suddenly appeared in the kitchen doorway. Her face, pinched with irritation and suspicion, had wife written all over it. “[MASK], what are you doing in here?” Her voice was as pinched as her face.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Anita	To feel some strong man trembling like a leaf. To know that I made it happen. And I always keep thinking maybe. Maybe this time.” [MASK] sat there blushing to beat the band. “You just haven’t found the right man yet.”
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Chike	He was possessed of a thicker skin. He was of another people and accustomed to bucking the odds of being a stranger in a strange land. And he was a man. [MASK], after ten years, had begged and bribed enough influence to land a job as a bank clerk.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Kwesi	I need the money. And just where do you get off planning my life for me? Telling me what I will and won’t do?” The movement of [MASK]’s capable hands slowed. He suddenly rested his head against my swollen stomach and whispered into it.
<name>Britannia</name>	Britannia	Elmina	Having not yet developed the fierce and hairy outer shell, it is tender and easily taken. We wonder if [MASK] was once this way, at a time before her name was changed. Before the eyes of a nation turned outward, toward the invaders crawling her coastlines.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Tony	His voice brought spring into her quiet room. Worked to loosen the brace of frost that stiffened her heart these days. She got up from the desk and sank into a nearby armchair. “[MASK]. How are?” Her voice fumbled at careful conversation.
<name>Dracula</name>	Dracula	Dracula	I don’t do that kind of stuff with boys. But even the Black girls I know that lay all the way down, they don’t get up with that boy’s toothprints on their neck. Some of the girls around this school look like [MASK] been biting on them.
<name>Rosalind</name>	Rosalind	Eleanor	She is very quick of mind, [MASK]. She speaks not in the broken patois of her kind, but in perfect up-country English. Her manners are ever so dainty and graceful. She sews a fine hand, she pours a perfect cup.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Hunter	“I ain’t got your tailey-po. Let me alone." [MASK] don’t hear nothing again, so he go on back to sleep. Next night, same thing happen. “Tailey-po," something howl outside the door.
<name>Odysseus</name>	Odysseus	Honey	[MASK], you are going home. Now everybody get settled. We got a long ride ahead of us, but it’s nothing compared to the years we’ve been waiting. “Anybody got a traveling song to make the journey light? What’s that?
<name>Kambili</name>	Kambili	Bisi	In the early days when her mother was young and her father had but one wife, [MASK] would climb onto his lap in early evenings. His room was placed directly in the center of their small compound. She came there after dinner had been served and eaten, and the sun was fading.
<name>Yolanda</name>	Yolanda	Cinnamon	“Yeah,” [MASK] sighed. “Is this going to be the one to make my loneliness go away?” “Who won’t wind up telling me Naw, baby. It ain’t me?” “Who’ll finally satisfy me in bed?”
<name>She</name>	She	Trevor	What prompted the final separation? [MASK] surely thought it was my paranoia about other women. But it wasn’t. It was the same you people epithet that had eventually erupted from the mouth of every man I ever loved, all of them men from other places.
<name>Yama</name>	Yama	Ananse	I, Gatekeeper of the Great Beyond. Does he not realize 1 can reach across this river and crush the two of them like the insects they are? Yet I cannot openly oppose [MASK] without offending the Queen Mother. So I am content to bide my time.
<name>Homies</name>	Homies	Peeples	I’m fixing to write my way out of the ghetto. I know I got a way with words; I just need to get my grammar and spelling together. I might even be the one to get all the [MASK] back together.
<name>Roark</name>	Roark	Kwesi	The buyer, not the seller.” “Ah.” [MASK] held one finger up in revelation; that was one of his favorite gestures. “But victim is not always blameless. Sometimes you give the master permission to oppress you. I know whereof I speak.
<name>Sula</name>	Sula	Anita	“You calling me colorstuck?” he asked. “That seems a strange complaint coming from you. [MASK] couldn’t care less about being a clear-skinned woman. You, on the other hand, seem to cherish that bit of white blood running through your veins.”
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Alma	[MASK] did not plan to sleep with him. She had quickly rewritten his role in the script. Former lover becomes deliverer of lodgings. She waited for him to leave her, duty done. But he sat close to her, talking and drinking with the couple.
<name>Shug</name>	Shug	Cedella	Too busy pretending to be engrossed in other folks’ stories, she wouldn’t have to tell none of her own. But even as I sat there, congratulating myself on my amazing insight, some-thing hit me. Me and [MASK], maybe we were two of a kind.
