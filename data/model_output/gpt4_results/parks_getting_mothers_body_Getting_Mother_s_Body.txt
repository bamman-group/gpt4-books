<name>should</name>	should	Beedes	I take a few good breaths, getting my voice back. “You [MASK] figure out what you want to do. I’m happy to help dig, but I don’t need to get killed,” I say walking away.
<name>Sal</name>	Sal	Teddy	“Traveling’s high. It was high six years ago and it’s more high now.” “We can pull some money together, can’t we, [MASK]?” I ask. I wait for him to tell me yes but he don’t.
<name>he</name>	he	Homer	Her and him smile at each other. “How bout that gas?” I says. “My cousin and I are out for a ride today,” [MASK] says, his voice sounding deeper now, deeper than it did when he was talking to me.
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Addie	“I can see that.” “I was just saying.” “I ain’t blind, [MASK],” I says. She goes quiet and I get to work, lining a quick smear of grease around her forehead, ears, and nape.
<name>husband</name>	husband	Dale	She can talk to you or to herself. It don’t matter. Some of her talking is nice, though, and she did ask about the baby. “I can tell you the minute to the day my [MASK] quit loving me,” she says.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Dill	“She wanted to take her jewelry with her and it’s bad luck to go against the wishes of the dead, ain’t it?” “Maybe not,” I says. I look at [MASK] who has looked up from her book to stare at me.
<name>Grady</name>	Grady	Lincoln	He says the funeral business is about making people happy but I’ve never seen no one smiling at a funeral. He doesn’t think [MASK]’s got the economy to support a formal-wear store and, tell the truth, I don’t turn a profit.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Gonzales	“He wants to run this filling station,” I says. “We’ll be back in plenty of time,” she says. “[MASK] wanna run a filling station he gonna have to run one someplace else.” “Whatchu got underneath yr arm?”
<name>Sari</name>	Sari	Billy	It ain’t easy sleeping sitting in the seats so we laying in the truck bed now. Lucky it ain’t raining is all I got to say. Nothing we could do about the police. [MASK] is laying on her side. First one side then the other.
<name>Sylvie</name>	Sylvie	Homer	A skinny white gal comes out. She’s got on a Texaco uniform that fits her close and long yellow hair swinging free. She looks us both over then gives a sly look at the restaurant across the road. “We’d like some gas,” [MASK] says.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Laz	[MASK] gets up from the bed to take a closer look. “That you?” “A long time ago.” “Standing up and riding in the saddle,” he says. He looks from the photograph to me. I had style then.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Dill	A sprig of cudweed, with its round papery-white flowerheads and its nice lemony smell, is wedged in the middle of the rocks. [MASK] snorts. “You put in them rocks?” she asks me. “Even done it,” I says.
<name>Pa</name>	Pa	Teddy	She don’t say nothing to that, but she gives me a look that woulda cut my throat from end to end if her eyes was knives. Her Mother taught her to give looks like that, she sure didn’t learn it from [MASK] or me.
<name>Starr</name>	Starr	Billy	“We don’t know how much exactly,” [MASK] says, “but you won’t be wasting your time.” “My son does not need to be digging like some n--,” my mamma says. She don’t say “nigger,” though, just the “n” part.
<name>Tracker</name>	Tracker	Dill	I think I’m talking in my head but when [MASK] answers I realize that I’m talking out loud. “When folks talk about her all they tell is stories about her flash and whatnot,” I says.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Homer	[MASK] looks at me. I look at the speedometer. We’re doing eighty. “How much you think the jewels are worth?” he asks. “Hundreds,” I say. I see the disappointment working into his face, like a drought coming, but not there yet.
<name>Malcolm</name>	Malcolm	Dill	When he didn’t do any of that, I saw the fingerprints and that picture he took of me as things that would be a bad mark on my career. The white man was doing what he could to keep me down. But [MASK] tops that white man.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Homer	It weren’t hard, she said. She told me to say “good riddance” to the baby while we drove along. She said we’d be free of our troubles and looking at palm trees by the end of the week. [MASK] wedges his hand gently between my legs.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	June	A smile passes over [MASK]’s face before a new thought comes to her and she looks down at the floor. “We’ll need that dollar for our own bus fare when we head up after you tomorrow,” she says. And she’s right.
<name>Taylor</name>	Taylor	Dill	Something else comes into my head. I wait for a lot of miles before I say it, then I figure what the hell. “What’s it like, being a man?” I ask [MASK]. She looks at me, her eyes like two slow snakes.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Teddy	“Plenty for bus fare,” she says, laying down behind the counter so we, sitting in our two chairs, can’t see her. I poke [MASK] in the side with my elbow, getting him to ask again. “How much is bus fare?”
<name>Saffron</name>	Saffron	June	“I ain’t saying take her out the ground,” [MASK] says yelling. “I’m just saying take her treasury out the ground.” Then her voice goes soft. “Just enough to get me a leg,” she says.
<name>Rosie</name>	Rosie	Precious	I show them my best table, the one furthest from the front door and closest to the back exit. They pull up the chairs and, the four of them, all hunched over, count they money. Me and [MASK] stand behind the bar, giving them they privacy.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Dill	“We can all profit from this,” I say, taking another step forward. [MASK] shoots her gun into the air. The horse they have gets up on its rear legs, pulling at the chain but not breaking it.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alberta	“Call him what you want, I’m telling you he ain’t here.” The gal holds her hand up to her forehead, taking the sun off her face. She got a wide nose and mouth, but pretty eyes. “You his sister [MASK]?”
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	June	It was my church. I made it myself out of slats of pine wood. I rented and cleared the land. I was going to preach in a church like I’d done for years along the rivers. Me and [MASK] showed up here.
<name>Leon</name>	Leon	Teddy	“Someone or something’s in the office,” [MASK] says. He whispers it to me. Most nights we sleep in our own beds. He got his bed on one side of the trailer and I got mines on the other.
<name>Nettie</name>	Nettie	Billy	“I’m doing all right.” “Having children is a blessing,” I says. [MASK] rolls her eyes at me and looks away. Across the street a man has come out his house in his bathrobe to look at us. A white man.
<name>Sal</name>	Sal	Laz	[MASK] slows down even more. “I don’t want to miss the motel.” “They got a big sign out front, you won’t miss it,” I says and we pick up speed again, leaving the little crowd behind us.
<name>Suttree</name>	Suttree	Billy’ll	[MASK] be there. “How bout I take you?” I says. “No thanks.” “We could leave today. Hell, we could leave right now.” “I ain’t riding no place in no hearse.”
<name>Leon</name>	Leon	Homer	“We got a restaurant too,” I says. “I’ll come visit sometime, little cousin,” [MASK] says, patting me on the head. Patting me on the head like he ain’t felt my crotch and kissed my hand a mile ago.
<name>Jerome</name>	Jerome	Snipes	Then I do feel a scrap of something and give it a yank. Big red shiny drawers. Not mines. [MASK] turns around and sees me holding them. “My sister’s,” he says smiling and putting on his shirt.
<name>My husband</name>	My husband	Teddy	And I still ain’t got my leg back. My husband and my father made a deal in the river. Once I asked [MASK] what they’d said. He looked ashamed and answered by giving me a kiss on the cheek. I never asked again.
<name>Sugar</name>	Sugar	Dill	“I’ma kill the bitch,” [MASK] says, “I’ma be on the morning bus tomorrow and get out there and I’ma kill the bitch.” I know she don’t mean it. She do want her truck back, though, that’s sure.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Laz	After a while I kick the base of the door with my boot. But I don’t kick too hard. Behind me, [MASK], out of the hearse, stands in place, stretching his back, his arms, his sides.
<name>Temple</name>	Temple	June	“Tell me what my daddy tolt you, that time you two was in the river,” [MASK] says. She turns to look at me but I keep looking at the ceiling. “It was complicated.” “I ain’t stupid.”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Teddy	[MASK]’s got a forkful of pork chop on the way to his mouth. He holds it there, then sets it back on his plate. The fork touching down makes a little clattering sound. He’s got a look on his face I been looking at for many years.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Billy	“We all end up in the ground,” I says. The tune [MASK]’s whistling don’t sound like a song. Just a bunch of notes and not in a steady rhythm. Then I recognize it.
<name>Earl</name>	Earl	Clifton	Her voice goes lower, more private. “It was love but not true love. You know what I’m talking bout, dontcha?” “Me and my husband, [MASK], we got true love,” I says.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Jimmy	Her hair, the same red as the doodads on her shoes, is whipped high like cotton candy. “[MASK] was telling a joke,” she says, continuing, “ ‘How you f— a fat girl?
<name>Emmeline</name>	Emmeline	Dill	“I always said there weren’t never no real treasure buried there nohow. It was all just a story she made up. I told you the truth of it but you stuck on believing the story,” she says. “[MASK] buried your mother with her jewels.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Dill	It’s like she’s looking at me through her closed eyelids. I go out on the porch, letting the screen door slam behind me. “Suit yrself,” [MASK] yells through the screen. “Suit yr goddamn knocked-up self.”
<name>God</name>	God	Teddy	She told me she was sorry for the wrong she’d done me and that she wanted to be put in the ground with her pearl necklace and her diamond ring. I gave her my word. Then she died. I was with her. [MASK] knows.
<name>Nettie</name>	Nettie	Dill	“You said you don’t like my company.” [MASK] shrugs her shoulders to that. “Whatchu gonna name the piggies?” I ask her. “You was the one who always named them, not me.” “It helped me tell them apart.”
<name>Shug</name>	Shug	Addie	“It ain’t until next month so I’ll be able to get another touch-up before we go,” [MASK] says. Someone’s looking in the window. My heart gets glad thinking it’s a customer. It ain’t.
<name>Dean</name>	Dean	Homer	“We’ll stop at a filling station in a little bit,” [MASK] says, “the ladies can catch us then.” We whip down the road. Everything standing still looks like it’s moving. A steer raises its head, big long horns pointing east and west, looking at us.
<name>Annabeth</name>	Annabeth	Dill	“I’ma talk to [MASK]. I think she’ll hear me out,” he says. I lift my hand up, taking hold of the hem of his coat. Before I lost my leg I felt something bad was gonna happen, something bad that I couldn’t stop from happening.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Dill	Nothing ladylike on her at all. “I’ll tell you when the piglets get weaned,” [MASK] says. “Then you can come by and pick one out.” “Sounds good to me,” I says.
<name>She</name>	She	Billy	That time I burned her scalp. [MASK] can see my hands shaking and the egg timer’s hands moving and the relaxer already started. She crosses behind the cash register, taking her old smock off the nail where it’s hanging and putting it on.
<name>Jess</name>	Jess	Dill	“Hell, [MASK], I’m practically yr brother,” he says. “I ain’t no goddamn Beede,” I says and we both laugh. We see a speck coming down the road. Too small and too slow for no car.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Billy	I would always play the Rich Lady. Now the Finder can be a man or a woman or a child. They got to be real honest looking. The Finder was always [MASK]’s part. Getting a man to play the Driver wasn’t never too hard.
<name>Alvarez</name>	Alvarez	Duck	There’s a faded red wooden depot with a windmill water-pump in front. A small sign, plain and white with faded black letters: [MASK]’s Pass Three Mexican cowboys, small and handsome in they clean just-bought duds, get on.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Billy	I got all the way up to the windows without them seeing me. But they was through doing it already and when I seen them sitting there I didn’t feel mad I just felt sick. Now I can hear [MASK] walking in her shoes. Clop clop.
<name>Missy</name>	Missy	Clifton	She narrow, like I said, but there’s something fat about her. Something swole around her middle. I know what it is and don’t want to know. She stands on one foot, scratching her leg with the other. “[MASK] tolt me to come Thursday,” she says.
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Billy	I look at my hand. It’s reached out automatically for the food. I drop my arm, pretending like I was flicking the offer away. “Thanks just the same,” I says, trying to make my voice sound hard like [MASK]’s do.
<name>Chigurh</name>	Chigurh	Joseph	There’s a little place in the center of the room. Long enough for a man to lie down. Outside the door [MASK] stands like a soldier on watch, his shotgun, with the butt in the ground, next to his foot and the barrel slanting out.
<name>She</name>	She	Dill	“We all got dreams,” I says. Her and me sit there quiet. The horse, at the far end of his clothesline, evacuates. [MASK] shifts her gun in her lap. “I don’t got no dreams of nothing,” she says.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Myrna	“Had me another dream,” [MASK] goes on, “dreamt I made a phone call. A whole slew of numbers. Longer than just long distance. Phone rings and rings. Then the party picks up. On the other end guess who it was?
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Dill	and we was just to go out there and dig, it would be like stealing. [MASK] speaks through her teeth. “Yr waiting for me to say go head but I ain’t gonna say it,” she says.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Laz	[MASK] stands at the foot of the grave, looking at it. He takes off his cap and bows his head. His hair is pressed down and uncombed and a little long for my taste. “It’s a nice headstone,” he says.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Sipping	She drove fast like we was running late, the sky just whipping by and her taking little sips from a bottle that she held between her legs. [MASK] as she drove. Sometimes getting drunk. She had a ritual before she turned on the engine.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	June	[MASK]’s leaning on her crutch. She lent me her own grip to put my things in. A small brown suitcase with the leather sides all cracked and sun-burned, but the clasps and handle still good.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Even	We watch the horse out the back window. Loose from his chain he’s halfway across the field, almost to the tractors. “One day I’ma stand on his back and ride him. Maybe today,” [MASK] says. “Want me to catch him?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lazarus	and I do what she tells me, getting on top of her soft warmish coolness and putting my thing in her and she don’t got to tell me how to move it cause somehow I know that so I’m moving it around while she says [MASK] over and over in my ear.
<name>She</name>	She	Dill	I let go the box and kick it. It flies a few feet then scuttles along the ground. [MASK] turns from looking at me to look at the box. She looks at it like it’s something worth looking at, so I look at it too.
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Billy	[MASK], over at the side counter, is a less competent cook than I thought. I take the bowl from her. The batter is over-stirred. “I’ll take over from here,” I say and she hangs her head.
<name>Janet</name>	Janet	Shirley	“Stand here while I radio in your information,” I says. I tell [MASK] back at the station what I caught and she checks through the postings but there ain’t no one looking for what I got. They stand with their hands still on the hood.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Billy	He opens the trailer door yelling, scaring the robber and myself. I hurry to get up. He’s already in the office with the light turned on. “Who the hell is it?” I yell. “It’s [MASK],” he goes.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Walter	“He takes after his father in every way.” “We woulda liked to come to [MASK]’s funeral.” “He went so quickly.” “Earlier this year, was it?” “Last summer. Over a year ago now,” I say.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Clifford	I would smell them elephants and, you know, the heavy smell they got would make me drop this child and there I’d be, having number seven not in a hospital. And after [MASK] promised me seven would be born in a hospital too.
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Billy	He lifts the bag towards us. We don’t move. “We ain’t hungry,” [MASK] says. I look at my hand. It’s reached out automatically for the food. I drop my arm, pretending like I was flicking the offer away.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Dill	“Plus I just cleaned the vents so the air oughta come in nice.” [MASK] spits hard at the box and hits it dead on. “What the hell you standing in my yard for?” she says. “Go get yr goddamn hearse.”
<name>Lucinda</name>	Lucinda	Billy	“Why you gotta keep bringing her into it?” [MASK] says. She wipes herself down with her dirty housedress as I hand her a clean one, one of my castoffs, green and faded, but clean and with a good zipper up the front.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Laz	but she can twirl the gun around and when she do hit a can she blows the smoke away from the gun barrel like a Saturday-morning cowboy. [MASK] gives it a try, squirming up his face and standing to one side with his arm straight and steady as a board.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Teddy	We lay there breathing together. Each of our beds is underneath a window. I look out [MASK]’s window and see a half-slip of moon. It lights up the bed making us both look bluey. “I’ma go
<name>Jess</name>	Jess	Billy	The horse they have gets up on its rear legs, pulling at the chain but not breaking it. “Keep going just like yr going,” [MASK] says. Her voice has a nasty edge to it. I’m still in the lead but she’s right behind me.
<name>Earl</name>	Earl	Rude	He is trying to smoke me out by talking about his cherry pie, but I ain’t falling for it. I was crazy enough to marry [MASK] and I was crazy enough to put his name on the sign up there with mine and I’m crazy enough to cheat on him
<name>Sofia</name>	Sofia	Billy	“I can talk sense to her cause we’s friends.” He gets up and walks around the house. When he’s out of our view there’s several shots. [MASK] stands up but the rest of us can’t move.
<name>She</name>	She	Billy	“I’m just walking. People keep they lights on, it ain’t my fault,” I says. [MASK] got something shiny and jingling in her hand. I hear it jingle and look towards it but she hides her hand behind her back before I can see.
<name>Isak</name>	Isak	Laz	He pulls his cap down over his glasses then pushes it up again. Once upon a time I had me a romantic mindset like [MASK]’s got now. I ain’t telling him that, though. “You ain’t told me how Even was,” I says.
<name>Easy</name>	Easy	Peoples	“Class hours, tests passed, heads trimmed, konks, plus shaving and manicures too. One hundred and fifty class hours.” “Sounds like they covered all the bases,” [MASK] says. His voice coming through the towel is thick with steam.
<name>Rosa</name>	Rosa	Irene	[MASK], who answers my phone and doubles as the nurse, has gone home. Throughout the day, my patients come in. Mexicans mostly, coming in here for vaccines and stitches. I’m the only doctor around who gives them service.
<name>Rocco</name>	Rocco	Dill	Then I’ll be the true man of the house and mother will have to let me go to any college I want. I take another step. Then another. [MASK] points the pistol right at us and we all hit the dirt.
<name>Thelma</name>	Thelma	Homer	We got the top down so the wind whips at us pretty good. I hold my hat on with one hand and hold on to the middle armrest with the other. We go fast. Then faster. [MASK] looks at me and smiles. 1 smile back.
<name>Rashad</name>	Rashad	Laz	“That’s the car for me,” [MASK] says. He watches it in his rearview and then pulls his eyes back to the road. “I’ma get a car one of these days. My own car.” “With what money?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Snipes	and I laugh till his squeezing hurts and I make him let go. “Today’s Wednesday, ain’t it?” [MASK] says. He looks down the road, seeing his upcoming appointments in his head. “I’m free towards the end of the week.
<name>Jess</name>	Jess	Homer	“We left them in the dust,” [MASK] says. I turn to look. The road points out behind us, tight and straight, the hot tar of it almost singing in the heat. Sure enough, we have left the truck far behind.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Peoples	He got a thick chest and thick arms, he got a thick neck and pebbly skin from shaving. “We gotta find a way to cure me of these bumps,” [MASK] says, looking at his skin.
<name>Huck</name>	Huck	Teddy	“I got one of my two Josephs working for me,” I says, “I could ask them for a loan on your behalf.” “We only need about ten dollars or so,” [MASK] says.
<name>Alonzo</name>	Alonzo	Laz	He’s laying between the two gas pumps with his hands acrosst his chest. “Someone’s gonna drive up and run over your head, [MASK],” I says. He don’t move for a minute then he gets up and comes to sit on the porch.
<name>He</name>	He	Homer	“I enjoy knowing that I can help my family,” he says. He turns around in his seat, watching the road again. “She don’t like you far from home,” I says. [MASK] makes a face.
<name>Beede</name>	Beede	DILL	Then she goes and throws the dress on the floor and walks out the store. “I tried to help her out, ” my wife says. “She’s a Beede and it can’t be helped,” I says. [MASK] SMILES
<name>Al</name>	Al	Homer	and she looks at me quick. She don’t see no wedding ring, so she looks back at [MASK]. “Nice car you got,” she says. “It’s a Park Lane,” he says. Her and him smile at each other.
<name>Esmeralda</name>	Esmeralda	Jezebel	“You can buy one, same as everybody else,” I says. My good sow [MASK] farrowed last night. Got up in my bed to do it too. She’s spoiled. “Thirteen piglets and no runts.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Dill	We left [MASK]’s in the middle of the day. We took all our stuff so I knew we were going for good. She ate the herbs while we was driving and she would pull the car over every once and a while and get sick.
<name>Earl</name>	Earl	Dill	There ain’t nothing normal when it comes to Men and Relations. [MASK] liked the lights off and the clothes on. I had a roof over my head and our Relations were good. One night we was going at it and I got bold.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Teddy	“Stand up, [MASK],” I says and he stands up. “I’m at a loss for words,” he says. He goes to sit down but I give him a look that won’t let him sit. He clears his throat.
<name>Sharon</name>	Sharon	Myrna	It’s a good baby already. “I wonder if this land round here was ever crowded,” [MASK] goes. “You know, if like, millions and millions of years ago this part of the world was a busy place.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Billy	“That was the way she wanted it.” I can’t hear [MASK] breathe or move or nothing. I let out a long sigh but she stays quiet. I move toward her, sliding slow across the ridges of the truck bed.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Teddy	It’s like she’s a haint, talking from her pallet underneath the counter where we can’t see her, her voice rising up out of what looks like the cash register. I give [MASK] another poke in the side.
