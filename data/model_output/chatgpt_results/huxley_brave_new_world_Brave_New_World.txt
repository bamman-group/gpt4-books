<name>Mustapha</name>	Mustapha	Frightened	And anyhow, why are people so beasdy to him? I think he’s rather sweet.” She smiled to herself; how absurdly shy he had been! [MASK] almost—as though she were a World Controller and he a Gamma-Minus machine minder.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Bernard	You’re like what you were then.” “Because I’m unhappy again; that’s why.” “Well, I’d rather be unhappy than have the sort of false, lying happiness you were having here.” “I like that,” said [MASK] bitterly.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Edmund	‘The wheel has come frill circle; I am here.’ But where would [MASK] be nowadays? Sitting in a pneumatic chair, with his arm round a girl’s waist, sucking away at his sex-hormone chewing-gum and looking at the feelies.
<name>Brett</name>	Brett	Lenina	O “Of course there’s no need to give him up. Have somebody else from time to time, that’s all. He has other girls, doesn’t he?” [MASK] admitted it. “Of course he does.
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Helmholtz	[MASK] had listened to the scene of the lovers’ first meeting with a puzzled interest. The scene in the orchard had delighted him with its poetry; but the sentiments expressed had made him smile. Getting into such a state about having a girl—it seemed rather ridiculous.
<name>George</name>	George	Henry	[MASK] spoke with a happy pride, rejoicing wholeheartedly in the achievement, as though it had been his own. “Fine to think we can go on being socially useful even after we’re dead. Making plants grow.”
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Bernard	The spectacle of two young women giving breast to their babies made her blush and turn away her face. She had never seen anything so indecent in her life. And what made it worse was that, instead of tactfully ignoring it, [MASK] proceeded to make open comments on this revoltingly viviparous scene.
<name>Ford</name>	Ford	Bokanovsky	“My good boy!” The Director wheeled sharply round on him. “Can’t you see? Can’t you see?” He raised a hand; his expression was solemn. “[MASK]’s Process is one of the major instruments of social stability!”
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Helmholtz	Remember, they’ve had at least a quarter of a million warnings against solitude.” “I know. But I thought I’d like to see what the effect would be.” “Well, you’ve seen now.” [MASK] only laughed.
<name>God</name>	God	Ford	There isn’t any need for a civilized man to bear anything that’s seriously unpleasant. And as for doing things—[MASK] forbid that he should get the idea into his head. It would upset the whole social order if men started doing things on their own.”
<name>the woman</name>	the woman	Linda	The whip came down again, and again [MASK] screamed. He caught hold of the woman’s enormous brown hand between his own and bit it with all his might. She cried out, wrenched her hand free, and gave him such a push that he fell down.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Bernard	“Won’t you come to please me?” “No.” “Do you seriously mean it?” “Yes.” Despairingly, “But what shall I do?” [MASK] wailed. “Go to hell!” bawled the exasperated voice from within.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Bernard	Imagine yourself sitting there with a little baby of your own. ...” “[MASK]! How can you?” the passage of an old woman with ophthalmia and a disease of the skin distracted her from her indignation. “Let’s go away,” she begged.
<name>Bernard</name>	Bernard	Helmholtz	One of our most distinguished Emotional Engineers . . .” “But he’s right,” said [MASK] gloomily. “Because it is idiotic. Writing when there’s nothing to say . . “Precisely. But that requires the most enormous ingenuity.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	John	He did what she suggested and returned to his uneasy pacing of the room. “Impudent strumpet, impudent strumpet. The devil Luxury with his fat rump and potato finger ...” “[MASK].” He would not answer. “Fat rump and potato finger.”
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Lenina	“Come with me.” Obediendy, but unsmiling and (wholly insensible of the honour done to her) without elation, [MASK] walked after him, out of the room. The other guests followed at a respectful interval. The last of them slammed the door.
<name>Lenina</name>	Lenina	Linda	Moreover, she wasn’t a real savage, had been hatched out of a bottle and conditioned like any one else: so couldn’t have really quaint ideas. Finally—and this was by far the strongest reason for people’s not wanting to see poor [MASK]—there was her appearance.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Bernard	It would be eighteen hours at the least before she was in time again. [MASK] meanwhile lay pensive and wide-eyed in the dark. It was long after midnight before he fell asleep. Long after midnight; but his insomnia had not been fruitless; he had a plan.
<name>Bernard</name>	Bernard	Lenina	“They must be changing the shift,” said [MASK]. Like aphides and ants, the leaf-green Gamma girls, the black Semi-Morons swarmed round the entrances, or stood in queues to take their places in the monorail tram-cars.
<name>Curdie</name>	Curdie	Linda	Then suddenly, crash! something was upset; he heard people moving about quickly, and there was another crash and then a noise like hitting a mule, only not so bony; then [MASK] screamed. “Oh, don’t, don’t, don’t!”
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Linda	Squealing and chattering they entered. In a moment, it seemed, the ward was maggoty with them. They swarmed between the beds, clambered over, crawled under, peeped into the television boxes, made faces at the patients. [MASK] astonished and rather alarmed them.
<name>Linda</name>	Linda	Tomakin	Some one began to titter. “What’s the meaning,” began the Director, “of this monstrous ...” “[MASK]!” She ran forward, her blanket trailing behind her, threw her arms round his neck, hid her face on his chest.
<name>Mr. Stevens</name>	Mr. Stevens	Helmholtz	“I’m rather tired.” “Well, I’m not surprised,” said [MASK]. After a silence, “We’ve come to say good-bye,” he went on in another tone. “We’re off to-morrow morning.”
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Mitsima	“The fat’s in the liver, the cod’s in the sea.” And [MASK] also sang—a song about killing a bear. They worked all day, and all day he was filled with an intense, absorbing happiness.
<name>her mother</name>	her mother	Linda	She was grown up, but she wasn’t big enough to fight against three of them. It wasn’t fair for her either. “Why did they want to hurt you, [MASK]?” “I don’t know. How should I know?”
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Bernard	But inexorably, every thirty seconds, the minute hand of the electric clock above his bed jumped forward with an almost imperceptible click. Click, click, click, click . . . And it was morning. [MASK] was back among the miseries of space and time.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Linda	The boys began to point their fingers at him. In the strange other words they said that [MASK] was bad; they called her names he did not understand, but that he knew were bad names. One day they sang a song about her, again and again.
<name>Madeline</name>	Madeline	Linda	“What is it, [MASK]? What is it?” His voice was imploring; it was as though he were begging to be reassured. The look she gave him was charged with an unspeakable terror—with terror and, it seemed to him, reproach.
<name>She</name>	She	Lenina	[MASK] was genuinely astonished. “But I thought it was lovely.” “It was base,” he said indignandy, “it was ignoble.” She shook her head. “I don’t know what you mean.” Why was he so queer?
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Helmholtz	[MASK] shook his head. “Not quite. I’m thinking of a queer feeling I sometimes get, a feeling that I’ve got something important to say and the power to say it—only I don’t know what it is, and I can’t make any use of the power.
<name>Buck Mulligan</name>	Buck Mulligan	Fanny	And along with them, of course ...” “Don’t forget to ask him about that Malthusian belt,” said [MASK]. “Along with them all the old man’s mental peculiarities. Characters remain constant throughout a whole lifetime.” “. . .
<name>John</name>	John	Fanny	And yet in a way,” she had confessed to [MASK], “I feel as though I were getting something on false pretences. Because, of course, the first thing they all want to know is what it’s like to make love to a Savage.
<name>Mommy</name>	Mommy	Linda	Oh!” and she pushed him away, hard. His head banged against the wall. “Little idiot!” she shouted; and then, suddenly, she began to slap him. Slap, slap . . . “[MASK],” he cried out.
<name>Bernard</name>	Bernard	Bernard	“You don’t mean to say . . . ?” “Why not? [MASK]’s an Alpha Plus. Besides, he asked me to go to one of the Savage Reservations with him. I’ve always wanted to see a Savage Reservation.”
<name>Mrs. Soames</name>	Mrs. Soames	Lenina	“I want to know what passion is,” she heard him saying. “I want to feel something strongly.” “When the individual feels, the community reels,” [MASK] pronounced. “Well, why shouldn’t it reel a bit?”
<name>Lenina</name>	Lenina	Henry	“In this room, because it contains more high-caste workers than any other in the Centre. I have told him to meet me here at half-past two.” “He does his work very well,” put in [MASK], with hypocritical generosity.
<name>she</name>	she	Lenina	They looked at her for a long moment expressionlessly, without surprise, as though she had not been there at all. Then slowly, with bent back, the old man hobbled past them and was gone. “But it’s terrible,” [MASK] whispered.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Liberalism	“I do love flying,” they whispered, “I do love flying, I do love having new clothes, I do love . . .” © “[MASK], of course, was dead of anthrax, but all the same you couldn’t do things by force.”
<name>Jerome</name>	Jerome	Soma	[MASK] played none of these unpleasant tricks. The holiday it gave was perfect and, if the morning after was disagreeable, it was so, not intrinsically, but only by comparison with the joys of the holiday. The remedy was to make the holiday continuous.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Linda	She pulled down his arm; his face was uncovered. “Don’t, [MASK].” He shut his eyes, expecting the blow. But she didn’t hit him. After a little time, he opened his eyes again and saw that she was looking at him.
<name>Bernard</name>	Bernard	Lenina	They don’t know what it’s like being anything else. We’d mind, of course. But then we’ve been differently conditioned. Besides, we start with a different heredity.” “I’m glad I’m not an Epsilon,” said [MASK], with conviction.
<name>Wilde</name>	Wilde	Henry	“There was a thing called the soul and a thing called immortality.” “Do ask [MASK] where he got it.” “But they used to take morphia and cocaine.” “And what makes it worse, she thinks of herself as meat.”
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Lenina	“Which I simply don’t believe,” [MASK] concluded. “The noise of fourteen thousand aeroplanes advancing in open order. But in the Kurfurstendamm and the Eighth Arrondissement, the explosion of the anthrax bombs is hardly louder than the popping of a paper bag.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Linda	Don’t cry.” He pressed himself against her. He put his arm round her neck. [MASK] cried out. “Oh, be careful. My shoulder! Oh!” and she pushed him away, hard. His head banged against the wall.
<name>Isadora</name>	Isadora	Lenina	the stereoscopic blonde and aah! the more than real blackamoor. Horror, horror, horror ... he tried to disengage himself; but [MASK] tightened her embrace. “Why didn’t you say so?” she whispered, drawing back her face to look at him.
<name>Helmholtz</name>	Helmholtz	Bernard	“And now, if you don’t mind, I’ll go and see how poor [MASK]’s getting on.” 17 “Art, science—you seem to have paid a fairly high price for your happiness,” said the Savage, when they were alone.
<name>Bernard</name>	Bernard	Helmholtz	“His fordship will be down in a moment.” The Gamma butler left them to themselves. [MASK] laughed aloud. “It’s more like a caffeine-solution party than a trial,” he said, and let himself fall into the most luxurious of the pneumatic arm-chairs.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Bernard	[MASK] stood watching the retreating twinkle of the white stockings, the sunburnt knees vivaciously bending and unbending again, again, and the softer rolling of those well-fitted corduroy shorts beneath the bottle green jacket. His face wore an expression of pain.
<name>Lady Tressilian</name>	Lady Tressilian	Lenina	A notice in the lift announced that there were sixty Escalator-Squash Racket Courts in the hotel, and that Obstacle and Electro-magnetic Golf could both be played in the park. “But it sounds simply too lovely,” cried [MASK].
<name>He</name>	He	Henry	He started the engines and threw the helicopter screws into gear. The machine shot vertically into the air. [MASK] accelerated; the humming of the propeller shrilled from hornet to wasp, from wasp to mosquito; the speedometer showed that they were rising at the best part of two kilometres a minute.
<name>Neville</name>	Neville	Bernard	What should have been the crowning moment of [MASK]’s whole career had turned out to be the moment of his greatest humiliation. “I’d so much hoped ...” he stammeringly repeated, looking up at the great dignitary with pleading and distracted eyes.
<name>Dr. Edwards</name>	Dr. Edwards	Henry	he questioned. She shook her head again. [MASK] detected the weariness in those purple eyes, the pallor beneath that glaze of lupus, the sadness at the corners of the unsmiling crimson mouth. “You’re not feeling ill, are you?”
<name>God</name>	God	Ford	“Feeling better?” she ventured to ask. For answer, he lifted one hand from the controls and, slipping his arm around her, began to fondle her breasts. “Thank [MASK],” she said to herself, “he’s all right again.”
<name>Lenina</name>	Lenina	Lenina	The slower but infinitely surer methods of ectogenesis, neo-Pavlovian conditioning and hypnopxdia ...” And round her waist she wore a silver-mounted green morocco-surrogate cartridge belt, bulging (for [MASK] was not a freemartin) with the regulation supply of contraceptives.
<name>Kafka</name>	Kafka	Bernard	The litde black needle was scurrying, an insect, nibbling through time, eating into his money. “No escape,” repeated the Warden, waving him back into his chair; and as the permit was not yet countersigned, [MASK] had no choice but to obey.
<name>Mustapha</name>	Mustapha	Bernard	“I said that progress was lovely. That’s why you mustn’t come to the Reservation unless you really want to.” “But I do want to.” “Very well, then,” said [MASK]; and it was almost a threat.
<name>him</name>	him	Bernard	She drank and passed the cup to [MASK]. “I drink to the imminence of His Coming,” he repeated, with a sincere attempt to feel that the coming was imminent; but the eyebrow continued to haunt him, and the Coming, so far as he was concerned, was horribly remote.
<name>Bernard</name>	Bernard	Lenina	Free to have the most wonderful time. Everybody’s happy nowadays.” He laughed, “Yes, ‘Everybody’s happy nowadays.’ We begin giving the children that at five. But wouldn’t you like to be free to be happy in some other way, [MASK]?
<name>Linda</name>	Linda	Linda	“Now children!” she called. [MASK] had stirred uneasily, had opened her eyes for a moment, looked vaguely around, and then once more dropped off to sleep. Sitting beside her, the Savage tried hard to recapture his mood of a few minutes before.
<name>Randolph</name>	Randolph	Bernard	At this moment, and for no apparent reason, [MASK] suddenly remembered that he had left the Eau de Cologne tap in his bathroom wide open and running. . . supplied with current from the Grand Canyon hydroelectric station.” “Cost me a fortune by the time I get back.”
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Linda	“Well,” said [MASK], as they turned away, “all I can say is, it does seem a lot of fuss to make about so little. In civilized countries, when a boy wants to have a girl, he just . . .
<name>He</name>	He	Helmholtz	“I believe there’s somebody at the door,” he whispered. [MASK] got up, tiptoed across the room, and with a sharp quick movement flung the door wide open. There was, of course, nobody there.
<name>Bernard</name>	Bernard	Alphas	But if we happen to be [MASK], our bottles are, relatively speaking, enormous. We should suffer acutely if we were confined in a narrower space. You cannot pour upper-caste champagne-surrogate into lower-caste bottles. It’s obvious theoretically.
<name>Mother</name>	Mother	Linda	His hair was like two black ropes, and round his arm was a lovely silver bracelet with blue stones in it. He liked the bracelet; but all the same, he was frightened; he hid his face against [MASK]’s body.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Lenina	Those who meant well behaved in the same way as those who meant badly. Even [MASK] was making him suffer. He remembered those weeks of timid indecision, during which he had looked and longed and despaired of ever having the courage to ask her.
<name>Bernard</name>	Bernard	Bernard	To have dealings with members of the lower castes was always, for [MASK], a most distressing experience. For whatever the cause (and the current gossip about the alcohol in his blood-surrogate may very likely—for accidents will happen—have been true)
<name>Bernard</name>	Bernard	Bernard	I only said it was lovely here because . . . well, because progress is lovely, isn’t it?” “Five hundred repetitions once a week from thirteen to seventeen,” said [MASK] wearily, as though to himself. “What did you say?”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Heaven	[MASK] stops the nose at it. . .” But her perfume still hung about him, his jacket was white with the powder that had scented her velvety body. “Impudent strumpet, impudent strumpet, impudent strumpet.” The inexorable rhythm beat itself out.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Lenina	I’d hoped you would . . .” Yes, what hadn’t he hoped, when [MASK] confidentially told him that the Arch-Community-Songster would accept an invitation if it were sent. “He’s really rather sweet, you know.”
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Fanny	“But, [MASK], do you really mean to say that for the next three months you’re not supposed to . . .” “Oh no, dear. Only for a week or two, that’s all.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Helmholtz	“Now, now,” [MASK] protested. There was a silence. In spite of their sadness—because of it, even; for their sadness was the symptom of their love for one another—the three young men were happy.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Bernard	“I don’t know what you mean,” she repeated. Then, turning to him, “Oh, do let’s go back, [MASK],” she besought; “I do so hate it here.” “Don’t you like being with me?”
<name>Medusa</name>	Medusa	Lenina	One of the ropes writhed uneasily, and suddenly [MASK] saw that they were snakes. The men came nearer and nearer; their dark eyes looked at her, but without giving any sign of recognition, any smallest sign that they had seen her or were aware of her existence.
<name>Lenina</name>	Lenina	Bernard	he asked. “Am I what?” “Married. You know—for ever. They say ‘for ever’ in the Indian words; it can’t be broken.” “Ford, no!” [MASK] couldn’t help laughing.
<name>The girl</name>	The girl	Lenina	the end.” But [MASK] was not listening. She was watching the old man. Slowly, slowly he came down. His feet touched the ground. He turned. In their deep-sunken orbits his eyes were still extraordinarily bright.
<name>Edmond</name>	Edmond	Helmholtz	When, discomfited, he came and asked once more for the friendship which, in his prosperity, he had not thought it worth his while to preserve. [MASK] gave it; and gave it without a reproach, without a comment, as though he had forgotten that there had ever been a quarrel.
<name>Hermione</name>	Hermione	Linda	[MASK] stirred, woke up, stared for a few seconds bewilderedly at the Semi-finalists, then, lifting her face, sniffed once or twice at the newly perfumed air and suddenly smiled—a smile of childish ecstasy.
<name>Bernard</name>	Bernard	Bernard	“It’s more like a caffeine-solution party than a trial,” he said, and let himself fall into the most luxurious of the pneumatic arm-chairs. “Cheer up, [MASK],” he added, catching sight of his friend’s green unhappy face.
<name>Bernard</name>	Bernard	Bernard	In the end [MASK] had to slink back, diminished, to his rooms and inform the impatient assembly that the Savage would not be appearing that evening. The news was received with indignation. The men were furious at having been tricked into behaving politely to this insignificant fellow with the unsavoury reputation and the heretical opinions.
<name>Ford</name>	Ford	Ford	True, ideas were beginning to change even then. Our [MASK] himself did a great deal to shift the emphasis from truth and beauty to comfort and happiness. Mass production demanded the shift. Universal happiness keeps the wheels steadily turning; truth and beauty can’t.
<name>Rowdy</name>	Rowdy	Pope	For a long time, for hours and hours. And suddenly—he couldn’t help it—he began to cry. [MASK] burst out laughing. “Go,” he said, in the other Indian words. “Go, my brave Ahaiyuta.”
<name>Ford</name>	Ford	Ford	Boys at one with girls at peace; Orgy-porgy gives release. ” “Orgy-porgy,” the dancers caught up the liturgical refrain, “Orgy-porgy, [MASK] and fun, kiss the girls ...”
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	John	“Impudent strumpet, impudent strumpet, impudent strumpet.” The inexorable rhythm beat itself out. “Impudent . . .” “[MASK], do you think I might have my clothes?” He picked up the bell-bottomed trousers, the blouse, the zippicamiknicks.
<name>John</name>	John	Bernard	He laughed again. “What an outcry there was! The Principal had me up and threatened to hand me the immediate sack. I’m a marked man.” “But what were your rhymes?” [MASK] asked. “They were about being alone.”
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Lenina	What was he talking about now? “For always. They make a promise to live together for always.” “What a horrible idea!” [MASK] was genuinely shocked. “Outliving beauty’s outward with a mind that doth renew swifter than blood decays.”
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Ford	A sensation of warmth radiated thrillingly out from the solar plexus to every extremity of the bodies of those who listened; tears came into their eyes; their hearts, their bowels seemed to move within them, as though with an independent life. “[MASK]!”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Lenina	“Differently?” Were there other endings? “I didn’t want it to end with our going to bed,” he specified. [MASK] was astonished. “Not at once, not the first day.” “But then what. . . ?”
<name>Bernard</name>	Bernard	Bernard	“Yes, I can,” [MASK] answered in a very loud voice. Somewhat taken aback, but still majestically, “Then show it,” said the Director. “Certainly. But it’s in the passage. One moment.”
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Bernard	“But of course, [MASK]. It’s this horrible place.” “I thought we’d be more . . . more together here—with nothing but the sea and moon. More together than in that crowd, or even in my rooms.
<name>Mr. Flack</name>	Mr. Flack	Bernard	He was being shown a bird’s-eye view of it at present, a bird’s-eye view from the platform of the Charing-T Tower. The Station Master and the Resident Meteorologist were acting as guides. But it was [MASK] who did most of the talking.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Lenina	“I know you don’t. And that’s why we went to bed together yesterday—like infants—instead of being adults and waiting.” “But it was fun,” [MASK] insisted. “Wasn’t it?”
<name>Bernard</name>	Bernard	Bernard	“I know,” said [MASK], interrupting him. “I was talking to his fordship on the phone a moment ago.” His bored tone implied that he was in the habit of talking to his fordship every day of the week. He dropped into a chair.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Bernard	" [MASK], by this time, was fast asleep and smiling at the private paradise of his dreams. Smiling, smiling. But inexorably, every thirty seconds, the minute hand of the electric clock above his bed jumped forward with an almost imperceptible click.
<name>Lenina</name>	Lenina	John	What would the Controller think? To be labelled as the friend of a man who said that he didn’t like civilization—said it openly and, of all people, to the Controller—it was terrible. “But, [MASK],” he began.
<name>alive</name>	alive	John	she whispered again, and it was as though he had had a pailful of ordure thrown in his face. Anger suddenly boiled up in him. Balked for the second time, the passion of his grief had found another outlet, was transformed into a passion of agonized rage. “But I’m [MASK]!”
<name>Bokanovsky</name>	Bokanovsky	Gammas	Would the creature treat him with the respect due to his caste? The question haunted him. Not without reason. For [MASK], Deltas and Epsilons had been to some extent conditioned to associate corporeal mass with social superiority. Indeed, a faint hypnopaedic prejudice in favour of size was universal.
<name>Linda</name>	Linda	Lenina	“Like to come to a feely this evening?” [MASK] shook her head without speaking. “Going out with some one else?” It interested him to know which of his friends was being had by which other.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Fanny	I wish it weren’t,” she added sadly and sighed. “He’s terribly good-looking; don’t you think so?” “But doesn’t he like you?” asked [MASK]. “Sometimes I think he does and sometimes I think he doesn’t.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	John	“All the same,” [MASK] persisted, “I don’t believe it’s right.” The doctor shrugged his shoulders. “Well, of course, if you prefer to have her screaming mad all the time . . .”
<name>Bernard</name>	Bernard	Bernard	to kiss, slobberingly, and smelt too horrible, obviously never had a bath, and simply reeked of that beastly stuff that was put into Delta and Epsilon bottles (no, it wasn’t true about [MASK]), positively stank of alcohol.
