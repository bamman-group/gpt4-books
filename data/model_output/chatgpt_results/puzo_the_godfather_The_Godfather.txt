<name>someone</name>	someone	Sollozzo	They did everything they wanted to do. They were unlucky, not lucky. Those button men they hired weren’t good enough and the old man moved too quick. If they had killed him, I would have had to make a deal and [MASK] would have won.
<name>Giuseppe</name>	Giuseppe	Roberto	He saw a man of medium stature but strongly built, a peasant but not a bandit, though he so laughably dared to call himself an Italian. [MASK] shrugged. “I have already rented the apartment to another family for higher rent,” he said.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Mike	“[MASK] wouldn’t do anything like that,” she said. “He never had anything to do with his family. When we went to his sister’s wedding it was obvious that he was treated as an outsider, almost as much as I was.
<name>him</name>	him	Felix	This proved not to be the case. Still proud, he refused all help from his clan. But a lawyer friend of his, a young man well connected and with a budding career in a big law firm, talked [MASK] into doing him a little favor.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Kay	Her mother too had always been a little disinterested in her, holding her at arm’s length. And she did so now. “[MASK], stop being so dramatic. I’m sure it’s all a great deal of fuss about nothing at all.
<name>Pal Joey</name>	Pal Joey	Johnny	[MASK] said, “Buddy, I never asked you a favor, right? Do me a favor tonight and come with me. You’re the only guy who’ll really feel sorry for me if I don’t win.”
<name>her</name>	her	Sonny	He had sneered at her, “Go call your brother and tell him I won’t screw you, maybe he’ll beat me up until I get a hard on.” But he was in deadly fear of [MASK] though they treated each other with cold politeness.
<name>Shadowfax</name>	Shadowfax	Woltz	The light of dawn made his huge bedroom as misty as a foggy meadowland. Far down at the foot of his bed was a familiar shape and [MASK] struggled up on his elbows to get a clearer look. It had the shape of a horse’s head.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Kay	I won’t be telling you anything about my business. You’ll be my wife but you won’t be my partner in life, as I think they say. Not an equal partner. That can’t be.” [MASK] sat up in bed.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Michael	She left the bedroom to wash and dress in the bathroom down the hall. [MASK], still naked, the morning sun refreshing his body, lit a cigarette and relaxed on the bed. This was the last morning they would spend in this house and the villa.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Johnny	Then almost sadly with grave beauty she said, “You poor silly bastard, giving me cramps like a kid. Ah, [MASK], you always will be a dumb romantic guinea, you even make love like a kid.
<name>Alcoholics</name>	Alcoholics	Nino	“I’m not up on all the psychiatric jazz but I know something about it, part of my trade. Your friend [MASK] can be put back into fairly good shape unless the liver damage has gone too far, which we can’t know until an autopsy really.
<name>Debbie</name>	Debbie	Rita	This old routine of detail made him happy in some strange way, one of the few times he had felt happy since his wife had left him, nearly two years ago. He had married [MASK] when she was a high school kid and he was a rookie policeman.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Connie	He drank off the rest of the whiskey in the water glass, tilted the bottle to fill it again. He paid no more attention to her. [MASK] went into the kitchen, picked up the plates filled with food and smashed them against the sink.
<name>Dr. Sims</name>	Dr. Sims	Kellner	He was building a new snatch as easily as a carpenter nails together two-by-four studs. [MASK] was trimming away the excess vaginal wall using the fastening-down stitch to close the “bite” taken out of the tissue of the redundant angle, insuring that no troublesome projections would form.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Hagen	“The old man planned a lot of it. I never realized how smart he was. But I guess you know.” “Nobody like him,” [MASK] said. “But this is beautiful. This is the best. So you can’t be too bad either.”
<name>Luca</name>	Luca	Bonasera	The left eye drowned in blood had a star fracture in its lens. The bridge of his nose and left cheekbone were hammered into pulp. For one fraction of a second the Don put out his hand to support himself against [MASK]’s body.
<name>He</name>	He	Barzini	But [MASK] is a man who will know that without being told. You notice how he never committed himself in this affair. One might never have known he was in any way concerned. That is a man who doesn’t get caught on the losing side.”
<name>Fredo</name>	Fredo	Fabrizzio	The Don nodded. “[MASK] will take care of everything, he’s a clever boy, they taught him mechanics in the navy. I’ll give you some money in the morning and I’ll let your father know what’s happening. That I must do.”
<name>he</name>	he	Mike	“If I accepted that letter and you told a court of law I accepted that letter, it might be interpreted as my having knowledge of his whereabouts. Why don’t you just wait a bit? I’m sure [MASK] will get in touch.”
<name>him</name>	him	Michael	When you ran away. I hope I didn’t frighten you?’ The girl raised her eyes to him for just a fraction. She shook her head. But the loveliness of those eyes had made [MASK] look away.
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Sonny	And all it took was a sock on the jaw. How do you like that?” [MASK] made a comical gesture, a punch, and repeated, “How do you like that?” The tension had relaxed in the room.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Lucy	“I’ve prescribed a night’s rest for myself.” [MASK] smiled at him and said a little sadly, “Is it that obvious?” He shook his head and she said, “OK, supper then, but I’ll buy my own roulette chips.”
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Fanucci	[MASK] smiled at him, showing gold teeth and stretching his nooselike scar tight around his face. He mopped his face with a handkerchief and unbuttoned his jacket for a moment as if to cool himself but really to show the gun he carried stuck in the waistband of his comfortably wide trousers.
<name>He</name>	He	Vito	How can I move to another neighborhood with strangers? I want you to speak to the landlord to let me stay.” [MASK] nodded. “It’s done then. You won’t have to move. I’ll speak to him tomorrow morning.”
<name>he</name>	he	Hagen	It was a short ride, not more than twenty minutes, and when they got out of the car [MASK] could not recognize the neighborhood because darkness had fallen. They led him into a basement apartment and made him sit on a straight-backed kitchen chair.
<name>money</name>	money	Woltz	The picture is finished. The director was a square guy and treated me right. My scenes are too important to be left on the cutting-room floor just for [MASK] to pay me off. He can’t ruin a ten-million-dollar picture.
<name>Vito</name>	Vito	Sonny	Don’t you want to finish school, don’t you want to be a lawyer? Lawyers can steal more money with a briefcase than a thousand men with guns and masks.” [MASK] grinned at him and said slyly, “I want to enter the family business.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Hagen	I’ll give you the names of some judges who will give you a private audience. Until that time we have to guard against all treacheries.” [MASK] said, “Like you. I’m not worried so much about the real evidence as the evidence they will manufacture.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Michael	Her mother held it up for her to see and she raised those long lashes for a moment and then she looked directly at [MASK], her doelike brown eyes grave, and said, “Gra-zie." It was the first time he had heard her voice.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Luca	In his room, [MASK] unlocked the trunk beneath the bed and took out a bulletproof vest. It was heavy. He undressed and put it on over his woolen underwear, then put his shirt and jacket over it.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Johnny	The girl was a little disappointed. But what the hell, you couldn’t do everything all in one day, [MASK] thought. He woke up in the morning with a sense of apprehension, with a vague terror that he had dreamed his voice had come back.
<name>Rockefeller</name>	Rockefeller	Woltz	He never asks a second favor where he has been refused the first.” [MASK] shrugged. “I’m sorry. The answer is still no. But since you're here, what will it cost me to have that labor trouble cleared up? In cash.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Hagen	I should have such a cock.” They went back to the mansion to have dinner. It was served by three waiters under the command of a butler, the table linen and ware were all gold thread and silver, but [MASK] found the food mediocre.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Tom	“I don’t give a damn what your reasons are, just so long as you’re with us now. And I’ll tell you another thing, you’re right all the way. [MASK], what’s your say?”
<name>Don</name>	Don	Hagen	“No,” he said. “He told me to tell you you could have everything you want and do everything you want as long as you take good care of the kids.” [MASK] smiled. “He said to tell you that you’re his Don.
<name>Tessio</name>	Tessio	Sollozzo	Anytime he says, I’m in no hurry. I’ve got a hundred button men out on the street twenty-four hours a day. If [MASK] shows one hair on his asshole he’s dead. Let them take all the time they want.”
<name>Enrique</name>	Enrique	Michael	Again he was surprised. “Lunchtime,” [MASK] said. “Come on and eat with me and my family. My father said he’d like to meet you. We’ll walk over to his house. My mother should have some fried peppers and eggs and sausages.
<name>he</name>	he	Tommy	It was the sort of little ugly scene that was fairly commonplace, but [MASK], still a little irritable from his slumber, made a mistake. "Ah, fuck you and your nagging, I'll go out and eat.” As soon as he said it he regretted it.
<name>Fredo</name>	Fredo	Jules	“I’m not sore.” He turned to [MASK]. “That was a dumb thing for you to say. The Corleone Family has pulled some strings for you. Do you think I’m so stupid I’d ask you to do things you’d hate to do?
<name>Sonny</name>	Sonny	Michael	You gotta stand right next to them and blow their heads off and their brains get all over your nice Ivy League suit. How about that, kid, you wanta do that just because some dumb cop slapped you around?” He was still laughing. [MASK] stood up.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Kay	I don’t think he can talk yet or even know if I’m there. But I have to show respect.” [MASK] said quietly, “I feel so sorry for your father, he seemed like such a nice man at the wedding.
<name>Paulie</name>	Paulie	Clemenza	Dead in his car." [MASK] nodded and said to the man, “Don’t worry about it.” The button man gave his caporegime an astonished look, which was followed by a look of comprehension, before he went back to the kitchen.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Stracci	It was the kind of operation that would warm any man’s heart, business of itself creating more business. [MASK], too, was old-fashioned and never dealt in prostitution, but because his business was on the waterfront it was impossible for him not to be involved in the drug-smuggling traffic.
<name>Pan</name>	Pan	Fabrizzio	It seemed as if his body had sprung away from him out of himself. And then he heard the two shepherds laughing. “You got hit by the thunderbolt, eh?” [MASK] said, clapping him on the shoulder.
<name>Sal</name>	Sal	Clemenza	I don’t want anybody to know about this until then. Listen, I want to talk some family business with my brother, personal. Wait out in the living room, eh? We can finish our list later. You and [MASK] will work together on it.”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Johnny	But they won’t want to unless he takes an interest. Now just take my word for it that he can get you the Award. And that if he doesn’t do it, you won’t get it.” “OK,” [MASK] said.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Carlo	That the Don has finally decided to give you a chance in the hope of making your home life better. You got that?” There was a hopeful note in [MASK]’s voice as he answered, ‘Yeah, OK.”
<name>Ed</name>	Ed	Fanucci	It was from this experience came his oft-repeated belief that every man has but one destiny. On that night he could have paid [MASK] the tribute and have become again a grocery clerk with perhaps his own grocery store in the years to come.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Michael	And now that he had her alone, now that he legally possessed her, now that there was no barrier to his enjoying that body and face he had dreamed about every night, [MASK] could not bring himself to approach her.
<name>he</name>	he	Michael	That his father had paid for the power he had wielded all his life, the respect he had extorted from all those around him. What [MASK] wanted was out, out of all this, to lead his own life. But he couldn’t cut loose from the family until the crisis was over.
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Woltz	The men on night duty claimed that they had heard nothing. To [MASK] this seemed impossible. They could be made to talk. They had been bought off and they could be made to tell who had done the buying.
<name>Montresor</name>	Montresor	Corleone	He spoke at length for the first time. “I’ve agreed to everything here, I’m willing to forget my own misfortune. But I would like to hear some strict assurances from [MASK]. Will he attempt any individual vengeance?
<name>Bookie</name>	Bookie	Carlo	These bachelor bettors were the big gamblers, they bet heavier and came back around four o’clock to bet the second games of doubleheaders. They were the ones who made [MASK]’s Sundays a full-time day with overtime, though some married men called in from the beach to try and recoup their losses.
<name>Maya</name>	Maya	Sonny	They were happy together. When [MASK]’s father was gunned down in the street, she understood for the first time that her lover might be in danger. Alone in her apartment, she did not weep, she wailed aloud, an animal wailing.
<name>Judy</name>	Judy	Johnny	What you got to offer?” “1 can start you at five hundred and get you blind dates with movie stars, how’s that?” [MASK] said. “And maybe I’ll let you sing at my parties.”
<name>He</name>	He	Clemenza	“No,” he said. “Tonight, OK?” “OK,” she said. He hung up. [MASK] had finally come back from his day’s work and was bustling around the kitchen cooking up a huge pot of tomato sauce.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the context)	someone (There is no proper name given in the context)	Connie	What would happen after that he didn’t know. If the bastard had really hurt [MASK], he’d make a cripple out of the bastard. But the wind coming over the causeway, the salty freshness of the air, cooled his anger.
<name>Antonio</name>	Antonio	Clemenza	[MASK] served wine that he had made himself. His wife, after putting a plate of salami, olives and a loaf of Italian bread on the table, went down to sit with her women cronies in front of the building, carrying her chair with her.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Sonny	At that moment [MASK] noticed that the other car had not kept going but had parked a few feet ahead, still blocking his way. At that same moment his lateral vision caught sight of another man in the darkened toll-booth to his right.
<name>her</name>	her	Michael	On a small table were a bottle of wine and a plate of small wedding cakes. The huge canopied bed was never out of their vision. The young girl in the center of the room waited for [MASK] to make the first move.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Vito	He had heavy black brows and coarse features which, when he smiled, were in some odd way amiable. He spoke with a very thick Sicilian accent. “Ah, young fellow,” he said to [MASK]. “People tell me you’re rich.
<name>Rand</name>	Rand	Michael	The shepherd bodyguards were impressed. [MASK]’s voice had never sounded like this before when speaking to them. There was command and authority in it though he was making an apology. The cafe owner shrugged, more wary still, knowing he was not dealing with some farmboy.
<name>Don Corleone</name>	Don Corleone	Hagen	[MASK] switched bottles and poured them both a portion of the fiery, licorice-tasting alcohol. It was peasant, homemade stuff, much stronger than that sold in stores, the gift of an old friend who every year presented the Don with a small truckload.
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	Ginny	“I had a date with a girl in my apartment and she brushed me off. And you know, I was relieved.” To his surprise he saw a look of anger pass over [MASK]’s face. “Don’t worry about those little tramps,” she said.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Bonasera	But when he spoke, the words were cold with offended dignity. “Why did you go to the police? Why didn’t you come to me at the beginning of this affair?” [MASK] muttered almost inaudibly, “What do you want of me?
<name>Eddie</name>	Eddie	Hagen	[MASK] ignored the condescension. He explained. ‘You’ve got some labor trouble coming up. My friend can absolutely guarantee to make that trouble disappear. You have a top male star who makes a lot of money for your studio but he just graduated from marijuana to heroin.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Michael	“I swear he’s going to be OK,” he said. “Wait in the living room. I’ll come out as soon as I hear something.” He shut the door behind her. [MASK] had sat down in one of the big leather armchairs.
<name>he</name>	he	Sonny	Was it possible that all had been carefully planned as [MASK] had said? Everything fitted in. Still cool, he said to the captain, “I’m not leaving this hospital until you put guards around my father’s room.” The captain didn’t bother answering.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Johnny	“He’s a businessman,” the Don said blandly. “I’ll make him an offer he can’t refuse.” “It’s too late,” [MASK] said. “All the contracts have been signed and they start shooting in a week.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name in the given context)	unknown (There is no proper name in the given context)	Lucy	and this time she could feel him but more important she could tell that he was feeling something too and coming to his climax. When he rolled off her body, [MASK] huddled into one corner of the bed and began to cry. She felt so ashamed.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sonny	“I do. It’s perfect for us. A small family place with big booths where people can talk in private. Good food. Everybody minds their own business. Perfect.” He leaned over [MASK]’s desk and arranged stubbed-out cigarettes into map figures.
<name>He</name>	He	Clemenza	He had the good sense to know that it was not an area for heavy threats but light ones. He kept the whole operation in a minor key, which was exactly what was needed. [MASK] felt the relief of a conscientious administrator who has solved a knotty personnel problem.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Gatto	But he sensed tension in the thin dark face. He knew [MASK]’s reputation as an up-and-coming man, a very quick man who knew how to get delicate jobs done without complications, and today he had failed in his duty.
<name>Kay</name>	Kay	Kay	He was surprised to find himself so secretive with [MASK]. He loved her, he trusted her, but he would never tell her anything about his father or the Family. She was an outsider. “What about you?”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Abbandando	“You blaspheme. Resign yourself.” [MASK] fell back on the pillow. His eyes lost their wild gleam of hope. The nurse came back into the room and started shooing them out in a very matter-of-fact way.
<name>He</name>	He	Carlo	she asked. Her worried frown made her look old and unattractive. [MASK] shrugged. “He’s been promising me a big deal. Maybe that’s what he wants to talk about. That’s what he hinted anyway."
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Greene	I don’t know what you’re getting sore about. We’ll buy your share at any reasonable price you name, what’s wrong with that? What’s unfair about that? With your casino losing money we’re doing you a favor.” [MASK] shook his head.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Freddie	They got your brother [MASK] down at the Chelsea precinct. You better get him a doctor when they turn him loose. I’m going down to the hospital now to help question your old man, if he can talk. I’ll keep you posted.”
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Michael	[MASK] laughed. “We can talk ourselves into any viewpoint,” he said. “But we figured it right the first time. I’ve been riding the gravy train all my life, it’s about time I paid my dues.”
<name>Dutch</name>	Dutch	Clemenza	“Why do we have to pay him? What can he do to the three of us? We’re stronger than him. We have guns. Why do we have to hand over the money we earned?” [MASK] explained patiently.
<name>Vito</name>	Vito	Fanucci	He forgot about it immediately. During World War I, when imported olive oil became scarce, [MASK] acquired a part-interest in the Abbandando grocery store by supplying it not only with oil, but imported Italian salami, hams and cheeses.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Hagen	she asked. “I expected to see some of the ‘boys’ get out of the car with their machine guns to make me go back.” For the first time since she had known him, she saw [MASK] angry.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Kay	For that purpose he brought his whole family east on a last visit. They would stay a month, wind up business, [MASK] would do the personal family’s packing and shipping of household goods. There were a million other minor details.
<name>Big Boy</name>	Big Boy	Johnny	And she was giggling at him. Spread-eagled on the floor, her brocaded gown hitched up above her thighs, she taunted him between giggles. “Come on, stick it in. Stick it in, [MASK], that’s what you really want."
<name>Vito</name>	Vito	Hagen	“I’m sorry. The answer is still no. But since you're here, what will it cost me to have that labor trouble cleared up? In cash. Right now.” That solved one puzzle for [MASK].
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Kay	She kept nodding her head as if all the facts accorded with some private specifications in her mind. [MASK] was so nervous that she just answered the questions, never saying anything else. She saw him first through the kitchen window.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Michael	[MASK] knelt beside his father, holding his hand, while the other men called for an ambulance and doctor. With a great effort the Don opened his eyes to see his son once more. The massive heart attack had turned his ruddy face almost blue.
<name>Giuseppe</name>	Giuseppe	Vito	The father refused to knuckle under and in a public quarrel killed the local Mafia chief. A week later he himself was found dead, his body torn apart by lupara blasts. A month after the funeral Mafia gunmen came inquiring after the young boy, [MASK].
<name>Miss Emily</name>	Miss Emily	Virginia	He’s such a sweet old guy and they tell such horrible stories about him.” [MASK] hated phones and she had had all the extensions taken out except for the one in her bedroom and one in the kitchen. Now they could hear the kitchen phone ringing.
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Rocco	First, he had to have a good excuse for [MASK] to accompany them. Second, he had to have a plausible mission for the three of them to go on. Of course, strictly speaking, this was not necessary.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Woltz	He respects that relationship very much.” [MASK] had been doodling with a huge, red-feathered pen. At the mention of money his interest was aroused and he stopped doodling. He said patronizingly, “This picture is budgeted at five million.”
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Tom	“Except my Godfather. And you. No, [MASK], it’s not a lot of crap. An Academy Award can make an actor for ten years. He can get his pick of roles. The public goes to see him.
<name>she</name>	she	Connie	Then he threw her contemptuously onto the bed. He drank from the bottle of whiskey still on the night table. He seemed very drunk now, his light blue eyes had a crazy glint in them and finally [MASK] was truly afraid.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Ginny	I swear 1 11 never miss one Friday, I don’t care how far away I am or how busy I am. And then whenever I can I’ll spend weekends or maybe the kids can spend some part of their vacations with me.” [MASK] put an ashtray on his chest.
<name>Eddie</name>	Eddie	Nino	I won’t try to run your life. You do whatever you wanta do. OK, paisan? All you gotta do is sing for me and earn me money now that I can’t sing anymore. You got that, old buddy?" [MASK] straightened up.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Michael	[MASK] shrugged. “It looks bad. But my father was the only one who understood that political connections and power are worth ten regimes. I think I’ve got most of my father’s political power in my hands now, but I’m the only one who really knows that.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bonasera	They glanced at him, shamefaced, yet in their eyes was an odd, triumphant defiance. Out of control, [MASK] leaned forward toward the aisle and shouted hoarsely, “You will weep as I have wept—I will make you weep as your children make me weep”—the linen at his eyes now.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Carlo	“Ahh, I just slapped her face a few times,” [MASK] said. “I didn’t hurt her.” He brooded for a moment. “She thinks she can boss me around, I don’t stand for that.”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Clemenza	He remembered [MASK] had told him not to do this, to come out of the toilet and blaze away. But either out of some warning instinct or sheer funk he had not done so. He had felt that if he had made one swift move he would have been cut down.
