<name>Captain</name>	Captain	Diccon	“Ay, [MASK],” I answered. “Before we saw the land, the fragrance told us we were near it.” “I smell it now,” he went on, “and the bloom of the grape, and the May-time flowers.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Diccon	I have spent my life in gathering darkness for myself at the last.” I bent lower over him, and took his hand in mine. “[MASK], my man,” I said. A brightness came into his face, and he faintly pressed my hand.
<name>Ichabod</name>	Ichabod	Rolfe	An hour later a whippoorwill uttered its cry close to the window, through which now shone the crescent moon. [MASK] started up. “Beshrew me! but I had forgot that I am to sleep at Chaplain's to-night. I must hurry on.”
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Diccon	Now and again one or the other looked behind, but we saw only the pines and the gathering dusk. Hope was strengthening in us, when a second bullet dug into the earth just beyond us. [MASK] swore beneath his breath. “It struck deep,” he muttered.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Diccon	I applied myself to the dinner, and [MASK] went to the window, and stood there looking out at the blue sky and at the man in the pillory. He had the freedom of the gaol. I was somewhat more straitly confined, though my friends had easy access to me.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Opechancanough	Scarcely was the meal over when [MASK] issued from his lodge, with his picked men behind him, and, coming slowly up to us, took his seat upon the white mat that was spread for him. For a few minutes he sat in a silence that neither we nor his people cared to break.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Angela	At the last I shall know what to do. But now why may I not take [MASK] and cross that strip of sand and go into the woods on the other side? They are so fair and strange,--all red and yellow,--and they look very still and peaceful.
<name>Hiawatha</name>	Hiawatha	Powhatan	He calls me no more his brave, his brother [MASK]'s dear son. I do not sit by his council fire now, nor do I lead his war bands. When I went last to his lodge and stood before him, his eyes burned me like the coals the Monacans once closed my hands upon.
<name>available</name>	available	open,--yes	“Did you not, falling in with a pirate ship, cast in your lot with the scoundrels upon it, and yourself turn pirate?” “In some sort.” “And become their chief?” “Since there was no other situation [MASK].”
<name>Calypso</name>	Calypso	Dale	“[MASK] would not let you go scot-free, but would sell you into slavery. At your own entreaty I bought you, since when you have served me indifferently well. You have showed small penitence for past misdeeds, and your amendment hath been of yet lesser bulk.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jeremy	When they had finished I turned and held [MASK]'s hand in mine for an instant, then followed the new-comer to the ladder and out of the hold; the two men coming after us, and resolving themselves above into a guard.
<name>Pocahontas</name>	Pocahontas	Rolfe	The Paspaheghs have washed off the black paint. If my brothers go to the village, they will find the peace pipe ready for their smoking.” [MASK] and I stared at each other. “I have sent messengers,” continued the Emperor.
<name>Hiawatha</name>	Hiawatha	Opechancanough	Instead I went with speed to seek [MASK]. Yesterday, when the sun was low, I found him, sitting in his lodge above the marshes and the colored river. We smoked the peace pipe together, and I am his war chief again.
<name>Stonewall</name>	Stonewall	Nantauquas	“[MASK]?” he muttered in my ear, and I nodded yes. The volley that we fired full into the ranks of our foe was deadly, and we looked to see them turn and flee, as they had fled before.
<name>Princess</name>	Princess	Manoa	In a moment the favorite was before her, hat in hand, bowing to the ground. “My quest hath ended where I feared it but begun!” he cried, flushed and exultant. “I have found my [MASK] sooner than I thought for.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Diccon	There are two sharp knives there, hanging beneath the bow and the quiver and the shield. Take them and hide them.” The words were scarcely out of his mouth before [MASK] had the two keen English blades. I took the one he offered me, and hid it in my doublet.
<name>Native Americans</name>	Native Americans	Indians	The air was cold, but exceedingly clear and still. Now and then a dog barked, or wolves howled in the forest across the river. We kept in the shadow of the houses and the trees, and went with the swiftness, silence, and caution of [MASK].
<name>Eric</name>	Eric	Sparrow	If, wearied out, we had given up the fight, her look would have spurred us on to wrestle with our fate to the last gasp. She sat between [MASK] and me, and as best we might we shielded her from the drenching seas and the icy wind.
<name>John</name>	John	Diccon	I walked rapidly on down the street to the minister's house. The light was very pale as yet, and house and garden lay beneath a veil of mist. No one was stirring. I went on through the gray wet paths to the stable, and roused [MASK].
<name>John</name>	John	Giles	The late sun now shining in at the open window made the glass to glow like precious stones. My lord rang a little silver bell, and a door behind us was opened. “Wine, [MASK]!” cried my lord in a raised voice.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Diccon	Gathering up the gaoler's gold I started toward the door, opened it, and going out would have closed it softly behind me but that a booted leg thrust across the jamb prevented me. “I am going with you,” said [MASK] in a guarded voice.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Diccon	The hush could only mean that [MASK] was dead or taken. I could not look behind to see. With an access of fury I drove my antagonist toward a corner of the hut,--the corner, so it chanced, in which the panther had taken up its quarters.
<name>The Sheriff</name>	The Sheriff	West	Before the fire, his head thoughtfully bent, and his fingers tapping upon the arm of his chair, sat the Governor; over against him, and as serious of aspect, was the Treasurer. [MASK] stood by the mantel, tugging at his long mustaches and softly swearing.
<name>Macbeth</name>	Macbeth	Ralph	When I saw that they were light of foot and would overtake me, I set my burden down, and, drawing a sword that I had with me, went back to meet them halfway. [MASK], I slew all three,--may the Lord have mercy on my soul!
<name>Queen Gertrude</name>	Queen Gertrude	Burbage	Once I played the King's ghost in Will Shakespeare's 'Hamlet,' and then, I warrant you, I spoke from the cellarage indeed. I so frighted players and playgoers that they swore it was witchcraft, and [MASK]'s knees did knock together in dead earnest.
<name>God</name>	God	Kiwassa	There may come a moon when the deep forests and the shining rivers know us, to whom [MASK] gave them, no more.” He paused, with unmoved face, and eyes that seemed to pierce the wall and look out into unfathomable distances. “Go!”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Diccon	“This is a trust, [MASK],” I said. The red came into his tanned face. He raised his hand and made our old military salute. “I understand it so, my captain,” he answered, and I rode away satisfied.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Rolfe	“It looks as smooth as a table. But we can easily shift under the cedars where there is no grass.” “Here's a projecting root,” announced the Secretary, when the new ground had been reached. [MASK] shrugged his shoulders, but we moved again.
<name>Chingachgook</name>	Chingachgook	Diccon	Presently he withdrew his hand from my clasp, and, putting his finger to his lips, whistled low to the Indian girl. She drew aside the hanging mats, and we passed out, [MASK] and I, leaving him standing as we had found him, upright against the post, in the red firelight.
<name>lonely</name>	lonely	fordone	While I struggled one came and flung that dastard out of the way, then asked me plainly to become his wife, and there was no laugh or insult in his voice. I was wearied and [MASK] and desperate.... So I met my husband,
<name>Viola</name>	Viola	Opechancanough	As he spoke, he took from his neck the rope of pearls and from his arm a copper bracelet, and laid both upon my palm. I thrust the pearls within my doublet, and slipped the bracelet upon my wrist. “Thanks, [MASK],” I said briefly.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Buckingham	I sat and smoked in silence. “The King begins to dote upon him,” he said; “leans on his arm, plays with his hand, touches his cheek. [MASK] stands by, biting his lip, his brow like a thundercloud.
<name>Crusoe</name>	Crusoe	Diccon	[MASK], going to the landward side of the islet, found some oysters, which we roasted and ate; but we had nor wine nor water with which to wash them down. “At least there are here no foes to fear,” quoth my lord.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Nicolo	Dazed as yet, he stared, with no comprehension in his eyes, at the clouds, the sail, the rushing water, the dark figures about him. “[MASK]!” he cried sharply. “He's not here, my lord,” I said.
<name>Washington</name>	Washington	Rolfe	In the hall at the Governor's house, I had written a line of farewell to [MASK], and had given the paper into the hand of a trusty fellow, charging him not to deliver it for two hours to come.
<name>Conan</name>	Conan	Opechancanough	Now, when a man's lips widen I look into his eyes. The eyes of [MASK] were as fathomless as a pool at midnight, and as devoid of mirth or friendliness as the staring orbs of the carven imps upon the temple corners.
<name>Flint</name>	Flint	Paradise	“So you would be our captain?” said [MASK], picking up another shell, and poising it upon a hand as fine and small as a woman's. “Faith, you might go farther and fare worse,” I answered, and began to hum a tune.
<name>Strickland</name>	Strickland	Diccon	“We may thank our stars that they missed our trail,” [MASK] answered. We spoke no more, but, leaving the stream, struck again toward the south. The day wore on, and still we went without pause.
<name>Falstaff</name>	Falstaff	Zooks	The King's minion lacked not the courage of the body, nor, when passionate action had brought him naught, a certain reserve force of philosophy. He now did the best thing he could have done,--burst into a roar of laughter. “[MASK]!” he cried.
<name>Uncas</name>	Uncas	Rolfe	“He loves us as a cat loves the mouse that it plays with. If we are to start at once, sir, I'll go get my horse.” “Then meet us at the neck of land,” said [MASK].
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Diccon	He stood for a minute, the quick change that had come into his face at [MASK]'s blundering words gone, and his features sternly impassive again; then, very slowly, he raised his arm from his side and held out his hand.
<name>Lyonesse</name>	Lyonesse	Sparrow	I took it with a bow, and handed it to [MASK]. The King's ward had risen, and now leant against the bank of sand, her long dark hair, half braided, drawn over either shoulder, her face marble white between the waves of darkness.
<name>Mr. Gray</name>	Mr. Gray	Pory	My lord, dressed with his usual magnificence and darkly handsome as ever, was indeed standing within the guest-house door. [MASK] drew up beside him. I was passing on with a slight bow, when the Secretary caught me by the sleeve.
<name>Tristan</name>	Tristan	Sparrow	I restore you your sword, my lord, and there lies my challenge.” I flung my glove at his feet, and [MASK] unbuckled the keen blade which he had worn since the day I had asked it of its owner, and pushed it to me across the table.
<name>Stapleton</name>	Stapleton	Diccon	A moment's fierce struggle, and I had the dagger in my own hand and the man at my mercy. The fire upon the hearth seized on a pine knot and blazed up brightly, filling the room with light. “[MASK]!”
<name>prison</name>	prison	them,--even	“Am I to go in fetters?” “No,” he replied, with a smile. “I have no instructions on the subject, but I will take it upon myself to free you from [MASK] for the sake of that excellently writ letter.”
<name>Lenore</name>	Lenore	Jocelyn	Alike in the darkness of the deep woods, and in the silver of the glades, and in the long twilight stretches of sassafras and sighing grass, there was for me but one vision. Slender and still and white, she moved before me, with her wide dark eyes upon my face. [MASK]!
<name>Pocahontas</name>	Pocahontas	Nantauquas	“I will not call you 'traitor,' [MASK],” I said, after a pause. “There is a difference. You are not the first child of Powhatan who has loved and shielded the white men.” “She was a woman, a child,” he answered.
<name>Captain Flint</name>	Captain Flint	Kirby	It was their whim--a huge jest of which they could never have enough--still to make believe that they sailed under [MASK]. Lest it should spoil the jest, and while the jest outranked all other entertainment, they obeyed as though I had been indeed that fierce sea wolf.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Diccon	“Likely enough,” I said. “Come within. I have eaten nothing since yesterday.” “I'll speak to [MASK] first,” he answered, and went on toward the forecastle, while I entered the state cabin.
<name>Uncas</name>	Uncas	Diccon	We ate sitting side by side with our captors, and [MASK], with a great cut across his head, seized the Indian girl who brought him his platter of fish, and pulling her down beside him kissed her soundly, whereat the maid seemed not ill pleased and the warriors laughed.
<name>Mason</name>	Mason	Diccon	As she spoke, the latch rose and some one pushed heavily against the door. I had drawn the bars across. “Who is it?” I demanded, going to it. “It is [MASK], sir,” replied a guarded voice outside.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Buckingham	but [MASK] would be a happy man if he were kept here forever and a day! My lord knows what he risks, and he's in as black a humor as ever you saw. But I have striven to drop oil on the troubled waters. '
<name>Rochester</name>	Rochester	Carnal	She saw party after party come back without you, and she believed that you were left behind in the forest. Also she knew that the George waited but for the search to be quite given over, and for my Lord [MASK]'s recovery.
<name>Stoddard</name>	Stoddard	Rolfe	“It's a long shot, but there's no harm in trying.” As I spoke I raised my gun to my shoulder; but he leaned across [MASK], who stood between us, and plucked me by the sleeve. “You've not looked at him closely.
<name>John</name>	John	Diccon	She talked no more, and by and by I felt her head droop against my shoulder. “Madam is asleep,” said [MASK]'s voice behind me. “Ay,” I answered. “She'll find a jack of mail but a hard pillow.
<name>Treasure</name>	Treasure	Kirby	“A ship!” bawled the apparition, and vanished. The clamor increased; voices cried for captain and mate, and more pirates appeared at the door, swearing out the good news, come in search of [MASK], and giving no choice but to go with them at once.
<name>Beauclerk</name>	Beauclerk	Rolfe	I give you joy of your petty victory.” He turned squarely from me, and stood with his face downstream. I was speaking to [MASK] and to the few--not even all of that side for which I had won--who pressed around me, when he wheeled.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Rolfe	A moment more, and I heard the heavy bars drop into place. CHAPTER V IN WHICH A WOMAN HAS HER WAY TEN days later, [MASK], going down river in his barge, touched at my wharf, and finding me there walked with me toward the house.
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Burgess	but they were still the observed of all observers; to be pointed out to strangers, run after by children, gaped at by the vulgar, bowed to with broad smiles by [MASK], Councilor, and commander, and openly contemned by those dames who had attained to a husband in somewhat more regular fashion.
<name>Long John Silver</name>	Long John Silver	Sharpless	She's rasedecked!” “Then she's Spanish, sure enough!” cried the Governor. From the crowd of servants, felons, and foreigners rose a great clamor, and presently we made out [MASK] perched on a cask in their midst and wildly gesticulating.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Diccon	“[MASK]!” I called, without turning, when I had finished. He came slowly forward to the table, and stood beside it with hanging head. I tore the leaf from the book and pushed it over to him. “Take it,” I ordered.
<name>man</name>	man	Dale	I have winked at much, have shielded you in much, perhaps. In return I have demanded one thing, which if you had not given I would have found you another [MASK] to deal with.” “Have I ever refused it, my captain?”
<name>Attila</name>	Attila	Opechancanough	The village glowed like a lamp set in the dead blackness of marsh and forest. [MASK] came from the forest with a score of warriors behind him, and stopped beside me. I rose to greet him, as was decent; for he was an Emperor, albeit a savage and a pagan.
<name>Samuel</name>	Samuel	Yeardley	Small hope there was in those two. That the Governor and Council, remembering old dangers shared, wished me well I did not doubt, but that was all. [MASK] had done all he could do, more than most men would have dared to do, in procuring this delay.
<name>Black Dog</name>	Black Dog	Diccon	They were not all bad. [MASK] had the virtue of fidelity, if none other; there were a brace of Puritans, and a handful of honest fools, who, if they drilled badly, yet abhorred mutiny.
<name>Hiawatha</name>	Hiawatha	Opechancanough	“[MASK] is very wise,” he answered quietly. “He says that now the English will believe in his love indeed when they see that he holds dear even one who might be called his enemy, who hath spoken against him at the Englishmen's council fire.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Diccon	We two could have no speech together; the fire was between us, and we saw each other but dimly through the flame and wreathing smoke,--as each might see the other to-morrow. What [MASK]'s thoughts were I know not; mine were not of the morrow.
<name>the Great Spirit</name>	the Great Spirit	Kiwassa	According to their wont the Indians ate ravenously, and when the meal was ended began to smoke, each warrior first throwing into the air, as thank-offering to [MASK], a pinch of tobacco. They all stared at the fire around which we sat, and the silence was unbroken.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Ralph	He put his arm within mine and drew me out into the sunshine upon the doorstep. “I thought I should find you here,” he said; “but it is only a room with its memories, [MASK]. Out here is more breadth, more height.
<name>he</name>	he	Nemattanow	I have told them that [MASK] was a murderer, and that his death was just. They are satisfied. Their village is as still as this beast at my feet.” He pointed downward to a tame panther crouched against his moccasins. I thought it an ominous comparison.
<name>Matthew</name>	Matthew	Nantauquas	He wishes to see him alone.” “I shall hardly be troubled with company,” I said. “There's a bear-baiting toward.” [MASK] smiled. “My brother asked me to find a bear for to-day.
<name>Biddy</name>	Biddy	Margaret	“'T is woman's work, [MASK]!” he cried. “Tell him!” More merciful than the men, she came to me at once, the tears running down her cheeks, and laid one trembling hand upon my arm.
<name>Long John Silver</name>	Long John Silver	Nicolo	My lord began to laugh. Either he had been drinking, or the success of his villainy had served for wine. “You are a man in a thousand, [MASK]!” he said. “How far above or below the ship is this fortunate wood?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Wynne	But as the council at the Governor's was breaking up, and as [MASK] and I were hurrying off to make our choice of the craft at the landing, there came a great noise from the watchers upon the bank, and a cry that boats were coming down the stream.
<name>Uncas</name>	Uncas	Diccon	Blood gushed over my hand and wrist, the clutch upon my arm relaxed, the head fell back. The dying eyes glared into mine; then the lids shut forever upon that unquenchable hatred. I staggered to my feet and turned, to find that [MASK] had given account of the third Indian.
<name>Don</name>	Don	Rolfe	groaned [MASK]. “I will drink but a cup of wine, sir, and then will be gone upon this new quest.” There was a movement in the room. “You are worn and spent with your fruitless travel, sir,” said the Governor kindly.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Diccon	The sunshine streaming down in the spaces where the trees fell away was not brighter than our mood. Had we not smoked the peace pipe? Were we not on our way home? [MASK], walking behind me, fell into a low-voiced conversation with the savage who strode beside him.
<name>God</name>	God	Kirby	I said. He fell back against the heaped-up sand and leaned there, panting, with his hand to his side. “[MASK] or devil,” he replied. “Have it your own way.” I turned to the now highly excited rabble.
<name>masks</name>	masks	Okee	At last the dancers were still, the women scattered, the priests with their hideous [MASK] gone. The wailing of the pipes died away, the drums ceased to beat, and the village lay in the keen wind and the pale light, inert and quiet with the stillness of exhaustion.
<name>delegate</name>	delegate	Burgess	There seemed naught that I could do, naught that she could do. Our Fate had us by the hands, and held us fast. We stood still, and the days came and went like dreams. While the Assembly was in session I had my part to act as [MASK] from my hundred.
<name>Balin</name>	Balin	Nantauquas	“You were wont to speak plainly, [MASK],” I answered him. “I am not fond of riddles.” Again he waited, as though he found speech difficult. I stared at him in amazement, he was so changed in so short a time.
<name>Don Juan</name>	Don Juan	Art	[MASK] paid, thou bridegroom?” “No,” I answered. “Bring her here to laugh at me as she laughed in the twilight beneath the guesthouse window.” I thought he would murder me with the poniard he drew, but presently he put it up.
<name>John</name>	John	Diccon	[MASK] caught up a piece of rusted iron from the hearth, and together we faced my lord's drawn sword and a small, sharp, and strangely shaped dagger that the Italian drew from a velvet sheath. My lord laughed, reading my thoughts.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sparrow	Stay here if you please, or come aft if you please.” I went back and took the tiller from [MASK]. We were now in mid-river, and the swollen stream and the strong wind bore us on with them like a leaf before the gale.
<name>captain</name>	captain	Diccon	I beckoned to [MASK], and putting the tiller into his hands went forward to reef the sail. When it was done and I was back in my place, my lord spoke again. “Where are we going, captain?” “I don't know.”
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Sparrow	The minister and I saw each other dimly, as spectres. Some one brought us mouldy biscuit that I wanted not, and water for which I thirsted. [MASK] put the small pitcher to his lips, kept it there a moment, then held it to mine.
<name>D'Artagnan</name>	D'Artagnan	Sparrow	[MASK], his prize flung across his saddlebow, turned with me. A minute more saw us out of the hollow, and entered upon the glade up which had come the Italian. When we had gone a short distance, I turned in my saddle and looked back.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Rolfe	Will you tell me why it is so very full of pity, and why there are tears in your eyes?” She shrank back in her chair with a little cry, and [MASK] stepped toward me, then turned sharply aside. “I cannot!”
<name>Heyward</name>	Heyward	Rolfe	“I will walk alone,” she said. “None that see me shall think that I am stricken down.” I watched her move away, [MASK] beside her, and the Indian following with his noiseless step; then I went to the Governor's house.
<name>George</name>	George	Rolfe	In these virgin woods the trees are set well apart, though linked one to the other by the omnipresent grape, and there is little undergrowth, so that we were able to make good speed. [MASK] and I rode well in front of our men.
<name>Galahad</name>	Galahad	Jocelyn	“We wish you well. Let her win you through.” “First tell the truth, my lord,” said the King's ward; “then come and take the reward you ask.” “[MASK]!” I cried. “I command you”--
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Diccon	“[MASK]!” I cried. “What is the matter?” Before I could reach him he had sunk to his knees. When I put my hand upon his arm and again demanded what ailed him, he tried to laugh, then tried to swear, and ended with another groan.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Hamor	I shrugged the shoulders of my spirit, but said nothing. So, hand in hand, though at arms' length, we passed from the shade of the cedars into the open meadow, where we presently met [MASK] and his party.
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Diccon	Blithe enough to all seeming, and with as few inward misgivings as the case called for, [MASK] and I went with the subtle Emperor and the young chief he had bound to himself once more, and with their fierce train, back to that village which we had never thought to see again.
<name>a boy</name>	a boy	Nantauquas	But he looked a man in the prime of life; his frame was vigorous, his skin unwrinkled, his eyes bright and full. When he rose to welcome us, and [MASK] stood beside him, there seemed not a score of years between them.
<name>Pan</name>	Pan	Kiwassa	The little stream flashed diamonds, and the carven devils upon the black houses above us were frightful no longer. There was not a menace anywhere from the cloudless skies to the sweet and plaintive chant to [MASK], sung by women and floating to us from the woods beyond the hollow.
<name>Priscilla</name>	Priscilla	Rolfe	The Puritan dress in which I first saw her was a thing of the past; she clothed herself now like the parrakeets in the forest,--or liker the lilies of the field, for verily she toiled not, neither did she spin. [MASK] and I rose from our seats.
<name>Long John Silver</name>	Long John Silver	Sparrow	And hands off the woman until we've time to draw lots!” He and the Spaniard led the rush. I turned my head and nodded to [MASK], then faced them again. “Then may the Lord have mercy upon your souls!” I said.
<name>Wakan Tanka</name>	Wakan Tanka	Kiwassa	He comes to the temples to pray to [MASK] for a great hunting. Will you, when you lie at his feet, that he ask you, 'Where is the friend of my friend, of my war chief, of the Panther who is one with me again?'”
